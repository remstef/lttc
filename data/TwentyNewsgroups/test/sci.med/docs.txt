There can be. But depression is not diagnositic of thyroid deficiency.\nThyroid blood tests are easy, cheap, and effective in diagnosing thyroid\ndeficiencies.
When kids stayed in the home until kindergarden or 1st grade, infection \nincidence was much lower because exposure was lower.  Some studies suggest \nthat early exposure to various infectious diseases is probably beneficial \nbecause exposure as an adult carries much more risk of morbitity and \nmortality(mumps, measles. etc.).\n\n\nDaycare will always carry a higher exposure risk than home care.\n\n\nExposure to infectious organisms does build immunity.  But many viruses \nmutate and reexposure to the new strain requires another immune response(\nnew antibody production).  In addition, antibody levels tend to decline \nwith time and re-innoculation is needed to keep the antibody levels high.\nChronic overstimulation of the immune response can lead to immunosupression \nbut this is rare and very unlikely to occur in children.\n\n\nYes, chronic use of antibiotics can have an adverse effect on the good \nbacteria that are supposed to be present in and on the body.  Health effects \nof this depletion of the good bacteria is a very hotly debated topic in the \nmedical community with most physicians seeming to discount any health effects \nof chronic antibiotic use( a view that I do not support).\n \n\nChronic infection in an adult or a child needs to be worked up( in my \nopinion).  But most physicians feel that chronic infection in a child is \nnormal because of both exposure and lack of prior immunity to many \ninfectious diseases.  I do not share this view and there are some \nphysicians who also suspect that diet plays a big role in infection \nfrequency and severity.  Exposure to an infectious agent does not have to \nresult in a severe infection.  A strong immune response can minimize the \nlength of time needed to deal with the infection as well as the symptoms \nassociated with the infection.\n\n\nThere are five major nutrients that are responsible for a good strong \nimmune response to infectious agents.  They are: protein, vitamin C, \nvitamin A, iron and zinc.  The American diet is not low in protein so this \nis rarely a problem.  But vitamin A, vitamin C, iron and zinc are often low \nand this lack of an adequate pool(nutrient reserve) can impair the immune \nresponse.  Iron is know to be low in most kids(as is vitamin A).  There are \ndistinct biochemical tests that can be run to check the status of each of \nthese nutrients in a patient who is having a problem with chronic severe \ninfection.  Serum ferritin for iron status, dark adaptation for vitamin A \nstatus, red blood cell zinc for zinc status and leckocyte ascorbate for \nvitamin C status.  I have attempted to work up posts on these five \nnutrients and their role in infection for this news group as well as the \nothers that I participate in.  I can e-mail you what I've worked up so far.\nBut my best advice to you is to try to find a physician who recognizes the \ncritical role that diet plays in the human immune response.  You may also \nbe able to get help from a nutritionist.  Anyone can call themselves a \nnutritionist so you have to be very carefull.  You want to find someone(\nlike myself) who has had some formal training and education in nutrition.\nMany Ph.D. programs in the U.S. now offer degrees in Nutrition and that's \nwhat you need to look for.  Some dieticians will also call themselves \nnutritionists but most dieticians have not had the biochemical training \nneeded to run specialized nutritional assessment tests.  They are very good \nfor getting general dietary advice from however.

These are MY last words on the subject\n\n\n\n\nSome people think it enhances the flavor.  I personally don't think it\nhelps the taste, it makes me sick, so I try to avoid it.\n\n\n\nWell, I know that MSG effects ME adversely - maybe not permanently but\nat least temporarily enough that I like to try to avoid the stuff.\n\n\n\nEXCUSE ME!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nWhy can't people learn to cook from scratch *ON* the net.  I've gotten\nLOTS of recipes off the net that don't use additives.\n\nIf you LIKE additives then get off the net and go to your local\nsupermarket, buy lots of packaged foods, and YOU get OFF THE NET!!\n\n\nI don't!!\n\n\nHEY - I'll pay *MY* hard earned dollars to buy food that costs more\nbut does NOT have preservatives.  I choose to speak with my pocketbook\nin many ways.\n\n\n\nNacho cheese Doritos, breading for MANY frozen fried foods (like fish\nand chicken), etc. ad naseum.\n\n\nOr the "and other natural flavorings syndrome."  It's been a few years\nsince I've bought anything labelled with "and other natural\nflavorings".  \n\n\n\nWell, I had had similar reactions many times.  That was when I really\nstarted WATCHING CAREFULLY - reaction to Doritos - hey guess what's in\nthere - reaction to Lawry's season salt - guess what's in THERE\n\nI'll give you a hint - I've had enough problems with MANY MANY MANY\ndifferent products with MSG that I figured out one thing.\n\nUNLESS I plan on getting sick - I won't eat the stuff without my\nSeldane.  And did I ever learn to read labels.\n\n\nWhich was why I started checking EVERY time I got sick.  And EVERY\ntime I got sick MSG was somehow involved in one of the food products.\nAnd consider there were no other similar ingredients (to my knowledge)\n- it might not please a medical researcher - but it pleased my own\npersonal physician enough for him to give me allergy medicine and MOST\nIMPORTANTLY it's enough proof for ME to avoid it (and enough proof\nthat my INCREDIBLY frugal fiance didn't flinch when I literally threw\nout or gave away all the food products in his pantry that had msg -\nand he always flinches when there's waste - but it was a simple\nexplanation - I won't eat this stuff, I WON'T cook with this stuff, so\nI can either throw it out or give it away.)\n\n\n\nProbably Lawry's seasoning salt.  I LOVE the way that tastes.  \n\nI'm not saying I NEVER consume ANYTHING with MSG.

How many\npeople would have to be tested that would have a problem?  Also - I\nKNOW I have a problem with it, and I wouldn't VOLUNTEER for a test.\nLike thanks guys but I don't WANT to get sick.  Also - I'm sure that\nmost people probably have varying degrees of sensitivities at\ndifferent times.  If I have a cold I'm MUCH more susceptible to the\nreaction than when I'm healthy (as proven today - when I'm stuffy but\nfor some silly reason I still gave in and decided to have the BBQ\nchips ;}).\n\n\n\nCathy doesn't - I haven't saved all my postings but I NEVER called it\n"chinese restaurant syndrome" and I NEVER stated I got it only from\nChinese food.  I just thought it would be easiest to conduct my\npersonal test at a Chinese take out place that I knew would hold (or\nnot hold) the MSG.  I can't call up whoever makes Doritos and ask them\nto make me ONE back of chips without MSG.\n\n\nWell, I believe I mentioned that in an earlier post \n\nLet's see you wrote this message at\n\nDate: 20 Apr 1993 00:09:31 -0500\n\nbut on \n\nDate: 19 Apr 1993 16:33:18 GMT\n\n\n\n\nOH - and just in case anyone thinks I'm prejudice against either\nChinese food or Asian people - I'm not going home to cook some Chinese\nfood for the guy I'm marrying next week.

I've sent Gordon R. my posts on protein, vitamin C and vitamin A prior to \nposting on internet as a professional courtesy.  Somehow I've managed to \ndelete my vitamin A post from my text file.  Gordon R. had promised to send \nit back to me but he's pretty mad at me right now so I'll just retype it.\nSince digging through all my references is very time consuming(took me all \nday for that PMS post), I'm not going to cite any references(Gordon R. has \nthem).  I'm going to include some of the material from Weinsier and \nMorgan's new Nutrition textbook(which was not in my original material) to \npoint out that what I'm going to say has some support in the medical \ncommunity.\n\nDiet has been know to affect the immune system of man for a very, very long \ntime.  Protein has always had the biggest role in infection and I've \nalready covered the role of protein in protecting you against infection.\nNow I'm going to hit what I consider to be the most important nutrient in \nthe U.S. as far as infection is concerned(vitamin A).\n\nWhen vitamin A was originally discovered, it was commonly referred to as \nthe anti-infection vitamin.  Many people(Linus Pauling being one) have \ndecided to take this title away from vitamin A and give it to vitamin C\n(which I've already covered).  Big mistake(in my opinion).  Vitamin A is \nalso getting a reputation as an anti-cancer vitamin(with good reason).\nThe NCI currently has numerous clinical trials in progress to see if \nvitamin A can not only prevent cancer but cure it as well.  It's role in \nboth cancer and infection is almost identical(but not quite).\n\nVitamin A comes in two completely different forms(retinol and \nbeta-carotene).  Retinol is the animal form and it's toxic, beta-carotene \nis the plant form and it's completely nontoxic.  Both retinol and beta-\ncarotene display good absorption in the human gut if bile is present\n(60-80%).  The liver stores all of your retinol and doles it out for other \ntissues to use by synthesizing retinol binding protein(RBP).  A normal human \nadult liver should have 500,000IU to 1,000,000IU of retinol stored.  We \nare born with 10,000IU in our liver.  U.S. autopsy has shown that about \n30% of Americans die with the same(or less) amount of vitamin A as they \nwere born with.  If you don't believe that nutritional reserves(like that \nof retinol in the liver) are important, then this low vitamin A reserve is \nnot going to affect you.  But if you believe(like I do) that the nutrient \nreserves are important, then there is a problem with vitamin A in the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. RDA for vitamin A in an adult male is 1,000 RE or 5,000IU of \nvitamin A.  For adult feamles its 800 RE or 4,000IU of vitamin A.  Diet \nsurveys show that most Americans are getting this amount of vitamin A\n(either retinol or Beta-carotene) from their diet.  But the NRC(National \nResearch Council) was going to release a new RDA table in 1985 that had the \nRDA for both vitamin A and vitamin C raised(C to 90mg per day and A to \n7,500IU per day for adult males).  That report and it's recommendations was \nkilled.  Why? Concern over the increasing supplementation was the main \nreason.  RDAs are set to prevent clinical disease, not to keep nutrient \nreserves full.  Many scientist in the U.S. feel that the time has come to \nmove away from the prevention of clinical pathology concept and move \ntowards the promotion of optimum health concept, especially since we have \nsome very good data now that show that nutrient reserves are extremely \nimportant during periods of stress.  The nutritonal concervatives won that \nbattle and a new group of scientist were collected to come out with the \n1989 RDA list which lowered the RDA for several nutrients and moved the \ndietary guidelines back to where they were when we first started in the \n1940's(get enough to prevent clinical pathology, but not enough to fill \nthe reserves).\n\nWe know from autopsy that only about 10% of Americans have a liver with a \nnormal vitamin A reserve(500,000IU to 1,000,000IU).  I preach nutrient \nreserves to my students and tell them to measure them in their patients.\nBut for vitamin A, only a liver biopsy(or autopsy data) will tell you how \nmuch somebody has stored.  We can tell very easily if someone has \noverfilled his or her liver with vitamin A by measuring the serium retinol \nlevel(levels above 450ug/dl are highly suggestive that you have filled your \nliver with vitamin A and it's time to stop taking retinol).  The normal \nrange of serum retinol will be 20-100ug/dl.  Hypervitaminosis A is \ndiagnosed with a serum retinol level of 2,000ug/dl or higher(Interpretation \nof Diagnostic Test, Wallach, M.D., a Little Brown Series book).  This level \nof vitamin A in blood means that medical attention is necessary due to \nvitamin A toxicity.  Weinsier and Morgan take a much more conservative \napproach to vitamin A toxicity than does Wallach, as you will see later in \nthis post.  Between 450ug/dl and 2,000ug/dl you should have plenty \nof warning that it's time to eliminate the retinol from your diet(headache, \nredness of the skin, hair loss, joint pain).\n\nI tell all my students that will use vitamin A in their practice that they \nhad better monitor the serum retinol level and stop when there are clear \nsigns that the liver is full.  You will never really know if the patient \nneeds the vitamin A(because you can not measure the pool in liver) but you \nwill always know when it's time to stop(just like in those vitamin A for \nPMS studies).\n\nBeta-carotene can be taken to fill up your liver with retinol and you will \nnever have to worry about toxicity because the conversion of beta-carotene to \nretinol that occurs in both your gut and your liver will slow down(stops in the \nliver and slows down in the gut) when your liver is full of retinol.  But \ntaking Beta-carotene as the source of retinol takes a very long time to \nfill the liver up(I've seen estimates of 20-30 years) if you are in the 30% \nthat only has as much as you were born with in your liver(10,000IU).  One \nother problem with beta-carotene, if you have a zinc deficit, you will not \nconvert as much beta-carotene to retinol in the gut or the liver because the \nenxzyme that does this conversion requires zinc.  In addition, the release of \nretinol from the liver is a zinc dependent process so a zinc deficit will \ncause a vitamin A deficit even if your liver has plenty of vitamin A.\n\nNow what does vitamin A do in cancer and infection protection?  The body \nuses vitamin A(retinol) for many different things.  Vision(the first to be \nnailed down and where you see overt clinical pathology) uses the aldehyde\n(retinal) and alcohol(retinol) form of vitamin A.  Reproduction uses the \nretinol form  and some retinal.  Infection and cancer protection uses \nretinoic acid.  How do you convert retinol(which your white blood cells \nand the mucosal cells get from blood) to retinoic acid?  You use enzymes, \none of which requires vitamin C(this is why Pauling has tried to pull the \ntitle of anti-infection vitamin away from vitamin A).  Vitamin C does play \na role in infection(interferon production for example) but it's biggest role \nis the conversion of retinol to retinoic acid.  If you increase your intake \nof vitamin C, you will increase your formation of retinoic acid.  But \nretinoic acid can not be converted back to retinol(as retinal can) and once \nit's formed, it's used and then lost to the body.  This is why the 1985 NRC \ngroup wanted to increase both vitamin C and vitamin A RDA's.\n\nMost people taking large amounts of vitamin C really think that they are \nhelping themselves.  If they don't have much vitamin A in their liver and \nthey are not also increasing their intake of vitamin A, they actually do \nthemselves more harm than good.\n\nRetinoic acid functions in white blood cells to promote antibody formation.\nIn the mucus membrane, it is the main factor in promoting good mucus \nproduction and a good epithelial cell barrier to prevent infectious agents from \nentering the blood system.  The mucus membrane is referred to as the "first \nline" defense against infection.  For cancer, retinoic acid has been shown \nto act as a cell brake(it counteracts the effect of cell promoters which \nstimulate cells to divide).  Cancer has two distinct steps, DNA alteration \nand cell promotion.  For cells that normally divide all the time, promoters \nare not that important.  But for lung and breast tissue which does not \nnormally divide, promoters are real important in the malignant process.\nThis is the major reason why the NCI has so many different clinical trials \nin progress using retinol and/or beta-carotene.\n\nChronic infection(irritation) of the mucus membranes is a signal that \nvitamin A may not be adequate.  I tell my students that any patient who \nwalks into their office with a complaint of chronic infection has to be \nworked up for vitamin A(along with the other factors that medicine already \nhas on it's list of causes for chronic infection).  I drive this home in my \ncourse at the Osteopathic College in Tulsa, when I teach at the allopathic \nmedical school in Tulsa(OU's branch campus) and when I give CME lectures.\n\nDark adaptation is the best clinical test for vitamin A status since night \nvision is impacted when liver reverves drop to 50,000IU of retinol.  The \nserum level of retinol can also be used, but it does not drop until liver \nreserves drop below 10,000 to 20,000IU.  Asking a patient if they have \ntrouble seeing at night is a good initial screen(if cataracts are ruled \nout).  In one study done on U.S. Spanish-Americans where serum retinol levels \nwere measured, 25% of the sample population had a serum retinol level below \n20ug/dl.\n\nAs more studies are done on serum retinol levels in population groups of \nthe U.S. that have had a history of high infection rates, we will probably \nsee a much stonger correlation between infection incidence rates and low \nserum retinol levels.\n\nWhat do Weinsier and Morgan have to say about vitamin A?  Here are excerpts\nfrom their book:\n\nVitamin A functions in vision in the forrm of retinol, it is necessay for \ngrowth and differentation of epithelial tissue, and is required for \nreproduction, embryonic development, and bone growth.  Protein-calorie \nmalnutrition and zinc deficiency may impair the absorption, transport, and \nmetabolism of vitamin A.  Retinaldehyde is converted to retinoic acid, \nwhich has biological activity in growth and in cell diferentiation but not \nin reproduction or vision.  The most common procedure to evaluate vitamin A \nstatus is to measure the retinol level in plasma or serum.  The normal \nrange for vitamin A content for a child is 20 to 90ug/dl.  Lower values are \nindicators of deficiency or depleted body stores.  Serum levels greater \nthan 100ug/dl are indicative of toxic levels of vitamin A.  Dark adaptation \ntests and electroretinogram measurements are also useful but difficult to \nperform on young children.  Rapidly proliferating tissues are sensitive to \nvitamin A deficiency and may revert to an undifferentiated state.  The \nbronchorespiratory tract, skin, genitourinary system, gastrointestinal \ntract and sweat glands are adversely affected.  A daily intake of more than \n7.5mg(about 37,000IU) of retinol is not advised and chronic use of amounts \nover 20mg(100,000IU) can result in a dry and itching skin, desquamation, \nerythematous dermatitis, hair loss, joint pain, chapped lips, hyperostois\n(bony depositis), headaches, anorexia, edema and fatigue.  \n\nThey recommend 30mg of retinol via IM injection in children for vitamin A \ndeficiency but do not discuss treatment for adults.  Their toxic serum retinol \nlevel is very conservative.  I recommend that my students try 25,000IU in \nadults that are having problems with chronic infection.  They have to rule \nout a zinc deficit first by getting an RBC zinc run(or if their clinical \nlab can't run it, I tell them to do what Weinsier and Morgan suggest, give \nthem the zinc along with the vitamin A.  At 25,000IU per day, toxicity \nshould not be a problem and you will not have to worry about pulling the \npatient into the office on a regular basis to run a serum retinol.\n\nBoth Elaine and Jon found doctors who used a much higher dose of vitamin A.\nRecall that the PMS papers were using 100,000IU to 200,000IU of vitamin A.\nI don't suggest that my students use these high doses.  If you wanted to \nfill the liver up fast(as part of a clinical trial) and were monitoring the \nserum retinol level, then you would be okay.  But my knowledge of the \nvitamin A literature suggests to me that 25,000IU for patients with a \ndemonstrated vitamin A deficit(dark adapatation test or serum retinol) will \nprovide a good and steady improvement(as long as zinc and vitamin C status \nare good) without having to worry about toxicity.  If they want to get more \nagressive, fine if they follow my advise to check the serum retinol.  But \nvitamin A(retinol) should never be given in high dose to women who could \nbecome pregnant since vitamin A shows teratogenicity towards the human \nfetus.  The dose needed to show this effect on the developing fetus is \n18,000IU of retinol per day.  Beta-carotene will never have this effect on \nthe human fetus.\n\nCould just taking Beta-carotene instead of retinol supplements help?  Yes \nbut the effect will take a long time to develop.  My advise is to use \nretinol to fill the liver up and then switch to beta-carotene to keep it \nfull.  Vitamin A is probably one nutrient that is better off left to \nprescription by doctors.  But when we have the M.D.'s in this newsgroup \njumping all over me and other doctors that propose the use of vitamin A \nsupplements for treating patients with chronic sinus and GI distress, I \nthink that the most prudent option is to keep vitamin A in the OTC market \nbut require manufactors to provide package inserts to educate the general \npublic about the dangers of vitamin A supplementation.
Claude, I've not heard or read anything that would suggest that vitamin A(\nretinol) could reverse hearing loss due to nerve damage(usually caused by \nhigh sound levels, but also occassionally due to severe infection).  The \ntypes of cells that vitamin A regulates are the general epithelial cells \nand these cell types are not the ones that function in the ear hearing \nprocess.  The hair cell nerve-like epithelial cells in the ear may respond \nto vitamin A during cellular differentiation(embryogenesis) but I don't \nknow if they are still capable of responding in adults.  If they are \ncapable of responding with new hair growth, this would be a very major \nbreakthrough in hearing loss.  With all of the medical interest in vitamin \nA, it would not be too surprising if a clinical study was done using \nvitamin A to reverse hearing loss.  But with only a news announcement to go \non(and this type of communication is notoriously bad), I can't comment on \nyour question anymore than I already have.  If one study has been done, \nmore will need to follow to firm up a link between vitamin A and hearing \nloss if there really is one.

There have been a few postings in the past on alleged pathological \n(esp. neurological) conditions induced by playing video games\n(e.g. Nintendo). Apparently, there have been reported several cases of\n"photosensitive epilepsy", due to the flashing of some\npatterns and the strong attention of the (young) players.\nOne poster to comp.risks reported some action from\nthe British Government.\n\nA quick search in a database reported the following two published\nreferences:\n\n1. E.J. Hart, Nintendo epilepsy, in New England J. of Med., 322(20), 1473\n2. TK Daneshmend et al., Dark Warrior epilepsy, BMJ 1982; 284:1751-2.\n\nI would appreciate if someone could post (or e-mail) \nany reference to (preferably published) further work on the subject.\nAny pointer to other information and/or to possible technical tools \n(if any) for reducing the risks are appreciated.\n\nMany thanks,

-*----\n\nI do not have enough medical expertise to have much of an opinion\none way or another on hidden candida infections.  I can\nunderstand the skepticism of those who see this associated with\nvarious general kinds of symptoms, while there is a lack of solid\ndemonstration that this happens and causes such general symptoms.\n(To understand this skepticism, one only needs to know of past\nfailures that shared these characteristics with the notion of\nhidden candida infection.  There have been quite a few, and the\nproponents of all thought that the skeptics were overly skeptical.)\n\nOn the other hand, I am happy to read that some people are\nsufficiently interested in this possibility, spurred by\nsuggestive clinical experience, to research it further.  The\ndoubters may be surprised.  (It has happened before.)\n\nI realize that admitting ignorance in the face of ignorance may\nnot endear me to those who are so sure they know one way or\nanother.  (And, indeed, perhaps some of them do know -- I am the\none who is currently ignorant.)  But I find this the most honest\nroute, and so I am happy with it.

My opinion(for what it's worth) is that 40 x-rays is *way* too many.  \nGuidleines have been set on the number of dental x-rays and chest x-rays \nthat one should have over a given period of time because of all the \nenvironmental factors that can cause cancer in humans, ionizing radiation \nis one of the most potent(splits DNA and causes hydroxyl free radical \nformation in tissue cells).  Ultasound(like that used in seeing the fetus \nin the uterus) has been shown to be extremely good at picking up tumors \nin the prostate and gallstones in the gallbladder.  But kidney tissue may \nbe too dense for ultrasound to work for kidney stones(any radiologists care \nto comment?).\n\nMost stones will pass(but it's a very painful process).  Unlike gallstones, \nI don't think that there are many drugs that can help "dissolve" the \nkidney stone(which is probably calcium-oxalate).  Vitamin C and magnesium \nhave worked in rabbits to remove calcium from calcified plaques in the \naterial wall.  I have no idea if a diet change or supplementation could \nspeed up the process of kidney stone passage(but I'm pretty confident that \na diet change and/or supplementation can prevent a reoccurance).  If surgery \nis being contemplated, the stone must be in the kidney tubule.  A second \nopinion is a good idea because there are better(less damaging) ways to break \nup the stone if it's logged within the kidney(sonic blasts).  HMO's are \nnotorious for conservative care and long waits for expensvie treatments.  \nMy condolences to your friend.
=Which was why I started checking EVERY time I got sick.  And EVERY\n=time I got sick MSG was somehow involved in one of the food products.\n\nWhich points up the "studies" made by amateurs:  Did you ALSO check EVERY TIME\nYOU DID *NOT* get sick?  "No," you say?  Why not check every thing you eat when\nyou don't get sick and find out how much MSG you're actually consuming?\n\n=> All that's needed now is that final step, a double-blind study done\n=> on humans.  There isn't even an ethical question about "possible\n=> harm", as this is a widely used and approved food additive.\n=\n=But - some say that only 2% of the population has a problem with MSG -\n=some say it's more like 20% - but let's say that it's 5%.  How many\n=people would have to be tested that would have a problem?  Also - I\n=KNOW I have a problem with it, and I wouldn't VOLUNTEER for a test.\n\nIf you knew enough about what the test was about to decide that you didn't want\nto participate because it involved MSG, you'd've already made yourself\nineligible (since MSG IS detectable by taste). How can anybody be so clueless\nas to what double blind studies are all about?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCarl J Lydick | INTERnet: CARL@SOL1.GPS.CALTECH.EDU | NSI/HEPnet: SOL1::CARL
I don't have any evidence against water from Lourdes curing MS --\nI'm sure there is anecdotal evidence that it does.  Do you really think\nthat in the absence of a double-blind study I should be indifferent\nto the hypothesis that water from Lourdes cures MS?\n\nFor what it's worth, I know of only one double blind study of Nystatin\nfor "candida hypersensitivity syndrome."  It was published in the \nNew England Journal (I think 1990) and showed no benefit on systemic\nsymptoms (though I think it reduced vaginal yeast infections, not\nsurprisingly).  As I recall, the yeast crowd had some major objections\nto the study, though I don't remember what they were.
The principle underlying these devices is a well establish principle in\npsychology called 'entrainment,' whereby external sensory stimuli\ninfluence gross electrical patterns of brain function.\n\nThey are 'experimental' in that people experiment with them and they\nare _not_ widely (if at all) used in medicine for therapeutic purposes.  \nGiven the exception of TENS and similar units used for external electrical \nstimulation, usually for pain relief, not really a light and sound machine.\n\nThey are _not_ experimental in the sense of a specific medical \ncategory to that effect, as with experimental drugs, as the FDA does not \nspecifically regulate medical devices in the way it does pharmaceuticals.   \n\n\nThere are few reliable studies of therapeutic or enhancement effects\nfor mind machines, other than those relaxation-related effects found with \nmeditation or self-hypnosis as well.  Reported benefits are mostly anecdotal and\nsubjective so far, so it's hard to generalize about their potential value.\n\nA pretty good general non-technical introduction to a wide variety\nof these devices may be found in "Would the Buddha Wear a Walkman ?"\nSome interesting background material, names of suppliers, and capsule reviews\nof specific equipment.  \n\n\nA more important question might be whether they have enough additional\nvalue to be worth investing in.  'Biofeedback' was found to be a legitimate\nand reliable effect experimentally under certain conditions, (in that\nit demonstrated that we can influence physiological processes previously \nconsidered purely autonomic) but never panned out as a particularly valuable \ntherapeutic tool because of the skill level required and the subtlety and\ntemporary nature of the effects in most cases.   Maybe someone else \nhas more, there used to be a whole mailing list devoted to mind machines,\nsomewhere on the net.\n\n\n						kind regards,
But no one (or at least, not many people) are trying to pass off God\nas a scientific fact.  Not so with Kirlian photography.

Re: serious discussion about drugs vs. "Where can I get a good bong, man?"
Our 20-month son has started falling sick quite often every since he\nstarted going to day care.  He was at home for the first year and he did\nnot fall sick even once.  Now it seems like he has some sort of cold or\nflu pretty much once a month.  Most of the time the cold leads to an ear\ninfection as well, with the result that he ends up being on antibiotics\n3 weeks out of 4.  I know kids in day care fall sick more often, but we\nare beginning to wonder how often "more often" really is, whether our\nson is more susceptible or has lower immunity than average, what the\nlonger-term effects of constantly being sick and taking antibiotics are,\nand what we can do to build up his resistance.  He really enjoys his day\ncare and we think it's great too, but we are beginning to wonder whether\nwe should think about getting a nanny.\n\nAre there any studies that can help answer some of these questions?\n\n-- How often do kids in their first, second and third years fall sick?\nHow often do they get colds, flus, ear infections?  Is there any data on\nhome care vs. day care?\n\n-- Does being sick "build immunity" (leading to less illness later),\ndoes it make kids "weaker" (leading to more illness later), or does it\nnot have any long term effect?\n\n-- Does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long\nterm effects?\n\n-- How does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than\nnormal, and what does one do about it?\n\n-- Is there any way to build immunity and resistance?\n\nAny data, information or advice relating to this would be much\nappreciated.  Thanks a lot.
Perhaps the listlessness caused by thyroid deficiency could mimic\ndepression, or feeling unable to do anything could cause one to get\ndepressed, but I know of no specific effect on the brain caused by the\nthyroid that would cause depression. Note that weight gain is usually\na symptom of both. Simple blood tests would indicate if a thyroid\ncondition is present.\n\nI don't know if depression would cause a reduction in thyroid output,\nbut I would tend to doubt it. As far as I know clinical depression is\ncaused by a chemical imbalance in the brain, and that chemical\nimbalance has no direct effect on any other part of the body. A regular\neveryday depression IMHO should not cause a chemical imbalance in the\nbody at all.\n\nThe pituitary bases its secretions of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)\non the level of circulating Thyroxin (there are two types T3 and T4 -\none is used as a reserve and is changed into the other -active- form in\nthe liver). The ratio of T3 & T4 can be affected by a number of other\nhormones (estrogen, for example). Naturally, changing activity of the\nbody's cells would cause changes in availabilty of free thyroxin, but\nthe liver and a healthy thyroid should be able to balance things out in\nshort order.\n\nGood sources for info on the thyroid are the Merk Manual (a physician's\nreference book ) although reading it is enough to get one depressed :-)\nand the Encyclopedia Brittanica (should be available in your local\nlibrary).\n\nI hope this has been of some help.
I have osteoarthritis, and my huband has just been diagnosed with diabetes\n(type II, I guess--no insulin). \n\n\nI've been trying to read up on these two conditions, and what really\nsurprises me is how few experiments have been done and how little is known. \nLosing weight appears to be imperative for diabetes and advisable for\narthritis (at least, for -women- with arthritis), but, of course, the very\nconditions that make weight loss advisable are part of the reason for the\nweight gain. \n\nFor myself, I'm almost afraid to lose weight, because no matter how gentle\nand sensible a diet I use (the last one was 1800-2000 calories, in about\neight small meals), the weight won't go off gradually and stay off. \nInstead, it drops off precipitously, and then comes back on with much\ninterest, like bread on the waters.\n\n\nWith this experience, it's hard to be encouraging to my husband.  All I can\nsuggest is to make it as gradual as possible.\n\nMeanwhile, some experts recommend no sugar, others, no fat, others, just a\nbalanced diet.  It's almost impossible to tell from their writings -which-\nparts of their recommendations are supposed to help the condition, and\nwhich are merely ideas the expert thinks are nifty.\n\nIs it my imagination, or are these very old conditions very poorly\nunderstood?  Is it just that I'm used to pediatrician-talk ("It's strep;\ngive him this and he'll get well.") and so my expectations are too high?
Any opinions on Burzynski's antineoplastons or information about the current \n   status of his research would be appreciated.\n\nBurzynski's work is not too promising. None of his A-1 through A-5\nantineoplastons have been shown to have antineoplastic effects against\nexperimental cancer. The NCI conducted tests of A-2 and A-5 against\nleukemia in mice, with the result that doses high enough to produce\ntoxic effects in the mice were not effective in inhibiting the growth\nof the tumor or killing it. (These were in 1983 and 1985)\n\nBurzynski claims that A-10 is the active factor common to all of A-1\nand A-5 (something which he has not shown, A-10 has only been\nextracted from A-2. He also hasn't shown that A-1 through A-5 are actually\ndistinct substances). The NCI conducted a series of tests using A-10\nagainst a standard panel of tumors that included different cell lines\nfrom tumors in the following classes: leukemia, non-small-cell and\nsmall-cell lung cancer, colon cancer, cancer of the central nervous\nsystem, melanoma, ovarian cancer and renal cancer. A-10 exhibited\nneither growth inhibition nor cytotoxicity at the dose levels tested.\n\nIt is necessary to process A-10 since it is not soluble (Burzynski's\ntheory requires soluble agents), but this basically hydrolizes it to\nPAG (which he calls AS 2.5). PAG is not an information carrying\npeptide, something which Byrzynski claims is necessary for\nantineoplastic activity. AS 2.1 (also derived from A-10) is a 4:1\nmixture of PA and PAG. PA (also not a peptide) can be purchased at a\nchemical supply houses for about $0.09 a gram. A-10 is chemically\nextremely similar to glutithamide and thalidomide, both of which are\nhabit forming and can cause peripheral neuropathy. The nasty effects\nof thalidomide are widely known. In spite of this similarity, A-10\ndoes not appear to have been tested for it's potential to induce\nteratogenicity or peripheral neuropathy.\n\nMany of Burzynski's statements about the origin of his theory, early\nresearch, past and present support by others for his work have been\nshown to be untrue.\n\n\nsdb
Money probably has a lot to do with keeping the practice of routine \ncircumcision alive... It's another opporitunity to charge a few hundred\nextra bucks for a completely unnecessary procedure, the rationale for \nwhich until recently has been accepted without question by most\nparents of newborns.  \n\nOne could also imagine that complications arising from circumcision\n(infections, sloppy jobs, etc) are far more common than the remote chance\nof penile cancer it is purported to prevent.

My brother's affine has recently been diagnosed with Sweet's\nsyndrome. Also called steroid resistant Sweet's syndrome.\n\n	This syndrome started after she had had Iodine 131 treatment for\nhyperthyroidism. She'd been reluctant to have treatment for the\nhyperthyroidism for many years and apparently started to show exaustion\nfrom it. \n\n	I understand that she may still be testing high in thyroid level\nbut she's isn't being treated by an endocrinologist. Her previous\nendocrinologist bowed out when she entered the hospital. She entered the\nhospital because of the Sweet's syndrome symptoms (skin lesions).\n\nI've looked through the last two years of Medline and didn't find an\nabstract mentioning a correlation between thyroid and Sweets. . \n\nI checked a handbook which said that Sweet's was associated with leukemia.\n\nI'd like a reccomndation for experts who are in New York City or who travel\nto New York City. For the sweets and perhaps for the endocrinology.\n\nAny information that might help. Apparently there hasn't been much\nimprovement in her condition over the past several months.
How about going to a doctor to get some minor surgery done. Doctor\nrefuses to do it because it's ``to risky'' (still charges me $50!).\nI go home and do it myself. No problem.\n\nThe ``surgery'' involved digging out a pine needle that had buried\nitself under my tongue.

Last year, I was totally surprised when my annual physical disclosed an\ninguinal hernia.  I couldn't remember doing anything that would have\ncaused it.  That is, I hadn't been lifting more than other people do,\nand in fact probably somewhat less.  Eventually the thing became more\npainful and I had the repair operation.\n\nThis year I developed a pain on the other side.  This turned out to be\nanother inguinal hernia.  So I go back to the hospital Monday for\nanother fun 8-) operation.\n\nI don't know of anything I'm doing to cause this to happen.  I'm 38\nyears old and I don't think I'm old enough for things to start falling\napart like this.  The surgeon who is doing the operation seems to\nsuspect a congenital weakness, but if so, why did it suddenly appear\nwhen I was 37 and not really as active as I was when I was younger?\n\nDoes anyone know how to prevent a hernia, other than not lifting\nanything?  It's rare that I lift more than my 16-month-old or a sack\nfull of groceries, and you may have noticed that your typical grocery\nsack is fairly small these days.  Is there some sort of exercise that\nwill reduce the risk?\n\nOf course, my wife thinks it's from sitting for long periods of time at\nthe computer, reading news...
Your hearing curve sounds a lot like mine (thanks, Uncle Sam!).  I've been\nwearing Miracle Ear canal aids for about 5 months now and I find them to be\nacceptable.  They are molded to the shape of your ear canal, and tuned to \nyour hearing curve.  They are comfortable to wear and almost invisible, if\nyou're worried about that (although if you're currently wearing behind the\near models, that's not an issue).  The cost:  I paid $1200 each for mine,\nthrough the Miracle Ear counter at Sears.  I've heard that there is a\nsubstantial discount for senior citizens, but I haven't researched that, because\nI'm not a senior citizen, yet!\n\nGive them a try; you might be pleasantly surprised!
Julie, it doesn't necessarily follow that you should use it (MSG or\nsomething else for that matter) simply because you are not allergic\nto it. For example you might not be allergic to (animal) fats, and\nlike their taste, yet it doesn't follow that you should be using them\n(regularly). MSG might have other bad (or good, I am not up on \nknowledge of MSG) effects on your body in the long run, maybe that's\nreason enough not to use it. \n\nAltho' your example of the ulcer is funny, it isn't an\nappropriate comparison at all.
Chronic persistent hepatitis is usually diagnosed when someone does a liver\nbiopsy on a patient that has persistently elevated serum transaminases months\nafter a bout of acute viral hepatitis, or when someone is found to have\npersistently elevated transaminases on routine screening tests. The degree of\nelevation (in the serum transaminases) can be trivial, or as much as ten times\nnormal. Other blood chemistries are usually normal. \nAs a rule, patients with CPH have no clinical signs of liver disease. \nChronic active hepatitis can also be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, at\nleast initially, and that's why it's important to tell them apart by means of\na biopsy. The patient with CPH only needs to be reassured. The patient with\nCAH needs to be treated.\n\n======================================

Sounds pretty familiar.  I posted similar cries about last September when\nCaroline just entered daycare.  She was two, then, and have been with \ncontinuous colds since until last March.  As spring approaches, her colds\nslowed down.  Meanwhile we grew more and more relaxed about her colds.\nOnly once did the doctor diagnosed an ear infection and only twice she\nhad antibiotics.  (The other time was due to sinus infection, and I wished\nthat I did not give her that awful Septra.) \n\n\nThere are the 'net studies' -- that is, if you read this newsgroup often,\nthere will be a round of questions like this every month.  There might\nbe formal studies like that, but bear with my not so academic experience.\nOkay?\n\nGee, I bet 50/50 you'll hear cases in all these catagories.\n\n\nI am pretty sure, an insulated child at home sicks less.  But, that child \nstill will face the world one day. \n\n\nThat's what I believe and comfort myself with.  Caroline will get more\nand more colds for sure before she learned not to stick her hand in other \nkid's mouth nor let other kids do the same.  Cold virus mutate easily.\nHowever, I hope that her immune system will be stronger to fight these\ndiseases, so she would be less severely affected.  Everytime she has a cold,\nwe make sure she blow her nose frequently and give her Dorcol or Dimetapp \nat night so she can have good rest (thanks to some suggestions from the net).\nThat's about all the care she needs from us.  I try very hard to keep her\noff antibiotics.  Twice her ped. gave me choice to decide whether she would\nhave antibiotics.  I waited just long enough (3-4 days) to see that she\nfought the illness off.  I do understand that you don't have much choice if\nthe child is in pain and/or high fever. \n\n\nIf the child doesn't rely on antibiotics to fight off the sickness everytime,\nthen the child should be stronger.\n\nI'll leave this to expert.\n\nIf your child just entered daycare, I'm pretty sure the first 6 months will be\nthe hardest.  (Then, you get more used to it.  Boy, do I hate to see me typing\nthis sentence.  I recall when I read something like this last September, I said \nto myself, 'oh, sure.'  But, I do get used to it, now.)  However, I do hear \npeople say that it does get better after a year or two.  I am looking forward \nto a healthier next winter.  As it gets warmer, I hope you do get some break \nsoon.\n\nEat well, sleep well.  Try not to use antibiotics if not absolutely necessary.\n\nGood luck.\n\nWen-lin

The burden of proof rests upon those who claim the existence\nof this "syndrome".  To date, these claims are unsubstantiated\nby any available data.  Hopefully, as a scientist, you would\ntake issue with anyone overstating their conclusions based\nupon their data.\n\nGee, I have many interesting and enlightening anecdotes about\nmyself, my friends, and my family, but in the practice of\nmedicine I expect and demand more rigorous rationales for\nbasing therapy than "Aunt Susie's brother-in-law ...".\n\nAnecdotal evidence may provide inspiration for a hypothesis,\nbut rarely proves anything in a positive sense.  And unlike\nmathematics, boolean logic rarely applies directly to medical\nissues, and so evidence of 'exceptions' does not usually\ndisprove but rather modifies current concepts of disease.\n\nI would characterize it not as 'abject disbelief' but rather \n'scientific outrage over vastly overstated conclusions'.\n\nI have no problem with such an approach; but this is NOT what\nis happening in the 'trenches' of this diagnosis.
One of the responsibilities of a licensed physician is to read the medical \nliterature to keep up with changes in medical practice.  All the clamor \nover laetril resulted in the NCI spending quite a bit of money on clinical \ntrials which proved(to me anyway) that laetril was ineffective against \ncancer.  A physician who continued to use it, when better, more effective, \ntreatments are available, may deserve to be called a quack.  Anti-fungals \nare in a different class.  The big question seems to be is it reasonable to \nuse them in patients with GI distress or sinus problems that *could* be due \nto candida blooms following the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics?  Gorden \nRubenfeld, through e-mail, has assured me that most physicians recognize \nthe chance of candida blooms occuring after broad-spectrum antibiotic use \nand they therefore reinnoculate their patients with *good* bacteria to \nrestore competetion for candida in the body.  I do not believe that this is \nyet a standard part of medical practice.  He deals with critical care \npatients where fungal infection(systemic) is a real problem and just \nbecause he tries to keep *good* bacteria in his patients does not mean that \nall physicians do this.  I think that aspergillis is more likely to be \nfound in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida.  Women have been known \nfor a very long time to suffer from candida blooms in the vagina and a \nwomen is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause and \nnot give give her advise to use the OTC anti-fungal creams.  Since candida \ncolonizes primarily in the ano-rectal area, GI symptoms should be more common \nthan vaginal problems after broad-spectrum antibiotic use.\n\nThe problem we have here David is proof that GI discomfort can be caused by \na candida bloom.  The arguement is that without proof, no action is \nwarrented.\n\nMedicine has not, and probalby never will be, practiced this way.  There \nhas always been the use of conventional wisdom.  A very good example is \nkidney stones.  Conventional wisdom(because clinical trails have not been \ndone to come up with an effective prevention), was that restricitng the \nintake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones \nfrom forming.  Clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to \nbreakdown the stone once it formed.  Through the recent New England J of \nMedicine article, we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong, \nincreasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is \nrestricting calcium intake.\n\nThe conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to \nbe reinnoculated with *good* bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy.\nIf it makes sense for livestock, why doesn't it make sense for humans \nDavid?  We are not talking about a dangerous treatment(unless you consider \nyogurt dangerous).  If this were a standard part of medical practice, as \nGordon R. says it is, then the incidence of GI distress and vaginal yeast \ninfections should decline.
That is the standard advice in dermatology texts.\nThe soak part greatly increases the inconvenience.  Don't bother unless\nit doesn't work otherwise.\n\n\nExactly, but it adds to the "ritual" aspect, which is important for\nus suggestible patients.  (Posters, don't bother to repeat the \nrationale for the soak.)\n\n\nGreasy no matter what. Vaseline (generically, petrolatum) is \nfamous for that.  One text states that the more greasy a dry-skin\ncream is, the more effective.  \n\n\nTry USP lanolin, at least for maintenance (preventive) therapy.  USP\nlanolin is natural and much less greasy AND cheap (don't buy the more\nexpensive perfumed lanolin mixture).  As I've commented before, petrolatum\nis a poorly characterized mixture of hydrocarbons which are not found in\nbiological systems (that is not inherently bad, but smell it up close,\neven on your hand), are partially absorbed into the body and remain there\nfor months or more, and have associations with cancer.  Don't panic, but\nalso don't believe it's God's gift to the human skin.
I was just wondering if exercises specific to particular regions of the\nbody (such as thighs) will basically only tone the thighs, or if fat\nfrom other parts of the body (such as breasts) would be affected just as\nmuch.
This question came up in Sci. Med. Nutrition and I'm posting my answer \nhere.  Only 22 medical schools in the U.S. teach courses on human \nnutrition.  We have already seen what a lack of nutrition education can do \nwhen candida and kidney stones present themselves to the medical community.\nI think that the best example of where U.S. medicine is really missing the \nmark when it comes to a knowledge of nutrition is PMS.  So many women(and \ntheir husbands) suffer from this disorder that it is really criminal that \nmost physicians in the U.S. are not taught that PMS is primarily caused by \ndiet and diet changes can prevent it from ever happpening.  Before shooting \nyour flames, read the entire article and then decide if flaming is \njustified.\n\nFrom A Poster In Sci. Medi. Nutrition:\nside-tracked with candida.  PMS is a lot like Candida blooms, most \nphysicians don't recognize it as a specific "disease" entity.  Here is \neverything that you would ever want to know about PMS.\n\nPremenstrual syndrome has been divided into four specific subgroups:\n\n	PMT-A(Anxiety)		PMT-D(depression)\n	anxiety			depression\n	irritability		forgetfulness\n	insomnia		confusion\n	depression		lethargy\n\n	PMT-C(Craving)		PMT-H(Hyperhydration)\n	craving for sweets	weight gain\n	increased appetite	breast congestion and tenderness\n	sugar ingestion causes: abdominal bloating and tenderness\n	 1. headache		edema of the face and extremities\n	 2. palpitations\n	 3. fatigue or fainting\n \nPMT-A is characterized by elevated blood estrogen levels and low \nprogesterone levels during the luteal phase of a women's cycle.\n\nPMT-C is caused by the ingestion of large amounts of refined simple \ncarbohydrates.  During the luteal phase of a women's cycle, there is \nincreased glucose tolerance with a flat glucose curve after oral glucose \nchallenge.  The metabolic findings believed to be responsible for PMT-C are \na low magnesium and a low prostaglandin E1.  This condition of hypoglycemia \nis not unique to PMS but there are a number of different causes of \nhypoglycemia, magnesium and PGE1 seem to be specific to PMS hypoglycemia.\n	A. Am. J. Psychiatry 147(4):477-80(1990).\nUnrefined complex carbohydrate should be substituted for sugar, magnesium \nsupplementation and alpha linoleic acid supplementation(increased to 5-6% of \nthe total calories) using safflower oil or evening primrose oil as sources \nof alpha linoleic acid.\n\nPMT-D is characterized by elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal \nphase of a women's cycle.  Another cause of PMT-D has been found to be lead \ntoxicity(in women without elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal \nphase). "Effect of metal ions on the binding of estridol to human \nendometrial cystol" Fertil. Steril. 28:312-18(1972).\n\nPMT-H is associated with water and salt retention along with an elevated \nserum aldosterone level.  Salt restriction, B6, magnesium and vitamin E \nfor breast tenderness have all been effective in treating PMT-H\n\nThis general discussion of the PMS syndromes came form:\n\n	A. "Management of the premenstrual tension sundromes: Rational for \n	    a nutritional approach". 1986, A Year in Nutritional Medicine. \n	    J. Bland, Ed. Keats, Publishing, 1986.\n\n	B. "Nutritional factors in the etiology of premenstrual tension \n	    syndromes", J. Reprod. Med.28(7):446-64(1983).\n\n	C. "Premenstrual tension", Prob. Obstet. Gynecol. 3(12):1-39(1980)\n\nTreatment has traditionally involved progesterone administration if you can \nfind a doctor who will treat you for PMS(just about as hard as finding one \nthat will treat you for candida blooms).  While progesterone will work, \nsupplementation with vitamins and minerals works even better.  There really \nhas been an awful lot of research done on PMS(much more than candida \nblooms).  Many of these studies have been what are called experimental \ncontrolled studies(the type of rigorous clinical studies that doctors like to \nsee done).\n\nHere are a few of these studies:\n\n	CARBOHYDRATE: Experimental Controlled Study, "Effect of a low-fat, \n	high-carbohydrate diet on symptoms of cyclical mastopathy" Lancet \n	2:128-32(1988).  21 pts with severe persistent cyclical mastopathy \n	of at least 5 years duration were randomly selected to receive \n	specific training to reduce dietary fat to 15% of total calories \n	and increase complex carbohydrate ingestion or given general dietary \n	advise with no training.  After 6 months, there was a significant \n	reduction in the severity of the breast swelling and tenderness in \n	the trained group as reported by self-reported symptoms as well as \n	physical exams which quantitated the degree of breast swelling, \n	tenderness and nodularity.\n\n	VITAMIN A: Experimental Controlled Study, "The use of Vitamin A in \n	premenstrual tension" Acta Obstet. Gynecol Scand. 39:586-92(1960).  \n	218 pts with severe recurring PMS received 200,000 to 300,000IU \n	vitamin A daily or a placebo.  Serum retinol levels were monitored \n	and high dose supplementation was discontinued when evidence of \n	toxicity occured(serum retinol above 450ug/ml).  The intent of the \n	study was to load the liver up with vitamin A and get a normal pool \n	size(500,000IU to 1,000,000IU) and then see if this \n	normal vitamin A pool could prevent PMS.  48% getting the high dose \n	vitamin A had complete remission of the symptoms of PMS.  Only 10% \n	getting the placebo reported getting complete relief of PMS sysmptoms.\n  	10% of the vitamin A treated group reported no improvement in PMS \n	symptoms.\n\n	Experimental Controlled Study, "Premenstrual tension treated with \n	vitamin A" J. Clinical Endocrinology 10:1579-89(1950). 30 pts \n	received 200,000IU of vitamin A daily starting on day 15 of their \n	cycle with supplementation continuing until the onset of PMS symptoms.\n  	After 2-6 months, all 30 pts reported a significant improvement in \n	PMS symptoms.  Vitamin A supplementation was stopped once evidence of \n	toxicity was demonstrated and all 30 pts were followed for one year \n	after high dose vitamin A supplementation was stopped.  PMS symptoms \n	did not reoccur in any of these 30 pts for upto one year after the \n	vitamin A supplementation was stopped.\n\nMost Americans do not have a normal store of vitamin A in their liver.  \nThese studies and several others were designed to see if getting a normal \nstore of vitamin A into the liver could eliminate PMS.  Of all the vitamins \ngiven for PMS(vitamin A, B6, and vitamin E), vitamin A has shown the best \nsingle effect.  This is probably because vitamin A is involved in steroid \n(estrogen/progesterone) metabolism in the liver.  Getting your liver full \nof vitamin A seems to be one of the best things that you can do to prevent \nthe symptoms of PMS.  But vitamin A is toxic and you don't want to be trying \nto do this without being seen by a physician who can monitor you for vitamin \nA toxicity.\n\n	VITAMIN B6: Experimental Double-blind Crossoverr Study, "Pyridoxine\n	(vitamin B6) and the premenstrual syndrome: A randomized crossover \n	trial"J.R. Coll. Gen. Pract. 39:364-68(1989).  32 women aged 18-49 \n	with moderate to severe PMS randomly received 50mg B6 daily or placebo.\n  	After 3 months the groups were switched and followed for another \n	3 months.  B6 had a significant effect on the emotional aspects of \n	PMS(depression, irritability and tiredness).  Other symptoms of PMS \n	were not significanttly affected by B6 supplementation.\n\n	Experimental Double-blind Study, "The efects of vitamin B6 \n	supplementation on premenstrual sysmptoms" Obstet. Gynecol \n	70(2):145-49(1987).  55 pts with moderate to severe PMS received \n	150mg B6 daily or placebo for 2 months.  Analysis of convergence \n	showed that B6 significantly improved premenstrual symptoms related \n	to the autonomic nervous system(dizziness and vomiting) as well as \n	behavior changes(poor mental performance, decreased social interaction)\n  	Anxiety, depression and water retention were not improved by B6 \n	supplementation.\n\nVitamin B6 is below the RDA for both American men and women.  Birth control \npills and over 40 different drugs increase the B6 requirement in man.  \nWomen on birth control pills should be supplemented with 10-15 mg of B6 per \nday.  The dose should be increased if symptoms of PMS appear.  Dr. David R. \nRubinow who heads the biological psychiatry branch of NIMH was quoted in \nClin. Psychiatry News, December, 1987 as stating that B6 should be \nconsidered the "first-line" drug for PMS(over progesterone) and if the \npatient does not respond, then other treatments should be tried.  Vitamin \nB6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if consumed in doses of 500mg or more each \nday. \n\n\n	VITAMIN E: Experimental Double-blind Study, "Efficacy of alpha-\n	tocopherol in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome" J. Reprod. \n	Med. 32(6):400-04(1987). 35 pts received 400IU vitamin E daily for 3 \n	cycles or a placebo.  Vitamin E treated pts had 33% who reported a \n	significant reduction in physical symptoms(weight gain and breast \n	tenderness) while the placebo group had 14% who reported a significant\n 	reduction in physical symptoms. The vitamin E group reported that 38% \n	had a significant reduction in anxiety versus 12% for the placebo \n	group.  For depression, the vitamin E group had 27% with a significant\n	decrease in depression compared with 8% for the placebo group.\n\n	Experimental Double-blind Study, "The effect of alpha-tocopherol on \n	premenstrual symptomalogy: A double blind study" J. Am. Coll. Nutr. \n	2(2):115-122(1983). 75pts with benign breast disease and PMT randomly \n	received vitamin E at 75IU, 150IU, or 300IU daily or placebo.  After \n	2 months of supplementation, 150IU of vitamin E or higher significantly \n	improved PMT-A and PMT-C.  The 300IU dose was needed to significantly \n	improve PMT-D.  No dose of vitamin E significantly improved PMT-H\n	(other studies have shown that a higher vitamin E doses will relieve \n	PMT-H symptoms).\n	\n	MAGNESIUM: Experimental Double-blind Study, "Magnesium prophylaxis \n	of menstrual migraine: effects on itracellular magnesium" Headache \n	31:298-304(1991). 20 pts with perimenstrual headache received 360 mg \n	daily of magnesium as magnesium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid or a \n	placebo.  Treatment was started on the 15th day of the cycle and \n	continued until menstruation. After 2 months, the Pain Total Index \n	was significantly lower in the magnesium group.  Magnesium treatment \n	was also assocoiated with a significant reduction in the Menstrual \n	Distress Questionnaire scores.  Pretreatment magnesium levels in  \n	lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes were significantly lower \n	in this group of 20 pts compared to control women who did not suffer \n	from PMS.  After treatment, magnesium levels in these cells was raised \n	into the normal range.\n\n	Experimental Double-blind Study, "Oral Magnesium successfully \n	relieves premenstrual mood changes" Obstet. Gynecol 78(2):177-81(1991). \n	32pts aged 24-39 randomly received either magnesium carboxylic acid \n	360mg of Mg per day or a placebo from the 15th day of the cycle to the \n	onset of the menstrual flow.  After 2 cycles, both groups received \n	magnesium.  The Menstrual Distress Questionnaire score of the cluster \n	pain was significantly reduced during the second cycle(month) for the \n	magnesium treatment group as well as the placebo group once they were \n	switched to magnesium supplementation.  In addition, the total score on \n	the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire was significantly decreased by \n	magnesium supplementation.  The authors suggest that magnesium \n	supplemenation should become a routine treatment for the mood changes \n	that occur during PMS.\n\nThere are numerous observational studies that have been published in the \nmedical literature which also suggest that PMS is primarily a disorder \nthat arises out of a hormone imbalance that is dietary in nature.  But \nsince observational studies are considered by most physicians in Sci. Med. \nto be anecdotal in nature, I have not bothered to cite them.  There are \nalso over a half dozen good experimental studies that have been done on \nmultivitamin and mineral supplementation to prevent PMS.  I've chosen the \nbest specific studies on individual vitamins and minerals to try to point out \nthat PMS is primarily a nutritional disorder.  But doctors don't recognize \nnutritional disorders unless they can see clinical pathology(beri-beri, \npellagra, scruvy, etc.).  PMS is probably the best reason why every doctor \nbeing trained in the U.S. should get a good course on human nutrition.  PMS \nis really only the tip if the iceberg when it comes to nutritional \ndisorders.  It's time that medicine woke up and smelled the roses.\n\nHere's some studies which show the importance in multivitamin/mineral \nsupplementation and/or diet change in preventing PMS.\n\n	Experimental Study, "Effect of a nutritional programme on \n	premenstrual syndrome: a retrospective analysis", Complement. Med. \n	Res.5(1):8-11(1991).  200pts were given dietary instructions and \n	supplemented with Optivite(R) plus additional vitamin C, vitamin E, \n	magnesium, zinc and primrose oil.  The dietary instructions were to \n	take the supplements and switch to a low fat, complex carbohydrate \n	diet.  On a retrospective analysis, 96.5% of the 200pts reported an \n	improvement in their PMS symptoms with 30% of the sample stating that \n	they no longer suffered from PMS. \n\n\n	Experimental Double-blind Study, "Role of Nutrition in managing \n	premenstrual tension syndromes", J Reprod. Med. 32(6):405-22(1987).  \n	A low fat, high complex carbohydrate diet along with Optivite \n	supplementation significantly decreased PMS scores compared with diet \n	change and placebo.  After 6 months on the experimental program, the \n	vitamin/mineral supplementated group had significantly decreased \n	estradiol and increased progesterone in serum during the midlutel \n	phase of their cycle.\n\n	Experimental Double-blind Study, "Clinical and biochemical effects \n	of nutritional supplementation on the premenstrual syndrome", J. \n	Reprod. Med. 32(6):435-41(1987). 119pts randomly given Optivite(12 \n	tablets per day) or a placebo.  The treated groups showed a \n	significant decrease in PMS symptoms compared to the placebo.  Another\n 	group of 104pts got Optivite(4 tablets per day) or placebo.  For this \n	second group of patients, no significant effect of supplementation on \n	PMS symptoms was observed.\n\nMartin Banschbach, Ph.D.\nProfessor of Biochemistry and Chairman\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Microbiology\nOSU College of Osteopathic Medicine\n1111 W. 17th St.\nTulsa, Ok 74107
EDTA(chelation therapy) has been used by some physicians to try to remove \ncalcium from calcified plaques in the arterial system(not approved for such \nuse).  There is also the possibility that lung tissue in patients with lung \ndisease has become calcified(chest x-rays would show this).  There are side\n-effects to the use of EDTA because it is not specific for calcium(it also \nbinds other minerals).  I think that there have been some deaths when \nEDTA chelation therapy has been used because of mineral imbalances that \nwere not detected and corrected.  In animal studies, the best way to remove \ncalcium from plaques in rabbits was to supplement the rabbits with vitamin C \nand magnesium(rabbits already synthesize their own vitamin C, the extra \nvitamin C was given in their diets to help the magnesium displace the calcium \nfrom the plaques).\n\nThe calcification process that occurs in both plaques and the lung probably \ncan be prevented if magnesium is used in supplemental form.  Most patietns \nwith calcium deposits are found to be deficient in calcium.\n\n	1. "Magnesium interrationships in ischemic heart disease: A review"\n	   Am J Clin Nutr 27(1):59-79(1974).  Supplementation with \n	   magnesium will prevent clacification of blood vessels. \n\n	2. "The importance of magnesium deficiency in cardiovascular \n	    disease" Am. Heart J 94:649-57(1977).  The need to measure the \n	    serum concentration in all patients with heat disease cannot be \n	    overemphasized.  This is a review article.\n\n	3. "Effect of dietary magnesium on development of atherosclerosis \n	   in cholesterol-fed rabbits" Atherosclerosis 10:732-7(1990).  \n	   Magnesium supplementation greatly decreased the formation of \n	   plaques in rabbits feed a diet that had 1% by weight cholesterrol \n	   added to their normal food.\n\nSince EDTA will also bind magnesium, I've never really liked it's use for \nthe reversal of athersclerosis or now apparently in emphesema patients.
If anyone has any information on this deficiency I would very greatly\nappreciate a response here or preferably by Email.  All I know at this\npoint is a deficiency can cause myoglobin to be released, and in times\nof stress and high ambient temperature could cause renal failure.\nx
Before more bandwidth gets wasted on this:\n\nI APOLOGIZE for my flame.\n\nFirst, because I distributed the message to so many newsgroups; I did\n       not check the crosspostings of the article I followed up on.\n\nSecond, for not making my argument clear enough. I reacted to the tone\n        of many of the anti-Kirlian posts, not to their content. Right\n        or wrong, I found the arguments set in arrogant and sneering words\n        (that includes "jokes"), which I still think is unwarranted.\n\nAnd, obviously, I should not have done the same.
Human infants do have bown fat deposits while adult humans are\nbelieved not to have brown fat.\n	Also while brown fat may play an important role in rousing\nhibernators, it is definitely not limited to hibernating animals -- it\nis a common energy source for nonshivering thermogenesis.
...\n\nThere are several different types of Thyroid diseases which would cause\na hypothyroid condition (reduction in the output of the thyroid, mainly\nthyroxin). Except for ones caused by infections, the treatment is\ngenerally thyroxin pills. Hypothyroid conditions caused by infections\nusually disappear when the infection does...this doesn't sound like the\ncase with your wife.\nThyroxin orally does "shut down the thyroid" through a feedback loop\ninvolving the pituitary (I believe). The pituitary "thinks" that the\ncorrect amount of thyroxin is being produced so it doesn't have to\ntell the thyroid to produce more. This process is reversable! I have\nHashimoto's thyroiditis (an autoimmune condition) and was on thyroxin\nfor approx 6 mo when my endocrinologist suggested I not take the pills\nfor 6 wks. When I was retested for thyroxin levels, they were normal.\nI still get tested every 6mo because the condition might reappear.\nThe pills are safe and have very few side-affects (& those mostly at\nbeginning of treatment). Having a baby might be a problem and would at\nleast require closer monitoring of hormone levels.\nThyroxin controls energy production which explains sleepiness, coldness,\nand weight gain. There is also water retention (possibly around heart),\nchanges in vision, and coarser hair and skin among other things.\n\nI am not a doctor, so I'm sure I mistated something, but the important\nthing is that thyroid problems are usually easily corrected and if they\naren't corrected can cause problems in the rest of the body. Get a\nsecond opinion from a good endocrinologist and have him/her explain\nthings in detail to you and your wife.
Case Western Reserve Med School teaches nutrition in its own section as\nwell as covering it in other sections as they apply (i.e. B12\ndeficiency in neuro as a cause of neuropathy, B12 deficiency in\nhematology as a cause of megaloblastic anemia), yet I sill\nhold the viewpoint of mainstream medicine:  candida can cause\nmucocutaneous candidiasis, and, in already very sick patients\nwith damaged immune systems like AIDS and cancer patients,\nsystemic candida infection.  I think "The Yeast Connection" is\na bunch of hooey.  What does this have to do with how well\nnutrition is taught, anyway?\n\nWell, maybe I'm getting picky, but I always thought that a yeast\nwas one form that a fungus could exist in, the other being the\nmold form.  Many fungi can occur as either yeasts or molds, \ndepending on environment.  Candida exibits what is known as\nreverse dimorphism - it exists as a mold in the tissues\nbut exists as a yeast in the environment.  Should we maybe\ncall it a mold infection?  a fungus infection?  Maybe we\nshould say it is caused by a mold-like fungus.

Friend's unpleasant experience uring CT scan deleted\n\nI'd suggest writing a detailed letter about the incident to the\nhospital administrator. Specify the date and time. If possible the\nnames of the technicians. \n\nSend a copy to the clinician under whose care your friend was\nadmitted. I say this because, though your friend has no argument\nwith the doctor, I have found that administrators sometimes ignore\ncomplaints until the patient becomes litigious. Clinicians may not\nhave been informed of the complaint and are very surprised to find\nthemselves named in a suit.\n\nIf there is no response within a week send a follow up letter.\nAttach a photocopy of the original letter. Do this weekly until you\ndo get a response.\n\nCAT scans are non-invasive but they can be very scary. The scanner\ncan be a bad place for the claustrophobic. There was an interesting\nstudy in the BMJ, about 10 years ago, which found that around 10% of\npeople who had CAT scans found it so unpleasant that they would\nnever have another. This compares with 15% who said the same about a\nlumbar puncture.

You should\n generally *not* take rutin by itself, but take the whole bioflavonoid \n complex instead. If you don't (and there are some exceptions to that)\n you'll eventually create a hesperidin deficiency, which is the other\n major component of the bioflavonoid complex.\n I found out the hard way years ago when I recommended rutin, after it\n showed deficient in patients who were NOT deficient in hesperidin be-\n fore. A later retest almost always showed a subsequent deficiency in \n hesperidin, which, from then on, made me always *add* bioflavonoids \n to anyone that had *very* low levels of rutin.\n Most of the time people are equally low in rutin *and* hesperidin, so\n there is really no reason to take rutin by itself, but use the whole\n bioflavonoid complex instead.\n\n I have several thousand patients taking them with many claiming that \n they had been helped with hemorrhoids, varicose veins, chronic nose \n bleeds, aneurysms, gastro-intestinal bleeding (due to drugs), etc...\n One patient in desperation took a whole bottle (100's) in one day\n for his painful, bleeding hemorrhoids, without any ill effects.\n  \n They are also non-toxic in very high amounts, that's why they can\n be safely recommended. If you are allergic to citrus fruit (they are\n made from their peels), pine bark sources are available as well.\n\n About 90% of patients tested show a bioflavonoid deficiency, \n with the average daily dosage needed being about 1 - 2,000mg.\n For major complaints, 4 - 6,000mg+/day is common.\n \n In case they cannot be taken, because of their size and taste (they\n are big, and they don't taste that great), a product made from pine \n bark extract gives you the same effect and the tablets are quite\n small and taste much better, however the cost is about seven times\n higher for the equivalent effect. One 25mg tablet of the pine bark\n extract gives you about the same effect as 1,000mg of bioflavonoids.\n The name for the pine bark product is 'Pycnogenol.'\n  \n   Some Canadian brands carrying bioflavonoids are:\n \n   Quest.............1,000mg   big, bitter, not chewable\n   Swiss Herbal........600mg   smooth, easier swallowing \n   Jamieson............500mg   medium, bitter, chewable \n\n   SISU.................25mg   (Pycnogenol) small, easy swallowing\n \n   Give them a try and see what happens.....and good luck!\n\n   -- Ron Roth --\n =====================================================================\n --  Internet: rn.3228@rose.com  -  Rosenet: ron roth@rosehamilton  --\n\n *   "Eating Radium has strange results,"  Tom said brightly.
I am quite near sighted.\n\nI've recently received laser treatment for both eyes to seal\nholes in the retinas to help prevent retinal detachment. In my\nleft eye a small detachment had begun already and apparently the\nlaser was used to "weld" this back in place as well.\n\nMy right eye seems fine. In my left eye I was seeing occasional\nflashes of bright light prior to the treatment. Since the\ntreatment (two weeks) these flashes are now occuring more often\n- several each hour.\n\nThe opthamologist explained the flashes are caused because the\nvitreous body has attached to the retina and is pulling on it. He\nsays this is not treatable and he hopes it may go away on its own\naccord - if it tugs enough I may well face retinal detachment.\n\nI am seeking (via sci.med) additional info on retinal detachments.\nThe Dr. did not wish to spend much time with me in explanations\nso I appreciate any further details anyone can provide. Of most\ninterest to me:\n\nIf my retina does detach what should be my immediate course\nof action?\n\nIf conventional surgery is need to repair the detachment what is\nthe procedure like and what kind of vision can I expect\nafterwards.\n\nDo the symptoms (fairly frequent flashes) imply that detachment\nmaybe near at hand or is this not necessarily cause for alarm.\n\nMany thanks\n\nBill
As a matter of fact, I just saw a dermatologist the other day, and while I \nwas there, I asked him about dry skin. I'd been spending a small fortune\non various creams, lotions, and other dry skin treatments.\nHe said all I needed was a large jar of vaseline. Soak in a lukewarm tub\nof water for 10 minutes (ONLY 10 minutes!) then massage in the vaseline,\nto trap the moisture in. That will help. I haven't tried it yet, but you\ncan bet I will. The hard part will be finding the time to rub in the\nvaseline properly. If it's not done right, you remain greasy and stick\nto your clothes.\nTry it. It's got to be cheaper then spending $30 for 8 oz. of 'natural'\nlotion.
Does anyone know if either theophylline or ephedrine, or the two in\ncombination, can reduce the body's ability to make use of \navailable water?  I had kind of an odd experience on a group hike\nrecently, becoming dehyrated after about 9 hours of rigorous\nhiking despite having brought 1 1/2 gallons of water (c. 6 liters).\nI drank close to twice as much as anyone else, and no one else was\ndehydrated.  I don't think general physical condition was an issue,\nsince I was in at least the middle of the pack in terms of general\nstamina, so far as I could tell.
: \n:    Isn't there a relatively new treatment for kidney stones involving\n:    a non-invasive use of ultra-sound where the patient is lowered\n:    into some sort of liquid when he/she undergoes treatment? I'm sure\n:    I've read about it somewhere. If I remember it correctly it is a\n:    painless and effective treatment.\nThe use of shock waves (not ultrasound) to break up stones has been\naround for a few years.  Depending on the type of machine, and intensity\nof the shock waves, it is usually uncomfortable enough to require\nsomething...  The high-power machines cause enough pain to require\ngeneral or regional anesthesia.  Afterwards, it feels like someone\nslugged you pretty good!
Perhaps I should quit eating mushrooms, soya beans, and brie cheese\nwhich all have MSG in them.

I've made my decision and I don't think it's appropriate\nfor anyone to try to 'convert' me.  "It's for your own good" are\nthe most obnoxious and harmful words, IMO, in the English (or\nany other) language.\n\n\nI think it is.  I get tired of people saying 'don't eat X because\nit's BAD!'  Well, X may not be bad for everyone.  And even if\nit is, so what?  Give people all the information but don't ram\nyour decisions down their throats.
My girlfriend just started taking this drug for her migranes.  It really\nhelped her get through the rebound withdrawl when she got off analgesics. \nShe doesn't have a mail account, but asked me to forward this:\n\n"Glaxo is the distributor; Imitrex is the drug's brand name.  It works. \nShe can call her pharmacy for more info. The "miracle" drug has been used\nfor years in Europe and for some time in Canada.  Trials in the U.S. were\ncompleted and the drug hit the US market at the end of March.  Some\npharmacies don't stock it yet.  Presently it needs to be injected\nsubcutaneously; although testing is starting with a nasal spray form.  It\nmimics serotonin (its molecular structure that fits onto pain receptors\nlooks identical to serotonin on a model I saw)"
Unfortonately, that truly is about the best summation of the research\nthat there is.  Advantages stated of circumcison included probably\nprevention of penile cancer, (which, interestingly, occurs mostly in men\nwhose personal hygiene is exceptionally poor), simplicity of personal\nhygiene, prevention of urinary tract infections, and prevention of\na unretractible foreskin,  Disadvantages include infection from the \nprocedure, pain, etc.  I apologize; I am trying to pull this off\nthe top of my head.  I will post what I discovered in research; I did\na paper on the topic in my research class in Nursing school.\nIt really is a decision that is up to the parents.  Some parents use\nthe reasoning that they will "look like Daddy" and like their friends\nas justification.  There is nothing wrong with this; just be sure it is\nwhat you want to do, since it is rather difficult to uncircumcise\na male, although a major surgical procedure exists.\n\nAs long as your membranes have not broken and you have not had any\nproblems with your pregnancy, it should be OK to sit in a tub of water.\nHOWEVER, I WOULD RECOMMEND USING YOUR OWN BATHTUB IN YOUR OWN HOME!\nIt is nearly impossible to guarantee the cleanliness and safety of "public"\nhot tubs.  A nice warm bath can be very relaxing, especially if your back\nis killing you!  And it would possibly be advisable to avoid bubble bath\nsoap , esp. if you are prone to yeast infection.\n\nHope these tips help you some.
No wonder he became confused!  With so many drugs, it is almost impossible\nto know which one is causing the problem.  And because some drugs \npotentiate the effect of each other, they can make the side effects\nall the worse, and even dangerous.  (kinda like mixing alcohol and \nantihistamines!)\n\n\nUnfortunately, doctors prescribe drugs to treat the side effects of\nthe drugs a patient is receiving.  If one drug they are taking causes\nthe patient's blood pressure to go up, many times an antihypertensive\nis prescribed instead of re-evaluating the need for the original drug.\nThis is why many older adults are trying to take a dozen or so drugs\nat home!!!!
: : 	\n: :         Hello,\n\n: :         Just one quick question:\n: :         My father has had a back problem for a long time and doctors\n: :         have diagnosed an operation is needed. Since he lives down in\n: :         Mexico, he wants to know if there is a hospital anywhere in\n: :         the United States particulary famous for this kind of surgery,\n: :         kind of like Houston has a reputation for excellent doctors\n: :         in eye surgery. Any additional info or pointers will be\n: :         appreciated a whole lot!...\n\n: There is one hospital that is here in New York City that is famous for its\n: orthopedists, namely the Hospital for Special Surgery. They are located on\n: the upper east side of manhattan. If you want their address and phone let\n: me know, i'll get them, i dont know them off hand.\n\nfor those who are interested the hospitals i was referring to are: \n\nThe Hospital for Special Surgery\n535 East 70th Street\nNew York, NY 10021\n212-606-1555 (Physician Referral Service & info)\n \nThe Hospital for Joint Diseases\n301 East 17th Street\nNew York, NY 10003\n212-598-7600
Hi,\n	I'm an avid dieter and the new miracle drug seems to involve thermo-\ngenics. The drug is claimed to stimulate the brown fat to burn food \ncreating eat as opposed to the fat being stored. There are all sorts of\nwarnings about fevers, elevated blood pressure and heart rate, ect..\n	The silver lining is that apparently some weight loss does not \nrequire a change in diet. Is this possible? Are the pills dangerous or just\nhoaxes?
I was told by my doctor\n\n\n\nI've had three children and the pain was different in degree for each.  I\nthink it just depends.  I was impressed by how awful a kidney stone seemed\nto be, when I saw a relative with one.  I bet they depend, too--some are\nprobably worse than others.\n\nPain--yucch.
Could someone give me some information on the cause, pathophysiology and \nclinical manifestations and treatment of this type of cancer.
I saw a printed up flyer that stated the person was a\n"licensed herbologist and iridologist"\nWhat are your opinions?\nHow much can you tell about a person's health by looking into their eyes?
The following is based on copies I was given of some articles published in\nHearing Instruments. I would appreciate any comments about this and other\n'new' technology for hearing aids.\n\nThe ReSound system was developed on the basis of some research at AT&T and\nappears to take a different approach from other aids. It appears to me that\na new 'programmable' aid like the Widex just uses a more flexible (and\nprogrammable) version of the classical approach of amplifying some parts of\nthe spectrum more than others and adding some compression to try and help\nout in 'noisy' situations.\n\nThe major difference in the ReSound approach is that it divides the\nspectrum into low and high frequencies (splitting point is programmable),\napparently based on the fact that lots of vowel information can be found in\nthe low frequencies, while the important consonant information\n(unfortunately for me) is in the high frequencies. The two bands then are\ntreated with different compression schemes which are programable. They have\nalso developed a new fitting algorythm that builds on what they call\n'abnormal growth of loudness'.\n\nThis latter is interesting and fits my own personal experience, though I\nthink the phrase is missleading. What appears to be the case is that as you\nexceed the minimum threshold for a person with hearing loss, the deficit\nbecomes progresslively less compared to normals and by the time you reach\nthe 'too loud' point the sensitivity curves appear to converge.  This means\nthat if you just boost all sound levels, you are overloading at the high\nend for people with hearing losses. Hence what you want is progressively\nless amplification as the signal get closer to the maximum tolerable point.\nYou want to boost low volume sounds more than high and do so potentially\ndifferently for the low and high frequency parts of the spectrum (specially\nfor someone like me who is relatively normal up to 1000 cps and then falls\noff a cliff).\n\nAids with simple compressors don't descriminate between energy in the low\nand high frequencies and can therefor 'compress' useful high frequency\ninformation because of high volume of low frequency components.\nParticularly impressive was the ReSound performance with whispered speech\nand in simulated restaurant noise situations.
hi all, i got several emails and a couple news replies and i guess i\nshoulda went into more detail... Being my anxiety level is peaking and you\nfolks have no clue who I am I may as well post the specifics and see what\nyou people think regarding my previous post.\nTo recap i applied to 20 schools total, 16 of which were MD and 4 DO.\n\nas it stands now i have had 13 rejects, 4 interviews( 2 MD and 2 DO), the\nresults of which are 2 waiting lists (1 MD and one DO)\n\n3 schools i heard nothing from at all.\n\nI have contacted all institutions other than the rejects and they have no\ninfo whatsoever to tell me.\n\nI have taken a good mix to apply to.. 2-3 top schools a bunch of middles\nand a few "safety"  (funny that most of my safety schools were the first\nto reject me)\n\nmy index is at like a 3.5 mcats were R7 P9 B10 WQ and R7 P9 B11 WR\nI couldnt get the damn reading score up... i never stuff like art\nhistory, politics etc \n\nIve done medical research at the undergrad level, done clinical lab work\nfor years now, but unfortunately i have no patient contact experience.\n\nI cant think of what else i left out... but thats the summary. What\npercent of people are usually called from the waiting lists on an average?\nI felt that my interviews went quite well yet i dont have a firm\nacceptance in my hand... anyone have any suggestions as to calm the\nmailbox anxiety?  \n\nIf you premeds out there or med students have any questions or comments\nfor me feel free to send them down... Typing is a form of anti-anxiety\nthereapy hehehehe :)

The bacteria in your gut are important.  But colonic flushes are not the \nway to improve gut function.  Each person has almost a unique mix of \nbacteria in his/her gut.  Diet affects this mix as does the use of \nantibiotics.  A diet change is a much better way to alter the players in \nyour gut than is colonic flushes.  Cross contamination has been a real \nproblem in some of the outfits that do this "treatment" since the equipment \nis not always cleaned as well as it should be between patient "treatments".\nDental drills have me a little concerned about HIV infection and I've \npicked a dentist that uses both chemical and autoclave sterilization of his \ninstruments(more clostly but much safer).  Full sterile technique is \nalso used just like that practiced in an OR(mask, gloves and gowns worn and \ndisposed of between patients).  Each visit costs me 15 dollars more than \nthe standard and customary fee so I have to pay it out of pocket.  His much \nhigher fees do not drive away patients.\n\nI can not think of any good reason why someone should subject themselves to \nthis colonic flush procedure.  For very little, if any benefit, you \nsubject yourself to hepatitis, cholera, parasitic disease and even HIV.\nJust ask yourself why someone might resort to this kind of treatment?\nCould they be having GI distress?  Could this distress be due to a \npathogenic organism?  Could I get this organism if the equipment is not \ncleaned properly between patients?  Do I really want to take this risk?\nFood for thought.
My doc handed me 10mg samples of CLARITIN (brand of Ioratadine Tablet\nfrom Schering Corp.)  I tried to find it in the PDR to no avail.

Thanx in advance.
Nonsense! I've taught fifth, sixth, seventh . There are a few early puberty \ntypes in fifth and it has nothing to do with early sexual experience.
Three possible results after interview:\n1) rejection outright\n2) acceptance outright\n3) the infamous 'wait list'... \n\nIf you are on a 'wait list', your entrance into medical school\nis dependent upon some other applicant withdrawing their\nacceptance.  This can happen as late as day -1 of starting\nclasses.  \n\n\nYou can always call the admissions office.  The secretaries\nshould have some idea of when a decision might be made on your\napplication.  Be calm, respectful, and friendly; secretaries\nhave more power than you might realize, and you never know-\ncould be the dean of admissions answering the phone.\n\n\nIf you don't get in this year, sit down and re-evaluate\nyourself: your motives, desires, and goals that are directing\nyou into medicine; your academic and extracurricular\naccomplishments.  Make a decision about whether you *really*\nwant to be a medical doctor.  I had classmates who dropped out\nin the first semester of med school because they found it was\nnot what they wanted to do; I have friends who applied four\nyears in a row before they were accepted.  Medicine as a\ncareer is a choice you must make for yourself; DON'T be\npushed into it because of your parents/family/significant\nother.  \n\nIf you still want to be a medical doctor, determine how you\ncan improve your application.  A letter of recommendation from\na professor who knows you well and can give an honest positive\nrecommendation is far better than one from a 'big-shot' famous\nprofessor who only vaguely remembers your face.  Also, don't\nbe afraid to ask these people if they can give you an honest\nand positive recommendation; give them a chance to say 'no,\nsorry' instead of the medical school saying 'no, sorry'.  I\nhave turned down writing recommendations for some students\nbecause I did not know them well enough to make any meaningful\ncomments, and some because I honestly could not recommend them\nat that point.  \n\nRewrite your personal statement; take it by an English\nprofessor or some other friendly person with skill and\nexperience in writing and proof-reading and get their\ncriticism, both about what you are saying as well as how you\nsay it.\n\nReview your academic accomplishments.  If your grades are poor\nin some area, don't be afraid to spend some time in further\ncoursework.  Evidence of determined committment will help\nhere.  If you filled your pre-medicine curriculum with gut\ncourses, it usually shows.\n\nLook at your extracurricular involvements.  Participating in\nlocal philanthropic or service organizations is a plus;\nsubstantial leadership roles in an organization help also.\nBeware of 'resume padding'; such things are not difficult to\nspot and weed out.\n\nOverall, a clear conception of where you wish to head and why\nyou want to get there, combined with an honest self-appraisal\nof skills and aptitude, will be the best path to take in\napplying to any program, medical or what-have-you.\n\nGood luck with the process -- as Tom Petty says, 'the waiting\nis the hardest part', at least emotionally. :)
You probably were trying to be facetious but just for the record partial nasal\nobstruction is correlated with a number of chronic disorders such as migraine,\nhyperthyroidism, asthma, peptic ulcer, dysmenorrhea, and lack of libido (:-) )\n[Riga IN. Rev d'Oto-Neuro-Ophthalmol 1957;24:325-335], cardiac symptoms\n[Jackson RT. Annals of Otology 1976;85:65-70  Cvetnic MH, Cvetnic V. Rhinology\n1980;18:47-50     Cottle MH. Rhinology 1980;18:67-81], and fever, inadequate\noral intake and electrolyte imbalance [Fairbanks DNF. Otorhinolaryngology Head\nand Neck Surgery 1986;94:412-415).\n\nSo before you post your inane comments it would be nice if you'd run a MEDLINE\nsearch on the topic say back to 1966. There's been extensive literature on this\nfor over a 100 years.\n\nI may be in cardiology but I've had a very good working relationship with\nmy colleagues from ENT.
Well, I think you might want to visit a doctor who is familiar with\nsleep disturbances, because antihistamines only help induce sleep when\nthey're used intermittently; they lose their sedative effect if they're\nused on a nightly basis.  Their anticholinergic effects (drying of secretions,\nrelaxing effects on smooth muscle) can be problematic in some people, such as\nthose with glaucoma or prostate enlargement.\n\nAntihistamines like diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or doxylamine (Unisom)\nare potent sedatives which are useful occasionally.  Chlorpheniramine\n(Chlor-Trimeton) is said to be less sedative, but 8mg seems to work\nwell in some people.  Both chlorpheniramine and doxylamine have long\nhalf-lives compared to diphenhydramine, and so may produce a residual\nhangover or "drugged" feeling the next morning.
Colonics were a health fad of the 19th century, which persists to this day.\nExcept for certain medical conditions, there is no reason to do this.\nCertainly no normal person should do this.

About six years ago my ears clogged up with wax, probably as a\nresult of to much headphone use.  Anyway, the clinic that cleaned\nthem out used the following procedure:\n\n1. Inject olive oil into ears.\n2. Prevent leakage of oil with cotton.\n3. Come back in an hour.\n4. Rinse ears with warm vater, forcefully injected\n   into ear (very strange sensation).\n5. Done.\n\nThey had special tools to do this, and were evidently quite\nfamiliar with the problem: Very large steel syringe.  Special\nbowl with cutout for ear to take the grime coming out without\nspillage.\n\n\nSeconded,
Hello all,\n\n          There is a small problem a friend of mine is experiencing and I \nwould appreciate any help at all with it.\n\nMy friend has been diagnosed as having a severe case of depression requiring \nantidepressants for a cure. The main problem is the side effects of these. \nSo far she has been prescribed Prozac, Aurorix, and tryptanol all with \ndifferent but unbearable side effects.\n\nThe Prozac gave very bad anxiety/jitters and insomina, it was impossible to \nsit still for more than a minute or so.\n\nThe Aurorix whilst having a calming effect, all feelings were lost and the \nbody co-ordination was similar to a drunken person. Her brain was clouded \nover.\n\nThe tryptanol gave tremors in the legs and panic attacks along with unco- \nordination occurred. She did not know what she was doing as her brain was \n"closed down".\n\nHas anyone had similar problems and/or have any suggestions as to the next \nstep?\n\nThankyou in advance.

Need info on Circumcision, medical cons and pros\n\n\nI'm very surprised that medical schools still push routine circumcision\nof newborn males on the population.

Umm, weren't you the one objecting to someone who is a "licensed\nphysician" being called a quack?  Or is it just that being a licensed\nphysician is a good defense against charges of quackery when the\nphysician agrees with your system of beliefs?\n\n\nActually, I almost never use the term quack.  When I discuss\n"systemic yeast syndrome", however, I always point out that\nmainstream medicine views this as a quack diagnosis (and I agree\nwith that characterization).\n\n\nReally?  I bet virtually everyone reading these posts understands what\nSteve Dyer, Gordon Banks, and I am implying when we have talked about\nsystemic yeast syndrome as a quack diagnosis.  Would you prefer the\nword "charlatan"?  (I don't happen to think that all quacks are\ncharlatans since I suspect that some believe in the "diseases" they\nare diagnosing.)\n\n\nWhy?  Is there some reason why you feel that it shouldn't be pointed out\nin SCI.med that there is no convincing empirical evidence to support the \nexistence of systemic yeast syndrome?
I need information on the medical (including emotional :-) pros and\ncons of circumcision (at birth).

hi all, Ive applied for the class of 93 at quite a number of schools (20)\nand have gotten 13 rejects, 4 interviews and 3 no responses.\nAny one know when the heck these people send out their acceptance letters?\nAccording to the med school admissions book theyre supposed to send out\nthe number of their class in acceptances by mid March. Whats going on... I\nam losing my sanity checking my mailbox every day.\n\nAlso does anyone have some useful alternatives in case i dont get in, i\nkind of looked into Chiropractic and Podiatry but they really dont\ninterest me. Thanks.
Point 1:\n\nI'm beginning to see that *part* of the disagreements about the whole\n"yeast issue" is on differing perceptions and on differing meanings\nof words.  Medical doctors have a very specific and specialized "jargon",\nnecessary for precise communication within their field (which I'm fully\ncognizant of since I, too, speak "jargonese" when with my peers).  For the\nsituation in sci.med, many times the words or phrases used by doctors can\nhave a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in the\nworld at large, causing significant miscommunication.  One example word,\nand very relevant to the yeast discussion, is the exact meaning of "systemic".\nIt is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific, much\nmore so than its meaning to a non-doctor.  There is also the observation of\nthis newsgroup that both doctors and non-doctors come together on essentially\nequal terms, which, when combined with the jargon issue, can further fan\nthe flames.  This is probably the first time that practicing doctors get\nreally "beat up" by non-doctors for their views on medicine, which they\notherwise don't see much of in their practice except for the occasional\n"difficult" patient.\n\nPoint 2:\n\nI understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will not\nprescribe any treatments/therapies for their patients unless such treatments\nhave been shown to be effective and the risks understood from well-constructed\nclinical trials (usually double-blind), or that such treatments/therapies are\npart of an approved and funded clinical trial.  To these doctors, to do any\ndifferently would, in this belief system, be unethical practice.  And it\nfollows that any therapy not on the "accepted" list is therefore a non-\ntherapy - it does not even exist, nor does the underlying hypothesis or\ntheory have any validity, even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolation\nof what is currently known.  Anecdotal evidence has no value, either, from\na treatment point-of-view.\n\nAnd by and large, as a scientist myself, I am glad that medical practice/\nscience takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment.  However, as\nalso being a human being (last I checked), and having been one of those people\nthat has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment, where\n"standard" medicine was not able to help me, has caused me to sit back and\nwonder if holding such an extreme and rigid "scientific" viewpoint is in\nitself unethical from humanitarian considerations.  After all, the underlying\nintent of the "scientific" approach to medicine is to protect the health of\nthe patient by providing the best possible care for the patient, so the\npatient should come first when considering treatment.\n\nWhat we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies both\nthe "scientific" and the "humanitarian" viewpoints.  In an earlier post I\noutlined a crazy idea for doing just that.  The gist of it was to give any\nphysician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribe\nalternate, not yet proven therapies (maybe supported by anecdotal evidence)\nfor patients who *all* avenues of accepted therapies have been exhausted\n(and not until then).  The patient would be fully informed that such\ntherapies/treatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and that\nthere are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derived\nfrom them.\n\nThis approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor.  It also satisfies\nthe humanitarian needs of the patient.  And the reality is that many patients\nwho have reached a dead-end in the treatment of their symptoms using accepted\nmedicine *will* go outside the orthodox medical community:  either to the\ndoctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losing\ntheir license, or worse, to non-doctors who have not had the proper medical\ntraining.  This approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the control\nmore within orthodox medicine, with the benefits that the information gleaned\ncould help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the most\nproductive way.  Everybody wins in this admittedly rose-colored approach - I'm\nsure there are real problems with this approach as well - it is presented\nmore as a strawman to stimulate discussion.\n\nHopefully what I write here may give the sci.med doctors a better idea as to\nwhy I am "open" to alternative therapies, as well as why I have real\ndifficulty (read "apparent hostility") with the "coldness" of the 99.9% pure\n"scientific" approach to medicine.  I believe the best approach to medical\ntreatment is one where both the "humanitarian" aspects are balanced with and\nby the "scientific" aspects.  Anything else is just not good medicine, imho.\nJust my 'NF' leanings, I guess.  :^)\n\nComments?\n\nJon Noring\n\n-- \n\nCharter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.
This is ridiculous, and your doctor sounds like a nut, if what is\nreported here is what the doctor actually said.  If your wife's\npancreas stops producing insulin and therefore becomes diabetic, she'll\nneed insulin replacement.  That doesn't mean she's "dependent" on\ninsulin, anymore than she was beforehand--if her body doesn't make\nenough, she'll have to get it elsewhere.  Oral thyroid replacement\nhormone therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for hypothyroidism, and\nit's really the only effective therapy available anyway.  Plus, it's\ncheap.  Taking thyroid hormone when it isn't needed does cause your\nthyroid gland to reduce its own production of the hormone, but that's a\n_feature_, not a _bug_, and it's irrelevant in any case in the face of\nhypothyroidism, because her problem that her gland isn't producing\nenough.  There isn't a clinical phenomenon of "thyroid insufficiency"\ncaused by a sudden discontinuation of exogenous thyroid hormone\nanalogous to adrenal insufficiency caused by the sudden cessation of\nprolonged administration of corticosteroids, so there should be no\nworry about inappropriately "suppressing" the thyroid gland.\n\n\nHomeopathy is nonsense.  Tell her to stop wasting her money, health and time,\nand get her to a legitimate doctor who will be in a position to make\na proper diagnosis and recommend the right therapy.
As a child i can remember picking up a centipede and getting a rather painful \nsting, but it quickly subsided. Much less painful compared to a bee sting. \nCentipedes have a poison claw (one of the front feet) to stun their prey, but\nin my single experience it did not have a lot of "bite" to it.

[reply to roxannen@cruzio.santa-cruz.ca.u]\n \n \nI just got back from the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting,\nwhere the consensus was that sumatriptan (Imitrex) has no advantages\nover DHE-45 nasal spray, which is much less expensive, has fewer side\neffects, is as effective, and works more quickly (5-10 minutes vs. 30).\nBesides, who wants to give themselves a shot (sumatriptan) when a nasal\nspray works?  DHE nasal spray is not widely available yet -- it has to\nbe mail ordered from one of a few pharmacies in the country -- but most\nneurologists now know about it and know how to order it.
:Chronic persistent hepatitis is usually diagnosed when someone does a liver\n:biopsy on a patient that has persistently elevated serum transaminases months\n:after a bout of acute viral hepatitis, or when someone is found to have\n:persistently elevated transaminases on routine screening tests. The degree of\n:elevation (in the serum transaminases) can be trivial, or as much as ten times\n:normal. Other blood chemistries are usually normal. \n:As a rule, patients with CPH have no clinical signs of liver disease. \n:Chronic active hepatitis can also be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, at\n:least initially, and that's why it's important to tell them apart by means of\n:a biopsy. The patient with CPH only needs to be reassured. The patient with\n:CAH needs to be treated.\n\nI just went back to the chapter in Cecil on chronic hepatitis.  It seems\nthat indeed most cases of CPH are persistant viral hepatitis, whereas\nthere are a multitude of potential and probable causes for CAH (viral,\ndrugs, alcohol, autoimmune, etc.).  Physicians seem to have a variety of\n"thresholds" for electing to biopsy someone's liver.  Personally, I think\nthat if the patient is asymptomatic, with only slight transaminitis and\nnormal albumin and PT, one can simply follow them closely and not add the\npotential risks of a biopsy.  Others may well biopsy such a patient, thus\nproviding these samples for study.  It would be interesting to see if\nanyone's done any decision analysis on this.
Putting aside our substantial differences, I'd like to ask the knowledgeable\nones to give feedback on this.  Let me explain.\n\nOne of my family members last week was discovered to have a brain tumor after\nhaving some difficulties with walking and writing (she is 64 years old).\nOtherwise, she is in fine health.  The discovery was made via CAT scans.\n\nShe then had MRI scans done, where small cancerous areas were discovered\nin her lungs.  Biopsies showed it to be adenocarcinoma.  One spot is\nin the lungs, and another in the pneumothorax.  The oncologists believe\nthe cancer started in the lungs and caused the brain tumor (she smoked\nuntil four years ago).\n\nAnyway, I'd like feedback as to what adenocarcinoma is, how it is different\nfrom other cancers, how she will be treated (luckily the tumor is right\nbelow the skull and can be easily removed), and statistically what are\nthe chances for full remission/recovery?\n\nThanks.\n\nJon Noring\n\n-- \n\nCharter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.
I had ankle reconstruction (grafting the extensor digitorum\nlongus to the lateral side of the ankle, along with a video\narthroscopy of the ankle (interesting to watch, to say the\nleast). Since then, I have had periodic muscle spasms (not\ncramping, but twitching that is very fast) in some of the\nmuscle groups along the lateral side, and along the top of\nmy foot. \n\nTX with quinine sulfate produced ringing in my ears, but did\nhelp with the spasms.\n\nI am on flexeril now, but no discernable help with the spasms.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nOne thing - I am in a short leg cast, so heat is not the answer.

These words have multiple meanings.\n\nAs a self-proclaimed atheist, I believe that *some* conceptions\nof god are inconsistent or in conflict with fact, and I lack\nbelief in other conceptions of god merely because there is no\nreason for me to believe in these.

: My girlfriend is in pain from kidney stones. She says that because she has no\n: medical insurance, she cannot get them removed.\n: \n: My question: Is there any way she can treat them herself, or at least mitigate\n: their effects? Any help is deeply appreciated. (Advice, referral to literature,\n: etc...)\n: \n: Thank you,\n: \n: Dave Carvell\n: pk115050@wvnvms.wvnet.edu\n\nFirst off, I would consider the severity of the pain. I had stones\nseveral years ago, and there's now way I could have made it without\nheavy duty doses of morphine and demerol and a two week stay in the\nhospital. I was told that there was nothing that I could take that would\ndissolve them. If the stones are passible, the best thing she could do\nis drink LOTS of water, and hope that they pass, but every time they\nmove a little, the pain will be excrutiating. I was told by my doctor\nat that time that the pain was comparable to that of childbirth. (Yes,\nby a male doctor, so I'm sure some of you women will disagree). I'd\nreally like to know the truth in this, so maybe some of you women who\nhave had a baby and a kidney stone could fill me in. \n--

Do I assume correctly from the above aricle that your mother has a historyy\nof cancer?  I was just wondeing, since you mentioned thhat she has an\noncologist.\n\nA bone scan is a nuclear scan.  Thperson receivving the scan is gven a\ndose of a radioactive tracer, and an imaging device is used to track the\ndistribution of the tracer wwithin the body.  The tracer is usually given\nintravenously.  (IV) This means that the physician or his assistant will\ninsert a needle into a vein and inject  medicine into the vein. \n\nAfter a few minutes has passed for the tracer to circulate through the\nbody, the person is scanned with an imaging device to detect high \nconcentrations of the tracer.  The radiologist or doctor is looking for\nareas that take up more of the radioactive tracer or less of it.\n\nAs far as pain, the only pain comes from the needle stick that is required\nto start the IV line.\n\nWhat the doctor is probably looking for are changes in the bones that may\nhave resulted from cancer.  This is also why I was wondering if your mother\nhas had cancer, since cancer can spread from one site and wind up in the\nskeletal system.\n\nI hope I have answered some of your questions.  Feel free to e-mail me if\nyou have more questions related to the bone scan or anything else related\nto your mother's care.  I'm a newly graduated nurse, and I enjoy sharing\ninformation with other people to help them understand things that they did\nnot know about before.\n\nMy thoughts are with you both.
Speaking from experience, one doesn't need drugs to become disoriented\nduring hospital stays. I was in hosp for 5 days in late Jan; what with\ngeneral noise at all hours of night, staff coming every time I turned over,\nor whatever, to check me out, I didn't get much sustained sleep at night.\nSpent days groggy & dozing, and all it was from my perspective was that I\nwas TIRED!
FLAME ON\n\nReading through the posts about Kirlian (whatever spelling)\nphotography I couldn't help but being slightly disgusted by the\nnarrow-minded, "I know it all", "I don't believe what I can't see or\nmeasure" attitude of many people out there.\n\nI am neither a real believer, nor a disbeliever when it comes to\nso-called "paranormal" stuff; but as far as I'm concerned, it is just\nas likely as the existence of, for instance, a god, which seems to be\nquite accepted in our societies - without any scientific basis.\n\nI am convinced that it is a serious mistake to close your mind to\nsomething, ANYTHING, simply because it doesn't fit your current frame\nof reference. History shows that many great people, great scientists,\nwere people who kept an open mind - and were ridiculed by sceptics.\n\nEspecially the USA should be grateful; after all, Columbus did not\ndrop off the edge of the earth.\n\nFLAME OFF, or end sermon :-)
Precisely.  One wonders what unusual strain the boy might be under that\ncould be causing "difficulty with his behavior".  Standard practice would\nbe to get a second opinion from a child psychiatrist.  One would want to\nrule out the possibility that the "bad behavior" is not psychiatric\nillness at all.\n\n(Disclaimer: I am not a medic. But I am a parent.)
I would like to know if their is any medical consensus\n(or consensus within this group) regarding the ethics\nof the following:\n\n  1: Prescription of placebo medications when the patient\n     did not specifically request any sort of treatment.\n\n  2: Selling a placebo medication for a profit.\n\n  3: Prescribing homeopathic remedies without advising\n     a patient of their "controversial nature".\n\n  4: Representing homeopathic remedies as "over the counter"\n     medications.
Its bogus.  See the sci.skeptic FAQ (I edit it).\n\nYou can diagnose some things by looking at the eyes.  Glaucoma is the\nClassic Example, but there are probably others.\n\nIridology maps parts of the body onto the irises of the eyes.  By\nlooking at the patterns, striations and occasional blobs in the irises\nyou are supposed to be able to diagnose illnesses all over the body.\n\nThe two questions to ask any alternative therapist are:\n\n1: How does it work?\n\n2: What evidence is there?\n\nThe answer to question 1 takes a little knowledge of medicine to\nevaluate.  I don't know about iridology, but I've read a book on\nreflexology, which is a remarkably similar notion except that the\norgans of the body are mapped onto the soles of the feet.  There are\nsupposed to be channels running down the body carrying information or\nenergy of some sort.  Anatomists have found no such structures.\n(Always beware the words "channel" and "energy" in any spiel put out\nby an alternative practitioner.)\n\nThe answer to question 2 is rather simpler.  If all they have is\nanecdotal evidence then forget it.  Ask for referreed papers in\nmainstream medical journals.  Ignore any bull about the conspiracy of\nrich doctors suppressing alternative practitioners.  Studies are done\nand papers are published.  Some of them are even positive.\n\nThe word "licensed" in the flyer is an interesting one.  Licensed by\nwhom?  For what?  It is quite possible that the herbology is real and\nrequires a license: you can kill someone by giving them the wrong\nplants to eat, and many plants contain very powerful drugs (Foxglove\nand Willow spring to mind).  It is not clear whether the license\nextends to the iridology, and I suspect that if you ask you will be\ntold that it means "(Licensed herbologist) and iridologist".\n\nBTW, the usual term is "herbalist".  Why use a different word?
Well, that post was not that accurate.  People with early life hernias\nare felt to have a congenital sack that promotes the formation of hernias.\nThe hernias of later life may be more associated with chronic straining.  \nHowever, the risk of damage to the intestine without an operation is \nhigh enough that it ought to be repaired.  The risk of cancer is probably\nno higher than the general population, but since you are near 40, it would\nbe sensible to have some sort of cancer screening, such as a flexible\nsigmoidoscopy.  Sorry for the misleading info.

nnget 93122.1300541\n\nAnd where do you advise people to turn for cancer information?\n\n\n Most\n\nIt seems to me you've offered a circular refutation of Moss's organization. Who\nhas shown the information in the latest book of PAC to be questionable? Could\nit be those 'regulatory' agencies and medical industries which Moss is showing\nto be operating with *major* vested interests. Whether one believes that these\nvested interests are real or not, or whether or not they actually shape medical\nresearch is a seperate argument. If one sees a possibility, however, that these\ninterests exist, then the 'fact' that some of the information put out by PAC\nhas been refuted by the medical industry doesn't hold much weight.\n\nAs for the ineffectiveness of antineoplasteons, the fact that the NIH didn't\nfind them effective doesn't make much sense here. Of course they didn't! I\ntend to have more faith in the word of the patients who are now alive after\nbeing told years ago that they would be dead of cancer soon. They are fighting\nlike hell to keep that clinic open, and they credit his treatment with their\nsurvival. Anyone who looks at the NIH's record for investigation of 'alterna-\ntive' cancer therapies will easily see that they have a strange knack for find-\ning relatively cheap and nontoxic therapies dangerous or useless.

As far as I can see if your obstetrition has an ultrasound in his rooms\nand is expirienced its use and interpretation, he should be just as\ncapable of reading it as any radiologist. All doctors are "qualified" to\nread x-rays, u/s, ct scans etc. it is just that a radiologist does nothing\nelse, and thus, is only better at reading them because of all this time\nspent doing this (skill in reading x-rays etc. just comes from plenty of\npractice). If your obstetrition reads heaps of obstetric ultrasounds he\nshould be able to pick up any abnormalities that can be demonstrated by\nthis technique.\n\n- Paul.

Fordham von Reyn et al. of the \nDartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H.  The researchers contacted \n2,317 former patients on whom an HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon performed \ninvasive  procedures between January 1, 1978 and June 30, 1992.  The  \northopedic surgeon voluntarily withdrew from practice after  testing positive \nfor HIV.  A total of 1,174 former patients  underwent HIV testing, \nrepresenting 50.7 percent of patients on  whom the orthopedic surgeon \nperformed invasive procedures during  the 13.5-year period.  Patients were \ntested from each year and  from each category of invasive procedure.  All \npatients were  found to be negative for HIV by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent  \nassay.  Two former patients reported known HIV infection prior to surgery.  \nThe examination of AIDS case registries and vital  records neglected to detect \ncases of HIV infection among former  surgical patients.  The estimated cost of \nthe initial patient  notification and testing was $158,000, with the single \nmost  expensive activity being counseling and testing.  This accounted  for 37 \npercent of the total expense.  The patient notification  and testing were \nconducted while maintaining the confidentiality  of the orthopedic surgeon who \nwas an active participant in the  planning and execution of the study.  \nNotifying patients of the  infected surgeon's HIV-status is both disruptive \nand expensive  and is not routinely recommended, the researchers conclude. \ \n       =================================================================     \n"Investigation of Potential HIV Transmission to the Patients of  an HIV-\nInfected Surgeon" Journal of the American Medical Association (04/14/93) Vol. \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 38\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\n269,  No. 14, P. 1795  (Smith Rogers, Audrey et al.) \n\n     The risk of HIV transmission during surgery is so remote that it  will be \nquantified only by gathering data from multiple,  methodologically similar \ninvestigations, writes Audrey Smith  Rogers et al. of the Johns Hopkins \nUniversity School of Medicine  in Baltimore, Md.  The researchers identified a \ntotal of 1,131  persons in hospital databases who underwent invasive surgical  \nprocedures between 1984 and 1990 and for whom the HIV-positive  surgeon was \nlisted as the operating surgeon.  The AIDS case  registries were reviewed for \nall patients having undergone  invasive procedures and death certificates were \nobtained.  Among  the 1,131 patients, 101 were dead, 119 had no address, 413 \nhad  test results known, and 498 did not respond to the questionnaire. No \nstudy patient name was found in reported AIDS case registries. One newly \ndetected, HIV-positive patient was determined to have  been most probably \ninfected in 1985 during a transfusion.  There  was no HIV transmission in 369 \nperson-hours of surgical exposure, suggesting that HIV transmission to \npatients is unlikely to occur more frequently than once per 1000 person-hours \nof surgical  exposure.  The researchers determined there is no evidence to  \nsuggest that the surgeon failed to adhere to standard  infection-control \nguidelines; over 50 percent of the patients  with invasive procedures chose to \nbe tested, and of those whose  results were revealed, only one person was \nfound to be infected  with HIV.  The study patient's infection was probably \nthe result  of a tainted blood transfusion received in 1985.  As a result,  \nthere is no evidence that the transmission of HIV from the  HIV-positive \nsurgeon to any patient transpired, the researchers  conclude. \n      ==================================================================\n                                April 20, 1993 \n      ==================================================================\n "Drug Concerns to Share AIDS Data" New York Times (04/20/93), P. C10  \n(Kolata, Gina) \n\n     A total of 15 major pharmaceutical companies have decided, in a  highly \nunusual move, to share AIDS drugs and information while  the drugs are \nundergoing early clinical testing.  Dr. Edward  Scolnick, president of the \nMerck Research Laboratory in Rahway,  N.J., arranged the collaboration.  He \nsaid that cooperation  between companies seemed increasingly significant as it \nhad  become clear that combinations of drugs were likely to be more  effective \nin fighting HIV than any drug used alone.  The  researchers are hopeful that \nHIV, when faced with a combination  of several drugs requiring mutation at \ndifferent sites for  resistance to develop, will be unable to evolve all the \nmutations at the same time.  Therefore, several drugs taken together or one \nafter the other could halt the spread of HIV.  Currently, the  drug companies \ndo not know what other drugs their competitors are developing.  The new \nagreement allows companies to routinely  exchange animal data and safety data \non new AIDS drugs.  "An  agreement like this will greatly facilitate \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 39\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\ncompanies' ability to choose the best drug combinations much faster and in a \nmuch more  efficient way," said Scolnick.  He also said that the  \ncollaboration would not violate antitrust laws.  In creating the  agreement, \nMerck spoke frequently to members of AIDS advocacy  groups, including ACT-UP.  \nDr. Daniel Hoth, director of the  division on AIDS at the National Institute \nof Allergy and  Infectious Disease said, "We're delighted to see the  \npharmaceutical industry take this step because we think that  increasing the \ninformation flow will likely accelerate the  discovery of better compounds for \nAIDS."

However, a report in the Lancet demonstrated that AZT should \nnot be used early in the course of disease.  While the CD4 counts of the 877 \npeople given AZT were consistently greater  than those of patients receiving \nonly placebo, the first three  years of follow-up have shown that the \nproportions of people in  the two groups progressing to overt AIDS or even to \ndeath were  not significantly different at roughly 18 percent.  The  \nconclusions are that AZT is not an effective AIDS drug in  HIV-infected \nindividuals, and that CD4 cell count may not be a  reliable proxy for the \nprogression to AIDS in infected people.   But nothing is implied by the study \nof the utility of AZT in the  treatment of those in whom symptoms have already \nappeared--there  is no case for abandoning that treatment, at least on the  \nevidence now available.  It is much more alarming that the CD4  count has \nproven to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in HIV \ninfection.  AIDS researchers should acknowledge  HIV is alive from the \nbeginning of infection and turn it into a  workable assay of the progress of \ndisease.  The general  application of such an assay will probably in itself \nprovide a  better understanding of the pathogenesis of AIDS, concludes  \nMaddox. \n      ================================================================== \n"Infective and Anti-Infective Properties of Breastmilk From  HIV-1-Infected \nWomen" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 914   (Van de Perre, Philippe \net al.) \n\n     A vaccine preparation inducing a persistent immune response of  the IgM \ntype in the mother's body fluids could be valuable to  prevent transmission of \nHIV-1 from mother to child, write  Philippe Van de Perre et al. of the \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 40\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nNational AIDS Control Program in Kigali, Rwanda.  The researchers hypothesized \nthat  transmission of HIV-1 through breastmilk could be favored by the  \npresence of infected cells, by deficiency of anti-infective  substances in \nbreastmilk, or both factors.  A total of 215  HIV-1-infected women were \nenrolled at delivery in Kigali, Rwanda; milk samples were collected 15 days, 6 \nmonths, and 18 months post partum.  HIV-1 IgG, secretory IgA, and IgM were \nassayed by  western blot, for the latter two after removal of IgG with  \nprotein G.  In the 15-day and 6-month samples, the researchers  sought viral \ngenome in milk cells by double polymerase chain  reaction with three sets of \nprimers (gag, pol, and env).  At 15  days, 6 months, and 18 months post \npartum, HIV-1 specific IgG was detected in 95 percent, 98 percent, and 97 \npercent of breastmilk  samples; IgA in 23 percent, 28 percent, and 41 percent; \nand IgM  in 66 percent, 78 percent, and 41 percent.  In children who  survived \nlonger than 18 months the risk of infection was  associated with lack of \npersistence of IgM and IgA in their  mothers' milk.  The presence of HIV-1-\ninfected cells in the milk  15 days post partum was strongly predictive of \nHIV-1 infection in the child by both univariate and multivariate analysis.  \nThe  combination of HIV-1 infected cells in breastmilk and a defective IgM \nresponse was the strongest predictor of infection.  IgM and  IgA anti-HIV-1 in \nbreastmilk may protect against postnatal  transmission of HIV, the researchers \nconclude. \n      ==================================================================    \n                                April 21, 1993 \n      ==================================================================    \n"Firms to Share AIDS Research in Global Venture" Journal of Commerce \n(04/21/93), P. 7A \n\n     A total of fifteen U.S. and European pharmaceutical companies  announced \nTuesday they will swap drug supplies and information on early-stage AIDS \nresearch to hasten the search for combination  therapies to fight HIV \ninfection and AIDS.  The companies said  the unusual move resulted primarily \nfrom the increasing  concentration of AIDS research on combination therapies \nsince  realizing that HIV is likely to develop resistance to every  individual \nAIDS drug.  Edward Scolnick, president of Merck & Co.  Research Laboratories, \nled the collaborative effort that took a  year of negotiations to come \ntogether, said participants.  In  addition to Merck, the other companies \ninvolved in the  Inter-Company Collaboration for AIDS Drug Development are  \nBristol-Myers Squibb Co., Burroughs Wellcome, Glaxo Inc.,  Hoffman-La Roche, \nEli Lilly & Co., Pfizer Inc., Smithkline  Beecham, AB Astra, Du Pont Merck, \nSyntex Inc., Boehringer  Ingelheim, Miles Inc., and Sigma-Tau.

I had been on 3 rounds of\nantibiotics for a resistant sinus infection and my husband had been on\namoxicillin also for a sinus infection.  After six months of this, I went\nto a gynecologist who had me culture my husband seminal fluid.  After 7\ndays incubation he had quite a bit of yeast growth (it was confirmed by\nthe lab).  A round of Nizerol for him cleared both of us.
I heard a short blurb on the news yesterday about an herb called feverfew (?)\nthat some say is good for preventing migraines. I think the news said there\nwere two double-blind studies that found this effective.\n\nDoes anyone know about these studies? Or have experience with feverfew?\nI'm skeptical, but open to trying it if I can find out more about this.\nWhat is feverfew, and how much would you take to prevent migraines (if \nthis is a good idea, that is)? Are there any known risks or side effects\nof feverfew?

Greeting\n\nI am starting work on a project where I am trying to make strain gages\nbond to bone in vivo or a period of several months.  I am currently\nusing hydroxyapaptite back gages, and I have tried M-bonding the gages\nto the bone.  Apart from those two application methods there doesn't\nseem to be much else in the literature.  I have only an engineering \nbackground not medical or biological.  I would be interest in any\nideas about how to stimulte bone growth on the surface of cortical bone.\n\nThanks for oyur help in Advance.

I saw this a few years ago on "Tomorrow's World" (low-brow BBC\ntechnology news program).  The patient is lowered into a bath of\nde-ionized water and carefully positioned.  High intensity pressure\nwaves are generated by an electric spark in the water (you don't get\nelectrocuted because de-ionised water does not conduct).  These waves are\nfocused on the kidneys by a parabolic reflector and cause the stone to\nbreak up.  This is completely painless.\n\nOf course, you then have to get these little bits of gravel through\nthe urethra.  Ouch!\n\nPaul.

In <faUk03m6d0Kq00@amdahl.uts.amdahl.com>,\n	dated 29 Apr 93 15:43:10 GMT,\n\nI'll agree with your wife.  While I was a student, I had doctors remove\nrather surprising amounts of wax from my ears by flushing them out a couple\ntimes, usually because they were examining my ears for some other reason, and\nsaid something like "Gee, you've got a lot of wax in there".  In my case,\nremoval of these large wax buildups did noticeably improve my hearing, and\nI've since gotten in the same habit as your wife of flushing them out with\nwarm water from a little rubber bulb every few months.  You can buy little\nbulbs together with ear drops for this express purpose from the drug store -\nI don't notice that the drops accomplish much of anything.

I have been hearing bad thing about amalgam dental fillings.  Some say\nthe lead/ mercury leeches into your system and this is bad.  And I have\nrecently heard that there is some suspicion that the mercury is a breeding\nground for bacteria that will be resistant to antibiotics.   \n\nMy dentist wants to use an amalgam filling for me in a place where I have\ntwo cavaties in one tooth and wants to use one filling to cover both.\nHe says that composite filling don't hold up well when they are large.\nSo, I would like to know if there are any other choices besides amalgam\nand composite.  And, should I really even be worried about amalgam?  I\nheard that some scandanavian country does not even use them any more- \nis this true.\n\nAny information you can give me will be greatly appreciated.\n\n\nThanks!
Ron, you are absolutely right.  Not all kidney stones have calcium and not \nall calcium stones are calcium-oxalate.  But the vast majority are calcium-\noxalate.  Calcium is just one piece of the puzzle.  I cited that NEJM article \nas a way of pointing out to some of the physicians in this group that \nconventional wisdom is used in medicine, always has been and probably \nalways will be.  If one uses conventional wisdom, there is a chance that \nyou will be wrong.  As long as the error is not going to cause a lot of \ndamage, what's the big deal(why call a physician who gives anti-fungals to \nsinus suffers or GI distress patients a quack?).\n\nOn the kidney stone problem.  I'd want a mineral profile run in a clinical \nchemistry lab.  Balance is much more important than the dietary intake of \ncalcium.  I know that you use an electrical conductance technique to \nmeasure mineral balance in the body.  I know that you don't think that the \nserum levels for minerals are very useful(I agree).  If I can get a good \nnutritional assessment lab setup where I can actually measure the tissue \nreserve for minerals, I'd like to do a collaborative study with you to see \nhow your technique compares with mine.
I have a fairly severe high frequency hearing loss. A recent rough test\nshowed a gently sloping loss to 10-20db down at 1000cps. Then it falls off\na cliff to 70-80dbs down from 1500cps on.  This type of loss is difficult\nto fit. I am currently using some old siemens behind the ear aids which\nkeep me roughly functional, but leave a lot to be desired.\n\nRecently I had an opportunity to test the Widex Q8 behind the ear aids for\nseveral weeks. These have four independent programs which are intended to\nbe customized for different hearing situations and can be reprogramed. I\nfound them to be a definite improvement over my current aids and was about\nto go ahead with them until another local outfit advertised a free trial of\nanother programmable system called ReSound.\n\nUnfortunately I was only able to try the ReSound aids in their office for\nabout 30 minutes and I couldn't compare them 'head to head' with the Widex.\nNevertheless, it did appear to me that they were superior and I was\nimpressed by what I was able to read about the theory behind them which I\nwill give in a separate posting. They also carry the Widex aids and had one\npatient (presumably wealthy) who decided to go ahead and get the ReSound\neven though he had purchased the Widex only 6 months ago.\n\nThe problem is that the ReSound aids are about twice as expensive as the\nWidex and other programmable aids. I could take a trip to Europe on the\ndifference!  Being a lover of bargains and hating to spend money, I am\nhaving a hard time persuading myself to go with the ReSounds. I would\nappreciate any opinions on this and other hearing aids and projections\nabout when and if I might see improvements in technology that aren't quite\nso expensive.
The best thing to do is leave it, it will work its own way out to the surface.\nAnything you stick up there to try and clean it is just going to push the wax\nup against your eardrum and pack it on there solid, thus impairing your\nhearing .
My ENT doctor recommended surgery to fix my sinuses.  I have a very deviated\nnasal septum (probably the result at least partially from several fractures).\nOne side has approximately 10-15% of normal flow.  Of course I have known this\nfor years but recently discovered that I suffer from chronic sinus infection,\ndiscovered during an MRI after a severe migraine.  A CT scan subsequently \nconfirmed the problems in the sinuses.\n\nHe wants to do endoscopic sinus surgery on the ethmoid, maxillary, frontal,\nand sphenoid, along with nasal septoplasty.\n\nHe explained the procedure, and the risks.  What I would like to know is if\nthere is anyone out there who can tell me "I had this surgery, and it helped\nme"?\n\n(I've already heard from a couple who said they had it and it didn't\nreally help them).\n\nI am a moderately severe asthmatic.  ENT doc says large percentage see some\nrelief of their asthma after sinus surgery.  Also he said it is not unheard of\nthat migraines go away after chronis sinusitis is relieved.\n\nI am 42.\n\nAny relevant information is appreciated.\n\nRegards,

It wouldn't be the first time.\n \n Sodium/magnesium/calcium/phosphorus ratios are, in my opinion, still \n the most reliable indicators for the cause, treatment, and prevention \n of kidney stones.\n I, for one, will continue to recommend the most logical changes in\n one's diet or through supplementation to counteract or prevent kidney\n stones of either type; and they definitely won't include an INCREASE\n in calcium if the stones have been identified as being of the calcium\n type and people's chemical analysis confirms that they would benefit\n from a PHOSPHORUS-raising approach instead!\n\n     Ron Roth\n =====================================================================\n --  Internet: rn.3228@rose.com  -  Rosenet: ron roth@rosehamilton  --\n\n * A stone on the ground is better than a stone in the body.
I guess I'm still not clear on what the term "candida bloom" means,\nbut certainly it is well known that thrush (superficial candidal\ninfections on mucous membranes) can occur after antibiotic use.\nThis has nothing to do with systemic yeast syndrome, the "quack"\ndiagnosis that has been being discussed.\n\n\n\nLucky how?  Since a recent article (randomized controlled trial) of\noral yogurt on reducing vaginal candidiasis, I've mentioned to a \nnumber of patients with frequent vaginal yeast infections that they\ncould try eating 6 ounces of yogurt daily.  It turns out most would\nrather just use anti-fungal creams when they get yeast infections.\n\n\nAgain, this just isn't what the systemic yeast syndrome is about, and\nhas nothing to do with the quack therapies that were being discussed.\nThere is some evidence that attempts to reinoculate the GI tract with\nbacteria after antibiotic therapy don't seem to be very helpful in\nreducing diarrhea, but I don't think anyone would view this as a\nquack therapy.
My ENT doctor told me that it is not uncommon for the wife to get a vaginal\nyeast infection after the husband takes antibiotics.  In fact this recently\nhappened to my wife.  Explanation is that the antibiotics kill the yeast's\ncompetition, they then thrive and increased yeast around the penis spread\nthe infection during intercourse.  I was on ceclor for 30 days, then my wife\ngot the yeast.

Sperm deposited near the entrance of the vagina has been known to cause\npregnancy, even in the presence of a hymen. I doubt that sperm could make \nit through a layer of cloth then find the right path to a waiting ovum,\nbut it might be possible.\n\nSo, it is possible for a woman to be both virgin and pregnant.\nAlso, some hymens are sufficiently loose to allow near-normal intercourse\nwithout rupturing. The problem when investigating these phenomenae is,\nof course, getting an honest account of what exactly happened.
Can anybody out there provide me with any advice concerning the\nfollowing two health problems:\n\nFirst, I was recently diagnosed (using a UGI series) as having a\nSchatzki ring and small sliding hiatal hernia. As I understand it,\nthe hernia is a relatively minor problem, though I do occasionally\nhave some nasty heartburn that is probably related to it. The Schatzki\nring, on the other hand, is causing swallowing difficulty. In particular,\nif I'm not careful about eating slowly, and thoroughly chewing food,\nfood occasionally gets "stuck" before reaching my stomach. This results\nin a period of painful spasms as the food attempts to pass the obstruction.\nFortunately, the food has always managed to pass, but this is annoying,\nand causes frequent discomfort.\n\nMy doctor wants to "dilate" the ring using the\nfollowing procedure: use an endoscope to examine the esophagus and stomach\nfor any inflammation, then cut through the ring and dilate it by passing\nsome kind of balloon or something thru the esophagous. I would like to know\nif anyone out there has had this (or a similar) procedure done-if so,\nwas it painful, successful, etc. Also, can anyone  comment on\nsafety, advisability, and success rate of this procedure? Has it become\na common procedure? I am kind of leery of having such an invasive-sounding\nprocedure performed for a (currently) non-threatening condition such as this,\nespecially considering the possible side effects (bleeding, perforation,\nreaction to anesthesia).\n\nThe second issue: for the past 3-4 years I have had a large number\nof "extra" heartbeats. In particular, during the past month or so there\nhas been a dramatic increase-a Holter monitor recently showed 50 PVC's in 24\nhrs, along with a few PAC's. (Many days, there are far more than this,\nhowever-five to ten per hour). All of them were isolated, and the cardiologist\nindicated that such a number was "normal". It certainly doesn't\nfeel normal. In the past there have also been a couple of episodes of\nextended "runs" of these beats, one of which lasted long enough to cause\nsevere light-headedness. I am relatively young (30-ish), thin and in good\nhealth (recent bloodtests were all normal), and do not smoke, use drugs or\ncaffeine, etc. I'm willing to accept the extra beats as "normal", but don't\nwant to ignore them if they might be some kind of warning symptom. The number\nof PVC's seems to increase throughout the day, and with exercise (or something\nas simple as climbing some stairs). Also, if I get up after sitting or lying\ndown for a while, I tend to get a couple of extra beats. Could they possibly\nbe related to the esophagous problems? Both seemed to develop at about the\nsame time.\n\nThanks for any help/advice!
While I don't have an answer for you, I reckon Blaise Pascal is generally\ncredited with inventing the syringe per se.  I don't know much about the\nneedles; however, I do know of a southwest Virginia country doctor who\nsome thrity or more years ago invented, patented, used, and sold a syringe/\nhypodermic needle combination that retracted, injected with the flip of a\ntrigger, then retracted, giving a near-painless injection.  The fellow was\nDr. Daniel Gabriel, and it was termed the Gabriel--somebody else syringe. \nDid you come across that one.  (Plastic, disposable syringes came onto the\nmarket about that time and his product went by the wayside, to my knowledge.)

Recently I've come upon a body of literature which promotes colon\ncleansing as a vital aid to preventive medicine through nutrition.

It sells for over\n$100 from a California-based company.  He also plugs Vitra-Tox\nproducts as his chemical agents of choice: these include volcanic ash,\nsupposedly for its electrical charge, and psyllium powder, for its\nbulkiness.\n\nIf anyone knows anything about colon cleansing theory, its\nparticulars, or the Colema Board and related products, I'd be very\ninterested to hear about research and personal experience.\n\nThis article is crossposted to alt.magick as the issue touches upon\nfasting and cleansing through a "ritual" system of purification.\n\n-- Eli
I've seen people in their forties and fifties become disoriented and\ndemented during hospital stays. In the examples I've seen, drugs were\ndefinitely involved. \n\nMy own father turned into a vegetable for a short time while in the\nhospital. He was fifty-three at the time, and he was on 21 separate\nmedications. The family protested, but the doctors were adamant, telling\nus that none of the drugs interact. They even took the attitude that, if\nhe was disoriented, they should put him on something else as well! With\nthe help of an MD friend of the family, we had all his medication\ndiscontinued. He had a seizure that night, and was put back on one drug.\nTwo days later, he was his old self again. I guess there aren't many\nmedical texts that address the subject of 21-way interactions.\n\nI don't mean this as a cheap shot at the medical profession. It is an\naspect of hospitals that is very frightening to me. Docs seem to believe\nthat, because they have close control of you, it's quite all right to\ntake your bodily equilibria into their own hands. That control reduces\nthe chance that the patient will make a mistake, but health care\nproviders can make mistakes too, and mistakes can be deadly under those\ncircumstances. \n\nI grant you that sometimes there's no choice. Nevertheless, I suggest\nyou procure a list of the drugs your grandmother is getting, and discuss\nit with an independent doc. Her problems may not be the effect of HALDOL\nat all. HALDOL may have been used validly, or it may have been\nprescribed because OTHER medication confused her, and because the\nhospital normally prescribes HALDOL for the confused elderly.\n\nJust my opinion,
Yogurt contains Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. bulgaricus.  L. \nacidophilus is the major bacteria in the vaginal tract and is primarily \nresponsible for keeping the vaginal tract acidic and yeast free.  Most of \nthe commercial yogurt sold in the U.S. has a very low L. acidophilus and L. \nbulgaricus count.  Neither of these bacteria are obligate anaerobes with are \nmuch more important in dealing with the diarrhea problem.  Gordon R. has told \nme through e-mail that he gives his patients L. acidophilus and several \ndifferent obligate anaerobes(which set-up shop in the colon) but he hasn't \ntold me which ones yet.  The Lactobacillus genera are mostly facultative \nanaerobes and will set-up shop where they have access to oxygen if given a \nchance(mouth, anus, sinus cavity and vagina).  Having these good bacteria \naround will greatly decrease the chance of candida blooms in the anal \nregion or the vagina.  I have not proposed a systemic action for candida \nblooms.  I know that others swear that all kinds of symptoms arise from \nthe evil yeast blooms in the body.  I'm not ready to buy that yet.  I do \nbelieve that complications at specific sites(vagina, anal and maybe lower \ncolon, sinus and mouth) can result from antibiotic use which removes the \ncompeting bacteria from these sites and thus lets candida grow unchecked.\nRestoring the right bacterial balance is the best way(in my opinion) to get \nrid of the problem.  Anti-fungals, a low carbohydrate diet and vitamin A \nsupplementation may all help to minimize the local irritation until the \ngood bacteria can take over control of the food supply again and lower the \npH to basically starve the candida out.

Sure there are quacks. There are quacks who don't treat and quacks who\ntreat. One's that refuse to diagnose and ones that diagnose improperly. \nThere are lucky quacks and unlucky quacks. Smart quacks and dumb ones. \n\nThere are people ahead of their time, with unprobable or unproven theories\nand rationals. There are ill-reasoned, absurd, theorists. \n\nSometimes it's hard to tell who's who.  \n\nReading a book of ancient jokes it seems that doctors called other doctors\nquacks in Babylon. \n\nArguments abound when there aren't any firm answers. Plenty of illnesses\naren't, or can't, be diagnosed or treated. But I think it's better to argue\nagainst the theory, as was originally done with postings on candida a month\nor so ago. Stating the facts usually works better than simply asserting an\nopinion about someone's competency. And you can't convince everybody. \n\nSometimes a correct diagnosis\ntakes years for people: they don't run into a doctor who recognizes the\ndisease, they haven't developed something recognizable yet, or they have\nsomething that no one is going to recognize, because it hasn't been\ndescribed yet. Sometimes they get a cure, sometimes the illness wears out,\nsometimes they stumble on an improper diagnosis with the right treatment,\nsometimes they find it's incurable.  \n\nThere is no profit in a patient accepting a hopeless attitude about an \nillness. Unless it's a rock solid diagnosis of terminal disease it's is\nmore like ly that a person will find a cure if they keep looking.

It is more than 99 percent \neffective.\n\n"This drug presents another long-term, effective option for women to prevent \npregnancy," said FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler, M.D. "As an injectable, \ngiven once every three months, Depo Provera eliminates problems related to \nmissing a daily dose."\n\nDepo Provera is available in 150 mg. single dose vials from doctors and \nclinics and must be given on a regular basis to maintain contraceptive \nprotection. If a patient decides to become pregnant, she discontinues the \ninjections.\n\nAs with any such products, FDA advises patients to discuss the benefits and \nrisks of Depo Provera with their doctor or other health care professional \nbefore making a decision to use it.\n\nDepo Provera's effectiveness as a contraceptive was established in extensive \nstudies by the manufacturer, the World Health Organization and health agencies \nin other countries. U.S. clinical trials, begun in 1963, also found Depo \nProvera effective as an injectable contraceptive.\n\nThe most common side effects are menstrual irregularities and weight gain. In \naddition, some patients may experience headache, nervousness, abdominal pain, \ndizziness, weakness or fatigue. The drug should not be used in women who have \nacute liver disease, unexplained vaginal bleeding, breast cancer or blood \nclots in the legs, lungs or eyes.\n\nThe labeling advises doctors to rule out pregnancy before prescribing the \ndrug, due to concerns about low birth weight in babies exposed to the drug. \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nRecent data have also demonstrated that long-term use may contribute to \nosteoporosis. The manufacturer will conduct additional research to study this \npotential effect.\n\nDepo Provera was Developed in the 1960s and has been approved for \ncontraception in many other countries. The UpJohn Company of Kalamazoo, Mich., \nwhich will market the drug under the name, Depo Provera Contraceptive \nInjection, first submitted it for approval in the United States in the 1970s. \nAt that time, animal studies raised questions about its potential to cause \nbreast cancer.

Sullivan, M.D. "The effort \nto accelerate FDA review for these drugs has been a long-term commitment and \nindeed a hallmark of this administration." \n\nThese rules establish procedures for the Food and Drug Administration to \napprove a drug based on "surrogate endpoints" or markers. They apply when the \ndrug provides a meaningful benefit over currently available therapies. Such \nendpoints would include laboratory tests or physical signs that do not in \nthemselves constitute a clinical effect but that are judged by qualified \nscientists to be likely to correspond to real benefits to the patient. \n\nUse of surrogate endpoints for measurement of drug efficacy permits approval \nearlier than if traditional endpoints -- such as relief of disease symptoms or \nprevention of disability and death from the disease -- are used. \n\nThe new rules provide for therapies to be approved as soon as safety and \neffectiveness, based on surrogate endpoints, can be reasonably established. \nThe drug's sponsor will be required to agree to continue or conduct \npostmarketing human studies to confirm that the drug's effect on the surrogate \nendpoint is an indicator of its clinical effectiveness. \n\nOne new drug -- zalcitabine (also called ddC) -- was approved June 19, using a \nmodel of this process, for treating the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, the \ncause of AIDS. \n\nAccelerated approval can also be used, if necessary, when FDA determines that \na drug, judged to be effective for the treatment of a disease, can be used \nsafely only under a restricted distribution plan. \n\n"The new rules will help streamline the drug development and review process \nwithout sacrificing goad science and rigorous FDA oversight," said FDA \ncommissioner David A. Kessler, M.D. "While drug approval will be accomplished \nfaster, these drugs and biological products must still meet safety and \neffectiveness standards required by law." \n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 16\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nThe new procedures also allow for a streamlined withdrawal process if the \npostmarketing studies do not verify the drug's clinical benefit, if there is \nnew evidence that the drug product is not shown to be safe and effective, or \nif other specified circumstances arise that necessitate expeditious withdrawal \nof the drug or biologic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 17\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\n\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n                                   Articles\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n               Research Shows Promise for Preventing or Slowing\n                       Blindness due to Retinal Disease\n\n                   National Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation\n\n        Neutrophilic Factors Rescue Photoreceptor Cells in Animal Tests\n\n     Baltimore, MD - Researchers at the University of California San Francisco \nand Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. [NASDAQ: REGN] have discovered that \ncertain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors can \nprevent the degeneration of light-sensing cells in the retina of the eye. The \ndegeneration of these cells, known as photoreceptors, is a major cause of \nvisual impairment \n     This research, published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of \nthe National Academy of Science (PNAS), holds promise for people who may lose \ntheir sight due to progressive retinal degeneration -- currently, no drug \ntreatment for retinal degeneration exists. It is estimated that 2.5 million \nAmericans have severe vision loss due to age-related macular degeneration and \n100,000 Americans are affected by retinitis pigmentosus, a hereditary disease \nthat causes blindness. In addition, each year more than 15,000 people undergo \nsurgical procedures to repair retinal detachments and other retinal traumas. \n     The research was funded in part by the RP (Retinitis Pigmentosa) \nFoundation Fighting Blindness, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and the National Eye \nInstitute. It was conducted by Drs. Matthew M. LaVail, Kazuhiko Unoki, Douglas \nYasurnura, Michael T. Matthes and Roy H. Steinberg at UCSF, arld Dr. C;eorge \nYancoooulos, Regeneron's Vice President for Discovery. Regeneron holds an \nexclusive license for this research from UCSF.\n     In the research described in the PNAS , a light-damage model was used to \nassess the survival-promoting activity of a number of naturally occurring \nsubstances. Experimental rats were exposed to constant light for one week. \nEyes that had not been treated with an effective factor lost most of their \nphotoreceptor cells -- the rods and cones of the retina -- after light \nexposure. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Ciliary Neurotrophic \nFactor (CNTF) were particularly effective in this model without causing \nunwanted side effects; other factors such as Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and \nInsulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1) were not effective in these experiments. \n     Discussing the research, Dr. Jesse M. Cedarbaum, Regeneron's Director of \nClinical Research, said, "BDNF's ability to rescue neurons in the retina that \nhave been damaged by light exposure may hold promise for the treatment of age-\nrelated macular degeneration, one of the leading causes of vision impairment, \nand for retinal detachment. Following detachment, permanent vision loss may \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nresult frorn the death of detached retinal cells. It is possible that BDNF \ncould play a role in rescuing those cells once the retina has been reattached \nsurgically." \n     "Retinitis pigmentosa is a slowly progressing disease that causes the \nretina to degenerate over a period of years or even decades. Vision decreases \nto a small tunnel of sight and can result in total blindness. It is our hope \nthat research on growth factors will provide a means to slow the progression \nand preserve useful vision throughout life," stated Jeanette S. Felix, Ph.D., \nDirector of Science for the RP Foundation Fighting Blindness. \n     In addition to the work described , Regeneron is developing BDNF in \nconjunction with Aingen Inc. [NASDAQ:AMGN] as a possible treatment for \nperipheral neuropathies associated with diabetes and cancer chemotherapy, \nmotor neuron diseases, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. By \nitself, Regeneron is testing CNTF in patients with arnyotrophic lateral \nsclerosis (commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease). \n     Regeneron Pharlnaceuticals, Inc., based in Tarrytown, New York, is a \nleader in the discovery and development of biotechnology-based compounds for \nthe treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, peripheral neuropathies and nerve \ninjuries, which affect more than seven million Americans. Drs. LaVail and \nSteinberg of UCSF are consultants to Regeneron.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 19\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\n                 Affluent Diet Increases Risk Of Heart Disease\n\n                          Research Resources Reporter\n                           written by Mary Weideman\n                                 Nov/Dec 1992\n                         National Institutes of Health\n\n\n     High-fat, high-calorie diets rapidly increase risk factors for coronary \nheart disease in native populations of developing countries that have \ntraditionally consumed diets low in fat.  These findings, according to \ninvestigators at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, have \nserious implications for public health in both industrialized and developing \ncountries. \n     "This study demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease and \nhave higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels.  It shows also the \nimportance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase body \nweight, thereby leading to a whole host of other health problems in developing \ncountries and affluent nations as well," explains principal investigator Dr. \nWilliam E. Connor, head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid \nmetabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University. \n     Over the past 25 years Dr. Connor and his team have characterized the \nfood and nutrient intakes of the Tara humara Indians in Mexico, while \nsimultaneously documenting various aspects of Tarahumara lipid metabolism.  \nThese native Mexicans number approximately 50,000 and reside in the Sierra \nMadre Occidental Mountains in the state of Chihuahua.  The Tarahumaras have \ncoupled an agrarian diet to endurance racing.  Probably as a result, coronary \nheart disease, which is so prevalent in Western industrialized nations, is \nvirtually non existent in their culture.  Loosely translated, the name \nTarahumara means "fleet of foot," reflecting a tribal passion for betting on \n"kickball" races, in which participants run distances of 100 miles or more \nwhile kicking a machete-carved wooden ball.\n     The typical Tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans, tortillas, \nand pinole, a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water, \ntogether with squash and gath ered fruits and vegetables.  The Tara humaras \nalso eat small amounts of game, fish, and eggs.  Their food contains \napproximately 12 percent of total calories as fat of which the majority (69 \npercent) is of vegetable origin.  Dietician Martha McMurry, a coinvestigator \nin the study, describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients while \nlow in cholesterol and fat.\n     The Tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of 121 mg/ dL, \nlow-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels of 72 mg/dl, and high-density \nlipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels of 32 to 42 mg/dl.  All of those values \nare in the good, low-risk range, according to the researchers.  Elevated \ncholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels are considered risk factors for heart \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 20\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\ndisease.  HDL-cholesterol is considered beneficial.  In previous studies the \nTarahumaras had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease, although \nable to respond to high-cholesterol diets with elevations in total and LDL-\ncholesterol. \n     Clinical Research Center dietitian McMurry and coinvestigator Maria \nTeresa Cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a Jesuit mission school \nbuilding near a community hospital in the small village of Sisoguichi.  Food \nwas weighed, cooked, and fed to the study participants under the \ninvestigators' direct supervision, ensuring that subjects ate only food \nstipulated by the research protocol.  Fasting blood was drawn twice weekly, \nand plasma samples were frozen and shipped to Dr. Connors laboratory for \ncholesterol, triglyceride, and lipoprotein analyses.  Regular measurements \nincluded participant body weight, height, and triceps skin fold thickness.  \nThirteen Tarahumaras, five women and eight men, including one adolescent, were \nfed their native diet for 1 week, followed by 5 weeks of an "affluent" diet. \n     "In this study we went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was 40 \npercent of total calories.  This is the prototype of the holiday diet that \nmany Americans consume a diet high in fat, sugar, and cholesterol, low in \nfiber," elaborates Dr. Conners. Such dietary characteristics are reflected in \nthe cholesterol-saturation index, or CSI, recently devised research dietitian \nSonja Conner working with Dr. Connor.  "The CSI is a single number that \nincorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat in \nthe diet.  CSI indicates the diet's potential to elevate the cholesterol \nlevel, particularly the LDL," Dr. Connor explains.  The Tarahumaran diet \naverages a very low CSI of 20; Dr. Connor's "affluent" diet used in the study \nranks a CSI of 149. \n     The experimental design of this study reflects the importance of \nestablishing baseline plasma lipid levels, typical of the native diet, before \nexposing subjects to the experimental diet.  The standard curve relating \ndietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off, or \nplateau, for consumption of large amounts of fat.  Changes in dietary fat \nand/or cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma levels.  "You \nmust have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to put \ninto the experimental diet.  The Framingham study, for example, did not \ndiscriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart disease \nbecause the diet was already high in fat.  All subjects were already eating on \na plateau," Dr. Connor says. \n     After 5 weeks of consuming the "affluent" diet, the subjects' mean plasma \ncholesterol levels had in creased by 31 percent, primarily in the LDL \nfraction, which rose 39 percent.  HDL-cholesterol increased by 31 per cent, \nand LDL to HDL ratios changed therefore very little.  Plasma triglyceride \nlevels increased by 18 percent, and subjects averaged an 8-pound gain in \nweight.  According to Dr. Connor, lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon, \nyielding nearly the same results after 7 days of affluent diet as after 35 \ndays. \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 21\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\n     The increase in HDL carries broad dietary implications for industrialized \nnations.  "We think HDL-cholesterol increased because we increased the amount \nof dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous Tarahumara metabolic \nstudy.  In that study we saw no change in HDL levels after raising the dietary \ncholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption.  \nIn the present study we increased fat intake to 40 percent of the total \ncalories.  We reached the conclusion in the Tarahumara study that HDL reflects \nthe amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary \ncholesterol.  HDL must increase to help metabolize the fat, and it increased \nquite a bit in this study," Dr. Connor explains.\n     Low HDL in the Tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor of \ncoronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts of \nfat or cholesterol.  HDL remains an important predictor to Americans because \nof their usual high fat intake. \n     Dr. Connor recommends a diet for Americans that contains less than 20 \npercent of total calories as fat, less than 100 mg of cholesterol, and a CSI \naround 20, varying in accordance with caloric needs.  Such a diet is low in \nmeat and dairy fat, high in fiber.  Dr. Connor also comments on recent \nsuggestions that Americans adopt a "Mediterranean-style" diet.  "The original \nMediterranean diet, in its pristine state, consisted of a very low intake of \nfat and very few animal and dairy products.  We are already eating a lot of \nmeat and dairy products.  Simply to continue that pattern while switching to \nolive oil is not going to help the situation." \n     The World Health Organization (WHO) is focusing much attention on the \nemergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societies \nundergoing technological development.  Dr. Connor says that coronary heart \ndisease starts with a given society's elite, who typically eat a different \ndiet than the average citizen.  "If the pattern of afluence increases, the \nentire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease, \nwhich places a termendous health care burden on a society.  WHO would like the \ndeveloping countries to prevent coronary heart disease, so they can \nconcentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on public \nhealth measures to improve general well-being, rather than paying for \nunnecessary, expensive medical technology," Dr. Connors says.\n     "The overall implication of this study is that humans can readily move \ntheir plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a high-risk range within a \nvery short time by an affluent, excessive diet.  The present rate of coronary \nheart disease in the United States is 30 percent less than it was 20 years \nago, so a lot has been accomplished.  We are changing rapidly," he concludes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 22\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\n\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n                             General Announcments\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n        Publications for Health Professionals Available from NCI (1/93)\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the following materials are provided free of charge by \ncalling the NCI's Publication Ordering Service, 1-800-4-CANCER.

I decided to come back and amend this so it quotes me and has added\ncomments...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbefore you had a pat of butter, now you need a medium apple (probably microwave\nthe body will make fat out of carbohydrates if it needs them. Third, your\nbody, like most peoples, wasn't bred to live on a high fat, modern diet.\nIf you read texts about ancient and primative people you will read about\nthe luxury of eating fat, how people enjoyed it. This was because it was so\nrare. Even cows didn't put out nearly the amount of butterfat in milk that\nthey do now.  \n\n\n\n\nare pregnant. If you are lucky you can work on getting rid of it after the\nbaby. (It is said that doctors have less gallbadder surgery than the rest\nof the population, a good part of it is that they are willing to do the\ndieting, etc that helps them avoid surgery. Also, I don't think the surgery\nlets a person go back to eating a high fat diet. )
For a very long time I've had a problem with feeling really awful\nwhen I try to get up in the morning.  My sleep latency at night is also\npretty long,  ranging from 30 min to an hour.  I get about 7 hours of\nbedtime (maybe 6 of actual sleep) a night and more on the weekends.  I\nwill spend two or three hours laying in bed after this if I can,  because\nI feel so tired when I wake up,  even more tired than I was when I\nwent to bed,  which is usually too tired to work.\n\n	Anyway,  I recently had a really bad flu,  so I called a friend to\nget me some cough syrup with both an expectorant and a nasal decongestant;\nbut he got Vicks formula 44M which has everything but an expectorant.  So\nI used that anyway,  and the three nights I used it,  I fell asleep rapidly\nand felt that I got really good quality sleep -- that is,  I actually\nfelt refreshed the next morning.\n\n	So,  I am now trying to look into,  both in the literature and\nexperimentally,  the use of antihistamines as sleep aids,  since I am\npresuming that it was the antihistamine that caused the effect.  The\nantihistamine in Vicks formula 44 is Chloriphenamine maleate,  so I bought\nsome generic tablets of that,  and tried one last night and didn't\nnotice any improvement.  I might try one with a little alcohol (about\n1 beer) to see if it is a synergism effect.  Also,  library research\nseems to show that Benadryl is the antihistamine with the strongest\nsedative effect of what is availible OTC.  So I might also buy a generic\nform of that and try that;  the PDR seems to suggest that 50 mg is a good\ndosage level to try.\n\n	For other medical information,  I have allergies but rarely have\nan allergic reaction living in New Mexico.  I also have chronically dry\neyes,  which get horrible if I try to use most underarm deoderants.  I did\nguess that my problem might be caused by hypoglycemia,  so I made some\nchanges in my diet consistent with that,  and it didn't help,  so I\nwent back to a normal diet (Pretty diverse,  also taking vitamin supplements)
-*----\n\nI pity those who hope that medical knowledge can resolve issues\nsuch as this.  This issue has been rehashed in sci.med time and\ntime again.  The bottom line is this: in normal circumstances,\nboth the medical advantages of and the medical risks of\ncircumcision are minor.  This means that the decision is left to\nthe religious, cultural, ethical, and aesthetic mores of the\nparents, at best, or to the habit of the concerned hospital or\ncaregivers, at worst. \n\nAs (prospective) parents, you should do what you want in this\nregard and not worry about it too much.  In terms of decisions\nyou make for your child, it will have far less importance than\nmany -- such as which schools you choose -- that most parents\nthink about only a little. \n\nThis question will undoubtedly push the buttons of people who\nfeel that the decision to circumcise your infant or not is a\nmomentous medical decision.  It is not.

I'm interested in this from the other angle: what antihistamine can I\ntake at bedtime for relief of allergies, with the assurance that its\nsedative effect will have completely worn off by the next morning, but\npreferably with the anti-allergy effect lasting longer?\n\nI'm thinking mainly of OTC products. Which has the least duration of\nsedative action: Benadryl, Chlor-Trimeton, or what?\nNote that I'm asking about duration, not intensity.

Actually I am entering vet school next year, but the question is \nrelevant for med students too.\n\nMemorizing large amounts has never been my strong point academically.\nSince this is a major portion of medical education -- anatomy, \nhistology, pathology, pharmacology, are for the most part mass \nmemorization -- I am a little concerned.  As I am sure most \nmed students are.\n\nCan anyone suggest techniques for this type of memorization?  I \nhave had reasonable success with nemonics and memory tricks like\nthinking up little stories to associate unrelated things.  But I have\nnever applied them to large amounts of "data".\n\nHas anyone had luck with any particular books, memory systems, or\ncheap software?   \n\nCan you suggest any helpful organizational techniques?  Being an\nolder student who returned to school this year, organization (another\none of my weak points) has been a major help to my success.\n\nPlease no griping about how all you have to do is "learn" the material\nconceptually.  I have no problem with that, it is one of my strong \npoints.  But you can't get around the fact that much of medicine is\nrote memorization.

I'm a fellow applicant and my situation is not too much better.  I applied\nto about 20 schools, got two interviews, got one offer, and am waiting to\nhear from the other school.\n\nLet me be honest about my experiences and impressions about the medical\nschool admissions process.  Numbers (GPA, MCATs) are not everything, \nbut they are probably more important than anything else.  In fact, some\nschools screen out applicants based on these numbers and never even look\nat your other qualities.  Of course, when this happens, don't expect a refund\non your $50 application fee.\n\nBut, the fact that you got four interviews tells me that you have the numbers\nand are very well qualified academically.  You mentioned one response, was it\nan acceptance, denial, or wait-list?  If I assume the worst, that it was a\ndenial, then you still have a great probability of acceptance somewhere.  How\ndid your interviews go?\n\nAs for how long you have to wait, I've called a few schools who never contacted\nme for anything.  Many of them told me that the interview season for them was\nover and that if I haven't heard by now, I can assume a denial.  Many rejection\nletters are not sent out until May or as late as June.  But some schools are\nstill interviewing. I really don't think you should worry.  Don't become\nfixated on the mailbox, go out, have fun, be very proud of yourself.\n\nWhat do people think of the medical school admissions process?  I had a very\nmediocre GPA, but high MCAT scores, and I have been working as a software\nengineer for two years.  I majored in Computer Science at Stanford.  Still,\nI think the profile of the person who has the best chance of getting admitted\nis something like this:\n\nVERY IMPORTANT\n--------------\nGPA:	3.5 or better\nMCAT:   top 15% in all subject\n\nMEDIUM IMPORTANCE\n-----------------\nWriting/Speaking ability\nMaturity\nMotivation for going into medicine\nActivities\n\nLESS IMPORTANT\n--------------\nCollege or University\nMajor\nWork experience\nAnything else you want them to know\n\n\nAnyway, you are in good shape.  I think admissions committees are bound in\nmany ways by the numbers, but would like very much to understand each\nperson as an individual.  Sometimes thats just not practical.  But getting \nfour interviews is an indicator that you have the numbers.  Hopefully, you\nwere able to impress them with your character.
Candida can do that to you. :-)  Gordon, I think that the best clinical \ntrial for candida blooms would involve giving women with chronic vaginal \ncandida blooms L. Acidophilus orally and see it it can decrease the \nfrequency and extent of candida blooms in the vagina since most of the \ncandida seems to be migrating in from the anal region and L. acidophilus \nshould be able keep the candida in check if it can make it through the \nintestinal tract and colonize in the anus where it will have access to \noxygen(just like it does in the vagina).  As much stuff as there is in the \nlay press about L. acidophilus and vaginal yeast infections, I'm really \namazed that someone has not done a clinical trial yet to check it out.\n\n\nThe calcium and kidney stone story is not a good reason to throw all \nconventional wisdom out the window.  Where would medicine be if \nconventional wisdom had not been used to develop many of the standard \nmedical practices that could not be confirmed through clinical trials?\nThe clinical trial is a very new arrival on the medical scene(and a very \nimportant one).  The lack of proof that reinnoculation with good bacteria \nafter antibiotic use is important to the health of a patient is no reason \nto dismiss it out-of-hand, especially if reinnoculation can be done cleaply \nand safely(like it is in animal husbandry).

How is it that placebos are legal?  It would seem to me that if, as a patient,\nyou purchase a drug you've been prescribed and it's just sugar (or whatever),\nthere's a few legal complications that arise:\n\n	1. \nIf you have been diagnosed with a condition and you aren't given accepted\ntreatment for it, it seems like intentional medical malpractice.\n\n	2.\nA placebo should fall, legally, under the label of quackery (why not?)\n\n	3.\nGetting what you pay for.  (Deceptive "bait and switch" to an extreme...).  False\nadvertising  (what if McDonalds didn't put 100% pure beef in their hamburgers?)\n\n\n	So I'm mystified.  Are these assumptions erred?  If they aren't, why the\nhell can a doctor knowingly or unknowingly prescribe a placebo?
=>Yup.  The demonstration to which you refer consists of placing a leaf between\n=>the plates, and taking a Kirlian photograph of it.  You then cut off part of\n=>the leaf, put the top plate back on, and take another Kirlian photograph.  You\n=>see pretty much the same image in both cases.  Turns out the effect isn't\n=>nearly so striking if you take the trouble to clean the plates between\n=>photographs.  Seems that the moisture from the leaf that you left on the place\n=>conducts electricity.  Surprise, surprise!\n=\n=	This is true, but it's not quite the whole story.  There were \n=	actually some people who were more careful in their methodology\n=	who also replicated the 'phantom leaf effect.'\n\nYou can also replicate the effect with a rock:  Take your first Kirlian\nphotograph.  Then moisten one edge of the rock.  Lo! and behold!

I'm a nursing student, and I would like to respond to #66966 on haldol\nand the elderly.\nMessage-ID: <25APR199316225142@fsphy1.physics.fsu.edu>\nOrganization: Florida State University - School of Higher Thought\nNews-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.4-b1  \n\nFirst, I'm sorry to hear that you have had to see your grandmother go\nthrough this.  I know it has to have been tough.\n\nThere are many things that can cause long term confusion in elderly\nadults.  The change in environment can cause problems.  Anesthetic agents\ncan cause confusion because the body cannot clear the medicines out of\nthe body as easily.  In addition, medications and interactions between\nmedications can cause confusion.\n\nAs far as whether or not haldol can have long lasting effects even after\nthe drug has been discontinued, I do not know.  I have not _seen_ anything\nto that effect.  However, I also had not been looking for that information.\nI can see what I can find...\n\nI can tell you that haldol is an antipsychotic drug, and, according to\nthe Nursing93 Drug handbook, it is "Especially useful for agitation\nassociated with senile dementia"  (p. 400).  It also should not be \ndiscontinued abruptly.  It did not say anything about long lasting\neffects.\n\nBecause so many things can cause confusion, it is hard for me to know\nwhat else was going on at the time; if I had more history, i might be able\nto answer you better.  If you want to send me e-mail with more information,\nI would be happy to try to  help you piece together what might have\nhappened.

I read a great book about eye dominance several years ago. So there is one\nbook out there..at least one :).\n\nThere were several types of eye dominance.

One of the things that prompted me to get the colonic was\nseeing my 90 year old grandmother chair ridden from colitis (?) from\nyears of indulgence.\n\nNot everything that goes in comes out, and personaly I don't mind giving\nmy body a hand once in a while.\n\nJust my experience,\n\nGeorge Paap

very good.
My mother has been advised to have a bone scan performed?  What is this\nprocedure for, and is it painful?  She's been having leg and back pain\nwhich her GP said was sciatica.  Her oncologist listened to her symptoms\nand said that it didn't sound like sciatica, and she should get a bone\nscan.
agents\nof\n\nThe original poster did not say why his mother had been in hospital\nbut I can answer a few general points.\n\nElderly patients may exhibit a marked difficulty in coping after\nbeing in hospital for a few days. The drastic change of environment\nwill often unmask how marginally they have been coping at home. Even\nyoung people find the change unsettling.\n\nThough we have thought that this decrement in function after - say -\nanaesthesia and surgery for a fractured hip (a common event in the\nelderly) was due to anaesthesia there is good evidence that the\nchange of situation is much more important. Some hospitals have\ntried a 'rapid transit' system for hip fractures, aiming to have the\npatient back at home within 24 hours of admission. The selection of\nthe anaesthetic has no effect on the ability to discharge these\npatients early.\n\nAnaesthetists who work with the elderly (which is almost all of us)\ngenerally take care to tailor the choice and dose of drugs used to\nthe individual patient. Even so, there is some evidence that full\nmental recovery may take a surprisingly long time to return. This is\nthe sort of thing which is detected by setting quite difficult\ntasks, not the gross change that the original poster noted.\n\nHaloperidol (Haldol TM) is a long acting drug. The plasma half life\nof the drug is up to 35 hours. If the decanoate (a sort of slow\nrelease formulation) is used it may be weeks. The elderly are\nsensitive to haloperidol for a number of reasons. Without knowing\nmore it is hard to comment.
eyes?\n\nBy looking at the iris (iridology) - virtually nothing.\n\nLooking at the retina allows one to visualise the small blood\nvessels and is helpful in assessing various systemic diseases,\nhypertension and diabetes for example.
Actually, severe headaches due to stopped up sinuses (plugged ostia) are\npossible, and sinus surgery which widens the ostia - from the normal 2\nmm to about 10 mm - should relieve this.  There are non-surgical ways,\nhowever, to keep the ostia open (however, in a few individuals, their\nostia are naturally very small), and Dr. Ivker's book talks about this.\nThe underlying cause of chronic sinusitis is NOT cured by this kind of\nsinus surgery, though.\n\nAbout asthma, that's a little more controversial.  Dr. Ivker, in his book,\n"Sinus Survival", *speculates* (and says it's not proven), that many cases\nof asthma are triggered by chronic sinusitis due to the excessive drainage\n(postnasal drip) from the sinuses.  He's had many patients who've found\nrelief from asthma when the chronic sinusitis is reduced or eliminated -\nnot clinical proof, but compelling anecdotal information of this speculation.\n\nBefore doing any sinus surgery, first get THE BOOK - it discusses surgery,\nas well as a good non-surgical treatment program for chronic sinusitis.\n\nJon Noring\n\n-- \n\nCharter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.

First off, if I'm not mistaken, only hibernating animals have brown fat,\nnot humans.\n\nSecondly, your description sounds just like 2,4-dinitrophenol.  This is an\nuncoupler of respiratory chain oxidative phosphorylation.  Put in layman's\nterms, it short-circuits the mitochondria, causing food energy to be\nturned into heat.\n\n2,4-DNP was popular in the 1930's for weight reduction.  In controlled\namounts, it raises body temperature as the body compensates for the\nreduced amount of useful energy available.  It is very dangerous.\nIt would be wiser to adjust to your present body form, rather than\nplay around with 2,4-DNP.

She said even common ear infections frequently seen in\nchildren are becoming resistant to antibiotic treatment.\n\n"Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious  diseases\nwould soon be eliminated as a public health problem, infectious diseases\nremain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness\nand death in the United States," the CDC said.\n\nIt  cited  the  emergence since the 1970s of a "myriad" of newly\nidentified pathogens and syndromes, such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, a\ndeadly bacterial infection; the hepatitis C virus; HIV, the virus that\ncauses AIDS; Legionnaires disease; Lyme disease; and toxic shock syndrome.\n\n"The incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control,\nsuch as cholera, malaria and tuberculosis, have increased in many areas,"\nthe CDC said.  It said efforts at control and prevention have been\nundermined by drug resistance.\n\n=====*=====\n\nSOURCE:  WALL STREET JOURNAL\nREFERENCE: 04/15/93, pB1\nHEADLINE: Lyme-Disease Ruling Raises Liability Issues\n\nThe tick that causes Lyme disease may have found a new way to cause\ndamage: legal liability.\n\nA federal judge's decision holding a property owner liable for not\ndoing enough to protect workers from Lyme disease is getting as much\nattention as the latest medical study on the disease, a flu-like\nillness that can cause severe physical and mental disabilities and in\nrare instances death. The decision last week has put property owners\non notice that they may have to do more than protect themselves from\nthe ticks-they also may have to protect themselves from litigation if\nsomeone becomes infected while on the property.\n\nThe decision by U.S. District Judge Robert J. Ward in New York came\nafter a week-long trial in a case involving four track workers for the\nLong Island Railroad. Judge Ward found that the workers contracted the\ndisease after they were bitten by ticks while on the job. He ordered\nthe New York state-owned commuter line to pay the workers more than\n$560,000 to compensate for pain and suffering, in addition to medical\nexpenses and lost wages.\n\nSummer camps, schools, companies with facilities in rural or\nsemirural areas, and homeowners who rent to vacationers are among the\ngroups that need to be worried about this ruling, says Stephen L.\nKass, an attorney at New York law firm Berle, Kass & Case, who wrote a\nlegal article three years ago warning property owners of the potential\nliability. Even a family that invites friends over for a backyard\nbarbecue might be potentially liable.\n\nLawsuits for insect bites, while rare, aren't unheard-of. A summer\nvacationer in Southampton, N.Y., last year sued the owner of the home\nshe rented, claiming that a tick on the property gave her Rocky\nMountain spotted fever. In 1988, also on Long Island, a jury ordered\nan outdoor restaurant to pay more than $3 million to a patron who was\nstung by a bee, causing an allergic reaction and permanent\nquadriplegia. The judge later threw out the award, citing no evidence\nthat a beehive was near the restaurant.\n\nBut lawyers say that the attention to Lyme disease throughout the\ncountry -- it's most prevalent in New England, the Middle Atlantic\nstates, Wisconsin, Minnesota and the Northwest -- may make this\nparticular insect bite a particularly litigious one.\n\nThe illness already has proved to be a source of controversy in the\ncourtroom over such issues as the type of medical care insurers will\ncover and medical malpractice claims against doctors for not\ndiagnosing the disease.\n\nLawyers say worker's-compensation claims related to Lyme disease\nhave become common in some states in recent years. Payments in\nworker's-compensation cases, however, are limited to medical costs and\nlost earnings.\n\nThe case before Judge Ward dealt with a potentially much more\nlucrative avenue for damages, because it involved the question of\nnegligence. Unlike the worker's compensation process, the law governing\ninjuries to rail workers allows for a finding of negligence and, as a\nresult, for additional payments for pain and suffering. Property\nowners and lawyers say that negligence claims can be made in many\nother situations where people are exposed to the ticks that carry the\ndisease.\n\nIra M. Maurer, a partner at New York law firm Elkind, Flynn &\nMaurer, who represented the rail workers, says the decision will help\nto establish "the duty of all sorts of property owners to protect\nagainst Lyme disease."\n\nLawyers caution that despite Judge Ward's decision, winning a\nlawsuit for damages caused by Lyme disease may prove difficult. For\none thing, victims have to demonstrate that they have pinned down when\nand where they got the tick bite. Judge Ward found that the plaintiffs\nin the railroad case got Lyme disease while working on property owned\nby the railroad, even though none of the men remembered being bitten.\nThe workers, who weren't outdoorsmen likely to be exposed elsewhere to\nthe insects, said they saw ticks in the high grass that surrounded\nsome work sites.\n\nA spokeswoman for the railroad says that there was no proof that\nthe four men were bitten while on the job and that the railroad is\nconsidering an appeal. The railroad also disputes Judge Ward's finding\nthat it didn't do enough to protect employees. The spokeswoman says\nthe railroad provides track workers with insect repellent and special\npants to protect against bug bites.\n\nDebate in the scientific community over Lyme disease could open up\nsome legal defenses for property owners, such as questioning whether a\nvictim actually has the disease rather than some other illness.\nEarlier this week, the Journal of the American Medical Association\nreported that doctors overly diagnose patients as having Lyme disease.\nAnd damages awarded to a victim also might be influenced by medical\ndisputes over the degree of harm that Lyme disease causes.\n\nBecause of health and safety concerns, some groups and companies\nalready take special measures to protect against Lyme disease. Last\nyear, at its headquarters in Franklin Lakes, N.J., Becton, Dickinson &\nCo. began using Damminix, a pesticide made by EcoHealth Inc. of Boston\nthat is designed to kill ticks carrying the disease. The medical-\nsupply company's headquarters include a 120-acre park, and the company\nwas worried that employees who walk on its trails for recreation might\nget infected.\n\nRuth Lister, a spokeswoman for the American Camping Association in\nIndianapolis, says that many youth camps accredited by her\norganization also have begun to check children for ticks. And Carole\nKatz, a member of the board of the Fire Island Pines Property Owners\nAssociation, says her group spends $30,000 each year to treat their\n100-acre site off the coast of New York with the tick-killing\npesticide.\n\n=====*=====\n\nTITLE: Urinary dysfunction in Lyme disease.\nAUTHORS: Chancellor MB; McGinnis DE; Shenot PJ; Kiilholma P; Hirsch IH,\nDepartment of Urology, Jefferson Medical College, Thomas Jefferson\nUniversity, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\nREFERENCE: J Urol 1993 Jan; 149 (1): 26-30\n\nLyme disease, which is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, is\nassociated with a variety of neurological sequelae.  We describe 7 patients\nwith neuro-borreliosis who also had lower urinary tract dysfunction.\nUrodynamic evaluation revealed detrusor hyperreflexia in 5 patients and\ndetrusor areflexia in 2.  Detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia was not\nnoted on electromyography in any patient.  We observed that the urinary tract\nmay be involved in 2 respects in the course of Lyme  disease: 1) voiding\ndysfunction may be part of neuro-borreliosis and 2) the spirochete may\ndirectly invade the urinary tract.  In 1 patient bladder infection by the\nLyme spirochete was documented on biopsy.  Neurological and urological\nsymptoms in all patients were slow to resolve and convalescence was\nprotracted.  Relapses of active Lyme disease and residual neurological\ndeficits were common.  Urologists practicing in areas endemic for Lyme\ndisease need to be aware of B. burgdorferi infection in the differential\ndiagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunction.  Conservative bladder\nmanagement including clean intermittent catheterization guided by urodynamic\nevaluation is recommended.\n\n\nIV. ***** QUESTIONS 'N' ANSWERS *****\n\nNote: If you have a response to this question, please forward it to the\neditor.\n\nSender: Terry Morse <morset@ccmail.orst.edu>\nSubject: Question on Lyme Vectors and Compost Piles\n\n  When I visited my sister on Long Island, NY, I was cautioned to avoid the\ncompost heap in her back yard, as she thinks this is where she became\ninfected.\n\n  A friend of mine here in Oregon who has a compost heap would like me to\nback that claim up with documentation.

My wife has requested that I poll the Sages of Usenet to see what is\nknown about the use of chromium in weight-control diet suppliments.\nShe has seen multiple products advertising it and would like any kind\nreal information.\n\nMy first impulse was "Yuck! a metal!" but I have zero data on it.\n\nWhat do you know?
A good source of information on Burzynski's method is in *The Cancer Industry*\n   by pulitzer-prize nominee Ralph Moss.\n\nInteresting. What book got Moss the pulitzer nomination? None of the\nflyers for his books mention this, and none of the Cancer Chronicle\nNewsletters that I have mention this either.\n\n   Also, a non-profit organization called "People Against Cancer,"\n   which was formed for the purpose of allowing cancer patients to\n   access information regarding cancer therapies not endorsed by the\n   cancer industry, but which have shown highly promising results (all\n   of which are non-toxic).\n\nMoss is People Against Cancer's Director of Communications. People\nAgainst Cancer seems to offer pretty questionable information, not\nexactly the place a cancer patient should be advised to turn to. Most\n(maybe all) of the infomation in their latest catalogue concern\ntreatments that have been shown to be ineffective against cancer, and\nmany of the treatments are quite dangerous as well.\n\nsdb
I agree with this consensus that it should not have been written the way\nit was.  My doctor - who claims to have introduced Dr. Crook to the\npossibility of candida overbloom causing diffuse symptoms way back in\n1961 (I have no reason to doubt him on this) - does not like the book\nbecause 1) it makes too many unfounded claims, and 2) is horribly written\nfrom a scientific viewpoint.  On the other hand, my doctor has always kept\nan open mind on the subject and does believe in aspects of the "yeast\nconnection".\n\nBut, I believe there is some truth to the book.  Hopefully the right\nclinical studies can be done to separate the fact from the fiction.  In\nthe meantime, I'd still encourage people who have "incurable" chronic sinus\nproblems (especially if they overused antibiotics), to find a doctor to\nadminister a systemic-type anti-fungal such as itraconazole (along with\nliver panels before, during and after treatment just to play it safe).  It\nis an empirical approach for sure, but when all else fails, and your ENT\nsays "sorry, you'll just have to live with it", it is time to step out and\ntry an empirical approach backed up with significant anecdotal evidence\n(Dr. Ivker), supported by plausible theories (outlined by Marty).  At\nthis stage you have little to lose, particularly if you use itraconazole and\nhave the proper monitoring - the health risk has been shown through extensive\nclinical studies both in Europe and the U.S. to be very minimal with\nrelatively healthy (i.e., non-AIDS) patients.  I'm glad I did this, since I\nsaw remarkable results after only one week on Sporanox (itraconazole).  Of\ncourse, your mileage may vary a lot - everyone is different so it may not\nwork for you.  Talk to your doctor.\n\nJon Noring\n\n-- \n\nCharter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.
I've tried it, and so has one friend of mine.  No known side effects or\nrisks.  It didn't seem to work for us, but several studies now have \nsuggested it does work for many people, so I think it's worth a try.\n\nYou can find it in capsule form at health food stores.  Up to six capsules\na day was recommended, if I remember correctly.  It can also be prepared \nas a tea.\n\nGood luck,
I've heard of NO studies, but speculation:\n\nWhy on _earth_ would there be any effect on women's health?  That's about \nthe most absurd idea I've heard since Ted Kaldis's claim that no more than \n35,000 people would march on Washington.\n\nOk, _one_ point:  Greatly reduced chance of pregnancy.  But that's it.
(This is a cross post to rec.gardens and sci.med. Set the follow-up\n(line in the header, depending on what kind of advice you give, or\n(e-mail directly to me: ceci@lysator.liu.se.)\n\nI have a problem with wasps -- they seem to love me. Last summer I\ncouldn't spend more than ten to fifteen minutes at a time in my garden\nbefore one or several wasps would come for me. I am asking for advice\non how to repel wasps.\n\n   This year the wasps have built their nest under a stone next to one\nof my tiny ponds. The caretaker (poor fellow!) will have to take care\nof them, and that will give me a head start on them. Last year we\ncouldn't find any nest. Even after the caretaker has gassed the nest\nin my tiny garden of 30 square meter, other wasps will most likely vie\nfor the territory. Is there anything I can grow, rub on my skin or\nspread on the soil that will repel the black and yellow bastards?\nNever mind if it turns my skin purple or kills off all my beloved\nplants, I want to be able to spend time in my garden like everyone\nelse.\n\n   Would it help to remove the ponds and the bird bath? The wasps seem\nto come to drink at them, and I suppose that their prey will breed in\nthem. The black tits seem to be afraid of the wasps, because as soon\nas the wasp season starts, they stop coming to have their bath.\n\nEven when I am not trying to win back my patio from 15-20 wasps, they\nseem to love me. The advice I usually get when I ask what to do about\nwasps, is to stand still and not wave my arms. I've got some painful\nstings when trying to follow that advice. I have also tried to use\nhygienic products without perfumes, to no avail. They still love me,\nand come for me, even when I'm in the middle of a crowd. So far only\ntwo things seem to work: To kill it dead or to run into the house and\nclose all doors and windows. \n\nNB: I don't have a problem with bees or bumble-bees, just wasps.\n    Patronizing advice redirected to /dev/null.\n\n--Ceci

You might look for an allergy doctor in your area who uses sublingual\ndrops instead of shots for treatment. (You are given a small bottle of\nantigens; 3 drops are placed under the tongue for 5 minutes.) My\nallergy to bermuda grass was neutralized this way. Throughout the treatment\nprocess I had to return to the doctor's office every month for re-testing\nand a new bottle of antigens. After the allergy was completely neutralized\na bottle of maintenance antigens lasts me about 4 months (the sublingual\ndrops are then taken 3 times per week), and costs $20. So the cost is\nless than shots and it is more convenient just to take the drops at home.
There's always the old switcheroo.\n\nMy brother works at a dialysis clinic.  They were interviewing \ncandidates for a technician job (mainly electronics tech), and a\nurine screen was part of the interview.  The bathroom was across\nthe hall from a lab.  One candidate managed to switch his urine\nsample with one he grabbed from the lab.  (No one was in it at\nthe time.)
I've read that exercise makes the heart pump more blood at a stroke, and\nthat it also makes the heart pumb slower, in order to make up for the\ngreater volume. My Internist, who diagnosed my AV block, slow heart rate\nand PVC's, told me something different. She says that heart rate is\nassociated with the electrical properties of the hear muscle, not its\nsize. Exercise lowers heart rate and increases stroke volume, but the\neffects are unrelated except for their common source. The AV block, she\nasserts, is another electrical effect, which is irreversable - even when\nexercise is dicontinued. PVC's are also common in runners. \n\nSo my EKG puts me in a class with trained athletes and also with heart\npatients. Isn't that strange, though? Are there any not-so-beneficial\naspects to athlete's heart? Is it all good?
I'll tell you all that I know about chromium.  But before I do, I want to \nget a few things off my chest.  I just got blasted in e-mail for my kidney \nstone posts.  Kidney stones are primarily caused by diet, as is heart \ndisease and cancer.  When I give dietary advise, it is not intended to \nencourage people reading this news group(or Sci. Med. Nutrition where I do \nmost of my posting) to avoid seeing a doctor.  Nothing can be further from \nthe truth.  Kidney stones can be caused by tumors and this possibility has to \nbe ruled out.  But once it is, diet is a good way of preventing a reoccurance.\nSame thing with heart disease and cancer, if you suspect that you may have \na problem with one of these diseases, don't use what I'm going to tell you \nor what you read in some book to avoid going to a doctor.  You have to go.\nHopefully you will find a doctor who knows enough about nutrition to help \nyou change your risk factors for both diseases as part of a treatment \nprogram(but the odds are that you will not and that's why I'm here).  When \nmy wife detected a lump in here breast I didn't say, don't worry my vitamin \nE will take care of it.  Any breast lump has to be worked up by a physician, \nplan and simple.  If it's begnin(which most are) fine, then maybe a diet \nchange and supplementation will prevent further breast lumps from occuring.\nBut let me tell you right now, if you have tried diet and supplementation \nand another lump returns, get your butt into the doctor's office as fast as \nyour little feet can carry you(better yet, have a mammography done on a \nregular basis, my wife kept putting her's off, both myself and her \ngynocologist told her she needed to have one done).  Her gynocologist even \nscheduled one, but she didn't show up(too busy running the Operating Room for \nthe biggest Hospital in Tulsa).\n\nOne more thing, I am not an orthomolecular nutritionist.  This group uses \nhigh dose vitamins and minerals to treat all kinds of disease.  There is \nabsolutely no doubt in my mind that vitamins and minerals can and do have \ndrug actions in the body.  But you talk about flying blind, man this is \nreally blind treatment.  No drug could ever be used as these vitamins and \nminerals are being used.  I'm not saying that some of this stuff couldn't \nbe right on the money, it may well be.  But my approach to nutrition is a \nlot like that of Weinsier and Morgan, the two M.D's who wrote the new \nClinical Nutrition textbook.  My push is the nutrient reserves and the lab \ntests needed to measure these reserves and then supplementation or diet \nchanges to get these reserves built up to where they should be to let you \nhandle stress.  That's where I'm coming from folks.  Blast away if you want,\nI'm not going to change.  Put me in your killfile if you want, I really \ndon't care.  I'm averaging 8-10 e-mail messages a day from people who think \nthat I've got something important to say.  But I'm also getting hit by a \nfew with an axe to grind.  That's life.\n\nChromium is one of the trace elements.  It has a very limited(but very \nimportant) role in the body.  It is used to form glucose tolerance factor\n(GTF).  GTF is made up of chromium, nicinamide(niacin), glycine, cysteine \nand glutamic.  Only the chromium and the niacin are needed from the diet to \nform GTF.  Some foods already have GTF(Liver, brewers or nutritional yeast,\nand black pepper).  When chromium is in GTF, a pretty good absorption is \nseen(about 20%).  But when it is simply present as a mineral or mineral \nchelate(chromium picolinate) it's absorption is much lower(1 to 2%, lowest \nfor all the minerals).  I've been posting in Misc. Fitness and chromium has \ncome up there several times as a "fat burner".  Chromium is among the least \ntoxic of the minerals so you could really load yourself up and not really \ndo any harm.  I wouldn't do it though.  The adequate and safe range for \nchromium is 50 to 200ug per day.  The average American is getting about \n30ug per day from his/her diet.  Chromium levels decrease with age and many \nbelieve that adult onset diabetes is primarily a chromium deficiency.  I \ncan cite you several studies that have been done with glucose tolerance in \nType II diabetes but I'm not going to because for each positive one, there \nalso seems to be a negative one as well.  I'm convinced that the problem is \nbioavailability.  When yeast(GTF) is used, good results are obtained but when \nchromium itself is used the results are usually negative.  In addition to \nType II diabetes, chromiuum has been examined in cardiovascular disease and \nglucoma, again with mixed results as far as cardiovascular disease is \nconcerned\n\nSince a high blood glucose level can lead to cardiovascular disease, \nthis possible link with chromium isn't too surprising.  Glucoma is a little \nmore interesting.  Muscle eye focusing activity is primarily an insulin \nresponsive glucose-driven metabolic function.  If this eye focusing activity \nis impaired(by a lack of glucose due to a poor insulin response), intraocular \npressure is believed to be elevated.  In a fairly large study of 400 pts with \nglaucoma, the one consistent finding was a low RBC chromium. J. Am. Coll. \nNutr. 10(5):536,(1991).  But this one preliminary study should not prompt \npeople to go out and start popping chromium supplements.  For one thing, \njust about every older person is going to have a low RBC chromium unless \nthey have been taking chromium suppleemnts(yeast).  Since glucoma is often \nfound in older people, it's not too surprising that chromium was low in the \nRBC's.  If chromium supplementation could reverse glucoma, that would \nprompt some attention.  I suspect that there will be a clinical trail to \ncheck out this possible chromium link to glucoma.\n\nYou could find out what your body chromium pool size was by either the RBC \nchromium test or hair analysis.  Most clinical labs are not going to run a \nRBC chromium.  There are plenty of labs that will do a hair and nail \nanalysis for you, but I wouldn't use them.  There is just too much funny \nbusiness going on in these unregulated labs right now.\n\nHere's Weinsier and Morgan, advise on chromium.  They do not consider \nchromium to be one of those minerals for which a reliable clinical test is \navailable(they don't like the hair and nail analysis labs either, and they \nalso recognize the RBC chromium is primarily a research test that is not \nroutinely available in most clinical chemistry labs).  This has to change \nand as more labs run a RBC chromiuum, it will.  What then do they suggest?\nMake a diagnosis of chromium deficiency based on a documented clinical \nresponse to chromium(run a glucose tolerance test before and after chromium \nsupplementation).  Once you make the diagnosis, put the patient on 200ug of \nCrCl3 orally each day or 10grams of yeast per day.\n\nWhat's my advise?  Don't take chromium supplements to try to loose weight\n(they just do not work that way).  If you want to take them and then \nexercise, that would be great.  Do include yeast as part of your diet(most \nAmericans are not getting enough chromium from their diet).  If you do have \na poor glucose tolerance, ask your doctor to check your chromium status.  \nWhen he or she says, "what in the world are you talking about", just say, \nplease get a copy of Weinsier and Morgan's new Clinical Nutrition textbook \nand do what they say to do with patients who present with a poor glucose \ntolerance.  If you can't do that, I'll find a doctor who can, thank you \nvery much.
You could do what I do: never go near the stuff!  :)

Mark, this is the most reasonable post that I've seen in Sci. Med. on the \ntopic of Colonic Flushing.  I'm in a profession that uses manipulation(a \nvery refined form of massage) to treat various human diseases.  Proving \nthat manipulation works has been extremely difficult(as the MD's delight in \npointing out).  The Osteopathic Profession seems to be making better \nprogress than the chiropractors in proving(scientifically) that their \ntechingues work.  The JAOA recently had a study on the use of manipulation \nto relieve mensrual cramps in women with results that were as good or \nbetter than drug treatment(using physiological measurements, and not just \nthe woman's preception of improvement).  This study was hailed by the JAOA \neditors as the turning point in the profession's long struggle to prove \nitself to the medical community.\n\nI'm currently trying to get the AOA(American Osteopathic Association) which \nhas supported most of the Osteopathic research in the U.S. to also support \nnutrition education and research.  I've pointed out, in a grant proposal, \nthat the founder of Osteopathic Medicine(A.T. Still) embraced both diet and \nmanipulation to set himself apart from the MD's of his time who were pushing \nonly drugs(Still was himself an MD who got real dissillusioned with drugs \nduring his service in the Civil War).  He decided that there had to be a \nbetter way to treat human disease since he saw the cure(drugs) as being \nworse than the disease.  Through his many years of study of the human body, \nhe developed his manipulation techniques that he then taught to his \nstudents in the U.S's first Osteopathic Medical school.  We now have 17.\nStill used manipulation to treat(and also diagnose) human disease but he \nused diet to prevent human disease.  I'm trying to get the Osteopathic \nProfession to return to it's roots and beat the MD's to the punch(so to \nspeak).  Both DO's and MD's in current medical practice have very little \nunderstanding of how diet affects human health.  This has to change.\n\nMartin Banschbach, Ph.D.\nProfessor of Biochemistry and Chairman\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Microbiology\nOSU COllege of Osteopathic Medicine

I've mentioned this study a couple of times now: Ingestion of yogurt\ncontaining Lactobacillus acidophilus as prophylaxis for candidal\nvaginitis, Annals of Internal Medicine, 3/1/92 116(5):353-7.  Do you\nhave a problem with the study because they used yogurt rather than\ncapsules of lactobacillus (even though it had positive results)?\n\nThe study was a crossover trial of daily ingestion of 8 ounces of\nyogurt.  There was a marked decrease in infections while women were\ningesting the yogurt.  Problems with the study included very small\nnumbers (33 patients enrolled) and many protocol violations (only\n21 patients were analyzed).  Still, the difference in rates of infection\nbetween the two groups was so large that the study remains fairly\nbelievable.

SREBRENICA'S DOCTOR RECOUNTS TOWN'S LIVING HELL\n \n    By Laura Pitter\n    TUZLA, Bosnia, Reuter - Neret Mujanovic was a pathologist\nwhen he trekked through the mountains to the besieged Muslim\ntown of Srebrenica last August.\n    But after treating 4,000 mangled victims of Bosnia's bloody\nwar, he considers himself a surgeon.\n    ``Now I'm a surgeon with great experience although I have no\nlicense to practice. But if I operate on a person and he lives\nnormally that's the greatest license a surgeon could have.''\n    Evacuated by the U.N. this week to his home town of Tuzla,\nthe Muslim physician gave an eyewitness medical assessment of\nthe horrors of the year-long Serb siege of Srebrenica and the\nsuffering of the thousands trapped there.\n    ``I lived through hell together with the people of\nSrebrenica. All those who lived through this are the greatest\nheroes that humanity can produce,'' he told reporters.\n    Mujanovic, 31, had practiced for two months as an assistant\nat a local hospital in Tuzla, but before going to Srebrenica he\nhad never performed a surgical operation on his own. Now he says\nhe has performed major surgery 1,396 times, relying on books for\nguidance, amputating arms and legs 150 times, usually without\nanesthetic, delivering 350 babies and performing four cesarean\nsections.\n    He worked 18-to-19-hour days, slept in the hospital for the\nfirst 10 weeks after his arrival last Aug. 5 and treated  4,000\npatients.\n    He arrived after making the trek over mountains on foot from\nTuzla, 60 miles northwest of Srebrenica. About 50 other people\ncarried in supplies and 350 soldiers guided and protected him\nthrough guerrilla terrain, he said.\n    His worst memory was of 10 days ago when seven Serb shells\nlanded within one minute in an area half the size of a football\nfield, killing 36 people immediately and wounding 102. Half of\nthe dead were women and children.\n    The people had come out for a rare day of sunshine and the\nchildren were playing soccer. ``There was no warning ... the\nblood flowed like a river in the street,'' he said.\n    ``There were pieces of women all around and you could not\npiece them together. One woman holding her two children in her\nhands was lying with them on the ground dead. They had no\nheads.''\n    Before Mujanovic arrived with his supplies conditions were\ndeplorable, he said. Many deaths could have been prevented had\nthe hospital had surgical tools, facilities and medicine.\n    The six general practitioners who had been operating before\nhe arrived had even less surgical experience than he did. ``They\ndidn't know the basic principles for amputating limbs.''\n    Once he arrived the situation improved, he said, but by\nmid-September he had run out of supplies.\n    ``Bandages were washed and boiled five times ... sometimes\nthey were falling apart in my hands,'' he said. Doctors had no\nanesthetic and could not give patients alcohol to numb the pain\nbecause it increased bleeding.\n    ``People were completely conscious during amputations and\nstomach operations,'' he said. Blood transfusions were\nimpossible because they had no facilities to test blood types.\n    ``I felt destroyed psychologically,'' Mujanovic said.\n    The situation improved after Dec. 4, when a convoy arrived\nfrom the Belgian medical group Medecins Sans Frontieres.\n    But Mujanovic said the military predicament worsened in\nmid-December after Bosnian Serbs began a major offensive in the\nregion. ``Every day we had air strikes and shellings.''\n    Then the hunger set in.\n    Between mid-December and mid-March, when U.S. planes began\nair dropping food, between 20 and 30 people were dying every day\nfrom complications associated with malnutrition, he said.\n    ``I know for sure that the air drop operation saved the\npeople from massive death by hunger and starvation,'' he said.\n    According to Mujanovic, around 5,000 people died in\nSrebrenica, 1,000 of them children, during a year of siege.\n    Mujanovic plans to return to Srebrenica in three weeks after\nvisiting his wife, who is ill in Tuzla.\n    ``They say I'm a hero,'' he said. ``There were thousands of\npeople standing at the sides of the road, crying and waving when\nI left. And I cried too.''
:Being a chronic HBsAg carrier does not necessarily mean the patient has chronic\n:persistent anything. Persons who are chronic carriers may have no clinical,\n:biochemical, or histologic evidence of liver disease, or they may have chronic\n:persistent hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular\n:carcinoma.\n:\n:Most cases of chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH) are probably the result of\n:a viral infection, although in a good number of cases the cause cannot be\n:determined. The diagnosis of CPH is made on the basis of liver biopsy. It\n:consists of findings of portal inflammation, an intact periportal limiting\n:plate, and on occasion isolated foci of intralobular necrosis. But in contrast\n:to chronic active hepatitis (CAH) there is no periportal inflammation, \n:bridging necrosis, or fibrosis. \n:\n:CPH has, indeed, an excellent prognosis. If I had to choose between CAH and\n:CPH there is no question I would also choose CPH. However, as David pointed\n:out, the distinction between the two is not as neat as some of us would have\n:it. The histology can sometimes be pretty equivocal, with biopsies showing\n:areas compatible with both CPH and CAH. Maybe it is a sampling problem. Maybe\n:it is a continuum. I don't know.\n\nDarn.  Just when I think I understand something someone who knows the\npathology has to burst my bubble :-(  We'd better not start talking about\nglomerular diseases, then I'll really get depressed.\n\nSeriously though, I wonder how someone with CPH would end up getting a\nbiopsy in the first place?  My understanding (and feel free to correct me)\nis that the enzymes are at worst mildly elevated, with overall normal\nhepatic function.  I would think that the only clue might be a history of\nprior HepB infection and a positive HepB-sAg.  Or is it indeed on a\ncontinuum with CAH, and the distinction merely one of pathology and\nprognosis, but otherwise identical clinical features?

Somehow the girl became pregnent as sperm\n:cells made their way to her through the clothes via persperation.\n:\n:Was my biology teacher misinforming us, or do such incidents actually\n:occur?\n\nSounds to me like someone was pulling your leg.  There is only one way for\npregnancy to occur: intercourse.  These days however there is also\nartificial insemination and implantation techniques, but we're speaking of\n"natural" acts here.  It is possible for pregnancy to occur if semen is\ndeposited just outside of the vagina (i.e. coitus interruptus), but that's\nabout at far as you can get.  Through clothes -- no way.  Better go talk\nto your biology teacher.

There is no data to show chromium is effective in promoting weight loss.  The\n few studies that have been done using chromium have been very flawed and inher\nently biased (the investigators were making money from marketing it).\n  Theoretically it really doesnt make sense either. The claim is that chromium\nwill increase muscle mass and decrease fat.  Of course, chromium is also used t\no cure diabetes, high blood pressure and increase muscle mass in athletes(just\nas well as anabolic steroids). Sounds like snake oil for the 1990's :-)\n On the other hand, it really cant hurt you anywhere but your wallet, and place\nbo effects of anything can be pretty dramatic...\n\n                                    -Paul\n     ----------------------------------------------------------\n    |  Paul Sovcik, Pharm.D.

:In article <enea1-270493135255@enea.apple.com>\n:>Can anyone out there tell me the difference between a "persistent" disease\n:>and a "chronic" one? For example, persistent hepatitis vs chronic\n:>hepatitis.\n:\n:I don't think there is a general distinction.  Rather, there are\n:two classes of chronic hepatitis: chronic active hepatitis and chronic\n:persistent hepatitis.  I can't think of any other disease where the\n:term persistent is used with or in preference to chronic.\n:\n:Much as these two terms "chronic active" and "chronic persistent"\n:sound fuzzy, the actual distinction between the two conditions\n:is often fairly fuzzy as well.\n\nI beg to differ.  Chronic *active* hepatitis implies that the disease\nremains active, and generally leads to liver failure.  At the very\nminimum, the patient has persistently elevated liver enzymes (what some\ncall "transaminitis").  Chronic *persistant* hepatitis simply means that\nthe patient has HbSag in his/her blood and can transmit the infection, but\nshows no evidence of progressive disease.  If I had to choose, I'd much\nrather have the persistant type.

I think you must have the same hygiene teacher I had in 1955.  There \nis a story about the Civil War about a soldier who was shot in the\ngroin.  The bullet, after passing through one of his testes, then entered\nthe abdomen of a young woman standing nearby.  Later,  when she (a young\nwoman of unimpeachible virtue) was shown to be pregnant; the soldier did\nthe honorable thing of marrying her.  According to this story, they lived\nhappily ever after.  \nPerhaps the most famous of Mr. Rau's classes was the time he would come\ninto class brandishing an aluminum turning mandrel  (tapering from about\n3/8" to 1/2" over a 10 inch length).  He would say, "Boys, do you know\nwhat this is?  It's a medical instrument called a 'cock reamer' and it's\nused to unclog your penis when you have VD.  They just ram it up there\nwithout an anesthetic!"  Needless to say this had a chilling effect.\nI didn't have lascivious thoughts for at least an hour.  Later in life\nas I perused medical instrument catelogs and saw the slender flexible\nurethral sounds that are actually used, I could not escape thinking\nthat I might one day see, "Reamer, Cock (style of Rau) ."        \n]

A student told me today that she has been diagnosed with kidney stones, a\ncyst on one kidney, and a kidney infection.  She was upset because her\ncondition had been misdiagnosed since last fall, and she has been ill all\nthis time.  During her most recent doctor's appointment at her parents'\nHMO clinic, she said that about FORTY! x-rays were made of her kidney.\nWhen she asked why so many x-rays were being made, she was told by a\ntechnician that they need to see the area from different views, but she\nsays that about five x-rays were made from EACH angle.  She couldn't help\nfeeling that something must be wrong with the procedure or something.  She\nis a pre-med student and feels she could have understood what was\nhappening if someone would have explained.  When nobody would, she got\nworried.\n	Also, she is told that thre are 300! surgery patients ahead of her\nand that they cannot do surgery until August or so.  It is now April...\nShe is supposed to rest a lot and drink fluids.  But she has to go to\nclasses.  She wonders why they have given her no medicine.  She plans to\ncall back her doctor's office / clinic and try to get answers to these\nquestions.  But I told her I would also write in to sci.med and see what I\ncould find out about why there were so many x-rays and whether it seems\no.k. to wait in line 3 or more months for surgery for something like this\nor whether she should be looking elsewhere for her care.  She does plan to\nget a second opinion, too. \n\n	I will pass info on to her.  It never hurts to get information\nfrom more than one source.  \n\nYou can e-mail me or post.\n\nThanks.

There are two different mechanisms here:  toning of muscles and reduction of\nfat.  Exercises specific to particular muscles will tone only those muscles\nexercised (example: look at differences in arm circumferences between pitching\narms and non-pitching arms in major league pitchers).  However, if exercise\nalso leads to reduction of body fat, the loss of body fat will be equally\ndistributed over the entire body.  There is no way to "spot reduce" body fat\nother than surgically, through liposuction. Distribution of body fat is\ngenetically determined.  Sometimes a very flabby muscle will look like "fat",\nso when that muscle gains some muscle tone it may *appear* as though the "fat"\nis "changing" into "muscle", but really fat and muscle tissues are totally\nseparate, and one does not ever "change into" the other.
Organization: Temple University\nX-Newsreader: NNR/VM S_1.3.2\n\nLast week I went to see a gastroenterologist. I had never met this\ndoctor before, and she did not know what I was there for. As soon as I\narrived, somebody showed me to an examining room and handed me a gown.\nThey told me to undress (from the waist down, to be exact) and wait for the\ndoctor. Is this the usual drill when you go to a doctor for the first\ntime? I don't have much experience going to doctors (knock on wood), but\non the couple of occasions when I've gone to a new doctor, I met him\nwith my clothes on. First, he introduced himself, asked what I was there\nfor and took a history, all before I undressed.\n \nAre patients usually expected to get naked before meeting a doctor\nfor the first time? Personally, I'd prefer to meet the doctor on\nsomething remotely resembling a condition of parity and to establish an\nidentity as a person who wears clothes before dropping my drawers. If\nnothing else, it minimizes the time that I have to spend in the self\nconscious, ill at ease and vulnerable condition of a person with a bare\nbottom talking to somebody who is fully clothed.\n \nDoes anybody besides me regard this get-naked-first-and-then-we-can-talk\nattitude as insensitive? Also, is it unusual?

David, this study looks like a good one.  Gordon Rubenfeld did a Medline \nsearch and also sent me the same reference through e-mail.  Since \ncommercial yogurt does not always have a good Lactobacillus a. or \nbulgaricus culture, a negative finding would not have been too informative.\nThis is often the reason why Lactobacillus acidophilus tablets are \nrecommended rather than yogurt.\n\nI guess the next question is why would this introduction of "good" bacteria \nback into the gut decrease the incidence of vaginal candida blooms if the \nanus was not serving as a candida reservoir(a fact that Gordon R. vehementy\ndenys)?  I see two possible theories.  One, the L. acidophilus, which is a \nfacultatively anaerobic bacterium, could make it through the gut and \ncolonize the rectal area to overgrow the candida.  This would not explain \nthe reoccurance of candida blooms in the vagina after the yogurt ingestion \nwas stopped though.  The other is that the additional bacteria in the \nintestinal tract remove most of the glucose from the feces and candida \nlooses it's major food source.\n\nGetting Lactobacillus acidophilus to colonize the vaginal tract(where it is \nnormally found) would have a much better effect on the recurrance of vaginal \nyeast blooms though.  An acetic acid, Lactobacillus acidophilus douche has \nbeen used to get this effect but I've not seen any such treatment reported in \nthe medical literature.  This would be an example of physicians conducting \ntheir own clinical trials to try to come up with treatments that help their \npatients.  When this is done in private practice, the results are rarely, if \never published.  It was the hallmark of medicine until the modern age \nemerged with clinical trials.  It really raises a big question.  Does the \nmedical profession cast out the adventerous few who try new treatments to \nhelp patients or does it look the other way.\n\nThis particular issue is really a very simple one since no real dangerous \ntherapy is involved(even the anti-fungals are not all that dangerous).  But \nthere are some areas(like EDTA chelation therapy), where the fire is pretty \nhot and somebody could get burned.  It's really tough.  Do I follow only \nwell established protocols and then give up if they don't work that well or \ndo it try something that looks like it will work but hasn't been proven to \nwork yet?\n\nMy stand is to consider other treatment possibilities, especially if they \ninvolve little or no risk to the patient.  Getting good bacteria back into \nthe gut after antibiotic treatment is one treatment possibility.  The other \nis getting L. acidophilus into the vaginal tract of a woman who is having a \nproblem with recurring yeast infections.

^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThe acetaminophen is the agent of concern in overdose of this\nOTC medication.  A single dose of acetaminophen of 10 grams or greater\ncan cause hepatotoxicity, and doses of 25 grams or more are\npotentially fatal from hepatic necrosis.  If I recall\ncorrectly, the metabolism of acetaminophen at high doses\ninvolves N-hydroxylation to N-acetyl-benzoquinoneimine, which\nis a highly reactive intermediate, which then reacts with\nsulfhydryl groups of proteins and glutathione.  When hepatic\nglutathione is used up, this intermediate then starts\nattacking the hepatic proteins with resulting hepatic\nnecrosis.  The insidious part of acetaminophen toxicity is the\ndelay (2-4 days) between ingestion and clinical signs of liver\ndamage.  This is NOT a nice way to die.\n\nAs to taking 20-30 of these tablets, that comes to 5-7.5 grams\nof acetaminophen.  In a normal adult, this would probably\ncause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite.

Dear Netters:\n\nMaybe one of you can explain this.  From time to time I experience \na strange kind of feeling (I have all kinds of weird feelings) which \ncan be best described as the feeling of "losing gravity", like that one \nexperiences in a descending elevator.  Needless to say, it is not \nenjoyable.  It sometimes comes with shortness of breath and extreme \nfatigue.  It lasts from a few minutes to an hour and when it lasts \nthat long, it makes me sweatening.\n\nInitially I called it "palpitation (spelling?)" until I later learnt that \nthe terminology has been reserved for the self-awareness of heart beats.\n\nSo, is there a specific term for this feeling, or am I a stragne person?\nI always believe I am unique. \n\nThanks.

Where are your references?  I have been unable to find studies that state\nthat chromium "cures diabetese".  It can reduce the amount of insulin you\nhave to take.  "High blood pressure" - I have never heard of this claim\nbefore.  "... anabolic steroids" - I have also never heard of this claim\nbefore.  Sounds like you are making things up and stretching the truth\nfor God knows what reason.  Did somebody piss you off at one time?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI agree with you that chromium picolinate by itself isn't likely\nto make a fat person thin.  But it can be the decisive component\nof an overall strategy for long-term weight control and make an\nimportant contribution to good health.  It is important to\nexercise (11, 12) and also avoid fat calories (9, 10).\n\nChromium picolinate has shown to reduce fat and increase\nlean muscle (1, 2, 3).  I will not bore you with the\nstatistics.  You wouldn't believe these anyway.\n\nChromium Picolinate is an exceptionally bioactive source of\nthe essential mineral chromium.  Chromium plays a vital role\nin "sensitizing" the body's tissues to the hormone insulin.\nWeight gain in the form of fat tends to impair sensitivity\nto insulin and thus, in turn, makes it harder to lose\nweight (4).\n\nInsulin directly stimulates protein synthesis and retards\nprotein breakdown in muscles (5, 6).  This "protein sparing"\neffect of insulin tends to decline during low calorie diets\nas insulin levels decline, which results in loss of muscle\nand organ tissue.  By "sensitizing" muscle to insulin,\nchromium picolinate helps to preserve muscle in dieters\nso that they "burn" more fat and less muscle.  Preservation\nof lean body mass has an important long-term positive\neffect on metabolic rate, helping dieters keep off the\nfat they've lost.\n\nChromium picolinate promotes efficient metabolism by aiding\nthe thermogenic (heat producing) effects of insulin.\nInsulin levels serve as a rough index of the availability\nof food calories, so it's not at all surprising that insulin \nstimulates metabolism (4, 7, 8).  Note that I did not say\nthat chromium picolinate increases metabolism.\n\nIn summary, you need to change your life style in order to\nloose weight and stay healthy:\n\n  A. Reduce dietary fat consumption to no more than 20% of calories.\n     - Eating fat makes you fat.\n\n  B. Increase dietary fiber\n     - low in calories; high in nutrients.\n\n  C. Get regular aerobic exercise at least 3 times a week\n     - burn calories.\n\n  D. Take chromium picolinate daily\n     - lose fat; keep muscle\n\n\nReferences:\n\n1.  Kaats GR, Fisher JA, Blum K.

I was wondering if a group called 'sci.pharmacology' would be relevent.\nThis would be used for a more formal discussion about pharmacological\nissues (pharmacodynamics, neuropharmacology, etc.)\n\nJust an informal proposal (I don't know anything about the net.politics\nfor adding a newsgroup, etc.)\n\n[more alt.psychoactives stuff deleted]
Some of the MD's in this newsgroup have been riding my butt pretty good\n(maybe in some cases with good reason).  In this post on depression, I'm \nlaying it all out.  I'll continue to post here because I think that I have \nsome knowledge that could be useful.  Once you have read this post, you \nshould know where I'm coming from when I post again in the future.\n\n \nLida,\nI can emphasize with your situation.  Both my wife and I suffered from \nbouts of depression.  Her's was brought on by breast cancer and mine was a \nrebound stress reaction to her modified radical mastectomy and \nchemotherapy.  Lida, I used my knowledge of nutrition to get her through \nher six months of chemotherapy(with the approval of her oncologist).  When \nsevere depression set in a few months after the chemo stopped, I tried to \nuse supplements to bring her out of it.  I had "cured" her PMS using \nsupplements and I really thought that I knew enough about the role of diet \nin depression to take care of her depression as well.  It didn't work and \nshe was put on Prozac by her oncologist.  Two Winters ago(three years after \nby wife's breast cancer) I got hit with severe depression(pretty typical and \none reason why many marriages break up after breast cancer or another \nstressor).  I tried to take care of it for several months with \nsupplementation.  Didn't work.  My internist ended up putting me on Prozac. \nI was going to give you a list of several studies that have been done using \nB6, niacin, folate and B12 to "cure" depression.  I'm not going to do that \nbecause all you would be doing is flying blind like I was.\n\nLida, I do believe that depression can have a dietary component.  But the \nproblem is that you need to know exactly what the problem is and then use \nan approach which will "fix" the problem.  For chemotherapy, I knew exactly \nwhat drugs were going to be used and exactly what nutrients would be \naffected.  Same thing for PMS.  I was flying blind for both of these \nstressors but the literature that I used to devise a treatment program was \npretty good.  Depression is just too complicated.  What you really need is \na nutritional scan.  This is not a diet analysis but an analysis of your \nbodies nutrient reserves.  For every vitamin and mineral(except vitamin C), \nyou have a reserve.  The RDA is not designed to give you enough of any \nnutrient to keep these reserves full, it is only designed to keep them from \nbeing emptied which would cause clinical pathology.  Stress will increase \nyour need for many vitamins and minerals.  This is when your reserves become \nvery important.\n\nLida, without your permission, I'm going to use your post as a conduit to \ntry to explain to the readers in this group and Sci. Med. where I'm coming \nfrom.  I have taught a course on human nutrition in one of the Osteopathic \nMedical schools for ten years now.  I've written my own textbook because \nnone was available.  What I teach is not a rehash of biochemistry.  I \npreach nutrient reserves(yes my lectures in this course are referred to by \nmy students as sermons).  Here is what I cover:\n\nIndroduction and Carbohydrates 			Lipids\n\nProteins I					Proteins II\n\nEnergy Balance					Evaluation of Nutritional\n						Status I, A Clinical \n						Perspective\n\nEvaluation of Nutritional Status II,            Evaluation of Nutritional		\nA Biochemical Perspective			Status III, Homework \n						Assignment Using the \n						Nutritionist IV Diet and \n						Fitness Analysis Software \n						program\n\nWeight Control					Food Fads and Facts\n\nAge-Related Change in Nutrient Requirements	Food Additives, \n						Contaminants and Cancer\n\nDrug-Nutrient Interactions			Mineral and Water Balance\n\nSodium, Potassium and Chloride			Calcium, Magnesium and \n						Phosphorus\n\nIron						Zinc and Copper\n\nIodine and Fluoride				Other Trace Minerals\n\nVitamin A					Vitamin E\n\nVitamins D and K				Vitamin C\n\nThiamin and Niacin				Riboflavin and Pyridoxine\n\nPantothenic and Folic acids			Biotin and B12\n\nOther Nutrient Factors				Enteral Nutrition\n\nParenteral Nutrition\n\nEvery three years I spend my entire Summer reviewing the Medical literature \nto find material that I can use in my nutrition textbook.  I last did this \nin the Summer of 1991.  I read everything that I can find and then sit down \nand rewrite my lecture handouts which are bound in three separate books \nthat have 217, 237 and 122 pages.  Opposite each page of written text(which \nI write myself) I've pulled figures, tables and graphs from various \ncopyrighted sources.  Since this material is only being used for \neducational purposes, I can get around the copyright laws (so far).  I can not \nsend this material out to newsgroup readers(as I've been asked to do).\n\nI am now in the process of trying to get a grant to setup a nutrition \nassessment lab.  This is the last peice of the nutrition puzzle that I need \nto make my education program complete.  This lab will let me measure the \nnutrient reserve for almost all the vitamins and minerals that are known to \nbe required in humans.  The Mayo clinic already uses a similiar lab to \ndesign supplement programs for their cancer patients.  Cancer Treatment \nCenters of America, which is a private for-profit organization with \nhospitals in Illinois and Oklahoma(Tulsa) also operates a \nnutritional assessment clinical lab.  I also believe that the Pritikin \nClinic in California has a similiar lab setup.\n\nFor physicians reading this post, I would suggest that you get the new \nClinical Nutrition Textbook that has just been published(Feb) by Mosby.  I \nhave been using Alpers Manual of Nutritional Therapeutics(a Little Brown \nseries book) as a supplemental text for my course but Alpers is geared more \nto residency training.  Two M.D's have written this new Clinical Nutrition\ntextbook and it is geared more towards medical student education and it \ndoes a good job of covering the lab tests that can be run to assess a \npatient's nutritional status.  Let me quote a few sentences from the \nPreface of this new text:\n\n"So-called nutrition specialists were in reality gastroenterologists, \nhematologists, or pediatricians who just happened to profess some knowledge \nof nutrition as it related to their field of practice."  \n\n"Unfortunately, about two thirds of the medical schools in the United \nStates require no formal instruction in nutrition."\n\n"But times and medical practice have changed.  More than half of the \nleading causes of death in this country are nutrition related."\n\n"... this monograph should accomplish the following two objectives: (1) it \nshould complement your medical training by emphasizing the relevance of \nnutrition to your medical practice; and (2) it should heighten your \nawareness of nutrition as a medical speciality that is vitally important \nfor both disease prevention and the treatment of diseases of essentially \nevery organ system."\n\nRoland L. Weinsier, MD, DrPH \n\nLida, my advise to you is that you tell your family members to try to find \na physician who has an understanding of the role that vitamins and minerals\n(yes even magnesium may play a role in depression) play in depression and \nwho could get a nutritional profile run.  Menopause is often a time when \nwomen suffer depression.  There are a lot of hormonal changes that are \noccuring but they are not the same ones that occur during PMS.  A \nnutritionist may also be able to help.  Not too long ago a poster mentioned \nthat his nutritionist had diagnosed a selenium deficiency based on a red \ncell glutathionine peroxidase test(the specific test for the selenium \nreserve).  Most clinical labs will not run this test and I advised him to \ntry to make sure that the lab that did the test was certified.  There are \nalso a lot of hair and nail analysis labs setup to do trace mineral \nanalysis but these labs are not regulated.  Checks of these labs using \ncertified standards, and also those doing water lead analysis, showed some \npretty shoddy testing was going on.  If you or anyone else finds someone \nwho will run these speciality nutrition tests, make sure that they are \nusing a lab that has been certified under CLIA(the Clinical Laboratory \nImprovement Act).  \n\nA diet analysis may be helpful since many nutrient reserves have been shown \nto correlate fairly well with the dietary intake as monitored by food logging \nand software analysis(Nutritionist IV and other software programs).  But \nthere are still about half of the nutrients required by humans that do not \nshow a very good correlation between apparent dietary intake and reserve status.\nUntil we have more nutritional assessment clinical labs in operation in the \nU.S. and physicians who have been trained how to use the nutritional \nprofile that these labs provide to devise a treatment approach that uses \ndiet changes and supplementation, anti-depressants will probably continue \nto be the best approach to depression.\n\nMartin Banschbach, Ph.D.\nProfessor of Biochemistry and Chairman\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Microbiology\nOSU College of Osteopathic Medicine
-Allergy medicine, huh?  Is this just to get rid of the resultant migraine or\nwhatever, or does it actually suppress allergic reactions? (i.e. like an\nantihistamine does?)  As far as doctors over here are concerned, if you slip up\nand eat something you're allergic to (even if they won't test you to tell you\nwhat to avoid) then tough; if a _cheap_ medicine will alleviate your symptoms,\nthen fine, otherwise you just suffer.  One doctor did prescribe me imigran (costs\nthe NHS #48 for 6 tablets) after having to rehydrate me because I'd been throwing\nup for four solid days and couldn't even drink water - but I got taken off it\nagain when I moved and had to change doctors.  Reasoning: they did not know what\nthe side-effects were because it was new.  OK, fine - but it has passed the\nsafety tests to get on the prescription list, and anyway I was prepared to take\nthe risk to have quality of life now.  The only alternatives I have is to get it\nprescribed privately, which I cannot afford, or to pay a private allergy\nspecialist to test me and tell me what to avoid.  I am fairly certain I am\nallergic to more than one chemical additive, as a lot of things I can't eat have\nnothing in common except things I know are safe, so testing myself isn't really\nan option; there are too many permutations.
I used to be on lopid.  It did a good job of reducing cholesterol (295\ndown to around 214), as well as LDL and triglycerides.  Then, I got\npneumonia, and for some reason, the Lopid stopped working very well;\ncholesterol and triglycerides soared.  The levels might have stabilized\nover time, but a new doctor had me quit, wait a month, then switch\nto Mevicore.  \n\nOn Mevicore, my total cholesterol was down to 207,  LDL was 108, \nand HDL was 35; but the trig's were still\nvery high, around 318, and my liver tests came back slightly abnormal, \nSGOT = 83 (N = 1-35),  GGTP(?hard to read copy) = 42 (N = 0 - 35).\n\nHe said the liver numbers were not offbase enough to cause him\nconcern, and the triglycerides are not as important as the cholesterol\nfigures.  He had me stop the Mevicore to allow the liver to heal ("Just\nto be extra cautious, though I'm sure it's not a problem."),\nand wants me to go back on it after that.  I suggested maybe Lopid might\nbe the better choice, and he said that he wouldn't object if that's what\nI want to do.  But Lopid has one particular side effect I'm not fond of.
All I can remember is that there was an article in Scientific American\nmaybe 20 years ago.  As someone else noted rats or mice fed nothing\nbut heavy water eventually died, and the explanation was given.\n-- \nhaynes@cats.ucsc.edu\nhaynes@cats.bitnet
I've got a very nice collection of historical books on medical quackery,\nand on the topic of massage this is a recurring theme.  Ordinary massage\nis intended to make a person feel better, especially if they have muscular\nor joint problems.  But -- like chiropracty -- there are some practitioners\nwho take the technique to a far extreme, invoking what seems to me to be\nquack science to justify their technique.\n\nIn the case of massage, there is a technique called "deep abdominal massage"\nin which the masseur is literally attempting to massage the intestines!\nThe notion is that undigested food adheres to the inner surface of the\nintestines and putrifies, releasing poisons which cause various disease\nsyndromes.  By this vigorous and painful procedure, it is alleged that\nthese deposits can be loosened up and passed out.
I don't like the term "quack" being applied to a licensed physician David.\nQuestionable conduct is more appropriately called unethical(in my opinion).\nI'll give you some examples.\n\n	1. Prescribing controlled substances to patients with no \n	   demonstrated need(other than a drug addition) for the medication.\n\n	2. Prescribing thyroid preps for patients with normal thyroid \n	   function for the purpose of quick weight loss.\n\n	3. Using laetril to treat cancer patients when such treatment has \n	   been shown to be ineffective and dangerous(cyanide release) by \n	   the NCI.\n\nThese are errors of commission that competently trained physicians should \nnot committ but sometimes do.  There are also errors of omission(some of \nwhich result in malpractice suits).  I don't think that using anti-fungal \nagents to try to relieve discomfort in a patient who you suspect may be \nhaving a problem with candida(or another fungal growth) is an error of \ncommission or omission.  Healers have had a long history of trying to \nrelieve human suffering.  Some have stuck to standard, approved procedures,\nothers have been willing to try any reasonable treatment if there is a \nchance that it will help the patient.  The key has to be tied to the \nhealer's oath, "I will do no harm".  But you know David that very few \ntreatments involve no risk to the patient.  The job of the physician is a \nvery difficult one when risk versus benefit has to be weighed.  Each \nphysician deals with this risk/benefit paradox a little differently.  Some \nare very conservative while others are more agressive.  An agressive \napproach may be more costly to the patient and carry more risk but as long \nas the motive is improving the patient's health and not an attempt to rake \nin lots of money(through some of the schemes that have been uncovered in \nthe medicare fraud cases), I don't see the need to label these healers as \nquacks or even unethical.\n\nWhat do I reserve the term quack for?  Pseudo-medical professionals.  \nThese people lurk on the fringes of the health care system waiting for the \nfrustrated patient to fall into their lair.  Some of these individuals are \nreally doing a pretty good job of providing "alternative" medicine.  But \nmany lack any formal training and are in the "business" simply to make a \nfew fast bucks.   While a patient can be reasonably assured of getting \ncompetent care when a liscenced physician is consulted, this alternative \ncare area is really a buyer's beware arena.  If you are lucky, you may find \nsomeone who can help you.  If you are unlucky, you can loose a lot of \nmoney and develop severe disease because of the inability of these pseudo-\nmedical professional to diagnose disease(which is the fortay of the \nliscened physicians).\n\nI hope that this clears things up David.
This is to followup my previous reply on this topic, which it has been\npointed out to me might have been dangerously misleading in two spots.\n\n1.  I stated that psychotherapy (meaning talking therapy and so on) was used \n    to treat Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, which though sometimes true is \n    misleading.  It is not often found effective, particularly by itself.\n    Primary treatment today usually consists at least in part of drug\n    therapy.  The most current theories of this condition attribute \n    it to more to biological causes than psychological, in places where this\n    distinction becomes important.\n\n2.  I mentioned that the DSM-IIIR mentions 'impulses' as a possible \n	diagnostic marker.  However, this might look like something\n	people associate with psychotic conditions, uncontrollable or\n	unpredictable behaviors, which is NOT the case with OCD.  \n	One of the diagnostic criteria of OCD is that the individual\n	can and does suppress some of their 'impulses,' although they\n	are an unending source of anxiety.  \n	The obsessive thoughts and ritualistic actions usually associated with \n	OCD are most frequently very mundane and predictable, closer to\n	a superstitious nature than a dangerous nature for the most part.\n\n	Some references (one non-technical and several technical)\n	that someone was kind enough to supply for me\n	but was unable to post themself :\n\n\n	(technical refs) :\n\n\n\n\n\n	And thanks very much to those who supplied constructive  \n	criticism to my first post on OCD.  I hope this helps clarify\n	the parts that were misleading.\n\n						kind regards,
THE diarrhea problem?  WHAT diarrhea problem?  First, candidal overgrowth is\nnot a frequent problem during antibiotic therapy, and not all cases of\nantibiotic-related diarrhea have anything to do with candida.  But a case\nof vaginal candidiasis or oral thrush after antibiotic therapy isn't going\nto surprise anyone either.  That's not what people are disagreeing with.\n\n\nOh, really?  Where'd you come up with this?  You know, it's really\nappalling to see you try to comment authoritatively on clinical matters\nin a bizarre synthesis from reading reports in the literature.\nBobbing for citations in the research literature isn't medicine.\nI hope you're not giving the wrong idea to your medical students.
As I recall, it is a statistical anomaly because of the sample involved in the studies.\nI am certain that if it were true the Europeans would be cutting kids right & left.\n\n\n\nI think alot do it blindly because "Dad" had it done.  But there are many\nwho get bamboozled into it with the bogus cancer thing.  Awhile back some\nquack told a friend of mine that it would help prevent AIDS.\n\nYeah...Right! (Sarchasm)\n\n\nOh YEAH ?\n\nScene: Navy boot camp\n\nDI:		"Son, you smel awful! Dont you ever clean that thing?"\nRecruit:	"No Sir !"\nDI:		"Why the hell NOT!"\nRecruit:	"Your not sposed to touch down there?"\nDI:		"Why ?"\nRecruit:	"Cause thats the eye of god down there, an' your not s'posed to touch it..."\n\nThis did not happen 40 years ago, it happened 2 years ago.
But after you have taken antihistamines for a few nights, doesn't it start\nto have a paradoxical effect?  I used to take one every night for\nallergies and couldn't figure out why I developed bad insomnia.  Finally\nfigured out it was the antihistamines.  I would fall asleep for a few\nminutes but would awaken at the drop of a pin a little later and could not\nget back to sleep.  I don't have that problem since I stopped the\nantihistamines at bedtime.  ?
First off, use some decent terms if ya don't mind.  This is sci.med, not\nalt.sex.\n\nSecondly, how absolutely bogus to assume that "American's are just too hung\nup on the penis....blah,blah".  I think most American's don't care about\nanything so comlicated as that.  They just think it "looks nicer".  Ask \na few of them and see what response you get.  Others still opt for\ncircumcision due to religious traditions and beliefs.  Some think it is\neasier to clean.  Still others do it because "Daddy was".\n\nDont' be so naive as to think American's are afraid of sexuality.
I don't think there is a general distinction.  Rather, there are\ntwo classes of chronic hepatitis: chronic active hepatitis and chronic\npersistent hepatitis.  I can't think of any other disease where the\nterm persistent is used with or in preference to chronic.\n\nMuch as these two terms "chronic active" and "chronic persistent"\nsound fuzzy, the actual distinction between the two conditions\nis often fairly fuzzy as well.

The cesarean rate in the United States is the third highest among \n21 reporting countries, exceeded only by Brazil and Puerto Rico (1). This \nreport presents data on cesarean deliveries from CDC's National Hospital \nDischarge Survey (NHDS) for 1991 and compares these data with previous years. \n     Data on discharges from short-stay, nonfederal hospitals have been \ncollected annually since 1965 in the NHDS, conducted by CDC's National Center \nfor Health Statistics. For 1991, medical and demographic information were \nabstracted from a sample of 274,000 inpatients discharged from 484 \nparticipating hospitals. The 1991 cesareans and vaginal births after a prior \ncesarean (VBAC) presented in this report are based on weighted national \nestimates from the NHDS sample of approximately 31,000 (11%) women discharged \nafter delivery. The estimated numbers of live births by type of delivery were \ncalculated by applying cesarean rates from the NHDS to live births from \nnational vital registration data. Therefore, estimates of the number of \ncesareans in this report will not agree with previously published data based \nsolely on the NHDS (2). Stated differences in this analysis are significant at \nthe 95% confidence level, based on the two-tailed t-test with a critical value \nof 1.96. \n     In 1991, there were 23.5 cesareans per 100 deliveries, the same rate as \nin 1990 and similar to rates during 1986-1989 (Table 1). The primary cesarean \nrate (i.e., number of first cesareans per 100 deliveries to women who had no \nprevious cesareans) for 1986-1991 also was stable, ranging from 16.8 to 17.5. \nIn 1991, the cesarean rate in the South was 27.6, significantly (p<0.05) \nhigher than the rates for the West (19.8), Midwest (21.8), and Northeast \n(22.6). Rates were higher for mothers aged greater than or equal to 30 years \nthan for younger women; in proprietary hospitals than in nonprofit or \ngovernment hospitals; in hospitals with fewer than 300 beds than in larger \nhospitals; and for deliveries for which Blue Cross/Blue Shield * and other \nprivate insurance is the expected source of payment than for other sources of \npayment (Table 2). The same pattern characterized primary cesarean deliveries. \n     Since the early 1970s, the number and percentage of births to older women \nincreased; however, if the age distribution of mothers in 1991 had remained \nthe same as in 1986, the overall cesarean rate in 1991 would have been 23.3, \nessentially the same as the 23.5 observed. \n     Based on the NHDS, of the approximately 4,111,000 live births in 1991, an \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  1\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nestimated 966,000 (23.5%) were by cesarean delivery. Of these, an estimated \n338,000 (35.0%) births were repeat cesareans, and 628,000 (65.0%) were primary \ncesareans. Since 1986, approximately 600,000 primary cesareans have been \nperformed annually. In 1986, 8.5% of women who had a previous cesarean \ndelivered vaginally, compared with 24.2% in 1991. Of all cesareans in 1991, \n35.0% were associated with a previous cesarean, 30.4% with dystocia (i.e., \nfailure of labor to progress), 11.7% with breech presentation, 9.2% with fetal \ndistress, and 13.7% with all other specified complications. \n     The average hospital stay for all deliveries in 1991 was 2.8 days. In \ncomparison, the hospital stay for a primary cesarean delivery was 4.5 days, \nand for a repeat cesarean, 4.2 days -- nearly twice the duration for VBAC \ndeliveries (2.2 days) or for vaginal deliveries that were not VBACs (2.3 \ndays). In 1986, the average hospital stay for all deliveries was 3.2 days, for \nprimary cesareans 5.2 days, for repeat cesareans 4.7 days, and for VBAC and \nnon-VBAC vaginal deliveries 2.7 and 2.6 days, respectively. \n\nReported by: Office of Vital and Health Statistics Systems, National Center \nfor Health Statistics, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: The cesarean rate in the United States steadily increased from \n1965 through 1986; however, the findings in this report indicate that rates \nhave been stable since 1986 (3). Because there is little evidence that \nmaternal and child health status has improved during this time and because \ncesareans are associated with an increased risk for complications of \nchildbirth, a national health objective for the year 2000 (4) is to reduce the \noverall cesarean rate to 15 or fewer per 100 deliveries and the primary \ncesarean rate to 12 or fewer per 100 deliveries (objective 14.8). \n     Postpartum complications -- including urinary tract and wound infections \n-- may account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveries \nthan for vaginal births (5). Moreover, the prolonged hospital stays for \ncesarean deliveries substantially increase health-care costs. For example, in \n1991, the average costs for cesarean and vaginal deliveries were $7826 and \n$4720, respectively. The additional cost for each cesarean delivery includes \n$611 for physician fees and $2495 for hospital charges (6). If the cesarean \nrate in 1991 had been 15 (the year 2000 objective) instead of 23.5, the number \nof cesarean births would have decreased by 349,000 (617,000 versus 966,000), \nresulting in a savings of more than $1 billion in physician fees and hospital \ncharges. \n     Despite the steady increase in VBAC rates since 1986, several factors may \nimpede progress toward the year 2000 national health objectives for cesarean \ndelivery. For example, VBAC rates substantially reflect the number of women \noffered trial of labor, which has been increasingly encouraged since 1982 (7). \nOf women who are offered a trial of labor, 50%-70% could deliver vaginally (7) \n--a level already achieved by many hospitals (8). Trial of labor was routinely \noffered in 46% of hospitals surveyed in 1984 (the most recent year for which \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  2\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nnational data are available) (9) when the VBAC rate (according to NHDS data) \nwas 5.7%. The year 2000 objective specifies a VBAC rate of 35%, based on all \nwomen who had a prior cesarean, regardless of whether a trial of labor was \nattempted. To reach the overall cesarean rate goal, however, increases in the \nVBAC rate will need to be combined with a substantial reduction in the primary \nrate. \n     One hospital succeeded in reducing the rate of cesarean delivery by \napplying objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesarean \ndelivery, by requiring a second opinion, and by instituting a peer-review \nprocess (10). Other recommendations for decreasing cesarean delivery rates \ninclude eliminating incentives for physicians and hospitals by equalizing \nreimbursement for vaginal and cesarean deliveries; public dissemination of \nphysician- and hospital-specific cesarean delivery rates to increase public \nawareness of differences in practices; and addressing malpractice concerns, \nwhich may be an important factor in maintaining the high rates of cesarean \ndelivery (4). \n\nReferences\n\n1.

During May 1992, the Office of Medical Services, Department of \nState (OMS/DOS), and CDC were notified of an increased number of malaria cases \namong official U.S. personnel stationed in Kampala, Uganda. A review of the \nhealth records from the Embassy Health Unit (EHU) in Kampala indicated that 27 \ncases of malaria were diagnosed in official personnel from March through June \n1992 compared with two cases during the same period in 1991. EHU, OMS/DOS, and \nCDC conducted an investigation to confirm all reported malaria cases and \nidentify potential risk factors for malaria among U.S. Embassy personnel. This \nreport summarizes the results of the investigation. \n     Malaria blood smears from 25 of the 27 reported case-patients were \navailable for review by OMS/DOS and CDC. A case of malaria was confirmed if \nthe slide was positive for Plasmodium sp. Of the 25 persons, 17 were slide-\nconfirmed as having malaria. \n     A questionnaire was distributed to all persons served by the EHU to \nobtain information about residence, activities, use of malaria \nchemoprophylaxis, and use of personal protection measures (i.e., using bednets \nand insect repellents, having window and door screens, and wearing long \nsleeves and pants in the evening). Of the 157 persons eligible for the survey, \n128 (82%) responded. \n     Risk for malaria was not associated with sex or location of residence in \nKampala. Although the risk for malaria was higher among children aged less \nthan or equal to 15 years (6/32 19%) than among persons greater than 15 \nyears (11/94 12%), this difference was not significant (relative risk \nRR=1.6; 95% confidence interval CI=0.6-4.0). Eighty-two percent of the \ncases occurred among persons who had been living in Kampala for 1-5 years, \ncompared with those living there less than 1 year. Travel outside of the \nKampala area to more rural settings was not associated with increased risk for \nmalaria. \n     Four malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens were used by persons who \nparticipated in the survey: mefloquine, chloroquine and proguanil, chloroquine \nalone, and proguanil alone. In addition, 23 (18%) persons who responded were \nnot using any malaria chemoprophylaxis. The risk for malaria was significantly \nlower among persons using either mefloquine or chloroquine and proguanil (8/88 \n9%) than among persons using the other regimens or no prophylaxis (9/37 \n24%) (RR=0.4; 95% CI=0.2-0.9). Twelve persons not using prophylaxis reported \nside effects or fear of possible side effects as a reason. \n     The risk for malaria was lower among persons who reported using bednets \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nall or most of the time (2/27 7%) than among persons who sometimes or rarely \nused bednets (15/99 15%) (RR=0.5; 95% CI=0.1-2.0). The risk for malaria was \nalso lower among persons who consistently used insect repellent in the evening \n(0/16), compared with those who rarely used repellent (17/110 15%) (RR=0; \nupper 95% confidence limit=1.2). Risk for malaria was not associated with \nfailure to have window or door screens or wear long sleeves or pants in the \nevening. \n     As a result of this investigation, EHU staff reviewed with all personnel \nthe need to use and comply with the recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis \nregimens. EHU staff also emphasized the need to use personal protection \nmeasures and made plans to obtain insecticide-impregnated bednets and to \nprovide window and door screens for all personnel. \n\nReported by: U.S. Embassy Health Unit, Kampala, Uganda; Office of Medical \nSvcs, Dept of State, Washington, D.C. Malaria Br, Div of Parasitic Diseases, \nNational Center for Infectious Diseases, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: In Uganda, the increase in malaria among U.S. personnel was \nattributed to poor adherence to both recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis \nregimens and use of personal protection measures during a period of increased \nmalaria transmission and intensified chloroquine resistance in sub-Saharan \nAfrica. The findings in this report underscore the need to provide initial and \ncontinued counseling regarding malaria prevention for persons living abroad in \nmalaria-endemic areas -- preventive measures that are also important for \nshort-term travelers to such areas. \n     Mefloquine is an effective prophylaxis regimen in Africa and in most \nother areas with chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum; however, in some areas \n(e.g., Thailand), resistance to mefloquine may limit its effectiveness. In \nAfrica, the efficacy of mefloquine, compared with chloroquine alone, in \npreventing infection with P. falciparum is 92% (1 ). Mefloquine is safe and \nwell tolerated when given at 250 mg per week over a 2-year period. The risk \nfor serious adverse reactions possibly associated with mefloquine prophylaxis \n(e.g., psychosis and convulsions) is low (i.e., 1.3-1.9 episodes per 100,000 \nusers 2), while the risk for less severe adverse reactions (e.g., dizziness, \ngastrointestinal complaints, and sleep disturbances) is similar to that for \nother antimalarial chemoprophylactics (1). \n     Doxycycline has similar prophylactic efficacy to mefloquine, but the need \nfor daily dosing may reduce compliance with and effectiveness of this regimen \n(3,4). Chloroquine alone is not effective as prophylaxis in areas of intense \nchloroquine resistance (e.g., Southeast Asia and Africa). In Africa, for \npersons who cannot take mefloquine or doxycycline, chloroquine and proguanil \nis an alternative, although less effective, regimen. Chloroquine should be \nused for malaria prevention in areas only where chloroquine-resistant P. \nfalciparum has not been reported. \n     Country-specific recommendations for preventing malaria and information \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\non the dosage and precautions for malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens are \navailable from Health Information for International Travel, 1992 (i.e., \n"yellow book") (5) or 24 hours a day by telephone or fax, (404) 332-4555. \n\nReferences\n\n1.

Vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, and \npertussis during infancy and childhood have been administered routinely in the \nUnited States since the late 1940s and has been associated with a greater than \n90% reduction in morbidity and mortality associated with infection by these \norganisms. Because of the increasing number of vaccines now routinely \nrecommended for infants, a high priority is the development of combined \nvaccines that allow simultaneous administration with fewer separate \ninjections. \n     The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently licensed two new products \nfor vaccinating children against these diseases: 1) the Haemophilus b \nconjugate vaccine (tetanus toxoid conjugate, ActHIB Trademark), * for \nvaccination against Hib disease only and 2) a combined diphtheria and tetanus \ntoxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) and Hib conjugate vaccine \n(TETRAMUNE Trademark), a combination of vaccines formulated for use in \nvaccinating children against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and Hib disease. \n\n                               ActHIB Trademark \n\n     On March 30, 1993, the FDA approved a new Haemophilus b conjugate \nvaccine, polyribosylribitol phosphate-tetanus toxoid conjugate (PRP-T), \nmanufactured by Pasteur Merieux Serum et Vaccins and distributed as ActHIB \nTrademark by Connaught Laboratories, Inc. (Swiftwater, Pennsylvania). This \nvaccine has been licensed for use in infants in a three-dose primary \nvaccination series administered at ages 2, 4, and 6 months. Previously \nunvaccinated infants 7-11 months of age should receive two doses 2 months \napart. Previously unvaccinated children 12-14 months of age should receive one \ndose. A booster dose administered at 15 months of age is recommended for all \nchildren. Previously unvaccinated children 15-59 months of age should receive \na single dose and do not require a booster. More than 90% of infants receiving \na primary vaccination series of ActHIB Trademark (consecutive doses at 2, 4, \nand 6 months of age) develop a geometric mean titer of anti-Haemophilus b \npolysaccharide antibody greater than 1 ug/mL (4). This response is similar to \nthat of infants who receive recommended series of previously licensed \nHaemophilus b conjugate vaccines for which efficacy has been demonstrated in \nprospective trials. Two U.S. efficacy trials of PRP-T were terminated early \nbecause of the concomitant licensure of other Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  8\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nfor use in infants (4). In these studies, no cases of invasive Hib disease \nwere detected in approximately 6000 infants vaccinated with PRP-T. These and \nother studies suggest that the efficacy of PRP-T vaccine will be similar to \nthat of the other licensed Hib vaccines. TETRAMUNE Trademark \n     On March 30, 1993, the FDA approved a combined diphtheria and tetanus \ntoxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) and Haemophilus b conjugate \nvaccine. TETRAMUNE Trademark, available from Lederle-Praxis Biologicals (Pearl \nRiver, New York), combines two previously licensed products, DTP (TRIIMMUNOL \nRegistered, manufactured by Lederle Laboratories Pearl River, New York) and \nHaemophilus b conjugate vaccine (HibTITER Registered, manufactured by Praxis \nBiologics, Inc. Rochester, New York). \n     This vaccine has been licensed for use in children aged 2 months-5 years \nfor protection against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and Hib disease when \nindications for vaccination with DTP vaccine and Haemophilus b conjugate \nvaccine coincide. Based on demonstration of co mparable or higher antibody \nresponses to each of the components of the two vaccines, TETRAMUNE Trademark \nis expected to provide protection against Hib, as well as diphtheria, tetanus, \nand pertussis, equivalent to that of already licensed formulations of other \nDTP and Haemophilus b vaccines. \n     The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that \nall infants receive a primary series of one of the licensed Haemophilus b \nconjugate vaccines beginning at 2 months of age and a booster dose at age 12-\n15 months (5). The ACIP also recommends that all infants receive a four-dose \nprimary series of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine at 2, \n4, 6, and 15-18 months of age, and a booster dose at 4-6 years (6-8). A \ncomplete statement regarding recommendations for use of ActHIB Trademark and \nTETRAMUNE Trademark is being developed. \n\nReported by: Office of Vaccines Research and Review, Center for Biologics \nEvaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration.

Support tor the workshop was provided by the National \nInstitute of Dental Research, the National Cancer Institute, the National \nInstitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the NIH Office of AIDS Research, \nand the Procter and Gamble Company. \n     Among the topics discussed were: the epidemiology of HIV lesions; ethics, \nprofessional responsibility, and public policy; occupational issues; provision \nof oral care to the HIV-positive population; salivary HIV transmission and \nmucosal immunity; opportunistic infections; pediatric HIV infection; and \nwomen's issues. \n\n                                Recommendations\n\n     Recommendations emerged from the workshop to define the association \nbetween the appearance of oral lesions and rate of progression of HIV, to \nestablish a universal terminology for HIV-associated oral lesions, to look for \nmore effective treatments for oral manifestations, to expand molecular biology \nstudies to understand the relationship between HIV infection and common oral \nlesions, and to study the effects of HIV therapy on oral lesions. \n\n                                 Epidemiology\n\n     Since the First International Workshop on Oral Manifestations of HIV \nInfection was convened five years ago, the epidemiology of HIV infection has \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nradically changed.  In 1988, HIV infection was detected and reported largely \nin homosexual and bisexual males, intravenous drug users, and hemophiliacs.  \nToday, more HIV infection is seen in heterosexual males and females and in \nchildren and adolescents. \n     While the predominant impact of HIV infection has been felt in Africa, a \nmajor increase in infection rate is being seen in Southeast Asia as well.  \nFive hundred thousand cases have been reported to date in this region and more \nare appearing all the time. \n     Researchers are continuing to document the epidemiology of oral lesions \nsuch as hairy leukoplakia and candidiasis.  They also are beginning to explore \nthe relationships between specific oral lesions and HIV disease progression \nand prognosis. \n\n                            Social/political Issues\n\n     Discussion on the social and political implications of HIV infection \nfocused on changing the public's attitude that AIDS is retribution for \nindiscriminate sexual behavior and drug use.  Speakers also addressed health \ncare delivery for HIV-infected patients, and the need to educate the public \nabout what AIDS is, and how it is acquired. \n\n                          Saliva and Salivary Glands\n\n     Conference speakers described transmission issues and the HIV-inhibitory \nactivity of saliva, the strength of which varies among the different salivary \nsecretions.  Whole saliva has a greater inhibitory effect than submandibular \nsecretions, which in turn have a greater inhibitory effect than parotid \nsecretions.  Research has shown that at least two mechanisms are responsible \nfor salivary inhibitory activity.  They attributed the HIV-inhibitory effect \nof saliva to the 1) aggregation/agglutination of HIV by saliva, which may both \npromote clearance of virus and prevent it reaching a target cell, and 2) \ndirect effects on the virus or target cells. \n     Other topics discussed were the manifestation of salivary gland disease \nin HIV-infected persons and current research on oral mucosal immunity. \n\n                               Pediatric Issues\n\n     Pediatric AIDS recently has emerged as an area of intense interest.  With \nearly and accurate diagnosis and proper treatment, the life expectancy of HIV-\ninfected children has tripled.  The prevention of transmission of HIV from \nmother to child may be possible in many cases, particularly if the mother's \nsero-status is known prior to giving birth. \n\n                    Periodontal and Gingival Tissue Disease\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 12\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\n     Oral health researchers continue to explore periodontal diseases and \ngingivitis found in individuals with HIV infection.  Recommendations made at \nthe workshop include the standardization of terminology, refinement of \ndiagnostic markers, standardization of study design, and proper consideration \nof confounding variables resulting from periodontal therapy. \n\n                       Occupational and Treatment Issues\n\n     Occupational issues surrounding the treatment of HIV-infected individuals \nand treatment rendered by HIV-infected health care professionals still command \nconsiderable attention.  Factors under consideration include the cost/benefit \nof HIV testing, patient-to-health care provider transmission of HIV infection \nand the reverse, and the use of mainstream versus dedicated facilities for the \ntreatment of HIV-infected patients. \n     Conference participants anticipate that a third International Workshop on \nthe Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection will be held in five years or less.  \nProceedings from the second workshop will be published by the Quintessence \nCompany in late 1993.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--------- end of part 1 ------------

Moore et al. says that gp160 in a baculovirus \nexpression  system does not bind strongly to the CD4 receptor, and that this  \nrecombinant gp160 does not stimulate the same antibodies as the  HIV-1 virus \ndoes in natural infection.  But vaccination with  recombinant gp160 in \npatients infected with HIV-1 broadens HIV-1  specific envelope-directed immune \nresponses, including  crossreactive antibodies to gp160 epitopes and CD4 and \nCD8  cytotoxic T-cell responses.  Volvovitz and Smith claim that they  never \nintended their gp160 molecule to be identical to the native protein.  Antibody \nresponses against native HIV-1 proteins,  including the types described by \nMoore et al., exist in nearly  all AIDS patients but do not prevent \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 42\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nprogression of HIV disease.  In addition, the binding of gp120 or gp120-\nantibody complexes to  CD4 has been shown to interfere with antigen specific \nactivation  of CD4 cells and trigger programmed cell death in vitro, which  \nmay contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV infection.  The absence of CD4 \nbinding by the MicroGeneSys gp160 vaccine may therefore be viewed as an added \nsafety feature.  Phase I studies have  demonstrated stable CD4 counts, \nstimulation of cytotoxic T cells, and the suggestion of restoration of immune \nfunction.  Based on  these and other clinical results, MicroGeneSys gp160 was \nchosen  by researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden for the  first \nphase III vaccine therapy studies, conclude Volvovitz and  Smith. \n==================================================================    \n"HIV-1 Infection: Breast Milk and HIV-1 Transmission" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. \n341, No. 8850, P. 930  (Mok, Jacqueline) \n\n     There are still more questions than answers regarding  HIV-1-positive \nwomen breastfeeding their babies, writes  Jacqueline Mok of the Lancet.  The \nanti-infective properties of  milk are well documented.  While the numbers of \nleukocytes,  concentrations of lactoferrin and IgA, and lymphocyte mitogenic  \nactivity decline sharply during the first two to three months of  lactation to \nbarely detectable levels, lactoferrin and IgA then  increase from three to \ntwelve months, with 90 percent of total  IgA in milk being secretory IgA.  \nBreastfeeding protects infants  against gastrointestinal and respiratory \nillnesses, in both  normal and uninfected children born to HIV-positive \nmothers.  The Italian National Registry of AIDS discovered that breastfed HIV-\n1 infected children had a longer median incubation time (19 months) than \nbottlefed infants (9.7 months).  Breastfed children also had a slower \nprogression to AIDS.  There is no agreement on which  antibodies offer \nprotection against HIV-1 infection.  Studies of  the biological properties of \nmilk from 15 HIV-1 infected women  showed the presence of IgG and IgA \nantibodies against envelope  glycoproteins, as well as IgA antibodies against \ncore antigens.   Binding of HIV-1 to the CD4 receptor can be inhibited by a \nhuman  milk factor.  In the developing world, where infectious disease  and \nmalnutrition contribute significantly to infant mortality,  breast milk is \nstill the best food for infants, regardless of the mother's HIV status.  \nTransmission might be restricted by  breastfeeding after colostrum and early \nmilk have been expressed  and discarded.  The possibility remains that breast \nmilk could  protect the infant who is already infected with HIV at birth and  \nmay even delay progression to AIDS, concludes Mok. \n==================================================================    \n"Absence of HIV Transmission From an Infected Dentist to His Patients" Journal \nof the American Medical Association (04/14/93) Vol. 269,  No. 14, P. 1802  \n(Dickinson, Gordon M. et al.) \n\n     If universal precautions are practiced, the risk of HIV  transmission \nfrom dentist to patient appears to be infinitesimal, write Gordon M.

The \nresearchers contacted all  patients treated by a dentist with AIDS and \nattempts were made to contact all patients for HIV testing.  Living patients \nwith newly detected HIV infection were interviewed, and DNA sequence  analysis \nwas performed to compare genetic relatedness of their  HIV to that of the \ndentist.  Death certificates were obtained for deceased patients, and the \nmedical records of those with  diagnoses suggestive of HIV disease or drug \nabuse and those dying under the age of 50 years were examined in detail.  \nThere were  1,192 patients who had undergone 9,267 procedures, of whom 124  \nwere deceased.  An examination of the death certificates of  patients \nidentified five who had died with HIV infection, all of  whom were either \nhomosexuals or IV-drug users.  The researchers  were able to detect 962 of the \nremaining 1,048 patients, and 900  agreed to be tested.  HIV infection was \nreported in five of the  900 patients, including four who had clear evidence \nof risk  factors for the disease.  One patient who had only a single  \nevaluation by the dentist denied high-risk behavior.  Comparative DNA sequence \nanalysis showed that the viruses from the dentists  and these five patients \nwere not closely related.  The study  suggests the potential for HIV \ntransmission from a general  dentist to his patients is minimal in a setting \nin which  universal precautions are strictly observed, conclude Dickinson  et \nal. \n       ================================================================   \n                                April 22, 1993 \n       ================================================================   \n"AIDS Patients are Susceptible to Recurrences of TB, Study Says" Washington \nPost (04/22/93), P. A13 \n\n     Tuberculosis can strike AIDS patients more than once, which makes the \nresurging health hazard harder to control, according to a  study published in \ntoday's New England Journal of Medicine.   People who contract TB usually \ndevelop an immunity that protects  them if they are exposed to the bacteria \nagain.  But a person  whose immune system is depleted may not be able to fight \noff a  new TB infection, doctors found.  Peter M. Small of the Howard  Hughes \nMedical Institute at Stanford University, director of the  study, said that in \norder to protect against reinfection, it may  be necessary for some people to \nuse TB medicines permanently.   The study examined the genetic makeup of TB \nbacteria and how the  germs changed over time in 17 patients at Kings County \nHospital  in New York. \n================================================================    \n"HIV-1 Infection: Breast Milk and HIV-1 Transmission" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. \n341, No. 8850, P. 930  (Mok, Jacqueline) \n\n     There are still more questions than answers regarding  HIV-1-positive \nwomen breastfeeding their babies, writes  Jacqueline Mok of the Lancet.

In the Lancet's March 13 issue, Schechter et al. call Duesberg's  \nhypothesis that injected and orally used recreational drugs and  AZT lead to \nAIDS, "a hindrance to public health initiatives."   However, their hypothesis \nthat HIV is the cause of AIDS has not  attained any public health benefits.  \nThe U.S. government spends  $4 billion annually, but no vaccine, no therapy, \nno prevention,  and no AIDS control have resulted from work on this \nhypothesis.   Schechter et al. conclude that HIV has a key role in CD4  \ndepletion and AIDS based on epidemiological correlations with  antibodies \nagainst HIV and with self reported recreational drug  use among homosexuals \nfrom Vancouver.  However, their survey  neglects to disprove Duesberg's drug-\nAIDS hypothesis, because it  does not provide controls--i.e., confirmed drug-\nfree AIDS  cases--and because it does not quantify drug use and ignores AZT  \nuse altogether.  To refute Duesberg's hypothesis Schechter would  have to \nproduce a controlled study demonstrating that over a  period of up to 10 years \nHIV-positive patients who use  recreational drugs or AZT or both have the same \nAIDS risks as  positives who do not do so.  The 10 year period is claimed by  \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 45\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nproponents of the HIV hypothesis to be the time needed for HIV to cause AIDS.  \nAlternatively, they could show that HIV-free  individuals who have used drugs \nfor 10 years never get  AIDS-defining illnesses, concludes Duesberg. \n================================================================   \n"Rapid Decline of CD4+ Cells After IFNa Treatment in HIV-1  Infection" \nLancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 959   (Vento, Sandro et al.) \n\n     Interferon (IFN), which induces autoantibodies and autoimmune  diseases \nin some settings, may hasten CD4 T-cell loss in some  HIV-1 infected \nindividuals through the amplification of harmful  "autoimmune" reactions, \nwrite Sandro Vento et al. of the A.  Pugliese Hospital in Catanzaro, Italy.  \nThe researchers report  three asymptomatic HIV-1 infected individuals with \nhepatitis C  Virus related chronic active hepatitis (CAH) who had a rapid,  \nprofound decline of CD4 cells after IFN.  All three patients  throughout the \nobservation were consistently negative for serum  HIV p24 antigen and had \ncirculating antibodies to p24.  Sera from all three patients, obtained at the \nend of IFN treatment and  testing in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, \ncontained high  titres of antibodies reacting to a sequence located in the  \naminoterminal of the beta chain of all human HLA class II  antigens, \nhomologous to a sequence located in the carboxy  terminus of HIV-1 gp41.  \nThese autoantibodies, which also  recognize "native" class II molecules and \nmay contribute to the  elimination of CD4 T cells "in vivo", were at low tires \n(50-100)  in all three patients six months after stopping IFN.  Such  \nautoantibodies were not detected in 28 other patients with HIV  infection and \nHCV related CAH treated with IFN and who did not  experience CD4 T-cell loss \nin some HIV-1 infected individuals  through the amplification of harmful \n"autoimmune" reactions.  The subjects had A1; B8; DR3; and B35, DR1 HLA \nantigen combinations  which are linked with a more rapid fall in CD4 cell \ncounts and  clinical progression of HIV-1 disease.  IFN can induce a very  \nrapid decline of CD4 cells and should be used cautiously in  patients with \nthese HLA haplotypes, the researchers conclude. \n       ================================================================   \n                                April 23, 1993 \n       ================================================================    \n"TB Makes a Comeback" State Government News (04/93) Vol. 36, No. 4, P. 6   \n(Voit, William and Knapp, Elaine S.) \n\n     Although tuberculosis was once believed to be eliminated in the  United \nStates, it is emerging again among the homeless, AIDS  patients, immigrants, \nminorities, and prisoners.  Dr. Lee B.  Reichman, professor of medicine at the \nUniversity of New Jersey  Medical School and president of the American Lung \nAssociation,  said, "Right now, it's a big city problem, but potentially it's  \neveryone's problem."  The ALA predicts that 10 million Americans  are infected \nwith TB, and about 10 percent of them will develop  the disease because their \nimmune systems are depressed,  especially those with AIDS or HIV.

State health officials believe the TB is also  spreading because \nthose who are most susceptible are the least  likely to follow through with \ntreatment.  In addition, the  increase is attributed to a shortage of public \nhealth services.   In New York City, TB is an epidemic "because the number of \ncases  is increasing faster than we can treat people," said Dr. George  \nDiferdinando, director of the New York State TB Control.   According to \nDiferdinando, curbing the spread of TB entails  keeping 85 percent or more of \ndiagnosed TB cases in treatment.   About 40 percent of infected New York City \nresidents don't  complete therapy.  When TB patients don't finish taking their  \nmedication, multi-drug resistant TB can develop, which requires  taking more \nexpensive drugs and can take two years instead of the normal six months to \ntreat.\n ================================================================    \n "Increasing Frequency of Heterosexually Transmitted AIDS in  Southern \nFlorida: Artifact or Reality?" American Journal of Public Health (04/93) Vol. \n83, No. 4, P. 571  (Nwanyanwu, Okey C. et al.) \n\n     The alarmingly high rate of heterosexually acquired AIDS cases in \nsouthern Florida was partially related to misclassification of  risk, write \nOkey C. Nwanyanwu et al. of the Centers for Disease  Control in Atlanta, Ga.  \nThe researchers investigated 168 such  AIDS cases from Broward and coastal \nPalm Beach counties.  All of  these cases attributed to heterosexual \ntransmission reported  sexual contact with bisexual men, injecting drug users, \nor  persons born in countries where heterosexual contact is the  primary route \nof HIV transmission.  Medical records of patients,  in addition to records \nfrom social services, HIV counseling and  testing centers, and sexually \ntransmitted disease (STD) clinics  were reviewed.  If no other HIV risk factor \nwas found from  medical record review, patients were interviewed using a  \nstandardized questionnaire.  Once STD clinic and other medical  records were \nreviewed, 29 men and 7 women were reclassified into  other HIV transmission \ncategories.  After adjustments were made  for the reclassification, the \npercentage of AIDS cases reported  from Palm Beach and Broward counties \nbetween January 1, 1989, and March 31, 1990, that was attributed to \nheterosexual transmission  decreased from 10 percent to 6 percent among men \nand from 33  percent to 28 percent among women.  While the percentage of  \nheterosexually transmitted AIDS cases in southern Florida  decreased after \nadjustment was made for reclassified cases, it  still remained above the \nnational average, the researchers  conclude.\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 47\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\n\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n                                AIDS Statistics\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n                            World Health Organization, Geneva\n                        Organisation mondiale de la Sante, Geneve\n\n                              WEEKLY EPIDEMIOLOGICAL RECORD\n                           RELEVE EPIDEMIOLOGIQUE HEBDOMADAIRE\n\n15 January 1993 -

At that time he \nsaw a gastroenterologist and has tried acid controllers (Mylanta, \nTagamet), as well as a restricted diet and raising the head of his bed.  \nThese treatments were not effective and because the damage was \nworsening, he opted for a surgical repair 3 months ago.  He was told \nthere were two repair techniques that could fix the problem; a Nissen \nwrap and a "Hill Repair".  He opted for the "Hill Repair". He recovered \nvery well from the surgery itself but the pain he had originally is worse \nand in addition he now has trouble swallowing (including saliva).\n\nThe doctor now wants to do an endoscopy and has also informed him \nthat a biopsy might be necessary if he has a pre-cancerous condition \nwhich he called "Barrett's Syndrome". If he can't avoid having reflux will \nhe necessarily get cancer?\n\nBasically, if anyone has any information on what he should do now, I'd \nappreciate it.\n\nThanks,
Hello, a friend is under going kemotherapy(sp?) for breast cancer. I'm\ntrying to learn what I can about it. Any info would be appreciated.\nThanks.
One possible reason is that file' is made with sassafras leaves, while root\nbeer was made with sassafras bark or root bark.  The leaves contain either\nno\nor less saffrole than the bark.\n\nThere is also some sort of treatment which putatively removes saffrole from\nsassafras products.  I have some concentrated sassafras tea extract which\nis\nclaimed to have the saffrole removed.\n\n\nWell, the last time that I went to the store to buy sassafras bark to make \nroot beer, there was a sign saying that it wasn't sold for human\nconsumption.\nAlso, when I asked the person if they had wild cherry bark and wintergreen\nbark,\nshe made a point of telling me that I couldn't buy sassafras for human \nconsumption.\n\nI find the fact that some people reckless enough to step into an automobile\nlive\nin fear of dropping dead because of a pork rib quite funny, in a sick way.\n\nEric Pepke                                     INTERNET:\npepke@gw.scri.fsu.edu\nSupercomputer Computations Research Institute  MFENET:   pepke@fsu\nFlorida State University                       SPAN:     scri::pepke\nTallahassee, FL 32306-4052                     BITNET:   pepke@fsu
Non-steroid.  Proventil is a brand of albuterol, a bronchodilator.  \n\nRegards,
It is NOT a homeopathic remedy. Improvement began in a few months.\nI am allergic to bermuda grass and if anyone nearby was mowing a lawn\nmy nose would start to run.  Now I can walk right by and it doesn't bother\nme at all.  The same success with desert ragweed.
Did your ENT also tell you that this procedure may remove warts from the soles\nof your feet and improve your sex life?
Depression can also have various chemical (environmental) components.\nI noticed that I became depressed in various buildings, and at home\nwhen the air conditioning was on. Subsequent testing revealed that\nI was allergic to stemphyllium, a mold commonly found in air conditioners.\nAfter I began taking antigens, that problem disappeared.
Somewhere or other I read that when a person of Chinese heritage was\ntold that he had high blood pressure he responded by eating celery\n(sorry, I don't recall the "dosage").  Apparently this is supposed to\nwork in reducing hypertension.\n\nCan anyone out there verify this?  And if it does work, does anyone\nknow the appropriate amounts and possible side-effects?
I tried Prozac a few months ago, and had some insomnia from it, but no\nanxiety or jitters.  I probably could have lived with the insomnia if the\nProzac had done any good, but it only provided a tiny benefit.  Maybe\nbecause the person who prescribed it didn't know much and gave up after a\n20mg dose didn't work.\n\nNow I'm seeing a psychiatrist who has put me on Zoloft (another serotonin\nreuptake inhibitor like Prozac).  One pill/day (50mg) seemed to help some. \nNow I'm trying 100mg/day.  Zoloft has fewer and milder side effects than\nProzac.  I think my doctor said that only 4% of the people taking Zoloft\nhave to discontinue it because of side effects.  The only problem I'm\nhaving is some minor GI distress, but nothing too annoying.  Hopefully the\nZoloft will work.  Maybe your friend should try this one next.\n\nMy psychiatrist's strategy seems to be to first try one of the serotonin\ndrugs, usually Prozac.  If that works, great.  If it works but has too many\nside effects, try Zoloft or maybe Paxil.  If the serotonin drugs don't work\nat all, try one of the tricyclics like desipramine.\n\n\nHaving a doctor who knows something about antidepressants can make a big\ndifference.  My psychiatrist claims that most GPs and FPs don't have much\nexperience in this area, and from what I've seen I'm inclined to believe\nhim.  I think I know more about antidepressants than the people at my\nfamily practitioner's office.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not a doctor; what I know about this comes from talking to\nmy psychiatrist and reading sci.med.
Nor is it mine.  What I tried to explain to Marty was that it is clearly\nunderstood that antibiotic exposure is a risk factor for fungal infections\n- which is not the same as saying bacteria prevent fungal infections. \nMarty made this sound like a secret  known only to veternarians and\nbiochemists.  Anyone who has treated a urinary tract infection knowns\nthis. At some centers pre-op liver transplant patients receive bowel\ndecontamination directed at retaining "good" anaerobic flora in an attempt\nto prevent fungal colonization in this soon-to-be high risk group.  I also\nuse lactobacillus to treat enteral nutrition associated diarrhea (that may\nbe in part due to alterations in gut flora).  However, it is NOT part of\nmy routine practice to "reinnoculate" patients with "good" bacteria after\nantibiotics.  I have seen no data on this practice preventing or treating\nfungal infections in at risk patients.  Whether or not it is a "logical\nextension" from the available observations I'll leave to those of you who\nbase strong opinions and argue over such speculations in the absence of\nclinical trials. \n  One place such therapy has been described is in treating particularly\nrecalcitrant cases of C. difficile colitis (NOT a fungal infection). There\nare case reports of using stool (ie someone elses) enemas to repopulate\nthe patients flora.  Don't try this at home. \n\n\n  Except that it isn't. At least symptomatically apparent disease.\n\n\n  Seems like this is an excellent argument for ignoring anecdotal\nconventional wisdom (a euphemism for no data) and doing a good clinical\ntrial, like: \n\nAU   Dismukes-W-E.  Wade-J-S.  Lee-J-Y.  Dockery-B-K.  Hain-J-D.\nTI   A randomized, double-blind trial of nystatin therapy for the\n     candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome [see comments]\nSO   N-Engl-J-Med.  1990 Dec 20.  323(25).  P 1717-23.\n     psychological tests. RESULTS. The three active-treatment regimens\n     and the all-placebo regimen\n     significantly reduced both vaginal and systemic symptoms (P less than\n     0.001), but nystatin did not reduce the systemic symptoms\n     significantly more than placebo. [ . . . ]\n     CONCLUSIONS. In women with presumed candidiasis\n     hypersensitivity syndrome, nystatin does not reduce systemic or\n     psychological symptoms significantly more than placebo. Consequently,\n     the empirical recommendation of long-term nystatin therapy for such\n     women appears to be unwarranted.\n\n  Does this trial address every issue raised here, no.  Jon Noring was not\nsurprised at this negative trial since they didn't use *Sporanox* (despite\nCrook's recommendation for Nystatin).  Maybe they didn't avoid those\ncarbohydrates . . . \n\n\n  Marty, you've also changed the terrain of the discussion from empiric\nitraconazole for undocumented chronic fungal sinusitis with systemic\nhypersensitivity symptoms (Noring syndrome) to the yoghurt and vitamin\ntherapy of undocumented candida enteritis (Elaine Palmer syndrome) with\nsystemic symptoms.  There is significant difference between the cost and\nrisk of these two empiric therapeutic trials.  Are we talking about "real"\ncandida infections, the whole "yeast connection" hypothesis, the efficacy\nof routine bacterial repopulation in humans, or the ability of anecdotally\neffective therapies (challenged by a negative randomized trial) to confirm\nan etiologic hypothesis (post hoc ergo propter hoc).  We can't seem to\nfocus in on a disease, a therapy, or a hypothesis under discussion.
I cured mine with Bag Balm which I bought at the local farm\nsupply store. It is relatively cheap and works in a few days.\nThe product was developed to treat sore udders.
Cute anecdote, but hardly indicative of the population.  From the responses\nI've received to that post (all from men, by the way) I get the impression\nthat unless a person is willing to drop down and masturbate whenever the\nneed or desire strikes, then that person is very hung up on sex.\n\nWith tv programs about "boobs" (Seinfeld) and "masturbation (again Seinfeld)\nand with condoms being handed out in high schools and with the teenage\npregnancy rate and the high abortion rate here in the States, I would\nnot assume that we American's are frightened of sex.  Rather we are a bit\nstupid about it.  Healthy sexuality does not require flamboyance or\npromiscuity.  It requires responsibility.
Any rocky mountain spotted fever experts out there ?\n\nThe doctor thinks a friend might have this.\nThe question is, doesn't the tick have to bite you ?\n\nYou frequently find a tick crawling on you after a walk\nin the woods around here, but you tend to notice it before\nit bites you; pulling one out of your skin is something\nyou're not likely to forget.\n\nCan you get the fever without it biting you ?  Do they\nsometimes bite you and then let go so you don't realize\nyou were bitten ?  I know they will let go once they've had\ntheir fill, but you certainly would notice this (arggh).\n\nSo how do you get the fever if you never pulled a tick\noff yourself (as opposed to finding one merely crawling\non you) ?
[Partial deletion]\n\nNice explanation except that it isn't N-hydroxylation that causes the\nformation of the N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), but rather a\ndirect two-electron oxidation. In addition, there is one school of thought\nthat contends that oxidative stress rather than arylation of protein\nis the more critical factor in the hapatotoxcity of acetaminophen.  \n\nAs far as drug toxicities go, acetaminophen has and continues to be one\nof the most intensely scrutinized. An excellent recent review of the topic\ncan be found in: \n\n	Vermeulen, Bessems and Van de Straat. 	\n	Molecular Aspects of Paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity and its\n	Mechanism-Based Prevention. Drug Metabolism Reviews, 24(3) 367-\n	407 (1992).\n\n	(Acetaminophen is known as paracetamol in Europe)\n\nI couldn't agree with you more about what an awful way to die a toxic\ndose of acetaminophen causes.  I've heard a number of descriptions by\nphysicians associated with poison control centers, and they describe a\nlingering very painful death.
I too have had premature ventricular heartbeat, starting in 1974.  (These \nare not, by the way, "extra" heartbeats.  This is how they feel, and \nthis is how I described them initially to the doctor, but they're \nactually *premature* heartbeats.  I would sometimes experience a lapse \nafter one of these that went on for a suffocatingly long period of time, \nmaking me wonder if my heart were ever going to beat again.) \n\nI had them persistently for eighteen years.  Then I went on a low-fat \ndiet, and they just stopped.  I haven't had a single episode of PVH \nfor almost two years.  I know:  correlation does not imply causation. \nThis is just FWIW.
I think I can explain the "missing part of a leaf" story.\n\nI have actually seen a reproduction of that particular Kirlian\nphotograph, in a book compiled by people who were enthusiasts of\nKirlian photography.  "That particular photograph" ... ?  That's\nright, the effect has been observed only once.  Even the writers of\nthe book were inclined to disbelieve in it.  \n\nI conjecture that the maker of that photograph began by placing\na whole leaf between two plates and taking its Kirlian photo.\nFor his next experiment, he cut the leaf in half, put one half down\nbetween the same two plates, and took another K. p.  The\n"missing half" effect was created by water, oils, etc. left behind \nafter the first photo.\n\nThis explanation must be tentative, because after all I wasn't there\nwhen it happened.

A placebo is an accepted treatment at times. \n\n\nWhy should it?  Placebos are effective under certain circumstances.  That's\nwhy they're used.  \n\nActually, I don't know know anyone who has actually gotten a "sugar pill".\nI don't know how it could be done, since prescription drugs are always\nlabeled, and it's easy enough to find out what's in a pill if you have the\nname.\n\nIt's more common to prescribe a drug which is effective for something, just\nnot for what you have.  Antibiotics for viral infections are the most\ncommon such placebo. \n\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by this.  What do you think you're paying for?\nYou're not entitled to a prescription drug just because you pay for a\ndoctor's appointment.  \n\n--
Elisabeth, let's set the record straight for the nth time, I have not read \n"The Yeast Connection".  So anything that I say is not due to brainwashing \nby this "hated" book.  It's okay I guess to hate the book, by why hate me?\nElisabeth, I'm going to quote from Zinsser's Microbiology, 20th Edition.\nA book that you should be familiar with and not "hate". "Candida species \ncolonize the mucosal surfaces of all humans during birth or shortly \nthereafter.  The risk of endogenous infection is clearly ever present.  \nIndeed, candidiasis occurs worldwide and is the most common systemic \nmycosis."  Neutrophils play the main role in preventing a systemic \ninfection(candidiasis) so you would have to have a low neutrophil count or \n"sick" neutrophils to see a systemic infection.  Poor diet and persistent \nparasitic infestation set many third world residents up for candidiasis.\nYour assessment of candidiasis in the U.S. is correct and I do not dispute \nit.\n\nWhat I posted was a discussion of candida blooms, without systemic \ninfection.  These blooms would be responsible for local sites of irritation\n(GI tract, mouth, vagina and sinus cavity).  Knocking down the bacterial \ncompetition for candida was proposed as a possible trigger for candida \nblooms.  Let me quote from Zinsser's again: "However, some factors, such as \nthe use of a broad-spectrum antibacterial antibiotic, may predispose to \nboth mucosal and systemic infections".  I was addressing mucosal infections\n(I like the term blooms better).  The nutrition course that I teach covers \nthis effect of antibiotic treatment as well as the "cure".  I guess that \nyour nutrition course does not, too bad.  \n\n\n\nMy, my Elisabeth, do I detect a little of Steve Dyer in you?  If you \nnoticed my faculty rank, I'm a biochemist, not a microbiologist.\nCandida is classifed as a fungus(according to Zinsser's).  But, as you point \nout, it displays dimorphism.  It is capable of producing yeast cells, \npseudohyphae and true hyphae.  Elisabeth, you are probably a microbiologist \nand that makes a lot of sense to you.  To a biochemist, it's a lot of \nGreek.  So I called it a yeast-like fungus, go ahead and crucify me.\n\nYou know Elisabeth, I still haven't been able to figure out why such a small \nlittle organism like Candida can bring out so much hostility in people in \nSci. Med.  And I must admitt that I got sucked into the mud slinging too.\nI keep hoping that if people will just take the time to think about what \nI've said, that it will make sense.  I'm not asking anyone here to buy into \n"The Yeast Connection" book because I don't know what's in that book, plain \nand simple. And to be honest with you, I'm beginning to wish that it was never \nwritten.
<:  ....other good stuff about the Drs idiocy\n\nOk, much as I hate to do it, here I am posting an EVEN BETTER "Dr. Idiot"\nstory.\n\n\nI was in my 18th hour of labor, had been pushing for 4.5 hours and was\nexhausted.  My OB and I decided to go for a csec.  The OB called in\nthe anesthisiologist (sp?) and asked him to help prep me for surgery.\n\nAFTER, watching me go through a couple contractions, the anes (or anus as\nI like to refer to him) said, "Well, I am off duty now." (still staring\nbetween my legs at that).  The OB asked to go call whomever it was who\nwas on duty and ask him/her how long it would take...and if it was going\nto take more than a few minutes, to please stay even though he was off duty.\n\nThe anes. went out, supposedly to call the on-call anes.   In a couple of\nminutes the nurse came running in to tell the OB that the anes. had left\nwithout even trying to get ahold of the on-call.  It was the only time \nduring my labor that I swore.  The on-call anes. took 20 minutes to get\nthere.\n\nCome to find out, the anes. had only just gone off duty (about 2 minutes\nbefore) and technically was supposed to stay in the hospital until the\nnext on-call got there.  Good thing for all of us (especially him) that\nit was not a critical emergency.  But boy would I love to knock that\nfellow's ouchie places ...just to let him be in pain a\nfew little minutes.\n\n\n\nI have run into "Dr. Idiots", "Mechanic Idiots", "Clerk Idiots" and "Etc.\nIdiots" in my time, but this fellow I would like to have words with.
Forgive me, but just the other day I read on some newsgroup or other a\nphysician's posting about the theraputic uses of vitamin B6.  I can't\nseem to locate the article, but I recall there was mention of some safe\nlimits.\n\nI looked at a "Balanced 100" time release formulation from Walgreen's\nand noted that the 100 mg of B6 was some thousands times the RDA.  Is\nthis safe?!?.\n\nAlso what was the condition that B6 was theraputic for?\n\nMail would be just fine if you don't want to clog the net.
This is not an unusual practice if the doctor is also a\nmember of a nudist colony.
If I prescribe itraconazole for a patient's sinusitis neither the AMA,\nFDA, State Licensing Board, nor ABFP will be knocking on my door to ask\nwhy.  This is a specious argument.\n\n\nAmong other things, how to evaluate new theories and treatments.\n\n\nFunny, I thought it meant "one who fraudulently misrepresents his\nability and experience in the diagnosis and treatment of disease or\nthe effects to be achieved by the treatment he offers" (Dorland's\n27th).  Certainly more precision than conveyed by "chronic yeast".\n\n\nThe inability to discriminate between fraudulent or erroneous\nrepresentations is far more frightening.  It is fraud to promote a\ntreatment where the evidence for it is either lacking or against it\nand the quacksalver knows so, or error if the honest practitioner\ndoesn't know so.  Failure to speak out against either bespeaks\nincompetency.\n\n\nMay I reply - seriously - that if the practitioners and proponents of\nnon-scientific medicine have left their minds so open that the parts\nof their brains that do critical evaluation have fallen out, they should\nlearn to edit their newsgroup headers to conform to the existing\nhierarchy and divisions.
See the rec.pets.cats FAQ or any doctor or vet for more information.\n\nI am not any of the above, but we do have a couple of cats.\n\nIt is transmitted through the fecal matter, so a pregnant woman should\navoid cleaning the cat tray and you should both wash hands before\npreparing or eating meals.  The latter is sound advice at any time of\ncourse.\n\nApart from that, its no great problem.  You certainly do not need to\nget rid of your cats.\n\nPaul.
Speaking of educational systems, I recently had a colleague\ntell me that the reason one of our fifth grade students is so\nphysically developed is because she was sexually abused as a younger\nchild. This, she went on to say, kicks the pituitary gland into\naction and causes puberty.
I posted about a "pulse of (relaxation) electricity".  I now think\nit more like a pulse of "relaxation" or comfort than a pulse of\nelectricity.  It is what you feel if you are overwhelmed by a feeling\nof comfort, such as seeing or thinking about something beautiful.\n\n     Another thing.  When you sleep, you lie down facing up, with your\npalms aside of you and facing down on the surface of the bed.  Then you\nrelax, and there start involuntary nerve firings inside your flesh.  So,\nyou feel a "shiver" below the surface of the skin (not heart-beat).\nThen this shiver increases, and comes up to your head, and the roam you\nhear loudens.  (Note that you always hear a high-pitch when you lie down\nin bed; this is just the noise of your blood running in your ear.)  This\nroam is different from the high pitch, but follows the shiver of your\nbody.\n\n     "Shiver" is not the word.  It may be called a mild vibration or quake.\nWhat is this shiver and roam?  Can I use this to induce out-of-body\nexperience?
Assuming that the wax is causing hearing loss, congestion or popping\nin the ears, you can try some cautious tepid water irrigation with a\nbulb syringe, but it is awkward to do for oneself and may not work or\nmay even make things worse.  (My wife would disagree, she does it\nsuccessfully every six months or so.)  In any case DO NOT ATTEMPT\nANYTHING WITH Q-TIPS!!!\n\nMy experience has been that this is initially best handled by a\nEar/Nose/Throat person.  I say initially, because an ENT can evaluate\nwhether or not you might have success on your own with a little\ninstruction.\n\nI am not a physician (obviously, because I eschew the term\notolaryngologist); this posting is based only on personal experience.\n\n========================================================================\n\n<Usual Disclaimer>        "The best is the enemy of the good" - Voltaire\n\nLeon Traister (lmtra@amdahl.uts.amdahl.com)
You've asked a toughie of a question.  There are many different drugs which\nare used for chemotherapy.\n\nThe overall purpose of chemotherapy (don't worry about the spelling.  Some of\nthese crazy medical words are impossible to spell! :-) is to either destroy\ncancer cells or to keep them from growing.  Different drugs have different\neffects on cancer cells, and therefore, it is not uncommon to use more than\none drug at a time.\n\nSome chemotherapeutic drugs are effective anytime during the growth cycle\nof a cell.  Others work only at specific times during the cell cycle.\n\nThe first phase of the cell cycle is G1; it is when the protein synthesis\nand RNA systhesis occurs.  In the second phase, S, synthesis of DNA occurs.\nThe third phase is G2; The DNA splits and RNA and protein are synthesized \naagain.  In the fourth phase, M (or Mitosis), the cell may divide.\n\nThere are drugs which are effective in each phase.  Some stop DNA synthesis.\nOthers stop the cell from dividing. Others wreck protein synthesis.\nAt any rate, the end result that is being sought is for the cancer cells\nto stop growing.\n\nIf what you are seeking is "practical" advice, I apologize for rambling\non the techno stuff.  Some side effects are pretty common.  Chemo. drugs\nare rather nasty.  It can cause a person to lose their appetite and to \nexperience nausea and vomiting.  Things to help this include eating small\nfrequent meals.  It is also suggested that if nausea/vomiting (hereafter\nknown as n/v) occurs that the person notify the doctor; there are medicines\ntthat help nausea.  Diarrhea can be an effect.  Antidiarrheal medications \ncan be given, and good skincare and fluid intake are important.\n\nProbably the one of biggest concsern is hair loss.  This does not always\nhappen.  It depends on what drugs are being given, and on the person \nthemself.  Different people taking the same drug can and do have different\nside effects.  I have seen some literature which states that wearing a snug\nheadband and/or wearing an ice cap can help reduce hair loss, presumably\nby reducing blood flow to the scalp.  If anyone has seen research on this\ntoo, I would love to see it, and possibly some bib data.\n\nI highly recommend making contact with the American Cancer Society.\nThey have a vast selection of literature and information.  In addition,\nif your friend has had a mastectomy, I highly recommend "Reach for Recovery".\nIt is a support group comprised entirely of women who have lost a breast \nbecause of cancer.  They can offer some excellent support and suggestions.\n\nIf you have further questions, please send me E-mail.  I hav some good\naccess to information, and I enjoy trying to help other people.
Hi Stephen\nEar wax is a healthy way to help prevent ear infections, both by preventing\na barrier and also with some antibiotic properties.  Too much can block the\nexternal auditory canal (the hole in the outside of the ear) and cause some \nhearing problems.  It is very simple, and safe, to remove excess wax on your\nown, or at your physician's office.  You can take a syringe (no needles!) and\nfill it with 50% warm water (cold can cause fainting) and 50% OTC hydrogen\nperoxide.  Then point the ear towards the ceiling ( about 45 degrees up)\nand insert the tip of the syringe (helps to have someone else do this!) and  \nfirmly expell the solution.  Depending on the size of the syringe and the\ntenacity of the wax, this could take several rinses.  If you place a bowl \nunder the ear to catch the water, it will be much drier :-).  You can buy\na syringe with a special tip at your local pharmacy, or just use whatever\nyou may have.  If wax is old, it will be harder, and darker.  You can try\nadding a few drops of olive oil into the ear during a shower to soften up\nthe wax.  Do this for a couple days, then try syringing again.  It is also\nsafe to point your ear up at the shower head, and allow the water to rinse\nit out.\nGood Luck\n-heather
For one week, she probably wants to see how you react to the diet. If it\nchanges anything. \n\nYou can live on the diet but you need to up your calories. Where before you\nhad a pat of butter now you need a medium apple (probably microwave\ncooked).  Smaller meals but more of them. Not terrific amounts of meat, it's\nhard to digest anyway. \n\nFor comfort and to make the carbohydrate meal "last" longer eat pasta or\nrice which give their calories up slowly rather than bread or corn. Maybe\nsmaller meals as you may be getting less room in the stomach area. Is the\nbaby still coming up. Is it starting to push or rub under your ribs? How\ntight are your clothes. You shouldn't be wearing any clothing that compresses \nyour middle. Be sure not to "suck in" your stomach when sitting, again it\nwill put pressure on the digestive tract. \n\nTry laying on your sides, back,\nand stay in reclining positions for the many hours you are being inactive.\nEasier on your legs (circulation) as well. You might try letting the baby\n"turn" or at least not be forced under the ribs during the last months.\nWhen you are shortwaisted it's easy for that baby to end up right under the\ndiaphram, especially if you have tight abdominal muscles. If I had my\nsecond one to do over again I think I'd have tried to loosen up since he\ndidn't turn sideways until late and the relief was enormous.\n\n\nMaybe this doctor does have a thing about weight gain in pregnancy or maybe\nshe just nags all her patients this way. Especially if she's young. \nBut this gallbladder/whatever problem that might be coming up is something\nto be avoided if possible. \n\nNausea, etc. can vary from person to person and with each pregnancy. My\nfirst pregnancy was miserable. During the second I had very little trouble.\nSome articles have said that women with nausea had a statistically better\nchance of carrying their baby. (grain of salt here) \n\nGood luck
Not sure of this but I think some millipedes cause a toxic reaction (sting?\nSo I would not assume that they are not dangerous merely on the basis of \nvegetarianism, after all wasps are vegetarian too.\ndnc.

No, they do not work well.  My doctor started using one recently, and I\nthought the concept was so amazing that I bought one too.  \n\nThe thing works by reading the infrared emissions from the ear drum.\nThe ear drum is hotter than the ear canal walls, so you have to point\nthe thing very carefully.  This means tugging on the top of the ear\nto straighten out the ear canal, then inserting the thing snugly, then\npushing a button.  Unfortunately, there are many things that can go wrong.\nIt is almost impossible to aim the thing correctly when you do it on \nyourself.  I get readings which differ from each other by up to 2 degrees,\nand may differ from an oral thermometer by up to 2 degrees.  \n\nI talked to one of the nurses in my doctor's office recently about this,\nand she said she didn't like them either, for same reasons.  She did give\nme some instruction on how to tug on my ear, and what correct insertion\nfeels like, but she said she thought it was impossible to do correctly\non one's self.  She also said that she and other nurses had complained to\nthe company about inaccurate readings, and that someone from the company\nhad told them to take great care to clean the infrared window at the end\nof the probe with alcohol from time to time.  She demonstrated this prior\nto reading my temperature, and managed to get a reading within 0.5 degree\nof the oral temperature I took at home before driving to the Dr's office.\n\nI have also noticed tha some nurses click the button, then remove the\nprobe immediately.  This causes wrong readings.  In my experience, you\nhave to leave the probe in a good 1 to 2 seconds after clicking the button\nto get a good measurement.  The nurse I talked with agreed.  I suspect\nthat many people don't realize this, and therefore get bad readings for\nyet another reason.
Here is a press release from the American Federation of State, \nCounty and Municipal Employees.\n\n Unions Point To Deadly Workplaces; AFSCME, Other Unions\nCommemorate Workers Memorial Day\n To: National Desk, Labor Writer\n Contact: Janet Rivera of the American Federation of State, County\nand Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO, 202-429-1130\n\n   WASHINGTON, April 23 -- The American Federation of State, \nCounty and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and other unions\nof the AFL-CIO on Wednesday, April 28, will commemorate the fifth\nannual Workers Memorial Day -- a day to pay homage to the 6\nmillion workers who are killed, injured, or diseased on the job.\n   This year, AFSCME will focus its Workers Memorial Day efforts an\nthe dangerous environment in which corrections officers must work.\nEarlier this month, an AFSCME corrections officer, Robert\nVallandingham, was killed by inmates who overtook the corrections\nfacility in Lucasville, Ohio.\n   The law and order agenda of the 1980s has resulted in a steady\nincrease in the prison population for the past five years.  On\nJn. 1, 1992, the prison population was 709,587. Projections\nshow a continued increase in the number of inmates, with an\nexpected prison population of 811,253 in 1994.\n   The conditions which this burgeoning prison population has\ncreated for corrections officers is partially reflected in the\nnumber of assaults by inmates against staff.  Assaults against\nstaff increased dramatically between 1987 and 1989, and remain\nhigh.  In 1987, there were 808 assaults by inmates against staff,\ncompared to 9,961 such assaults in 1991.\n   The increased number of inmates has brought on the dangerous\ncombination of overcrowding and understaffing.  For example in Ohio\nofficer-to-inmate ratio is 1 to 8.4 -- the second worst ratio in\nthe nation. The national average is 1 to 5.3.  Other health and\nsafety issues facing corrections officers include AIDS, Hepatitis\nB, tuberculosis, stress, and chemical hazards.\n   AFSCME has more than 50,000 members who work in the nation's\nfederal, state and local correctional facilities.\n   Correction officers are not alone in performing their jobs under\nlife-threatening conditions.  Every year, 10,000 American workers\ndie from job-related injuries, and tens of thousands more die from\noccupational disease.  Public employees do some of the nation's\nmost dangerous jobs. Perilous occupations include:\n\n   -- Highway Workers - Highway workers are often injured and\n      frequently killed by moving traffic because work zones are\n      not barricaded or don't have proper lighting.\n   -- Health Care Workers - Hospitals have the highest number of\n      job-related injuries and illnesses of any private sector\n      employer and nursing homes ranked fifth.  There were more\n      than 325,000 job-related illnesses and injuries in private\n      sector hospitals in 1991, up almost 10 percent over the\n      previous year.  It is generally believed that health care\n      workers employed at public sector hospitals and nursing homes\n      have a significantly higher rate of injuries and illnesses\n      than do their private sector counterparts.  Health and safety\n      issues facing health care workers include exposure to\n      tuberculosis and the HIV virus, back injuries, and high\n      levels of stress.\n   -- Social Workers - Social workers who work in mental health\n      institutions are often the victims of assaults and,\n      sometimes, fatal attacks.  For instance, last October, a man\n      carrying a semiautomatic handgun walked into the Schuyler\n      County Social Services Building in Watkins Glenn, N.Y.\n      and fatally shot social services workers, before turning the\n      gun on himself.  There are two basic problems.  First is a\n      growing lack of support services for people who don't have\n      the help they need.  Because workers are overworked, some\n      clients are not given the adequate amount of counselling.\n      Such conditions may cause clients to become more frustrated.\n      The "quality" of the clients is also becoming more violent,\n      as more are moved out of the institutions.\n\n   Nearly 2 million workers have been killed by workplace hazards\nsince OSHA was passed.  Moreover, as AFSCME President Gerald W.\nMcEntee explains, OSHA does not provide workplace safety\nprotections for public employees.\n   "More than 1,600 public employees are killed each year on the\njob, yet 27 states still provide no federally-approved OSHA\ncoverage for public employees," said McEntee.  "This, despite the\nfact that public employees -- highway workers, health care workers,\ncorrections officers, to name but a few -- do some of the most\ndangerous work in our society.  This year we are fighting for\npassage of OSHA reform legislation to give all workers greater\nrights and protections, and finally guarantee all public employees\nsafe workplaces.  We need the public support to be successful."\n   Government workers suffer 25 percent more injuries than private\nsector workers, and these injuries are almost 75 percent more\nsevere.\n   Public employees were exempted from OSHA when the law was passed\nin 1970 and today, public employees in more than half the states\nhave no OSHA coverage.\n -30-

Hi.\n\nMy wife has aquired some thyroidal (sp?) deficiency over the past year\nthat gives symptoms such as needing much sleep, coldness and proneness\nto gaining weight. She has been to a doctor and taken the ordinary (?)\ntests and her values were regarded as low. The doctor (and my wife) are\nnot very interested in starting medication as this "deactivates" the \ngland, giving life-long dependency to the drug (hormone?). The last couple of \nmonthes she has been seeing a hoemoepath (sp?) and been given\nsome drops to re-activate either her thyroidal gland and/or the \n'message-center' in the brain (sorry about the approximate language,\nbut I haven't got many clues to what the english terms are, but the \nbrain-area is called the 'hypofyse' in norwegian.) \n\nMy questions are: has anyone had/heard of success in using this approach?\nHer values have been (slowly but) steadily sinking, any comment on the\nprobability of improvement? Although the doctor has told her to 'eat\nnormally', my wife has dieted vigorously to keep her weight as she feels\nthat is part of keeping an edge over the illness/condition, may this\naffect the treatment, development?\n\nI can get the exact figures for her tests for anyone interested, and I\nwill greatly value any information/opinion/experience on this topic.\n\nI don't intend this post to be either a flaming of the established\nmedical profession or a praise for alternatives, I am just relaying\nevents as they have happened.\n\nSincerely,

A friend was recently admitted to North Carolina Memorial Hospital\nbecause of suspected meningitis.  Serious business.  They wanted to do\na lumbar puncture, for which a CT scan is a prerequisite.\n\nI arrived in her hospital room about an hour after she had returned\nfrom the CT.   She was in tears.  Evidently the technicians in the CT\nlab had been very unpleasant to her.\n\nTo begin with, they put her on the apparatus that moves you into the\nmachine itself, and just pushed a button to slide her straight into the\nmachine, without any explanation.  Imagine this.  You worried you may\nhave a deadly disease, and next thing you know you're being put into\nthis big scary machine, without a word of explanation about what is\ngoing to happen to you.  I believe this is inexcusable.   She waved her\nhand as if to say what are you doing to me, and they responded with\nannoyance and anger.  Next they inserted, or tried to insert, an IV\ncatheter.  Apparently she has a lot of trouble with these and complained\nof the pain.  The technician just stopped and fixed her with a glare\nwithout any words of explanation.\n\nIs there anything I can do about these pigs ?\n\nI realize that these technicians do this sort of job day in and day\nout.  And that some patients can be very irritating and uncooperative.\nBut this is simply no excuse.  Their purpose for existing is to help\nsick people, and there is no excuse for this sort of behavior.\nFortunately my friend is fine.  But I imagine a large proportion of the\npeople who get CT scans are not fine at all.  They have cancer and that\nsort of thing.  They don't need this kind of shit.\n\nAlso, since I named the hospital involved, I should also point out that\nneither she nor I have any complaints about the competence or compassion\nof any of the other personnel at NCMH.

If I am in error in any of \nthis, please let me know.\n\nWhich level of sleep is thought to be deficient in people with \nFibromyalgia?  Are there any known sleep disturbances associated \nwith CFS?  What sleep disturbances (if any) are associated with \nclinical depression?

: Actually I am entering vet school next year, but the question is \n: relevant for med students too.\n\n: Memorizing large amounts has never been my strong point academically.\n: Since this is a major portion of medical education -- anatomy, \n: histology, pathology, pharmacology, are for the most part mass \n: memorization -- I am a little concerned.

No doubt the sci.med* folks are getting out their flamethrowers.  I'm\nrather certain that the information you got was not medical literature\nin the accepted academic/scientific journals.  So, the righteous among\nthem will no doubt jump on that.\n\nAlso, insofar as it doesn't conform to the accepted medical presumption\nthat it just doesn't matter what you eat, and that we can think of the\nGI tract as a black box in which nothing ever goes wrong (except for\nmaybe cancer and ulcers), the righteous will no doubt jump on that too.\n\nThen there'll be the ones who call your doctor a raving quack, even\nthough he, like Linus Pauling, is lucid and robust well into his\nnineties--but nevermind about that.  He shouldn't charge for his\nequipment and supplies, since they're no doubt not approved by the\nFDA.  Of course, with FDA approval an MD or pharmaceutical company can\ncharge whatever they can get for such safe and effective treatments as\nthalidomide.  But nevermind about that either.\n\nUnfortunately, you dared to step into the sacred turf of Net.Medical.\nDiscussion without a credential and without understanding that the\nrighteous among them will make certain that you are suitably denounced\nbefore dismissing you as a fool.\n\nBut maybe somebody without such a huge chip on their shoulder will\nsend you some reasonable responses by e-mail.\n\n1/2 ;^)  \n\n1/2 ;^(\n\nOh yes, I did have a point.  A few years ago an MD with a thriving\npractice in a very wealthy part of Silicon Valley once recommended that\nI take such treatments to clear up a skin condition.  (Not through his\noffice, I might add.)  Although I'm sure that's not conclusive, it was\nsure an unusual prescription!
Robert,\n\nI'm *so* glad that you posted your Biological Alchemy discussion.  I've \nbeen compared to the famous Robert McElwaine by some readers of Sci. Med.\nI didn't know how to respond since I had not seen one of your posts(just \nlike I haven't read "The Yeast Connection").\n\nLet me just start by stating that the authors of the "Cold Fusion" papers of \nrecent years are now in scientific exile(I believe that one has actually \nleft the country).  Scientific fraud is rare.  I'm still not sure that if a \nreview of the research notes of the "cold fusion scientists" actually \nproved fraud or just very shoddy experimentation.\n\nYour sources do not seem to be research articles.  They are more like lay \ntexts designed to pique human interest in a subject area(just like the food \ncombining and life extension texts).  Robert, I try to keep an open mind.\nBut some things I just can't buy(one is taking SOD orally to prevent \noxidative damage in the body).\n\nYour experiment, if conducted by readers of this news group, would prove \nthat you are right(more ash after seed sprouting than before).  Unless you \nuse a muffle furnance and obtain a very high temperature(above 600 degrees \nI believe), you will get organic residue in the ash.  Even the residue in \ncommercial incinerators contains organic residue.  I remember doing this \nkind of experiment in my organic chemistry couurse in College but I \ncouldn't find a temperature for mineral ash formation so I'm really \nguessing at 600 degrees F, it may actually be much higher.  The point is \nthat no one in their home could ever get a high enough temperature to \nproduce *only* a mineral ash.  They also could not measure the minerals so \nthey could only weigh the ash and find out that you appear to be correct. \n\nChemical reactions abound in our body, in our atmosphere, in our water and \nin our soil.  Are these fusion reactions?  Yes many of them do involve \nfusing oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur to both organics and inorganics.  Do we \nreally have the transformation of silicone to calcium if carbon is fused with \nsilicon?  Not in my book Robert.\n\nSilicon is the most abundant mineral on our planet.  I've seen speculation \nthat man could have evolved to be a silicon based rather than a carbon \nbased life-form.  I like reading science fiction, as many people do.  But I \nknow enough about biochemistry(and nutrition) to be able(in most cases) to \nseparate the fiction from the fact.\n\nSilicon may be one of the trace elements that turns out to be essential in \nhumans.  We have several grams of the stuff in our body.  What's it doing \nthere?  Only the Lord knows right now.  But I will tell you what I do know \nabout silicon and why, as you state, it helps bone healing(and it is not \nbecause silicon is transformed into calcium).\n\nAlmost all of the silicon in the human body is found in the connective \ntissue(collagen and elastin).  There have been studies published which show \nthat the very high silicon content in elastin may be an important protective \nfactor against atherosclerosis(the higher the silicon content in elastin, \nthe more resistant the elastin is to a an age-related loss of elasticity \nwhich may play a role in the increase in blood pressure that is often seen as \npart of the ageing process in humans).\n\nFor bone fracture healing, the first step is a collagen matrix into which \ncalcium and phosphate are pumped by osteoblasts.  A high level of silicon \nin the diet seems to speed up this matrix formation.  This first step in the \nbone healing process seems to be the hardest for some people to get going.\nElectriacl currents have been used in an attempt to get the matrix forming \ncells oriented in the right direction so that the matrix can be formed in \nthe gap(or gaps) between the ends of the broken bone.  A vitamin C deficiency\n(by slowing collagen formation as well as causing the prodcution of \ndefective collagen) does slow down both bone and wound healing.  Zinc is also \nanother big player in bone and wound healing.  And so is silicon(in an  \nundetermined role that most likely involes matrix formation and not \ntransformation of silicon to calcium).  For you to take this bone healing \nobservation and use it as proof that silicon is transformed into \ncalcium is an interesting little trick.\n\nBut Robert, I have the same problem myself when I read the lay press(and \nyes even some scientific papers).  Is the explanation reasonable?  Without \na very good science knowledge base, you and most readers of this news group \nare flying blind(you have to take it on faith because you don't know any \nbetter).\n\nIf the explanation seems to make sense to me based on my knowledge base, \nI'm inclined to consider it(this usually means trying to find other sources \nthat come to the same conclusion).  If the idea(like a candida bloom) seems \nto make sense to me, I tend to pursue it as long as any advice that I'm \ngoing to give isn't going to really mess somebody up.  If this makes us \nkindred souls Robert, then I guess I'll have to live with that label.\n\nFor the physicians who have decided to read my response to Robert's \ninteresting post, I hope that you saw the segment on the pediatric \nneurosurgeon last night on U.S. TV.  I can't remember the network or his \nname(like many nights, I was on my computer and my wife was watching TV in \nour Den where I have my computer setup).  This neurosurgeon takes kids with \nbrain tumors that everyone else has given up on and he uses"unconventional"\ntreatments(his own words).  He says that he has a 70% success rate.  The one \ncase that I heard him discussing would normally use radiation(conventional \ntreatment).  He was going to go in and cut.  You guys complain about the \ncost of the anti-fungals.  What do you think the cost difference between \nradiation treatment and surgery is guys? \n\nI'm going to ask you guys one more time, why blast a physician who takes the \nchronic sinus sufferer(like Jon) and the chronic GI sufferer(like Elaine)\nand tries to help them using unconventional treatments?  Treatments which \ndo not result in death(like those that the neurosurgeon uses?).  Is it \nbecause candida blooms are not life-threatening while brain tumors are?\nHow about quality of life guys?  May the candida demon never cross your \nsinus cavity or gut(if it does, you may feel differently about the issue).

The disease you are talking about is toxoplasmosis.  It is a protozoan that \nlives and multiplies within cells.  In cats, the protozoan multiplies in the\nintestinal cells and eggs are shed in the cat's feces.  The protozoa can\ncross the placenta to infect the fetus.  The disease may be asymptomatic\nafter the baby is born, or it may be very severe.  Toxo may cause blindness\nand mental retardation.\n\nHaving a cat in the same apartment should not be a problem; however, pregnant\nwomen should not scoop or change the cat's litterbox.

Unless the patient has a very short life expectancy, the possible complications\nfrom a hernia that hasn't been repaired far outweigh the risks of surgery.\nThe risks of surgery, anyway, are minimal.

Here is a press release from Huntington Medical Research Institutes.\n\n New Method For Diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease Discovered at\nHuntington Medical Research Institutes: Results to Be Reported\n To: National Desk, Health Writer\n Contact: John Lockhart or Belinda Gerber, 310-444-7000, or\n          800-522-8877, for the Huntington Medical Research\n          Institutes.\n\n   LOS ANGELES, April 28  -- A new method for diagnosing \nand measuring chemical imbalances in the brain\nwhich lead to Alzheimer's disease and other dementias has been\ndiscovered by researchers at the Huntington Medical Research\nInstitutes (HMRI) in Pasadena, Calif.  Results of their research\nwill be reported in the May issue of the scientific journal,\nRadiology.\n   Using an advanced form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\ncalled magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), a research team led\nby Brian D. Ross, M.D., D. Phil., conducted a study on 21 elderly\npatients who were believed to be suffering from some form of\ndementia. The exams used standard MRI equipment fitted with special\nsoftware developed at HMRI called Clinical Proton MRS.  Clinical\nProton MRS is easily applied, giving doctors confirmatory diagnoses\nin less than 30 minutes.  An automated version of Clinical Proton\nMRS called Proton Brain Examination (PROBE) reduces the examination\ntime yet further, providing confirmatory diagnoses in less than 10\nminutes.  By comparison, the current "standard of care" in testing\nfor Alzheimer's disease calls for lengthy memory function and\nneuropsychological tests, which can be very upsetting to the\npatient, are not definitive and can only be confirmed by autopsy.\n   In addition to Alzheimer's disease, the new Clinical Proton MRS\nexam may have applications in diagnosing other dementias, including\nAIDS-related dementia, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's\ndisease.\n   "We've developed a simple test which can be administered quickly\nand relatively inexpensively using existing MRI equipment fitted\nwith either the MRS or PROBE software," said Dr. Ross, adding,\n"this will help physicians to diagnose Alzheimer's earlier and\nintervene with therapeutics before the progression of the disease\ncauses further damage to the delicate inner workings of the brain."\n   Dr. Ross and his HMRI team measured a family of chemicals in the\nbrain known as inositols, and myo-inositol (MI) acted as a marker\nin the study.  In comparison to healthy patients, those diagnosed\nwith Alzheimer's showed a 22 percent increase in MI, while their\nlevel of another chemical called N-acetylaspartate (NAA) was\nsignificantly lower, indicating a loss of brain-stimulating neurons\nbelieved to be associated with the progression of the disease.\n   Current drug therapy for Alzheimer's disease is widely\nconsidered to be inadequate.  This is attributable, Dr. Ross\nbelieves, to the theory that Alzheimer's is caused by an\ninterruption in the transmission of the chemical acetylcholine to\nthe nerve cells. This belief has been adhered to over the last 15\nyears, and consequently, most drugs to treat Alzheimer's were based\non the changing receptors for acetylcholine.\n   "Physicians have a real need for a test to differentiate\nAlzheimer's from other dementias, to provide the patient and his or\nher family with a firm diagnosis and to monitor future treatment\nprotocols for the treatment of this disease.  For this reason, we\nconsider this test a major advancement in medicine," said Bruce\nMiller, M.D., a noted neurologist at Harbor-UCLA, MRS researcher\nand a co-author of the study.\n   Other members of the HMRI research team included Rex A. Moats,\nPh.D., Truda Shonk, B.S., Thomas Ernst, Ph.D., and Suzanne Woolley,\nR.N.  The PROBE software can be fitted on the approximately 1,200\nGeneral Electric MRI units currently in use in the United States,\nand will be configured for other manufacturers' MRI units soon.\n   For interviews with Dr. Ross, advance copies of the Radiology\nMay issue, and other information, please contact John Lockhart or\nBelinda Gerber for HMRI at 310-444-7000 or 800-522-8877.\n\n   Q & A on Alzheimer's Disease:\n\n   What is Alzheimer's disease and how is it caused?\n   Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable degenerative disease of\nthe brain first described in 1906 by the German neuropathologist\nAlois Alzheimer.  As the disease progresses, it leads to loss of\nmemory and mental functioning, followed by changes in personality,\nloss of control of bodily functions, and, eventually, death.\n   How many people does it affect?\n   Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 4 million adults in\nthe United States and is the fourth leading cause of death, taking\napproximately 100,000 lives each year.  While Alzheimer's\ndebilitates its victims, it is equally devastating, both\nemotionally and financially, for patients' families.  AD is the\nmost common cause of dementia in adults.  Symptoms worsen every\nyear, and death usually occurs within 10 years of initial onset.\n   What are its signs and symptoms?\n   Although the cause of AD is not known, two risk factors have\nbeen identified: advanced age and genetic predisposition.  The risk\nof developing AD is less than one percent before the age of 50\nyars old, but increases steeply in each successive decade of life\nto reach 30 percent by the age of 90.  In patients with familial\nAD, immediate family relatives have a 50 percent chance of\ndeveloping AD.  One of its first symptoms is severe "forgetfulness"\ncaused by short-term memory loss.  Dr. Herman Weinreb of the School\nof Medicine at New York University says "whether forgetfulness is\na serious symptom or not is largely a matter of degree" and\nsuggests the following criteria:\n\n   -- Forgetting the name of someone you see infrequently is\n      normal.\n   -- Forgetting the name of a loved one is serious.\n   -- Forgetting where you left your keys is normal.\n   -- Forgetting how to get home is serious.\n\n   Doctors suggest that people with severe symptoms should be\nevaluated in order to rule out Alzheimer's disease and other forms\nof dementia.\n -30-
Does anyone here know anything about chelation therapy using EDTA?  My\nuncle has emphesema, and a doctor wants to try it on him.  We are\nwondering if:\n\n1.  Is there any evidence EDTA chelation therapy is beneficial for his\ncondition, or any condition?\n\n2.  What possible side effects are there.  How can they be mimimized?\n\nPlease respond via e-mail to    rme1@cornell.edu
Being a chronic HBsAg carrier does not necessarily mean the patient has chronic\npersistent anything. Persons who are chronic carriers may have no clinical,\nbiochemical, or histologic evidence of liver disease, or they may have chronic\npersistent hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular\ncarcinoma.\n\nMost cases of chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH) are probably the result of\na viral infection, although in a good number of cases the cause cannot be\ndetermined. The diagnosis of CPH is made on the basis of liver biopsy. It\nconsists of findings of portal inflammation, an intact periportal limiting\nplate, and on occasion isolated foci of intralobular necrosis. But in contrast\nto chronic active hepatitis (CAH) there is no periportal inflammation, \nbridging necrosis, or fibrosis. \n\nCPH has, indeed, an excellent prognosis. If I had to choose between CAH and\nCPH there is no question I would also choose CPH. However, as David pointed\nout, the distinction between the two is not as neat as some of us would have\nit. The histology can sometimes be pretty equivocal, with biopsies showing\nareas compatible with both CPH and CAH. Maybe it is a sampling problem. Maybe\nit is a continuum. I don't know.\n\n=================================
-*----\n\nThe millipede's around here (Austin) have no sting.  Some of the\ncentipedes do.  The question Rebecca Snyder asks is much like\nasking "How venomous are snakes?"  One either wants to ask "which\nsnake?" or point to some reference on the many different species\nof snake.  Similarly, there are many different species of\nmillipede and centipede.  (These are different families;\nmillipedes have two pairs of legs per body segment, while\ncentipedes have but one pair.)\n\nSorry if this information is not useful.
I don't believe any state licenses herbologists or iridologists.
This is true, but it's not quite the whole story.  There were \n	actually some people who were more careful in their methodology\n	who also replicated the 'phantom leaf effect.'\n\n    One of the most influential critics of Kirlian Electrophotography\n    is a Theosophist (and threfore presumably willing to entertain the\n    hypothesis of scientific evidence for a human aura, electromagnetic\n    or otherwise), professor of electrical engineering at London's\n    City University, and a past president of the Society for Psychic Research \n    named A. J. Ellison.\n\n    After years of studying the method and the claims, Ellison\n    came to the conclusion that the photographic images are what we\n    calls 'Lichtenberg Figures,' an effect of intermittent ionization of\n    the air around the object.  It's a bit more complicated than\n    'not wiping off the plates,' but it comes down to the same thing\n    in the end, Kirlian electrophotography has much more limited\n    value (if any) than was previously widely thought.  Electrical and\n    magnetic fields generated by the body are much too small to be\n    of much use diagnostically without very elaborate equipment and\n    usually also tracer chemicals.\n\n					kind regards,
I don't know the first thing about yeast infections but I am a scientist.\nNo scientist would take your statement --- "no convincing empirical evidence\nto support the existence of systemic yeast syndrome" --- to tell you\nanything except an absence of data on the question.  Noring has pointed out\nthe catch-22 that if the "crazy" theory were true, you probably couldn't\nfind any direct evidence of it --- that you couldn't observe those yeastie\nbeasties with present methods even if they were there.  Noring and the\nfellow from Oklahoma (sorry, forgot your name) have also suggested one set\nof anecdotal evidence in favor based on their personal experiences ---\nnamely, that when people with certain conditions are given anti-fungals,\nmany of them appear to get better.  \n\nSo, if you have any evidence *against* the hypothesis --- for example,\ncontrolled double-blind studies showing that the anti-fungals don't do any\nbetter than sugar water --- then let's hear it.  If you don't, then what we\nhave is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side, and abject\ndisbelief on the other.  In which case, please, there is no point in yelling\nback and forth at each other any longer since neither side has any\nconvincing evidence either positive or negative.  \n\nAnd I understand that your abject disbelief is based on the existence of\npeople who may get famous or make money applying the diagnosis to everything\nin sight, making wild claims with no evidence, and always refusing to do\ncontrolled studies.  But that has absolutely no bearing on the apparently\nsincere experiences of the people on the net observing anti-fungals working\non themselves and other people in certain specific cases.  There are also\nquacks who sell oral superoxide dismutase, in spite of the fact that it's\ncompletely broken down in the guts, but this doesn't change the genuine\nscientific knowledge about the role of superoxide dismutase in fighting\noxidative damage.  Same thing.  Just cause there are candida quacks, that\ndoesn't establish evidence against the candida hypothesis.  If there's some\nother reason (besides the quacks), if only anecdotal, to think it could be\ntrue, then that is what has to be considered, that is what the net people\nhave been talking about.\n\nBut again, there is no point in arguing about it.  There is anecdotal\nevidence, and there is no convincing evidence, and there are also some\ncandida quacks out there, I hope everyone can agree on all of that.  Thus,\nit appears to me the main question now is whether the proponents can\nmarshall enough anecdotal evidence in a convincing and documented enough\nmanner to make a good case for carrying out a good controlled double-blind\nstudy of antifungals (or else, forget convincing anybody else to carry out\nthe test, just carry it out themselves!) --- and also, whether they can\nadequately define the patient population or symptoms on which such a study\nshould be carried out to provide a fair test of the hypothesis.\n\nKen
Jim Haynes wants to know the following is a scam....\n\n       There's a chiropractor who has a stand in the middle of a shopping\n       mall, offering free examinations.  Part of the process involves a\n       multiple-jointed sensor arm and a computer that says in a computer-\n       sounding voice "digitize left PSIS" "digitize right PSIS" "digitize\n       C7" "please stand with spine in neutral position".  I'm wondering\n       whether this doesn't really measure anything and the computer voice\n       is to impress the victims, or whether it is measuring something\n       that chiropractors think is useful to measure.\n\nEarth to sci.med....If it looks like a duck...and quacks like a duck......\n\nThis is a TOTAL scam. Since the beginning of chiropraxis, the chiropractor has \ntried to sell The Subluxation as The Problem and then sell themselves and\ntheir Adjustments as The Solution. The Chiropractic Subluxation is a delusional \ndiagnosis and the Adjustments of Subluxations by extension constitute a \ndelusional medicine.\n\nThe wide spectrum of chiropractic Techniques ALL have their own methods for \ndetecting Spinal Demons and unique methodolgies for Excorcizing Them. The \ncomputer approach is an attempt to 'sell with science' but this device is \nnothing more than a 'high-tech' Subluxation Detector.....and in the end...\nAMAZINGLY...it will show the potential 'patient' to suffer from...VS......\nVertebral Subluxation....The Silent Killer!
I've seen children do this and wondered about something.  If the\nmucus in one's nose collects (filters) particles going into the\nairway, if a child then picks and ingests this material, might\nit have a vaccinatory effect, since if the body ingests airborne\ndiseases or other 'stuff' on the mucus, the body might generate\nantibodies for this small "invasion"?\n\nMaybe this is why some children don't get sick very often? :-)\n                         - tom
The following article by columnist Mike Royko is his humorous commentary\non some of the public's perception of doctors and their salaries.\nI hope some of you will find it as amusing as I did.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n[Reprinted w/o permission]\n\n\n"There's no cure for stupidity of poll on doctors' salaries"\n\nBy Mike Royko\nTribune Media Services\n\n\n     On a stupidity scale, a recent poll about doctors' earnings \nis right up there.  It almost scored a perfect brain-dead 10.\n     It  was  commissioned by some whiny consumers  group  called \nFamilies USA.\n      The  poll tells us that the majority of  Americans  believe \nthat doctors make too much money.\n     The  pollsters  also asked what a fair income would  be  for \nphysicians.  Those polled said, oh, about $80,000 a year would be \nOK.\n     How generous.  How sporting.  How stupid.\n     Why is this poll stupid?   Because it is based on resentment \nand envy, two emotions that ran hot during the political campaign \nand are still simmering.\n     You could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that \nearns $100,000-plus and get the same results.  Since the majority \nof Americans don't make those bucks,  they assume that those  who \ndo are stealing it from them.\n     Maybe  the Berlin Wall came down,  but don't  kid  yourself.  \nKarl Marx lives.\n     It's also stupid because it didn't ask key  questions,  such \nas:  Do  you  know how much education and training  it  takes  to \nbecome a physician?\n     If those polled said no,  they didn't know, then they should \nhave  been disqualified.   If they gave the wrong  answers,  they \nshould have been dropped.   What good are their views on how much \na doctor should earn if they don't know what it takes to become a \ndoctor?\n     Or maybe a question should have been phrased this way:  "How \nmuch  should  a person earn if he or she must (a)  get  excellent \ngrades and a fine educational foundation in high school in  order \nto (b) be accepted by a good college and spend four years  taking \ncourses heavy in math, physics, chemistry, and other lab work and \nmaintain a 3.5 average or better,  and (c) spend four more  years \nof  grinding study in medical school,  with the third and  fourth \nyears in clinical training,  working 80 to 100 hours a week,  and \n(d) spend another year as a low-pay,  hard-work intern,  and  (e) \nput  in  another  three to 10 years  of  post-graduate  training, \ndepending  on  your specialty and (f) maybe wind up  $100,000  in \ndebt  after  medical school and (g) then work an  average  of  60 \nhours  a week,  with many family doctors putting in 70  hours  or \nmore until they retire or fall over?"\n     As  you have probably guessed by now,  I  have  considerably \nmore  respect for doctors than does the law firm of  Clinton  and \nClinton,  and all the lawyers and insurance executives they  have \ncalled together to remake America's health care.\n     Based  on what doctors contribute to society,  they are  far \nmore useful than the power-happy,  ego-tripping, program-spewing, \nsocial tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that is \nto health what Clinton's first budget is to frugality.\n     But propaganda works.   And,  as the stupid poll  indicates, \nmany Americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are  the \nmajor cause of high medical costs.\n     Of  course doctors are well-compensated.   They  should  be.  \nAmericans now live longer than ever.   But who is responsible for \nour longevity--lawyers,  Congress, or the guy flipping burgers in \na McDonald's?\n     And the doctors prolong our lives despite our having  become \na  nation  of  self-indulgent,   lard-butted,   TV-gaping   couch \ncabbages.\n     Ah,  that  is not something you heard President  Clinton  or \nSuper  Spouse  talk  about during the  campaign  or  since.   But \ninstead of trying to turn the medical profession into a  villain, \n     "Let  us  talk  about medical care and one  of  the  biggest \nproblems we have.   That problem is you, my fellow American. Yes, \nyou,  eating  too much and eating the wrong foods;  many  of  you \nguzzling  too  much hooch;  still puffing away at $2.50  a  pack; \ngetting  your daily exercise by lumbering from the fridge to  the \nmicrowave to the couch; doing dope and bringing crack babies into \nthe  world;  filling  the big city emergency rooms  with  gunshot \nvictims;  engaging  in unsafe sex and catching a  deadly  disease \nwhile blaming the world for not finding an instant cure.\n     "You  and  your habits,  not the  doctors,  are  the  single \nbiggest  health  problem in this country.   If  anything,  it  is \namazing that the docs keep you alive as long as they do.\n     "In fact,  I don't understand how they can stand looking  at \nyour blubbery bods all day.\n     "So as your president,  I call upon you to stop whining  and \nstart living cleanly.   Now I must go get myself a triple cheesy-\ngreasy with double fries.  Do as I say, not as I do."\n     But  for those who truly believe that doctors are  overpaid, \nthere is another solution: Don't use them.\n     That's right.   You don't feel well?   Then try one of those \nspine poppers,  needle twirlers, or have Rev. Bubba lay his hands \nupon your head and declare you fit.\n     Or  there is the do-it-yourself approach.   You  have  chest \npains?   Then sit in front of a mirror,  make a slit here, a slit \nthere, and pop in a couple of valves.\n     You're  going to have a kid?   Why throw your money at  that \noverpaid  sawbones so he can buy a better car and a bigger  house \nthan  you  will  ever  have  (while  paying  more  in  taxes  and \nmalpractice insurance than you will ever earn)?\n     Just have the kid the old-fashioned way.   Squat and do  it.  \nAnd if it survives,  you can go to the library and find a book on \nhow to give it its shots.\n     By  the  way,  has  anyone  ever done a  poll  on  how  much \npollsters should earn?\n\n\nRoyko  is  a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for  Tribune  Media \nServices.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________

Does anyone know of research done on the use of haldol in the elderly?  Does \nshort-term use of the drug ever produce long-term side-effects after\nthe use of the drug?  My grandmother recently had to be hospitalized\nand was given large doses of haldol for several weeks.  Although the\ndrug has been terminated, she has changed from a perky, slightly\nsenile woman into a virtual vegetable who does not talk to anyone\nand who cannot even eat or brush her teeth without assistance.  It\nseems incredible to me that such changes could take place in the\ncourse of just one and one-half months.  I have to believe that the\ncombination of the hospital stay and some drug(s) are in part\ncatalysts for this.  Any comments?
