[ Lots of stuff deleted because I felt like it ]\n\nThis MS bashing has definitely lost all its humor value.\n\nI think most of the people posting are forgetting that most users\nof MS products do not even know about internet, and Unix is that\nvery unfriendly place where bizzare abreviations replace the rather\ncomfortable abreviations they know. And the abreviations have subtle\ndifferences between the different vendors. While PC users tend to\ncustomize any windowing setup, they can not do much with their \ncommand line.\n\nSo to most of the computer users in the world MS product symbolize\nquality. MS has made their life easier, and more productive and to them\nthat is quality. They do not care about what innovative things MS has\ndone, other than to make their life with a computer one heck of a lot\neasier. You may know better than most computer users in this world\nbut that will not change their perception.\n\nFace it until Unix come up with a decent GUI that is available to\nall variations of Unix it just will not catch on with the mainstream\nof computer users. We here on the net are not mainstream computer users.\n\n\nBrian\n-- \n\nDisclaimer: The opinions expressed are mine not those of BNR.

That's not the same as MSW3.1 being objectively inferior.\n\nNo.  It is technically inferior to the OS/GUIs that I listed.  I have already\ndescribed why.  To say briefly:\n\nSystem 7 --easier to learn and use.  There have been independent studies to \n           that effect.\nOS/2     --Can run MSW applications and has more stable multitasking.\nNeXTSTep --easier to learn, use, and program. More stable multitasking\nUNIX/X   --As easy to learn and use.  More stable multitasking.\n\nWith the prpoer setup, all of these will exchange data with MSW machines as\nwell as MSW machines will amongst themselves, so interoperability is not\nan issue.\n\nBy this criterion, it is inferior.  If you have another, then perhaps I am\nincorrect.  Do you pick up the glove?
Hi there,\n\nCould someone please suggest one of the better _shareware_\nreplacements for Win3.1's Program Manager and File Manager?\nAnd which ftp site are they located at?\n\nThanks in advance for e-mail response.
Has anyone else observed this behaviour and if so, what have you\ndone to cure it?\n\nOne workstation in a WfW network goes deaf to any form of communication from\nother workstations until it goes out on the network itself. From then on other\nworkstatons can interact with it until some time later when it goes deaf \nagain.

I have a Gateway 4dx2/66v. Does anyone know if I csn (or can't)\nDuse 32 bit access?\nD\nD
The number you gave is the Borland BBS, and darned if I can find any\nstealth drivers there!\n\nDiamond's BBS is 1-408-730-1100 - according to the manual I got with\nmy Stealth-24.  I have had a bunch of trouble using the RIGHT drivers\nthat came with the card (locking up, de-syncing, etc.) so I hope you \ndo better than I do!
Well, renaming screensavers (.scr) to .exe, and running them, as has\nbeen pposted, (I haven't tried changing win.ini , but should have same\neffect) shows me the "setup" dialog. box, butdoesn't enable the saver.
You can't customize a command line interface?  Where have you been?  I\ncan change the prompt, I can make aliases (so someone like me who is\nused to say, ls, can type it on my dos machine and still get a\ndirectory listing), and under Unix, if I don't like the command line\ninterface, I throw it out and get a different one. (csh, bash, ksh,\nsh, etc...)\n\n\nThis is true.\n\n\nA decent GUI for all variations of Unix? Lessee... what about Motif?\nOr the stuff from MIT? (twm comes to mind...) those are pretty\nstandard. Heck, an xwindows program runs like it likes to -- all the\nend user has to really know is how to manipulate the actual windows\nwith the mouse, and since it is a GUI, it's *graphical* and a bit\neasier to figure out. (Something the windows people have been pressing\ndown our throats for some time now...)\n\nThe thing I fear is that there will be a gap between the normal users\nrunning windows (all flavors) and the other "power" users running Unix\nand other more advanced OSes. At least right now, DOS is still pretty\nmuch king. I can bring a copy of my latest whiz-bang programming demo\nover to my friends house, and since we both run DOS, he can enjoy it\ntoo.
No, I'd rather not.  First of all, I don't have exact figures, and I don't\nwant to disclose how I know this.  However, I will say that Jim Francis\nfrom Microsoft just posted a figure of $26 million (payment from IBM to\nBorland) and that's somewhere in the range that I've heard.
You're right, it doesn't appear to working correctly.  It really\n	should say:\n		"space: the last frontier"\n	across the top. :) :) :)

Well, you can't say that it don't work.  The inability to read 800k mac\ndisks is not a SW problem.  Rather, it's a HARDWARE limmitation on PCs.
Yep, you can use any type of UNIX, or maybe VMS, or buy a MAC or something...\n  If you want longer filenames for your documents, I heard of a wordprocessor for\nwindows which let you assign long names to files. Those long filenames could only be\nseen from that programs open/save dialogs though... Maybe someone knows more about\nthis wordprocessor than I do?
I've started getting a message from Windows 3.1 whenever I try to execute\na DOS program from Windows, either thru the Program Manager or the File\nManager. A message box comes up and says "This program or one of its\ncomponents is compressed. Use the MS-DOS expand command to expand the\nfile."\n\nNow, I know this is bogus, because I can always execute the program\nfrom DOS when not running windows. The program in question is COMMAND.COM\n(yup, the basic DOS command line shell...) And, the expand command tells\nme that the file is already expanded.\n\nAll my windows apps work just fine - I only get this message when trying\nto execute a DOS program from Windows.
This may work, but won't it involve invoking the applications, e.g. if you\ndrag a .bmp or .txt file to the min. Print Manager icon, won't it RUN\nNotepad and Paintbrush before printing?  If you just want to drag a file\n(.txt or .bmp) to a print server icon, with stay at front attributes, you\nneed an intelligent Print Manager drag and drop client like Amish Print 2.0.
[much BS deleted for brevity]\n\n\nIt certainly smacks of that! Remember the "POLL" that you quoted saying that\nyou had seen a 95% of users being satisfied with DOS 6.0? Care to recall how\nunbiased the sample set was? That post sure looked like FUD....and coming\nfrom a microsoftie .... well, it sure seemed like something was not on level.\n\nAdvocacy is GOOD - but spreading FUD to advocate your favorite OS is very \nunethical - especially when you have a vested interest in the success of that\nOS.\n\n\nThat is because their actions seem to invite this opinion - never seen more \ndefensive people in my life. Moreover, many of their posts seem to encourage\nthis too, IMHO.\n\nSeriously speaking, it is a shame that MS techie employees get the heat for\nMS's actions - most of which are perpetrated by the Management and marketing.\nI am sure that they ARE very talented etc ... I have not doubts about their \nabilities, just about the ethics of their marketing practices.\n\nDivya\n-- \nDivya
Since I started this twist of this thread...\n\n\nActually you fell into the above because you said "I believe"\nIf you had used the rest of this post in your previous post\nI do not think anyone would have agrued with you.\n\n\n\nThe following three are not the competition for Windows 3.0 (IMHO of course)\nSystem 7  -- Does not currently run on Intel boxes\nNeXTSTep  -- Rather expensive should be a competitor to Windows NT not 3.x\nUnix/X    --   "        "        "    " "      "     "    "     "   "   "\n\n\nWith the exception of OS/2 all of the above will require most users\nto spend a very large sum of money to upgrade applications to ones that\nrun under these OS's. And basically money speaks louder than anything\nelse. You keep saying "More stable multitasking" is what you mean\n"Not Multi-finder / GEM / GeoWorks co-operative multi-tasking but\nreal honest to goodness prioritized pre-emptive multi-tasking"?\n\n\nBasically this is moot since most users have been able to share data for\nquite a long time, but are still to blind to know it.\n\n\nWhy pick it up? You stated the reasons behind your opinions. Stated them in \na very straight-forward, though over protective, manner. And aside from\nmy earlier comments about who actually is a competitor, I think we are in\nagreement.\n\nDoes Tim Glauert agree? Let's wait and see.\n-- \n\nDisclaimer: The opinions expressed are mine not those of BNR.
I agree that this should be added to some sort of FAQ list.  But we have\nstrayed from the original topic.  Our computer environment is pretty split\nbetween Mac's and PC's... I am lucky and get to have both on my desk.  But\nthere are people who have PC's and need to share data with the Mac users\nhere.  The MAC users have no problems because of package called DOS Mounter\nwhich AUTOMATICALLy lets the MAC read DOS disks natively.  For the PC there\nis no equivilant... that I know of!  Both mac-ette and macsee have been \ninconsistant under the dos platform, and requires you to perform the activity\nin a DOS program to selectively transport the files.\n\nThe question originally posed was if there is such a program that hooks into\nwindows like a .DLL that will interpret the reading of a MAC disk when it is \nin a PC, and allow access to it through the standard file dialogs.  It is quite\nclear that this would only be available for the 1.44MB flopies.\n\n\n-- T.J. Fiske

I'd like to appeal to the net's NT wizards for a bit of advice.\n\nFirst a general description of the machine as follows:\n Motherboard: Utron 33 mhz Opti chipset, 20 meg memory, 256kb cache\n      (soon I hope to drop a DX2 chip into it)\n Fahrenheit 1280 video (1 meg, 1024x768x256)\n ProAudio Spectrum 16 sound board\n primary disk = Connor CP30174 on a caching IDE controller\n secondary disk = Conner CP30174 as slave on same controller\n tertiary disk = Fujitsu ??? 650 meg on Superstore ESDI controller\n planned future disks include SCSI HD and CD ROM on PAS16 SCSI port\n Tape drive is a Colorado Jumbo 250 on the Floppy controller\n  future tape drive may be a DAT on the SCSI interface.\n Other hardware includes modem/fax, serial ports, and a teletext board\n (ugly dos software drives the latter)\n\nApplications used include normal windows stuff (excel, word, Quicken\nand Turbo Pascal/Windows) but the important stuff is my Audio\nwork environment which includes Turtle beach Wave for Windows, MCS Stereo,\nand other misc stuff for dinking around with audio files.  Also I use\nStacker on the primary drive, HP Newwave (for my wife's use, and she \nwon't let me get rid of it!), and a product called Infinite Disk from \nChili Pepper Software for hierarchical storage management of my seldom \nused offline files.  \n\nI plan to upgrade to NT, when it becomes a released product.  I was stongly\ntempted to become a beta user early on, but I don't have time to mess around\nwith the hassles of beta software.  I expect to buy it, tear off the \nshrink wrap, and use it without hassle (I know, unrealistic, but I can\nhope can't I, after all, I have work to do).\n\nThe advice I want concerns the state of NT regarding device drivers, and \nhardware specific stuff in general.  How smoothly can I expect the \nupgrade to go?  Can I expect support for all my stuff, or do I\nstill need to scramble around downloading drivers (PAS?, Orchid?, Colorado?) \nfrom some bbs, etc.  What steps should I take to ensure the installation\ngoes smoothly.  Note that I want to nuke dos totally from the system.  I'm\nallergic to command lines!  I plan to run a "pure" NT system.  Also, will \nNT communicate with the workgroups lan?  What about stacker?  I currently \nhave stacker on the first disk drive.  Without Stacker, and the Infinite \nDisk product, I will have great difficulty fitting everything I have on the \nsystem (It's cramped now).\n\nI realize Stacker will be incompatible with NT, but will there be an NT \nversion?  Or will NT support compression a la Dos 6?  I know Infinite Disk\nwill be incompatible with NT, but will they offer (or does anybody else)\na comparable product for NT and at what cost?  (perhaps I need to ask \nChili Pepper that question)  I can live without ID if I have to, but I'd\nrather not.  Will NT run my DOS apps (the teletext board mainly) without\nDOS on the system?  What do I need to keep around?\n\nAny feedback or advice (including "forget NT" with good reasons) is much\nappreciated.  My only significant reason for moving to NT is I need a better\nmultitasking environment than Windows (among other reasons, WAVE locks up\nthe machine for hours and hours doing DSP processing on large audio files),\nand I want better lan support than I now have (Internet access, etc).  Maybe\nthere are better solutions than NT and if so, I would appreciate hearing \nabout them (OS/2?  What's it's status these days?)\n\nPls respond by email and if there is interest I'll summarize for the net.
I don't know much about computers, so please bear with me. Here's my question:\n\nCONTEXT: I use a package called SLIP on my home computer to connect to the\n         university mainframe (an IBM 3090 running VMS/MVS), and log on to my\n         account. When I installed SLIP on my computer, I had to configure it\n         for my modem (14.4 kbs Etronics internal) and had to supply the phone\n         number to dial to reach the mainframe. The way it works now is that\n         I type "telnet uicvm" or "tn3270 uicvm" (either will work) at the DOS\n         prompt. UICVM is the node name of the mainframe. The program then\n         dials the mainframe, establishes a protocol, and gives me the logon\n         screen. "TELNET" and "TN3270" are the names of batch files in my SLIP\n         directory. I have been told that a kermit protocol is used for the\n         session.\n\nPROBLEM: I would like to be able to do all this under Windows 3.1 because I\n         hardly ever use DOS directly. SLIP will not run under Windows. I\n         talked to the people at our computer center, and they suggested that\n         I use a packet driver called WINPKT.COM with SLIP. They gave me\n         instructions on how to load it before I start Windows, and how to\n         modify the TCPSTART and TCPSTOP batch files (in the SLIP directory)\n         to ensure that it would work. I did all that and I could run SLIP\n         from Windows, but there were other problems. For one thing, SLIP\n         would not hang up the phone when I exited. I had to run my communi-\n         cations program to hang up the phone or reboot the computer when\n         that didn't work. For another, there were too many errors. It often\n         took me 3-4 tries to connect to the mainframe. Our computer center\n         does not support SLIP under Windows, so I can't keep going back to\n         them with more questions.\n\nQUESTION: Is there some other SHAREWARE package that will run under Windows\n         and do what SLIP is supposed to do? I need a package that is not too\n         expensive, which is why I am looking for shareware. I have heard that\n         there are regular commercial packages that do all this, but they cost\n         hundreds of dollars. These are the main requirements:\n\n         1. Must be able to run under Windows 3.1\n         2. Must allow VT100 and IBM TN3270 terminal emulation\n         3. Must allow ftp file transfers, since that's the only kind the\n            mainframe allows. No Y-modem or Z-modem etc. I believe the ftp\n            transfers are made through a kermit protocol, but I'm hazy about\n            that.\n\n         A subsidiary feature (that would be nice to have) if it's a true\n         Windows program (rather than a DOS program modified to run under\n         Windows) is the ability to run the session in a window concurrently\n         with other applications and to cut and paste between the telnet\n         session and other applications.\n\nAny information received is appreciated.

I posted a message here some time ago asking why my mouse was so jumpy.  \nWell, I think I know why, and it doesn't have anything to do with the \nmouse.  It seems to be the video driver!

We don't \nhave the same kind of mouse (mine is microsoft serial and his is an off-\nbrand serial mouse).  His mouse worked fine until I installed the S3 (v1.4) \ndriver on his system, then his mouse became really jumpy too!\n\nIs there anything I can do?  I need high resolution since I display LOTS of \nstuff on my screen (AMI Pro, Pegasus Mail for Windows, WP Office 4.0 -- \nsorry, nondisclosure!, and alot more).

Hiyas ALL,\n\nUpon getting Animated Desktop for Windows as a gift from my boyfriend, I \ncouldn't wait to install it. I had gotten an advertisement for it and put \nit aside \nwith my list of 'I Wants.' After installing the software, it didn't load. \nNo part of \nthe software would load even though the install went seemingly well.\n\n	I called Deltapoint with the problem and after asking me twenty \nmillion different questions about my system.. concluded that I had one of \nthe \nsystems that the software was 'incompatible with'. Of course they're \nwilling to \ngive me my $$$ back.. What a waste of time and energy.  The folks on their \nsupport line, although nice, are extremely ignorant regarding the workings \nof \nWindows 3.1. \n	After my experience with the installation of the SB 16, I  learned \nsome of the function of windows dll files. Before sending back Desktop \nAnimator,  decided to do some fooling around with the different versions of \n\n.dll files I had. I had 2 versions of cpalette.dll one dated 8/92 and > \n100K the \nother dated 1/93 and smaller (the 1/93 smaller version was the one supplied \n\nwith Desktop Animator). I moved the bigger, older version of cpalette.dll  \nto a \ndirectory outside my path. (For some reason, I had the older Cpalette.dll \nin my \nWindows directory and the newer cpallette in my windows\system directory.) \nWhen I did this, the animator's editor loaded.. and so did 2 other of the \napplications in the package.. the main application still didn't load. Does \nanyone have any ideas as to why this would occur or any further suggestions
Is there a way to use the mouse when running a DOS app (windowed) in\nwin 3.1?  When you window a dos apps (in enhanced mode), I can see\nwhere the mouse cursor was, but it doesn't work!  Any help\nwould be greatly appreciated.  Thank you
I prefer InfoSelect myself, but it is a strange kind of PIM. \n\n\n\nWell, a few things might help you like the 3.1 File Manager better.\n\n1) To get more than one window simply double click on a drive icon.\n   That it only gives you one window to work with is a fallacy. You\n   can drag files between windows, to any icon on the tree on the left\n   side of the window, and to any drive icon. This beats your "left\n   and right window" as you can have as many open as you wish instead \n   of just two.\n\n2) You can launch any app from within File Manager by double clicking\n   on the executable's icon.\n\n3) You can launch any application and open a document file by double\n   clicking on the document file's icon, provided you have\n   associations set correctly. This is easily done with the menus. The\n   "browse" capability adds a lot of functionality to 3.1. So if you\n   name all your text files with .txt and point all GIF, TIFF, etc.\n   files towards Paintshop or WinGIF, this takes care of your\n   requirement for "text reading and graphics viewing".\n\nI know someone who prefers using File Manager as his shell. Setting up\nall the associations you need is the way to do it.\n\nIf Directory Opus is half as good as File Manager then it must be\npretty good indeed! File Manager just needs you to understand how\nsome things are done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--

After hearing endless debate (READ: name-calling) over which os is better, dos\nand windows or OS/2 and finally having enought resourses to play with a couple\nof different operating systems, I have decided to put the two products to a\nhead to head test, as so many fellow newsposters have suggested.  I have, \nhowever, no desire whatsoever to use a version of os/2 which wont REALLY\ndo what it says (i.e. run windows apps)  OS/2 2.0-2.1 will not run windows\napps in 386 enhansed mode, something that most larger windows apps require, but\nOS/2 2.2, which is supposed to be in beta test, is supposed to.  I have heard\nthat os/2 2.2 beta is available via ftp, and I was wondering if anyone knew\nwhere to obtain a copy.  I would appreciate any information, as I would like, \nonce and for all, to establish for myself which is the best os for my needs.

I am working with Visual Basic v2.0 for windows.\nSpecifically, I am working on an application that generates formatted reports.\nSince, some of these reports can be rather large, my first question is:\n\n1.  Is there a way to increase the size of a list box or text box in\nVisual Basic/windows beyond the 64k limit?\n\nAs I have not (as yet - being optimistic :-) come across a way to get\naround the above problem, I am working on the following approach:\n\nI am trying to create my own defined template in MS-Word, using the\nWordBasic Macros so that I can open up Word from Visual Basic(VB) and load\nthis template of mine, which will work in the following way:\n\nIt will first open MyOwn.INI file (created in VB - at the time when the\nuser selected the kind of report he weanted) and read the section from the\n.INI file and jump to the appropriate code in template - which will then\nopen and read a file pertaining to the section it read from the .INI file.\n\n1.  When using the GetProfileString function in WordBasic, is there a way\nto specify/change the default .INI file (which is win.ini) to MyOwn.INI file?\n\n2. When using the file Input$ function in WordBasic - is there a way to\nread more than the 32k at one time?\n\n---\nAny help will be appreciated.
Hello again,\n\nAbout a week and one-half ago I posted a query looking for people feelings\non the inkjet family of printers.  Specifically, a comparison between the\nCanon BJ200 (BubbleJet) and the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500.  Many people\nasked me to post the summary/account of all the postings and e-mail I\nreceived.  Below is my original query and the responses I received.  I have\nnot deleted any part of the responses, only the headers and signatures, so\nyou can extract what you find necessary.  Some people asked me for an\nunbiased account; however, the very nature of the question suggests\nfavoritism and biased comments, you must extract the information you\nbelieve unbiased and a fair representation of each printer.  There are a\nwide range of comments, each has its own value.  \n\nThere was no clear winner, some like the BJ200 (especially its\nprice/performance ratio), others preferred the durability and reliability\nof the DeskJet (the original inkjet with proven drivers and a solid\nbackground).  Two new inkjet printers have drawn some attention, a new\nprinter to be introduced by Hewlett-Packard later this year (around\nsummertime), and an addition to the Epson product line (their first\ninkjet).  You will find that after the initial purchase, the costs of\nre-filling or replacing the ink cartridges are about the same (this largely\ndepends on where you purchase the re-fills or replacements -- so shop\naround first since this aspect will most likely dominate the cost of your\nprinter).  No one mentioned approx. how many sheets each ink cartridge will\nprint, but I suspect they are roughly equal at about 1000 - 1500 sheets\n(laser printers will do 4000-5000 sheets per toner cartridge).  Well,\nthat's a brief research summary of my personal research.  ENJOY!\n\n===========================================================================\n\n\nWell I bought the BJ 200 about a month ago at the start of their $50 rebate\nprogram on that printer (it ends 5/31), and I bought it from Computer\nDiscount Warehouse because their price of $325 couldn't be beat anywhere I\nlooked, and I think it's a HOT printer.  Just using regular copier paper\nproduced fantastic results just in high quality mode.  I compared the\noutput of a Micrografx Designer legal size drawing with 4pt type done on my\nBJ 200 with the same drawing printed on an HP Laserjet IID and I was amazed\nhow well I could read the small print on the BJ 200.  Printing speed was\nseveral seconds faster on the BJ 200 which is amazing considering that the\nHP has 2.5M ram installed.  I measured the time from when the printer first\nindicated it was receiving data (as I used print manager in Windows).\n\nI showed the output to several people at work and one manager bought one\nimmediately for his office, and two other engineers placed their orders\ntoo.  If you need CDW's phone number, it's 800-598-4239.  Delivery to NY\nwas two days.\n\nGood luck!\n\n\nCraig Witkowski, CENG51@maccvm.corp.mot.com\nMotorola Communications & Electronics Inc.\nGlen Rock,  NJ\n\n===========================================================================\n\nI own a Deskjet 500. Performance isn't spectacular under Windows using\nTrueType fonts but neither is the Canon from what I have seen. Quality for\nthe HP is very much dependent on paper quality - on 'standard' photo-copy\npaper the characters have slightly 'frayed' edges but on better quality\n'distinction' type paper things look better. For most applications I find\ncopy paper fine - still better than dot-matrix.  Comes with a Windows\ndriver, which seems to by-pass print manager, has a few\n'intelli-fonts'which are HP scaleable fonts - probably faster than TrueType\nbut haven't really tried them out. Can get RAM & FONT cartridges but unless\nthe speed of TrueType is a problem I wouldn't bother. The RAM cartridges\ncan't be used as buffer - soft fonts only.\n\nFor graphics, i.e. BMP images etc the HP can be put into a dither mode via\nthe HP supplied Win driver. There a number of dither options such as\n'scatter', 'pattern' etc.  The manual gives recommendations depending on\nthe type of image being printed.  Text is not so good in this mode. Problem\narises when you have a document which contains both graphic and text.  The\nrange of tones for graphic images isn't brilliant but I think that is more\nof a limitation with inkjet printers in general.\n\n\nHowever, a printer definitely worth looking at is the new inkjet from\nEpson.  This printer is faster, cheaper, and capable of producing\nlaser-like quality on normal copier paper.  Can't remember the model #, LX\n- something I think?\n\nI purchased my HP days before the Epson was released here :-{.  The\nintroductory price on the Epson was the same as the HP here in New Zealand.\n \n===========================================================================\n\nAbout a month ago, I got a Canon BJ200.  I absolutely LOVE it.  It is\nincredibly fast, except for printing from PSPICE (I don't know if you ever\ndo stuff with that or not.)  Most of the stuff I print is either from\nMicrosoft Word for Windows or just plain text.  The only problems I've had\nare printing headers/footers (the printer freaked out), and printing on\ncheap paper (lots of streaks).  Normal copy paper works great with it, you\ncan only tell it's not laser-printed by holding it, oh, less than twelve\ninches from your face.  (That is, if you're nearsighted, like me! :) ) The\nprinter comes with its own driver for Windows 3.1!!  I have no other\ncomplaints.  The printer also can act just like some EPSON or another for\nthose archaic software packages that haven't written a driver for it yet.\nThe teeny-weeny footprint is a real plus, too--AND, if you purchase it\nbetween now and May 31, you get a $50 rebate from Canon!!  I bought mine\nfrom a store called CompUSA, and the price now is $340.  I have a friend\nwho has the HP you are looking at.  It also prints very well, and everyone\nhas drivers for it, BUT it is VERY slow!\n\nHope I helped!\n\n(360dpi sure looks great!)\n\nHeather Stehman\n\n===========================================================================\n\n\n  I guess I have some experience with both: I have a BJ-300 at work and a\nDeskjet 500 at home.  I prefer the Deskjet.  The printing speed and quality\nare similar (I tested both with text and graphics before buying the Deskjet\nfor home).  The feature that sets the Deskjet apart is the driver support\nin so many applications.  The BJ ends up emulating the Epson LQ or IBM\nProprinter to get it to work with many non-windows apps and this will be\nthe case for a long time.  The design is superior if you just want to use\ncut paper, the Deskjet is quieter, AND the ink cartridges are quite a bit\ncheaper due to the number of Deskjets out there in comparision to the BJs.\n\n  Just my $0.02 worth..\n\n-- \nMike Mattix\nAgricultural Group of Monsanto\nP.O. Box 174\nLuling, LA 70070\nINTERNET Address: dmmatt@bigez.monsanto.com\n\n===========================================================================\n\n  Yes, there is the landscape mode printing problem, but it does not\npresent a problem in Windows as the Windows printer driver handles the\ntranslation.  I actually thought of some other points after I posted the\nnote.  The Deskjet has an unprintable area of approximately .5inch around\nthe paper the Bubblejet does not.  You are right about the graphics\nresolutions, I tested the printers with the applications I had access to:\nWordperfect, Harvard Graphics, WinGIF, Paintshop PRO, and Paintbrush and\ncould not tell a difference.  In fact one of the HP Deskjet Windows drivers\ngives you significant control over the contrast and density of the printer\nhence controlling the amount of ink you put down.  The Bubblejet did not.\nI had no imaging software to test the printers with and so had no\ncomparision there.  Finally, I wanted sheet feeding.  In that configuration\nthe Bubblejet cost approximately $100 more than the Deskjet.\n\nI went through a pretty thorough evaluation and chose the Deskjet when I\nspent my own money.  BTW, I am replacing the BJ-300 with a Deskjet 500 at\nwork this month anyway.\n\nRegards\n\nMike Mattix\nAg Group of Monsanto\nLuling, LA\n\n===========================================================================\n\nI spent some time comparing the two.  We ended up getting the Bubblejet\nBJ-200 versus the HP.  Our reasons were:\n\n1) The HP seemed to have worse banding than the Canon\n2) 360dpi versus 300 - we felt we could see the difference\n3) Price - Canon has a $50 rebate program going on at the moment.\n\nThe BJ-200 was our choice over the BJ-10ex - we could have 100 pages in the\nBJ-200 feeder.  The BJ-10ex holds only 30 pages, I think.\n\nAs you can see, up to 100 pages on the BJ-200.  We haven't done anything\nbig with the BJ, but its performance seems reasonable under Windows.  I\nknow that the Microsoft BBS has a newer windows driver than comes with the\nprinter, but I don't know how it compares (also the driver included with\nthe printer is Canon's whereas I don't know where the Microsoft BBS one\ncomes from - Microsoft?)\n\nHope this helps.\n-- \nThomas V. Frauenhofer, WA2YYW\ntvf@cci.com, ...!uunet!uupsi!cci632!tvf, tvf@cs.rit.edu\nMandlebratwurst: The Meal that Eats Itself!\n\n===========================================================================\n\nAltough I'm sometimes also a salesperson (if I'm not suppost to study :-))\nI would recommend to buy the BJ200. The printing quality is a bit better,\nbut you you've got much more possiblities. Don't forget the HP engine is at\nleast 2 years on the marked, the Canon engine (witch is also used in\nother "new" bubblejet printers like e.g. the Epson ones) is quite recently\navailable..\n\n\nI've seen during a short demonstration (from someone who tryed to sell me\nCanon printers) 2 times the same picture, one printed with the BJ200, one\nwith the Canon, the other with the HP, and.. there was a difference in\nprinting- quality,.. The Canon was a bit better..\n\nGreetz,\n\nKris\n\n===========================================================================\n\nWhen we decided we needed quiet printers in our hospital we looked to\ninkjet printers.  They have near laser quality, speed, and they are quiet.\nWe use both HP Deskjets and the Canon BJ-200s.  I prefer the paper handling\nqualities of the Deskjets but I feel the Canons have superior print\nquality.  The Ideal would be a Canon with a sheet feeder, however I did end\nup buying a deskjet for home use (got too good a deal).  Anyway, we are\nusing Canons in high volume areas and they are holding up very well.  Out\nof 15 Deskjets and 4 BJ-200s I have only had one problem with a deskjet and\nthat was taken care of very quickly by HP.\n\n							-Nate\n\n===========================================================================\n\nWhenever I buy anything I look at what the "experts" say, pick out the top\nfew and then buy on whatever criteria are the most apt.  I've been\nunusually flush lately (no begging letter please) and so I've done this a\nfew times including - about four months ago - with inkjet printers.\n\nI can't remember much about the process except that I read about three\nreviews of inkjets and that the 500 was always at or near the top.  I\nbought the 500C because of the added dimension of colour (I intend to build\na multi- media machine at some stage and have just bought a colour scanner\ntowards that).  Although I haven's used the colour thing in earnest yet I\ntried it out on a couple of Windows bitmaps and I was pleased with the\nresult.\n\nI note that even though you can now get the 550C (the one with both colour\nand mono with no need to change the cartridge), the 500C and 500 are still\nreadily available (at least in the UK).  The following are my\nviews/experience:\n\n	1.	I don't know anything about the Canon except that I came away\n		from reviews (and replies to a posting similar to yours) with\n		the idea that the HP offered the best performance/price ratio.\n\n	2.	I believe HP are the originals in the field - not always the\n		ideal place to be but the market's still young so one assumes\n		they have the expertise.\n\n	3.	The 500C is worth the extra.  Operation in mono is perfectly\n		acceptable and I get good crisp reproduction of fonts from\n		Windows.\n\n	4.	I used to work for Monotype when they still manufactured\n		typesetters (before their AMERICAN owners closed them down!)\n		and I can tell you that in terms of definition 300 dpi is\n		pretty poor anyway so 360 dpi is just a bit less poor...\n\n	5.	The HP comes with a reasonable set of drivers.\n\n	6.	If you buy it invest in the additional RAM pack - it's pretty\n		slow with it, God knows what it's like without!\n\nI actually work in Germany and my PC is home in the UK so it's not in daily\nuse.  I would say that apart from my not reading the manual properly and\nhaving a really dumb problem at the start it's easy peasy to operate.\n\nHope this is of use.\n\nRegards\n\nDavid	\n\n===========================================================================\n\nJust bought the BJ-200.  I thought the price couldn't be beat ($329, with\n$50 rebate thru 5/31) and so far it is comparable, even superior, to the\nDeskJet in print quality.\n\nSpeed:   Per page rate seems to be faster (I don't have figures).\n         I don't print long docs, though.\n\nQuality: I think the graphics quality is excellent.  Print quality is\n         excellent as well, unless you use small fonts and hold it up\n         close; you can see a lot more "jaggies" than on a LaserJet.\n         The 360 dpi is offset by a little less accuracy in holding the\n         page/print head in place, I would imagine.\n\nLarge docs:  Not room in the standard model for a whole lotta pages ...\n         manual says up to 100, though.  Haven't tried it.\n\nDrivers:  No problems under Win3.1 yet.  WinWord doesn't want to print\n         the envelopes the same way the Canon does, though.\n\nKnow nothing of add-on costs.\n\n Daniel A. Hartung  --  dhartung@chinet.chinet.com  --  Ask me about Rotaract\n\n===========================================================================\n\n\nI just bought a BJ-200 printer a couple of days ago.  I compared it to the\nsample print of an HP DeskJet 500 and knew that the HP wasn't for me.  The\nBJ-200 is pretty fast and really prints with good quality.  I can compare\nit with the HP LaserJet IIID PostScript and they look almost identical (\ndepending on the kind of paper).  I don't have problems with the ink not\nbeing dry, it seems to dry VERY fast.  Probably within a second.  Since\nCanon is giving a $50 rebate until the end of May, it is really a good buy.\n\n\n---\nSean Eckton\nComputer Support Representative\nCollege of Fine Arts and Communications\n\n===========================================================================\n\nWow, it's funny you should ask this.  I'm a little behind in news reading\nso I know this may be late.\n\n  I just purchased the Canon Bubblejet last night.  I was really worried\nthat I wouldn't like it but the print quality, and noise level is\nfantastic!  I printed quite a few documents with lots of graphics and it\nprinted DAMN near laser quality.  You can't tell it's not laser unless you\nget 2 inches from the page.\n\n  no problems with drivers.

This is indeed true. I prefer Windows NT. It is certainly much better\nthan Microsoft Windows 3.1/DOS.
There was a post about something similar a while back.  It seems windows\ndoes *not* take it upon itself to free up any sys. resources an\napplllication is using when that application is done.  That job is left\nentirely to the application.  that is, the application has to clean up\nafter itself when it quits.\n\nAnyone out there know if there is a utility for windows which  will\nclean up sys. resources when an application quits (mother.zip???).\n\npeace,\nMickey
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nNot unreasonable, since the SMARTDRV packaged with DOS 6 is version 4.1.\nMake sure that all your drivers (HIMEM, EMM386, SMARTDRV) are being\nexecuted from the DOS directory.\n\nLoss of the cache provided by SMARTDRV could be your problem; if not,\nI don't know what might cause the startup delay.  My testbed for DBLSPACE\n(which has a *very* minimal amount of data on the disk so that I don't\neat up too much time as I install and uninstall DBLSPACE) boots in \nabout 20 seconds from the "Starting MS-DOS" herald to the end of the\nAUTOEXEC.BAT execution.  I don't have handy a system with a more\nrealistic volume of data to time.
It's the applications that do this.  Unfortunately, even the applets\nthat ship with Win31 seem to have this problem (I've seen it in\nSolitaire, for example).  \n\n\nNone that I know of.  If an application doesn't give back the\nresources, they are lost and gone forever, pending a restart of\nWindows. \n\n\nIf the applications don't free up the memory (and a lot of them\ndon't), there's bugger all that any other piece of software can do\nabout it.\n\n\nNo.  This is a problem with the applications, usually.\n\n\nThere are books written on this one.  In general, just be sure to free\nup everything that you ask for before you exit.  Unfortunately, I\nunderstand that VB will *internally* lose resources for you, so\nthere's no way to avoid this entirely.\n\n\n\nThere's little discussion because it's 'inevitable' until MS manages\nto come up with an OS that will do garbage collection or something on\nthe resource pool.\n\n-- \n"Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live\n in the real world."   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden
Excellent suggestion, Ron.  And as a further comment on DOS 6, if\nyou decide to install Windows standalone configuration completely,\nin more than 1 directory on your hard drive, and use DOS 6 to\njump to a specific copy for each user, you could be saving yourself\nmany megs of disk space if you use the SETUP /N and /A technique!!

I know that I've seen this question asked before, but I don't remember\nseeing any answers..So here it is again:\n\n     Does any one know of an ftp site where the WD90C31 driver might reside?\nI've checked cica, and I'm sure it's not there (I'm refering to the new\nversion of the driver that came out in 2(?)/93).  I have seen it on c-serve,\nbut I hesitate to d/l 1 meg. at 2400 bps unless I really have to!\n     Alternativly, is it possible to get Paradise (or WD) to mail me the new\ndrivers, or don't they do that.\n\n     Finally, is it even worth the hassle of getting these things, or is\nthere not much improvement over my 10/92 version?\n\n                             Thanks for the info,\n                                    Peter\n--
Wow, what did you use it for?  Single-tasked word processing?\nI have 8 files loaded right now and a 29-MB virtual machine (12MB of\nRAM). My friend down the street gripes that he can't even format a\nfloppy in the background.  Many unix people love OS/2 because they are\nused to multi-tasking systems. \n\n\n\nToo bad they hold a gun to the mouse piper while they\nthrow mice at their "new" trap, trying to get it to work. :)\n\n ---------------------------------------------
To windows 3.0, yes.\n\n\nIt's definitely dated - I used OS/2 1.21, & alpha 2.0 (when msft was\ndeveloping it...)\n\n\nI preferred Windows 3.1 because it was more stable & faster than 3.0,\nbut could still run more apps than OS/2 (again I made this choice\nbefore 2.0 was released).\n\n\nNo, I've seen no such data.\n\n\nhee hee.  good one  ;>  ;>\n\n\n...and one that I've encountered as well...\n\n\nHmm. Are you sure?  I'm speaking from my own experience as an\nOS/2 _user_. Certainly people in, say, the NT marketing group \nwould be in a unique position to present the results of, say,\nresearch on upcoming NT and OS/2 apps (vs Windows and MS-DOS apps).\nPart of my point was that just cause one works at microsoft does \nnot mean one has access to such data (if it exists).\n\n\nI will confess to, at times, attacking the poster.  \n\n\nAgain, my point was that not all microsofties are here to "sell" \nreaders on our products (which would conflict with the "no-ads" \nphilosophy of usenet).  Nor do we necessarily have access to info\nthat others have.\n\nI also get tired of people assuming that microsofties are, like,\nmembers of the BORG.\n\n-jen\n\n--

If he says he knows for a fact, what more do you have to gain if he gives\nhis word?  Do you think he's lying right now?\n\n\nAnyway, how about this: I give you my word, without naming sources, that IBM\npaid companies to write applications for OS/2.  Satisfied?
I have the following problem on a Dell 450SE with the ATI Graphics Ultra Pro \nEISA:\n\nWhen I start Windows, the first 5 times I try to run an application, it does\nnot start. Windows will show the following error message:\n\n   Error Executing application. There is not enough memory to run the    \n   application.\n\nAfter the first 5 tries, the application I want to run will start, and \nafterwards there are no more problems. When I change the Video driver from \nMach 32 to 8514/a, this problem does not occur, so I suspect the ATI \ndrivers (I tried both the build 55 and build 59 driver).\n\nDoes anyone have a clue?
It does sound funny, I will admit.  But for me it is true.  Windows crashed on\nall of the time (and from what I have read in PC Mag, this is not the exception)\n.  OS/2 gives each windows app a VDM and they can't touch each other or\n(generally) anything they aren't supposed to have.  If windows works for you,\nthen great.  Maybe this is why some people don't see why OS/2 is the OS of \nchoice.  If windows doesn't crash on you, and you don't mind waiting on each\ntask, and not being able to adress your memory better than DOS, some of the\nkey reasons for using OS/2 are gone.  I probably  would still use it, but it\nwould be more of an even fight.\nBrett

You get more than what you pay for.\n	      Don't sue me if I'm wrong.\n\n\n    OVERVIEW\n\n    The DIB image file format is intended to be a "Device Independent  Bitmap"\n    file  format.  (What Microsoft means by "Device Independent" is unclear to\n    me.) Four pixel resolutions are supported: 1 bit, 4 bit, 8 bit, and 24 bit\n    pixels.\n\n    These images were intended for use on DOS (IBM, or Little-Endian) systems.\n    If	you  are  creating them on another architecture you will have to byte-\n    swap all short and long integer values.\n\n    By convention, DIB images end in the extension ".BMP".   This  is  because\n\n\n\n			      March 15, 1991\n\n\n\n\n\n				    - 2 -\n\n\n    they  are  a  super-set of earlier "bitmap image files".  Consequently you\n    will sometimes hear DIB files referred to as "BMP" files.\n\n    Since DIB images files are a super-set, there are three "flavors"  of  DIB\n    images:\n	 o   DOS DIB images.  These are the recommended	 convention,  and  the\n	     form  which I will describe how to create.	 They are intended for\n	     applications running under MS Windows /3.0 in a DOS environment.\n	 o   OS/2 DIB images.  My understanding is that these are  the	flavor\n	     of DIB images that were used by the Presentation Manager.\n	 o   Old-style Bitmap images.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n			      March 15, 1991\n\n\n\n\n\n				    - 3 -\n\n\n    DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FLAVORS\n\n    The DOS DIB images consist of:\n	 1.  A "BITMAPFILEHEADER" file header which identifies the file	 as  a\n	     DIB  file.	  This	header	also gives the total size of the image\n	     file, and the offset to the image data.\n	 2.  A "BITMAPINFOHEADER"  image  header  which	 specifies  the	 image\n	     attributes.\n	 3.  An optional palette of colors used by the image.  If  it  exists,\n	     this  may contain 2, 16, or 256 entries.  Each entry is a Windows\n	     RGBQUAD structure.\n	 4.  The image data itself.\n\n\n    The OS/2 DIB images consist of:\n	 1.  The same "BITMAPFILEHEADER" file header which identifies the file\n	     as	 a  DIB	 file.	 This  header also gives the total size of the\n	     image file, and the offset to the image data.\n	 2.  A "BITMAPCOREHEADER"  image  header  which	 specifies  the	 image\n	     attributes.\n	 3.  An optional palette of colors used by the image.  Again, if  this\n	     exists  it	 may  contain  2, 16, or 256 entries.  Each entry is a\n	     Windows RGBTRIPLE structure.\n	 4.  The image data itself.\n\n\n    The Old Style image bitmap consists of:\n	 1.  Either a BITMAPINFOHEADER or a  BITMAPCOREHEADER.	 Which	header\n	     type is determined by the first long integer (DWORD) value.\n	 2.  An optional color palette.	  This	palette	 may  be  composed  of\n	     either   Windows	RGBQUAD	  structures  (if  the	header	was  a\n	     BITMAPINFOHEADER) or Windows RGBTRIPLE structures (if the	header\n	     was a BITMAPCOREHEADER).\n	 3.  The image data itself.\n\n\n    CREATING DIB IMAGE FILES.\n\n    Creating a DOS DIB image file consists of several straight forward	steps.\n    The headers need to be created and then written to the file.  These header\n    structures are defined in the MS  Windows/3.0  "windows.h"	include	 file.\n    Palette  information  needs	 to  be	 stored for images that are not 24-bit\n    images.  The five general steps are:\n	 1.  Filling  in  the  BITMAPFILEHEADER	  and	the   BITMAPINFOHEADER\n	     structures the basic image information.\n	 2.  If the image is a 1-bit, 4-bit, or an 8-bit image,	 creating  the\n	     color palette of RGBQUADS.\n	 3.  Calculating the total file size and putting this  information  in\n\n\n\n			      March 15, 1991\n\n\n\n\n\n				    - 4 -\n\n\n	     the "bfSize" field of the BITMAPFILEHEADER.\n	 4.  Calculating the offset to the image data from the	start  of  the\n	     file,   and   putting  this  in  the  "bfOffBits"	field  of  the\n	     BITMAPFILEHEADER.\n	 5.  Writing to the file the BITMAPFILEHEADER,	the  BITMAPINFOHEADER,\n	     the color palette, and the image data (in that order).\n\n    The following sections describe structures in terms of MicroSoft  C	 type-\n    defined  keywords.	The following table describes these keywords for those\n    not familiar with MicroSoft C.\n\n		     _______________________________________\n		    |					   |\n		    | Type-defined keywords in MicroSoft C.|\n		    |______________________________________|\n		    | typedef |	 meaning		   |\n		    |_________|____________________________|\n		    | BYTE    |	 unsigned character	   |\n		    | WORD    |	 two byte unsigned integer |\n		    | DWORD   |	 four byte unsigned integer|\n		    |_________|____________________________|\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n			      March 15, 1991\n\n\n\n\n\n				    - 5 -\n\n\n    THE BITMAPFILEHEADER\n\n    This structure is defined in "windows.h" as:\n	 typedef struct tagBITMAPFILEHEADER {\n		 WORD	 bfType;\n		 DWORD	 bfSize;\n		 WORD	 bfReserved1;\n		 WORD	 bfReserved2;\n		 DWORD	 bfOffBits;\n	 } BITMAPFILEHEADER;\n\n    The "bfType" field is the two ascii characters 'B' and 'M'.	  This	serves\n    to	identify  the  file  as	 a  DIB	 image file.  On an intel byte ordered\n    machine (IBM or a compatible), this constant can be formed	in  C  as  the\n    quantity ('M' << 8 | 'B') == 0x4d42 on an intel system.\n\n    The "bfSize" field is the total size of the file.  For our	purposes  this\n    field  is equal to: the size of the BITMAPFILEHEADER, plus the size of the\n    BITMAPINFOHEADER, plus the number of entries in the	 color	palette	 times\n    the	 size  of  a  RGBQUAD, plus the number of bytes of image data.	If the\n    image data is being written out in an uncompressed form, this value can be\n    calculated	ahead  of  time.   Otherwise, this field needs to be filled in\n    later.\n\n    Both the "bfReserved1" and the "bfReserved2"  fields  are  always  set  to\n    zero.\n\n    The "bfOffBits" field is set to the offset to the start of the image  data\n    from  the  start  of the file.  For our purposes, this field should be set\n    to:	 the  size  of	the   BITMAPFILEHEADER,	  plus	 the   size   of   the\n    BITMAPINFOHEADER,  plus  the  number of entries in the color palette times\n    the size of a RGBQUAD.  This works out because the image data  is  written\n    write after the color palette if one exists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n			      March 15, 1991\n\n\n\n\n\n				    - 6 -\n\n\n    THE BITMAPINFOHEADER\n\n    This structure is defined in "windows.h" as:\n	 typedef struct tagBITMAPINFOHEADER{\n		 DWORD	 biSize;\n		 DWORD	 biWidth;\n		 DWORD	 biHeight;\n		 WORD	 biPlanes;\n		 WORD	 biBitCount;\n		 DWORD	 biCompression;\n		 DWORD	 biSizeImage;\n		 DWORD	 biXPelsPerMeter;\n		 DWORD	 biYPelsPerMeter;\n		 DWORD	 biClrUsed;\n		 DWORD	 biClrImportant;\n	 } BITMAPINFOHEADER;\n\n    The "biSize" field is set to the size of  the  BITMAPINFOHEADER  structure\n    itself.   When  reading  the  image	 file,	this  value is what is used to\n    determine  that  the  image	 contains  a  BITMAPINFOHEADER	 and   not   a\n    BITMAPCOREHEADER.\n\n    The "biWidth" field is the width of the image in image pixels.\n\n    The "biHeight" field is the height of the image in image lines.\n\n    The "biPlanes" field should always be set to 1.  This data is written  out\n    as if there was one color plane.\n\n    The "biBitCount" field is the bit-depth of the image.  This must be either\n    1, 4, 8, or 24, depending on the bit-depth of the image data.\n\n    The "biCompression" field tells how the image data is compressed if it  is\n    compressed.	   DIB	images	support	 two  forms  of	 run-length  encoding.\n    However, I have never seen any images which use it, and don't know yet how\n    it works.  Set this field to zero (long zero, or 0L), to indicate that the\n    data is not compressed.\n\n    All subsequent fields of the BITMAPINFOHEADER  structure  may  be  set  to\n    zero.   A  requirement  of	the  interpretting software that it be able to\n    compute these fields as necessary from the previous information.\n\n    The field which you might want to explicitly specify might be "biClrUsed".\n    For	 4-bit	and  8-bit  images  this  field	 indicates that not all of the\n    possible color entries are used and that the  image	 contains  "biClrUsed"\n    colors.  If you are using only 32 colors with an 8-bit image, then you may\n    only want to save 32 of the possible 256 palette entries.  Generally,  set\n    this field to zero.\n\n\n\n			      March 15, 1991\n\n\n\n\n\n				    - 7 -\n\n\n    COLOR PALETTES\n\n    Each entry of a  color  palette  is	 a  RGBQUAD  structure.	  The  RGBQUAD\n    structure is defined in the "windows.h" include file as:\n	 typedef struct tagRGBQUAD {\n		 BYTE	 rgbBlue;\n		 BYTE	 rgbGreen;\n		 BYTE	 rgbRed;\n		 BYTE	 rgbReserved;\n	 } RGBQUAD;\n    The "rgbReserved" field is always zero.  For each color used,  the	amount\n    of Blue, Green, and Red are filled into the structure and the structure is\n    written to the file.  A value of zero in  the  "rgbBlue",  "rgbGreen",  or\n    "rgbRed"   fields  indicates  that	that  particular  component  does  not\n    contribute to the color composition.  A value  of  255  in	any  of	 these\n    fields  indicates  that  the  component  contributes  fully	 to  the color\n    composition.\n\n\n\n    IMAGE DATA\n\n    There are three surprises about the ordering of image data	in  DIB	 image\n    file.   The	 creator  of  this  format  was determined to be creative, and\n    certainly was.\n\n    Within the image data, each line written out is padded to  the  next  four\n    byte  quantity.   So,  if  you had an 8-bit image which was only one pixel\n    wide, you still have to write out four bytes for every  image  line.   The\n    number of bytes per line can be calculated as:\n\n		 bytes_per_line = (width_in_pix * bit_depth + 31 ) / 32 * 4;\n\n	---or, in terms of the fields of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure---\n\n		 bytes_per_line = (biWidth * biBitCount + 31 ) / 32 * 4;\n\n\n    When writing out your image data, you must write it out bottom line first.\n    The	 bottom line of the image as you would look at it on the screen is the\n    first line of image data in the file.\n\n    For 1-bit, 4-bit, and 8-bit images, information is written	as  you	 would\n    expect.   One  bit	images	are  padded  eight pixels to a byte.  Four bit\n    images are padded two pixels to a byte.  Eight bit images are written  one\n    pixel per byte.  Twenty-four bit images are written three bytes per pixel.\n    However, for 24-bit images the information must  be	 written  out  in  the\n    order  blue,  green, red.  While most image file formats write data out in\n\n\n\n			      March 15, 1991\n\n\n\n\n\n				    - 8 -\n\n\n    an "RGB" ordering, a DIB image file	 writes	 the  data  out	 in  an	 "BGR"\n    ordering.\n\n    SUMMARY\n\n    This  should  provide  enough  information	to  create  DIB	 images	  from\n    applications  such	as  scanners  or for image exporting routines.	If you\n    find out any more about DIB images, please pass the information on	to  me\n    so that I can modify this document accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n			      March 15, 1991\n\n\n--\n    Thomas B.

Hello All!\n\n    It is my understanding that all True-Type fonts in Windows are loaded in\nprior to starting Windows - this makes getting into Windows quite slow if you\nhave hundreds of them as I do.  First off, am I correct in this thinking -\nsecondly, if that is the case - can you get Windows to ignore them on boot and\nmaybe make something like a PIF file to load them only when you enter the\napplications that need fonts?  Any ideas?\n\n\nChris
I have the same problem with a Diamond Stealth VRAM card.\nDaniel> .
Here's the situation:\n\nAt home, I have MS Word for windows but no printer.  At work, I\nhave windows + a postscript printer, but not MS Word.  So, I\nconfigure my machine at home to use a postscript printer, and use\nthe print to file option, which produces a nice postscript file,\nwhich I then bring to work.\n\nMy question:  how do I print this postscript file through the print\nmanager at work? If, for example, I select print from the file\nmanager, it treats the postscript as a text file, and gives me\nseveral pages of postscript gibberish.\n\nI know that I can open a DOS window and do:\n\n	 copy file.ps com1:\n\nwhich does work, but seems not to multitask very well -- other applications\nrun rather slowly and often pause for 10's of seconds.\n\nThere ought to be a way of passing the postscript file to the Print\nManager, but if there is, I can't find any mention of it in the\ndocumentation.\n\nAnyone know how to do this?

This does not happen\non any other of our machines, and I am wondering whether this is a\nfeature or whether this is related to several problems we are having\nwith the machine.\n\nThe system is a Gateway 2000, 4DX-33 machine.\n\nThe messages that appear are:\n\n	(c) Copyright 1989-1992 Western Digital Corporation\n		All Rights Reserved\n	(c) Copyright 1985-1992 Congruent Corporation\n		All Rights Reserved\n	(c) Copyright 1985-1992 Microsoft Corporation\n		All Rights Reserved\n\nThe AUTOEXEC.BAT file looks like this:\n\n@ECHO OFF\nPROMPT $P$G\nSET MOUSE=C:\MSMOUSE\nC:\MSMOUSE\MOUSE\nPATH=C:\;C:\DOS;C:\WINDOWS;c:\123;c:\wp51;f:\apps;f:\system;f:\winapps;f:\public\nSET TEMP=C:\WINDOWS\TEMP\nlh wd8003e -n 0x62 5 0x280 0xd000\nlh winpkt 0x60 0x62\nlh ipx\nlh netx\nf:\login\login\nwin :\n\nThe CONFIG.SYS file looks like this:\n\nDEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\HIMEM.SYS\nDOS=HIGH,umb\nDEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\EMM386.EXE NOEMS X=D000-D1FF\nSTACKS=9,256\nFILES=50\nBUFFERS=30\nSHELL=C:\DOS\COMMAND.COM /P /E:1024\n\nDoes anyone know what is going on?

The May issue of PC/Computing page 246 has a Windows hint and tips for\njust this thing.  You have to edit the WIN.INI file and add a couple\nof lines.  I tried it and it works.  I actually made my Title bar\nand iconized text, and icon text smaller.  On my monitor it works well.\nYou can select a larger font also.  You edit the WIN.INI file with\na font name in your system directory.  Read the article because I would\nnot want to retype it here in case I type errored and caused your\nsystem problems.\n\nC-ya..... /\/\artin
Make sure you use the small fonts driver & not the large fonts driver. Check\nthat in your setup. That's the only explanation I would find.\n\n\n						Hope this helps
Please post your response as well.  I think many would be \ninterested in this one.  Thank You.\n--
Like it or not stock prices and sales of a particular product ARE measures\nof success. They can be measures of short term or long term success. I think\nin MS case they are a good measure of their long term success. The original\npost mentioned how it seems on this group that there are a large number\nof people attacking MS and not willing to accept anything positive about MS.\nI was trying to make a point that the attacks are over emphasized and to\nlook at the sales of MS products they definitely tell a different story.
PhaNG, the Philadelphia Area NEXTSTEP User Group, will be holding a public  \nsneak preview of NEXTSTEP for Intel Processors.\n\nWhere: David Rittenhouse Labs Room A1\n       33rd And Walnut, southeast corner, Philadelphia PA\nWhen:  Wednesday, May 5th\n       7 pm to 9 pm\n			 \n			 \nNEXTSTEP is the 32 bit UNIX based operating environment which has, until now,\nonly been available on Motorola-based NeXT computers. In the May 11th issue\nof PC Magazine called NEXTSTEP a "Hot Prospect". Now, NeXT is nearing release\nof a version of NEXTSTEP which will run on 486-based PC's, yet is identical to\nthe 68040 version. In fact, NEXTSTEP 3.1 includes the ability to easily \ncompile a program into a single binary which will run on both Intel and\nMotorola hardware.\n\nNEXTSTEP 3.1 for Intel Processors will be demonstrated on an Epson Progression\n486 computer. NEXTSTEP is scheduled for release on May 25 at NeXTWorld Expo\nin San Francisco.\n\nThe demonstration will be open to the public. Come one come all!

I don't know the specifics of the compression algorithm, but I've used the\nshareware program, PaintShop, to convert between the two.  You can download\nit from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, but I don't know what the file is called\nor what directory it is in (you can start by looking in pub/pc/win3 or try\nscanning the index files).\n\nTo convert a .BMP file to a .RLE file, you just load the .BMP file and do a\n"Save as..."  Select "Windows bitmap" and "Compressed" (or is it "RLE"?)\nWhatever it is, it's fairly intuitive...\n\nSorry I don't have all the details, but I'm currently on an IBM3151 dumb\nterminal and can't do much researching...Good luck!
You mean grep (Unix is case dependent) and awk (where did you get AUCK from?)
I  _do_ know  that  IBM systems, the PS/2 56SLC2, in  particular, have\nabsolutely no  problem  with  OS/2--never had  a "random" crash  while\nrunning any of  my programs under  OS/2.   In fact, I  don't  remember\n_ever_ crashing.\n\nOf course, I really don't run any  OS/2 programs, just the  same bunch\nof DOS and Windows stuff that I've always been running.\n\nAnd  when  I  had  the  56SLC  (this is  the  386SLC  system)  running\nDos/Windows, I had only  one crash, and it was consistent.   FTP had a\ntendency  to  crash  whenever  I would  get  large  files (>1mb)  from\nparticularly fast  clients  (DTR's  150K-200K/sec), I  figured out the\nproblem was with smartdrv's write buffering--if I turned off the write\nbuffer, everything would work fine.\n\nFTP under OS/2 has never locked,  though.  I can even format  floppies\n(to use the most often cited example of the superiority of OS/2.)\n\n\nYeah, I guess I'm willing to admit that OS/2  is somewhat sensitive to\nspecific hardware.  WP51 for DOS works perfectly fine on my SLC2...\n\n\nWell,  I save all  my  personal files to floppy,  and when  i did that\nunder Windows, a floppy save of a large file hung up the system.\n\nI  also found  it quite bothersome to  have  to  continually tweak the\ntasking options  on fractint for dos whenever I wanted to do a fractal\ncomputation in the background.
I have been backing up my hard drive ever since I had to re-install\neverything from scratch after a crash (learned the hard way, didn't I?!).\nI am using a windows-based backup program (actually Norton), and I \nbegan wondering about the logic of this.  Sure, if I accidentally delete\na file, I can get it from the archive.  But what if my disk crashes again?\nI would not be able to start windows to run the backup program!  (Note,\nby crash, I mean, there was some error message that prevented the machine\nfrom booting properly.  I think I gave up too early, but I didn't have\nthe time/patience/tools to figure out exactly what the problem was.  My\nhard drive needed cleaning up anyway. Yeah right...)  This whole scenario\nis complicated by the fact that I am using Stacker.\n\nSo I think there are 2 possibilities:\n\n   1) I'm right.  If my disk really crashes, I would at least have to\n      re-install DOS and Windows to get the backup program working.\n   2) I'm wrong.  There is an easy way to make a "mirror" of a hard disk\n      that can easily restore it's state from scratch.\n\nThe polls are open...
I've been using Windows NT (tm) since the October release, and I have to \nsay that the March release is really a big improvement.  Windows NT (tm)\nis becomming usable.\n\nThere are a few things to consider before you make the leap though.\nFirst (for me at least) is that you cannot get a full-speed DOS box.\nWhat I mean is, I cannot (for instance) run Falcon 3.0 or any other\nresourse intensive program in a DOS box.  It absolutley crawls.  \nAnd my machine is a 486/33 with a 330MB HD and 16MB RAM.  If anyone\nknows how to get a fast DOS box (or full-screen for that matter), \nplease let me know.\n\nThe second thing is there are still not many drivers around for stuff.\nFor instance, my PAS-16 has been demoted to running as a Sound Blaster\n(which is natively supported -- nice), because MediaVision hasn't \nproduced drivers yet.\n\nYour disk should be large enough to keep an 80MB DOS partition, and\ngive the rest over to Windows NT (tm).  The only thing is, whenever\nyou wanted to run Windows programs, you'd have to reboot and log into\nWindows NT (tm), instead of just typing WIN.\n\nWindows NT (tm) does seem to be much more stable than normal Windows\nthough.  It'd be a good choice if you have the resources.  You should\nreally have *at LEAST* 8MB RAM though.  One last thing, modems work\nwell enough, but I have yet to get my FAX card to work, and I've never\nheard of anyone else who did either.\n\nIt's only better than UNIX because it runs killer software out of the\nbox, whereas with UNIX there isn't the same availablity.\n\nI guess it comes down to -- Windows NT (tm) is not yet for the faint\nof heart, it's still a beta.  But it's a very GOOD beta.\n\n--
HELP!\n\nI am trying to find software that will allow COM port redirection under\nWindows for Workgroups.  Can anyone out there make a suggestion or reccommend\nsomething.

IT'S BACK!!!!!!\n\nCongratulations, you've just discovered a very nasty, and very frequently\necountered, bug in the Word Setup program. Once you know what is wrong, it\nis quite easy to fix. Go into the Fonts dialog under Control Panel, and select\nthe two fonts MT Extra and Fences. Delete them, but only delete the list\nentries, not the disk files. Now select Add, and add the fonts MT Extra Plain\nand Fences Plain. Close the Font box, close Control Panel, and restart Word.\nEverything should be alright now.\n\nDoes anyone know if Microsoft has fixed this thing yet? They HAVE to know\nabout it by now, it's been so frequently reported.

I've been using Final from CODA for some time, but suddenly it stopped using \nmy fonts. I have a 386 PC with lots of disk space and memory, a Postscript \nlaser, Win3.1, Finale 2.0.1 and I recently installed ATM 2.0. I've been \nfiddling around with the Windows setup for some time, and when I needed to do \nsome work with Finale things didn't print properly. It might - and it might \nnot - have anything to do with the installation of ATM from 1.something to \n2.0, but I don't have the old ATM lying around anomore. \n\nThe most annoying problem was that the Petrucci font didn't print, which is a \nrather important font :-) \n\nI managed to get direct printing to work if I included OwnPS=0 in the \n[Finale] section of WIN.INI, but Compile PostScript Listing still doesn't \nwork; and it's those .EPS files I need. When I look at the .eps files \ngenerated the only font which appears there is Courier. I found out that if I \nmanually changed the Courier 24-point to Petrucci 24-point in the .EPS file \neverything worked ok, but I'd rather avoid that since I have a lot of songs \nto work with. \n\nAnd yes, in the Special/Font/Font names dialog box all the fonts I need are \nlisted, with the correct mapping between Finale, Screen and Printer fonts. \nFinale is obviously aware of the fonts since direct printing of a score works \nwell (that is, after I included OwnPS=0), and all my other Windows \napplications print Petrucci and the other fonts well. \n\nHas anyone encountered problems like this? \n\nWhat is the current version of Finale from Coda Music Software? I have 2.0.1\n\nAre the people at Coda available on Internet or X.400?\n\nI'd be grateful for all hints and help.                                -mats
Isn't this the point of "a better windows than Windoze". :).
If you are planning on using this on a regular basis, conncting the printer\nto file can become bothersome because Windows then asks you for the filename\nthat you want to create. I've found that putting a line in system.ini in the\nports section with just a path and filename works. The only problem is that\nif you send more than one job, the second one deletes the first.\n\n\nChris
I have a problem with the wallpaper on my desktop, in 1024x768x256 mode.  \nFor bitmap files bigger than about 512k (slightly less sometimes depending \non the exact dimensions), the wallpaper display is badly corrupted.  The \nrest of the desktop is fine.  For wallpaper bitmaps smaller than this, I \nhave no problem.  I have a friend who has an 800k bitmap which he has no \nproblems with, so it is possible.  It is also possible to display these\nbitmaps using CShow in 1024x768x256 mode with no problem, so the video \ncard is not at fault.\n\nHow can I remedy this?\n\nMy system:\n\n     386DX40, 4Mb ram.\n     DOS 6.0, Windows 3.1.\n     Oak 1Mb 077 Video card, 1024x768x256 mode, using supplied drivers.\n     Windows has a permanent 11,288kb swap file.\n\nPlease reply via e-mail, and _use the address in my .sig_, as our post \nsoftware always seems to mangle the address in the header.\n\n    Thanks,\n          Mazz.
I have just added a Panasonic KP-X1123 24pin dot matrix printer to a 386sx/25. I installed\nthe appropriate Windows 3.1 printer driver (i.e. one specifically for this printer) but I'm\nunable to persuade the poxy thing to print correctly. \n \nWhat appears to be happening is that the TrueType fonts don't get printed properly. My\nexperiments show that all graphic images (for example a line drawing from Corel Draw) print\nok. GraphicsWorkshop for Windows happily prints GIFs etc. MS Notepad and MS Write will\nprint correctly providing the font's in the text are printer fonts. \n \nWhen I print TrueType fonts, some lines appear to be printed in the wrong order. If I change \nthe text font to a printer font, the problem is eliminated.\n \nI have tried using printer drivers for printers which the KX-P1123 (snappy name) emulates,\nnamely Epsom LQ-850 and IBM ProPrinter X24 and the same problem occurs.\n \nIf there is some kind soul who can tell me just what the hell is going on, I would be most \nchuffed.
I replied:\n\n\nYou answered:\n\n\nI think it is important to clear up your first reply.  You gave the\nimpression that you should not use smartdrive with stacker.   You are\ncorrect re: caching the compressed drive.  However, as I understand it,\nyou can cache the uncompressed drive.  Thus if you have compressed your\ndisk C:, you will have a C and probably a D drive under stacker.  C being\nthe compressed disk (which is just a large file on D:) and D being the\nuncompressed disk.  You should only attempt to stack D:.  In fact, with\nWin 3.1 and smartdrv.exe, it seems smart enough to automatically default\nto stacking your A,B and D drives.

Danny...\n\nWhile working on my shareware toolbar, I found myself 'eating' resources,\nand a very wise person pointed me to the SDK, and specifically the debug\nkernel.

[munch]\n\n\n\n\n	[munch  following is reformatted]\n\n\n\n\n	I'd say that the massive crash problems are exceedingly rare.\n	Windows _itself_ almost never crashes, but it can be crashed by\n	an errant application (My personal favorite?  Any one of the Corel\n	3.0 programs).  On the other hand, I have had OS/2 crash randomly\n	a number of times, mostly just running it's own applications.\n\n	For instance.  Today I discovered a new one.  While I was downloading\n	with Procomm Plus For Windows (running seamless with the standard\n	VGA drivers on a run-o' da mill VGA card--640x480), I decided that\n	I wanted to edit a copy of a quote that I wanted to add to my \n	.finger.  But since I've learned not to really trust seamless, \n	I fired up a full screen WinOS/23.1 session.  Whoops, the download\n	finished while WinOS/2 was loading.  It had _just_ gotten\n	the pointer up, so I hit alt-escape to get back t the desktop\n	(I have a lot of fonts, so loading takes a good long while).\n	\n	Blam.  Screen trashed, Procomm hangs up.  Hm.  Well, I can sorta\n	see the mouse, so I clicked on the minimized WINOS/2 session \n	and got back my fullscreen Windows session (but the color were\n	off--red and green and yellow and brown instead of blues and greys).\n	So I closed this, and got back to the desktop (now fully restored).\n\n	PP+ was still sitting, window open, but it was no longer \n	"connected" to the com port--so I exited it (the normal way--\n	it told me I was still online and it would hang up, though it\n	was _already_ hung up).  Hm.  Well, load anothe--no, bad idea. \n	Shutdown and reboot.\n\n	Ok, refresh first.. Now, shutdown.  Yes, everything is closed...\n\n	Hm.  Nothing seems to be happening.  Let's see.. Ah, the \n	windows list still comes up.  OK, let's try shutdown again.\n\n	No go.  Huh.\n\n	Alright, wait 60 seconds to see if it's just running slow.\n\n	Hmm.  Still seems to be running OS/2.  Try shutdown again.\n	Nothing.  Oh well.  Reboot.  Enjoy the checkdisk time.\n  \n	In this case, a part of the OS crashed not only itself, but\n	OS/2 entirely (which isn't even smart enough to tell when it;s\n	been compromised, I guess).  In everyday (specifically _today_)\n	use.\n\n\n\n\n	That's the idea, anyway.  In truth, when a program crashes on \n	OS/2, it will bring the system down with it.  The programs that\n	would just GPF under Windows do the same under OS/2, but programs\n	that are fine under DOS and Windows bring OS/2 screaming to a halt,\n	task protection or no.  \n\n	For instance, I'm still wondering why print preview in a windowed\n	WP 5.1 (DOS) locks up my system.  It works fine under DOS or even in\n	a dos box under Windows 3.1.  (Admittedly, it doesn't crash if I run\n	WP51 full screen, but the first time this bug big me, it bit hard).\n\n\n\n\n\n	Please explain.  The only time I wait on anything under Windows is\n	when I'm copying or formatting a floppy, or when printing (and even\n	then, not long--I get 9 to 11 pages dumped to the printman per \n	minute, and can _still_ go do things--slowly--while it's doing \n	this--I've downloaded with PP+ @9600 while printing).\n\n\n\n\n\n	Not sure what you mean here.  OS/2 sees 16 megs, uses 5 or six\n	of these for it's own use (more if you want to count WinOS/2). \n	Windows sees 16 megs, uses 3 or 4 (more like 5 if you count the\n	disk cache as I am for OS/2) for itself.  If memory efficiency \n	were a big issue, PC GEOS would be the current king of the \n	Intel desktop.  \n\n\n\n\n	On the other hand.. I am finally able to say with some confidence\n	that both OS/2 and Windows have a bit of hardware sensitivity to\n	them.  For instance, the machine I am sitting at runs both fine, \n	while the machine next to me constantly locks up under Windows. \n	(But ran OS/2 without a hitch once I got it through a 5-crash \n	install).  On the whole, I'd say OS/2 is a whole lot more sensitive\n	than Windows, but there are (I suppose) machines that Windows\n	just doesn't like.  \n\n\n\n	\n	Wasn't this _Ferris_ Bueller?

I'm new to the MS-Windows world, and while a fairly competent\nSparc/Nextstep programmer, I have no idea which development kit\nto purchase.  I have heard good things about Borland C++ with\nApplication Frameworks and Microsoft's Visual C++ with SDK (?)\n\nWhat I would like is peoples comments on which package or set\nof tools they find useful or productive and why.  There are a\nplethora of other kits such as GUI toolkits available and I'm\nwondering which of these are best in terms of reliability, plug\nand go type operation, readability and so on.  I'd be interested\nin comments on these or anything else you may find useful.\n\nI will summarize to the net if there is enough interest.\n\n\nThanks,\nVeenu
: What exactly does the windows bitmap format look like? I mean, how is\n: the data stored: width, height, no. of colours, bitmap data? I couldn't\n: find anything in ths user manual, is there any other reference material\n: which would give me this information?
:     This may be an FAQ (if so, please direct me to the known answer) but I\n:     am getting frustrated and looking for help.\n: \n:     I am running Win 3.1 with NDW 2.2 on a 486sx with 8 meg of memory and a\n:     6 meg perm swap file and am getting exceedingly frustrated that my\n:     applications are not giving back system resources when I close them.\n:\nI've noticed this also.  The way it was explained to me is that Windows\ndoes not clear the upper memory blocks after a program is done.  Anyone\nout there know if this is why?
I'm waiting for June first to roll around when I can then get my \nhands on PC-Solaris...Unix for the Intel chip!  I know that there\nare many of other unix possibilities out there, but this includes\nthe Wabi (Windows API Binary Interface...I think) technology that wil\nrun Windows apps straight outta da box.  If this flies in enhanced mode,\nthen here's another contender to look out for in the corporate/education\nmarket.\n\nToo big and complex for the home front...Windows 4/Mac Sys7 will take those\nwhile Win4Wkgrps - NT - OS/2 will fight it out for the small-to-mid businesses.\n\nHowever, once the PowerPC becomes available (especially in laptop/notebook form)\nthen these will migrate into all markets....the ability to connect up to a unix\nmachine at work and yet still run Windows/Mac apps at home is going to be real\nattractive to alot of people!!!\n\nJust my predictions.\n\nMike

No.\n\n\nNo.\n\n\nNo, but...\n\nYou can allocate real static data within code segments!\nWhen you need more dynamic memory you can allocate data on the global heap.\n\nYou can forget most of what was written about memory management. Under 3.1\nyou have paged virtual memory. You can lock every block without hampering\nthe memory manager. You can use far pointer everytime without always Lock/\nUnlocking the memory block.\n\nAn besides: DLL's are mostly just disguised EXE's, that happen to be called\nby another task.\n\n\nKarl.

I don't think the question is:\n		"will OS/2 X.X run Windows Y.Y apps now?"\n\n	A more important question is:\n		"will subsequent OS/2 versions continue to run apps\n		from subsequent Windows versions in the future?"\n\n	Can it keep up?  Will a future OS/2 3.0 run Windows 4 apps?\n	OLE2 is very complex and is the sign of things to come.\n	After this fall, I believe IBM no longer has any rights to\n	view Microsoft code.  After that, the only way to maintain\n	some sort of compatibility is to reverse-engineer.  Would\n	you want to reverse-engineer an OLE2 application?
Personally, I'll be blasphemous and say that if Microsoft keeps doing\nwhat it does so well, I hope to see much harsher/stricter copyright\nand patent laws for computer algorithms, concepts, interfaces, and\nother intellectual properties to protect real innovators. I'd hate to\nbe one who actually does innovate, and then have Microsoft come in\nlike a huge vulture and use their brute mass (development staff,\nmarketing, etc) to get fat off of my innovation. I don't have all\nthat much sympathy for Apple's complaint against Microsoft, since\nthey just took the ideas from Xerox's PA Research Center when the\nFederal government forced Xerox to disclose their patents over\nantitrust fears. However, for other companies and individuals who\nhave a great idea, yet get it "borrowed" by larger corporations who\ncan afford to quickly bring it to market, without any licensing from\nthe original innovator, I feel much sympathy.\n\nLarry

It came from a reseller survey.\n \n\nI don't recall any FUD here.  Maybe an example?\n \n\nFor the most part, this newsgroup is "attack" oriented.  Microsoft has been\nattacked on anything ranging from the quality of our products, the\nintelligence of our people, the integrity of our business, etc.  ANYONE\nwould get defensive when being baselessly attacked.  We are human beings as\nwell.  You should expect a response when a claim that an employee might\nfeel is unwarranted is leveled.
Really when you come down to it who cares. I just hope MS keeps doing\nwhat they do best getting usable productive software to the masses.\nThx Dave L

The sensitivity is changed using the /S, /V, or /H parameter.  \nThe commands do the following:\n/V - vertical sensitivity\n/H - horizontal sensitivity\n/S - both \n\nFollow the parameter with a number from 1 to 100 (1 - slowest, 100-fastest).\nThe default is 50.  You can type the command "mouse /S75" right from the\nkeyboard or add it to autoexec.bat.

In Win 3.1, one may assign hot-keys for the program items within the\nProgram Manager. How about the Program Manager itself? Is there one\nalready, or is there some way to assign one?
(I have been having trouble posting this article from within tin for over\na week. If you do get multiple copies, my apologies.)\n\nHere is a challenge to Microsoft or Microsort Supporters to defend the\npathetic state of DOS 6 as an upgrade distribution -- it is a long story\nbut would make good reading for those who are interested in knowing the\npotential pitfalls of "upgrading" to DOS 6 that I have been able to\nnotice after only about a week of playing around with it.\n\nMy envorinment\n==============\n\nTI TravelMate 4000 WinSX (486SX/25) 4M Ram 120M Disk\nSystem BIOS version 1.03 05/21/92 by Texas Instruments\nCL-GD6420 VGA BIOS v 1.03 a1 by Cirrus Logic & Quadtel\nAdvance Power Manager BATTERY.PRO v b6.00 by Texas Instruments\nSmart Drive Cache (WIN3.1/DOS6) Parameters: 2048 1024 a- b-\nWindows Benchmark WinBench(tm) v 3.11 02/11/93 by ZD Labs\n\nAfter "updgrading" to DOS 6, I could not understand why certain things\nbecame so slow, especially after I decided to try 'dblspace'.  In the\nprocess of finding out why, I discovered some interesting things.\n\n\nDisk Performance with Double Space and Smart Drive\n==================================================\n\nWhile most things did not appear to slow down most of the time, certain\napplications appeared to run very much slower.  What was interesting is\nthat commands like 'chkdsk' and 'defrag' were running far too slowly to\nconsider them useful by any standards.  I suspected Double Space (DS)\nand decided to measure its impact on my system using WinBench(tm).\n\nThe Real Disk WINMARK of 20350 for the original system (as shipped from\nfactory with DOS 5 and Windowws 3.1) became 10718 when "upgraded" to\nDOS 6 with DS.  Thus there is an effective performance degradation of\nmore than 50 percent which did not really surprise me because I knew\nthat DS compression must cost something.\n\nSpecifically, for short sequential reads up to 512 bytes, DS actually\n*improves* transfer rates by about 10% (because CPU being faster than\nI/O, more CPU cycles needed for DS is more than compensated by savings\nin I/O cycles).  However, for all other cases, particularly large\nrandom writes, the transfers take up to three times as long.\n\nWhile the performance depends on the type of access (i.e random or\nsequential, small or large transfer units), on the average (based on\nWinBench's assumptions), the disk slows down to half its speed.\n\nThe tests alone, done in 'real mode' (see WinBench) and with smartdrv\non, do not say much except that it helps to put into those subjective\nstatements like 'there is no noticable difference in performance' or\neven that 'it will speed up disk access when you have a fast CPU and\nslow disk I/O'.\n\nThis explained why some applications ran markedly slower, but not why\n'chkdsk' and 'defrag' (the latter especially) too so long.\n\n\nDouble Space and Windows\n========================\n\nDBLSPACE will not run at all from within windows, not even if you\nwanted to only to get information, not modify anything, or for that\nmatter even check on its usage -- try "fasthelp dblspace" in a dos box\nwithin windows and you will see what I mean from the error message you\nget.  How narrow minded can a programer get, I wonder.\n\nYes, this information can be obtained through the mstools.dd add-on to\nfile manager, but this 'mstools' dll does not understand a compressed\nfloppy!  (Use the DOS 6 supplement utility to create a compressed\nfloppy if you dont know how to.)\n\n\nDOS 6 Defragmenter is incompatible with TI APM\n==============================================\n\nDefragmentation seemed to take too much time.  Even so, I waited\npatiently till it finished and then ran it again to just to confirm.\nThis confirmation 'dblspace /def' command for the 120M drive should take\nno more than 30 seconds (much faster on other defragmenters I have used)\nbut it took 12 minutes.\n\nI discovered that if I moved the mouse, defragmentation checking ran\nfaster (the % figure ticked more rapidly).  It dawned on me that this\nhad to do with TI's battery saver Advanced Power Management (APM)\nmodule which slows the clock down when it thinks that the CPU is idle,\nand it obviously thought DS defragmentation was an idle process!  After\ndisabling the TI's power saver, this operation took only 20 seconds.\n\n\nMicrosft programmers think TI4000 and Gateway NOMAD users are idiots\n====================================================================\n\nIn the readme.txt file, you can find the the following\n\n	Running Microsoft Backup with TI4000 and Gateway NOMAD computers\n	----------------------------------------------------------------\n	To avoid a conflict between the Turbo feature and Microsoft Backup\n	for Windows or MS-DOS, add a /L0 switch to the DEVICE command in\n	your CONFIG.SYS that loads the BATTERY.PRO file. Or, before you\n	run Microsoft Backup, type SETPOWER /L0 at the command prompt.\n\nIf you checked TI's manual on the /L0 option, you will realise that it\nmeans "disable all power saving features of your notebook".  Why would\nanyone want to run a driver disabled!  As I have found out, not only\ndoes TI's power management interfere with Microsoft Backup as the\nreadme.txt claims, but 'chkdsk' and 'dblspace' (and who knows what\nelse) are crippled by the TI's power saver.\n\nIt is obvious that there is not such thing as APM specifications.  If\nthere indeed is such a thing, then either Microsoft programmers or TI\nprogrammers dont know how to read these specifications.  You dont have\nto guess as to who are the idiots.\n\nBy the way, if you run the advance power management utility, POWER.EXE\n\n	Power Management Status\n	-----------------------\n	Setting =  ADV: MAX\n	CPU: idle 60% of time.\n\nThis figure of 60% seems to be the steady state value on my notebook\nwhen I am running nothing (windows with only program manager in\niconised form).  Does that mean that Windows takes up 40% of my CPU all\nfor itself, and that I have at best only 60% left for useful work?  Is\nsuch an overhead justified  (whether or not Windows is an operating\nsystem or just another user interface)?  (In DOS alone, it reports 99%\nidle time.)  Looks like Windows is a good example of busy waiting type\nof package that I like my students to study as the classical 'negative'\nexample of our times!\n\n\nMicrosoft programmers do not know batch programming\n===================================================\n\nI like to structure my startup script and thus have the equivalent of\naddpath statements like this:\n\n	set PATH=C:\DOS\n	...\n	set PATH=C:\ETC\BIN;%PATH%;C:\BIN\n	...\n	set PATH=C:\ETC\WINDOWS;%PATH%;C:\WINDOWS\n	...\n	set PATH=%PATH%;C:\BCC\BIN\n	...\n	set PATH=%PATH%;%MOUSE%\n\nEven though the new dos was installed in the same directory as the old\none (i.e. c:\dos), DOS 6 installation program modifes each and every\npath statement, and prepends C:\DOS to its value.  As a result, my\nresultant path has so many DOS's.\n\nIf the installation program wanted to remove the old DOS path, and add\nthe new DOS path, clearly it has to only scan for the path statement\ncontaing the old DOS directory and replace it by the new DOS path.\n(Even this should only be done if the new DOS is installed in a\ndirectory different from the old one being 'upgraded'.)\n\nInstead, the Microsoft programmer (if you can call this person one)\ndecided to meddle every path statement I had in the autoexec and\nprepend DOS to the value.  I wonder if Microsoft is so desparate that it\nwould not fire programmers who are incapable of the thought process.\n\nI started a thread on this when DOS 4 came up, and the Microsoft\nrepresentative in Singapore called me about this poster.  In fact he\nspecifically said his US counterparts saw the poster and relayed the\ninformation to him as he did not have access to internet.\n\nNow that has not changed one bit.  In fact, if you have a PATH statement\nwith %PATH% already in it, is it not obvious that the this statement\nshould not be touched for any reason?\n\nAs another example of the inability of Microsoft programmers to\nunderstand batch programming -- I had the mouse driver invoked as:\n\n	set MOUSE=C:\ETC\MOUSE\n	set PATH=%PATH%;%MOUSE%\n	loadhigh %MOUSE%\MOUSE.COM\n\nGuess what MEMMAKER did?  It replaced the last statement with\n\n	LH ... C:\ETC\MOUSE\MOUSE.COM\n\nWhy is it so difficult just to replace loadhigh with LH and its\nparameters, without touching the rest of the line, I do not understand.\n\n\nDOS 6 Software Quality\n======================\n\nDOS 6 is the only operating system I know, in which, under normal usage,\nyou end up creating a file that you cannot get rid of using of the\ncommands that come with it.\n\nI am deliberately being cryptic about this:  I challenge Microsoft to\nuse all its programmers to catch this bug and publish it.  If they dont\nwithin a week, I will post how you can create this "ghost" file.\n\nSurely if I can pick this bug without even looking for it after using a\nparticular command only twice, I am sure two dozen Microsoft (idiot)\nprogrammers randomly banging on their keyboards over a week could find\nit -- that is what I was told how Microsoft "tests the quality" of\ntheir products.\n\nI think it is funny that Microsoft has found ways to "test quality"\nwhen it is accepted in the industry that quality cannot be tested, but\ncan only be built into the product.  No wonder they cannot provide any\nform of guarantees on their products, not even a decent list of bugs\nthat will prevent scores of user from destroying their disks beyond\nrepair!\n\nAlso, if you run 'dblspace /def' often enough, repeatedly when the disk\nis fully defragmented, you may get errors, that was created by the\ndefragmenters.  I got my IO.SYS file size error and it got truncated\nwhen I did the chkdsk.  This happend only after five successive\ndefragmentation efforst after the first one supposedly did its job and\nwith no new file creation since.\n\nMicrosft, dont you dare reply to this poster on the network until you\nadmit that your DS has bugs, and are willing to let us know what we\nshould watch out for if we have already used DS.\n\nJaya
I'm writing a mail management system using Word for Windows 2.0 as\na front end. The user dials up a remote system and downloads a batch\nof mail as "foo.txt ." I've set up an AutoExec macro in Winword to load\n"foo.txt" OK, but subsequent invocations of the macro will of course\npose file name contention problems.\n\nWhat I'd really like to do is to create an AutoExit macro in Winword\nthat would move "foo.txt" to a specified directory, rename it using\nthe current date and time, and delete the original "foo.txt ."\n\nIn other words, "foo.txt" gets renamed as "5012300", say, on May 1\nat 23:00- the user gets a time-indexed backup of his mail files and\n"foo.txt" is freed up for the next packet of mail, since my AutoExec\nmacro points to it.\n\nMy main question is this: \n\nHow may one rename a file from within a WordBasic macro to include a \ntime/date variable in the new filename? \n\n\nThanks-\n\n=======================================================================\n  "If you ever reach total enlightenment while drinking a beer,\n   I bet it makes beer shoot out of your nose." -- Jack Handey
Here is the latest on relocating your help files to a server.  \nThe WinHelp() function, as I am told by MS, does search your path so \nrelocating MS windows helpfiles won't be a problem as long as you include\nthe path to where you move them to, however, if an application has \nhardcoded the path into their code so that when WinHelp is invoked it\nsearches the given path (i.e. WinHelp(hwnd, c:\amipro) for example) then\nWinHelp does not search your path and instead looks only to that directory\nwhere you have installed your software.\n\nI tested this out on a variety of software packages.  I moved all my \nhelpfiles to the drive z:\ and included this in the path statement.\nHere is the results for different software packages:\n\n\nNorton Desktop			Found Helpfiles\nWindows V3.1 for WorkGroups	Found Helpfiles\nWindows V3.1			Found Helpfiles\nMS Powerpoint V3.0		Found Helpfiles\nMS Word				Found Helpfiles\nMS Excel V4.0a			Did Not Find Helpfiles (strange)\nMS Foxpro V2.5 for Windows	Found Helpfiles\nLotus Amipro V3.0		Did Not Find Helpfiles\nProcomm Plus for Windows	Did Not Find Helpfiles\n\n\nI guess this is better than nothing but it would make sense to be able to \nspecify a global path for helpfiles.  \n\nIf anyone has any comments or If I can help anyone or if I left something\nout please let me know.\n\n		lhighley@gozer.idbsu.edu\n\nthanks for the help from everyone especially jagrant@emr1.emr.ca

I am running windows 3.1 in 386 enhanced mode.

I'm looking for some recommendations for screen capture programs.  A\ncouple of issues ago, PC Mag listed as Editor's Choices both Conversion\nArtist and Hijaak for Windows.  Anyone have any experience with those or\nsome others?  I'm trying to get an alpha manual in the next few days, and\nI'm not making much progress with the screen shots.  :^(\n \nI'm currently using DoDot and I'm about to burn it and the disks it rode\nit on.  It's got a lot of freaky bugs and *oversights* that are driving\nme crazy.  Tonight it decided that for any graphic it writes out as a\nTIFF file that's under a certain arbitrary size, it will swap the left\nand right sides of the picture [!].  Usually it confines itself to not\ncopying things to the clipboard (so I have to save and load pix for\nediting in paintbrush) or crashing every hour or so.\n \nThe one nice thing it has, though, is it's "dither" option.  You'd think\nthat this would turn colors into dots, which it does if you go from, say,\n256 colors to 16 colors.  But if you go from 256 or 16 colors to B&W,\nyou can set a threshold level for which colors turn to black and which\nturn to white.  For me, this is useful because I can turn light grays on\nbuttons to white, and the dark grays to black, and thereby preserve the\n3d-effect on buttons and other parts of the window.\n \nIf you understood my description :^) can you tell me if another (less\nbuggy!) program can do this as well?\n \nMuch thanks for any help.\n\n---------------------------------Signature---------------------------------\nDavid DelGreco                       | "What lies behind us and what lies\nTechnically a Writer                 | before us are tiny matters compared\ndelgreco@rahul.net                   | to what lies within us."\n                                     |         - Oliver Wendell Holmes
I have been using the JOIN command for many years now, mostly with good\nsuccess in duplicating unix-style file mounts.  You will hear lots of\npeople cursing JOIN because they confuse it with the dos APPEND command\n(a truely gnarly hack), but don't believe them.  You also will hear\npeople saying that Microsoft recommends that you not use JOIN.  But, in\nMicrosoft's Windows 4 Workgroups Resource toolkit, the following appears:\n\n  "JOIN, an MS-DOS utility, works fine with Windows for Workgroups 3.1 if\n  you do not change the state of the joined drives during a Windows for\n  Workgroups 3.1 session. This includes adding or removing joined drives\n  from within Windows for Workgroups. We recommend that you do not use\n  JOIN when running Windows Setup or Windows for Workgroups 3.1."\n\nWithin this caveat, JOIN appears to be valid under windows.  However, I\nhave found a couple of applications that don't deal well with filesystems\nthat have been "mounted" using join.\n\nIn particular, the worst offender is Word for Windows 2.0x.  It gets very\nconfused when you edit and then try to save a file on a joined drive. It\nwants to create the saved file as ~NNNNN.tmp in the current dir, then\ndelete the old file and rename the ~NNNNN.tmp file to the *.doc file.\n\nUnfortunately, WfW usually writes the ~NNNNN.tmp file in some idiotic\nplace other than the current directory (often in the root dir of the\njoined filesystem, but not always).  Then, after deleting the original\n*.doc file, it can't find the ~NNNNN.tmp file to rename it.  Unless you\nsearch your disk systems, the document is gone.\n\nI have also found subtle problems using the MKS toolkit from a DOS box\nwhen JOINed filesystems are present.  I used to join c:\temp with a 4meg\nramdisk, but MKS sometimes gets confused when doing an "ls" on the c:\temp\ndir, and misses some files in the temp dir.  (This is difficult to \nreproduce, but it goes away totally when JOIN is not used.)  I think\nthis is a Windows problem, rather than MKS's, since it works OK under raw\nDOS.\n\nSo, I would suggest that you can use JOIN, but be aware that it may not\nbe as robust you would like.\n\nWouldn't it be real great to "mount" network drives (i.e. Z:) under the main\nfile tree, rather than having all those darned drive letters? Unfortunately,\nJOIN won't let you do it.  There was talk on the net about a simple patch\nto let JOIN work on network drives, but I don't remember the source.\n\nIt's too bad the JOIN command is not better implemented, since it would\navoid using all those stupid drive letters.  I realize that MessDos was\nmeant for casual, even ignorant users, so "mounting" all the drives in\none file tree might be confusing. But, it looks like MS is going to carry\nthis over into windows NT (another OS meant for casual, even igorant \nusers -- NOT!).  With all it's old family system baggage, maybe MS needs\na recovery group so they can get on with life :-(.

Using a Windows 3.1 printer driver, I would like to "print to a file", with\noutput as a Postscript file.  Later, I would like to take this Postscript file\nto a machine with an attached Hewlett Packard 4M laser printer, and print the\ndocument at 600 dots per inch resolution.\n\nI would like to use this method to print from WordPerfect For Windows, and from\nan image processing program that can output images in Postscript.\n\nHere's the problem:  the Windows Postscript printer driver (pscript.drv)\ndoesn't allow me to specify 600 dpi.  In fact, the setup dialog for this driver\ndoes have a pull-down menu for "resolution", but the only choice given in the\nmenu is 300!  Not a really useful menu.\n\nAny ideas?

Word 2.0c doesn't show the period-centred character to indicate\nspaces if I use the TTFonts from CorelDraw.  Our editors need to\nbe able to see how many spaces are in text but the character \ndisplayed is a large hollow box.  They overlap each other and\ncharacters on each side, which is useless.\n\nI believe the character used by W4W is the period-centred (0183).\nThis character shows up with the windows Charmap display as the\nhollow box which tends to confirm this.  I have edited the corel\nfont with Fontmonger and changing the font graphics for the 0183\ncharacter makes no difference to the font output in Charmap or W4W.\nAltering the paragraph (0182) or cedilla (0184) does alter their font\ngraphics displayed however!!\n\nIs the W4W character used to indicate spaces the period-centred character? \n\nHas anyone been able to get this character displayed from a CorelDraw TTF?

< rest deleted >\n\nAs a followup to my post let me add that:\n\nI'm not really a Windows or Windows NT user, so please excuse my ignorance.\nHowever, I'm a developer at SAS Institute, and one component of the\napplication that I support is the ability to submit a (SAS) batch job from\nwithin an interactive SAS session.  The user site can enter their\nsite-specific "batch profile" into a dataset within our product, specifying\nthe pathname to the SAS executable, specifying site specific SAS options,\netc.  At run time certain variables are resolved, and the resolved file is\nwritten to an external ascii file.  Then I exit to the operating system and\nrun the job asynchronously, returning to the interactive session as soon as\nthe job is submitted.  The batch job then runs concurrently with the\ninteractive session.\n\nAs currently designed, the internal dataset has a record length of 80\ncharacters.  But, to run the batch job, the command to reinvoke SAS in\nbatch mode requires more than 80 characters.  Up til NT this has not been a\nproblem, since every job control/shell language up til NT (eg.\nMVS/CMS/VMS/UNIX/OS2) had a way to escape the CR/LF and enter a single\ncommand across multiple lines (OS/2 via their REXX language, which is\n*STANDARD* with OS/2).\n\nThe gist of all this is, since this application is for end-users, not\nwithin my company, I have to try to develop this process using native NT.\nSince my first posting I've learned that there are several third party\ncompanies that provide alternative script languages for Windows/Windows NT.\nAnd I'm sure a company that licenses our product would use that alternative\nscript language if they had it, but I can't develop under the assumption\nthat they have anything other than what comes with NT.\n\nI saw another post on this list (the subject was something like "Is vi\navailable for Windows?") in which someone said that vi, make, awk, and\n***ksh*** was available with Microsoft TOOLKIT.  What is that product?  Is\nit a separate product or part of Windows?  ksh would do what I need if I\ncould count on it at all NT sites.\n\nOne last question:  I've heard that NT has remote processing capabilities,\ni.e. I could shove this batch job off to a server machine and have it run\nthere.  If these are native NT commands rather than network specific\ncommands, this would also help me improve this process.  If you can comment\non these commands, I would appreciate it.\n\nThanks again for the help,\n\n--\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nScott Bass                           |  SAS Institute Inc.\nIntegrated Systems, A216, x6975      |  SAS Campus Drive, Cary, NC  27513-2414\nsasswb@k2.unx.sas.com                |  (919) 677-8001 x6975

If you can't wait, then you can ftp a\n6 months old beta version from ftp-os2.nmsu.edu, but this version is\nprobably a lot slower than the final product.\n\nWhen you do your test, please have in mind that a single tasking\nsystem will always be faster at doing one task.

He has an S3 LocalBus card like I do and when I \nloaded the S3 video driver in Windows for him, his mouse became jumpy too.  \nSeems like it is the S3 driver!  Is there any newer one than version 1.4 \nthat would solve this problem?  It is really bad.  I have to use the \nkeyboard instead sometimes!  The s3-w31.zip on cica is version 1.4 (which is \nthe same version that came with my card).\n\n\n---\nSean Eckton\nComputer Support Representative\nCollege of Fine Arts and Communications\n\nD-406 HFAC\nBrigham Young University\nProvo, UT  84602\n(801)378-3292

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nI think you're deliberatly overstating the requirements for OS/2.  \nConsidering that OS/2 is a multi-threaded true multitasking OS and\ntakes the place of DOS and Windows and more, I actually think the \nrequirements for OS/2 are very reasoable.  I also think that anyone\nusing Windows 3.1 without 8 megs of RAM, a 386-40, and 200 megs of\nhard drive space, is beating their head against a wall.  Those are\nalso legitimate requirements for OS/2.  In fact, the requirements \nfor Windows 3.1 and OS/2 are about equal.
I would expect the EISA board to be more than twice as fast as the ISA\nboard.  Not only are you moving data on a path twice as wide (at\nleast), but there is a difference in the number of clocks required for\nbus transactions between the two busses.  Most ISA boards require\nmultiple clocks per bus transaction -- typically this is around 3-4.\nEISA boards are suppose to be able to 'burst' at a 1:1 rate, so I\nwould expect performance to be 6x-8x that of an ISA card.  \n\nSo I guess, for me, the question is unanswered still.  I would expect\nhim to be able to see a 6x speed difference, and he apparently does\nnot.  \n\n-- \n"Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live\n in the real world."   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden

These are perfectly valid points and I agree. I'm glad we (MS) are starting\nto remedy this situation with DOS 6 (and it will get better in future \nreleases). You do need to be aware of some history, however. In the \nmid-late 80's, MS's point of view was that OS/2 was going to take over\nthe world and DOS would be phased out. As such, resources for DOS\n(and windows, for that matter) development were mostly redirected to OS/2.\nThe theory was to keep just enough resources on DOS to support people\nuntil they started using OS/2, so utilities and such for DOS fell by the \nwayside.\n\nThen Windows 3.0 hit the market, OS/2 flopped (1.x, at least...2.x seems to\nbe doing a little better, but its future is still cloudy), and people either\nstayed with their DOS (3.x and 4.x) apps or moved to Windows. About that\npoint in time, MS made its decision to drop OS/2 for DOS/Windows in the\nshort term and Windows/NT in the long term. DOS 5, much improved over DOS\n3.x and 4.x, was the first result of MS's refocussing on DOS and Windows.\nVersion 6 takes things somewhat further and I suspect future versions will\noffer even more in terms of "real" OS features (I work on NT and have no\nreal clue about what my coworkers over in DOSland are doing, but I do\nknow that there are a heck of a lot more of them than there were a\nfew years ago).\n\n	...Dave
Are you sure you want to do that?  If a win app locks up for some reason, \nctrl-alt-del may be the only way to kill the app and get back to Windows.  \nGranted it doesn't work all that often but it has come in handy on occasion.\nI consider it pretty carefully before I disabled that keystroke.  Just a \nthought.
Note that the filesize .dll is a part of the Windows Resource Kit. If\nyou install it (and you can download it from Cica), it will make the\nappropriate changes itself.\n\nkartik
om>\n\n\nCliff, do you know the difference between "Windows" and "Win-OS/2"?  Here's\na helpful hint:\n\nRunning "Windows" under OS/2 2.0 is only possible in real mode, in a DOS\nbox. Of course, this is only possible with Windows 3.0, since Windows 3.1\nno longer has a "real mode".\n\nThe ability to run standard mode, the ability to have an OS/2 <-> Windows\nclipboard, the ability to run seamless, and a few other things were all added\nby IBM to "Win-OS/2".\n\nNow, everybody who is running "Windows" in real-mode in a DOS box under OS/2\n2.x raise your hand. Finally, everybody who is running "Win-OS/2" under OS/2,\nraise YOUR hand.\n\nGet the picture, Cliff?
Doesn't MS do the same? (I.e., subsidize app development)\n\nI seem to remember someone at RPI who received an entire (expensive, to run\nNT) machine to develop for NT.  Free.  And that's just the small fry...
Very well indeed.  At home (a VL Bus version of the Graphics Pro) I can stretch\nan AVI window to 640x480 and it will continue to play back smoothly.  It drops\na few more frames but on most machines even attempting such a thing would mean\none frame update every 30 seconds.  An ISA Graphics+ was able to do "Zoom by\n2" without any perceptible performance penalty.  It is the best performance\nI've seen so far with the possible exception of an Intel Indeo board (which\nuses overlay so it doesn't have to move the decompressed data over the ISA\nbus at any point).
Source for "does not" comment: the CD-ROM and manuals for the March beta\n-- there *is* no X windows server there.\n\nWill there be?  Of course.  (Even) if Microsoft supplies one with NT,\nother vendors will no doubt port their's to NT.
I am setting up my DOS/UNIX box on a 116M IDE and a 412M SCSI drive\nand was wondering about the use of the (MS-DOS 5.0) JOIN command.  I\nlike the way it sets things up since I won't have to stick with the C:\nD: & E: (crap) that DOS enforces.  I like how it would mimic mount\npoints of UNIX filesystems.  I have heard that there were problems\nwith using it, or at least under older versions of DOS.  Please tell!
: Yes, a lot of what OS/2 2.0 has in common with OS/2 1.x was written by you\n: guys. However, many of the things that made OS/2 2.0 so much more successful\n: (Win-OS/2, Workplace Shell) than previous versions were IBM work.\n\nWin-OS/2 is IBM work? You make me laugh... Re-writing couple of thousands\nlines of code to make Windows compatible with your DPMI implementation does\nnot make the rest of Windows IBM work...

(stuff deleted)\n\nThis sounds like what happened to my HD a month ago. My HD was stacked\nwith Stacker v.2.0 (I run Dos5) Suddenly everything hung up, and most of\nthe HD got corrupted (directories changed into unreadable files with\n'funny' names). In other words: it is probably just the doubledisk part of\nDos6 that is troublesome. \n\nI now use Stacker v 3.0, and so far I have had no trouble. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Elisabeth Bull                       e_mail: eliza@swix.nvg.unit.no

I assumed he was referring to OS/2's 32-bit flat model addressing while DOS\n(and therefore Windows) use 20-bit segmented addressing.  As a programmer, I\nagree that segmentation unnecessarily complicates things.  It's annoying, too.\nBut when just a Windows user, I don't think about it much.  And, I doubt many\nother people think about it (or even care) when just writing a document,\ncalcing a spreadsheet, etc...It works and they get their work done.\n\nJust a neutral comment:\nIt's funny, I think, how arguments about Windows vs OS/2 sound so very\nsimilar to arguments about Atheism vs Christianity or something like that.\nIt's somehow very personal to people.  Convictions are irrational and\nthere's nothing wrong with that--it's just...interesting.

Hi.  One of my coworkers is having a very odd problem.  His mouse\nworks fine in DOS applications, if you load them from the C: prompt.\nUnder Windows, the mouse pointer is present, but does not move.  Even\nif you load a DOS app under Windows, the mouse doesn't work.\n\n  The computer is a Zeos 386SX-20 w/Diamond Speedstar VGA running MS\nDOS 5.0 and Windows 3.1.  Mouse driver is Microsoft's 8.2.  I've tried\nswitching the mouse from COM1 to COM2, I've tried a different mouse,\nI've reinstalled MOUSE.DRV, and I can't get the blamed thing to work.\nThe only difference between his system and mine (where the mouse works\nperfectly) is that he has an expansion card with an additional\nparallel and serial port.  Could that cause the problem? \n\n  Thanks in advance for any help.

Please do not do this!\n\nI don't know how the rest of you read news, but here's how I do it:  I\nsubscribe to an "outernet" system which allows me to dial up via modem and\ndownload e-mail and news articles automatically.  When someone posts a\nhuge attached binary file, I have no choice but to receive it along with\nall the other new articles in the groups I subscribe to.  I also pay for\nthe connect time, which is normally not a problem because I have a 14.4K\nmodem and each day's upload/download session takes only 5 minutes or so. \nToday's session, however, lasted about 25 minutes because of ROMAN.BMP. \nConsequently, it cost me about $3.00 extra just to receive a file that I\ndidn't want in the first place.\n\nIf you have cool bitmaps that you want to make available, there are other\nways to do it:  either upload the file to an ftp site (like\nftp.cica.indiana.edu, which has a complete Windows section) and tell\npeople how to get to it, or use one of the newsgroups like\nalt.binaries.pictures (or something like that), which are file archives\nrather than discussion groups.  Don't use discussion groups like this one\nto send out attached files, especially when they're 600K in size.

Well, I got  WINZIP from cica (don't know which version, but I think\nit's the latest, as this is not long ago), and I was initially imressed.\nBut here's the low-down:\n\nWINZIP is a *great* progra, *as long as you only unzip*.  It lets you\nvew files, unzip only selected files, and even puts the files in a\n/checkout directory, and creates a "checkout" .grp and group if you want\nto check the program out.  It even prompts for deletion of these on\nexit, if you didn;t like the program.\n\n*HOWEVER* (big however over here).  I have problems zipping.  I don't\nkonw specifics on this, or ammount of consistency, but sometimes when I\n"zip" a few files, or add a file to a .zip, dos will violate something\nor other, and I'll be asked (in a kind, micro$oft kind of way) to quit\nall applications, quit windows, and restart my computer.  I don't know\n(as I said) how consistent this is, as I jdont' zip much (and when I do,\nnow I just go to dos and use it from there, or just use the "run" cmd)\nbut I *do* know it's happened when I added files to an existing .zip\nfile, *and* when I created a new .zip file, using selected files only.\nI don't know if it's happened when I zip an entire dir.\n\nStill, it has a rather nice interface, and quite useful "unzip"ing\nfunctions.  If the above is fixed, I'll be the first to register the new\nver.  (as for now, a good old, "run-->unzip *.zip" will work.\n\n(PS> if a new ver *is* out that fixes these, please let me know).\n\npeace,\nMickey

Somebody help me cure my poor computer before I go insane!\n\nI have a problem with my 486 when running windows that appears\nto be memory-related.  It's actually not limited to windows, but\nthat's where it causes most of my problems.  Ths machine's 486DX33,\n8Meg RAM, 256Kcache, TRIDENT TVGA card, PAS-16 soundcard.\n\n1)  Windows runs REALLY, REALLY slow most of the time.  Slower than\non my old 386SX16.  Graphics draws/fills are slow, boots are slow,\napplications are sluggish, dialog boxes take up to 15 seconds to appear.\n(Note: some of my other non-windows applications do funny things that\nappear to be related.  Several run slow, my .mod player crashes the\nsystem etc..)\n\n2) Running Borland C++ 3.0 before running windows (or any of the other\nprograms)  COMPLETELY fixes the problem.  Windows will run as fast as\nI've ever seen it run, easily 10 times faster for graphics than\nwhen I don't run BC beforehand.\n\n3)  I don't have a memory manager installed in config.sys.  Installing\nemm386.exe does not fix the problem- it makes it worse.  After emm386 is\ninstalled, running BC will not fix the problem anymore.

This may be an FAQ (if so, please direct me to the known answer) but I\n    am getting frustrated and looking for help.\n\n    I am running Win 3.1 with NDW 2.2 on a 486sx with 8 meg of memory and a\n    6 meg perm swap file and am getting exceedingly frustrated that my\n    applications are not giving back system resources when I close them.\n\n    When I load windows I start with about 83% resources available but many\n    of the application programs I run regularly (WPWIN 5.2, VB 2.0, WINQVT\n    2.8, Lotus Organizer, etc.) seem to not return all their resources when\n    I exit them.  After a day or two of work I often find myself down under\n    50% of available resources even when I have no applications other than\n    my shell running.\n\n    I am aware this is a known problem; what I am looking for are some\n    suggestions of what I might do to mitigate it.  \n\n    1. What software is the culprit?  Win 3.1, NDW, my applications?  Are\n    some modes of Win 3.1 (standard, real, enhanced) better than others at\n    plugging this leak?\n\n    2. Are their system.ini switches i can set to help plug this leak?\n\n    3. Do people know of patches or third party software that help with\n    this?  Seems like increasing or better managing system resources is a\n    great market for a third party memory company like QEMM.\n\n    4. If I run Progman instead of NDW will the leak subside?  (I was\n    hoping that NDW 2.2 would have plugged this, but it seems no different\n    than 2.0 in how it deals with memory and resources.)\n\n    5. When I am writing VB code are there things I can do to make it less\n    likely my code will eat resources?\n\n    6. Any other suggestions that I don't know enough to ask for\n    specifically?\n\n    Thanks for your help.  As this is a common problem and I have seen only\n    a little discussion of it on the net there are probably others who\n    would like to read answers so please publish here rather than sending\n    me email.
I recently set Windows 3.1 up on my 486DX-33 VLB system, and I didn't\nnotice until last night that I don't have the 386 icon in my control\npanel.  I don't remember Windows setup asking me about 386 enhanced\nmode (whether I wanted it or not).  Now I've got a program that I \njust bought (Aldus Freehand 3.1) that is telling me that I should be\nrunning Windows in enhanced mode (looks like I'm running in standard\nmode).\n\nHow can switch to enhanced mode without the little icon thingie?  Are\nthere some issues involved with VESA LB systems which cause Windows\nto not want to give you enhanced mode? \n\nThanks for any help!!

Less than 1/2 of mailorder price!\n\nI have three libraries, all on CD, which cost me over two thousand dollars\nmail order.  They are all genuine, high quality EPS vector graphics (NOT just\nsome scans with a silly EPS wrapper!)  They are:\n\n1. Totem Graphics color EPS library (about 1400 color EPS images).\n   This costs a thousand bucks mailorder.  I rate this clip art as\n   high quality (much better than Dynamic Graphics clip art, SOTMC clip art,\n   etc., in my opinion), but I rate both the 3G library and the C.A.R.\n   library as higher.  Totem's art is ALL color -- whereas most of the other's\n   are B&W.  It's the best all-color library out there, in my opinion.\n\n2. C.A.R. Graphics library (haven't counted how many images, but you can\n   purchase the library on 48 floppies, to give you an idea of the size).\n   This costs about 4 hundred bucks mailorder.  I rate this clip art as\n   very high quality, but it's only B&W.\n\n3. 3G Graphics library (very popular in all the Mac mags).  This costs\n   about 4 hundred bucks mailorder.  I rate this clip art as very high quality\n   (got some awards in one of the major Mac mags, forgot which).  Some of\n   the images are color, but most are B&W.\n\nFor what it's worth, all three of the CD's are saved in multiple file formats.\nThey are readable on Mac's and PC's.  Additionally, Totem's will mount native-\nNeXT also, although the NeXT could just as easily mount either the Mac or PC\nfilesystems.  I've personally tested the CD's on all three machines (I've owned\nall three machines, although I sold my NeXT a few months ago).\n\nAlso, in my opinion, the 3G and C.A.R. libraries are the best in the business\n(and I've seen lots).  Also, Totem's is, in my opinion, the best all-color\nlibrary around, although I like 3G's color art better.\n\nI want $850 for everything.  Can ship certified check C.O.D., as well as\nVISA/MC charge.  If you pay by VISA/MC, I'll ship pre-paid in the continental U.S.\nIf I ship C.O.D., buyer pays freight and C.O.D. fee.\n\nReason for selling: No longer have DTP business.\n\nPlease respond via email or telephone, as I rarely check these news groups.\n\nNevin

It will certainly *help* to be able to run Windows and Dos apps but\nthe only way that Solaris or OS/2 or any other scheme is going to \nchallenge Microsoft is if they can somehow get the prices for Solaris\nor OS/2 or whatever apps, down to a DOS competitive level.

I've had the same problem with a Maxtor 7213A.  Turned off\nsmartdrive, 32 bit disk access, etc.  This same disk aborts\nNorton Speed Disk (NU 4.5), up to 8 times, requesting NDD to be\nrun when attempting to defrag drive.  At Some peoples' suggestion\nI reformatted my drive and reloaded DOS 5.0, Win 3.1 from\nscratch.  A few people found that installing 3.1 on top of 3.1\nbeta on top of 3.0 caused a similar problem, So I tried this\ndrastic solution.  When the problem reoccurred, I didn't have the\nbrains not to load 6.0 and dblespaced the drive.\n\nI get arround the annoyance by copying my *.grp files to *.gro.\nwhen I get the message, I run file manager and copy the\noffeniding group files from *.gro ove rthe *.grp.  Then I quit\nand restart windows(If the group is an often used important one.)\n\nThis really sucks.  But I'm pretty sure that the problem is the\ndrive (especially with the NSD problem).  I will be going with\nout over 66% of my memory after finals for 2 to 4 weeks, while\nthe guy I bought the disk and system from, goes over it and\neither fixes it or replaces the drive.  I can't wait to have a\nsystem that will run consistently with all hte goodies!
When I use File Manager's disk copy, I find that\nWindows (3.1) can read the whole 1.2MB disk at one time, \nbut only 98% of a 1.44 disk. It looks like a problem\nof memory. However, The PC has 4MB RAM. There should be some \nway to allocat more extended memory for disk copy. \nPlease advise me on this matter. Thanks in advance.
We are researching what support there is on various platforms for applications\nto use multi-byte characters (e.g., Japanese Kanji).

Well, this is *only* a guess:  If it goes by the "true" meaning of "bit\nmap", then it holds (x,y,c) where x pixel number in th ex-direction, y:\npixel-number in the y-dir, c: colour.

OK, now you are starting to define your criteria.\n\n\nI'm afraid that you haven't actually proved that.  You have shown that some\naspects of MSW3.1 are technically inferior to other systems.  As I said\nearlier, if this is all you are trying to say then it is trivially true.\nBut some aspects of MSW3.1 are actually technically superior to each of the\nother systems (resource requirements, performace, device support, printer\nsupport, GUI etc.)\n\n[ BTW, I'd love to see the studies which show that UNIX/X is as easy to\n  learn as Windows! ]\n\nBut I might even agree that, on balance, MSW3.1 is technically inferior to\nsome of the competition. This still does not prove your point.\n\n\nRange of available applications? Base OS cost? Cost of applications? Cost\nof hardware? Multi-platform support?  Quality of the after-sales service?\nAvailability of books/training materials? Support for visual and physical\nhandicaps?  Suitability for use in mobile computing? Quality of\nDocumentation?

From article <C68uBG.K2w@world.std.com>, by cfw@world.std.com (Christopher F Wroten):\nGood question.\nAnswer: The EISA bus does move 32 bits rather than ISA's 8/(16?)\n        But it still moves it at about the speed as the ISA bus.\n        I think that's either 8 or 10 mhz.\n        The local bus designs also move 32 bits like the EISA, but\n        they move the data at the cpu speed, up to 40 mhz.\n        So, on a 33mhz cpu, the local bus is moving 32bit data at\n        33 mhz, and the EISA is moving 32bit data at 8 or 10 mhz.\n        So the local bus should be 3 to 4 times faster than EISA on\n        a 33 mhz cpu.  EISA should be about two (maybe 3) times as\n        fast as ISA.\n\nThat's a very good question.  The EISA bus does have more advantages\nover the ISA bus than just it's width.  For example: more/better \ninterrupts and bus mastering.  But these other factors do not impact\n a video card very much.  They have more impact on file servers with \nmultiple hard drives, full-throttle network cards, cd-roms, etc.

RE: Irish/Gaelic TrueType Font wanted - synopsis\n\n \nMany thanks to those who responded to my question.  Unfortunately I have\nhad no luck in actually getting such a font, and a lot of people interested\nin geting one, and so I have decided to create my own truetype font fitting \nthat description.  This font is based on that used in the 1904 issue of \nDineen's dictionary and is typical of that found in Irish books from the \nearly part of the century.  This may take me some time to do (in my\nlimited spare time) but I'll make it available to anyone who is interested, \nwhen it is ready.\n\nThe responses I received are summerised below:\n\nKevin Donnelly (caoimhin@smo.ac.uk) mentioned that Michael Everson\n(everson@irlearn.ucd.ie) had developed some Clo/ Gaelach fonts\nfor the Macintosh and may be able to advise me.  I contacted Michael\nand he told me that he has three fonts available for the Macintosh, and\nthat he will eventually port them to the PC, but that he will be charging \nIR 100 (about $160) for each one.\n\npbryant@ukelele.GCR.COM mentioned that he uses two font that have a\n'nice Irish/Gaelic look to them'.  These are "Durrow" and "American \nUncial-Normal".  I don't know where you can get these but I don't\nthink that they have the effects I am looking for.\n\nFinally, rhiannon@netcom.com (Rhia) mentioned that the "Meath" font\nincluded in the Casady & Greene Fluent Laser Fonts 2 package\nis very much like what I was describing.  I faxed Casady & Greene for\ninfo but got no reply.\n\nSo that's it.  I'll post these newsgroups when I make my font available.

I really think you are comparing apples and oranges. Nobody disputes\nthat OS/2 has more big OS features. The question is Does an \nindividual need the power. The sales of Windows vs OS/2 answer that\nquestion. The next question is even if I did want to run OS/2\nand I had this big monster machine to run it on, is there a diverse\nset of applications to run on it that allow me to productviely do my\nwork. Go to your local computer store to answer this one.\nI think the comparison you need to be doing is NT vs OS2/2.1. This\nis where the new battle lines will be drawn. Windows 3.1 has won\nthe single user PC war the next one will be the client server\nwar and the entries are NT, OS2/2.1, UNIX and Netware 4.0.\nGranted these OS's will be eventually scaled down to be\nattractive to the single user PC and that will probably be phase II'\nof the war. Who wins only the marketplace will tell but it sure \nis fun watching and arguing about it tho.\nThx Dave L

Please research carefully.  Just because a fax modem behaves like\na printer on a "local" machine, doesn't guarantee functionality \nwhen a "local" machine has fax software printing to a "remotely\ninstalled" fax card.  I tried this with Workgroups and the \nfax software didn't like it at all.  Could have been WinFAX's\npeculiarisms but I don't think so.  A lot of special hardware\ninteraction takes place internally.  In my case, a FAX manager\nprogram merely "intercepts" the print job and spools it to\nit's own directory, not print manager's spool directory.  To\nsoftware, it appears the job was "printed".  Print Manager \nplays NO part in the handling of the actual process.\n\nPardon me if I've incorrectly assumed this is what you were\nup to.  A truely network-aware fax-modem will most likely be\nrequired, or a lot of weird setup and tinkering.
Why is Win 3.1 sometimes so finicky?\nI have a new DELL 486DX2/66mhz  8 megs RAM.\nWindows was working just great.  I had a Bus mouse and mother board problem.\nDELL replaced the mouse, gave me a newer mouse driver for windows\nand replaced the motherboard.  Just prior to this problem windows would\n]only load up every other time.  I would get the LOGO and either it would\ngo on into windows or LOCK UP.  This was very consistent EVERY OTHER TIME.\n\nNow with the new motherboard and all, it still does the same thing.\nThe computer is less than one month old.  At first it worked FINE!\nI can get into windows each time now with the   win/s command.\nThis forces Standard mode.  Things seem to run slower.  I mainly\nuse windows apps, but in standard mode there is no virtual mem.....\nplus it is slower.\n\nI re-loaded windows, it still does the same thing.  Should I first delete\neverything in all windows dir's?  I did not because I have so much \nadded in sub dir's etc.\n\nReally puzzling why ENHANCED MODE would not load each time but consistently\nevery other time.  Standard mode each time......\n\nANY THOUGHTS OR COMMENTS ???\n\nC-ya..... /\/\artin
A program called Mac-ette allows you to read Mac 3.5"\nhigh-density disks on a DOS machine. You can get the program from\nsimtel-20. I'm not sure of the directory location.
You don't, and never had to.  That's what enhanced shells are for.  Remember \n4DOS and NDOS?  I mean, come on, you can't expect DOS to cover everything \nfrom R1.0.  Microsoft has other projects to work on.\n\n\nI don't think they deliberately crippled the project.  On the other hand, it \nIS a technical achievement for what it does considering that it rides on\ntop of DOS.  I mean, you get a GUI with reasonable speed on a PC.  With \nXWindows running on top of Linux or something similar you're still gonna \nneed a fast processor.\n\n[Re: DOS's death]\n\nExcept for the people who use DOS programs, which means about 75% or more of \nthe business world.
Shareware is available from the net, magazines, distributors, clubs,\nfriends, and bulletin boards. I don't think people have any problems\ngetting hold of it.\n\nFill gaps in Dos? There's no need for many people - Dos 5 provides\nmore services than I need as it is. I just run Windows on top of it.\n\nBTW, my Windows must be an operating system - it provides a Disk\nOperating System that Dos can't access. (NFS...) :-)
Which translates to 7% not satisfied.  I don't think it's the awkward \nrecursive deletion that's bugging people, it certainly isn't the nice Windows \ninterfaces for new DOS accessories (CPAV, defrager, undelete).\n\n	As far as I've noticed, it's DoubleSpace crashes.\n\nFrankly, the fairly high rates of DoubleSpace crashes I've heard of surprises \nme!  I figured that since the OS is presumably aware of DoubleSpace, it is \nless likely to crash (unlike Stacker, which fools the OS... but DO is gullible \nanyway :).  DOS 6 _is_ aware of DoubleSpace isn't it?\n\nAnyway, good job on DOS 5, and DOS 6 is good for new users.  Just beware the \ndoublespace!\n\nRob\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRmohns@vax.clarku.edu |  Rob Mohns  |  Annoy Rush Limbaugh.

I have a 486/33 VLB machine, with a Wang 96/24 fax/modem.\nWhen using the windows terminal application, the only way\nI can get it to 'see' the modem is to change it to COM2,\nthen go back and change it to COM4.  Then it works fine.\n(I have it set to COM4 as the port to use)  I don't have\nanything plugged into COM2, and I've looked over the manual\nfor all it's worth, but what am I missing?  The modem is \njumpered for COM4/IRQ3, which I understand means I can't\nuse the second serial port and the modem at the same time,\nbut I'm not using the second serial port anyway.\nAlso, when using Procomm + for DOS, it always sees the modem\nand dials, but doesn't always connect me when the other end\nanswers.  Don't know if that helps any.\n\nThanks,

Special thanks to Brian Evans of Georgia Tech  \nfor all the help.  \n\n--> FTP\n\n     COSY_PAK is available by anonymous `ftp' from \nmishna.esys.cwru.edu (Internet No. 129.22.40.23). A sample ftp session \nis given at the end of this file.\n\n**********************************************************************\n\n--> Changes in Version 0.9 (update from v0.81 to v0.9)\n\n	In this version, we have revised COSY_PAK to take advantage of \nthe more robust signal processing functions available in Mathematica v2.1.  \nSince Mathematica 2.1 provides a better  and  working \nLaplaceTransform and InverseLaplaceTransform functions than \nMathematica v2.0 did, we adopted them. This has made COSY_PAK \nsmaller. Thus Brian Evans' Signal Processing packages that supported \nthe LaplaceTransform  and InverseLaplaceTransform functions in the \nCOSY_PAK v0.81 are no longer needed directly by COSY_PAK v0.9. For \npower users who  use Signal Processing we still recommend the use of the very  \nfine  Brian Evans package on Signal Processing (available at \nthe anonymous  ftp site gauss.eedsp.gatech.edu  or  IP # 130.207.226.24).  On  \nthe  downside, the disadvantage of this update \ncan be that Mathematica 2.1 requires more runtime resources than its \nprevious version. \n\n\n***********************************************************************	\n--> For Mathematica 2.0 users\n	\n	We have included the LaplaceTransform package from Mathematica 2.1 in  \nthe directory `For_2.0'. Please move all files and directory under For_2.0 into  \nthe Calculus directory under Mathematica Packages directory. \n\n**************************************************************************\n	    \n--> Introduction\n   \n    This is an unsupported release of COSY_PAK - a COntrol SYstems \nanalysis PAcKage for symbolic control systems analysis using \nMathematica 2.1. Classical control systems analysis and design methods and some  \nmodern control systems methods have been implemented in this package. \n    \n    This package and the attendant notebooks were developed on a \nNeXT (TM) computer (a UNIX based workstation). They have been \nused as a supplementary teaching aid along with  standard control \nengineering texts (Ogata [1991], Phillips and Harbor [1991]) for \nundergraduate courses in `Control Engineering I' taught at the Systems \nEngineering Department of CWRU. In addition to the NeXT, they have \nalso been tested successfully on Apple Macintosh computers (TM), and, \nIBM PC's (TM) running MS Windows(TM). We would be very much interested \nto hear from you if you or anybody you know uses this software on \nplatforms not mentioned above. IBM users however will have to \nevaluate the notebooks first to visualize the graphics.\n\n    Once installed (see below for instructions), this  collection  of  \nMathematica  packages  can be loaded by any user. Bundled with the \npackages are many notebooks ("COSY_Notes") which demonstrate  \nthe functionality of these packages. The notebooks follow a plan of \nmany fine, standard, undergraduate Control Engineering text books \nlisted in the references. Examples used in these notebooks have \nbeen collected from the various references given at the end of this \nfile. The contents of the notebooks in the "COSY_Notes" directory are \ngiven below.\n   \n ----------- Begin "COSY_Notes" Contents -----------\n \n NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 01_Introduction.ma\n CHAPTER 1: Introduction to Control Systems\n	\n	Sections:  \n	     Analyticity\n	     Poles and Zeros\n	     Signals\n	     Forward Laplace Transforms\n	     Inverse Laplace Transforms\n	     Differential Equation With Zero-Valued Initial Conditions\n	     Differential Equation With Initial Conditions\n	     	     \n -----------\n \n NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 02_Math_Models.ma\n CHAPTER 2: Mathematical Modeling of Dynamic Systems\n\n 	 Sections:  \n	      ODE to State Space  \n	      Linearization of a Nonlinear System of Equations  \n	      State Space to Transfer Function\n		     \n -----------\n \n NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 03_*_Transient_Response.ma\n CHAPTER 3: Transient-Response Analysis  \n            (Chapter split into three sub notebooks because of file\n	     size)\n\n	 NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 03_1_Transient_Response.ma\n            \n	    Sections :       \n	      Time Response Analysis  \n	      First order System  \n	      Second Order System  \n	      Third Order and Higher Order Systems\n	      \n         NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 03_2_Transient_Response.ma\n            \n	    Sections  :        	      \n	      First Order System (Step Response vs. Time Const)  \n	      \n	      \n         NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 03_3_Transient_Response.ma\n            \n	    Sections  :\n	      Second Order System (Step Response vs. Damping Ratio)  \n	      \n	            \n -----------\n\n NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 04_Steady_State_Response.ma\n CHAPTER 4: Steady-State Response\n \n         Sections:	      \n	      Routh's Stability \n 	      Steady-State Error Analysis\n                \n -----------\n		\n NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 05_Root_Locus.ma\n CHAPTER 5: Root-Locus Analysis\n\n -----------\n \n NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 06_Freq_Response.ma\n CHAPTER 6: Frequency-Response Analysis\n\n         Sections:\n	      Bode Plot Analysis  \n	      Magnitude vs. Phase Plot (Nichols Plot)\n	      Polar Plot  \n	      Nyquist Plot  \n	      Combined Example\n	      \n -----------\n \n NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 07_State_Space.ma\n CHAPTER 7: State Space Methods\n\n         Sections:\n	      Introduction\n	      State Transition Matrix\n	      Controllability\n	      Observability\n	      Output Controllability\n	      Pole Placement Design \n	      Observer Design\n	      Time Response Using State Space Methods\n\n \n ----------- End Notebook Contents -----------\n \n\n--> Compressed Files\n\n        The files that contain  a  complete set of the COSY_PAK v0.9\npackages and Notebooks for Mathematica are:\n\n COSY_PAK_09.tar.Z     		compressed tar file for Unix systems\n	\n COSY_PAK_09.sit.hqx     	compressed sit file for Macintosh \n 				systems and encoded by BinHex 4.0 \n				format (requires the   shareware\n				 Stuffit file v 1.5.1 or higher). \n	\n COSY_PAK_IBM_09.zip    	zip file for the IBM PC running MS-DOS\n    \n     Once expanded the Mathematica files can also be used on \nMacintosh / IBM PC / Unix systems also.\n\n\n--> Installation of COSY_PAK\n\n o In UNIX Command line type the following command:\n\n      zcat COSY_PAK_09.tar.Z | tar xvf -\n\n o In Macintosh open the .sit.hqx file using the shareware\n    Stuffit v 1.5.1 or higher.\n  \n o In IBM Command line type the following command:\n\n      pkunzip -o -d COSY_PAK_IBM_09.zip\n\nNOTE: This .zip file was zipped by zip utility v2.0. You must use \npkunzip version 2.0 or  higher to unzip it.  IBM PC's may limit the \ndirectory name characters to eight. In that event type "pkunzip -o -d \nCOSY_PAK.zip.  You can also unzip the COSY_PAK_IBM_09.zip file on any \nUnix machine if you have unzip utility on it.\n\n\n     Uncompressing and untarring "COSY_PAK_09.tar.Z" or unzipping \n"COSY_PAK_IBM_09.zip" will create a directory called "COSY_PAK".\n         	\nOnce the files are expanded you should see a single directory \n"COSY_PAK" containing the following three files, four \nsub-directories and their contents:\n\nSUB-DIRECTORIES in "COSY_PAK":  \n  COSYPAK    - contains control tool box packages \n  MANUAL     - COSY_PAK manual in .ps, .rtf, .txt, and .wn formats. \n  COSY_Notes - contains notebooks \n  For_2.0    - contains Laplace transform package from Mathematica 2.1\n  		For Mathematica 2.0 users.	 \n    		\nFILES in directory "COSYPAK":\n  chap1.m   chap2.m   chap3.m  chap4.m  chap5.m   chap6.m  chap7.m\n	\nFILES in directory "COSY_Notes":\n	01_Introduction.ma	  \n	02_Math_Model.ma\n	03_1_Transient_Response.ma   \n	03_2_Transient_Response.ma   \n	03_3_Transient_Response.ma   \n	04_Steady_State_Response.ma\n	05_Root_Locus.ma	  \n	06_Freq_Response.ma \n	07_State_Space.ma         \n	\nFILES in directory "For_2.0":\n	LaplaceTransform.m     DiracDelta.m	\n	SUB-DIRECTORIES in "COSY_PAK":	Common\n	FILES in directory "Common":  Support.m\n\n********************* Important ********************	\n\n	The notebook example files(.ma files) will be under the \n"COSY_Notes" directory.  To use the notebooks, move the directory `COSYPAK' to  \na \ndirectory that  Mathematica can recognize :\n	\n        /LocalLibrary/Mathematica/Packages     	on a UNIX machine,\n        MY_HardDisk:Mathematica:Packages   	on an Apple Macintosh,\n        c:\winmath\packages                  	on an IBM PC.\n\n	At the beginning of the "Initialization" cell of each notebook \nin  "COSY_Notes" directory, we list the example about how to make \nMathematica identify the directory:\n\n	(* Initialization of Path *)\n\n	(* Example For a UNIX machine  (Default) *) \n	(*\n	$Path=Join[$Path,\n	{"/LocalLibrary/Mathematica/Packages"}];\n	*)\n	\n	(* Example For an Apple Macintosh  *) \n	(*\n	$Path=Join[$Path,\n	{"MY_HardDisk:Mathematica:Packages"}];\n	*)\n	\n	(* Example For IBM PC 	\n	 *)\n	(*\n	$Path=Join[$Path,	\n	 {"c:\winmath\packages"}];	\n	*)	\n\nChange the pathname according to your machine by removing the \nMathematica comment sign `(*' and `)*' before and after `$Path' \nsetting.\n\n	This command makes Mathematica recognize the directory\n\n        /LocalLibrary/Mathematica/Packages     	on a UNIX machine\n        MY_HardDisk:Mathematica:Packages   	on a Apple Macintosh\n        c:\winmath\packages                	on an IBM PC\n\n\n--> Mathematica 2.0 users\n	\n	We include the LaplaceTransform package from Mathematica 2.1 in \nthe directory For_2.0.

InfoWorld (April 26, 1993 issue) has two articles about problems with DOS\n6.  A 'Second Look' article calls it a 'loaded gun' and that people\nshould exercise extreme caution if they decide to use it.  The point out\nthat DoubleSpace and MemMaker are both problem areas that will cause a\nnumber of folks problems.\n\nMS's response was to the effect that there had been no problems reported\nthat they could duplicate (probably are not trying too hard).
I have written the file manager HFM, wich has two windows which compare\nthe files in two directorys to find out wether there are equal or \nsimilar files. The 7 most important operations, copy, move, delete,\nshow the file, start a progam, navigate in the directory tree can be\ninvoked by dragging a directory entry with the mouse. This is very\nconvenient, because the selection of the file and the operation to\nbe performed, occur in one move. For bitmap graphic viewing the\nprogram vpic can be integrated, for spreadsheat and database files\nI use the view program from PCTOOLS 7.1. HFM can be configured to\nuse arbitrary viewers to show special data formats. It does\nalso present archives from pkzip etc. as simulated subdirectorys.\nThis filemanager has a somewhat non standart user interface, but\nit is very convienient to use and is the prefered file manager \nin several labs in our university. \nThe drawback of this filemanager is, it's still a dos program and\nthe development of a windows version has not yet begun. I use the\nprogram package run18.zip, where run tells its windows companion\nsched.exe which windows program should be started. In this way you\ncan start a windows program from a dosbox. The new version 3.19\n(to be released soon) includes a new command for automating this\nwindows program start.\nFTP archives for the mentioned programs (all these archives have several\nmirror sites)\nSimtel oak.oakland.edu 141.210.10.117\n/filutl/hfm318.zip\n/gif/vpic60e.zip\nGarbo garbo.uwasa.fi 128.214.87.1\n/dirutil/hfm318.zip\nCICA ftp.cica.indiana.edu 129.79.20.17 \n/util/run18.zip\n-

You CAN print to a file from an HP (or any other printer).  Just go into\nthe Printers section of your Control Panel.  Select the printer you want\nto re-direct to a file, and click on Connect.  Then choose :FILE as the\nport to connect the printer to.\n\nWhen you print from any application to that printer, Windows will prompt\nyou for a file name for the file into which you want to capture the\nprintout.\n\nIt's pretty easy.\n\nGood luck!
Hello Netters\n\n	I recenlty aquired enough money to purchase a laser printer.\nThe other day, I bought the COMPUTER SHOPPER mag.  I was looking through\nprinter review section and noticed the WINPRINTER800.  The machine is \nincredibly low priced for all the features it has \n\n			800 dpi!\n			8Meg RAM\n			Postscript compatable\n			envelope printing\n\nMy question is does anyone have one of these or know why the price is so\ncheap?  I would appricaiate it if someone would pass on their knowledge\non this subject.  Thanks alot!\n\n					Dave\n------------------------------\nDonuts are a girls best friend
I'm working at a workstation which is usually attached to a Novell\nnetwork (using shell version 3.22, I think). The workstation, a 386, was set\nup to run Windows 3.0 with the network about a year ago. Needless to say,\nI'd like to upgrade it to Windows 3.1, and have it work with the network.\n\n	Basically, the Windows files'd be on the local hard drive, but\nseveral DOS applications, like Word Perfect, will be on the network. I'd\nmainly want Windows to access the network drives, the network printers, and\nperhaps handle some network functions as well. If I could multitask the DOS\napps whose executables are on the network, that'd be great, but I could live\nwithout it.\n\n	Eventually, I'd like to get a few other 486s in the office working\nwith the network and Windows 3.1 as well. (However, most of the terminals\nare 286s, which leaves the network pretty much DOS-bound, and I guess that\nleaves out Windows for Workgroups.) And in the future, maybe there'd be\nNorton desktop, but that's gettingahead of myself.\n\n	As you can guess, I've never done anything like this before. I've\nread through the networks material that came with Windows, but still, I'd\nlike to know if anyone out there has any experience in such an area.\n\n	Please reply by Email. I don't scan these newsgroups often.\n\n	Thanks for any replies.\n\n\nBrian "Rev. P-K" Siano                                  revpk@cellar.org

I have a 486 sx 25 and I recently added a SCSI drive to my system using an  \nAdaptec 1522 (non busmastering) controller. Yesterday I ran coretest to  \nfind out drive performance and these are the values I got\n\nSeagate 106 Meg: 875.1kb/Sec	14.5ms avg seek   3.7ms track to track \nQuantum 400 Meg SCSI: 991.2 Kb/sec  12.7 avg seek 3.6 track to track.\n\nFirst off all are these good results? I don't know what typical values  \nare.\n\nWhat I'm wondering now is the following. My swap file is currently on the  \nIDE. I could move it to the SCSI which is 13% faster, but then I would not  \nbe able to use 32-bit access which might actuall make it slower. So on  \nwhich drive should I put my swap file to get best results? Is there a swap  \nfile speed test program out there?\n\nFinally, I also ran the above tests with the ASPI2DOS driver loaded and I  \ngot no difference whatsoever in performance. Is there any reason at all  \nwhy I should load this driver?\n\nThanks in advance, I will post a summary if I get enough responses.

This is why they were created in the first\nplace - to filter out all the crap from the newsgroups that might\ncontain real information.\n\n				-Phil
Recently, Windows has starting giving me the error "Sound Blaster Pro:\nRequires newer version of Windows 3.1."  It has worked correctly for a long\ntime, and don't know what the problem could be.  Thanks!\n\n\n--
Hello,\n\nrecently I noticed there is a directory named "DiskImage" in my disk.  I didn't\nnotice it before and I wonder if while installing an application an image of \nthe disk was created, or if Win3.1 automatically created a backup of its files.\nI couldn't find any documentation on the diskimage utility; having an image of\nthe disk is taking *a lot* of disk space.  Does anybody know if this is just \nsomething the people who installed Win3.1 did or it is a backup mechanism?\n\nThanks,\n\nAnibal\n-- \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAnibal Mayorga              |  21 Wenark Dr #7        | W: (302) 831-8704 \nmayorga@cis.udel.edu        |  Newark, DE 19713       | H: (302) 453-0309
It has been done, but the other companies don't have the marketing\nbudgets that MS do.  4DOS, for instance, is everything that\nCOMMAND.COM should have been (but never could be under MS).  Those who\nuse it usually find it more addictive than crack cocaine.  But they\nhave to rely on word of mouth for sales.  It seems to have worked\npretty good so far, but your corporate weenie manager type usually\nlikes to see a big glossy ad in PC Magazine.  That's okay, marketing\nisn't a fundamental human right, but they've got a product that's\nsuperior to the DOS command interpreter in every way.  They have a lot\nmore to be proud of than MS does.  If MS really gave a damn, they\ncould duplicate it, buy it outright (they've got the money), or even\nuse the old ruse of sending engineers out to help them with\ncompatability issues and absconding with the technology.\n\nDOS is a mediocre product at a cheap price backed up by top notch\nmarketing and vendor agreements.  The "mediocre" was excusable in the\nearly days when it was someone else's hack, but they've had ten years\nto play with it.\n\nAn interesting thought on that: Most MS products that I'm aware of in\nthe last few years allow you to access the names of the designers and\nprogrammers through easter egg screens, including Windows, or at least\nhave the names buried in the files.  Is there such a thing in DOS 5.0\nand 6.0, or are they too ashamed to have their names on it?
<much deleted>\n\nSounds like a memory conflict problem, which can cause truly weird symptoms \nlike these. Call Dell tech support (or better, post to them on CSERVE if you\nhave an account) and get the memory range(s) used by video RAM on your\nmachine. The block windows from using those ranges with an\nEMMEXCLUDE= statement in the 386Enh section of SYSTEM.INI. You probably\nshould include a statement excluding the same range from EMM386 or whatever\nmemory manager you use in CONFIG.SYS.
Everyone seems to think that this man's mouse problem is mechanical (its dirty)\n I have been having a similar problem with my mouse, and it only occurs when ru\nnning windows and therefore cannot be mechanical in nature. I'm running a mouse\n systems compatible mouse on a 486 66 DX2 with a trident 1 meg video card and a\nm experienceing similar jumpiness as well as strange font subsitutions and mous\ne traces left on screen and windows gpf errors. HELP!!!
Hmmm.  I gave two examples which matched your objective criteria, and your\nresponse was some subjective claptrap about them being 'lame'.  You never\ndid counter the fact that those examples fit your objective criteria.\n\nOne wonders who's playing semantic games, here.\n\n\n-- \nRick Schaut\nUUCP:...{uunet | uw-beaver}!microsoft!richs
Autodesk Animator is a good tool. The one I like is Show Partner/FX. If\nyou want it, I could give a copy to you. I did a lot of advertising with it -\nit lets you create both graphics (ANY resolution) and text frames, run it all\nas a "film", you can make choices and include music - I guess that's just\nwhat you need. If you're really interested, email me.
While the 64K limit may not be _necessary_ limitation, they probably fall\nwithin the category of 'reasonable' limitations.  If you find yourself\ntrying to allocate an edit control for more than 64K of text, it's probably\ntime take a good look at your program's design.\n\n\nIn what way is 8192 a 'small' number?  It seems to me that you'd hit the\nwall in many other ways before you'd hit the systemwide limit on global\nhandles, unless, of course, you're abusing GlobalAlloc.\n\n\nAnd _please_ don't try to tell me that it's impossible to abuse the\nresources available under other operating systems.  All systems have\nlimits.  The question is whether or not the limits are _reasonable_.  So\nfar, you haven't offered a single argument which suggests that Windows'\nlimits are any less reasonable than limits in other systems.\n\n\n-- \nRick Schaut\nUUCP:...{uunet | uw-beaver}!microsoft!richs
Hi there,\n\n    I plan on upgrading my monitor and video card to 1280x1024. I have\n    a DX2/66 ISA (no local bus) system. I would appreciate if anyone can \n    drop me an email of your experience with high-resolution\n    video board/monitor. Thanks.\n\n-Ming T. Lin
Hello Cliff \n\nMany people on the internet (like us) have to pay for\nevery byte of data passed through subscribed news groups.\n\nBitmaps are large. Bitmaps cost us a lot of money. There are\nspecial news-groups for bitmaps because of this. We don't\nsubscribe to them. Put you bitmaps in the right place.\nRead one of the FAQ guides in the newuser groups and it\nwill tell you all about bitmaps and the thousands of\nestablishments like mine that you have just cost money.\n\nSome of them have very limited budgets.\n\nGo away.\n\nP.S. This is a flame ;-)\nP.P.S You distribution of "usa" didn't work.\n\nKenB

Is there a hot-key for the Windows 3.1 screen saver utility?  If not, is\nthere an easy way to create one?  The reason that I need one is that my\ndad's company is anal retentive about leaving a computer while the\ninformation can be accessed so the employees are not allowed to walk away\nfrom the computer until the screen saver kicks in (as if that is terribly\nsecure).  Also, the system manager won't let any software be added so \nanother program such as LOCK32.ZIP from cica or a different screen saver\nis out.\n\nThanks for any and all help.
Please Help if you can. Whenever I try to run windows useing the 16\nmillion color mode with the drivers supplyed with my Diamond Stelth 24x\nIt will lock up requireing a full system reset to break out. The drivers\nthat I have for windows are V.1.00 for windows 3.1 (which IS the version\nof windows I am useing)\n\nMy Setup\n---------\n386DX40 128KCach\n4 Megs of ram\n14" SVGA touch Monitor non-interlaced\nAMI Bios\n\nAny and all help would be apreciated, The card seems to work fine in other\nmodes, I usually run windows in 800x600 mode and probs at all, so I am\nhopeing it is a driver and not a card problem.
I received my Graphite VL on Thursday, and I've had a little bit of \nexperience with it now.  In general, it feels *FAST*, although this\nis the first VLB card that I have tried.  Still, the results are \nimpressive.\n\nWith my 486DX2/66 w/16 MB, running at 1024x768/256, I've had the following\nWinTach 1.0 results:\n\n\nCard				WP	CAD	Spread	Paint	Overall\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nATI Graphics Ultra		13.5	14.5	19.1	25.0	18.0\nATI Ultra+ (no aperture)	11.2	13.8	10.7	20.9	14.1\nHercules Graphite VL		16.1	67.8	41.4	52.8	44.5\n\nUnfortunately I don't have the numbers here, but the ATI Ultra Pro VLB\nhad an overall WinTach score of about 26.  The Ultra Pro was nearly as\nfast in text handling, but was blown away in the CAD and Paint tests.\n\nAs an additional test, we hand-timed a complex CorelDraw! slide resize/-\nredraw times.  There was no swapping, but I'd expect there is a fairly\nheavy load on the CPU.  The Graphite redraw times averaged about 10.2\nseconds, with ATI Ultra Pro at 12.0.  This jives with Steve Gibson's\ncontention that the ISA Graphite is faster than an ATI UP on his complex\nMicrografx Draw document.\n\nSo far, I'm *very* impressed.  The drivers look solid, and the card flies.\nThe installation and utilities are different, but comparable to ATI's.  And\nI didn't have to wait for Build 59 for some reliability...  With Hercules'\nsoftware developer special, you can get an evaluation copy of the card for\njust $225 (or $200 for the ISA version).  Call 800-532-0600 if you want to\ngive it a try -- I'm a happy customer now!
Ok, I just got a new 486/66 16 Mb, with a ATI Ultra pro and I can't get\ninto windows. It says that I need more memory available, but I have 15mb\nogf extended mem & 512k of conventionnal. I have disabled my memory aperture\nbecause it didn't find any "FREE" memory, but it still gave me a message that\nthe memory aperture will conflict with system memory. I think that's why\nit want to get in Windows.\n\nAny help will greatly be appriciated.\n\nPlease Reply by mail, because this site is a week late on News\n\n\n					Thanks
Hi,\n\n	I've got an older 386/25 motherboard (old as in, uses a 1988\nkeyboard controller, and uses memory interleaving rather than caching).\nIt has developed a problem where trying to copy files from floppy cause\nthe machine to lock up (reset button required), but only when in 386\nenhanced mode.  This occurs in Norton Desktop, File Manager, and when\ntrying to install software.  Running Win 3.1 in standard mode works fine.\n\n	Has anyone run into this?  Any ideas?  Much thanks appreciated.

Hello,\n\nI want a little network for 3 users. All users want to run Windows.\nThe most important things I want for the network are: file-sharing,\nmail utility, two printers on one of the computers and a fax/modem\ncard on one of the computers. We all want to use each others harddisk.\n\nMy idea was to buy three computers (one 486DX and two 386DX). All\nthree have a 40Mb local harddisk, the 486 also has a very large\nharddisk. All three also have a network card. The 486 is connected to\nthe printers and contains the fax/modem card. And last but not least:\nWorkgroups for Windows.\n\nMy questions:\n- Is this possible?\n- What exactly are the possibilities and advantages of Workgroups\n  for Windows?\n- Will all the computers be fast enough? Behind all three, someone\n  is working.

Hmm...has anyone of us computer geeks (me included) ever consider\nthat inovation is not limited to software/hardware.  True, MS\nproducts do not boast features that MS invented, but how many products\nout there by other vendors out there are truely innovative in\ntheir continuing development? \n\nI think what makes MS special to the public is thier innovative pricing.\nIt is true the XWindows/MAC/NEXT all have some feature(s) in thier GUI\nthat are better than MS.  But people like me can't afford them.\nIt is true that Apple has lower their pricing on the low end models..\nbut they are just that...low end.  System 7 is a better operating\nsystem, but the machines they operate on just are too expensive for\nmy tastes...A UNIX platform is powerful enuf, but tell the common\nuser to set up .Xdefault (i am still confused on what some of them things \ndo) and they either puke or faint.  \n\nIf u think about it, low prices aint innovative if u come down to it.  But\nfor the product it offers and on the lower cost (and powerful hardware\nthat it runs on as compare to macs)....MS is kinda innovative..\n\nOh yea, I guess the fact that the support products and applications\nthey have garnered for MSWindows does make them kinda innovative too..

Has anyone observed this?  If I copy a large, say 800K+ file (a large PKZIP\nfile for instance) to my floppy drive (3.5") under MS Windows 3.1 via either\nProgram Manager or a DOS Shell, the file copied under the DOS shell \nhas errors whereas the file copied from within Program Manager does not.\n\nThe corruption is detected by executing "pkunzip -t b:\file.zip" after \nboth copies.  The file copied via the DOS shell always shows corruption.\n\n\nNow here's the kicker:\n\n\nI have many windows open while doing this; both DOS and WINDOWs apps.\nSupposedly all WINDOWs' apps share the same time slice, whereas the \nDOS apps get their own equal time slice (unless overriden).\n\n\nSo, as an example, I have 5 WINDOWs' apps open, 2 multitasking DOS sessions running,\nand one execution-execlusive DOS shell iconized (inactive).  Under this \nscenario, CPU time is divided into two major slices:  one for all the Windows\napps and one slice for the running DOS app.  \n\nWhen copying under Windows PGM MGR, I'll assume the other Windows and DOS tasks\nare essentially inactive.  Thus PGM MGR gets, say, 80% of the Windows slice and\n95% of the execution-background DOS shell's slices.  Thus it gets (.8)(.95)^2 = \n.72 or 72% of the total available CPU time. \n\nWhen copying in a DOS shell, I activate the execute-exclusive mode DOS shell\n(no other DOS background tasks allowed), full screen, under the Windows task\nmanager.  The CPU time available to this shell would be 80% of the Windows slice\n(assumming inactive Windows applications) and 100% of the DOS slice: \n(1.0)(.8) = .8 or 80% of the total available CPU time.\n\nSo why do I get copy errors under DOS if it has the greater amount of CPU\ntime?  Is program manager working in a pre-emptive mode during the floppy \ncopy?  It must be!\n\n\n\nMiscellaneous data:  Running Windows on top of DOS 5.0, qemm 5.x, rapidbios.sys,\n                     2.0 mbyte smartdrive (no delayed writes), two ramdrives, \n                     logitech mouse driver 6.2, full 16mbytes motherboard RAM,\n                     64Kbyte motherboard cache, 386 DX 33 Mhz.\n                     \n                     Running dos-edit.com TSR in the DOS shell.\n                     \n--
Forgive me if this is stupid, but didn't I see a rumor somewhere that Apple\nwas working on an Intel platform OS.  Say like system 7 for 80X86's?
[ to a .rle file   ^^^^^^^]\n\n I thought I'd reply to this, though I ain't brad.  AT any case, a lot\nof picture-file viewers that will convert, say, between .gif,etc, to\n.bmp *will* convert to .rle.  I Know for a fact that PaintShop\n(shareware from cica; /desktop, I think, filename psVVV.zip (I think,\nwhere VVV is the ver. number.  If that's not true, let me know and I"ll\npost a corection).\n\n\nThis, however, will write your .rle file with a .bmp extension, so you\nhave to rename it.\n\nNOW, another thing....\nthis is from the windows' FAQ:\n\nyour file has to be less than 64 K\n( at least that's what the faq says, but Mine wont work for more than\nabout 30...maybe they mend 32K, I don't know).\n\nYour file has to fit VGA size (480 * 860, or whatever standard vga size\nis.)  If you use a non-vga screen (e.g. Cga, ega, svga, there is also a\nway to do it, but I thing instead of vgalogo.lgo you use another file,\nsuch as cgalogo.lgo, egalogo.lgo, or something.  I'm not sure about\nthis, as I have a vga, but i'm sure you could find it in the faq (a\nwindows help ver. of which *is* available at cica, but don't konw the\nfilename). \n\nALSO....your .bmp has to be 16 COLOURS Or less.\n\nThese specs rule out some of the good .bmp's.  I found cartoon drawings\nwork quite well as they have the advantage of looking good with little\nmemory.\n\nFinally, REMEMBER TO SAVE YOUR CURRENT WIN.COM before, and put your\nnew win.com in the windows directory.

I think you would need a DOS macro program.  Superkey (by Borland?)\ncomes to mind.  I don't think Windows is capable of sending\nkeystrokes to a DOS window.\n\nWhat you want to do sounds like a security problem to me, though.
Take a look at WinQVT/net -- the latest version is QVT/net 3.4\nIt comes in versions that are direct to packet driver, as well as a PC NFS \nversion.\n\nIt is priced quite low; registration = $40, student registration = $20, and is \na nice package -- comes complete with VT220 terminal emulation, FTP, POP3 \nclient, LPR, and NNTP client.\n\nYou can FTP it from "biochemistry.bioc.cwru.edu" /pub/qvtnet/qvtnet34.zip\n\nIt was also uploaded to ftp.cica.indiana.edu recently.\n\nAshok

From article <ardie.313.736188058@ux1.cso.uiuc.edu>, by ardie@ux1.cso.uiuc.edu (Ardie Mack):\n\nEMM386 is NOT reqired to load the DOS kernal high (or else you couldn't\ndo it on a 286).  In a mail message I recommended that he remove it\nsince he only runs ProcomPlus frequently in DOS, and I suspect\nEMM386 will slow down windows.
The format for Word for Windows doc files is available from Microsoft.\nCall their Developer Support Services number (sorry, don't have it handy)\nand ask for the Word for Windows binary file format spec.\n\nWarning:  It is not terribly useful, and you will need to do a *lot* of\nlooking before you can figure out how the stuff is stored.\n\nGeneral primer:\n\nWord for Windows stores its data in two chunks.  The first chunk is the\nactual text in the file.  This is all stored together and has nothing\nbut text and graphics.  The second chunk is the formatting information.\n\nFor general use, to read a Word for Windows file, skip the first 384 bytes\nof the file (its a general header).  Then read the remaining text until you\nhit binary data.
Yesterday, a friend of mine got a new driver for his card that more\nthan doubled the speed... Naturally, besides being a tad jealous (same \nmachine -- different cards), it got me thinking... What if I am using a slow\ndriver? Wouldn't that be _horrible_ ? :) So netlanders, I need samples of\nyour collective experience (sic) -- Do you proud owners of a Trident 8900C\nvideo card w/ 1MB VRAM have tried out more than one driver fro MS Win 3.1\nwhich? which is the fastest? Not to be selfish, and to give you a motive\nfor responding, I promise I am going to collect all the answers, and the\nactual drivers (provided u give me a site to get it from or uuencode&mail)\nget the WinMarks using PC Magazine`s WinBENCH and... post the results here...\nI am interested in SVGA drivers only (plain VGA users should run the Win\ndriver, or this is what I 've heard -- dont flame me!) Particularly\n800x600x16 and/or 800x600x256 (that should cover the majority of SVGA users)\nWell, what are you waiting for? hit that r or f or whatever...\nAll input welcome -- so are money and Sun SPARCstations...\nThanx in advance...

It depends on wether you are going to replace this with an icon that\ncomes standard with windows, or with an icon from some other icon manager.\n\nWell, if it is one of those that comes with windows, just highlight the \nitem by clicking once on it, click on 'File' and then on 'Properties'.\nYou should see a box which says 'Change icon'. Click on it. You are going\nto be presented with some icons (sometimes just one). If you don't like\nany of those presented, click on the 'browse' box, and look for the file\n'moricons.dll' Select it. Browse through the icons presented, and just\ndouble click on your desired icon.\n\nIf you want to replace it with an icon from some other icon manager,\nsay iconPower for instance, open the icon manager at the bottom of your\nscreen, where it will not block the application icon you wish to replace.\nWhen you have found your desired icon, click on it once, and while holding\nthe mouse button down, pull this icon over the one you wish to change.\nAnd thats it!\n\nregards\n\n___________________________________________________________________________

Lets see... what MS products don't have major bugs in them?  Oh, but\nthe fifth release the bugs are generally cleared up, even if their\ncustomers must buy new "releases" from them that are little more than\nbug fixes.  Anyone who buys a $2500 computer system and then runs MS\nWindows on it is in desperate need of sympathy.  \n\nOh wait! MS innovated the plastic housing on the MS mouse---didn't\nthey?  "Logitech Inside"\n\n\n\nYou can't even really call it secondary creativity when a company\ngathers together a bunch of knock-off packages and peddles them to\nneophytes.  If MS does anything, it appears someone has to do it\nfirst.  It appears that MS is finding out that throwing money at\ntechnological problems is by no means a guaranteed solution.\n\n\n ---------------------------------------------

If it's any consolation, I had a similar problem. As I recall, if I exited\nfrom a DOS session while in full-screen mode, the menu titles had changed to a\nscrambled version of the icon title font (or something like that). It only\nstarted happening after I used IconTitleFaceName in WIN.INI to change the\ndesktop font to Arial. So I stopped exiting from DOS sessions while in\nfull-screen mode.\n\nMy Mac used to do something similar. Aren't computers weird?\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------
Those are pretty typical, I believe.
It could also be that your shell is hogging the resources.  For example,\nopen the apps with data files that cause resulting low system resources\nwith ndw 2.x as shell,\n \nthen do the same with program manager, and see if it's the shell or the\napps.
Using the software you're using, I agree with you there.  What I did:\nI installed DOS, Windows and CPBackup (functionally the same\nas your Norton, for the purposes of this discussion), and used the \nDOS "backup" command on just that much.  To restore, I boot to the \n"system" diskette, and use DOS "restore" to read in that much, then\nboot to windows and restore my full backups using CPB (Norton, in your\ncase), overwriting what I've just restored.  That allows me to keep\nthis skeletal Windows essentially unchanged, with all my customization\non the "real" copy done using the 3rd-party backup utility.\n\n\nSeems possible, if you can put skeletal versions of DOS and your backup\nutility on a "system" floppy.  Then you could restore it all on one "go".
But I don't want to have to run blasted Windows every time I want to delete\na tree - it is absolutely ludicrous to load a hog like that just to delete\nsome files!  It would be like requiring a crane to change the tyre on a car.\n\n\nOnly because its crap, which is noones fault but their own.\n\n\nBy deliberately crippling the product?  Surely no...\n\nOh, hold on, I guess you're right.  That certainly stinks of MicroSoft\nmarketing techniques.\n\nBut the point still remains that a command to delete trees is not new\ntechnology, and is the kind of thing one would have expected to see long\nbefore Windows was even dreamt of.\n\n\nWell Amen to that, but I wish it were a damn sight deader.  For a dead\nproduct, its used an awful lot.  And I suspect its going to carry on\ntwitching for a long while yet, which isn't doing anyone any good.\n\n(And MicroSoft don't appear to have given up marketing DOS, so it is a very\nunusual form of death indeed).
It was 93%-94%, and actually another msdos team member posted it.\nNote that people not on the msdos team would not necessarily know\nabout that, or...\n\n\nWhen I heard those numbers I wondered how they got them (having\nworked in product support and knowing that the typical support caller\nhas very little positive to say about the product, I figured it wasn't\nfrom there...) so I wandered over to the marketing folks and asked.\nAnd I was told it was from a survey of registered users.  And I \nposted that on the net when people asked where the 93% figure came \nfrom.\n\n\nHmm. I figured, if Chuck posted the numbers, why not include where\nthey came from? (I also find it interesting that postitive info is \n"fear, uncertainty & doubt".)\n\n\n????  I think you've got me confused with someone else. I don't \npretend that MSDOS provides what all people need, or that other\nOSes (including unix & OS/2) don't provide useful and/or necessary\nfeatures.  I also don't push people to use MSDOS; I even posted in\ncomp.os.msdos.misc that I suggest _waiting_ before installing a \nnew os, esp if you have trouble (support is always overloaded \nduring release, unless the sales are a total bomb).\n\n\nI ain't saying some of us don't get defensive sometimes. Do you *really*\nthink msdos gets any more respect within microsoft than outside it?\n\nI just mean we all aren't cut out of the same dough with the same cookie\ncutter. We don't all think alike.  Yeah, ChuckSt and I have some "inside"\ninfo on MSDOS - doesn't mean that everyone else does :)  \n\n\n-jen\n\n--

I have an EISA machine and I just do not understand why most\nEISA video cards only match the performance of their ISA\ncounterparts. For instance, the EISA Orchid Pro Designer IIs-E is\nonly about as "fast" as the ISA Diamond SpeedStar Plus, which isn't\nwhat I would call "fast."\n\nI don't understand why EISA video cards aren't, as a group, on the\nsame level of performance as Local Bus cards, given that EISA video\ncards have a 32 bit bus to move data around, instead of ISA's 8 bits.\n\nSince they are not, why would anyone (me included) pay a higher\ncost for a EISA video card when its performance is no better than\nand often worse that a much cheaper ISA video board, such as a\nDiamond SpeedStar 24X? From PC Magazine's (I think) recent report,\nI know that ATI makes a pretty fast EISA video card, but it's\naround $500, which is just about double what my wallet will allow\nme to spend. And, for $500, I could get a Diamond Viper and still\nhave $100 left over (of course, I'd have to get a Local Bus mother-\nboard too...)\n\nCan anyone shed some light on my confusion/frustration?

Actually, you might be surprised to find that not everyone who develops\nmainstream DOS and Windows apps develops them under DOS or Windows.  PC\nWeek recently printed a rumor that Microsoft's Excel development group\ndoes its development under OS/2.  Another trade rag did an article\nrecently about a group doing Windows development on Sun SPARCstations\nwith SoftPC to test out their work.  SCO Unix is and has been a\nreasonably popular development platform for DOS, Windows, and even OS/2\napps.  DOS and Windows are simply not robust or stable enough for\ndevelopment work, IMHO, and apparently others agree.

Well, I've come into some money and want to buy CD-ROM, sound board\nand speakers.  I have not kept up on any material relating to sound\nboards and CD-ROM's because until now I never thought I'd have enough\nmoney.  \n\n  So can you guru's out there point me in the direction of a good\npackage including CD-ROM, sound, and speakers (and software I\nsuppose)... OR since I don't REALLY need the CD-ROM right now give me\nsome good ideas for sound boards and speakers.  Those I could REALLY\nuse now.  I have looked at SoundBlaster Pro, which costs about as much\nas I think I want to spend on a board (~$120), and I've looked at the\nGravis Sound board, which is about $140 and I don't know the\nadv/disadv of either of these boards.  \n\n  Right now I want to use it with any games that support sound, and to\nuse in Windows 3.1 to utilize sound capabilities there.  So any\nconcise info on sound boards, complete multimedia packages, etc would\nbe greatly appreciated.  If anyone else is interested in this info I\nwould be glad to summarize responses and post.  \n\n  And if this is some type of FAQ please point me in the right\ndirection and don't bother taking up a lot of bandwidth.

I would like to see a serious discussion on the best way to install windows\nfrom a Novell administrator's point of view.\n \nI just got off the phone with MS Access support and was told that they\n(Microsoft) has decided to implement, as a standard for software support,\nthe LOCAL setup (described below) as the "most advantageous installation".\nIf this is true and Microsoft deems this to be the most prudent installation\nthen I will comply but I'd like to hear it from administrators first.\n \nThe LOCAL Windows Installation:\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWindows is fully installed on each workstation hard drive (assuming the\nresources are available).  From a network administrator's implementation,\nhe/she would install all windows disks on a network drive using SETUP/A.\nThen install windows on a per/machine bases by running SETUP off the network\nto install the complete system on the local drives.  In this way, all drivers\nare available to the SETUP procedure w/o the need to change disks.\n \nAdvantages:\n- Reduce Traffic - Running Windows locally reduces network traffic due to\n  the local access of main Windows files.\n- Network independence - If the network fails (and they all do at one point\n  or another), the local installation would allow users to keep producing\n  and reduce the cost of down-time.\n- Faster Windows - Theoretically, Windows will run faster from a local hard\n  drive than over a network.  This may be a hard point to prove if the network\n  has an optical backbone and/or the network drives are significantly faster\n  access than local ones.\n- A user traveling from machine to machine does not need to worry about\n  varying setups (monochrome, color, types of mouse, etc...) since the\n  Windows installation is assigned to the Workstation.\n \nDisadvantages:\n- Cost - Installing Windows locally requires a significant amount of disk\n  space.  Workstations now must be purchased with a hard disk that can\n  increase the cost of the workstation from 10 to 30 percent.\n- Administration - Local windows installations are very difficult to\nadminister.\n  New drivers for peripherals are constantly being made available, each of\n  which would have to be individually installed on each workstation.\n- Security - Users now have access to erase or corrupt their own system\n  files from simple ignorance.  This could result in quite a headache for\n  administrators who may have to constantly repair damaged installations.\n- Backup - We all know the problems backing up local hard disks.  The backup\n  sets (if done via a centralized tape system) get very large very quickly.\n  Backup individually (to floppy) may not happen at all.  This may be\n  eliminated if it is assumed that local hard disks only contain replaceable\n  applications and *not* user data.\n \nThe SHARED Windows Installation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWindows is fully installed to a network disk via the SETUP/A procedure\ndescribed above.  Users (or administrators) then install a minimal set of\nfiles to individual "user" directories.  These directories may be on a\nlocal hard disk or perhaps a network "home" directory.  The bulk of the\nWindows system files are maintained on the network in a single directory\n(some 400+ files) and are accessed (shared) as-needed by users throughout\ntheir Windows session.  The user's files consist of a small set of files\nthat the user has updated during his/her Windows session.  These include\ngroup files, .INI files and other regularly updated files.\n \nAdvantages:\n- A single location for all files makes updates to drives easy.  As\n  an updated driver becomes available, it only needs to be installed in this\n  single directory for all users to be able to take advantage of it.\n- Assuming that the users' files are maintained in network (home) directories,\n  the administrator can easily edit any .INI file as-needed to correct\n  problems that may arise.  This includes WIN.INI and SYSTEM.INI.\n- Backup of all pertinent files is done easily.  Even if the users' files\n  are on a local hard disk, the bulk of the Windows system is backed up with\n  all driver updates.\n \nDisadvantages:\n- Network traffic - since all Windows files are being shared in a network\n  directory, traffic on the network can become a problem an effect the\n  speed of Windows.\n- If the network crashes, all production comes to a stop since Window's\n  is reliant upon the network for its files.  Loss of data usually occurs\n  as well since users working in Windows at the time of the crash will\n  usually not be able to save their work.\n- Although minimal, disk space is still a consideration.  If the users' files\n  are maintained on the network, a large number of users can cause a\n  significant utilization of disk space due to their personal Windows\n  files alone.\n- Users cannot easily move from machine to machine unless the workstation\n  hardware are similar.  This is due to the Windows installation being\n  tied to a particular username (in the case of Network user files).\n  \nThe Discussion\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nI would like to know, from other administrators with a large Windows\nuserbase, how they prefer setting up Windows.  Personally, I have\nsetup numerous installations using the SHARED setup.  All Windows and\napplication files are on the network with little or no utilization of\nlocal hard disks.  In fact, I sold a network on the fact that the\ncompany would no longer need to purchase hard disks for their workstations\nand thus save that much more money.\n \nI would also like to see recommendations for applications.  Should\napps such as Word and/or Excel be installed locally regardless of how\nWindows is installed?  Again, I keep all files on the network for easy\nbackup and administration but this is "putting all eggs in one basket";\nif the network crashes, work comes to a halt.

On my PC I almost exclusively run windows. The only dos based application  \nI have is ProcommPlus.  In my config.sys I have emm386 loaded with the  \noption noems (no expanded memory). Following a thread in one of the comp  \nnewsgroups, I read that it was no necessary to have emm386 loaded. Indeed,  \nin the manual, it says that emm386 is used to get expanded memory out of  \nextended memory. Since I have the noems option, it seems to me that the  \nemm386 device is useless in my case. \n\nShould I use emm386 or should I remove it from my config.sys?\n\nThanks for your help,
I have been posting monthly "how-to-setup a SLIP client on a PC" posts for a \nfew months.  Lots of work, and imminent graduation have come in the way of \nposting one of these for March or earlier this month -- for which I apologize.\n\nThis file includes information on writing a script for University of Minnesota\nPHONE, and also a batch file hack that lets you use other packet drivers with \nPHONE. \n\nFor additions, modifications and corrections, I can be reached at\n<ashok@biochemistry.cwru.edu>\n\nBest wishes,\nAshok\n\n-- begin SLIP.TXT --\nBased on my experiences on setting up SLIP under DOS and Windows,  here\nare my comments on setting up SLIP in this environment.  I thank the\nTrumpet beta testers and the CWRU SLIP beta testers for their comments.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nConfiguring your Modem:\n\na) Turn off DTR (AT&D0&W)\n   I have to disable DTR because the communication program that I use\n   to dial my SLIP server (QMODEM) drops DTR when I exit the program\n   and therefore hangs up the line.  If you use a program like Kermit\n   or Conex to establish the SLIP connection, then this need not be done.\n   These programs do not necessarily hangup the line when you exit.\n\n   NOTE: If you use Univ. of Minn. PHONE to dial and establish a\n         SLIP connection, you do not need to turn off DTR.\n\nb) Dial and establish the SLIP connection first.  This can be done\n   automatically if you use a program like PHONE (from the University of\n   Minnesota) which will dial and establish a SLIP connection then load the\n   SLIP packet driver.  The PHONE scripting language is simple and\n   phone scripts can be easily written to configure PHONE to work with\n   other SLIP server.  In addition, while the only packet driver\n   that PHONE works with is UMSLIP (currently), it is easy to write a\n   batch file hack that lets PHONE work with other packet drivers.\n   There is a section on PHONE in the document with both script and\n   batch file examples.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nConfiguring the SLIP drivers:\n\nThere are five SLIP packet drivers commonly available\nCSLIPPER.EXE    Peter Tattam's compressed SLIP driver\nSLIPPER.EXE     Peter Tattam's SLIP driver\nSLIP8250.COM    Crynwr driver (I like Phil Burn's modified driver)\nETHERSL.COM     Crynwr driver (ethernet simulation over SLIP)\nUMSLIP.COM      Univ. of Minnesota driver (based on SLIP8250)\n\nOf these four, I vastly prefer C/SLIPPER.EXE over SLIP8250.COM or\nETHERSL.COM for the following reasons:\n\na) It is much faster even though my modem has just a 16450 UART\nb) While using EtherSLIP/SLIP8250/UMSLIP, myself and several others\n   have noticed that the PC clock gets messed up after performing a\n   long FTP transfer.\nc) It supports PKTMUX when used in ethernet simulation mode\nd) When used in Ethernet simulation mode C/SLIPPER seem to work with\n   every TCP/IP application that I have tested it with.\n\nInstructions for C/SLIPPER.EXE (and you do not use PHONE)\na) Load SLIPPER in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file according to instructions:\n   For instance if you have a v.32bis modem on COM1\n   slipper com1 vec=62 baud=57600\nb) If you use DOS TCP/IP applications in Win 3.1 DOS boxes, then use the\n   double-ended packet driver shim WinPKT.COM -- this creates a virtual\n   packet driver at 0x60.  DOS applications in native mode, DOS\n   applications in Windows 3.1 DOS boxes and Windows applications can all\n   use this virtual driver at 0x60.\n   winpkt.com 0x60 0x62\nc) If you use QVT/Net, load PKTINT.COM next.  QVT/net is configured in\n   QVTNET.INI to use the interrupt at 0x60.\n   pktint.com\n\nInstructions for SLIP8250.COM:\na) Try getting a version 10 SLIP driver.  Philip Burns of Northwestern\n   University has a modified SLIP8250.COM driver that is better at hardware\n   handshaking.  This driver is distributed along with NuPOP.\nb) Load the driver AFTER establishing the SLIP connection.  My modem is a\n   V.32bis modem on COM1, so here is how I would load the driver.\n   slip8250 -w 0x62 -h 4 SLIP 0x03f8 57600\nc) As discussed above if you use DOS TCP/IP applications in Windows 3.x\n   DOS boxes, you probably want to use WINPKT.COM\n   winpkt.com 0x60 0x62\nd) If you use WinQVT/net, load PKTINT.COM\n   pktint.com\n\nInstructions for ETHERSL.COM:\nIf you choose to use ETHERSL.COM instead of SLIP8250.COM, the\ninstructions are exactly the same with one crucial difference.  You\nwill have to DELETE the line "device=*vcd" from the [386Enh] section\nof SYSTEM.INI.  This will interfere with running regular Windows Comm\napplications (such as Crosstalk), and you will get lots of dropped\ncharacters etc. in these applications.  This is therefore not\nrecommended.  ETHERSLIP would be loaded as:\n   ethersl -w 0x62 -h 4 0x03f8 57600\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nConfiguring Windows 3.1:\n\na) Make the following modifications to the SYSTEM.INI file [386Enh]\n   section.\n   i) List all your COM ports, with their addresses and interrupts.\n       COM1Base=03F8\n       COM1Irq=4\n       COM2Base=02F8\n       COM2Irq=3\n       COM3Base=03E8\n       COM3Irq=5\n       This can also be done from within Windows - Control Panel,\n       but double-clicking on the "Ports" icon.\n   ii) Give the port to which your modem is attached a generous COM buffer\n       COM1Buffer=10000\n   iii) Change the COM port AutoAssign value for the COM port that you wish\n       to use for your modem to ZERO.  This is the amount of time that\n       Windows waits in seconds before handing control of that COM port to\n       another application.  If you use WinQVT/net and then want to switch\n       from one session to another, and this value is at the default value\n       of 2 seconds, you are will get a GPF and Windows will crash.\n       COM1AutoAssign=0\n       This can also be done from within Windows - Control Panel.\n       Double-click on 386 Enhanced, and under "Device Contention", set\n       the device contention for the COM port your modem is on to\n       "Never Warn"\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAdditional notes:\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat to do if you are assigned a different IP address for each\nSLIP session?\n\nI am fortunate in that our campus SLIP server assigns each user\na permanent IP address, so I do not have worry about editing QVTNET.INI\neach time that I establish a SLIP connection.\n\nIf you are assigned a new IP address on every occasion that you dial in,\nplease try to use BOOTP aware software, and let BOOTP do the\nconfiguration for you.  However, QVTnet is not BOOTP aware and RARP\nwill not work over a SLIP connection.  To get QVTNet working in a\nsituation such as this, you must do the following:\n\nEdit the QVTNET.INI file.  Let the [net] section look like this:\n\n[net]\nname=\nip=\nnetmask=255.255.255.0 (or whatever is appropriate for you)\narptime=20\npacket_vector=60 (or whatever is appropriate)\n\nSave the changes, and then *write-protect* this file\n"attrib +r qvtnet.ini"\n\nStart your slip connection, and *remember* the name and IP address\nthat you are assigned.  Each time you start QVT/net 3.1x, the\ngeneral configuration dialog box will open.  Enter the name and\nIP address and you were assigned for that session, click on [OK],\nand you should be up and running.  The changes you make will not\nbe saved, as QVTNET.INI is write-protected.\n\nA more elegant solution to the problem of dynamic SLIP IP address\nassignment is provided by Victor Menayang (victor@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu)\nVictor uses the program bootpq to semi-automate qvtnet preparation.\nBootpq is used to inquire the assigned IP, which is then saved to a\nfile called "myip".  Another file "noip" is essentially a complete\nQVTNET.INI file that lacks the IP address.  In the final step "myip"\nand "noip" are copied into a single QVTNET.INI file.  An example of\nVictor's batch file is provided below:\n=====================================================\nslipper com2\npktint.com\nbootpq -i "ip=\"%%s\""  >> myip\nbootpq -i "My IP# is: %s"\ncopy /q net + myip + noip e:\com\qvtnet\qvtnet.ini\ndel /q myip\n@echo off\necho .\necho Ready to run WinQVTnet\n=====================================================\nFor questions and more details about bootpq, please contact Victor\nMenayang (victor@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu)\n\nQPC Software is attempting to add BOOTP capability to WinQVT/net.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nHow do you use PKTMUX over SLIP?\n\nPKTMUX will not work over the SLIP8250.COM packet driver, and crashes\nimmediately if used with ETHERSL.COM\n\nPKTMUX will work with C/SLIPPER.EXE, when C/SLIPPER is used in ethernet\nsimulation mode.  An example of this configuration is shown below:\n\nThe latest release of PKTMUX is 1.2c; and it is important that you\nuse this version, if you want to use virtual packet drivers with\napplications like Trumpet for Windows (to be released very shortly).\n\n[from AUTOEXEC.BAT]\n\nlh c/slipper com1 vec=65 baud=57600 ether         (packet driver)\nlh pktmux 5 65 /5       (pktmux loaded for 5 virtual packet drivers)\nlh pktdrv 7f 65         (first virtual packet driver used for QVT/net)\nlh pktint.com           (QVT/net pktint.com)\npktdrv 63 65            (PKTDRV for use in native DOS or WinTrumpet)\n\nAdditional virtual packet drivers can be loaded directly from within\nWindows 3.1 DOS boxes.  For example, my PIF file to load POPmail is\ndirected to the file "popmail.bat".  This is what popmail.bat reads\nlike:\n\npktdrv 60 65            loads a virtual packet driver at 0x60\ncd \popmail\npopmail\ncd \\npktdrv 60 /u            unloads the packet driver at 0x60\nexit                    causes the DOS window to close\n\nI have similar batch files that load other DOS TCP/IP applications\nlike PC Gopher.  It is my experience that PKTMUX works fine\neven if the virtual packet drivers in two independent virtual DOS\nsessions, are loaded at the same software interrupt.  For example\nwithin two different DOS boxes -- one for POPmail and the other for\nGopher, the virtual packet driver (pktdrv) is loaded at 0x60 in each\ninstance.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nHow much does PKTMUX degrade the performance of C/SLIPPER?\n\nI have a V.32bis/V.42bis modem in a 386-33 running Windows 3.1 with\na reasonably fast video card (ATI Graphics Ultra).  Under these\nconditions, when I have three virtual packet drivers loaded and\nbeing used as follows:\na) Driver at 0x7f -- QVTNet FTP client session\nb) Driver at 0x60 in one DOS Window -- CUTCP tn3270 session\nc) Driver at 0x60 in another DOS Window -- Trumpet for DOS\n\nI get FTP transfer rates of 0.8 - 1.0 kb/sec while transferring\ncompressed files.  This rate is comparable to that which I get with\nSLIP8250 loaded as a packet driver, and where a single TCP/IP session\nis active.  If CSLIPPER is used a packet driver and a single session\nis active, I get transfer rates of 1.3 - 1.4 kb/sec on the same\nfiles.\n\nWhile there is about 40% degradation in the performance of SLIPPER,\nfor me the benefits of being able to use PKTMUX outweigh the\nperformance hit.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nC/SLIPPER and ethernet simulation mode\n\nIn ethernet simulation mode, C/SLIPPER ver 1.3 works with all the\napplications that I have tested it with.  One or two applications\nthat required ethernet simulation balked at C/SLIPPER 1.2, but even\nthese rare problems have been resolved with ver 1.3\n\nWhen SLIPPER is used in ethernet simulation mode, and used with PKTMUX,\nI get some an error message in the QVTNet Console window that reads\n"IP:incorrect packet type" or "IP:bad version number".  This does not\nseem to prevent QVTnet from functioning, although I cannot comment on\nloss of performance.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat can you do if your DOS TCP/IP application does not work with\nC/SLIPPER in ethernet simulation mode?\n\nIn the rare event that you find a package that does not work with\nC/SLIPPER in ethernet simulation mode, first contact the author --\nPeter Tattam -- PETER@psychnet.psychol.utas.edu.au, and let him\nknow.  Chances are that he can fix it.\n\nIn the meanwhile, you can try the following.  I do not know if it is\nkosher, but it worked when I had problems with C/SLIPPER ver 1.2\n\n(C/SLIPPER is loaded at 0x62 as described above under the PKTMUX section)\n\nI load ETHERSL.COM at 0x60, run the application and then terminate\nETHERSL.COM\n\nThis also works within Windows 3.1 virtual DOS boxes.  However a\npacket driver like ETHERSL can be used in only one virtual DOS box\nat a time.\n\nSo for example, here is my batch file to run Grateful Med (a\nmedical reference retrieval program developed at the National Library\nof Medicine).\n\nethersl -w 0x60 -h 4 0x03f8 57600       loads ETHERSLIP\ncd \gm6\nsearch\ncd \\ntermin 0x60                             terminates ETHERSLIP\nexit            closes the DOS box and returns me to Windows\n\nIf you use this method, be cautious about one thing -- don't have\nany active PKTMUX DOS sessions open at the same time.  After closing\nthe ETHERSL window, you can run your PKTMUX DOS sessions with no\nproblem.  BTW, the example above -- Grateful Med, works with no\nproblems with C/SLIPPER ver 1.3\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nPHONE Script Files:\n\nThe documentation that accompany PHONE, provide good instructions on\nwriting script files to get PHONE to dial SLIP servers other than\nthe University of Minnesota server.  For example here is a script\nthat I use to dial a CISCO server at the University that I attend.\n\nBackground:  To start a SLIP connection, I dial our terminal server,\nand login with a username and password.  After doing so, I start a SLIP\nsession with the following command "slip username-slip.dialin.cwru.edu",\nfollowed by my password -- again.\n\nHere then is the relevant portion of the PHONE.CMD script file -\n#\n# CWRU-TS2 SLIP login script by Ashok Aiyar 3/26/93\n# Last revised 3/28/93\nProcedure    Host.CWRU.Login\nTimeOut 60      'CWRU-TS2 terminal server is not responding'\nMessage         "CWRU-TS2 SLIP login script -- Version 1.1"\nMessage         'Waiting for SLIP server to respond'\nQuiet ON\nExpect 'Verification'\nMessage         'Request for User Verification Received from CWRU-TS2'\nMessage         'Sending your user name and password'\nQuiet OFF\nExpect   'Username:'\nSend '%u<'\nExpect   'Password:'\nPrivate\nSend '%p<'\nReject    'Access denied'   'Your user name or password was not accepted'\nTimeOut 30    'SLIP server did not respond to your validation request'\nExpect 'CWRU-TS2>'\nSend 'SLIP<'\nTimeOut 10    'SLIP server did not respond to SLIP command'\nExpect 'IP hostname or address:'\nSend '%u-slip.dialin.cwru.edu<'\nTimeOut 10 'SLIP server did not respond to hostname'\nReject    'Bad IP address'   'Incorrect Hostname'\nExpect 'Password:'\nSend '%p<'\nReject    'Access denied'    'Password not accepted.'\nTimeOut 10\nExpect 'Header Compression will match your system'\nMessage 'Login to CWRU SLIP server successful'\nWait 1.0\nEndProcedure   Host.CWRU.Login\n#\n#\nProcedure      Host.CWRU.LogOut\n# Nothing special needs to be done to logout\nEndProcedure   Host.CWRU.LogOut\n#\n#   End of Script file\n#\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nHow to use packet drivers other than UMSLIP with PHONE?\n\nThe quick answer -- there is no "clean" way.  Below is a batch file\nhack that I wrote to use PHONE with other packet drivers.  In this\nexample, the packet driver is Peter Tattam's CSLIPPER.  To use a\nbatch file like this, you must know the parameters with which you\nplan to use the packet driver -- i.e interrupt vector, baud rate,\nport address, and IRQ.  This batch file requires UMSLIP.COM,\nCSLIPPER.EXE, and TERMIN.COM to be in the same directory\nor in your path ...\n\nAll that the BATCH file does is to let you dial the SLIP connection\nusing PHONE, load the appropriate packet driver, hangup the\nconnection, and unload the driver when you are done ...\n\n-- being CWRUSLIP.BAT --\n@echo off\nrem   this batch file is an ugly hack of U. of Minn.

Speaking of that.....\nMy comp has "emmexclude=$e000-$efff" or something of that nature in the\nsystem.ini file.  Or some system file for *windows*.\n\nI was just wondering if having that line in a *windows* startup file is\nbetter, as it will give some more memory on dos apps., but disable it\nwhen you run windows?\n\n(Actually, I *do* think that that line is also in the system.1 file)\n\npeace,\nMickey
