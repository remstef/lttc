The OTIS Project presents...\n\n       SYNERGY: Revolt \n	...the first in a continuing series of collaborative\n	art initiatives designed to exploit the binarity\n	of the infosphere.  This series of diversely \n	structured art-manipulation projects will attempt\n	to stretch across network boundries encouraging\n	use of electronic mail, fax, video, photography,\n	scanned "conventional" art and even sound to \n	create multi-artist "still" visuals in GIF and \n	JPG formats.  Visualists from all technical levels\n	are welcome.  \n\n	REVOLT will be structured simply.  There will be \n	three stages of production.  The first stage will\n	consist of all participants creating one still \n	work as a "starter" piece that two other partici-\n	pants will, in turn, manipulate.  All first stage\n	"base" images are due by Sunday, May 23rd, 1993, \n	midnight Central Daylight Time. \n\n	Stage two will begin on May 24th.  All images will \n	be sent to another (arbitrarily chosen) participant\n	for them to do manipulations on in anyway they see \n	fit.  For purely digital artists, this may consist\n	of filtering the image through their favorite paint\n	program.  For "analog" artists, this may well be\n	printing a hardcopy of the image and adding their\n	own part with pen, pencil or white-out then scan-\n	ning in the image again to be transferred on to \n	the third-stage artist.  All second-stage works\n	are due by midnight on Sunday, May 30th.\n\n	Stage three is the finishing stage and will begin\n	on May 31st.  All artists will do what they think \n	it takes to finish up the image they've been given\n	using whatever technique they see as worthy.  \n	These images will be due on June 6th, midnight.\n\n	All involved will participate in each stage of\n	creation.\n\n	-----------------------------------------------------------\n	To join, send email/mail with the following info:\n\n	Name:\n	email address:\n	mail address:\n	scanner access?

Hi there,\n        I'm using POv-Ray on my IBM compatible at home, but I would like to \nrun some things at work on our VAX computer. I believe there is a version \nof the source code for POV-ray that is VAX specific, but I'm not sure where \nto find it (I've looked at the several sites where the IBMPC version of it \ncan be found). Can anyone help me?\n\nThanks in advance,

There are several CRT-to-film writers around. Agfa has some, they also might\nbe called Matrix?, and I am pretty sure other companies sell the same\nequipment. You might want to talk to any company in your area that does\npresentation slides or offers graphics services. They should have those\nmachines and they might point you to a local vendor. From there on it's all\na question of money. They units are essentially high res CRTs plus a filter\nwheel plus a 35mm camera and a computer hook-up.\n\n\nReiner
Both xli and xloadimage will display in 24 bit color if a 24 bit visual\nis available.  Check the output of xdpyinfo to see if one is.
Get the generic version (for Unix and VMS) and build it. IMHO a\nVMS .com file to build it is supplied.\nAs the distribution comes as .tar.Z you should either have uncompress\nand tar on VMS or a UNIX flavoured machine handy.\nUsually you won't find this on IBM-PC specific archives, but on the better\nones :)

Never claimed it is a bug.\n\n\n\nNever claimed it is a bug.\n\n\n\nI guess I edited my note on this away from the article I posted to\nmany newsgroups.\n\nI wrote something about making color modifications quickly\nwith 8bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file\nprocess we have to make the modifications to the 24bit image.\nThis makes sense, because the main use of XV is only viewing images.\n\nDoing many changes to image, we should keep all modifications\nin a buffer; and then before making the operations to 24bit image,\nwe should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations.\n\n\n\nNever claimed it is a bug.\nI tried kept sure I don't claim that JPEG is noting else than\na compression algorithm, because I know what the JPEG is.\n(You propably misunderstood what I wrote as you have done in many\nplaces so far.)\n\nYou also missed what is (were) wrong with XV. However, I did wrote it.

My wife wants to publish a newsletter. She's no artist, so she intends to\nuse comercial clipart and customise it a bit by drawing a circle or a box\naround it etc. \n \nWe have MSPublisher for manipulating text, but it is not suitable for doing\nmuch with graphics, so she needs a more specialised tool. Right now she's\nlooking at Corel Draw and Harvard Draw. There seem to be more books in the\nstores on Corel than on Harvard, so she's inclined to go with Corel on the\nbasis of popularity. Can anyone give us an informed opinion on which \npackage would be more suitable or if there is an even better alternative\navailable? If this is a FAQ, please withhold the flames and just send the\nlocation of the FAQ document. Thanks.\n \nThree PS's:\n \n1) Is it ok to use clip art from Harvard Draw or whatever for commercial\n   purposes?\n \n2) We have a 600 dpi Laser Jet 4 printer. What would be a good scanner for\n   reading in paper clipart?
If you read the last couple of books in the series closely (well, #3 and #4\nat least), there are at least two points at which the real Question is\nimplied.  Conversations proceed much like:\n\nZaphod: What *is* the ultimate Question, I wonder?\nArthur (not paying much attention to Zaphod, but needing a random seed for\n  the Infinite Improbability Drive): Think of a number, any number.\n\nActually, it may be Marvin who uses this phrase a few times as well, and\neverytime it's arranged such that "Think of a number, any number" could be\nan answer to someone's question about the Question.\n\nI kind of like it.  Very mystifying.  It's not even "pick a number" or\n"tell me a number", just "think of one".

What's sort of interesting about this whole thread is just how much\nit has in common with similar threads in groups dealing with other vendor's\nhardware.  I currently deal basically with hardware from 3 vendors - Apple,\nDEC, and SGI - and thus tend to monitor the groups about those vendor's\nhardware.  Currently, it seems like SGI customers are pissed at SGI about\ndropping support for the Personal Iris, DEC customers are pissed at DEC for\ndropping MIPS support in favor of the new Alpha boxes, and Apple customers\nseem to get pissed every time a new Mac is introduced that's faster and\ncheaper than the one they just bought.  When I used to be a Sun customer\nyears ago, I remember people being pissed at Sun for leaving their 386\nand 680x0 customers out in the cold when Sparc came along.\n\n	What's really interesting is that from what I can tell, the MIS\nfolks in the basement with their ES/9000 don't seem to be pissed at IBM.\nWhy?  I have no idea.  Either IBM really does take care of their customers\nbetter, or they just have their customers brainwashed better than the\nsmaller vendors do.
Does anyone truely understand the "INVALID NORMAL ARRAY" error 3ds gives\nyou while rendering?  It seems to present itself while rendering\ncomplicated images.  I have circumvented this problem by rendering at\nthe command line, however it would be nice to render inside the editor.\nIs this a memory problem???
In an attempt to do animation with POV I have created two little\nprograms. One is a C program that will perform a "morph" between\nany two points given the amount of frames for the morph. And then\nit will write the points, and the function (translate, rotate, etc.) out\nto a file. Then I have a Perl script that will read the list of functions\nand insert them into a .pov file at a given line. I had hoped this would\nlet me do simple animation. However, I have discovered that simply\nperforming incremental rotations on an object will not spin a stationary\nobject but will actually rotate the object about the axis. Now I know\nan easy way around this would be to first translate the object to the\norigin perform the rotation and then move it back but I know there \nmust be another way around this. I had thought perhaps it was because\nI had created objects at the origin and then translated them to a new\npoint and then done the rotation, which could cause this behavior. However\nthis occurs on objects that are not translated at all. Any help is \nappreciated.

Intro to ACCESS.bus (RE: the ACCESS.bus Software Creator's \n	Contest Announcement)\n\nWHAT IS ACCESS.bus?\n\nACCESS.bus is a new open industry standard for computer \nperipheral connectivity.  ACCESS.bus is a serial protocol that \nuses simple, low-cost I2C technology to link multiple devices to \na single PC port.  Peripheral devices such as keyboards or \nkeypads, locators (Mice, Trackballs, Joysticks), printers, VR \ngloves, digitizers, sensors, actuators or data transmitters and \nothers can be easily daisy chained to the host PC.  Applications \nsuch as CAD/CAM, Data Acquisition, Simulation, Virtual Reality, \nMultiple-Player/Single PC Games, Education and many, many more \ncan now take advantage of ACCESS.bus, the technology that puts \nPlug and Play on every PC.\n\nThe ACCESS.bus offers advantages to end-users and developers of \nsystems and peripherals.  Multiple devices connect to the host \ncomputer with only one port.  Common communication methods for a \nnumber of device types lead to simplified hardware and software \ndevelopment.  As an open standard, ACCESS.bus enables cross-\nplatform use of the same device.\n\nACCESS.bus TECHNOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION:\n=====================================\n\nACCESS.bus technology is an open specification, enabling anyone \nto implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without \nfee or royalty.\nACCESS.bus has a bus topology architecture.  That is, a single \nhost can accommodate up to 125 peripheral devices.  ACCESS.bus \ndata rate is 100 Kbits/sec.\n\nACCESS.bus Physical Layer\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nACCESS.bus is a serial bus architecture, based on I2C hardware \nprotocol, with one data line and one clock line.\nStandard low-cost I2C microcontrollers handle bit-level \nhandshaking, including automatic arbitration and clock \nsynchronization.  \n\nACCESS.bus Software Protocols\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nThe ACCESS.bus communication protocol is composed of three \nlevels: I2C Protocol, Base Protocol, and Application Protocol.\n\nI2C PROTOCOL: This simple and efficient protocol defines \narbitration among contending masters without losing data.  I2C \nprovides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with \ndifferent clock rates.  Bus transactions include addressing, \nframing of bits into bytes, and byte acknowledgment by the \nreceiver.  \n\nBASE PROTOCOL: Establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between \na host computer and multiple peripherals.  The host becomes the \nACCESS.bus manager.  The Base Protocol defines the format of an \nACCESS.bus message envelope, which is an I2C bus transaction with \nadditional semantics, including checksum.\nUnique features of the Base Protocol are auto-addressing and hot \nplugging.  Auto-addressing assigns devices with unique bus \naddresses, without the need for setting jumpers or switches.  Hot \nplugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the \nsystem is running, without rebooting.\n\nAPPLICATION PROTOCOL: This is the highest level of the ACCESS.bus \nprotocol which defines message semantics specific to particular \ntypes of devices.  Each type requires a different Application \nProtocol.  Three broad device types have been identified: \nkeyboards, locators, and text devices.\n\nACCESS.bus support on the PC\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nAll three levels of the ACCESS.bus protocol are supported on the \nPC.  An add-on card implements the physical layer and uses the \nbase protocol to communicate with physical ACCESS.bus devices.  \nAn ACCESS.bus Manager - TSR under DOS and a DLL under Windows 3.1 \n- controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with \nthe ACCESS.bus device drivers.

Well, I am placing a file at my ftp today that contains several\npolygonal descriptions of a head, face, skull, vase, etc. The format\nof the files is a list of vertices, normals, and triangles. There are\nvarious resolutions and the name of the data file includes the number\nof polygons, eg. phred.1.3k.vbl contains 1300 polygons.\n\n\nIn order to get the data via ftp do the following:\n\n	1) ftp taurus.cs.nps.navy.mil\n	2) login as anonymous, guest as the password\n	3) cd pub/dabro\n	4) binary\n	5) get cyber.tar.Z\n\nOnce you get the data onto your workstation:\n\n	1) uncompress data.tar.Z\n	2) tar xvof data.tar\n\nIf you have any questions, please let me know.\n\ngeorge dabro\ndabro@taurus.cs.nps.navy.mil\n-- \ngeorge dabrowski\nCyberware Labs
You can use PBM's 'rawtopgm' to convert three raw (r, g, b) files to pgm format. Then you can use pgm3toppm to convert the pgm files to a composite ppm file,\nand feed this to cjpeg for compression. Slow, and circuitous, but it will\nwork.

I'm looking for algorithms or articles on virtual sound. What i want to do is\nthe following;\n\nFrom a fast source, eg. a CDROM, several sound sources are read, each having\nit's own defined position and other attributes, eg. direction etc.  Given the\nlisteners position and direction, the sum of sound played back in each of the\nlisteners earphones will be a function of this position and direction.  This\nmeans that some simulation of the ears coloring of sound relative to it's\nincoming direction have to be done for each sound source.  (I think this is\npossible to do with a lookup table of impulse responses for several angles\nrelative to each ear, and interpolate an impulse function from this for a given\nangle.  This impulse function could then be convoluted with the sound from the\nsource.  This impulse function must be changed every time some sound source\nchanges position or the listener changes orientation.)  Additionally some\nreflection, diffusion and absorbtion due to the environment wich is defined\ncould be simulated, but this requires some sort of sound propagandation\nsimulation, kinda like some radiosity algorithm.  \n\nHave someone done this and/or written articles on implementing such a system? \n\nPlease post or mail any answers or comments.\n\n-- \nTorgeir Veimo\n\nStudying at the University of Bergen\n\n"...I'm gona wave my freak flag high!"

Hello\n	I have posted to this newsgroup once before and recieved a\nmoderately helpful response on a couple of issues. This I appreciated very\nmuch . I would however like to know why it is that ther is simply NO \ninformation out there on some subjects for the relativly novice graphics\nprogrammer. The subjects are\n\n	1) How do you access the extra video memory on a video board. I\nknow somwhere there aresome standard video bios calls that allow you to\ndothis. I have 1meg of memory on my board and according to all the books\nand info I have read I am only (at maximum) using 256k of it. There is a\nway to do this in standard VGA cause I have seen vidoe paging (written in\nassembly, which I don't know) written into apps hat use mode 13h. To get\nany speed at all you have to do this. How do I do it?\n\n	2) The vesa standard. What gives here. I have read most of what\nthe net has to offer on VESA and as far as coding for VESA goes most of\nthe advice is cryptic at best. Where do I get public domain info that will\ntell me in "mostly plain" english how the vesa calls work.\n\n	My biggest gripe is about number 1. I have bought graphics books,\nI have asked graphics professors, I have hunted the net through both\ngopher, and archie, I ahave asked apps programmers and it is like there is\nsome lock on this information. Graphics programming books tell alot of\nprogrammiing algorithm information, but they always fall short of telling\nyou how to really control the video bios. What are all the calls folks, I\nknow there are people out there that know how to doall tis stuff. Where\nare you, and why haven't you written a book yet? \n\nPlease help\n\nThanks in advance

Well 48 bit colour *could* be for improved resolution but 16 bits per channel\nseems like a bit excessive. I have seen a paper that quoted 10 bits per channel\nof 12 bits for computational precision. More than that would seem to be wasted.\n\nPerhaps the frame buffer uses another colourspace which needs more bits to\nrepresent the full range - RGB is a cube so it is a compact encoding.\n\nMost likely however is that there are two separate 24 bit (8 bits per component)\nframe buffers. This set up, called double buffering, allows a complex 3d picture\nto be built up on one buffer while the other buffer (containing the previous\nframe) is displayed. This makes for smoother animation.\n\n\nWell hey if you want to brag about numbers, the 5000 range can take a PXG Turbo+\ncard with 96 bits per pixel. Full double buffering (Two 24 bit buffers), a 24\nbit Z buffer and an extra 24 bit buffer for off screen image storage.\n\nMind you the card costs more than your workstation.\n\n--\nChris Lilley\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTechnical Author, ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training Project\nComputer Graphics Unit, Manchester Computing Centre, Oxford Road, \nManchester, UK.

Hi I'm new to imaging, and my advisor and I would like to \ndo some 3D reconstructions.\n\nWe take slides (biological), and image them on a 486.  Then\nthe software allows us to trace the outline of the objects \nwe want to save.  The outlines are stored as a TIFF file.\n\nWe would like to convert a group of these outlines into a \n3D image.  We are unsure as to where to begin.  Someone mentioned\nthat if we could convert the TIFF into a vector format then \nwe could view them in Autocad.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.

Anyone who thinks that TIFF is too complex hasn't dealt with\n	CGM, ASN.1, CDA, DCA, SGML, or any one of a number of other\n	very successful file format.  People seem perfectly capable\n	dealing with these others.  Dealing with the format of TIFF\n	is frankly less difficult than dealing with the DCT, LZW, and\n	FAX encoding of the image data.  The majority of the libraries\n	which deal with TIFF are dedicated to these other issues rather\n	than with simply decoding the tags and parameters.\n\n	Perhaps people are overwhelmed in comparison with some rather\n	simpleminded formats such as GIF, PCX, and BMP, but to suggest\n	that TIFF is so complex as to be doomed to failure is ludicrous.\n\n	That doesn't mean that GIF isn't fine, but don't even thing about\n	using it in many instances.  GIF is very nice for use in low-end\n	photos applications and for screen grabs and such, but it would\n	never do for high-volume or high-resolution systems.  FAX is nice,\n	but it doesn't do color (and GIF doesn't do B&W all that well).\n	JPEG is nice for high-resolution color, but is slow for low-end.\n\n	The advantage TIFF brings to the table is its ability to handle\n	all these situations (and then some).  Naturally it's more complex.\n	But I'ld rather propose TIFF imaging solutions over imaging\n	systems based on having to deal with 3-4 file formats anyday.\n\n	You may find that TIFF is too complicated for your personal tastes\n	but please don't wrail against it's complexity.  The complexity\n	it contains is required to provide the functionality it does and\n	doesn't come close to the complexity found in most commercially\n	viable file formats.

I'm working on a system which uses a given set of 3D key frame\npositions (x,y,z) to control an imaginary camera movement.  I'm\nusing Kochanek-Bartels splines (as described in the SIGGRAPH '84\nproceedings) to create a variable number of inbetweens between\nthe key frames.  I want the inbetweens to be given in the form\n(x,y,z,dx,dy,dz) where the last three argumentsa are the x, y and\nz component of the viewing direction vector of the camera when\npositioned at (x,y,z).\n\nThe method presented by Kochanek and Bartels only deals with the\npositions of the inbetween view points to be generated.  I've\ntried to set the viewing direction at a view point equal to the\nchord between the two adjacent view points (which in general are\nnot key frames), but this causes a sligt discontinuity of the\nviewing direction vector at the key frame positions (although\nthe spatial movement seems to work fine; and I'm quite certain\n- I think :) - that I've not simply made an implementation\nerror...)\n\nNow I wonder if anyone out there has used this spline form for\nsimilar purposes and how they decided the viewing vectors.\nI'd appreciate replies to be emailed to me at\n  iharkest@lise.unit.no\nAnyone else interested in the answer will be sent a summary of\nthe replies if they contact me.\n\n-- \n _________     __________________\n\\        \\  \\\n \\ N G E  \\==\\ A R K E S T A D     iharkest@lise.unit.no         Comp.

Plotting packages\n=====================\n\nGnuplot 3.2\n-----------\n  It is one of the best 2- and 3-D plotting packages, with\n  online help.It's a command-line driven interactive function plotting utility\n  for UNIX, MSDOS, Amiga, Archimedes, and VMS platforms (at least!).\n  Freely distributed, it supports many terminals, plotters, and printers\n  and is easily extensible to include new devices.\n  It was posted to comp.sources.misc in version 3.0, plus 2 patches.\n  You can practically find it everywhere (use Archie to find a site near you!).\n  The comp.graphics.gnuplot newsgroup is devoted to discussion of Gnuplot.\n\nXvgr and Xmgr (ACE/gr)\n-----------------------\n  Xmgr is an XY-plotting tool for UNIX workstations using\n  X or OpenWindows. There is an XView version called xvgr for\n  Suns. Collectively, these 2 tools are known as ACE/gr.\n  Compiling xmgr requires the Motif toolkit version 1.1\n  and X11R4 - xmgr will not compile under X11R3/Motif 1.0x.\n\n  Check at ftp.ccalmr.ogi.edu [129.95.72.34} in\n  /CCALMR/pub/acegr/xmgr-2.09.tar.Z (Motif version)\n  /CCALMR/pub/acegr/xvgr-2.09.tar.Z (XView version)\n\n  Comments, suggestions, bug reports to Paul J Turner\n  <pturner@amb4.ese.ogi.edu> (if mail fails, try pturner@ese.ogi.edu).\n  Due to time constraints, replies will be few and far between.\n\nRobot\n-----\n  Release 0.45 : 2-D and limited 3-D. Based on XView 3, written\n  in C / Fortran (so you need a Fortran compiler or the f2c translator).\n  Mainly tested on Sun4, less on DECstations. Check at\n  ftp.astro.psu.edu (128.118.147.28),  pub/astrod.\n\nVG plotting library\n-------------------\n  This is a library of Fortran callable routines at sunspot.ceee.nist.gov\n  [129.6.64.151]\n\nXgobi\n-----\n  It's being developed at Bellcore, and its speciality are\n  multidimensional data sets analysis and exploration. You can call it\n  from the S language also, and it works as an X11 client using the Athena\n  widget set (or with an ASCII terminal). It's distributed free of charge\n  from STATLIB at CMU.\n  To get it via e-mail, send email to statlib@temper.stat.cmu.edu and\n  in the body area of the message, put the line\n\n  send xgobi from general\n\n  If you want to pick it via ftp, connect to lib.stat.cmu.edu. Log in as\n  "statlib" and use your e-mail address as your password. Then type\n\n  cd general\n  mget xgobi.*\n\n  Warning: It's about 2 MB sources + large Postscript manual. Read the\n  relevant README to decide whether you need it or not.\n\nPGPLOT\n------\n  Runs on VAX/VMS and supposedly on UNIX. It's a set of fortran routines freely\n  available (though copyrighted and requiring a nominal fee of $50 or so)\n  that includes contour plots and support for various devices, including ps.\n  Contact tjp@deimos.caltech.edu\n\nGGRAPH\n------\n  Host shorty.cs.wisc.edu [128.105.2.8] : /pub/ggraph.tar.Z\n  Unknown more details.\n\nepiGRAPH\n--------\n  For PCs.

Advanced 2D package\n  that has a big list of features. Contact:\n\n  Dr. Alan Baxter <agb16@mbuc.bio.cam.ac.uk>,\n  Cambridge University\n  Department of Pathology,\n  Tennis Court Road,\n  Cambridge CB2 1QP, UK\n\n\nAthena Plotter Widget set\n-------------------------\n  \n  This version V6.0 is based on Gregory Bond's version V5-beta. Added\n  some stuff for scientific graphs, i.e. log axes, free scalable axes,\n  XY-lineplots and some more, and re-added plotter callbacks from V4, e.g.\n  to request the current pointer position, or to cut off a rectangle from the\n  plotting area for zooming-in. Version V6.0 has a log of bugs fixed and a\n  log of improvements against V6-beta. Additionally I did some other\n  changes/extensions, besides \n  \n  -     Origin and frame lines for axes.\n  -     Subgrid lines on subtic positions.\n  -     Line plots in different line types (lines, points, lines+points,\n   impulses, lines+impulses, steps, bars), line styles (solid, dotted,\n   dashed, dot-dashed) and marker types for data points.\n  -     Legend at the right or left hand side of the plot.\n  -     Optional drawing to a pixmap instead of a window.\n  -     Layout callback for aligning axis positions when using\n   multiple plotters in one application.\n  \n  Available at export.lcs.mit.edu, directory contrib/plotter\n\nSciPlot\n-------\n  SciPlot is a scientific 2D plotting and manipulation program. \n  For the NeXT (requires NeXTStep 3.0), and it's shareware.\n\n  Features:\n  ASCII import and export;  EPS export; copy, cut, paste with data buffer;\n  free number of data points, data buffer, and document window;\n  selective open and save ; plotting in many styles; automatic legend;\n  subviews; linear and logarithmic axes; two different axes; text and graphic;\n  color support; zoom; normalizing and moving; axis conversions;\n  free hand data manipulations (cut, edit, move, etc.); data editor; sorting\n  of data; absolute,relative, and free defined error bars;\n  calculating with buffers (+, -, *, / ); background subtractions\n  (linear,shirley,tougaard, bezier); integration and relative integration;\n  fitting of one or more free defined functions; linear regression;\n  calculations (+, -, *, /, sin, cos, log, etc.); function generator;\n  spline interpolation; least square smooth and FFT smooth; differentiation;\n  FFT; ESCA calculations and database; .. and something more \n\n  You can find it on:\n  ftp.cs.tu-berlin.de [130.149.17.7] : /pub/NeXT/science/SciPlot3.1.tar.Z\n\n  Author:\n  Michael Wesemann\n  Scillerstr. 73,1000 Berlin 12, Germany   \n  mike@fiasko.rz-berlin.mpg.de\n\nPLPLOT\n------\n  PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for many systems, small (micro)\n  and large (super) alike.  Despite its small size and quickness,\n  it has enough power to satisfy most users, including:\n  standard x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots,\n  mesh plots, bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or\n  different sizes) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each\n  graph.  Different line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually\n  infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are\n  almost 1000 characters in the extended character set.  This includes four\n  different fonts, the Greek alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and\n  other symbols.  The fonts can be scaled to any size for various effects.\n  Many different output device drivers are available (system dependent),\n  including a portable metafile format and renderer.\n  \n  Freely available (but copyrighted) via anonymous FTP on\n  hagar.ph.utexas.edu, directory pub/plplot\n  \n  At present (v. 4.13), PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems:\n  \n  Unix:   SunOS, A/IX, HP-UX, Unicos, DG/UX, Ultrix\n  Other platforms: VMS, Amiga/Exec, MS-DOS, OS/2, NeXT\n  \n  Authors: Many.

Image analysis software - Image processing and display\n==========================================================\n\nPC and Mac-based tools (multi-platform software)\n======================\n\nIMDISP\n------\n  IMDISP Written at JPL and other NASA sites. Can do simple display,\n  enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS\n  data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions\n  [PC and Macs]\n\nLabVIEW 2\n---------\n  LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a\n  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the\n  "program" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.\n  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a\n  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the\n  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and\n  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any\n  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real\n  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual\n  instrument.\n\n  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)\n  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time\n  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for\n  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The\n  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block\n  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming\n  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:\n  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters\n  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C\n  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual\n  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.\n\n  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an\n  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level\n  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level\n  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.\n\n  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has\n  utility functions for memory management data communications and\n  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for\n  the development of custom code.)\n\nUltimage Concept VI\n-------------------\n  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual\n  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end\n  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.\n  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory\n  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,\n  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,\n  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.\n\n  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further\n  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of\n  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and\n  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical\n  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and\n  characterization.\n\n  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel\n  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and\n  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can\n  be imported.\n\n  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial\n  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic\n  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological\n  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole\n  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.\n  Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and\n  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of\n  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and\n  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The\n  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom\n  modules.\n\n  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity\n  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can\n  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight\n  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging\n  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are\n  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local\n  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.\n  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as\n  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)\n  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening\n  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.\n\n  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even\n  hole filling.\n\n  The program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area,\n  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.\n\n  GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494\n  707-579-1733\n\nIPLab Spectrum\n--------------\n  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the\n  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by\n  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user\n  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far\n  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool\n  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a\n  movie command for cycling through windows.\n\n\nMacintosh-based tools\n=====================\n\nNCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more\n---------------------------------\n  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the\n  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results\n  from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,\n  documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from\n  ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. Commercial versions of the NCSA programs have been\n  developed by Spyglass.\n\n  Spyglass, Inc. 701 Devonshire Drive Champaign, IL  61820 (217) 355-6000\n  fax: 217 355 8925\n\nNIH IMAGE\n---------\n  Available at alw.nih.gov (128.231.128.7) or (preferably)\n  zippy.nimh.nih.gov [128.231.98.32], directory:/pub/image.\n  It has painting and image manipulation tools, a macro language,\n  tools for measuring areas, distances and angles, and for counting\n  things. Using a frame grabber card, it can record sequences of\n  images to be played back as a movie. It can invoke user-defined\n  convolution matrix filters, such as Gaussian. It can import raw\n  data in tab-delimited ASCII, or as 1 or 2-byte quantities. It also\n  does histograms and even 3-D plots. It is limited to 8-bits/pixel,\n  though the 8 bits map into a color lookup table. It runs on any Mac\n  that has a 256-color screen and a FPU (or get the NonFPU version\n  from zippy.nimh.nih.gov)\n\nPhotoMac\n--------\n  Data Translation, Inc. 100 Locke Dr. Marlboro, MA 01752 508-481-3700\n\nPhotoPress\n----------\n  Blue Solutions 3039 Marigold Place Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 805-492-9973\n\nPixelTools and TCL-Image\n------------------------\n  "Complete family of PixelTools (hardware accelerator and applications\n  software) for scientific image processing and analysis.  Video-rate\n  capture, display, processing, and analysis of high-resolution\n  monochromatic and color images.  Includes C source code."\n\nTCL-Image:\n  "Software package for scientific, quantitative image processing and\n  analysis. It provides a complete language for the capture, enhancement,\n  and extraction of quantitative information from gray-scale images.\n  TCL_Image has over 200 functions for image processing, and contains the\n  other elements needed in a full programming language for algorithm\n  development -- variables and control structures.  It is easily\n  extensible through "script" (or indirect command) files. These script\n  files are simply text files that contain TCL-Image commands.  They are\n  executed as normal commands and include the ability to pass parameters.\n  The direct capture of video images is supported via popular frame\n  grabber boards.  TCL-Image comes with the I-View utility that provides\n  conversion between common image file types, such as PICT2 and TIFF."\n\n  Perceptics 725 Pellissippi Parkway Knoxville, TN 37933 615-966-9200\n\nSatellite Image Workshop\n------------------------\n  It comes with a number of satellite pictures (raw data) and does all\n  sorts of image enhancing on it. You'll need at least a Mac II with co-\n  processor; a 256 color display and a large harddisk. The program doesn't\n  run under system 7.x.ATE1 V1\n\n  In the documentation the contact address is given as:  Liz Smith, Jet\n  Propulsion Laboratory, MS 300-323, 4800 Oak Grove Dr,.Pasadena, CA 91109\n  (818) 354-6980\n\nVisualization Workbench\n-----------------------\n  "An electronic imaging software system that performs interactive image\n  analysis and scientific 2D and 3D plotting."\n\n  Paragon Imagine 171 Lincoln St. Lowell, MA 01852 508-441-2112\n\nAdobe Photoshop\n---------------\n\n  The tool supports Rtrue colorS with 24-bit images or 256 levels of grey\n  scale.  Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with\n  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS\n  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.\n  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted\n  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For\n  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from\n  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,\n  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include\n  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation\n  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to\n  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,\n  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.\n\n  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard\n  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,\n  availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe\n  Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,\n  EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,\n  PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..\n\n  Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA\n  94039-7900 415-961-4400\n\nColorStudio and ImageStudio\n---------------------------\n  ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has\n  more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and\n  therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to\n  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The\n  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can\n  easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a\n  variety of powerful selection tools including the "auto selection tool"\n  which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close\n  hues, color range and mask.\n\nImageStudio: Don't know...\n\n  Letraset USA 40 Eisenhower Drive Paramus, NJ 07653 201-845-6100\n\nDapple Systems\n--------------\n  "High resolution image analysis software provides processing tools to\n  work with multiple images, enhance and edit, and measure a variety of\n  global or feature parameters, and interpret the data."\n\n  Dapple Systems, 355 W. Olive Ave, #100 Sunnyvale, CA 94086 408-733-3283\n\nDigital Darkroom\n----------------\n  The latest release of Digital Darkroom has five new selection and\n  editing tools for enhancing images. One such feature allows the user to\n  select part of an image simply by "painting" it. A new polyline\n  selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide\n  selections.  A brush lets the operator "paint" with a selected portion\n  of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.\n  This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale\n  images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as\n  powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.\n\n  Silicon Beach Software 9770 Carroll Ctr. Rd., Suite J San Diego, CA\n  92126 619-695-6956\n\nDimple\n------\n  It  is compatible with system 6.05 and system 7.0 , requires Mac LC or\n  II series with 256 colours, with a recommended min of 6Mb of ram. It has\n  the capability of reading Erdas files. Functions include; image\n  enhancement, 3D and contour plots, image statistics, supervised and\n  unsupervised classification, PCA and other image transformations. There\n  is also a means (Image Operation Language or IOL) by which you can write\n  your own transformations. There is no image rectification, however\n  Dimple is compatable with MAPII. The latest version is 1.4 and it is in\n  the beta stage of testing. Dimple was initially developed as a teaching\n  tool and it is very good for this purpose."\n\n  "Dimple  runs on a colour Macintosh.  It is a product still in its\n  development phase.. i.e. it doesn't have all the inbuilt features of\n  other packages, but is coming along nicely.  It has its own inbuilt\n  language for writing "programs" for processing an image, defining\n  convolution filters etc. Dimple is a full mac application with pull down\n  menus etc...

The tool has over 80 mathematical filter\n  variations: "Laplacian, medium noise filter", etc.  Files can be saved\n  as either TIFF, PICT, EPSF or text (however EPSF files can't be imported).\n\n  MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines, IA  50322 515-270-8109\n\nImage Analyst\n-------------\n  An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative\n  data from video images.  Image Analyst lets users configure\n  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the\n  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such\n  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video\n  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in\n  radiographs.\n\n  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video\n  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of\n  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine\n  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature\n  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst\n  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or\n  a disk-stored image.\n\n  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user\n  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.\n  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically\n  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.\n  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and\n  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and\n  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR\n  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.\n\n  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence\n  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user\n  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)\n  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the\n  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,\n  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and\n  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so\n  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also\n  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.\n\n  Automatix, Inc. 775 Middlesex Turnpike Billerica, MA 01821 508-667-7900\n\nIPLab\n-----\n  Signal Analytics Corp. 374 Maple Ave. E Vienna, VA  22180 703-281-3277\n  FAX 703-281-2509\n\n  "Menu-driven image processing software that supports 24-bit color or\n  pseudocolor/grayscale image display and manipulation."\n\nMAP II\n------\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II distributed by John Wiley has\n  integrated image analysis.\n\nIMAGE\n-----\n  from Stanford : Try anonymous ftp from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\n  It has pd source for image v2, and ready to run code for a mac under\n  image v3.\n\n\n\nWindows/DOS PC-based tools\n==========================\n\nCCD\n---\n  Richard Berry's CCD imaging book for Willamon-Bell contains (optional?)\n  disks with image manipulating software.

Software distributed by 9-track, Exabyte, DAT,\n  or (non-anonymous) internet ftp.  Documentation (PostScript mostly)\n  available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),\n  directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building\n  the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.\n     This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is\n  primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy\n  data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a\n  synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything\n  from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.\n  There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based\n  graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware\n  functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and\n  can do image arithmetic, etc.\n    The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is\n  available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and\n  Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.\n     There is currently a project - "AIPS++" - underway to rewrite the\n  algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an\n  object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for\n  free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be\n  in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with\n  contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and\n  Australia to name a few. \n\nLABOimage\n---------\n  (version 4.0 is out for X11) It's written in C, and currently\n  runs on Sun 3/xxx, Sun 4/xxx (OS3.5, 4.0 and 4.0.3) under SunView.\n  The expert system for image segmentation is written in Allegro Common Lisp.\n  It was used on the following domains: computer science (image analysis), \n  medicine, biology, physics.

All functions can be easily accessed via the\n  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image\n  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that\n  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of\n  modules.\n\n  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and\n  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and\n  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and\n  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and\n  ratioing.\n\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more\n  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.\n  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer's environments. Using\n  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific\n  applications programs.\n\n  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick\n  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,\n  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be\n  interactively driven through this control.\n\n  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of\n  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of\n  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential\n  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be\n  added to further enhance referenced imagery.\n\n  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels\n  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help\n  required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The\n  purchase price includes all functionality required for professional\n  processing of remote sensed data.\n\n  For further information, please contact:\n\n  The Business Manager, CLOUGH Engineering Group Systems Division, 627\n  Chapel Street, South Yarra, Australia 3141.

Supports 24-bit display"\n\nHIPS\n----\n(Human   Information   Processing Laboratory's Image Processing System)\n\n  Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image\n  processing which has been used for basically all the usual image\n  processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil\n  exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of\n  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has\n  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well\n  as a huge user-contributed library.\n\n  Feature description\n\n  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide\n  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,\n  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images\n  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.\n\n  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image\n  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform\n  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital\n  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image\n  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs\n  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task\n  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows\n  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users\n  become effective using HIPS on their first day.\n\n  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in\n  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been\n  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines\n  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and\n  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX\n  ``filters''.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual\n  pages, and on-line documentation.\n\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents\n  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing\n  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating\n  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation\n  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.\n  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and\n  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.\n  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and\n  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and\n  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a\n  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun\n  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X\n  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an\n  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS\n  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with\n  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-\n  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices\n  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.\n\n  Availability\n\n  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an\n  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It\n  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS\n  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or\n  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of\n  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.\n\n  Michael Landy SharpImage Software P.O.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]\n\n  MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives\n  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in\n  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional\n  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS\n  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary\n  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-\n  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer\n  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the\n  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision\n  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in\n  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire\n  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize\n  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data\n  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value\n  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time\n  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of\n  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of\n  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other \n  palettes can be generated.\n\n\nSupported functions include such niceties as the following:\n\no  image & image: + - / * interpolation\no  image & constant: + - / *\no  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,\n   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short.\no  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or\n   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.\no  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,\n   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp\n   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.

Okay, I got enough replies about the Kubota Kenai/Denali systems that I\nwill post a summary of their capabilities.  I haven't actually used one\nor seen one, so take the specs with a grain of salt.  I'd like to see\nan independent review of one against, say, an SGI Indigo Extreme or\nsomething.\n\nBasically, the Kenai workstations are DEC Alpha AXP based workstations that\nrun OSF/1 ( DEC's ) and will likely run Windows NT in the future.  They are\nbinary compatible with Digital's OSF/1 Alpha AXP implementation.  Denali\nis their graphics subsystem, which is upgradable in the field by\nsimply adding "transformation engines".\n\nThe two main Kenai machines are the 3400 Imaging and 3D Graphics Workstation\nand the 3500 Imaging and 3D Graphics Workstation.\n\n\n			3400			3500\n\nCPU			DEC Alpha AXP 133MHz	DEC Alpha AXP 150MHz\nOn-chip cache		8k/8k			8k/8k\nOnboard cache		512K			512K\nWord Size		64-bit			64-bit\nMemory ( initial )	32-128MB		32-256MB\nMemory ( future )	512MB			1GB\nSPECMARK89		111			126\nSPECINT92		75			84\nSPECFP92		112			128\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nTransform Modules	1-6			1-6\nFrame Buffer Modules	5,10,20			5,10,20\nFrame Buffer		1280x1024x24bit		1280x1024x24bit\n			double buffered		double buffered\nZ-buffer		24-bit			24-bit\nAlpha/stencil		8-bit			8-bit\nStereo support		yes			yes\nOther:				both machines will double buffer or do\n				stereo output per window.

The Kenai stations work with a graphics architecture\nknown as Denali.  The Denali comes in three models, the E, P, and V.  They\nuse a DECchip 21064 superscalar RISC processor at 150MHz.  Their\ncapabilities are as follows:\n\n			E		P		V\n\n2D Vectors		800-200K	2000-3800K	4000-4800K\n3D Vectors #1		350-1100K	1100-1800K	1800-2100K\n3D Vectors #2		300-1000K	1000-1600K	1600-1900K\n3D Vectors #3		300-500K	800-1000K	1300-1400K\n3D Triangles, #4	200-500K	600-1000K	1000-1200K\n3D Triangles, #5	100-200K	300-400K	500-600K\n\n#1: 10 pixel, flat shaded, connected\n#2: 10 pixel, Gouraud shaded, connected\n#3: 10 pixel, 2-pixel wide, anti-aliased, connected\n#4: 50-pixel, Gouraud shaded, Z-buffered, strip\n#5: 50-pixel, texture mapped, persp., point sampled\n\nIMAGE PROCESSING\n\nCine loop - 8-bit	15-36Mp/s	37-58 Mp/s	60-68 Mp/s\nCine loop - 16-bit	14 Mp/s		25 Mp/s		38 Mp/s\nCine loop - 24-bit	12-21 Mp/s	21 Mp/s		21 Mp/s\nContrast stretching #1	14 Mp/s		25 Mp/s		20 Mp/s\nBilinear zoom		6 Mp/s		11 Mp/s		20 Mp/s\nTrilinear interp#2	--		6 Mvoxels/s	11 Mvoxels/s\n\n#1: Lookup table -- 12-,16-bit to 8\n#2: Trilinear interpolation, 8-bit voxels\n\nCONFIGURATIONS\nFrame Buffer Modules	5		10		20\nTransform Engine Mod.	1-3		3-5		5-6\n\n\nAs you can see, these are pretty powerful workstations, and the best part\nis the pricing.  I would recommend that you call Kubota for more information.\nTheir number is 408-727-8100.  I'm sure they'll send you an information you\nmay want.

The problem is that the process is inherently complicated ! The IJG's code is\npretty good if you ask me, and I have watched it go through many many cycles of\nrevision.\n\nTry getting a good book on the subject, that will explain the algorithms.\n\nSpecifically "JPEG Still Image Compression Standard" by Pennebaker & Mitchell,\nVNR 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1.\n\nBTW. I presume your comment about "good" code wasn't meant to sound as offensive\nas it does.
Well, yeah, but unlike TIFF they all do substantially more than encode\nrectangular bitmaps.  And the others are hardly trouble free.  I hear that\nit is quite common for CGM implementations not to interoperate.\n\nThe annoying thing about TIFF is that is that along with the 50 useful\noptions, there are 100 stupid options.  The most egregious example is that\nrather than picking a byte order and bit order and using it consistently\nin all TIFF files, byte and bit order are options and all TIFF readers on\nall machines, no matter what their natural byte order, have to be prepared\nto do byte swapping.  There are four slightly different FAX formats --\nagain, any one of them would have been adequate.  RGB images can be stored\nby pixel or by component, complexity without function, etc, etc.  I also\nnote that the TIFF doc says that Aldus' experiments show that LZW reliably\ncompresses as well or better than any of the FAX formats, suggesting that\nnone of the FAX formats are really useful.\n\nWhat's worse, a lot of the formats aren't even implemented very well,\ne.g., LZW limits code words to 12 bits, while 14 or 16 bits would have\nprovided substantially better compression.  And the LZW method compresses\nbytes rather than pixels.\n\nBut the absolute worst thing about TIFF is that any vendor can register\nproprietary TIFF codes and formats without even publicly documenting them.\nThis means that there is NO WAY to write a TIFF reader that can reliably\nread all incoming TIFF files.  Some standard.
Utah raster toolkit using getx11. Convert your sun raster files (presumably) to \nppm with the pbm+ toolkit then convert ppm to utah rle format with ppmtorle which\nis provided in the toolkit.\n\nI seem to remember that Xloadimage can do 24 bit servers too.\n\nPossibly xwud the x window un-dump program can display 24 bit images; certainly\nxwd can grab them.\n\n--\nChris Lilley\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTechnical Author, ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training Project\nComputer Graphics Unit, Manchester Computing Centre, Oxford Road, \nManchester, UK.

Due to a number of bugs in GKS4.1 under SUNOS 4.1.3, I installed\npatches 100533-15 and 100755-01. Patch 100533-15 appears to\nwork fine and has fixed a number of problems. Patch 100755-01,\nhowever, which is required to fix a number of other annoying\nbugs, breaks with our applications.\n\nIs there a more recent revision of patch 10075?\n\nAny other ideas?
A good reason (which is why many companies use it) for 48 bits / pixel\nis so you can use double buffering (for animating scenes) - i.e. you have\n2 * 24-bit planes. You write to the one in the background, and then FLIP! \n-- the entire screen updates to the second image-plane. The screen updates \nin one refresh and you don't see different objects appearing in the order \nthat they're drawn (as in the CAD/MacDraw effect). Now your ready to update \nthe image that used to be in the foreground.\n\nSteve. (thssstb@iitmax.iit.edu / iris.iit.edu)

^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nDoes this mean they can either do alpha or stenciling, but not both\nsimultaneously?\n\n                                                                 ^^\n\nSame question again, does this mean they can either do double\nbuffering or stereo, but not both simultaneously?\n--
Hi all,\n	I am working on a project in which I need to brake an image\ninto sub-bands and then work with them.  Since I have never done\nanything like this, don't even understand the concept of sub-bands, I\nwas wondering if there is some software out there that would allow me\nto do this.  Any hints?\nThanks,\n--
Could anyone tell me the format of GIF files.  I would like to know how I \ncould determine the size of the picture.  Also, are gif files in compressed\nformat?  How many bits store pixel color information?  \n\n(This is probally a simple question, but I couldn't find it in the FAQ.)\n\nemail responses would be perferred
I'm also interested in info both public domain and commercial graphics library \npackage to do PC VGA graphics.  \n\nI'm currently working on a realtime application running on a PCC with a \nnon-DOS kernel that needs to do some simple graphics.  I'm not sure if \nreentrancy of the graphics library is going to be an issue or not.  \nI suspect I'll implement the display controller as a server process that \nhandles graphics requests, queued on a mailbox, one at a time.  If this \nprovides sufficiently frequent display updates then I believe that I can \nrestrict all graphics operations to be performed by the server and thus \nconstrain access to the library to a this single process and avoid the need\nfor a reentrant graphics library.  \n\nBeing fairly new to the realtime systems world I may be overlooking something,\nwhat do you think?
Well, I dived in feet first and reverse engineered the .PRJ file as much\nas I needed to - extracted the mapping icon information - which is\nwhen it dawned on me that 3D Studio is useless for my needs. I need\na mapping icon per applied texture.  I want to use a special purpose\ngraphics computer for rendering the 3DS models and it requires a texture\nrule/plane to be specified in 3Space, i.e. position/orientation of the\nmapping rule.  Since only one mapping icon is used in 3DS to apply\ntextures to ALL objects/faces, it renders (no pun intended) 3DS totally\nunsuitable for my needs.\n\nAnyone got a contact for Alias Upfront or any other good modeller for a\nPC?  I must be able to specify texture rules (one per texture) and this\nmust be saved in a file which I can read.  I haven't found any info on Alias\nin the copy of the faq that I have.
I was at an Adobe seminar/conference/propaganda forum/whatever-you-want-to-\ncall-it a couple months ago where they announced that Display Postscript was\ngoing to be included in the next release of Sun's OS, (presumably Solaris.)\nSun was going to drop their development of Newsprint, and, in return for this,\nAdobe was going to port Illustrator and Photoshop to Sun.  Other than the\narticles that appeared in the trade journals immediately after, I haven't\nheard a peep about it.  I hope it's still in the works.
!: Concerning the proposed newsgroup split, I personally am not in favor of\n!: doing this.  I learn an awful lot about all aspects of graphics by reading\n!: this group, from code to hardware to algorithms.  I just think making 5\n!: different groups out of this is a wate, and will only result in a few posts\n!: a week per group.  I kind of like the convenience of having one big forum\n!: for discussing all aspects of graphics.  Anyone else feel this way?\n!: Just curious.\n!\n!Yes. I also like knowing where to go to ask a question without getting\n!hell for putting it in the wrong newsgroup.\n\nI am also against splitting the group. The traffic will decrease\non any given subject but the required net bandwidth will INCREASE\nbecause of multiply cross-postings.\n\nI just went through this with another group I continuously read.\nIt is now almost at the point where it is no longer worth reading.\n\nStrongly suggest NOT doing this.
Hei Pei.\n\nI can not help you directly width you problem, but there may be\nintermediate roads to take to get to the IFF. I am using a converter\nthat can take IGES, IIF, DXF -> IGES, MILESPEC I IGES, MILESPEC II IGES, \nIIF, MILESPEC I IIF, MILESPEC II IIF  and DXF.\n\nIIF is IBM IGES FORMAT. There may be converters out there that can handle\nIGES to IFF. Hope this was to any help. By the way the converter is part\nof the IGES Processor/6000 package from IBM and it runs on RS/6000 AIX.
Can anyone around here point me to information regarding STEREOSCOPIC images?\nI believe I saw some at a show room in Texas (Lone Star Illusions)  and \nthey were amazing.  I've now heard that they were created with a simple \ngraphic program.  Does anyone have any of these images digitized??  \nI really want to find a out as much as I can..
: My wife wants to publish a newsletter. She's no artist, so she intends to\n: use comercial clipart and customise it a bit by drawing a circle or a box\n: around it etc. \n:  \n: We have MSPublisher for manipulating text, but it is not suitable for doing\n: much with graphics, so she needs a more specialised tool. Right now she's\n: looking at Corel Draw and Harvard Draw. There seem to be more books in the\n: stores on Corel than on Harvard, so she's inclined to go with Corel on the\n: basis of popularity.

You'd have to read the licence agreement that\ncomes with the package to be sure.\n\n--
Yes.  Here's what you should do.\n\nKeep the vertices in an array, and have the polygons (triangles are okay,\nbut n-sided polygons are slightly more efficient) store the indices into\nthe array of the vertices that comprise them.  You set a flag for each\nvertex when you transform it, so you don't have to transform any vertex\nmore than once; you also do backface elimination before processing the\npolygon, so that vertices that belong only to bacfacing polys don't have\nto be transformed at all.\n\nWhenever you transform a vertex, check if it's on the far side of the hither\nplane; if it is, you can project it right away and store the result.\n\nThen do your Z clip; any vertices that get produced will have to have their\nprojection done at that stage.
FIRST ANNUAL PHIGS USER GROUP CONFERENCE\n\n          The First Annual PHIGS User Group Conference was held March 21-24\n          in Orlando, Florida.  The conference was organized by the Rensse-\n          laer Design Research Center in co-operation with  IEEE  and  SIG-\n          GRAPH.   Attendees  came  from five countries spanning three con-\n          tinents.   A  good  cross-section  of  the  PHIGS  community  was\n          represented  at this conference with participants including PHIGS\n          users, workstation vendors, third-party PHIGS implementors, stan-\n          dards  committee  members,  and  researchers  from  industry  and\n          academia.  The opening speaker, Dr. Richard Puk, challenged PHIGS\n          users  to  "take  charge of your PHIGS" by participating in PHIGS\n          standardization activities and communicating their needs to PHIGS\n          implementors.    The   closing  speaker,  Dr.  Andries  Van  Dam,\n          described his vision of the future of graphics standards  "beyond\n          PHIGS".\n\n          Technical paper sessions in the conference covered the  following\n          topics:  PHIGS  and  X, Application Toolkits, Application Issues,\n          Texture Mapping, NURBS,  PHIGS  Extensions,  and  Object-Oriented\n          Libraries and Frameworks.  Panel sessions on PHIGS and PEX, PHIGS\n          Non-Retained Data, Real-World CAD Applications Using  PHIGS,  and\n          Portability  Issues generated enthusiastic discussions and formed\n          a good forum for exchange of ideas, needs, and experiences.   The\n          conference  also included a day full of tutorials on topics rang-\n          ing from mathematics for 3D  graphics  to  object-oriented  tools\n          based on PHIGS.\n\n          Next year's conference is planned for March, 1994.\n\n          PHIGS EVERYWHERE\n\n          At the conference, PHIGS  vendors   described   and  demonstrated\n          PHIGS  products  that  run on all types of computers, from PCs to\n          mainframes.\n\n          Megatek Corporation demonstrated their PHIGS extensions including\n          conditional traversal, composite logical input devices, texturing\n          and translucency.\n\n          Template Graphics  Software  launched  FIGARO+  PRO,  the  Photo-\n          Realistic  Option  for  PHIGS+.  FIGARO+  PRO  is designed to add\n          advanced rendering to the existing PHIGS+ API, with features like\n          ray   tracing,  materials,  anti-aliasing  and  texture  mapping.\n          Radiosity support is also planned.\n\n          FIGARO+ is an example of how TGS continues to add newly  emerging\n          graphics  features to their products.  FIGARO+ supports immediate\n          mode extensions to PHIGS and also supports SUN XGL,  HP  Starbase\n          and SGI GL/OpenGL. FIGARO+ for NT will be released this summer.\n\n          TGS also demonstrated the latest versions of FIGraph, a  powerful\n          "2-call"  charting  system  based on PHIGS+, and FIGt, an object-\n          oriented utility library for PHIGS/PEX developers.\n\n          G5G and Gallium Software demonstrated a new version of GPHIGS  on\n          Silicon  Graphics  workstations. Scheduled for summer, 1993, Ver-\n          sion 3.0 of GPHIGS, the company's  PHIGS+  library  for  worksta-\n          tions,  will include an advanced PHIGS debugger that allows PHIGS\n          developers to display and browse PHIGS structures and other PHIGS\n          internal  state.  G5G  also  described  their Non-Duplicated Data\n          Store that stores pointers to application data in the GPHIGS  CSS\n          for  more  efficient  use  of  memory. In addition, G5G described\n          their application GSE that allows application callback  functions\n          during  GPHIGS traversal.  GPHIGS and PHIGURE, G5G's data visual-\n          izer and application development toolkit, are currently available\n          on  all  major  workstations  that support GL, X Windows, PEX, or\n          Starbase.\n\n          Wise Software presented a slide show of  Z-PHIGS  for  MS-Windows\n          and ARENA, a PHIGS based modeller/render. Z-PHIGS implements most\n          of the PHIGS+ primitives.  In addition Z-PHIGS has built in  many\n          advanced  rendering features like texture mapping, shadow genera-\n          tion, area quick updates and ray tracing. A demo disk of  Z-PHIGS\n          or ARENA is available on request.\n\n          ATC exhibited GRAFPAK-PHIGS, their full-featured PHIGS  implemen-\n          tation  based  on  DEC  PHIGS. GRAFPAK-PHIGS is available on most\n          workstation platforms with C, FORTRAN and Ada bindings and incor-\n          porates PEX support.\n\n          Within the booth sponsored by Advanced Technology Center, Digital\n          Equipment  Corporation demonstrated DEC PHIGS V2.4 running on the\n          DEC 3000/400 AXP PXG. ATCs' GRAFPAK-PHIGS is a port of DEC PHIGS.\n          DEC  PHIGS  V2.4 contains most PHIGS and PHIGS PLUS features with\n          support for PEX V5.1  protocol.  DEC  PHIGS  also  contains  most\n          GM/EDS   PHIGS  extensions  including  post-to-view  as  well  as\n          proprietary extensions to support immediate  mode  rendering  and\n          the use of PHIGS in an X11 environment.\n\n          AXP, DEC, and DEC PHIGS are trademarks of Digital Equipment  Cor-\n          poration.

Can anyone give me information or lead me to electronic information (not\nbooks; I'm too poor...) regarding programming the standard graphics modes?\n320x200x4 and 640x200x2 are easy enough, but I'm not so sure about the\nrest.  Something about planes or something, and writing to ports and the\nlike, but I don't know the numbers or anything -- for the 16 color modes, I\nthink.  If I'm wrong, let me know.  Also, 320x200x256 is just one byte/pixel;\nthat's easy enough, but are there any other ways to write to the screen,\nperhaps bytes at a time, or something like that?\n\nOf course, I'd appreciate any information about any mode....  which reminds\nme of another question -- do the SuperVGA modes work the same, generally,\nas the normal 16 and 256 color modes, or is not only the mode numbers\nfor various cards different, but the methods for writing to the screen\ndifferent as well?\n\nThanks for any help you can give me...  I'm developing a screen class for\nC++ and find myself searching for information.  Oh, I do have Ralf Brown's\nInterrupt List, which has given me tons of invaluable information already.\nIt just doesn't go into the screen programming details (except for the\nread/write pixel BIOS calls...\n\nThanks again.

The exhibition presents the untold story of the Vatican\nLibrary as the intellectual driving force behind the emergence of\nRome as a political and scholarly superpower during the\nRenaissance.  The exhibit will be on display in the Jefferson\nBuilding of the Library of Congress from January 8, 1993 through\nApril 30, 1993.  The online exhibit will be available by\nanonymous FTP indefinitely.\n\n     The exhibit is divided into nine (9) sections:  The Vatican\nLibrary, Archaeology, Humanism, Mathematics, Music, Medicine &\nBiology, Nature Described, A Wider World I: How the Orient Came\nto Rome, and A Wider World II: How Rome Went to China.  Each\nsection consists of its own sub-directory within the /exhibit\ndirectory and contains the exhibit text for that section and\nseparate JPEG image files for each object.  This online exhibit\nincludes not only objects from the Library of Congress exhibit,\nbut also the alternate objects (brought from Rome to be used if\nthere were a problem with one of the primary objects) and items\nomitted later in the planning process.\n\n     This exhibit will be of interest to Medieval and Renaissance\nscholars in particular, but also to art historians, historians of\nscience or medicine, early music scholars, students of the\nhumanist movement, students of printing and the printed word,\ntheologians, scholars of both Far and Near Eastern studies, and\nto librarians and information professionals.

:  \n: well, i have lots of experience with scanning in images and altering\n: them.  as for changing them back into negatives, is that really possible?\n\n: (stuff deleted)\n\n: jennifer urso:  the oh-so bitter woman of utter blahness(but cheerful\n: undertones)\n\nI use Aldus Photostyler on the PC and I can turn a colour or black and white\nimage into a negative or turn a negative into a colour or black and white\nimage.  I don't know how it does it but it works well.  To test it I scanned\na negative and used Aldus to create a positive.  It looked better than the\nprint that the film developers gave me.\n\n\n--
Does anyone know how to decode the color information of a NTSC signal ?\n\nI need to convert this data to RGB for a Video Capture Utility I am \nwriting for use with an IBM M-MOTION Video adapter card...\n\nI need to know the how the V and U signals work in the color process.\n\nThanks in advance for any information or algorythms etc.
: Has anyone else experienced anything like this?  If this just means that I\n: need to replace the screen then I guess I'll have to but I thought that the\n: "death" of my LCD screen would be a little less dramatic when it eventually\n: happened.  I didn't want to take it in to be repaired before I asked on the\n: net about this because I already know what they'll say: "Yep, you gotta have\n: this replaced and it's gonna cost you $???."\n\n: I've only had the computer for about 21 months.\n\n"Only"?!?  That's a long time! (echoing above posting)  The way the market\nis going nowadays, your machine's obsolete two weeks before you buy it. \nSounds like you'll have to sink *some* money into it for repair, but\nthat's sometimes necessary for equipment.\n\n: Is that a reasonable life\n: cycle for a LCD display?\n\nI think 21 months with nothing wrong until now is quite reasonable.  If\nyou had bought a Compaq or Toshiba, you might have reasonably expected the\nmachine to last longer before something went wrong; but that's a moot\npoint, perhaps.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nsandy santra                     _\/_              trevor@netcom.com\nberkeley, california              /\               trevor@well.sf.ca.us
This is almost certainly a MacBinary file which is an encoded version\nof a mac file so the Resource fork and Data fork get preserved.\nYou need a program that converts this to a regular file. If this is a\nmacbinary file, you may have downloaded it in Text mode and is probably\ncorrupt (if you did). If you're using FTP to transfer it at any point make sure\nyou type "binary" first.\n\nIf you can open the file with a text editor and find\n(This file must be converted with Bin....\nat the top, it is a BinHex file and can be decoded with\nBinHex 4.0 (among other programs).
I am looking for a means to add FLI and FLC animation creation\nto a Windows application.  I was hoping for something along the lines\nof AAWIN or AAPLAY by Autodesk but for the creation of these delta \ncompressed animations.  I have FLILIB but this seems to be coded for \nthe Large memory model of DOS with Turbo C. Ideally I would\nlike a DLL or Medium model object library, but would settle\nfor anything, really.  I've seen other Windows apps with\nFLI/FLC creation, did they hack the FLILIB code into submission?\n\nAny pointers would be appreciated, please send mail directly\nto me and I will summarize the results if there is interest.

Playmation is available direct from Anjon & Associates for $299.  It's hard\nto beat that price.  Also, you'd be better off with a newer version than\nan older version that had bugs that have long since been clobbered.
There is a review of 3DO in the latest "wired" magazine.  You may just want\nto take a trip to the local bookstore and check it out (there's some cool pics\ntoo).\n\n(I haven't read it yet, or I'd tell you more.. :-)
I heard a friend who just return from NAB from Las Vegas confirm\nthat RealSoft will be releasing a Windows version of REAL-3D 2.0\nthis summer.  He was told that the rendering speed on the DX50 isn't\nas fast as A4000.  However, he was also told that they are switching\nfrom Microsoft C++ to Watcom to gain more speed.  For people who is\nlooking for a powerful 3D animation software for PC.  The wait\nshouldn't be too long.  Real 3D 2.0 is absolutely the most powerful and\nflexible 3D package out there that sells for less than $1000.
It is true the convex algorithm is faster than a general concave/multi outline\nalgorithm, but not tremendously faster.  I spent awhile implementing and\noptimizing both flavors, and the convex turned out about 10% faster.  This is\nall C (on HP PA-RISC the compiler got the inner loop [shooting the span] as\nfast as possible, as far as I could tell).  For any sort of game the database\nto render is known ahead of time, and can be made all convex.  Definitely the\nway to go.\n\np.s. sorry but my code CANNOT be made public domain....\n	jesse
Yes, I have both Arts & Letters and CorelDraw.  I personally like\nArts & Letters better but there are things I like about Arts & Letters\nthat CorelDraw doesn't do an vice-versa.  I haven't found the perfect\ngraphics program that does everything yet.  \n\nMy favorite feature from CorelDraw is that it imports alot of different\nformats.  Arts & Letters does not.  I like the thousands of clipart\navailable with Arts & Letters.  However, I do find looking them up\nin a book and referencing them by number to be annoying.\n\nOne of my major problems is that there isn't any programs available on\nthe market for the artistically deprived :-).
Does anyone have any real experience with the Kubota Kenai/Denali\nseries of graphics workstations?  They pretty much blow the pants\noff SGI machines and Sun machines in the same price point, which\nis about 50,000 bucks.  Real nice stuff, but I've only seen the\nstuff on paper.  I'm wondering, is there anything NOT to like?  The\nspecs are too massive to get into here, but if a summary is desired\nI could be coaxed into uploading the spec sheet.
I currently have some grayscale image files that are not in any\nstandard format.  They simply contain the 8-bit pixel values.  I would\nlike to display these images on a PC.  The conversion to a GIF format\nwould be helpful.  This conversion can take place either on a PC\nor on a UNIX system and I could then download it to the PC.\nCan anyone suggest where I can find software to do this?  Alternatively, I\nmay have to write my own conversion program.  In this case, could someone\ntell me where I can find the GIF format specification?\n\nPlease e-mail me directly at: shayla@shannon.jpl.nasa.gov

Could you be more specific?  I need that file too but couldn't find it \namongst ALL the directories at wuarchive.
Look be consistent. First you post something that seems to suggest that you see\nxv being an 8 bit program as some sort of error. \nSo I post and asy it is not a bug, it is meant to be like that. \nSo you post and say it is not a bug, you never said it was, I have misunderstood\netc.\nNow you are saying:\n\n\nIf you would make up your mind what you are claiming it would make the\ndiscussion a *lot* easier.\n\n----------------\n\n\nEh? Sorry, I don't understand what you are saying here. I am aware that English is\nnot your native language and have tried hard to fathom your meaning, but this\nparagraph defeats me.\n\n\nYes *as I originally said*, global changes are easily possible.\n\nBut this statement contradicts what you said earlier: \n\n\n---------------\n\n\n\nNo I don't think so actually. \n\nYou were talking about loading a 24 bit image into xv (by quantising),\nmanipulating the colours in the colour editor, then somewhow applying these\nchanges to the 24 bit file when you exit xv. Xv lets you edit individual\ncolours. Where is this sudden jumping off the topic?\n\n\nYes I am aware there is no colourmap in a 24 bit file!!\n\n\nI do not understand what this statement is supposed to mean.\n\n\n???\nWhat are you saying\n???\n\n\nAh! now we see thew problem! First you want to extend xv to allow editing of 8\nbit previews of 24 bit images. Then I point out problems with this. Now you are\nsaying there is no problem because you, personally, happen not to use those\nparts of the program that cause the problem!!\n\n\n\nNot sure what you are saying here. Certainly one can make local changes.\n\n\nYes that is one possible approach. I would find a program that took such an\napproach clumsy, however.\n\n\nWell here we agree - you have not thought it through very much. You don't seem\nto have a consistent point to make and contradict yourself from one post to the\nnext. OK, we all have off days - perhaps you should step back and think this one\nthrough.\n\n\n\nAs I said in the last post, JPEG is a compression algorithm. It is a way of\nsaving disk space by trading off quality against compression. I fail to see what\nthe problem is. You have not proposed any workable alternatives.\n\n\nSpeak for yourself. You are the *only* person I have met or spoken to who,\nhaving quantised a 24 bit image down to 8 bits, expects this process to somehow\nreverse when the file is saved; keeping all modificvations that heve been made\nto the 8 bit image palette.\n\nPerhaps that is why you yused the singular?\n\n\nLook, next time you import a 24 bit image into xv look carefully at the main\ncontrol panel - it tells you how many colours have been allocated to the 8 bit\nimage. XV makes it abundantly clear that you are not editing the original 24 bit\nfile. You are the *only* person who claims this is confusing.\n\n\nIs a design error the same as a bug? ;-)\n\nRead my lips. XV is a program for viewing and modifying 8 bit images. It lets\nyou import other images. It shows, I would say, a good deal of thought about the\nhuman interface. And everyone else seems to use it happily for the purpose it\nwas designed for. It makes no false claims.\n\n\nIf you would come up with a solid, logical, well argued and lucid description of\nprecisely how these proposed extensions would work, feel free to post them. So \nfar, you have not done so.\n\n\nArgh!! After all this, a comment like that. `Very easily'. OK, go ahead and code it\nif it is so easy.\n\nOr alternatively, look up the terms `import' and 'non-reversible transformation'.\n\n\nI think this is a bit of an exageration.\n\nWhat you are actually saying is, you got into a lift (elevator, if you are in\nthe states ;-) ) and mistakenly pressed the down button to go up. Everyone else\nhad no problem. Now you are trying to sue the manufacturer...\n\n\nyou bet\n\n\nMostly. Leaving aside the language issue however, it betrays some very wooly\nthinking (as you yourself admit) which is the same in any language. Go think\nsome more.\n\n--\nChris Lilley\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTechnical Author, ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training Project\nComputer Graphics Unit, Manchester Computing Centre, Oxford Road, \nManchester, UK.

Please help.\n\nI have an IBM-compatible notebook computer with an LCD VGA screen.  While I\nwas working with it this morning, the screen started to flicker a little,\nwhich I thought was odd since I do use a surge-protector for my computer and\nall peripherals.  It only did this for a second and then stopped.\n\nI left the room for several minutes and, when I returned, the screen was\ncompletely dim, not blank, but very very dim.  The contrast slider still\nworked so that I could adjust it to where I could *faintly* make out what\nwas on the screen but the brightness slider had absolutely *no* effect.\n\nI was plugged-in at the time (i.e., not using the battery) but I still\ntried switching the battery, changing the power-saver features, etc., etc.,\nall to no avail.\n\nHas anyone else experienced anything like this?  If this just means that I\nneed to replace the screen then I guess I'll have to but I thought that the\n"death" of my LCD screen would be a little less dramatic when it eventually\nhappened.  I didn't want to take it in to be repaired before I asked on the\nnet about this because I already know what they'll say: "Yep, you gotta have\nthis replaced and it's gonna cost you $???."\n\nI've only had the computer for about 21 months.  Is that a reasonable life\ncycle for a LCD display?  Oh, I guess I ought to give specifics here: the\nbrand is Compudyne (Is this a reputable company?), it's a 386SX @ 20 MHz.\nI forget the model number exactly and I was too ticked off to write it down\nbefore coming in to work today.\n\nIf anyone can help me, PLEASE give me any advice you might have.  I'm not\nopposed to having it replaced, but I'd rather not if it's not absolutely\nnecessary.  If you wouldn't mind, please e-mail me at mike@mik.uky.edu\nbut if you'd rather post I'll be checking back here in a couple of days.\n\nBTW, if the answer to this question is already in a FAQ somewhere, feel\nfree to flame away but I would ask that you also include the location and\nname of the FAQ if you don't mind.\n\nThanks in advance for any help...

I don't know the answer the to this one, although with 8-bits I would assume\nthat it was one or the other.\n\n\nAccording to the literature, it will do quadruple buffering so that you\ncan have double buffered stereo output.
There are JPEG viewers that are windows based and therefore need no hardware\nspecific drivers beyond those provided in windows. I got mine from the Library\nof Congress in connection with their online exhibit of books from the Vatican\nlibrary. See a previous message in this newgroup about that.

When you run this program, you will enter 'read' menu. Whthin this\n      menu you can press any function key. If you move or copy\n      files, you will enter 'write' menu. the 'write' menu is much like\n      'read' menu, but only allow you to change directory.\n      The header line in 'read' menu includes "(d:xx,f:xx,t:xx)".\n        d : display type. f: number of files. t: number of tagged files.\n      pressing SPACE in 'read' menu will let you select which format to use\n        for reading current file.\n      pressing RETURN in 'read' menu will let you reading current file. This\n        program will automatically determine which format this file is.\n        The procedure is: First, check magic number. If fail, check\n        standard extension. Still fail, report error.\n      pressing s or S in 'read' menu will do 'Slide Show'.\n        If delay time is 0, program will wait until you hit a key\n          (except ESCAPE).\n        If any error occurs, program will make a beep.\n+       'w' or 'W' to pause, any key to continue.\n        ESCAPE to terminate.\n      pressing Ins in 'read' menu will change display type.\n      pressing ALT-X in 'read' menu will quit program without prompting.\n+     pressing F5 will turn on 'effect' menu.\n\n   2.

Some questions are format-dependent. Finally This program\n        will prompt you a filename. If you want to save file under another\n        directory other than current directory, please press SPACE. after\n        pressing SPACE, you will enter 'write2' menu. You can change\n        directory to what you want. Then,\n\n        pressing SPACE: this program will prompt you 'original' filename.\n        pressing RETURN: this program will prompt you 'selected' filename\n                      (filename under bar).\n\n\n  3. This program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.\n\n  4. This Program is MEMORY GREEDY. If you don't have enough memory,\n     the performance is poor.\n\n  5. If you want to save 8 bits image :\n       try GIF then TIFF(LZW) then TARGA then Sun Raster then BMP then ...\n\n     If you want to save 24 bits image (lossless):\n       try TIFF(LZW) or TARGA or ILBM or Sun Raster\n       (No one is better for true 24bits image)\n\n  6.

I have a very large (3x5 feet) file in Macintosh Canvas v2.something\nwhich I need to import into AutoCad 12 in the least disk-space intensive\nway possible.  (i.e. EPS is a big problem, since it took 1.3 MEG to encode\none page of the document)  The file is entirely lines and words.  I have\naccess to networked Macs & PC's, and ftp.  Can anyone suggest how this might\nbe accomplished?  Email replies, if you would, I don't read this group much.\nThanks in advance.
O\n\nI also would like code or algorithms to do this.\n\nIn fact, I am interested in sources for code and/or algorithms that\nconvert 2D graphical objects into other 2D graphical objects that\nwill render into the same image. i.e. Bezier curves to B splines,\nor splines to circular arc segments, or B splines to polgons, etc...

as far as simply mapping your logo or whatever onto a cube or sphere, \nit's quite easy. Just either copy the GIF you want mapped into the map \ndirectory or add a map path to the directory where it currently is. Then \ngo into the materials editor and make a new material with that as the bit \nmap, voila.. \n\n__________________________________________________________________________\n   |       /         |\\n   | H E   \ Y B E R |/ E N            [ zippy@cyberden.sf.ca.us ]

Yup.\n\nMost JPEG viewers seem to require specific video drivers since they support\nonly specific video cards. Some have the standard IBM BIOS video support for\nthe VGA 320x200 256 colour mode, but they leave out the other cards such as\nthe Hercules monochrome card (which by the way can give very good picture\nquality if your dithering works right).\n\nI can't remember the name of a JPEG viewer since I usually convert JPEG's to\nGIF's before viewing them. But some require VESA driver for the video cards.\nYou don't need any special hardware to view JPEG's except perhaps for a VGA\ncard and maybe a 286+ processor. Most people these days program for 286+\ncomputers and neglect the rest of the 86 processors (8086, 8088). I have a\n8088 clone (a NEC V20 processor) and a Hercules card, I have had to write\nsome programs so that they will view GIF's and animations for the VGA and other\ncolour graphics boards on my monochrome Hercules card. I use Floyd-Steinberg\ndithers and have found that if one does something neat with the colour palette\nthe resulting dithered image gives much greater detail than it normally would\nwhen viewed on other monochrome systems. CompuShow 8.50 has FS dithering but\nit does the standard thing with the image palette before dithering, my way\ngives a brighter more detailed image.\n\nAnyway, enough of my rambling in the wrong direction. The final point is, as\nfar as I know, you don't need extra hardware to view JPEG's other than the\nVGA (and perhaps a 286 or better)\n\nHave a day!
I am happy to announce the first public release of the bit program,\n   an INTERACTIVE, FULL COLOR image viewer and editor based on SGI GL.\n   Besides typical touchup tasks, such as crop, rotate, smooth, etc,\n   bit offers some unique features not available in similar programs,\n   such as text and vector support and the separation of text and image.\n\n   The following is the relevant sections from the man page. \n   -----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPre-Release of May, 1993                                       BIT(1L)\n\nNAME\n   bit - Bitmap Image Touchup for SGI Workstations\n\nDESCRIPTION\n  bit is an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on\n  Silicon Graphics GL. As a full color program, bit handles images of both\n  24bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner.\n\n  As an image viewer, bit allows list of images to be displayed in their\n  original type (24bits or color index) in any order and in any of the\n  many built-in styles of display. You can walk up and down the list using\n  mouse and keyboard, or you can let bit do the walk for you (The\n  SlideShow).  With the pan and zoom features, large images can be viewed\n  in full without being limited by the window or screen size.\n\n  As an image editor, bit performs a large number of image editing and\n  processing tasks accurately and efficiently. It keeps information loss\n  at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing\n  subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type\n  whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion and/or quantization of\n  input images. You can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into\n  another.  In addition, arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple\n  geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with\n  the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take\n  advantage of the higher printer resolutions (e.g. PostScript).\n\n  Bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing\n  image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence\n  turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be\n  accessed by a press of a button, and best of all, the processed image\n  will be read back and displayed immediately. Convolution using exter-\n  nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically\n  giving great flexibility in processing an image.\n\nFEATURES\n\n  Bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a\n  continuous progress report, and once the processing is complete, \n  the processed image will be displayed.\n\n  Current features include\n\n  o Rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti-aliasing\n    and filling the "rotated out" region with an arbitrary color.\n\n  o Scales an image by arbitrary factors in x- and/or y-directions with\n    the option of subpixel sampling.\n\n  o Renders text of arbitrary color, size or orientation on top of an\n    image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving\n    the text and raster separately, such as into a PostScript file, to\n    take advantage of a higher printer resolution. Besides normal text\n    strings, many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as\n    in TeX(1), e.g., $\alpha$\small$\beta$ produces Greek alphabet alpha\n    followed by a slightly smaller Greek alphabet beta.\n\n  o Presents graphically the histogram of an image.\n\n  o Performs arbitrary 1-to-1 pixel transformation.  The transformation\n    function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary\n    forms. Further, the transformation can be applied to RGB channels\n    separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of\n    it. Many difficult tasks, such as thresholding, can be accomplished\n    rather easily by 1-to-1 transformation in combination with the avai-\n    lability of graphical histograms of the image.\n\n  o Places simple geometric figures (SGFs), e.g., arrows, circles, trian-\n    gles etc., of arbitrary color, size and orientation into an image at\n    arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some\n    user definable coordinate system units, with the option of rendering\n    directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately (e.g,\n    PostScript file). All SGFs can be scaled in x- and y-directions\n    independently or simultaneously (this is how to get an ellipse from a\n    circle).\n\n  o Performs edge detection. In combination with image histograms and 1-\n    to-1 transformation, very accurate result can be obtained.\n\n  o Performs histogram equalization.\n\n  o Performs convolution with externally defined (square) matrices of\n    arbitrary order.\n\n  o Crops a rectangular portion of an image.\n\n  o Cuts and pastes across images.\n\n  o Magnifies any portion of an image by any amount.\n\n  o Displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause\n    interval between images. (SlideShow)\n\n  o Measures RGB intensities of a pixel at any location or all pixels\n    along an arbitrary line with the result presented as RGB intensities\n    or as an intensity vs. distance plot.\n\n  o Performs image type conversions.\n\n  o Converts image formats.\n\n  o Smoothes an image (Special convolution).\n\n  o Filters an image by external programs and read the filtered image\n    back and display it.\n\n  o Modify an individual pixel's RGB values.\n\n  o Performs FFT on the entire image or a portion of it and display the\n    resulting power spectra.\n\n  o Spray and brush paint in full color (unavailable in this pre-release).\n\n SUPPORTED FORMATS\n      o  IRIS RGB, native to SGI IRIS\n      o  JPEG(JFIF) format\n      o  CompuServ GIF\n      o  PNM(Portable Any Map), including PPM, PGM and PBM.\n      o  XBM (X Window Bitmap)\n      o  TIFF\n      o  PostScript(Write only)\n\nHardware requirements:\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n   Any SGI workstation that supports RGBmode(), including indigoes.\n\nWhere to get it:\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n   anonymous ftp to monte.svec.uh.edu   /pub/bit/bitxxx.tar.Z\n   where xxx is the version number. Current version is 0.73\n\n   Read src/01Readme for installation instructions after unpacking\n\nAcknowledgement:\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n   JPEG support is based on the Independent JPEG groups's library Version 4.\n   FORMS library, developed by Mark Overmars, is used for GUI.\n   Both JPEG and FORMS library are included in this release.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n  Bit is the program you will ever need to view and annotate\n  images; The built-in editing features will satisfy most of\n  your editing needs. In addition, the external filter and dynamical\n  kernel will utilize any program you already have. So try it\n  (and you will like it).
hi netters,\n\n	I'm doing a project which is about image analysis.  Firstly, I\nhave to find out any restrictions or limitations on the colour display\non various kind of workstations, they are DECstation, HP, Amiga, Apollo.\n\n	Secondly, I read from some graphic texts that image is displayed\nin 24 bites(please point out to me if I got it wrong).  But, the images\nwhich I will deal with are displayed in 16 bites by the software they\nare using currently.  So, will there be any problems to display them\nunder X-windows in the future? Because we are thinking to implement the\nGUI by X-windows for our project\n\n\n	Is there any person here can help me to solve the problem or\nquery above?  Or, give me some advice or suggestion where I can find\nthem out. \n\n	Please send me an e-mail if there are any.  Thanks in advance.\n\n\n\n						Yours\n			\n						Christine Chan
I was at avalon today and found texture maps in some "tex" and "txc"\nformat, something I've never encountered before.  These are obviously\nnot tex or  LaTeX files.\n\nIF you have a clue how I can convert these to something\nreasonable, please let me know.
This is an invitation to send articles to the Informatica magazine.\nThe first fully international issue has been published and echoes \nare quite favourable. For any information, contact (matjaz.gams@ijs.si). \n\nDear Colleague,                                        April 25, 1993\n\nNumber 1 of volume 17 of Informatica is now out of print and some of you \nwill receive it in a week or so. As you will see, the journal is structured\nin the following way: the editorial (first page); profiles (second page\n-- biography of an editor, in this issue, Terry Winograd); the edited\npart of papers (pp. 3-80); mission and research reports (A plan for\nknowledge archives project in Japan and CSLI in Stanford, pp. 81-100);\nand news and announcements (pp. 101-108). This structure is mentioned to\ngive you a suggestion how could you help to make the contents of the\njournal significant, diverse, and interesting, bringing your own views\ninto the discourse.\n   A great emphasis is given to the so-called editorial page. This page\nexpresses an opinion (belief) of the writing editor to some problems\nwithin the scope of computing and informatics, extending into other\nconcerning disciplines, e.g. cybernetics, advanced AI, cognitive sciences,\nmind, informationally concerned neural sciences, advanced technology \n(e.g. photonics), etc. I asked professor Terry Winograd to write this\npage for Number 2. I certainly would appreciate very much to get\nsuggestions or possible offers from other editors, who like to express\ntheir strong (directed) beliefs concerning a future development of the\narea in question.\n   On the second page of each Number an editor's profile is published.\nThe aim of the profile is twofold: to show his/her professional \nachievements, interests, scientific, and philosophical orientation on\none side; to narrate his/her life story in the environments in which\neditors has lived and live on the other side. This kind of story should\nbe instructive, adequately factically faced, contributing to the \nunderstanding of circumstances in which editors have to act and live.\n   The edited part (edited papers) is still critical. I would like to have\na stock of accepted papers in advance, so the issuing dates of a particular\nnumber can be fixed (e.g. January, April, July, and October). In situation\nright now, I ask you to help me with contributions of yours or your\ncolleagues, collaborators, students, etc. Some critical views to the\ncontemporary development of computing and informatics are appreciated.\nA special emphasis should be given also to originality by which fresh\nideas are coming into the circulation of different professional communities.\n   Reports of different occasions (symposia, conferences, meetings, etc.)\nand particularly on new books, papers, and interesting events are welcome.\nYou can send these news immediately (also by your secretary) by e-mail.\nOn the other hand, you can send books and other publications (annual\nreports, journals, calls for papers, etc.) for reviewing and publishing\nin Informatica. We in the editorial staff will manage the rest.\n   E-mail is functioning satisfactorily, so please use it in every respect.\nYou can submit editorial notes, profiles, reports, news and even complete\npapers written in standard LaTex format (especially formulas). We received\nseveral final (corrected) texts in Number 1 from different sites (US,\nRussia, etc.). In this way, you can compose reports from already typed\ntexts, using your own choice and editing, and submit them to the contact\nperson (matjaz.gams@ijs.si), who is always being on your disposal. So,\nyou will receive a prompt confirmation and any information concerning\nour common interest and job.\n\nAt the end, please do not forget: we need your cooperation and help in\nevery mentioned respect. The aim of Informatica is to open various\npossibilities of communication concerning strong scientific and \nphilosophical orientations as well as those coming up, still unrevealed,\nand on the way to become significant. Please, do not apprehend to give\nproposals, suggestions, and, certainly, contributions via the e-mail\nand by other means.\n\nSincerely yours,
Nah... I figure most people would be so busy reading that they wouldn't\nhave *time* to post. :-) :-) :-)\n\n							spl
Certainly. Reference follows. \n\nBear in mind that there are at least two conditions which may be called\nred/green colour blind. One, protanopia, is caused by a lack or major\ndysfunction of the L cones, those that respond best to long\nwavelengths. This gives much reduced red/green and red/violet discrimination and\nalso means that reds look dimmer than than they do to people with normal vision.\n\nThe other, deuteranopia, is due to missing or dysfunctional M cones although it\ncan also be caused by a lack of the L-M cone difference signals in the retina.\nIt also gives reduced red/green discrimination but red/violet is unaffected. \nUnlike protanopia, reds are not dimmer than  normal.\n\nOn a uniform chromaticity diagram - the horseshoe shaped one you see in computer\ngraphics books - there is a single confusion point for each type of colour\ndeficiency. Colours which are confused lie on straight lines radiating from this\npoint. For protanopia the point is at u'=0.61,v'=0.51, very close to the far red\ncorner. For deuteranopia, the point is at u'=-4.75, v'=1.31\n\nNote that different experimental investigations in the literature give slightly\ndifferent values for these depending on the precise details of the experimental\nsetup, random errors, and so on. The values quoted are typical.\n\nSo if all colours on a line are seen as the same, which colour is actually seen?\n\nThis problem has now been solved. Tests on people with one normal eye and one\naffected eye have shown that there is an axis for each type of disorder onto\nwhich all the colours collapse. For protanopes this joins up 473nm and 574nm on\nthe spectral locus (the edge of the horseshoe); for deuteranopes the line is\nvery similar,  joining 477nm and 579nm.\n\n*So* to convert colours from normal vision to a simulated protanopia or\nduuteranopia:\n\n1) Plot the colour on a uniform chromaticity diagram\n2) Construct a line from this point to the appropriate confusion point\n3) Find the intersection of this line with the appropriate axis line\n4) This is the new chromaticity. \n\nThe best reference for this is Meyer, G.W. & Greenberg, D.P. (1988) 'Colour\ndefective vision and computer graphics displays', IEEE Computer Graphics and\nApplications 8(5) 28-40.\n\nYou will also need a decent reference on basic colour science if you are not\nfamiliar with the CIE XYZ colour model and the uniform chromaticity scale diagram.\n\n\nYes this is certainly possible. You will need the chromaticities of the red\ngreen and blue phosphors of the monitor you intend to display the images on, and\nthe chromaticity of the white point. This information can be measured, or\nobtained from the manufacturer. I posted a list of some monitor chromaticities a\ncouple of weeks ago.\n\nThe procedure, for each pixel (!) is as follows. (Some lookup tables might be a\nhelp here.)\n\nA) convert RGB to CIE XYZ. This is a simple 3*3 matrix multiplication once you\nhave the monitor data.\nB) retaining the Y component for later, convert XYZ to chromaticity coordinates u'v'\nusing u' = 4X/(X+15Y+3Z), v' = 9Y/(X+15Y+3Z)\nC) find the equation of the line as in step 2 above\nD) find the intersection as in step 3\nE) convert back from u'v' to XYZ, using the Y value from step A\nF) Ensure that this new colour can be displayed on your monitor; if not, move it\nalong a line in XYZ space towards neutral grey (ie half way between black and\nwhite) until it is displayable.\n\n\nDone; also posted for the rest of us.\n\n--\nChris Lilley\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTechnical Author, ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training Project\nComputer Graphics Unit, Manchester Computing Centre, Oxford Road, \nManchester, UK.

I am very interested in hearing from all of you who are using or implementing\n3-D interactive applications what types of 3-D widgets you would\nlike to have in your applications.  \n\nA 3-D widget is usually located in the same scene as other 3-D objects of the \napplication.  It may let you\n\n- manipulate application data, the camera,\n  3-D objects in the scene and so on, or\n- view the status of the application or 3-D objects\n  via the widget's shape, color, position, orientation and so on, or\n- do whatever I missed but you think is possible.\n\nFor example, a manipulative widget can be virtual trackball (shown as a\npartially transparent sphere) super-imposed on the object to be rotated.\nA feedback widget can be a ruler with ends anchored to 2 objects.  The length\nof the ruler changes as the objects move and a numeric value is shown on the\nruler indicating the distance.  A widget can provide both manipulation and\nfeedback.  For example, the ruler can be used to change the distance between\nthe objects along its own axis.\n\n\nPlease e-mail me or post your opinions on 3-D interaction.  The information\nI gathered will help me design a 3-D UI construction tool.\nYour help is very much appreciated.

Perhaps all of us hackers have become (ICK) PROFESSIONALS?  I have noticed\nmy and my associates progression from hackers to computer professionals.\nIt is rather distasteful.  It occurs when a series of things happen:\n\n   1) one's ego outgrows one's talent/knowledge\n   2) one's financial situation takes precedence\n   3) A change in priorities (esp. family) possibly leading to 2)\n   4) the hacker's attitude makes the shift from "fun" to "work"\n   5) one's vocation burns away the creativity needed for "the hobby"\n\nor the biggest killer (IMO)\n\n   6) one's dreams are (sadly) shattered on the hard rocks of society's\n      version of reality.  Without the dream the motivation dies, without\n      the motivation the effort seems useless.\n\nAnother set of problems stems from our children.  While most of us remember\nwhen there were several completely different computer systems, our children\nare growing up with just a few choices (MSDOS/Mac/Amiga) and do not enjoy\nthe diversity we did.  I remember the great computer fallout of the early\neighties vividly as I was forced to stop using skills developed for systems\nthat were now dead.  The diversity of systems before then allowed for widely\ndivergent paradigms.  That period forced hackers to continually learn new\nsystems in the attempt to keep up.  Not to mention that if a program was\nneeded we were forced (in most situations) to write it ourselves as a\ncommercial offering was just not available.  Now our children are being\ntaught the "user" mentality.  As the number of us "old-timers" dwindle we are\nnot being replaced by the next generation.\n\nKendall.\n-- \n   Kendall Sears                           krsear02@ulkyvx.louisville.edu\n   Programmer                             ///\n   Child Development Unit                /// Amiga\n   Department of Pediatrics          \\\/// Currently running AmigaOS 3.0\n   University of Louisville           \XX/ And Supporting Unix Sys V Rev 4.

Dear Netters:\n\n\nI am looking for C source code to test if a 3D point lies within a\n\nconcave polyhadra. I have read a few articles about this and know\n\nthat two solutions exist: parity counting and angle sumation. Both\n\n\nideas are pretty simple but coding is not. So I wonder if there exists\n\npublic domain source code for this.\n\n    Another 'rough' solition (don't care special cases) is ray-casting\n\nwhich is reported to be more or less independent of number of faces\n\nconsisting the polyhedra if a special space indexing is used\n(M. Tamminen, et. al., 1984. "Ray-casting and block model conversion\nusing a spatial index". Computer-Aided-Designs. 4, 1984, 60-65).\nBut the prerequirement is that all the facets of polyhedra have their\nnormal pointing outside of polyhedra. How this could be done in practice ?\nI have a set of trangles consisting the polyhedra. How could I ensure their\nnormals pointing outside the polyhedra ? The paper mentioned above assumed\nthis is already the case.\n\n\n   I have also read some standard computer graphics textbook about hidden\nline removal. It says "if we make the rule that the normal of a facet pointing\n\ntoward viewer standing far away from the polyhedra...". Again how to make\nsure ?\n\n\n   Any pointers are welcome ?\n\n\n   Yaohong Jiang\n   Queen's University\n   Kingston, Ont.
Does anyone know if the source is available to create FLI\nor FLC animations? I would ideally like DLL's for Windows\nbut would settle for C source.  I've heard they might be \navailable on Amiga forums somewhere.  The libraries\ncurrently distributed by Autodesk, AAWIN, AAPLAY, do NOT\nhave FLI creation capability, only playback.\n\nAny pointers would be appreciated, thanks!

This 1:1M database has been produced from\n  the Defense Mapping Agency's ONCs and will be available, together with\n  searching and viewing software, on a number of CD-ROMs later this summer. ]\n\n  Check into HANAUMA.STANFORD.EDU and UCSD.EDU (see ftp list above)\n  The CIA database consists of coastlines, rivers and political boundaries\n  in the form of line strokes. Also on hanauma.stanford.edu is a 720x360\n  array of elevation data, containing one ieee floating point number for\n  every half degree longitude and latitude.\n \n  A program for decoding the database, mfil, can be found on the machine\n  pi1.arc.umn.edu (137.66.130.11).\n  There's another program, which reads a compressed CIA Data Bank file and\n  builds a PHIGS hierachical structure.

Suggested is an SCSI port for\n  speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, #3 :\n  scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll\n  house supplies.\n  So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don't have\n  scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.\n\nBooks with textures:\n--------------------\n  Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.\n  Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also\n  a wide variety of stock art is available.\n  Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock,\n  UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available.\n\n  In Italy, there's a company called Belvedere that makes such books\n  for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your\n  graphics work.

Introduction to rendering algorithms\n========================================\n\na. Ray-Tracing:\n---------------\n\n  I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read\n  some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would\n  suggest:\n   An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press\n     1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4\n  Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you can't be wrong\n  using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines\n  (erich@eye.com)\n\nThere's a more concise reference also:\n\n  Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill: "An Introduction to Ray Tracing", in\n  "Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD", ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw,\n  NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988.\n\nIt contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.\n\nb.

Teapot ?\n-----------\n\n"Displays on Display" column of IEEE CG&A Jan '87 has the whole\nstory about origin of the Martin Newell's teapot. The article also has\nthe bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe\nmodel of the teapot.\n\nIEEE CG&A Sep '87 in Jim Blinn's column "Jim Blinn's Corner" describes\nan another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations for\nexample are used.\n\nThe OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so you're advised to get\nthem to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles at\na specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch).\nThe SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a\ntessellation at any specified resolution.\n\nb. Space Shuttle ?\n------------------\n\nTolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttle\ndatafiles. Here's a summary (From his sci.space list):\n\nmodel1:\nA modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)\n\n406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.)\n389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex).\nPayload doors non-existent.\nUnits: unknown.\n\nSimon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. He\nsaid there is no proprietary information associated with it.\n\nmodel2:\nThe newsgroup model, in OFF format. You can find it in\n\ngondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo\nhanauma.stanford.edu ,  /pub/graphics/Comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data\n\nmodel3:\nThe triangles' model.\n\nThis model is stored in several files, each defining portions of the model.\n\nGreg Henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy.  He did\nnot mention any restriction on the model's distribution.\n\nmodel4:\nThe NASA model.\n\nThe file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers,\ndefining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations:\n\n<x offset> <y offset> <z offset>\n\nFrom then on, the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions\n\n3473 vertices.\n2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex,\n 10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex,\n 17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex).\nPayload doors closed.\nUnits: inches.\n\nJon Berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model\nProprietary info: unknown\n\nmodel5:\nThe old shuttle model.\n\nThe file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.\n\n104 vertices.\n452 polygons (11 3-vertex, 41 4-vertex).\nPayload doors open.\nUnits: meters.\n\nWe have been using this model at STAR Labs, Stanford University, for\nsome years now.

Image annotation software\n=============================\n\na. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in\n  rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored\n  in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a\n  rasterfile.\n\nb. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some\n  image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I'm not\n  sure exactly what they are.\n  You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.\n\nc. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)\n  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats\n  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert\n  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.\n  Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu\n  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)\n\nd. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).\n  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all\n  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.\n\ne. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output\n  bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.\n\nf.

This was\n  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working\n  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL\n  or would be willing to buy it.  It's a few thousand dollars (American) I\n  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general\n  purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.\n  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose\n  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I\n  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh\n  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image\n  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've\n  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best\n  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large\n  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a\n  freebie if you want it"\n\n  "My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,\n  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its\n  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It\n  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing\n  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even\n  Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH\n  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which\n  that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use\n  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical\n  image processing which I've been doing. This means image enhancement,\n  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image\n  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity\n  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve\n  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.)

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)\n===================================================\n\nGRASS\n-----\n  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army\n  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and\n  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a\n  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,\n  although it is reported to have significant image processing\n  capabilities.\n\n  Feature Descriptions\n\n  I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the\n  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source\n  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass\n  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using\n  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who\n  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very\n  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software." A first review  of\n  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel\n  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose\n  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in\n  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the\n  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric\n  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective\n  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus\n  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them\n  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68\n\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh\n  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for\n  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC\n  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,\n  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster\n  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it\n  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented\n  in raster (grid-cell) form.\n\n  Availability\n\n  CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:\n  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).\n\n  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to\n  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.\n\n  This location will be the new "canonical" source for GRASS software, as\n  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.\n  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and\n  "tar" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John\n  Parks' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,\n  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review\n  it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently\n  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be\n  directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu\n\n  Support\n\n  Listserv mailing lists:\n\n  grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level\n  questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send\n  subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\n\n  grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level\n  questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation\n  of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to\n  grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\n\n  Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of\n  the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in\n  Champaign, IL).

Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager\n  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a\n  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.\n\n  Feature Description\n\n  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.\n  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a\n  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).\n  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.\n  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering\n  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,\n  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages\n  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band\n  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.\n\n  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle\n  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available\n  for GIS applications.\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)\n  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software\n  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.\n\nPCI\n---\n  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes\n  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of\n  remote sensing data in eight or ten different "industry standard"\n  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I\n  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix\n  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly\n  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.\n\n  The "PCI software" consists of several classes/groups/packages of\n  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common "PCI\n  database" disk file.  The "Tape I/O" package is a set of utility\n  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape\n  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the "PCI database" file;\n  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can\n  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several\n  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap\n  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type\n  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically\n  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and\n  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.\n  "multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5"), and\n  God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't\n  use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your\n  particular application/interest calls for.\n\n  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight "parameters," read from\n  a common "parameter file" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your "default\n  directory."  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same\n  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting\n  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a\n  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to\n  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,\n  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also\n  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's\n  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled\n  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI\n  data structures (database file, parameter file).\n\n  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but\n  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the\n  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle\n  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a\n  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the\n  Macintosh calls "raw") data from tape, in a number of different\n  "interleave" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the\n  graphic-arts industry's "CT2T" format, would probably (I haven't tried)\n  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT\n  YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start\n  over.  It's worth noting that the PCI "database" file is designed to\n  contain not only "raster" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map\n  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of\n  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often\n  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,\n  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this\n  can go into the PCI "database").\n\n  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX\n  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific\n  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to\n  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would\n  display directly from a PCI "database" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus\n  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be "overkill"\n  in your case; it seems designed for the very "high end"\n  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice\n  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's\n  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which\n  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe\n  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these\n  areas.\n\nSPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)\n--------------------------------\n  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis\n  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed\n  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels\n  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since\n  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging\n  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.\n\n  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and\n  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).\n  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement\n  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.\n\n  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may\n  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame\n  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you're interested.  PCW requires X\n  for display.\n\nMAP II\n------\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.\n\nCLRview\n-------\n  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit\n  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.\n\n  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the\n  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports\n  the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF,\n  TIN, DEM, Lattices, and Arc/Info Coverages among others.\n\n  CLRview can be obtained from explorer.dgp.utoronto.ca (128.100.1.129) \n  in the directory pub/sgi/clrview.\n\n  Contact:\n  Rodney Hoinkes\n  Head of Design Applications\n  Centre for Landscape Research\n  University of Toronto\n  Tel:   (416) 978-7197\n  Email: rodney@dgp.utoronto.ca\n\n==========================================================================\n\nEnd of Resource Listing

We here at IBM have the same problem with our workstations.  I was also\nshocked when I first realized that you have to offset lines from fills by\nabout 16 bits (assuming 24 bit z buffer).  This seems huge, but is only\n1/256 of the dynamic range.  In those terms it doesn't seem so bad.  What\nis happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear, due\nmainly to roundoff, I believe.  So the polygon is not planar in z, but is\nmore like a Ruffles potato chip.  Ditto with lines.  When you start/end at\ndifferent x/y values, the "ridges" are out of phase, resulting in the\nstitch effect.  You have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygon\nright on top of another, but with different vertices.  You will likely see\na smeared effect where they overlap.\n  Example:\n  Try Polygon 1: (100,100,100) (100,200,100) (200,200,100) (200,100,100)\n      Polygon 2: (125,125,100) (125,175,100) (175,175,100) (175,125,100)\n\nYour implementation is correct.  In fact, we do a similar trick when\nrendering primitives that have lines and polygons - such as NURBS surfaces\nwith isoparametric lines.  Without the trick, the lines appear stitched, as\nyou say.  When the application draws lines/polygons independently, the\nsystem does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting, so the\napplication must do it.  This is what you have discovered and are doing.\nBravo!\n\n(Note to IBM'ers:  The information given here has been previously disclosed\nthrough proper channels so I'm not giving away any new unpublished info.)
Speaking of SIGGRAPH, I just went through the ordeal of my annual registration\nfor SIGGRAPH and re-upping of membership in the ACM last night, and was I ever\ngrossed out!  The new prices for membership are almost highway robbery!\n\nFor example:\n\n	SIGGRAPH basic fee went from $26 last year to $59 this year for the same\n	thing, a 127% increase.  Those facile enough to arrange a trip to the\n	annual conference could reduce this to $27 by selecting SIGGRAPH Lite,\n	which means SIGGRAPH is charging an additional $32 (or so) for the\n	proceedings and the art show catalog, essentially.\n\n	TOPLAS went up 40% in cost, way outstripping the current inflation rate.\n\n	Basic SIGCHI fees remainded the same, but whereas before SIGCHI\n	membership included UIST and Human Factors conferences proceedings,\n	these are now an extra cost option.  Bundling that back into the basic\n	rate, equivalent services have gone up 100% in cost.\n\n	SIGOIS membership cost has up 33%, but they've also split out the\n	Computer Supported Cooperative Work conference proceedings that used to\n	be included with membership.  Adding that cost back in means this SIG\n	also has doubled its membership fee.\n\nWhat really galls me is that the ACM sent out brochures a couple months ago\ntouting their new approach to providing member services, and tried to make it\nsound like they were offering NEW services.  But with the exception of a couple,\nlike SIGGRAPH, all the "plus" services appear to be just splitting the costs\ninto smaller piles so that they don't look so big.  But their recommended\nchanges to my membership would have me paying 90% more than last year for a 31%\nincrease in services (measured by cost, not by value), and, curiously, a 31%\ninflation rate on the publications I got last year.\n\nIs anyone out there as galled by this extortion as I am?\n________________________________________________________________________________\nRobert Reed			Home Animation Ltd.		503-656-8414\nrobert@slipknot.rain.com	5686 First Court, West Linn, OR 97068\n\nSHOOTING YOURSELF IN THE FOOT IN VARIOUS LANGUAGES AND SYSTEMS
I am unable to run Quicktime 1.5 on my IIvx running System 7.1, and\n	I don't know why. (If there is a better group to post this to, please\n	let me know.) Quicktime 1.0 works fine, but when I try to run a movie\n	in any application that supports it, Like Simple Player, Canvas or\n	Word, I get the message "sorry a system error occurred '<Application>'\n	unimplemented trap <continue> <restart>", I press <continue> and get\n	"The application 'unknown' has unexpectedly quit, because an error of\n	type 12 occurred." Substitute Simple Player or Canvas or Word for\n	'<Application>, and the messages are always the same. If I restart with\n	Quicktime 1.0, I have no problems. Any suggestions?

A great many computer programmers read "Dr. Dobb's Journal".  In a recent\nissue, there was a paragraph in an article that pained me greatly to read.  It\n\n  "There's nothing wrong if Microsoft setting the standards for the computer\nindustry.  The industry NEEDS an IBM for the 90's."\n\n  Where has the hacker ethic gone?  Not the "cracker" ethic, which is something\nentirely different and bad, but the hacker ethic, which tells us to value the\nfree distribution of information and yield to the hands-on imperative?  Why is\nit that people and corporations like Bill Gates, IBM, and Intel are able to\nhave a virtual dead lock on the computer industry?  Why is it that, if a person\nlike myself posts messages to Usenet on how to get into the little nooks,\ncrannies, and idiosyncrasies of a computer system, they are not given any\nuseful information by those who know, just a badmouthing? (or are completely\nignored)  Why is it that people like Steve Jobs have to abandon their efforts to\nmake truly innovative products?  I ask those of you who call yourselves\nhackers, why is this?  And further, how can you let it go on?  It is a fact\nthat the computer industry has changed the world, and shall continue to do so\nfor a long time to come.  It has allowed the propagation of information in a\nvolume unheard of even twenty years ago, and has made this world even smaller\nthan it was before.  I shudder to think what that world will be like if the\ncorporations are allowed to have their way, perpetuating more drivel like the\n286, Windows, and the IBM product line on the computer-using public.  \n\n  That is not to say I am against business per se; people who profit off of\ninnovative, intelligent, creative designs do not bother me.  In fact, I applaud\nit; that is the American way.  But those who manage to sell kludgy, uncreative\nsystems to the public, and profit off of them, are the ones who are the\nproblem.  And, unfortunately, because they have enough money to make up for\nblunt stupidity, they can keep doing it for a very long time.\n\n  I put it to you thus:  Where HAS the hacker ethic gone?  If it still exists,\nwhere?  And, if it DOES exist, why are those who call themselves "hackers"\nallowing this to perpetuate itself?  Why are they not creating new, innovative,\ninteresting ideas to stop the SOS from maintaining its choke hold on the\ncomputer industry?\n\n  I await with interest what will probably be a resounding silence.

Hello all,\n   I need to make  some torso 3D scans and would like the phone numbers of\ncompanies in the midwest that make scans, and the numbers of companies that\nmake the sanners (ie Cyberware). Does anyone have an idea of how much a\nsingle scan costs and the best format to save it in? I am not sure on what\nsoftware platform I will be using it in, probably either Softimage or\nWavefront. So I think a spline based format would be best. Please forward the\nnumbers to me personally as I am having problems accessing USENET lately.\nThanks in advance!

I have a question about recursive, backward raytracing.\n\nWhen an incident ray (I) strikes an object at point P, first\nthe normal (N) is calculated. Light rays are calculated (L1 to Ln \nwhere n is the number of light sources) - these being the light\nrays that do not intersect with anything. The reflected ray (R) and\nthe transmitted ray (T) is calculated from the formulae.\n\nCalling the routine recursively on R and T will return the colours \nalong the rays (R and T) as rCol and tCol. Each object has its own\ncolour oCol and each light source has liCol (1 <= i <= n).\n\nThe question is: \n  How do you combine rCol, tCol, oCol and all the liCol's to get\n  the correct resulting colour to return along the I ray?\n\nAll colours are defined as strucures (records) having r, g, b components\nbetween 0 and 1.\n\nIf anyone has done this before could you give me a few hints?\n\n--\nAdrian Secchia

Actually, IFF is a *format standard*.  It is not a picture file format, sound\nfile format, but there exist several formats that use the IFF standard.  The\nIFF picture standard used by mostly everybody is a FORM ILBM (or just ILBM).\nThe only 3D IFF specification I know of is TDDD, which is used by Imagine and\nit's predecessor, Turbo Silver.   It is possible that some of the other Amiga\npackages use another *IFF* spec, but I don't know of any.  Lightwave will load\nTDDD FORM's I believe.
I was wondering if anyone knows of a graphics package for the PC that\nwill do compositing of a series of pictures?\n\nWhat I mean by "compositing" is, say I have a live video clip\n(digitized) panning around a living room, and a computer-generated\nbird flying around the screen.  I want to combine these two series of\npictures so that everywhere where the bird frames are black, I want\nthe living room picture to show through.  Yes, I realize I can do this\nwith a genlock, and I do own a genlock, but I want to be able to do\nmanual compositing also.  It's ok if I have to composite one frame at\na time; I assumed I'd have to do that anyway.  But being able to\ncomposite a series of frames would be even better.
I'm asking for help on a sticky problem involving unreasonably low\napparent precision in Z-buffering, that I've encountered in 2 different\nPEX implementations.  I can't find any discussion of this problem in any\nresources I can lay hands on (e.g. the comp.windows.x.pex FAQ, Gaskins's\n_PEXlib_Programming_Manual_, vendors' documentation).\n\nI'm posting this article by itself on comp.graphics, and virtually the\nsame article with a test program demonstrating the problem on\ncomp.windows.x.pex.  The problem is hard to describe without pictures,\nhence this article is longish.  If you can run PEXlib 5.x programs and\nare interested, I encourage you to build and run the test program in\ncomp.windows.x.pex to see the effect yourself and play with my approach\nto dealing with it.  (It depends on the utility code from the above\nGaskins book; instructions for fetching it via anonymous FTP are given.)\n\nThe problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize "stitching"\nartifacts resulting from the use of Z-buffering with polylines that are\ncoplanar with filled areas.  The interpolated Z values along a line will\ndiffer slightly, due to roundoff error, from the interpolated Z values\nacross an area, even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with\nvertices of the area.  Because of this, it's a tossup whether the\nZ-buffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed.\nVisually, the result tends to be a dashed-line effect even though the\nline is supposed to be solid.\n\nUsing the PEXlib API, my approach to a solution is to use two slightly\ndifferent PEX view mapping transforms, in two view table entries, one\nfor the areas and one for the lines.  The PEX structures or immediate-\nmode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in\neffect for areas, and the other is always in effect for lines.  The\nresult is a slight shift in NPC Z coordinates for the lines, so as to\nattempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines.\n\nThis shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used\nin the PEXlib view table entry for lines just a hair "backwards" (i.e.\nsmaller VRC Z coordinates), compared to their positions in the view\ntable entry used for areas.  This means that when a point is transformed\nto NPC, its Z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than\nif it comes from an area, thus accomplishing the desired bias.\n\nI would expect the Z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount\nto a few units at most, out of the entire dynamic range of the Z-buffer,\ntypically from 0 to 65535 if not 16777215 (i.e. 16 or 24 bit Z-buffers).\nTherefore, it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of Z in VRC\nbetween the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix\nthe stitching.\n\nBut in fact, experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 0.003\nto 0.006 of the range.  (Empirically, it's worst when the NPC Z\ncomponent of the slope of the surface is high, i.e. when it appears more\nor less edge-on to the viewer.)  It's as if only 8 or 9 bits of the\nZ-buffer have any dependable meaning!  This amount is so great that one\nproblem is replaced by another: sometimes the polylines "show through"\nareas which they are supposed to lie behind.\n\nI've observed the problem on both Hewlett-Packard and Digital\nworkstation PEX servers, to approximately the same degree.  The test\nprogram demonstrates the problem on an MIT PEXlib 5.x implementation;\nthis version is known to compile and run on an HP-UX system with PEX\n5.1.\n\nOpen questions:\n    (1) Why does this happen?\n        --  Am I configuring the PEX view table wrongly?\n        --  Is there a systematic difference in Z interpolation for lines\n            as opposed to areas (e.g. pixel centers versus corners) which\n            could be corrected for?\n        --  Are PEX implementors wantonly discarding Z precision in their\n            interpolators?\n        --  Something else?\n    (2) What to do about it?\n        --  Can I fix my use of the view table to allow better precision\n            in Z-buffered HLHSR?\n        --  Is there another approach I can take to remove the stitching\n            artifacts?\n        --  Am I just out of luck?\n\nAny help would be immensely appreciated!
I have some color gifs which I would like to archive in a much smaller\nsize using a grayscale palette of 16 shades. The quantization to 16 grays\nintroduces some ugly bands in the pictures, which can be nicely eliminated\nby dithering. Up to now I have used XV to process the images, but now I\nwould like to automate the procedure.\n\nThe problem is that XV can't (I think) convert images automatically, and the\nobvious alternative PNMPLUS (PPMQUANT and PNMDITHER) don't even get close to\nXV's quality. PNMDITHER apparently dithers in RGB, even though the images\nare in grayscale. The dithering routine in XV seems to use the natural image\ncolors for the dither. Is this or any similar routine available in the\npublic domain? If so, where?
I use Arts & Letters on a PC and if you make use of the Tracing Preferences\nit traces beautifully. BUT - there's a trick to tracing.

I have a copy of 'The Earth-From Space' on my wall that I purchased\nfrom Space Shots, Inc. (LA, CA  (800) 272-2779).  As printed on the\nposter, the image was created by Tom Van Sant and the GeoSphere Project.\nThe image IS copyrighted, so I doubt that you'll find it legally in\nthe public domain.  Part of the proceeds from the sale of the image go to the \nGeoSphere Project (an environmental education thing), and the cost is\nnominal, so crack a 20 and buy one!  Also, I don't think it's always\nsafe to assume that just because the government 'funded' a project, any\nproducts will be provided for free.  Many government agencies (NASA, NOAA)\nand some private groups (National Geographic) provided assistance to the\nGeoSphere Project.  This collaboration seems to be mostly oriented to\neducating the public, rather than pure research.

[ ..see previous article on this debate for the rests.. ]\n\nI can see XV-3.00 agree with my view in cases you don't -- even I say\nmy personal opinion (as above), it doesn't mean that it is not most\nobvious thing.\nPlease, if you use my previous writings as contradicting argument,\nplease do read them -- you have not saw them at all; you just\nrefered to text from which I wrote 'something' -- and you make\nhard decisions from that, without reading what exactly I have written.\n\nIt is really hard read when one writes a reply line by line method\nand don't understand include previously written material with the new\nsentences to give them meaning. You seem to be one such.\n\nYou also start replying to my articles, even you don't understand what\nis going on; you ask me repeatedly to decsribe my views what were\nwrong with XV 2.21 even I posted them within the article you did reply\nto. Believe me, it is not nice to get flamed specially when I know\nthat you have not read my article carefully in the first place.\n\nXV-3.00 and JPEG FAQ and users I have written to agree me with the\nplaces you didn't; I'm sure you just didn't undertand what about I\nwrote. We can blame my writing skills (in English?) for that, or?\n\nBetter stop the discussion and check what new ideas XV-3.00 gives;\nI allready mailed one to Bradley...
Yes I have written something that creates meshed fractal terrain\nsurfaces for exactly the purpose you require, importing into 3D\nmodelling packages. Be warned, the data content is high and brings\nmany packages to their knees. We use it primarily for MicroStation\nbut it exports DXF, as well as other formats, so you should be OK.\nYou can get it from my FTP mirror site in the US.\nIt is\n   wuarchive.wustl.edu\nmy stuff is located in the\n   mirrors/architec\ndirectory. Please FTP the README file first.\n\n-- \nPaul D Bourke                       School of Architecture, Property, Planning\npdbourke@ccu1.auckland.ac.nz        The University of Auckland\nPh:   +64 -9 373 7999 x7367         Private Bag 92019\nFax:  +64 -9 373 7410               Auckland, New Zealand

This is a heavily edited/modified version of the Gopher FAQ intended to\ngive people just starting with gopher enough information to get a\nclient and jump into Gopher-space - a complete version can be obtained\nas described below.  Once you have a gopher client point it at \nmerlot.welch.jhu.edu and welcome to gopher-space!\n\n\nDan Jacobson\n\ndanj@welchgate.welch.jhu.edu\n\n-----\n\nCommon Questions and Answers about the Internet Gopher, a\nclient/server protocol for making a world wide information service,\nwith many implementations.  Posted to comp.infosystems.gopher, \ncomp.answers, and news.answers every two weeks.\n\nThe most recent version of this FAQ can be gotten through gopher, or\nvia anonymous ftp:\n\nrtfm.mit.edu:/pub/usenet/news.answers/gopher-faq\n\nThose without FTP access should send e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu\nwith "send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources" in the body to find out\nhow to do FTP by e-mail.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------- \nList of questions in the Gopher FAQ:\n\nQ0:  What is Gopher?\nQ1:  Where can I get Gopher software?\nQ2:  What do I need to access Gopher?\nQ3:  Where are there publicly available logins for Gopher?\nQ4:  Who Develops Gopher Software?\nQ5: What is the relationship between Gopher and (WAIS, WWW, ftp)?\nQ6: Are papers or articles describing Gopher available?\nQ7: What is veronica?\nQ8: What is Available for Biology?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nQ0:  What is Gopher?\n\nA0:  The Internet Gopher client/server provides a distributed\n     information delivery system around which a world/campus-wide\n     information system (CWIS) can readily be constructed.   While\n     providing a delivery vehicle for local information,  Gopher\n     facilitates access to other Gopher and information servers\n     throughout the world. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nQ1:  Where can I get Gopher software?\n\nA1:  via anonymous ftp to boombox.micro.umn.edu.  Look in the directory\n     /pub/gopher\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQ2:  What do I need to access Gopher?\n\nA2:  You will need a gopher "client" program that runs on your local PC\n     or workstation\n\n     There are clients for the following systems.  The directory\n     following the name is the location of the client on the anonymous\n     ftp site boombox.micro.umn.edu (134.84.132.2) in the directory\n     /pub/gopher.\n\n      Unix Curses & Emacs   :  /pub/gopher/Unix/gopher1.12.tar.Z\n      Xwindows (athena)     :  /pub/gopher/Unix/xgopher1.2.tar.Z\n      Xwindows (Motif)      :  /pub/gopher/Unix/moog\n      Xwindows (Xview)      :  /pub/gopher/Unix/xvgopher\n      Macintosh Hypercard   :  /pub/gopher/Macintosh-TurboGopher/old-versions *\n      Macintosh Application :  /pub/gopher/Macintosh-TurboGopher *\n      DOS w/Clarkson Driver :  /pub/gopher/PC_client/\n      NeXTstep              :  /pub/gopher/NeXT/\n      VM/CMS                :  /pub/gopher/Rice_CMS/ or /pub/gopher/VieGOPHER/\n      VMS                   :  /pub/gopher/VMS/\n      OS/2 2.0	            :  /pub/gopher/os2/\n      MVS/XA                :  /pub/gopher/mvs/\n\n     Many other clients and servers have been developed by others, the\n     following is an attempt at a comprehensive list.  \n\n      A Microsoft Windows Winsock client "The Gopher Book"\n        sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/micro/pc-stuff/ms-windows/winsock/goph_tbk.zip\n\n      A Macintosh Application, "MacGopher".\n        ftp.cc.utah.edu:/pub/gopher/Macintosh *\n\n      Another Macintosh application, "GopherApp".\n        ftp.bio.indiana.edu:/util/gopher/gopherapp *\n\n      A port of the UNIX curses client for DOS with PC/TCP\n        oac.hsc.uth.tmc.edu:/public/dos/misc/dosgopher.exe\n\n      A port of the UNIX curses client for PC-NFS\n     	 bcm.tmc.edu:/nfs/gopher.exe\n\n      A beta version of the PC Gopher client for Novell's LAN Workplace\n      for DOS\n         lennon.itn.med.umich.edu:/dos/gopher\n\n      A VMS DECwindows client for use with Wollongong or UCX\n         job.acs.ohio-state.edu:XGOPHER_CLIENT.SHARE\n\n\n     * Note: these Macintosh clients require MacTCP.\n\n     Most of the above clients can also be fetched via a gopher client\n     itself.  Put the following on a gopher server:\n\n       Type=1\n       Host=boombox.micro.umn.edu\n       Port=70\n       Path=\n       Name=Gopher Software Distribution.\n\n \n     Or point your gopher client at boombox.micro.umn.edu, port 70 and\n     look in the gopher directory.\n\n\n     There are also a number of public telnet login sites available.\n     The University of Minnesota operates one on the machine\n     "consultant.micro.umn.edu" (134.84.132.4) See Q3 for more\n     information about this.  It is recommended that you run the client\n     software instead of logging into the public telnet login sites.  A\n     client uses the custom features of the local machine (mouse,\n     scroll bars, etc.)  A local client is also faster.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nQ3:  Where are there publicly available logins (ie places to telnet to\n     in order to get a taste of gopher) for Gopher?\n\nA3:  Here is a short list, use the site closest to you to minimize\n     network lag.\n\n     Telnet Public Logins:\n\n     Hostname                  IP#              Login   Area\n     ------------------------- ---------------  ------  -------------\n     consultant.micro.umn.edu  134.84.132.4	gopher  North America\n     gopher.uiuc.edu           128.174.33.160   gopher  North America\n     panda.uiowa.edu           128.255.40.201	panda   North America\n     gopher.sunet.se           192.36.125.2     gopher  Europe\n     info.anu.edu.au           150.203.84.20    info    Australia\n     gopher.chalmers.se        129.16.221.40    gopher  Sweden\n     tolten.puc.cl             146.155.1.16     gopher  South America\n     ecnet.ec		           157.100.45.2     gopher  Ecuador\n     gan.ncc.go.jp             160.190.10.1     gopher  Japan\n\n\n     It is recommended that you run the client software instead of\n     logging into the public login sites.  A client uses the\n     custom features of the local machine (mouse, scroll bars, etc.)\n     and gives faster response.  Furthermore many of the basic features\n     of clients - saving a file to your hard drive, printing a file\n     to a local printer, viewing images, retrieving files from ftp\n     sites etc.... are not available by the telnet logins.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nQ4:  Who Develops Gopher Software?\n\nA4:  Gopher was originally developed in April 1991 by the University\n     of Minnesota Microcomputer, Workstation, Networks Center to help\n     our campus find answers to their computer questions.  \n\n     It has since grown into a full-fledged World Wide Information\n     System used by a large number of sites in the world.\n\n     Many people have contributed to the project, too numerous to\n     count. \n\n     The people behind the much of the gopher software can be reached\n     via e-mail at gopher@boombox.micro.umn.edu, or via paper mail:\n   \n      Internet Gopher Developers\n      100 Union St. SE #190\n      Minneapolis, MN 55455  USA\n\n     Or via FAX at:\n \n      +1 (612) 625-6817\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nQ5: What is the relationship between Gopher and (WAIS, WWW, ftp)?\n\nA5: Gopher is intimately intertwined with these two other systems.\n     As shipped the Unix gopher server has the capability to: \n     \n       - Search local WAIS indices.\n       - Query remote WAIS servers and funnel the results to gopher\n         clients.\n       - Query remote ftp sites and funnel the results to gopher\n         clients.\n       - Be queried by WWW (World Wide Web) clients (either using\n         built in gopher querying or using native http querying.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nQ6: Are papers or articles describing Gopher available?\n\nA6: Gopher has a whole chapter devoted to it in :\n\n     _The_Whole_Internet_, Ed Kroll, O'Reilly, 1992 (Editors note:\n                             ..Great book, go out and buy a bunch!)\n\n     _The_Internet_Passport: NorthWestNet's Guide to Our World Online"\n     By Jonathan Kochmer and NorthWestNet.

As archie is to ftp archives, veronica \n     is to gopherspace.  A veronica search produces a menu of gopher\n     items, each of which is a direct pointer to a gopher data source.\n     Because veronica is accessed through a gopher client, it is easy\n     to use, and gives access to all types of data supported by the\n     gopher protocol.\n\n     To try veronica, select it from the "Other Gophers" menu on \n     Minnesota's gopher server, or point your gopher at:\n\n     Name=veronica (search menu items in most of GopherSpace) \n     Type=1 \n     Port=70 \n     Path=1/veronica \n     Host=futique.scs.unr.edu\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQ8: What is Available for Biology?\n\nA8: There is an incredible amount of software, data and information\n    availble to biologists now by gopher.\n\nHere is a brief list of the Biological Databases that you can search \nvia gopher:\n\n      2.

Does anyone know how to access and/or display multiple pages in mode 13h\nwhile still maintaining the 1 byte per pixel memory organization?\nExamples in C or Assembly would be appreciated...\nThanks\nScott
Howdy all,\n\n\n\nHmm... 48 bit aye?\nWell, it beats a 32-bit design for thee sake of ellegance.\n48 bit means 16 bits per primary colour.\nThe 2^48 nr of colours is a bit misleading. It makes more sense to see it\nas 65536 possible shades of pure red.\nThis might actually make some sense, since 256 shades of red (24 bit colours) \nmay produce visible 'jumps' in intensity.\nThen again, a byte per primary colour for each pixel is the most elegant way \nof doing colour graphics, because it leaves ya such a tidy (and fast) program\ncode.\n\n	Take care,\n\n		Bram
I think it's known, but it's neat.\n\n     Can it be extended to 3D?
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nEditorial Contact:\nSingle Source Marketing:  Myra Manahan    (714) 545-1338\nGenoa Systems:            Joseph Brunoli  (408) 432-9090\n                          Neil Roehm      (408) 432-9090/Technical\n\n\n                      Genoa Presents High Performance \n                        Video Graphics Accelerator\n\n        SAN JOSE, Calif USA -- Genoa Systems Corporation announces \nWINDOWSVGA 24,  a True Color 24-bit graphics accelerator card that \ndelivers up to 16.8 million colors at speeds faster than the \ncompetition.  Plus it offers a full range of resolutions, high \nrefresh rates as well as unique proprietary performance features.  \nThe card is available in both 16-bit ISA bus and 32-bit VESA Local \nbus versions (models 8500 AND 8500VL).\n        With 1MB DRAM on board, the WINDOWSVGA 24 card offers \nmaximum resolution up to 1,280 x 1,024 and supports a refresh rate \nof 72Hz at 800 x 600 and resolution up to 1,024 x 768 \nnon-interlaced. Both models provide performance many times greater \nthan standard SVGA boards, yet conform to all current video \nstandards.\n        WINDOWSVGA 24 features Genoa's FlickerFree(tm) technology, \nwhich eliminates screen flash and flicker to make viewing much more \ncomfortable.  the cards also come with Safescan(tm), a utility \ndeveloped by Genoa to eliminate the black border around the screen \nand thereby provide 100-percent screen use for overscanning monitors.\n        WINDOWSVGA model 8500VL takes full advantage of the speed \noffered by the new VESA Local bus technology.  Most VL bus cards \nwill only handle data transfers up to 33MHz, but the 8500VL will \ntransfer data at the full speed of the CPU, up to 50MHz.  Genoa is \nalso offering this card in the "TurboBahn" combination packaged \nwith their TURBOEXPRESS 486VL motherboard.\n        Built around the Cirrus Logic GD-5426 GUI accelerator, \nWINDOWSVGA 24 offers the user an exceptional price/performance \nvalue.  Genoa's advanced proprietary drivers act to "turbocharge" \nthe chip, thereby providing an affordable accelerator card with \npower and performance that surpass many of the more highly priced \nchip cards.  The Genoa user will enjoy optimal speed and \nreliability for such programs as Windows, AutoCAD, AutoShade, 3D \nStudio, OS/2, OrCAD and more.  Driver updates and product bulletins \nare available on Genoa's BBS at (408) 943-1231.\n        Genoa Systems manufactures and markets an extensive line of \ngraphics adapters, motherboards, audio and multimedia cards for \nIBM-compatible personal computers.  All products come with a two \nyear limited warranty on parts and labor.  Genoa products are \ncurrently distributed worldwide through authorized distributors, \nresellers, VARs and systems integrators.\n        For more information contact Joe Brunoli, Marketing \nManager, Genoa Systems at 75 E.

I am looking for a small utility that will convert a Microsoft Video (AVI)\nfile to an Autodesk Animator Pro (FLC) file. Since AVIs also contain sound,\nit would be nice if this utility also stored the sound track as a WAV or VOC\nfile. Currently I'm accomplishing this by saving the AVI as multiple DIBs\nusing Video for Windows, then converting each DIB to a GIF, then loading the\nGIFs into Animator. For the sound, I load the original AVI into WavEdit and\nsave it as a seperate WAV file. This requires too many steps to be productive.\n\nAny help will be GREATLY appreciated.\n\n          Thanks\n             Don
Does anyone know of a program for the PC that\nwill take AutoCad DXF format files and convert\nthem to a raster format, like PCX, GIF, etc?\nThanks in advance....\n				ED
Try WinJPEG on oak.oakland.edu:pub/msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip\n  It has more TIFF support than graphics workshop.  It also converts to\n  all the above formats...
I worked in support for a while at a company and we had problems with several\nToshiba 1600's in a short space of time. They were all around 2 years old.\nSome screens went completely (as above), others were just "dodgy".\n\nThis happened to about 5 or 6 out of, maybe 100. They were fairly reliable up\nto then and I don't think it was a special problem with Tosh's (no link to the\ncompany). So I would think that 21 months may not be unreasonable - just\nunlucky!\n\nRegards,\n\nKate.  :)|
Does anybody know about a converter from CGM to PCX or anything else more\ncommon.  I've spent some time searching the archives with no luck.\nCould you email me your responses.\n\n\n\n                 Thx in advance,\n                         Mike G.
Hi\n\n   I would like to know if there is any software, PD or not, who\n   could produce X11 output of HPGL file on RS/6000. And same kind of\n   software who could produce hardcopy on postscript and lasetjet.\n\nTry export.lcs.mit.edu.  I think that there is a viewer there called\nxviewgl.  Check the README in /contrib.
Whatever you do, don't FTP to the sites listed in my sig...\n \nYou won't like what you find...really.  I beg you NOT to GO there!\nPLEASE!\n\n...e

These standards should facilitate the creation\nof REAL_TIME Online applications that make use of Voice, Video,\nTelecommuting, HiRes graphics, Conferencing, Distant Learning, Online\norder entry, Fax,in addition these dicussion would assist all to\nbetter understand how SGML, CALS, ODA, MIME, OODBMS, JPEG, MPEG,\nFRACTALS, SQL, CDrom, cdromXA, Kodak PhotoCD, TCL, V.FAST, and\nEIA/TIA562, can best be incorporated and implemented to develop\nTELEMATIC/Multimedia applications.\n\nWe want to be able to support DOS, UNIX, MAC, WINDOWS, NT, OS/2\nplatforms.  It is our hope that individuals, developers, corporations,\nUniversities, R & D labs would join in in supporting such an endeavor.\n\nThis would be a NOT_FOR_PROFIT group with bylaws and charter. Already\nmany corporations have decided to support OTG (Open TELEMATIC Group) so\ndo not delay joining if you are a developer\n\nAn RFD has been posted to form a usenet newsgroup and a FAQ will soon\nbe be composed to start promulgating what is known on the subject.  If\nyou would like to be added to the maillist send email or mail to the\naddress below.\n\nThis group would publish an electronic quarterly NAPLPS/JPEG\nnewsletter as well as a hardcopy version.  We urge all who wants to\nsee CMCs HiRes based applications & the NAPLPS/JPEG G R O W, decide to\njoin and mutually benefit from this NOT-FOR_PROFIT endeavor.\n\nNOTE: Telematic has been defined by Mr. James Martin as the marriage\n      of Voice, Video, Hi-res Graphics, Fax, IVR, Music over telephone\n      lines/LAN.\n\nIf you would like to get involve write to me at:\n\n  IMG Inter-Multimedia Group| Internet:  epimntl@world.std.com\n  P.O.

Ok It is for a game that is 3d and you have listed the characteristics \nthat you are looking for. I think you may have left out a few \nimportant parameters. \nThe polygons are all convex. \nThey have less than N sides. (you are drawing meshes walls doors etc.)\n\nI believe that the algorithms you can get that will only draw convex\npolygons can be much more efficient than those that can draw\nconcave / self intersecting polygons. \nThis efficiency can largely be attributed to the fact that \nsimple convex polygons only have a left and a right edge on each scan line.\nComplex (figure 8 type polygons) can be a bit trickier.\n\nThe less than N sides specification especially if it is a very small \nnumber like 3 or 4 allow othe optimisations to be made.\n\nThus for a high speed game application I think you are looking for\ncode that exploits and is hence limited to drawing simple convex\npolygons.  \n\n\nIt may have been that they were very general purpose algorithms.\nIf you limit yourself to 3 or four sided simple convex polygons\nI think you might be suprised how fast a c algorithm with a \nasm block move to fill each scan line might actually be.

EUROPEAN COMPUTER RESEARCH CENTRE\n\nResearch Positions in 3D Graphics\n\nECRC is currently expanding its research staff in three-dimensional\ngraphics. We are looking for highly qualified researchers with a PhD in\ncomputer science and a proven ability to conduct highly innovative\nresearch. Preference will be given to candidates who have strong\nexperience in developing and implementing algorithms for\nthree-dimensional graphics, visualization and user interaction. We\npresently have positions available for both experienced researchers and\nrecent graduates.  Candidates with especially strong backgrounds may be\nconsidered for positions as visiting scientists or for Ph.D. student\nresearch positions.\n\nThe European Computer-Industry Research Centre is located in Munich,\nGermany with English as the working language. The centre is funded by a\nconsortium of major computer companies, with a mission to pursue\nresearch in fundamental areas of computer science. Active areas of\nresearch include visualization and user interfaces, distributed\ncomputing, parallelism, deductive systems and databases. The center\nemploys 45 researchers of 21 different nationalities.\n\nThe small but rapidly growing graphics group is currently investigating\nnew methods for three-dimensional human-computer interaction and the\nintegration of computer vision and computer graphics technology. The\ncenter has extensive computing facilities which includes Sun\nworkstations, Apple Macintoshes, a well equipped graphics laboratory and\nnetwork access to super-computer facilities.

I am revamping some computer-aided visual inspection systems which\nuse the old AT&T Targa-16 Board Set (2 cards) to display images from\na color CCD camera to a color monitor, providing the option to overlay\ntext or a crosshair. No image capture or manipulation is performed, \njust display. I would like to know if there is still a source for \ndevelopment libraries which would allow me to embed commands in my\nown software to enable the camera, draw crosshairs, print text, etc.\nI'll be glad to pay if they are commercially available. E-Mail if\npossible.\n\n-- \n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nJoe Ryburn |  CIM Manager               | Intergraph Corporation\n           |  Manufacturing Integration | Huntsville, AL 35894

I was skimming through a few gophers and bumped into one at NIH\n   with a database that included images in .GIF format.  While I have\n   not yet worked out the kinks of getting the gopher client to call\n   an X viewer, I figure that the majority of the users here are not\n   in an X11 environment - instead using DOS and MS-Kermit.\n\n      With Kermit supporting Tek4010 emulation for graphics display,\n   does anyone know of a package that would allow a Tek to display a\n   .GIF image?  It would be of more use to the local population to\n   plug something of this sort in as the 'picture' command instead of\n   XView or XLoadImage ...

Actually, for digital HDTV systems that's far higher bandwidth than\nyou need, unless there's some reason you must work in fully-uncompressed\nHDTV.  Also, my calculations is that each frame should be well under 6MB,\neven using 24 bits/pixel (which is more bits than you actually need - 15 or\n18 should be enough for a moving picture).  1600x1100x16bits is 3.5MB (I'm\nguessing at HDTV resolution - it may be a bit wider than 1600, I'm fairly\nsure of the 1100 number for most of the digital proposals).\n\n	I hope you have a very fast memory system as well - 180MB/s while\ndisplaying will require a heavily interleaved VRAM system.\n\n	Unless you have a _very_ compelling reason, I'd advise trying to use\nat least somewhat compressed data.  You don't have to go to full compression\nto get to a level where the data IO requirements are much cheaper and easier\nto deal with.\n\n-- \nGNU Emacs is a LISP operating system disguised as a word processor.\n - Doug Mohney, in comp.arch
I need triangulized data of some nice looking model with some\ntexture mapping. It would be better if the parametric values\nof each vertex( for the surface before triangulized ) are\navaliable along with the Euclidean points so that we\ncould use them for texture mapping.
I have a group of GIF images that each contain 6 small images in \nthe same place on all the images. I need a program to crop out the\nsmall images to a new GIF file. All the programs I can find make me\nuse the mouse or keyboard to define the cropping coordinates. Is there\na program out there for a PC that can take the crop coordinates on\nthe command line?
Hi, Everyone.\nI am  currently planning to write a program that traverses the\nimage of handwritten characters in ascii format and produces\ncircle and line representation of handwritten characters.\nDid anybody out there has any experiences on this problem?\nIf you have would you post or e-mail to please\nkevin\n\nDoes anyone has program that traverse the digital image and produces\ncircle and line\n-- \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKEVIN SHIN   kshin@bcstec.ca.boeing.com

I'm having a slight problem with the POV raytracer.  I'm not sure if\nthis is the correct group to post to or not.  I create .tga files on\na unix machine using pov.  Then when i download them to display on my pc,\nthey're listed as bad files.  But when I create the file on my pc, it displays\nfine.  Are unix .tga's incompatible with the pc?  An easy solution to this\nproblem would be a unix targa->gif converter.  Anyone know where I could\nfind one?  Any help on this subject is appreciated.
Does anyone know where I can find a code which would take concave\npolygons and break them up into a set of convex polygons?\n\nThanks,
From article <1suntv$3km@watson.mtsu.edu>, by csjohn@watson.mtsu.edu (John Wallace):\n\nThe GL file is an archive containing individual frames or pieces of\nframes (usually stored as .PIC or .CLP files), fonts, and a .TXT file\nthat tells the GRASP animation system how to display it.  GL stands\nfor Grasp Library.  There is probably a detailed discussion of this subject\nin the alt.binaries.pictures FAQ.\n\nThere are freely distributable viewers for GL files, and they are usually\nnamed GRASPRT?.EXE (replace the ? with a version digit or letter).  Most\nGL files contain frames that are hardware-specific to particular modes\nof the CGA, EGA, or VGA adapters on PCs.  I think that there are some\ncopies of GRASPRT available by anonymous ftp (I know that I got one there\na long time ago).\n\n		Good Luck\n		Jack
I am applying for an NSF grant to buy equipment for a laboratory...\n\nThe lab will need to support C (or Pascal) with graphics tools...\n\n\nWe can run the lab either on PC's or  DEC equipment --- \n\n\n\nIf you are familiar with appropriate products (software/hardware) and precise\nprices. Please contact\n\n\nshai@lcc.stonehill.edu\n\n\nWe are interested in any available acadmic discounts....\n\n\nAlso, if anyone runs a lab using similar software/hardware, I would be very\ninterested in hearing your opinions of its success\n\nThanks
I suppose you don't know what about we have discussed.\nWe discussed about error(s) in XV 2.21 which shows images only as 8bit,\nand my suggestion above works perfectly with it.\n\nSo far I have seen a colormap editing window in XV -- that is, there\nmust be a colormap anyway. The problems you present are exist anyway,\nand I didn't tried to solve them at all, because I would not make such\nproblems to my programs in the first place.\n\nGamma and color corrections are easily done to 24bit image\nas I presented. There's no need make tricks from 8bit/quantized image\nback to 24 bit image.\n\n\n\nOk, you're writing about situation that user want edit images as 24bit\nand user want edit individual colors -- your questions, by the way,\njumps off the discussion a bit.\n\nMy solution doesn't work, because there's no colormap withing real 24bit\nimage -- you see, user see 24bit image; going back to 8bit is silly.\n\n\nAbout changing individual colors in 8bit/quantized/rasterized image:\nchanging individual colors in colormap is useless in most\ncases if the image is quantized and rasterized -- small change may\nmake serious errors to anywhere in the image.\nXV allows this feature, but I don't recommend to use it with the\nmentioned type images.\n\nMoreover, XV is not a paint program; you can only make those global\nchanges. In full 24bit XV, changing individual colors sounds like\npaint program job.\nIf person have 8bit screen, there's need for tricks to get the\noriginal 24bit image modified. Because user don't see full 24bit\nimage, there's need to make approximations and it is not possible to\nmodify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups (if\nimage is rasterized). To select indiavidual color, there could be 7x7\ncursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area --\nselecting individual color is possible from that.\n\nOk, I don't have thought very much 24bit painting programs, never seen\nsuch in good view and are not planned to make such. Not to mention\n24bit painting program in 8bit screen...\n\n\n\nIt saved 8bit/quantized/rasterized images as 24bit jpegs; jpeg is not\ndesigned for that.\nAlso, human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image; say,\nperson would like to crop part of the image and save it, then it is\nexpected that the image still is the same. So, XV were designed\nwithout thinking about human interface and how human expect the\nprogram work -- design error.\n\nI have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files, but\nit were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making\nmajor change to the original design.\n\nSo, even all screen images are 8bit, the processed images and saved\nimages could have been 24bit very easily, instead of 8bit.\n\nBefore anybody will make a note: yes, I may as well make a lift where\n'up' means that the lift goes down and 'down' means that the lift goes\nup, and put a note on this design solution to the manuals -- however,\neven the manuals tells the correct situation, it doesn't solve the problem.\n(Americans: the lift is just an example :)\n\n\nWell, my text may be a bit hard reading, hopefully you suggeeded to\nread it.

Recently we have found TIFF manipulation packages which do not recognize\nTIFF files output by xv.  This is due to a missing XRESOLUTION and YRESOLUTION\ntag which apparently is required (or at least believed to be required) for\nvalid TIFF.  I have checked both xv 2.x and xv 3.x and neither of these\ndo indeed copy these tags.\n\nHas anyone out there hacked in the fixes for xv to support these tags?\nI have been told that I could find some code in tiff/tools/tiffcp.c, but\nthat directory is one of many of the tiff group not distributed with xv.  I\nhope to obtain the original tiff src and look at it, but would prefer\nto find code already known to work in xv.

Finding a disk array that can do 180MB/sec. will be difficult. The fastest\nones I know about are from Maximum Strategy (IBM also sells these). They\ncan attach HiPPI at up to 144 MB/sec. (64 bit). For these kinds of data\nrates you need more than SCSI for connections. Their latest model, the\nRAID 5 model Gen 4 only does 90 MB/sec. but I think this may be a\nlimitation only of the HiPPI channel and that customer needs have not\nexceeded that speed since their older model was faster. They are also not\nidle (must be working on newer products that might be faster) and are a\nsmall company so you might be able to ask about custom interfaces. They\nstill marketed the older, faster model as of a few mongths ago.\n\nMaximum Strategy, Inc.\n801 Buckeye Court\nMilpitas, CA 95035-7408\nsales@maxstrat.com\n\nYou might still want to look into compression as it will be very difficult\nto keep the HiPPI bus fully working at all times - sustained throughput\nmight come close to maximum burst rate.\n\nInteresting problem.

The first and only thing I've ever tried to auto-trace was a piece\nof a USCG nautical chart using Adobe Illustrator 3.2.  I wanted to get the\noutline of the coast for Western Long Island Sound.  I was simultaneously\nsuprised at how good a job it did and disappointed at how poorly it did.  I\nsuspect what I gave it was a very difficult thing; not only is the coastline\nvery irregular, but overlaid on the chart are numerous sets of gridlines\n(not only lattitude and longitude, but loran grids as well).  The most\ncommon mistake it make was whenever the coastline was roughly parallel and\ntangent to a grid line, it would take off following the gridline instead of\nthe coast.  I think the best improvement would be some sort of interactive\nalgorithm that would let you step in and say "no, dummy, you're going the\nwrong way".\n\n	Steve Reisberg, a friend of mine a few years back(*), did his\ndoctoral work analysing electron micrographs of filimentous phage (virii).\nA good chunk of the work was writing a program to take a digitized\nmicrograph and automatically trace the centerline of the virus particles.\nThis is essentially the same problem that Illustrator tries to solve with\nits auto-trace tool.\n\n	In some respects the problem Steve worked on was harder, since he\nwas trying to do quantitative analysis of the virus structure and finding a\ngood centerline was only the first step, but a step on which all future\nanalysis depended.  However, in other respects, it was an easier problem\nsince the program could be written with a lot of knowledge about what the\nvirus particles were supposed to look like, and the analysis could be\nrestricted to those particles which happend to be relatively straight,\nclean, and well imaged; you don't always have that freedom auto-tracing real\nlife images.  In any case, it gave me some insight into just how difficult\nthis problem is to solve in the general case.\n\n	(*) Steve is no longer with us.  He and his wife disappeared while\non vacation in Hawaii a couple of years after they graduated.  Their last\nknown location was hiking in a densely wooded in a mountainous area.  While no\nbodies were ever found, they are presumed to have been the victim of some\nsort of fall or accident in the woods.
vamilliron:  Yes, Intel's PCI is (another) Local Bus standard, which\ncan be used for graphics, although I believe Local Buses can be used\nfor other things, too.

I posted that document (forgot part 1/6 etc) but it was more than a summary,\nit was a complete technical description of the protocol. It can be ftped\nfrom simtel or from wuarchive.wustl.edu in mirrors/msdos/naplps\n\n\nWhy not write a NAPLPS decoder for your choice of platform and release the\ncode to the net? Then other willing souls can help port it to other platforms.\nNAPLPS was designed for this type of online interactive graphics much the\nsame as X, but while X is intended for high-bandwidth network connections,\nNAPLPS was optimized for low bandwidth modem connections.\n\nI'm sure you will receive other suggestions but look at it this way. If you\nwanted to provide a full network connection to Linux over a modem would you\nuse SLIP/PPP or would you invent some new way? Most people would say that\nSLIP/PPP exist and are reasonably well designed protocols, so lets just\nimplement them. I see it the same way with NAPLPS. It is an existing, well\nthought out, extensible protocol for online graphics, so why not implement\nit.\n\nIf you need any advice on implementation, just e-mail me. I am currently\ngetting a beta version of my CorelDraw to NAPLPS converter working well\nenough to release it by May 15. If you or someone else does not get going\non a freely available NAPLPS decoder, then I intend to do it after I get\na my conversion program out of beta, and get a couple of other things done.

JPEG is designed for compressing either\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of "natural", real-world scenes.\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\ndrawings.\n\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\nrespectively.\n\nJPEG is "lossy", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\nthe fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\ninvisible to the eye.\n\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\nfiles if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\naren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\n\n\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\n\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\n\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\n\nIf your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\n\nIt's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\nextra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\n\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\n\n\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\n\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\ngray-scale images of "realistic" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\n\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\nby GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\n\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\nparticularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.\n\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\n\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\n\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\na GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\nconvert well.\n\n\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\n\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\nsoftware described in section 6B.\n\nFile	   Size in bytes		Comments\n\nship.ppm	1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\n			 or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\nship.ppm.Z	 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\n			 compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.\n			 Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\nship.gif	 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\n			 Most of the savings is the result of losing color\n			 info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\n\nship.jpg95	 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\n			 This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\n			 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\nship.jpg75	  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\n			 You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\n			 from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\nship.jpg50	  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\n			 This has slight defects; if you know what to look\n			 for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing\n			 the original.  Still as good image quality as many\n			 recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\nship.jpg25	  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\n			 JPEG's characteristic "blockiness" becomes apparent\n			 at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\n			 Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\n			 of poorer image quality than this.\nship.jpg5o	   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\n			 Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\n			 indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\n			 the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\n\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\nratio for real-world scenes.\n\n\n[5]  What are good "quality" settings for JPEG?\n\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\nthe meaning of these settings.  "Quality 95" does NOT mean "keep 95% of the\ninformation", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\nit's not a percentage of anything.\n\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\n\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\n\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\n\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as "op art".\n\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\nquality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just\n"high"/"medium"/"low"-style choices.)\n\n\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\n\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\nIf you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article "How to find sources".\n(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\n"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources" in the body.  The "Anonymous FTP\nList FAQ" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\nthe news.answers archive.\n\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\n\n\n[6A]  If you are looking for "canned" software, viewers, etc:\n\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\nkind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\n\nX Windows:\n\nXV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other\nimage formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image\nmanipulations.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),\nfile contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support\nfor 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new\nand still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding\nedge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that\nversion 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll get\nonly 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works\nfine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a\nglitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the "save at normal size" checkbox\nwhen saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.\n\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package,\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\nbasic free JPEG software.\n\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\nfile contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\n\n\nMS-DOS:\n\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\n\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\nThe current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\nnot flashy, but it's functional.\n\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\n\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\nVESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\nthat the driver is missing.)\n\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\nthe net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it.\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\n\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good:\nit's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\n\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any*\nof them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\nhave hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\nthing with hi-color displays.)\n\nThe Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\n\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\nparticular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\n\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.\n\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\nrefers to directory (eg) "msdos/graphics" at Simtel20, that really means\n"pd1:<msdos.graphics>".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\nin (eg) "/pub/msdos/graphics".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\n\nMicrosoft Windows:\n\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\ndue to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\n\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\nBut it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\n\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG\nfiles, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\n\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\n286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version,\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\n\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\n\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\nmode, not in a window.\n\nOS/2:\n\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\nNote: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\n/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip\n    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip\n    Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip\n    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows\n    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip\n    PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP/Targa/PCX viewer.  GIF viewing very fast,\n    JPEG viewing roughly the same speed as the above two programs.  Has\n    image manipulation & slideshow functions.  Shareware, $20.\n\nMacintosh:\n\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\n\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\n\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\nlike this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very\nwell thought out.\n\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.)\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\n\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\n\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\n\nApple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\nit, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\n\nStorm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\ndownloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\n\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\ndon't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\n\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\nJPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\n\nAmiga:\n\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\n\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\n\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\n\nViewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\namiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.\n\nIf you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\n\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\n\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are "AugJPEG", "NewAmyJPEG",\n"VJPEG", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\nit's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\n\nAtari ST:\n\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\nThese programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\n\nFor monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level\ngrayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.\n\nI have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for\nAtaris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.\n\nAcorn Archimedes:\n\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\n\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\n\nThere's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\nformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,\nCambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.\n\nNeXT:\n\nImageViewer is a PD utility that displays images and can do some format\nconversions.  The current version reads JPEG but does not write it.\nImageViewer is available from the standard NeXT archives at\nsonata.cc.purdue.edu and cs.orst.edu, somewhere in /pub/next (both are\ncurrently being re-organized, so it's hard to point to specific\nsub-directories).  Note that there is an older version floating around that\ndoes not support JPEG.\n\n\nPortable software for almost any system:\n\nIf none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free\nJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program.\nIf your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa\nor PPM 24-bit image files.\n\nThere are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every\nday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether\nthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can\nhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are\nnot and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.\n\n\n[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:\n\nFree, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent\nJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,\ndocumentation, and some small test files is available from several places.\nThe "official" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9\nor 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release\nis jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to\nretrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.\nIf you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may\nprefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\nabove), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on\nCompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.\nIf you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest\ncomp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.\n(If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ\narticle "How to find sources", referred to at the top of section 6.)\n\nThe free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG "JFIF" format and image\nfiles in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.\nThe core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other\nprograms, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have\ntested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.\n\nWe have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.\nCompanies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.\nWe do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in\nproduct literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).\nWe hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with\nanything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.\n\nThe Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to\ncontribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.\n\n\n[7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?\n\nMost people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.\nTypical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display\n256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\ncolors.  This process is called "color quantization".  (This is something\nof a misnomer, "color selection" would be a better term.  We're stuck with\nthe standard usage though.)\n\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\n\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\nThis happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets "smeared"\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\n\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\nposted images described as "256-color JPEG".  This tells me that the poster\n(a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\nnumber of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)\n\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\npalette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.)\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to.\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\nFurthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization\nalgorithm, you're out of luck.\n\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\nfor all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware.\nJPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was\nsent.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\n\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\nhardware already: 15-bit "hi-color" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\nin a machine-independent fashion.\n\n\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\n\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\ncoding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\n\n\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\n\nThere's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\n\nSaying "-Q 100" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\n"-sample 1x1" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\n\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\nvalue; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\n\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\n\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\n\n\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\n\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\nstandards organizations.\n\nSince we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\n"do their own thing", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with\nanybody else's.\n\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\nthat's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a "low-end" format that transports\n    pixels and not much else.\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\n    a "high-end" format that will let you record just about everything you\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\nof JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\n\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported "lowest common\ndenominator"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\n\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\n\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\n\n\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\n\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\n\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.\n\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\n    "raw JPEG" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\n    it's worth a try, anyway.\n\n3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\n    won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\n\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\n\n5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\n    try stripping off everything before that.\n\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\n\n	"begin" line\n	M_]C_X ...\n\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\n\n	"begin" line\n	M:'-I ...\n\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\n\n\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\n\nThe JPEG spec defines two different "back end" modules for the final output\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\n\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\nfrom these companies.  (The "fair use" doctrine allows people to implement\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\nat best.)\n\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\n\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\n\n\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\n\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\nfirst time around.\n\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\nfree JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\n\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\n(If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move.\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\nthat's a mighty limited capability!)\n\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\ntransmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\n\n\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\n\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\nloss of quality.\n\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\ndon't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\n\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\nDon't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\n\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts ("ghost" edges).  Do yourself\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\nsystem, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\nway to do this.)\n\ncjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\n\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually "dithered" to fool\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\ncolor noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\nTo get around this, you want to "smooth" the GIF image before compression.\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\nthan you'd get without smoothing.\n\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\ncapability is built in.  Try "-smooth 10" or so when converting GIFs.\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\nthe output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\n\nThe upshot of all this is that "cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10" is probably a\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\nimage, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\n\n\n---------------------\n\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.

Think about what you are saying here. The 24 bit image is quantised down to 8\nbits so many 'similar' colours are mapped onto a single palette colour. This\ncolour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways. You then want to apply these\nmodifications back to the 24 bit file, so you have to find which colours mapped\nto this one palette colour. Ok you could do this by copying the 24 bit file to a\n32 bit file and using the extra 8 bits to hold the index entry. \nHaving done this, you need to do something to them ... what, exactly?\n\nApply the difference in RGB between the original and modified palette entry to\neach colour in the group? This could generate colours with RGB outside the range\n0...255. It would also lead to discontinuities when different parts of a smooth\ncolour gradient mapped to several different palette entries.\n\nYou could interpolate from full modification to no modification depending how\nfar each colour was from the palette entry. However I suspect this would look\nrather odd.\n\nSo in summary, what I said in my previous posting still holds:\n\n\n\nIn other words, to edit a 24 bit file you need software built for the job.\nTacking mods onto xv is going to create more problems than it solves.\n\nAs to the other bits - you seemed to be claiming that there were bugs in XV. If\nthat was not what you meant, then:\n\n\nYes, I probably did. I found that the collected digest format of your posting\nmade it a little difficult to understand precisely what your point was. Sorry\nif I misunderstood.\n\n\nYes again. What *is* (was?) wrong with xv?\n\n--\nChris Lilley\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTechnical Author, ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training Project\nComputer Graphics Unit, Manchester Computing Centre, Oxford Road, \nManchester, UK.

I was wondering if anyone knows of a graphics package for the PC that\n   will do compositing of a series of pictures?\n\n   What I mean by "compositing" is, say I have a live video clip\n   (digitized) panning around a living room, and a computer-generated\n   bird flying around the screen.  I want to combine these two series of\n   pictures so that everywhere where the bird frames are black, I want\n   the living room picture to show through.  Yes, I realize I can do this\n   with a genlock, and I do own a genlock, but I want to be able to do\n   manual compositing also.  It's ok if I have to composite one frame at\n   a time; I assumed I'd have to do that anyway.  But being able to\n   composite a series of frames would be even better.\n\n   I've looked around and I haven't found a PC package that will perform\n   this.  Help, please!\n\nIf you can get the live animation and the computer-generated animation\ninto AutoDesk Animator .FLI or .FLC format, AutoDesk Animator will do\nthis for you.  It can take one animation, make a certain color\n"clear", and overlay it over another animation.  I do not have a way\nright now to convert .AVI or .MPG files to animator files.  Animator\nwill also import a series of .GIF files to create an animation, so if\nyour video capture stuff can create this is might work.

[edited]\n\n\n\nWell for starters, why use rle files?  You might have a specific program that\nneeds them, OK, but I tend to convert straight to jpeg format, thus a 2.4meg\n24bit targa file becomes a ~80k or less 24bit jpeg.\n\nThe latest versions of XV (2.2.1 ?) and xloadimage (3.03) both handle jpeg files.\nAnd the best way to convert to jpeg is with the c/djpeg suit.  Even at 90%\nquality (you can't see the difference) the jpeg is way smaller than anything\nelse even an 8bit gif!\n\nLater'ish\nCraig

I think the main reason is that in the good old hacker days of the young(er)\nGates' and Jobs' of the world, the computer was not as widespread a\nphenomenom as it is now.  With the increased popularity of the PC\ncome a plethora of mundane business uses which required more practical\nminded and narrower-focused programmers.\n\nWhy be a hacker when you can get a good job programming databases or\nprograms for accountants?  Basically, the yuppies caught up and\ndisciplined the hackers, and molded them in their own image.
OK, with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with QuickTime,\nthe effects of scaling and so on, I thought I'd do some more tests.\n\nFirst of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than\nrealistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a\nversion of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).\nI decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results\n(for better or for worse).\n\nI pulled out a copy of "2001: A Space Odyssey" that I had recorded off TV\na while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there's a sequence where\nthe Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized\na portion of about 30 seconds' duration, zooming in on the rotating space\nstation. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between\nframes. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only\n5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.\n\nI captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot\ncard in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then\nimported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,\nkeeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled\nto 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default\n"2.00" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten\nframes.\n\nI then ran the 320*240 movie through the same "Raw Speed Test" program I used\nfor the results I'd been reporting earlier.\n\nResult: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.\n\nThat's right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short\ntest movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard\ndisk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate\nwas only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk\n(also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.\n\nI modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional\nscaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240\nsize. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who\nobserved poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in\naction, not 1.5. I'd try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don't think it's\nentirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...\n\nUnscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.\n\nThe other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with\n"preferred" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played\nfrom within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime's normal synchronized playback).\nA preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn't work too well: the playback was\nvery jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with\nease. I can't believe that QuickTime's synchronization code would add this\nmuch overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system's task\nswitching.\n\nA preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn't see\nany evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight\nstutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.\n\nI guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the\nkey frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also\nimprove the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance\neven more...

Well, GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format and was put forth by\nCompuserve back in 1987(?) or so.  It was to create a format that could be\nread and displayed by any system.  GIF is limited to 8 bit color but has\na built in compression scheme (LZW?).\n\nIFF is not really a graphics format, but rather a standard way to package\nimages, sounds, animations, text, or whatever into one file.  IFF was\ncreated by Electronic Arts, I do believe (I could be wrong), for the Amiga.\nIt was quickly adopted as pretty much the standard file format for the Amiga.\nThe most common image format for the IFF package is an ILBM (InterLeaved\nBitMap?) but many others exist.  This format supports 24 bit color images.\n\nInformation on both of these and many more are available via anonymous ftp at\nzamenhof.cs.rice.edu in the directory /pub/graphics.formats\n(Taken from the FAQ for this news group.)  :)
Apollo (now HP) have a graphics board that does 80-bit graphics.  When I \nheard that, I jumped.  The answer isn't that it can do 100 trillion-trillion-\ntrillion colors.  It actually does 10 planes of 8-bits (or 5 planes of 16\nbits, etc.)  for very fast graphics.

And for the Commodore CDTV.
More people have been asking for information on the Kubota graphics\nworkstations, so here is some more info on the Kenai/Denali vs. the\nE&S Freedom.\n\n\nHere is the text of a Denali vs. E&S Freedom done by D.H. Brown Associates.\n\n------\n\nDenali bears a strong resemblance to Evans and Sutherlands Freedom graphics\nsubsystem in several aspects of its high-level design.  Both products use\na parallel array of 29050 processors for geometric computations.  Both\nhave a pixel router to connect this front end to a second array of\npixel processors.  As a result, Denali and Freedome overlap significantly\nin performance and functionality.  Both design teams also appear to have \nsimilar philosophies with respect to modularity, scalability, and market\npenetration.\n\nThere remain, however, several important differences between the KPC and\nE&S products.  Evans and Sutherland designed Freedom as a high-end\ndeveloper's dream system with plenty of performance potential and\nflexibility.  In its favor, Freedom has configurations from two to\nsixteen floating point units, a border range that starts and ends at\na higher price and performance levels than Denali.  All Freedom\nsystems include a large, fixed number of pixel processors that\nsupport a broader variety of color blending functions.  The Freedom\ndesign treats its entire image memory as general-purpose memory, allowing\ndevelopers to allocate it on a flexible basis to a number of special-purpose\napplications.  Finally, E&S provided Freedom with very flexible otput and\nvideo integration features for multimedia and simulation applications.  Note\nthat KPC is working an auxiliary board for NTSC and PAL output that will not\nrequire an external video encoder.  E&S programmable output features,\nhowever, will remain much more flexible.\n\nThe KPC design team, in contrast, made Denali more of an end-user's system.\nEntry version have better performance range and flexibility than low-end\nFreedom configurations, and come in at more realistic mainstream price\npoints.  Denali does not need as many 29050 modules as Freedome because\nit uses a deeper scan-conversion pipeline to support each one, resulting\nin better cost/performance characteristics.  Although both products provide\nstrong support for 3D, imaging, and volume rendering, KPC recognized that\nnot all users will want an even mix of these capabilities.  Denali's\nconfiguration flexibility allows customers in effect to purchase\ngeometric and pixel processing capabilities separately, and to upgrade\nthem separately as needed.\n\nBoth companies have implemented hardware texture mapping at\nworkstation price levels as a way to attack SGI's more expensive\nVGXT and RealityEngine systems -- the only other products to provide\nthis capability.  KPC supports point sampling and bilinear interpolation\nof textures in hardware, but provides only software support for the higher\nqualtiy tri-linear interpolated mipmapping method.  On balance, however, Denali\nprovideds bettern overall texturing capabilities than E&S for most applications.\nAside from being much more affordable, KPC solutions deliver more parallelism\nfor texture processing and more off-screen memory for general graphics\ndata storage.  By implementing texture mapping on its transformation\nmodules, E&S foces customers to move very quickly to higher price levels\nto obtain better texturing performance.  Kubota avoids this problem by linking\ntexturing to its Frame Buffer Modules, providing a lower-cost, more scalable\nsolution.\n\nHope this helps,\n\nBrian
Does anyone know of a fractal terrain generator for Mac, something\n	I could hopefully import into a 3D program like Swivel or Stratavision?\n	I know Infini-D has built in capabilities, but I don't have access to\n	Infini-D. I downloaded two programs from Umich, in graphics/fractals,\n	but both were from 1990-91 and crashed under System 7. I think they\n	were Black and white anyway. Please, email me if you know of anything,\n	as I don't check the newsgroups very often.\n		Thanks in advance.\n			Dan Bradley deb47099@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu

First of all, I don't see amongst\nthese newsgroups where there is anything remotely\nlike a GIF, TIF, or compiled shareware program?\n\nThanks in advance for any information you can\ngive me. (I know there is a Unix command, "ftp,"\nthat will allow me to do this, but first I\nneed to know where to go to find the file\nI want download via ftp, etc.\n\nThomas Helke\negret@wet.UUCP

Even if you don't agree\n: >with that definition of the word.\n:       ^^^  ^^^^^^^^^^ \n:  [....] The narrower view that a hacker, when\n:  associated with the computing environment, is a dishonest\n:  expert is not so widespread, I'm my opinion, at least with the\n:  people involved with the field. IMHO the wider meaning is not\n:  obsolete at all, no matter how much the lay press would like it to\n:  be!  [....]\n\n:  Therefore I conclude that if you call yourself a hacker, and somebody\n:  perceives you as a thief, then this person belongs to a very very\n:  small group that has some computer knowledge, but not enough to know\n:  the wider (and original) meaning of the word.  [....]\n\nUnfortunately, the general public has a very narrow view of the deep, dark\nrecesses of the art of computing.  What little they do see is from the view\ngiven to them by the media.  From what I have seen from the media, 'hacker'\nis not a proper way by which to refer to a respected person.\n\nI, on the other hand, know what 'hacker' means from those who consider\nthemselves such.  Following is the definition from "Jargon File 2.9.10".\n(This is also known as the "Hackers Dictionary".)  The definitions are\narranged in order of decreasing frequency of usage:\n\n   :hacker: [originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe] n.\n     1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable\n     systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most\n     users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.  2. One who\n     programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys\n     programming rather than just theorizing about programming.  3. A\n     person capable of appreciating {hack value}.  4. A person who is\n     good at programming quickly.  5. An expert at a particular program,\n     or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in 'a UNIX\n     hacker'.  (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who\n     fit them congregate.)  6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind.  One\n     might be an astronomy hacker, for example.  7. One who enjoys the\n     intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing\n     limitations.  8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to\n     discover sensitive information by poking around.  Hence 'password\n     hacker', 'network hacker'.  See {cracker}.\n\n     The term 'hacker' also tends to connote membership in the global\n     community defined by the net (see {network, the} and\n     {Internet address}).  It also implies that the person described\n     is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ehic (see\n     {hacker ethic, the}).\n\n     It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe\n     oneself that way.  Hackers consider themselves something of an\n     elite (a meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new\n     members are gladly welcome.  There is thus a certain ego\n     satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker (but if\n     you claim to be one and are not, you'll quickly be labeled\n     {bogus}).  See also {wannabee}.\n\n   :hacker ethic, the: n.  1. The belief that information-sharing\n     is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of\n     hackers to share their expertise by writing free software and\n     facilitating access to information and to computing resources\n     wherever possible.  2. The belief that system-cracking for fun\n     and exploration is ethically OK as long as the cracker commits\n     no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality.\n\n     Both of these normative ethical principles are widely, but by no\n     means universally) accepted among hackers. Most hackers subscribe\n     to the hacker ethic in sense 1, and many act on it by writing and\n     giving away free software.  A few go further and assert that\n     *all* information should be free and *any* proprietary\n     control of it is bad; this is the philosophy behind the {GNU}\n     project.\n\n     Sense 2 is more controversial: some people consider the act of\n     cracking itself to be unethical, like breaking and entering.\n     But this principle at least moderates the behavior of people who\n     see themselves as `benign' crackers (see also {samurai}).  On\n     this view, it is one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy\n     to (a) break into a system, and then (b) explain to the sysop,\n     preferably by email from a {superuser} account, exactly how it\n     was done and how the hole can be plugged --- acting as an\n     unpaid (an unsolicited) {tiger team}.\n\n     The most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker\n     ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share\n     technical tricks, software, and (where possible) computing\n     resources with other hackers.  Huge cooperative networks such as\n     {USENET}, {Fidonet} and Internet (see {Internet address})\n     can function without central control because of this trait; they\n     both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be\n     hackerdom's most valuable intangible asset.\n\n:  Finally, a true hacker does not name himself/herself one, for this is\n:  a title that is bestowed by the befuddled sysadmins and users at large.\n: To me, a sign of a truly great hacker is to be introduced to someone who\n: says "Nahh, I just know a thing or two, people always exagerate..." :-)\n\nNote that the above definition does not preclude a hacker from describing\nlimself (meaning: himself/herself) one, but simply says that it is better\nnot to do so.  There are many who do not know the meaning of 'hacker'.  So,\nin order to defend the true meaning of the word, it is sometimes necessary\nto borrow on the reputation of a known (respected) hacker around the\nworkplace.  (This means that 'hacker' is defined in terms of some well-known\nand respected person.)  Sometimes, there may only be one such person.\n\n: >No matter what Mr. Dumpty says, language doesn't work that way.\n:  Actually it does, you just have to get adequate press coverage... :-)\n\nLanguage works anyway that we want it to work.  The purpose of language is\nto communicate.  To oversimplify: As long as communication is taking place,\nthen language is working.

Is there a comp.graphics FAQ and if so, where?
Adobe Streamline has been out four a couple of years. It does a much better\njob than the autotracing functions which are built into illustration\nprograms. Of course, a higher resolution bitmap will produce a more\naccurate trace. The problem that I've run into though, is that when it\ncreates a detailed trace, it produces WAY more points than are necessary.\nIf I trace something manually, I use many less es points. The problem\nwith this is it produces BIG files which slow everything down, especially\nprinting.\n\nChuck

There are some tricks to installing ATM to windows... install them first\nto dos, then run the ATM control panel to get them into windows.\n\nThe best reason for ATM is that Adobe IS the standard.  Truetype is a\nfailed MS venture to undercut Adobe when Adobe was being nasty about\nkeeping their formats proprietary.  Just about any service bureau or print\nshop will smirk and send you on your way if you bring a TrueType document\nto them for high resolution printing or ripping.\n\nAlthough there are lots of pretty TT fonts floating around, they are really\nfor dot matrix or your own lazer printer.\nHowever, you can convert your TT fonts with Fontmonger or some similar program\nto ATM fonts for high end stuff.\n\nIf you are using dot matrix for all your printing, you may have wasted\nyour money!
Hi -- sorry if this is a FAQ, but are there any conversion utilities\navailable for Autodesk *.DXF to Amiga *.IFF format?  I\nchecked the comp.graphics FAQ and a number of sites, but so far\nno banana.  Please e-mail.\n\nThanks.
First of all (this is NOT a snide response), if you're confused about\nthis issue, you will stumble over a lot of other things as well.  I suggest\nthat the weakness is your reference material.  Get "An Introduction to Ray\nTracing" by Andrew Glassner for very good coverage of the raytracing\nalgorithm.  You could also refer to the 2nd edition of Foley & Van Dam.\n\n    On to the question.  The simple answer is that you just keep adding up\nall the contributions and then clamping at the maximum intensity.  For\nexample, if your intensity values range from 0.0 to 1.0, then keep adding up\nand clamp the resultant values to 1.0 (you might have to clamp the lower\nbound to 0.0 if you have dark bulbs, but that's another issue =^).  So, you\nget some illumination equation like this:\n\n        I = Lambient + Ldiffuse(light[n]) + Lreflected + Ltransparent\n\n    The contribution due to reflection is just summed with the light\nintensity, as is the light due to transparency.  Now, a slightly less\nhand-waving illumination equation is this:\n\n        I = KaLa + KdLd(light[n]) + KrLr + KtLt\n\n    That is, each component of the illumination equation is governed by the\nmaterial constants Ka, Kd, Kr and Kt.  So the maximum you can get from\ntransparency for a given object, for example, might be [0.4, 0.1, 0.5] for a\npurple-colored glass object.\n\n    Hopefully this answers your question.  I'll forward my "illumination\nequation sermon" to you also.

JPEG is designed for compressing either\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of "natural", real-world scenes.\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\ndrawings.\n\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\nrespectively.\n\nJPEG is "lossy", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\nthe fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\ninvisible to the eye.\n\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\nfiles if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\naren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\n\n\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\n\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\n\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\n\nIf your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\n\nIt's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\nextra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\n\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\n\n\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\n\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\ngray-scale images of "realistic" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\n\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\nby GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\n\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\nparticularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.\n\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\n\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\n\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\na GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\nconvert well.\n\n\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\n\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\nsoftware described in section 6B.\n\nFile	   Size in bytes		Comments\n\nship.ppm	1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\n			 or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\nship.ppm.Z	 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\n			 compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.\n			 Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\nship.gif	 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\n			 Most of the savings is the result of losing color\n			 info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\n\nship.jpg95	 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\n			 This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\n			 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\nship.jpg75	  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\n			 You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\n			 from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\nship.jpg50	  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\n			 This has slight defects; if you know what to look\n			 for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing\n			 the original.  Still as good image quality as many\n			 recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\nship.jpg25	  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\n			 JPEG's characteristic "blockiness" becomes apparent\n			 at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\n			 Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\n			 of poorer image quality than this.\nship.jpg5o	   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\n			 Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\n			 indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\n			 the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\n\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\nratio for real-world scenes.\n\n\n[5]  What are good "quality" settings for JPEG?\n\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\nthe meaning of these settings.  "Quality 95" does NOT mean "keep 95% of the\ninformation", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\nit's not a percentage of anything.\n\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\n\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\n\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\n\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as "op art".\n\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\nquality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just\n"high"/"medium"/"low"-style choices.)\n\n\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\n\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\nIf you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article "How to find sources".\n(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\n"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources" in the body.  The "Anonymous FTP\nList FAQ" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\nthe news.answers archive.\n\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\n\n\n[6A]  If you are looking for "canned" software, viewers, etc:\n\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\nkind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\n\nX Windows:\n\nXV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other\nimage formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image\nmanipulations.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),\nfile contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support\nfor 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new\nand still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding\nedge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that\nversion 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll get\nonly 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works\nfine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a\nglitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the "save at normal size" checkbox\nwhen saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.\n\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package,\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\nbasic free JPEG software.\n\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\nfile contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\n\n\nMS-DOS:\n\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\n\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\nThe current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\nnot flashy, but it's functional.\n\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\n\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\nVESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\nthat the driver is missing.)\n\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\nthe net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it.\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\n\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good:\nit's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\n\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any*\nof them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\nhave hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\nthing with hi-color displays.)\n\nThe Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\n\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\nparticular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\n\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.\n\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\nrefers to directory (eg) "msdos/graphics" at Simtel20, that really means\n"pd1:<msdos.graphics>".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\nin (eg) "/pub/msdos/graphics".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\n\nMicrosoft Windows:\n\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\ndue to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\n\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\nBut it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\n\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG\nfiles, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\n\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\n286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version,\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\n\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\n\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\nmode, not in a window.\n\nOS/2:\n\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\nNote: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\n/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip\n    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip\n    Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.

GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing\n    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed\n    as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.\n\nMacintosh:\n\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\n\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\n\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\nlike this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very\nwell thought out.\n\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.)\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\n\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\n\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\n\nApple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\nit, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\n\nStorm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\ndownloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\n\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\ndon't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\n\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\nJPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\n\nAmiga:\n\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\n\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\n\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\n\nViewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\namiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.\n\nIf you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\n\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\n\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are "AugJPEG", "NewAmyJPEG",\n"VJPEG", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\nit's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\n\nAtari ST:\n\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\nThese programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\n\nFor monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level\ngrayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.\n\nI have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for\nAtaris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.\n\nAcorn Archimedes:\n\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\n\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\n\nThere's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\nformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,\nCambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.\n\n\nPortable software for almost any system:\n\nIf none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free\nJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program.\nIf your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa\nor PPM 24-bit image files.\n\nThere are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every\nday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether\nthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can\nhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are\nnot and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.\n\n\n[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:\n\nFree, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent\nJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,\ndocumentation, and some small test files is available from several places.\nThe "official" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9\nor 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release\nis jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to\nretrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.\nIf you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may\nprefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\nabove), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on\nCompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.\nIf you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest\ncomp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.\n(If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ\narticle "How to find sources", referred to at the top of section 6.)\n\nThe free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG "JFIF" format and image\nfiles in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.\nThe core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other\nprograms, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have\ntested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.\n\nWe have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.\nCompanies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.\nWe do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in\nproduct literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).\nWe hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with\nanything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.\n\nThe Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to\ncontribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.\n\n\n[7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?\n\nMost people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.\nTypical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display\n256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\ncolors.  This process is called "color quantization".  (This is something\nof a misnomer, "color selection" would be a better term.  We're stuck with\nthe standard usage though.)\n\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\n\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\nThis happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets "smeared"\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\n\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\nposted images described as "256-color JPEG".  This tells me that the poster\n(a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\nnumber of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)\n\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\npalette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.)\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to.\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\nFurthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization\nalgorithm, you're out of luck.\n\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\nfor all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware.\nJPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was\nsent.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\n\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\nhardware already: 15-bit "hi-color" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\nin a machine-independent fashion.\n\n\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\n\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\ncoding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\n\n\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\n\nThere's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\n\nSaying "-Q 100" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\n"-sample 1x1" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\n\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\nvalue; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\n\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\n\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\n\n\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\n\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\nstandards organizations.\n\nSince we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\n"do their own thing", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with\nanybody else's.\n\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\nthat's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a "low-end" format that transports\n    pixels and not much else.\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\n    a "high-end" format that will let you record just about everything you\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\nof JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\n\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported "lowest common\ndenominator"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\n\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\n\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\n\n\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\n\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\n\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.\n\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\n    "raw JPEG" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\n    it's worth a try, anyway.\n\n3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\n    won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\n\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\n\n5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\n    try stripping off everything before that.\n\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\n\n	"begin" line\n	M_]C_X ...\n\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\n\n	"begin" line\n	M:'-I ...\n\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\n\n\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\n\nThe JPEG spec defines two different "back end" modules for the final output\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\n\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\nfrom these companies.  (The "fair use" doctrine allows people to implement\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\nat best.)\n\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\n\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\n\n\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\n\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\nfirst time around.\n\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\nfree JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\n\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\n(If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move.\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\nthat's a mighty limited capability!)\n\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\ntransmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\n\n\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\n\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\nloss of quality.\n\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\ndon't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\n\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\nDon't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\n\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts ("ghost" edges).  Do yourself\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\nsystem, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\nway to do this.)\n\ncjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\n\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually "dithered" to fool\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\ncolor noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\nTo get around this, you want to "smooth" the GIF image before compression.\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\nthan you'd get without smoothing.\n\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\ncapability is built in.  Try "-smooth 10" or so when converting GIFs.\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\nthe output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\n\nThe upshot of all this is that "cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10" is probably a\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\nimage, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\n\n\n---------------------\n\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.

From article <1993May1.092058.1@aurora.alaska.edu>, by pstlb@aurora.alaska.edu:\n\n\nSince this was posted on comp.ai, I assume there is an AI angle to this.  Hacking is\nwhat AI students do when they're really supposed to be doing something else, e.g.\nthesis research & write up, getting their supervisors' pet programs to run properly,\netc.  No-one gets much glory for hacking, and no-one gets any money out of it.\nProducing good free software requires an enormous investment of time & resources that\nnot many people can, or want to, afford - particularly during a recession.\n\nIn addition, over the last 10 years, I think there has been a de-emphasis on producing\nrunning programs in AI research, and a greater emphasis on more formal approaches to\nproblem-solving.  Students have been proving theorems instead of writing programs.\nAt a conference a year or two ago, Johann de Kleer suggested that everyone should\n'Get back to the keyboard' and write more programs that demonstrate their ideas -\nand I have to say I'm inclined to agree.\n\n(I don't claim to be a superhacker, but I don't think that invalidates my remarks.\nAnd I'm sure this isn't the whole story.)

For a more verbose\nexplanation, see any of the above references, starting with:\n\nThe Foley & Van Dam & Feiner & Hughes "Computer Graphics" book is certainly\na good start.  Chapter 6 is "Viewing in 3D", then read chapter 15,\n"Visible-Surface Determination".  For more information go to chapter 16 for\nshading, chapter 19 for clipping, and branch out from there.\n\n\n3) Quantizing 24 bit images down to 8 bits.\n\nFind a copy of "Color Image Quantization for Frame Buffer Display" by\nPaul Heckbert, SIGGRAPH '82 Proceedings, page 297.  There are other\nalgorithms, but this one works well and is fairly simple.  Implementations\nare included in most raster toolkits (see item 7 below).\n\nA variant method is described in "Graphics Gems", p. 287-293.  Note that\nthe code from the "Graphics Gems" series is all available from an FTP site,\nas described above.\n\nCheck out John Bradley's "Diversity Algorithm", which is incorporated into\nthe xv package and described in the back of the manual.\n\nThe ImageMagick package (see section 7 for where it is) contains another\nquantizing algorithm which is presented as "doing a better job than the\nother algorithms, but slower".\n\nThere's also an implementation of:\n\nWan, Wong, and Prusinkiewicz, _An Algorithm for Multidimensional Data\nClustering_, Transactions on Mathematical Software, Vol. 14 #2 (June, 1988),\npp. 153-162.\n\navialable as princeton.edu:pub/Graphics/colorquant.shar.  This code,\nin modified form, appears in the Utah Raster Toolkit as well.\n\n\n4) Converting color into grayscale.\n\nThe NTSC formula is:\n\n    luminosity = .299 red + .587 green + .114 blue\n\n\n5) Quantizing grayscale to black&white.\n\nThe only reference you need for this stuff is:\n\n    Digital Halftoning, Robert Ulichney, MIT Press 1987, ISBN 0-262-21009-6\n\nBut before you go off and start coding, check out the image manipulation\nsoftware mentioned in item 7 below.  All of the packages mentioned can do\nsome form of gray to b&w conversion.\n\n\n6) Rotating a raster image by an arbitrary angle.\n\nThe obvious but wrong method is to loop over the pixels in the source\nimage, transform each coordinate, and copy the pixel to the destination.\nThis is wrong because it leaves holes in the destination.  Instead,\nloop over the pixels in the destination image, apply the *reverse*\ntransformation to the coordinates, and copy that pixel from the source.\nThis method is quite general, and can be used for any one-to-one\n2-D mapping, not just rotation.  You can add anti-aliasing by doing\nsub-pixel sampling.\n\nHowever, there is a much faster method, with antialising included,\nwhich involves doing three shear operations.  The method was originally\ncreated for the IM Raster Toolkit (see below); an implementation is\nalso present in PBMPLUS.  Reference: "A Fast Algorithm for Raster\nRotation", by Alan Paeth (awpaeth@watcgl.waterloo.edu) Graphics\nInterface '86 (Vancouver).  An article on the IM toolkit appears in\nthe same journal.  An updated version of the rotation paper appears\nin "Graphics Gems" (see section [1]) under the original title.\n\n\n7) Free image manipulation software.\n\nThere are a number of toolkits for converting from one image format to\nanother, doing simple image manipulations such as size scaling, plus\nthe above-mentioned 24 -> 8, color -> gray, gray -> b&w conversions.\nHere are pointers to some of them:\n\n    xv by John Bradley.

There is a regular monthly FITS basics and\ninformation posting on sci.astro.fits - read it if you want to know more.\n\n\n\n9) Converting between vector formats.\n\nA lot of people ask about converting from HPGL to PostScript, or MacDraw\nto CGM, or whatever.  It is important to understand that this is a very\ndifferent problem from the image format conversions in item 7.  Converting\none image format to another is a fairly easy problem, since once you\nget past all the file header junk, a pixel is a pixel -- the basic objects\nare the same for all image formats.  This is not so for vector formats.\nThe basic objects -- circles, ellipses, drop-shadowed pattern-filled\nround-cornered rectangles, etc. -- vary from one format to another.\nExcept in extremely restricted cases, it is simply not possible to do\na one-to-one conversion between vector formats.\n\nThere is software for converting to and from CGM files on ftp.psc.edu.  The\ncontributor states that it runs on Unix, MS-Windows, and possibly the Mac.\nA better, more specific blurb would be most welcome.\n\nOn the other hand, it is quite possible to do a close approximation,\nrendering an image from one format using the primitives from another.\nAs far as I know, no one has put together a general toolkit of such\nconverters, but two different HPGL to PostScript converters have been\nposted to comp.sources.misc.  Check the index on your nearest archive\nsite.\n\nA related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format\nto a bitmapped image - from PostScript to Sun raster format, or HPGL to\nX11 bitmap.  For example, some of the commercial PostScript clones for\nPC's allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer.  Also,\nthe PostScript interpreters in the NeXT box and in Sun's X11/NeWs can\nbe used to render to a file if you're clever.  But in general, the\nanswer is no.  However, if someone were to put together a vector to\nvector conversion toolkit, adding a vector to raster converter would be\ntrivial.\n\nGNU ghostscript (from the FSF - current version 2.5.2) includes\ndrivers for both ppm and gif format files, thus it can be used as\na PostScript to ppm  or a PostScript to GIF filter.  (It implements\nessentially all of PostScript level 1 and alot of Display PostScript\nand level 2).\n\n\n10) How to get Pixar films.\n\nThe various John Lasseter / Pixar computer animated shorts are available\non video tape.  You can order them from Direct Cinema Limited:\n\n    Film                           Individual Price      Institutional Price\n    Luxo, Jr.				$14.95			$50.00\n    Red's Dream				$19.95			$75.00\n    Tin Toy				$24.95			$75.00\n    Knickknack				$24.95			$75.00\n    Luxo, Jr./Red's Dream/Tin Toy	$39.95			$100.00\n\nAll tapes are on 1/2" VHS NTSC.  Add $10/tape for PAL format.  Also\navailable:\n\n    Tin Toy T-shirt			$15.00\n    Knickknack 3D T-shirt		$15.00 (includes glasses)\n\nFor individual orders, add $5 S&H for the first tape or shirt, $2 for\neach additional tape or shirt.  For institutional orders, add $5 S&H\nfor the first tape, $3 for each additional tape.  Foreign shipping, add\n$3/tape or shirt.  Call 800-525-0000 (213-396-4774 international,\n213-396-3233 FAX) to charge to your credit card.  Call first to verify\nprices and availability.  Or, just write to:\n\n    Direct Cinema Limited\n    1749 14th Street\n    Santa Monica, CA 90404-4342\n\nAllan Braunsdorf has this to say:\n\nAt SIGGRAPH they were selling a tape with all four shorts\nfor $25.  That was a sale price.  You can get it for slightly\nmore than that normally.  ($35 maybe.)  I believe it's\navailable from RenderMan Retail (at Pixar's address).\n\n    Pixar\n    1001 West Cutting Blvd.\n    Richmond, CA. 94804\n    (510) 236-4000 \n    (510) 236-0388 (FAX)\n\nYou can obtain a video directly from Pixar which contains "Luxo, Jr.", "Red's\nDream", "Tin Toy" and "Knicknack" for $25.00, plus $2.50 for shipping. They\nwill take your order over the phone or via FAX with a major credit card. I \nordered mine just last week and received it several days later. Don't expect \nto be able to rent a copy from your local video store. According to the license\nagreement printed on the back cover of the case, it cannot be rented.\n\n\n11) How do I draw a circle as a Bezier (or B-spline) curve?\n\nThe short answer is, "You can't."  Unless you use a rational spline you\ncan only approximate a circle.  The approximation may look acceptable,\nbut it is sensitive to scale.  Magnify the scale and the error of\napproximation magnifies.  Deviations from circularity that were not\nvisible in the small can become glaring in the large.  If you want to\ndo the job right, consult the article:\n\n  "A Menagerie of Rational B-Spline Circles"\n  by Leslie Piegl and Wayne Tiller\n  in IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, volume 9, number 9,\n  September, 1989, pages 48-56.\n\nFor rough, non-rational approximations, consult the book:\n\n  Computational Geometry for Design and Manufacture\n  by I. D. Faux and M. J. Pratt,\n  Ellis Horwood Publishers, Halsted Press, John Wiley 1980.\n\nFor the best known non-rational approximations, consult the article:\n\n  "Good Approximation of Circles by Curvature-continuous Bezier Curves"\n  by Tor Dokken, Morten Daehlen, Tom Lyche, and Knut Morken\n  in Computer Aided Geometric Design, volume 7, numbers 1-4 (combined),\n  June, 1990, pages 33-41 [Elsevier Science Publishers (North-Holland)]\n\n\n12) How to order standards documents.\n\nThe American National Standards Institute sells ANSI standards, and also\nISO (international) standards.  Their sales office is at 1-212-642-4900,\nmailing address is 1430 Broadway, NY NY 10018.  It helps if you have the\ncomplete name and number.\n\nSome useful numbers to know:\n\nCGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) is ISO 8632-4 (1987).  GKS (Graphical\nKernel System) is ANSI X3.124-1985.  PHIGS (Programmer's Hierarchical\nInteractive Graphics System) is ANSI X3.144-1988.  IGES is ASME/ANSI\nY14.26M-1987.  Language bindings are often separate but related numbers;\nfor example, the GKS FORTRAN binding is X3.124.1-1985.\n\nStandards-in-progress are made available at key milestones to solicit\ncomments from the graphical public (this includes you!).  ANSI can let\nyou know where to order them; most are available from Global Engineering\nat 1-800-854-7179.\n\n\n13) How to FTP by email.\n\nThere are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups\nand make them available via an email query system.  You send a message\nto an automated server saying something like "send comp.sources.unix/fbm",\nand a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.\n\nIn addition, there is at least one FTP-by-mail server.  Send mail to\nftpmail@decwrl.dec.com saying "help" and it will tell you how to use\nit.  Note that this service has at times been turned off due to abuse.\n\n\n14) How to tell whether a point is within a planar polygon.\n\nConsider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing to\ninfinity.  If it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way,\nthe point is within the polygon.  If the ray crosses an even number of\nedges, the point is either outside the polygon, or within an interior\nhole formed from intersecting polygon edges.  This idea is known in\nthe trade as the Jordan curve theorem; see Eric Haines' article in\nGlassner's ray tracing book (above) for more information, including\ntreatment of special cases.\n\nAnother method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to all\nthe vertices on the polygon.  If the sum is 2 pi, the point is inside,\nif the sum is 0 the point is outside.  However, this method is about an\norder of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating the\ntrigonometric functions is usually quite costly.\n\nCode for both methods (plus barycentric triangle testing) can be found in\nthe Ray Tracing News, Vol. 5, No. 3, available from princeton.edu:\npub/Graphics/RTNews/RTNv5n3.Z.\n\n\n15) How to tessellate a sphere.\n\nOne simple way is to do recursive subdivision into triangles.  The\nbase of the recursion is an octahedron, and then each level divides\neach triangle into four smaller ones.  Jon Leech <leech@cs.unc.edu>\nhas posted a nice routine called sphere.c that generates the coordinates.\nIt's available for FTP on ftp.ee.lbl.gov and princeton.edu.\n\n16) Specific references on ray-tracing and global illumination.\n\nRick Speer maintains a cross-indexed ray-tracing bibliography:\n\nHighlights of this edition-\n\n    i) more than 500 citations spanning the period from 1968 through\n       November '91;\n    ii) papers from all Siggraph, Graphics Interface, Eurographics, CG\n        International and Ausgraph proceedings through December, '91;\n    iii) all citations keyworded for easy lookup;\n    iv) cross-indices by keyword and author;\n    v)  glossary of the 119 keywords used.\n\nThe bib is in the form of a PostScript file.  The printout is 41 pages long.\nBelow is a list of ftp sites and the dirs that contain the file. It's named\n"speer.raytrace.bib.ps.Z" and is compressed at most sites-\n\n             Site                             Dir\n	wuarchive.wustl.edu	graphics/graphics/bib/RT.BIB.Speer/\n	karazm.math.uh.edu	pub/Graphics/\n	gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au	pub/papers/\n	nic.funet.fi		pub/sci/papers/graphics\n	coral.cs.jcu.edu.au     graphics/papers/\n\nEric Haines (erich@eye.com) maintains ray tracing and radiosity/global\nillumination bibliographies.  These are in "refer" format, and so can be\nsearched electronically (a simple awk script to search for keywords is\nincluded with each).  The bibliographies are available at most of the\nsites listed above, and the most current versions are maintained at\nprinceton.edu: pub/Graphics/Papers as "RayBib.*" and "RadBib.*".\n\nTom Wilson (wilson@cs.ucf.edu) has collected over 300 abstracts from ray\ntracing related research papers and books.  The information is essentially\nin plaintext, and Latex and troff formatting programs are included.  This\ncollection is available at most of the sites above as "rtabs.*".\n\n17) SIGGRAPH information online\n\n[from Steve Cunningham and Ralph Orlick]\n\nACM-SIGGRAPH announces its online information site at  siggraph.org\n(128.248.245.250).  This site now provides SIGGRAPH information via both\nanonymous ftp and an electronic mail archive server.\n\nThe anonymous ftp service is very standard, and the ftp directory includes\nboth conference and publications subdirectories.\n\nTo retrieve information by electronic mail, send mail to\n     archive-server@siggraph.org\nand in the subject or the body of the message include the message  send\nfollowed by the topic and subtopic you wish.  A good place to start is with\nthe command\n     send index\nwhich will give you an up-to-date list of available information.\n\n\n18) SIGGRAPH Panels Proceedings available\n\n[from Steve Cunningham and Bob Judd]\n\nACM SIGGRAPH announces the availability of the SIGGRAPH '91 Panels Proceedings\nat the  siggraph.org  site (128.248.245.250).  The proceedings are available\nin three formats:\n     text   (ASCII)\n     rtf    (rich text format, suitable for many word processors)\n     word   (MS Word for the Macintosh)\nThey may be retrieved from siggraph.org in two ways:\n\n(1) by anonymous ftp\n    change to one of the directories\n       publications/s91/panels_proceedings/[text|rtf|word]\n    The text and rtf files may be downloaded in ASCII mode, while the word\n    files are stored in MacBinary format and must be downloaded in binary \n    mode.\n\n    Each directory contains a Table of Contents file (TOC) that describes the\n    contents of each panel file.\n\n(2) by electronic mail\n    send mail to\n       archive-server@siggraph.org\n    You can retrieve either the  text  or  rtf  files.  We suggest that you\n    first retrieve the index files by putting one of the messages\n       send panel91-txt index\n       send panel91-rtf index\n    in the subject or body of the message.  You will get the necessary\n    information to retrieve the actual transcript files.\n\n\n19) Graphics mailing lists\n\nThere are a variety of graphics-related mailing list out there, each\ncovering either a single product or a single topic.  I have been an\nactive participant in one of these for some time now, and find the\nfocus and expertise which can be brought to bear on an isolated topic\nto be nothing short of amazing.\n\nPlease send me the appropriate information if you have any others you\nwould like to see added.\n\nName:		Imagine mailing list\nDescription:	Discussion forum for users of the Imagine 3D Rendering and\n		Animation package by Impulse, Inc.\nPlatforms:	Amiga, IBM\nSubscription:	imagine-request@email.sp.paramax.com\nPosting:	imagine@email.sp.paramax.com\n\nName:		DCTV mailing list\nDescription:	Discussion forum for users of the Digital Creations DCTV\n		box, software, and file formats\nPlatforms:	Amiga\nSubscription:	DCTV-request@nova.cc.purdue.edu\nPosting:	DCTV@nova.cc.purdue.edu\n\nName:		Rayshade Users mailing list\nDescription:	Discussion forum for users of the Rayshade raytracer\nPlatforms:	Most UNIX boxes, Amiga, Mac, IBM\nSubscription:	rayshade-request@cs.princeton.edu\nPosting:	rayshade-users@cs.princeton.edu\n\nName:		Lightwave 3D software for Toaster mailing list\nDescription:	Discussion forum for users of Lightwave, the Video\n		Toaster modelling and rendering package\nPlatforms:	Amiga\nSubscription:	lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com\n		with "subscribe lightwave-l" in your message\nPosting:	lightwave@bobsbox.rent.com\n\nName:		POV mailing list\nDescription:	Discussion forum for DKBTrace and POV renderers\nPlatforms:	Unix\nSubscription:	listserv@trearn.bitnet\nPosting:	dkb-l@trearn.bitnet\n\nName:		Mailing List For Massive Parallel Rendering\nDescription:	same?\nPlatforms:	Unix\nSubscription:	mp-render-request@icase.edu\nPosting:	mp-render@icase.edu\n\n20) Specific references on file formats\n\n    Graphics File Formats, David Kay and John Levine, Windcrest/McGraw-Hill\n      1992, ISBN 0-8306-3059-7 paper, ISBN 0-8306-3060-0 $36.95 hardcover,\n      ISBN 0-8306-3059-7 $24.95 paper.

It is portable and usable upon\na wide variety of platforms.  It is quite limited in some ways (yes, the\nkeeper of the FAQ has some opinions after all), and in fact, I don't like\nit much.  However, it looks to me like the most-Frequently Asked Question\nwhich was not previously covered in this list.  The following is a list\nof newsgroups and the like where one could go to find out about GIF.\n\nSubject: alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - General info\nSubject: alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - OS specific info\nNewsgroups: alt.binaries.pictures.d,alt.binaries.pictures.misc,\n	alt.binaries.pictures.utilities,alt.binaries.pictures.fractals,\n	alt.binaries.pictures.fine-art.d,news.answers\n\nAvailable in the indicated USENET newsgroup(s), or via anonymous ftp from\npit-manager.mit.edu in the files:\n\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2\n\nAlso available from mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu by sending a mail\nmessage containing any or all of:\n\nsend usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1\nsend usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2\n\nSend a message containing "help" to get general information about the\nmail server.\n\nAlso, you could check out the resources described in sections 7, 8, and\n20 above for more information.\n\n\n22) What is morphing?\n\nWarping is the deformation of an image by mapping each pixel to a new\nlocation. Morphing is blending from one image or object to another one.\nValerie Hall has written an excellent introduction to warping and\nmorphing. This is available for anonymous ftp from marsh.cs.curtin.edu.au\nin the directory pub/graphics/bibliography/Morph. There are three files:\n\n        morph_intro.ps.Z     (PostScript version, many pictures - 1.5M)\n        morph_intro.txt.Z    (text version)\n        m_responses.Z        (Responses to morphing questions)\n\nThe files are compressed, so you must use binary transfer and\nuncompress them afterwards.\n\n\n23) How to ray-trace height fields\n\nHeight fields are a special case in ray-tracing.  They have a number of uses,\nsuch as terrain rendering, and some optimization is possible.  Thus, they\nget their own FAQ section.  Note that further references can no doubt be\nlocated via the ray-tracing bibs in section 16 above.\n\nThe following paper seems to be the definitive reference:\n\nF. Kenton Musgrave\nGrid Tracing: Fast Ray Tracing For Height Fields\nJuly, 1988\n<musg88.ps.Z>\n\nThis is available as "Research Report YALEU/DCS/RR-639" from Yale University,\nit's also in the SIGGRAPH '91 Fractal Modeling in 3D Computer Graphics and\nImaging course notes, and (best of all) it's available on the net:\n\n    nic.funet.fi		pub/sci/papers/musg88.ps.Z\n    weedeater.math.yale.edu	pub/Papers/musg88.ms.Z\n    princeton.edu		pub/Graphics/Papers/musg88.ms.Z\n    coral.cs.jcu.edu.au		graphics/papers/musg88.ps.Z\n    gondwana.ecr.mu.OZ.AU	pub/papers/musg88.ms.Z and musg88.ps.Z\n\nAn implementation of this paper may be found in Rayshade.\n\nAnother paper exists:\n\n%A David W.

The . represents the dot product operator and the x\nrepresents the cross product operator.  Sigma represents the summation\noperator.  | | represents the absolute value operator.  Pn+1 is equal\nto P0.\n\n\n25) How to join ACM/SIGGRAPH\n\nProbably the easiest way to join ACM/SIGGRAPH is to trot over to your\nlocal technical library and find a copy of Communications of the ACM.\nSomewhere within the first few pages will be an application blank.\nFill it out and mail it in.  ACM membership for students costs $23.00,\nVoting or Associate Membership $77.00 (yearly)\n\nSIGGRAPH student membership costs an additional $16.00, $26.00 for\nVoting or Associate Members (also yearly).  To get TOG (Transactions\non Graphics) it's another $26.00 for students and $31.00 for Voting or\nAssociate Members.\n\nIf you just want to join SIGGRAPH without joining ACM, it'll cost you\n$59.00 (no student discount).\n\nThere are surcharges for overseas airmailing of publications.\n\nACM Member services may be contacted via email at acmhelp@acmvm.bitnet. \nTheir phone number is (212) 626-0500.

The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a\n   version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).\n   I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results\n   (for better or for worse).\n\n   I pulled out a copy of "2001: A Space Odyssey" that I had recorded off TV\n   a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there's a sequence where\n   the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized\n   a portion of about 30 seconds' duration, zooming in on the rotating space\n   station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between\n   frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only\n   5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.\n\n   I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot\n   card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then\n   imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,\n   keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled\n   to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default\n   "2.00" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten\n   frames.\n\n   I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same "Raw Speed Test" program I used\n   for the results I'd been reporting earlier.\n\n   Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.\n\n   That's right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short\n   test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard\n   disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate\n   was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk\n   (also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.\n\n   I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional\n   scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240\n   size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who\n   observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in\n   action, not 1.5. I'd try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don't think it's\n   entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...\n\n   Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.\n\n   The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with\n   "preferred" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played\n   from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime's normal synchronized playback).\n   A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn't work too well: the playback was\n   very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with\n   ease. I can't believe that QuickTime's synchronization code would add this\n   much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system's task\n   switching.\n\n   A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn't see\n   any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight\n   stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.\n\n   I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the\n   key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also\n   improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance\n   even more...\n\n   Lawrence D'Oliveiro                       fone: +64-7-856-2889\n   Computer Services Dept                     fax: +64-7-838-4066\n   University of Waikato            electric mail: ldo@waikato.ac.nz\n   Hamilton, New Zealand    37^ 47' 26" S, 175^ 19' 7" E, GMT+12:00\n\n\nI'm afraid I missed the start of this thread, but there are three factors that\ncan significantly affect QuickTime's playback speed that you may want to take\ninto account:\n\n(1) playback bit depth (things are fastest when you play a\nmovie back at the bit depth it was compressed for, this is usually 8 or 16\nbit, but other depths are (of course) possible).\n\n(2) type of scaling (QT is optimized for "double size" scaling, other scaling\nfactors hit peformance much harder).\n\n(3) playback window position (MoviePlayer limits your window placement choices\nto advantagous pixel boundaries by default, I'm not sure about Premiere).\n\nAny combination of those can radically alter playback performance.  Image size\nis, of course, another biggie.  Giving the movie player lots of RAM can also\nmake a real difference.\n\nForgive me if these were mentioned earlier in the thread...\n\n-Peter Lee

----------------------   LightWave3D Mail-List   ----------------------\n\n-- WHAT IS LightWave? --\n\nLightWave3D is part of a suite of programs that come bundled with a\ndevice called the "Toaster" (from NewTek, Inc.) that operates on an\nAmiga platform.  The LightWave software (LightWave=LightWave3D and\nLightWave Modeler) allows and artist to create three dimensional\nphoto-realistic images for a variety of purposes.\n\n-- WHY ARE WE DOING THIS? --\n\nThis mailing list is for those interested in the LightWave software, how\nit operates and in ideas on how to obtain the best quality images\navailable to them.  The list is for those who own the Toaster and\nLightWave as well as those just interested in what can be done with the\npackage.  We hope to share information, tips, procedures and to bond as\na group.\n\n-- WHAT ARE THE RULES? --\n\nSince LightWave/Modeler are just a part of the Newtek Video Toaster\nsoftware, I'm sure we will discuss a few items related to the operation\nof the Toaster.  However, we will strive to keep the subject revolving\nspecifically around the 3D software, related tools and products.\n\nYou do NOT have to own a Toaster to join this list!\n\n-- OK! HOW DO I JOIN? --\n\nTo become a member of the LightWave3D mailing list you must send a mail\nmessage to the address:\n\n        lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com\n\nIn the body of the message enter:\n\nsubscribe lightwave-l your.name@your.site.domain\n\nOr just ask to be signed up and I will sign you up to the list.  At this\npoint in time the process is manual but I hope to get an automated\nscript based system in place soon.  There shouldn't be too much of a\ndelay in joining.  Expect a "welcome" message within 5 days after you\nsend your request.  Then, expect the mail to start flowing in!\n\n-- HOW DO I POST TO THE LIST? --\n\nContributing to the list is simple.  Just mail your articles to the\nfollowing address:\n\n        lightwave@bobsbox.rent.com\n\nYour article will be processed by the system and distributed to all\nothers joined to the list.  Your articles will also be sent to you so\nyou know that your article has made it to the list.  However, those\naddresses that are either no good or no longer active will bounce back\nto you.  So, if you post an article and another members address is no\nlonger valid, your original article will be returned to you.  This\ndoesn't mean it hasn't been posted to the list.  In fact, just the\nopposite is true. It means that your article WAS posted and that it\ncouldn't be sent to one or more of the members of the list due to a bad\naddress.\n\nNOTE: I hope to have a fix for this behavior soon.\n\n-- HOW DO I QUIT THE LIST? --\n\nSimply mail a request to be removed from the list to the same address\nyou used to sign up:\n\n        lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com\n\nIn the body of the message enter:\n\nunsubscribe LightWave-l your.name@your.site.domain\n\nI will remove your name from the list of members.  PLEASE, if you join\nthe list and your account is going to be closed or if you will not be\nable to receive mail for a while, send a request to be removed from the\nlist!  If you are just going to lose access for a short while still send\na request for a suspension of your membership and I will suspend\nforwarding of the articles to you.\n\n\n-- WHAT ABOUT OLD ARTICLES? --\n\nI am currently archiving all the articles posted to the list at the\noriginating site (bobsbox).  However, I can not continue to do this due\nto lack of disk space.  What we need is a volunteer that will maintain a\ncompendium of articles sent to the list.  They can compress and store\nthem in archives on their system.  They can then periodically post an\nindex of the contents of the compendium and any other information that\nrelates.\n\nIf there are no volunteers then maybe someone can donate a large SCSI\nhard drive to me for archival purposes. <grin>\n\nI have setup a mail-based file server so that anyone interested in the\nlist can obtain information as well as the entire archive of past\narticles, the membership listing and other information pertaining to\nthe LightWave3D mailing list. For information on this service, please\nsend a mail message to:\n\n        fileserver@bobsbox.rent.com\n\nThe first command to the server must be "HELP" or "USER name <passwd>".\n\nUse HELP to request a current copy of the helpfile.\nUse USER name [passwd] to connect to the service.\nUse ?    to get a short listing of all available commands.\n\n\n\n-- NOW WHAT DO I DO? --\n\nWell, sit back and enjoy the pouring out of information.  If you have\nsomething to offer, please feel free to contribute that information to\nthe list.  Every little bit helps.  Questions are welcomed!  It makes\nsome of us feel important when we can answer them. <grin>\n\nIf you have any questions or comments regarding the list, please contact\nme at the address:\n\n        lightwave-admin@bobsbox.rent.com\n\nCheers,

How does the 16 bit color of HDTV work ? It can not be 5 bit Red Green and\nBlue like on the Macintosh. This gives only 64 gray levels.\n\nApple also has developed a point-point network that is around 200MB (not\nsure if it is bits or bytes) per sec.
I'm still looking for Fractint drivers or a new release which supports the\n 24bit color mode of the Diamond Speedstar 24X.  There are some 2, 4 and 26\n million colros drivers, but none work with the 24X.  \n\nAny help would be appreciated!\n\nThanks!\n\nChad

[Deleted for space; basically complaints that xv is an 8 bit program and that\nmaking several modifications to the RGB sliders is slow because of screen updates.]\n\nIn reverse order:\n\n1) Try clicking in the auto-apply box to switch it off. Then make your mods. Then\nclick on apply. There is no problem as stated; it has already been solved if you\nlook carefully.\n\n2) Yes XV is an 8 bit program. This is not a bug. You can edit individual pallette\nentries or do global colour changes; crop, scale etc. Clearly the program must\nsave out the *altered* image else all your work would be thrown away. So yes it\nsaves out 8 bit images - of course!\n\nXV can import 24 bit images and quantises them down to 8 bits. This is a handy\nfacility, not a bug.\n\nHow would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file? How would you group\n'related' colours to edit them together? Only global changes could be done\nunless the software were very different and much more complicated.\n\nIf you want to do colour editing on a 24 bit image, you need much more powerfull\nsoftware - which is readily available commercially.\n\nAnd lastly, JPEG is a compression algorithm. It can be applied to any image of\narbitrary bit depth. Again, this is not a bug. It is a way of saving disk space\n;-)\n\nLater,\n\n--\nChris Lilley\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTechnical Author, ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training Project\nComputer Graphics Unit, Manchester Computing Centre, Oxford Road, \nManchester, UK.

: 	I was recently talking to a possible employer ( mine! :-) ) and he made a reference to a\n: 48-bit graphics computer/image processing system.  I seem to remember it being called IMAGE or\n: something akin to that.  Anyway, he claimed it had 48-bit color + a 12-bit alpha channel.  That's\n: 60 bits of info--what could that possibly be for?  Specifically the 48-bit color?  That's 280\n: trillion colors, many more than the human eye can resolve.  Is this an anti-aliasing thing?  Or\n: is this just some magic number to make it work better with a certain processor.\n\n\n	I'm pretty sure most industry strength image processing specific \nsystems (i.e. photo processing gear) use as much as 96 bits of color info.\nWhy? Why not, oversampling is never a bad idea especially if the\nhardware's only task is image manipulation, and profressional photographers\ndemand professional results.\n\n: 	Also, to settle a bet with my roommate, what are SGI's flagship products?  I know of\n: Iris, Indigo, and Crimson, but what are the other ones, and which is their top-of-the-line?\n: (sadly, I have access to none of them.  Just a DEC 5000/25.  Sigh.)\n\n	Strange question, but anyway, there's the VGX line, the newer\nIndigo^2, and the Onyx systems are the new big boys on the block (you\ncan get a 24 processor system with twice the graphics performance of\na reality engine). There's more, but I don't have my handy "periodic \ntable of sgi's" on me...
Hello,\n\nWe are looking for a graphics package (preferably complete\nwith source code) that will run on our UNIX operating system\n(a Sequent running DYNIX 3.2).  This graphics package must \nsupport a wide variety of character based graphics devices \n(PC's running a terminal emulator, primarily).  \nAt this point, X11 graphics is not an option.\n\nThis graphics program should, if possible, support these\nsorts of graphics operations (minimum requirements):\n\n   1) Complicated axes (log, linear, etc.) with fairly\n      precise axis labels (multi-line labels, etc.)\n      Major and minor tickmarks on axes, etc.	\n  \n   2) It would be nice if some limited amount of color\n      plotting were available, if the output device\n      supported it.\n\nWe have a copy of gnuplot and are currently using it, but\ngnuplot has some limitations.  We are looking for something\nmore robust than gnuplot.\n\nAt this point, I'm looking for information about packages that\nmight solve our problems.  If you have any information, please\ncontact me at the above email address.  If the product you know\nabout is a commercial software package, please send a phone number\nor email address so that I can contact them about pricing, etc.

Is there a DOS screen capture utility -- PD or shareware -- that will\nwork reliably with VESA 6a 800x600 screens?
No, MIS folks have infinite budgets of death, and they also get parts\nof their budget allocated "upgrades", "maintenance", and "new purchases",\nand a lot of IBM mainframe purchases are actually "leases" and so\nis the software.\n\nBasically, the engineers who have tight budgets, i.e. the coders and\ndesigners of a company, bitch and moan when they drop 15,000 on a \nSparc 1 only to see a faster machine appear a year later.  MIS types\nupgrade once every 5-10 years, and their costs are amortized and\ndepreciated over a longer period, and the budget office justifies\nthe expense because they actually use the machines for accounting,\npayroll, etc.\n\nNow, if the budget office was dependant on the engineers for some\nreason like payroll and accounts, you'd sure as hell see every\nengineer with a new Cray on his desktop every year. :-)
I'm also interested in such a program. But most of all I'd like to know \nwich program is able to convert GIF or PCX to DXF !!! When I have this \nprogram, I can scan pictures and frase (or something like that !) them.\nThis will be beyond the limit !!!

amen.. I too have learned by example, specifically yours. :)\n\n\n.. but dorsai leads the way.. Unlike other services that are commercial\nin nature, dorsai is a community based service.

Perhaphs what Bill Gates and Steve Jobs are now is the result of the\nnatural evolution of a "successful" hacker.  Either you make money, go\nto jail (Lee Feldenstein [sp?]), or just fade away as "Oh, that's uncle\nso-and-so who *really* likes computers...".\n\nWhat a "computer hacker" is and does will change as long as the definition\nof the word "computer" continues to change.
The April 1993 edition of MIX Magazine carries a story on 3DO which\nincludes pictures of the unit, a schematic of what's inside and some\nindication from the people at 3DO as to where they intend to go and in\nwhat stages. (MIX is a trade rag aimed at the professional sound\nengineering community.)\n\nThe schematic shows a central DMA Engine connecting and mediating between\ntwo Graphics Animation processors (32 bit bus), a 32-bit RISC processor\nwith math co-processor, Video Decomp module, a control port, an expansion\nport (where 3DO hangs its double-fast CD player), 1Mb DRAM, an optional\nvideo port (for editing video) and on the outbound side 1MB VRAM to Video\nProcessor to TV chain parallel with a DSP to sound chain. \n\nThey promise Red Book CD-quality audio, full 30 fps video and a future\nconnection path to your PC via a PC expansion card.\n\nI am not informed enough to have an opinion about the various means and\nmethods discussed here. The article, written by Philip De Lancie, does\ncover the other machines mentioned in this thread.  I come from the PC\nTCP/IP world and see a tremendous potential for bringing connectedness to\nthe educated consumer; 3DO seems to have the right business partners to\nmake this happen. \n\nHope this helps.

Hello,\n \nI've been on the DKBtrace/PoVray mailing list out of trearn.bitnet\nfor some time now, but when I tried to post the other day the\nlistserv told me that the list doesn't exist!  So I got a global\nlist of groups from the listserv and - - NOTHING!  I grepped every\nstring I could think of.  If Frank, Ville Saari, Andre Beck, or anyone\nelse who's a regular on DKB-L can tell me what is going on, please do!\n \nRegards,
[stuff deleted]\nI have a similiar question relating to anti-alaising that my friend has asked\nto have posted to the more knowledgable in this group. I'm sorry if this is\nan FAQ.\n\n   "What anti-alaising methods do Persistance Of Vision & Polyray use?"\n\nThank you in advance. You can either email me or reply (or flame me if it is\nan FAQ :-) )

Greetings this is a general call for information regarding Image\nProcessing. I am looking for any material related to the field, and am\nalso trying to get my hands on some easy to use packages related to the\nfield. In particular source code for general use packages.\n\nI already have several texts on the subject, but would appreciate more\ninput from people more knowledgable in the field than myself. I'm not\nmathematically literate (ie. I don't have a degree in mathematics), so\nany material that is suggested I would prefer that it was not\nmathematically intensive.\n\nThe best book I have found on the subject at the moment is:\n\n"Practical Digital Image Processing"\nby Rhys Lewis\nISBN: 0-13-683525-2\nPublished by Ellis Horwood (c)1990.\n\nLikewise I am trying to get a fair sample of programs that demonstrate\nImage Processing techniques. So far I have 'xv', and 'khoros' for Unix.\n'Dcview 2.1' for the IBM PC, and various related smatterings of C code\nto help describe topics like, contrasting, dithering, image enhancement\nvia convolution etc.\n\nIf anyone could kindly supply me with some public domain software\npertinent to this area, or better still if they could tell me where I am\nmost likely to find it on the AARNET (Internet). If I can I would prefer\nsource code in C or Turbo Pascal that includes some Image Processing\ncode/algorithms, that I can readily alter/manipulate for the purposes of\ndemonstration it would be most helpful.\n\nAll the above information will contribute to my post-graduate studies,\nand will be liberally used in my paper, and seminar on the subject.\n\n\n          Thanks in advance Vance Ashlin\n          Diploma Advanced Computing\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nThinking is dangerous, subversive, mindnumbing and leads you astray\n\nashlin@ironbark.ucnv.edu.au\ni880429@redgum.ucnv.edu.au
I get regular questions about gamma correction since I go to great pains to\ndeal with it properly in xli (the image loader program I maintain).\n\nHere is an explanation I often use to answer these questions.\n\nThis might be suitable for inclusion in the FAQ.\n\n	Graeme Gill.\n\n###########################################################################\n"A note on gamma correction and images"\n\nAuthor: Graeme W. Gill\n        graeme@labtam.oz.au\n\nDate: 93/5/16\n\n\n"What is all this gamma stuff anyway ?"\n--------------------------------------\n\nAlthough it would be nice to think that "an image is an image",\nthere are a lot of complications. Not only are there a whole bunch of\ndifferent image formats (gif, jpeg, tiff etc etc), there is a whole\nlot of other technical stuff that makes dealing with images a bit\ncomplicated. Gamma is one of those things. If you've ever downloaded\nimages from BBS or the net, you've probably noticed (with most image\nviewing programs) that some images look ok, some look too dark, and some\nlook too light. "Why is this ?" you may ask. This, is gamma correction\n(or the lack of it).\n\nWhy do we need gamma correction at all ?\n--------------------------------------\n\nGamma correction is needed because of the nature of CRTs (cathode\nray tubes - the monitors usually used for viewing images). If you\nhave some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computer\nimage by measuring the amount of light coming from each point of\nthe scene, then you have created a "linear" or un-gamma-corrected\nimage. This is a good thing in many ways because you can manipulate\nthe image as if the values in the image file were light (ie. adding\nand multiplying will work just like real light in the real world).\nNow if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltage\nand feed it into a CRT, you find that the CRT _doesn't_ give you\nan amount of light proportional to the voltage. The amount of light\ncoming from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltage\nsomething like this:\n\nLight_out = voltage ^ crt_gamma\n\nSo if you just dump your nice linear image out to a CRT, the image\nwill look much too dark. To fix this up you have to "gamma correct"\nthe image first. You need to do the opposite of what the CRT\nwill do to the image, so that things cancel out, and you get\nwhat you want. So you have to do this to your image:\n\ngamma_corrected_image = image ^ (1/crt_gamma)\n\nFor most CRTs, the crt_gamma is somewhere between 1.0 and 3.0.\n\nIf that is all it is, why does it seem so complicated ?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nThe problem is that not all display programs do gamma correction.\nAlso not all sources of images give you linear images (Video cameras\nor video signals in general). Because of this, a lot of images\nalready have some gamma correction done to them, and you are \nrarely sure how much. If you try and display one of those images\nwith a program that does gamma correction for you, the image gets\ncorrected twice and looks way to light. If you display one of those\nimages with a program that doesn't do gamma correction, then it will\nlook vaguely right, but not perfect, because the gamma correction is\nnot exactly right for you particular CRT.\n\nWhose fault is all this ?\n-----------------------\n\nIt is really three things. One is all those display programs\nout there that don't do gamma correction properly. Another is\nthat most image formats don't specify a standard gamma, or\ndon't have some way or recording what their gamma correction is.\nThe third thing is that not many people understand what gamma\ncorrection is all about, and create a lot of images with varying\ngamma's.\n\nAt least two file formats do the right thing.\nThe Utah Graphics Toolkit .rle format has a semi-standard way of recording\nthe gamma of an image. The JFIF file standard (that uses JPEG compression)\nspecifies that the image to be encoded must have a gamma of 1.0 (ie. a\nlinear image - but not everyone obeys the rules).\n\nSome image loaders (for instance xli - an X11 image utility)\nallow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor you\nare using, but the individual gamma values of image you are trying to\nview. Other image viewers (eg. xv another X11 image program) and\nutilities (eg. the pbm toolkit) provide ways of changing the gamma\nof an image, but you have to figure out the overall gamma correction\nyourself, allowing for undoing any gamma correction the image has,\nand then the gamma correction you need to suite your CRT monitor.\n\n[ Note that xv 2.21 doesn't provide an easy way of modifying the\ngamma of an image. You need to adjust the R, G and B curves to the\nappropriate gamma in the ColEdit controls. Altering the Intensity\nin the HSV controls doesn't do the right thing, as it fails to\ntake account of the effect gamma has on H and S. This tends\nto give a tint to the image. ]\n\nHow can I figure out what my viewer does, or what gamma my screen has ?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe simplest way to do that is to try loading the file chkgamma.jpg\n(provided with xli distribution), which is a JFIF jpeg format file\ncontaining two grayscale ramps. The ramps are chosen to look linear\nto the human eye, one using continuous tones, and the other using\ndithering.  If your viewer does the right thing and gamma corrects\nimages, then the two ramps should look symmetrical, and the point\nat which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half\nway from the top to the bottom. (To find this point it helps if\nyou move away a little from the screen, and de-focus your eyes a\nbit.)\n\nIf your viewer doesn't do gamma correction, then left hand ramp will have\na long dark part and a short white part, and the point of equal brightness\nwill be above the center.\n\nIf your viewer does have a way of setting the right amount of gamma correction\nfor a display, then if the equal brightness point is above center increase the\ngamma, and decrease it if it is below the center. The value will usually be\naround 2.2 \n\n[with xli for instance, you can adjust the display gamma with the\n-dispgamma flag, and once you've got it right, you can set the DISPLAY_GAMMA\nenvironment variable in your .profile]\n\nHow do I figure out what the gamma of an image is ?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is the most tricky bit. As a general rule it seems that a lot of\ntrue color (ie. 24 bit, .ppm .jpg) images have a gamma of\n1.0 (linear), although there are many about that have some gamma\ncorrection. It seems that the majority of pseudo color images\n(ie. 8 bit images with color maps - .gif etc.) are gamma corrected\nto some degree or other.\n\nIf your viewer does gamma correction then linear images will\nlook good, and gamma corrected images will look too light.\n\nIf your viewer doesn't do gamma correction, then linear images will\nlook too dark, and gamma corrected images will ok.\n\nWhy Linear images are sometimes not such a good thing\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nOne of the reason that many high quality formats (such as\nVideo) use gamma correction is that it actually makes better\nuse of the storage medium. This is because the human\neye has a logarithmic response to light, and gamma correction\nhas a similar compression characteristic. This means images \ncould make better use of 8 bits per color (for instance),\nif they used gamma correction. The implication though, is that\nevery time you want to do any image processing you should\nconvert the 8 bit image to 12 or so linear bits to retain\nthe same accuracy. Since little popular software does this, and\nnone of the popular image formats can agree on a standard\ngamma correction factor, it is difficult to justify gamma corrected\nimages at the popular level.\n\nIf some image formats can standardize on a particular gamma,\nand if image manipulation software takes care to use\nextra precision when dealing with linearized internal data,\nthen gamma corrected distribution of images would be a good thing.\n\n(I am told that the Kodak PhotoCD format for instance, has a\nstandard gamma correction factor that enables it to get the\nhighest quality out of the bits used to hold the image).
Hello there!\n\nA week ago a guy asked what a .SCO file was - well I researched a bit and foundout that it is just another RIX file. .SCI files are 320x200 files and .SCO files are 1024x768 files! alle the other formats (800x600, 640x480...) are also called something like .SC(character).
I've been playing with a program called PICLAB to modify some .gif files. The\nproblem is it keeps displaying only 50% of the image. Starting from the top, it\ndisplays20%, leaves 20% blank, then down another 20% etc. ANyone know what I'm\ndoing wrong, or is there another piece of software I should use instead?
