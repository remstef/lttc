I think that's an insightful comment.   Especially when at the\nsame time we have people like Bill "Projector" Conner complaining\nthat we are posting parodies.

I think C.S. Lewis has argued that medieval people did not all think the\nworld is flat.\n\nHowever, this argument goes both ways. Pretend someone telling Plato that\nit is highly probable that people do not really have souls; their minds\nand their consciousness are just something their brains make up, and\ntheir brains (their body) is actually ahead of their mind even in \nvoluntarly actions. I don't think Plato would have been happy with this,\nand neither would Paul, although Paul's ideas were quite different.\nHowever, if you would _read_ what we discuss in this group, and not\njust preach, you would see that there currently is much evidence in\nfavour of these statements.\n\nThe same applies to the theory of natural selection, or other sacred\ncows of Christianity on our origins and human nature. I don't believe\nin spirits, devils or immortal souls any more than in gods.\n\n\nAh, you said it. You believe what you want to. This is what I had assumed\nall along. \n\n\nYou might be as well planting Satan's seeds, ever thought of this?\nBesides, you haven't yet explained why we must believe so blindly,\nwithout any guiding light at all (at least I haven't noticed it).\nI don't think this is at all fair play on god's part. \n\nYour argument sounds like a version of Pascal's Wager. Please read the\nFAQ, this fallacy is discussed there.\n\n\nAnd I failed to get help from the HS because I had a wrong attitude?\nSorry, Dan, but I do not think this spirit exists. People who claim to have\naccess to it just look badly deluded, not gifted. \n\nPetri
Well, again, I am doing as much as the poster I was replying too. I am\nquite busy and really don't have the time to respond in full scholarly\nform to every accusation that is flippantly made by someone who's \nbeing clearly antagonistic.\n\n\n\n\nI have considered it. But if someone spreads falsehoods out of\nignorance then they are still spreading falsehoods. Those falsehoods\ngenerally do not come out of nowhere but are produced by people\nwho know that what they are saying is (at _least_) not the whole\ntruth. I still consider such spreading of falsehoods propaganda\non some level.\n\n\n\n\nBob, I never accused you of having your head up your ass! It takes\nme quite some time in dealing with someone before accusing them of\nhaving their head up their ass. I was accusing the original poster\n(Benedikt, I believe) of being so impaired.\n\n\nCheers,

Wow! You got me thinking now!\n\nThis is an interesting question in that recently there has been a \nmove in society to classify previously "socially unacceptable" yet legal \nactivities as OK.  In the past it seems to me there were always two \ncoexisting methods of social control.\n\nFirst (and most explicit) is legal control.  That is the set of \nactions we define as currently illegal and having a specifically defined set \nof punishments.\n\nSecondly (and somewhat more hidden) is social control.  These are \nthe actions which are considered socially unacceptable and while not covered \nby legal control, are scrictly controled by social censure. Ideally (if \nsocialization is working as it should) legal control is hardly ever needed \nsince most people voluntarilly control their actions due to the pressure of \nsocial censure.\n\nThe control manifests itself in day-to-day life as "guilt" and \n"morality".  I've heard it said (and fully believe) that if it weren't for \nthe VAST majority of people policing themselves, legal control would be \nabsolutely impossible.\n\nLately (last 50, 100 years?) however there has been a move to \nattempt to dissengage the individual from societal control (ie. if it ain't \nillegal, then don't pick on me).  I'm not saying this is wrong, merely \nthat it is a byproduct of a society which has:\n\n	1) A high education level,\n	2) A high exposure to alternative ideas via the popular media,\n	3) A high level of institutionalized individual rights, and\n	4) A "me" oriented culture.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is that we appear to be in a state of transition, \nhere in the western world in that we still have many ideas about what we can\\ncan't allow people to do based entirely on personal squeamishness, yet we \nare fully bent on maximizing individual freedoms to the max as long as \nthose freedoms don't impinge on another's.\n\nIMHO society is trying to persue two mutually exclusive ends here.  While we \nappreciate and persue individual rights (these satisfy the old \nterritoriality and dominance instincts), the removal of socialized, \ninherent fears based on ignorance will result in the \ncontinued destabilization of society.  \n\nI got no quick fix.  I have no idea how we can get ourselves out of this \nmess.  I know I would never consent to the roll-back of personal freedoms \nin order to "stabilize" society.  Yet I believe development of societies \nfollow a Darwinian process which selects for stability.  Can we find a \nsocial model which maximizes indiv. freed.'s yet is stable?  Perhaps it is \npossible to live with a "non-stable" society?\n\nAnybody see a way out?  Comments?\n\nPS.  Therefore answer to question #3:  We don't.  Do we want to?\n\n\n\nPhil Trodwell
acooper@mac.cc.macalstr.edu (Turin Turambar, ME Department of Utter Misery)\nsaid re. Dan Schaertel's article [if I followed the quoting right]:\n\n\n\n\nI think it may also be worthwhile pointing out that if we\ntake the appellation `Rabbi' seriously then Jesus had a full\ngrasp of contemporary `scripture'\n\nMat21:42 Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures...\n\nMat22:29 Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing\nMat22:29 the scriptures, nor the power of God.\n\nFollowing from this, he would have been in a wonderful\nposition to fulfil prophesies, and the NT says as much:\n\nMat26:54 But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled,\nMat26:54 that thus it must be?\n\nMat26:56 But all this was done, that the scriptures of the\nMat26:56 prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples\nMat26:56 forsook him, and fled.\n\nIf the books comprising the referred-to `scripture' had not\nbeen accessible then it probably would be a different\nmatter.

I recall a discussion I had heard years ago. It went something like this: \nThe problem with omnipotence (at least as I perceive it) as personified by \nthe christian God ideal is that it is potentially contradictory.  If a \nmanifestation such as God is truly infinite in power can God place limits \nupon itself?\n.\n.\nSome stuff I can't recall.\nThen some other questions I think I recall correctly:\nCan God unmake itself?\nCan God make itself (assuming it doesn't yet exist)?\nHas God has always existed or is it necessary for an observer to bind all of\nGods potential quantum states into reality?\nWas God nothing more than a primordial force of nature that existed during\nthe earliest stages of universal (inflationary?) creation?\nIs God a vacuum fluctuation?\nGiven a great enough energy density could we re-create God?\nWould that make US God and God something else?\n.\n.\nSome more stuff I don't recall concerning creating God.  Followed by:\nIs God self-aware?\nIs it necessary that God be self-aware?\nIs God a living entity?\nIs it necessay that God be a living entity?\nIs God unchanging or does it evolve?\n.\n.\nAny comments? Post them so that others might benefit from the open inquiry\nand resulting discussion.
I replied to this query via e-mail, but I think there are some\nissues that are worth discussing in public.\n\n\nI would recommend you to take a look at\n\n1) your dictionary\n2) alt.atheism FAQ files\n\nto notice that atheism is _not_ a belief system, and what is common\nto all atheists is not a belief, but a _lack of belief in deities_.\nI cannot imagine how anyone could do research on atheism without\npaying careful attention to this issue. \n\n\nIMHO, this is a poor method to do any real survey, although I'm sure the\nreplies might keep you amused for hours.\n\n\nNo, I do _not_ know what you mean. If you are surveying our individual\nphilosophies, fine, but that's not strictly atheism. Atheism is not\njust another, godless version of the theistic explanations for life,\nthe universe and everything. It is not a belief system, and it could\nhardly be called a philosophical system.\n\nOnce more: Atheism is characterised by lack of belief in deities. \nDo not twist the meaning, or assume that we have some kind of\nphilosophy we all agree on.\n\nSome comments on your questions:\n\n\nI would also like to hear more about this. Have we been able to 'convert'\nanyone?\n\n\nThis question contains a contradiction in terms. _Beliefs_ \ncannot be acquired rationally - if they could, they would not be \nbeliefs! You also seem to have rather strange ideas of how people become\natheists - those who are alienated from religion do not necessarily\nbecome atheists, they just think very little about religion. It seems\nit requires a considerable time of honest inquiry to find out that\nreligions are actually intellectually dishonest virtual realities.\n\nThose who have never had beliefs will certainly find this question\nquite odd - how can lack of belief be acquired? When did I acquire\nlack of belief in the Easter Bunny? (I did believe in Santa, though ;-))\n\n\nThis question does not make any sense, since atheism does not deal with\nthese issues - it is not a worldview, or a philosophy, or a belief system.\n\nSigh, why haven't I seen a good, well-thought survey in the Usenet\nfor three years... and what is the point of doing surveys in the net,\nanyway? Just to abstract some opinions?\n\nPetri

: : So in conclusion it can be shown that there is essentially no\n: : logical argument which clearly differentiates a "cult" from a\n: : "religion".  I challenge anyone to produce a distinction which\n: : is clear and can't be easily knocked down.  \n\n: How about this one: a religion is a cult which has stood the test\n: of time.\n\nJust like history is written by the `winners' and not the `losers.'\nFrom what I've seen of religions, a religion is just a cult that\nwas so vile and corrupt it was able to exert it's doctrine using\npolitical and military measures.  Perhaps if Koresh withstood the\nonslaught for another couple of months he would have started \nattracting more converts due to his `strength,' hence becoming a\nfull religion and not just a cult.
Heck, I remember reading a quote of Luther as something like: "Jews should\nbe shot like deer."  And of course much Catholic doctrine for centuries was \nextremely anti-Semitic.

As for the four gospels being in harmony\non the issue of Jesus...  You know not of what you speak.  Here are a few\ncontradictions starting with the trial and continuing through the assension.\n\n\nActs 1:18: "Now this man (Judas) purchased a field with the reward of \niniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his \nbowels gushed out."\n\nMatt. 27:5-7: "And he (Judas) cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, \nand departed, and went and hanged himself.

And Peter called to mind  the \nword  that  Jesus  said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny\nme thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.\n\nMAT 26:74  Then began he to curse and to swear,  saying,  I  know not the man.\nAnd immediately the cock crew.\nMAT 26:75  And Peter remembered the word  of  Jesus,  which  said unto him,\nBefore the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept\nbitterly.\n\nLUK 22:60  And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest.  And immediately,\nwhile he yet spake, the cock crew.\nLUK 22:61  And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And  Peter remembered\nthe word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou\nshalt deny me thrice.\n\nJOH 13:38  Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? \nVerily,\n verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, still thou hast denied me\nthrice.\n\nJOH 18:27  Peter then denied  again:  and  immediately  the  cock crew.\n\n\n(This is interesting because Matthew quotes a prophesy that was never made! \nNot the only time he does this either...)\n\nMAT 27:9  Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy  the prophet, \nsaying,  And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was\nvalued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;\n\nzechariah 11:11-13\n(nothing in Jeremiah remotely like)\n\nWhat was the color of the robe placed on Jesus during his trial?\n\nscarlet - Matthew 27:28\n\npurple John 19:2\n\n\nMark says the third hour, or 9 a.m., but John says the sixth hour (noon) was\nwhen the sentence was passed.\n\n\nMatthew  --  This is Jesus the king of the Jews\nMark	 --  The King of the Jews\nLuke	 --  This is the king of the Jews\nJohn	 --  Jesus of Nazareth the king of the Jews\n\n\nvinegar - Matthew 27:34\n\nwine with myrrh - Mark 15:23\n\n\nMatthew said many stood far off, including Mary Magdaline, Mary the mother of\nJames, and the mother of Zebedee's children.  Mark and Luke speak of many far\noff, and Mark includes Mary Magdeline and Mary the mother of James the less.\nJohn says that Jesus's mother stood at the cross, along with her sister and\nMary Magdalene.\n\n\nMatt.27:46,50: "And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, \nsaying, "Eli, eli, lama sabachthani?" that is to say, "My God, my God, why\nhast thou forsaken me?"  ...Jesus, when he cried again with a loud voice,\nyielded u the ghost."\n\nLuke23:46: "And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, "Father, unto\n thy hands I commend my spirit:" and having said thus, he gave up the ghost."\n\nJohn19:30: "When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, "It is \nfinished:" and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost."\n\n\nMatthew says that the veil of the temple was rent, that there was an\nearthquake, and that it was dark from the sixth to the ninth hour, that graves\nopened and bodies of the saints arose and went into Jeruselem, appearing to\nmany (beating Jesus to the resurection). Mark and Luke speak of darkness and\nthe veil of the temple being rent but mention no earthquake or risen saints. \nJohn is the only one who mentions Jesus's side being peirced.\n\n\nMatthew says the Jews asked Pilate for a guard to prevent the body from being\nstolen by the disciples, and for the tomb to be sealed. All of this was\nsupposedly done, but the other gospels do not mention these precautions.\n\nDepends where you look; Matthew 12:40 gives Jesus prophesying that he will\nspend "three days and three nights in the heart of the earth", and Mark 10:34\nhas "after three days (meta treis emeras) he will rise again". As far as I can\nsee from a quick look, the prophecies have "after three days", but the\npost-resurrection narratives have "on the third day".\n\n\nMatthew says Sunday at dawn, Mark says the sun was rising, and John says it\nwas dark.\n\n\nMAT 28:1  In the end of the sabbath, as it began to  dawn  toward the first\nday of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.\n\nMAR 16:1  And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the  mother \nof  James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and\nanoint him.\n\nJOH 20:1  The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene  early, when  it \nwas  yet  dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the\nsepulchre.\n\n\nMAT 28:2  And, behold, there was  a  great  earthquake:  for  the angel of the\nLord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door,\nand sat upon it.\nMAT 28:3  His countenance was like  lightning,  and  his  raiment white as\nsnow: MAT 28:4  And for fear of him the keepers did shake,  and  became as\ndead men. MAT 28:5  And the angel answered and said unto  the  women,  Fear\nnot ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.\n\nMAR 16:5  And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a  young  man sitting  on \nthe right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.\n\nLUK 24:4  And it came  to  pass,  as  they  were  much  perplexed thereabout,\nbehold, two men stood by them in shining garments:\n\nJOH 20:12  And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at  the head,  and \nthe  other  at  the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.\n\n\nMatthew says the guard was paid to tell this story, but no other gospel makes\nthis claim.\n\n\nMatthew says an angel at the tomb told the two Marys and that Jesus also told\nthem, to tell the disciples to meet him in Galilee.  The disciples then went\nto a mountain previously agreed opon, and met Jesus there.  This was his only\nappearance, except to the women at the tomb.  Matthew only devotes five verses\nto the visit with the disciples.\n\nMark says that Jesus walked with two of the disciples in the country, and that\nthey told the rest of the disciples, who refused to believe.  Later he\nappeared to the 11 disciples at mealtime.\n\nLuke says two followers went, the same day that Jesus rose from the dead, to\nEmmaus, a village eight miles from Jeruselem, and there Jesus jioned them but\nwas unrecognised.  While they ate a meal together that evening, they finally\nrecognised Jesus, whereopon he dissapeared.  Returning at once to Jeruselem,\nthey told the\ndisciples of their experience, and suddenly Jesus appeared among them,\nfrightening them, as they thought he was a spirit.  Jesus then ate some fish\nand honey and then preached to them.\n\nJohn says Jesus appeared to the disciples the evening of the day he arrose, in\nJeruselem, where they were hiding.  He breathed the Holy Ghost opon them, but\nThomas was not present and refused to believe. Eight days later Jesus joined\nthe disciples again at the same place and this time he convinced Thomas.	Once\nmore Jesus made an\nappearance to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias but again was not\nrecognised.\n After telling them to cast their netson the other side of the boat, Jesus\nbecomes known to them and prepares bread and fish for them.  They all eat\ntogether and converse.\n\nThe book of acts further adds to the confusion.  It says that Jesus showed\nhimself to the apostles for a period of 40 days after his resurection (thus\ncontradicting Matthew, Mark, Luke AND John) and spoke to them of things\npertaining to the kingdom of God: "And when he had spoken these things, while\nthey beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud recieved him out of their sight. \nAnd while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, two men stood\nby them in white apparel: Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye\ngazing into heaven? This same Jesus, which is taken from you into heaven,\nshall so comein like manneras ye have seen him go into heaven" Acts 1:3-11\n\nPaul outdoes every other "authority" by saying that Jesus was seen by 500\npersons between the time of the resurection and the\nassension, although he does not say where.	He also claims that he himself "as\none born out of due time" also saw Jesus. 1 Cor 15:6-8.\n\n\nMatthew says nothing about it.	Mark casually says that Jesus was recieved into\nheaven after he was finished talking with the\ndisciples in Jeruselem.  Luke says Jesus led the desciples to Bethany and that\nwhile he blessed them, he was parted from them and carried up into heaven. \nJohn says nothing about it.  Acts\ncontradicts all of the above.  (See previous section)\n\n\nMAT 24:34  Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all\nthese things be fulfilled.\n\nMAR 13:30  Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall  not pass, till\nall these things be done.\n\nLUK 21:32  Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not  pass away, till\nall be fulfilled.\n\n1 thessalonians 4:15-18\n\n1 Corinthians 15:5 (12)\nMatthew 27:3-5 (minus one from 12)\nActs 1:9-26 (Mathias not elected until after resurrection)\nMAT 28:16  Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain\nwhere Jesus had appointed them.\n\n	"And Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven." (2 Kings 2:11)\n\n	"No man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven, 	...\nthe Son of Man." (John 3:13)\n\nAs you can see, there are a number of contradictions in the account of the\ntrial, crucifiction and resurection of Jesus.  If these are good witnesses,\nyou would think that they could get SOME of these important details right! \n(In fact, I cannot find very many points on where they AGREE.  You would think\nthat they could at least agree on some of the points they were supposedly\nobserving!) Because of the fact that there is so much contradiction and error,\nthe story of the resurection as presented cannot be taken as literal truth.\n(Due to the nature of the story, I doubt if it should be taken as ANY sort of\ntruth.)
Sorry about the delay in responding, due to conference paper deadline panic.\n\n\n[Alarming amounts of agreement deleted :-)]\n\n\nThat ("complicated") isn't in fact where P(H) > P(HG) comes from; it's more\nthe other way around. It's from\n\n  P(H)  =  P(HG) +  P(HG')  where G' is the complement of G\n\nand by axiom, P(anything) >= 0, so P(HG') >= 0, so P(H) >= P(HG).\n\nIn a sense, HG is necessarily more "complicated" than H for any H and G,\nso I may be splitting hairs, but what I'm trying to say is that irrespective\nof subjective impressions of how complicated something is, P(H) >= P(HG)\nholds, with equality if and only if P(HG') = 0.\n\n\nWell, "P(x | A) = P(x | B)" means that x is as likely to be observed if A is\noperative as it is if B is operative. This implies that observing x does not\nprovide any useful information which might allow us to discriminate between\nthe respective possibilities that A and B are operative; the difference\nreduces to the difference between the (unknown and unhelpful) prior\nprobabilities P(A) and P(B):\n\n  P(x | A) = P(x | B)  ==>\n\n    P(A | x)  =  k P(A),   and   P(B | x)  =  k P(B)\n\nwhere k  =  P(x | A) / P(x)  =  P(x | B) / P(x).\n\nSo A and B are "equally consistent with the data" in that observing x\ndoesn't give any pointers as to which of A or B is operative.\n\nIn the particular case where A = H and B = HG, however, we know that their\nprior probabilities are ordered by P(H) >= P(HG), although we don't know\nthe actual values, and it's this which allows us to deploy the Razor to\nthrow out any such HG.\n\n\nThat's certainly true, but the particular point here was whether or\nnot a `divine component' actually underlies the prevalence of religion\nin addition to the memetic transmission component, which even the religious\nimplicitly acknowledge to be operative when they talk of `spreading the word'.\n\nNow it seems to me, as I've said, that the observed variance in religious\nbelief is well accounted for by the memetic transmission model, but rather\n*less* well if one proposes a `divine component' in addition, since I would\nexpect the latter to conspire *against* wide variance and even mutual\nexclusion among beliefs. Thus my *personal* feeling is that P(x | HG) isn't\neven equal to P(x | H) in this case, but is smaller (H is memetic transmission,\nG is `divine component', x is the variance among beliefs). But I happily\nacknowledge that this is a subjective impression.\n\n\nNot that I'm a statistician as such either, but:\n\nThe idea is that both theism and atheism are compatible with all of\nthe (read `my') observations to date. However, theism (of the type with\nwhich I am concerned) *also* suggests that, for instance, prayer may be\nanswered, people may be miraculously healed (both are in principle amenable\nto statistical verification) and that god/s may generally intervene in\nmeasurable ways.\n\nThis means that these regions of the space of possible observations, \nwhich I loosely termed "appearances of god/s", have some nonzero\nprobability under the theistic hypothesis and zero under the atheistic.\n\nSince there is only so much probability available for each hypothesis to\nscatter around over the observation space, the probability which theism\nexpends on making "appearances of god/s" possible must come from somewhere\nelse (i.e. other possible observations).\n\nAll else being equal, this means that an observation which *isn't* an\n"appearance of god/s" must have a slightly higher probability under\natheism than under theism. The Bayesian stuff implies that such\nobservations must cause my running estimate for the probability of\nthe atheistic hypothesis to increase, with a corresponding decrease\nin my running estimate for the probability of the theistic hypothesis.\n\nSorry if that's still a bit jargonesque, but it's rather difficult to\nput it any other way, since it does depend intimately on the properties\nof conditional probability densities, and particularly that the total\narea under them is always unity.\n\nAn analogy may (or may not :-) be helpful. Say that hypothesis A is "the\ncoin is fair", and that B is "the coin is unfair (two-headed)". (I've\nused A and B to avoid confusion with H[heads] and T[tails].)\n\nThen\n\n  P(H | A) = 0.5  }  total 1\n  P(T | A) = 0.5  }\n\n  P(H | B) = 1    }  total 1\n  P(T | B) = 0    }\n\nThe observations are a string of heads, with no tails. This is compatible\nwith both a fair coin (A) and a two-headed coin (B). However, the probability\nexpended by A on making possible the appearance of tails (even though they\ndon't actually appear) must come from somewhere else, since the total must\nbe unity, and it comes in this case from the probability of the appearance\nof heads.\n\nSay our running estimates at time n-1 are e[n-1](A) and e[n-1](B). The\nobservation x[n] at time n is another head, x[n] = H. The estimates are\nmodified according to\n\n                            P(H | A)\n  e[n](A)   =   e[n-1](A) * --------   =   e[n-1](A) * m\n                              P(H)\n\nand\n\n                            P(H | B)\n  e[n](B)   =   e[n-1](B) * --------   =   e[n-1](B) * 2m\n                              P(H)\n\nNow we don't know P(H), the *actual* prior probability of a head, but\nthe multiplier for e(A) is half that for e(B). This is true every time\nthe coin is tossed and a head is observed.\n\nThus whatever the initial values of the estimates, after n heads, we have\n\n                 n\n  e[n](A)   =   m  e[0](A)\n\nand\n                    n\n  e[n](B)   =   (2m)  e[0](B),\n\nand since e[k](A) + e[k](B) = 1 at any time k, you can show that 0.5 < m < 1\nand thus 1 < 2m < 2. Hence the estimate for the fair-coin hypothesis A must\ndecrease at each trial and that for the two-headed coin hypothesis B must\nincrease, even though both hypotheses are compatible with a string of heads.\n\nThe loose analogy is between "unfair coin" and atheism, and between "fair\ncoin" and theism, with observations consistent with both. A tail, which\nwould falsify "unfair coin", is analogous to an "appearance of god/s",\nwhich would falsify atheism. I am *not* claiming that the analogy extends\nto the numerical values of the various probabilities, just that the principle\nis the same.\n\n\n\nQuite so, but this type of theism is what I might call "the G in the HG",\nin terms of our Ockham's Razor discussion, and I'd bin it on those grounds.\n\n\nThe hypotheses don't have to be falsifiable, and indeed in my `model',\nthe theism isn't falsifiable.\n\n\n\nYou don't have to. We don't need, in the above analogy, to know *any*\nprior probabilities to deduce that the updating multiplier for the\nfair-coin hypothesis is less than unity, and that the corresponding\nmultiplier for the two-headed coin hypothesis is greater than unity.\nYou don't need to know the initial values of the running estimates\neither. It's clear that after a large number of observations, P(fair-coin)\napproaches zero and P(two-headed-coin) approaches unity.\n\nAll you need to know is whether P(x | Ha) is larger than P(x | Ht) for\nobserved x, and this follows from the assumptions that there are certain\nevents rendered *possible* (not necessary) under Ht which are not possible\nunder Ha, and all else is equal.\n\n\nAny observations you like; it really doesn't matter, nor affect the\nreasoning, provided that there are some possible observations which\nwould count as "appearances of god/s". Examples of this might be\na demonstration of the efficacy of prayer, or of the veracity of\nrevelation.\n\n\n\nOK, we'll downgrade "*does* interact" to "*may* interact", which would\nactually be better since "does interact" implies a falsifiability which\nwe both agree is misplaced.\n\n\nI'll explain, but bear in mind that this isn't central; all I require of\na theism is that it *not* make the prediction "Appearances of god/s will\nnever happen", as does atheism. (Before somebody points out that quantum\nmechanics doesn't make this prediction either, the difference is that\nQM and atheism do not form a partition.)\n\nPredictions include such statements as "Prayer is efficacious" (implying\n"If you do the stats, you will find that Prayer is efficacious"), or "Prayer\nis *not* efficacious", or "Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not\npass, till all these things be fulfilled." I don't think we have any problems\nof misunderstanding here.\n\n\n\nThat's fine; I don't claim that theism is false, merely that the [finite\nnumber of] observations available to me so far suggest that it is, and\nthat as I continue to observe, the suggestion looks better and better.\n\n\n\n\nI think you are; an "appearance of god/s" is sufficient to falsify\natheism, whereas in general the corresponding theism is unfalsifiable.\n\n\nNo: by way of a counterexample, let X = "the coin is fair", or more\naccurately (so that not(X) makes sense) "the two sides of the coin are\ndifferent". This is unfalsifiable by tossing the coin; even a string of\nheads is consistent with a fair coin, and you have to go to an infinite\nnumber of tosses to falsify X in the limit. Its converse is falsifiable,\nand is falsified when at least one head and at least one tail have appeared.\n\n\n\n\nOops. Sorry. Mea culpa.\n\n\nWe agree here.\n\n\n"The Rapture will not happen on October 28 1992." Said Rapture would have\nfalsified atheism to my satisfaction had it happened, although its failure\nto happen does not, of course, falsify any theisms other than those which\nspecifically predicted it.\n\n"No phenomenon which requires the existence of one or more gods for its\nexplanation will ever be observed." That about sums the whole thing up.\n\n\nCheers\n\nSimon
I once heard an arguement from a xtian friend similar to this.\n"Christianity is a Higher Logic.  Athiest like u will not be able\nto understand it.  Your atheist logic is very low.  Only thru faith can \nwe understand the Higher Logic in God".\n\nSo I asked him, "So what is this Higher Logic?"\n\nHis answer, "I don't know."\n\nThis, & the posting above highlights one of the worst things about\nxtainity.  It is abundantly clear to both atheists & xtains that\ntheir believe is both illogical & irrational.  Their tactics, therefore:\nto disregard logic & rationality altogether.  Silly excuses such as\nthe ones above and those such as, "How can u trust science, science\nwas invented by man!", only goes to further show the weakness of\ntheir religion.\n\nIn my country where xtainity was and still is rapidly growing, xtains\nnever try to convert people by appealing to their brains or senses.\nThey know it would be a fruitless act, given the irrational nature\nof their faith.\nThey would wait until a person is in distress, then they would comfort\nhim/her and addict them to their emotional opium.\n\nNever in my life had I met a person who converted to xtainity coz it's\n"reasonable".  Rationality has no place in xtainity (see xtian arguement\nagainst "reason" above).\n\n--\n\nThe UnEnlightened One\n------------------+--------------------------------------------------------\n                  | \nTan Chade Meng    | The wise man tells his wife that he understands her.\nSingapore         | \ncmtan@iss.nus.sg  | The fool tries to prove it. \n                  | \n------------------+--------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n--
This is a very good point. I have already made the clear claim that\nKhomeini advocates views which are in contradition with the Qur'an\nand have given my arguments for this. This is something that can be\nchecked by anyone sufficiently interested. Khomeini, being dead,\nreally can't respond, but another poster who supports Khomeini has\nresponded with what is clearly obfuscationist sophistry. This should\nbe quite clear to atheists as they are less susceptible to religionist\nmodes of obfuscationism. \n\nSo, to answer your question, the only way you can judge is by learning \nmore about Islam, that is by reading the Qur'an and understanding it's \nbasic principles. Once one has done this it is relatively easy to see \nwho is following the principles of Islam and who is acting in a way at \nodds with Islam. Khomeini by attributing a superhuman status to twelve \nmuslim historical leaders is at variance with one of basic principles \nof Islam, which is that no human being is metaphysically different than \nany other human being and in no sense any closer to God in metaphysical \nnature.
I think that _The_Transcedental_Temptation_, by Paul Kurtz, has a good\nsection on the origins of Mormonism you might want to look at.
Yeah, but these were not the wives.  The wives came from Nod, apparently\na land being developed by another set of gods.
Surely it was intended as wit.\n\nBy the way, which "atheist cause" were you referring to, Bill?
I and many others on a.a have described how we have tried to find god.\nAre you saying our efforts have not been sincere?

But if He/She did you would probably consider it rape.  \n\n\nObviously there are many Christians who have tried and do believe. So .. ?\n\n\nNo one asks you to swallow everything, in fact Jesus warns against it.   But let\nme ask you a question.  Do you beleive what you learn in history class, or for\nthat matter anything in school.  I mean it's just what other people have told\nyou and you don't want to swallow what others say. right ... ?\n\nThe life , death, and resurection of Christ is documented historical fact.  As much\nas anything else you learn.  How do you choose what to believe and what not to?\nI could argue that George Washington is a myth.  He never lived because I don't\nhave any proof except what I am told.   However all the major events of the life\nof Jesus Christ were fortold hundreds of years before him.  Neat trick uh?

(about my reply)\n\n\nIt a society that is constantly on the verge of flaming, Usenet, diplomacy\nis the best way to ensure the voice of reason gets through, isn't it?\n\n\nKevin, unfortunately you are now delving into field I know too little\nabout, algorithms. Your reasoning, as I see it, is very much along the\nlines of Roger Penrose, who claimed that mathematical 'insight' cannot\nbe algorithmic in his book _The emperor's new mind: Concerning\ncomputers, minds, and the laws of physics_. However, Penrose's\nclaim that he _has_ mathematical insight, or your similar claim\nthat wavefunctions collapse only when we consciously take a look,\ncould be just illusions.\n\nWe are obviouslu taking very different viewpoints - I try to ponder\non the problem of consciousness from an evolutionary perspective,\nrealising that it might not be anything special, but certainly\nuseful. Thinking back of what I wrote, do you think worms have minds\nor not? They are able to experience pain, at least they behave \njust like that. Yet it is conceivable that we might some day\nin the future perform a "total synthesis of C. elegans" from\nthe elements. Would such a worm have a mind?\n\n\nThis is true to some extent. However, I do not think that our brains\nwork like computers, at all. In fact, there is substantial evidence\n(Skarda, 1985; Skarda & Freeman 1987) that brains work more or less\nchaotically, generating enough randomness for mental states to evolve.\nOur brains work much like genetic algorithm generators, I suppose.\n\n\nIndeed, this is extremely unlikely, given the vast impact of nurture\non our mind and brain. I suggest, however, that before trying to\nunderstand our consciousness as a collection of algorithms. \n\nKevin, take a look at the references I mentioned, and think again.\nI still think the best experts on the nature of a conscious mind\nare neurologists, neuropsychologists and biologists (but do not \nflame me for my opinions), since they study beings that are\nconscious. \n\nThe reason I am repeating my advice is that this discussion cannot\nlead to anywhere if our backgrounds are too different.\n\nAnd please, do not bring QM into this discussion at all - not\nall physicists are happy with the claim that our consciousness\nplays some special role in physics. I would say it doesn't.\n\n\nAgain, _brains are not computers_. Don't forget this. This does not\nmean they need something else to work - they just work differently.\nTheir primary 'purpose' is perception and guidance of action, \nself-awareness and high intelligence are later appearances.\n\n\nYou are still expecting that we could find the idea of 'green' in\nour brains somewhere, perhaps in the form of some chemical. This is\nnot how I see it. The sensation 'green' is a certain time-dependent\npattern in the area V4 of our visual cortex, and it is distributed\nwith the help of areas V1 and V2 to the rest of the brain. \n\nIndeed, a firing pattern. I have sometimes thought of our consciousness\nas a global free induction pattern of these local firing patterns,\nbut this is just idle speculation.\n\nScientific American's September 1992 issue was a special issue on\nmind and brain. Have you already read it from cover to cover? ;-)\nThere are two articles on visual perception, so you might be \ninterested.\n\nBut again, please note that subjective experiences cannot be \nobserved from a third-person perspective. If we see nothing but \nneuronal activity, we cannot go on to conclude that this is not the\nmind.\n\nKalat (1988) writes about numerous examples where electric stimulation\nof different areas of brain have led to various changes in the \npatients' state of mind. For instance, a patient whose septal area\nwas stimulated (without his knowledge) by remote control during\na psychiatric interview was quickly cured of his depression, and\nstarted discussing a plan to seduce his girlfriend.\n\nStimulations in the temporal lobe have sometimes led to embarrassing\nsituations, when the patients have started flirting with the\ntherapist.\n\nIn conclusion, there is evidence that\n\n1) brains are essentially necessary for subjective experiences, \n   brain damage is usually equivalent to some sort of mind damage\n\n2) conscious processes involve substantial brain activity in\n   various areas of brain - when we think of colours, our\n   visual cortex is activated etc.\n\n3) consciousness is an afterthought - we become conscious of our\n   actions with a half a second delay, and our brains are ahead\n   of our 'conscious will' by at least 350 ms. \n\nThus, I think it is fruitful to turn the question "Why do 'I' see\ncolours" around and ask "What is this 'I' that seems to be \nobserving?", since it seems that our conscious mind is not\nthe king of our brains.\n\n\nThis depends on what is meant by 'seeing colours'. Does a neural\nnetwork that is capable of recognising handwritten numbers from\n0 to 9 see the numbers, if it is capable of sorting them?\n\nIf you are asking, "why does an animal who is conscious of itself\nas an observer have an evolutionary advantage over an animal who\ndoesn't", I have a good answer - read my previous posting,\nwhere I wrote why a sense of identity helps social animals to swap\nroles and act more morally, so that they don't unconsciously\nkill each other with newly discovered weapons. (A bit extreme,\nbut this is the basic idea.)\n\nWhen early _Homo_ became more and more efficient in using tools, \na sense of identity and the concept of 'self' had to evolve in\nline with this development. Indeed, respect for others and \nconscious altruistic behaviour might be evolutionary advantages\nfor social animals, such as early humans. \n\n\nIf minds are required for this, does this mean that until human\nminds came to the scene, wavefunctions never collapsed, but remained\nin the superpositions for aeons? My, how powerful we are.\n\nThis has been discussed before, and I think this topic is irrelevant,\nsince we do not agree that minds are necessary, and neither do\nphysicists. \n\n\nI agree, but not in the sense you apparently mean above - physics\nneeds sharp minds to solve many real problems. ;-)\n\n\nIt's OK, if you don't forget to take with you the references I\nwrote about in my previous posting, plus the following:\n\nKalat, James W.

The following is\nan example...\n\nGEN 1:25  And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle \nafter  their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his\nkind: and God saw that it was good.\nGEN 1:26  And God said, Let us make man in our image,  after  our likeness: \nand  let  them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of\nthe air, and over the cattle, and  over  all the  earth,  and over every\ncreeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.\n\nGEN 2:18  And the LORD God said, It is  not  good  that  the  man should be\nalone; I will make him an help meet for him.\nGEN 2:19  And out of the ground the LORD God formed  every  beast of  the \nfield,  and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he\nwould call them: and whatsoever  Adam  called every living creature, that was\nthe name thereof.\n\nEven your Bible cannot agree on how things were created.  Why should we\nbelieve in it?

I don't necessarily disagree with your assertion, but I disagree with\nyour reasoning.  (Faith = Bad.  Dogma = Bad.  Religion -> (Faith ^ Dogma).\nReligion -> (Bad ^ Bad).  Religion -> Bad.)  Unfortunately, you never \nstate why faith and dogma are dangerous.  \n\nIf you believe faith and dogma are dangerous because of what happened in\nWaco, you are missing the point.  \n\nThe Branch Davidians made the mistake of confusing the message with the\nmessenger.  They believed Koresh was a prophet, and therefore believed\neverything he said.  The problem wasn't the religion, it was the \nfollowers.  They didn't die because of faith and dogma, they died because\nof their zealotry (or, in the case of the children, the zealotry of their\nparents).\n\n\nSo Christians are totally irrational?  Irrational with respect to their\nreligion only?  What are you saying?  One's belief in a Christian God does\nnot make one totally irrational.  I think I know what you were getting at,\nbut I'd rather hear you expand on the subject.\n\n\n\nAgain, this statement is too general.  A Christian is perfectly capable of\nbeing a philosopher, and absolutely capable of changing his/her mind.  Faith in\nGod is a belief, and all beliefs may change.  Would you assert that atheists\nwould make poor philosophers because they are predisposed to not believe in a\nGod which, of course, may show unfair bias when studying, say, religion?\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, Christianity is a prison, eh?  Ever heard of parole?  You have read far\ntoo much into this subject.  A Christian is one who follows the religion\nbased on the teachings of a man named Jesus Christ.  Nowhere does this\ndefinition imply that one cannot change one's mind.  In prison, however,\nyou can't just decide to leave.  One is voluntary, the other is not.  The\ntwo are not compatible.\n\n\n\nI prefer to think of religion as a water pistol filled with urine. 8^)\nSeriously, though, some (but certainly not all) religions do condemn\ngroups of people.  The common target is the "infidel," a curious being\nwho is alternately an atheist, a non-<insert specific religious\naffiliation here>, a person of a different race, or an Egyptian. 8^)\n\nPlease explain how "just because" thinking kills people.  (And please\nstate more in your answer than "Waco.")\n\n\n\nI'll see your conscientious peacenik and raise you a religious \nzealot with bad acne. 8^)  By the way, I wasn't aware mass suicide\nwas a problem.  Waco and Jonestown were isolated incidents.  \nMass suicides are far from common.

It seems that the Mormon church\nis (or was) big on giving grants to archeologists to prove that the\nnative Americans are really the lost tribe of Israel and other such\nbunk.  The archeologists would shake their head knowingly while listening\nto them, take the grant, and go off to do real archeology anyway.
Since this is alt.atheism, I hope you don't mind if we strongly disagree...\n\n: The fact is God could cause you to believe anything He wants you to. \n: But think about it for a minute.  Would you rather have someone love\n: you because you made them love you, or because they wanted to\n: love you.     The responsibility is on you to love God and take a step toward\n: Him.  He promises to be there for you, but you have to look for yourself.\n\nIndeed, "knock and it shall be opened to you". Dan, why didn't this work?\nI firmly believed in god for 15 years, but I eventually realised I was\nonly deluding myself, fearful to face the truth. Ultimately, the only reason\nwhat kept me believing was the fear of hell. The mental states I \nhad sillily attributed to divine forces or devil's attempts to \ndestroy my faith were nothing more than my imagination, and it is easy\nto achieve the same mental states at will. \n\nMy faith was just learned fear in a disguise.\n\n: Those who doubt this or dispute it have not givin it a sincere effort.\n\nGod is demanding too much. Dan, what was it I believed in for 15 years?\nIf sincere effort is equivalent to active suspension of disbelief -\nwhat it was in my case - I'd rather quit. If god does not help me to\nkeep the faith, I can't go on. \n\nBesides, I am concerned with god's morality and mental health. Does\nshe really want us to _believe_ in herself without any help (revelations,\nguidance, or anything I can feel)? If she has created us, why didn't\nshe make the task any easier? Why are we supposed to love someone who\nrefuses to communicate with us? What is the point of eternal torture\nfor those who can't believe?\n\nI love god just as much as she loves me. If she wants to seduce me,\nshe'll know what to do. \n\n: Simple logic arguments are folly.  If you read the Bible you will see\n: that Jesus made fools of those who tried to trick him with "logic".\n: Our ability to reason is just a spec of creation.  Yet some think it is\n: the ultimate.  If you rely simply on your reason then you will never\n: know more than you do now. \n\nYour argument is of the type "you'll know once you try".\nYet there are many atheists who have sincerely tried, and believed\nfor many years, but were eventually honest enough to admit that \nthey had lived in a virtual reality.\n\nWhat else but reason I can use? I don't have the spiritual means \nChristians often refer to. My conscience disagrees with the Bible.\nI don't even believe I have a soul. I am fully dependent on my\nbody - indeed, I _am_ this body. When it goes up with flames, so\ndoes my identity. God can entertain herself with copies of me\nif she wants.\n\n: To learn you must accept that which you don't know.\n\nWhat does this mean? To learn you must accept that you don't know \nsomething, right-o. But to learn you must _accept_ something I don't\nknow, why? This is not the way I prefer to learn. It is unwise to\nmerely swallow everything you read. Suppose I write a book telling\nhow the Great Invisible Pink Unicorn (tm) has helped me in my\ndaily problems, would you accept this, since you can't know whether\nit is true or not?\n\nNote that the GIPU is also omnipotent, omnipresent, and loves just\nabout everyone. Besides, He (and She) is guiding every writer on this planet,\nyou and me, and not just some people who write legendary stories\n2000 years ago.\n\nYour god is just one aspect of His and Her Presence.\n\nPetri
"Isaac Asimov read creationist books.  He read the Bible.  He had ample\nopportunity to kneel before his Creator and Savior.  He refused.  In\nfact, he sent out a strong promotional letter urging support of the\nAmerican Humanist Association, shortly before he died."\n\n   --excerpt from Ken Ham, "Asimov Meets His Creator," _Back to Genesis_\n     No. 42, June 1992, p. c (included in _Acts & Facts_ vol. 21, no. 6,\n     June 1992, from the Institute for Creation Research).  This is one\n     of the most offensive articles they've ever published--but at least\n     it argues *against* a deathbed conversion.  There's a part of the\n     article even worse than what I've just quoted, in which an excerpt\n     from a reader's letter says that if Asimov is burning in hell now,\n     "then he certainly has had a 180-degree change in his former beliefs\n     about creation and the Creator."  (A post-deathbed conversion.)
Of course not. I would think that would be great _fun_, not having ever\nfelt the joy and peace the Christians speak of with a longing gaze.\nThis is not what I got when I believed - I just tried to hide my fear\nof getting punished for something I never was sure of. The Bible is\nhopelessly confusing for someone who wants to know for sure. God did\nnot answer. In the end, I found I had been following a mass delusion,\na lie. I can't believe in a being who refuses to give a slightest hint\nof her existence.\n\n\nI suggest they should honestly reconsider the reasons why they believe\nand analyse their position. In fact, it is amusing to note in this\ncontext that many fundamentalist publications tell us exactly the\nopposite - one should not examine one's belief critically.\n\nI'll tell you something I left out of my 'testimony' I posted to this\ngroup two months ago. A day after I finally found out my faith is over,\nI decided to try just one more time. The same cycle of emotional\nresponses fired once again, but this time the delusion lasted only\na couple of hours. I told my friend in a phone that it really works,\nthank god, just to think about it again when I hung up. I had to admit\nthat I had lied, and fallen prey to the same illusion.\n\n\nI used to believe what I read in books when I was younger, or what\nother people told me, but I grew more and more skeptical the more I\nread. I learned what it means to use _reason_.\n\nAs a student of chemistry, I had to perform a qualitative analysis\nof a mixture of two organic compounds in the lab. I _hated_ experiments\nlike this - they are old-fashioned and increase the student's workload\nconsiderably. Besides, I had to do it twice, since I failed in my first\nattempt. However, I think I'll never forget the lesson: \n\nNo matter how strongly you believe the structure of the unknown is X,\nit may still be Y. It is _very_ tempting to jump into conclusions, take\na leap of faith, assure oneself, ignore the data which is inconsistent. \nBut it can still be wrong. \n\nI found out that I was, after all, using exactly the same mechanism\nto believe in god - mental self-assurance, suspension of fear, \nfiltering of information. In other words, it was only me, no god\nplaying any part. \n\n\nOh? And I had better believe this? Dan, many UFO stories are much better\ndocumented than the resurrection of Jesus. The resurrection is documented\nquite haphazardly in the Bible - it seems the authors did not pay too\nmuch attention to which wild rumour to leave out. Besides, the ends of\nthe gospels probably contain later additions and insertions; for instance,\nthe end of Mark (16:9-20) is missing from many early texts, says my Bible.\n\nJesus may have lived and died, but he was probably misunderstood.\n\n\nThis is easy. I believe that the world exists independent of my mind,\nand that logic and reason can be used to interpret and analyse what I\nobserve. Nothing else need to be taken on faith, I will go by the\nevidence. \n\nIt makes no difference whether I believe George Washington existed or not.\nI assume that he did, considering the vast amount of evidence presented.\n\n\nA liar, how do you know what my attitude was? Try reading your Bible\nagain. \n\nI was willing to die for my faith. Those who do are usually remembered\nas heroes, at least among those who believe. Dan, do you think I'm\nlying when I say I believed firmly for 15 years? It seems it is \nvery difficult to admit that someone who has really believed does not\ndo so anymore. But I can't go on lying to myself.\n\nBlind trust is dangerous, and I was just another blind led by the blind.\nBut if god really wants me, she'll know what to do. I'm willing. I just\ndon't know whether she exists - looking at the available evidence,\nit looks like she doesn't. \n\nPetri

What does one wear to an\neternal damnation?
RAPTURE - OCTOBER 28, 1992\n\n		WHAT TO DO IN CASE YOU MISS THE RAPTURE\n\nI. STAY CALM AND DO NOT PANIC\n\n	Your natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to\npanic.  But to do so is absolutely useless now.  If you had wanted to get right\nwith God before the rapture, you could have, but you chose to wait.  Now your \nonly chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the \nTribulation.  "But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be \nsaved." - Matthew 24:13\n\nII. REALIZE YOU ARE NOW LIVING DURING THE GREAT TRIBULATION\n\n	The Great Tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of\nthe rapture until Christ's second coming.  Also know as "the time of Jacob's\n(Israel's) trouble" (Jere 30:7) and "Daniel's Seventieth Week" (Dan 9), this \nperiod will be unparalleled in trouble and horror.\n\nIII. GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEM\n\n	Soon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community \n(the revived Roman Empire), Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible will\nbe tantamount to treason.  The Bible, however, will be your most valuable \npossession during the Tribulation.\n\nIV. READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\n\n	Since all of your Bibles may be confiscated, even if you are careful, it\nis imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can\nquote them.  It is especially important to read Daniel, Luke 21, Matthew 24, \nRevelation, and Amos, for these books describe the events you can expect to\nunfold before you.  \n\nV. PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\n\n	Pray until the power of God comes strongly upon you - pray and pray \nand pray.  Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual \nstrength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the\nsake of Christ.  \n\nVI. DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST - EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVED\nONES DIE AS MARTYRS\n\n	After the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community, he\nwill institute a world economic system, designed so that you cannot buy, sell,\nor eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name.  Money will be\nuseless.  "And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and \nslave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that\nno one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, \nor the number of his name.  Here is wisdom.  Let him who has understanding\ncalculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number\nis 666" - Revelation 13:16-18.  \n	The Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of \nhumanity.  Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed\nin the past, such as the Holocaust.\n[or maybe the crusades? -M]\nYou cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist's\nrule; it will be much worse than anything in history (Matt 24:21) "...I saw\nunder the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and\nfor the testimony which they held.  And a white robe was given to each of \nthem: and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, \nuntil both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren, who would be\nkilled as they were, was completed." Revelation 6:9, 11.\n	His targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image\nor take the mark on their forehead or right hadn/ "...And I saw the souls of \nthose who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of \nGod, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark\non their foreheads or on the hands." - Revelation 20:4.  He will use every\nform of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ.  Nor\nwill he hesitate to use your loved ones against you, even your children, \ntorturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take\nthe mark.  \n	If you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image, however,\nyou will be consigned to the second death, which is the Lake of Fire.\n[Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash...-M]\nYou cannot be redeemed.  It is better to endure torture for a short while and\ngain eternal life then [sic] to endure eternal torment in the Ring^H^H^H^H Lake\nof Fire.  "...If anyone worships the Beast and his image, and receives his \nmark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink the wine of\nthe wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His \nindignation.  An [sic] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the \npresence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb." -Revelation \n14:9-10 \n\n[and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders; special hats given to\nthe first 5,000 at the stadium --M] \n\nVII. SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL\n\n	Although you may not be able to hide from the Antichrist's government\nuntil the end of the Tribulation, all of the time you gain in hiding is \nimportant for your spiritual growth and strengthening, since only those who are\nextremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake.\n	The first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or\nmountainous area, for the Antichrist's control will come last to the least\npopulated areas.  Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay \nattuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation.\n["As you can see on the weather map, heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep\ninto our area by daybreak.  Expect delays on I-95 outbound, and perhaps school\nclosings" --M] \nStore water and food, because you will not be able to purchase anything without\nthe mark.  Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste\nfrom nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood.\n[Get a good water filter. --M]\nBring different types of clothing for all seasons, as well as flashlights,\nbatteries, generators, and First Aid supplies.  In short, learn how to \nsurvive and live off the land as the pioneers did.\n\nVIII. TRUST NO ONE\n	\n	There will be secret agents everywhere, spying for the Antichrist's\ngovernment.  Be on the lookout.\n[Perot supporters take note --M]\n\nIX. WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST\n\n	It is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to,\nfor he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will\nbring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it.  We can infer from Daniel \n11 certain characteristics of this man.  Popular during the first three and a\nhalf years of the Tribulation, he will dominate the airwaves.  He will be \nphysically appealing, highly intelligent, with Christ-like charisma and \npersonality.  An international politician, military tactician and economic\nexpert, his word will be peace; he will make a treaty with the Jews, which\nhe will break after three and a half years.  He will have such supernatural \npower that a mortal wound to his head will be healed.  Even the very elect will\nbe deceived.  If you do not pray and read the Bible, you too will be deceived.\n[Dominate the airwaves?  Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh...-M]\n	The antichrist will have a companion, the False Prohphet [sic], who\nwill make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak.  \nAll who refuse to worhsip [sic] the image will be killed.  The final three and\na half years will be absolutely insane, with demonized spirits everywhere.\n\nX. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE!\n\n	The seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of\nChrist.  The Antichrist will be defeated.  Be steadfast and endure, and you \nwill be rewarded greatly in Heaven.  \n	Start reading the Bible and praying fervently now.  The salvation of \nyour sould depends upon it.  Determine that, come what may, you will not take\nthe mark or worship the Antichrist.  You still have a chance to be saved or\nremain saved, but this time you will have to be "faithful unto death."\n\n	May God find you ready in the hour of his glorious return!\n\n******************************************************************************\nMike Cluff				*  "Christianity is Stupid.\nv22964qs@ubvms or mike%luick@ubvms	*   Give up." -Negativland\nUB Language Perception Laboratory	*  \n******************************************************************************\n\n\n/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\ \n\nBob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM \n\nThey said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away,\nand sank Manhattan out at sea.
(deletion)\n \n \nBogus. I just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism.\nThe point is that theism is *a* factor.\n \n \n \nThat's a claim you have to support. Please note that especially in the\nfield of theism, the leaders believe what they say.\n \n \n \nThat's a straw man. And as usually in discussions with you one has to\nrepeat it: Read what I have written above: not every theism leads to\nfanatism, and not all fanatism is caused by theism. The point is,\nthere is a correlation, and it comes from innate features of theism.\n \nGullibility, by the way, is one of them.\n \n \nAnd to say that I am going to forbid religion is another of your straw\nmen. Interesting that you have nothing better to offer.\n \n \n \nThat's bogus. Self reference is not circular. And since the evaluation of\nusefulness is possible within rational systems, it is allowed.\n \nYour argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics\nand mathematics are therfore circular.\n \n \n \nI've been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions\nof god here.\n \nAn axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis, what you say here\nis a an often refuted fallacy. Have a look at the discussion of the\naxiom of choice. And further, one can evaluate axioms in larger systems\nout of which they are usually derived. "I exist" is derived, if you want\nit that way.\n \nFurther, one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms.\n \nwhat is it you are trying to say?\n \n \n \nUsing the traditonal definition of gods. Personal, supernatural entities\nwith objective effects on this world. Usually connected to morals and/or\nthe way the world works.\n \n \n \nPerson A believes system B becuase it sounds so nice. That does not make\nB true, it is at best a work hypothesis. However, the content of B is that\nit is true AND that it is more than a work hypothesis. Testing or evaluating\nevidence for or against it  therefore dismissed because B (already believed)\nsays it is wronG/ a waste  of time/ not possible. Depending on the further\ncontents of B Amalekites/Idolaters/Protestants are to be killed, this can\nhave interesting effects.
I'm sure you are not.

Sounds like you were going to a different Penn State or something.\nKampus Krusade for Khrist is very vocal here, but they really have\nlittle power to get anything done.  Sometimes it seems like there\nare a lot of them because they're generally more vocal than their\nopposition, but there really aren't that many Krusaders.\n\nThe liberals tend to keep to themselves if they can help it, since\nall they really want is to be allowed to go about their own lives\nthe way they want to.  ...so you don't hear from or about most of\nthem.  The bible-bangers stand out because they want everyone to\nbe forced to live according to bible-banger rules.\n\nThe Krusaders certainly don't run this place.\n\nI'd say we've got a rather average mix. of people here....\nmuch like the rest of the U.S.  And just like everywhere else,\nsome factions are louder than others.
[reply to timmbake@mcl.ucsb.edu (Bake Timmons]\n \n \nWhich newsgroup have you been reading?  The few anti-Christian posts are\nvirtually all in response to some Christian posting some "YOU WILL ALL\nBURN IN HELL" kind of drivel.\n \n \nBake, it is transparently obvious that you are a theist pretending to be\nan atheist.  You probably think you are very clever, but we see this all\nthe time.\n \n \nBut of course *you* have dismissed them because you are an atheist,\nright?\n \n \nIn other words, you *didn't* read the FAQ after all.
"Liberate" is the way an invader describes an invasion, including, if\nI'm not mistaken, the Iraqi liberation of Kuwait.  Never invaded\nNicaragua?  Only with more word games: can you say "send in the\nMarines?"  \n\n\nOh, good: word games.  If you let the aggressor pick the words,\nthere's scarcely ever been a reprehensible military action.\n\n\n\nThat's a convenient technique, much seen on alt.atheism: define those\nwho disagree with you according to a straw-man extreme that matches\nvirtually nobody.\n\n\nVery noble and patriotic.  I'm sure the fine young Americans who\ncarpet-bombed Iraqi infantry positions from over the horizon,\ndestroyed Iraq's sewer and water infrastructure from the safety of the\nsky or further, or who bulldozed other Iraqi infantry into their\ntrenches [or more importantly the commanders who ordered them to] were\njust thrilled to be risking death (if not risking it by much) in the\ndefense of the liberty of ... well, wealthy Kuwaitis.  Can't have\nthose oil-fields under a tyrant's heel if that tyrant is antagonistic\nto US interests... \n\n\nHaving pigeon-holed "peace-niks" (in this context, "people who\ndisagree with me about the conduct of the Gulf War") into\n"peace-at-all-cost-hitler-supporting-genocide-abetting-wimps", you can\nnow express righteous indignation when "they" refuse to fit this mold\nand question the conduct of the war on legitimate terms.  HOW DARE\nTHEY!\n\n\nYes, hypocrisy indeed!  Those violent peace-niks!  (Care to list an\nexample here?)\n\n\nWow: instant '80's nostalgia!  [Of course, "peace-nik" itself is a\n'50's Cold War derogatory term equating those who promote pacifism\nwith Godless Pinko Communists].  Yes indeed, I felt my freedoms\nmightily threatened by Iraq...
Thank you.  I now know at least that though I may be on drugs, at\nleast I'm not the only one.\n\n\nYes, this took some getting used to -- of course not having an Indian\nconnection, no knowledge of hindi, etc., this was not trivial for me.\nI did have, thanks to the wonders of the net, "A Glossary to *Satanic\nVerses*", posted to rec.arts.books by Vijay Raghavan, which explains a\nlot of the Indian English constructions, Indian culture references,\neven the Islamic references ("Jahilia", "Submission", the context of\nthe Satanic Verses incident, etc.) -- what I have only covers the\nfirst couple of hundred pages, but it helped me get into the flow of\nthe novel [I can mail this to anyone interested; if anyone has\nportions after part I, if they exist, I'd like to get those].

[deleted stuff from Andrew wrt which atheist myth is Bill re: to]\n\n"Counterfeit atheists". Hmmmm. So, we're just cheap knock-offs of the\nTrue Atheists. \n\nReligion demonstrates itself to be absurd. Constantly. Personally, if \nsomeone asks, I'm happy to point out how this is so. \n\n\nMan, what *is* your pill wrt atheists? If you're going to make such\ncontentious statements, back them up! At least, READ NEWS: time-and-time\nagain, we've hashed out the beliefs various religous doctrines hold. \nTry debating reasonably with someone who makes a statement like, \n"...more accurately oxymoric is the a term like, reasonable atheist."\nThen take a look at the responses we've given Tammy. Seem pretty\n"reasonable", nay, even "polite" to me. \n\n[accusations of myths a-flyin']\n\nI saw your reference to "According to" in the original article.\nThen you do such an excellent job of spewing dogma that, well, the\nimplication was pretty clear (if wrong, in this case).\n\n[jeez, a misunderstanding. Let it go.]\n\n[more statements to wrap this thing up]\n\nIf you had WRITTEN your post with the same as care as the FAQ has been,\nwe wouldn't be having this discussion.\n\n[gems about evidence deleted]\n\n\nJeez, do I have to point this out to you? This discussion is not all\ninstances of human reason. Therefore, your implication is false.\n\n\n\nHow lame can you get. Who said anything about the 'truth' of things?\nRead the FAQ very carefully, please. Then report your findings about\nwhere it says the purpose of a.a is to find the 'truth' of things.\n\nAnd stop impressing your own misguided image of atheists upon us. It's\nreally pissing me off.
When they're not important, yes.  All scientists do.  Otherwise science would\nnever get anywhere.\n\n\nHang about -- not atomic interactions in general.  Just specific ones which\nare deemed unimportant.  Like gravitational interactions between ions, which\nare so small they're drowned out by electrostatic effects, and so on.\n\n\nOh, probably.  They still make people memorize equations and IR spectra. \nMaybe in a few decades they'll discover the revolutionary "data book"\ntechnique.
Diplomatic :-)\n\nI realize I'm fighting Occam's razor in this argument, so I'll try to\nexplain why I feel a mind is necessary. \n\nFirstly, I'm not impressed with the ability of algorithms. They're\ngreat at solving problems once the method has been worked out, but not\nat working out the method itself.\n\nAs a specific example, I like to solve numerical crosswords (not the\nsimple do-the-sums-and-insert-the-answers type, the hard ones.) To do\nthese with any efficiency, you need to figure out a variety of tricks.\nNow, I know that you can program a computer to do these puzzles, but\nin doing so you have to work out the tricks _yourself_, and program\nthem into the computer. You can, of course, 'obfuscate' the trick, and\nwrite the program so that it is uncovered, but as far as I can see,\nthe trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered. Does\nthis mean that all the ideas we will ever have are already\npre-programmed into our brains? This is somewhat unlikely, given that\nour brains ultimately are encoded in 46 chromosomes worth of genetic\nmaterial, much of which isn't used.\n\nOne way around this is to bring the environment into the equation, but\n(again, as far as I can see) this still has an air of 'if you see\nobject X, then perform action Y,' and we don't seem to get anywhere.\nThe algorithm has to anticipate what it might see, and what\nconclusions to draw from it's experience.\n\nThe other problem with algorithms is their instability. Not many\nalgorithms survive if you take out a large portion of their code, yet\npeople survive strokes without going completely haywire (there are\nside-effects, but patients still seem remarkably stable.) Also,\nneurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate -\ncan an algorithm survive if I randomly corrupt various bits of it's\ncode?\n\nThe next problem is the sticky question of "What is colour?" (replace\n'colour' with the sensation of your choice.) Presumably, the\nmaterialist viewpoint is that it's the product of some kind of\nchemical reaction. The usual products of such a reaction are energy +\ndifferent chemicals. Is colour a mixture of these? If this is so, a\ncomputer won't see colour, because the chemistry is different. Does an\nalgorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over an\nequivalent that doesn't? It shouldn't, because the outputs of each\nalgorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstances. So why do\nwe see colour?\n\n\n\nA bit of idle speculation...\n\nIf I remember correctly, quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction,\nwith two processes acting on it. The first process has been called\n'Unitary Evolution' (or 'U'), is governed by Schroedinger's equation\nand is well known. The second process, called various things such as\n'collapse of the wavefunction' or 'state vector reduction' (or 'R'),\nand is more mysterious. It is usually said to occur when a\n'measurement' takes place, although nobody seems to know precisely\nwhen that occurs. When it does occur, the effect of R is to abruptly\nchange the wavefunction.\n\nI envisage R as an interaction between the wavefunction and 'something\nelse,' which I shall imaginitively call 'part X.' It seems reasonable\nto assume that _something_ causes R, although that something might be\nthe wavefunction itself (in which case, part X is simply the\nwavefunction. Note, though, that we'd need more than U to explain R.)\n\nAnyway, I'm speculating that minds would be in part X. There seems to\nbe some link between consciousness and R, in that we never see linear\nsuperpositions of anything, although there are alternative\nexplainations for this. I've no idea how a brain is supposed to access\npart X, but since this is only speculation, that won't matter too\nmuch :-) My main point is that there might be a place for minds in\nphysics.\n\nI'll go back to my nice padded cell now, if that's OK with you :-)\n\n\n-- \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKevin Anthoney                                         kax@cs.nott.ac.uk\n            Don't believe anything you read in .sig files.
I would guess that it probably has something to do with the ease of which\nideas and thoughts are communicated on a college campus.  In the real world\n(tm) it's easier for theists (well, people in general really) to lock\nthemselves into a little bubble where they only see and talk to those\npeople who are of the same opinion as they are.  In college you are\nconstantly surrounded by and have to interact with people who have\ndifferent ideas about life, the universe, and everything.  It is much much\nharder to build a bubble around yourself to keep everyone else's ideas from\nreaching you.\n\nSo, in a world where theists are forced to contend with and listen to\natheists and theists of other religions some are bound to have a change in\ntheir beliefs over four years.  There is nowhere to run.... :-)
Actually, I find the stuff about JC being a carpenter more\ninteresting.  Is there an independent source for this assertion,\nor is it all from the Christian Bible?  Is there any record at\nall of anything he built?  A table, a house, some stairs (Norm\nAbrams says the real test of a carpenter's skill is building\nstairs with hand tools).  Did he leave any plans behind for, say\nkitchen counters and cabinets?  Did he build his own cross?\nIf so, did he use pressure-treated lumber?  Gotta use that\npressure-treated anywhere that wood meets concrete, but it\nholds up better anyway for mose outdoor applications.  I keep\nseeing these bumper-stickers that say "My boss is a Jewish\nCarpenter," but they're always on the back of Ford Escorts,\nand a real carpenter's apprentice would probably drive a\npickup, so I'm out for verification that he really was a\ncarpenter.\n\nDean Kaflowitz

IMO, the influence of Stalin, or for that matter, Ayn Rand, invalidates your \nassumption that theism is the factor to be considered.  Gullibility, \nblind obedience to authority, lack of scepticism, and so on, are all more \nreliable indicators.  And the really dangerous people - the sources of\nfanaticism - are often none of these things.  They are cynical manipulators\nof the gullible, who know precisely what they are doing.  Now, *some*\nbrands of theism, and more precisely *some* theists, do tend to fanaticism,\nI grant you.  To tar all theists with this brush is bigotry, not a reasoned\nargument - and it reads to me like a warm-up for censorship and restriction\nof religious freedom.  Ever read Animal Farm?\n\n\nWell, there is a glaring paradox here:  an argument that reason is useful\nbased on reason would be circular, and argument not based on reason would\nbe irrational.  Which is it?\n\nThe first part of the second statement contains no information, because\nyou don't say what "the beliefs" are.  If "the beliefs" are strong theism \nand/or strong atheism, then your statement is not in general true.  The\nsecond part of your sentence is patently false - counterexample: an\naxiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis, but is\nassumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is\nused to obtain it.\n\n\nI can't agree with this until you are specific - *which* theism?  To\nsay that all theism is necessarily antirational requires a proof which\nI suspect you do not have.\n\n\nI don't understand this.  Can you formalise your argument?
With the Southern Baptist Convention convening this June to consider\nthe charges that Freemasonry is incompatible with christianity, I thought\nthe following quotes by Mr. James Holly, the Anti-Masonic Flag Carrier,\nwould amuse you all...\n\n     The following passages are exact quotes from "The Southern \nBaptist Convention and Freemasonry" by James L.

: I heard about the arms sale to Saudi Arabia.  Now, how is it such a grave\n: mistake to sell Saudi Arabia weapons?  Or are you claiming that we shouldn't\n: sell any weapons to other countries?  Straightforward answer please.\n\nSaudi Arabia is an oppressive regime that has been recently interfering\nin the politcs of newly renunified Yemen, including assasinations and \nborder incursions. It is entirely possible that they will soon invade.\nUnluckily for Yemen it is not popular in the West as they managed to put\naside political differences during reunification and thus the West has\neffectively lost one half (North?) as a client state.

I know\nthat romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our deeds, yet\nhebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless, saying' You fools,\ndo you still think that just believing is enough?'\n\nNow if someone is fully believing but there life is totally lead by themselves\nand not by God, according to Romans that person is still saved by there faith.\nBut then there is the bit which says that God preferes someone who is cold to\nhim (i.e. doesn't know him - condemned) so a lukewarm Christian someone who\nknows and believes in God but doesn't make any attempt to live by the bible.\n\nNow I am of the opinion that you a saved through faith alone (not what you do)\nas taught in Romans, but how can I square up in my mind the teachings of James\nin conjunction with the lukewarm Christian being 'spat-out'\n\nCan anyone help me, this really bothers me.-- \n\nin Christ,\n\nWill\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n--Adam

First, you seem to assume all atheists think alike.  An atheist does not\nbelieve in the existence of a god.  Our opinions on issues such as \ncapital punishment and abortion, however, vary greatly.  \n\nIf you were attacking the views of a particular atheist (Benedikt, I \npresume), then please present your argument as such and do not lump us\nall together.\n\nAs for the issues, let's start with abortion.  Personally, I do not support\nabortion as a means of population control or contraception-after-the-fact.\nHowever, I support the right of any woman to have an abortion, regardless\nof what my personal views may be, because it would be arrogant of me to tell\nany individual what he/she may or may not do to his/her body, and the domain\nof legislators should not extend into the uterus.  That's my opinion, and I\nam sure many atheists and theists would disagree with me.\n\nI do not defend homosexuality as a means of population control, but I \ncertainly defend it as an end to itself.  I think most homosexuals would\nbe angered to hear of anyone characterizing their personal relationship as\nnothing more than a conscious effort to keep population levels down.  \n\nAs for atheists believing all values are biological, I have no idea what\nyou're talking about.\n\nFinally, there are the issues of war and capital punishment.  An atheist\ncan object to either one just as easily as a theist might.  You seem to\nbe hung up on some supposed conspiratorial link between atheism and \npopulation control.  Could this be the "atheist cause" you were referring \nto a few posts back?

For example, those who accuse me \nof lying about my personal beliefs, while also complaining that I don't answer\ntheir questions.  \n\n#>#Like that you what you sense is evidence for the sensed to be there.\n#>#If only everything would be so easy.\n#>\n#>What almost everyone senses is evidence for the sensed to be there.\n#>Because to all intents and purposes, it *is* there.\n#> #We had that argument. For one, your claim that everyone senses it\n#is not founded, and you have been asked to give evidence for it often.\n#And then, the correct statement would be it is reason to assume that it\n#is there unless evidence against it has been found.\n\nI have no problem with the second statement.  I have provided an\nargument that almost everyone senses that Freedom is valuable - the\nonly cogent objection to this came from jon livesey, and was offered\nby some other people too: essentially, that people disagree about\nfuzzy concepts such as Freedom.  It's a good point, and I'm thinking\nabout it.\n# \n#Your trick is to say, I feel A is not right, and so do many I know,\n#therefore A is absolutely right. It neglects the possibility that\n#these people consider A to be right as an effect of the same process,\n#restricting the claim of its absoluteness to those who have been subject\n#of that process. In other words, refutes it. You make the ontological\n#claim, you have to prove it.\n\nNonsense.  My "trick" is to say:  I feel that A is better than B and so \ndoes almost any disinterested person I ask.  Best evidence is therefore \nthat A really is better than B, subject to the assumption that we\ncan establish to our mutual satisfaction what we mean by A and B, and\nthat the resulting system of values is self-consistent.\n\nNow get this:  "really is better" is an idealisation, a fictional model,\nin the same sense that "real material existence" is a fictional model. It\nmay or may not correspond to something true.  It is nonetheless a useful\n_assumption_.  Far more useful than the equally assumed relativist \n"trick", to wit:\n\nI feel that A is better than B, and so does almost any disinterested person\nI ask.  However, if even one person disagrees that A is better than B,\nor if even one person dissents from mutually agreed definitions of A and B,\nthen it is the case that B is better than A for that person, and nothing\nmore can be said.  \n\nI say this is useless because it inexorably implies that a supermajority\nseeking to maximise A cannot morally take action against someone seeking to\nmaximise B (e.g. a terrorist).  To do that would be to claim that \na supermajority's carefully considered morality would be better than the \nterrorist's - which would, of course, be true, but a no-no for an ethical\nrelativist.  To claim that ethical relativism implies anything else is\nsimply weasel words, and an example of compartmentalisation to rival\nanything in the world of religion.\n\n#>#For a similar argument, I sense morality is subjective, it does not\n#>#hurt me to do things that are considered to be objectively wrong by\n#>#others.\n#>\n#>If you mean that you do things that some others consider objectively\n#>wrong, and it turns out not to be the case for you - of course this\n#>is possible.  It is neither evidence for subjectivism, nor evidence\n#>against objectivism (except sometimes, in a pragmatic sense).\n#>\n#It serves as a counterexample for that everything that is subject to\n#judgements is absolute. And as long as you don't provide evidence for\n#that there is something universally agreed upon there is no reason to\n#believe your hypothesis.\n\nI've done this: freedom, with the proviso that I still have to \nanswer jon's objection that fuzzy concepts like freedom have no\nobjective meaning.\n\n#Further, in order to make morality absolute, universal, or objective,\n#you would have to show that it is independent of humans, or the attributes\n#above look quite misleading.\n\nNot really.  What evidence is there that _anything_ exists independently\nof humans?  You'll be hard pressed to find any that isn't logically\nequivalent when applied to values.\n\n#>An analogous set of premises would be:\n#>\n#>Premise 1:  Some people believe that objectively speaking the shortest\n#>            route  from my house to a bar is through the main entrance\n#>            of the estate, and down the Malahide road.\n#>\n#>Premise 2:  I checked it out, and found that the shortest route from my\n#>            which is much closer.\n#>\n#>You would never deduce from these that there is no shortest route from my\n#>house to a bar; yet that is seemingly how you derive your relativist claim,\n#>using premises which are logically no different.\n#>\n# \n#No. Morals are a matter of belief so far. The people still believe that the\n#shortest way is through the main entrance. No agreement on *belief* here.\n#And in order to have an analogy you would have to show that there is a\n#shortest way and that there is a method to convince everyone of that it\n#is the shortest way indeed. In other words,  your analogy works only when\n#one assumes that your  premises are right in the first place. If not, it is\n#a fallacy.\n\nAnd if this were an argument for objectivism, you'd be right.  It isn't,\nthough, it's a demonstration that the argument you gave me is neither argument\n*against* objectivism, nor argument *for* relativism.  Your gimmick is to\nassume in the first place that values aren't real, and to use this to "prove"\nthat values aren't real.  In other words, you beg the question against me.

What do you accept as a fact --  the roundness of the earth (after \nall, the ancient Greeks thought it was a sphere, and then Newton said \nit was a spheroid, and now people say it's a geoid [?])?  yourself \n(isn't your personal identity just a theoretical construct to make \nsense of memories, feelings, perceptions)?

I don't see how any of the things that you are \nasserting are any more factual than things like gravity, atoms or \nevolution.\n\n    In short, before I am willing to consider your concept of what\na fact is, I'm going to have to have, as a minimum, some examples of\nwhat you think are facts.

Now, cruelty must\ninvolve some sort of suffering, I believe.  I don't think someone that gets\nshot in the head or electrocuted really suffers very much.  Even a hanging\nprobably produces one sharp instance of pain, but it's over so quickly...\n\n\nPardon?\n\n\nNo.  Well, again I stated that a painless death isn't cruel, but I don't\nthink I stated that all painful executions *are* cruel.  I think that some\nare cruel, depending on the nature and duration of the pain.\n\n\nAnything more than an instant, I guess.  Any death by suffocation\nasphyxiation, or blood loss would be cruel, I think (this includes the\ngas chamber, and drawing and quartering).  I'd say that any pain that\nlasts, say, over twenty seconds or so would be too long (but this may\nbe an arbitrary cutoff, I suppose).

(Deletion)\n \nThe reference to it's not yet being ethics is dubious. You have used the terms\nabsolute, objective and others interchangeably.

When the If is not fulfilled, your intermission is a waste of time.\nAssuming that you don't intend this, it is reasonable to conclude that you\nwant to argue a point.\n \nYou have made a interesting statement here, namely that of the disinterested\nobserver. There is no such thing in morals. Probably the shortest proof for\nobjective and morality being a contradiction.\n \n \n \nFine. And that freedom is valuable is not generally agreed upon. I could\nname quite a lot of people who state the opposite. (Not that that wasn't\nmentioned before).

I read it when it first came out, and the controversy broke. Put my name\non the waiting list at the library (that way if the book was really\noffensive, none of my money would find its way to the author or\npublisher), and read it, "cover to cover" (to use a phrase that seems\npopular here right now).\n\nAnd I *liked* it. The writing style was a little hard to get used to, but\nit was well worth the effort. Coming from a similar background (Rushdie\ngrew up in Bombay in a muslim family, and moved to England; I grew up in\nNew Delhi), it made a strong impression on me.  (And he used many of the\nstrange constructions of Indian English: the "yaar" at the end of a\nsentence, "Butbutbut," the occasional hindi phrase, etc.)\n\nAt the time I still "sorta-kinda" thought of myself as a muslim, and I\ncouldn't see what the flap was all about. It seemed clear to me that this\nwas allegory.  It was clear that he described some local prostitutes who\ntook on the names and personae of Muhammed's wives, and had not (as my\ngrandfather thundered) implied that Muhammed's wives were prostitutes; in\nshort, every angry muslim that had read even part of the book seemed to\nhave missed the point completely.  (And I won't mention the fact that the\nmost militant of them had never even seen the book. Oops, I just did!)\n\nPerhaps in a deep sense, the book is insulting to Islam, because it\nexposes the silliness of revealed religion - why does an omnipotent deity\nneed an agent? She can come directly to me, can't she? How do we know that\nMuhammed didn't just go out into the desert and smoke something? And how\ndo we know that the scribes he dictated the Quran to didn't screw up, or\nput in their own little verses? And why can Muhammed marry more than four\nwomen, when no other muslim is allowed to? (Although I think the biggest\ninsult to Islam is that the majority of its followers would want to\nsuppress a book, sight unseen, on the say-so of some "holy" guy. Not to\nmention murder the author.)\n\n\nI had much the same response when I tried to talk about the book. A really\nsilly argument - after all, how many of these same people have read "Mein\nKampf?" It just made me wonder - what are they afraid of? Why don't they\njust read the book and decide for themselves?\n\nMaybe the reaction of the muslim community to the book, and the absence of\nprotest from the "liberal" muslims to Khomeini's fatwa outrage, was the\nfinal push I needed into atheism!\n\n-s
Yes.\n \n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     \n\nNo, look again. While you never *said* it, the implication is pretty clear.\nI'm sorry, but I can only respond to your words, not your true meaning. Usenet\nis a slippery medium. \n\n[deleted wrt the burden of proof]\nLook, I'm not supporting *any* dogmatic position. I'd be a fool to say that\nin the large group of people that are atheists, no people exist who wish to\nproselytize in the same fashion as religion. How many hard atheists do you \nsee posting here, anyway? Maybe I'mm just not looking hard enough...\n\n\nI never meant to do so, although I understand where you might get that idea.\nI was merely using the 'bible' example as an allegory to illustrate my\npoint.\n\n\nEvidence for what? Who? I think I may have lost this thread...\n \n[why theists are arrogant deleted]\n\nGuilty as charged. What I *meant* to say was, the theists who *are* arrogant\nare this way because they say ...  Other than that, I thought my meaning\nwas clear enough. Any position that claims itself as superior to another with\nno supporting evidence is arrogant. Thanks for your apology, btw.\n\n\nExplained above.

The Bible is far\n: from universally accepted.  The Bible is NOT a proof of god;\n: it is only a proof that some people have thought that there\n: was a god.  (Or does it prove even that?  They might have been\n: writing it as series of fiction short-stories.  As in the\n: case of Dionetics.)

The Bible itself is not the point,\nit's what it contains. It makes no difference who accpets the Bible or\neven who's unaware of its existence, Christians hold that it applies\nuniversally because mankind shares the same nature and the same fate\nand the same innate knowledge of God.\n\n2) See above\n\n3) If you read my post with same care as read the FAQ, we wouldn't be\nhaving this conversation.\n\nBill\n\n: >freedom.

And, in much\n: of oriental philosophic history, it generally doesn't pop up as\n: the idea of a god so much as the question of what natural forces\n: are and which ones are out there.  From a world-wide view,\n: human nature just makes us wonder how the universe came to\n: be and/or what force(s) are currently in control.  A natural\n: tendancy to believe in "God" only exists in religious wishful\n: thinking.\n\nYes, human reason does always come back to the existence of God, we're\nhaving this discussion are we not?\n\nBill\n\n: >I said all this to make the point that Christianity is eminently\n: >reasonable, that Divine justice is just and human nature is much\n: >different than what atheists think it is. Whether you agree or not\n\n: YOU certainly are not correct on human nature.  You are, at\n: the least, basing your views on a completely eurocentric\n: approach.

Granted it's extremely unhip to be a WASP male, and\nanything European is contemptable, but I thought this kind of\ndialogue, the purpose of a.a, was to get at the truth of things. But\nthen I remember the oxymoron, reasonalble atheist, and I understand.

It reduces to\n#\n#  (1): Alterian dosh arriving in my account is due to [benefactor or bug].\n#\n#  (2): this is not evidence for [benefactor], neither is it evidence for\n#       [bug] (meaning that it doesn't lend more weight to one than to the\n#       other)\n#\n#  (3): therefore no evidence can exist for [benefactor] and no evidence\n#       can exist for [bug].\n#\n#But (3) relies on a shift in meaning from (2). When you say (paraphrased)\n#in (2) that this is not "evidence for [benefactor]", for example, what you\n#mean is that it's no *more* evidence for [benefactor] than it is for [bug].\n\nYes, that's what I mean.\n\n#In (3), however, you've shifted the meaning of "evidence for [benefactor]"\n#so that it now means `absolute' "evidence for [benefactor]" rather than\n#`relative' "evidence for [benefactor]" w.r.t. [bug].\n\nNot really, I meant evidence that would tend to one over the other.  I\nthink this is just a communications problem.   What I am trying to say,\nin my clumsy way, is that while I buy your theory as far as it relates\nto theism making predictions (prayer, your 'Rapture' example), I don't\nbuy your use of Occam's razor in all cases where A=0.\n\nIn my example, one couldn't dismiss\n[benefactor] or [bug] on the grounds of simplicity - one of these is necessary\nto explain the dosh.  I brought up the 'one-by-one dismissal' process to\nshow that it would be wrong to do so.  From what you're saying in this\npost, it seems you agree, and we're talking at cross-purposes.\n\n#(3) is still in contradiction to (1).\n#\n#Some sums may help. With B = benefactor, b = bug, d = dosh arrives in account:\n#\n#  (1) implies  P(B+b | d) = 1\n#\n#Assuming that P(Bb | d) = 0, so it's either the benefactor *or* a bug\n#which is responsible if the bucks arrive, but not both, then\n#\n#   P(B+b | d)   =   P(B | d) + P(b | d)\n#\n#so\n#\n#   P(B | d) + P(b | d)  =  1\n#\n#but (3) implies that\n#\n#   P(B | d)  =  0  and  P(b | d)  =  0.\n\nNo, this isn't what I meant.  P(B | d) = 0.5 and P(b | d) = 0.5, with\nnecessarily no new observation (we've already seen the dosh) to change\nthose estimates.  I was trying to say (again, in my clumsy way) that\nit would be _wrong_ to assign 0 probability to either of these.  And that's\nprecisely what use of the Razor does in the case of gods - gods are\none class of hypothesis (there are many others) belonging to a set of\nhypotheses _one_of_which_ is necessary to explain something which otherwise \nwould _not_ be satisfactorily explained.  It can be thrown out or\nretained on grounds of non-rational preference, not of science or statistics.   \nAlternatively, one could chuck out or retain the lot, on the grounds\nthat the answer can't be known, or that the notional probability estimates\nare effectively useless, being equal (agnosticism/weak atheism).\n\n#> As they do when the set M is filled by "the universe is caused by x",\n#> where x is gods, pink unicorns, nothing, etc.  - and no observation\n#> tends to one conclusion over the other.\n#\n#Exactly the point I was making, I think. So we don't "throw out" any of\n#these, contrary to your assertion above that we do.\n\nSome people do, Simon, and they think they are doing excellent science.\nMy sole point was that they aren't.\n\n#>> Only observations which directly contradict the hypothesis H[i] (i.e. x\n#>> where P(x | H[i]) = 0) can cause P(H[i]) to go to zero after a finite\n#>> number of observations. Only in this case do we get to throw any of the\n#>> hypotheses out.\n#\n#> Exactly my point, though I may have been unclear.\n#\n#You said the diametric opposite, which I guess is the source of my confusion.\n\nI was merely trying to illustrate the incorrectness of doing so.\n\n#> What I'm trying to say is that while you are correct to say that absence of\n#> evidence can sometimes be evidence of absence, this does not hold true for\n#> all, or perhaps any, versions of theism - and it isn't true that those for\n#> which it does not hold can be discarded using the razor.\n#\n#On the contrary, those for which it does not hold are *exactly* those which\n#can be discarded using the Razor. See my post on the other branch of this\n#thread.\n\nThen you seem to be guilty of the contradiction you accuse me of.  If\nthe razor holds for gods, then it holds for all like hypotheses.  Which\nmeans that you're assigning P(x | H[i]) =0 for all i, though we've already\nestablished that it's not correct to do so when SUM(P(x|H[i]))=1 over\nall i.\n\n#> Simply put, anyone who claims to have a viable proof of the existence or\n#> non-existence of gods, whether inductive or no, is at best mistaken, and\n#> at worst barking mad.\n#\n#Luckily I make no such claim, and have specifically said as much on numerous\n#occasions. You wouldn't be constructing a strawman here, would you Frank?\n#Although that doesn't, of course, rule out my being barking mad in any case\n#(I could be barking mad in my spare time, with apologies to Cleese et al).\n#\n#But I think you miss the point once again. When I say that something is\n#"evidence against" an hypothesis, that doesn't imply that observation of\n#the said something necessarily *falsifies* the hypothesis, reducing the\n#estimate of P(H | data) to zero. If it *reduces* this quantity, it's still\n#evidence against H.\n\nNo, I got that.  I'm talking about the case when A=0.  You're clearly\ncorrect when A!=0.   And I'm not constructing a strawman (though it's\ncertainly possible that I've misunderstood what you're saying).  However,\nby any standards, a system that says when A=0, gods are highly unlikely,\nand when A!=0 gods can be dismissed using the Razor, is a system purporting\nto be an inductive proof that gods either don't exist, or are unnecessary\nto explain any or all phenomena.  In my experience, systems such as this\n(including those which purport to prove that gods exist) always contain\na fallacy upon close examination.  If that's not what you're saying, then\nplease put me straight.
I've been following this train of talk, and the question of dismissing atoms as  \nbeing in some sense "not real" leaves me uneasy.\n\nIt seems to be implied that we obseve only the effects, and therefore the  \nunderlying thing is not necessarily real.  The tree outside my window is in  \nthis category... is observe the light which bounces off of it, not the tree  \nitself.  The observation is indirect, but no more so than observations I have  \nmade of atoms.\n\nAlso, what about observations and experiments that have been routinely done  \nwith individual atoms.  I am thinking in particular of atom trapping  \nexperiments and tests of fundamental quantum mechanics such as the quantum Zeno  \neffect, where an individual atom is studied for a long period of time.\n\nSome of the attempts at quantum mechanical arguments were not very satisfying  \neither.  One has to be carefull about making such arguments without a solid  \ntechnical background in the field.  What I read seemed a little confused a  \nquite a red herring.\n\nAnyway, if the purpose of a public debate is to make the audience think, it  \nworked.  After doing so, I'm willing to try to defend the following assertion  \nif anyone cares:
From a parallel thread.  Much about definitions of bombs, etc. deleted.\n[...]\n\n\nMathew, I agree.  This, it seems, is the crux of your whole position,\nisn't it?  That the US shouldn't have supported Hussein and sold him arms\nto fight Iran?  I agree.  And I agree in ruthlessly hunting down those\nwho did or do.  But we *did* sell arms to Hussein, and it's a done deal.\nNow he invades Kuwait.  So do we just sit back and say, "Well, we sold\nhim all those arms, I suppose he just wants to use them now.  Too bad\nfor Kuwait."  No, unfortunately, sitting back and "letting things be"\nis not the way to correct a former mistake.  Destroying Hussein's\nmilitary potential as we did was the right move.  But I agree with\nyour statement, Reagan and Bush made a grave error in judgment to\nsell arms to Hussein.  So it's really not the Gulf War you abhor\nso much, it was the U.S.'s and the West's shortsightedness in selling\narms to Hussein which ultimately made the war inevitable, right?\n\nIf so, then I agree.\n\n[more deleted.]\n\nRegards,
Anton LaVey's interpretation of Satanism has always puzzled me.  I\nread his "Satanic Bible" a few years ago for a social studies project,\nas well as a book by Arthur Lyons called "The Cult of Devil Worship\nin America."  The latter included a very interesting interview with\nthe Black Pope in which he did indeed say that Satan was merely an\ninstrument for one to realize the self.  \n\nWhen I refer to Satanism, I am referring to the mishmash of rural Satanic\nritualism and witchcraft which existed before the Church of Satan.  I\ndon't consider LaVey's church to be at all "orthodox," nor do I consider\nits followers "satanists."  LaVey combined the philosophies of Nietzsche,\nCrowley, and Reich, slapped in some religious doctrine, added a little\ntouch of P.T. Barnum, and christened his creation the Church of Satan.\nNo doubt the title was a calculated attempt to attract attention...I\nsuppose he could have just as easily called it the Church of Free Sex.\n\nAt any rate, it worked (for a while).  In its heyday, the Church had a\nhuge following, including such Hollywood celebrities as Sammy Davis, Jr.\nand Jayne Mansfield.  (I have a picture of LaVey with Sammy, by the \nway.)  \n\nI find the idea of a Satanist not believing in Satan about as credible as\na Christian not believing in Christ.  But if you include the Church of\nSatan, then I suppose I need to alter my definition.  Webster's Dictionary\nand The American Heritage Dictionary will have to do the same.

As I understand, that number is deceptive.  The reason is that the money\ncost was in non-oil sales for the most part.  Iraq still is not allowed\nto sell oil, or do many of the things under the initial sanctions, but\nis still surviving.\n\n\nOf the ~93% (I have heard figures closer to 80%, but I won't quibble your\nfigures), most was dropped in carpet bombing of regions only occupied by\nenemy troops.  A B-52 drops a lot of bombs in one sortie, and we used them\naround the clock.  Not to mention other smaller aircraft using dumb\nmunitions.  \n\n2.  The Patriot uses a proximity fuse.  The adjusted figures for number\nof Patriot kills of SS-1 derivitives is ~60-70%.  That figure came\nnot from some fluke in the Pentagon, but a someone working with such\nstuff in another part of DoD.\n\n3.  The statement precision bombing was the norm, is true around areas\nwhere civilians were close to the target.  We dropped by tonnage very\nlittle bombs in populated regions, explaining the figures.  \n\n\nThis figure, is far below all the other figures I have seen.  If it\nis indeed accurate, then how do you explain the discrepancy between\nthat figure, and other figures from international organizations?\nMost figures I have seen place the hit ratio close to 70%, which is \nstill far higher than your 35%.  Or does your figure say a bomb\nmissed if the plane took off with it, and the bomb never hit the target,\nregardless of whether or not the bomb was dropped?  Such methods\nare used all the time to lie with statistics.\n\n\nI have _never_ seen any source that was claiming such a figure.  Please\npost the source so its reliability can be judged.

Now, I have made\nmy claim clear with regard to the issue of both the Twelve Imams and \nwith Khomeini's supposed claim of infalibility. After hearing your\nseemingly more knowledgable claim that Khomeini made no such claim\nregarding himself, I have withdrawn that portion of my statement\nregarding that claim. However, I have received _no_ such response\nregarding the infallibility of the Twelve Imams. There is nothing\nobfuscationist about my claims, which are always made clearly.\n \nI have received no such clear response regarding the Twelve Imams\nbut rather abstruse references to unusual metaphysical natures and \nother such opaque "concepts" often used by people to camoflage the \nbaselessness of their positions, particularly in matters of theology.\nThese are just the sorts of "concepts" used by Christian churches\nthe perverting of their religion. \n\n\nAlaikum Wassalam,
Absolutely not true. Without religion - either an established one or\none you invent for yourself - the theist and atheist are equally\n(not) interested in God, because without religious revelation there\nis _no_ information about God available. Strip away the dogma and\nthe theists/atheists are no different, simply holding a different\nopinion on a matter of little practical importance.\n\n\nSorry, but that doesn't help. What test will you apply to decide\nwhether it is God or Satan with whom you are speaking?\nHow will you know that you have not simply gone insane, or having\ndelusions? You are like a loaded gun.\n\n\nAh, you not as stupid as I assumed. :-)\n\n\nYes. We're all in this together - each human making up a small part of\nthe definition of humanity.

[...details of US built chemical plant at Al Alteer near Baghdad...]\n: However, the plant's intended use was to aid the Iraqi infrastructure.\n: It is not an example of selling a weapon.  May sound nitpicking,\n: but are we going to refuse to sell valuable parts that build the\n: infrastructure because of dual use technology? \n\n	I am contending that in this case (and in the case of the sale\nof pesticides by UK companies) that they knew full well that it was to \nbe used for the production of chemical weapons even if that was not its\nofficially stated purpose.\n\n: I personally don't think that letting Iran conquer Iraq would have been a \n: good thing.  \n\n	For that matter, neither do I (for the reasons you state). It is the \nhypocrisy and claims the US did not help Iraq that make me angry, plus the\nfact that the USA seems to believe it has the *right* to interfere where\nis sees fit (i.e. has an interest) rather than a *duty* to intervene where\nit is required. This is demonstrated by the failure of the US to do anything\nabout East Timor (and the region *is* becoming destabilised). The USA might\nhave done something approaching the right thing, given my reservations about\nthe uncessary number of civillian casualites, but for wholly the wrong reasons\nand after having a hand in creating the situation.\n\n: That in no way would affect the US later military action against Iraq.\n\n	I did not suggest it would and it would be ridiculous to assert\notherwise. I was simply indicating the USA has previously aided Iraq.\n\n: Intel on manufacturing techniques, or something of that nature? \n\n	No, apparently data (orginally from satellites although I doubt\nthat Iraq would have been given the raw data) concerning troop concentrations.
But it's STILL HAPPENING.  That's the entire point.  Only last month, John\nMajor hailed it as a great victory that he had personally secured a sale of\narms to Saudi Arabia.  The same month, we sold jet fighters to the same\nIndonesian government that's busy killing the East Timorese.\n\nIt's all very well to say "Oops, we made a boo-boo, better clean up the\nmistake", but the US and UK *keep* making the *same* mistake.  They do it so\noften that I can't believe it's not deliberate.  This suspicion is reinforced\nby the fact that the mistake is an extremely profitable one for a decrepit\neconomy reliant on arms sales.\n\n\nNo, I thought both were terrible.

Unfortunately for you, it turned out that my opinions on the matter\nwere entirely consistent in that I condemned the bombing of Dresden too.\n\nI think you're being a bit glib with your explanation of the blanket bombing\npolicy, too.  You make it sound as though we were aiming for military targets\nand could only get them by destroying civilian buildings next door.  As I\nunderstand it, that is not the case; we aimed deliberately at civilian\ntargets in order to cause massive damage and inspire terror amongst the\nGerman people.\n\n\nOh, come on.  With wars like the Falklands fresh in people's minds, that sort\nof propaganda isn't going to fool anyone.\n\n\nYes?  And what about the millions of casualties the Russians suffered?  It's\nhardly surprising the US didn't lose many men in WW2, given that you turned\nup late.

The Christian Bible says that one may kill\n#under certain circumstances.   In fact, it instructs one to kill under\n#certain circumstances.     \n\nI'd say the majority of people have a moral system that instructs them\nto kill under certain circumstances.  I do get your distinction between\nmotivate and allow, and I do agree that if a flavour of theism 'allows'\natoricities, then that's an indictment of that theism.  But it rather\ndepends on what the 'certain circumstances' are.  When you talk about\nChristianity, or Islam, then at least your claims can be understood.\nIt's when people go to a general statement about theism that it falls\napart.

If they were doing it because of some obscure\npoint of theology, then yes.  But since all protestants don't do this\n(nor do they elect extremists to do it for them), it's just too broad\ntoo say "religion did this".  I'm saying that the causes are far more\ncomplex than that - take away the religious element, and you'd still\nhave the powerful motives of revenge and misguided patriotism.  You\nknow, when most Catholics and Protestants worldwide say 'stop the \nkilling', one might listen to that, especially when you claim not\nto read minds.\n#\n#\n#|> Also, the murders ensuing from the fatwa on Mr. Rushdie, the Inquisitions,\n#|> and the many religous wars.\n#\n#What's so special about these exceptions?

[ Deletia; in case anybody hadn't noticed, Frank and I are debating\n  "objective morality", and seemingly hitting semantics. ]\n\n\n      It may be that, being a non-native English-speaker, I've\nmisunderstood your usage of "objective", and tried to debate something\nyou don't assert; my apologies. I'm at a loss to imagine what you really\ndo mean, though.\n\n\n      Wrong point. The age of the universe has no direct effect on\nhumanity's sticking power, in the way the moral system of a society can\nhave.\n\n      I'm saying the Universe has a "real age", because I see evidence\nfor it; cosmology, astronomy and so on. I say this age is independent of\npeople's opinions of it, because I know different people have a lot of\ndifferent opinions in the matter, yet empirical tests consistently seem\nto give roughly the same results.\n\n\n      I can't see how it does that. Put a creationist to the task of\nperforming the tests and calculations, see to it (s)he makes no blatant\nerrors in measuring or calculating, and the result of the test will be\nthe same.\n\n\n      Because logically consistent empirical tests contradict their\nopinion. If those tests were just my opinion, then their own tests\n(which would then be their opinion) would contradict mine, even if we\nconducted said tests in identical manner, no? They don't, which I take\nas showing these tests have some validity beyond our opinion of them.\n\n\n      Map the activity of nerves and neural activity, if you mean\nphysical pain. You have a sharp point, I'll give you that; but you still\nhaven't given me a way to quantify morality.\n\n\n      We agree. Hypotheses, however, can change; I hold that there is no\n"ultimate hypothesis of morality" towards which these changes could\ngravitate, but that they could be changed in any way imaginable,\nproducing different results suitable for different tasks or purposes.\n\n\n      "Better" and "worse" are (almost?) always defined in the context\nof a moral system. Your prediction will _always_ be correct, *within*\n*that* *moral* *system*. What you need now is an objective definition of\n"good" and "bad"; I wish you luck.\n\n\n      Isn't that what _you're_ doing, when assuming an "objectively\nreal" morality? Besides, what _exactly_ is provably wrong with my\nstatement?\n\n\n      Claiming there is no objective morality is suddenly a positive\nclaim? Besides, I think I _can_ lend some credence to my claim; ponder\ndifferent individuals, both fully functional as human beings and members\nof society, but yet with wildly different moral codes. If morality was\n"objective", at least one should be way off base, but yet hir\n'incorrect' morality seems to function fine. How come?\n\n      As for producing these individuals, it might be easiest to pick\nthem from different societies; say, an islamic one and some polynesian\nmatrilineal system, for example (if such still exist).\n\n[ deletia - testing for footballs on desks ]\n\n\n      One thing is "good" under some circumstances, because we wish to\nachieve some goal, for some reason. Other times we wish to do something\nelse, and that thing is no longer so clearly "good" at all.\n\n      Some things are hard to make "good", because we'd seldom if ever\nwish to achieve the sort of goal mass murder would lead one into. Still,\nthe Aztecs were doing fine until the Spaniards wiped them out.\n\n      I almost always know what "good" means; sometimes I even know why.\nI never claim this "good" is thereby fixed in stone, immutable.\n\n[...]\n\n      Yes, me too, and I've tried a thing or two down that line; it\ndoesn't look good for objective values to me at all.
Well I agree with you in the sense that they have no "moral" right to inflict\nthese rules, but there is one thing I might add: at the very least, almost\neverybody wants to avoid pain, and if that means sacrificing some stuff for a\nherd morality, then so be it.  \n\n\nRight, and since they grew up and learned around us, they have some idea of our\nright and wrong, which I think must, in part, be incorporated.

[ . . .]\n\nI am a relativist who would like to answer your question, but the way you\nphrase the question makes it unanswerable.  The concepts of "right"\nand "wrong" (or "correct/incorrect" or "true/false") belong to the\ndomain of epistemological rather than moral questions.  It makes no\nsense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong, although it is\nlegitimate to ask if it is good (or better than another position).\n\nLet me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives\nof epistemology and ethics:  perception and motivation, respectively.\nOne can certainly ask if a percept is "right" (correct, true,\nveridical) or "wrong" (incorrect, false, illusory).  But it makes little\nsense to ask if a motive is true or false.  On the other hand, it is\nstrange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil, but one can\ncertainly ask that question about motives.\n\nTherefore, your suggested answers (a)-(c) simply can't be considered:\nthey assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment.\n\nNow the problem with (d) is that it is double-barrelled:  I agree with\nthe first part (that the "rightness" of a moral position is a\nmeaningless question), for the reasons stated above.  But that is\nirrelevant to the alleged implication (not an implication at all) that\none cannot feel peace is better than war.  I certainly can make\nvalue judgments (bad, better, best) without asserting the "correctness"\nof the position.\n\nSorry for the lengthy dismissal of (a)-(d).  My short (e) answer is\nthat when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue,\nneither is right (correct) or wrong (incorrect).  They simply hold\ndifferent moral values (feelings).

From _Free Inquiry_, Winter 83/84,  the following is an\nintroduction to the article "Joseph Smith and the Book of\nMormon", by George D. Smith.  The introduction is written by\nPaul Kurtz. \n\n	Mormonism -- the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\n	-- claims a worldwide membership 5.2 million.  It is one of\n	the world's fastest growing religions, with as many as\n	200,000 new converst in 1982 alone.  Because of the church's\n	aggressive missionary program, covering more than one\n	hundred countries, it is spreading even to third world\n	countries.\n	\n	Mormonism is both puritanical in moral outlook and\n	evangelical in preachment.  The church is run along strict\n	authoritarian lines.  Led by a president, who allegedly\n	receives revelations directly form God, and a group of\n	twelve apostles who attempt to maintain orthodoxy in belief\n	and practice, the church is opposed to abortion,\n	pornography, sexual freedom, women's rights, and other, in\n	its view, immoral influences of secular society, and it\n	forbids the use of tobacco, alcohol, coffee, and tea.\n	\n	Centered in Salt Lake City, the church is extremely wealthy\n	and politically powerful in Utal and many other western\n	states.  Among well-know present-day Mormons are Ezra Taft\n	Benson (former secretary of agriculture), the Osmond family,\n	the Mariotts of the hotel empire, and a score of high-placed\n	government officials.\n	\n	The Mormon church was founded in western New York in 1830 by\n	Joseph Smith who claimed that by divine revelation be had\n	found gold plates containing hieroglyphics buried on a hill\n	and that with the help of visits from the angel Moroni he\n	had been able to translate the writing into the _Book of\n	Mormon_, the basis of Mormon belief.  This book, written "by\n	the commandment of God," claims that the ancient Hebrews\n	settled in America about 600 B.C.E. and were the ancestors\n	of the American Indians.  Mormons believe that those who\n	have been baptized in the "true church" will be reunited\n	after death and that deceased non-Mormon family members can\n	be baptized by proxy and thus join their relatives in the\n	hereafter.  Because of these beliefs, Mormons have been\n	considered outcasts by mainline Christian denominations and\n	as heretics by religious fundamentalists.\n	\n	Joseph Smith was a controversial figure in his day -- he was\n	both worshiped as a saint and denounced as a fraud.  Because\n	of persecution he led his band of loyal followers from\n	Palmyra, New York, westward to Ohio and then to Illinois,\n	where in 1844 he was shot to death by an agry mob.  Brigham\n	Young, who reportedly had as many as eighty wives, took over\n	the leadership of the church and led the Mormons further\n	westward, to found the new Zion in Salt Lake City. \n	Following the teachings of Joseph Smith in the practice of\n	polygamy was perhaps the Mormons most controversial practice\n	in nineteenth-century America.\n	\n	While other religions go back many centuries --\n	Muhammadanism, 1200 years; Christianity, 2000; and Judaism,\n	3000 -- and attempts to examine their beginnings are\n	difficult, extensive historical investigation of Mormon\n	roots is possible.  Some Mormons are willing to examine this\n	history objectively, bu others maintain that such scrutiny\n	is dangerous to the faith.\n	\n	In the following pages, _Free Inquiry_ presents two articles\n	about the Mormon church.  First, George D. Smith, a lifelong\n	member of the church, provides a detailed critical\n	examination of Joseph Smith and his claim the the _Book of\n	Mormon_ was divinely revealed.  Second, we present a portion\n	of an interview with philosopher Sterling McMurrin, also a\n	Mormon since birth, who questions the treatment of the\n	history of the church by Mormon authorities. -- Paul Kurtz\n	\n\nThe article itself is super.

Stuff deleted\n\nI reiterate that I would agree with you that there is little\njustification for the punishment of apostasy in the Qur'an.\nIn Islamic history, as well, apostasy has rarely been punished. \nBelief is considered a matter of conscience and since there\nis to be no compulsion in the matter of belief, apostates have\nbeen generally left to believe or not believe as they will.\n\nHowever, when an apostate makes attacks upon "God and\nHis Messenger" the situation changes. Now the charge of\napostasy may be complicated with other charges - perhaps \ncharges of sedition, treason, spying, etc. If the person \nmakes a public issue of their apostasy or mounts public\nattacks (as opposed to arguement) against Islam, the\nsituation is likewise complicated. If the person spreads\nslander or broadcasts falsehoods, again the situation\nchanges. The punishments vary according to the situation\nthe apostate is in. Anyhow, the charge of aggravated\napostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in Rushdie's case.\n\nThere is a distinction in the Qur'an between a formal war situation\nand being in the situation where someone unilaterally\nwages war (by their actions), creates disorder, makes mischief,etc. \nagainst the Muslims and creates a situation that results in harm \nto Muslims. Here, a small group or even a single individual could\nbe said to be engaged in such a practise. In other words, there is\na clear difference between a formal war situation (where two\nclearly defined parties wage war, conclude treaties, exchange\nprisoners, etc.), and dealing with attacks that come from isolated\nindividuals or groups against Islam. It is the second situation, \nthe unilateral attack and the spreading of "fasad" that \nwould apply in the case of Rushdie.\n\nThe matter of Rushdie is not a simple matter of banning an \noffensive book (banning the book is secondary) -\na full set of circumstances following the publication of\nthe book come into play as well, including the deaths of many\nMuslims, and Rushdie's (and his publishers) Media games.\n\n\n\n\nI am not sure which hadith you are referring to above. I believe\nthat one of the Qur'anic verses on which the fatwa is based is 5:33.\nEvery verse in the Qur'an has a corresponding "circumstance of\nrevelation" but in no way is the understanding (the tafsir) of the\nverse restricted solely to the particular historical circumstance\nin which it was revealed. If this was the case then we could say\nthat all the laws and regulations that were revealed when the\nMuslims were NOT involved in conflict, should be suspended when\nthey were at war. The logic does not follow. In complex, real-life\nsituations, there may be many verses and many hadiths which can\nall be related to a single, complicated situation. The internal\nrelationships between these verses may be quite complex, such that\narriving at an understanding of how the verses interlock and how\neach applies to the particular situation can be quite a demanding task.\nIt is not necessarily a simple "this or that" process. There may\nbe many parameters involved, there may be a larger context in\nwhich a particular situation should be viewed. All these matters\nimpinge on the situation.\n\nIn other words there is a great deal involved in deciphering the Qur'an.\nThe Qur'an asks us to reflect on its verses, but this reflection must\nentail more than simply reading a verse and its corresponding hadith.\nIf the reflection is for the sake of increasing personal piety, then each\nperson has his own level of understanding and there is no harm in that.\nHowever, if the reflection is in order to decide matters that pertain to\nthe\nState, to the gestation of laws and rulings, to the gestation of society,\nthe dispensing of justice, the guidance of the community, then there \nare certain minimum requirements of understanding that one \nshould achieve. Jaffar Ibn Muhammad as-Sadiq(a.s.) relates some of \nthese requirements, as taught by the Prophet(S.A.), in a hadith:\n\n"...he who does not distinguish in the Book of Allah the abrogating\nverse from the abrogated one, and a specific one from a general one,\nand a decisive from an ambiguous; and does not differentiate between\na permission and an obligation, and does not recognize a verse of\nMeccan period from a Medinite one, and does not know the circumstances \nof revelation, and does not understand the technical words of\nthe Qur'an (whether simple or compound); and does not comprehend the\nknowledge of decree and measure, and is ignorant of advancing and\ndelaying (in its verses); and does not distinguish the clear from\nthe deep, nor the manifest from the esoteric, nor the beginning\nfrom the termination; and is unaware of the question and the answer,\nthe disjoining and the joining, and the exceptions and the all-inclusive,\nand is ignorant of an adjective of a preceding noun that explains the\nsubsequent one; and is unaware of the emphasized subject and the\ndetailed one, the obligatory laws and the permissions, the places of the\nduties and rules, and the meaning of the lawful and the unlawful; and\ndoes not know the joined words, and the words that are related to those\ncoming before them, or after them - then such a man does not know\nthe Qur'an; nor is he among the people of the Qur'an....".\n\nBased on these and other hadiths, and in accordance with many Qur'anic\nverses ("Why should not a company from every group remain behind \nto gain profound understanding (tafaqquh) in religion and to warn \npeople when they return to them, so that they may beware." (9:122)),\na science of jurisprudence arose. The requirements\nfor a person to be considered a mujtahid (one who can pronounce on\nmatters of law and religion) are many. I've listed a few major \ndivisions below - there are, of course, many subdivisions within these\nheadings.\n\n- Knowledge of Arabic (syntax, conjugation, roots, semantics, oratory).\n- Knowledge of tafsir and principles of tafsir.\n- Logic (mantiq)\n- A knowledge of Hadiths\n- A knowledge of transmitters (rijal)\n- Knowledge of the principles of juriprudence (Qur'an, Sunnah, Consensus,\nReasoning)\n\nThe study of Qur'an and sunnah for purposes of law involves:\n- discussion of imperatives (awamir)\n- discussion of negative imperatives (nawahi)\n- discussion of generalities and particularities (aam wa khas)\n- discussion of unconditional and conditional\n- discussion of tacit meanings\n- discussion of the abstract and the clear\n- discussion of the abrogator and the abrogated\n\nThe principles of Application of the law involves:\n- principles of exemption\n- principles of precaution\n- principles of option\n- principles of mastery\n\nThe jurisprudent is bound to go through a very rigorous process\nin pronouncing judgement on a given situation. It is not a matter\nof looking at one verse and one hadith. \n\nNow no one should blindly follow anyone, but there is a difference\nbetween blind following and acceding to the opinion of someone who is\nclearly more knowledgeable and more qualified than oneself. There is the\n"The fuqaha (religious scholars) are the trustees of the Prophet, as \nlong as they do not concern themselves with the illicit desires, pleasures,\nand wealth of this world." The Prophet (S.A.) was asked: "O Messenger\nof God! How may we know if they so concern themselves?" He (S.A.) replied:\n"By seeing whether they follow the ruling power. If they do that, fear for\nyour religion and shun them." I do not yet know enough about the Imams\nof the four Sunni madhabs to comment on how this hadith applies\nto them or to the contemporary scholars who base themselves upon them.\n\nThe Prophet also refered to the fuqaha as "The fortress of Islam". My only\npoint is to make it clear that arriving at a legal judgement calls into\nplay a certain amount of expertise - the specifics of this expertise is \ndelineated in the Qur'an and hadith. Those who acquire this expertise\nare praised in both the Qur'an and hadith - those who without the requisite\nknowledge pronounce on matters that affect society, state, and religion \nare cautioned.\n\nThe only reason I said anything at all about the Rushdie affair in this\ngroup, is because the whole basis for the discussion of the fatwa (that is,\napostasy), was wrong. When one discusses something they should at least\nbase their discussion on fact. Secondly, Khomeini was condemned as a\nheretic\nbecause he supposedly claimed to be infallible - another instance of\ncreating a straw man and then beating him.\n\n\nI agree that we should move the discussion to another newsgroup.\nUnfortunately,\nI do not have any access to email, so private discussion or a moderated\ngroup\nis out of the question (I cannot post to a moderated group like\nsoc.religion.islam. How about soc.culture.arabic or talk.religion.misc?
Here's a suggestion for the logical argument FAQ.  I don't think it's covered,\nthough the fallacy probably has a better name than the one I used:  How about\nit, mathew?\n\nINCONSISTENCY AND COUNTEREXAMPLE\n\nThis occurs when one party points out that some source of information takes\nstand A, which is inconsistent with B.  There are two variations in which B is\neither a mutually-agreed-on premise or else a stand elsewhere from the same\nsource.  The second party fallaciously responds by saying "see, the source\nreally does say B, it's right here!"; this reply does not refute the allegation\nof inconsistency because it does not show that the source _only_ says B.\n\nExample of the first type: "The Koran says unbelievers should be treated in\nthese ways.  We can both agree these are immoral."  "The Koran clearly says in\nthis other passage that unbelievers are not to be treated that way."\n\nExample of the second type: "There are two Biblical creation stories."  "You're\nwrong, since the Bible clearly describes the creation as [description]."\n--\n"On the first day after Christmas my truelove served to me...

Could an atheist accept a usage in which religious literature or\ntradition is viewed in a metaphorical way?  Of course: this is\nessentially what we do with Homer, or with other concepts such as\nfate, luck, free will ;-)...  However, there remains the question of\nwhether the religious literature of -- say -- Christianity is a\nparticularly *good* set of metaphors for the world today.  It's also\nentirely unclear, and to me quite unlikely, that one could take a\ncontemporary religion like that and divorce the metaphoric potential\nfrom the literalism and absolutism it carries now in many cases.

Exactly.  Although this may be a dissapointing answer, there has to be an\ninterplay of the two.  Personal Ethos and Societal Morality.  A person's\nself-generated/learned set of beliefs are usually expressed on a purely\nmental/verbal level, and don't usually find expression in society except in an\nimpure (not in the sense of bad :) ) state.  Sometimes this has to be so.\n\n\nAlso, what if one feels oneself to be part of more than one society, in a very\nreal sense?  To use the obvious example, there is a political society, and a\nracial society, and a gender society, and sometimes they do not always agree on\nevery issue...\n\n\n\nYes.  Perhaps with an infamous "do what you want so long as it doesn't hurt\nothers?"  The problem with this is that it is merely saying what you CAN do: it\nis not a morality in that it doesn't propound any specifically preferred\nbehaviours.\n\n\nI'll add a hearty "me two".  However, one could just as well say just because\ncertain actions are moral does not make them legal: one still doesn't really\nget an impression of which one is truly "right".\n\n\n\n\nbest regards,
Yes, each is a form of the other.\n\nCharley an anarchist?  No, just true words being spoken in jest.
(Deletion)\n(rest deleted)\n \nThat's a fallacy, and it is not the first time it is pointed out.\nFor one, you have never given a set of morals people agree upon. Unlike\na football. Further, you conveniently ignore here that there are\nmany who would not agree on tghe morality of something. The analogy\ndoes not hold.\n \nOne can expect sufficiently many people to agree on its being a football,\nwhile YOU have to give the evidence that only vanishing number disagrees\nwith a set of morals YOU have to give.\n \nFurther, the above is evidence, not proof. Proof would evolve out of testing\nyour theory of absolute morals against competing theories.
Sounds like more of the same.  Gods were used to describe almost\neverything in the past.  As we come to understand the underpinnings of\nmore and more, the less we credit to a god.  Now, the not-so-well\nunderstood elements (at least by the author) includes quarks and tectonic\ndrift.  I guess that's better than describing the perceived patterns of\nstars in the sky as heroes being immortalized by the gods.\n\nKinda sounds like old-earth creation--It seems that life did, indeed, evolve\nfrom a common ancestor.  What caused that initial common ancestor?\n\nAre we going to hear another debate on causeless events? ;-)
no its not.\n\nits due to the fact that there are two issues here: Religion and religion.\n\nreligion is personal belief system.\nReligion is a memetic virus.\n\npeople loudly proclaiming their beliefs are crossing the border from\nreligion -> Religion.  people that want to "save" others are firmly\nentrenched in Religion ("memoids").\n\nrule #1 of not practicing Religion is to shut the fuck up, unless\nyou discuss it politely.  this means that the motive behind the conversation\nis not only your self-gratifying wish to spread the word.  \n\nreligion is something that ultimately comes from within a person, and\nreflects their value judgements.  Religion is something that is\ncontracted from others and does not reflect the persons value judgements\n(other than perhaps "i think i'll be brainwashed today").\n\nReligion is a drug...\n\ni believe you can discuss religion.  however, the post that started this\noff was not intented as discussion, it was more a proclamation of\nsomeones Religion.
[reply to frank@D012S658.uucp (Frank O'Dwyer)]\n \n \n \nIf the Good is undefined (undefinable?) but you require of everyone that\nthey know innately what is right, you are back to subjectivism.\n \n \nDitto here.  An evaluative statement implies a value judgement on the\npart of the person making it.\n \n \nPretty perceptive, that Prof. Flew.\n \n \n \nPlease explain how this helps.  I don't see your argument.\n \n \n \nThis makes no sense either.  Flew is arguing that this is where the\nobjectivist winds up, not the subjectivist.  Furthermore, the nihilists\nbelieved in nothing *except* science, materialism, revolution, and the\nPeople.\n \n \n \nAnd also not the position of the subjectivist, as has been pointed out\nto you already by others.  Ditch the strawman, already, and see my reply\nto Mike Cobb's root message in the thread Societal Basis for Morality.
Consider special relativity.  It hasn't be proved, nor has it been\ndisproved.  No one has a proof one way or the other, but many people\nare interested in it!\n \nI've satisfied myself that nothing could indicate absolutely the\nexistence of God one way or the other.  The two possibilities\nare supernaturalism and naturalism.  Of course no set of circumstances can\nbe inconsistent with supernaturalism, but similarly, no set of circumstances\ncan be inconsistent with naturalism.  In naturalism, any phenomenon that\ncould be described as God is considered part of the natural world, to\nbe studied as any other natural phenomenon (gravity, for instance).  \nFor example, if a loud ``godlike'' voice vociferously announced, ``I\nam God, I exist, and I will prove it by reversing the force of gravity,''\nand if then gravity did indeed reverse, a naturalist (probably a scientist)\nwould say, ``Boy, we sure didn't understand gravity as well as we\nthought we did, and that loud voice is something new.  Perhaps we\ndidn't understand thunder as well as we thought we did either.''\n\n\nI'm sure glad you don't know where I live, since you don't seem\nto realize it is impossible for you to distinguish between voices\nin your head, and God's voice.\n\n\nYou seem to have missed my point.  Even if Jim Jones and David Koresh\nwere not religious people, my point remains that faith and dogma\nare dangerous, and religion encourages them.  Jim Jones and David Koresh\nalso encouraged them.  My point does not rely on Jim Jones and David\nKoresh being religious.

I have never said that only humans are the only beings which are\nsufficiently sentient to have intentions.   In fact, I have explicitly\nsaid that I am perfectly happy to consider that some animals *are*\ncapable of forming intentions.\n\nWhat I am objecting to is considering programmed or instinctive\nbehaviour to have moral significance, since, it seems to me, \nsuch behaviour does *not* involve intention.\n\n\nThat's not the point.   The point is whether the implementor thinks\n*at all*.    The issue is not whether thinking produces opinion A\nor opinion B, but whether thinking takes place, period.\n\n\nSince humans are part of nature, are not all human actions "natural".\n\nOr perhaps you're going to throw in a definition of "natural" that\nwill allow us to describe some actions as "natural" and some as \n"not natural".   If so, what is the definition?\n\n\n\nSure they do, as multiple posters have show you.   Sharks, for example,\neat wounded sharks.   I've personally seen cats eat their newborn.\n\nAre you in some kind of denial?   People give you example after example,\nand you go off the air for a week, and then pop up claiming that it \nnever happened.    It's very strange.\n\n\nSee what I mean.   Here we go again.   What do we have to do: write\nup a tailor-made FAQ just for Mr Schneider?
Sadly understandable...\n\n\nYes.\n\nTo be fair, you should really qualify this as semitic-western religions, but\nyou basically go ahead and do this later on anyway.\n\n\nAgain, this should really be evaluated at a personal level.  For example, there\nwas only one Jesus (presumably), and he probably didn't say all that many\nthings, and yet (seemingly) billions and billions of Christian sects have\narisen.  Perhaps there is one that is totally dedicated to rationalism and\nbelieves in Christ as in pantheism.  It would seem to go against the Bible, but\nit is amazing what people come up with under the guise of "personal\ninterpretation".\n\n\nThis is a good point.  We have here the quintessential Christian: he sets up a\nsystem of values/beliefs for himself, which work very well, and every\nevent/experience is understandable and deablable within the framework of this\nsystem.  However, we also have an individual who has the inability (at least\nnot without some difficulty) to change, which is important, because the problem\nwith such a system is the same as with any system: one cannot be open minded to\nthe point of "testing hypotheses" against the basic premise of the system\nwithout destroying whatever faith is invested therein, unless of course, all\nthe tests fail.  In other words, the *fairer* way would be to test and evaluate\nmoralities without the bias/responsibility of losing/retaining a system.\n\n\nInteresting, but again, when it seems to basically boil down to individual\nnuances (although not always, I will admit, and probably it is the\nmass-oriented divisions which are the most appalling), it becomes irrelevant,\nunfortunately.\n\n\nGranted\n\n\nIn which case the people become the bullets, and the religion, as the gun,\nmerely offers them a way to more adequately do some harm with themselves, if I\nmay be so bold as to extend your similie?\n\n\nAlso understandable... ;)\n\n-- \n\nbest regards,
Not by any standard of history I've seen. Care to back this up, sans the\nlies apologists are so fond of?\n\n\nNot really. Most of the prophesies aren't even prophesies. They're prayers\nand comments taken from the Torah quite out of context. Seems Xians started\nlying right from the beginning.\n\n\nMy we're an arrogant ass, aren't we?\n\n\nYou're wrong to think we haven't. The trust was in something that doesn't\nexist.\n\n\nI'm still willing to die for what I believe and don't believe. So were the\nloonies in Waco. So what? \n\nBesides, the point's not to die for what one believes in. The point's to\nmake that other sorry son-of-a-bitch to die for what *he* believes in!   :)\n\nDoesn't anyone else here get tired of these cretins' tirades?\n\nPeter the Damed, and damned proud of it!
I have already made the clear claim that\n\nDon't mind my saying this but the best example of obfuscation is to\ncondemn without having even your most basic facts straight.

[ ... my stuff deleted ... ]\n\n\nBill, you seem to have erroneously assumed that this board has as its\nsole purpose the validation of atheism.  It doesn't.  This board is\nused to discuss atheism as a philosophy, to share posters' experiences\nregarding atheism, to debunk various theisms and theism as a whole, to\nshare resources relating to atheism, and even to socialize with others\nwith similar views.  And of course with the number of theists who come\nhere to preach, it is also used to argue the case for atheism. \n\n\n\nIf you want to accuse people of lying, please do so directly.  The\nphrase "deliberately mistaken" is rather oxymoronic.\n\n \n\nThe two forms of theism most often discussed here these days are\nChristianity and Islam.  Both of these claim to make their followers\ninto good people, and claim that much of benefit to humanity has been\naccomplished through their faiths.  IMHO they are right.  The American\nFriends Service Committee (Quaker), Catholic Relief Services, Bread\nFor The World, Salvation Army soup kitchens, and Mother Theresa spring\nto mind.  (Can someone with more knowledge of Islam supply the names\nof some analagous Islamic groups?)  \n\nWhen Mother Theresa claims that her work is an outgrowth of her\nChristianity, I believe her.  Her form of theism ascribes to her deity\nsuch a benevolence toward humanity that it would be wrong not to care\nfor those in need.  The point is that such a philosophy does have the\npower to change the behavior of individuals;  if it is widespread\nenough, it can change societies.\n\nThe same works for the horrors of history.  To claim that Christianity\nhad little to do with the Crusades or the Inquisition is to deny the\nawesome power that comes from faith in an absolute.  What it seems you\nare doing twisting the reasonable statement that religion was never\nthe solitary cause of any evil into the unreasonable statement that\nreligion has had no evil impacts on history.  That is absurd.
Great start.  I realize immediately that you are not interested\nin discussion and are going to thump your babble at me.  I would\nmuch prefer an answer from Ms Healy, who seems to have a\nreasonable and reasoned approach to things.  Say, aren't you the\ncreationist guy who made a lot of silly statements about\nevolution some time ago?\n\n\nDuh, gee, then we must be talking Christian mythology now.  I\nwas hoping to discuss something with a reasonable, logical\nperson, but all you seem to have for your side is a repetition\nof the same boring mythology I've seen a thousand times before.\nI am deleting the rest of your remarks, unless I spot something\nthat approaches an answer, because they are merely a repetition\nof some uninteresting doctrine or other and contain no thought\nat all.\n\n[..]\n\nI have to congratulate you, though, Bill.  You wouldn't\nknow a logical argument if it bit you on the balls.  Such\na persistent lack of function in the face of repeated\nattempts to assist you in learning (which I have seen\nin this forum and others in the past) speaks of a talent\nthat goes well beyond my own, meager abilities.  I just don't\nseem to have that capacity for ignoring outside influences.
existance.  \n\n\n***************************************************************************\n	I just thought it necessary to help defend the point that Jesus \nexisted.  Guys: Jesus existed.  If he didnt, then you have to say that \nSocrates didnt exist cuz he, like Jesus, has nothing from his hands that \nhave survived.  Only Plato and others record his existance.  Many others \nrecord Jesus' existance, including the Babylonian Talmud.  Sorry guys, the \nargument that Jesus may not have existed is a dead point now.

Society is the collection of individuals which will fall under self-defined\nrules.  In terms of UN decisions all the sets of peoples who are represented\nat the UN are considered part of that society. If we then look at US federal\nlaws provided by representatives of purely US citizens then the society for\nthat case would be the citizens of the US and so on.\n\n\n"Acceptable" are those behaviours which are either legislated for the\nsociety by representatives of that society or those behaviours which are\nnon-verbally and, in effect, non-consciously, such as picking your nose on\nthe Oprah Winfrey show, no-one does it, but there is no explicit law against\ndoing it. In many cases there are is no definition of whether or not a\nbehaviour is "acceptable", but one can deduce these behaviours by\nobservation.\n\n\n\nIn an increasingly litigation mad society, this trap is becoming exceedingly\ndifficult to avoid. With the infusion and strengthening of ethnic cultures\nin American (and Australian, to bring in my local perspective) culture the\nboundaries of acceptable behaviour are ever widening and legislation may\neventually become the definition of moral behaviour. For instance, some\ncultures' dominant religion call for live sacrifice of domesticated animals.\nMost fundamental christians would find this practice abhorrent. However, is\nit moral, according to the multicultural american society? This kind of\nproblem may only be definable by legislation. \n\nObviously within any society there will be differences in opinion in what is\nacceptable behaviour or not, and much of this will be due to different\nenvironmental circumstances rather than merely different opinions.  \n\nOne thing is for sure, there is no universal moral code which will suit all\ncultures in all situations.  There may, however, be some globally accepted\nmores which can be agreed upon and instantiated as a globally enforcable\nconcept. The majority of mores will not be common until all peoples upon\nthis earth are living in a similar environment (if that ever happens).

marshall@csugrad.cs.vt.edu (Kevin Marshall) <1r2eba$hsq@csugrad.cs.vt.edu>\n\nFaith and dogma are dangerous because they cause people to act on\nfaith alone, which by its nature is without justification.  That\nis what I mean by the word ``faith'': belief without justification, or\nbelief with arbitrary justification, or with emotional (irrational)\njustification.\n\nFor example, when someone says that God exists, that they don't know\nwhy they believe God exists, they can just feel it, that's faith.\n\nDogma is bad because it precludes positive change in belief based\non new information, or increased mental faculty.\n\nFaith and dogma are irrational.  The faith and dogma part of any religion\nare responsible for the irrationality of the individuals.  I claim that\nfaith and dogma are the quintessential part of any religion.  If that\nmakes (the much overused in this context) Buddism a philosophy rather\nthan a religion, I can live with that.  Science is not a religion,\nbecause there is no faith nor dogma.\n\nHave you noticed that philosophers tend to be atheists?  If a philosopher\nis not an atheist, s/he tends to be called a theologian.\n\nA Christian tends to consider Christianity sacred.  Christianity is\na special set of beliefs, sanctioned by God himself, and therefore,\nto conceive of changing those beliefs is to question the existence\nof That Being Who Makes No Mistakes.  Faith comes into play.  Dogma\ncomes into play.  ``The lord works in mysterious ways'' is an example\nof faith being used to reconcile evidence that the beliefs are flawed.\nSure, interpretations of what ``God said'' are changed to satisfy the\nneeds of society, but when God says something, that's it.  It was said,\nand that's that.  Since God said it, it is unflawed, even if the\ninterpretations are flawed.\n\nScience, (as would be practiced by atheists) in contrast, has a\nBUILT IN defence against faith and dogma.\nA scientist holds sacred the idea that beliefs should change to\nsuit whatever is the best information available at the time, AND,\n*AND*, ****AND***, a scientist understands that any current beliefs\nare deficient in some way.  The goal is to keep improving\nthe beliefs.  The goal is to keep changing the beliefs to reflect\nthe best information currently available.  That's the only rational\nthing to do.  That's good philosophy.\n\nCan you see the difference?  Science views beliefs as being flawed,\nand new information can be obtained to improve them.  (How many\nscientists would claim to have complete and perfect understanding\nof everything?  None---it would put them out of a job!)  Religion\nviews its beliefs as being perfect, and the interpretations of\nthose beliefs must be changed as new information is acquired which\nconflicts with them.\n\nIt's easier for someone to kill a person when s/he doesn't require\na good rational justification of the killing.  I don't consider\n``he's Jewish'', or ``he was born of Jewish parents'', or\n``this document says he's Jewish'' to be good rational justification.\n\n\nClinton and the FBI would love for you to convince them of this.\nIt would save the US taxpayer a lot of money if you could.

Some people might think it takes faith to be an atheist... but faith in\nwhat?  Does it take some kind of faith to say that the Great Invisible Pink\nUnicorn does not exist?  Does it take some kind of faith to say that Santa\nClaus does not exist?  If it does (and it may for some people I suppose) it\ncertainly isn't as big a leap of faith to say that these things (and god)\nDO exist.

I would not be too quick to say that they are almost certainly untrue.\nEven strong minded people may fall back on childhood indoctrination,\ngrasp at straws, or do other strange things when faced with extreme\nsuffering, not to mention physiological problems which may lead to\ndiminished mental capacity.\n\nAt the risk of restarting an old argument and accusations of appeal to\nauthority I remind readers of what I posted a while back as a kind of\nobituary for the late atheist Dr. Albert Sabin. In an old interview\nrebroadcast on public radio just after his death he told about a time\na few years before when he was stricken with a very serious illness.\nHe admitted to having cried out to God while critically ill and on a\nrespirator. As it turned out he recovered and lived several more years.\nAfter his recovery he attributed this to early indoctrination. Don't say\nit couldn't happen to you, or that it hasn't happened to others, even if\nyou are one of the few people who have experienced things like this.\nPeople are different. I admire Dr. Sabin for admitting his human weakness\nin that instance. I would not think less of Asimov for similar weakness.\n\nNevertheless I agree that these reports are unsubstantiated and may\nwell be untrue. In any case they are not evidence for anything besides\nthe power of early indoctrination and human frailty.

Perhaps you have a different understanding of what "physics" is.  If we\ncan't measure anything objectively, then the answers we get from physics\naren't objective either.  That's what I mean when I say there's no objective\nphysics.\n\nSure, we can all agree that (say) F = GMm/r^2, but that's maths.  It's only\nphysics when you relate it to the real world, and if we can't do that\nobjectively, we're stuck.  (Of course, this displays my blatant bias towards\napplied science; but even theoretical physics gets applied to models of real\nworld situations, based on real world observations.)\n\n\nIt's an axiom that it's invariant.  But if the two of us measure it, we'll\nget different answers.  Yes, we call that experimental error, but it's not\nreally "error" in the conventional sense; in fact, if you don't get any,\nthat's an error :-)\n\nYou could argue that the value of c is "objective, to within +/- <some\nvalue>".

No, that's the point of evolution, not the point of "natural\nmorality".   Unless, of course, as I have suggested several\ntimes already, "natural morality" is just a renaming.\n\n\nBut your "yes?" is actually stronger than this.    You are\nagreeing that "every time an organism evolves cooperative \nbehaviour" you are going to call it a "natural morality."\n\n\nBee dance is a naturally developed piece of cooperative behaviour.

: Very true (length of time for discussions on creationism vs evolutionism). \n: Atheists and Christians have been debating since ?? and still debate with \n: unabated passion 8-).\n\nMike,\n\nI've seen referrences to "Creation vs Evolution" several times in a.a\nand I have question. Is either point of view derived from direct\nobservation; can either be scientific? I wonder if the whole\ncontroversy is more concerned with the consequences of the "Truth"\nrather than the truth itself. \nBoth sides seem to hold to a philosophical outcome, and I can't help\nwondering which came first. As I've pointed out elsewhere, my view of\nhuman nature makes me believe that there is no way of knowing\nanyhthing objectively - all knowledge is inherently subjective. So, in\nthe context of a.a, would you take a stand based on what you actually\nknow to be true or on what you want to be true and how can you tell\nthe difference?
Kent Sandvik and Jon Livesey made essentially the same response, so this\ntime Kent's article gets the reply:\n\n\nThis begs the question of whether it ever "started"-- perhaps because\naccuracy was always an intention.\n\n\nIt makes little difference if you have eyewitnesses or people one step away\n(reporters, if you will).  As I said earlier, the "telephone" metaphor is\ninnately bad, because the purpose of a game of telephone is contrary to the\naims of writing these sorts of texts.  (Also, I would point out that, by the\nstandards generally asserted in this group, the distinction between\neyewitnesses and others is hollow, since nobody can be shown to be an\neyewitness, or indeed, even shown to be the author of the text.)\n\nThere is no evidence that the "original" texts of either the OT or the NT\nare largely lost over time in a sea of errors, "corrections", additions and\ndeletions.  In the case of the NT, the evidence is strongly in the other\ndirection: the Textus R. and the Nestle-Aland text do not differ on more\nthan a low level of significance.  It is reasonable to assume a similar\nsituation for the OT, based on the NT as a model.
What?  Absolutely not.  No way.  Asimov was a lifelong atheist, and\nsaid so many times, right until his death.  Judging from the many\nstories he told about his own life, he felt culturally closest to\nJudaism, which makes sense. He was born Jewish.
: The willingness of true believers\n: to die for their belief, be it in Jesus or Jim Jones, is\n: well-documented, so martyrdom in and of itself says little.\n\nIt does say something about the depth of their belief.  Religion has\nboth deluded believers and con men.  The difference is often how far\nthey will follow their beliefs.\n\nI have no first hand, or even second hand, knowledge of how the \noriginal apostles died.  If they began a myth in hopes of exploiting\nit for profit, and followed that myth to the death, that would be\ninconsistent.  Real con men would bail out when it was obvious it would \nlead to discomfort, pain and death.

Another one rescued from the bit bucket...\n\nOver the years the furor over this book has been discussed on a.a. and\nelsewhere on the net.  Generally, the discussion comes down to the\ncontention on the one hand that TSV contains such blood libel against\nIslam as to merit, if not death, than at least banning and probably\nsome sort of punishment; and on the other that Rushdie, particularly\nas a non-muslim in a Western country, had every right to write and\npublish whatever he chose, regardless of whether some muslims find it\noffensive, without fear of persecution or death.  \n\nI am naturally inclined to the latter position, but find myself in an\ninteresting position, because I think this is a fine book, only\nincidentally concerned with Islam, and moreover I'm damned if I can\nfind anything malevolently offensive in it.\n\nOver the years, when I have made this point, various primarily muslim\nposters have responded, saying that yes indeed they have read the book\nand had called it such things as "filth and lies", "I would rank\nRushdie's book with Hitler's Mein Kempf or worse", and so on.\nUnfortunately, these comments are usually generalities, and attempts\nto follow up by requesting explanations for what specifically is so\noffensive have met either with stony silence, more generalizations, or\ninaccurate or out-of-context references to the book [which lead me to\nbelieve that few of them have actually read it].  Corrections and\nattempts to discuss the text in context have been ignored.\n\nAnyway, since I seem to be the only one following this particular line\nof discussion, I wonder how many of the rest of the readership have\nread this book?  What are your thoughts on it?  \n-- \nJim Perry   perry@dsinc.com   Decision Support, Inc., Matthews NC\nThese are my opinions.  For a nominal fee, they can be yours.
[Interchange on Hoban deleted]\n\n\nOnly those you haven't actually read?  Sorry, but the irony remains.\n\n\nSo although you don't agree with the fatwa, and apparently don't think\nRushdie should be killed for his book, yet you think he is not due\nsympathy for being being under this threat.  Furthermore you base this\nreaction solely on the fact that he wrote about a particular\nwell-known story which -- if true -- might reflect poorly on the\nabsolute truth of your religion.  Yet, this opinion is formed without\nrecourse to actually looking to see how the story is used in context,\naccepting at face value the widespread propaganda on just what this\nbook contains and what the author's motivations are.  And then you\ncome forward and recommend another book which touches on (presumably\n"plays with") religious/historical material because you find its\noverall presentation neutral!

FREE-ENERGY TECHNOLOGY\n                       by Robert E. McElwaine, Physicist\n          \n               Ninety to a hundred years ago, everybody "knew" that a \n          heavier-than-air machine could not possibly fly.  It would \n          violate the "laws" of physics.  All of the "experts" and \n          "authorities" said so. \n          \n               For example, Simon Newcomb declared in 1901:  "The \n          demonstration that no possible combination of known \n          substances, known forms of machinery and known forms of \n          force, can be united in a practical machine by which man \n          shall fly long distances through the air, seems to the writer \n          as complete as it is possible for the demonstration of any \n          physical fact to be." \n          \n               Fortunately, a few SMART people such as the Wright \n          Brothers did NOT accept such pronouncements as the final \n          word.  Now we take airplanes for granted, (except when they \n          crash). \n          \n               Today, orthodox physicists and other "scientists" are \n          saying similar things against several kinds of 'Free Energy' \n          Technologies, using negative terms such as "pseudo-science" \n          and "perpetual motion", and citing so-called "laws" which \n          assert that "energy cannot be created or destroyed" ("1st law \n          of thermodynamics") and "there is always a decrease in useful \n          energy" ("2nd law of thermodynamics").  The physicists do not \n          know how to do certain things, so they ARROGANTLY declare \n          that those things cannot be done.  Such PRINCIPLES OF \n          IMPOTENCE are COMMON in orthodox modern "science" and help to \n          cover up INCONSISTENCIES and CONTRADICTIONS in orthodox \n          modern theories. \n          \n               Free Energy Inventions are devices which can tap a \n          seemingly UNLIMITED supply of energy from the universe, with-\n          OUT burning any kind of fuel, making them the PERFECT \n          SOLUTION to the world-wide energy crisis and its associated \n          pollution, degradation, and depletion of the environment. \n          \n               Most Free Energy Devices probably do not create energy, \n          but rather tap into EXISTING natural energy sources by \n          various forms of induction.  UNLIKE solar or wind devices, \n          they need little or no energy storage capacity, because they \n          can tap as much energy as needed WHEN needed.  Solar energy \n          has the DIS-advantage that the sun is often blocked by \n          clouds, trees, buildings, or the earth itself, or is reduced \n          by haze or smog or by thick atmosphere at low altitudes and \n          high latitudes.  Likewise, wind speed is WIDELY VARIABLE and \n          often non-existent.  Neither solar nor wind power are \n          suitable to directly power cars and airplanes.  Properly \n          designed Free Energy Devices do NOT have such limitations. \n          \n               For example, at least three U.S. patents (#3,811,058, \n          #3,879,622, and #4,151,431) have so far been awarded for \n          motors that run EXCLUSIVELY on permanent MAGNETS, seemingly \n          tapping into energy circulating through the earth's magnetic \n          field.  The first two require a feedback network in order to \n          be self-running.  The third one, as described in detail in \n          "Science & Mechanics" magazine, Spring 1980, ("Amazing \n          Magnet-Powered Motor", by Jorma Hyypia, pages 45-48, 114-117, \n          and front cover), requires critical sizes, shapes, \n          orientations, and spacings of magnets, but NO feedback.  Such \n          a motor could drive an electric generator or reversible \n          heatpump in one's home, YEAR ROUND, FOR FREE.

They typically have a 'SPARK GAP' in the circuit \n          which serves to SYNCHRONIZE the energy in the coils with the \n          energy being tapped.  It is important that the total \n          'inductance' and 'capacitance' of the Device combine to \n          'RESONATE' at the same frequency as 'EARTH RESONANCE' in \n          order to maximize the power output.  This output can also be \n          increased by centering the SPARK GAP at the 'NEUTRAL CENTER' \n          of a strong U-shaped permanent magnet.  In the case of a \n          Tesla Coil, slipping a 'TOROID CHOKE COIL' around the \n          secondary coil will enhance output power.  ["Earth Energy: \n          Fuelless Propulsion & Power Systems", by John Bigelow, 1976, \n          Health Research, P.O. Box 70, Mokelumne Hill, CA  95245.] \n          \n               During the 1930's, an Austrian civil engineer named \n          Viktor Schauberger invented and partially developed an \n          'IMPLOSION TURBINE' (German name, 'ZOKWENDLE'), after \n          analyzing erosion, and lack of erosion, in differently shaped \n          waterways, and developing sophisticated mathematical \n          equations to explain it.  As described in the book "A \n          Breakthrough to New Free-Energy Sources", by Dan A. Davidson, \n          1977, water is pumped by an IMPELLER pump through a \n          LOGARITHMIC-SPIRAL-shaped coil of tubing until it reaches a \n          CRITICAL VELOCITY.  The water then IMPLODES, no longer \n          touching the inside walls of the tubing, and drives the pump, \n          which then converts the pump's motor into an ELECTRIC \n          GENERATOR.  The device seems to be tapping energy from that \n          of the earth's rotation, via the 'Coriolis effect', LIKE A \n          TORNADO.  [ It can also NEUTRALIZE GRAVITY! ] \n          \n               A fourth type of Free Energy Device is the 'McClintock \n          Air Motor' (U.S. Patent #2,982,261), which is a cross between \n          a diesel engine (it has three cylinders with a compression \n          ratio of 27 to 1) and a rotary engine (with solar and \n          planetary gears).  It burns NO FUEL, but becomes self-running \n          by driving its own air compressor.  This engine also \n          generates a lot of heat, which could be used to heat \n          buildings; and its very HIGH TORQUE makes it ideal for large \n          trucks, preventing their slowing down when climbing hills.  \n          [David McClintock is also the REAL original Inventor of the \n          automatic transmission, differential, and 4-wheel drive.] \n          \n               Crystals may someday be used to supply energy, as shown \n          in the Star Trek shows, perhaps by inserting each one between \n          metal capacitor plates and bombarding it with a beam of \n          particles from a small radioactive source like that used in a \n          common household smoke detector. \n          \n               One other energy source should be mentioned here, \n          despite the fact that it does not fit the definition of Free \n          Energy.  A Bulgarian-born American Physicist named Joseph \n          Maglich has invented and partially developed an atomic FUSION \n          reactor which he calls 'Migma', which uses NON-radioactive \n          deuterium as a fuel [available in nearly UNLIMITED quantities \n          from sea water], does NOT produce radioactive waste, can be \n          converted DIRECTLY into electricity (with-OUT energy-wasting \n          steam turbines), and can be constructed small enough to power \n          a house or large enough to power a city.  And UNLIKE the \n          "Tokamaks" and laser fusion MONSTROSITIES that we read about, \n          Migma WORKS, already producing at least three watts of power \n          for every watt put in.  ["New Times" (U.S. version), 6-26-78, \n          pages 32-40.] \n          \n               And then there are the 'cold fusion' experiments that \n          have been in the news lately, originally conducted by \n          University of Utah researchers B. Stanley Pons and Martin \n          Fleischmann.  Some U.S. Navy researchers at the China Lake \n          Naval Weapons Center in California, under the direction of \n          chemist Melvin Miles, finally took the trouble to collect the \n          bubbles coming from such an apparatus, had them analyzed with \n          mass-spectrometry techniques, and found HELIUM 4, which \n          PROVES that atomic FUSION did indeed take place, and enough \n          of it to explain the excess heat generated. \n          \n               There are GOOD INDICATIONS that the two so-called "laws" \n          of thermodynamics are NOT so "absolute".  For example, the \n          late Physicist Dewey B. Larson developed a comprehensive \n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he \n          calls the 'Reciprocal System', (which he describes in detail \n          in several books such as "Nothing But Motion" (1979) and "The \n          Universe of Motion" (1984)), in which the physical universe \n          has TWO DISTINCT HALVES, the material half and an anti-matter \n          half, with a CONTINUOUS CYCLE of matter and energy passing \n          between them, with-OUT the "heat death" predicted by \n          thermodynamic "laws".  His Theory explains the universe MUCH \n          BETTER than modern orthodox theories, including phenomena \n          that orthodox physicists and astronomers are still scratching \n          their heads about, and is SELF-CONSISTENT in every way.  Some \n          Free Energy Devices might be tapping into that energy flow, \n          seemingly converting "low-quality energy" into "high-quality \n          energy". \n          \n               Also, certain religious organizations such as 'Sant Mat' \n          and 'Eckankar' teach their Members that the physical universe \n          is only the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN major levels of \n          existence, like parallel universes, or analogous to TV \n          channels, as described in books like "The Path of the \n          Masters", by Dr. Julian Johnson, 1939, and "Eckankar: The Key \n          to Secret Worlds", by Sri Paul Twitchell, 1969.  For example, \n          the next level up from the physical universe is commonly \n          called the 'Astral Plane'.  Long-time Members of these groups \n          have learned to 'Soul Travel' into these higher worlds and \n          report on conditions there.  It seems plausible that energy \n          could flow down from these higher levels into the physical \n          universe, or be created at the boundary between them, given \n          the right configuration of matter to channel it.  This is \n          supported by many successful laboratory-controlled \n          experiments in PSYCHO-KINESIS throughout the world, such as \n          those described in the book "Psychic Discoveries Behind the \n          Iron Curtain". \n          \n               In terms of economics, the market has FAILED.  Inventors \n          do not have enough money and other resources to fully develop \n          and mass-produce Free Energy Equipment, and the conventional \n          energy producer$ have no desire to do so because of their \n          VE$TED INTERE$T$.  The government is needed to intervene.  If \n          the government does not intervene, then the total supply of \n          energy resources from the earth will continue to decline and \n          will soon run out, prices for energy will increase, and \n          pollution and its harmful effects (including the 'GREENHOUSE \n          EFFECT', acid rain, smog, radioactive contamination, oil \n          spills, rape of the land by strip mining, etc.) will continue \n          to increase. \n          \n               The government should SUBSIDIZE research and development \n          of Free Energy by Inventors and universities, subsidize \n          private production (until the producers can make it on their \n          own), and subsidize consumption by low-income consumers of \n          Free Energy Hardware. \n          \n               The long-range effects of such government intervention \n          would be wide-spread and profound.  The quantity of energy \n          demanded from conventional energy producer$ (coal mining \n          companie$, oil companie$ and countries, electric utilitie$, \n          etc.) would drop to near zero, forcing their employees to \n          seek work elsewhere.  Energy resources (coal, uranium, oil, \n          and gas) would be left in the ground.  Prices for \n          conventional energy supplies would also drop to near zero, \n          while the price of Free Energy Equipment would start out high \n          but drop as supply increases (as happened with VCR's, \n          personal computers, etc.).  Costs of producing products that \n          require large quantities of energy to produce would decrease, \n          along with their prices to consumers.  Consumers would be \n          able to realize the "opportunity costs" of paying electric \n          utility bills or buying home heating fuel.  Tourism would \n          benefit and increase because travelers would not have to \n          spend their money for gasoline for their cars.  Government \n          tax revenue from gasoline and other fuels would have to be \n          obtained in some other way.  AND ENERGY COULD NO LONGER BE \n          USED AS A MOTIVE OR EXCUSE FOR MAKING WAR. \n          \n               Many conventional energy producer$ would go out of \n          business, but society as a whole, and the earth's environment \n          and ecosystems, would benefit greatly.  It is the People, \n          that government should serve, rather than the big \n          corporation$ and bank$. \n          \n\n               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., \n          please consult my CITED SOURCES (patents, articles, books). \n\n          \n               UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this \n          IMPORTANT Information is ENCOURAGED.
Okay, I see smilies, so this isn't supposed to be a serious post.\nOn the other hand, I would suppose it does has some motivation behind\nit. Apparently the idea is to poke fun at religion, but there is \npresumably some sort of reasoning behind it. As an argument, this \nstatement is worthless. Presuming the Qur'an is a perfect religious \ntext (whatever that might be) there is still plenty of room for \ndisagreement about its implications for issues far from essentials.\n\nI've already responded to the question of how a judgment might be made\nbetween two people who in fact _do_ disagree about Islam, which doesn't\npresume anything about the Qur'an other than its having sufficient\nclarity for all important disputes about the basic principles of\nIslam. This hardly constitutes a claim that no two people could have\ndisagreements about _all_ issues relevant to Islam.
Archive-name: atheism/overview\nAlt-atheism-archive-name: overview\nLast-modified: 20 April 1993\nVersion: 1.3\n\n                                   Overview\n\nWelcome to alt.atheism and alt.atheism.moderated.\n\nThis is the first in a series of regular postings aimed at new readers of the\nnewsgroups.\n\nMany groups of a 'controversial' nature have noticed that new readers often\ncome up with the same questions, mis-statements or misconceptions and post\nthem to the net.  In addition, people often request information which has\nbeen posted time and time again.  In order to try and cut down on this, the\nalt.atheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following\ntitles:\n\n   1.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Overview for New Readers\n   2.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Introduction to Atheism\n   3.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n   4.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Constructing a Logical Argument\n   5.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Atheist Resources\n\nThis is article number 1.  Please read numbers 2 and 3 before posting.  The\nothers are entirely optional.\n\nIf you are new to Usenet, you may also find it helpful to read the newsgroup\nnews.announce.newusers.  The articles titled "A Primer on How to Work With\nthe Usenet Community", "Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Usenet"\nand "Hints on writing style for Usenet" are particularly relevant.  Questions\nconcerning how news works are best asked in news.newusers.questions.\n\nIf you are unable to find any of the articles listed above, see the "Finding\nStuff" section below.\n\n\n                                   Credits\n\nThese files could not have been written without the assistance of the many\nreaders of alt.atheism and alt.atheism.moderated.  In particular, I'd like to\nthank the following people:\n\nkck+@cs.cmu.edu (Karl Kluge)\nperry@dsinc.com (Jim Perry)\nNETOPRWA@ncsuvm.cc.ncsu.edu (Wayne Aiken)\nchpetk@gdr.bath.ac.uk (Toby Kelsey)\njkp@cs.HUT.FI (Jyrki Kuoppala)\ngeoff.arnold@East.Sun.COM (Geoff Arnold)\ntorkel@sics.se (Torkel Franzen)\nkmldorf@utdallas.edu (George Kimeldorf)\nroe2@quads.uchicago.edu (Greg Roelofs)\narromdee@jyusenkyou.cs.jhu.edu (Ken Arromdee)\nmadhaus@netcom.com (Maddi Hausmann)\nJ5J@psuvm.psu.edu (John A.

Truly free.  You may copy them and distribute them\nto anyone you wish.  However, please send any changes or corrections to the\nauthor, and please do not re-post copies of the articles to alt.atheism; it\ndoes nobody any good to have multiple versions of the same document floating\naround the network.\n\n\n                                Finding Stuff\n\nAll of the FAQ files *should* be somewhere on your news system.  Here are\nsome suggestions on what to do if you can't find them:\n\n1. Check the newsgroup alt.atheism.  Look for subject lines starting with\n   "Alt.Atheism FAQ:".\n\n2. Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.\n\n   If you don't find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn't set up\n   correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the\n   problem.\n\n3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.70.0.226].\n   Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you'll find the latest\n   versions of the FAQ files there.\n\n   FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you\n   need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to\n   mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\n\n      send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq\n\n   in the body.\n\n4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article\n   "Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup" carries a list of these\n   sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.\n\n5. If you don't have FTP, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu\n   consisting of the following lines:\n\n      send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/faq\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/logic\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/resources\n\n5. (Penultimate resort)  Send mail to mail-server@mantis.co.uk consisting of\n   the following lines:\n\n      send atheism/faq/faq.txt\n      send atheism/faq/logic.txt\n      send atheism/faq/intro.txt\n      send atheism/faq/resource.txt\n\n   and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files.\n   There's other stuff, too; interesting commands to try are "help" and\n   "send atheism/index".\n\n6. (Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the\n   newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this\n   if you've tried the above methods and they've failed; it's not nice to\n   clutter the newsgroup or people's mailboxes with requests for files.\n   it's better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!  For instance,\n   people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who don't have \n   FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files.
That is not an "atheism mythology" in any sense of the word.\n"Religious paradoy" would be significantly more appropriate.\n\n	The 2nd part is rendered null and void by the simple fact that I\ndo know several "strong" atheists. I am sure that others do. I myself am\n"strong" in the sense that I find the standard concept of God without any\nmeaning. Any attempt to bring meaning either results in the destruction of \nthe viability of language, or in internal self contradiction. \n\n	The concept of strong atheism is not just a whimsical fantasy. They, \nand I, exist.\n\n	Your strawman is pointless and weak.\n\n---\n\nPrivate note to Jennifer Fakult.\n\n        "This post may contain one or more of the following:\n         sarcasm, cycnicism, irony, or humor. Please be aware \n         of this possibility and do not allow yourself to be \n         confused and/or thrown for a loop. If in doubt, assume\n         all of the above.
[...stuff deleted...]\n\nAs many posters have said in as many posts lately, this is just\nnot true.  For to show no interest in the existence of god takes no\nfaith at all.  You make the presumption that the _knowledge_ of the \n_possibility_ of something is enough to require faith to render \nthat possibilty of no interest.  It is a very different thing to say\nthat you don't believe something than it is to say that you don't\nhave sufficent reason to believe something is even interesting to \nthink about.  It's not either or.  Sometimes is just something else\nmore interesting that occupies your mind.  \n\nI agree that faith and dogma are inevitable, but not necessarily\napplied to god and religion.  It takes both faith and dogma to\nexpect the sun to come up every morning, but there is overwhelming\nreason every single day, day in and day out, for _everyone_ to put \nhis faith and dogma there.  Not so with the christian religion.
[stuff deleted]\n\nActually, you get a ton of weapons and ammunition, 70-80 followers, and hole\nup in some kind of compound, and wait for . . . . :-)
I hope there is not one- with a subject like this you just have a spiral.  What\nwould then be a morality of a morality of morals.  Labels don't make arguments. \nOne really needs a solid measuring stick by which most actions can be\ninterpreted, even though this would hardly seem moral.  For example "The best\nthing for me is to ensure that I will eat and drink enough.  Hence all actions\nmust be weighed against this one statement."  whatever helps this goal is\n"moral", whatever does not is "immoral"\n\nOf course this leads such a blank space: there are so many different ways to\nfulfill a goal, one would need a "hyper-morality" to apply to just the methods.\n\n\nSeems to me we only consider something moral or immoral if we stop to think\nabout it long enough  :)  On the other hand, maybe it is our first gut\nreaction...  Which?  Who knows: perhaps here we have a way to discriminate\nmorals.  I don't instinctively thing vegetarianism is right (the same way I\ninstinctively feel torture is wrong), but if I thought about it long enough and\nlistened to the arguments, I could perhaps reason that it was wrong (is that\npossible!?  :) )  See the difference?\n\n-- \n\n\nbest regards,\n\n--Adam
Another article that fell between the cracks:\n\n As evidence for the Resurrection, it is often claimed that the Disciples\nwere tortured to death for their beliefs and still did not renounce\ntheir claim that Jesus had come back from the dead.\n Now, I skimmed Acts and such, and I found a reference to this happening\nto Stephen, but no others. Where does this apparently very widely held\nbelief come from? Is there any evidence outside the Bible? Is there any\nevidence *in* the Bible? I sure haven't found any...\n\nBriefly, no.  There is widespread folklore, but no good documentary\nevidence, or even solid rumor, concerning the deaths of the Apostles.\nFurther, the usual context of such arguments, as you observe, is "No\nMartyrs for a Lie": i.e. the willingness of these people to die rather\nthan recant is evidence for the truth of their belief.  This adds the\nquite stronger twist that the proposed martyrs must have been offered\nthe chance of life by recanting.  Since we don't even know how or\nwhere they died, we certainly don't have this information.  (By the\nway, even in the case of Stephen it is not at all clear that he could\nhave saved himself by recanting).  The willingness of true believers\nto die for their belief, be it in Jesus or Jim Jones, is\nwell-documented, so martyrdom in and of itself says little.  [See\n1Kings18:20-40 for a Biblical account of the martyrdom of 450 priests\nof Baal].
You should wear your nicest boxer shorts and bring plenty of SPF 45+ \nsunscreen.  I'll grab my bathing suit, towerl and some veggie hotdogs and we \ncan have bonfire cookout!!\nDoes that sound good enough to you, Dean?\nEVERY a.a poster is invited!!!
bobbe@vice (Robert Beauchaine;6086;59-323;LP=A;YAyG) Pontificated: \n\nI would guess that you either mean that you don't have a problem\nswearing aligance to a non-existant being or that you are being\ndeliberatily dense (considering what group this is).  \n\nIt doesn't come "quite naturally" to nonbelievers such as myself\nor even to followers of other religions.  Would you say it would\nbe quite natural if you were forced to swear by "Allah" or\n"Budda"?
Sorry, Fred, but for the purposes under discussion here, I must\ndisagree.  Your point is true only in the sense that one cannot argue\nagainst communism by reference to the Chinese or Soviet empires, since\nthose did not represent *true* communism.  In judging the practical\nconsequences of Islam as a force to contend with in the world today,\nit is precisely the Khomeini's of the world, the Rushdie-fatwa\nsupporters, and perhaps more importantly, the reaction of the world\nMuslim community to those extremists, that we must look to.  Perhaps\nunfortunately from your perspective, most people are not concerned\nwith whether Islam is the right religion for them, or whether the\nQur'an could be used as a guidebook for a hypothetical utopia, but how\nIslam affects the world around them, or what their lives might be like\nif Islam gains in influence.  When I consider such possibilities, it\nis with not inconsiderable fear.
-- \nKevin makes a good point here, and when that theists miss all-too-often.  That\nis, the belief in a diety is not necessarily coupled with agreement/love of\nthat diety, so really they have yet another bit of convincing to do just beyond\nbelief.\nI guess the standard argumet goes something like: well, once you believe in\nGod, you know God is love, and you will choose to love him-- if it wasnt so\nwidely accepted and asserted it'd be laughable...\n\nbest regards,\n\n--Adam
[...deletions...]\n\n\nAn "Islamic Bank" is something which operates in a different fashion to\nyour modern bank, as I have explained here (on another thread) before.\nFor example, Islamic banks don't pay fixed interests on deposits, but a\nreturn on investments (which varies according to the market, and is not\nfixed like interest is).\n\nIslamic banks are a relatively new phenomenon in the Islamic world.\nThere are no Islamic banks in "the West", including the USA, to my\nknowledge.  I doubt if the market for them exists there -- at least not\nwhile "Islamic banks" are at a relatively early stage of their\ndevelopment as is the case now.  BCCI is most certainly not an "Islamic\nbank" -- did BCCI ever pay a fixed interest rate on deposits?  If the\nanswer to this question is "yes", then BCCI was not an Islamic bank, as\nIslamic banks are specifically set up to _not_ pay or charge interest.\n\nWhether some Muslims partially owned the bank or whatever is completely\nirrelevant.
: BULLSHIT!!! In the Gulf Massacre, 7% of all ordnance used was "smart." The\n: rest - that's 93% - was just regular, dumb ol' iron bombs and stuff. Have\n: you forgotten that the Pentagon definition of a successful Patriot launch\n: was when the missile cleared the launching tube with no damage? Or that a\n: successful interception of a Scud was defined as "the Patriot and Scud\n: passed each other in the same area of the sky"?\n: \n: And of the 7% that was the "smart" stuff, 35% hit. Again - try to follow me\n: here - that means 65% of this "smart" arsenal missed.

The church, for example,\nforbids that anyone "produce, describe or use any substance containing...\natoms". \n\nPHILIP K. DICK\n\nPhilip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short \nstories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable.\nHe wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than\ntechnology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he\nremained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:\n\n"Galactic Pot-Healer"\nA fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a\nremote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the\ndeity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is\nunable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.\n\n"A Maze of Death"\nNoteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.\n\n"VALIS"\nThe schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic\nChristianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of\nunknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and\ndismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.\n\n"The Divine Invasion"\nGod invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from\nanother star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be\nassisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.\n\nMARGARET ATWOOD\n\n"The Handmaid's Tale"\nA story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously\nassassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it\n"right" again.  The book is the diary of a woman's life as she tries to live\nunder the new Christian theocracy.  Women's right to own property is revoked,\nand their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the\nradio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished\nretroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the "old world" are\nhunted down and hanged.  Atwood's writing style is difficult to get used to\nat first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.\n\nVARIOUS AUTHORS\n\n"The Bible"\nThis somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, it\nis probably worth reading, if only so that you'll know what all the fuss is\nabout.  It exists in many different versions, so make sure you get the one\ntrue version.\n\n                             Books -- Non-fiction\n\nPETER DE ROSA\n\n"Vicars of Christ", Bantam Press, 1988\nAlthough de Rosa seems to be Christian or even Catholic this is a very\nenlighting history of papal immoralities, adulteries, fallacies etc.\n(German translation: "Gottes erste Diener.

Examines the way in which\nunbelief (whether agnostic or atheistic)  became a mainstream alternative\nworld-view.  Focusses on the period 1770-1900, and while considering France\nand Britain the emphasis is on American, and particularly New England\ndevelopments.  "Neither a religious history of secularization or atheism,\nWithout God, Without Creed is, rather, the intellectual history of the fate\nof a single idea, the belief that God exists." \n316 pages.

In this\nwork, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the\nexistence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely\nupon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and\naesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were\ndecisively rejected in Mackie's "The Miracle of Theism".  In the revised\nedition of "The Existence of God", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he\nmakes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.\n\nJ. L. MACKIE\n\n"The Miracle of Theism", Oxford\nThis (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal\narguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical\nphilosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through\nthe moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements\nof the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those\npositions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,\nsuch as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as "replacements for\nGod" such as Lelie's axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less\nformalistic and better written than Martin's works, and refreshingly direct\nwhen compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.\n\nJAMES A.

I looked back at this, and asked some questions of various people and\ngot the following information which I had claimed and you pooh-poohed.\nThe US has not sold Iraq any arms.  Their navy is entirely made of\nF-USSR vessels.  Their airforce (not including stuff captured from Kuwait\nwhich I am not as sure about), doesn't include any US equipment.  Their\nmissiles are all non-US.  Their tanks are almost all soviet, with about\n100 French tanks (older ones). The only US stuff in the Iraqi arsenal\nis a few M113s.  Those were not sold to Iraq.  Iraq captured them from\nother countries (like Kuwait).  Information is hard to prove.  You are\nclaiming that the US sold information?  Prove it. \n\nNow, how did the US build up Iraq again?  I just gave some fairly\nconclusive evidence that the US didn't sell arms to Iraq.  Information\nis hard to prove, almost certainly if the US did sell information, then that\nfact is classified, and you can't prove it.  If you can provide some\nuseful evidence that the US sold arms or valuable intelligence to Iraq,\nI am very interested, but not if you just make claims based on what\n"everyone knows".
I disagree.  In the end, the *individual* is responsible for his/her own\nirrationality.  The individual's belief in some dogmatic religion is a \nsymptom of that irrationality.\n\n\nAtheists and agnostics, I would imagine, but yes, that was my point.  An\natheist would theoretically be just as ill-equipped to study the philosophy\nof religion as a Christian, and yet there is a persistence of atheists\namong the ranks of philosophers.  Therefore, the conflict between one's\nreligious beliefs (or lack thereof) and the ability to be a philosopher\nmust not be as great as you assert.  The fact that most philosophers may\nbe non-religious was a secondary point.\n\n\n\nAs opposed to science practiced by theists?  Be careful here.\n\nScience does have a built-in defence against faith and dogma:\nskepticism.  Unfortunately, it is not foolproof.  There is that \nwonderful little creature known as the "theory."  Many of us believe in\nthe theory of evolution.  We have no absolute proof that this \ntheory is true, so why do we believe it?  Because it "makes more \nsense than...?"  There is quite a bit of faith involved here.\n\n\n\nWell, not ALL current beliefs are deficient, but basically I agree.\n\n\n\nIdeally, this is true.  In reality, though, you have to acknowledge\nthat scientists are human.  Scientists have egos and biases.  Some\nscientists assume a particular theory is true, refuse to admit the\nflaws in that theory because of ego problems or whatever, and proceed\nto spend their time and money trying to come up with absolute proof \nfor the theory.  Remember cold fusion?\n\n\n\nNot really.  I agree that we spent far too much money on the Waco\ncrisis ($7,500,000 I believe), especially considering the outcome.\nMy point was that mass suicides in the U.S. are rare (Jonestown was\nin Guyana, incidentally, although we footed the bill for the clean-up),\nand the U.S. has far more important issues to address.  Compare the\nnumber of U.S. citizens who have died in mass suicides with, say, the\nnumber of U.S. soldiers who died during one week of the Vietnam War and\nyou will see my point.

As per various threads on science and creationism, I've started dabbling into a\nbook called Christianity and the Nature of Science by JP Moreland.  A question\nthat I had come from one of his comments.  He stated that God is not \nnecessarily a religious term, but could be used as other scientific terms that\ngive explanation for events or theories, without being a proven scientific \nfact.  I think I got his point -- I can quote the section if I'm being vague. \nThe examples he gave were quarks and continental plates.  Are there \nexplanations of science or parts of theories that are not measurable in and of\nthemselves, or can everything be quantified, measured, tested, etc.?  \n\nMAC\n--\n****************************************************************\n                                                    Michael A.

As I don't know this book, I will use your heresay.\n\n\n	It depends on how he defines God. The way I understand the meaning\nof that term preclues it being used in a useful way in science. Ideas drawn\nfrom an understanding that God is supernatural precludes us from forming\nscientific assertions that can be falsified, that is, where we can decide\nthat they are true or false within the terms of we use and useful observations\ndrawn from them.\n\n	Some religionists have an interest in bluring the definitions within\nscience to make them more reconcilable, and especially subserviant in a basic\nway, to religious dogma. This pursuit always fails.\n\n\n	Reconciliation of science with religion involves circumventing the\ntendancy to claim that either pursuit can gain absolute or certian knowledge,\nor that the domain of truth in each is fundementally limited in some way. It\ngererally confurs the element of uncertainty and limitations to human knowledge\nwhile allowing for the different concerns of these separate pursuits. Science\nand religion ask different questions which have imperfect and provisional\nanswers, at best. Science is distinctly limited in where it can ask meaningful\nquestions. More questions can be posed than it can answer. At the basis of\nsacred language is the place where words fail us and mere assertions disolve\nin contradiction.
This is the most unmitigated bilge I've seen in a while. Jim Brown obviously\nhas possession of the right-wing token.\n\n\n"In December, former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski told a\nSenate committee that sanctions were costing Iraq $100 million per day, and\nthat the multinational coalition could take all the time in the world.\nIraq, he suggested, was losing badly every day it defied the UN demands,\nwhile the community of nations won every day -- with no taking of life or\nloss of life."  -- FCNL Washington Newsletter.\n\n\nWrongful actions of murderers like leaders of the US government, perhaps?\nRegrettable, of course; The-Way-It-Is - certainly not.\n\n\nGood heavens! An escapee from Rush Limbot Land! "Conservative", my ass.\n\n\nBULLSHIT!!! In the Gulf Massacre, 7% of all ordnance used was "smart." The\nrest - that's 93% - was just regular, dumb ol' iron bombs and stuff. Have\nyou forgotten that the Pentagon definition of a successful Patriot launch\nwas when the missile cleared the launching tube with no damage? Or that a\nsuccessful interception of a Scud was defined as "the Patriot and Scud\npassed each other in the same area of the sky"?\n\nAnd of the 7% that was the "smart" stuff, 35% hit. Again - try to follow me\nhere - that means 65% of this "smart" arsenal missed.\n\n\nProve it. I have a source that says that to date, the civilian death count\n(er, excuse me, I mean "collateral damage") is about 200,000.\n\n-s\n--\n   "No one has attempted to calculate the costs of an execution in\nWashington state, but studies elsewhere suggest it costs far more than\nincarceration.\n   "California is spending more than $90 million annually on capital cases,\nand until this year hadn't executed anyone since 1972.  Texas, the national\nleader in the number of executions, spends an estimated $2.3 million per\nexecution.  That compares to an average cost of incarceration in Washington\nstate of $25,000 per maximum-security prisoner per year."

(Short reply to Kent Sandvik's post remarking how it is strange that\nsomehow Sufism is related to Islam, as [to him] they seem quite\ndifferent.)\n\nIf one really understands Islam, it is not strange that Sufism is\nassociated with it.  In fact, Sufism is (in general) seen as the "inner\ndimension" of Islam.\n\nOne of the "roots" of the word "Islam" is "submission" -- "Islam"\ndenotes submission to God.  Sufism is the most complete submission to\nGod imaginable, in "annihilating" oneself in God.\n\n(I am not a Sufi or on the Sufi path, but have read a lot and recently\nhave been discussing a number of things with others who are on the Sufi\npath.)

I assume you understand that your\n: statement is also undermining such human constructs as religion\n: as well.\n\n\nKent,\n\nI'll accept this as a compliment although I'm always a little paranoid\nwhen visiting a.a, thanks. Yes I do know the extent of the statements\nrelevence, it's what I think of as human nature. I'm not sure it\nundermines either religion or atheism since both claim special\nknowledge about the Truth and since such claims are always suspect,\nall we can learn from it is that humans are a very arrogant species.\nMy point is that we cannot ignore human nature when examining human\nclaims. The trick here then, is to find some way to abstract our\ninfinitely fallible nature from whatever reality is out there so we\ncan see what there is to see. I can think of no way this can be done.
Well, yes.  This is the real mystery of the matter, and why I am rather\ndubious of a lot of the source theories.\n\nThere are a number of places where the Masoretic Text (MT) of the OT is\nobscure and presumably corrupted.  These are reproduced exactly from copy to\ncopy.  The DSS tend to reflect the same "errors".  This would appear to tell\nus that, at least from some point, people began to copy the texts very\nexactingly and mechanically.  The problem is, we don't know what they did\nbefore that.  But it seems as though accurate transmission begins at the\npoint at which the texts are perceived as texts.  They may be added to (and\nin some situations, such as the end of Mark, material is lost), but for the\nmost part there are no substantial changes to the existing text.\n\nYou're basically trying to make a mountain out of a molehill.  Some people\nlike to use the game of "telephone" as a metaphor for the transmission of\nthe texts.  This clearly wrong.  The texts are transmitted accurately.
That's fascinating.   I heard that the Chinese, rather than\nthe Italians, invented pasta.
Bill, I think you have a misunderstanding about atheism. Lack of \nbelief in God does not directly imply lack of understanding\ntranscendental values. I hope you would accept the fact that \nfor instance Buddhists appreciate issues related to non-empirical\nreasoning without the need to automatically believe in theism.\n\nI think reading a couple of books related to Buddhism might \nrevise and fine tune your understanding of non-Christian systems.\n\nCheers,\nKent

This is the story of Kent, the archetype Finn, that lives in the \nBay Area, and tried to purchase Thomas Paine's "Age of Reason". This\nman was driving around, to Staceys, to Books Inc, to "Well, Cleanlighted\nPlace", to Daltons, to various other places.\n\nWhen he asked for this book, the well educated American book store\nassistants in most placed asked him to check out the thriller section,\nor then they said that his book has not been published yet, but they\nshould receive the book soon. In some places the assistants bluntly\nsaid that they don't know of such an author, or that he is not \na well known living author, so they don't keep copies of his books.\n\nSuch is the life and times of America, 200+ years after the revolution.\n\n\nCheers,\nKent

Probably because it IS rape.\n\n\nSo nothing.  It may work for some, but not for others: it doesn't give any\ninsight into an overall God or overall truth of a religion- it would seem to be\ndependent solely on the individual, as well as individually-created.  And since\nChristians have failed to show us how there way of life is in any wy better\nthan ours, I do not see why the attempt to try it is necessary, or even\nparticularly attractive.\n\n\nWell, we will nerver know for sure if we were told the truth or not, but at the\nvery least there is a bit more evidence pointing to the fact that, say, there\nwas a military conflict in Vietnam 25 years ago, then there is a supernatural\ndiety who wants us to live a certain way.  The fact that Jesus warned against\nit means nothing.  *I* warn against it too.  Big deal.\n\n\nThis is not true.  The first two choices here (life and death) are scantily\ndocumented, and the last one is total malarky unless one uses the Bible, and\nthat is totally circular.  Perhaps it be better to use the imagination, or\none's ignorance.  Someone else will address this I'm sure, and refer you to\nplenty of documentation...\n\n\nHow is this?  There is nothing more disgusting than Christian attempts to\nmanipulate/interpret the Old Testament as being filled with signs for the\ncoming of Christ.  Every little reference to a stick or bit of wood is\nautmoatically interpreted as the Cross.  What a miscarriage of philology.\n\n\nWell, since we have skeptical hearts (thank goodness,) there is no way to get\ninto us.  Here we have the irreconcilable difference: Christians glorify\nexactly what we tend to despise or snub: trust/belief/faith without knowledge. \nIf I am lucky one day and I happen to be thinking of God at the same time my\nenkephalins go up, then I may associate this as a sign of God (it will "feel"\nright, and I will trust without knowing).  Maybe.  Religosity does not seem to\nbe anything that is conclusively arrived at, but rather it seems to be more of\na sudden affliction...\nI believe many of us were willing to die for what we believed, many of us were\nnot.  The question is, is suchg an attitude reflective of a _correct_ or\nhealthy morality.  IT would seem not to be.  The same thing could reflect\nfanaticism, for example, and is any case an expression of simple selfishness.\n-- \n\n--Adam
No wonder that we don't see any detail for this claim.

Like in this case, there\nare broader definitions of gods used by persons who are considered by\nthemselves and others theists. I have pointed to that in my post. You\nuse one of them.\n \nYour use of definitions seems to rest on the assumption: because my\nmoral is objective/absolute or the other buzz words you are so fond\nof, everybody will know it, and there is no need to define it more\nexactly.\n \nAnd as a user has shown recently, the easiest way to dispell you is\nto ask you for definitions.

It is like "thanks for reading this far" on the end\nof a letter. Most religions claim that they won't fizzle because they contain\nsome eternal truth. So does Christianity. Since there are old religions it is\nno wonder to find old religions that have it that they would last.
May I ask why they are afraid to do so?\n\n---\n\n  Speaking of proofs of God, the funniest one I have ever seen was in a\n  term paper handed in by a freshman.  She wrote, "God must exist, because\n  he wouldn't be so mean as to make me believe he exists if he really\n  doesn't!"  Is this argument really so much worse than the ontological\n  proofs of the existence of God provided by Anselm and Descartes, among\n  others?

That's funny, I thought you were making a statement about what\npeople think.    In fact, I see it quoted up there.
It should be noted that belief in God is in itself no more a behavoral\nimperative than lack of belief. It is religion which causes the harm,\nnot the belief in God.

I thing the principle is sort of the same though:\nall "philosophical" ideas are generally tried out and tested mostly during\ncollege years.

I suppose for the same reason that you do not believe in all the gods.  Why\nshould any be any different?  I use the same arguments to dismiss Koresh\nas I do god.  Tell me, then, why do you not believe that Koresh is the son\nof god?  By logic it is equally possible that Koresh is Jesus reborn.
[This is SWF in another indirect post via Dan].\n\npredicitions\nif you\nhave some\nmany types of\nhappen again\nmay predict\nreaction\n\nThere are several problems here. First, you are discussing only\nexperimental procedures. Observational procedures are also useful.  The\nmain criterion is attempting to verify an idea by using it to make\nprediction about as-yet unmade observations. The observations could be\nthe result of an experiment, or they could be obsevations of activity\noccuring spontaneossly in nature, or they could even be observations of\nthe lasting results of events long past. All that matters is that the\nobservations be *new*.  This is what prediction is about in science -\nit is\n*not* about predicting the future except in this very restricted\nsense.\n\nSecondly, repeatability can also take many forms.  It is really just\nthe\nrequirement that independent observers be able to verify the results.\nThe\nobservation of a fossil is 'repeatable', since any qualified observer\nmay\nlook at it (this is why the specimens are reqtined in a museum).  Also,\nthere is the implicit prediction that future fossil finds will\ncorrespond\nto the current one.  New fossils are found often enough that this is\ntested regularly.  Many times a new fossil actually falsifies some\nconclusion made on the basis of previous fossils.\n\nUnfortunately for you, the models that were falsified have alway been\nperipheral to the model of evolution we now have.  (For instance, the\nfront legs of Tyrannosaurus rex turned out to have tremendous muscles,\nrather than being weakly endowed as previously believed).\n\nSo, in fact, histoircal science findings *are* repeatable in the\nnecessary sense.  Just becuase you cannot go out and repeat the\noriginal\nevent does *not* make it impossible to make valid observations.\n\n[This is not to say that biologists would not go coo-coo if extra-\nterrestrial life were discovered - that could make the determination\nof the process of abiogenesis relatively easy].\n\n--\nsarima@teradata.com                     (formerly tdatirv!sarima)\n  or\nStanley.Friesen@ElSegundoCA.ncr.com

The human race didn't evolve from one set parents, but from\nthousands. Do you really base your atheist on -this-?\n\n: Considering that something like 4 out of 5 humans on this planet don't know instinctively that the Christian god exist, the claim of instinctive knowledge doesn't look like it hold much water.

This response originally fell into a bit bucket.  I'm reposting it\njust so Bill doesn't think I'm ignoring him.\n\n\nBill,\n\nI'm sorry to have been busy lately and only just be getting around to\nthis.\n\nApparently you have some fundamental confusions about atheism; I think\nmany of these are well addressed in the famous FAQ.  Your generalisms\nare then misplaced -- atheism needn't imply materialism, or the lack\nof an absolute moral system.  However, I do tend to materialism and\ndon't believe in absolute morality, so I'll answer your questions.\n\n\nAn atheist judges value in the same way that a theist does: according\nto a personal understanding of morality.  That I don't believe in an\nabsolute one doesn't mean that I don't have one.  I'm just explicit,\nas in the line of postings you followed up, that when I express\njudgment on a moral issue I am basing my judgment on my own code\nrather than claiming that it is in some absolute sense good or bad.\nMy moral code is not particular different from that of others around\nme, be they Christians, Muslims, or atheists.  So when I say that I\nobject to genocide, I'm not expressing anything particularly out of\nline with what my society holds.\n\nIf your were to ask why I think morality exists and has the form it\ndoes, my answer would be mechanistic to your taste -- that a moral\ncode is a prerequisite for a functioning society, and that humanity\nprobably evolved morality as we know it as part of the evolution of\nour ability to exist in large societies, thereby achieving\nconsiderable survival advantages.  You'd probably say that God just\nmade the rules.  Neither of us can convince the other, but we share a\ncommon understanding about many moral issues.  You think you get it\nfrom your religion, I think I get it (and you get it) from early\nchildhood teaching.\n\n\nI think you've been reading the wrong sort of comic books, but in\nprying through the gobbledygook I basically agree with what you're\nsaying.  I do believe that my mental reactions to stimuli such as "God\ncommanded the genocide of the Canaanites" is mechanistic, but of\ncourse I think that's true of you as well.  My reaction has little to\ndo with whether God exists or even with whether I think he does, but\nif a god existed who commanded genocide, I could not consider him\ngood, which is supposedly an attribute of God.\n\n\nHmm.  Yes, I think some heavy FAQ-reading would do you some good.  I\nhave as much place discussing values etc. as any other person.  In\nfact, I can actually accomplish something in such a discussion, by\nframing the questions in terms of reason: for instance, it is clear\nthat in an environment where neighboring tribes periodically attempt\nto wipe each other out based on imagined divine commands, then the\nquality of life will be generally poor, so a system that fosters\ncoexistence is superior, if quality of life is an agreed goal.  An\nabsolutist, on the other hand, can only thump those portions of a\nBible they happen to agree with, and say "this is good", even if the\nact in question is unequivocally bad by the standards of everyone in\nthe discussion.  The attempt to define someone or a group of people as\n"excluded from discussion", such that they "cannot participate", and\ntheir opinions given "no weight whatsoever" is the lowest form or\nreasoning (ad hominem/poisoning the well), and presumably the resort\nof someone who can't rationally defend their own ideas of right,\nwrong, and the Bible.\n-- \nJim Perry   perry@dsinc.com   Decision Support, Inc., Matthews NC\nThese are my opinions.  For a nominal fee, they can be yours.
In the part of the posting you have so helpfully deleted, I \npointed out that they used the wording from the English Bill of\nRights apparently *changing* what they understood by it, and I\nasked why then should we, two hundred years later, be bound by\nwhat Keith Allan Schneider *thinks* they understood by it.\n\n\nSo one cannot say "a cruel fate"?\n\nYour prevarications are getting increasingly unconvincing, I think.
Throw away the FAQ.   We can all just ask Mr O'Dwyer, since he can\ndefine the thing that the rest of us only talk about.
In <1993Apr20.004119.6119@cnsvax.uwec.edu> nyeda@cnsvax.uwec.edu (David Nye) \n\n\nWhy? How? Might makes right? How can they force their morality on me? Why \ncan't I do what I want? Who are they to decide? What if I disagree? \n\nGood point, but it is being immoral in our opinion.  We don't let them choose,\nwe make the decision that their actions are wrong for them.\n\n  For someone to lay claim to an alternative\n\nI admit to lean toward the idea of an innate moral sense, but have little basis\nfor it as of yet.  How far can such a concept be extended?\n\n and\n\nDo you mean that we could say it would be wrong for us to do such a thing but \nnot him.  After all, he was behaving morally in his own eyes and doing what he\nchose.  On what basis do we condemn other societies besides, here's the buzz \nwords, on the idea that there are some actions wrong for all humans in all \nsocieties?\n\n  Holding that morality is subjective does not mean\n\nWhy not? Do we have to be objective suddenly?\n\nMAC\n--\n****************************************************************\n                                                    Michael A.

What makes you think that\ntheist leaders believe what they say?  Especially when they say\none thing and do another, or say one thing closely followed by its\nopposite?  The practice is not restricted to theism, but it's there\nfor anyone to see.  It's almost an epidemic in this country.\n\nJust for instance, if it is harder for a camel to pass thru' the eye\nof a needle, why is the Catholic church such a wealthy land-owner?

Ever read Animal Farm?\n#>#>\n#>#That's a straw man. And as usually in discussions with you one has to\n#>#repeat it: Read what I have written above: not every theism leads to\n#>#fanatism, and not all fanatism is caused by theism.

The word you're groping for is "some".\n#>\n# \n#Bogus again. Not all theism as is is fanatic. However, the rest already\n#gives backup for the statement about the correlation about fanatism and\n#theism. And further, the specialty of other theistic beliefs allows them\n#to switch to fanatism easily. It takes just a nifty improvement in the\n#theology.\n\nTruth by blatant assertion.  \n# \n# \n#>#Gullibility, by the way, is one of them.\n#>\n#>No shit, Sherlock.  So why not talk about gullibility instead of theism,\n#>since it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have, as opposed\n#>to the case you are trying to make?\n#>\n# \n#Because there is more about theism that the attraction to gullible people\n#causing the correlation. And the whole discussion started that way by the\n#statement that theism is meaningfully correlated to fanatism, which you\n#challenged.\n\nIndeed I did.  As I recall, I asked for evidence.  What is the correlation\nof which you speak?  \n# \n# \n#>#And to say that I am going to forbid religion is another of your straw\n#>#men.

I am quite well aware that giving everyone their rights\n#protects me better from fanatics than the other way round.\n\nOf course, other people are always fanatics, never oneself.  Your\nwish to slur all theists seems pretty fanatical to me.\n# \n#It is quite nice to see that you are actually implying a connection between\n#that argument and the rise of fanatism.

I don't agree with it; now try proving, through\n#>#some objective moral test, that my disagreeing is incorrect. =)\n#> \n#> Your claim, which you have deleted now was "not universal => not objective".\n#\n#      I've deleted it now, in the interest of brevity. Go back a step\n#and you'll see it was still in your post. Yes, that was my claim; if you\n#can refute it, then please do so.\n\nFirstly, an apology.  You hadn't deleted your claim, and I was mistaken in\nsaying you had. Sorry for any offence caused.\n\nSecondly,  how can I refute your definition?  I can only point up its\nlogical implications, and say that they seem to contradict the usage\nof the word "objective" in other areas.  Indeed, by your definition, an\nobjective x is an oxymoron, for all x.  I have no quibble with that\nbelief, other than that it is useless, and that "objective" is a perfectly\ngood word.\n\n#> So, what *is* objective?  Not the age of the universe, anyway, as I show\n#> above.\n#\n#      How many ages can the universe have, and still be internally self-\n#consistent? I'd be amazed if it was more than one. How many different\n#moral systems can different members of society have - indeed, single\n#individuals, in some cases - and humanity still stick together?\n\nBegging the question.  People can have many opinions about the age\nof the universe and humanity can still stick together.   You are\nsaying that the universe has a _real_ age, independent of my beliefs about\nit.  Why?\n\n#      The age of the universe, like most scientific facts, can be\n#emirically verified through means that'll give the same result no matter\n#who performs the testing (albeit there are error bars that may be on the\n#largish side...). \n\nThis assumes that the universe has a real age, or any kind of reality\nwhich doesn't depend on what we think.   Why should an extreme Biblical\nCreationist give a rat's ass about the means of which you speak?\n\n#I've heard of no way to verify morality in a\n#consistent way, much less compute the errors of the measurement; care to\n#enlighten me?\n\nThe same is true of pain, but painkillers exist, and can be predicted\nto work with some accuracy better than a random guess.  I wrote\nelsewhere that morality should be hypotheses about observed value.\nIf a moral system makes a prediction "It will be better if...",\nthat can be tested, and is falsifiable in the same way as a prediction\n"This drug will relieve pain..."\n\n#      People's *ideas* about the age of object X are *not* objective;\n#you can have any idea you like, and I can't stop you. Universae and\n#their ages is another ballgame; they are what they are, and if you\n#dislike some detail of them, that's a problem with your *opinion* of\n#them. \n\nSure.  Assume an objective reality, and you get statements like this.\n\n#I claim that morality is an opinion of ours, and as such\n#subjective and individual. If I'm wrong, then some more-or-less\n#objectively "real" thing exists, which you label "objective morality";\n#can you back up this positive claim of existence?\n\nCan you back up your positive claim above?  No.  That's because it's an\nassumption.  I make the same assumption about values, on the basis\nthat there is no logical difference between the two, and the empirical\nbasis of the two is precisely the same.\n\n#>#      Point: Morals are, in essence, personal opinions. Usually\n#>#(ideally) well-founded, motivated such, but nonetheless personal. The\n#>#fact that a real large lot of people agree on some moral question,\n#>#sometimes even for the same reason, does not make morals objective; it\n#>#makes humans somewhat alike in their opinions on that moral question,\n#>#which can be good for the evolution of a social species.\n#> \n#> And if a "real large lot" (nice phrase) of people agree that there is a \n#> football on a desk, I'm supposed to see a logical difference between the two?  \n#> Perhaps you can explain the difference to me, since you seem to see it\n#> so clearly.\n#\n#      Take a look on the desk - i.e., perform a test.

The CLIPPER initiative is an announcement by Clinton that all the \n"secure" voice phones will use the same crypto chip, as a de-facto\ngovernment standard.  Problem is, the government is admitting that\nthey hold the keys to break the code easily, and the Justice department\nwill be using the keys to listen in on "illegal activities."  Many\npeople are really scared about such an initiative because it is\na major step towards outlawing real crypto protection on things\nlike email if you read the press release.  The project was developed\nby NSA and given to NIST.  It uses two keys S1 and S2 that the\ngovernment claims are needed to break the code.  They claim that\nthese keys will be handed to two different companies, and when they\nget a warrant to do a wiretap (the chip is nicknamed the wiretap chip),\nthey have to get the keys from both companies.  People have poked holes\nthrough and through the press release official version and shown how\nit is nowhere near as nice as it sounds, and I have given the simplified\nversion.  People over on sci.crypt are really scared about this\nproposal it seems.
I asked around in one of the areas you suggested yourself, and presented\nthe information I got.  No mention of US landmines was given.\n\n\nOkay, so you are going to blindly believe in things without reasonable\nevidence?  I didn't realize you were a theist.  I am doubting a claim\npresented without any evidence to support it.  If you are able to present\nreal evidence for it, then great.  But unsupported claims, or even claims\nby such and such news agency will not be accepted.

If you \nhave access to classified information that you know to be classified,\nand you reveal it, there is a good chance that you or someone else \n(the person who revealed it to you), is going to jail.  \n\nI never said that you couldn't prove it to my satisfaction, I merely\nsaid that it was difficult.

Obviously, we have different sources. Bill Moyers (who happens to be a\ntheist, to tie this to alt.atheism!) in his PBS documentary "After The\nWar" is my main source.

I saw a 3 hour show on PBS the other day about the history of the\nJews.

I am doing research on atheism, part of which involves field research here\non the net.  The following is a survey directed towards all readers of this\ngroup, intended to get data about the basis of atheistic belief.  I would\nseriously appreciate it if each and every one of you would fill it out and\nmail it back to me at mtabbott@unix.amherst.edu.  \n\nFirst of all, I've tried to structure questions that can be answered in a\nvariety of ways, with varying amounts of detail; it's possible to give \nsuccinct answers to most everything, but there's enough here to keep most of \nyou typing for hours, I'm sure.  As much detail as you want to give me (I mean \nit) is great, but it's also important for me to have as broad a base of \nindividuals as possible, so even minimal responses are far better than nothing\n-- it's a short survey if you just answer the questions without elaboration.  \n\nSecondly, I hope some of the questions don't come off as obnoxious; I know that\nphrases like "What would convince you of the existence of God" imply that I am\na seminary student intent on proving you all to be ignorant Godless heathens.\nIn fact, I'm not too sure about the existence of a higher power myself, so my\nuse of "God" is a question of locution rather than ideology -- it's easier \nthan just repeating "a deity or higher power" every time.  \n\nAlso, I tend to use a lot of anthropological buzzwords like "belief system"\nalthough I know some of you might contend that you don't have ANY beliefs, but\nare skeptical towards everything.  I understand; but you know what I mean.\nThink of such buzzwords as abbreviations for the rather unweildy phrases \nrequired to get the precise idea across.  \n\nLastly, thanks!  Please fill out as much as you can, in as much detail as\nyou can, and send them to me.  My research and I thank you.  \n\n---------------\n\nWhere would you place your beliefs, on the spectrum \n	Theism <--> Agnosticism <--> Weak Atheism <--> Strong Atheism?  \nFeel free to elaborate on your specific beliefs.  \n\n\nIn what, if any, religious tradition were you raised?  Did you ever believe \nin the existence of a God?  (Several of the following questions presume \nthat the answer to this is "yes;" if you've always been an atheist, or at\nleast never a theist, you may have to modify the question/answer somewhat.)\n\n\nHow serious was your/your family's involvement?  \n\nHow and when did you start to doubt the tenets you were raised to believe?  \n\nHow and when did your "final break" with your beliefs, if any, occur?  I \nrealize that this is often more of an ongoing process than an "event" per se;\nwhatever the case, just describe it in whatever detail you wish.  \n\n\nWhat contact with other atheists have you had; before and after (and during)\nyour "conversion" to atheism?  (Certainly your involvement with alt.atheism\ncounts -- how have net discussions affected your beliefs?)  \n\nTo what extent do you think other atheists have influenced you in your\nbeliefs?  Did you come by your beliefs through discussion, through\nindependent means, or by some combination of the two or other means?  \n\n\nAre you convinced that your beliefs were acquired through wholly rational\nmeans (proofs of the non-existence of God, etc), or was it perhaps, at least \nin part, through other means (alienation from mainstream religion, etc)?  \n\n\nTo what extent do you feel you "understand" the universe through your beliefs?\nWhat phenomena of the universe and of human existence (anything from physical\nphenomena to the problem of the existence of evil in human affairs) do you \nfeel are adequately dealt with by your beliefs, and where are they lacking as \nan explanatory method?  \n\nWhat would it take for you to question, or change, your beliefs?  What would\nconvince you of the existence of God, what would convince you of the \nplausibility of God's existence, and so forth?  How dynamic are your beliefs\n-- are they constantly changing; have they stayed more or less the same for\nsome time?  \n\nAre you involved in a career or education in science?  To what extent do you\nthink science has influenced your beliefs?  (Issac Asimov claimed that science\nwas the new "secular religion," and that "scientists are, in a very real sense,\nthe new priesthood."  Do you see the pursuit of science as having a quasi-\nreligious base, or even a religious element?)  \n\n---------------\n\nThis survey is intended to get data from a broad range of individuals, but\nalso to help me narrow down the field to a small group of people whose\nideas and histories could be very useful to me.  Would you be willing to have\nme, on the basis of this survey, write you to find out more about you and your\nbeliefs?  If not, fine; your filling out the survey alone is great.  \n\n---------------\n\nThanks again.  Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about what\nI'm doing with this data, or if you have anything to say in addition to what\nI've asked about above.
I think this should be illuminating to all. Let me make a first\nsuggestion. When Arabic words, especially technical ones, become of use \nlet us define them for those, especially atheists, to whom they may not be\nterribly familiar. Please also note that though I did initially refer\nto Khomeini as a heretic for what I understood to be a claim -- rejected \nby you since -- of personal infallibility, I withdraw this as a basis\nfor such a statement. I conditionally retain this reference in regard\nto Khomeini's advocacy of the thesis of the infallibility of the \nso-called "Twelve Imams," which is in clear conflict with the Qur'an \nin that it places the Twelve Imams in a category of behavior and example\nhigher than that of the Muhammad, in that the Qur'an shows that the\nProphet was clearly fallible, as well as (it appears, given your\nabstruse theological statment regarding the "natures"  of the Twelve\nImams) placing them in a different metaphysical category than the \nremainder of humanity, with the possible exception of Muhammad, \nsomething which verges on the sin of association.\n\n\nAlaikum Wassalam,

My last response in this thread fell into a bit-bucket and vanished\n(though appearing locally).  I'll repost it, since I always feel\nslighted when someone appears to ignore one of my postings in a\nconversational thread, I don't want Rob to think I'm doing so.  Since\nthis is now dated, however, don't feel compelled to respond...\n\n\nI suspect you meant this in context of the Jewish tradition you have\nbeen referring to; one problem with a highly-interpreted tradition\nlike this is what happens when a schism occurs, and over time certain\nlarge and influential branches of the heretical group come to favor\nexactly a "face value" interpretation...\n\n\nWhile the context of the time is important, value judgments must\nultimately be according to current understanding, or at least to some\nbase standard (relative stability/success of a society, e.g.).  This\nis obviously true in comparing it to practices of surrounding people,\nfor instance: according to the Bible, the surrounding people were\nimmoral savages with repulsive and inhuman habits.  We need to look\nrather at what those peoples were *really* like.  For instance, in\nwhat way is it better to worship a single god whose presence is\nsymbolically strongest in a tent or temple over multiple gods some of\nwhose presence is symbolically represented in a statue?  By the\nBible's own terms idolatry is inherently evil, but I see no evidence\nthat the followers of the various other religions of the area and time\nwere particularly bad people, relative to the people in the Bible.\n\n\nSounds good, but it presupposes teeth-rending neighbors, which I see\nno support for.  One can argue that post-facto assertion of inhumane\nneighbors can be used to make moral points, but that doesn't mean that\nthe actual neighbors really were inhuman.  More to the point, such\ndehumanization of the people across the river or over the mountain, or\neven of a different people dwelling among us, is all too common.\n\n\nNote that I'm speaking of historical interpretation here, for instance\nclaiming that Hammurabi's "an eye for an eye" was primitive brutal\nretribution, while Moses' version was an enlightened benign fine\n(because the tradition has since interpreted the phrase that way).  As\nof 3000 years ago or so, they probably both meant the same thing.\n\n\nI don't belittle the accomplishments, particularly the intellectual\nones, of the Jewish people.  I have given up on trying to think by\nanalogy, since I don't know of any other 'tribe' that is at all\nsimilar (the closest I can think of are the Romany, but I don't know\nenough about them to make a meaningful comparison).  I think a\ntradition of reflective study, of flexible rather than dogmatic\ninterpretation, is a good thing.  I think that with such an attitude a\ncase could be made that you could have done as well starting with a\n1943 Captain America comic (or whatever the Babylonian equivalent\nwould have been).\n-- \nJim Perry   perry@dsinc.com   Decision Support, Inc., Matthews NC\nThese are my opinions.

John E. King (king@ctron.com) posts a whopping one liner:\n\n * "The modern theory of evolution is so inadequate that it deserves to be *\n *  treated as a matter of faith." -- Francis Hitching                     *\n\n  I have a few points to make about the above posting.\n\n    1. Science is not based on and does not consist of "quotes" from either\n    real or alleged experts.  Critical reasoning, evidence and (if possible)\n    experimentation are necessary.  Creationists frequently display a massive\n    confusion about this by merely quoting both non-experts and experts alike\n    (some of the latter quotes are in fact false) and steadfastly refusing to\n    follow any kind of rigorous scientific procedure.  This strongly suggests\n    that (a.) their claims completely lack any scientific merit and (b.) they\n    are aware of this fatal deficiency.  Of course, you may not actually be a\n    creationist and this may not be your real intent.\n\n    2. You have failed to identify Hitching and the surrounding context of his\n    statement.  Why is that?  If Hitching is a scientific illiterate then the\n    quote would merely display his profound ignorance of evolutionary biology.\n    Creationists are frequently known to quote real scientists out of context\n    and to fabricate statements that they subsequently attribute to legitimate\n    scientists.  Of course, you may not actually be a creationist and this may\n    not be your real intent.\n\n    3. Evidence supporting the alleged inadequacies of "the modern theory of\n    evolution" would be a much more powerful argument than a contextless one\n    line quote from an unidentified nobody.  It is also important to note that\n    disproving biological evolution does not automatically prove some alternate\n    claims any more that disproving that the earth is shaped like a hockey puck\n    proves that it is a hyperbolic paraboloid.  Creationists seem rather fond\n    of diving (head first) into this logical fallacy.  Of course, you may not\n    actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent.\n\n    4. Since evolution is central to virtually all of modern science, an attack\n    on evolution (either the fact or the theory) really represents an attack on\n    science.  While the theory will unquestionably continue to evolve (B^) the\n    fact of evolution will not ever go away.  Creationists lost the battle long\n    ago (more than 100 years in fact) but are simply too willfully ignorant and\n    irrational to acknowledge the fact.  Of course, you may not actually be a\n    creationist and you may not really be that ignorant.\n\n\nWarren Kurt vonRoeschlaub (kv07@IASTATE.EDU) asks:\n\n * Neither I, nor Webster's has ever heard of Francis Hitchings.  Who is he? *\n\n  I, like Hitchings, am not to be found in Webster's B^).  Francis Hitchings\nis a scientifically illiterate creationist (or perhaps he is just playing the\npart of one) who wrote a quite ignorant book attacking evolution ("The Neck of\nthe Giraffe").  In that publication he quotes a creationist (Jean Sloat Morton)\nusing the standard invalid creationist probability argument that proteins could\nnot have formed by chance.  Thus not only confusing abiogenesis with evolution\n(the two are quite independent) but also concluding with a "non sequitur" (i.e.\nthe conclusion "does not follow"). [pp 70-71]  Hitchings also misquotes Richard\nLewontin in an effort to support creationism. [pp 84]\n\n  Hitchings book was reviewed by National Park Service ecologist David Graber\nin the Los Angeles Times (and repeated in the Oregonian).  The article was\ntitled "`Giraffe' sticks scientific neck out too far".  Excerpts include :\n\n  "Francis Hitchings is not a biologist."  "He goes after Darwin like Mark\n  Antony after Brutus.  He flips from scientific reasoning to mysticism and\n  pseudo-science with the sinuosity of a snake-oil salesman."  "He suggests\n  a mystical `organizing principle' of life, using the similarity of organs\n  in different creatures as evidence [sic]."\n\n  Note that the last statement above is actually evidence FOR evolution not\nagainst it.  If John E. King is quoting from this reviewed book it wouldn't\nsurprise me much.  It's also interesting that King had nothing to add (i.e.\nhe only posted a quote).
Once the Rushdie situation exploded into the media, the Muslim voice on\nthe matter of the book was effectively restricted to short video bytes\nshowing\nthe dramatic highlights of Muslim demonstrations. For every twenty or so\nnewspaper, magazine articles, interviews etc. supporting Rushdie, there\nwould\nappear one Muslim voice. This person was usually selected based on how\ndramatic and incoherent he was, not on his knowledge of Islam or the\nsituation at the time. This approx. twenty to one ratio continued\nthroughout the escalation of the crisis, with Rushdie in the central\nspotlight as the man of the moment, the valiant defender of everyman's\nright to free speech decoupled from responsibility. (As an aside, it's\ninteresting that while the hue and cry about freedom of speech went up,\nsome books (defaming certain ethnic and religious groups) continued\nto be banned here. It was felt that they injured the sensibilities of these\n\ngroups and presented a false image which could promote feelings of \nhate towards these groups. For Muslims this kind of double standard \nwas annoying.)\n\nRushdie saw this spotlight as a golden opportunity to lash out at\n"organized"\nIslam, and he did so with admirable verbal skill. The only kind of Islam\nwhich Rushdie finds palatable is what he calls a "secular" Islam - an Islam\nseparated from it's Qur'an, it's Prophet, God, its legislation, and most\nimportantly from any intrusion into any political arena. Fine - Rushdie\nmade\nhis views known - the Muslim's made their anger at his book known. The\nscale of the whole affair erupted into global proportions - it was, by this\ntime,\nalready a political situation - affecting governments as well as\nindividuals.\nThe situation was a serious one, with far-reaching political implications.\nAt the centre of this turmoil was Rushdie, throwing fuel on the fire -\nengaged\nin a personal crusade that made him oblivious to any sense of caution.\n\nNow you may feel that the person in the centre of a worldwide storm such as\n\nthis has no responsibility, has no reason to exercise restraint of any\nkind, has no\nobligation to perhaps step back momentarily out of the spotlight till\nmatters calm down. Perhaps you even feel that he is justified in "boldly"\ndefying the anger of all those who dare to take umbrage at his literary\nwork, no matter what insult they find within it. Perhaps you see him as\na kind of secular "heroic Knight",mounted on the his media steed,\n doing battle with the "dragon" of Islamic "fundamentalism".\n\nWell Khomeini saw him as a disingeneous author who \ngrew up in a Muslim atmosphere, knew well what Muslim's hold dear, \nwho wrote a book which mischievously uses certain literary conventions\nto slander, insult, and attack Islam and its most notable personalities -\nwho, when\nfaced with a situation that became a worldwide crisis, continued with\nhis mischief in the world stage of the media - who, even after people were\ninjured and killed because of the magnitude and emotion of the situation,\ncontinued his mischief, instead of having the good sense to desist.\nKhomeini saw the crisis as mischief making on a grand scale, mischief\nmaking that grew in scale as the scale of the crisis enlarged. The deaths\nof Muslims around the world and Rushdie's continued media mischief\neven after this, was the triggering factor that seemed to\ndecide Khomeini on putting a stop to the mischief. The person at the\ncentre of all these events was Rushdie - he was the source of the\ncontinuing mischief - all media support, government support was\njust that - support. The source was Rushdie (and his publishers, who\nwere nothing short of ecstatic at the publicity and were very happy\nto see Rushdie constantly in the media). The Islamic rulings that\ndeal with people who engage in this kind of grand-scale mischief\nmaking, was applied to Rushdie.\n\n\nI have made no attempts at justification, only at explanation. "Image" is\nthe chief concern of Muslim 'apologists' for Islam and for Rushdie.\nIf Muslims willingly relegated themselves to becoming a sub-culture\nwithin a larger secular culture, such that the secular principles and laws\nhad precedence over the laws of Islam - then I have no doubt that Islam\nwould then be thought to have a good "image" (Principally because it would\nby and large reflect the secular image). A "good image" usually means " be\nmore\nlike me".\n\nYour attempts at TOTALLY exonerating Rushdie reflect exactly the attitude\nthat\nresulted in the polarization brought about by the crisis.
Once again, this posting has been delayed for about a week by falling\nbetween some software cracks...\n\n\n[Here follows an introduction to the controversial incident, and an\n apologetic explanation purporting to show why it couldn't actually\n have happened.  The historicity of the episode doesn't matter to what\n follows]\n\nI don't know whether I'm quoting Gregg or Zakaria below.  Anyway, back\nto current affairs,\n\n\nAmong others; this incident is not something Rushdie or Watt or anyone\nelse dug up from nowhere, it is a well known story, a myth if you\nwill, known (according to Umar Khan) to "Every Muslim school boy and\ngirl", and so presumably to Rushdie, and to Gibreel Farishta.\n\n\nYes, this is what writing fiction is all about.  Rushdie was writing\nabout a crisis of faith, and chose this myth to present it, by placing\nthe actor "Gibreel" in the role of the angel whose name he took.\nRushdie was not writing a history or theology book, and nowhere claims\nor implies that this is what actually happened.  It's somewhat like\nstories woven around the relationship between Jesus and the reformed\nprostitute Mary Magdalene (another myth).  Or those referring to the\nArthurian mythos, or the Grail legend, or the Wandering Jew, or dozens\nof others.  If you can stand to read the work of a blasphemer,\nconsider Salman Rushdie's children's book "Haroun and the Sea of\nStories" for an idea of the way a storyteller -- a specific\nstoryteller -- works with existing story lines.\n\n\nNo.  Muhammad's [Mahound's] integrity is not really impugned in this\npart of the story, and there's no reason to think this was Rushdie's\nintent: Gibreel, as the archangel, produces the verses (divine and\nsatanic), though he doesn't know their provenance.  It is not implied\n(in a straight reading) that Muhammad influences them:\n\n    " *Not my voice* I'd never know such words I'm no classy speaker\n    never was never will be but this isn't my voice it's a Voice.\n      Mahound's eyes open wide, he's seeing some kind of vision,\n    staring at it, oh, that's right, Gibreel remembers, me.  He's\n    seeing me.  My lips moving, being moved by.  What, whom?  Don't\n    know, can't say.  Nevertheless, here they are, coming out of my\n    mouth, up my throat, past my teeth: the Words.\n      Being God's postman is no fun, yaar.\n      Butbutbut: God isn't in this picture.\n      God knows whose postman I've been."\n\nIt's ambiguous: is Mahound somehow manipulating Gibreel?  Is it Satan?\nOr something else?  The answer is not given.\n\nTo be sure, the question is raised.  This novel explores faith and the\nrole of revelation in religion, among other things.  Addressing loss\nof faith implicitly raises questions about the truth of revelation,\nbut this novel proposes no answers, at least not directly.  The very\nexistence of a newsgroup named "alt.atheism" raises the same\nquestions, more forcefully, and does propose some answers, which is\nthe real relevance.  If Rushdie's mild fictional exploration is "filth\nand lies", and he "asked for what he got", are we next on the fatwa\nlist?  (That's a rhetorical question, of course.)\n-- \nJim Perry   perry@dsinc.com   Decision Support, Inc., Matthews NC\nThese are my opinions.  For a nominal fee, they can be yours.
Riddle me this.  If a god(s) exist why on earth should we grovel?  Why on earth\nshould we give a damm at all?  What evidence do you have that if such a\ncreature(s) exist it deserves anything beyond mild admiration or sheer\nhatred for what it/they have done in the past (whichever god(s) you care to\npick).  That is assuming any records of their actions are correct.\n\nReligon offers a bliss bubble of self contained reality which is seperate\nfrom the physical world.  Any belief system can leave you in such a state\nand so can drugs.  God(s) are not a requirement.  Only if you remove such\nuseless tappestry can you build a set of morals to build a society upon.\nIt is that or keep on exterminating those who don't believe (or converting\nthem).\n  - Eric\n\nNEW VIRUSES:
That's fascinating.  I take it that you're expressing skepticism\nat the idea that those ignorant savages could have influenced\nthe Constitution of the people who stole their continent.  You\ncould be right, but it sounds plausible to me.  Is there any\nreason that you dismiss it out-of-hand?  Here's some more:\n\n   Recent scholarship has shown that in the mid-1700s Indians were not\n   only invited to participate in the deliberations of our "founding\n   fathers," but that the Great Binding Law of the Iroquois Confederacy\n   arguably became the single most important model for the 1754 Albany\n   Plan of Union, and later the Articles of Confederation and the\n   Constitution.  That this would be absent from our school texts,\n   and from history, and from media is not surprising given the devotion\n   Americans feel to our founding myth: Great men gathered to express\n   a new vision that has withstood the test of time.  If it were\n   revealed that Indians had a role in it, imagine the blow to the\n   American psyche.\n   ...\n      By 1754, when most of these men and others gathered to creat the\n   Albany Plan of Union, the first try at confederation, they invited\n   forty-two members of the Iroquois Grand Council to serve as advisors\n   on confederate structures.  Benjamin Franklin freely acknowledged\n   his interest in the Iroquois achievement in a famous speech at\n   Albany Congress: "It would be a strange thing...if six nations\n   of ignorant savages[sic] should be capable of forming such a union\n   and be able to execute it in such a manner that it has subsisted\n   for ages and appears indissoluble, and yet that a like union should\n   be impractical for ten or a dozen English colonies."\n      According to Grinde, Franklin convened meetings of Iroquois chiefs\n   and congressional delegates in order to "hammer out a plan that he\n   acknowedged to be similar to the Iroquois Confederacy."\n\nGrinde is Professor Donald Grinde,Jr., of the University of California\nat Riverside whose book _The Iroquois and the Founding Fathers of the\nAmerican Nation_ addresses this issue.
See, I told you there was an atheist mythology, thanks for proving my\npoint.
Yes, atheists tend to claim self control and self ownership. Are you saying\nthat theists claim to not have self control? I don't think atheists are\n"dominantly arrogant." They don't claim some god that has supremacy over\nall of mankind. Now this claim would be arrogant, but atheists don't claim \nit. Most atheists do claim to own themselves. I think any disagreement with\nthis claim of self ownership would be supremely arrogant.

I just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism.\n#The point is that theism is *a* factor.\n\nThat's your claim; now back it up.  I consider your argument as useful\nas the following:  Belief is strongly correlated with fanaticism.  Therefore\nbelief is *a* factor in fanaticism.  True, and utterly useless.  (Note, this\nis *any* belief, not belief in Gods)\n\n#>Gullibility,\n#>blind obedience to authority, lack of scepticism, and so on, are all more\n#>reliable indicators.

Please note that especially in the\n#field of theism, the leaders believe what they say.\n\nIf you believe that, you're incredibly naive.\n\n#>Now, *some*\n#>brands of theism, and more precisely *some* theists, do tend to fanaticism,\n#>I grant you.  To tar all theists with this brush is bigotry, not a reasoned\n#>argument - and it reads to me like a warm-up for censorship and restriction\n#>of religious freedom.  Ever read Animal Farm?\n#>\n#That's a straw man. And as usually in discussions with you one has to\n#repeat it: Read what I have written above: not every theism leads to\n#fanatism, and not all fanatism is caused by theism. The point is,\n#there is a correlation, and it comes from innate features of theism.\n\nNo, some of it comes from features which *some* theism has in common\nwith *some* fanaticism.    Your last statement simply isn't implied by\nwhat you say before, because you're trying to sneak in "innate features\nof [all] theism".  The word you're groping for is "some".\n\n#Gullibility, by the way, is one of them.\n\nNo shit, Sherlock.  So why not talk about gullibility instead of theism,\nsince it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have, as opposed\nto the case you are trying to make?\n\n#And to say that I am going to forbid religion is another of your straw\n#men. Interesting that you have nothing better to offer.\n\nI said it reads like a warm up to that.  That's because it's an irrational\nand bogus tirade, and has no other use than creating a nice Them/Us \nsplit in the minds of excitable people such as are to be found on either\nside of church walls.\n\n#>|>(2)  Define "irrational belief".  e.g., is it rational to believe that\n#>|>     reason is always useful?\n#>|>\n#>|\n#>|Irrational belief is belief that is not based upon reason.

It's still begging the question, however.  And though\nthat certainly is allowed, it's not rational.  And you claiming to be\nrational and all.\n\nAt the risk of repeating myself, and hearing "we had that before" [we\ndidn't hear a _refutation_ before, so we're back.

Have a look at the discussion of the\n#axiom of choice. And further, one can evaluate axioms in larger systems\n#out of which they are usually derived. "I exist" is derived, if you want\n#it that way.\n#\n#Further, one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms.\n# \n#what is it you are trying to say?\n\nThat at some point, people always wind up saying "this datum is reliable" \nfor no particular reason at all.  Example: "I am not dreaming".\n\n#>|Compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of\n#>|their demands makes the whole thing not only irrational but antirational.\n#>\n#>I can't agree with this until you are specific - *which* theism?  To\n#>say that all theism is necessarily antirational requires a proof which\n#>I suspect you do not have.\n#>\n# \n#Using the traditonal definition of gods. Personal, supernatural entities\n#with objective effects on this world. Usually connected to morals and/or\n#the way the world works.\n\nIMO, any belief about such gods is necessarily irrational.  That does\nnot mean that people who hold them are in principle opposed to the exercise of\nintelligence.  Some atheists are also scientists, for example.\n\n#>|The affinity to fanatism is easily seen. It has to be true because I believe\n#>|it is nothing more than a work hypothesis. However, the beliefs say they are\n#>|more than a work hypothesis.\n#>\n#>I don't understand this.  Can you formalise your argument?\n# \n#Person A believes system B becuase it sounds so nice. That does not make\n#B true, it is at best a work hypothesis. However, the content of B is that\n#it is true AND that it is more than a work hypothesis. Testing or evaluating\n#evidence for or against it  therefore dismissed because B (already believed)\n#says it is wronG/ a waste  of time/ not possible. Depending on the further\n#contents of B Amalekites/Idolaters/Protestants are to be killed, this can\n#have interesting effects.\n\nPeculiar definition of interesting, but sure.  Now show that a belief\nin gods entails the further contents of which you speak.   Why aren't my \ncatholic neighbours out killing the protestants, for example?   Maybe they \ndon't believe in it.  Maybe it's the conjunction of "B asserts B" and\n"jail/kill dissenters" that is important, and the belief in gods is\nentirely irrelevant.  It certainly seems so to me, but then I have no\naxe to grind here.
Cute characterization Bill; however, there is no inconsistency between \nthe two statements.  Even if one believes that religion is "primitive, \nsimple-minded and unscientific, anti-intellectual and childish", one\ncan still hold the view that religion also adds an unnecessary level of\ncomplexity to the explanation.  The ideas themselves don't have to be\ncomplex before being excised by Occam's Razor, they only have to add \nunnecessarily to the overall complexity of the description.\n\n\nI think the non-essential part of an explanatory system is one that\nadds no predictive capability to the system.\n\n\nHuh?\n\n ^^^^^\nWatch it, your Freudian Slip is showing
