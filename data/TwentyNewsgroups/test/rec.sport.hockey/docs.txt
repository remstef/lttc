Heh... Try the rec.autos.sport FAQ. They are always calling ESPN to complain.\nI'm sure you could find the number for ABC there too, as many west-coast \nviewers were compaining about how something as boring as hockey cut into\nthe Long Beach GP. =)\n\n\nWere you (and several of the other people here it seems) asleep the day\n"contracts" were explained? ASPN has a piece of paper saying it MUST\nshow that baseball game if it happens. Many businesses payedd money to\nhave their commercials run during a baseball game. This is a business,\nnot your own personal video servant.\n\n\nMaybe you should put that anger into something positive. For example, I saw\nads for the new Dodge both on the ESPN and KBL broadcasts. Why not write to\nDodge saying that "thanks to the ads run during the STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS, \nyou will now concider their products in the future. They love to hear stuff\nlike that and in the future will be more willing to buy commercial time\nfor hockey games, giving ESPN (and other networks) more incentive to carry\ngames (just one example)\n\nCome on people, as great as we think it is, Hockey does not leapfrog the\n"big three" overight.
The problem is that (by no fault of ESPN) ongoing games are not\ncovered 'til the final horn sounds.  With two channels, SCNY and SCA,\nlate-finishing games (up to Pacific time) and overtimes elsewhere will\nkick in at the end of local coverage.  If SCNY is blocked by the Mets,\nthere is still some hockey on SCA (SCNY Plus).\n\nWith an ESPN 2, the current situation would be alleviated.\n\ngld

His name is Clint Malarchuk.  I'm not sure what he does now but I've heard\nhe's an extra in slasher films.
According to the recent TSN report Peter Puck is not paying any interest\non the Treasury Branch loans.  That's a lot of green.\n\n\nAgain, according to TSN, virtually everything that Peter Puck has already \nhas liens against it.  Of course we can't really be sure of this. \n\n\nThe Oiler rationale regarding the renegotiation of player contracts is\nthat a deal is a deal.  Sather has spouted this repeatedly.  Pocklinton\nhas a contract with Northlands until 1999.  A deal is a deal.  Perhaps\nif he included the income he has received from his sale of assets (players\nsuch as Gretzky) and the income he has received in expansion fees with\nhis revenues he wouldn't be losing money.  He has admitted pulling this\nmoney out of the Oiler franchise to put into his other businesses. \n\n\nI think that Pocklington has received ample provincial subsidization.  \nI can't really blame him for going after municipal subsidization but \nhe is certainly not entitled to it.  Pocklington has "sucked" revenue\nout of the Oilers in order to prop up his failing business interests.\nPocklington is not to be trusted.  I doubt very much that any Oiler\nteam will ever again make the playoffs under Pocklington's stewardship.\nAs soon as a player shows himself to be a competent NHL'er and expects\nto be paid accordingly he is shipped off for younger players and or\ndraft picks.\n\n\n--

Yes, Yes, I can see it now >>>> all those Sabre fans FINALLY taking\ntheir Sabre sweaters out of the moth balls and proudly wearing them.\nAfter 9 years of playoff frustration and being up 3 games to nil\nI guess it is a pretty good bet.    BUT there has not been a team\nthat has come back from an 0-3 deficit since 1975 - could this be\nthe year.   (Don't throw out the moth balls yet)
I'd like to add that I think Canadian hockey fans like Don because his kind of hockey (the hockey he promotes in his TV appearances) is the kind that they think used to get played in the old 6 team NHL. So there's a kind of nostagia for the old days, before expansion, the Soviet series, Gretzky and even Bobby Orr, when guys weren't afraid to take a hit, nobody floated and defensemen played defence. Who cares that that probably never really existed, the myth is still around in Canada and all the European in\n\n\n\nfluence on the game has diminished it in some people's eyes.\n\nPersonally, I'd like to add before I get flamed, I love the fast-paced "European" game and think Don Cherry is a bit of an idiot. I have to say that I missed him when I was living in the States, though. He is entertaining, even if you end up throwing your popcorn at the screen when he's on.\n-- \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n         \nI stand by all the misstatements that I've made.\n		-- Vice President Dan Quayle to Sam Donaldson, 8/17/89
During the first three games of the Pens-Devils series, I have been\nimpressed time and time again by the pure talent of the Pens.  Jagr,\nMacEachern and Barrasso have been especially fun to watch.  But, one\nelement of this team which goes unnoticed seems to be Scotty Bowman.\n\nDespite Brooks' lunatic comments, and despite the Devils' line changing\nadantage in last night's game, Bowman has been able to keep his cool and\nkeep the Devils in the dark.  Granted, the hell-dwellers had the Pens\nbottled up for a while last night, but Bowman was eventually able to\nconfigure his line-up to get the job done.  His ability to throw out new\nlooks and strategies at a moments notice is incredible.\n\nBowman seems to have a terrific ability of reading his players on an\nindividual basis.  Last night, for instance, he realized that the speed\nof Jagr, Straka, and MacEachern was throwing the Devils off balance.  As\na result, Straka received many more shifts than average; Jagr played\nalmost the entire game (he was always on the puck), and MacEachern\nscored a goal, while complementing Jagr many times throughout the night.\nHis ability to commit to one player in crucial situations is\ncommendable, especially when a coach of such a talented team might\nsimply rely on the overall talent to dominate, and to bring about\nsuccess.
I don't "notice" refs and linesmen until the playoffs come around, and\nyes I have to agree that Stewart called the *two* worst games I've seen\nso far (Mtl-Quebec game 1, and last nights Toronto-Detroit game).\n\nWhat's the scoop on this guy? Is he the latest incarnation of\nKERRY FRASER??? Just because you are boneheadedly stubborn doesn't\nmake you a good ref!!! Making the right call does...\n\nMy votes for:\nBest Ref: Van Hellemond\nMost Improved: Koharski\nWorst: Paul Stewart\n\n(Oops, I don't really want to start a best/worst ref thread so don't\nfollow up ;-)
Again I assume this is not just flame bait by Roger, but actually a\ntruly held opinion.  \n\n\nThanks.  For speaking for all those who didn't feel it was important\nenough to say something themselves.  \n\nI wouldn't say that the letter clearly implies representation of the\nviews of a group that you belong to.  It represents a subset (that you\ndon't belong to) of a larger group (which you do, if only because this\nisn't a moderated group).\n\nLook, there are several ways to state an opposing viewpoint.  Three\nthat come to mind are as follows:\n\n1) Say it subtly.  Result: it may not be clear.\n2) Say it directly yet politely.  Result: probably it will spark some \n   interesting conversation.\n3) Say it directly and obnoxiously.  Result: validity goes right out\n   the window.\n\n\nYou realize that anything you say can, and most certainly will, be\nused against you.
If my powerplay was as bad as Montreal's, I'd be thanking Stewart for calling\nas few penalties as possible. Quebec's powerplay is lethal and it is to their\nadvantage to have a penalty-filled game where they can clean up with their\nsuperior powerplay. \n\nMontreal really lost that game (and game 2) because Patrick Roy is well on\nhis way to having another one of his trademark awful playoffs. The man is\ntruly overrated. Quebec has scored six goals on Roy and four, perhaps five, \nwere quite stoppable.

Hindsight's 20-20. Nobody expected Kisio to have his 2nd best career year.\n\n\nI didn't mean to imply that Gund's offer wasn't enough.  Gund's offer\nwas the right $, but too late in the season.  $2M offered in November\nlets Sather buy a replacement for Murphy *this* season and make the\nplayoffs *this* year. $2M in March doesn't help Sather with his\nimmediate objectives, doesn't help with long term objectives (only a\nprospect or draft pick does, and no way should the Sharks do that).\nHowever, getting back to what-if games, had Kisio been traded to\nChicago last year, then the Sharks go 0 for October, and maybe Gund\npanicks sooner in November. And here's another what-if twist: Chicago\nwould have had Kisio this season; they *never* go after Murphy in the\nfirst place because Kelly is having his *best* season (bigger guys in\nChicago). So Gund has no competition. So Ferriera, Sather, and Keenan\nall look like geniuses.\n\nA broken fax machine, and Ferriera, Keenan, and maybe Kingston\n(and maybe even Green) lose their jobs. Kind of makes you\nshiver doesn't it. :-)\n\nBottomline, for every black scenario any of you can concoct for\nKisio leaving, I can concoct an equally bright one.\n\n\nAre you serious?\n	- Let Ferierra go,\n	- fire Kingston (these last two basically mean that\n		Sharks are starting over again in terms of the\n		timetable to capture the Cup. As I've stated\n		frequently: 5 out 6 expansion teams had the same GM\n		from inception through Cup season)\n\n	- broadcast more home games than away games\n	- broadcast very few road Pacific and Mountain time games\n	- jack up my ticket prices from $27 to $38 in two years (not that I'm\n		going to pay 120 bucks for 3 seats. I'll probably next to the\n		virtual 107 folks)\n\n	- not tell me my priority #\n	- not let me sell my priority #\n	- in order for me to get the free jacket, force me to order my tickets\n		for next season before I get to select my section\n\n	- not let me park at the new arena after paying for their\n		privileged parking lot (which was sometimes full when\n		I got there) for 2 straight years.\n\nI've been a loyal ticket holder, since day 1 (literally) in spring of\n'90 when the team was announced.  and I'm not getting that loyalty\nreturned. Wirtz treats his fans far better by comparison. And\nPocklington with his cheap tix is the best owner of all.\n\n\nI know one isn't suppose to make negative comments on signatures, but\nwhat did us Oiler fans do to you to deserve the "Stay in Edmonton"\npart? I'd never wish the Kings to leave metro-LA; it's too much fun\nwatching the Shark's beat them.
Here we are with the Sabres up 2-0 to the Bruins and the Sabres' farm\nteam, the Rochester Amerks, on their way to the Calder Cup (urp!) and\nwhat kind of hockey coverage are we getting? The same Penguins/Devils\nevery other day crap that everyone else gets. What's worse, the\nSportsChannel coverage of the Islanders appears to be blocked out,\nsince we got CBA basketball last night, if you can believe it.  I\nassume the Sabres are demanding the SC blackout, not ESPN, since we\nare, unbelievably, usually considered part of the Islanders territory\n(MSG coverage of the Rangers is blacked out here). This despite being\na solid seven hours plus from Long Island.\n\nDoes anyone know what GRC is doing, besides putting their satellite\ndish up their ass and screwing my reception of channels 8, 10, and 13?\nDid Empire demand a fortune for the games? What about the games on\nFox37 (or whatever number it is there in Buffalo)? Has anyone phoned\nto complain (besides me)?\n\nGeorge

Here is something crossposted from the AHL mailing list:			\n\nIn a discussion between me and Chris Lerch, the subject of Springfield's \n1st round upset of the Providence Bruins\ncame up. Chris basically raised the possibility that the AHL \nhierarchy is biased in favor of the Indians. He noted that the offices\nfor the league are in Spring. and many ex-Indians are working for the AHL.\nFurthermore, he also informed me that back a few years ago in the Cup \nfinals between Roch and Spring, that the Amerks charged favoritism by the office\nand that:\n\n"...there were little questionable things liket he AHL president and\nstaff attending all games with the Springfield brass, including sitting\nin their box for the game in Springfield and, according to the Rochester\nmedia, openly cheering for Springfield."\n\nCertainly this is something that is quite serious if any of this\nis true. I don't know if this is anything more than whining on the\npart of the Amerks (they have pulled this sort of crap against the\nWings before) but if true, this is somthing that seriously raises\nquestions about President Jack Butterfield's leadership.\n\nBTW- This was posted with the permission of Chris
While watching the Penguins/Devils game last night, I saw the "slash" that\nBarrasso took on the neck.  This brought to mind the goaltender who had his\njugular vein cut by a skate.  I think he was a Sabre, but I'm not positive.\nDoes anyone remember/know his name?  What has happened to him since?  What\nabout the player whose skate cut the goalie?  Name?  Info?  Has this ever\nhappened before in a hockey game?   \n\nThanks,
(much mindless drivel deleted)\n\n\nQuestion to you Canadian folk:  is this University of New Brunswick a\nbranch campus of the Western Business School?  Seems like the same sort\nof rectal appendage belongs to both of them.
Bleep! Bleep! Bleep!  The Bruins lost AGAIN in O.T.  I can't stand it!\n\nAside from frustrated ravings, I must give Buffalo credit: they are making good \non most of their scoring opportunities, and are playing great defense.  Boston\nplayers can't seem to get control of the puck anywhere near the Buffalo net\nexcept for on rare occasions.  The Buffalo defense is also doing an excellent\njob clearing away rebounds.  Fuhr is playing great when the big save is needed\nbut he's also getting plenty of help.\nBoston has been playing rather well (better than would be indicated by the \nseries score of 3-0) but is lacking that extra drive in the earlier part of the \ngame.  As a result, Boston keeps leaving the ice at the end of the 1st period\n2 goals down.  This MUST stop if Boston is to have any hope of winning a single\ngame (the outlook for the Bruin's advancement to the second round are quite\nbleak).  IMHO, the Bruins NEED to score first.  If they can do that, they have\nan excellent chance of winning, since they have outplayed the Sabres in the \n2nd and 3rd periods.\n\n(The scary thing is that I'll be going to grad school in Buffalo next year.\n   I'll never cheer for the Sabres... You can't convert me... ^:)\n\n\nMTM3
The Isles picked one hell-of-a-time to get their first win all year after being\ndown after 2 periods. The Caps seemed to have the game in hand playing steady\ndefense and getting great goaltending from Tabaracci. The Isles power play\nphilosophy continues to be dump-and-chase which, except for boardaholics like\nFlatley, doesn't work against the Caps. I hope Al realizes this!! They have too\nmany talented finesse players, so why not carry the puck in and set-up??? If\nlast night's game is any omen, the Isles could be on their way to that ole\nchampionship form; COMING from behind late in a game. My advice to the Caps is\nto pounce on those Healy Rebounds. Flatley showed alot of heart by playing the\nlast period and overtime despite an almost swollen-shut left eye injury\nsuffered at the hands of Dale Hunter. Ray Ferraro has arrived just in time for\nthe playoffs showing the fiesty hustle that us Islander fans remember from an \nItalian from the past; JOHN TONELLI!!! It was Tonelli who won a similar game\nagainst the PENS in game 5 on the 82 playoffs. The Isles scored two late third\nperiod goals to send the game into OT tied at 3. In OT, Tonelli scored the game\nwinner to send the Isles to the next round. The Isles have lacked this tenacity\nfor years, but perhaps its BACK! It was good to see the Coliseum packed just\nlike the ole days!!! Good luck to the Isles the rest of the way!!!!!\n\nJohn Scialdone\nSCIALDONE@NSSDCA.GSFC.NASA.GOV
The goalie to whom you refer is Clint Malarchuk.  He was at\nthat time playing with the Sabres.  His team immediately prior\nto that was the Washington Capitals.  While he did recover and\ncontinue to play, I do not know his present whereabouts.
I have some advice for you, and some thoughts about\nyour hatred of the Minnesota North Stars:\n\n1. A real team like Toronto would not be moved, you are right,\n   just eliminated from the playoffs first round!\n2. Why stay in Minnesota when you can go to a college in\n   Western Ontario and actually take classes on map-reading\n   and the Artistry of BSing specifically set up for just you.\n3. Why should anyone love the Stars, when hating the Leafs\n   is so much better?\n4. Oh, I'm sorry.. well, maybe you can't understand my\n   big words.. next time I'll limit my vocabulary to words\n   like "get real team now" and "do not waste our time"\n5. Respond to this article. I love to laugh at your humor,\n   even though it it unintentional. I got a BIG kick out of\n   GO LEAFS GO.... go where?

Devorski unfortunately helped to taint an otherwise brilliant display\nby MacLean.  The Canucks tied up the Jets so tightly that I thought that\nthey were mailing them.\n\nBTW, Greg...next time, don't fall asleep in geography class, it's pretty\nsad when a fellow in Norway can spell Winnipeg properly and a guy in\nNorth America can't.\n\nOne more thing...how LONG has Vancouver been in the NHL?  How many\nchampionships do they have?  \n\nOh yeah...and I CAN go to the Arena and see not one, not two, but\n*six* championship banners hanging from the rafters.  3 Stanley Cup\nbanners, and 3 Avco Cup banners.  My NHL guide says that Vancouver has\nwon the Cup once (as many times as the rockin' town of Kenora has won it!)

ESPN had an advertise for Pens/Devils game 4. I don't know what the hell\n  they are trying to do, especially against NFL draft. Well I guess there goes\n  the NHL ratings for Sundays game.
"They're real and they're spectacular", the Blues shutout the Blackhawks in\nconsecutive playoff games. \n\nIf the Blues sweep the Hawks on Sunday, I will launch a broom onto the ice\nin the last seconds of the game. "Not that there's anything wrong with that."\n\nCurtis Joseph has been the "master of his own domain", and the Hawks have\nbeen shooting the puck like a bunch of "chuckers". Not even "Superman" could\nplay any better in goal. Joseph must have been eating his "cereal."\n\n"It's like a sauna in here" said a spectator about the hot atmosphere and\nthe wild crowd at the Arena.\n\nIt was "very refreshing" to see the Blues "double-dip" the Hawks.\n\nThe Hawks goons tried to "pick" on Hull, Janney, and Joseph but the Blues\nchecking line "nipped" those Hawks real well.\n\nThe fat "Yoyoma" will sing on Sunday, and the Hawks will head to the "beach".\nThe Hawks' trip back to Chicago will feel like a long "journey from Milan\nto Minsk"\n\nEnjoy Sunday's game with some Junior Mints and wash them down with a Snapple.\n\nJust a little fun.
The Sharks appear to be leaning toward picking Rob\n	Niedermayer, a center (his brother Scott (?) is a defenseman\n	picked by NJ a couple years ago).  They brought him in for a\n	physical/tryout a week or so ago. From what I have read\n	Niedermayer is the best skater in the draft, plays BOTH\n	offense and defense, and isn't afraid of physical play.\n	Defensively the Sharks are looking pretty good in terms of\n	defense prospects (Rathje, Sykora, Ragnarsson), and our\n	centers (Kisio et al) are getting old.\n\n	With all of the small players the Sharks have I justs CAN't\n	see them picking yet another small player like Kariya, he'd\n	just get bashed by the oppposition and get a separated \n	shoulder.

And you can bet that I wouldn't be the only one not belonging to the\nmoderated group if it was moderated by an anally-retentive little\ndullard like yourself. \n\n\nI hardly need you to presume to lecture me on how to communicate my points\nof view.  This "posting" that you have made is the second on the subject of\nthe NHL letter and you have yet to communicate your opinion on the matter.\nInstead you content yourself with flaming me.\n\n\nResult:\nMoronic little busy bodies like yourself take advantage of a perceived\nopportunity to post rules for others to live by. \n\n\nWell if using it "against" me means you are going to post something of\nsignificance then by all means go ahead.  I insist.  Otherwise why don't\nyou just go back to sleep or do whatever it is that you do when you are \nall by yourself...\n\n--

If ESPN pisses you off, call them - they do respond to calls. Last night I\ncalled when they said they were cutting to baseball and we couldn't see the\nsudden-death overtime for the BUffalo game. Apparently they received enough\ncalls so they waited for the overtime to finish before cutting away.\n\nTheir phone number is 203-585-2000
This is the price hockey fans have to pay for the mistake of leaving\nESPN 5 or 6 years ago...it will take time to correct for that mistake.\n\nBut returning to ESPN was the correct decision last year...by next\ntime, we may have the potential for Sportschannel and ESPN to really\ncompete to offer better coverage and be forced to deliver on it.
Well, Your Majesty, ;^), couldn't you just picture it?  Cherry starts doing\nhis first post-game interview with Barrasso;  Tommy gives him that little look\n(like somebody crapped on his shoe) and then proceeds to give Don a\ntonsilectomy with his Sher-Wood.  Now that you could put on pay-per-view!\n\nHope you had a good laugh!
I'm glad Grant Fuhr will never be as over-confident after two wins\nas you are...it takes four wins to defeat an opponent...each tougher\nto obtain than the previous one.  Buffalo is off to a good start...\nFuhr is proving the Fuhr-bashers wrong, but Boston is an awfully\ngood team.

I watched the game Germany-Czechs in WC today...and i was astonished about\nthe behaviour of the German audience!\nThe German team got a few penalties in the last period and the crowd went\ngrazy!

I guess the Canadian referee (one of the\nIsostar-bros ;) gave the German team a penalty for that, but it didn't help\nmuch.\nI guess the Germans just are proud over their Nazi-Kill-'em-All-Everyone-\nBut-Us-Germans-Sucks attitude...they just seem to have that kind of attitude\nin every possible sport (remember the European champs in Stockholm in soccer)\nIt really pisses me off!\nI do not mean that every single German has this attitude that sucks, but \nmost of them seem to do...
As far as I can tell, he was right next to Bassen!\n\nDon't you guys love it when people like me come out of the woodwork...8^)
Why would Pollin want to move the Caps, because I think he\nowns the Cap Centre.  I know they don't sell out all of their \ngames, but they draw a lot more than the Bullets.  If you\nhad the situation that Abe had, would you move if you were\nguaranteed that anyone who went to the games would have to \npark at the stadium, because there has been nothing within\na half mile, until the recent construction in\nthe area.\n   Can they win a game in OT again.\n       Rich

Don't let this confuse anybody.  The Winnipeg Jets have never won the\nStanley Cup (or even come that close).  These Stanley Cup championships\ngo back a LONG way to about the turn of the century.  The Winnipeg\nVictorias won one or more of these Cups- the Jets didn't win any of\nthem.\n\nCan you think of anything more irrelevant to argue about a playoff\nseries going on today than who won more Stanley Cups around the turn\nof the century??\n\nLets face facts.  The Canucks are leading the series 3-1.  The Canucks\ndominated the Jets in their season series.  The Canucks did better in\nthe regular season than Winnipeg.  Who is the better team?  I think\nthat the facts show that Vancouver is better than Winnipeg.
Here are the ones I can remember offhand:\n\n     KDKA    1020 AM   Pittsburgh Penguins\n     WABC     770 AM   New Jersey Devils\n     WBBM     780 AM   Chicago Blackhawks\n     WJM (?)  720 AM   Detroit Redwings\n     KMOX    1120 AM   St. Louis Blues\n\nAre the Flyers on 1210?\nThat's all I can think of.
Yeah I think we're used to it by now. (even if some of us do change our\n.sigs to root for our second favorite teams :-)\n\n\nI'll be happy if they win it before I get out of school. (the way it's going\nI may be here saying Piled Higher and Deeper before long)\n\n\nI have a feeling that alot of people out there may not like this statement\nbut......\nby far the worst "band  wagon" fans are the PIT fans (at least at the present).\nCase in Point -- I know a guy who just came to Hockey Hell(TM) from Pitt U.\nHim - "How 'bout the Pens? The're F-ing awesome"\nMe - "Yeah but beating up on the Devils doesn't mean alot. Wait until\n	they meet Boston and/or Detroit in the Playoffs start."\nHim - "When do the Playoffs start?"\nMe - "Uhhhh. They started a week ago."\n\nI'm not saying that this is true of all the Waddlers fans but there seems to \nbe alot of them floating around who really know nothing about hockey except\nthat they're newly beloved Waddlers are the best team in the game right now\nand when they're not the best team those fans will disappear into the woodwork.\n\nJohn\nFlames >> dev/null\nSerious comments welcomed.\n"Eat the Rich"
What about including points?  Probably no goals (at least against\nopponents) but there have been several assists given.
^^^^^^^^ \n\nIn four of the five games Finns have played, the goalie has been chosen\nthe best player of the opposing team. (In the fifth, the finnish goalie, \nKetterer was elected the best Finn) Has this to do with the goalies \nhaving good days in these games, or are the finnish players just lousy\nscorers???\n\nAnyway, quite few goals have been scored in these games in generally\n(the exception of course being Canada vs. Italy).  It looks like the\ngoalies are getting too good.  Is this due to their equipment getting\nbigger, so they cover more (their gloves, e.g. seem to be much bigger\nnow than they were some years ago).\n\nAnybody know if the rules on goalie equipment has changed this way????\n\n\nMikko Wihervaara

Have the rules for goalies' equipment changed? It seems that e.g. glove\nhas become bigger and bigger all the time (and pads too), and the goalies are\nwearing "over size" jerseys. Am I dreaming? If you watch old photos or\nfilms let say about ten years back, I think the difference is quite obvious.\nWho is an expert on this, please let me know. (Or have the goalies become\nbigger?)
Whoa.  What you are effectively doing is implying that if a player plays\nreally well, he 'stores up' mistakes that can be used at a later time.  Ths\nis not so.  Roy is the 'villain', as you so succinctly put it, because he\nallowed a very cheap goal.  If you think Roy outplayed Hextall, perhaps you\nshould get a tape of the game and watch the first 7-8 minutes of the third\nperiod.  NHL goaltenders _make_ some great saves.  If they did not, they\nwould not be in the NHL in the first place.  I do not expect any particular\ngoalie to be able to make the great saves all of the time, even though they\nare occasionally required.  However, when it comes to a routine shot like\nSakic's, especially at such a crucial time in a game, I don't think there \nare any legitimate excuses. \n\n\nI am not arguing that Hextall was brilliant.  I am arguing is that a\nrelatively weak wrist shot from the outside of the circle shold not result \nin a goal. \n\n\nIn a one-goal game with less than a minute to go there is no such thing as\n'just the 1 goal'.  I have not defended Dionne for taking the penalty\neither...in fact I think it was a boneheaded move.  But it led to _one_ goal\nonly, and Montreal had a _two_ goal lead.  My main concern is the second \ngoal.\n\n\nWhat you say about the skaters is absolutely true.  But realize that the \ngame was effectively *won*.  You could watch any hockey game (in fact, you\ncould watch any sporting event period) and spend hours discussing the 'what\nif's' w.r.t. missed opportunities.  They are not important when the final\nresult is decided.  If I get the time soon, I'll watch the game again and\nemail you a list of lucky Montreal bounces and a list of Quebec offensive\nscrewups.  Montreal was _leading_ with a minute to go.  The goalie\nis the last line of defence, and I will grant that extra attention is\nfocussed on him, sometimes without justification.  But Roy gave up a *lousy*\ngoal, and a team cannot afford such a goal.\n\n\n\nWHO CARES?  Of what value is it to justify one lousy play with a totally\nunrelated lousy play?  I could do a Hextall critique if you'd like.  But if\nyou're going to assess his performance, keep in mind that he made the key\nsaves at the key times.\n\n\nFor the record, I did not say that Roy was not one of the top goaltenders in\nthe league.  In fact, I agree that he is.\n\n                            \nI assume you are referring to me.  However, I have pointed out that I think\nthe loss can be blamed on Roy.  I have not said he sucks, nor do I think I've\nmade any other 'derogatory comments'.  If you regard objective\n(and informed, FYI) observations as derogatory, I really can't help you.
They could put on a Quebec-Montreal game.\n\nTalk a bout areivalry!\nopps rivalry..\n\nroland
Good point. Not only baseball but local NBA basketball games took\nprecedence over any SCA's NHL playoff coverage.
No, Fuhr's 5 rings out sparkle Errey's. And doesn't Bob have 2 rings?
Caps/Isles Fans,\n\nAnyone interested in catching the games from Nassau\nColiseum (hopefully there will be another) can catch\nthe game at North Carolina's Original Sports Bar in\nChapel Hill.  I'm pretty sure they carry HTS as well.\nThey had all three games on at the same\ntime last night.  This is the only place I know to\ncatch all of the Stanley Cup action.
It was NOT Krupp's skate.  Krupp was defending against Steve Tuttle,\nof the Blues.  They both sort of tripped and fell toward Malarchuk,\nand Tuttle's skate came perilously close to cutting (but actually just\nmissed) the jugular.  Malarchuk immediately fell to the ice, hands at\nhis neck, blood on the ice.\n\nHe'd been suffering from it for over a decade.  He just wasn't\ndiagnosed for it until he didn't sleep for ten days and decided to\nhave some alcohol to help him sleep.  Unfortunately, he'd just been\nput on ulcer medicine a few days earlier.  It's amazing he lasted as\nlong as he did.  OCD sufferers stop distinguishing the line between\nreality and imagination, or fail to accept that something they've\nchecked is OK now.  For example, an OCD sufferrer can wash his hands\nover and over and still think they're dirty.  He might check the oven\nten times to be sure it's turned off.  He might see a movie about\nsomething and automatically assume the situation is the same for his\nown life.  Malarchuk has dramatically decreased the medicine he takes,\nbut still needs it.  He went off it this past winter and had a bad OCD\nepisode and I think was in the hospital for a couple days.  (He felt\nit slowed his reflexes, so he tried to go without).  In any event, he\nis alive and well and living in San Diego, while playing with the\nGulls (IHL).  \n\n\nAnd Tuttle is no longer with the Blues, but I don't know where he is.\nPossibly in the IHL, but you'd best ask a Blues fan.

Ok, Buffalo fans.  I am a Red Wings fan, but am amazed at how the Sabres are\nbeating up on the Bruins.  Is there any reason for this?  Is it Grant Fuhr or\nMogilny and Lafontaine?  I would like to hear from you since I do not know much\nabout the Sabres.
Sorry Mike! What defensemen would the Wings be willing to give up for Beezer?
While I agree that Lemieux deserves the Hart, it is far from a "no-brainer". \nThe Hart trophy goes to the player most valuable to his team, not to the best\nplayer in the league. So your above arguement is really worthless. \n\nThe Pens without Mario are still a damn good hockey team. The Leafs without \nGilmour would have been fighting Tampa Bay for the 3rd pick. \n\nLike I said, Mario deserves it, IMHO. But it is a very close race and a \nGilmour victory would not surprise me. I dislike Doug Gilmour with a passion, \nbut I must concede that he is extremely valuable to the Leafs.
Bowman is in the Hockey Hall of Fame as a coach already...and unlike\nGil Stein...he didn't get their by stacking the Board of Directors! -)\n\n\nBowman is the genius...Johnson isn't.  Bowman is a great coach...Johnson,\na very good one.  However, Bowman is really not a modern coach, and\nPatrick's solution of having him only run the team on game days, and\ndelegate most of the day-to-day responsibity to the assistants is\na shrewd managerial decision on Patrick's part.
He's a Canadian "thing". Former coach of the Boston Bruins and Colorado\nRockies. From the summaries that get posted I gather that his ongoing beef\nthis year has been the conventional wisdom that Canadian hockey is doomed\nto be second or third rate behind the perceived emergence of the U.S.\nand European programs.\n\n\nAfter he left the Rockies, he got a job with CBC's Hockey Night in Canada\nand hasn't looked back since. Actually, he did work for CBC at least\non playoff season after the Rockies were eliminated.\n\n\nI'd say it's a combination of flame bait and serious journalism. The closest\nthing you'll find to Cherry in the U.S. is Stan Fischler, a self-described\nhockey maven. The similarities are that they both say things that get\npeople upset. The difference is that Cherry knows the game and Fischler\ndoesn't.\n\n\nDon's a character. If he were completely rational and noncontroversial\nhe wouldn't have a job. By some definitions, he could be called an ass.\nBut then some people feel the same about Mike Lang, another character that\nI wish would get wider exposure (only one national telecast last year).
Gerald, look at what happened to the Stars; they are off to Dallas.\n\n\n\nGerald, the Alberta election is slated fou 7 June, unless something RE?ALLY goes \nwrong this time!!  Pocklington could end up being THE embarassment of Klein\nif he goes ahead with his 'ultimatum'.\n\n\n\nGerald,  people still have an axe to grind with this guy.  I CANNOT see him staying for long.\n\n\nBut the people in Edmonton won't budge, trust me on this one.\n\n\nNorthlands won't budge ccording to one of the board members, Bruce Campbell.\n\n\nI haven't heard anything, BUT attendance at the Coliseum was the lowest this \nyear.  HINT!!HINT!!  Remeber what I said about a personal vendetta?\n\n\nGerald, don't blame Sather.  This battle between the peole and Pocklington\nstarted in 1986 and got WORST when Pocklington sold Gretzky.  \n\nThere were days when you can shake the hand of Pocklington when he was\nrespectalbe( I use to do so in 1982 - 1983 season) , but those days are GOE!!\n\n\nBTW, when following up, please delete name of posting writer.
Yeah... I think that the Flames and the Flyers traded Captains once... Mel  \nBridgeman for Brad Marsh.
ESPN never committed (and I never saw advertised) to a particular\nThursday game.  They had originally scheduled Bos-Buf, and that was\nsomehow leaked on this net, but to my knowledge ESPN never publicly\nreleased a schedule until Monday when they announced Pitt-NJ Thursday\nand Boston-Buffalo Saturday.
No, and in fact, that was Ferreira's original strategy, which the troika\nproceeded to simply continue to implement. There wasn't exactly a radical\nshift in policy when he was ousted (something people seem to forget). The\nonly real question is whether they did it as well as Ferreira could have if\nhe stayed, or whether the basic strategy was flawed (since Ferreira has been\nquoated as saying he's going to do something different in Anaheim with the\nDucks, my guess is that it wasn't as good in practice as it was on paper,\nand he's tweaking it a bit second time around). One also has to wonder\nwhether the strategy would have been a lot better if we hadn't had those\ninjuries, and whether we're complaining about the weather because an\nearthquake collapsed the root cellar.\n\n\nLet's also NOT FORGET that Ferreira came *THIS* close to trading Kelly\nKisio, which, if the rumors I've heard are true, was over the strong\nobjections of other aspects of Shark management and probably had a lot to do\nwith both his ouster and the three-headed, consensus oriented GM.\n\nImagine, for a second, where the Sharks would be today if that fax machine\nhadn't jammed.\n\n\nEspecially an unhappy player that isn't playing as well because of it. Not\nthat I'd accuse Mullen of tanking, but his motivation simply wasn't there,\nand that kind of thing can affect the team.\n\n\n\n\nExactly. At the time they let Skriko go, we hadn't yet had the major injury\nbugs that killed us later. I'd much rather have Skriko around than someone\nlike Dean Kolstad, but at that point, that wasn't the choice. And since the\nchoice was more one of Skriko vs. someone like John Carter, I think the\nright choice was made for that time period.
Hey man! -\n\nHaving spent the past season learning to skate and having played a\ncouple of sessions of mock hockey, I'm ready to invest in hockey\nequipment (particularly since I will be taking summer 'hockey\nlessons').  However, I am completely and profoundly ignorant when it\ncomes to hockey equipment.  I've checked out local stores and looked\nat catalogs, but I was hoping to solicit opinions/suggestions before\nactually plunking down any money.  Having played football in high\nschool and college I at least have that equipment as a basis for\ncomparison.  But for example what are the advantages/disadvantages to\ndifferent kinds of shoulder pads and pants/girdles?  Are there any\nnotoriously bad or unsafe brands or styles?  etc.  So any suggestions\nor comments would be greatly appreciated.
Hey American Hockey fans,\n\nAs a hockey fan I can sympathize with thefrustration that you feel.  The\nproblem is that other Americans don't give a shit about hockey.  They view\nit as a bunch of Canadians with bad accents and missing teeth beating the\nshit out of each other on a patch of ice when it is too warm now in\ntwo-thirds of the US to see the stuff naturally.  On the other hand\nBASEBALL is the *gasp**swoon**sigh* "NATIONAL PASTTIME".  BASEBALL is so\nromanticized in the US that you are supposed to forget that other sport\nexist after April 1 and before November 1.  I feel that since ESPN shows 5+\nBASEBALL games a week they should be able to show an OT hockey game instead\nof the opening innings of a BASEBALL game.  Hell, the game is going to last\n2hrs 45mins, so what if you miss the first 1 1/2 hrs?  And I am an Indians\nfan!  Show the end of what you started, then switch!  But then, I'm a\nhockey fan, what do I know?  BASEBALL is the all mighty sport.
I asked him, and Don Cherry denies being Roger Maynard and he denies\nany knowledge of Usenet. :-)
I agree! Rob Shick sucks big time.  He did the same thing last night's game \nbetween Boston & Buffalo.

Okay... here's some gripe"ing" (?griping?... whatever).\n\n	(I live in Santa Barbara... for reference... I think)\n\n	Okay, ABC showed the Kings/Flames... fine... YAWN.\n\n	ESPN (through a fortunate rainout of a baseball game) showed the\n  Red Wings/Toronto game... cool.\n\n	But I SWEAR that the advertisements all week long had said that\n  ESPN would show Pitt/NJ on Tuesday and Bos/Buff on Thursday.\n\n	I raced home from work early (4:30 Pacific) to catch the game, but\n  ALAS, it was the Boston/Buffalo game and then they promised that they would\n  show the Pitt/NJ game on Thursday.  OVERNIGHT they changed their mind.\n\n	I didn't mind THAT MUCH.  I watched the game (hockey is MUCH better\n  than NO hockey).  During the game their were no video highlights from the\n  Patrick division.  What the hell was going on?  At least they should show\n  video highlights of the other games (especially the NYI/Caps game that was\n  so close).  My father (lives in Bowling Green, Kentucky [Bumbf*ck, Egypt])\n  got to watch the Pens game on ESPN.  I just don't get it.\n\n	The biggest problem is that Buffalo or Boston fans who didn't want\n  to see the Pittsburgh/New Jersey game 2, will turn on their TVs on Thursday\n  and see the Pittsburgh/New Jersey game 3 instead of the Buffalo/Boston game\n  3.  At least, in my case, I just had to wait 2 more days to see my game.\n\n	If I were a big Boston or Buffalo fan and I missed the game on\n  Tuesday due to false advertising on the part of ESPN, I'd be mad as\n  hell.\n\n	Oh well... hopefully we'll get better coverage next year OR\n  SOMETHING.\n\nMatt Coohill
But I have to agree.. Boston is a good team..  But streaky...  They put\ntogether a great streak to capture first place in the Adams, but for what?\n\nThey have lost the home ice advantage for at least the first round, and might\nnot make it out of it.\n\nI would love to see the Sabres win the first round, even though I bet on the\nBruins (a 12-pack).  \n\nOh well, perhaps I should start betting against the Sabres more often! ;-)
I hope this makes you feel better, but the overtime between the Isles and\nthe Caps was GREAT!!!
Note that this ominous prospect is fueled by the fact that various SC\nand Prime outlets are wholly or partly owned by local NHL owners.\nWhen/If Cablevision VP Chuck Dolan's purchase of the Islanders goes\nthrough, the Islanders will be back solidly in the SCNY fold (their\noriginal owners were, and they've remained due to a lucrative TV\ncontract).  The Flyer Snyders own the Philadelphia SC as well as the\nPrism pay channel.  There are six teams affiliated with regional SC's,\nanother half dozen affiliated with Prime outlets, and other locals\nlike HTS and NESN who have barter arrangements.  With all this\ncross-ownership, I was surprised that ESPN got the deal this \nseason!!\n\ngld

It wasn't a reason to stop posting. :-)\n\n\nIt's not over yet -- if anyone has a chance to come back in 4 games, I think\nBoston can do it, but I still see Buffalo winning in 6.\n\n\nAgreed -- they're playing tremendous hockey right now.  Congatualtions on three\nstraight Buffalo.  It could very easily be 2-1 Boston, but Buffalo has come up\ntough and a little luck.  (You never see a penalty in OT that doesn't have both\nsides involved in a playoff game.  Never never never!)
The Jets gave the Canucks another run for their money in an almost\nidentical game to the first of the series but once again came up short as\nVancouver outscored Winnipeg 3-2.\n	The pattern of the first game was repeated tonight, with the Canucks\nscoring quickly and then going to sleep in the second period, only to stave\noff a Jet comeback with opportune goals from their greater talent. The Jets\nlooked more dangerous in this one but it didn't make a difference in the \nnumbers that counted: goals.\n	Vancouver's big line produced again, with centre Cliff Ronning and\nleft winger Geoff Courtnall scoring in the first and in the second to \nboost the Canucks to a 2-0 lead on giveaways by the suspect Jet defence of\nBautin and Ulanov. Mental lapses by the defence and goal-scoring talent\nin opportune areas made the difference in all three Canuck goals.\n	However, as in the first game, the Jets worked hard to take the\ngame to the Canucks in the second period. The Jets dominated the second,\nchecking hard and penetrating the Vancouver zone without being challenged\nby a Canuck team that wanted to pack it in early. \n	The hard work paid off late in the second, when Tie Domi caught\nVancouver goalie Kirk McLean by surprise with a sharp angle shot to make\nthe score 2-1. \n	Domi's goal gave the Jets new life as they began to take the rush\nto the Canuck's collapsing defence. The Canucks were unwilling to do \nanything but let McLean take shots and clear the rebounds. The Jets were\nallowed to set up and make plays.\n	Both goalies made standup saves as the play picked up considerably.\nMcLean made three great saves in the second off a dancing Teammu Selanne\nwhile Essensa was rocked by a Pavel Bure drive. Selanne looked dangerous\non the rush as the Jets pressed a series of attacks into the Canuck\nzone. The Canucks, on the other hand, looked like they were offering four\nchecking lines in an effort to preserve their slim lead.\n	A series of minor penalties at the end of the second period\nresulted in a one man advantage for the Jets in the early third. The\nJet's Tempo Numminen drove a puck from the point through McLean's\nlegs and into the net to tie the game at 2-2.\n	The Canuck's discordant play picked up where it left off.\nThis was characterized by long lead passes that either never connected\nor were picked off by the Jets and individual rushes into a tight\nWinnipeg defence that were never supported.\n	However, as in the first and second Canuck goals, a Jet defensive\nlapse (re: bonehead play) stalled the Winnipeg comeback. With the faceoff\nin the Winnipeg zone, Pavel Bure was left to stand in the crease with\nno Jet defender anywhere near him. Bure, who had been invisible in the\ngame up to that point, took a rebound and managed to roof it with a \nbackhand even though he was off balance. \n	By then it was too late for the Jets to come back. Essensa made it\nto the bench with one minute to go but the extra attacker did nothing\nfor their attack. Canucks 3, Winnipeg 2.\n	Next game is Friday at Winnipeg with the Jets in the hole by two games.\n- 30 -

Not always true. In fact, in the case of Doug Gilmour, he actually praises them.\n\nEuropeans that do those things are scum in Cherry's opinion. Canadian kids\nthat do them are "tough, just like a real Canadian". \n\nUlf Samuelsson cheap shots Mark Messier's ribs and Don wants Ulf's head. Doug\nGilmour breaks Tomas Sandstrom's arm and Don says Sandstrom had it coming. \nMethinks Don is either very confused or just a bigot. Most likely the latter.\n\nI used to like Don Cherry. I thought he was great. But I'm starting to see\nhis true colors (redneck) and the more I see of them, the more I think he's\njust an asshole.
Actually, I was angry when they went away from the Pens game.\nBeing a Pens fan in central Virginia is kinda tough.  I only\nget to see them on ESPN, and when they play the Caps, cause\nwe're close enough to DC to get all the Caps games, so when\nESPN switched to the Caps, . . . AAAGGGHHH!

This was a concession to Mansbridge and CBC News, they argued that if you're\ngoing to play  havoc with the schedule, you should  at least make sure that\nPrime Time is aired as soon as possible. News got a commitment that the\npost-game show would be scrapped and that the network would go to PTN within\none minute or so of the game  ending.\n\nAs for the earlier comments about CBC being "Ontariocentric" frankly\nthe no doubleheader decison goes both ways, people in the West cant  see\nthe Leafs  and people in Central Canada can't see the Jets game. The\nreason for the decision was CBC's feeling they couldn't sell advertising\nfor six hours of hockey in  one night.\n\n As for who wants to see news over hockey, a lot of people. CBC always gets\nplenty of complaints about juggling the news schedule.
Well, I agree that if you're going to stand in front of the net,\nthat you should expect to get hit and hacked at. In general, you\nshould expect to finish the game with some bruises. However,\nthere is a fine line between hacking at a guy (causing some pain\nand discomfort) and blatantly attempting to injure another\nplayer. Felix Potvin, IMO, crossed that line on Wednesday. That\ntwo hander on Ciccarelli was way out of line. I lost a lot of\nrespect for Potvin because of that. It showed an immaturity. He\ndid not slash at Ciccarelli to simply try to remove him from the\nslot area (a legal position for Dino to be in). Instead, he\nslashed in an attempt to injure. It was out of shear frustration. As a\nLeaf supporter (just a supporter, I'm not a Leaf fan really), I\nwas very disappointed.\n\nYou're right in mentioning Billy Smith and Ron Hextall (at least\nin his Philly days). They both crossed that same line at times and\nfor that reason, many fans (and players) disliked them (that's\nwhy their names always comes up as examples when we talk about\nthese issues). Let's hope that Felix doesn't do that again. I'd\nhate to see anyone (even Dino --- although I admit I don't like\nhim very much) get seriously hurt from such careless (but\nintentional) use of the stick.

Well, Dave, I would have to disagree with you there.  Satan himself could\nown the team, and I'd be happy as long as the Oilers stayed in Edmonton.\nSelfish, but true.  I don't want to see the Oilers move, no matter who\ntheir owner is.
Finns had to do their best last night when they played against Norway\nin world champs. After two periods the score was still 0-0. This game was \nquite much similar to the first game Finland played  (against France).\nThe norwegian goalie was very good and a bit lucky, too. In the third period\nJuha Riihij{rvi scored 1-0 from a rebound, the time was around 5 mins or so.\nThe second goal was scored by Kari Harila, who shot straight from a faceoff\nbehind the Nowwegian goalie. Saku Koivu, the 18-year-old center got his first\npoint of this tournament. Saku Koivu played very well througout the game and he\nwas awarded the best player of the game- prize. Despite the fact that he is\nquite small in size he handles the puck very well and is a fast skater. \nI think that we will hear from this guy in the future.
I really feel the need for a knowledgable hockey observer to explain this year's playoffs to me. I mean, the obviously superior Toronto team with the best center and the best goalie in the league keeps losing. What gives?\n\n-- \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n         \nI stand by all the misstatements that I've made.\n		-- Vice President Dan Quayle to Sam Donaldson, 8/17/89
You, along with Mario Lemieux, must be from another planet.  The only\ndifference is that Lemieux comes from the one with Geo. Washington, Abe\nLincoln (and many other great men and women of this world) whereas you come\nfrom the one with David Koresh.  Yeah, Mario is good at drawing penalties,\nbut wouldn't you try do something (you do claim to play) to give your team\nan advantage?  I don't remember Lemieux getting any diving penalties this\nyear, whereas many others did.  Finally, Mario has NEVER complained about\nbeing hit.  He knows it's part of the game; he gets back by dishing out an\neven bigger hit to the same guy or just scoring a few goals (or setting\nthem up.)  Don't you have any compassion for a man who has gone through so\nmuch in his life?
That's a good way to put it.  It's a quiet confidence.  I don't feel like\nI have to defend this team anymore. \n\nThe Devils are a puzzle to me.  They have long been one of the few teams\nI always dreaded playing.  Their D isn't quite what it used to be but they\nstill usually play us pretty tough.  I just can't figure it out.  At least\nlast night they mounted an attack.\n\n\nBernie Nichols was interviewed after Game 2 on the late news.  He was\nshaking his head in disbelief over Barrasso, saying that Tommy is like\nanother defenseman out there and how difficult it is playing against him.\nThen he got this far-away look on his face, his voice started trailing\noff and he said, "It just isn't right...it just isn't fair..." and he\ntried to muster a smile.\n\n\nAs far as coaching goes, a Pens/Islanders match-up should be pretty good.\n\nOne guy I feel sorry for in all of this so far is Chris Terreri.  I'm sure\nTom Barrasso knows how he feels.  For so long Tommy would look up and not\nhave a teammate in sight.  Terreri's teammates really left him out in the\ncold in the first two games.
Here's a summary of Don Cherry's Coach's Corner from April 23, 1993.\nIt was taken from a tape delay of a Vancouver-Winnipeg game, but\nit was filmed during the Toronto-Detroit game that night. I think\nit was also shown during the Calgary-LA game. \n\n(Warning... Anti-fighting people may want to skip this post.)\n\nTopics\n------\n\nDon's Tie, Doug Gilmour, Wings/Leafs, Quebec/Montreal, Boston/Buffalo,\nWendel Clark, Fighting and Stickwork.\n\nEpisode Summary\n---------------\n\nOnce again, the episode started with a shot of Don's tie... This\nwas a different tie than last time. Don pointed out some of the\ncharacters on the tie, but gave them different names... Felix the\nCat (Sylverster), Maclean (Daffy Duck), etc.\n\nRon Maclean asked Don what he thought of the current Wings-Leafs\ngame. Don thought it was good. Burns told the Leaf players "They\nwon in their building, we're going to win in ours".\n\nDon then began to praise Gilmour again. Don pointed out that Gilmour\nhas never got less than 2 points or a goal in any game since he\ngot 5 points in a game against St. Louis.  (Don also claims that\nhe gave a lot of encouragement to Gilmour, which was partly responsible\nfor his good play.) Several clips were then shown of Gilmour\nfrom the series... A hit on Constantinov, and a pass to Andrewchuk\nresulting in a goal.\n\nOn the game itself, the Wings were taking a lot of penalties in\nthe first period. The Wings have enough talent to score short handed\nhowever, and when the Leafs get a power play, Coach Burns tells\nthe Leaf players "Don't let them score on you".\n\nRon brought up the previous Quebec-Montreal game. [Note: Montreal\nwon that game in overtime, despite having a possible game winner\ndisqualified because it was batted in with a high stick.] Don\nthought the high stick was obvious, even without the use of\ninstant replay.\n\nOn the Buffalo-Boston series [Note: Buffalo is currently winning\nthe series 3-0], Don gave full credit to Goaltender Grant Fuhr.\nFuhr should be getting 1/2 the team's playoff checks for his\nplay.\n\nWendel Clarke has recently been criticized for his performance\nduring the Detroit-Toronto series. Don defended him, by saying\nthat he can't play the way he should, because of the league's\nnew rules. "This used to be a rough and tough league... Now its\nall hack and slash." Don lays the blame on Gil Stien for the\nproblems.\n\nDon's opinions on fighting and stickwork are shared by Wings\nGM and coach Bryan Murray. A clip from a news conference by Murray\nwas shown, in which Murray made statements claiming the elimination\nof fighting increases stickwork. Don also read a newspaper article\nin which Murray makes the following statements: "Players don't fight\nbecause they're afraid of getting thrown out of the game as instigator.\nInstead, they settle grudges by getting their sticks and slicing\neach other. Is this what the fans want to see? I guarantee there\nwouldn't be as many slashes if fighting were kept in the game."\n\nDon warned league commisioner Gary Bettman to "smarten up" with\nfighting in hockey. He went on to say that before, there used\nto be one guy cut with a high stick in a series. Now, with no fights,\nsomeone gets cut every period.\n\nRating\n------\nTypical anti-fighting posturing, but here Don's opinion is supported\nby Murray.
News:\n=====\nFor the first time all season, the Flames are now injury-free. The only player\nremaining on the limp is center Carey Wilson who, even when healthy, is not \na major part of the team. \n\nTrent Yawney did not score a goal all season until the last regular season\ngame against San Jose. He potted his first of the year in that game, and has\nalso scored goals in both Game 1 and Game 2 against Los Angeles. \n\nThoughts on Game 1:\n==================\n\nThe Flames played horribly in dropping the first game of their series with\nLos Angeles 6-3 on Sunday afternoon. They seemed more interested in throwing\nbig hits than in scoring goals. They physically dominated the Kings, but that\nwas the only area they dominated in. The game plan was to rush the net and \ntry and take advantage of a young, inexperienced L.A. defence and the shaky\nKings goaltending, but those plans fell by the wayside while the Flames\nconducted a steady march to the penalty box. Particularily stupid was Theoren\nFleury taking a five minute major and a game misconduct for slamming Warren\nRychel's face into the dasher while Rychel was on his knees. \n\nGoaltender Mike Vernon played well and could not really be faulted for the\nloss, despite his well-publicized poor record in afternoon games. He got\nvery little support from his defence in clearing the front of the net and \nsweeping away rebounds. In fact, Marty McSorley's goal actually went in off\nChris Dahlquist's skate in front of the net. \n\nThoughts on Game 2:\n==================\n\nThe Flames came back strong in the second game, evidently aware of the\npotentially fatal consequences of losing both the first two games on home ice.\nThe first period was fairly even, with the edge going to the Kings. But Calgary\ncame out strong in the second period and simply dominated the Kings, scoring\nfive goals to take a lead they never relinquished en route to a 9-4 win. \n\nThe deciding factors in this game were faceoffs and special teams. Calgary\ndominated on faceoffs as they did in Game 1, but they were able to make better\nuse of the won faceoffs in this game than they did in the first one. Calgary\nalso went 3-for-5 on the powerplay while L.A. only went 1-for-8 and gave up\na shorthanded goal to Joel Otto. L.A.'s powerplay goal also came late in the\ngame with the outcome already decided. The Kings' powerplay failed them when\nthey needed it most, in the 1st and 2nd periods. \n\nThe Flames lost RW Greg Paslawski with a suspected shoulder injury when he\nwas leveled by Alexei Zhitnik right after scoring Calgary's 7th goal. Charlie\nHuddy left the game for the Kings with a groin injury. \n\nThe game was marred by stupidity in the last minute. First, Craig Berube of\nCalgary took a five-minute major for fighting plus a game misconduct for\ninstigating when he went after Tony Granato for no apparent reason. Granato\ndrew a minor for some strange reason. (Turtling perhaps). This was followed\n30 seconds later by Warren Rychel drawing a major, minor, and game misconduct\nfor hitting Frank Musil in the face with his stick and then instigating a\nfight. Musil got a fighting major for some similarily strange reason. Hardy and\nYawney went toe-to-toe and both got double minors. (Gregson thought that Musil \nturtling amounted to fighting, but that Yawney and Hardy throwing punches at \neach other was just roughing?

Once again, last night's STUPID penalty put the Isles in a hole for the\nremainder of regulation and 2 minutes into overtime!!! Even though the Isles\nnearly survived Pilon's blunder in regulation, it was the most inopportune time\nfor a 5-minute major penalty. Instead of confronting Cote as he came across the\nblueline, Pilon backed up and swiped at Cote's nose with his stick. Al Arbour\ncan't be serious to think Pilon is the guy to have out there with the game on\nthe line??? I heard Scott LaChance is out till later in the series, but there\nmust be someone else!!! Bring back the BAMMER, Dave Langevin!!!!\n\n*******************************LETS GO ISLANDERS********************************\n\nJohn Scialdone\nSCIALDONE@NSSDCA.GSFC.NASA.GOV

Matching the Makarov offer was the only real mistake Dave King has made this\nyear. I have to wonder about the intelligence of signing a 33-year old who\nis obviously on the downside of his career to a 4-year $2 million contract. \nRisebrough matched the offer on King's request and Makarov has spent the last\nquarter of the season in the press box because his work ethic just plain\nstinks. Not to mention that he's lost a step and can no longer get himself\ninto position to make the nifty passes. \n\nI think Makarov will be available for free this offseason to anybody who agrees\nto pay his contract. He's ineffective in Calgary, but he might be able to help\na team like San Jose, with their shortage of talent. If there's no takers, and\nMakarov doesn't show improvement in training camp, I think the Flames will just\nbite the bullet and buy out Makarov's contract and release him. With his\ncurrent attitude, he is a detriment to the team.

Well, the "jettison for youth fast" strategy was his. Also in hindsight, it\ndidn't work all that well, but I think it was more because it left the\nSharks on a tightrope without a net, not that it was inherently flawed. It\nwas the injuries that caused us to fall.\n\n\nFrom all indications, it wasn't the "major" factor, but the "last straw".\nThere were personality conflicts among Shark management, and disagreements\nover how personnel were going to be handled (not just who was being traded\nvs. kept, but who was being sent to KC. What Ferriera did, if rumors are\nright, was not always what the folks behind the bench wanted or needed).\n\n\nI think if they'd kept Ferriera, they would have lost some of their other\nmanagement staff. Depending on which sources you trust, we might have lost\nGrillo AND Lombardi AND Murdoch over the summer. Frankly, I want to keep\nthose three. (we may well ahve also lost Kingston, which, of course, is now\na moot point). \n\nThe Sharks have been building an organizational staff that is highly\nconsensual and cooperative. Ferriera wanted to run things his way. There\nwere conflicts. Ferriera lost. That says nothing about his skills or\naccomplishments -- at that level, a lot is personality and politics. \n\nI think he did some good things for the Sharks, but that he never fit in as\na "Shark person". I hope he succeeds beyond his wildest dreams down in\nAnaheim, too, because it'll be good for hockey. (but I want the Ducks to be\ndoormats for a couple of years, so the Sharks succeeed first).
Brad McCrimmon was the captain of the Flames when he was traded to Detroit\nfollowing the 1989-90 season. This was during the off-season though.\n\nThere's countless examples of captains being traded, I'm sure.
Teemu Selanne had 3 goals, Keith Tkachuk had one, and Luciano Borsato\nscored a rare Jets shorthanded goal as the Jets held on to beat the\nCanucks 5-4, and close the series to 2-1.  Trevor Linden and Pavel\nBure had two goals each for the Canucks in a losing cause.\n\nSelanne came out of a two game goal scoring slump, scoring two powerplay\ngoals, and one on a nice breakaway pass from Darrin Shannon.\n\nHard work paid off tonight for the Jets, and if the Jets continue to\nexhibit this strong work effort, they can make a series of it. (I woofed\nlast year when we were up 3-1...I ain't going to do THAT again.  I'll\nhave to be quietly happy with a solid performance.  ;)
(Susan Clark) asks:\n\nI am not so sure about the celebrated players of the game, but Tod Hartje,\nwho played for Harvard in college and then went on to play in the AHL\n(initially for Moncton and currently for Providence-- thanks to Daryl \nTurner for the update!) appeared on David Letterman's show about two\nyears ago now.\n\nTod has the distinction of being the first American born player to go \nand play in the former Soviet Union. This was arranged by Jets GM Mike \nSmith while Tod was playing in Moncton at about the time all those \nEuropean players were coming over to North America to play in the NHL.\n\nTod spent a year playing in Russia and played with or against some of\nthe Russian players who have just entered the NHL in the last two years.\nHe wrote a book on his experiences called "Behind the Red Line" (check it\nout!) and appeared on the Letterman show to talk about them.\n\n-- Mike
I too think that Joseph has had a GREAT year and should be considered for the\nVezina.  I think Barrasso and Joseph should be the two strongest candidates\nthis year.  I don't believe ALL of the hype that Roy, Belfour and now Potvin\nreceive for their goaltending.  I do think that they are great in the nets,\nbut I would rather have Curtis, Tommy or Fuhr in the nets during this years\nplayoffs.  The big name tenders always seem to have a strong defense in front\nof them and the goaltenders get the most credit.  I would rather face 25 shots\na game, than have to rely on Joseph saving 35, but if the goalie is going to\nface 35 shots, I would rather have Joseph or Barrasso facing them.\n\n-Jay\n\nps Go Quebec!!!  And I know that McLean and several others should be mentioned\nas candidates for this years Vezina, but I am partial to Joseph and Barrasso\nthis season.
From his Topps "rookie" year (as coach) card (74-75):\n"For the past couple of seasons, Don has been the highly-successful\n coach of the Rochester Americans of the AHL, but he is getting his\n first shot at an NHL job with the Bruins.  Named Coach of the Year\n in the AHL the last two years, and he aims to make the Bruins a\n rough team again, as they were a couple of years back.  Although\n he played 16 seasons of professional hockey, Don never played a\n regular-season NHL game.  He did appear in one playoff game for\n Boston in 1956-57.  Don's brother, Dick, played two seasons in the\n NHL with Boston and Philadelphia."
Apparently, the public workers' strike in St John's, Newfoundland is over.\nThe strike has, since mid-January, forced the St John's Maple Leafs hockey\nteam to play their home games in other cities such as Toronto, Cornwall\nand Charlottetown. They have been playing their playoff home games\nin Halifax, Nova Scotia. Leafs' management said that they COULD\nreturn to St John's for the second round.
Buffalo is up 2-0 is the series with Boston, and the reason....Grant Fuhr ?\n  Fuhr is playoff hungry, and he's proving once again why they call him\n  money goaltender. Fuhr might not be one of the best goaltenders in the\n  league anymore (Statistically at least), but he's proving that he can\n  make the big save at the right time.\n  \n  The Leafs should have kept Fuhr, and probably would have had a chance \n  against powerhouse Detroit. But again.......where was Andreychoke in game 1 ?\n\n  I can see the huge smile on Gerald's face after Fuhr's performance.
First of all I think when ESPN covers the game they do a wonderful job, but\n last night I felt the same way. I really hate watching Devils/Pens game. \n Everyone knows that Devils are going to get their ass kicked, why even \n bother showing them. I was so bored and these ESPN people don't seem to have\n any brain. After the Sundays and last night games, they are still going to \n show Devils/Pens on THU and SUN. WHat the hell are they thinking about? I \n think if they keep it up like this NHL will never get a major network contract.\n I'd rather see Caps/Isls game which is more exciting. \n\n Now I just hope all baseball games are rained out on ESPN so atleast\n we can get diffrent hockey games.
An interesting note ... I have absolutely no recollection who was on my team.\n  I picked all my players about 2 weeks before the start of the season, and\n  then never touched the roster again.  I got wrapped up in my own "money" pool\n  and decided not to get involved at all with the USENET pool (sorry Andrew\n  btw).  The only thing I remember about my team is that I had Joe Sacco and\n  maybe John MacLean.  Maybe Francis and Kevin Stevens as well.  Out of\n  curiousity I checked the final standings today on r.s.h., only to find to my\n  amazement that with absolutely no input, the initial team still managed to\n  finsh 79th!  I'm not sure what that implies for those who finished below me\n  :)\n\n  Ciao.\n  Brad Gibson\n\n-- \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Brad K.

That was Clint Malarchuk.  That was a very dangerous accident.  He could he\ndied right there on the ice.  However, he has played since  \nbut I don't know where he is now.  I think he is still playing but I'm\nnot positive.  He was a Sabre at the time.\nI don't know who skated into him though.\n\n\nI remember a couple of seasons before the Malarchuk incident Borje\nSalming of Toronto fell down in the crease and someone skated into\nhis face.  That took a lot of stiches to fix.
On the other hand, I'm hard pressed to think of any other real mistakes\nFereirra made.  Imagine indeed, but then again we have the benefit of\nhindsight.\n\nLet's say that in the view of the Sharks' upper management, the attempt\nto trade Kisio was a major factor in the decision to fire Feirerra.\nI'm inclined to take exactly the opposite view:  they should have kept\nhim...he's obviously the luckiest man in hockey!  (Wonder what\nsacrifice he made to the Muse of Fax?  (His job, I guess.))\n\nhave fun\ngak
The top 11 teams of this tournament will play in the Olympics next year.\nThe last team of this tournament, top two of pool B (Great Britain and \nPoland) and the winner of pool C (Latvia) will play for the last Olympic \nspot next fall.\n  However, if next year's hosts Norway were to finish 12th (which would be \nno surprise), then it's the 11th team of pool A that will have to play in \nthe qualification tournament.

Welcome aboard!  And, since I haven't seen this yet this year (but all\npreceding years), let me say:
The Fat Lady is about to hit the first note...Okay,how about 3-0 deficits?\nThe B's chances for a comeback are now less 1%(That's based on 7-game\nplayoff format)...\n\n \nHe got the start but the headlines on all Boston local TV sportscats\nsaid it all : "Sutter Blue It!". And he did.\n\nHarry Sinden's appearance outside of B's dressing room after Game 3\nwas a pathetic site. He said something really retarded to cover Sutter's\nbehind,"This game is not about winning or losing..". Harry,check the\nschedule! Your team is in the playoffs and about to go on a long summer\nvacation on Sunday morning!\n\nHarry and his buttkisser Milbury will never admit that they screwed up\nin a major way when they brought in one of the dumbest people in the\nbusiness,Brian Sutter. Sutter's playoff record as the head coach in St.Louis\nspeaks for itself. The Blues really have a chance to advance to the\nsecond round this year...
Attention Penguins fans once again, apparently 99.999% of you understand that\nthis was just a joke (Hence the :-) next to it) but one idiot on here doesn't\nas he got pissed at me and sent me two hate e-mails telling me that this is\nwrong.  I have no intentions of sending e-mail to anyone should the Pens win\ntonight, and I really do not expect/do not intend to lead any of you to send\nthis poster e-mail either.  It was NOT a serious request.  If you didn't know\nthat (which you probably did) then don't do it.  Thanks.
WATCH OUT PITSBURGH HERE COME THE ISLES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\n\nThey said we wouldn't make the playoffs and we came in third\nThey said the Caps would beat us and they're not going to\nThey say that Pitsburgh has a 1:1 ratio of winning the cup but We'll prove them\nwrong.\n\n\nL E T S   G O    I S L A N D E R S!!!!!!!  Bring it back home
Not to Sutter bash or anything since I idolized them as players....\nyou sure would think the Sutters would learn something about burning out their\nteams in the regular season.....just too much intensity during the regular \nseason.  I earlier posted a note about Brian and got to thinking after I read\nthis item.....gee both Sutters won their divisions and now both have lost \nhome ice advantage and are getting smoked in their opening series in the\nplayoffs.  Kind of makes you wonder.......\n\nBottom line....man it is great to be smoking the WartHawks!!!!!\nAgreed Jim.....this has been damn sweet, so far.  About the only thing\nthat comes close to this is shutting up all the Maple Laugh fans....Detroit\nhas completely kicked their asses so far.  But, I will stick with the\nBlues for providing the best playoff tonic so far.
...\n\nThat is if Mario makes it.\n\nPat Walker sounds like the type that would bring an AK-47 to a game\nand take pot shots at Mario. ("stand STILL...dam sunavbich...HMFF")
It's about time the boys got it together!!\nThey were outworked and outplayed by the Wings in the first two games.\nBut Burns must have kicked their behinds cause they sure came out in full\ngear (or is that high gear?) in game 3.  Except for a 10-15 minute stretch\nin the 2nd period, they outskated and outworked the Wings.  Please don't\nflame this statement 'cos you know it's true!  I have to admit that \ngoaltending was the key.  Potvin kept the Leafs ahead during the sleepy\nstretch the Leafs went through in the 2nd.  He also kept the rebounds to a\nminimum, something that cost Cheveldae 2 goals.  Clark even looked like\nhe had stopped moping (first star!), although I still don't know why he\nwas so flat in games 1 and 2.\n\nIf the Leafs play the same style and can keep the pace they had in game\n3, they may actually have a chance of winning this series (a slim chance, \nbut a chance....I'm no RM.....where is he anyways? haha).
Well I think whenever ESPN covers the game they do a wonderful job. But\n   what I don't understand is that they cut the OT just show some stupid\n   baseball news which is not important at all. Then I waited for the scores\n   to comeon Sportscenter, but they talk about Baseball, basketball and \n   football. Then they showed Penguine highlight and went back to stupid\n   basketball. Finally they showed a highlight of the OT goal but that\n   was like 30 sec. I think they should give more attention to NHl during\n   the playoffs then talking about boring basketball games..\n\n   I guess it is NHL's fault too for leaving ESPN. Hope things improve\n   by next season...\n\n   COBRA\n\n\n--
I'm personally expecting Moog.  Blue played fairly decent (alright\nspectacular at times) in his 1/2 a game but Moog has the experience.\nWhat Did Blue have going for him, nothing, What would happen in a Tie\ngame, the prssure is then on the Goal tender to insure that you keep the\npuck out (at the very least until your team scores)  Blue didn't face that\nkind of pressure on Tuesday.  The Bruins will come out storming that\nis for sure.  I really think that this series is up to Buffalo, Boston\n(except for two bad passes in game one) really hasn't played that bad\n,  As a believer is statistics, you know that your going to get the\npuck by fuhr sooner or later, just keep shooting.  There game plan is\nsound but they need to take the lead first, and control the tempo.....\n\n               IMHO\n                      Pat Ellis\n\nP.S.

WHY!!! DC/Baltimore is one of the top media markets (=the only thing the NHL\nseems to care about these days), they've been doing far better than the NBA\nBullets at the gate for the last five years. The team has been a perennial\ncontender and fan support has been good to excellent . . . Why should Pollin\nmove to city that's five times smaller but has as many teams in other pro\nsports. I don't get it...
Hey, we could start a new game on the net.  It's called 'Where's Roger?'\nIt's similiar to 'Where's Waldo?' but instead of finding Waldo in a picture\nof people, we try to find Roger in a newsgroup on the net.\n I predict that he'll be in r.s.basketball.pro next.
Buffalo fans:\n\nSome people in the discussion group, as well as "commentator Al" on ESPN, \nbelieve that game 3 is critical for the Sabres.  HELLOOOO!!!!! The Sabres \nare AHEAD 2 games to 0, not behind.  As a life-long Sabres fan, I am well \naware of their ability to choke, but let's not exaggerate that.  As long as \nthe Sabres win one of the next 2 games (be it game 3 OR game 4), they are \nstill in good shape (ahead 3 games to 1), with game 6 to be played at \nBuffalo.  If they lose games three AND four, then start worrying.  Game 3 is \ncritical for Boston, not Buffalo.
J<--> \nJ<--> Yahooooooooooooooooooooo!\nJ<--> \nJ<--> What a game, we finally beat those diques...and in O.T.!\nJ<--> The Habs dominated this game and especially in O.T..\n\nYou realize that we dominated game 1 also and should be ahead in this \nseries 2 - 1?\n\nJ<--> Glorieux were plagued by bad luck; the puck wouldn't bounce their\nJ<--> way.  But in O.T. they got their lucky break, the winning goal\nJ<--> went off Gusarov's skate.  Thank you Lord!!!!!!\n\nAnd it's about time! We hit 2 posts in this overtime and 1 post in \ngame 1's overtime. Let's hope that **we** start getting some luck for \na change.\n\nHe played well in this game but Roy's inconsistency still makes me \nnervous. Otherwise, I'd say we're going to win this series, no sweat. \nIt's all up to Patrick Roy to provide **consistent** goaltending.\n\nJ<--> And those damn Bruins lost in O.T., their down 3-0.  Congratulations\nJ<--> Buffalo!!\nJ<--> \nJ<--> Life doesn't get better than this!!!!!!!!!\n\nAgreed. <g> \n\n- Jack\n\n * Tagline Bad or Missing  NO CARRIER

On Tuesday, when it was raining in Chicago, ESPN provided \nbonus hockey coverage.  Now it seems as though some fans are ticked off\nthat the NY-Wash OT was replaced with the Angels-?? game.  People must\nrealize that there are more baseball fans instead of hockey fans in the U.S  \nThe baseball game was scheduled to air and advertisers money was paid so\nthey can't skip the baseball game.  Why don't you people CHILL OUT\nand enjoy whatever coverage you can get.
Roger,\n\n	    SHUT UP.\n\n 	Thank you.

This would be dumb move of the nineties...Lindros is big and strong...\nbut why give him a ball and chain on one leg and an anchor on the\nother to drag along.\n\n\nNot if Pocklington gets there first! (-...actually, if Pocklington\ndoesn't get a better deal, he would probably go to Hamilton...taking\nthe team out of Canada would get the whole country mad at him...\ntaking the team to Hamilton wouldn't get anybody mad at him that \nisn't mad at him already...and would make him a lot of friends\nin Southern Ontario...so many that the whining of the stupid politicians in\nEdmonton and the fickle spoiled fans wouldn't be noticed at all.\nEdmonton would wallow in anonymnity.
Only problem is that Zombo was traded to St. Louis last year for goalie\nVincent Riendeau.\n\nI think that while Chevy is not among the elite class of goalies, he is\nadequate given the offensive firepower of the Wings.
I have to agree wholeheartedly with this view.  I don't like to see stickwork,\nbut you have to clear players away from in front.  My personal favorite move\n(I'm a goalie too) is to give the offeding player a good whack on the back\nof their skates when the ref isn't looking.  Makes 'em go down like a ton of\nbricks, but doesn't cause injuries unless they don't know how to fall (I'm \ntalking about hitting the blades here, not the foot).  It also makes the \nplayer you hit and anyone who sees really mad and apt to take a stupid\nretaliation penalty.  Unfortunately, it also leaves your blocker out of \nposition for a short time...I don't do this if a shot is likely on the short\nside.  Hmm....maybe I should mail Potvin this method (in French and with\nhelpful diagrams, of course).  It sure would be nice to see Ciccerelli (who\nI have a great deal of respect for, BTW, he's not a big guy, but he plays\nhuge!) fall on his back a few times!  :-)
Grant Fuhr rules! -).
what did happen to the swiss team ? last year they reached the semi-final\nand now after 3 matches no points and even no goals !!\nafter the 0:1 against Italy it seems they lost any hope and were\noverrun 0:6 by the russian team.\nnow it seems that they have to work hard not to be relegated to the\nB-level. does anybody know if this WC is the qualification tournement for\nthe olympic games '94 in Lillehammer or are some teams already\nqualified for them.
What sadist brought up this vein about Malarchuk?  When I saw what\nhappened I wanted to throw up, and at the same time I was devastated,\nsince I thought that Malarchuk wouldn't survive.  BTW, I believe he picked\nup an alcohol problem after (before?) the incident.\n\nTo radically change the subject, the Caps must be having nightmares about\nthe Isles in overtime in the playoffs.  Have they *ever* beaten the\nIslanders in a playoff OT game?  This is lunacy.  The Caps are such a\nsorry team in the playoffs, they consistently choke against opponents who\nthey should be beating.  Losing two OT games in a row is not coincidence,\nit's evidence of the choke factor.
Here are the standings after game 2 of each of the divisional semi-final\nseries.\n\n	- Andrew\n\nUSENET Hockey Playoff Draft Standings\n\nPosn	Team				Pts	Rem	Last Posn\n\n1.

so all us hockey/automobile racing fans all know exactly where we stand\n	ESPN delays the martinsville race by a day for the NFL draft\n	ESPN shows baseball instead of the overtime of a NHL playoff game\n\n	gimme a break, guys\n\n=>  >>Does anyone know why this race is tape delay? Especially until Monday???\n=>  >Is this the weekend for the NFL draft?\n=>  >If so, postponing the race for a day is\n=>  >a real slap in the face for racing fans.\n=>  I'm afraid you're right (as usual). As I recall they've been doing this\n=>  ever since they started covering the draft live. I wish they could work\n=>  out some kind of a deal with somebody else such as TNN to get the race\n=>  on live, but I guess ESPN isn't much into sharing. It also clarifies\n=>  where auto racing stands on their priority list (as if we didn't already\n=>  know ;-)\n--
Absolute nonsense.  The decision that was made was Pocklington's.  He chose \n20 mill over Gretzky.  If Gretzky wasn't upset about not being able to win\na cup in LA then I submit that he wasn't worth the 20 mill.\n\n\nHow do you know what he thinks (or thought)?  The only "thought" that I\ncan see that you have revealed is your own.  You don't like Gretzky.\nBig deal.\n\n\nThe real purpose of diving is not merely an attempt to draw a penalty.  What\nthe player is trying to do is make the checkers keep their distance so the\nref won't be fooled.  I can't imagine why anyone would expect someone like\nLemieux to change his game.  Why don't you pick on 1 dimensional over-rated\ntype like Hull and Salami. \n\n\n--
: Bowman is the genius...Johnson isn't.  Bowman is a great coach...Johnson,\n: a very good one.  However, Bowman is really not a modern coach, and\n: Patrick's solution of having him only run the team on game days, and\n: delegate most of the day-to-day responsibity to the assistants is\n: a shrewd managerial decision on Patrick's part.  \n\nIMHO Bowman is the perfect coach for this group of players at \nthis time. Johnson was the perfect coach two years ago for his \ngroup of players. I would say we have been very lucky here in \nPittsburgh that the order these coaches came in was this one. \n(Excluding the unfortunate circumstances which brought about the \nchange.) With the immense talent on the Penguins roster this \nyear, a tougher Bowman keeps the egos in check. Johnson on the \nother hand, was able to inspire the younger, inexperienced players \nto new heights. Both coaches have / had different strengths. Both \nof which came at exactly the right time. \n\nAnother person also mentioned that Bowman is the perfect coach \nfor this time since nobody can argue with his decisions. How can \nyou argue with the coach with the best record in hockey anyway? \nPlaying for a great coach like that demands respect which also \nkeeps the egos in check. \n\nJust a couple of ideas.
How much do you watch and follow hockey?  The Pens and Bruins will be in the\nsame division next season, which will give Neeley plenty of opportunity\nto whine about Ulf.
And Fleury is no enforcer. An agitator for sure, but Fleury never has and never\nwill have a fight, which seems to be what you're saying Wood is. \n\nThe closest Fleury ever came to fighting was a game two years ago against\nLos Angeles. There was a scrum and McSorley pinched Fleury's head under his\narm. Fleury dropped his gloves and gave McSorley a weak shot to the side of the\nhead. McSorely, knowing a good thing when he saw one, popped Fleury one right\nbetween the eyes. End of fight. Fleury got ten stitches for his trouble.\n\nThe only player I can ever see Theo fighting is Cliff Ronning, and even then\nhe'd be giving up two inches and 10-15 pounds. :-)
Here's a summary of Don Cherry's Coach's Corner from April 21, 1993.\nThe game being broadcast in my region was LA and Calgary, although\nI think it was filmed during the Toronto-Detroit game that night.\n\n(Warning... Anti-fighting people may want to skip this post.)\n\nTopics\n------\n\nDon's Tie, Grant Fuhr, Penalties, Wings vs Leafs, Fighting, Dale Hunter.\n\nEpisode Summary\n---------------\n\nThis episode began with the camera zoomed in on Don's tie. Don was\npointing out the characters on the tie... Bugs Bunny, Foghorn Leghorn,\nand Yosemite Sam (who Don called Lanny Macdonald.)\n\nRon Maclean began by mentioning that Don was almost evicted from a\nhotel where he was watching the previous night's games, because of\nall the yelling and cheering he was doing over the play of Hunter\nand Fuhr.\n\nDon began to praise Fuhr, calling him the "greatest goalie", and\nsaid that he's winning the series against Boston all by himself.\nHe then showed clips from earlier episodes (Nov. 14, Jan. 16) when\nFuhr was still with the Leafs, and Don advised "Don't Trade Fuhr!"\n\nDon went on to predict that if Buffalo gets by Boston, it would\nbe Fuhr who wins the series. Muckler took a lot of heat for the\ntrade, but Don feels Muckler's been vindicated.\n\nThe next topic involved how playoff games are being ruined by\ntoo many penalty calls. He showed a clip from a Winnipeg-Vancouver\ngame, where Domi hit a Vancouver player, and was given a 2 min. penalty.\nRon said that it was called a penalty because his stick was involved,\nbut Don stuck with the opinion that it was a good hit, with Domi\nhitting the Vancouver player with his shoulder. Don: "Its sad what\nthey're doing for hockey... a 5 minute penalty for a nosebleed."\n\nNext, they went to the playoff series between Detroit and Toronto.\nPeople in Detroit were calling Wendel Clarke "Wendy" for not fighting.\nHowever, Don pointed out that Probert was not fighting either.\n\nThis lead Don into a tirad about fighting and stickwork, and how\nbanning fighting leads to more high sticking: "It's like college\nhockey... The little wee guy with the visor is brave as anybody.\nThat's why you're seeing so much stickwork. Because they know you\nwon't drop your gloves and give them a shot. The rules are made\nby people who don't know what's going on in hockey".\n\nThe final topic Don discussed was Dale Hunter. Don pointed out\nthat he was leading the league in goals, and showed a clip\nof Hunter from a previous game. When he was younger, Hunter was\ntaught to "play to win", which differs from today's idea of\njust letting kids have fun.\n\nAt then end of the episode, they showed a clip from a coach's\ncorner, with the tape on fast forward, so that Don sounded like\none of the chipmunks.\n\nRating\n------\nTypical anti-fighting posturing, not too much humour, but some\ngood quotes.\n\nI'd give it a 7.0 out of 10.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   \  \                   |Allan Sullivan (allan@cs.ualberta.ca)\n    \  \                  |Department of Computing Science,\n     \  \_______          |University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.\n      \    ###  \     _   |---------------------------------------------------\n       \___###___\   (_)  |My opinions are mine and mine alone.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"It is amazing how much can be accomplished if no one cares who gets the\n credit..."          - U. of A.

> Bruins have never come back to win after falling behind 2-0 in\n > their entire 68-year history.\n\n   Which doesn't mean much since the statistics are mostly based on\nthe 5-game playoff format. But, yes, it looks dark for the B's. What a\ndisappointment.\n\n   Still, I think the problem is mental. They needed the saves Blue\ncame up with, perhaps he can offer something to mentally rally around.\n\n   Who do you think gets the start in game three? I hope it is going\nto be Blue. If the team can rally around him, maybe Moog can too.

I think a compromise would work; namely honouring personages in \nConference names, and using geographical references in the divisional \nnames.  Although I still do not think the move will draw fans to the\ngame; IMO it's a cosmetic change that Bettman and the owners _hope_ \nwill have an effect.  And it doesn't say much for the mentality of \nanybody it works on, either.  \n\n\nSurprise, I agree totally.  The points system is fine, if everybody at all\ntimes has played the same number of games.  Since this is almost never the\ncase, winning percentage is the way to go.  I don't particularly care if it \nis an "American" thing either, if it works.
As she said, the letter is addressed to Bettman.  The post (which, though\nhaving pretty much the same content, is an entirely different entity) was\naddressed to all.  When she puts the letter in the mail I doubt it will\nsay "To: All".  I figure she wanted to let people here see what was in it\nsince it is a topic that interests a lot of folks here.  That's an entirely \ndifferent purpose than sending the letter to Bettman.\n\nUnfortunately...\n\n\n\nThe "largest computer networks in the world" phrase is a definition of \nthe Internet, not a group as a whole that she claims to represent.  As\nfor the business of whether or not it is large, it is large compared\nto say, the number of folks on r.s.h. who are sending a letter to thank\nhim for changing the names, at least to this point.  And just for my\nown curiosity I thought I'd look up the "official" definition of large\nin the dictionary.  It reads:\n\nlarge - 1.  having more than usual power, capacity, or scope.    \n        2.  exceeding most other things of like kind in quantity or size.\n\nNow I have no idea how many letters Bettman may have gotten on the issue\nor how many people may have signed them.  65 people may be up there, \nthereby validating definition 2.  I would also wager that the geographical\nrange of signatures is quite large, which would give it a large scope.\n\n\nWhy would he be impressed with this unless it were "large"? \n\nI am of course assuming that you actually agree with what you are writing\nand are not simply trying to be a pain about the whole issue to hear\nyourself speak.  \n\nI personally don't know whether or not I agree with the letter.  I have\nvery mixed emotions about it.  I like the names as they are, and don't\nthink they make it that difficult to learn the game, but there might be\na shred of validity to the change.
Did anyone see the Montreal - Quebec game yesterday?  It was tight right down\nto the last second of the third period.  In the overtime Roy and Hextall played\nlike they were gods.\n  Ok, so Montreal won!  They deserved it after getting their first goal in\novertime waved off because the puck was hit in with a high stick.  Their second\ngoal in overtime was also replayed, but I could not tell if it was the Montreal\nplayer who kicked it in.  The puck definitely was not directed in by a stick.\nAnyways, Montreal is back into the series.
Unfortunately, that is the way the league is heading... You can't fight,\nso the only way to retaliate against someone is with a cheap shot when\nthe ref isn't looking. Ulf has brought this to a high level... Players\nstuck in the past (like Neely) who prefer fights to cheap shots\nare at a disadvantage in the new system.\n\nLets face it, A cheap shot (like high sticking) is a very effective\nmethod... It is easier to hide from the refs, has a better chance of\ncausing injury, and you can draw people into fights that way. I don't\nlike it, but that's the way the league is going.
While I will first congratulate the Blues for their victory, I think it must\nbe realized that the primary reason the Blues were able to win was Curtis   \nJoseph.  When a goalkeeper gets hot, there is little an opposing team can do.\nJoseph should be given the entire city of St. Louis, because otherwise there \nwould probably be a game 6 scheduled.  \n\nAs for the game on Sunday.  The Blues caught a few breaks, without a doubt.\nOne was the Referee constantly watching the Blackhawks, looking for reasons to\ngive them penalties.  Second, The Blues first goal resulted because the puck\nhit the linesman as the Blackhawks attempted to clear.  No linesman, no shot\nfor Brett(I can redirect anything)Hull to redirect.  On another of St. Louis'\ngoals, Belfour was tripped from behind as he went to make the save by someone\nwho didn't belong in the crease, which means it was a St. Louis player.\nFinally, the overtime goal was caused because someone kept Belfour from getting back to the crease.  No goalie, no way to stop the shot.\n\nI congratulate St. Louis for beating the Hawks.  It will be a shame to see\nBryan Murray finally advance to the Campbell Conference Finals because Joseph\nwon't be able to stop the powerful Red Wing attack.\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________________
Don't expect to get top quality, just some toughness.  I don't\n	view Makarov as a player who would add toughness.\n\n\n	Nelson, you're confusing skill and toughness.\n\n\n	Hey, get off the McGill/Hammond thing.  I'm no fan of either. My\n	point is that last year the Sharks had toughness that was missing\n	this year.  This year we had more skill, I'm all for that, but\n	if your skill players keep getting beat up and injured they\n	can't do you much good.  Whether it's a cheap shot or not you\n	can't let the other teams push you around.  The 1992-93 Sharks\n	simply got pushed around to much.  Other teams knew this.\n	They knew they could aggressively check the Sharks and not\n	pay for it.   Adding some players in the off season who will\n	add some toughness to the team will help insure that next\n	season other teams will be more hesistant to vigorously \n	check our skill players, or to take cheap shots.  It doesn't\n	guarantee no injuries (nothing does), but it's something the\n	Sharks can do to reduce the number of injuries.  \n\n	mark\n\n just say
Bufflo Sabres has just finished their great four wins over Boston. All\nSabres players contribute to those great wins but those talent players\nincluding Mogily, Fuhr, Kemhlev and Lafontin impressed me most. Their \nskills showed the art of sport, not like the garbage speech from the\ncoach's corner.
Considering how often and how badly he has slammed the Pens on Coach's \nCorner on Hockey Night in Canada, it would surprise me as well.  But then,\npeople will do anything for money, won't they?
YAHOOOOOOOOO!\n\nThe Habs tied this sucker at 2 and the teams now head for Quebec\nCity to play game 5.  BTW, final score was Habs 3-Nords 2.\n\nThe score might be a bit misleading.  The Habs dominated the game\nfrom the 5:00 mark of the first and then on.  The score should have\nbeen 8-2 if it weren't for some miraculous save from a Ron Hextall\n(bastard!).  He's the reason the score was as close.  Habs winning\ngoal was scored by Benoit Brunet at 1:07 of the 3rd.\n\nRoy had an OK game.  He made the first save (one way or another)\nand the defense was there to clear any rebounds.\n\nThis just in, ESPN radio reports that the Bruins lost 6-5 in OT.\nYAHOOOOOOOOOOO!!!  Those suckers got what they deserved.\n\nLife is just great!!!! Now if my finals would go just as well!\n\nNick (I'll take off my town crier hat now)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nHopefully EPSN will use the lesson given by the master: Ted Turner.\nThe season Ted introduced TNT, many cable co.'s refused to put it on,\nsaying that, gee we get enough old movies, miniseries, etc. on TBS,\nUSA, AMC, WGN, WOR, why do we need another one? This was in the fall.\nCome spring, Ted fixed their little red wagons good. The previous\nspring, NBA playoffs wore on TBS, now they were on TNT (and still are).\nAnd everyone gets TNT now.\n\nSo, ESPN should put NFL football and baseball on ESPN2, and leave\nhockey on ESPN. And if cable co.'s play games and drop ESPN\nin favor of ESPN2, ESPN should alternate baseball and football between\nchannels every week.\n\nBut, do the ESPN guys collectively have the gonads of the Turner guy?

Actually, that's based on the NHL's history of 7 games.  The statstical\nodds of winning one straight game -- 50/50.  Two straight games -- 25%.  Three\nstraight games -- 12.5%, 4 straight games = 6.25%.  The odds of the Penguins\nwinning 14 straight games in the playoffs was 0.0061%.  Of course, this doesn't\ninclude weighted average, but the Pens beating the Devils 3 straight (a weaker\nteam) along with beating the Rangers 3 straight (a much stronger team) has made\nthe act balanced out.  That's about right.  For Boston the odds of winning are\nprobably closer to 10% (with weighted average) since Buffalo's record isn't as\ngood and Boston has a stronger team.  Enough about my QBA probabilities though!\nIt's just goes to prove ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE, if you integrate that to Debbie\nGibson :-)\n\n\nMoog gets about ***'s out of 5 for his performance from me.  I give Blue 4\nstarts.  Fuhr has been too tough.  Buffalo caught a hot goaltender just in\ntime...I mean, after all, Buffalo is 3 wins, 7 losses in their last 10.\n\n\nIt's very frustrating to lose, and you've gotta say something.  Actually\nit's not about winning or losing, it is how you play the game.  But when the\ncompetition is magnified to this level, 99.9% of the people only care about\nwho wins or loses :-)\n\n\nI think Buffalo will win in 6 -- it's not like Boston is getting blown away.\nThey lost 2 OT games -- with a different bounce, they could easily be up 2-1.\n\n\nGood point here.  Chicago's in deep trouble tonight.  The 'Hawks have a bad\npast history of winning the division and losing early.  When they don't finish\n1st, they do okay.
And won't they have to change their name to the "Steelers" or something.\nThe only significant deposits of oil around Hamilton are those caused by\nthe tire fire a  few years back.
Disaster! Finland was beaten by Czech 1-3 (0-0,1-1,0-2).\nFinland will be 4th of pool B and will most certainly meet Canada in the\nquarter final on wednesday 28th. Lack of scoring skills has\nbeen the major problem of team Finland throughout the tournament.\nBriza (goalie)  was the MVP of  the Czech team and Tikkanen was the \nMVP of the Finnish team.
Sabres are\nFuhr or\nknow much\n\n\nTwo words: Grant Fuhr.
W --> \nW --> SEE! The Providence Bruins lost the first two games at home and came back to\nW -->      tie the series on the road, there may be hope for the Bruins yet!\n\nToast. They're toast.

Are the golf courses in the Boston \narea in playable condition yet?\n\n- Jack\n\n * Acid consumes 47 times its weight in life!
Not only have I not heard of the Western Business School, or the University\nof Western Ontario, I've never even wondered if there WAS a western\nOntario.  And judging by the quality of the posts coming from there, I'm\nstill not sure that the place exists.\n\nPerhaps I should be impressed, though, since it appears that grade school\nchildren in that area have access to the Internet.
much\nPure and Simple, Grant Fuhr is money.  He has been awesome in the playoffs,\nespecially last night.  But Mogilny has been scoring well, and his russian\nfriend Kymlev (sp?) has also done well.  But Fuhr is the biggest reason they\nare winning, and the difference between this year's team and previous years.
4/23/93    BLUES SHUTOUT HAWKS AGAIN, LEAD SERIES 3-0\n-----------------------------------------------------\nIt was a great atmosphere last night at the St. Louis Arena as Joseph and\nthe Blues shutout the Hawks for the second consecutive game. People were\ncheering the Blues long before face-off time, and they kept going for the\nentire game. My friends and I went out celebrating until the early morning\nhours with some of the players. Here's a game summary from the St. Louis\nPost-Disptach. Enjoy...\n\nBy Dave Luecking\nOf The Post-Dispatch Staff:\n\nAt 10:24 p.m. Friday night, The Arena crowd of 17,965 paid homage to Blues\ngoalie Curtis Joseph. The fans began bowing, their arms extended, taking the\nthe lead from a fan who held a sign that read ``Only God Saves More Than\nJoseph."  It was a fitting tribute to Joseph, who has brought the Blues to\nthe verge of a surprising sweep.\n\nJoseph recorded his second successive shutout Friday, blanking the Blackhawks\n3-0 in Game 3 of the Norris Division semifinals and giving the Blues a 3-0\nlead in the best-of-seven series.\n\nThe Blackhawks haven't scored against Joseph since the 8:51 mark of the second\nperiod of Game 1. Joseph has shut out the Blackhawks for 151 minutes 9 seconds,\na Blues record. Jacques Plante held the previous record of 146:28, set in the\nfirst round of the 1969 playoffs against the Philadelphia Flyers, one of only\ntwo series the Blues have sweeped in their history.\n\nThe Blues can wrap up their first sweep since 1969 with a victory in Game 4,\na nationally televised game that begins at noon Sunday. The Blues have had\nonly two sweeps in franchise history, both in 1969, when they swept\nPhiladelphia and Los Angeles en route to the Stanley Cup finals.\n\nThe shutout Friday was easier than on Wednesday in Game 2 when Joseph had to\nmake 47 saves. This time, the Blues held the shots down to 34, and the\nBlackhawks couldn't touch Joseph.\n\nWell, they touched Joseph, numerous times, shoving him and pushing him at \nevery opportunity to try to get him off his game. But Joseph and the Blues\nwere unfazed, dishing out their own punishment along the way.\n\nThe Blues' grinders -- Bob Bassen, Rich Sutter, Kevin Miller and Dave Lowry --\nwore down the Blackhawks, taking the visitors from Chicago off their game.\nThe grinders set the stage for the glamour boys, the gifted playmakers and\nscorers, who made the most of their opportunities.\n\nCraig Janney, Brett Hull and Nelson Emerson scored, getting one goal in each\nperiod. Hull assisted on Janney's first-period power play goal after two unwise\nChicago penalties. Checker Miller set up Hull's goal in the second period, and\nrookie Denny Felsner assisted for Emerson, who scored at 16:44 of the final \nperiod.\n\nBlues fans jumped to their feet in celebration of that goal and began yelling\n``Sweep. Sweep. Sweep." They also taunted Chicago goalie Ed Belfour \n``Bell-Four. Bell-Four." They also chanted ``Na, na-na-na, hey-hey good bye."\n\nSuch talk is a tad premature. There's still one game left, but the Blues are\non a roll. They have the Blackhawks on their heels.\n\nThe Blues set the tone early on Friday with two crunching hits in the first\nminute of play. Rich Sutter leveled Bryan Marchment, and Brendan Shanahan\ndumped Steve Smith at center ice.\n\nChicago tried to retaliate, but Troy Murray's decision to run into Joseph\nbackfired. Referee Dan Marouelli gave him a roughing penalty.\n\nThe Blues didn't get a shot on goal on the power play, and they survived a\nscare after Chicago killed the penalty when Rick Zombo gave the puck away to\nSteve Larmer. Joseph stopped Larmer's shot and everything else Chicago threw\nat him in the first period. The 'Hawks ignored the scouting report on Joseph\nabout shooting high and continued to shoot low, where Joseph's butterfly\nstyle is deadly.\n\nRookie Bret Hedican picked up three consecutive penalties midway through the\nperiod -- two for hooking and one for holding -- but Chicago got only two\nshots on goal, as many as Miller. The Blues' penalty killer twice stole the\npuck and just missed on good scoring chances against Belfour.\n \nMarouelli began calling penalties on the Blackhawks to even things up.\nHe caught Brent Sutter hooking Shanahan four seconds after Hedican's third\npenalty. He called Marchment for elbowing Janney along the boards at 14:58,\nand gave the Blues a two-man advantage 1:07 later when Christian Ruuttu\nslashed Shanahan.\n\nThe Blues worked around the puck on the ensuing power play, and Hull got it\nwhere he likes it -- in the high slot. Hull's shot hit Belfour's right\nshoulder, and the puck bounced precariously close to the goal line. Belfour\ndived back to cover, but the puck squirted loose to Janney, who poked it into\nthe net at 16:53 for his first goal of the playoffs.\n\nThe Blues continued their relentless hitting as the period ended, and the\nBlackhawks lost their composure. Joe Murphy tripped Ron Wilson with two seconds\nremaining in the period, and after time had expired Smith upset the Blues by\nshooting the puck into the Blues' bench.\n\nChris Chelios made a move toward Joseph as the teams left the ice, and\nMarouelli slapped him with a 10-minute misconduct. Chicago survived the Blues'\npower play, but the loss of Chelios hurt. He didn't return until the midway\npoint of the period, and within three minutes of his return, Hull had increased\nthe Blues' lead to 2-0, deflecting in Miller's crisp pass.\n\nTry as they might, the Blackhawks couldn't get to Joseph, who stopped\neverything they could throw at him. He stopped 12 shots in the second period\nand 13 more in the third. Chicago also hit the goalpost twice.\n\nEmerson's goal put the game away. He went hard to the net and redirected\nFelsner's pass.
Isn't he the guy who took shots at Jagr and Ulf in a recent Sports\nIllustrated? I'm not familiar with Cherry's work, and maybe he's known\nfor sarcasm, but I'd have to wonder about him doing commentary for the Pens.
fans into the game but surely they would rather see Broten taking a pass from\nKovalev and scoring a breakaway goal to put the Rangers up 3 (magic #) goals in\nthe third period, rather than seeing Kocur take another stupid penalty and the\nRangers giving up another powerplay goal! \n\nThe Rangers need another top flight center who can take the pressure off\nMessier and the first line.  Nemchinov is a perfect third line center.\n\nSo who goes Beezer or Richter?
I can understand your anger about the German audience. I mean, it was the\nFinnish team they played and they were taking advantage of the ridiculous\npenalties the Canadien ref called in the last period. The Germans got a\nmatch penalty and a 10 minutes misconduct for practically nothing and\nseconds after that the German goalie got two minutes for "delay of game"\nfor a shot that was deflected and went into the crowd. The resulting 5:3\nskating advantage lead to the deciding goal at a point, when the Germans\nwere starting to come up strong.\nI am also sick of the nationalism that is going on in German sports events.\nIf you watch for example a tennis Davis Cup match the players are often not\nable to play for minutes, because the crowd is so obnoxious. But I have to\nadmit that this kind of nationalism is as strong or even stronger in most\nother countries (you should go to the US and watch the way they present the\nOlympics on television; or the soccer crowds in England; or the Finnish\nspectators at nordic skiing events.....). I mean it makes me sick to see\nall this nationalism all over the world and I would rather see the best\nteam/player win and get cheared at. I do not mind if my favorite team\nlooses to somebody that is better or plays more attractive and I have to\nadmit that in most sports the German national site is not my favorite team\nto watch (the German soccer team is boring to watch, for example).\nBut, reading the above posting, I think that you are on the same level as\nthese crowds you are criticizing. It is easy to talk of (nearly all)\nGermans as Nazis and nationalists; thats the kind of propaganda that all\nultraconservative people use against Germany. It is true that there is a\ngreat danger of re-arising nationalism in Germany but from my experience\nmost of the people (at least of the people that i know) also regard this as\na big threat and are trying to demonstrate this attitude now. Why can't we\njust look at people as human beeings and not try to put them into drawers\ncorresponding to their nationality (eg. all Russians are Communists; all\nAmericans are Capitalists; all Germans are Nazis, all Fins are hanging\naround beeing drunk on ferries...). \nIn my opinion, your comment shows the narrowness of your mind and that you\ndon't seem to be different from the Nazis you are talking about.\n\nThomas
Them thar's fighting words...hardly a force...geez...miss the playoffs\nonce in 15 years, and even after making the final four 3 times in the\nlast five years, and everyone thinks its doomsville.\n\n\nFedorov, Primeau, Kozlov, Lidstrom, Sillinger, Konstantinov, Drake,\nKennedy, Racine, and Cheveldae were already in the pipeline due to\nDevellano...Murray inherited these guys...in addition to Yzerman,\nProbert, Carson, Chiasson, etc.\n\n\nNo...Quinn had far less...Murray took over Detroit at a time to \ntake advantage of all of Devellano's good drafting...if Devellano\nhad not given in to Demers request to make the Oates trade, he might\nstill be GM.
Could anyone post the game summary for the Sabres-Bruins game.
The tv coverage of the playoffs is fucking ridicules.  Overtime time games\n    that are not shown?  What the hell kind of shit is this?  If that would\n    have happened to the Flyers(if they were in the damn playoffs to begin\n    with) while I was watching, I would have gone throught the roof!\n\n    However, everybody is getting pissed off at ESPN, but they are not the\n    ones to blame.  They have prior contracts that they just can't simply break\n    whenever they want to.  The N.H.L. is to blame.  When they signed the\n    deal with ESPN, they had to know of this.  They had to know shit like this\n    would happen since they wouldn't have complete priority.  The N.H.L.\n    should be feeling the heat that is being thrown at ESPN.  How can the\n    N.H.L. do this to its fans? How dare they.  We are the ones that make the\n    damn league exist and they can't even televise complete playoff games for us to\n    watch!  They more I write about this, the more pissed off I get.  We must\n    let the N.H.L. know that  we expect a little better than this.  If anybody\n    out there knows how to go about doing this, let me and everybody else know.\n\n    Well I had to get that off my chest and while I'm at it....\n\n    Mario is the Michael Jordan of hockey.  All that fucker has to do is fall\n    on the ice and the closet guy to him gets at least 2.  Last night in the\n    3rd game between NJ and Pitt, he was being pushed while skating across the\n    front of the goal while trying to get a shot off.  The guy on him was\n    doing a good job, so he got off a weak shot, but then he decided to fall\n    to the ice. Then the fucking ref(Van Helloamend?) called the guy for\n    holding.  They replayed the play, and my roomate(who is clueless about\n    hockey) wanted to know what the NJ guy did to get a call, because it was so fucking obvious the NJ player\n    had both hands on his stick, and no, he did not trip him.  It is simple,\n    Mario gets touched, he falls to the ice, automatic 2.  But the thing that\n    really pissed me off is, Pitt scored the 3rd or 4th goal, I don't remember,\n    on the resulting PP and\n    eventually won 4-3.  His diving/calls makes a HUGE difference in the\n    outcome of a game.\n\n    They gotta stop the damn holding and interference that is so fucking\n    obvious. That is not hockey.  It allows inferior players to bring down the\nlevel of the better players, and allows inferior teams to beat better ones.\nThis has pissed me off for many years now, and it has improved somewhat.\nHowever, during the playoffs and 3rd periods, the damn refs must misplace\ntheir balls, because they sure don't make any calls that show that they got\nany.\n\n    All agreeing or disagreeing replies are welcomed.
-\n- I heard a story on the local sports news broadcast in Edmonton.\n- Oiler owner Peter Pocklington will be holding a press conference\n- next week. While the exact details are not known, it is believed\n- to concern the Oiler's future.\n-\n- Rumour has it that Pocklington signed a tentative lease arrangement\n- with Copps Collesium in Hamilton. During the press conference,\n- Pocklington may announce the deal. It is quite possible that\n- the deal may simply be a way to force Edmonton Northlands to\n- renegotiate the Oiler lease on the stadium.\n-\n- Northlands has offered to buy the Oilers for $65 million earlier,\n- but the offer was rejected immediately by Pocklington.\n-\n- As for me, my opinion is divided... Edmonton has been fairly\n- supportive of the Oilers. Even though they're a small market\n- team, they had many sellouts in the 80s. Even with the problems\n- that the team had this year, they still brought in more fans\n- than many teams in larger cities did. On the other hand, if\n- the team does move, there is no place more deserving than\n- Hamilton. Of course, how would that affect the grand\n- realignment scheme of Bettman?\n-\n\n  Following up on this, the provincial government has been asked by the\nOpposition to block any deal that Pocklington is offering to Hamilton.  The\ngovernment said that Pock is going nowhere!\n\n  Why don't I believe the government?  Wasn't it Pocklington who wanted to be\nTory leader 9 years ago?

: Unfortunately, that is the way the league is heading... You can't fight,\n: so the only way to retaliate against someone is with a cheap shot when\n: the ref isn't looking. Ulf has brought this to a high level... Players\n: stuck in the past (like Neely) who prefer fights to cheap shots\n: are at a disadvantage in the new system.\n\n: Lets face it, A cheap shot (like high sticking) is a very effective\n: method... It is easier to hide from the refs, has a better chance of\n: causing injury, and you can draw people into fights that way. I don't\n: like it, but that's the way the league is going.\n\n: By the way, there was a rather good hit by Ulf in the last Penguin-Devil\n: game. Managed to hit the NJ player in the face with a stick. (Must have been a\n: legal hit... After all, Ulf is a clean player and is allowed to do\n: things like that.)\n\nAre there any ex NHL hockey players out there who might care to\ncomment on this and end this ridiculously long discussion?
Yep, though my reasons for being relatively quiet are simple...last year\nI woofed when we went up 3-1 on the Canucks...and look where it got me.  :)\n\nDomi got tossed in the 2nd with a high-sticking major.  He had been\nplaying with Kris King and Stu Barnes...and it was this line that was\narguably the best in the first two games.\n\nDefinitely a good thing...every little cheer helps, Evan.  :)\nGood thing the net doesn't need a voice to operate...I won't have one\nSunday night when I get home, I hope.  White noise here we come!  ;)\n\nOne thing, I WILL say though...Vancouver can KEEP Steve Armitage and\nJohn Garrett as a broadcast team...those two are BAD, especially when\nyou are spoiled by Don Wittman.  (At least four or five times, Steve called\nBarnes Selanne.  Whoops! :)
Rob Niedermayer is a forward (center, I think) with the WHL Medicine Hat\nTigers.  His brother, Scott, is a defenseman (now with the NJ Devils).
: That's not inner calm.  It's boredom, and it's being spoiled.  The Arena's\n: been as quiet as a church on many nights this year; too many of us just\n: take winning for granted.  It's been seemingly forever since the team\n: lost, and we've forgotten what it's like to feel real excitement and\n: surprise at victory.\n\nAt least last night there was some excitement. The Pens \ndidn't have it wrapped up before the game was half over like \nthe previous two games. I'm not sure if NJ just rose up and \nplayed better or if the Penguins just started to play down \nsomewhat. Probably it was somewhere in between. New Jersey \nseemed much more aggressive last night in the Pens end. They \ndid much more swarming around, which at least kept an \nelement of suspense in the game. No question that Billington \nhelped make it more interesting also. Claude Lemieux didn't \nhelp the cause any though, with his ejection early in the \ngame. So, who's going to start in the Devils goal for the \n"final" game Sunday? ;-) Sorry. I couldn't help myself.
I'd like to echo these sentiments.  This is the worst coverage I can \n ever remember seeing on CBC.  As soon as the game ends, I can count to 30,\n and by that time, they've signed off the air.  No post game interviews,\n no updating of late scores, nothin'.  TSN is really putting CBC to \n shame.  I only hope the later round coverage improves, I mean, who\n really wants to see CBC PrimeTime News instead of hockey.\n\n My $.02,\n  Darren
Well, so are we, and we see it completely different than you. Guess it's a\nmatter of perspective.
: 	This comes indirectly from Al Morgani who works in the studio\n: for ESPN hockey.\n[Some text deleted]\n: 	ESPN is under contractual obligation to show baseball and COULD NOT\n: broadcast the OT of the hockey game.  Next year, ESPN2 will be introduced so \n: baseball fans can watch baseball and hockey fans can watch hockey.\n\nI hadn't heard about this new ESPN2. When is this new network\nsupposed to start? Sounds great to me! (as long as my cable co.\noffers it)
Lots of debate about the virtues of Bryan Murray vs Pat Quinn as a GM\ndeleted.  Randy Graca seems to think Murray is the best GM in the league.\nI think Quinn is one of several who are better.\n\n\nWhen Quinn took over Vancouver- several years ago, NOT LAST YEAR, they \nregularily missed the playoffs.  I can't recall if they missed the playoffs\nthe year before his hiring but they probably did.  Quinn has improved the\nteam from non-playoff calibre to a serious contender.\n\nWhen Murray took over in Detroit, the were about a .500 team that was a\ncontender to win the Norris division and possibly even a Stanley Cup\ncontender.\n\nSo Quinn has improved his team more than Murray has since taking over as a GM.\nQuinn is one example of a better GM than Murray.
Are there any Montreal Canadiens fans out there who can let me the radio\nstation(s) which are playing the playoff series (including short wave radio\nfrequencies)?  Lewisburg, PA (home of Bucknell University) is definitely\nnot a hockey town! \n\nPlease send responses to malinich@bucknell.edu
Whoa there!  Lighten up, Andrew!  When I was referring to "you dorks at\nthe Western Business School", I was specifically referring to those\nassholes writing obnoxious comments insulting the state and people of\nMinnesota for no apparent reason.  Being Canadian, and one who has\nfriends who attended UWO, I personally don't want to be associated with\nthe idiots who wrote those messages.  One more thing, Andrew...until\nthis season, the Leafs have sucked pretty badly over the last umpteen\nyears (have they won the Cup during our lifetime?)...so the North Stars\nhaven't been the only "shit" team in the Norris.
It was Clint Malarchuk\n\nWhatever happened to him, anyway?
Okay, the Caps AGAIN are about to break out the golf clubs but before they\ndo, does anyone have the history of the Washington Capitals' futility\nrecord in the playoffs? I remember that Terry's first year was the first\nyear that the Caps finally made it to the third round but before under\nBrian, I noticed that every other year the Caps got to the second round\nand the years in between they didn't make it past the first round. Is this\ntrend continuning? \nThe Admiral, a hopeless Caps fan.\nP.S. We still remember that 3 OT loss to the Islanders! Aurggghhhhhhhhh!\n____________________________________________________________________________\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Well that's really great Pat.  I guess since you've played a little you thereby \nqualify as an expert.  Especially since you watch all the games on t.v.  All \nthat qualifies you as is a armchair quarterback or a coach potato\n\nPat Walker
I believe that the large number of digits on his paycheck (and\nit would not be binary) would help Don to be a fan of Ulf!, Jaro, and\nMario.

Well, on the contrary, I thought Dave was rather taken with her and her\naccent..."(H)ockey is my passion"...
Actually it was in the third period, his return did bring a spark to the\ncrowd, and to the players, who played awesome defense in the third.\n\n\nYou forgot about Gretzky.  If any of these guys start scoring, the Kings\nwill be unstoppable, if they continue the great defensive work as well.\n\n\nStauber will be in net on Tuesday.  Hopefully he will provide another\nstellar performance and earn the name Robb "Stopper" Stauber.\n\n\nI believe this is how they are...I know it is Gretzky and Sandstrom, but he\nhas been putting a number of people on left.  Also the Carson, Robataille\nKurri line once ignited, will light the fire of the other lines.\n(Hopefully!)\n\nIt is evident that the scoring drought is getting to Luc, after his slight\nbreakaway in the third (I think) he was steamed on the bench, this emotion\nmight help him break his streak.  Also, I have noticed Blake has had a few\nreally good chances to score, but has fanned, or shot wide.  Is the injury\nstill affecting him?  \n\n\nThe E\n    D\n    G\n    E
I would argue Gerald, that Bowman is the first "modern" coach.\nBowman's Canadiens were the first NHL team to have a weight-room\nin the 70s.  He is the first coach I have seen, that manipulates\nthe press into spreading false game plan rumours.  (During important games\nlisten to the pre-game interview will Bowman and compare that to\nwhat is on the ice!)  I agree Bowman is a master of the lineups. \nRemember last year in the SC when he benched Jagr only to set him free \nin OT.  When Jagr banged in the winning goal I thought this was\ntrademark Bowman and also a sign of a modern coach!\n\nI am left asking "What is a modern coach if not Bowman?"
Add Boston's WEEI-590AM as the Bruins' flagship station. You probably won't\npick it up anywhere outside of Boston since it's only a 5,000 watt\nstation. The Bruins also have network stations in all 6 New England\nstates.\n\nThis could be the Bruins' last year on 'EEI which also happens to be an\nall-sports radio station. The problem is that the Bruins are not too happy\nbeing moved over to a different station(WMEX 1150AM) whenever there\nis a the same-night conflict with the NBA's Boston Celtics. This happened\n28 times during the course of the regular season.(The Celtics own financially\ntroubled WEEI). The Bruins might resurface on WHDH 850 next year. Stay\ntuned.
Awesome home record or not, you need to remember the 7th game last year at the\nAud.  I'd like to see some playoff games since I'm stuck in Buffalo at UB, but\nI think Boston isn't giving up so easy.
Come on Boston, where the hell are you? Seven wins in a row and what, choke?\n\nI'd much rather see the Bruins in the Wales Conference finals vs. Pitt than\nBuffalo or Quebec, if only because it would be more interesting.  Not that\nBuffalo or Quebec can't put up a good fight, but I'd much more enjoy a 7-0\npasteing of the Bruins than the Devils.  You have to feel for Terrerri(sp?).
that\nhis\npositive.\n\n	Clint Malarchuk\n\n\n  What has happened to him since?\n\n	Assigned to San Diego Gulls at the being of the season I believe\n\n  What\n\nIt was Uwe Krupp and a Blues player, though Uwe's skate I beleive cut  \nClint.  He has since be traded to the Isles in the LaFontaine deal.\n\n  Has this ever\n\nThis is the only time I know of.
Wood is fairly small for an enforcer-type. I mean, Fleury does a pretty good\njob and isn't that large, but Dody is no Fleury. \n\nHaving been witness to three or four of his fights closeup, he simply isn't\nready to fight at an NHL level (assuming that it's his role, which is ALL he\nreally showed us in his few games up from K.C. -- if he can pass, shoot or\nskate, I never saw much of it). All he has is a right fist, which isn't bad,\nbut at the NHL level, the other players are smart enough to grab the thing\nbefore he can land anything significant. Once you control that hand, he's a\nfish flopping on the beach and the other player can do just about anything\nhe wants to him. His entire strategy seemed to be keep the hand out of reach\nuntil he found an opening -- and I never once saw him find an opening worth\ntalking about. He got neutralized quickly, and stomped on a couple of times.\n\nUnless he shows some new tricks in camp, he'll be on my "career minor\nleaguer" list. Since this was his first taste of the NHL, I expect the\nSharks gave it to him so he'd KNOW what he'd have to work on off-season. He\nneeds to get stronger, he needs to get more speed and he needs to show some\nversatility as something else than a simply goond, because he wasn't\nparticularly good as a goon.
Does anyone have the player stats for games played up until\nApril 22,1993.
I think that Grant Fuhr deserves more credit than that!\nWhile it's true that the entire Sabres team played very well, I\nstill believe that if it wasn't for Grant Fuhr, the series would\nnow be tied 2-2. He virtually stole games 1 and 3 for the Sabres.\nIn both of these games, Fuhr stood on his head to give the Sabres\nthe chance to win. Especially in game 3, Fuhr made a series of\nhuge stops in the third period when the score was tied 2-2. \nEven in game 2 when the Sabres won 4-0, the score seemed to\nindicate that the Sabres dominated. However, if it hadn't been\nfor Fuhr, the Sabres wouldn't have been up (2-0 I think it was)\nthrough the 2nd period and the Bruins wouldn't have had to open\nup the game (thereby allowing Mogilny to score the third goal on\na breakaway to salt away the game).  There\nis no doubt in my mind that Fuhr was the critical factor in the\nvictory. \n\nIn my opinion, Neely, Oates and Juneau played as well as\nLaFontaine, Mogilny and Hawerchuk. The Sabres did get\nextraordinary efforts from Hannan, Sweeney, Wood, and Khmylev\n(compared to that of the Bruins checkers). However, the Bruins defense\n, IMO, played better than the Sabres defense (the Sabres have Ken Sutton\nplaying a regular shift afterall ;-)\nThe difference in the series was Fuhr, who outplayed Andy Moog. \n\nGary
They _finally_ started going to the net!  See what happens when you \ncreate some traffic?  Muller deserves full marks (what a player!),\nand Damphousse finally started skating.  Roy (thankyouthankyouthankyou)\nwas excellent.  Did you see that third period save on Young?  And the \ndefense was taking out Quebec players in the zone.\n\nAnybody else wonder if Hextall will feel like a dweeb when he finds \nout that the winning goal went in off his own D-man's skate?  Whatta\nsuck.  Although he _is_ playing really well.\n\n\nSure it does.  On Sunday when the B's are golfing and the Habs are tied\n2-2 you'll see what I mean! :-) :-)
It was Clint Malarchuk's neck cut by Uwe Krupp's skate.  I know it happened in\nBuffalo, but I can't tell you against whom.\n\nKrupp was defending an opposing attacker charging the net.\n\nMalarchuk became the fourth goalie (behind Hasek, Puppa and Draper) after\nsuffering from Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.  He's been playing in San Diego\nfor former Sabre coach Rick Dudley.\n\nKrupp is now playing for the Islanders after the LaFontaine/Turgeon trade.\n\nWhat do I win?  =)
Reports in Ottawa today say that the Senators have come to a verbal\nagreement with last seasons first pick and 2nd overall choice Alexei\nYashin on a 5 year deal. As well the Senators have signed their second\nround pick Chad Penney who is currently playing for the Sault Ste. Marie\nGreyhounds in the Ontario Junior league playoffs.
It was a classy move.  But it looks like ESPN is going to devote most of\nthe coverage to the Pens.  On Tuesday night, they continued to broadcast\nthe Pen-Devil game even though Pittsburgh had the game well in control.\nGranted they did show some "bonus" coverage of the Caps and Isles but\nthey cut away from the close game, which went into double ot, to update\nus on the fifth goal of the rout.\nThursday was a good game even if it was the second straight game between\nthe pens and devils.  IMHO they should program some variety into the\ntelecasts.(Yes I know the game shown on saturday is between the B's and\nSabres, probably throwing a bone to us Bruin fans.)\nAnd what about the Cambell conference?  I'd like to see a game in the\nNorris or Smythe.  Why not have back to back nights of National\nHockey Night?\n\nJust a thought.
Oh really?  I seem to remember this year's woofers consisting mainly of\nyourself and Roger.  Boston fans were relatively quiet.\n\n\nI guess the concept of a fan who is not cocky is something you couldn't\npossible understand, eh?\n\n\nNah.  I doubt you really would.  You're just being a PROVOCATIVE SOB\nas usual with a large stick up your but.  Of course, I mean that in the\nnicest way.  :-)  \n\nAnd just how much bragging did YOU do, "wobbie," on r.s.b.c after \nUMASS!!! beat your Quakers?\n\nBTW.  Congratulations should go to the Sabres.  They are playing more\ndiciplined, and with more will to win.  They deserve it.
Ah well, another Brian Sutter team is ground into the dirt with intensity\nduring the regular season and then is burned out by playoff time.\nYah Fuhr has been awesome so far, but really you'd think Sutter would have\nlearned his lesson about pushing his team too far during the regular season.
Well, as a hockey fan, I think it's terrible. It's one thing to say, "Hey, \nlet's give a hockey team to cities that don't have one!" -- that's fine. It's\nentirely another to say, "Okay, let's take a team from a thriving hockey town\nand move it!" \n\nOf course, none of us will ever know the real inside story, but\nfrom what I know, a group of Minneapolis businessmen told Green repeatedly that\nthey would purchase the remaining 3600 (?) season tickets to get to the 10,000\nlevel that Green wanted, yet he refused every time. It's pretty obvious that he\nwas determined to get out of Minneapolis at any cost and use the season tickets\nthing as an excuse. \n\nI was fortunate enough to get to the penultimate game, and\nthe fans were great! People were tailgating and playing roller hockey in the\nparking lot before the game, the attendance was so full as to have SRO, and the\nwhole atmosphere in the Centre was terrific. Minnesota IS Hockey, USA. How the\nNHL can so blithely let the major league team from there move away is beyond \nme. I only hope they get a new team soon.\n\nJust my $0.02.\n\n\n-- Ali.

The Swedes continued to make mistakes as Howald\n was allowed to skate in between the Swedish D and put the puck past Tommy\n to make it 0-2. 0-3 was a nice one, Howald entered the Swedish zone, slammed\n on the breaks, and his shot went in by Tommy's far post. One of the lousiest\n periods I've seen Sweden play this year.\n Second period saw a new Swedish team, and the Swiss had to ice the puck many\n times. On a pp, Nylander skated in from the boards, Pavoni made the initial\n save, but Peter Andersson scored on the rebound.  Then a power play goal\n from the Swiss, a slap shot from the blue line hit two players on the way\n to the goal and past Soderstrom also. Jonas Bergqvist made it 2-4 after a\n nice pass from Naslund behind the goal. Jan Larsson reduced the lead to 3-4\n just before the end of 2nd period, on a pp skated in unattacked in front of\n the goal, and put the puck through Pavoni's 5-hole. \n Third period, Sweden equalized on a slap shot from Renberg that trickled\n through Pavoni's 5-hole. Then, another defensive mistake by the Swedes,\n Waeger was allowed to skate around the Swedish goal unattacked and from close\n range could make it 4-5. Hollenstein then scored 4-6 on a 2-on-1 break away,\n and put it top shelf with no chance for Soderstrom.\n\n Switzerland:\n\n Goaltender:  20 Reto Pavoni  (28 Renatio Tosio)\n Defense:     26 Rick Tschumi, 2 Martin Steinegger\n              16 Sven Leuenberger, 5 Martin Rauch\n               7 Sandro Bertaggia, 17 Patrick Sutter\n              31 Samuel Balmer\n Forwards:    22 Alfred Luthi, 11 Felix Hollenstein, 25 Roman Waeger\n              23 Gil Montandon, 12 Roberto Triulzi, 10 Patrick Howald\n              35 Christian Weber, 18 Andreas Ton, 24 Joerg Eberle\n              15 Bruno Erni, 13 Thomas Vrabec, 29 Manuele Celio\n \n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n RUSSIA - CANADA  1-3 (0-2,1-1,0-0)\n\n 1st: CAN 0-1 Kevin Dineen 1     (Garry Galley)                       4:28\n      CAN 0-2 Paul Kariya 2      (Eric Lindros)                      12:20 (pp)\n 2nd: CAN 0-3 Eric Lindros 10    (Paul Kariya,Shayne Corson)          9:40\n      RUS 1-3 Valeri Karpov 2    (?)                                 16:24\n 3rd:\n\n Penalties: RUS 2*2min 1*5min, CAN 5*2min\n Referee: Anton Danko, Czech republic\n Attendance: 8,600\n\n Russia probably made their best game of the tourney, but yet there wasn't\n enough to win against the effective Canadians.\n\n Galley took a slap shot that found Dineen by the far post, and Dineen just\n deflected the puck past Trefilov in the Russian goal. Then a power play\n goal, after a couple of deflections Eric Lindros found Kariya alone by the\n far post, and Kariya put the puck high over a sliding Trefilov.\n Russia won the shots in the first period 12-5, and they had the most of\n the scoring opportunities, but they just couldn't score.\n Second period saw Lindros scoring his 10th (!!) goal of the WC. Kariya\n entered the Russian zone, slammed on the break to get past his defenseman,\n then made a nice pass to Corson who just got the stick on the puck to\n deflect it to Lindros who one-timed the puck.\n The Russians then finally got their goal, Karpov broke in from the side\n and made a slap shot in Tugnutt's top right hand corner.\n \n Player of the game in Canada was voted Paul Kariya, and for Russia Valeri\n Karpov. I agree, the difference in this game was Lindros and Kariya, and\n in part also Tugnutt. Kariya had a far better game now than vs the Swedes,\n and he was very impressive. Kariya got the place in the line with Lindros\n after Mike Gartner went out with a rib-injury early in the first period.\n\n Lindros, BTW, lead the point scoring with 14 pts (9+5) before this game,\n 7 pts ahead of the next player! i.e. double as much as the next player\n (among those Kariya with 1+6).

Charles Hubbert writes...\n\nChevy has let in 2 or 3 soft goals so far, but they all didn't matter.\nHowever, his recent history has been inconsistant play but comes up\nbig when it counts.  The score was 4-0 I think when the goal you mentioned\nwas scored.  In the third period when it looked like Toronto was coming\nback, Chevy was exceptional.  I can see him as a Barraso style playoff\ngoalie:  inconsistant when there's nothing on the line,\nbut comes up big when really needed.  I guess we'll both find out.\n\nRon
Do you notice that _nobody_ on the team is willing to take charge?\nA dominant defenceman would be nice....too bad Schneider got hurt.\nHe reminds me of Chris Chelios sometimes.  Speaking of Chelios, I \nwonder if Serge Savard feels like a moron for making that trade.\nI also wish we still had Corson.\n\nRob Ramage on the ice is less useful than a Gatorade bottle on the \nbench.\n\nVincent Damphousse has decided to take a vacation, apparently.  I have\nno idea why Demers is playing Denis Savard on the checking line with\nCarbonneau.  Savard is skating well, and is one of the only dangerous\nCanadiens in Quebec's zone with the puck.  Too bad nobody is in front\nmost of the time.\n\nDo you also notice that in the defensive zone, not a single Nordique\ngets knocked down?  It's disgusting.  We also have Lebeau (5'10", 172)\ngetting pasted at centre ice by Wolaninn (6'3", 205) with no reply\nfrom the team, except to yell for a penalty.  Dammit, Denis Savard \nthrew the best (only?) Montreal hit of the night when he knocked\nSundin off-balance.  When Denis Savard is your team's enforcer, there's\nbig trouble someplace...\n\n\nAside from that second goal, Roy did stand on his head.  The third \nperiod at least provided something to look forward to.  Habs won the\nperiod, IMO, and I guess somebody finally came along to smack them a\ncouple of times in the second intermission to remind them that a game\nhad started at 7:30.  Hopefully they play that way at home.  Roy made \nthe saves (we'll ignore that second goal), so now it's up to the team.\n\n\n--\ndchhabra@stpl.ists.ca

So this year you had a game on SCNY, a game on SCA, a game on ESPN,\nand if the Rangers hadn't crashed and burned, you would have had a\ngame on MSG.  What are you complaining about?\n\nI seem to recall last year everyone complaining about SC coverage.  I\neven remember Orioles' games being shown in the DC area instead of\nhockey.  And what about when SC failed to show the conclusion of other\ngames because its feature game was over?  Sound familiar?\n\nThis year I'm getting twice the coverage.  I can see all the Caps\ngames *plus* the games ESPN shows.  I think it's great that hockey is\nback on ESPN.  IMHO, they're doing a great job especially considering\nthe baseball contract they have to work around.\n\n--
Geez, I didn't realize things were so bad at Ohio State that they can't\nafford phone books, or even operators.\n\nThis is probably Clinton's fault, isn't it...8^)\n\n403.
NESN owns the rights to Bruin telecasts.  I suspect that NESN was only\ngoing to sell one telecast to ESPN (remember, ESPN only owns exclusive\nrights to the FINALS, not the entire playoffs).  Since ESPN bought the\nSCA contract, there are less wrangles to untie with showing the Devils\nand Penguins.\n\n\nI think the same broadcast rights factor comes into it.  Plus they\nhave no way of fitting western game times into their current schedule\nunless the NHL was willing to make a western club move up their game.\nI think the NHL got as much as it could when it shuffled the deck for ABC.\n\n\nSame exact coverage as last week:  Pit-NJ game 4 in the east, Chi-StL\nin the central, LA-Cgy in the mountains and west.
Kelly Kisio was the captain of the Rangers when he left for San Jose.\n\n\n-- Ali.

It is indeed nice to have fans that are concerned about the dearth of\ndisputatious dissertation linked to my hiatus.  Have simply been too\ndamned busy lately to keep you lads and lassies entertained.  You can\nbe sure, however, that I will somehow manage to find time to woof if \nthe Leafs give just cause. \n\nAnd let's all try to keep people's names (especially mine) out of the\nsubject headers.  I, for one, neither seek nor enjoy such a cheap form\nof notoriety.\n\nOne thing you can be assured of, however, is this: the Leafs are the\nbest of all the teams in the league that have allowed 12 goals in 2 \ngames.\n\n\n--
Antonio,you weren't alone.\n\nABC ratings were very good. I was schocked to hear that ABC's telecast\nwas the fifth most watched sporting event over the weekend. National\nrating came out to a very respectable 3.3. Top-29 Nielsen markets were\nat 2.9. In Boston,the game scored lower at 2.4 but it had some competion\nfrom local sports teams.\nQuite frankly, I expected ABC's ratings to be under 2.0. But I'm happy\nto be proven wrong!\n\nWell,well...Sometimes it pays off clicking away on your cable-tv remote\ncontrol.:-) And if you happen to be a hockey fan,you could just stumble\nupon a playoff hockey game...\n\nESPN picked up Detroit-Toronto game on Monday night because the only\nnight game in MLB was being rained out in Chicago. You have to give\nESPN credit for switching to Detroit's FOX-50 coverage and having Bill\nClement at a Pittsburgh's TV station(WATE?) for intermission analysis.\nMaybe,ESPN people were giddy over perliminary over-night ABC ratings\nfor Sunday's telecast and thought it was a good idea to feature the\nNorris division showdown rather than a monster truck competion.\nGood move,ESPN!
You wouldn't have to put my name at the bottom if you simply appended a \nstandard disclaimer that the opinions expressed in your petition in no\nway claim to represent the views of either rec.sport.hockey or the internet\nas a whole.

For those of you who complain about Don Cherry, and wonder why he is\npopular...\n\nthe reply is Dick Vitale and John Madden and Bobby Knight and\nJoe Garagiola and Howard Cosell.\n\nJohn Madden picks Gary Clark of the Redskins for his All-Madden team\na lot, over much better receivers...for much the same reasons Cherry\nsings the praises of Doug Gilmour...a little guy with heart...yet one\ndoesn't see a string of American posts saying that John Madden has\nlost his marbles.\n\nDick Vitale is always promoting this kid from this high school or\nthat college with outrageous statements.\n\nWhy should Americans expect that Canada would not have such characters\nin relation to our greatest passion...which is hockey?   Canadians\nare very similar to Americans...culturally our sports are just hockey\nand curling, whereas with Americans it is football/basketball/baseball\nand bowling.
I remember reading an article in Reader's digest many moons ago\n about a similar incident. During a minor leaque game a player neck was\n cut when the opponent he was back-checking tripped and his skakes\n flew up. In this case the victim's mask proved a hinderance since\n his face was protected and so he didn't bother with the\n usually instinctive reaction to protect his face/neck. A quick        \n thinking coach saved his life by applying direct pressure and using\n snow to contract the blood vessels (from what I can remember).
Have Belfour and Roenick done another disappearing act at chips are \n down time?  When I saw them it looked like the Blackhawks' defense\n might carry them along way in the playoffs.  \n\n Well they held St. Louis to 17 shots in game 2 and lost.
: \n: Speaking of Paddock--what's he doing slagging Sandlak?  If Sandlak puts  \n: his mind to it, he can be a physical presence and waking him up might be a  \n: real mistake.\n\n	Isn't Sandbag out with an injury now anyways?  Perhaps Paddock\nmeant to say that Momesso was the cheap short artist.  After all, that\nwould make more sense.
Or a Caps fan residing in Atlanta, where they DONT EVEN TELL\nTHE F&@(*@CKING PLAYOFF SCORES ON THE NEWS!!!!!
Wake up and smell the Norris!!  Rick Zombo was traded to the Blues for Vince\nRiendo (sp?) last season.

That's not inner calm.  It's boredom, and it's being spoiled.  The Arena's\nbeen as quiet as a church on many nights this year; too many of us just\ntake winning for granted.  It's been seemingly forever since the team\nlost, and we've forgotten what it's like to feel real excitement and\nsurprise at victory.\n\nWhile I'm glad to have the Pens doing so well, in some ways it was a better\nhigh back when the Pens beat the Bruins two years ago, and the Rangers last\nyear. Too much of a good thing is not always good for you.
Yes, he does.  BUT, the goalie sure as hell doesn't want him there!  When\nI played roller hockey (boy do I miss those days) as a goalie, I would\nscream at my defense to clear guys out of the slot.  I don't care if he's\nin the crease or not, get him the hell away from me so I can see the ball!\n(Yes, roller hockey, remember)  And if there was nobody around to clear\nthe slot, then I'd do it myself by pushing the offending player--*hard*. \nI *hate* people in my way when I'm the goalie, and I am sure Felix does\ntoo.  I should say that I didn't see the incident, so if Potvin really\nswung the stick big time, then that's not right, but he can move people\nout of the way.  He's a player on the ice too, you know.  :-)
Exactly my point.  If you'd watch games more closely, you'd see a lot \nof goons going after him.  Ulf is one of the main reasons why less physical \nplayers for Pgh are left alone.  Ulf plays rough hockey, but only when \nother players are putting the rush on Mario or Jagr.  If you want to say anyone\non the Penguins is a cheap shot or a goon, say it's Jennings or Caufield.  Don'tslander a good defenseman because your favorite players can't beat the Pens\neven when they take dives (like Gartner) to try for the cheap penalties.\n\n\nHey, that's fine!  If a player does something stupid, he should be penalized\nincluding Ulf.  Or Mario (you're not likely to see that happen) or anyone else for that matter.  It's pointless to say any one person is a cheap-shot goon,     because you'll see EVERYONE take a cheap shot now and then, especially if you'resomeone who is shadowed as much as Ulf is.
Perhaps it was the most exciting game played yet that YOU have seen.  For\nmost of us who watch teams around the league with interest and objectivity, \nit was *nowhere* *near* the most exciting game...\n\n\nUnfortunately, the instant replay is not used on hits.  At first, I\nimmediately thought "5 and a game" because the hit _looked_ much more severe\nfrom an intent-to-injure perspective than it was.  After seeing the replay,\nI'd say it deserved 2-4 minutes for boarding (it was careless any way you \nslice it).  If Stewart had replay, I do not think Chaisson would have gotten\n5 and the game.\n\n\nThis no-call was bullshit, I agree. I admire Stewart for letting them go, but\nProbert *looked* *up* saying where the hell is the penalty?  I've never\nseen Probert whine either (he doesn't need to).  Now, if Probie\ndecides to put Wendel through the boards, he's probably gone, right?\n\n\nThis was also bullshit.  But once again, no replay.  It was Rouse, btw. I'm\nreally pissed that the linesmen didn't correct the call either....it's b.s.\nwhen the officials refuse to admit they made a mistake.  \n\n\nYes.  The calls you describe should not have the difference in a Detroit\nloss.  I picked the Leafs to win Game 3 on emotion and adrenalin, but the\nWings have no excuses for Game 4.  They should be the superior team.\n\nThe call that pissed me off the most was Anderson getting 4 for putting his\nstick in somebody's eye.  That was _the_ most dangerous stick infraction I\nhave seen in a long time, and everybody in the damn league _knows_ he's an\nasshole when it comes to stickwork.  Four lousy minutes.  Bullshit call. \nMurray should send the tape in.  Or a Wing should hammer the living shit out\nof him.
The overhead replay pretty clearly showed that it was the Quebec \ndefender who deflected the puck.  The re-play officials did not \ntake nearly as much time to make this call as they did for the first \nnon-goal, so it seemed pretty non-controversial.\n\nI agree that it was a great game; good to see Roy and Damphousse back\ninto form.  Hopefully the sign of good things to come...
Such as?
What the hell are U talking about? ESPN showed Pens/Devils game as advertised.\n  BUt the morons at ESPN should know that Pens will kick Devils ass and the\n  game will be boring. I'd rather see Boston/Buffalo game which seems to be\n  an exciting series since noone had expected Buffalo to get past the first\n  round. \n\n  Well let's hope they change their mind on THU's game and show some other\n  game. The Pens series is really getting boring. I want to see some \n  exciting game no matter who wins. If NHL wants a major network contract\n  then they better put some brains in ESPN people.
Hooray, I hear on TSN that the Jets have won a game, Selanne\ngetting a hat-trick!\n\nOf course, here in GOD'S COUNTRY (read Ontario!) I couldn't\nsee that game, nor any other in the VAN-WPG series so far,\nbecause our beloved CBC figures no one out here cares about\nthis series (which has looked pretty competitve so far...\n\nOn Monday and Wednesday nights, CBC could have shown the Toronto-\nDetroit game, done the news, then picked up Winnipeg-Vancouver.\nThey didn't.  Tonight?  You guessed it, Toronto-Detroit, the\nnews (not the end of the Jets game), then Calgary-LA.\n\nSO, if it's "Hockey Night in Canada", why can't this Ontarian see\none of the two series with two Canadian teams?  Is this too much to\nask?

Yes and No. ESPN2 will be launched as early in September. Cap Cities\nare currently working with cable companies to ensure a good start-up\nbase needed for a launch for any brand new cable service.\n\nThe problem ESPN2 faces is the TCI-Cablevision connection in the\nmerger of their Prime and SportsChannel networks. Prime SportsChannel\nwill try to wrestle away NHL from ESPN in the off-season. Also,TCI\nand Cablevision have control a large number of cable systems around the\ncountry with a total of 15 million subscribers. TCI-Cablevision will\ndo their best that ESPN2 never gets off the ground successfully. And the\nNHL's value will suddenly skyrocket in this cable war between Prime SC\nand ESPN. NHL is more vital to the survival of a regionalized Prime\nSportsChannel since they virtually have no national major league sports\ncontracts and only cover local NHL/NBA/MLB sports teams.
I heard yesterday that Pocklington was talking with folks at Copps\nthat afternoon (yesterday).
Speaking of Roger and ilk, whatever happened to good ol' gln?  I had him in\nmy kill file since last year's playoffs and now that I've moved to a new\nnews reader which doesn't have kill files, I find that he's gone.  I must\nadmit, however, that unlike gln, Roger seems to know something about the game\nas long as the subject doesn't touch on the Leafs.
Still here. Just doing a little sobbing in our beer so we're to busy to\npost :-)\n\nSeriously I think I caught a .sig curse from Nelson :-)\nFirst the $%@#$%$ Rangers and $50 now the B's......\nHmmm....How bout dem Whalers? (No offense to steveg or others)
In the Boston area, you can hear the Rangers on WFAN and the Devils\non WABC, the Whalers on WTIC and the Red Wings on WJR. This of course is in\naddition to the Bruins who are currently on WEEI but may move to WHDH because\nthe fools at WEEI are owned by the Celtics and thus will show them over the\nBruins every time there is a conflict. You can also get WBAL Baltimore but\nI don't think they have hockey. BTW, I once got a station from Indiana that\nhad Fort Wayne Comets games.
They did last world cup and eventually lost tp Sweden in the final!
And it is a damn good thing that she did post it since she claims to represent\npeople in rec.sport.hockey.\n\n\n\nHer sole purpose in mentioning the net, as Steve Gallichio has already \npointed out, is to lend weight to her points through association with the\ninternet.  There is no other reason to mention the internet.  This is \nmisrepresentation and if the internet was a private corporation Alison\nwould be leaving herself wide open to all kinds of civil suits.\n\n\nThis is not a letter.  It is a petition claiming to represent a large\nproportion of rec.sport.hockey users, and by implication, a significant\nnumber of internet users.  65 names can in no way be considered a \n"large" proportion of rec.sport.hockey which, while we have no way of\ncounting actual readership, is accessible to hundreds of thousands of\npeople.  65 persons is no more than a fly's fart in a windstorm.\n \n\n\nGee.  You looked up "large" in the dictionary?  What next?  Two syllable \nwords?\n\n\nLet me suggest that the only place you are likely to envy the magnitude of \n65 is when you are looking for ways to beef up your IQ scores.\n\n\n\nAs I said, he *might* be impressed by the size of the list of names.  But \nit would have to be considerably larger.  But even this definition does\nnot account for the original context from which you lifted this sentence.\n\n\nWell then what the hell is your point?  You don't really know if you have\nan opinion about the hockey issue but you do know that you don't like me.  \nIs that it?\n\n\n--
I can't believe sh*t like this gets any attention in this group during\nthe playoffs.\n\nAli,you're a blabbering moron. At least you could've waited 'till\nthe end of the playoffs to start your dumb letter campaign.
It's over - the Sabres came back to beat the Bruins in OT 6-5 tonight\nto sweep the series. A beautiful goal by Brad May (Lafontaine set him\nup while lying down on the ice) ended it. Fuhr left the game game with\nan injured shoulder and Lafontaine was banged up as well; however, the\nSabres will get a week's rest so injuries should not be a problem.\n\nMontreal edged Quebec 3-2 to square their series, which seems to be\nheaded for Game 7. The Habs dominated the first two periods and were\nunlucky to only have a 2-2 tie after 40 minutes. However, an early\ngoal by Brunet in the 3rd won it.\n\nThe Islanders won their 3rd OT game of the series on a goal by Ray\nFerraro 4-3; the Caps simply collapsed after taking a 3-0 lead in the\n2nd. The Isles' all-time playoff OT record is now 28-7.
I'm familiar with the telethon situation (an individual on CompuServe\nwas also victimized and was equally pissed).  That was a local\ntelevision station contract which could not be broken.  For that item,\nI strongly suggest you call that affiliate and vent your anger on\nthem.  (Supposedly one station had told my friend that they have\nreceived hundreds of angry calls which will translate into far less\nincentive to pre-empt hockey telecasts in future.  The contract was\nwritten when the pathetic WLAF was in that time slot.)
ESPN is pathetic, I have been watching everybody complain about ESPN's coverage\nand I agree with all of you.  Might I suggest that we are getting all worked up\nover nothing.  We ALL knew that ESPN's coverage was going to suck.  I mean have\nyou ever watched during the regular season Sportscenter coverage of hockey? It\nsucks, I mean really sucks!!!  ESPN does not know hockey if it shot them in the\nass.  I was really pissed of about last night, coverage.  I go to school in Ohio\nI *know* the Indians suck, so why show them?  If I were Bill Clement I would\nshoot myself.\n\nAnyway after I calmed down after I realized that they were not going to show\novertime of the Caps Isles game I thought to myself I knew that this was going\nto happen, in fact I remerbed myself praying that at least they would keep even\nthe boring Devils game.\n\nOverall I think ESPN does not care if they show hockey or not and I firmly\nbelive that they have know respect for the fans. ie *because of contract       \nobligations*, screw you ESPN.\n\nPraise be to all hockey fans who put up with this shit!\n\nGO HAWKS!!!
I don't know if anyone has posted a message like this yet, but i'm\ngetting really sick of espn showing the last minute of a hockey\ngame, in which the score was just tied, and then cutting out and saying\n"sorry we can't show you this we have to show baseball tonight" (not\neven a game. a friggin HIGHLIGHT show).\ngee, sure would have been nice to see the isles/caps in overtime.\nI live in Pittsburgh (yes i'm a pens fan) where hockey gets a lot\nof coverage.  i can only imagine how a caps fan residing in Texas\nmust feel.
: That more or less says it.  I flicked the Penguins game on briefly and saw\n: Ulf cross-check Valeri in the face.  I am wondering if Don Cherry is going to\n: go off on this at all in coach's corner.\n\nAnd that was the ONLY infraction of this type in the game. \nCome on! Wake up! Geez He's not the only player who does this\nsort of thing. I think we were kind of lucky. The game was not\nreally all that "chippy" considering the state NJ is in about\nnow.
As if an aluminum stick being taken to Ulf's head is gonna solve the problem\nwith violence in the sport of hockey.  How the hell can you say the guy is\na goon and justify it, with your back-assward mentality?  Saying that hurting\na player will solve anyone's problems is asinine.  New rules and a new \nreferee system need to be instituted.  Right now, too many of the real goons\nget away with too much, because the ref is watching the play (or supposed to be:I've seen Koharski and Van Hellemond, to name a few, with their heads up their  asses on a few calls) rather than keeping an eye on the goofballs behind the \nplay.  Even if the linesmen were able to call all penalties, it would be an\nimprovement.
This comes indirectly from Al Morgani who works in the studio\nfor ESPN hockey.\n\n	The management of ESPN was reluctant to leave the Pitt-NJ game \n(even though the outcome was certain) because of fear of the Wash-Ny game \ngoing to overtime.  When the Caps scored with :02 left to tie the game, Al said\nhe heard many people say f**K .!#$%.  \n	ESPN is under contractual obligation to show baseball and COULD NOT\nbroadcast the OT of the hockey game.  Next year, ESPN2 will be introduced so \nbaseball fans can watch baseball and hockey fans can watch hockey.\n\n	GET OFF ESPN'S BACK AND STOP POSTING ARTICLES ON THIS SUBJECT!!!\nThere have been to many f****n complainers about this game that it's making me\nsick.
Being a a BLUES fan I don't get to see much else from around the league\nwith the exception of Hockey Night on ESPN.  I can't get the BLUES games\nwhere I go to school, thus I don't get to see a whole lot of other teams\nplay except for the Hawks.  But last night I got to catch a glimpse of\nthe Caps/Isles game.  It occurred to me that Turgeon is a stud on skates.\nHis moves are quick and brilliant.  You NY fans should be proud.\nP.S. Who won the game (Caps/Isles)?
Good point - there haven't even been any recent posts about Ulf! \nSecretly, I'm convinced that he's responsible for the Bs being down 3-0\nto Buffalo, somehow.
yet.\n\nI'm not bored either.  Most people I know say that winning the second Cup\nwas better than the first but to me nothing will ever top that first one.\nBut I'm every bit as excited this year and I am experiencing that inner calm\nto which Susan originally referred.  Inner calm is not boredom.\n\nAs far as the arena in general being boring, well Richard's got that right.\nIt's been that way all season.  I attribute it to a lot of new fans who\njust don't have the same spirit and knowledge as long-time fans.  At\nlast Tuesday's game, I overheard a man express surprise that a\ngoaltender can get an\nassist.\n\nAnyone who follows sports with regularity knows that anything can happen\nat any time.  I'm confident in the Pens but I'm also not stupid enough to\nthink for one minute that it's impossible for New Jersey to blow them out\nof this series.  I doubt that will happen but it's possible.  Bored?  Uh-uh.\nSpoiled?  Not in the least.  Forgot what excitement is like?  Living through\nthat amazing streak wasn't exciting?!  I don't take a darned thing for\ngranted.  God, look at Chicago...\n\nAnd I see no problem with quietly savoring all of this anyway.  It isn't gonna\nlast forever and I intend to enjoy it while I can.
Well, we're almost halfway through the first round, and so far things are\ngood in general:\n\n  1. The 2 teams that I hate most: Chicago and "Basten" are down 3 zip.\n     (even though there is a possibility either can still win their\n      series, yet this ego-thrashing and arrogance-smashing by the\n      underdogs (St. Louis and Buffalo) is so rewarding).\n  2. Montreal is at this stage in a team's life where they are not good\n     enough to go all the way, yet too good to be able to get some\n     (really) good draft picks... :-(\n  3. Is it just me, or does anyone out there also think that this year\n     the cup final should be played between 2 teams from the WALES?\n  4. Is it just because they're playing Montreal that I find the diques\n     arrogant ***'s, or are they really?\n  5. Smythe-what???? I'm really getting sick of seeing Douggie and Wendel\n     night in and night out... We should see some Canucks/Jets/Flames\n     action...!\n  6. Don Cherry is an ******* alright, but hey... so are our politicians...\n  \nObLeafsJoke:  Q. what do you get when you cross a maple leaf and a \n                groundhog?\n              A.

Don't know who scored, but the Isles (28-7 franchise record in\nplayoff OT games) took game four by a score of 4-3 for their\nthird consecutive OT win over the Capitals tonight at Uniondale.\nIf you know, please post who scored for a Isles fan living in\nAtlanta:Hockey Hell.\n\nLord Stan's a Uniondale Man!  GO ISLES!
Regardless, they'd have to sparkle from the pressbox.  Errey's been\nout a couple games with a hip injury.

(Ali's letter deleted for brevity)\n\n\nRoger,\nYour responses might just exclude you from sharing your opinions,\nthen.  You see, the same rights Ali has to mail her letter to the NHL\nare the same ones that let you post replies that mow her down like\nwheat at harvest-time.  She never said she represented the entire\ninternet or the entire group rec.sport.hockey.  She has every right to\nstate her opinion along with those of the fifty or sixty or\nhundred-odd folk who've agreed to allow her to list their names on the\nbottom of it.  You may not agree with it.  Fine.  I really don't care\nenough about the name change to care.  Your name isn't attached to it,\nso why moan and complain?  If you felt her words were leading, well,\nyou're free to feel that way and take exception, but manners never\nhurt.  I personally disagree and feel her generalizations were fine\n(I have the right to think and say that, too).  Ali's under no\ncompunction to change a single word.  Now, while you're free to\ndisagree with every word she wrote, to tear apart her character is\nuncalled for.  I'm posting this as a form of public reprimand.  If you\ntear down Ali's integrity and character publicly, you'll get chastised\npublicly in return.  Would it have been so hard to say, "Ali, please\nbe a bit more specific in your description, the way I've read it\nindicates you're stating my view also, and that's simply not true.\nI'd really like to see a disclaimer noting that you don't mean the\nentire internet or the entire r.s.h. group attached to it, despite\nyour intent to list names at the bottom.  Thanks.  Cordially as\nalways," &c.  Calling her a moron and an asshole just reduces the\nweight of your words and the opinions of their author in the eyes of\nmyself, and possibly others.  \n\nOh, and Ali, nice to see someone standing up for something, even if\nit's not something I personally advocate.  :-)
Well, if SHIT means going to the Stanley Cup finals a couple years\nago, I'd rather be shit than a leaf fan.
Nothing wrong with what Felix did.  The only problem was that he didn't Dino \nhard enough.  Next time Felix aim for the ankles!!!!!!!!!!
cdash@moet.cs.colorado.edu (Charles Shub) writes...\n\nWhat really irritated me was that they kept switching back and forth\nbetween baseball and hockey after they stated that they couldn't show\nthe overtime period. I turned back to ESPN around 11 and it was hockey.\nGreat, I pulled up a chair and watched, then the first overtime period \nended and they went back to baseball before coming back to hockey\nsomething like 30 minutes later. Are they trying to alienate both\nhockey and baseball viewers at the same time. As for Martinsville,\nI wonder why they even bothered to sign up for it when they it was\nno secret that it coincided with the draft. Why not let TNN broadcast\nit ?\n\n\nGeorge
Marcus Thuresson had 6 goals, 10 assists, 16 points and 22 PIM in 31 games\n this season for Leksand in the Swedish elite league. This was only 10th\n in point scoring for Leksand.\n\n Marcus (born May 31 1971, Ht 185 cm, Wt 85 kg) is relatively young so he\n might still start producing, but I think the Sharks may have done a bad\n trade here.\n\n Staffan
Can the Sabres win two more games against the Bruins?\n\nI think game three in Buffalo will be the most important of the\nseries.  If the Sabres lose that game, the party will be over.  It will \nbe hello next year.\n\nThe key for the remaining games in the series will be whether Fuhr can\nkeep up his brillliant goaltending and if Mogilny can continue skate by \nthe Bruins.  He has shown demonstrated excellent speed.\n\nFinally, the Sabres appear to have shown up for the post season.
As the Rangers found out in last year's playoffs, it's too late to\ntry line-juggling at this point.\n\ngld
I agree that Keenan is an excellent choice.  Did you see Mike\nLupica's column in Sunday's news?  My sentiments exactly.  I\nthink he just may be the one to instill some hunger and fire\ninto their hearts next season.  Either that or he's going to \nbe kicking alot of butt!\n\n\nI'm here, but am new to this group and have been keeping fairly\nquiet (you know, doing the "lurking" thing).  I don't have a\nsense how many Rangers fans there are on the list either.  I \nam a die-hard Ranger fan (I guess I have to be - I sat in the\nGarden throughout the Penguins' - led by Mario's 5 goals - decimation \nof them on 4/9), but am sick at the abundance of talent that has\nbeen totally untapped, and the lack of heart displayed this\nseason.\n\n\nHurlbut was injured for quite a while.  I'm not sure, but I\nthink he may have recovered in time for the playoff run, and\nif so, like you, question why he wasn't used.\n\n\nI believe Kocur was used, in many instances, for his intimidation \nfactor.  Granted, he seemed to get an awful lot of ice time for \nthat reason alone, but you have to realize that when a team is\nnot doing any REAL physical intimidation (I'd like to have a nickel \nfor every time J.D. said 'They've got to take the body more'), \nyou've got to at least have some illusions ;-(\n\n\nI agree and I don't know.\n\n\nSorry, I don't agree with you here.  I think Joey C. did a good\njob filling in when he was asked to.  I can't imagine that it's\neasy going from near 0 ice time to being a full timer.  I don't\nseem to remember him turning the puck over at the blue line too\nmuch, or failing to clear the zone.  He worked hard, and at\nleast didn't make any rookie mistakes.  As he said himself in an\ninterview, he can only give what he has.  and he did.  \n\n\nAbsolutely.  I think attendance at the Garden was better on the\nlast day of the season, than any average night for the\nIslanders.\n\n\nThe man is awesome.  In a way, I'm enjoying the playoffs more,\nnow that the Rangers aren't in them.  I can really appreciate\nall the glory Mario is getting without 'hating' him because he's\non the opposing team.  He deserves it all, as far as I'm\nconcerned.\n\n		- Mary
Wow, this guy seems to be out to prove something to his old team, Boston.\nWhich Sweeney you ask...well, of course Bob Sweeney, the one that Boston\nlet Buffalo get a hold of (they still have 2 Sweeneys which makes things\nslightly confusing).  Game winner in OT in game 1, and another\nBIG goal (seconds after Fuhr made 3 point blank saves -> this is why\nGrant has 5 rings!!!) to put Buffalo ahead in the 3rd.  Yes, Neely countered\na minute later, but hadn't this course of Buffalo going ahead after being\ntied and shutting down another few great scoring opportunities, I\nthink Boston would have notched their first win of the series.\n\nWell, the Sabres haven't made it to the end of this series yet, but\nI certainly feel they've got Boston right were they want them...actually,\nthey've got them in a position that neither Buffalo nor Boston felt\nthat would come about.  One more astronomical game by Fuhr, a few more\nheroics by the rest of the team (this is a team sport afterall) and I\nthink Borque, Neely, Jouneau (sp?), and Company are gonna be swinging\na new stick (Weather is perfect for golf season) real soon.  I'm not\ngonna waiger anything on this, because I've seen some really strange\nthings happen in both pro and college hockey.\n\nTalking about golf...was that a hockey swing, golf swing or baseball\nswing that Hawerchuck used in the last shot of the game that Khmylev\ndeflected in for the BIG ONE?  The whole OT (all 1 minute of it!) was a\ntesiment to Buffalo's ability to really be persistent and grind it out\nin the end (something they weren't necessarily in the regular season).  The\nSabres pushed hard and forced Borque to blatently take down Bodger in\nthe opening seconds.  I don't normally like penalties being called in\nsuch ultra-critical points, but this was BLATENT.  Finally, the Sabres\nwon a faceoff (they weren't that hot in this dept the rest of the game)\nwhen LaFontaine scooped at the puck 3 times.  When Hawerchuck took his\nshot (quite a boomer, but Blue stopped this one) he took a few steps\nover to get his own rebound and slapped at it again, without setting\nit up.  I didn't realize it went in until the announcer started screaming,\n"They score, THEY SCORE!!!".  The best was seeing LaFontaine jumping\nup and down, skating a little bit, jumping some more, and then skating\nover to Brad May who he jumped on.
Borchevsky is 5'9" and Gilmour is 5'11"...I think Gilmour slightly\noutweighs Borchevsky.  Andreychuk is also about 5'11", I think.
Yeah, they finally came to agreement on a contract. As soon as the ink was\ndry, he suddenly decided Kansas City was a neat place to be. (ergo, the\n"want to play for the national team" was a bargaining chip).
Generally I agree with you. However, (1) last night ESPN cut away to Baseball\nTonite, which looks like SportsCenter tailored to baseball, and they cut\naway at 7:40 pacific. That's quite a contract they have there. (2) if\nESPN couldn't deliver, they should have had a transistion plan to\nlet SportsChannel pick up the slack.\n\nNonetheless, it is ultimately the fault of the US-American public that regular\nseason baseball has precedence over playoff hockey in the U.S.\nSupport your team; support your game.\n\nSomebody in r.s.h. had an excellent idea that we should write Chrysler\nto thank them for supporting hockey with their ads and that we would\nconsider their products. Here's an equally excellent idea, watch\nbaseball for 10 minutes (I know I'm asking a lot, but that's what spew\nbags are for), write down who is advertising, and write them letters\ncomplaining that they are supporting baseball to your displeasure and\nthat you won't consider buying their products because of it.
: >\n: >	On Tuesday, when it was raining in Chicago, ESPN provided \n: >bonus hockey coverage.  Now it seems as though some fans are ticked off\n: >that the NY-Wash OT was replaced with the Angels-?? game.  People must\n: >realize that there are more baseball fans instead of hockey fans in the U.S  \n: >The baseball game was scheduled to air and advertisers money was paid so\n: >they can't skip the baseball game.  Why don't you people CHILL OUT\n: >and enjoy whatever coverage you can get.\n\nWell, partly because I, as an ardent fan of both sports, would rather\nsee Game 3 of the NHL playoffs than Game 3 of 162 of the MLB\nseason (even if the bb game involves the Red Sox).	\n\nESPN may have had contractual obligations. I understand that part.\nBut it's a bit inaccurate to call us "selfish" just because we want\nto watch the watch the game we love. Am I, as a baseball fan, "selfish"\nwhen I get pissed a CBS for showing approximately one game per month?\nI don't think so.\n\nWhile, ESPN may have contractual obligations, we, as their consumers,\nhave a right to voice our displeasure with how they are serving us.\nThere's certainly nothing wrong with that.
John Girash writes...\n\nYou can get WJR a LONG way away.  The problem is that, because of those\nwell known and beloved "contractual obligations", WJR will be doing\nTiger baseball instead of the Wings playoff games for probably half\nthe games the Wings could play.  For this series, I know tonight's\ngame and I believe games 5 and 6 (if necessay) will be bumped.\n\nRon
I dunno about hat. I have friends up there on GEnie who are now saying that\nOttawa's gone soft on Daigle and is thinking hard about Pronger. Daigle has\nshown an Attitude the latter part of this season many folks havne't liked,\nand after coming back from his (second) multi-game suspension for being\nstupid, he's really tanked in his performance. His stock is dropping like a\nrock. \n\nAlso remember that a lot of teh "draft 1st" stuff comes from the assumption\nhe'll be traded to Quebec for lots of prospects. It's not clear that \nQuebec would really be willing to pay a lot for him given his current\nstatus. He's still first round, but I don't consider him a first pick lock\nby any means at this point.\n\nIt's also possible that the Senators are posturing to try to bring down his\nsigning price, since Daigle has been taking some Lindros lessons during thos\nsuspensions.\n\n\n\nNo. Kariya won't go in the first three, for a very simple reason: he's not\nleaving college, and I don't believe ANY of the expansion teams are going to\nuse a first for someone who won't be around for another year or two, not\nwhen there is equally good (or almost as good) stuff available that can make\nan immediate impact. San jose seems to be leaning heavily towards\nNiedermayer for that reason. Kariya could go 6th or 7th, unless a team can\nconvince him to leave school early (which I doubt).\n\n\nMy cut on things as they stand today:\n\n	(it depends on if the Sharks can get a deal for him. I don't\n	believe they draft him to keep him).
Quebec dominated Habs for first 2 periods and only Roy kept\nthis one from being rout, although he did blow 2nd goal.\nCanadians showed up in third but Nords were playing dump &\npull back most of the time. Hextall made some good saves but\nreally this one was lost in first period when nords scored 3\n& could have had 5, plus another 4 in 2nd. Canadians are dead\nmeat, they may take one or 2 but this one is over. Tee it up\nJacques, next time you might rest players & forget about 1st\nplace, welcome to the Adams division.
You must be kidding, right? In losing Stevens the Blues got Shanahan and\nkept\nJoseph. Then they traded Oates for Janney. As a Hawks fan you have got to\nrespect those "hapless" names. 8^) Lets see, who scored the game winning\novertime goal in the 4th game???
I wonder how many more years it will take Gretz to beat this one? ;-)

Listen guys you can talk about this the whole playoffs.  I'm here in a\nsmall town in southern Illinois at school.  I'm from Canada and I know\nthat cbc and tsn have games on every night,  all you have to do is go to\na bar with a satellite.  I have watched both games between Mon Que and\ntoronto and detroit,  not to mention Van vs Winn and with cbc.  They\nshow all goals from every game that evening so I haven't missed a goal\nall playoffs.  Well have to go boy leafs are on Ciao.
HELP!  I'm stuck here at a computer in New Jersey and have no access to\na radio or TV.  Could someone kindly post the score of the Canucks-Jets\ngame?  Thanks in advance.

Nice sig. Like the change. \n	BTW: Could you post the names of the people who are going to be on the\nletter? I (and I'm sure others) would like to know if we are included. If I'm\nnot I want to be! Roger is a fool!
Wood played most of his junior career in Seattle.  He was one\nof the leading scorers on a mediocre team when he was traded away in\n1992.  He rarely lost a fight and was one of the toughest players in\nthe WHL.\n\nHowever, I was extremely surprised when he was drafted, especially in\nthe third round.  He certainly didn't look like NHL material...
Gaetz won't be back. There's been rumors he was officially released right at\nthe end of the season when his contract expired, but I haven't seen\nconfirmation. It was clear from my talks with the Sharks doctors that he\nwasn't going to make it for a while, and the Sharks would have to sign him\nto a contract, which given his problems competing at the IHL level this\nspring, doesn't make sense.
Where is Roger anyway?  Haven't heard from him in awhile.  He must\nbe out on the golf course waiting for the Leafs to join him any day\nnow. : )
Yes, these last couple of months the Kinngs have failed to show up in about\none game in five. Presumably last night was that one game in five.
Looks like Bob Errey's ring really sparkles in that locker room, and everyone\nelse wants one, too! :-)  Correct me if I'm wrong though, (just through\nthe net, not through e-mail, I don't need 100 rl's in my e-mail!) but wasn't\nBoston down 2-0 vs. Buffalo last year?Boston lost 1 and 2 at home and won\n3 and 4 in Buffalo.  Whoever wins game 3 will advance.  Simple as that!!! :-)
The USA Today says "late this year".  The question is, will hockey be moved to\nESPN2 permenantly, or will it be where they have a game of the week on\nESPN, and have a bunch of other games on ESPN2?\n\n\n-- \nMike Cornell     | "There are a great many people in the country today who,\nmac18@po.cwru.edu|  through no fault of their own, are sane." -Monty Python
Here's one from the mill.  The Oilers MIGHT move to Hamilton\nwhere Porklington can get a free deal.\n\nGiven what Labour relations and Puck has been like, it WOULD be a sigh of relief.\n\nThis WAY w4e can can BOTH elements!!
Grant Fuhr has done this to a lot better coaches than Brian Sutter...
Well I was watching Hockey Hotline last night and Stan said that the\nstation (KBL) had been recieving calls all day concerning this subject. \nAnd the verdict was that almost exclusively NOBODY wanted that load\nmouth, know it all blow hard, former Bruin whiner, Ulf Hating, scum\nsucking, Pr*ck of missery in Pittsburgh on a permanent basis.  That's\nnot exactly what Stan said;  I did do a bit of interpriting.
Hi guys....\n\nWhat happened?\n	1.  Potvin didn't let six goals by.\n	2.  Wendel and Andreychuk woke up.\n	3.  Home ice and LOTS of yelling in the Gardens gave the Leafs\n		the emotional edge.\n	4.  Refs calls (especially last night) tended to favour Leafs.\n\n	A couple of comments:\n\n	1.  On Gilmour:  Just because the guy isn't one of the three\n	stars doesn't mean he was not leading the team.  Someone posted\n	the playoff point total and he's in something like fifth or sixth\n	place....plus, he walked away with the Molson cup (given for\n	accumulating points from the three star selection) during the\n	regular season.\n\n	2.  On the officiating:  I've heard gripes from both ends on this\n	one.  Emotions are very high in this series;  the rivalry is\n	one of the stronger ones I know of.  I do have to agree that the\n	officiating last night was pro-Leaf in general (except for whoever\n	missed that slash on Gilmour's hand).\n\n	3.  In general:  I STILL think Detroit has one of the better\n	chances vs. Pittsburgh (though I think the Leafs would do better\n	against the Blues....but not as well if they made it out of the\n	division). Problem is, I like both these teams, though I'm\n	supporting the Leafs on the underdog principle.  D\n\n	By the way...Gilmour tiring out is a lot like Bob Probert not\n		playing aggressive hockey....\n	By the way....I'm not any sort of expert, nor do I claim to be.\n		I just like watching a good matchup.

Michael J. Fox was on Letterman about a year ago (or two) during the \nplayoffs as a celebrity hockey player for the Bruins.  While he's not\nexactly a NHLer he did mention that the Bruins wanted to break Ulfie's\nlegs (or something like that) in response to the Neely incident.  It\nwas quite amusing, as one of the few Letterman viewers who actually knew\nwhat he was talking about.  Anybody know who the Pens celebrity hockey\nplayer is?  Michael Douglas (aka Michael Keaton)?
If I were Pat Burns I'd throw in the towel. The wings dominated every\naspect of the game.  Trying to mix up the lines is a dead end.  Murray\nhas too many combinations to counter with. My prediction is wings in 5.

It's called 'contractual obligations' with Major League Baseball.\nI would've liked to see the OT of the Isles-Caps game, but I understand\nwhere ESPN is coming from. ESPN is committed to a single telecast a night\nand everything after that is a bonus.
ESPN has been trying various things to get away from the\nfollow-the-puck concept of televising hockey games.  One of the main\nproblems with hockey is that it is very difficult to show everything\nthat is going on -- more happens away from the puck than in any other\nsport except maybe football and they can do iso's on football players\nto be shown between plays.\n\nThe problem of course is that sometimes you get something worthwhile,\nother times you get burned.
Gee, they lost to St. Louis twice this year. Maybe you should have your\neyes checked. 8^)\n\n\nGo Blues....the Rodney Dangerfield team....They get no respect....except\nin Chicago mabee...
I believe that Phil Esposito was the first to wear #77 when he played\nwith the Rangers in the '70s.  This was the season that they put the\nRangers crest and "modern-style" numbers on the jerseys instead of the\n"NEW YORK" or "RANGERS" block letters and two-colour numbers.  He took #77\nbecause the Rangers already had a #7.\n\n(Hockey Night in Canada made a big thing out of it, saying it was the\nbiggest uniform style change in a long time.  This was before Pittsburgh\nand Vancouver changed their colours.)\n\n     dwarf
How did the Leafs turn it around??? \n\n\nI couldn't get the Leaf games on the weekend in CA.\n\nDid the Leaf defense wise up overnight?\nDid the Leafs get in the slot or \nwas it just "fluke" goals in a goalie duel? \nDid the Wings turn off the jets or muscle?  \nWhat gives here?\n\nI caught game 1 on satellite.  I figured my Leafs were washed.\nThis is a _major_ turnaround.   Very few predicted this. \nHow, how, how did it happen?   \n\nWing and Leaf perspectives welcomed!

Well, in my opinion the Canucks played a really strong game. I was\nespecially pleased by a very strong game from Linden - I think he\ncould be a key to success for them this year.  Defensively, they\nreally had a strong game.  Hardly heard Selanne's name all night.\nCraven also played one of his best games since coming over.  With a\nfew exceptions, they really didn't let the high-flying Jets do much\nhigh-flying.  I thought the Jets defence looked overmatched by the\nCanucks forwards - they will have to improve on that if they want to\nmake this a series.\n\n    In short, it was a great start!
and guess which game ESPN is showing in my area on Thursday - yep,\nPens-Devils.  There are so many other interesting series, who cares\nabout Mario???
Have you ever noticed that after a hockey player has been interviewed\nin between periods on a tv game. That they usually get a goal or\nan assist. can you explain this or is it that they usually talk \nto stars more than regular players which explains the hight \npercentage of results after.\n\nJust wondering how everybody else thinks about this or if they dont \ncare about this trivial nonsense.\nttyl  Tom

Well, here in Detroit we get to see and hear Don Cherry quite regularly.\nThe Detroit area picks up Hockey Night in Canada from CBC (ch 9) in\nWindsor where we see Don Cherry's Coaches Corner between periods. We\nalso get to see Don Cherry's Grapevine just before the game. The\nGrapevine is a hockey talk show where Don talks to a player or coach\nabout what else: Hockey.  It's actually a pretty good show and Don\nisn't as annoying as he is on Coaches Corner.  I think this is were\nDon got his nickname 'Grapes' but I'm not sure.  Don use to coach the\nBoston Bruins.  I don't know exactly when that was.  Could someone fill\nme in on this info?\n  A local radio station here in Detroit (WLLZ) talks to Don every Tuesday\nmorning.  Personally, I've had my fill of Donny!  He really pisses me off\nsometimes.  During the Detroit-Toronto game Monday night on CBC, Don gave\nhigh praise to Doug Gilmour, saying he was a two-way player and not\njust a designated goal scorer and that he is probably the best player\nin the game because of that.  That's fine and I agree that Gilmour\nis a good two-way player BUT he said the EXACT same thing about Yzerman\nabout a month ago on a local radio talk show.  What gives?\n  It seems like he just has a set speech that he changes when he goes from\ncity to city.\n  Don Cherry:  'I think <insert star player name for city that he is in>\n              is the best two-way player in the league today.'\n \n  There have been other times (can't remember exactly what he said) that he\nbasically changed his opinions to match the audience he was talking to.\n  Someone here on the net said something about how Don criticized Mario\nLemieux but when the time comes for Don to broadcast the Cup playoffs\nfrom the Civic Center (Yes, I think the Pens will make it out of the\nWales Conference) Don will apologize left and right for his remarks about\nLemieux.  In my opinion, he is an ass.  And I won't change my opinion\nif I'm in a different city.\n  Sorry, if this didn't answer your question better but I just had to get\nthis off my chest.
2) Hitting....Hawks tried to outmuscle Blues but could not do it.\nInstead, Blues matched Hawks hit for hit and crunched the shit out of\nthem in game #4.....Scud line, Shanahan, Butcher, and Zombo particularly\ntook turns bashing favorite targets like Chelios.\n\n3) Skating.....when the Hawks tried to outskate Blues, they could not do\nthat either.  Nelson Emerson finally showed up and skated circles around\nflat footed Chicago defense.....Hedican, Felsner, Ron Wilson and others\nalso proved that with old cement skaters like Goulet and Keith Brown,\nBlues could lap Chicago in a 400 M relay race.\n\n\n     I agree with #2 but you are wrong about #3.  In fact, the only\n     point where the Hawks in any way matched the Blues was when\n     they quit trying to outmuscle and instead tried to outskate\n     the Blues.  They scored and took the lead.  Too bad it was\n     Game 4 and they then took some stupid penalties.  When the\n     Hawks skated, they outskated the Blues and took control.
So if Potvin can pound on Dino, what happens when Dino pounds \non him?  If Dino gets his legs slashed, can he slash Potvin\nin return?  This year at a UM-LSSU hockey game, a UM player\nwas called for a slash when he hit the goalie's glove with\nhis stick.  Is that slashing, while hitting someone's ankles\nisn't?  How do the refs know what to call?  Do the goalies\nget more liberties than other players?
I knew, despite the lack of a full game telecast last week, it was still\ntoo much hockey for Atlanta. Atlanta's ABC has declined to pick up any\nplayoff games till May9. And even when they show the games on MAy9 and May16,\nthey will continue to skip the first half hour of the telecast. I know this\nis still a better situation compared to rest of Georgia, Alabama, etc., but\nit is still pretty annoying. At least in PIttsburgh, we had a network preemptionchannel which showed all netwoork shows prempted by the local affiliate.\n\n\nI asked them what their problem was. I told them that a local 1.9 rating was\nnot that bad considering it was the first NHL game shown after a long time\nwithout much promotion. Besides, their syndicated programming in the afternoon\nis usually low rated. So what did they have to lose by showing NHL playoffs.\nShe told me that they had contractual obligations. I asked her if golf\nwas shown oin ABC, would contractual obligations come in the way. And how come\ncontractual obligations didn't come in the way of last week's telecast? She\nthen couldn't give me a coherent answer.\n\n\nAlso, I added that Atlanta had one of the highest neutral site game\nattendances and that the demographics were good. I think ABC and other networks\nshould begin to tie their high rated programs like Roseanne in with\n thier sports programming.\nI hope that everyone in Atlanta who reads this bboard calls WSB 2 and complain\nbitterlyt about this. Tell them you will stop watching their news telecasts\nsince they seem to be very unprofessional in handling this situation.
It was not just those penalties. Most of all it was the penalty the referee didn't\ncall on the Czechs right before their first goal.\n\n\nDon't you think it's quite silly to call it a Nazi attitude, when some people \nthrow coins on the ice? Hey, I don't approve the behavior of these guys,\nespecially not in a WC game, but I can't see any reason for using the word 'Nazi'\nin this connection. \n  \n\nSoccer hooligans are not just a German problem (remember the world cup in Italy).\nAgain: there's a big difference between throwing coins and smashing shop-windows\nor fighting with other so-called 'fans', who come to a WC just to see if the\nDutch or the English or the Germans are the best bruisers.\nWhich other sports are you talking about? I don't think soccer is 'every possible\nsport'.\n\n\nHow many Germans do you know? Do you think 200 out of 10000 is 'most of them'? \nIf you hear about some white policemen beating a black man in the US, what do you\nthink about the Americans? 'Most of them' like beating blacks?
My respect for the power of the hockey gods is preventing me from\ncommenting on the above, and for commenting on whether the guy\nDamphousse was traded for is on vacation or not. Perhaps Roger\n(demonstrably in contempt of the hockey gods and paying for it) dares a\ncomment or two?
According to "Quotations from Chairman Cherry", Don was playing in\nSpringfield. He and another player had to pay some fines; the other\nplayer had his paid off, but not Don didn't want to.\n\nDon called the other player a "teacher's Pet", and the other player\nreplied "Ah, that's just sour grapes".
This is not a trend. The Caps were done. Goneso in five games, and it saves\nus Caps fans a lot of pain.\n\nI mean, it would be more painful if the Caps were up 3-1, watching them \ntumbled when they need ONE MORE WIN to clinch the series. How many times\nhave they done that in their history?\n\n1985 up 2-0 in a five game series against the Isles, lost 3 straight\n1987 up 3-1 against the Isles, lost 3 straight\n1992 up 3-1 against the Pens, lost 3 straight\n\nIn other words, when they were about to clinch with 3 games to go, they \nwere a pitiful 2-9, the lone wins being \n\n1) a sweep of Philly in 1984\n2) the 1990 win against the Rangers in the Patrick finals, the ONLY TIME \nthey managed to get out of the division.\n\nActually, Saturday's blown lead wasn't anything new. We all know the Caps\nare famous lead blowers in crucial playoff games. Examples:\n\n1) game 4 against the Isles, 1985, led 4-2 after two, lead series 2-1,\ngave up 4 goals in the 3rd period, including the game winning goal in the\nlast minute. After that goal, Bobby Carpenter botched a penalty shot.\nSeries tied 2-2, lost game 5 a few days later.\n\n2) game 4 against the Rangers, 1986, led series 2-1, led by 2 in the 3rd \nperiod, blew it. Lost game in OT and three consecutive games.\n\n3) game 6 against Pittsurgh, 1992, led series 3-2, led by 2 in 2nd period.\nBlew it and the series.\n\n4) game 3 against Isles, 1993, series tied 1-1, led by 2 after 2. Blew it.\n\n5) game 4 against Isles, 1993, trailed series 2-1, led by 3 in 2nd period.\nBlew it again.\n\nWhen they were leading by 3 in game 4, I said to myself: "if they blew this\nlead, the series is OVER". They have lost all the momemtum. The Islanders\nbelieve they can come back no matter what the score is.\n\nI am still waiting for a Cap goalie who can carry the team, who can \ncompletely shut down the opposition when they are hanging on their dear \nlives in a crucial game.\n\nWell, some teams such have it and some teams just don't. When the Caps\nwere frustrated year in year out by the Islanders, I was thinking "wait\nuntil Potvin/Bossy/Trottier/Smith retire". Well, they retired (even though\nTrottier was still able to haunt the Caps on a Pens uniform), yet another\ngeneration of Islanders were still doing the same thing. Well, I guess \nit has nothing to do with the players.
Tonight will see the Toronto Maple Leafs, as some have guessed, come out \nhitting!  The "Buds" will grind Detroit into the ground and walk away with \nhome ice advantage for the remainder of the series... which given a shift to \nToronto, will not last long.  (Keep in mind this is only a predicition).  \nWendall will have to get into the game however otherwise Probert will \ndominate on the physical front.
I heard a story on the local sports news broadcast in Edmonton.\nOiler owner Peter Pocklington will be holding a press conference\nnext week. While the exact details are not known, it is believed\nto concern the Oiler's future.\n\nRumour has it that Pocklington signed a tentative lease arrangement\nwith Copps Collesium in Hamilton. During the press conference,\nPocklington may announce the deal. It is quite possible that\nthe deal may simply be a way to force Edmonton Northlands to\nrenegotiate the Oiler lease on the stadium.\n\nNorthlands has offered to buy the Oilers for $65 million earlier,\nbut the offer was rejected immediately by Pocklington.
I believe the NHL Draft is on or the June 18th weekend.
Hello,\n\nCould someone tell me if and where i could find faceoff stats for the\n91/92 season and later on the 92/93 (i think its to early to get it now).\n\nThanks a lot
The only way to change ESPN's thinking, if it is even possible, is to complain\nto them directly.  Anyone know there telephone # in Bristol, Ct?  \n\nI do find it hard to believe that ESPN doesn't think viewers will simply\nchange the channel from a boring game....I know I did.  And then, when\nthey didn't show the NYI-Wash overtime(s), I was livid!  If I wanted\nto watch baseball, I could have turned on the Phillies-Padres extra\ninning game....instead, I went to bed angry......I boycotted ESPN's\nmorning Sportscenter today, I was still so incensed.\n\nMy wife says I shouldn't go to bed angry, but last nite.........GRRRRRRR!
Team Canada defeated Russia 3-1 to finish the priliminary \nround unbeaten at 5-0. Scoring for the Canadians were Kevin Dineen of \nthe Flyers, Eric Lindros also of the Flyers and Paul Cariya of the \nMaine Black Bears. Cariya has put on quite a show at the Worlds. He is \nsure to be drafted in the top 3 this summer at the NHL entry draft.\n\n	Canada defeated Italy 11-2 and Austria 11-0 before meeting the \nRussians on Sunday. The Canadians now face Finland in the Quarter -\nfinals on Tuesday.

OK, here is my try:\n\n				        Lukko, Finland\n					(look at the colors of his mask)\n					              \n				        ex-JyPHT, Finland, now in Germany\n					Excellent defenseman\n\n					HIFK, Finland\n\n				        Tappara, Finland\n\n					HPK, Finland\n\n					Jokerit, Finland\n	\n				        HPK, Finland\n\n				        JyPHT, Finland, no new contract\n					JyPHT owns his player rights\n\nAll of these Czechs (Kadlec, Dolezal not anymore) are very good hockey\nplayers. It is a big surprise that Hlinka selected Dolezal. \n"Dole" had a bad season in JyPHT and that's why they didn't make\na new contract. The other Czech we had, Jiri Jonak, got fired also.
As long as a player is under contract to an organization, he is obligated to\nplay only where that organization tells him to play or gives him permission\nto play. The Rangers are certainly within their rights to force Zubov and\nAndersson to report to Binghampton. \n\nIt certainly does reflect a lack of class on the part of the Ranger \norganization, however. Is having Binghampton win the Calder Cup really more\nimportant to them than keeping their players happy?

Not nearly as angry as I was to have set the VCR yesterday only to get\nhome to find the Bruins VS Buffalo - that's what I get for reading the\nTV section and not the sports section for what game will be aired.
Did you watch the games????
I applauded the Sabres for making the deal to get Fuhr, specifically because I\nthought it would help them win at least one playoff series.  However, I don't\nthink the Leafs can be faulted either...there is nothing to say that Felix\nwon't be winning playoff series by himself in years to come.  \n\nAnyway, does anybody else find it ironic that Fuhr is up against Moog? (or at\nleast he was until a guy named Alex showed up....:-) )
The Hart Trophy was orginally awarded in a time where people did not think\nin terms of who was the "best" player, rather in terms of who was the most\nvaluable to the team.  And "valuable to his team" was not, and should not\nbe, considered synonymous with "best".  We are talking about a time when\nhonour and attitude, not measurable skills, were the most important assets\na player brought to his team, his league and his sport.  This was before\nthe onslaught of professionalism which has clearly denigrated what was \nformerly the foremost peacetime pursuit of glory.\n\nThe Hart Trophy is not a prize.  It is an honour.\n\n\n--

The probability is that the Oilers are not going anywhere.\n\nPocklington has chosen this moment to make his "last" stand is\nbecause he is at the moment of maximum advantage...the provincial\ngovernment is months away from a provincial election...it is\nthe moment when he has maximum power to convince Northlands\nto give him a better arena deal or a better purchase price...\nand it is before the NHL's new collective agreement with\nthe players which might involve some enhanced revenue-sharing.\n\nPocklington is many things...stupid is not one of them.\n\nHe can dictate terms...because other cities will pay his\nprice if Edmonton doesn't.\n\nEdmonton has already fucked up its international airport, and\nsurrendered supremacy to Calgary, and over the next few years\nEdmonton is going to take a hard hit from government cutbacks.\nIt will screw itself beyond recogniton if it manages to find\na way to lose its hockey team too...because Northlands wants\nto continue to use the Oilers to subsidize horse racing.\n\nHowever, in this case, about the long-term financial\nviability of the Oilers, the fact is that Pocklington is basically \nright, regardless of who owns the team, and it is right to provoke\nthe crisis now, before the team accumulates millions of dollars\nin losses, or becomes habitually uncompetitive because of lack\nof money.\n\nSather has done his job...the Oilers are poised to be competitive\nagain very soon (Al Strachan, one of the most knowledgeble hockey\nwriters in Canada in a post-mortem of the Oilers season in\nthe Globe and Mail recently agrees with me.)

I too am of the same  sentiment Bart, but realistically, this town DOESN'T WANT TO pay for \nquality player and hence we are loosing these people left, right and center.\nLabour is also responsible for their boycott Pocklington movement.\nI would like the Oilers to stay, but realistically, given this situation, it's \nbye-bye Oilers.
[stuff deleted]\n\n\n\nThe last year before Bryan Murray took over, the Wings did not make the\nplayoffs.  While they had been considered a possible contender when Jacques\nDemers first arrived, in his last two years they were, respectively,\nembarrassed in the first round by Chicago, and then failed to make the \nplayoffs (at a time, a might add, when there were only five teams in the\nNorris).\n\nIt's true that Vancouver did not make the playoffs for many a year before \nQuinn came, but in those years the Smythe Division was a lot--I mean *a lot*--\ntougher division than the Norris, also known as the "Snorris", division.\nVancouver had to play Edmonton and Calgary, both very legitimate Stanley\nCup contenders, eight times a year, while Detroit got to play such \npowerhouses as Toronto and Minnesota.  Now, Edmonton is hardly even a force\nin the league, and the Smythe even has the mighty San Jose sharks, while\nover this same period of time in which Vancouver was improving, so was \neverybody in the Norris (except St. Louis).  Detroit had to improve just\nto keep up with the competition in their division.  They had to improve *a\nlot* to get better than their competition in the Norris.\n\nBryan Murray inherited a team with very little talent.  For really good\nplayers, they had Yzerman, Burr, and Probert, and that was about it.  (And\nno doubt some will dispute whether Burr and Probert were that good). The\nrest were either very green rookies or washed up veterans.  The only reason\nthey got as far as they did in the years before Murray came was due to the\ncoaching of Demers, who, at least at first, got every last ounce of effort\npossible out of his team.  Then, even his coaching began to degrade.\n\n\nThere are a number of reasons why Detroit wasn't in as bad a shape standings\nwise when Murray took over as Vanc. was when Quinn took over, some of which\nI outlined above, but Murray did not have any better personnel to work with\nat the outset than did Quinn, with the exception of Yzerman.  And one player\ncannot alone make a team into a Stanley Cup contender, as I'm sure everyone\nreading this will agree.  \n\nWe'll be able to see better which team is really the most improved when they\nface each other in the conference final (assuming they don't get knocked out,\nlike last year).
Is it just me or is the camera work on some of these games really sad??  I\ncan't remember how many times during the Penguins-Devils game they showed some\nguy (without the puck) being checked in the corner while the puck was being\nfired on goal.  In fact, I think they even missed one goal completely because\nthey were showing two guys holding each other in the corner.\n\nNow the last time I watched a football game, they didn't show the lineman going\nat it while the running back turned the corner for a touchdown . . . . \n\nIs it just me??
Steve Tuttle was traded from the Blues to TB in the before the start of this\nseason along with Pat Jablonski, for future considerations. He played for\nMilwaukee of the IHL, then got traded from TB to QUE along with Michel Mongeau.\nHe's currently playing with Halifax of the AHL.
I am sure some bashers of Pens fans are pretty confused about the lack\nof any kind of posts about the recent Pens massacre of the Devils. Actually,\nI am  bit puzzled too and a bit relieved. However, I am going to put an end\nto non-PIttsburghers' relief with a bit of praise for the Pens. Man, they\nare killing those Devils worse than I thought. Jagr just showed you why\nhe is much better than his regular season stats. He is also a lot\nfo fun to watch in the playoffs. Bowman should let JAgr have a lot of\nfun in the next couple of games since the Pens are going to beat the pulp out of Jersey anyway. I was very disappointed not to see the Islanders lose the final\nregular season game.          PENS RULE!!!
O.K., only one series is done.  But I need to post something.\n\nBy the way, the Islanders just scored.\n\n\nRank Team Name                  Points   Final 4\n  1. roland_behunin                  5   CAL-6 QUE-7 QUE-7 \n  2.

Roger, you should check your facts before posting! The Kings have \nconceded 12 goals in 2 games.
M(--> were doomed to 4'th in the division.  I'm still not convinced the\nM(--> Sabres will win this series (I've lived in Buffalo all my life, and\nM(--> these last 10 years have been playoff Hell), but I'm just sitting\nM(--> back, crossing my fingers and hoping the offense can keep scoring\n\nHave no fear, Doug, the Bruins are toast. Statistically, only 2 teams \nin **all** the Stanley Cup series ever played have come back to win. \nAnd it couldn't have happened to a nicer team, with all the crowing \nfrom Boston fans I've had to endure over the last month. \n\nTake heart, Bruins fans. At least you finished first in the Adams \n<sinister chuckle>.\n\n- Jack\n\n * Laugh and the world thinks you're an idiot.
OK. I know I look pretty desperate on this bboard. I think I have posted\n3 or 4 messages already on the issue of NHL telecats over the last few weeks.\nBut, hey. I am pretty desperate. What I am interested is not just a\nsportsbar with multiple screens so thast I can watch the game on one\nof those silent screens. Are there any hockey oriented bars in this area.\nOr does some Patrick division or Adams division fan have a satellite dish?\nI don't mind paying an admission fee, if necessary.
Like many others I too was watching the Caps/Isles game when the went\nto the baseball game.  I too was pissed.  How could they interupt such\nan important game.  I understand about contracts, but you would think they\nwould have a clause in the contract concerning important games!\nAnyway,  us BLUES (and Hawks) fans got shafted worse!  While everyone\nin the U.S. and watched the game on ABC.  However those of us who live in\nthe central Illinois area were subjected to watching the Arthritus(?)\nTelethon.  The area that was most affected by the telecast did not get\nto see the game except through HAWK VISION.  This game, had it been\ntelevised, would have been the first home Hawks game shown in the area\nsince 1980.  This television BULL*&%$ has got to stop.  We are not only\nbeing deprived of seeing games, due to skyrocketing ticket prices, but\nwe are also being deprived of watching them on TV.\n PEACE,\n HAMMER
It was unlikely, improbable.  For the Bruins, it was the stuff of\nnightmares; for the Sabres, it was a taste of heaven.  \n   For the first time since 1983, the Sabres have won the first three\ngames of a series.  Last time was a three games to none victory in a\nbest of five against the Canadiens.  It takes a little more work this\ntime.  The Sabres seem ready to put in the extra work.\n   On the heels of a shutout, one that took away Boston's home ice\nadvantage, the Sabres came back with a four to three overtime win.  It\nwasn't easy.  It wasn't always pretty.  It still worked.\n   John Blue got the nod for Boston, supplanting Andy Moog as starting\ngoaltender.  Moog was pulled midway through game 2 on Tuesday.\nBuffalo started with a goal by Mogilny, his fourth of the playoffs, on\nthe powerplay, with Boston's Don Sweeney and Gord Roberts in the box.\nLaFontaine and Hawerchuk had the assists.  Goal number two was\nKhmylev's first of the playoffs, a pretty goal scored when the Sabres\nstole the puck and passed to an open and waiting Khmylev.  Smehlik and\nHannan assisted.  Determined not to be shut out, Boston tallied on a\nshot by Ray Bourque on the powerplay, with Colin Patterson and Bob\nSweeney both in the box.  Period two was scoreless, a split of\npenalties between the two clubs.  The third saw Boston's Smolinski get\nhis first, courtesy of Oates.  Buffalo resecured the lead two minutes\nlater, from former Bruin Bob Sweeney (Khmylev and Carney).  Neely tied\nthe game 3/4 of the way through the third, sending it into overtime.\nLast year overtime meant a Bruin win.  Last night, it spelled sweet\nrevenge, as Buffalo scored with Ray Bourque in the penalty box, on a\ntip in by Khmylev (Hawerchuk and LaFontaine) a minute into overtime.\nBoth teams finished with 34 shots.  \n        Power-play conversions--Boston 5-1. Buffalo 7-2.\n        Referee--Rob Shick.\n\nComments:  Shick pocketed the whistle in the third, allowing a lot of\nclutching and grabbing.  Buffalo's penalty killing unit was fantastic\nagain.  Mogilny was checking.  Granted he missed once and instead\nflung his body into the boards, but checking like this is a novel idea\nto Mogilny.  The crowd was unbelievable.  I don't think I've ever\nheard a crowd that loud in the Aud for a Sabres game (remember, I was\nonly five when they played for the cup.  I don't remember it and no\none took me to the games).  Doug Bodger, in a postgame interview,\nnoted that he tried to say something to Hawerchuk, but the crowd was\ntoo loud, even though he was shouting.  It didn't seem to matter, as\nmost of the Sabres and even Muckler said it was great.  Yuri Khmylev\ndidn't seem to realize that he was the game's third star and didn't\nskate out when his name was called.  Sweeney (2) and Fuhr (1) each\nwere out before Yuri made his appearance, sans jersey.  When asked in\nan interview later whether he knew how big a goal that was, he\nresponed yes (ok, it was through an interpreter and he said more than\nthat, even more than the interpreter said, but I digress).  The\ninterviewer seemed to think just because he doesn't speak English, he\nmust not understand playoffs.  Uh-huh.

-=> Quoting Bill Gregory to All <=-\n\n \n\n BG> hey I saw that game!  I thought the Sabres looked better that you\n BG> described. It's Boston that looked weak and unsure of themselves.  Even\n BG> if (big if) they (bruins) win the third game what's that going to\n BG> prove?  They be lucky!\n\n\n     Well now the Sabres are up 3 - 0 in games, and its to\n     bad that Boston isn't putting up more of a fight as\n     that could have been the best series of the playoffs,\n     I think Boston will come out smoking in the next\n     two games and that Buffalo will end the series in\n     game six back in Buffalo, and say, how about those Islanders?\n     they are up 2 - 1 on the Capitals and will probably\n     win the series, only to be clobbered by the Penguins who\n     should eliminate the Devils in the next game.\n     I cannot see (i'm sad to say) anyone beating the \n     Penguins this year (again) and they will take cup # 3 \n     I'm afraid.  well talk to ya later.\n\n\nSteve
No, Boston probably won't go down easy, but if the Sabres hadn't won\ngame one Buffalo would have been out in four.\n\nAnd what problem are you having with playoff games here in\nBuffalo???!!!??? There's the Sabres-Bruins, Quebec-Montreal, and\nwhatever ESPN and ABC show, and on opposite nights there's\nToronto-Detroit and whatever ESPN(/ABC) shows.  More hockey than a\ngood chunk of North America, either side of the border.  It's\nwonderful, and there are thousands of folks who'd kill to be in your\nshoes, coverage-wise.
[stuff deleted]\n\n\n\nI think this goes along with a comment you made in an earlier post -\nnamely, Quinn taking advantage of a major league bonehead for a GM\nin St. Louis.  This trade was an absolutely stupid trade for St. Louis,\nand it was not the only stupid trade that this guy made.  We can give\nQuinn credit for being an opportunist here.\n\n[stuff about other trades deleted]\n\n\nHow do you figure?  Both Vancouver and Detroit did the same thing last year:\nThey both won their division, they had close to the same number of points,\nthey both went down 3-1 in the first round of the playoffs before finally\nescaping in 7 games, and they both got knocked out in the second round by\nteams they should have been able to beat, with less talent.  (Specifically,\nif I remember correctly, third place teams).  How does this make Vancouver\nmore improved?  Further, if I'm not mistaken, the Wings had more points than\nVancouver at the end of this season (albeit not many).
For those of you who read TV Guide, there's an article in next week's\nSPORTSVIEW concerning the NHL and major network broadcasting. Pretty\ninteresting.
I am curious to known if there are any professional sports teams whose\ngames are regularly broadcast on an FM station.  The only one I am\naware of is WYSP in Philadelphia who carries the Eagles' games.\n\nIf you respond to me I will summarize for the list.
Just a side note, squid/octopi made their way to the ice in Buffalo.\nI still don't understand why Buffalo, but maybe it's lucky.  :-)  btw,\nthey shovel them up from the ice here, using the shovel used to scoop\nup the snow the zamboni leaves as it leaves the ice.  Although Blue\ndid give some technical directions on its removal, motioning with his\nstick.

ESPN must have some very poor marketing people.  They are only concerned with\nfeaturing players (i.e. Mario) than featuring good competitive hockey.\n\n\nI've heard that this is because most of their market is East Coast and hence\nwould prefer the Wales stuff.  Also, don't expect Canadian teams on ESPN.
With the recent demise of the Chicago Blawkhawks (much to my delight) I\nnoticed their 8 (?) game playoff losing streak (4 to the Pens last year, and\nnow 4 to the Blues) and I am wondering what the NHL record for consecutive\nlosses is, if there even is one...\n\nI'm pretty sure that the Hawks have at least a 9 game losing  streak, since\nthey've had to have lost a series since their last championship (whenever that\nwas)\n\nBasically, I need something else to rag on my Hawks-fan friend with :)\n\nMike, the insomniaced
I agree thouroughly!!  Screw the damn contractual agreements!\nShow the exciting hockey game.  They will lose\nfans of ESPN (of which I have been one for quite a while) quickly \nwith decisions like this.\nJust my $.02
That would be Clint Malarchuck.  It was speculated at the time, that\nthe injury was so serious that had he been playing at the other end\nof the rink at the time (he was playing in the same end as the\nambulence is parked), he never would have survived.  Ditto, if he\nwere playing anything other than a league with an ambulance on \nstandby.\n\nIf you've seen video tape of the incident, it is amazing how much blood\nthere was.  It was literally spurting out all over the ice, as Clint\ngrabbed his neck and watched the puddle in horror.  \n\nAmazingly enough, he made a full recovery, and played again in the\nNHL.  He was getting on in years at the time of the incident anyway,\nand didn't play for too long afterward.  Some people speculated that\nhe just couldn't get himself back together after the incident, and I\nthink he had a bunch of other personal problems dogging him afterward.\nHe did eventually get back to form, and played another year or so after\nthat, and then I believe he retired.\n\nAnyone else?\n\n-- \n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCarol Boudreau            #44                         a.k.a.

Norman Green claims that he has lost money over the last three years\nthat he has owned the team.  When he bought the team, it seemed kind of\nobvious that he was going to have to deal with a few years in the red,\nbefore the team started making a profit again.  He gave the impression\nthat he was willing to do so.  He claimed two years ago that the team\nneeded to average only 8000+ fans per game in order to pull a profit,\nbut this season the team averaged 12000+ fans, despite increasd ticket\nprices.  I think the team's attendence and play was clearly in an upward\ntrend, which leaves me dumbfounded as to how he could ignore that in\ndeciding to move.  He was even offered the many concessions he rudely\ndemanded, such as guaranteed season ticket sales, cheap rent at the\nother two arenas in town, etc.\n\nOh well, I guess the bottom line is $$$.  Green wanted immediate huge\nreturns in Dallas, and wasn't willing to wait another year or so in MN. \nDallas gave Green a pretty stellar deal to play there (although I feel\nMinnesota's was quite reasonable), and he also has some cronies down\nthere as well.  All this means, is that Minnesota is without an NHL team\nfor a year or two.  Too bad for the NHL.
There was a discussion about how real fans were ones who respect their teams\nno matter ow bad they are. That's bullshit. Anyone who would follow the\nPens or the Pirates in parts of the early eighties on a devoted basis are\nlosers. It's OK to follow and be concerned about your home team. But\nto  give them respect even when it is clear the management and the players suck\nshould not be required of a true fan.A  true fan would follow the team in\ntroubled times to the extent that they could discuss how to improve the team.\n\nWhen I visit PIttsburgh, I'll refuse to go to a Pirates game since I think\nthe management has given PIttsburgh a team which could have been much better\neven if they couldn't sign Barry Bonds. Lert's say the Pens start doing to\ntheir own team what the Oilers have done this year and what the Whalers have\ndone in recent years, I would be hard pressed to show much enthusiasm for the\nteam. I'll still follow it and bitch about it. But I won't waste my\nmoney on mediocre teams.
Not boring is right!!! It is more likely to cause me to have a stroke!!\nI had to listen to game two on the Blackhawk station and I don't think I\ncould take another call of "And JOSEPH makes a SPEcTACular saaaaaave".\nNow I'm a Blues fan, but I don't want them to play "like" they played\nin game two. Sure the result was fine, but the Blues match up very well\nwith the Hawks so they really don't need to treat them like the 86 Flames.\nWe don't need a "Monday Night Miracle" to have a chance to beat Chicago.\nThe Blues can do it on talent. At least over the hawks.\n\nRich h.--- Go BLUES!!

My apologies for the typo - I meant the Wings had 5 power plays in the\nfirst period and the Leafs none.  \n\nAs well, my point isn't that the refs were biased, just that they were\ncalling a lot of penalties, which works to the benefit of the Wings.\n\nHaving the ref call a whole bunch of penalties against one team then\ncalling a bunch against the other to "make up for it" takes a lot away\nfrom what could have been a great game.
I saw Messier and Leetch shooting at a camera on Letterman(?).  I\ncould have been any show though, since I watch NONE of those late\nnight shows very regularly.\n					-John Santore\n\nPhiladelphia Flyers in '93-'94! \n\n=============================================================================\n ____________________                                \n/                    \                   "We break the surface tension \n\_________     ____   \                   with our wild kinetic dreams"\n/             /    \   \                        -Rush, Grand Designs\n\_______     /  (*) )   )\n/           / /\___/   /                 Go Philadelphia Flyers!\n\_____     / /        /\n/         /  \_______/                   John Santore (jsbh@andrew.cmu.edu)\n\________/
Just some thoughts:\n\nI don't usually like to post simply to make fun of a player,\nbut this time I couldn't resist.  During the Pens-Devils game\nlast night, second period, I think Kevin Stevens was in the\npenalty box, Nicholls punched Kjell Samuellson in the face,\nthen raised his stick like a two handed sword to defend\nhimself!  All Kjell could do, at 8'7" and 355 pounds, was laugh!\n\nAnd speaking of Swedish Penguins defensemen, Ulf is getting a\nlittle out of hand lately.  His cheap shots are getting more\nfrequent and more violent.  As everybody in the Meadowlands\nexcept for the officials could see last night, he rammed the\nbutt of his stick down one of the Devil's throat.  I've always\nsupported the argument "he does his job by being irritating,"\nbut he's starting to push it over the edge IMHO.  Of course,\nHolik's chop to Barrasso's neck wasn't too sportsmanlike either.\nIt seems that he was following the "The only way to beat the\nPenguins is to injure them" philosophy.\n\nAs my Modern Drama professor pointed out to me the other day,\nJagr was stoned pretty well Tuesday night, and last night as\nwell, although the 30 seconds he danced around the Devils end\nwas pretty exciting.
Yeh,but :\n\n1.Biran Sutter's playoff record as the head coach in St.L wasn't very\nimpressive. His Blues teams were eliminated very early in the playoffs.\nIt doesn't look like this trend will change with the Bruins.\n\n2. Bruins have never come back to win after falling behind 2-0 in their\nentire 68-year history. It doesn't look like Buffalo will just lose\ntheir next two games at the Aud with the way Fuhr has been standing on\nhis head.\n\nBasically,the Bruins will be on the golf course by next weekend.\nAlso,it seems like the whole Boston area has gone baseball crazy after\nan incredibly great start by the Red Sox(best record in their major\nleagues as of now). I would say that 70% of the callers to the Bruins'\nflagship station(SportsRadio 590) are talking about the Red Sox,about\n15% are yapping about the Patriots' upcoming draft,10% are on the Celtics\nand about 5% are on the Bruins.\nSomehow,no one around here is really schocked the way Bruins are folding\nearly.
