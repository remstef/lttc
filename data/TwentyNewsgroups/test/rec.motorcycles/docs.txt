]joe, i'm sorry you felt i was pissing on your list.  no disparagement\n]was intended and i would be most interested to know what i said that\n]made you feel that way.  \n\nyou didn't, I meant 'pissing' like boxer owners 'piss' on K bike owners\nand K bike owners 'piss' on boxer owners and so forth. in the end it's\nnothing more than co-owner ribbing. no disparagement was received or \nreturned intentionally, sorry 'bout the lack of :-)'s.
: [... SQUIDS ...]\n\n: I felt embarassed at this point to be a motorcyclist. I felt the eyes of those\n: in cages, witnessing this display, then glancing over to the dealers lot and\n: damning all those on two wheels. Needless to say, my friend felt a little\n: uncomfortable and we left. \n\nDid you express your embarrassment to the owner?  I don't blame you for being\nembarrassed, but I would have let my feeling be known that the behaviour of \ntheir sales staff and apparent enjoyment of such behaviour just cost them \na sale and all further sales.\n\n: I will now turn off my frustration and go ride... peacefully, to clear my\n: anger. I only hope that the cop who is following me home, has an open\n: mind and doesn't associate me with them. \n\nSound good.  Enjoy.\n\n: BTW, I can't afford a new bike.....\n\nWho can?
I, too, put a corbin seat on my Hawk.  I got the solo seat (which\ncould carry a passenger for a short distance) and it is 100%\nbetter than the stock seat.  No longer does my voice squeak after\nthe ride to work.
There was a guy around here who would do them on an early pre fairing\nWing with a Hannigan. He would get it right up and ride a ways. Pretty\nintimidating sight. \n\n  He was real good.

Humans definitely don't\n--have all the advantages.

It is a little known fact that a dog will\ninvoluntarily regurgitate and release an object that is too large to swallow. I\nwas told that if I were ever attacked by a dog I should ball my hand in a fist and\nforce it down the dog's throat. The dog would naturally gag and release, and become\nmomentarily disoriented. This commonly happens to humans when we go to a doctor and\nhave our throats examined ( Proof Positive ). In the time during the dog's\ndisorientation, the next move would be to wrap an arm about the dog throat in a \nchoke hold manner and constrict with all your might until the dog lapses into\nunconsciousness ( from lack of oxygen and halting blood flow ). Finally, run like\nthe wind to get away from the local area should the dog get up again and be really\npissed.\n\nOOOOOOOpsssss.

Grr. Hate the bastard who picked the weather for today.\n \n Went up to visit a friend overnight (about 45 minute ride).. rode up after \nwork, only minor drizzing for the last 5 minutes of the ride... rest of the \nride was very zen.\n \n Got up this morning, needed to go home and get some disks & stuff to work \non her computers with, rainy as all hell. Soaked and cold by the time I got \nhome.\n \n Since I didn't have another set of thermals which were dry, I said "to heck \nwith it" and drove my cage back up.\n \n Lo and Behold, those funny blue clouds were up in the sky and this warm \nyellow thing I haven't seen in quite awhile showed up when I was 10 minutes \ninto the trip.\n \n And me in my cage. Oh JOY.\n \n \n Happily, my right hand mirror finally showed up at the dealer (dropped the \nbike when I first got it, put on an EMGO replacement mirror... hated it the \nentire time that thing was on my bike because I couldn't see a DAMNED thing \nthrough it, plus it's flat instead of convex like the stock mirrors, so you \nget a NARROW ANGLE wobbly blur)... And I got a replacement windshield for my \nfairing (dropped the original and chipped the front edge... cosmetic but \nannoying)... so I spent half an hour happily unscrewing things and replacing \nthem this afternoon.\n \n 'Bout the only thing I still hate about the bike ('75 CB360T) is the damned \n"2 D-Cell Flashlight" headlight.
How about some sources for all these numbers? Or is this more stuff that\n"everybody knows"?
Is there a way to wax out a dull finish (minor scrathes)?  While\n"passngering" on my fiance's Bandit, my hip-pack rubbed against the tail\nand left a nasty dull finish and teeny scratches. Is there a way to get\nrid of these?  Buff them out?  Wax them out?\nhelp!

A long time back (months), I think a similar question was asked....\n\nA suggestion, in addition to Ed's list, was to put your windward knee out\naway from the bike.\n\nI tried it, and it seems to help, actually.
This summer (~July 20) my wife (Michelle) and I will be in Boston\nattending my brother's wedding.  After the wedding we are planning\nto motor up to Bar Harbor, Maine to visit some relatives for a few\ndays.  Our summer would be *made* if we could find a bike (or bikes)\nto borrow or rent to ride up to Bar Harbor and back.\n\nHere's some important details:  I've been riding for ~11 years,\n(my own bikes for the past 7 years), Michelle has been riding for the\npast 6 years (her own bikes), I've only been involved in one accident\nwhich was caused by a cage driver running a stop sign, I currently own\na BMW R90, Michelle owns a Yamaha Virago 700, we prefer cruising over\nracing, we've toured a fair amount, we're both licensed and insured,\nand we're nice people.\n\nSo, if anyone has a bike (or bikes :-), but the second one would have\nto be a Virago or something else with an equally low seat) that they\nwould be willing to loan us for 3-4 days in July, Michelle and I would\nbe eternally grateful. In addition to our friendship, you would also\nhave the use of our bikes should you ever pass through Minneapolis.\nIn exchange, we would be happy to take you and a guest out for dinner\nand an evening of wild bike stories, or we might even be willing to\ncough up some money for improvements to the bike(s), like new tires or\nsomething.\n\nAlso, any information about bike rentals in the Boston area would be\ngreatly appreciated.
good point.  the "list" actually started out as an extension of my GS\nv. FJ shootout list, which is why it got that name.  since inception,\nhowever, other boxer-interested folks have joined and the conversation\nhas not always been "geared" to gs/pd/st-specific topics.\n\n\nwhen i raised the "to expand or not to expand/that is the question"\nquestion on the list itself, there were mixed feelings.  the list has\nalways been open to anyone with a non-bouncing "from:" line and there\nhas been general agreement that only boxer-related stuff is\nappropriate.  almost all of the subscribers own R80/R100 GS/ST/PD\nbikes, although some R, RT and RS owners are also on it.\n\nat this point, my main interest for the list is to preserve the peace\nand comraderie while at the same time providing as wide access as\npossible.  the list is fairly technical, with "how do i do this?",\n"what kind of that should i get?" kinds of questions.  there has yet\nto be any non-BMW bashing, K bike bashing, or "any bmw mfg'd after\n1962 is a piece of shit" bashing.  such posts are, by consent of the\ngoverned, proscribed.\n\nif the simple name change would make a significant difference to the\nnet.boxer.owners, then i am not going to stand in the way of progress.\n\nso, hesh, let me turn the question around: have you (or has anyone\nelse) not joined the list because you felt your boxer was excluded?\n-- \n-- bob pasker\n-- rbp@netcom.com
I read that GM wants to keep the Design part of Lotus but lose the car\nproduction. And, I seem to remember, that the main problem with the Elan\nwas caused by GM's insistence that the Elan be re-designed (significantly)\nfor the US market which caused major design & production headaches. \n\n\nQuite true - brain fade on my part.
They bein' themfolk who tend to compose fair piece of the population;\nbein the ones that regard bikers as a loud, irresponsible, irreverent,\nreprobate rabble.  \nSure you didn't rape and pillage-- It's a relief to know that you were\nsuch gentlemen-- but because you were not completely out-of-hand you \njustify your lesser indescretions?  Some pretty distorted thinking, I\nshould say.  \nOh-- I'm sorry, I just noticed that you left mucho bucks (as in MONEY)...\nNevermind my criticism, I was out of line.  I forgot that when one leaves\nmucho bucks (as in MONEY) their behavior is permissable, perhaps even \njustified.\n\nKeep in mind that "themfolks" are the ones that could give a %$#@! when \na biker gets killed, when *their* elected officials institute further\ndraconian legislation (helmet laws, gun controls, etc.), the ones that don't \nrespect our rights on the roads because we do not respect theirs all "the\nrest of the time..."\nNeed I continue?\n\nSo continue to wear your stigma as a badge, but the next time you are\nwhining about "them" and the effect of their values on yours, remember\nthat it was probably the behavior of self-righteous wusses like myself\nthat kept "them" at bay for this long.\n\nEnjoy,

And DoDers are easily recognized by their own special wave.\nPay attention and I'll tell you how to do it. Hold your left hand out\nin front of you, fingers straight but apart - like a vase. You may also\nuse your right hand if you have a throttle lock or are stopped. Bring\nyour fingertips and thumb together, touch, and open back to the starting\nposition. While you are doing this, move your hand slowly to the left.\nDo it gracefully and with a waving motion. You are now imitating a\nsquid propelling itself about underwater probably in search of food,\ndrink, squids of the appropriate sexual orientation, or other squids to\ngo riding with.
Nice ridin' Tex. I use the California DMV recommended technique:\nslow as you aproach said dog and wick it up as you pass. I've often\ncontemplated putting the boot in said dog's muzzle as I open the \nthrottle, but have never tried that. I figgure the impact would \nunballance me and I'd dump the bike. A bicycling technique I've\nemployed was to use my frame mounted tire pump to fend off dog\nattacks. On one occasion I was attacked by a pack of four dogs at\nonce while peddaling up a steep hill. I lost my right sock, but no\nblood. I complained to the local Animal Control department (after\ncomplaining to the owner of the dogs to no affect) about the dogs;\nno more dogs, no more attacks. The telephone worked much better\nthan the tire pump.
How about some citations or is this just impressionistic speculation\n	on your part?\n\n For 30 years I've been laboring under the delusion that chain drives\n	were more efficient that shaft drives.

Spike is owned by both Tom and I.

I know the roads up there in Minnesota are pretty bad, but I doubt that\nthey are THAT bad.  I've never realy tried to watch my back tyre but, my 82\nMaxim 750 will pull the front wheel off the ground if I pop the clutch.\nAdmittedly, it is easier with someone on back, maybe that's what keeps the\nrear tyre down.  ;-)
When they explode 'em, all the screws fly away.
Countersteering is a method for *leaning* the bike.  Another method is\nleaning.  Once leaned, the bike turns all by itself.

Hey, the Lone Biker of the Apocalypse (see Raising Arizona) had flames coming\nout of both his exhaust pipes. I love to toggle the kill switch on my Sportster\nto produce flaming backfires, especially underneath overpasses at night (it's\nloud and lights up the whole underpass!!!
If this is the same as adjusting the shims between cam and valve, I have\nthe same question.  Do you buy a FULL set of shims before starting the\nadjustment process, or do you calculate the shims you need and then run\noff to the dealer in the cage to see if the right shims are in stock? \nObviously the latter would be cheaper (what do shims cost?), but are\nmeasurements of the shim need reliable enough to buy only the indicated shims?\n\nChris

[...]\n\nAw, c'mon.  The serious overreaction ought to be worth a couple of points,\nnot to mention the bit condemning everthing the flamee might ever say.\nThe non sequitur about guns and helmets is just the proper flourish.\n\nI personally am of the opinion that there are two types of good flames.\nThe first does trade ``quality,'' in the sense you mention, for heat.\nThis has a certain surprise value and if done correctly, which I\ncontend was done above, is reasonably entertaining.  While it is true that\nthe flame I posted does not mention anyone's habitual velocity, friends,\ndinner, or entertainment, it says what it needs to with the appropriate\nflair and it is short.  The weakness of this type of flame is actually\nthat it can easily be taken too far, at which point it becomes trite and\nboring.  (Witness the Infante thread recently....)\n\nThe other type of flame, which you seem to be glorifying above, has\na few weaknesses as well.  In the first place, it can get verbose and \ntedious in the extreme, particularly if the reader does not already strongly\nidentify with one side or the other.  In the second, discussing someone's\npersonal qualities, habits, and so forth can quickly become libelous.\n(Or is that slanderous?  I can never remember the difference.)  This leads\nto a proliferation of lawyers, which is widely regarded as a BAD THING.\nFinally, introducing polysyllabic words is problematic.  I can't haul my\nbig dic. around on my bike, and it would be bad form to use a word which\nactually turned out to have a meaning, especially one which ran counter\nto my use and flamage in general.\n\nIn summary, Blaine, your score for that flame is incorrect.  While it may\nbe the wunder-flame, the weaknesses you point out are not necessarily\nweaknesses, and your suggested corrections are not always useful nor\napplicable.  You also probably couldn't outrun a tennis ball with a\nflatulent dog stapled to your posterior, and I'll bet you and your \nmotorcycle lean to the outside while turning.  The same goes for anyone\nwho looks like you, too.\n\n\n-----\nTommy McGuire\nmcguire@cs.utexas.edu\nmcguire@austin.ibm.com

For what it's worth, I got my can in three days from Chaparral. That's\nUPS ground from CA to UT, YMMV. The stuff seems to work, and it doesn't\nattract grundge like PJ-1 Blue does. I gave it the acid test, a full\nday's worth of breaking in the Quadracer's new paddle tires down at the\nsand dunes. If there's anything wet & stickey it will be coated with\nsand at the end of the day, but the chain looked pretty clean.\n\nAs far as mail-order goes, if Chaparral has it in stock (and they can\ntell you if it's in stock, or about how long it will take to back-order\nit if it's not), I usually get it in three days. Competition Accessories\nalways seems to take a week or two to deliver. Motorcycle Accessory\nWarehouse also takes a week or two, and after trying to buy some boots\nfrom them last week, I don't think they actually stock anything. MAW was\nabout $30 cheaper than Chaparral on Alpinestars Tech 7 boots, but on\nMonday I was hoping to get them by the end of the week, so I asked MAW a\ncompletely unreasonable question: "Do you have them in stock?" The\nconversation went something like this:\n\nI need to know if you have some boots in stock.\n\n	Do you want to pay with Visa or Mastercard?\n\nI want to know if you have them in stock.\n\n	Well, the computer doesn't show anything, I'd have to call the\n	distributer to find out if we have them.\n\nSo do you have them or not?\n\n	Don't you understand what I'm saying? I have to call our\n	distributer to find out if we have them in stock or not.\n\nUh, right. So can you do it?\n\n	Yea, call me back in an hour, and ask for Phil.\n\nSo an hour later Phil isn't there, but Mike says he'll check, and call\nhim back in half an hour. Half an hour later Mike isn't there either,\nbut he left a note that says they'll have them by the end of the month\n(3 weeks away). Screw it, the 30 bucks isn't worth the hassle. I called\nChaparral and asked if they had them in stock:\n\n	Ooh, Alpinestars? Probably not, they are hard to keep in stock,\n	but I'll check. What size?\n\nSize 10.\n\n	Let's see, yes! Size 10, in blue & white, gray & white, black...\n\nI'll take the blacks!\n\nThis was about noon on Monday, they arrived Thursday morning. Once\nagain, three days via UPS ground. I _like_ Chaparral.\n\nI'm not completely down on MAW, they often have lower prices, but be\nprepared to wait.\n\nOh, and if anyone's in the market for sand tires and other ATV stuff,\nScorcher seems like a good outfit, friendly, fast, had the tires I\nwanted in stock, and were cheaper than Chaparral too.
When I needed heated grips I made them from pieces of an old bicycle\ninner tube and a cheap electric heating pad from the drugstore, on top\nof foam grips: soft *and* warm.  Cheaper by about a factor of 5, too.
I'm just starting out with motorcycles,  I've read up on the subject a bit,\ntalked to many of my friends who own/ride bikes and encourage me to do the\nsame.  But when I ask about what kind of bike i should be looking at... i get\nvaried answers.\n\n\nI'm 6'3", about 230#, large/athletic build...  I suppose that would help to\ndetermine the size bike i'd want.  I want something that's going to be fast and\npowerful enough to satisfy certain cravings once i'm used to it.  I also want\nsomething that is not going to be like a bronc my first time out.  Any ideas?!  \n\n\n\n\nBill
My fiancee' and I do quite a bit of sporty riding 2-up.  I'll tell you \nwhat we've found and the systems we've worked out.\n\n- On starts, accelerate MUCH slower than usual.  It's tough for the rider\nto judge how scary fast acceleration is, because we're holding onto something\nand leaning forward.  Remember this.\n\n- On turns, have her lean forward and at the same angle as you (normally \nthis means she isn't leaning at all.)  It's very disconcerting to be leaned\nover and have your passenger leaning so that they're sitting straight up.\nMuch balance is lost and this can be dangerous.\n\n- On slowing and stopping, do so MUCH slower than usual.  Again, it's tough \nfor the rider to judge how scary fast deceleration is, because we're holding \nonto something and leaning forward.  However, you'll figure it out fast\nbecause braking too fast will shove the passenger forward into you, which \nshoves you into the tank at an inopportune location.\n\n- Generally, have the passenger keep her knees against you and the bike, not \nout wide.  This helps balance and gives her somegrip.\n\n- When you passenger is in fear, she will squeeze her knees against you.\nNormally this means "slow down, and do it now!".  \n\n\n\nWe only have a couple signals.  "Slow down" is her either tapping me on \nthe back, or slapping my helmet with all her might.  Depends on the urgency\nof the matter :-)\n\n"Turn here" is done by her pointing in the direction of an exit.  This is\nalso the sign for "cool!  Look at that."  "I hafta pee" is the same sign\nas "turn here".  "I'm hungry" is the same sign.  "Go faster" is usually\ndone by her jumping up and down on her pegs in glee.  I usually see "slow\ndown" more often than "go faster".\n \n\nThe best thing to do before the ride is to talk to a riding buddy, and \npillion on his or her bike.  It's incredibly frustrating, because you're \nin almost no control.  Now, multiply that feeling times ten, because\nyou as a rider know what your bike will do, and your passenger will likely\nfeel you're about to scrape hard parts all the time, or lock up the brakes\nat any moment, or go careening off the edge of a volcanic mountain, etc.  \nPillioning yourself is good training to take somebody on your pillion pad.\n\nAlso, remember that it's much more draining and tiring to ride 2-up\nthan by yourself, because you're concentrating on much more, and\n"in the Zen of the moment" less.  Remember this.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n   Pat Loughery [patlo@microsoft.com] Seattle, WA\n	 DoD #393, AMA, VME, DIOC, 1KSI=2.53\n '91 VFR750F, '91 Nighthawk 750, '82 Seca 650 Turbo\n		^^^ For Sale

Yesterday, a friend had asked me to accompany him to a local motorcycle\ndealer. It has been a while since he last rode (>10 years), and I myself\nhave never bought a new bike from a dealer. What follows is an experience\nof that visit and of an observation of "SQUILDLY" behavior by other \ncustomers and/or sales personel:\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nI ride with a group of friends, who mainly are into "cruiser" type bikes. My\nfriend was hell bent on getting an Intruder and had seen a few used ones. He\nwanted to see what the new ones were going for, so we happened upon a dealer\nthat sold both Suzuki and Yamaha. \n\nThe place was fairly busy, so we browsed a bit. We happened upon a few \nIntruders, most of which had SOLD signs on. My friend had been bitten.\n\nWell the salesdroid appeared and as my friend started chewing the fat, I \nmoseid on outside. The next thing I know, I see 3 or 4 sport bikes pull in.\nI could stereo-type the type of riders (backward ball hat, oakley, IQ <40),\nbut I won't. Well they went inside, I didn't think much of it. I figured\nto each his own. I went back in to see if the salesdroid had his fangs\nfirmly implanted into my friends back,  when I noticed the "hormone gang"\ntalking to other salesdroids/managers. Lot's of laughter, jokes etc. No big\ndeal.\n\nHere is the part that concerned me. The "HG" and those shop personel that were\nnot busy with customers went back out, where said "HG" members fired up their\nrides and did the obligatory reving up of those 600 beasts. At this point,\none decided to see how much rubber  a Katana 600 could deposit in the drive.\n\nSQUIDS, I thought to myself. BUT I was appalled that the salesdroids/manager\nnot only condoned this behavior, but encourged it, to the point were they\nwere betting how long he could keep it up and egged him on to pull a wheely\nas he rode off onto a busy street around rush hour. THe girl that was riding pillion on another bike, seemed rather hormonal about this display, and urged her\n"pilot" to quickly catch up. The others followed, making sure there Kerkers\ncould be heard as well as felt.\n\nI felt embarassed at this point to be a motorcyclist. I felt the eyes of those\nin cages, witnessing this display, then glancing over to the dealers lot and\ndamning all those on two wheels. Needless to say, my friend felt a little\nuncomfortable and we left. \n\nI will now turn off my frustration and go ride... peacefully, to clear my\nanger. I only hope that the cop who is following me home, has an open\nmind and doesn't associate me with them.

What about ethanol?  It's available here in corn country and its octane is\nrated at 89 or 90 and costs the same as "normal" 87 octane.

Sure don't know what bike was being worked on but it sure wasn't a\nVirago.  I've owned both the 750 and 1100 and you can do the filter\nchange in about 5 mins and nothing has to be removed.  Obviously the\n"new" bike was modified as the stock machine is simple to work on.\n  Watching for imitators!!

Interesting.  All I can say is that I haven't seen any wear in the\n1000 miles I've used the stuff on the Ninja, and the bike stays soooo clean.\n\n	I'll check back again in a few thousand more miles.\n\n	While we're on the subject, whereinthehell can I find a 532x110\nendless chain, other than the dealer (no, rivet-type master links are not\nacceptable)?\n\nLater,
My Kawasaki KZ 750 L4 has 2-3 millimetres of play on the gearchange\npedal axle, in other words, I can move the axle sideways & up-and-down\nfor few millimetres to each direction. This doesn't bother me when\nriding, but I guess fixing it wouldn't hurt. Last summer I took the\nbike to a shop to have the valves adjusted, and the mechanic mentioned\nthat it should be an easy job. All I would have to do is to remove the\nfront sprocket cover and replace a bushing or a seal that I would find\nthere. Well, upon a closer inspection I discovered that the gearchange\naxle doesn't even run through the sprocket cover. It seems that, in\naddition to removing the cover, I would have at least to remove the\nsprocket and then the cover that is behind the sprocket.\n\nQuestion : Would removing this small cover from the left side of the\nengine enable me to lay my hands on that bushing/seal (Don't know the\nexact term in english, sorry) ?\n\nQuestion : Has anybody done this disassembly job for this or some\nother purpose ? Does the oil, for example, stay inside the engine ?\n\nThanks !
: Oh bull pucky, Ed. They use dogs because a) Many people are\n: scared shitless of them and b) because of the nose and the\n: vision and hearing. Without their cop partner in attendance,\n: the dog is so much meat in the hands of any human with\n: a bad attitude and al ittle training in violent force.\n\nOne of the things that police dogs are used for is to\n"take the bullet" instead of the human police officer.\nAs Charles said, many people are scared of dogs and will\npanic when one goes on attack.  They will then turn their \nweapon on the dog and this allows the police officer to\ntake control.\n\n: Your advice is correct, but a dog is still no match for a trained\n: human in a fight.\n\nA single person vs. a single dog in a face-to-face confrontation should\nreally be no contest.  The dog is no match for a human willing to fight.\nMultiple dogs is a different story . . .

Is (was? :-( ) your HG zipper the nylon-coil type or the kind with\nmolded plastic teeth? I've only tried it on the coiled nylon type, and\nit doesn't take much squish to fix the problem. I found I was overdoing\nit (no broken parts, but the zipper was too hard to pull) so after\nspreading the zipper pull jaws again, I tried with Vice-Grips. No, not\nthe usual Grip Of Death technique, I adjusted the closed Vice-Grips so\nthey were snug on the zipper jaws, then released them and tightened the\nadjusting screw a bit. A couple of iterations and I had just the right\namount of Zipper Squish (TM).\n\n\nI've had two zipper pulls fail on my Aerostich suit (actually on the\nAccessory Ellipse), and they sent me a few replacement pulls free of\ncharge. I don't know what brand of zippers HG uses, but parts ARE\navailable for YKK's plastic zippers. Replacement was pretty simple, just\nbreak and remove the plastic knob at the top of the zipper that keeps\nthe pull from coming off the top end. Slide on the new zipper pull. Then\ncrimp on (Vice-Grips again!) a replacement zipper stop.\n\nYou might try fabric stores & such and see if they sell replacement\nparts.\n\nOh, for what it's worth, the coil-type zippers on the Eclipse tankbag\nare also YKK.
Not to start *another* shaft effect discussion, but the twist you\n	feel when revving sitting still is due to the larger fly-wheels that\n	the BMW R-bikes (maybe K's too, dunno) use. If you whack the throttle\n	at stop lights, it'll really rock the bike over (to the right).\n\n	<snip> 	<snip>\n\n	Please post if you come to any conclusion on this. I am thinking\n	of putting a light on each cylinder guard on my R100S, and was\n	wondering whether I was going to have to switch lights off every\n	time I was under 5,000 RPM :-)
Sounds like you are getting a pretty fair price (assuming it is in\nnice condition)
I bought a Yamaha XS850 with 8K miles.  Over the last 2 years, I've put 30K\nof commute miles onnit.  Valve adjustment intervals are suppossed to be every\n5K.  Well every 7.5K or so, I've checked the pad clearences, and they never\nchange!  If anything, the clearances seem to be getting a little smaller which\nmakes no sense to me with the pad system - the pads should wear until the\nclearances are too great right?  I know that threaded adjusters can tighten \nup, but I didn't think these kind could.

Student =====----\n\n\nI second the commend from Dr. Speed, get a new tire.  It's like your\nbrakes, something you don't want to take chances with.  I waited too long\nto take care of my front tire once and it went flat on me, doing 70 MPH\ngoing down the grapevine towards Bakersfield.  At that instance, I would\nof given any amount of money for a new tire.  I'm lucky to be here.
So, hey, like, does this work the other way? If I was to like, you\nknow, strap a generator to my FZJRR11000KRX and route its output to\nthe chain, could I increase the horsepower? 32 meters a sec is\npretty nice and all, but, I'd still like to be able to blow away \na Goldwing without going to nitro...
I would stongly recommend a factory service manual, and if you are not\nan experienced machanic then get a chiltons or haynes (sp?) ALSO.\nMake sure the bike has cooled at least 6 hours since being run.\nRead the books and if you have more questions you could mail me.\nAlso, be very careful when tightening valve cover bolts.  They take\nvery little torque and breaking one is disaster.
After failing my State of New Hampshire Noise Gestapo test with my HD\nSlash cut pipes I installed my new Bubs (which I had been planning to\ndo anyway), went to a different in spection station, and passed with no\nproblem at about 97 dB.\n\nTwo points:\n\nFirst, I don't think the first dude did the noise test correctly. \nHolding the meter close to his body probably caused a high reading, and\ndoing it inside the garage with the door closed undoubtedly enhanced\nthe dB level! So if any other NH riders need to get this done, make\nsure the inspection is done outdoors with the meter held well away from\nthe body.\n\nSecond, these Bub pipes are bloody terrific. At low revs or cruising\nthrough town, they as quiet as the stock pipes, but have a sound thats\na more throaty, purring, rumble.  When you open her up to >3000 RPM\nthey emit a wonderfully satisfying rumbling roar. Best of both worlds!

No, the Grand canyon is not too far away.  Short side trips to Kolob\n(between Cedar City and Hurricane) and Pipe Springs (on the way from\nHurricane to the Grand Canyon) may be interesting--they are right\noff the highway.  Pipe Springs (a small fort) gives you real insight\ninto just how the pioneers lived.

Car accessory shops here sell stuff called T-Cut, which is a very fine\ncutting paste for paint, and this will remove the dull finish and\nminor acratches. It will also remove all the traffic film and stuff that\nyou probably don't realise is there, and give your paintwork its original\nlustre and shine. It can sometimes react badly with metallic paint, though,\nso try it out carefully before going to town with the stuff. Afterwards\napply wax polish, and all will be well again.\n\nBTW - don't confuse T-cut with the cutting paste used for grinding in \nvalves...the principle's the same but the coarseness is vastly different...

What about GREASE II?????\n\n	Arun.\n	Cool Rider.
It is far from new.  It's been around almost as long as dirt.\n\n\n	I had one for one of my old bikes.  Worked fine.  I'm sure, being\nrigid and nonflexible, that the "Cyclelok" would yield instantly to the freeze\nand break routine.\n\n	But then, for $40, what do ya want?\n\nLater,
Don't forget little girls!  My not-quite-2 year old daughter now\nexcitedly points and says "motorcycle" every time she sees one go\npast.  I've done my work.

ok.  so what's an "exhaust bra"?  i'm guessing it's not a fabric thing that\nstraps to the pipes...  does it go over the chin fairing/lowers in some way?\ni usually don't ride with the lower plastic...
Apparently the instinct to brake in the face of danger isn't as strong \nas the instinct to freeze up and do nothing in the face of danger.  Hurt\nfound that a surprising number of accident-involved motorcyclists hadn't\nused their brakes at all prior to impact.  \n\nI think the only way you'll ever use countersteering reliably and correctly in \na crisis is to make it the only conscious method of directional control you\never use, and to practice it constantly, even when you have no need to do\nany turning.  If you follow me down a long straight, and I seem to be \nwiggling back and forth randomly or suddenly without obvious need, it's because\nI'm practicing countersteering and avoiding imaginary obstacles directly in\nmy path.  All of this practice may indeed be futile, but if I have even\nmilliseconds to react, the most *familiar* tactic available (and hopefully \nthe most automatic) will be countersteering.  The same logic applies to braking\nwith the front brake, of course.
Has anyone noticed that all this happened since Chris Perez was gifted\nwith a membership?\n\nAnyone for rec.motorcycles.beemer.club.whiner? I know this might get\nconfused with K-whiners, but maybe there's a connection?
Sorry to be contradictory, but... I've had my Nighthawk at 45 degress\nwith the horizon and I wasn't banked over in a turn...  \n	The hard part is getting the front in off the ground.  I rev to about \n7,000 at DROP the clutch.   Even harder is keeping it from coming up to far--\nI use the back brake as well as the throttle.  Once its up, it'll wheelie just\nlike any other bike.

I was privelged enough to experience my first Volvo attack this weekend.\n\nI was last in a line of traffic that was about 6 vehicles long, riding\ndown Rt. 40 in Groton Ma.  At the side of the road, sitting off on the\nshoulder was the killer Volvo in question.  No brake lights, no turn signal,\nnothing.  We were doing about 40 mph and I was following the cage in front\nof me about 2.5-3 sec. back.  Well, as said cage passes the Volvo, the\nBrain Dead Idiot (tm) behind the wheel decides that she doesn't need to wait\nfor me to pass also and turns out perpendicular across both lanes of traffic\nso that she can turn around...  So I get on the brakes in a effort to not\nT-bone it, and the horn in an effort to wake the BDI up.  As she finishes\nthe turn, she looks up at me with a completely blank, uncomprehending\nstare.\n\nWhere can I get rocket launchers for the VFR?\n\nDean

A friend of mine (who's probably reading this right now) just bought a new\nYamaha Virago 750.  After spending 1-2 hours very late one chilly evening\nwatching him struggle with the bolts (had to remove the right peg, loosen\nthe brake pedal, &c. &c.) I've pretty much decided never to get this\nparticular model unless he or someone else wants to change the oil/filter\nfor me.  Compared to the 5-minute change he was used to for his Honda, this\nis just a design flaw/oversight in my eyes.
Works really well on my 'bike too.\n\n\nTony
I've only ever done it in an automatic. I was sitting in my Olds, in\nthe winter, at a light, when I heard screeching behind me. I managed to\ndart into the left turn lane before the sliding Jetta wound up half\nwhere I was and half in the parked car beside where I was. I've never\nhad occasion to do it on a bike, but I imagine that it would be even\neasier, because you could slip beside the car in front. Giving a gander\nat the mirrors while at a light will give you time to get the clutch\nout smoothly when you notice trouble, instead of waiting for the\nscreeching.
An extended ride as a passenger on a 750 ninja.\n\nOwww.\n\nWell, I hate to be a wet sock, but, well...\n\nI was a passenger on many bikes for the longest time before I started\nriding myelf, and I grew to hate long rides on sport bikes.  The passenger\nseats are not designed for long rides.  The passenger positions aren't\neven usually designed for short rides.  I ended up torturing my knees and my\nback by taking long rides as a passenger on sport bikes.  One of the\nreasons I originally liked my current guythingy so much was becase he had\na BMW. :)\n\nI'd suggest a shorter extended ride at first -- a short turn in the mountains\nor some such.  Then see how much pain she's in, and proceed from there.\n\nThe best advice I'd give a beginning passenger:\n\n- Don't get on the bike until the rider says its OK, and work out some sort\n  signal for the rider to tell you when its OK to get off.  After I get on \n  the bike I squeeze my riders hips to tell that I'm ready, and at the stop\n  he nods his head to show its OK for me to get off.\n\n- Keep your feet on the pegs at all times.  Don't wiggle (unless your rider\n  asks you to :)\n\n- The best passengers are those which are unobtrusive.  Echo the movements\n  and lean of your rider.  Look over the shoulder thats most comfortable,\n  but during turns look over the shoulder on the inside of the turn.\n\n- Get used to your rider's shifting style (Riders:  use a reasonably\n  consistent shifting style).  Avoid "helmet bonk."  Helmet bonk is \n  when your rider revs the bike up and then shifts and the sudden change\n  in foreward acceleration causes your helmet to bonk his/hers.  It\n  gets old real fast.\n\n- When pulling to a stop, put a hand or both hands on the tank to keep\n  your weight from pushing your rider up onto the tank.  Putting your hands\n  on the tank is also a good way to stretch your back if you're in pain,\n  but I'm told it gets harder to steer in turns if you leave them there.\n\n- Switch your hands to the guardrail to stretch your shoulders, but be \n  sure and squeeze your thighs while you're doing it so your rider knows you're\n  still there. :)  The guard rail isn't as safe as holding onto your rider.\n\n- Don't be afraid to ask for frequent stops if you're in pain or\n  losing feeling in your feet.  Passenger seats are not generally designed \n  for comfort.  Work out some sort of pull over signal beforehand.

WARNING WARNING MAY CAUSE UNPLEASANTNESS!\n\n\nIt's a "make before break" type of switch.  If not required, it ought to be\nfor high-low beams.  \n\nThere might be a wee problem with this.  If you use both filaments at the\nsame time, the bulb is tossing out a great deal more heat than normal.\nPossibly enough to shorten it's life span.  My Honda CRX cage [a cage that\nreally wanted to be a bike] had wimpy stock lights.  So we used to run\naround with both beams on.  Made a mucho big difference - until both low\nbeam filaments died nearly simultaneously!  This was two weeks after\nfinding out how nice it was to use both beams.  I replaced the lights with\nquartz-halogen lights and that ended the problem.

}I need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my 750 Ninja.\n}This will be the the first time I've taken anyone for an extended ride\n}(read: farther than around the block  :-).  We'll be riding some twisty, \n}fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).\n\nUnless she is really adventurous, do NOT take her on this route for her\nfirst extended ride! That's kinda like taking someone on a no-show 10-way\nspeed star competition as their first skydive.\n\n}This person is <100 lbs. and fairly small, so I don't see weight as too much\n}of a problem, but what sort of of advice should I give her before we go?\n}I want her to hold onto me  :-)   rather than the grab rail out back, and\n}I've heard that she should look over my shoulder in the direction we're\n}turning so she leans *with* me, but what else?  Are there traditional\n\n1) If the Ninja has adjustable suspension, adjust it to a stiffer\nsetting so you don't bottom out in bumpy curves.\n\n2) Tell her the 3 cardinal rules are:\n\na) NEVER EVER EVER EVER put her feet down. Not when you stop at a STOP\nsign, not when she thinks you're gonna crash, never. Keep them on the\npegs until you tell her to get off the bike.\n\nb) She is to hold onto your waist. She should hold on tightly enough\nthat she won't slide off the bike if you twist the throttle a bit. And\n(added bonus for you here), she should keep as close to your butt as\npossible so quick stops don't make her slide into you and knock your\nballs up onto the gas tank. You decide how best to word this.\n\nc) Just stay perpendicular to the bike; straight up in the seat. Don't\nlean your body into curves, just go with the bike and stay perpendicular.\nDon't look over your shoulder.*\n\n3) Remember at all times that you have a passenger on the back. That\nmeans don't pop the clutch, and try to corner and stop smoother than\nusual. Be aware that if you jump on the brake, you're going to have\nthe equivalent of a 100 lb. dead weight crashing into you from behind,\nso be prepared for that.\n\n4) Make sure she pisses before the ride even if she says she doesn't\nhave to go. No anti-women stuff here; I have a tiny bladder myself.\n\n5) Remind her to look around while you're riding. Point to things\nof interest. It makes the ride more enjoyable to her (she won't get\nso focused on just looking at the back of your helmet), and it gives\nher ample excuse to squeeze you to show she saw what you pointed at.\n\n* My wife and I tried the MSF-recommended "look over the rider's\nshoulder in curves" bit, and it just didn't work. The timing of\nher weight shift was unpredictable (especially on the Maxim because,\nunlike the Ninja, the upright riding position really restricts the\npillion's view of the road ahead). Next time I had her just remain\nperpendicular to the bike, and I could hardly tell there was someone\nelse on the bike in curves, and she weighs substantially over 100 lbs.

To follow-up, I had a bad experience w/ a Krypto Lock too...\n\nLast year I bought a Krypto Cable II (3/8"x3-4' long, something like that)\nthat by all standards seemed like a decent piece.  Until I used it anyway...\nBefore I ever used it for security purposes, I used it for entertainment\n(minds out of the gutter, please), which is to say that I sat fiddling w/\nit while watching TV (the night I got it).  After three minutes of mindless\nfiddling (of course it was mindless, remember I was watching TV) the entire\ntumbler mechanism came out on the key!  Not unlike that old Georgie-porgie\nnursery rhyme.  This left a very empty cylinder and a very non-secure \n(read "swingin' in the breeze") cable lock.\nKinda makes me wonder about any flat key-style lock.

When it's too windy to stand.\n\nWhen you're on the road in high winds, stay alert.  Even more alert\nthan your "alert 'cause you're on a motorcycle and they're out to kill\nyou" kind of alert.  Be aware of the terrain, and how it may funnel\nwind in sudden gusts (well, not gusts to somebody standing there, but\nit's gusty 'cause you ride through it).  If you are riding in a steady\ncrosswind, be aware of a hill that will block the wind, and adjust your\nlean angle.  Be aware of passing trucks to your windward side, your\nlean angle will change dramatically both as you enter and as you leave\ntheir turbulance cone.  Reducing your profile may help, ie, lean on the\ngas tank and kiss the triple clamp.  Keep a nimble hand on the\nsteering, be ready to countersteer into and out of sudden wind bursts.\nKeep a larger than usual buffer zone, both ahead and behind, and to the\nside, you can easily be blown half a lane over before you can react by\ncountersteering.  Keep a close eye on traffic in your mirror, if\nsomeone is coming up wanting to pass, get out of their way early.  Stop\noften for short brakes, extensive riding in high winds is both mentally\nand physically fatiguing.
Thanks, Jody. I can't say I've ever seen it summed up so succinctly before.   \nI might only add two things.... stupid road design (or poor, at least) and\nwe deal with it for the fun and *brotherhood* we share with others who take \ntheir lives in their hads to feel the wind in their hair....IMHO.\n\nBinger
BUTT, BUTT, THEN YU W0NT BE ABLE T0 $EE THE CAR$ $NEAK!G UP BEHIND YU AND\nP0P A WHHHEEEEELLLLEEEEE T0 D!TCHUM AND THE CHICK$ DIG IT!\n\nSeriously, though, putting a helmet on a mirror is inadvisable because\nyou are then resting the weight of the helmet on the fragile foam\nliner that is expected to cushion your noggin.  And once crushed, that\nfoam never pops back.\n\nA variation of mirror hanging thing is what I do; with the bike on the\nsidestand (hey, the centerstand is for maintenance) I turn the wheel to\nthe stop (left) and can hang the helmet by the chin-bar on the right\ngrip.  There is no crushable foam in the chin-bar, and it is pretty\nsecure on there (as long as the forks are locked).  If I have to leave\nthe helmet with the parked bike (and the bags aren't on/full), that is\nabout the most stable place.
I have a feeling that you are not "the enemy".  There are without a doubt \ndickhead cops.  But there are at least as many dickhead bikers, even here \n(you know who you are :-).

HOW TO GET A VERBAL WARNING FOR 146 IN A 55\n\nIt's simple.  First, it has to be the first really nice riding day\nof spring.  The bike is back together again, and so are you.  Grab\nall your gear, put it on, and fill the tank with 94 octane premium\nor better.  Head out.\n\n	In Ames, there is a road that leads to the little town of\nGilbert.  Gilbert has one stop light, if that tells you something.\nHaving just gotten the bike back together, I thought I'd take it\nfor a short ride and check things out.  Heading out of town, I\nwent into the twisties at a slow pace, just under the speed limit,\nand started leaning around.  The pace quickened as everything felt\njust right.  Finally, the road straightened and I was ready for a\nbit of speed.  Grab third gear, open her up.  At roughly 90mph\ngrab fourth gear.  Look at as much of the bike as you can, and fail\nto notice a state trooper following a quarter mile behind.  Twist\nthe throttle like a fool, grab fifth gear at 130 or so, and see\njust how well she's been put back together.\n\n	At 146 (according to radar) I noticed the front fender was\nflexing a bit.  Thus, I slowed, pulled off the road, removed my\nhelmet and gloves, unslung the took kit I was carrying in a fanny\npack, and was just starting to tighten that fender when the trooper\npulled in all hot and flustered.\n\n	"Have you *ANY* idea how fast you were going?"\n"Not precisely, no.  I was paying attention to the bike and road,\nnot the instruments.  I just got her back together last night, and\nI'm just out here testing her out before I ride it in traffic."\n	"My radar says you were at over 145mph.  Care to tell me why\nI shouldn't give you a ticket?"\n"Because I was testing the motorcycle away from population and\ntraffic, on a strait and flat road, while wearing all the protective\ngear that safety demands?" (note: I wasn't quite that eloquent)\n	"Say, what kind of bike is that, anyway?"\n<I was eloquent on my cafe racer replica Honda 750, a Rat Bike>\n	"Yeah, I haven't had my bike out of the garage in years."\n<compare riding stories>\n<pack toolkit, having tightened that fender>\n	"So why were you out here?"\n"I figure every other idiot on the road is going to look right through\nme.  If the bike fails somehow in a 35mph zone, I'm dead.  If it holds\nup out here, then I know it will work right in traffic.  I do this\nevvery year when I rebuild her."\n	"Not any more.  You'll find a better place than *my* highway\nto do those speeds.  If I *ever* catch you speeding on my highway\nagain I'm going to nail you for everything I possibly can.  Now get\nout of my sight before I write you a ticket."\n"Yes, officer."\n	"And kid, keep your eyes open out there..." <drives off>\n\n	And that, in a nut-shell, is how to get a warning for 146 in a 55.\nI don't guarantee that it will work for you, but it worked for me.
The prob is that you're wrong.\nNewbie here.\nI just got off the phone with a salesman\nthat showed by newbieness.\n\nIf I remember what he said correctly:\nGSXR250 - no such thing\nCBR250 - NO.   Its CB250.\nFZR250 - no such thing.\n\nMost sport bikes don't have 250 versions.

A few random thoughts on riding with a passenger:\n\nThere's no substitute for a bike with sufficient power, having taken\npassengers very occasionally on the small (125 etc) bikes I used to\nride in the UK it was hard ! I'm now riding a GS1100 and that's great,\neven moving from my freinds GSX600 I was riding recently. This may be due\nin part to the fact that neither I, nor my regular passengers, are\nparticularly slimline !\n\nI always tell passengers, stay in line with the bike on corners, that makes\ntheir movements predictable.\n\nMy regular passengers both tend to hold either the rack or nothing at all,\nI don't really like having a passenger hold onto me except for short periods.\nAgain that may be biased by the fact that I've had a couple of new passengers\n(a friend recently for her first time on a bike) who hold on to me real tight,\nmaking any kind of maneuvering difficult.\n\nI've also discovered that on longer trips I prefer a passenger who moves and\nshifts their weight a bit. I recently took a work collegue to a meeting (about\na 1 hour ride) and he sat totally still the whole way which left me also\nsitting very still and getting a sore back.\n\nWe have a code system for turns, stop and for 'I need to shift position'.

Hi.\n\nI'm not sure what the other guy (can't track down his post for his name)\nwas talking about when he made the claim that cobralinks are not adjustable.\nThey are.  There's a space between each link where the "teeth" of the \nlocking head notch in.  Thus, each link is a possible locking point.\n\nAlso, (and this is not applicable to hard-core thieves who cart around\nliquid nitrogen and oxy-acetylene torches) the cobralinks "LOOK" a lot\nmore effective than kryptonite cable locks (IMHO) and I think the initial\nappearance effect is more relevant to bored-joyriders-nominally-adept-at-\ncracking-unsecured-bike deterrence, as long as the lock is nominally \nfunctional.\n\nFinally, I notice that when I ride with my leathers, harness boots, and\nthe cobralinks slung across like a bandolier (BTW, I've crashed in the rain\ndressed like this and the lock didn't pulverize any vertebrae), cagers give\nme a much wider berth, don't hassle me, and tend to avoid any potentially\ninflammatory action at stoplights.\n\nI love my cobralinks almost as much as I love my pre-80's Honda dinosaur.\n(I think I have a pavlovian drool reflex-I put the lock on (i.e., on my\nbody) and I can feel the bike already shaking away).\n\nMy first post.  What did I do wrong :)?\n\nsang\nDoD #0846\n'80 CX500\n\np.s. any other CX500 owners out there?  Please e-mail me. Got \nquestions about the weird handling on my bike.
I need help getting my ZX-11 (C3) to behave.  I've managed to get\nthe front suspension to be very happy, but the rear sucks.  I can't\ndo anything with it to make it feel ok.  The bike is very stable\nthrough the corners (I think because I have the front just right),\nbut when the straights get bumpy the rear is torturous.  It feels\nlike it actually amplifies the bumps.  And the damping doesn't seem\nto do anything in real-life, although you can tell the difference\nwhen the bike isn't moving.  I've tried 4-5 cm of sag (from\ncompleteley unloaded), but I don't know which way to go.  Has anyone\ngotten the rear of this bike comfortable?  And if so, what kind of\nsettings (esp. what sag) did you use.  I like to corner, but I also\nwould like my kidneys to remain intact.  This thing makes the new\nZX-7 feel comfy....
In light of the last letter I posted from Jeff Brody concering the crap\nthat is going on in the MOA, (which some folks took not as dissemination \nof information that I received, but as my own bad mouthing) I thought that\nI would post this one, which came to me yesterday.  This is from board member\nRobert Higdon to MOA Pres Chich Morse.  This is NOT my words, O.K. guys?\n\n                                   April 4, 1993\n\nre:  Cecil King's Nominating Statement \n\nDear Chick:\n      We have a very serious problem with the election for president of the \nMOA this year.  Cecil King's nominating statement (as it appeared in the\nOwners News) is 968 words, nearly twice as many as that is permitted by\nthe by-laws.  In pertinent part, the rules state:\n\n"Each candidate's biography and position statement shall be limited to\na combined total of no more than 500 words. The nominating committe shall cut afafter the 500th word any biography and position statement exceeding this length.\n\n    Obviously the nominationg committe was not up to the task.  Had Cecil's\nstatement been cut as required, it would have concluded approximately with\nthe word "undertiding" [sic] in the second paragraph after the commencement\nof his Position Statement.  As a result, Cecil has obtained what I view as a\ngrossly unfair advantage over the other candidates for president.  This does\nnot just taint the election for that office; it makes a mockery of the \nprocess.  I would appreciate your advising the board immediately what steps\nyou intend to take to rectify this caricature of a fair election.\n     Parenthetically, in your private correspondence with others, I would\nbe most appreciative that when tou call me an "asshole" you remind the\nletter's recipient that the re-publication of such a comment is almost\nguaranteed to have woeful consequences.\n   With kind regards, I remain,\n                                 Robert Higdon

I recently sold my Nighthawk in order to upgrade to a zippy little sport\nbike.  I am, however, partial to the bigger zippy bikes like the GSX-R 750.\n\nThere is only one in my town for sale, and he is not sure whether he wants\nto part with it or not!\n\nPlease send me email if you would like to sell yours, know of one for sale,\nor could just offer details on the performance of yours even if you wouldn't\nsell.\n\nI appreciate any help!\n\nTHE HYPEMAN
If the clutch is in, then a large chunk of counter-rotating mass is not\nrotating.  Hence, at a light, reving makes it twist.  Shaft effect is the\nrear end rising under power or (the real problem) getting lower to the road\nwhen the throttle is snapped shut (say when you are cornering and the heads\nare real close to the road).  New GS bikes with the paralever shaft have\nalmost no shaft effect.\n\n\n\nIt's a question of how long you spend at low RPM and how much you need the\nextra light.  At low RPM, 3K and under, they don't charge all that much if\nat all.  The alternators put out sufficient wattage, it just that you need\nto be at 4K RPM to get it.  \n\n\nFull choke.  Open the gas taps.  Hit the starter and ever so slightly blip the\nthrottle.  It should fire.  Cranking should be done with minimal throttle.\nMy R100 likes the throttles to be raised just a bit off idle.\n\nIt's an EXPERIENCE thing.  Like Zen, it's hard to describe.  It can be hard\nto learn if you aren't paying atttention to the differences between success\nand failure.  Especially if you get really pissed off and flatten the\nbattery while trying to get it to run.\n\nIf my bike has been sitting for a few weeks, I give it a short while to\nstart.  If it doesn't, I turn it off and wait a few minutes for things to\nvaporize in the fuel system and then it lights right off.  I've got dual\nplugs which make it easier to start.\n\n\nThe BIG fix is the Bing carb upgrade kit.  It's good for a few MPG and the\nparts are alcohol proof.  The parts it replaces aren't alcohol proof.  As\nlong as the bike isn't going to sit for long periods of time, gasohol is\nnice since it helps keep ping away.  If your bike doesn't ping on cheap gas\nyou ought to raise the compression! (Half a smiley, the BMW twins of the\n80s and beyond have lowered compression to keep the EPA happy.  Dual plugs\nand higher compression give back a big chunk of the lost perfomance).

Okay, here's what to do.   Get a drill and a sanding disk. Use, say a \n100 disk and go at it at a very low rpm.  If you don't have a drill, try\ncoarse steel wool and brake fluid.  Dot 4 has an uncanny knack for removing\n_any_ paint imperfections.\n\nOh, I'm not responsible for misuse or miapplication of either of these\ntechniques.

Has he realised yet....or are you hoping to fix it before he does ? \n\nIf you're planning to use T-Cut...BE CAREFUL. Sunlight fades paint and T-Cut removes the surface layer, so if its a older bike or very sunny where\nyou live then the colour of the T-cut panel wont match the rest of the bike.\n\n-Bob\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nBob Morley				PIPEX (Public IP EXchange)\nDoD #549				216 Cambridge Science Park\nOgrite					Milton Road\nCBR1000FL				Cambridge, CB4 4WA\nEly & District MCC			England

If your distance calc is correct for an "on the road distance" (and not\nas the crow flies), this is 900km a day for 5 days.  If you spend the\nentire time on interstates, which would be a total waste of time, that's\nat least 8 hours on the road every day not including eating/peeing/\nsight-seeing etc.\n\nI was contemplating a similar trip, but from Ottawa to LA, or\nmaybe Ottawa to Austin Tx.  \n\nI figured if I wanna do a trip of this magnitude and enjoy it, I'd\nhave to get my ass off the major Interstates and spend LOTS of\ntime enjoying the country around me; i.e. stopping with a camera,\nmeeting towns-people, going to a few bars.  No sense spending 2 weeks\nlooking out a helmet with the closest human contact found at the gas\npump.\n\nI estimated I'd need at least 4-5 weeks to make the trip worthwhile.\n\n\nIn question 8:)\n\n\nTry and stay off the interstates!!!\n\n\nDepending on your route and my plans, I may be heading that way as far\nas at least Detroit.\n\n\n\nCall the Whithorse Pess.

Just in case the original poster was looking for a serious answer,\nI'll supply one.\n\nYes, even when steering no hands you do something quite similar\nto countersteering.  Basically to turn left, you to a quick wiggle\nof the bike to the right first, causing a counteracting lean to\noccur to the left.  It is a lot more difficult to do on a motorcycle\nthan a bicycle though, because of the extra weight.  (Ok, so my\nmotorcycle is heavy.  Maybe yous isn't.)

since at least one other person was interested in this:\n\nmy FZR's black exhaust pipes are rusty and i researched getting them repaired.\nyesterday i bought a can of VHT 1500 degree black header paint and spent an\nhour sanding two of the header pipes by hand.  sprayed on paint.  thought\nabout how clean i was able to get the metal with sanding and determined that\ni wouldn't be at all suprised if the paint wore/chipped off in a month.\n\nsoooo call a couple of places up in minneapolis and discover that powder\ncoating, while extremely durable, will not handle over ~600 degree\ntemperatures.  the place i talked to said they were experimenting with\nsome new powder that is supposed to handle 1100 degrees but that it wouldn't\nbe available for months at least.  they directed me to another shop that\nspecializes in header coating.\n\nthe other shop said they have 2 coatings available.  one is aluminized that\ncan do 1200+ degrees and is "comparable" to powder coating for durability.\nthe other is silicon (i think) based and can do 1800+ degrees (!) but is\nthinner and not as durable.  both coatings have a textured finish (not\nsuper smooth) and should be cleaned with hot water and a brush.\n\nprice for 4 1-foot header pipes and a 2-foot 4-2-1 collector was ~$100.  i'm\nplanning to take the parts up friday and get them back (UPS) next week maybe\nwednesday.\n\nsounds to me like this kind of coating stuff should be way better than paint\nconsidering how much abuse the pipes get from road crap/rocks.

I have a '72 CL350 which I stopped riding about 2 years ago (I upgraded\nto an '84 Sabre 750).  I parked it in the corner of my parking lot, and planned\non draining the gas, spraying oil in the tank, etc. to get it ready to store.\nWell, after a lot of procrastination, all I ended up doing was throwing a \ntarp on it.\n\nWell, now I have to move and want to clean up the 350.  I tried starting it\n(with someone else's battery) and had no luck.  My first guess is that it is\nthe gas and so I plan on draining it and replacing it with new gas (I can only\npray that I didn't trash the carbeurators).  The question is, what do I do\nwith this old gas?  I am not going to run it in my Sabre, and I think that\nthere is enough that I don't want to burn it (campus police don't think\ntoo kindly about bonfires).

Cost is lower than OEM replacements and they weigh less. Also, in most \ninstances you do not have to rejet the carburetors to get a little more \nperformance. I replaced my OEM canister with an Ontario systems slip on.\nThe mid-range performance is better but I also notice a slight stumble at \n2-3K rpm. After talking to Kaz Yoshima, the developer and manufacturer of \nthe slip on, he thinks I might need larger pilot, idle, jets. Was not suppose\nto but maybe where I live makes a difference. Altitude, barometric pressure...\nAnyway, besides that minor glitch, I like the slip on performance and the sound,\nwhich is louder than stock, but not loud enough to annoy folks. The Ontario \nslip on use some sort of sound baffling technique to reduce the sound at full \nthrottle.\n\nJust remember, every bike is a tuned system. When you change the intake or\nexhaust characteristics beyond the allowable delta of the manufacturer, you may\nhave to change other areas to compensate. Like a complete change of the exhaust\nsystem, header and muffler, changes the exhaust characteristic to the point\nwhich re-jetting is required to compensate for the new engine breathing/pumping\nprofile.\n\nTalk with the folks who make the slip on you intend to use and ask them if\nthey have used it on your particular bike. Check with people who have the\nsystem also to see what they think about there slip on.\n\nAlso, as a last data point, in Sport Rider's first issue, did a review on a\ngroup of header and exhaust systems for the CBR600F2. They also included, as a \nside bar, the Ontario slip on, the Dyno showed an increase from stock of 5bhp at\nthe rear wheel, 85 verses 91. \n\nBuyer beware, of outrageous claimed increases in horse power! It may have been \ntrue in the past, but not today!

I've never ridden pillion very much but recently had an excellent \nexperience passengering with Dave Edmondson at pilot while in London. \n\nI found that it upset the bike much less if I rode with the pilot, that\nis, if I looked over his shoulder and anticipated when I should hold on\nhard for braking or acceleration. I tried to always look over the\ninside shoulder on corners and move as little as possible, leaving\nDave to manage me and the bike as he normally would the bike and \nluggage.\n\nHard acceleration can be quite unnerving as the feeling of being spit \noff the back is hard to fight. Similarly, I held on to the grab handles\ntightly when Dave needed to brake so as not to mash him to a pulp (I'm\na lot bigger than he is...). Reaching around him and pushing off the \ntank seemed like it would be very awkward and make it even harder for \nhim to manage.\n\nOn the rare occasions when I carry a passenger myself, I absolutely\nrefuse to carry anyone who is not properly accoutered for riding. That's\nhelmet, jacket, gloves, stout pants and shoes/boots as a minimum. It's \nnot my responsibility to provide this gear, but it's my responsibility\nto require it if they want to ride.\n\nAnd I agree with an earlier poster: if you've not had much experience\ncarrying a particular passenger and especially if you've not carried\nmany passengers before, take a few gentler rides of some duration before\nyou head off to a difficult road like Mines/Mt. Hamilton. That's a \nnasty place to find yourself in trouble.

: Now for those who have read this far - \n\n: 	Why did it rev at idle like that?  Is water in the fuel an\n: acceptable reaason or were they having me on?\n\nSound like the pilot circuit was say lean/clogged.  I don't think\nwater would cause a problem like this, but?\n\n: 	Apparently the oil pump is doing its job, and there was plenty\n: of oil.  Why did it seize?\n\nSee above.  Were you by chance coasting when it stuck?  On a two stroke\nyou only have (substantial) lubrication when you are giving the bike gas.\nIf it was lean on the pilot, that's why it stuck.\n\n: Oh, BTW - THe motor had been rebuilt just before I left Adelaide, so had\n: done about 1600 miles when it blew.  It was rebuilt because it had been\n: seized at some time before we got it, and it looked like that seizure\n: had happened at low mileage, because there were still hone marks in the\n: bore.\n\n: The rebuild we did consisted of a total tear down, new piston, rings,\n: small end bearing, and new gearbox bearings.  Big end and rod judged\n: OK.\n\n\n: Any ideas folks?\n\nYou mentioned an aftermarket carb?  (I deleted the text)  Looks like \n(to me) that's where your problem is.\n\n:      Zebee Johnstone  DoD #605   | You don't own an Italian motorcycle
Actually, a WERA racer, William Lumsden, considered running a Vmax in \nA Superstock.  He took it out to Talladega GPR for a practice day, and\n_really_ annoyed the 600 riders -- they usually got caught behind a \nsideways Vmax in the corners, and if they passed him going in, he'd\nblow by down the straight (usually wobbling).  Needless to say, since\nhe was 2 seconds faster on a 1977 CB400F, he decided against the Vmax.\n\nToo bad.

Greetings all,\n	Can anyone let me know status of UK law about riding motorcycles.\n\n	I used to ride one about 12 years ago and never took my DOT test ( One\nof a whole list of things I wished I had done when I was young),but I have passed\nmy car driving test. I now travel from Littlehampton to Brighton every day\nand I'm getting PISSED off with the traffic/road works. I thinking about getting\na 100cc bike ( Don't Laugh ) just to get "Streetwise" and to take my test, then\nto get a bigger one ( 400 to 600 cc ).\n\n	Now I have been told I don't have to do the CBT but what will I have\nto do to get a full licence ?\n\nThanks in advanced\n\nLeigh

The examiner's\nguidelines are laid down by the government, and the basic rider education\ncourses have no choice but to follow them. It surprises me that none of the\nrider groups here, either MAG or the BMF make much noise about the fact that\nthe riding test requires you to ride three feet from the kerb all the time\nin order to pass, that the front brake must be applied before the rear, that\nyou have to keep looking over your shoulder all the time (instead of just\nwhen it is justified) - there's probably a few more too, which I can't\nthink of for the moment. If the riding test could be rejigged a bit \nto include more of the real-world survival skills and less of the \nwoefully simplistic crap that it contains now, then the accident figures\nwould (imho) reduce still further.\n\nDon't think we should include countersteering knowledge in our test though...
Yes, Matt, dear Newbie, best advice is read here foe a few days.\nThis is your best source of info.\n\n(Kinda makes me glad that I discovered r.m well after I got into riding--\n could I have possibly sounded like *that* otherwise?  --eesh.)\n\nBTW Matt, despite the insults you are destined to face, great move \non taking the MSF course.  It will save your butt.\n\nGood Luck,
You could, but it would be considerably cheaper to spend $8 or so on\na trickle charger from K-Mart, Venture, or Target, then it would be\nto replace the halogen lamp power supply after you fuse it trying to\npump current into the battery...\n\nWhile charging, the charger should be putting out around 14 or 15 volts\nas well...

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nNow just wait one cotton picking minute here.... DoD rule 417.1.2 section 6\nparagraph 3 clearly indicates that multiple people can't lay claim to a bike\nin an "obvious" ploy to "artificially" increase the size of their stable...\n\nSo the question of the day is... Is Spike owned by a lady of true class and\nbreeding (my definition: any woman who rides :-) ) or by Tom the harely head???\nI also note that you lay no claim to Connie or Ol Sport.

The experience you describe is why I don't like to sit with my bike in\ngear - I figure there's a chance that I'll be startled in some way and\nstall my bike.  And I figure this is more likely than the chance that\nI'll be unable to escape some situation because of the extra time\nneeded to put the bike in gear.\n\nSo I concentrate on avoiding situations rather than making split-second\nevasive manuvers.  I split lanes so I'm not at the end of the line.\n(Unfortunately this is not legal in most of the country)  If I can't\nsplit (perhaps there isn't room) then I will stop near one side of the\nlane so I have an easy escape, and leave my bike in gear until the next\ncar has stopped.  I watch in my mirrors in the mean time to make sure\nit will!  Whether I really would have time to move should a car fail to\nstop, I haven't had to find out yet.  Some cars have an annoying habbit\nof racing up behind you before braking heavilly, so it can be hard to\ntell if they are planning to brake or not!\n\nSo in summary, position yourself for an easy exit, and then watch your\nmirrors until it's all clear.

Oh yeah, all the time.  On a nice spring/summer day, I roll down the window\nand drive around looking for bikes.  When a bike motors by in the opposite\ndirection, I stick my arm out and hi5'em.  My arm feels like a million \nbucks when I'm doing this a 60km/h.  I do the same thing with cyclists.\nThe only problem with hi5ing a cyclist is their always in the right hand lane.\nI hafta roll down the other window and hi5 them on the back.  Oh well, I \nthink they appreciate the thought. \n\nRegards, Ted.

It's  wet\n   kippers at ten paces if there's any repeat of this sort of thing!\n\n   Now, in keeping with the  grand tradition of wreck.moto, let's  mutate!\n   Take your partners by the hand...\n\n   On Tuesday morning I spent a couple of hours (when I -should- have been\n   working) with a  torch, brazing bits  of scrap metal  over the  biggest\n   holes in  Yamadog's exhaust  pipes (s'mazin'  what you  can do  with  a\n   couple of AA  cells and a  three-volt bulb!).   I stuck some  "gun-gum"\n   into the smaller holes and bunged the pipes back onto the bike.\n\n   So, last night  I'm on the  way home  when lo' an'  bloody behold,  the\n   sodding thing starts  blowing again.   I check  it out and  the gas  is\n   escaping from around  the clamp holding  the number two  pipe into  the\n   port.  As far as I can see (it being somewhat "hole of Calcutta" at the\n   time!), the nuts are still there  (stop that bloody sniggering, you  at\n   the back!), but the pipe is a bit loose.\n\n   This morning  I go  out to  the bike  and pull  out the  socket-set  to\n   tighten up me' nuts (somebody give that  spotty kid at the back a  good\n   slap  round  the  back  of  the  head!),  and  lo'  an'  bloody  behold\n   a-bloody-gen, I find that the outer skin of the pipe has separated from\n   the inner sleeve right at the clamp-mating bevel.  So, I stuff in a bit\n   of baked-beanz can and a bit more of Mr Holts' very best "gun-gum"  and\n   come to work (late again!) so that I  can ask of the oracle...  Will  a\n   brazed joint hold that close to the exhaust port?  Anybody tried it?\n\n   Oh, and if anybody can tell me  what the differences are between a  205\n   and a  207  brazing  rod (made  by  "Gaz"  [Yup!   the  camping  folks.\n   Surprised the marmalade outa' me, too!] in that place just off the Isle\n   of Wight) I'd be eternally  grateful (twenty-sodding-quid for two  rods\n   and I don't even know what I'm buying.

Because, unlike the UK, passing the average driving test over here\nusually only requires a pulse & a single digit IQ. Every state controls\ntheir own licensing requirements, so it's possible that there's a test\nout there that actually requires some driving skills, but I doubt it.
If you had been looking in your mirror, you would have seen the guy coming \nbefore you heard the screeching tires.\n\nWhen you're stopped at a light:\n\n1)  Stop so that you're got space in front of you, and a quick easy escape\nroute (between lanes, into a crosswalk, up a driveway, somewhere) if someone\ndecides they want to plow into you.\n\n2)  Keep the bike in first with the clutch in until at least a couple of cars\nare stopped behind you, so you don't have to waste a second you don't have\ntrying to get it in gear if you need to move.\n\n3)  Watch your mirrors.  In that situation, most of the hazards you are \ntrying to avoid are coming from behind you.  SIPDE (<-- msf-geek-speak)\nisn't just for when you're moving.  And you're less likely to panic and stall\nthe bike if you've got time to prepare before the guy's tires lock up behind\nyou.  (You still get the bejeezus scared out of you, but it's more a feeling\nof quickly-rising dread than a sudden jolt.)

Orating with wild abandon, prange@nickel.ucs.indiana.edu (Henry Prange) offers:\n%The grips on my GS are a wonderful thing in the winter and no problem\n%in the summer. Vibration? BMW's don't vibrate. Everyone knows that.\n\nI'd agree with Henry.  The grips are really nice to have in winter,\nand aren't noticably different from 'normal' grips in summer.  \n\nMy only complaint is that the 'low' setting might as well be 'off'.\nThis has been complained about by every reviewer, official and\nunofficial, that's ever talked about these grips.  The 'high' setting\nis often too high for use with lightweight summer gloves when things\njust get a bit nippy, but since 'low' doesn't produce a noticable\neffect, I end up turning the grips on and off to keep the temperature\nabout right.  This generally isn't a problem when wearing thicker\nwinter gloves.  When I asked the dealer if they could fix it, I\nreceived a consoling pat on the back, and their sincere apologies for\nthe poor design (actually, I was told they worked just like they were\nsuppose to).\n\nVibration?  What's that?  I ride a BMW twin.  You can barely tell if\nthe engine is fired up or not most of the time, smoother than silk\nsheets.

I was just wondering what kind (brand, name, etc...) would be best on this \nbike.... thanks for your advice....
Because I'm a guy and most of my pillions are female. \n\nAlso, the other reasons, like having an idea where you passengers\nweight is, it being a more comfortable position for the passenger,\nand it being a more stable configuration all come into it as well.\n\nHolding the grab rail is a great idea only for braking, when you\ndon't want the pillion to slide forward into you, otherwise I don't\nfind it works well.
Yeah!\n\nI found beelzebub inside a worm...yeah, that's it!\n\n(actually it was vodka - Gordon's if I remember correctly...\nI didn't even buy it (of course, that's probably the reason\nI drank _so_ much of it that night...never again.)
This is maybe not a Pet Peeve, but definitely a Playmate Peeve:\n\n\nDoes this make anyone's Skeptic Alarm (tm) go off?  No offense, Bill, I\ndon't mean to say that you're not being straight, but I wonder how you\nknow about this?  Have you actually every used your secret method to break\nall the different kinds of bike locks?  Or are you taking someone's word\nfor it?\n\nThe fact is, it is unlikely that someone reading anything here is going to\ngo into a successful bike-stealing business because they read anything in\nrec.motorcycles.  So please tell us what you are talking about.  We can't\neven protect against an assault, or discuss methods, if you don't come out\nwith it.\n\nSee, I have heard the ones about the pipes, and the liquid nitrogen, and the\ncordless Dremel tools, and a bunch of other ones.  The most plausable method\n(I am not a bike thief, so I really don't know for certain) is just to put\na rod through each wheel, and use four guys to just lift the bike into a\ntruck.  This works because most people don't lock their bikes TO anything.\nSince that method is so childishly easy, I figure a nice, visible chain or\ncable locking the bike to something is likely to make a lazy thief go on\nto the next bike.\n\n(Hey, finally an advantage to the weight and high CG of the Concours!  :-)\n\n\nWhat tactic are you referring to?  If we don't know what you are talking about,\nwe can't very well guard against it, can we?\n\nFor my money (literally) I rely on a combination of a motion-detector alarm\nwith pager when I'm out of earshot of the bike in a questionable area, C&C\ninsurance, and I try to park in obvious, visible areas with lots of people\nabout.  (See, if someone just plays with the bike without intention of\nstealing it, at least some eyes are on it, and if they get too rambunctious,\nthey'll set off the alarm.)\n\nThat's for a nice bike.  For a ratbike, the trick is to always keep its\nactual value well below blue-book, so that it looks so crappy nobody would\nWANT to steal it, and even if they were stupid enough to, you would make\na profit on the deal.  :-)\n\nSeriously, if I (for instance) need to go on a business trip for a week,\nand (sadly) have to leave the bikes sitting, they both get a shitty-looking,\nbut useable cover, locked on, and both bikes locked to each other and a\ncurb bumper in the parking lot under the light.  I usually rig the cable\nlocks I use (aircraft cable) so that if anyone pulls on either bike or\nthe cable joining them, the Concours alarm goes off.  And I have a friend\ncome buy every day to have a look and make sure they're still there.  The\nonly thing I have ever had stolen was a $60 cover, and that was over \nwinter storage, with the battery out of the bike (and thus no alarm).\n\nOh, put your own eyelets into the cover for the locks to pass through, and\nplace them so that they have to absolutely destroy the cover to get it off.\n\nThat's the best that I can think of.  Most of the locks I see people put\non bikes look, well, not too mechanically sound.  I like ABUS, since I have\npersonally removed Master locks from lockers with my boot.
Don't forget Robert Blake in "Electra Glide in Blue" (where else do\nyou get to see a full-dress Harley playing with dirt bikes?).\nAnd if you're going to count Smokey and the Bandit, then you darn\nwell better include "Pee-Wee's Big Adventure".

Good point, I'd overlooked that. The Eclipse has a 3 point mount, 1 at\nthe rear and 2 at the front, and it's very stable on the FJ. I have seen\nsome with harnesses that mount to the sides of the tank, and that would\nbe a real problem on the FJ.

But you already can go at the speed limit at 4000 rpm.  All you need\nto do is to find a road with a 35 mph speed limit.\n\nThis isn't quite as silly as it sounds.  If you take a nice day trip\nover back roads (*not* highways full of people trying seriously to get\nfrom here to there) then you might be able to hold 35 mph comfortably.\nYou could easily do 500 miles over three different weekends.  You\nmight even get to enjoy some of the scenery.  Yes, I know this is\nprobably not why you bought a 250 called "Ninja."

We were having a problem with instability in the universal gravitational\nconstant that day:  the closer I got to those exposed fangs (still dripping,\nno doubt, with the viscera of the last foolhardy experimenter cum canine\npsychology) the bigger and heavier the dog appeared to become.  Also, \nrecall that the distribution of the ~150lb is one five pound jaw+teeth \noperated by two 70lb muscles driven by a .005 ounce brain possessing an\ninstinctual heuristic composed of equal parts of bloodlust and ravening hunger.\nThe other ~5 lb is, of course, dog poop, but that varies all over the place \nas the dog deposits it regularly on the painstakingly manicured and tended \nlawns of the dog's owner's neighbors (whilst continuously replenishing its\ninexhaustible supply, no doubt by consuming the likes of folks like me).\n\n\nMy very thought at the time, but as I looked down at these once formidable \ninstruments of mayhem, I realized they had become weak and atrophied by too\nmany sedentary hours tapping away at my ergonomically-correct CRT keyboard.\nThere was only one option left: I reached down to the toolbox near my\ncar and grasped my Craftsman 150 ft-lb torque wrench, surely the bludgeon\nof dire necessity if ever there was one.  To my amazement and\nconfusion, the setter started shaking and rolling on the grass, then leapt\nto its feet and vanished down the street, still quivering and occasionally \nlooking back at me.  \n\n"Seven at One Blow!" I exclaimed, flexing my new-found biceps and brandishing\nmy Terrible Weapon of Invincibility as I stalked the now-secure environs\nof my domicile.  It was only later that I found out what the dog apparently\nknew all along: the wrench was defective, would no longer measure torque\naccurately, and Sears wouldn't fix it or replace it.  What I had interpreted\nas fear and subservience were in fact unmitigated hilarity and contempt.\n\n\nExactly: nobody can look quite as silly as we can.
Good advice.\n\n	My Ol'lady taps me on the shoulder to let me know she is \n	uncomfortable.  I, in turn, am prepared for her to move about on the \n	back of the bike.\n\n	We had 1 bad crash (nail in rear tire on left hand sweeper at crest \n	of hill on pavement/pea-gravel road) and her actions helped lessen \n	the severity of it.  As we were crashing, she stayed upright in the \n	saddle with her feet on the pegs and her hands about my waist.  I was\n	able to get the bike slowed down 10-15mph before we were high-sided.\n	She got off with a fair case of road rash and I had to have the doc \n	remove a lot of rocks from my knee.  Had she panicked we would have \n	probably crashed at greater speed causing greater injury.\n	BTW, as soon at the tire went flat, we went into VIOLENT tank-\n	slappers.  This is what she rode out in a "normal" riding posture!\n\n ----===== DoD #8177 = Technician(Dr. Speed) .NOT. Student =====----
Just one little thing. Last year, mid-december, a cop pulled me over. It \nwas about -10 Centigrade, and it just started snowing (O.K. you are right, I \nlive in Canada). The cop checked my license, insurance, ownership, looked at \nmy frozen nose and fingers, told me to watch the speed limit more closely, \nand, entering his cruiser, told me, I was doing 68 instead of 50 km/h. \nDidn't ticket me, and I REALLY slowed down after that ( I already mentioned \nit started to snow. )\n\n        Safe riding, Stefan.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have a 1974 Honda CB360T which for most of my purposes runs well. \nHowever I expereince a severe power drop at cruising speeds under load. \nThat is, on a mild upgrade @ 50 mph in 4th or 5th I'm lucky if I can\nhold speed.  If I try to add throttle much past 5000 rpm, power drops\ndrastically.  Put simply, under load, the engine won't rev past 5000\nrpm.  The top third/half of the throttle range is dead.  Standing still\nthe engine runs fine up to red line (9-10K).\n\nOther phenomenology: at about the point that power loss kicks in, the\nengine becomes a little wavery.  That is, at a steady throttle the\nengine speed goes up and down slightly.  The bike has about 13000 miles\non it and is in good tune, at least until it starts to balk.\n\nI would appreciate any suggestions as to what's ailing the poor beast. \nMy thoughts run toward clogged jets and/or improper spark advance.  I'm\nhoping it's not something more drastic since the bike's not really worth\nthe hassle of any major engine work.\n\n                                        Thanks,
Well, as many a bored bike tourer can tell you, the way to steer\nsans hans is to push your body off to the side you want to lean.\nSay you want to turn left.  You push your body off to the left.\nTo do this, you have to push against something, and the only\nthing to push against is the ground (through the bike).  Well,\nthe apple guy (Wozniak? or was that Churchill?) says that the \nground will push you right back.  So, you pushed yourself off to \nthe left by pushing on the ground to the right, and the ground \npushed back toward the left.  Well, that push is on both wheels.  \nThe rear wheel doesn't care (unless you have serious bearing \nproblems) (except of course on the Spagthorpe Dragonfly, which\nhad the revolutionary countersteering-contra-shaft-drive rear end), \nbut the front wheel has trail.  If the ground pushes the front wheel \ntoward the left at the contact patch, the trail will cause the \nwheel to turn to the right.  Hey, there we are.  No-hands counter-\nsteering.
Now, while I wouldn't recommend doing this while moving,\n\n(Maybe Mike Beaverton can complain to you awhile! :/ )\n\nyou might not want to countersteer if you're just sitting\nin the driveway...\n\n<sounds of Rick falling off bike, muttering, "Damn, coulda\nsworn that's how they told me in the MSF course!!?" >
No, it is the stock setup.  Someone really ought to put an end\n	to the confusion regarding BMW's chain drive boxers.  Didn't\n	someone post the FAQ on this some time ago?  In essence, it\n	describes the problem BMW is having with their decision to\n	settle down to a shaft drive as a standard.  They vacilate\n	and persist in reintroducing the chain drive in various\n	models.  (R/C)  Gosh.  Well, on with the crusade!
------------\n\nShaft: Bamboozle, beat, beguile, burn (or flame), deceive, hoax,\n       hoodwink.\n\nDrive: Campaign, crusade, push.\n\nSo, 'shaft drive' may be a campaign to decieve or a crusade of beguile,\nefforts where are true to the spirit of this list.\n\nWheel: revolution, swing\n\nCrusaders of beguile are innefective in revolutions and they cannot\nswing, either, therefore shaft drives cannot do wheelies.

In that case, the trite & boring\nthreshold tends to drift away from where you first set it, as yours will,\neventually (or not).\n\n\nUntil you can yank the flame out of Blaine's Internet Port before he\ncan io_close() it, you are in no position to lecture him, grasshopper.\n\n\nOh please (yawn), you're slipping further down the scale with each\nsuccessive attempt.

Unable to stand the pain anymore, my wife bought the Corbin Gunfighter\nand Lady with Passenger Backrest for my Hawk GT.\n\nIt came with no instructions, but it came 2 weeks earlier than they\nsaid it would.  Installation would have been very easy, but the seat\nfastening hardware was apparently always on the wrong sides with\nthe stock seat!  It never was easy to put on.  Once I figured that\nout, the new seat went on the first try.  The passenger backrest, though,\ndoes not fit as I thought it might.  The supplied screw to set the \nbackrest angle does not fit, and I have not yet found a suitable, \nhard, ( SAE grade 8, or perhaps 5 ) 1/4-20 bolt that fits.  There is a\na soft bolt in there now -- just don't lean back.\n\nThe driver's section of the seat is a bit wider.  Seems comfortable\nenough, but then again I put about 5000 miles on the stock seat\nwithout a thought.  The passenger's section has about 8 times the \nvolume of foam that the stock seat has, and from my short test it\nseems much more comfortable.  The backrest helps a bit, but I've not \nhas enough time to really test it.  The backrest also comes with a \nsmall pocket.  Its now more difficult to swing my leg up over the \n10" taller seat.\n\nIf I go on the three-notch ride soon ( Dixville, Pinkham & Smugglers),\nI'll give a more complete report, but in general it seems like an\nimprovement.
On a related note (since UPS lost my Chain Wax and I'm still using PJ-1/Goo),\nI found some great stuff to clean chain spooge of wheels.  It's called\nGoo Gone and cleaned the spooge off my rear wheel faster than the Simple\nGreen cleaned the bug guts off my headlight.  Wonderful stuff.  I recommend\nthat we officially delcare it a DoD Wonder Spooge (tm) product.
Yeah, it's impossible to be a tough biker when a 5 year old\nstarts waving at you.

I think the only thing to watch for is the number of attachment\nstraps.  Most come with 3 and some with 4, I have a Bagman 4 strap\ntankbag and because the rear of the tank is so narrow the fit\nis not optimal.
Well... all the way through a decreasing-radius corner, anyway...\n\n\nOK (but I'm right!)  :^)\n\n\nIf that's the "official line" taught in those rider education classes\nyou were refering to, that also don't teach countersteering, I have to\nquestion the quality of the classes.  The "official line" in MSF\ncurricula is as I described.  Maximum braking is achieved by applying\nboth brakes equally, when the weight distribution is nominally even and\nboth tires have equal normal forces, and easing off on the rear to\nprevent locking it, and increasing braking on the front, as more\ntraction is available to the front due to increased normal force due to\nweight shift.\n\nThe "official line" you have been taught seems ineffective on the face\nof it.  Applying the rear brake after the front is not taking advantage\nof all the traction available to the rear at time 0, and is halving the\navailable braking power by using only the front at time 0.\n\n\nNot necessarily true.  "Chirping" the tire indicates impending lockup\n(on most surfaces), and serves as a good guide to newbies to indicate\nmaximum braking.  I agree that totally locking the front occasionally\nmakes one a better rider, but it is a manuver best saved for an\nexperienced rider, unless you have one of those outrigger bikes like\nCode used to use.\n\n\nTrue, but from the point of view of how to best *teach* riding skills\n(which is how this discussion started), "keep both wheels just on the\npoint of sliding" is nearly useless information.  You need to teach a\n*technique*, or at least a strategy, to achieve this.

Doesn't sound like they attended, though, does it?  In fact, if we riders\nneed friends, it sounds a lot like we might have a whole townfull from \nLynn's description, especially if the same crowd gets invited back\nto party some more year after year.\n\n\nYou seem to be one of very few bent out of shape over these "lesser\nindiscretions".  If the towns-people aren't ruffled by the\n"indiscretions" and the partyers aren't either, maybe the "indiscretions"\ndon't amount to anything more threatening or damaging than harmless \ngood-natured rowdiness among consenting adults.  The only thing that \nreally bothered me about the description was the knee-deep empty beer cans \nin the street, but maybe the town had a plan to deal with that since they \nhelped set up the party in the first place.  If I lived there and the\nbikers' previous visits had established a record of mutual cooperation\nand good intentions, I'd certainly rather they stick around and party\nthan go riding off into the night impaired and maybe get hurt or killed.\n\n\nIf it doesn't hurt anyone, and all the parties to the party benefit\nand consider the entire activity to be benign and harmless, then who \nneeds to "permit" or "justify" it?  You?  Why do *you* need to do that?\n\n\nIronically, these particular townsfolk probably are in the minority that\ndon't happen to fit the stereotype you describe.

Well, apparently once you get past about 6 inches, all the luggage shifts back in the panniers, the passenger slides back, and the dog ends up hanging onto the top rack,\nand they go all the way over until it's flat on it's ass, with the front wheel\nstraight up in the sky.

My experience is when they pound their fists on your back it means "slow down".\n\nSeriously, concentrate on being very smooth, and you will make her\nexperience much more enjoyable.  Even a normal upshift causes your\npassenger to bob, so I ease off the throttle before pulling in the\nclutch to eliminate this.  It's more work, but your passenger will\nappreciate it!  Also, I've found that using more rear brake than normal\nhelps keep the bike from diving as much during routine stops, which\nmakes it much easier for the passenger to hang on.  If you're going\nsport riding, have the passenger reach around you and brace themselves\nagainst the tank so you don't have to bear both your weights with your\narms.  (Again your bike will dive less too)

I got a sample of black reflector material, maybe from "Conspicuity"?\nIt is black but reflects silver if the angle of incidence is shallow.\nWhoever it was I got it from sold/sells kits that fit BMW (and other\nbrands?) of luggage and fenders. Don't know what I did with the sample;\nthe kits seemed too expensive, as I recall.

Yep! I did one yesterday on my shaftie Vision... I should mention  \nthat I had a pillon that helped rotate the bike over :-) .

I think you just answered your own question...
;    I am a serious motorcycle enthusiast without a motorcycle, and to\n;put it bluntly, it sucks.  I really would like some advice on what would\n;be a good starter bike for me.  I do know one thing however, I need to\n;make my first bike a good one, because buying a second any time soon is\n;out of the question.  I am specifically interested in racing bikes, (CBR\n;600 F2, GSX-R 750).  I know that this may sound kind of crazy\n;considering that I've never had a bike before, but I am responsible, a\n;fast learner, and in love.  \n\nResponsible and in love?  I believe that's a contradiction\nin terms.\n\nUnless you're really brave (read: "reckless") a 500cc sport\nbike will go way faster than you dare for at least your first\nyear of riding.  Getting more than that really is overkill,\nas you'll never even want to use it.  The following bikes\ncan be bought (and repaired!) cheaply, are easy for a novice\nto manage, and are plenty high performance:\n    Kawasaki EX-500\n    Honda VF-500 "Interceptor"\n    Suzuki GS-550E\n\nThe 0-100mph time of the EX-500 at full throttle is "way\nsooner than you're ready for it".  :-)  With something\nas small as a 250, you'd probably be wishing for more\npower pretty quickly (unless it's a TZR or RGV :).\n\nNow, I'm not saying that you're 100% certain to kill\nyourself immediately with a 600f2 or a GSXR-750.  Plenty\nof people have started riding on those bikes and done\njust fine.  What I am saying is that it's a waste of\nmoney, and a waste of perfectly good plastic when you\ndrop the thing learning how to balance while stopping.\nYou'll never get the throttle more than half open\nanyway, so why spend the extra 2000 bucks?

My first encounter with a dog chasing after my bike was on my first poker run.\nA big german shepard ran out into the pack of bikes I was riding with and tried \nto bite the right leg of the guy riding in front of me. He kicked the dog a \ncouple of times (we were all only going about 10-15mph) and just made the dog\nangrier and got away by applying WFO and outrunning the dog who then started\nafter yours truly. At the time, I had open drag pipes (obnoxiously loud as hell)\nand as soon as the dog was about 2 feet away from the right side of my bike, I\npulled in the clutch and revved the motor up to about 5000rpm and the roar of\nthe pipes frightened the dog away (probably made the dog's ears hurt like hell)\nand he didn't come back for the rest of the bikers behind me either. \n\nMy second encounter was with an already deceased road-kill dog. I wasn't paying \nvery close attention to the pavement when the car in front of me straddled the\ncarcass. I looked down just in time to see what I was about to run over so I \njust held onto the handlebars and freaked out. Both wheels went squarely over\nthe dog's belly with a thump-thump just like running over a piece of a 4x4\nlumber. The bike didn't lose any stability at all and I kept on going. After\nI got to my destination, I found bits of fur, meat, and blood stuck to\nthe bottom of my motor and frame...... gross.

Glad to hear that the bozo managed to stop.  I've only been riding for\nabout two years, but here are my rules for traffic light survival:\n\n     - I try to *never* stop just over a hill behind a car.  If I have\n       to stop in such a location, I pull almost completely next to the\n       car in front of me.  If I'm the only one (ie no car in front), I\n       turn the bike somewhat sideways across the lane, to increase my\n       visibility to any oncoming vehicle.  Make sure to keep your\n       taillight visible to traffic, though. (NOTE:  My bike is bright\n       white; turning sideways on a black bike might not be as beneficial.)\n\n     - On a flat road, I stop with a bit of room ahead of me (usually\n       about two or three bike lengths).  This will (hopefully) give\n       me room to pull forward and to the side as a car approaches.\n\n     - If you are the last in a line of vehicles, watch your mirrors\n       *constantly!*  If you see a vehicle approaching, and can't see\n       any evidence to indicate that he/she is slowing down, get out\n       of the way *now!*\n\n     - Flicker your brake light.  If I'm the last vehicle in line, I\n       will pull and release the brake as a car approaches from\n       behind (noticed the car by watching my mirrors, of course :-).\n       I vary the speed of the flicker, hoping to make the cager notice\n       that there's something in the lane ahead of him.\n\nNow, with all that said, it's the situation where you are first in line\nthat I feel most defenseless.  If you're first in line, your forward escape\nroute is seriously limited - you can only move forward to the extent that\nyou don't enter the intersection.  I leave some room behind the stop line\n(although around here, the #@$*! light activators are always right up \nnext to the stop line!), and watch the mirrors.  I *think* I've decided\nthat hopping off the bike might be the best way out of this situation.\nAny other ideas for being first in line with no traffic directly behind\nyou?\n\n-rob.

i saw this posted and it brings an interesting event to mind .....\n\n\n\na few weeks ago i was in the DMV with ken. i was standing in a mile long \nline waiting for some really bored looking person to fleece a bunch of \npeople from some dough. ken was sitting on a chair next to our helmets \nwondering why everybody there looked to be about the social calibur of \npeople you would find at a laundromat when some young woman walked in who \nrequired our conferring attentions. he came over and stood in line with me \nwhile we watched her fill out some forms and then we noticed a little kid \nabout 4 years old reach over the bench and touch our helmets, one at a time. \ni didn't particularly mind, and neither did ken (that the kid was touching \nour helmets that is). but the helmets weren't on the most stable of \nplatforms, so ken scooted over there to resettle them and as soon as he \ntouched the helmets, mother of said child started shrieking at her kid "YOU \nSTAY AWAY FROM THOSE YOU SHIT!" and whopped the tyke brutally about the head \nand shoulders.

One of my brothers had spent a lot of time practicing bizzare tricks on\nhis megabuck/micromass bike. He said he once repelled a dog attack by\npicking up the rear of the bike and smacking the dog in the side of the\nhead with the rear wheel. The dog had _no_ idea what hit him, and he\nfled quite rapidly. Then again, he could jump garbage cans without a\nramp, so I don't think I'd care to try this one on a motorcycle.\n\n\nThat's almost unfair, I've never seen a dog that could use a phone. :-)

Be careful that you do not have any weight of the helmet resting on the\nmirror.  It will depress the foam liner in the helmet.  That is not the\nkind of foam that bounces back, like foam rubber.  Its purpose in life\nis to absorb energy in an impact as it is compressed by your noggin.\nIf your mirror compresses it, there is that much less energy absorbing\ncapacity left to cushon your noggin in a crash.\n\nI found the right handlebar to be a good spot, if on the sidestand.\nHang with the chinbar facing up, balanced across the grip and brake\nlever such that the weight of the helmet doesn't compress any of the\nchinbar foam.  This is more challanging with an open face helmet.

We're NOT???! Hell, I was wondering why there was all the pointless woffle \nabout motorcycles.
A few months ago, in one the the motorcycle mags, there was\nan article that mentioned reflector tape that was supposed to\nbe available thru BMW.  The idea was that the tape would look\nblack in sunlight, and reflect in other colors at night to\nheadlights.  It sounded like a nice way to add nighttime \nvisibility without turning the bike into a carnival attraction.\n\nI talked to the local BMW dealer about this.  I was told that the \nonly thing he had heard about this kind of reflector, was it being \nused in a coming line of BMW clothing (rainsuits).  He wasn't aware \nof anything regarding self applied tape.\n\nHas anyone come across this from BMW or any other source?\n\nThanks,

Hello Folks,\n\nI'm very happy with my "new" R80GS.  My range is 238 miles on 4.8 gallons...\nthat's 50 mpg!!  Surprisingly, the bike is a real cruiser.  I was expecting\nsomething rough.   She's a sweet backroad honey.  And I can go pretty much\nanyplace I'd take my mountain bike.  As far as shaft effect, it's more a \ntorque effect from the crankshaft in my opinion.  Rev it sitting still\n(when the driveshaft is not moving) and the bike twists a bit.  Maybe\nI don't ride her fast enough to get a shaft effect, but in my opinion\na little buffeting by wind is of far greater consequence.  Okay, here are \nmy questions:\n\n1) Any recommendations for a home-made fairing?  I'd like to keep the\nwind off my chest, and perhaps my helmet, for comfort at highway speeds\n(70 mph), yet don't want to (a) screw up the stability or (b) block my\nvision too much for trail riding.  Anybody have luck with two-piece \ndetachible fairings?  I'd like to make it myself out of plexiglas.\n\n2) I run two lights, the standard headlamp plus a sidelamp mounted on the\ncrash bar.  The illumination's excellent that way, with a full beam coming\nout from the level of the motor (left side); the lamp beam is linear so\nthat you get a bright streak of illumination from left to right, and it \nreally picks up the periphery (deer lurking, etc.)  Combined with the \nheadlamp on high you can see like day.  But I've heard that BMW alternators\ndon't crank out too much.  Do I need to shut down the sidelamp when I'm\nputtering around in the dirt at low RPM?  \n\n3) This is embarassing: I'm having trouble starting the bike first thing\nin the morning.  I invariably flood the carbs, then go in and read a section\nof the paper, and then she starts right up.  Is this a Zen thing? \n\n4) The Hayne's manual says do not under any circumstances use gasoline\nwith alcohol additives... Yeah, right.  What do you folks due to keep\nthe engine and carbs from being eaten by ethanol and methanol?  Any \nparticular brands of gas that are best?  Additives?\n\nThanks,
Oh, Bill, you are so full of shit.  That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.\n\n\n\n\nObMOTO:  I happened to miss the discussion of deltabox frames, if there was\none, because I actually needed to get some work done last week.

An even better strategy is to leave less of a buffer between you and\nthe car in front, but enough to manuver around it.  Keep the bike in\n1st gear with the clutch handle squeezed in (how's that for\nengaged/disengaged?), until there are two cars stopped behind you.\n\nWhen the next BDI cager comes screaching in, simply ride up along side\nof the car in front of you.  You don't need to panic and do it, or you\nwill pop the clutch and stall the engine.  Do is smoothly, just\nrapidly.  The cage in front of you will provide MUCH better protection\nthan anything else (particularly empty road).
David Gibbs replies:\n\nI guess I was semi-serious. Without using my hands, I lean and the bike \nturns. When leaning, a torque is applied, at a 90deg angle to the front \nwheel's axle, just as in countersteering. However, this torque is also about \n90deg from the axis of the steering head. Instead of making the \nbike lean, gyroscopic effect makes the bars turn, but I don't remember \nwhich way.\n\n-Rick\n\nOh yeah, I tried this in the driveway, on the centestand,(as suggested \nsomewhere else) but it doesn't seem to work the same.

Spring break, I went through the four corners area and back.  The most\nbeautiful stop I made was in Utah at the Needles Overlook.  Though this\nis a bit further east than where you appear to be going, I highly\nrecommend it.  IMHO it is far more beautiful than the Grand Canyon.  It\nwas not well marked, but was one of few paved roads off of US191 (I was\nheading north from Monticello).  In order to get to the right place, I\nshould clarify that it is the Needles OVERLOOK, and not the recreation\narea.  Heading north from Monticello, it is the second turnoff, and may\nhave been marked as the Anticline Overlook.  Anticline overlook is\nabout 20 (dirt, if this matters to you) miles past the Needles\noverlook.  The road out to the overlook is paved and reasonably\nmaintained (I ran it about 70mph).\n\nLooking out from the overlook was like being God and looking down on \nthe world.  If it isn't too far out of your way, you should see it.

Last weekend I did a 500 mile round-trip and\ngot to a point where it was in the 30s and raining.  Those heated\ngrips were *great*.  I've only had the bike a month and the heated\ngrips are already one of my favorite features on the bike.
You might try the rec.models.rockets newsgroup.  Interesting stuff,\nsome of it should probably be classified as artillery.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So, you'd sell your bike, and let her\nride around while you have to stay home with\nthe kids?\n\nGeez, that's a tough choice.
Quite right, your batteries should be perfectly alright and retain\nmost of their charge if drained and dried well, but I'd throw out the\nelectrolyte and buy some more when you need it.\n\n\n     And before anyone says I'm wrong, remember that new batteries almost\nalways come ready charged and dry, and they are perfectly OK even after\nseveral years' storage at the shop.
Spray the chain wax onto the rollers and sideplates occassionally, and\nrust will not be a problem.\n\nLater,
I just installed a MC Power Arc II, and it seems to run great. I also\nused MC coils, and neither the ignition module or the coils required\nany new mounting holes to be drilled on my 92 FXSTC. A little soldering\nand all was fine. Static timing was real easy to set too. \n\nOn the other side of the coin, my local wrench, whose opinion I\ninvariably seek but don't always adopt, thinks MC Power Arc is a "piece\nof shit" and says "all them Jap chips are gonna fail you one day". \nNeedless to say, he doesn't like any electronic ignition modules, and\nrecommends the Dyna-S system. I think that's the one with the\nHall-effect timing sensor(s), correct?

I know there's already a bmw mailing list, but since it's an R bike \nonly list (and limited to the R80* R100* bikes as well I believe)\nI've decided to give this a go and see how much interest there is.\nplease read all of this post if you plan on subscribing to the list!\n\nthere is only one restriction for the discussion on this list, that it\nbe about BMW's. I don't care which BMW, any and all are welcome. I will\nprobably post articles that appear in the local BMW club newsletter, and\nwould incourage other club members to do the same, especially tech\narticles.\n\nto subscribe to the list, send a message to the list address:\n\n                    bmw@rider.cactus.org\n\nwith the word SUBSCRIBE (in caps) in the *subject* of the message. having\nthe word SUBSCRIBE in the *subject* is the _only_ way to subscribe. if you \nput the keyword in the message body, your message will go out to everyone\non the list and you will be ridiculed beyond belief.\n\n       ** your From: line must have a valid return address    **\n       ** the list sw will use the address in your From: line **\n\nif you would like to use a return address _other_ than what is contained\nin your From: line, do not send mail to the list! send a note directly to\nme (joe@rider.cactus.org) and I'll take care of it manually.\n\nthe list sw will hack up the outgoing message From: line so that your\noriginal full name in ()'s is preserved, but the return address is\nreplaced with the mailing list address (bmw@rider.cactus.org). this \nallows you to simply reply to a message to keep it on the list (depending\non your mail interface natch. I use elm so that's what I wrote it for :-).\nkeep this in mind when you reply to a message and question the authors\nparentage.\n\nto remove your name from the list, send a message to the list address\nwith the word UNSUBSCRIBE (in caps) in the *subject* of the message.\nhaving the word UNSUBSCRIBE in the *subject* is the _only_ way to remove\nyour name from the list. if you put the keyword in the message body, \nyour message will go out to everyone on the list and you will be ridiculed \nbeyond belief.\n\nthe list is run from my home system, a poor little 286 box running a\nvery old version of something that smells somewhat like unix. the MTA\nisn't the smartest around, but I've managed to hack it up enough to make\na decent list MTA. additions and removals are handled automatically by\nscripts that intercept messages based on the subject (see below) and\nmay occassionally goof. the sw will send a response message back when you\nsubscribe. if you do not receive a response within a reasonable amount\nof time (my link is via UUCP and sometimes runs in spurts), send me a \nmessage (joe@rider.cactus.org) and I'll look into it.\n\nif the list turns out to be too popular and the MTA groks over the number\nof addresses, I'll have to freeze the list recipients until I can come up\nwith a better MTA.\n\ngood luck...
Oooo,I hope it's nothing like I had on my Seca turbo.\nI had locked up the back wheel and forgot about it.\nWhen I took off I heard a 'clunk', but I just drove away\nleaving the lock broken on the ground.  Real security\nin action.
I don't think Michael's response was anti-party but rather pro-environmental.\nI agree that you gotta let us Hogs out to roam every once in awhile.  Let's\nhope that next year Oatman will be better prepared and that we all pick up\nafter ourselves.\n\n\nWell, I for one thought you told a good story, even if you say you are an\na**hole!:-) We need more biker experiances written to news.  It's unfortunate\nthat you got flamed for telling it, but we all know this is a controversial\ngroup.\n\nAt any rate, keep up the good work and continue to post stories.
& \n& If this is the same as adjusting the shims between cam and valve, I have\n& the same question.  Do you buy a FULL set of shims before starting the\n& adjustment process, or do you calculate the shims you need and then run\n& off to the dealer in the cage to see if the right shims are in stock? \n& Obviously the latter would be cheaper (what do shims cost?), but are\n& measurements of the shim need reliable enough to buy only the indicated shims?\n\nOnly buy what you need.  It would cost a lot to buy a full set, and\nyou won't ever use most of them.  I have had good luck with the\ncalculation method.  I have never had to change more than one size\nincrement at a time (I never needed a change larger than the next\nsize up/down, usually down).  They cost a few $ each for a Yamaha.

Another F2 rider had similiar problems, and this is the mail I sent him,\nhope this helps resolve you problem!\n\nAT\n\n\nGood point, did not catch this in the original post. The only other things \nwhich come to mind, since this is a gravity feed fuel system, is this.\nThe fuel petcock valve is vacuum controlled from the #1 carburator. Let\nsuppose there is a small hole or bad seal either in the hose itself or the\nvacuum valve in the fuel petcock. When it is cold, the hole is open enough\nto open the valve just enough to allow gas to the carbs with the choke on, \nsince the choke creates more low pressure in the carbs when on to draw gas, \nand as the engine and surrounding area warm up, the hole seals up. \n\nOne way to check fuel flow through the valve would be to pull the side \npanels off and remove the fuel hose to the carbs. Connect a tube of the \ncorrect size, preferably clear tubing to observe fuel flow, on the output\nside of the fuel petcock. Remove the control hose from #1 carburator. Make\nsure the tank is full. Place the valve in the ON position and apply vacuum \nto the control hose, preferably with a vacuum device with a gauge, to check \nfor air leaks. With vacuum applied, fuel should flow freely. To see if there is\na vent problem, do this with the fuel filler cap open and closed, if it \nflows a lot faster with the filler cap open, then there may be something in \nthe vent airway which changes position and depending on the position may clog \nor partially clog the vent. I have heard of some F2 fuel tanks being replaced \nto fix this problem. So the things which might be defective are, the control\nhose from #1 carb, the petcock valve, and possibly the fuel tank vent.\n\nNow if all of the above shows no problem of fuel flow when cold, then there \nis something in the carbs screwed up, but there are so many things to check, \nI would be typing all day to list them all! \n\nHere are a few, with everything back together, apply vacuum to the petcock valve\nand open the drain holes on the carbs one by one to check fuel flow. Open up the\nairbox and check for foreign debris or clogged airways on the carbs, there are\nquite a few on each carb.\n\nI hope something is flushed out with all this trouble shooting. If American\nHonda does not resolve this, get MAD AS HELL and report them to the BBB and\ncall the Honda Customer Service HOTLINE. It is a 800 number, but I don't recall\nit off the top of my head. I called just about tires for my F2 and a few days\nlater a customer satisfaction inquiry card arrived at home asking how I liked\nthe support I received, here would be your chance to tell them what you think!

Handlebar mounted windshields on windy days are no fun at all.  It has been \nwindy as hell down here for a week or so and it plays hell with the steering.\nOh, I still ride.  I just bitch a lot about it!\n\n ----===== DoD #8177 = Technician(Dr. Speed) .NOT. Student =====----
