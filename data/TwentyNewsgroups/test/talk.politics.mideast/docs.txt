^^^^^^^^\n	Oh my god. My spelling and grammer suck. I guess I need some\nsleep. I said righting (instead of writing). What's the chance\nof that. Thank god I caught it before everyone started picking\non it. I hope I didn't cause Mr.Jefferson too much shame.
The above explained propaganda which certainly has nothing to do with \nthe true facts is also today the main source of ASALA/SDPA/ARF terrorists'\nillegal activities that still try to make money out of the bodies of \nthe innocent victims of the Turkish genocide.\n\nThe criminal acts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government come directly\nunder the scope of the Convention on Genocide adopted by the General \nAssembly of the United Nations on December 8, 1948, containing the \nfollowing provisions:\n\nThe Contracting Parties, having considered the declaration made \nby the General Assembly of the United Nations in its Resolution\n95 (1) dated December 11, 1946, that genocide is a crime under\ninternational law, contrary to the spirit and aims of the United\nNations and condemned by the civilized world;\n\nRecognizing that in all periods of history genocide has inflicted\ngreat losses on humanity; and\n\nBeing convinced that, in order to liberate mankind from such odious\nscourge, international cooperation is required;\n\nMembers agree as hereinafter provided:\n\nArticle 1. The Contracting Parties confirm that genocide, whether\ncommitted in time of peace or in time of war, is a crime under \ninternational law which they undertake to prevent and to punish.\n\nArticle 2. In the present Convention genocide means any of the\nfollowing acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or\nin part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as \nsuch:\n\nA) Killing member of the group;\nB) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;\nC) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life \n   calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole \n   or in part;\nD) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;\nE) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group;\n\nArticle 3. The following acts shall be punishable:\n\na) Genocide\nb) Conspiracy to commit genocide\nc) Direct and public incitement to commit genocide\nd) Attempt to commit genocide.\n\nArticle 4. Persons committing genocide or any of the other acts\nenumerated in Article 3 shall be punished, whether they are\nconstitutionally responsible rulers, public officials or private\nindividuals.\n\nHad the Convention on Genocide existed before the Armenian \nmassacres of the Turks and Kurds, it would probably have been \ndifficult for the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its responsibles\nto start murdering of civilian, defenseless, faithful Ottoman\ncitizens, children and women, (GENOCIDE AND ATTEMPT TO GENOCIDE),\nto make plans to exterminate, as they have done also to Urartus\nand Jews, faithful Ottoman citizens (CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT GENOCIDE), \nto incite Armenians to armed revolt against the legal authority\nand to commit Genocide, (DIRECT AND PUBLIC INCITEMENT TO COMMIT\nGENOCIDE).\n\nSerdar Argic
There were a great many Germans, Poles and others who did not\nsympathize with the victims of the Holocaust but instead participated\nwith enthusiasm in the killing.\n\nThe Holocaust wasn't a massacre, it wasn't even killing for sport; it\nwas an entire Industry of Death.  German engineers, architects\ntechnicians and bureaucrats proudly put their best efforts into as\nefficient and methodical a Killing Machine as they could devise and\noperate.  And it certainly was something extraordinary.\n\nPlease don't bleat to us about how the Nazis suffered from the\nHolocaust.\n\n\n  All Jews suffered during WWII [...]\nwas "correct" him with:\n  All humans suffered [...]\n\nSo what WERE you implying?\n\n\nAre we supposed to thank you for your generosity?  \nOr should we be pleased with your minimal common sense?\n\n\nWhy is it that when someone writes something simple like "All Jews\nsufffered during WWII" that YOU feel the burning need to add\ncommentary?  Regardless of what people write, you keep trying to twist\nthings into what YOU want to hear.  People with similar tendencies in\nmore extreme form are sometimes called Historical Revisionists.  Is\nthis something that you aspire to?
Try coming up with your own definition of any or all "self-hating" peoples.\nTo me, any who reject their culture to the point where they *only* see the\nabsolute negatives of that culture (generally, or regarding a particular\nevent) and accept *only* those views purely opposing aspects of that culture \n(thus, selective belief in and use of historical facts and a complete ignoring\nof "context" results) "hate" their culture. That certainly describes Elias, \nsince he has no intention of recognizing that, alongside the Palestinian\nexperience and perspective, there exists also that of Israelis. \nAnd, this is precisely why Israeli society has been tremendously harmed\nby the actions it (its government) has *felt it had to take* in response\nto an "other" perceived as a threat. Just as with you, there has long \nbeen a strident and emotional debate about the pain Israelis feel when \nforced to "balance" desires for survival and moral beliefs. The trauma\nof having to make that choice is made worse by the fact that neither\ncan be conveniently brushed aside (as a result of a reasoned political\ndebate) for the sake of the other, only reshaped.
You obviously haven't read his postings clearly.\n\n\nIsraelophiles?  Is this anything like Israelists?  You're treading on\nthin ice here.\n\n\nNow, you're falling through the ice.  Barfie!  We have a playmate for\nyou! \n\n\nThere is a difference between guerrilla warfare and terrorism.\nThe former primarily targets enemy soldiers.  The latter primarily\ntargets civilians, and not necessarily enemy civilans, at that.\n\n\nInnocent British soldiers?  Like innocent Iraqi soldiers?\nTHe British were EXECUTING Jewish fighters in what was soon to become\nthe recognized Jewish homeland.  The British - to their eternal shame\nand damnation - were sending shiploads of Jewish refugees, civilians,\nback to Europe to be taken care of by Hitler.\n\nBy comparison, Palestinean "fighters" primarily target tourists,\nschoolchildren, babies, worshippers, shoppers, movie-goers and other\nsuch threatening people.  Early Zionist fighters did no such things.\n\nYour comparison is ignorant and odious.\n\n\nDoes it bug you that the "Israelites" (they used to be\nIsraelophiles...) happen to be right?\n\n\nAre you kidding?  Palestinean Arabs - who comprise a tiny proportion \nof the world's refugee population, who have almost no justifiable\nclaim to the territory that they desire, who have acted as criminals\nin the international community for decades - are being treated like\nthe most aggrieved and deserving minority in existence, even after\ntheir ignominious support for Saddam in Desert Storm.  How many other\nworld "leaders" have addressed the UN with a machine-gun in hand,\nreceiving a standing ovation?\n\n\nYou are now parrotting some of the weakest arguments of the\nterrorists' apologists.  Congratulations.\n\n\nGee, that's a nice name.  Can I call you Pissed?
Not according to reports I have read. It seems that the Somalis think\nof our African American Marines in less than complimentary terms, using\ngestures that signify a word I refuse to use. Seems that even when you\ntry to help people, they still insult you.
Yeah!  That's it! :)  You've really outdone yourself this time Nick...\nDon't forget the "Davidian Muslims"... :)\n\nIslam is not a race.  It's a religion.  You can be white, black,\nFijian or Alaskan.  I guess you didn't absorb too much of the Malcolm\nX interest circulating.  You see, the whole point of Islam is that it\nstresses equality amongst all peoples.  Now, I do realize this is\ndifficult for you to comprehend given your staunch beliefs in Serbian\nethnic cleansing, but give it a try, it's really not that difficult.\n\n\nThat's right, it's a Disneyland war -- all a setup for the TV cameras.\nThere are also people who believe man never landed on the moon, that\nthe whole Apollo story was done in TV studios...\n\n\nTerms of secession?  You are, of course, joking, right Nick?  Nobody\n*chose* to fight.  Bosnia and Croatia were *internationally*\nrecognized nations when the Serbs attacked and started on their\nwell-documented genocide.  That makes them an outside aggressor.  It's\na simple genocide, a classical example of ethnic cleansing.  There is\nno question of civil war...
Lovely arguments.  But do we write about historical ownership of any\nplace - Palestine, Pakistan, Cyprus, Aegean Islands (and the oil that\nmay lie beneath them), whatever - for any reason other than\njustification for stomping others?\n\nDOES IT TRULY MATTER whose ancestor lived where 20, 200, or 2000 years\nago?  More than how you treat the land and each other?\n\nWho is wise enough to decree that a person's right to life, liberty\nand pursuit of happiness in a particular place depends on accidents of\nbirth?  Who can even be sure about the precise tracks of the sperm\nthat birthed the people we wish to despise?\n\nIMHO, the American Indians have it right.  We belong to the earth, it\ndoes not belong to us.  Failure to understand that is a good way to\ncause lossage all the way around.  My guess is that once we trash our\nenvironment sufficiently we shall die along with it - the baby eating\nand killing its mother, then dying for lack of milk.\n\nDeath and disease do not respect national boundaries, not as toxins,\ndisease vectors,  lost farmland/wetlands/forest cover/water supplies,\nnor any other way.  When we fight over which national group owns which\npiece of turf, we are merely contending for the best vantage point\nfrom which to kill others, "our" land and eventually ourselves.\n\nThat is something of which to be proud.  Very proud.  Makes me glad to\nbe human.\n\n\nI'm not mindlessly rejecting all nationalism.  Maybe it's fair to ask\nwhether a recent immigrant deserves a share of the infrastructure that\nall _my_ ancestors (hah!) labored to produce.  But it's an artificial\ndistinction: is the recent immigrant, even a refugee, less likely to\ncontribute to the next generation's legacy than anyone else?  [In\nhistory the reverse is often the case: recent immigrants strive\nhardest.  If nothing else, they fill open eco(l/n)ogic niches.]\n\nThen again, my tribe is infinitely better than your tribe, so I can\nunderstand you all have nothing but plot to knock me off.  While I, of\ncourse, will make sure it doesn't happen, even if I must shoot Muslim\ninfants (or bash Jewish ones against the walls of schoolhouses) to do\nso.  That'll prove my moral superiority, by golly, as well as the\nrightness of my cause.\n\n\nClearly, there is no higher purpose in life than killing others\nbecause they are not like you.  I would never get in the way of such\nfun.\n\nLet's see:  \n	soc.culture.turkish - Why don't you Turks go back to Lake\n		Baikal where you came from, and leave the land to the\n		Greeks, who stole it fair and square from the\n		Scythians?\n	soc.culture.pakistan - Why don't you guys redistribute\n		yourselves over India, as God meant for you to do?\n	soc.culture.jewish, soc.culture.arabic - we stick together,\n		fight together, die together.  We are brothers, and\n		inseparable.\n	talk.politics.mideast - oh well, had to be there.\n\nOded\n[Planning on being a Scythian irredentist, as soon as I finish my\npresent assignment.]\n\n\nP.S.:	I can't get a semi-decent death threat anymore?

Your ignorance is hardly characteristic of most '*ians'. Sarkis Atamian \nexplains in his book called 'The Armenian Community, New York 1955, \nPhilosophical Library' that, according to historians, original fatherland \nof the Armenians was in Thessaly, Greece. Armenian invaders burned and \nsacked the fatherland of Urartus, massacred and exterminated its population \nand presented to the world all those left from the Urartus, as the Armenian \ncivilization. All reliable western historians describe how Armenians \nruthlessly exterminated 2.5 million Muslim women, children and elderly \npeople of Eastern Anatolia and how they collaborated with the enemies of \nthe Muslim people between 1914-1920. It is unfortunately a truth that \nArmenians are known as collaborators of the Nazis during World War II \nand that, even today, criminal members of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism \nTriangle preach and instigate racism, hatred, violence and terrorism \namong peoples. \n\n\nWho says 'Arromdians' are no damn good? During World War II Armenians \nwere carried away with the German might and cringing and fawning over \nthe Nazis. In that zeal, the Armenian publication in Germany, Hairenik, \ncarried statements as follows:[1]\n\n"Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the Jews)\n when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease, and when it \n becomes necessary for a people (the Nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon\n method, these attempts are regarded as revolutionary. During the surgical\n operation, the flow of blood is a natural thing." \n\nNow for a brief view of the Armenian genocide of the Muslims and Jews -\nextracts from a letter dated December 11, 1983, published in the San\nFrancisco Chronicle, as an answer to a letter that had been published\nin the same journal under the signature of one B. Amarian.\n\n "We have first hand information and evidence of Armenian atrocities\n  against our people (Jews). Members of our family witnessed the \n  murder of 148 members of our family near Erzurum, Turkey, by Armenian \n  neighbors, bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely Jewish \n  and/or Muslim. Armenians should look to their own history and see \n  the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors.\n  Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war, on his premise \n  to grant themselves government if, in return, the Armenians would \n  help exterminate Jews. Armenians were also hearty proponents of\n  the anti-Semitic acts in league with the Russian Communists."\n\n  Signed Elihu Ben Levi, Vacaville, California.\n\n[1] James G.

From Israeline 4/27/93\n\nPeace Talks Resume Today; Israel to Offer Palestinians New\nProposals\n \nIsrael Radio, KOL YISRAEL, reports on today's resumption in\nWashington of the bilateral peace talks, following a recess which\nlasted over four months. According to the report, Israel is\nexpected to offer the Palestinians new proposals regarding the\nauthority of the Palestinian Executive Council, general elections,\ncontrol over land and human rights issues in the Territories.\nIsrael will express its readiness to give the Palestinians control\nof more land than previously offered. According to the radio\nreport, one estimate is that Israel will give the Palestinians\ncontrol over as much as two thirds of the administered lands, as\nwell as broad authority on water issues. Israel will seek to\npromote its offer to hold elections in the Territories in hopes of\nstrengthening the position of the Palestinian delegation to the\npeace negotiations. According to Israel Radio, the Israeli\ndelegation to the bilateral talks with the Palestinians will offer\ngreater responsibilities to the Palestinian Executive Council\nallowing it certain legislative capabilities, without making it a\nsymbol for Palestinian sovereignty. U.S. Secretary of State Warren\nChristopher invited all the heads of delegations to a gathering\ntonight. It will be the first such event since the Madrid\nconference. Head of the American team at the bilateral peace talks,\nEdward Djerejian, said that tonight's gathering is meant to\ndemonstrate the U.S.' active role in the peace process.

<YZKCU@CUNYVM.BITNET>\n\nIndeed Yaqouv, just like the ugly hatred spread by Kahane and\nKahanists, right?   Or they are exempt from condemnation, and allowed\nto hate?\n\nNo, fool, not at all like hatred of one's sworn enemies, enemies who\nhave said time and again that they mean to kill you, and have, by mur-\ndering innocent men, women and children, shown that they really mean it.\n\nThe late rabbi never hated anyone merely for having been born into a par-\nticular group, but he (and I) hate and would/will kill anyone who comes\nto kill Jews.

I would like to publicly apologize to our Anisa Aldoubosh\n   for playing :\n****\nWell Anisa I am not sure that I feel the necessary remorse.\nYou and another Muslim lady ( Hanan Ashrawi ) seems to me to\nbe some attempt to charm the west into forgetting what you\nare really saying.\nIt is not that we hate muslims but we hate certain things you\nare saying every now and then. And it is depressing to ponder the \nprospects for peace while those wievs are held by your people.\nNot that we are better then you , we have our own prejudices\nand vices in the West thank you. But your views are really \ndepressing . Thus I have fallen in the temptation to tease\nand make a little fun instead of ....\nand have problems to mobilize the necessary remorse!\n\nBest Regards
What if we remove one zeron and make it "the genocide of two hundred\n        thousands Muslims in Bosnia..", would that make it any better..?\n        And how about the 2,000,000 Muslims who were driven and continue to\n        be driven out of their homes..? is that "utterly ridiculous claim"?\n        And how about the rapes (over 60,000 women) and the concentration \n        camps..? The us delegation which visited them reported yesterday\n        on CNN that the serbs are giving the muslims detainees 4 biscuits\n        and a cup of water a day..!!??\n        That sure also sounds like an "utterly ridiculous claim".!
A typical Nazi/racist Armenian of 'ASALA/SDPA/ARF'. Can it be that\ncriminal/Nazi Armenians of ASALA/SDPA/ARF hate Muslims for ideological \nreasons regardless of what they do? Between 1914 and 1920, your criminal\nArmenian grandparents committed unheard-of crimes, resorted to all \nconceivable methods of despotism, organized massacres, poured petrol \nover babies and burned them, raped women and girls in front of their \nparents who were bound hand and foot, took girls from their mothers \nand fathers and appropriated personal property and real estate. And \ntoday, they put Azeris in the most unbearable conditions any other \nnation had ever known in history.\n                               \n\nSource: The Times, 2 March 1992\n\nCORPSES LITTER HILLS IN KARABAKH\n\nANATOL LIEVEN COMES UNDER FIRE WHILE FLYING WITH AZERBAIJANI FORCES \nTO INVESTIGATE THE MASS KILLINGS OF REFUGEES BY ARMENIAN TROOPS...\n\nAs we swooped low over the snow-covered hills of Nagorno-Karabagh we saw \nthe scattered corpses. Apparently, the refugees had been shot down as \nthey ran. An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over, shown to \njournalists afterwards, showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts \nof the hills.\n\nThe Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING \nof AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly, seized by Armenians \nlast week. A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death \nor missing... \n\nSeven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter \nas we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there \nwas a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer \nripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We \nswung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon \nunder our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.\n\nWe had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round \nagain, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a \nvalley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung \nround again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired \nrepeated blasts.\n\nLater it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting \nhad landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed \nenclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in \nfact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter. \nI had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window, \nits cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on \n"our side". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a \nsearch-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission.\n\nOur flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two \nM24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed \nflying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second \ncrocodile. The civilian helicopter's job was to land in the mountains \nand pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters \nwere there to give covering fire if necessary.\n\nThe operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet \narmed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani \nofficial told us that there were now five former Soviet military \nhelicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. "They have \nsigned contracts to fly for us," he said. The helicopter we engaged \nin combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian \npilot, but fighting for the Armenians.\n\nWe had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an \nheated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer \nwhite wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four \ncorpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an \nAzerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies \non the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back \ntowards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before \nthe plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed.\n\nBack at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the \ncivilian helicopter had picked up. Two old men a small girl were \ncovered with blood, their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor \nmortis. They had been shot.\n\nWhat did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy, our close shave, \nand the war in Nagorno-Karabakh? He gave us CHEERFUL GRIN, POLITELY \nDECLINED TO ANSWER QUES TIONS, AND MARCHED OFF TO HIS DINNER.\n\nSerdar Argic
Not sure.  But the number of Israelis killed defending Israel is a little more\nthan 17,000 in the last 45 years and 61,000 injured.\n\nYou must try to make a mockery out of everything, don't you?  Pathetic.
Bosnian Muslims are citizens od Bosnia-Herzegovina who identify themselves\nwith Bosnian Muslim cultural and religious tradition.\n\n\nIn Bosnia, "Muslim" is not merely a religious category, but an ethnic\none as well.  Actually, here are the two contradictory arguments\nmade by people on this subject:\n\n(1) There is only Serbian and Croatian nationality, and Bosnian Muslims\n    are simply Croats and Serbs of Islamic faith.\n\n(2) Bosnian Muslims are a separate nationality since they do not feel\n    themselves to be Croats nor Serbs.\n\nIn 1968, argument (2) was accepted by former Yugoslavia as valid,\nand (1) was soundly rejected.  The reasons are pragmatic: even if\nBosnian Muslims are Croats and Serbs who converted to Islam under\nTurkish rule centuries ago, none of the present generation has any\nclue what was their ancestor's actual nationality.  In fact, although\nBosnian Muslims have felt drawn to Croatian or Serbian national\nallegiance, most of them feel they have a separate cultural and\nhistoric identity.  So, arguments like "yes, but your ancestors were\nCroats or Serbs" carry very little weight.  Regardless of what\ntheir ancestors might have been, as long as Bosnian Muslims feel\nthat they are a separate national group, that ends the debate.\nWhat outsiders say is simply not relevant.\n\n\nIn the case of former Yugoslavia, the date is 1971, when "Muslim nationality"\nappeared as a census category for the first time.  This was the result\nof a sequence of decisions over the past decade, from recognizing\n"Bosniaks" as an ethnic group (1961) to February 1968 resolution (in B-H)\ndeclaring that Muslims are a separate nation, to formal endorsement \nof this in January 1969, and eventually to the 1971 inclusion of\n"Muslim nationality" choice in census forms.\n\nFor comparison, in 1948 census there were three national categories\navailable to Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina:\n\nSerb-Muslims:                        71,991\nCroat-Muslims:                       25,295\nMuslims, ethnically undeclared:     788,403\n\nThis clearly demonstrates that Muslims feel themselves to be their own\nnationality.  Only a tiny minority felt able to choose Serb or Croat\nnationality.  Census results show that Bosnian Muslims have\nconsistently opted for a third category: in 1948 they chose "undeclared",\nin 1953 they chose "Yugoslavs", in 1961 both "Yugoslavs" and "Bosniak \nethnic group", and in 1971, 1981 and 1991 they chose "Muslim nationality".\n\nPerhaps the term "Bosnian Muslim nationality" is too confusing for\nthe rest of the world.  But, in the present context, we ARE talking\nabout Muslims as nationality; not as a religous group within some\nseparate national identity.  The reasons are mostly historical and\ncultural.  Religion plays a smaller role, as a part of culture in general,\nbecause the area is simply not known for religious fanaticism.  Political\nfanaticism, yes; religious fanaticism, no.  Group security and survival\ndominate people's thinking; not fine points of theology.  In fact,\nBosnia-Herzegovina is as well known for religious tolerance in peacetime\nas it is known for terrible carnage in wartime.
What is this "Gaza"? Are you purposely separating it from the "West Bank"?\nIf so, why separate the people and territories? If not, why are you just\naddressing "Gaza" here? \n\nBy all means, continue to list the "etc." The reason I particularly\nbring this up here is that there are **many** from middle eastern\nand west asian countries. That fact in itself **adds** an important\nelement to any consideration of "resolution" of the Arab-Israel\nconflict.\n\n\nYou explained what "sea" meant with regard to the Israelis/jews,\nplease do so in this case.\n\n\n"Just"? You better not ask for that because that would mean North \nAmerican tribes would be returned their lands, the pre-Islamic tribes \nwould take back their lands from the Islamic invaders, the Saxons get \nto kick the Normans out of the UK, the central and south american \ntribes get to kick the spanish descendents out of thier lands..... \nAnd, once we have returned the land to those who last possessed it, \nwe have to find out from whom **they** stole it. At some point, *every* \nculture stole the land they are on from previous occupants.\n\n\nBut wait! Now you refer to "Palestinians", so what happened to "Gaza"?\n\nAs we both know, most people would choose the third alternative. And,\nsince you have done so in the past, perhaps you would initiate things by \npresenting your vision of "resolution". In doing so, however, the worries\n(not paranioas, *worries*) and resonable expectations **of both**\nparties should be considered.
Actually, just after the FIRST world war, many Muslims were killed by Serbs.\nUnder Serbian-led regime between the two world wars, many Croats were\nalso killed (especially during the dictatorship introduced on Jan. 6, 1929).\nSome Croats formed a resistance movement "Ustashas" (Insurgents) and\nwere forced into exile, to fascist Italy, which sheltered them.  In exile,\nthey practiced a terrorist approach to liberating Croatia; while Croats in\nCroatia followed the approach of peaceful negotiations under the leadership\nof Vladko Macek.  After the Axis powers took control in the SECOND world\nwar, Vladko Macek refused to collaborate, so Ustashas were brought in \nto run the newly formed puppet state.  This state included both Croatia and\nBosnia-Herzegovina, and its ideology saw Muslims as the best Croats\n("flowers of Croatian people").  Some Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina\ntherefore joined Ustashas.  However, even more others did not; they\njoined Tito's Partisans.    The Ustashas membership peaked at \nless than 1% of Croat and Muslim population of that area at that time.\n\nAfter WWII, Muslims were still considered a religious minority descended\nfrom Croats or Serbs who converted to Islam centuries ago.  But, in 1968,\nit was decided that forcing Muslims to declare their nationality as\neither Serbs or Croats is not a good policy.  Dobrica Cosic, the current\npresident of the rump Yugoslavia, was strongly opposed, and sought to\nprevent the category "Muslim" (in an ethnic sense) from appearing on the\nnext census.  He was criticized and expelled from the party.  So, since\nthat time, Bosnian Muslims are considered a separate nationality, although\nsome still deny this and insist that they choose either Serb or Croat\nnationality.
You *know* that putting something like this out on the newsgroup is *only*\ngoing to generate flames, not discussion. Try adding some substance to\nthe issue of "gestures" you mentioned.\n\nWhat is it you feel that Israel *has* offered as a "gesture"? What would\nyou (*realistically*) expect to see presented by the Arabs/Palestinians\nin the way of "gesture"?\n\n\nWhat are the "rules" that have been bent by Arab actions? It would seem\nthat the Israeli deportations were seen by the other side as an example\nof "changing the rules".
You're just beginning to scratch the surface.  Do you know how much\nmilitary equipment costs?  When was the last time you tried to buy a\nmil-spec hammer, coffee-pot or toilet seat?  \n\nPaying Israel to do the dirty work on it's own without putting\nAmerican soldiers's lives on the line is much, much, much cheaper than\nUncle Sam's arrangements with much of the rest of the world.

I have to say I think this is the first time there has\nbeen something posted that opposed me without making personal\ninsults. Congradulations tim. I think the other people answered\nyou on most of the factual parts(esp. about the internal\nconflicts policy). \n	Israel very often gets away with more\nthan most other nations (Due to U.S. vetos). While I am not\nfamiliar with every instance I know that the reason Saudi\nArabia was not condemned for killig the pilgrims was that the\npilgrims were iranian. Yes, the UN is biased but mostly in\nfavor of the US and its allies (Including Israel, Saudi Arabia\nand Pakistan) and against "Outlaw" countries like iran and more\nrecently Iraq. Far be it from me to support the repressive\ngovernments there but I think they get more slack than Israel\nfor things they do "wrong". Again the reason some condemnations\ndon't occur lies in the race or country of the victims. The\ngassed Iraqi kurds got associated with Iran in the war and\nsince Iran was perceived as worse than Iraq no condemnation\nresulted. The palestinians killed by arab countries involved\nanother case of who cares. It seems that until very recently no\none cared about how many palestinians died anywhere (including\nin Israel and the occupied territories).\n	Again I appreciate the lack of personal insults.
Huh?  Mohamed Salimeh was perhaps a Korean?  How do you claim\narab-americans had no involvement in the WTC bombing?\n\n	Ok, his involvement is alleged by the FBI, which doesn't seem\nto reliable these days.  But honestly, there is a pile of evidence\npointing to them, and it seems those 5 were involved.\n\n	This does not mean that all arab-americans were involved, nor\nshould they be blamed for it, but denying that there were some\narab-americans involved sounds sorta silly to me.\n\nAdam\nAdam Shostack 				       adam@das.harvard.edu
I caught the tail end of a piece on NPR (National Public Radio) about\nChomsky.  Apparently there is a new documentary about him and his\nconcepts on the propagandist news media of the West, or some such.\nThe funny thing is that NPR painted Chomsky and the documentary in\nsuch a positive light, or at least ended the report in a positive way.\nThe documentary is just now showing in a few cities in the US, and\nwill open in more cities in June.  Sorry, forgot the title.
And this is just the beginning. Fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government will \nnot get away with the genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds, and 204,000 \nAzeri people. Your criminal grandparents committed unheard-of crimes, \nresorted to all conceivable methods of despotism, organized massacres, \npoured petrol over babies and burned them, raped women and girls in front \nof their parents who were bound hand and foot, took girls from their \nmothers and fathers and appropriated personal property and real estate. \nAnd today, they put Azeris in the most unbearable conditions any other \nnation had ever known in history. \n\nYour fascist grandparents admitted their unspeakable crimes then. \nWhy deny them now? Now the genocide of the truth by the criminal/Nazi \nArmenians? Not a chance.\n\n                               \nSource: "Men Are Like That" by Leonard Ramsden Hartill. The Bobbs-Merrill\nCompany, Indianapolis (1926). (305 pages). \n(Memoirs of an Armenian officer who participated in the genocide of 2.5 \n million Muslim people)\n\n"Foreword:"\n\n"For example, we were camped one night in a half-ruined Tartar mosque, \n the most habitable building of a destroyed village, near the border \n of Persia and Russian Armenia. During the course of evening I asked \n Ohanus if he could tell me anything of the history of the village and \n the cause of its destruction. In his matter of fact way he replied, Yes, \n I assisted in its sack and destruction, and witnessed the slaying of \n those whose bones you saw to-day scattered among its ruins." \n\np. 202 (first and second paragraphs).\n\n"We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as \n ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work \n of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. \n Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts \n into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable \n and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets \n completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They \n found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border \n into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole \n length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to \n Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain \n plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of \n Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for \n howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the \n scattered bones of the dead." \n\np. 15 (second paragraph).\n\n"The Tartars were, for the most part, poor. Some of them lived in villages \n and cultivated small farms; many of them continued in the way of life of \n their nomadic forefathers. They drove their flocks and herds from valley \n to valley, from plain to mountain, and from mountain to plain, following \n the pasturage as it changed with the seasons. They ranged from the salt \n desert shores of the Caspian Sea far into the mighty Caucasus Mountains. \n Even the village Tartars are a primitive people, only semicivilized."\n\n"I can see now that we Armenians frankly despised the Tartars, and, while \n holding a disproportionate share of the wealth of the country, regarded and\n treated them as inferiors. The fact that the Russians looked down upon all\n Armenians in much the same way as Armenians regarded Tartars, far from proving\n a bond between ourselves and our racially different neighbors, intensified\n an attitude and conduct on our part that served only to exacerbate hostility."\n\np. 20 (second paragraph).\n\n"Our men armed themselves, gathered together and advanced on the Tartar\n section of the village. There were no lights in the houses and the doors\n were barred, for the Tartars suspected what as to happen and were in great \n fear. Our men hammered on the doors, but got no response; whereupon they\n smashed in the doors and began a carnage that continued until the last\n Tartar was slain. Throughout the hideous night, I cowered at home in terror,\n unable to shut my ears to the piercing screams of the helpless victims and\n the loud shouts of our men. By morning the work was finished."\n\np. 109 (second paragraph).\n\n"As things were, the members of the Dashnack Party were without administrative\n experience; consequently the government they instituted quickly proved itself\n incompetent to rule by legitimate means.\n\n The members of the government had been revolutionists working in secret and\n outside the law. When they became a legally instituted, recognized governing\n body with the destiny of Armenia in their hands, they proved incompetent to \n do better than resume the terrorist tactics that had characterized their \n fight against the Russian and Turkish Governments in their outlaw days.\n\n The outstanding feature of their rule, now that they were in power, was,\n as in the old days, trial and execution without hearing. A man evoking\n the displeasure of the government or of some official would be tried and\n condemned without arrest or preference of charges against him. The method \n of execution was for a government 'mauserist' to walk up behind the\n condemned man in his home or on the street, place a pistol to the back\n of his head and blow out his brains. This simple way of getting rid of\n those who were undesirable in the view of the government and soon became\n a common way of paying debts."\n\np. 203 (first paragraph).\n\n"A soldier succeeded in driving his bayonet through the Tartar. I saw the\n point of the weapon emerge through his back. ...Another soldier seized a rock \n and pounded the Tartar's head with it... The Armenian who had bayoneted him\n sprang to his feet, wrested the weapon from the Tartar's body, and, raising\n it to his lips, licked it clean of blood, exclaiming in Russian, 'Slodkey!\n Slodkey!' (Sweet.)"\n\np. 203 (second paragraph).\n\n"One evening I passed through what had been a Tartar village. Among the \n ruins a fire was burning. I went to the fire and saw seated about\n it a group of soldiers. Among them were two Tartar girls, mere children.\n The girls were crouched on the ground, crying softly with suppressed\n sobs. Lying scattered over the ground were broken household utensils and\n other furnishings of Tartar peasant homes. There were also bodies of the\n dead."\n\np. 204 (first paragraph).\n\n"I was soon asleep. In the night I was awakened by the persistent crying of\n a child. I arose and went to investigate. A full moon enabled me to make\n my way about and revealed to me all the wreck and litter of the tragedy\n that had been enacted. Guided by the child's crying, I entered the yard of\n a house, which I judged from its appearance must have been the home of a\n Turkish family. There in a corner of the yard I found a women dead. Her\n throat had been cut. Lying on her breast was a small child, a girl about a\n year old."\n\np. 118.\n\n"Slowly the train of oxcarts lumbered along through the snow, the cart\n jolting and the loads swaying. Boys ran along the line of oxen, encouraging\n them with shrill Tartar cries, and belaboring the beasts with sticks. In the\n carts, the women, veiled as is the Tartar way, held children in their arms.\n Wrapped in blankets and huddled among the goods that burdened the carts they\n sought protection from the wind and cold. A few old men plodded along on foot.\n\n Across the road through the ravine a barrier had been thrown. The leading\n oxteam reached this barrier and halted. The gunmen and other ruffians \n concealed among the rocks opened fire. Women and children leaped and\n scrambled from the carts, screamed, ran and sought vainly for safety.\n\n This massacre was not complete. The Armenian soldiers in the near-by \n barracks, hearing the firing and the turmoil, hurried to the scene....\n That same day the abandoned Tartar quarter of Alexandropol was looted\n and completely destroyed."\n\np. 192.\n\n"Great swarms of peasants who had come out of their hiding-places on the\n retreat of the Turks followed our army as it advanced....

They had been as helpless\n and as defenseless as sheep. They had not died as soldiers die in the\n heat of battle, fired with ardor and courage, with weapons in their hands,\n and exchanging blow for blow. They had died as the helpless must, with\n their hearts and brains bursting with horror worse than death itself."\n\np. 133 (first paragraph)\n\n"In this movement we took with us three thousand Turkish soldiers who\n had been captured by the Russians and left on our hands when the Russians\n abandoned the struggle. During our retreat to Karaklis two thousand of\n these poor devils were cruelly put to death. I was sickened by the\n brutality displayed, but could not make any effective protest.

Well, let's delve one level deeper. Why is democracy better than tribalism or\nother means of Govt.? The President of Georgia was elected with a thumping\nmajority and booted out later, w/ no objections from the UN. Similarly, the\npeople of Algeria elected an Islamic Fundemantalist Party into power but the\njunta declared it illegal. In both cases, I personally have _no_ problems with\nthe outcome, but if the voice of the people is that hallowed thing that the \nworld community claims to revere so, why isn't it interfering there? \n\n.\nExactly. My point is that it will inevitably turn out that way, and we can save\nourselves a lot of pain and trouble by simply letting people sort out their\nproblems on their own. Colonial interventions, even in Haiti, haven't worked \nin the past. They had a 102 coups from 1845-1915. The US invaded in 1915. And left\nin 1933, almost 17 years after they had intended to. Was it a success? Well,\nlook at Haiti today and of the past 40 years and decide for yourself. It _was_\na success so long as the US was in, from what I remember. But it didn't last\nlong, obviously.\n\n\nNobody did. People should have a right to self-defense. If the UN wants to arm\nthe Bosnians or Haitian revolutionaries or whoever, I have no problems with\nthat. I do when they cross that line and attempt to re-arrange boundaries, govts.\netc., the Vance-Owen plan being one such piece of insanity.\n \n\nWe finally have a clearly-stated point of difference. Colonialism can\nhave its good side, which is as you stated above - removing thugs from being\nable to lord it over powerless people. I am worried that the bad side is what \nwill assert itself, and I am prepared to let natural forces take their course \nif that will mean we can avoid the bad side of colonialism.\n\n\n-- \nSrinivas Sunder                                         sunder@crhc.uiuc.edu\n\nIf The University of Illinois shares these views, I'd be surprised.\nThey aren't that smart generally -:).
Actually I am not sure you have understood what I have said. On several\noccasions a minor party has put up an Arab for a Cabinet position. That\nis the major party (Labour in this case) has agreed that a minor party\ncan have so many seats and that party nominates an Arab for one. This is\nnot acceptable to the major party which insists on the minor party\nappointing a Jew. The favours owed, deals done, have all been settled.\nWhat remains is exactly who is going to sit in Cabinet. The party that\ngets the seat wants an Arab but that is not acceptable. This *is* racism.\nIt has nothing to do with politics at all.\n\nJoseph Askew
I think there are some generally accepted criteria according to which\none can evaluate whether certain policies or practices constitute\nracial discrimination. These criteria are to be found for example in the\n1.  International Convention for Abolition of All Forms of Racial\n    Discrimination (ratified by most countries)\n2.   The International Covenant of Political and Civil Rights\n3.   The Human Rights Charter\n4.   The European Convention of Human Rights\n\nIf one reads carefully how racial discrimination is defined in these\nlegally binding instruments, and does not resort to sophistry, it is\nobvious that the State of Israel is guilty of racial discrimination.\n\n\nThe people suffering the most extreme form of racial discriminatnion\nby the Zionist regime are the Palestinian refugees, some of whom live\nunder Israeli military control and others who live in the diaspora.\n\nThey are not entitled to return to their homeland for the sole\nreason that they are not Jews. International law does not include any\nprovisions which permits such denial of rights, under any circumstance.\nIsrael's actions of denial are totally illegal and immoral. By allowing\nthe return of the refugees and permitting them to settle in Tel in any area  of\nthe State of Israel, the State would finally gain its legitimaty under\ninternational law and could be justified in asking to be recognized. It\nwould facilitate the peaceful integration of Israel into the Middle-east\nand constitute the best guarantee for permanent Jewish presence -\nin the area. Any attempt to create a separation, formal and human, between the\nIsraeli Jewish and Palestinian Arab communities, is fraught with\ngenociadal implications. I hope that U.S. Jews, who sincerely wish that\npeace prevail in Israel/Palestine, will finally realize this fact.\n\nElias Davidsson

Tsiel,\n\nI would contend that there was shelling from both sides of the border,\nstarting from the early 70's.  Certainly the PLO did shell Northern\nIsrael from the Arqoub region, but Israel did much more shelling\ndestroying several South Lebanese villages.  At the very least\nwe can say that both sides exchanged shelling, with occasional\naerial raids by Israel on Lebanese villages.\nIn any case Steve's characterization that the 1982 invasion was only in \nresponse to years of shelling from Lebanon is false.  Israel had\nmany reasons for invading but mainly it did so to install a government\nin Lebanon favorable to Israel, and it nearly achieved this aim\nwith the election of Basheer El Gemayel, and his brother, Amin\nEl Gemayel, but the internal situation in Lebanon was too hard\nto control and predict so Israel had to withdraw, and Amin El Gemayel\nhad to abrogate the 17 th of May Agreement.
The borders of the Jewish state as drawn by the U.N. included the areas which\ncontained mostly Jews,  that's what the surveys and the numerous commitees\nwhere after when they visited here.\n\n\nI never touched an Arab during my army service and never voted for anyone more\nright than the Green party.  Will I be spared by these "humanist standards"?\n(or will anyone stop to consider this before sloughtering me?)\n\nI doubt it.  And not only because of the past record of murdering helpless\nwomen and children since the turn of the century up to these days.
Is that how the mind of a compulsive liar works? The scenario and \ngenocide staged by the Armenians 78 years ago in x-Soviet Armenia \nis being reenacted again - this time in Azerbaijan. There are remarkable \nsimilarities between the plots, the perpetrators, and the underdogs. \n\nThe stories of survivors of Karabag massacre:\n\n69 year old Hatin Nine telling:\n\n-''My Twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes. They told\nme: We won't kill you. But the babies have to die in front of your eyes.''\n\n72 year old Huseyin Ibrahimoglu:\n\n- ''Our Turkish village in Khojalu Town was blown up in two hours.\n  Turks, you must die.''\n\n28 year old Gulsum Huseyin:\n\n- ''They bayonetted my 3 year old daughter in her stomach in front of\n    my eyes.''\n\nAre these stories lies? Have the eye-witnesses been day-dreaming?\nWere these stories forged by Turkish journalists in the region?\n\nThe nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of British\nJournalists, too. Two days before we had quoted from a Sunday Times\narticle. They[British] reported the events in Karabag even before\nTurkish journalists. What is more here are the pictures. Pictures\nof people who were bayonetted, whose eyes were gouged, ears cut off.\n\nEven the Armenian Radio couldn't claim these "lies." They are saying\n"exaggeration." That means ''somethings'' have happened but the\nsituation is not as bad as reported. Perhaps that village of Khojalu\ntown was destroyed in 4 hours, instead of 2... Or Gulsum Huseyin's\n3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach...\n\nThe massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions. The effects of\nthis massacre on Karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word.\n\nSome of the western press', led by some French Newspapers, ability\nto ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre.\n\nYesterday we gave samples from Le Figaro. Until yesterday's print\nno news about the real events in Karabag were printed. So were the\nFrench TV channels.. The subject they considered related to Karabag\nwas ''The necessity of protecting Armenians against Azeri attacks.''\n\nThe age we are living in is termed a human rights age. There are lots\nof organizations such as United Nations and CSCE(Conference on Security\nand Cooperation in Europe), and rules, all designed to fight against human\nrights violations. International reactions must be made with international\ncooperation. With support of everybody and every organization claiming\nto be civilized.\n\nCould there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the\nright to live -and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty-? Where\nis the cooperation? Where are the reactions? And the intellectuals,\njournalists, writers, TV stations of certain western countries such\nas France who are fast to claim leadership of "human rights?"\nWhere are you?\n\nSerdar Argic

We had a most peculiar\nlittle locomotive, originally built in America for the Russian\nGovernment, adapted to burn either wood or oil; one covered\ntruck as men's quarters; one similar, which I fitted up for my-\nself and a railway officer; and also a truck to carry wood, three\ncars being the utmost our small engine could pull. With this\nsmall outfit we started, rumours of all kinds reaching us before\nour departure indicating that the whole situation was rapidly\ncoming to a head, it being evident that the Turks were becoming~\nmore and more restive in the face of the inexplicable delay of\nthe Allies in reaching any definite decision with regard to the\nfuture.\n\nTravelling on this little "war-time" railway was indeed an\nexperience, and it was necessary to carry a "gauge," and to\ntest the rails with it frequently, for in many places, owing to\nthe sinking of the embankments and the washing away of the\nballast, the rails required rectification before we were able to\nget our train over, even at a foot pace; each bridge also re-\nquired elaborate examination before adventuring the train upon\nit, and eventually we were obliged to carry large baulks of tim-\nber to temporarily shore up many of the bridges and culverts\nwhilst we passed over them.\n\nUnder these circumstances it may be imagined that our prog-\nress was by no means rapid, and as we had frequently to halt\nalso to replenish our supply of wood fuel, we considered we\nhad achieved wonders when, on the evening of the second day,\n60 hours and 70 miles out from Erzeroum, we finally entered the\ngorge of the mountains where we understood our worst troubles\nto lie. This is the same gorge into which the road from\nErzeroum to Kars descends from the foot-hills to cross the\nfrontier; the railway, however, follows the main Aras River val-\nley till the frontier gorge enters it, whilst the road cuts off the\ncorner and joins the rail again at the frontier post of Zivin,\nsome 15 miles from the main valley.\n\nSoon after entering the gorge, we were confronted by the\nfirst serious fall of rock--about 2,000 tons having fallen from\nthe cliff face and entirely obliterated the railway track.

....\n\nThanks for posting the references. I do not normally read t.p.m.,\nand I posted my request for references because Jim's article\nwas cross-posted to soc.culture.jewish. Allegations of Jewish\ndisrespect for the objects and buildings of other religions are\none of antisemitic stereotypes that permeate western culture, and\nrumors of church and Host desacration probably caused more pogroms\nthan blood libel. The stereotypes that pervade our culture create\ncognitive illusions that reify those stereotypes. Therefore any\nclaim that appears to reify a stereotype should be treated by\ndecent people with utmost suspicion until and unless documented.\nIf such a claim is cross-posted to a news group in which it has\nnot been documented before, such as s.c.j, a reference should be\ngiven the first time it appears.  Now that the claim has been\ndocumented, I regard the whole episode as disgusting and\nshameful. Especially so because the official who failed to\nprovide proper temporary facilities for the evicted Jordanians\nwas probably Jewish, and as a Jew I know that he should have\nknown better.
So, Mr. Salah is still claiming Stalin was a Jew? \n\nThis thread began on SCA, when he and another guy claimed both Stalin\nand Lenin were Jews. When I posted evidence from books and the Britannica\nshowing they were Christians, someone made the (correct) remark that\nLenin's maternal grandfather was a Jew who converted to Christianity.\n\nTo counter the fact that Stalin was a Christian who, during his youth,\nwas trained to be a priest, Mr. Salah wrote "yes, it says he was trained\nto be a priest, but not for what religion!" (BTW, Stalin developed\nstrong antisemitic feelings later in his life).\n\nMr. Salah seems intent on trying to spread hate against Jews by posting\nantisemitic forgeries and trying to "prove" that certain notorious\npeople were Jews, even if they were not.

It is indeed different usage of the word Muslim . In Bosnia , it is more or\nless used as an ethnic term not as religious one . There are people in Bosnia\nwho refer to themselves as "Christian Bosnian Muslims" if you can make sense\nof that . Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Muslims have the same language. \nBosnian Muslims are mainly beleivers of Islam. I got this from Bosnian Muslim\nfriend of mine who goes to University of Texas in Austin.

First of all I'm still baffled what you possibly could have\nfound racist in my argument for freedom of speach. I did not\nmention names, nationalities, countries let alone races. \n	You are right in that Virginia.edu does not have a\nthought police like Israel.nysernet.org seems to. I didn't know\nthat you guys are getting a privelege by the Israelis by\ngetting "the means to speak publicly". Virginia.edu lets EVERY\nstudent regardless of their opinion to speak their mind. \n	Virginia.edu is true to its founding father, Thomas\nJefferson the author of the bill of rights, in allowing freedom\nof speach. Sorry you guys in israel have a hard time with the\nconcept.
It is all so changed by now. but in case any of you is\ninterested in what I actually said, I never compared the\nIsraeli treatment of the palestinians with the Holocaust.\nAnyway that is the truth if it matters. I was about to forget\nabout it myself since everyone started calling me anti-semitic\nfor making the comparison that I never made. What I did say was\nthat the Nazis didn't start with the Holocaust and their\ninitial actions were similar to what the Israelis are doing now.\n	The Jews that were stranded on the polish border since\nno country accepted them are like the arabs stranded on the\nlebenese border. No trials, no hearing, just expulsion based on\nguilt due to race.

Well Bosnia and the US did...the UN cannot impose blue berets on\na country, and the US has voted for the current policy and mandate\nin the Security Council...and could have said no if it wanted to...\nit has a veto.\n\nClinton has not demanded the removal of the UN forces...because he want\nto have his cake and eat it too...he wants to dictate policy but\nnot be responsible for the policy he wants to dictate.  If Clinton\nasks for the blue berets to leave, then he Bill Clinton becomes\nresponsible for what happens...him and Sen. Biden and their friends\nwho want to fight the war from 10,000 ft...as long as the blue berets\nare there Clinton can use Europe as a scapegoat for American\nindecisiveness.\n\nI fully admit that the current UN policy approved by all the major\npowers including the US may be wrong or inappropriate...but these\n"back-seat drivers" in the US like Clinton and Biden are just a bunch\nof hypocrites looking for an gimmick to look like they are doing \nsomething to assuage their own consciences and those who are\ndemanding action or leadership...and most European leaders are\nsmart enough to know the difference between American hot air and\nAmerican leadership.\n\n\nWell, if Biden is so outraged...why the hell doesn't he do something\nabout it...where is his resolution in the US Senate for a declaration\nof war or the commitment of US forces and troops.

From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>\nSubject: Zionists reject non-Jews. News\n\n\nEthiopian Jews and not-quite Jews\n\nThe Israeli press has published items about Ethiopian \nJews waiting in camps in Addis Ababa for immigration to \nIsrael, who are dying of starvation. The following are \nexcerpts from an interview with the former general \ndirector of the JDC project for development and welfare \nof Ethiopian Jews, Kobi Friedman (Hadashot, 21 April \n1993), who has stated that "there are people dying in \nAddis Ababa, but they are converts to Christianity":\n\n"Hadashor published the item about the dying Jews after \nviewing a video tape filmed last week in Adis Ababa. \nHow do you know that they are actually converts to \nChritianity ?\n\n"If there are Jews on the tape, then I don't know what to \nsay. I am speaking from experience when I say that those \nwho remained in Ethiopia are Christians. I know that \nthere have previously been things published in the press \nby interesting parties, and there is no connection \nbetween them and reality."\n\n"What interested parties ?"\n\n"Ethiopian immigrants who want their Christian relatives \nto come here."\n\n"What to you recommend that Ethiopian children in Israel \ndo, when their parents and the rest of their relatives \nremain in Ethiopia ?"\n\n"I ask if it is the job of the State of Israel to bring in the \n40 relatives who stayed in Ethiopia. Well, my answer is \nthat it is not. It would be a better solution, economically \nas well, for that young man to buy a one-way ticket to \nEthiopia and reunite with his family there."
Great, someone will be posting from 'Protocols of the Elders of Zion' next\n\n\nAt this time the PLO did not exist and would not for the next 20 years.\nYou knew that didn't you?

The Libertarians believe in getting the government off the\nbacks of the people, so that the free market can solve problems.\n\n	Libertarians believe in an end to the welfare state, an end to\ngovernment subsidies of all sorts.  The basic idea is that the\ngovernment is way too big and way too expensive, and should be shrunk\ndown to a reasonable size.\n\n	They also believe in a complete end to foreign aid, including\nthe stationing of American troops overseas.  We can not and should not\nbe policing the world.\n\n\n	I agree that the people who come into this group and describe\nthemselves as Libertarians seem to posses the charictaristics you\ndescribe, but heck, we're not all like this.

I  must  finally  admit the total truth that is central to the\ncore of my being.\n\n   I  am  a  homosexual.   Not  just  a  normal,  run-of-the-mill\nhomosexual,  but  a  rabid homosexual Zionist.  I hide behind the\nfacade  of  pro-Israel  rhetoric so as to deflect suspicion of my\ntrue  motive:  the exchange of romantic dialogue with Nick Steel,\nand  our  frequent  fudge-packing   adventures,  which   we  have\nendeavored  to maintain at a discreet level.  Of course, the need\nfor discretion has been obviated by my own admission here.\n\n   The  truth  is  that  I  could  no longer hold this saccharine\nsecret  any  longer.   I love  you,  Nick,  and  my  love for you\nsurpasses  that  which  I  hold  for Eretz Yisrael, may she stand\nforever, as our love has, and as your erection insinuating itself\ninto my kosher rectum always will.
I add my congratulations as well. To all those who survive the gauntlet,\ncheers.
That doesn't answer my question:  Can you give a proof that it is an official\npolicy of any Israeli government to kill "neutral observers" or UN personel\nor others like them?\n\nI wasn't sure that your original statement was wrong and was prepared to\nrecieve proofs that you are right  (since I don't follow the events closely).\nYour last response made me pretty damn sure that at least YOU can't give such\na proof,  and you made your original statement without much ground to put it\non.\n\n\nEven if it's true (and in this case I'd take it without asking you to prove it)\nit is still far from killing reporters.  Also whenever that happened I'll bet\nit happened as individual actions by certain soldiers and not as a policy of\nthe government  (e.g. see the Hawara case where a colonel was sentenced for\ngiving orders to kick Arabs,  as far as I remember).\n\nBye,
In the same way in which antisemite means anti-Jewish and not anti-all-\npersons-of-who-are-semite, a "form of racism" means: A form of segregation\nagainst all those who are different based on the religious identification.\n\nAAP
As we see right now, the position of influence enjoyed by parties favoring\nthe negotiation process is tenuous at best. The local "elections" in Hebron\nthat the PLO was expected to win (perhaps adding a bit to its flagging\nposition of "legitimacy" in the eyes of Palestinians and the Middle East)\nhave been disrupted by Hamas actions overtly directed towards\nundermining those (and all West Bank) elections. The present ruling Israeli \nLabor coalition seems to be one rather thin political ice. The Palestinian\ndelegation has been reduced from 14 to three to protest Israel "lack of\nseriousness" in the talks and refusal to reverse all the deportations\nimmediately.\n\nHopefully, however, each of the parties will begin to learn that just\nthe fact that negotiations are taking place *does not mean* they are giving \nanything away to "the other side" (which was/is the favorite argument of \nthe "rejectionists"). Let's hope that discusion and inevitable disagreement\non major issues leads at the same time to some agreement on smaller\n"interim" ("phase", whatever term we prefer) steps to be taken.
Damned if you do and Damned if you don't!\n\n\nJust for the record, Egyptian troops were one of the first to be\nstationed there. I can't remember the exact date but it was late last\nyear. In fact, they lost at least one man there as far as I know.

The following are quotes of his speech: \n\n``Kuwait itself was an entity identified as Kuwait even before \nIraq was identified as Iraq in the Ottoman Empire. Kuwait was in \nexistence since 1752. We continued to be in existence until the \nconflict between the Ottoman Empire and the British and others in the \narea. Thereafter, we signed with the British in 1899 a protective \nagreement whereby the British guaranteed the sovereignty and security \nof Kuwait.'' \n\n``In 1913, the British and the Ottoman signed an agreement defining \nwithout any doubt the borders of Kuwait as they stand today. Such an \nagreement was reconfirmed in 1932 between the Kuwaiti government \nand the Iraqi government at that time. That is when Iraq became a state, \nafter Kuwait itself.'' \n\n``In 1961, when we declared our independence Iraq seized the \nopportunity to claim Kuwait as part of Iraq. There were threats. The \nBritish came in, and Arab forces came in to guarantee the sovereignty \nand territorial integrity of Kuwait. In 1963, Kuwait and Iraq again \nsigned border agreement, thereby defining our territory and Iraq's \nrecognition to the sovereignty and territory of Kuwait.'' \n\n---Compiled by Firyal Alshalalbi \n\n\nOrigins of Kuwait \n\nThe establishment of Kuwait is attributed to Barrak b. Ghurair of the \nBani Khalid who used Kuwait as a summer residence. The beginning of \nKuwait goes back to the late 17th century and some historians go \nfurther up to 1611. Kuwait's name is derived from al-Kut which means \nfortress. Kuwait is also called Qurain, which is the diminutive of qarn, a \nhorn or hill. Kuwait town flourished and grew since its \nestablishment. \n\nThe 'Utub, al-Sabah family is a branch of 'Utub, settled in Kuwait \nduring the early 18th century. They lived under the protection \nof Bani Khalid until 1752. After that, they became independent and \nSabah Bin Jabir was chosen as the first ruler for 'Utub. \n\nCarsten Niebuhr (1733-1815) a Dutch explorer was among the first who \nwrote about the Arabia. He was the mathematician in the scientific \nexpedition sent in 1760 by the King of Denmark to Arabia. He \ndocumented details of Arab tribes inhabiting both coasts of the Gulf \nand in the case of Kuwait, he was the first writer to give the two \nnames by which the town was known, Kuwait and Qurain. Niebuhr's chart \nof the Persian Gulf was the best one drawn before the end of that \ncentury, see the map from Abu Hakima, History of Eastern Arabia \n1750-1800. pub.1965. \n\nAl-Sabah ('Utub) kept good relations with other powers in the eastern \nArabia. According to Ahmed Abu Hakima's conclusions in his well \ndocumented study about the history of eastern Arabia between 1750-1800, \nthere was no Ottoman rule on the region. ``In the second half of \nthe 18th century, there was no Ottoman ruler in Eastern Arabia. \nIn fact, Ottoman rule was not even nominally acknowledged. Their \nattempts to restore their lost position in al-Hasa through the \ncampaign of Thuwayni in 1786, and Ali Pasha's expedition against the \nWahhabis in 1798, were unsuccessful. At Kuwait, the nearest point of \nthe Utbi domains to the Ottoman Mutasallimiyya of Basra, the Shaikh \nwas under no form of Ottoman control. The aim of 'Utbi external policy \nwas to keep on friendly relations with all the forces working in the \nGulf.'' (p. 182-183) Abu Hakima continued in his conclusions that ``Kuwait \nwas not a dependency of Basra, the Persian occupation of Basra \n(1775-79) did not affect Kuwait.'' (p.183) \n\nKuwait had its own identity through the Ottoman domination on the Arab \nworld. This identity was clear to the British and the French who \ntried to win the support of Kuwait's Sheikh between 1793-95 when the \nBritish wanted his support in their conflict with the French in the \nGulf area. \n\n--- \n\nIndependent Kuwait \n\nThis is the first of a series of articles that testify to the \nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \nOttomans. \n\nThe following text is related to an expedition carried out by the \nOttomans in 1871 against the Wahhabis in Eastern Arabia (where the oil fields \nin Saudi Arabia now). Kuwait and its ruler at that time, Sheikh \nAbdulla Ibn Sabah Ibn Jabir, allied themselves with the Turks:} \n\nAbdullah' role in the fighting was not a minor one. He joined the \nexpedition as a commander of the large Kuwaiti fleet and was the first \nto use its guns against the besieged town of Al-Qatif. Had it not been \nfor this bombardment by the Kuwaiti fleet, Al-Qatif obviously would \nnot have surrendered in a mere three hours. \n\nIn relation to this, a question arises as to why the Ottoman warships \nrefrained from participating in the bombardment. The answer lies in \nreports relating to the political movements that preceded accounts of \nthe progress of the expedition. Because the Ottomans were unwilling to \njeopardize the maritime peace imposed by Britain in the area,  the \nSultan and the Pasha promised their warships would not be used in the \nwar against Su'ud or any Sheikh in the war zone. Kuwait, which was not \na party  to the above-mentioned treaty of 1861, was under no such \nobligation especially since the expedition was not directed against \nthose who had signed it. \n\n\n[ From the above text, we can see that Kuwait was not part of the \nOttomans or the British colonies. For more details about the mentioned \nexpedition, please check out the source of the above text: \n\nThe Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, McGill \nUniversity, Canada ] \n\n--- \n\nIndependent Kuwait--2 \n\nThis is another article of a series of articles that testify to the \nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \nOttomans. \n\nThe following text discusses a dispute on an estate called Sufiyya in Zubair, \nIraq, between the Sheikh of Kuwait and Al-Zuhair tribe in Zubair. \n\nIn 1866, trouble developed over the possession by Sheikh Sabah of the \nestate which was [purchased] by his father, Sheikh Jabir, in 1836. This \nproperty was sequestered by a Turkish Qa'immaqam [representative] on \nthe basis of a claim by the Al-Zuhair that the vendor had been the \nowner of a share and not of the n 100e Sufiyya. At the same time, \nSheikh Sabah was required to expel from other lands owned by him at \nthe island of Fao some cultivators who had immigrated from Persian \nterritory. \n\nIt should be recalled that  the Turkish officials from the start \nshowed strong prejudice in favor of the Zuhair claimants. Abdulla Ibn \nSabah,  the eldest son of the ruler of Kuwait who went to Basra as his \nfather's agent in the case,  narrowly escaped being thrown  into jail \nupon his refusal to make a payment amounting to the value of seven \nyears produce which the Ottoman authorities deemed the plaintiffs were \nentitled to receive. \n\nEventually, the dispute was settled by the Wali [Governor] of Baghdad \nin favor of the Sheikh of Kuwait. The decision of the Governor of \nBasra in favor of the Sheikh was apparently made for various reasons. \nSome writers think that the Governor wanted to win Abdulla over to the \nTurkish side, and suggest that the Governor, Namiq Pasha, even offered \nhim the title of Qa'immaqam, which he declined. Nevertheless,  the \nproceedings of the Turks in this case were regarded by the inhabitants \nof Kuwait as attempts to cause a confrontation with Zubair. It seems \nthat they had anticipated a conflict and according to reports by the \nBritish Agent at Basra, the people of Kuwait were prepared to a man to \nabandon their town rather than submit to Turkish rule. Lorimer suggests \nthat the final order of Namiq Pasha, upholding the Kuwait Sheikh's \ntitle to Sufiyya, was perhaps due to a report that Sheikh Sabah, \n``with the object of attacking Zubair if the decision should go \nagainst him, had obtained a promise of countenance and armed support \nfrom the Wahhabi Amir.'' \n\nIn addition to this legal matter with Zubair, Kuwait had had other \nproblems with Basra whose courts tried to jail Abdulla Ibn Sabah, as \nexplained above. However, Kuwait's relations with the Ottoman \nmutasallims of Basra had at times been amicable and in several \ninstances, those mutasallims even sought refuge at Kuwait when \npressured by the Pashas of Baghdad who exercised control over them. \n\n[ Source: The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, \nMcGill University, Canada ] \n\n--- \n\nIndependent Kuwait--3 \n\nThis is another article that testifies to the \nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \nOttomans. \n\n\nWhen Pelly [Colonel Pelly, the British Resident in the Gulf] visited Kuwait \nfor the first time on March 3, 1863, he was \nmet at Jahra by Sheikh Mubarak, the second son of the ruler, Sheikh \nSabah. Just before he reached Kuwait town on March 4, he was met by \nSheikh Abdulla, the eldest son and heir apparent, who accompanied him \nto the town gate on their way to ``a very good home,'' which had been \nprepared for Pelly and his companions. ``Scarcely had we entered it,'' \nsays Pelly, ``when Sheikh Sabah himself came.'' \nThis description of Pelly's reception indicates that to a certain \ndegree it was run according to protocol. \n\nThe government system of Kuwait and administration of justice were the \nsubject of comments made by Pelly. ``The Government is patriarchal,'' \nsays Pelly, ``the Sheikh managing the political, and the Cazee [Qadi] \nthe judicial departments. The Sheikh himself would submit to the \nCazee's decision.'' Punishment was rarely inflicted. ``Indeed, there \nseems little government interference anywhere, and little need of an \narmy.'' Pelly in admiration of how the Sheikh ran the affairs of the \ncountry, retold the following remark which the Sheikh had made to him: \n\nWhen my father was nearly 120 years old, he called me and said, ``I \nshall soon die. I have made no fortune, and can leave you no money, \nbut I have made many and true friends, grapple them. While other \nstates around the Gulf have fallen off from injustice or \nill-government, mine has gone on [flourishing]. Hold to my policy, and \nthough you are surrounded by  desert, and pressed by a once hostile \nand still wandering set of tribes, you will prosper.'' \n\n[ Source: The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, \nMcGill University, Canada ] \n\n--- \n\nIndependent Kuwait--4 \n\nThis is another article that testifies to the \nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \nOttomans. \n\n\nThe British had always regarded Sheikh Jabir as a ``good friend,'' but \nin October 1839, an event took place at Kuwait which could have \nweakened those good relations. On October 30, Lieutenant Edmunds, the \nAssistant Resident at Abu Shahr [in Iran], arrived in Kuwait on  a \nspecial mission from the Resident, Captain Hennell. His mission was to \nfind out if Kuwait was willing to welcome the establishment of a \nBritish line of post across the desert from Kuwait to the \nMediterranean. The British war vessel fired the usual salute in honor \nof the Sheikh after it had anchored in the waters of Kuwait Bay. The \nsalute was not acknowledged and Edmunds waited in the vessel for three \ndays before he was able to communicate with the Sheikh. \n\nAfter Edmunds' return to Abu Shahr, both he and Captain Hennell \nexplained this unusual behavior of the Sheikh, to have been due not \nto ill-will, but principally to a desire to mislead the Egyptian agent \nat Kuwait as to the nature of his relations with the British. \nTherefore, they considered that Jabir's conduct did not indicate any \nchange in his friendly policies towards the British. \n\nIf the British tolerated the attitude of Jabir towards Edmunds, so \nalso did the Egyptians. Earlier in the same year, some of the most \nwanted men in the Wahhabi camp, such as 'Umar Ibn 'Ufaisan, the \nWahhabi general  in Al-Hasa, and Wahhabi tribes like Al-Duwaish, \nsought refuge in Kuwait. \n\nProtection of refugees seeking political \nasylum in his country was a policy that had been adopted earlier by \nSheikh Abdulla Ibn Sabah. This can, therefore, be looked upon as an \nindication of self-confidence; an outcome of Kuwait's independence \nfrom foreign powers. It corroborates the fact that Kuwait, if \nnecessary, was prepared to defend itself against more powerful \nneighbors. \n\nThis defense depended not only on the walls of the city, but also on \nbedouin tribes in its neighborhood and a merchant fleet equipped with \nthe necessary guns comparable to other Arab fleets of the time. \n\nAs to Kuwait's position between 1815 and 1839, one can safely state \nthat it managed to maintain a neutral policy with regard to the \nstruggling Wahhabis and Egyptians. Relations with the British  and \neven with the Pasha of Baghdad continued on good terms. \n\n[ Source: The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, \nMcGill University, Canada ] \n\n--- \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  They were trying to recover land they believed \n  was theirs, much like the Argentines in the Faulklands.

The obsession with discussions of past (or present) events seems to be\nlargely centered on trying to "prove" that "they" are worse than "us".\nAs we see over and over, that leads nowhere except to make ourselves\nfeel superior. It's as if we've become addicted to periodic injections\nof "self-affirmation" that draw their power from denigration of the\n"other" and romanticization of ourselves. The hope is that we will begin \nsometime to apply these discussions in some way towards consideration of \nhow to defuse the situation, advancement of negotiations and the search \nfor common ground between the parties involved.\n \nOf course, for this to happen we can't believe that the best path to \n*making ourselves feel better* is at the expense of others.

Does anyone have a reference to the claim that the Arabs in the\nMoghrabi district were "squatters"?  I haven't seen this in the books\nI have read.  I haven't seen the opposite, either...
I am trying to follow the current conflict in former Yugoslavia. One thing\nI cannot figure out is where do the Serbs and Croats get their weapons,\netc? Don't they run out of them?
Oh come on, Josh!
This does not change the *fact* that "Muslim" is a legal and political\nterm defined constitutionally in former Yugoslavia, and therefore has\nmeaning and consequences entirely *independent* and *immaterial* of\nany religious considerations.\n \n\n\nYou only wish it were so.\n\nMore than 2,000,000 residents of Croatia and B-H have *not* accepted the\nterms of secession which Tudjman and Izetbegovic unilaterally forced upon\nthem.  Croats and Muslims may have a right to negotiated secession but\nthey do not have a right to grab the *entire* territories of the former\nYugoslav republics of Croatia and B-H.\n\nOh, BTW, *Yugoslavia* was *internationally recognized* when it was \ndestroyed by Tudjman, Izetbegovic, Milosevic, and the international\ncommunity led by Germany.  If Yugoslavia's borders could be changed\nagainst its will, then certainly Croatia's borders and B-H's borders\ncan be changed as well.  \n\nAs I have stated many times: the civil war in ex-Yugoslavia will end\nwhen the terms of secession (borders, etc.) for Croatia and B-H are\nfinally agreed upon.  Serbs, Croats, and Muslims will *all* have to\nmake territorial concessions to reach such an agreement.
Precisely, why not Cuba??  Why not???  The Hatians are being ruled by thugs \nand their elected leader has asked support to reestablish the peoples will.  If \nthe U.S. or any other democracy wishes to, they are in the perfect right to \nhelp them without any whining from thir parties.  After all if it turns out to \nbe colonialism and the poeple don't like it, they' find a way to throw them out.\n\n\nWho ever said people who commit genocide have the right to commit genocide??  \nI want a world where criminals agains humanity have no place to hide, while you \nwant special sovereignties designed to protect them.  Nobody has the right to \ncommit crimes against humanity, and if they do they loose all right to self \ndetermination.  If this is classical colonialism, then so be it.

So far, you have presented your opinions as opposed to mine. I would\nhardly take them as facts.\n\n\n\nI could give you hundreds of words in my mother tongue (Spanish), that\nare comonly use and you will never find in a dictionary. Even more, I\ncould show you a lot of meanings that words in Spanish have different\nfrom those in the dictionary.\n\n\nAnd guess why. Isn't it curious that we do not know how many people define \nin how many different ways the term Jew, which is the basis of the movement \nitself?\nSo, the evidence shows that up to now, Jew, when considered in terms of Israel,\nthe Law of Return and Jewish Nationality is defined in terms of religion and\nnot of cultural identity, even if 80% of those defined as Jews in Isreal\nare not religious.\n\n\n\nThat IS a problem. I am saying that I do not support Zionism as it is\nnow. I believe that among the people in the Soviet Communist Party some\nmight even had been inspired by noble ideals. Does that change the\nfinal results of what happened in the USSR?\nIn the same way, even if the Zionist movement is not homogeneous, it\ndoes not matter. What matters is the result.\n\n\nI never said it directly nor indirectly. I am not talking about individuals\nwho defined themselves as zionists here. I am sure most of them are good,\nhonest and caring people. I am talking about the results of the Zionist\nMovement. I am talking about a Movement whose actions resulted in a\nLaw of Return with a religious definition of Jew, a country that defines\nnationality based on religion. I am talking about something I consider\na form of racism such as differenciation based on religious belief. \nAfter all, if Arabs in Israel cannot serve in the Army is becasue they \nwere not born in the "right" religion.\n\n\nI had never heard the definition: Only those who are religious are defined as Jews.\nI had always seen the definition: A person is a Jew is his/her mother is/was\na Jew, and if such person does not convert, although I had seen people\nargue about the last part.\n\n\nSo, there is no difference between citizenship and nationality in Israel?\nOr what do you mean by "Actually, it doesn't"?\n\n\nSo, it follows a religious definition and not a cultural one. That is what\nI call a form of racism.\n\n\nYou do not need to assume the representation of "everybody else" to \nmake your points. You should assume that you are just talking for yourself.\nAbout the other stuff, I still believe that the example was a valid one.\nIt would be a hypocrisy to say that one supports nationalism for all and\nthen support Zionism and then disregard the Palestinian's right.\n\n\nIt was an example. You are trying to justify something nobody has \ntalked about.\n\n\n\nReference.\n\n\nyes, but not all of them. A language is something that evolves all the time.\n\n\nNot really. I posted in another post the definition of Zionism. And, in\nthis post you have showed for me what I was telling you from the \nbegining. Zionism is a form of racism, even if most zionists are not\nracist in their individual and private lifes. A movement that ask\nfor a State and National rights for a people, and then in practice,\nthat people are defined according to religion is, for me, racist-like.\n\n\nYou did it. Next time be more careful.\n\n\nDo you know the difference between opinion and fact?
It has be reported that the National Baseball League has\nbeen spotted in the West Bank;  they were recruiting pitchers.
Not due to race.  Due to membership in an organization which\npublically proclaimed it would destroy the state which expelled them\n-- and furthermore kill a large segment of the citizens of that state,\nbased on race.

I disagree.  By converting to another religion, you certainly\ndo change your cultural identity, and lose that part of you which was\nJewish.\n\n\n\n\n	No, there is a serious cultural and religios difference\nbetween renouncing the jewish god and accepting a new one.  "Thou\nshall have no other gods before me."  Conversion is a violation of\nthis, atheism you might be able to wiggle around with.\n\nAdam\n\n\n\nAdam Shostack 				       adam@das.harvard.edu
That would be nice, but considering professional diplomats between Israel and\nAthe Arabs have been unable to do so for 45 years, I can't see us starting.\nBut hey - as soon as anyone wants to discuss things reasonably and in a \nscholarly manner, count me in.\n\nAnyway the responses were mostly negative and I've been\n\nPeople have very strong opinions and you need to be careful regarding what \nyou say - if you say, make it factual and be able to back it up.\n\n\nThanks for teaching us about the civilized world, Andi.  I guess we all just \ncame out either the desert or the ghetto, right?  And no, we are not paid\nIsraeli lobbyists nor are we conspirators of the ZOG - we are just people who\nbelieve in our cause and find offense when people imply some sort dirty dealing\nor disloyalty due to our love of Israel (disguised as "paid Israeli lobbyists" -\nwhat kind of image is that?) \n\n\nOh!  Thank you!  I needed your approval of my heritage.  I guess I can go home\nand feel good now and sleep comfartably knowing that Jews _really_ aren't\nworse people than anyone else, contrary to what we all _know_ is true.
May 13, 1993  _Five Russian soldiers sentenced to death in Azerbaijan_\n \nMOSCOW (UPI) -- Five soldiers who served in Russia's 7th army stationed in\nArmenia were sentenced to death in the Azerbaijani capital Baku Thursday for\nallegedly "carrying out diversions and killing 30 Azeri soldiers." \n\nA statement released by the news service of Azeri President Abulfaz Elchibey\nsaid "the sentence was final and was not subject to protest or appeal," the \nRussian state news agency Itar-tass reported. \n\nBut the Russian Foreign Ministry issued an appeal for the men to be handed\nover to the authorities in Moscow for punishment. \n\n"This would accord with modern standards of humanity towards those who have\ncommitted crimes," the statement reads. \n\nThe five men, together with another soldier who received a 15-year prison\nsentence, were captured in September 1992 by Azeri police in the Kelbadzhar\ndistrict of Azerbaijan, between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia. \n\nThe Supreme Court in Baku said the men had gone through special training in a\ncompany of the Russian 7th army in the Armenian capital Yerevan, after which\nthey were sent across the Armenian-Azeri border into Nagorno-Karabakh to \ncarry out diversions against Azeri troops. \n\nHowever, the Russian Foreign Ministry statement claimed they had deserted the\nRussian army and were fighting as mercenaries with Armenian armed forces in\nthe battle zone round Karabakh. \n\nNagorno-Karabakh is an Armenian-populated enclave within Azerbaijan which for\nfive years has been fighting for independence from Baku in a war that has\nleft many thousands dead and uprooted hundreds of thousands from their homes. \n\nBoth Yerevan and Baku have always claimed that Russian servicemen stationed\nin these Caucasian republics, who were left behind after the break-up of the \nSoviet Union, are fighting as mercenaries in the Karabakh war. \n\nThe statement from Moscow said the Russian side repeatedly appealed to the\nAzerbaijani government to show humanity and leniency in their treatment of the\nsix men, and to hand them over to the Russian authorities. \n\nIt said that President Boris Yeltsin himself sent a letter with this request \nto his Azeri counterpart Elchibey. Itar-tass said that the soldiers' defense\nattorneys had lodged an appeal for clemency.

I don't have the faintest idea what literature it is to which you \nrefer. Is this an explicit statement by some document? Or is it your \ninterpretation of statements in such literature? Or is this a figment \nof your imagination or a Nazi Armenian propaganda movie script? In \nany case, a fascinating piece of analysis. Here are the facts:\n\n\nSource: Walker, Christopher: "Armenia: The Survival of a Nation."\n        New York (St. Martin's Press), 1980.\n\nThis generally pro-Armenian work contains the following information\nof direct relevance to the Nazi Holocaust: \n\na) Dro (the butcher), the former dictator of x-Soviet Armenia and the \narchitect of the genocide of 2.5 million Muslims, the most respected \nof Nazi Armenian leaders, established an Armenian Provisional Republic \nin Berlin during World War II; \n\nb) this 'provisional government' fully endorsed and espoused the social \ntheories of the Nazis, declared themselves and all Armenians to be members \nof the Aryan 'Super-Race;' \n\nc) they published an Anti-Semitic, racist journal, thereby aligning themselves \nwith the Nazis and their efforts to exterminate the Jews; and, \n\nd) they mobilized an Armenian Army of up to 30,000 members which fought side \nby side with the Wehrmacht.\n\n \nIn fact, by 1942, Nazi Armenians in Europe had established a vast \nnetwork of pro-German collaborators, that extended over two continents. \nThousands of Armenians were serving the German army and Waffen-SS in \nRussia and Western Europe. Armenians were involved in espionage and \nfifth-column activities for Hitler in the Balkans and Arabian Peninsula. \nThey were promised an 'independent' state under German 'protection' in \nan agreement signed by the 'Armenian National Council.' (A copy of \nthis agreement can be found in the 'Congressional Record,' November 1, \n1945; see Document 1.) On this side of the Atlantic, Nazi Armenians \nwere aware of their brethrens alliance. They had often expressed \npro-Nazi sentiments until America entered the war.\n\n\nIn 1941, while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi\nconcentration camps, the Nazi Armenians in Germany formed the first\nArmenian battalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion \nhad grown into eight battalions of 30,000-strong under the command of Dro \n(the butcher), who was the former dictator of x-Soviet Armenia and the \narchitect of the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds \nbetween 1914-1920. An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious \nDashnak Party leaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged \nby this, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed \nand espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the \nmembers of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of \nextermination of the Jews.\n\nThis Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an "encore"\nperformance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and\nexterminated 2.5 million Muslims by colluding with the invading Russian army.\n\n\nSerdar Argic
Our white knight for Islam rides in again! Our instant expert\non religion, race and ethnicity is at the door! Stand back all. Let \nhim through. He's going to single-handedly rescue Islam from all these\ndastardly mistakes, misquotes, misconceptions.
No wonder you clown are in such a mess. Let's take Sarkis Atamian's (an \nArmenian Dashnak sociolog) book, "The Armenian Community", pages 97 and \n105. Atamian quotes:\n\n "... the immediate question concerned itself with the organization and\n tactics of revolution. The liberation of Armenia, the immediate aim of\n the Party, was to be attained by:\n\n      1. Oral and written propaganda.\n      2. Terrorism - both as punishment against the enemy and as a measure\n         of self defense. \n      3. The creation of an avant-garde of revolutionary groups to be\n         equipped and prepared for action when other nations were prepared\n         for a general uprising.\n      4. The organization of larger committees to be in constant contact with\n         each other and subject to a central body.\n      5. Organization of units of guerilla fighters."\n\nNow, on page 105, Atamian's book quotes of Armenian constitution:\n\n "... If the means was revolution, how was the revolution to be attained?\n By:\n\n      1. Propaganda \n      2. Preparation of combat units and their indoctrination\n      3. Encouragement of the revolutionary morale of the people\n      4. The arming of the people\n      5. Organization of revolutionary committees\n      6. Espionage throughout the country and the exchange of information with\n         the official bodies and journals\n      7. Organization of financial zones for public collection \n      8. 'Fighting and using' the weapon of the terror on corrupt government\n         officers, spies, traitors, grafters, and all sorts of oppressors\n      9. Defense of the people against attacks from the brigandry\n     10. Building of roads for the transport of arms\n     11. Wrecking and looting of governmental institutions."\n\nMany of the recent Armenian terrorist acts against the Turkish people \nwere committed by the brainwashed members of the "Tzeghagron", namely, \n"race-worshipers" of the Dashnag Youth Organization. Ironically, again, \nTzeghagron was set up by an undisputed Armenian Nazi, Karekin Nejdeh,\nin 1941 (see Atamian, loc cit, page 389).\n\nSerdar Argic
I'm not sure about this but I hope the answer is that you can't apply under\nthe law of return.  By conversion, you've elected not to be a part of the\nJewish nation.\n\n\n\nAt the moment you converted, you officially anounced to the world that *you* do not\nconsider yourself to be part of the Jewish Nation.  So, why should the Jewish Nation\nconsider you to be a member?\n\n\n\nNo.  As a result of wars brought by the Arabs against the Jews in an attempt to\nannihilate Israel, the Arabs have lost their claim to land there.  Attacking Israel\nis/was illegal and they now have to pay the price.  Do I feel sorry for the\nPalestinians?  Yes I do.  But I blame the Arab nations for their problems, not\nIsrael.
The cases aren't really comparable.  A project like a freeway requires\npublic hearings, court action, appeals, advance determination of\nrestitution, and so on.  The razing of the Moghrabi district in East\nJerusalem happened within hours of the end of the hostilities of the 6\nDay War.  The residents were given only two or three hours' notice to\npack up and find accomodations elsewhere.  They had no chance of\npublic hearing, debate, appeal, negotiation or anything.  It was get\nout or die in the rubble.
(Re: the newsgroup -- followups set to talk.politics.mideast where this\nbelongs.)\n\nThis may make the term 'civil war' dubious, but it does nothing to the\nphrase 'destroy the government'. An occupying government is still a govern-\nment, and the Palestinians have made it quite clear that their goal is\nnot simply to prevent it from occupying the territories that don't con-\nfer citizenship (which is your own determination of the distinction) but\nto wipe it out entirely (and, not incidentally, the entire Jewish population\nit rules with it). This is an intent to 'destroy the government', no\nmatter where the government happens to be from.\n\n\nWasn't a requirement for democracy in Athens. For that matter, isn't\na requirement for the term democracy in the United States, which doesn't\nlet non-citizens vote either. Both the United States and Israel have\nprocesses whereby it is possible to acquire citizenship, with a great\ndeal of effort and a modicum of screening -- it's just that it isn't\nautomatic for living in the territories. It isn't automatic for living\nin New York, either.\n\nThat said, suit yourself. Having never considered democracy the ultimate\nin Good In This World, I could care less if you feel like calling Israel,\nor America, or anywhere else, a democracy. Personally, I withhold the\nterm from Israel for the same reason I withhold it from Britain... the\nparliamentary system is a serious handicap.\n\n\nAgain, suit yourself. In which case Israel is *not* attacking its own\npeople, it is fighting a war on foreign soil, in which case the residents\nare entitled to play rough, yes -- but Israel's allowed to get just as\nrough, within the bare limits of the rules of war. This includes, among\nother things, the right to shoot or bomb *anyone* a national of the coun-\ntry in question who is fighting them (which permits mass frontal assault\non all rock-throwers), along with the right to take out any installation\nof military importance (certain villages with too-good fortifications can\nbe handled by aerial bombing, as can waterways since they count as supply\nlines to the enemy), and the right to do anything whatsoever to whatever\nconstitutes a government that they can lay hands on (if Hamas is trying\nto set up as the ruling party, let them beware). \n\nIf this is not the scenario you want, I recommend you go back to calling\nit a civil war. Civil wars have to be handled nicer. You cannot say the\nPalestinians are a nation fighting a resistance war against a foreign\nnation and still call Israel a government who is treating its own people\ncruelly. If the Palestinians are fighting a war against a foreign country,\nso is Israel, and the gloves come *off*.\n\n	-Naomi
Owwww!!  Mr. Jefferson would be clearly disappointed in your designation of \nhim as author of the bill of rights.  And your reference to those\nin Israel was condesceding and inappropriate.\nThe Declaratio of Independence of 1776 was written by Thomas Jefferson.\nIn 1787, the Constitution was drafted by 55 men in Philadelphia.\nIn 1791, the Bill of Rights was added.  Well, maybe Jefferson\nwould be flattered.\n\nAs to you guys at UVA, your right, not all of you are anti-Jewish,\nor self-hating.  But when I visited Charlottesville, I noticed\na distinct lack of diversity, from which I must assume you garner\nyour inability to perceive the reality of the outside world.
Your doubts are unsubstantiated, have some faith in us..\n\n\n\n\nYes I agree..  Lets say I call my self a XXX.  I go and shoot your family \nin cold blood.  Does that mean that XXX is responsible? No.  I am.\nPeople tend to associate others with color/creed/etc.. it is a form of racism.
It is the Serbs who were divided when Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina \nattempted to secede from Yugoslavia, ripping more than 2,000,000 Serbs\nand their property out of Yugoslavia.  \n\nThe Croatian and Muslim nations had the right to secede, not the Republics.\nAdditionally, the secessions were to be negotiated, which would probably\nhave required international mediation; instead the secessions were illegal,\nunilateral, and acts of war against Yugoslavia and those who did not\nwant to be ripped out of Yugoslavia by the secessions.
Ok, you don't like what I have to say.  Would you care to\ndemonstrate how the above list, or any expanded version of it you\nchose to post, demonstrates fairness in the actions of the UN wrt\nIsrael?\n\n\n	You make the odd assumption that I read Israeli papers, not\nEuropean ones.  My main source of news is the Economist, a London\nbased magazine.\n\n	Also, I do on rare occaisons, read Arab papers, but its hard\nto find English language papers from Arab countries here.\n\n\n	Have I ever claimed to be objective?  I pointed out, with a 27\nitem list, that Israel is condemned for actions that other nations are\nnot condemned for.  You go off and attack me for reading only Israeli\nnewspapers.\n\n	If you'd like to debate this, please do.  If you'd like to\nmake ad hominum attacks, feel free to do that too.

It is also so easy to blame the West for their indiffernce to\nreal Bosnian suffering.  How about the moslem world, about 1 billion?\nHow about them ha?  What they are doing to stop this\nmassacre?  Why the oil rich Arab states make the Bosnian crises \na national interest of the West, especially for Europeans?  We all \nknow they can do it over night, don't we? Blaming West and asking \nwhy they don't put their life into danger seems to be the choice of \nmuslims too.  I think who is sleeping is not the West.  They are wide \nawake.  They are trying to save the face.
I guess that it was not acceptable because Germany *also* chose\n   a path of aggression simultaneously that put the interests of\n   other countries in peril. I wonder whether US or other countries\n   would have risked themselves if only Jews were persecuted and\n   Hitler had no imperialist ambitions. (I am no student of history\n   and I am just asking questions.)\n\nI don't think they would have.  After all the U.S. was one of the\ncountries that turned away Jewish refugees when there was still time\nto get them out.  (Considered and rejected at the Cabinet level then..)\n\n   ...\n   Under what conditions should US interfere in foregin countries,\n   is an abstraction one must clarify before resorting to acrimonious\n   accusations of religious bigotry and such.\n\nAs I understand it, International law provides the right of any\ncountry to intervene to prevent genocide.  I think once the World\nCourt has ruled that genocide is being committed... \n\nIf a Human Rights Czar is appointed at the U.N., we could have\ninternational monitors recording events and responses of local\nofficials and develop an objective basis.  This could be backed by\nadjudication at the International Court of Justice and enforcement\nthrough a Rapid Deployment Force under the U.N. Secretary General's\ncommand.  I would like to see the U.N.  directly impose ICJ rulings\nwhenever feasible (without the possibility of vetos at the UN Security\nCouncil.. much as the President can't veto a U.S. Supreme Court\nruling). \n \nThe U.S. is now supporting the effort to appoint the HR Czar -- the\nthird world opposition is led by three countries, China, Iran and\nPakistan (What company is Pakistan keeping!).  \n\nThe U.S. is also reconsidering its opposition to the U.N. force\ninitially envisaged in the Charter (although under the control of the\nSecurity Council).  The UN SC is quite a flawed body.  Rogue\ngovernments like the PRC have even threatened their veto in the last\nfew months to block the move to place U.N. troops in Bosnia under\nChapter 7 instead of 11 (if I have the numbers straight) where they\ncould have moved from being a monitoring to an enforcement force\nwithout requiring further SC action.  (The PRC even continues to\nthreaten using its veto on U.N. action despite the ICJ ruling.  The\ncurrent set-up requires the SC to enforce ICJ rulings..).\n\nPeace,
It is 'Serdar', 'kocaoglan'.\n\n\nJust love it. Well, it could be your head wasn't screwed on just right.\nIf that does ever happen, look out the window and see if there is a \nnon-fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government in the East.\n\n "In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists a single Turkish soul.\n  It is in our power to tear away the veil of illusion that some of us\n  create for ourselves.

This impressive change in the province's ethnic character \n notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian \n Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the \n southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia." \n (See also Map 1.

They ranged from the salt \n desert shores of the Caspian Sea far into the mighty Caucasus Mountains. \n Even the village Tartars are a primitive people, only semicivilized."\n\n"I can see now that we Armenians frankly despised the Tartars, and, while \n holding a disproportionate share of the wealth of the country, regarded and\n treated them as inferiors. The fact that the Russians looked down upon all\n Armenians in much the same way as Armenians regarded Tartars, far from proving\n a bond between ourselves and our racially different neighbors, intensified\n an attitude and conduct on our part that served only to exacerbate hostility."\n\np. 20 (second paragraph).\n\n"Our men armed themselves, gathered together and advanced on the Tartar\n section of the village. There were no lights in the houses and the doors\n were barred, for the Tartars suspected what as to happen and were in great \n fear.

A man evoking\n the displeasure of the government or of some official would be tried and\n condemned without arrest or preference of charges against him. The method \n of execution was for a government 'mauserist' to walk up behind the\n condemned man in his home or on the street, place a pistol to the back\n of his head and blow out his brains.

There were also bodies of the\n dead."\n\np. 204 (first paragraph).\n\n"I was soon asleep. In the night I was awakened by the persistent crying of\n a child. I arose and went to investigate. A full moon enabled me to make\n my way about and revealed to me all the wreck and litter of the tragedy\n that had been enacted. Guided by the child's crying, I entered the yard of\n a house, which I judged from its appearance must have been the home of a\n Turkish family. There in a corner of the yard I found a women dead.

Found this in soc.culture.pakistan\nMight be of interest..... am posting it without the permission of the original poster.\nHope he/she doesnt mind.\n\n\nBy Lance Gay, Scripps-Howard News Service\n \nSARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina -- In this land of historic hatreds, a tiny\nJewish community is braving Serbian shells to repay a 50-year-old debt to\nMuslims who saved Jews from the Holocaust.\n \nIvica Ceresnjes, president of the Jewish Community of Sarajevo, says he\nand about 1,000 other Jews chose to remain in Sarajevo, rather than leave\nfor Israel, to keep a feeding center in the medieval old town district\nrunning.\n \nCeresnjes said that was partly in gratitude to the Muslims who hid Jews during\nthe Nazi occupation and partly to keep intact the centuries-old presence of \nJews living in Sarajevo.\n \n``Some with guns are defending Bosnia, but I fight in Bosnia by keeping \npeople alive,'' Ceresnjes said.\n \nAs a student of Balkan history, Ceresnjes said he saw this war coming and \nhad ready plans to evacuate children and the elderly. A year before the war\nerupted here last April, Ceresnjes said the Jewish center began\nstockpiling supplies, ensuring everyone had passports and arranging for\nplaces in Israel and Europe for the evacuees.\n \nThey were so well prepared, he said, that only five days after the\nshooting began the first plane left. Of about 2,000 Jews in Bosnia-\nHerzegovina, he estimates half have left. Many of those who stayed behind\nwork in Sarajevo's downtown synagogue, which has been turned into a\nwartime feeding center that has so far given away 380,000 meals.\n \nThe center, which has been shelled several times along with most of\nSarajevo, also runs a radio station, mail center and distributes food\npackages sent by Jewish organizations around the world.\n \nWhile Muslims and Jews are fighting each other in the Mideast, Jews here\nsay there's a long tradition of cooperation, inter-marriage and\ntolerance between the two communities in Sarajevo that goes back to\ncenturies of Turkish occupation.\n \nSarajevo's Jews trace their ancestry back to their expulsion from Roman\nCatholic Spain in 1492. The community numbered more than 14,000 before\nWorld War II. But only 10% survived the Holocaust -- which was carried out\nby the pro-Nazi Croatian Ustache in Yugoslavia. Many of the survivors were\nhidden by Muslim families in Mostar.\n \n\n-- \nSharon Machlis Gartenberg\nFramingham, MA  USA\ne-mail: sharon@world.std.com\n\n\n----------------------------------------\nZafar.

Although I don't want to muddy the waters unnecessarily I disagree. Any\ndiscrimination based on religion is not and cannot be racist unless the\nsole qualification for religious membership is racial. This is not the\ncase for Israel although it might get a little closer than, say, Islam.\nThis of course raises the vexed question of Church AntiSemitism. Jews\nhave been heavily discriminated against on the grounds of religion in\nmany Christian countries. If we take Russia as an example Jews were\nseriously persecuted but that persecution in the eyes of the Church\nand State stopped at the baptismal font. Officially anyway. If a Jew\nconverted there were no legal barriers in his way (that I know of anyway.)\nPeter the Great's Interior Minister came from such a convert background.\nCan we then claim that the Russian Orthodox did not teach AntiSemitism\nand was not AntiSemitic? Similarly for the Roman Catholic Church? I\nsuspect so as this is not a racial 'taint' but one based on belief\nand AS is after all a form of racism. Well maybe not. What is\nAntiSemitism then if not something racially based? I wonder if Hitler\nkilled converts of 'pure' German blood. Does anyone know one way or\nthe other?\n\nJoseph Askew
There is no doubt that Israeli authorities ordered the destruction of\nmosques in the vicinity of the Wailing Wall. That does not mean,\nhowever, that once can generalize from this to any other points.  The\nentire plaza, mosques and all, was cleared to make it possible for Jews\nto have a place to worship in the place that was holiest to many of\nthem, and which had been denied to them for millenia.\n\nOn the other hand, throughout the rest of Jerusalem and Israel, to the\nbest of my knowledge, Israeli authorities have scrupulously avoided\ndamage to any Islamic religious sites. This contrasts with the policies\nof previous regimes which destroyed Jewish synagogues out of hate and\nbigotry.
Ah, but when you fire at armed folks they have this nasty habit of\nfiring back. A simple terrorist could get hurt that way.
What a dope!  There is no value for Mohammed Elabdellaoui to be here\nat a Western University.  Third-worldist and Islamic brain-rot has\nmade it impossible for him to acquire and analyze facts appropriately.\n\nThe history of the efforts of the Mufti of Jerusalem to serve the\nNazis in the South Balkans and set up Muslim SS Divisions is\nwell-documented.  In general, Nazism and the leader-principle\nresonated well among Muslim peoples.  Khomeini's concept of the faqih\nis a recent example of such resonance.  In fact, totalitarianism is\netymologically a reasonable translation Islam.\n\nTo be fair, the Mufti did not succeed in getting large numbers of\nMuslims to join the SS.  But the rather small Muslim SS unit did\nmanage to commit attrocities disproportionate to it size.  There were\nalso Muslim people who were less than enthusiastic about the attempt\nof Muslim leaders to entice Muslim people to serve the Nazi cause\nactively.  And the Turkish government ignored practically all Nazi\novertures even though an alliance with the Nazis against the Soviet\ngovernment would have made a great deal of tactical sense.\n\n			Last time I heard, the nazis prided themselves in\n\nYes, the typical primitive Muslim psychopathological psychotic\nbehavior upon hearing or reading a disagreeable fact -- start whining\nabout the Jews.  What a jerk.\n\n\nYou should go back to your mindlessly stupid 3rd world country.  Your\nbrain has no business in a civilized first world country.
If you look at the bottom of this article you will see that I have very\nkindly dug up one of Yigal Arens previous postings (entirely without his\npermission, I hope he doesn't mind) containing translations from Ha'arezt\ndetailing just such a case. Perhaps you think that Ha'arezt lies? Would\nyou like to provide me with an assurance that this practise *never* occurs?\n\n\nRight, Arabs have been voting in Israel for how long? And in all that time\nNOT ONE Arab EVER gained enough of a personal following to get his fellow\nparty members to put in a Ministry? This is about as likely as sprouting\nwings and flying to Rio. What basis do you have for explaining this odd\nfailure? You seem very confident that you are right, exactly how do you\nknow, why are you sure?\n\n\nExactly what basis do you have for saying this when the Labour party\nhas never put an Arab into a Cabinet post and insists its coalition\nmembers do the same? Why and on what basis are you reassuring me in\nthe face of 50 years of discriminatory practise?\n\n\nHey what?? As I said even when their party puts them up they get knocked\nback. It surely couldn't be because they are Arabs is it?\n\n\nWell yes, but Security is the reason most often given by people who\nwant to make excuses. I merely thought it would crop up and so\npre-empted it.\n\nStart of Article (All commets in [*....*] are mine not Dr. Arens)\n\n[Comments in square brackets are mine - Yigal]\n\n\nRacism in the Knesset\n---------------------\n\nCoalition requirements on one hand, and the presence of progressive MKs\nfrom _Meretz_ in the coalition on the other, have compelled Rabin and\nhis friends to change, to some extent, their attitude towards the Arab\npublic and their representatives in the Knesset.  Although he did refuse\nto view them as partners, taking part in the coalition and joining the\ngovernment, he did agree to meet with them and to give them a document\nof intentions which included a commitment to "work towards a decrease in\nthe discrimination between Jewish and Arab citizens".  [Decrease WHAT?!?!\nBut posters have told us time and again that such discrimination does\nnot exist *at* *all*!  Is Rabin, too, a closet self-hater??? - Yigal].\n\nHowever, racism has not disappeared.  When the Knesset sat to consider\nwho would staff its various committees, a request was made to put an MK\nfrom Hadash [the Communist party, one of the "Arab" parties - Yigal] on\nthe State Comptroller's Committee.  And oh, did that ever stir up a\nstorm -- including in the ranks of Labor -- since many Knesset members\nfind it unthinkable that an Arab MK sit on one of the important house\ncommittees.  "Security secrets" are liable to fall into their hands...\n\nThis attitude -- which until recently had not even aroused criticism,\nbeing so natural and so deeply-embossed upon people's hearts -- holds\nthat there are Knesset members who, despite having been elected by tens\nof thousands of votes, are not entitled to be full partners in the body\nwhich represents the people of Israel.  We are not speaking here of\npolitical discrimination -- which would be bad enough in itself -- but\nof racial discrimination.  The proof: one of the compromises proposed\nwas that MK Mahamid [an Arab - Yigal] should be replaced by Tamar\nGojanski [a Jew - Yigal] from the same party.  It was not the member's\nparty which was considered unfit, but his race...\n\n[* Here is a documented case in a respected Israeli newspaper. *]\n\nIt is worth noting that for the first time since the state's founding, a\npublic debate has arisen on this subject, as witness the following\narticle:\n\n\nA TEST OF SELF-CONFIDENCE\n\nBy Gid'on Levi, Ha'aretz, July 26, 1992\n\nRevelations of discrimination against Arabs have become such an integral\npart of our daily routine that there is not much effort made to deal\nwith them.  [Do you hear that, -----?  Please contact this Levi fellow\nand explain to him how little he knows about Israel.  Please! - Yigal].\nExcept that sometimes the demon bursts out from behind the government's\nwindow dressing, and then the phenomenon is seven times more serious.\n\nLast week provided two more such examples: the Israeli Knesset is\nfinding it very difficult to allow Arab representation on its more\nimportant committees; and Israel Television is finding it no less\ndifficult to give a platform to Arabs from the territories.  Seemingly\ntwo entirely different matters, but in fact they are one and the same.\n\nThe 13th Knesset proved last week that, even though one third of its\nmembers are new faces, it has not renewed its own face at all, at least\non one issue.  Parliamentary traditions may be modernized and\nparliamentary traditions may become obsolete, and only one tradition\nendures forever: no Arab shall set foot in the more important committees\nof the house.  There has never been and never will be an Arab MK on the\nExternal Affairs and Defense Committee or on the Finance Committee.\nWorlds have been overturned over the question of whether or not "to\ngive" Arabs, for the first time, a place on the State Comptroller's\nCommittee.\n\nThe arguments are old and well-known: In all three of the above\ncommittees innumerable secrets are revealed -- and woe unto us if an\nArab should hear them.  One must not make light of such arguments, but\ntheir significance should also not be exaggerated.  Every Arab MK is not\nspending all his time waiting for the opportune moment to hand over\ninformation from the Knesset committee room to Black Panther\nheadquarters in Jenin; and not all the aforementioned committees are\ncontinually occupied in the discussion of top-secret matters, which\ncould safely be revealed, for example, to MKs supportive of the Jewish\nUnderground, but not to an Arab MK from the Likud, Labor, or even from\nHadash.\n\nThe Arabs themselves would probably forego membership in the Subcommittee\non Secret Service Matters, but what would happen, one may ask, if MK\nNawaf Masalha were to hear, God forbid, a review of the Foreign Minister\nin an open meeting of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, or even\na review of the Army Chief of Staff which, in any case, are regularly\nleaked to the next edition of the news.  And what would happen if MK\nHashem Mahamid were to report on what he had seen with his own eyes at\nal-Najah?\n\nTheir non-participation [in important committees] and that of their\ncolleagues, creates an intolerable situation, where Arab members of the\nelected house have only semi-positions.  They are good enough for\naddressing plenary sessions, and for voting for or against the\ngovernment and participating in the deliberations of the Immigration and\nAbsorption Committee.  But they must not, for example, participate in\nthe process of formulating the state budget in the Finance Committee or\nin the allocation of resources to local authorities.  In any case, they\nhave little part in that.\n\nLabor's dependence on the support of the Arab parties has brought about\nsome improvement: MK Hashem Mahamid, will, it seems, participate in the\nState Comptroller's Committee.  Earlier, there had been a ridiculous\nattempt made to dictate to Hadash who their representative should be,\nand thus to prevent the Arab from entering this dubious holy-of-holies,\nbut it soon became clear that there was no legal or constitutional\nbacking for such a step.\n\nBut not to worry: even now the Jewish mind is contriving devices.  The\nnew Committee Chair, Roni Milo, has already announced that he will set up\nsubcommittees aplenty for his committee.  Thus he will decide where it\nis permissible for Mahamid to participate and where not.  A solution\nsuch as this could, by the way, also have been adopted for the rest of\nthe committees, thereby completely eliminating the fear of state secrets\nbeing leaked to the enemy and removing the stain of discrimination from\nthe Knesset.\n\n[. . .]\n\nEnd Article\n\nDo you accept that as documentation?\n\nJoseph Askew

The NY Times is in error. This is not simply my opinion; even the Arab sources\nthat I use do not make this claim. This, of course, is assuming that the NY\nTimes was refering to the islands that I named above. Of those islands, only\nAbu Musa has been in dispute and Iranian occupation of that island predates\nthe existence of the UAE.
Of course you do.  You married it a while ago, remember?
It is not a question of an individuals standing. When a party puts up an\nArab for a Cabinet post and that Arab is rejected but the position is given\nto a Jew from the same party we are not talking about power but racism.\nWould you care to deny this has happened on several occasions with Labour\ncoalitions?\n\n\nNot their party - them as *individuals*. Even when they belong to nice\npeaceful Zionist mainstream parties they are not welcome. Arabs are\nexcluded on ficitious security grounds which are just an excuse. It\nsure looks like racism to me.\n\nArabs are excluded from cabinet, even when they do the things you\nsuggest, because they are Arabs. Unless of course you have a better\nreason? I am happy to listen to any good reason why a leftist Jew\nis less of a security risk than a leftist Arab from the same party.\nLook at the present cabinet.\n\nJoseph Askew
Hmmm... what about the genocide conducted by the Ottoman Empire\naganist the Armenians living in Turkey.
Please explain how the removal of Israel from the eqation is going to\nease the situation in Iran, Iran/Iraq, Iraq, Iraq/Kuwait, Syria,\nLebanon, Libya, Algeria, Egypt, Sudan ...  Human rights, freedom of\npress and religion, slavery, government oppression in authoritarian\nsocieties  --  how are these going to be solved by removing Israel\nfrom the Middle East?
Dear Elias, \n\nI counted at least 4 such answers in public (plus whatever private\nemail replies you may have received), yet you refuse to accept\nanything.  Perhaps you are better off in the private world of the\n"Center for Policy Research" in Iceland where you can define\n"sensible" in whatever way makes you feel most comfortable.
this is true.\n\n\nthis has merit but is not entirely true.\n\nthis last statement is not true.  According to the CBO the United States\nhas a force of about 88,000 US Army personel in Europe, I do not know\nif this includes a USMC division in Norway.  They have available\na little more than 500 USAF attack aircraft, including various models\nof the F-111, A-10, F-19A/B,  and a few F-4s. {there are about 1,000\nmore of these available, SAFELY TUCKED AWAY AT HOME. At one time, the\nUS maintained 1500 MBTs {about half were M1A1} but some of these were\nrelocated to the Persian Gulf.  I know the US has at LEAST one \naircraft carrier battle group nearby and probably a marine assault\nbrigade.  Does anyone know if there are any B-52/B-1Bs in England?\n\nThe point is, although there are no US ground troops in Bosnia,\nit is not true that that all the american forces are safely camped\noutside of St. Louis.    \n\nI also understand that the administration is planning to position\ntroops in Macedonia.  Any reaction out there to this?\n\nQuestion:  day before yesterday I heard that Serbia & Montenegro\nhad imposed additional trade sanctions against the Bosnian Serb Rebels.\nThis morning a NPR reported at a bridge on the Drina (sp?) verified\nthat only a bread truck was allowed to pass through to Bosnia.\nA Serbian {who happened to be muslim}, stated that just a few months\nago no vehicle even slowed for the boarder station. Now everyone\nis stopped and searched, many are turned back.  Of course all I\nheard was a translators version, I do not speak Serbo-Croatian.\n\nIf this is a effort on the part of Serbia & Montenegro {for whatever reason}\nto push the Boserbs into accepting the V-O, is this not a good thing?
That operation was done by a small Jewish fraction BEFORE the state even\nexisted and, as far as I remember, was disaproved by most of the Jews.\n\nSaying that "He was killed by the Israelis" is plain wrong because there wasn't\n"Israel" at the time.\n\nAnd as far as the Jews liked the idea of having part of the land you can see\ntheir reaction to the UN resolution from 29 November,  and the Arab's reaction\ntoo  (no,  it wasn't that the Arabs danced in the streets with doznes of Jewish\nstates invading them but quite the other way around).\n\nBye,
Israeli nationalism (also known as Zionism) is the nationalism of the\nJewish people.  The Jewish people are not a new phenomenon at all.\n\nPalestinean nationalism is the nationalism of Arab people.  Arabs have\nbeen around for a long time.  They already  have some 2 dozen states,\nlarge and small, covering 98% of the Middle East.\n\nMore specifically, Palestinean nationalism is the nationalism of Arabs\nfrom the region of Palestine, just as Egyptian nationalism is the\nnationalism of Arabs from the region of Egypt.  One Palestinean state\nalready exists in what was once known as Palestine: - it is called\nJordan. \n\nThere is no justification in carving out a second and tiny Palestinean\nstate out of the only Jewish state, itself very, very small, just as\nthere is no justification in carving out another American state out of\nMexico.
What a lie..!!??\n\n     Ask the victims of the Nazis.\n     Don't take the Bosnian muslims' word for it.\n     Ask the Holoucost survivors who helped them, you will hear that\n     the Bosnian muslims (among others) helped them.\n\n     I also do object to the term ethnic cleansing, since what is happening\n     in Bosnia is not ethnic cleansing, they all have the same ethnicity,\n     what is different is religion. they are Orthodox christians, Catholic \n     christians, and Muslims.\n\n     It's religious cleansing.\n\n     Also watching people being rounded up and slaughtered by the slitting of \n     the throat, raped collectively and systematically, driven out of their\n     homes by the millions (!!!!), tortured in concentration camps, maimed\n     and ..... does indeed amount to moral rape.\n\n     Nothing in the history justifies what's happening.
Here is a press release from the White House.\n\n Text of President Clinton's Letter to Congress on Iranian Assets\n To: National Desk\n Contact: White House Press Office, 202-456-2100\n\n   WASHINGTON, May 14  -- Following is a letter\nPresident Clinton wrote to Congress on Iranian Assets:\n\n  TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:\n\n       I hereby report to the Congress on developments since the\n  last Presidential report on November 10, 1992, concerning the\n  national emergency with respect to Iran that was declared in\n  Executive Order No. 12170 of November 14, 1979, and matters\n  relating to Executive Order No. 12613 of October 29, 1987.\n  This report is submitted pursuant to section 204(c) of the\n  International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c),\n  and section 505(c) of the International Security and Development\n  Cooperation Act of 1985, 22 U.S.C. 2349aa-9(c).  This report\n  covers events through March 31, 1993.  The last report, dated\n  November 10, 1992, covered events through October 15, 1992.\n\n       1.  There have been no amendments to the Iranian\n  Transactions Regulations ("ITRs"), 31 CFR Part 560, or to the\n  Iranian Assets Control Regulations ("IACRs"), 31 CFR Part 535,\n  since the last report.\n\n       2.  The Office of Foreign Assets Control ("FAC") of the\n  Department of the Treasury continues to process applications\n  for import licenses under the ITRs.  However, as previously\n  reported, recent amendments to the ITRs have resulted in a\n  substantial decrease in the number of applications received\n  relating to the importation of nonfungible Iranian-origin goods.\n\n       During the reporting period, the Customs Service has\n  continued to effect numerous seizures of Iranian-origin\n  merchandise, primarily carpets, for violation of the import\n  prohibitions of the ITRs.  FAC and Customs Service investi-\n  gations of these violations have resulted in forfeiture actions\n  and the imposition of civil monetary penalties.  Additional\n  forfeiture and civil penalty actions are under review.\n\n       3.  The Iran-United States Claims Tribunal (the\n  "Tribunal"), established at The Hague pursuant to the Algiers\n  Accords, continues to make progress in arbitrating the claims\n  before it.  Since the last report, the Tribunal has rendered\n  12 awards, for a total of 545 awards.  Of that total, 367 have\n  been awards in favor of American claimants:  222 of these were\n  awards on agreed terms, authorizing and approving payment of\n  settlements negotiated by the parties, and 145 were decisions\n  adjudicated on the merits.  The Tribunal has issued 36 decisions\n  dismissing claims on the merits and 83 decisions dismissing\n  claims for jurisdictional reasons.  Of the 59 remaining awards,\n  3 approved the withdrawal of cases, and 56 were in favor of\n  Iranian claimants.  As of March 31, 1993, awards to successful\n  American claimants from the Security Account held by the\n  NV Settlement Bank stood at $2,340,072,357.77.\n\n       As of March 31, 1993, the Security Account has fallen\n  below the required balance of $500 million 36 times.  Iran has\n  periodically replenished the account, as required by the Algiers\n  Accords, by transferring funds from the separate account held by\n  the NV Settlement Bank in which interest on the Security Account\n  is deposited.  Iran has also replenished the account with the\n  proceeds from the sale of Iranian-origin oil imported into the\n  United States, pursuant to transactions licensed on a case-by-\n  case basis by FAC.  Iran has not, however, replenished the\n  account since the last oil sale deposit on October 8, 1992.\n  The aggregate amount that has been transferred from the Interest\n  Account to the Security Account is $874,472,986.47.  As of\n  March 31, 1993, the total amount in the Security Account was\n  $216,244,986.03, and the total amount in the Interest Account\n  was $8,638,133.15.\n\n       4.  The Tribunal continues to make progress in the\n  arbitration of claims of U.S. nationals for $250,000.00 or more.\n  Since the last report, nine large claims have been decided.\n  More than 85 percent of the nonbank claims have now been\n  disposed of through adjudication, settlement, or voluntary\n  withdrawal, leaving 76 such claims on the docket.  The larger\n  claims, the resolution of which has been slowed by their\n  complexity, are finally being resolved, sometimes with sizable\n  awards to the U.S. claimants.  For example, two claimants were\n  awarded more than $130 million each by the Tribunal in October\n  1992.\n\n       5.  As anticipated by the May 13, 1990, agreement settling\n  the claims of U.S. nationals for less than $250,000.00, the\n  Foreign Claims Settlement Commission ("FCSC") has continued its\n  review of 3,112 claims.  The FCSC has issued decisions in\n  1,201 claims, for total awards of more than $22 million.  The\n  FCSC expects to complete its adjudication of the remaining\n  claims in early 1994.\n\n       6.  In coordination with concerned Government agencies,\n  the Department of State continues to present United States\n  Government claims against Iran, as well as responses by the\n  United States Government to claims brought against it by Iran.\n  In November 1992, the United States filed 25 volumes of\n  supporting information in case B/1 (Claims 2 & 3), Iran's claim\n  against the United States for damages relating to its Foreign\n  Military Sales Program.  In February of this year, the United\n  States participated in a daylong prehearing conference in\n several other cases involving military equipment.  Iran also\n  filed a new interpretative dispute alleging that the failure\n  of U.S. courts to enforce an award against a U.S. corporation\n  violated the Algiers Accords.\n\n       7.  As reported in November, Jose Maria Ruda, President of\n  the Tribunal, tendered his resignation on October 2, 1992.  No\n  successor has yet been named.  Judge Ruda's resignation will\n  take effect as soon as a successor becomes available to take up\n  his duties.\n\n       8.  The situation reviewed above continues to involve\n  important diplomatic, financial, and legal interests of the\n  United States and its nationals.  Iran's policy behavior\n  presents challenges to the national security and foreign\n  policy of the United States.  The IACRs issued pursuant to\n  Executive Order No. 12170 continue to play an important role\n  in structuring our relationship with Iran and in enabling\n  the United States to implement properly the Algiers Accords.\n  Similarly, the ITRs issued pursuant to Executive Order No. 12613\n  continue to advance important objectives in combatting inter-\n  national terrorism.  I shall exercise the powers at my disposal\n  to deal with these problems and will report periodically to the\n  Congress on significant developments.\n\n\n                         WILLIAM J. CLINTON\n\n\n  THE WHITE HOUSE,\n      May 14, 1993.\n\n -30-

According to the NY Times, the 4 islands "belong[] to the United Arab\nEmirates." \n\n\nWhy is it, then, that when the British, Iranians and UAE refer to\nOccupied Territory, they mean territory in dispute in Israel but not\nin their own affairs?
Repeat a lie often enough and people will start to believe it, eh?\n\nThe Hamas terrorists were given the opportunity to appeal.

Their refusal speaks for itself.
Can someone elaborate a little on what this "Libertarian" movement is? I\nam not going to draw conclusions from a small sample, but so far I\nrecall two self-described "Libertarians" posting here. Both seems to be:\n\n1) Incredibly ignorant.\n2) Incredibly arrogant.\n3) All they want is to get people angry.\n4) Posses a lousy sense of humor.\n5) write incoherently and jump from topic to topic without any logical\n   connection between topics.\n6) Describe themselves as intelligent and knowledgeable, although everything\n   in their posters points to the opposite.\n7) Very childish.\n\nIs this some campaign to smear this Libertarian party or what?
Let me remind all of those Muslim-haters out there who like to\nmention the Mufti's cooperation with Germany as a reason to let Muslims\nbe slaughtered everywhere in the world of the following facts:\n\n1)Why blame the Muslims for what the Nazis did and FORGIVE ITALY, THE CROATS,\nAND MANY OTHER EUROPEANS FOR BEING REAL ALLIES TO HITLER?\n\n2)Why blame Muslims for supporting Germany the enemy of their enemy\nat the time (Britain who colonized most of the middle east and was responsible\nfor most atrocities against Muslims in the region) and FORGIVE GERMANY ITSELF\nEVENTHOUGH IT IS THE ONE WHO CREATED NAZISM?\n\n3)As far as Muslims are concerned : THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN\nNAZI GERMANY, AND ANTIMUSLIM COLONIALIST BRITAIN/FRANCE IN 1940. They were\nall racist, anti-arab, and full of arrogance and hate. WWII and the wars \nin ALgeria, Sudan, and other places proved that very clearly. Even anti-\nsemitism was not more spread in Germany than in France or Britain, it just\nhappened to be official policy in Germany.\n\nAnd we will forgive you, just set our countries free.

As "Azerbaijan" newspaper informs, the issue of attraction\nof western investments in Azerbaijan was discussed in the meeting. In\nparticular, Gulyiev stated that western capital has to be investigated in\nthe most profitable spheres of manufacture. He also noticed, that the number\nof the priority manufactures will be released from debts. \nGuliyev also said that intensifying the activities of the American oil \ncompanies will promote the strengthening of the American-Azeri relations.\n\n\nTHE PROPOSAL TO SUMMON SPECIAL SESSION OF THE SUPREME SOVIET IS REJECTED AGAIN\n\n   Baku (May 19) Turan: Yesterday, in the sitting of the Milli Mejlis,\nthe chairman, Isa Gambar, rejected the proposal of the deputy Arif\nRahimzade to summon a special session of the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan.\n  This written proposal to summon a session was signed by 130 deputates. But\nthe chairman said that the signatures were invalid and the proposal couldn't\nbe submitted for discussion.\n   Earlier, the leadership of the Milli Mejlis called the proposal to summon\na special session of the Supreme Soviet a coup attempt. But the deputy for\nthe Parliament, Rahimzade, doesn't consider that the deputates have the \nobjective of removing Milli Mejlis and its chairman from the power. It concerns the\nserious analysis of the social, economic and foreign policy activity of the\nrepublic's authority. Rahimzade said that the deputates for the Parliament,\nejected from their duties one year ago have the rights to express their opinion\non these questions.\n   The Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan (340 deputates) was dissolved one year ago,\nwhen it attempted to bring Ayaz Mutalibov back to the power.\n   The functions of S.S. were handed over to Milli Mejlis, consisting of 50\ndeputates (25 "democrats" and 25 "partocrates"). At that time "democrats" and\n"partocrates" came to an agreement that Milli Mejlis wouldn't exist for a long \ntime and would be dissolved after parliamentary elections. At the same time,\nthe deputates ejected from their duties were guaranteed that they could summon\na session of the Supreme Soviet any time and went in for political activity out\nof the Parliament. --0--\n\n\nTHE PROSPECTS OF TRADE/ECONOMIC COOPERATION BETWEEN AZERBAIJAN AND ESTONIA\n\n    Baku (May 19) Turan: The prospects of signing trade-economic agreement\nbetween Azerbaijan and Estonia were discussed in the meeting of the Foreign \nMinister Tofig Gasimov with the group of experts of the Ministry of Economics,\nMinister of Foreign Affairs and Estonian Bank administration on May 18. \nThe group of experts is headed by Tikht Reiman, the chief of the Ministry of\nEconomics of Estonia.\n   The MIA of Azerbaijan informed Turan agency, that in their stay in Baku,\nthe delegation will also visit Ministry of Economics and National Bank of the\nrepublic.--0--\n\n\nAZERBAIJAN DOES NOT INTEND TO JOIN THE CIS COMMON ECONOMIC ZONE\n\n   Baku (May 19) Turan: Deputy prime-ministers of the republic, Vahid\nAhmedov and Abbas Abbasov declared that Azerbaijan wouldn't join the CIS\ncommon economic zone.\n   Vahid Ahmedov considers that the CIS economic zone proposal to create a \ncommon tax system contradicts independent economic policy of the republic. \nAccording to Abbas Abbasov, the pact of cooperation proposals, submitted for\nthe discussion of the leaders of CIS states in Moscow on May 14, has a number\nof unfavorable points for Azerbaijan.\n   Such announcements of two deputy prime-ministers sound sensational on the\nbackground of the fact that the president of Azerbaijan and the chairman of\nthe Parliament noted the necessity of the republic on joining the CIS economic\nzone.--0--\n\n\nTHE QUESTIONS OF GRANTING CREDIT TO AZERBAIJAN WILL BE DISCUSSED IN MOSCOW\n\n     Baku (May 19) Turan: Today, Azerbaijani delegation headed by the director\nof the foreign relation department of the Ministry of Finance of the republic\nalong with the representatives of the National Bank will leave for Moscow to\nhold consultation with Russian government on granting credit to Azerbaijan. \nAccording to the preliminary information, the credit will be 50 billion rubles.\n    As press-centre of Ministry of Finance informed Turan's correspondent, \nprecise amount of the credit, conditions of its repay and a number of other\nquestions of mutual interest will be discussed in the course of the meeting in\nMoscow. It is known that this credit will be mostly used for mutual settling\nof industrial enterprises of Azerbaijan and Russia.\n    When the sides reach the agreement, it is proposed for signing by the end \nof May.--0--\n\n\nAZERBAIJAN WILL REPLY TO THE SECOND VARIANT OF TRILATERAL INITIATIVE BY 26 OF\nMAY\n\n     Baku (May 19) Turan: On the measures for peace presented by Russia,\nTurkey and the USA to Azerbaijan and Armenia, the representative of the\npresident of Azerbaijan in the talks on Nagorno-Karabakh, Asim Gasimov noted\nthat the plan was not seriously changed in comparison with the first variant.\n     "Just some comments to several points were added to the schedule by \ninsistence of the Armenian side. We do not intend to come back to the analysis\nof the schedule, because we have given a positive answer to it on May 6",- said\nGasimov.\n     The representative of the president of Azerbaijan informed that they just\nbegan to work on the examination of the commentary, and their answer would be \ngiven as requested by the authors of trilateral initiative by May 26.\n     As it is known, the first variant of the peace measures was rejected by\nArmenia, which put forward a number of pre-conditions for its acceptance.--0--\n\n\nTHE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE PROSECUTOR OF THE REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN\n\n   BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: The Azerbaijani prosecutor's office has announced\nthat the Russian mass media's attempt to portray the 6 Russian soldiers \ncondemned by the military board of the Azerbaijani Supreme Court, as innocent\npeople is unjustified.\n    Accounts of the witnesses and the confessions of the condemned themselves,\nprove that their crimes were committed together with the Armenian military units\nand with the knowledge of the headquarters of the Russian army unit, where they\nserved.\n    The announcement points out that the attempts to represent these soldiers\nas ordinary mercenaries who have nothing to do with the Russian army are also \nunfounded. For there are irrefutable evidences that these soldiers were on the\nlist of one of the military unit's of Russian commandos in Yerevan.\n   Certain Russian circles try to conceal the fact of direct participation of\nthe Russian army in the undeclared war of Armenia against Azerbaijan from the\nRussian community. Azerbaijan's prosecutor's announcement follows, that this\ntype of actions can make the situation in the region much more complicated.--0--\n\n\nAZERBAIJAN'S PARLIAMENT INTENDS TO APPEAL TO RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT REGARDING THE\nSIX ACCUSED SOLDIERS\n\n     BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: As Turan agency was informed, parliament of Azerbaijan\nis considering the question of appealing to Russian parliament about the six\naccused soldiers' fortune. In particular, the offer to send the representatives\nof the Commission on military affairs of the armed forces of Russian Federation\nto Baku for the detailed study of the results of six Russian soldiers' case will\nbe directed to Russian parliament.\n     According to one of the supporters of this offer, such initiative will give\nRussian parliament the possibility to be convinced of the correctness of the\ninvestigation. There will also be a chance to discuss the reasons that have\ngiven rise to the present situation - that is the Russian troops participation\nin the war against Azerbaijan.\n\n\nARMENIANS ARE PREPARING MORE "KARABAKHS" ON THE NORTH CAUCASUS\n\n     BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: The National-liberation front founded by group of \nArmenians living on the North Caucasus appealed to establish Armenian autonomies\non the territories of Rostov, Stavropol and Krasnodar regions, - reported the\nnewspaper "Russky vestnik" on March 9, 1993 published in Geneva.\n     The North Caucasus is regarded as an integral part of Armenia in the \ndocuments of this organization. Admitting the non-realizability of "reunion" of\nthe North Caucasus and "Armenia proper" at present, the front is appealing to \nthe UN, presidents of Russia, Armenia and the United States to consider the\nneed to establish Armenian autonomies on the Caucasus.\n     To attain these goals, the Armenian organization considers it necessary to\ncarry out on the North Caucasus the forms and methods of activity "identical to\nthose in Nagorno Karabakh". Besides the decision to fund cells of Armenian\nnational-liberation fronts in every settlement and to appeal to leaders of\nArmenian terrorist groups in Greece and Iran to sent to the North Caucasus \ninstructors for training of Armenian youth to wage secret wars was adopted.\n     Thus according to the newspaper "Russky vestnik", "new Karabakhs" are \nbeing planning on the North Caucasus. --O--\n\n\nSTATE ASSISTANCE FOR NATIONAL MINORITY DEVELOPMENT\n\n     BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: The meeting headed by the State secretary of\nAzerbaijan, Ali Kerimov, with the participation of the national cultural\ncenters was held in Baku. The first results of the realization of the president\nElchibey's decree on state assistance for the development of language and\nculture of national minorities adopted on September 16, 1992 were considered. \n     The State secretary called this decree as an important step to establish a\nlegal democratic state. He confirmed once more the commitment of the leadership\nof Azerbaijan to set up a democratic society in which the rights of all \nnationalities and ethnic groups would be respected.\n     The State Counsellor of the president of Azerbaijan on the national policy,\nHidayat Orujev, announced that in spite of the difficulties of the "undeclared\nwar" against the republic, the leaders of the state managed to solve many \nproblems concerning the satisfaction of cultural and other needs of the ethnic\ngroups. \n     For today, all 33 national-cultural centers registered by the Ministry of\nJustice in the capital of Azerbaijan are provided with accommodation, furniture \nand means of communication. All the accommodations are rent-free ( 8 foreign\ndiplomatic missions in Baku are placed in the hotels because of the absence of\nfree accommodations including the representation of the UN General secretary). \n     As it was noted, a great work was carried out since the decree was adopted\nto create conditions for total development of the ethnic groups. On the North of\nAzerbaijan where Lezghins live, a national Lezghin theater was opened, \nradiocast is transmitted in Lezghin. The work over the creation of the\neducational literature for Talyshs, Tats, Lezghins and Kurds and national\nteaching and scientific staff is being carried out in the Academy of Sciences\nof Azerbaijan.--O-- \n\n\nMEMORANDUM OF COOPERATION ON EXTRACTING OIL-GAS FIELDS OF AZERBAIJAN WAS SIGNED\n\n     BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: As Turan agency was informed in the State \nconcern "Azerineft", the Memorandum of understanding with the companies\n"AMOCO Caspian Sea Petroleum", "Bi-Pi Exploration Operating", "Pennzoil\nCaspian", "Unocal Khazar Ltd.", "McDermott" and Turkish oil corporation on\nmutual extracting of fields "Azeri", "Chirag" and "Gyuneshli" was signed. \nAccording to the memorandum, the general group on preparing of a common\nprogram of activity was created. \n     According to the president of "Azerineft", Sabit Bagirov, cooperation\nwill provide for using the experience of foreign companies more efficiently. \n     During the project, the main principles will be the effective use of\noil-gas resources, the rational sharing of investments, the reducing of\nexploitation expenditures and maximizing the profit of Azerbaijan from the\nexploitation of these fields. \nThe memorandum also envisions the necessity to take into account the historical\nand political-economical interests of Azerbaijan under optimum use of oil-gas\nfields. --O--\n\n\nARMENIA TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE PROSECUTION OF SIX RUSSIAN SOLDIERS\n\n     BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: After Azerbaijani court passed sentence on \nsix Russian soldiers fighting on the Armenian side in Karabakh,\nArmenian propaganda has become actively involved.\n     The Armenians living in Russia appealed to the president Yeltsin\nwith a request "to display firmness in asserting the rights of Russian\nsoldiers". At the same time, Armenian mass media call legal proceedings\non the case in Baku as "a farce aimed at getting more arms from Russia".\n     The Karabakh Armenians have issued a threat recently. If one could\nbelieve the Yerevan agency "Snark", the Armenians in Karabakh presented\nan ultimatum to authorities in Azerbaijan. The essence of this ultimatum\nis that if Russian soldiers are not shown mercy, three Azeri prisoners in\nKarabakh will be shot dead.\n     It is simple to explain such "touching attitude of Armenians" to\nthe six Russian soldiers' fate. If by chance the sentence is executed\nit will cause not anti-Azeri but anti-Armenian reaction, as the accused\nRussian soldiers were recruited in Yerevan by the former Defence Minister\nof Armenia and then transferred to Karabakh.\n     If the soldiers get mercy, Armenian side will think highly of its\nsaving of lives of "innocent Russians". --O--\n\n\nNEW PROVOCATIONS OF ARMED FORCES OF ARMENIA\n\n     BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: According to the Defence Ministry of\nAzerbaijan on May 20-21, the firing on the territories of Azerbaijan\nfrom the military bases on the territory of Armenia was in progress.\n     The day before, the villages of Kolly-Gyshlag, Shotaraz,\nNyachaflar of Zangelan district of Azerbaijan were under fire from\nKafan district of Armenia. Two inhabitants were wounded, there were\ndestructions in the villages.\n     On May 20, the firing on the villages of Bashkend, Mutudere,\nShynykh, Novosaratovka and Novoivanovka of Kedabek district of\nAzerbaijan from the positions of Armenian armed forces was in\nprogress.\n     At the same day the diversion group of the armed forces of\nArmenia (50-60 men) violated the frontier of Azerbaijan, penetrated\ninto the territory of Kedabek district of Azerbaijan, killed two\nshepherds at the village of Aili-Dara and made an attempt to take a\nflock across the frontier. Azeri frontier-guards stopped the enemy.--O--\n\n\n"UNOCAL" COMPANY WILL BUILD 50 HOUSES FOR REFUGEES IN AZERBAIJAN\n\n     BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: As Turan agency was informed by the\nrepresentation of UNOCAL American oil company, the leaders of this\ncompany decided to give 750 thousand dollars for the construction of\n50 houses for refugees.\n     At present, the American side suggested a village project for \nconsideration by appropriate departments of Azerbaijan. The project\nis a farm village where each house has a personal lot, subsidiary\naccommodations and so on.\n     According to the program the construction and putting into\noperation of the village will be this year. --O--\n\n\nMANAT IS BEGINNING TO FALL IN VALUE\n\n     BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: Lately, at the black market of Baku, the\nnational currency - Manat, fell in price compared with the Russian\nRuble. Thus one gives 1100 Rubles or 120 Manats for one US dollar.\nTaking into account the official exchange-value of the Manat with \nrespect to Ruble which is 1-10, the national currency fell in value\n10 percent. Meanwhile the exchange-value of the Manat to the Ruble is\nthe same at banks, state establishments and in trade.\n     According to the representatives of the business circles and\nexperts, the present situation is explained by the fact that the rubles\nare bought by the local businessmen. They need rubles for financial\noperations in Russia. As the remittance of payments from the republics\nof the former USSR to Russia is a great problem now, many businessmen\narrange deals in cash. Taking into consideration the volume of business \nwith Russia, counted by billions, it is not hard to imagine how much \nRubles in cash the businessmen need. --O--\n\n\nTHE DISCUSSION OF PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION BILL WILL LAST TILL MID JULY\n\n    Baku (May 22) Turan: According to the president's decree, the\nexpert group, including representatives of the Parliament and \npresidential apparatus, are working out new wording of the Constitution\nof the Republic of Azerbaijan. This must be adopted by Milli Mejlis before\nthe Parliamentary elections. Together with this, the work on the new\nConstitution, that would be, evidently, adopted by new Parliament of\nthe country, is going on. The newsmen were informed about the work on the\npress-conference of the Supreme Soviet of the republic the day before.\n    Parliamentary legal experts, Safa Mirzoyev, Simran Hasanov and \nrepresentatives of the department of the president's apparatus Fazil Mustafaev\nand Shahin Aliev took part in the press-conference.\n    The national discussion of the project of the Parliamentary\nelection law is going on at present. According to Simran Hasanov the bill\ndidn't cause any objections. It was noted, that until now, no alternative\nvariant of the election law was put forward.\n   The newsmen were also informed, that Parliamentary commissions\nwill examine all coming proposals till June 10. By June 15 all\nproposals will be generalized and submitted for discussion in Milli Mejlis.--0--\n\n\nISA GAMBAR SUGGESTS THAT AZERI-RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT COMMISSION FOR \nCLARIFYING THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CRIMINAL CASE BE CREATED\n\n   BAKU (MAY 22) TURAN: The Chairman of the Milly Mejlis of the\nAzerbaijan republic, Isa Gambar, sent the return letter to the Chairman\nof the Russian Supreme Soviet Ruslan Khasbulatov in connection with\nthe conviction of the Russian servicemen lieutenant V.Semion, sergeant\nK. Tukish, M.Lisov and A.Filipov by the military college of the\nSupreme Court of Azerbaijan.\n   In his letter, Isa Gambar suggested that the commission of Azerbaijan\nMilly Mejlis deputates on a par with the experts of the Russian Supreme\nSoviet be established to clarify the circumstances of this criminal\ncase. In his view, "the conclusion of the commission could help in the \nobjective solving of this problem, as well as such kind of problems\nin the future. But the main thing is, it could help to promote the\nknowledge about involvement of the Russian servicemen in crime".\n   In its turn, in connection with the Russian parliament message,\nMilly Mejlis adopted a resolution on May 19, according to which the\npermanent commissions on government building and legal policy, human\nrights and international relations are charged with the exploration of\nthis problem.--0--\n\n\nWILL THE TRILATERAL INITIATIVE BE RUINED?\n\n      Baku (May 22) Turan: As Turan agency was informed, Russian representative\nto the talks on Karabakh, Vladimir Kazimirov, doubted in realization of the \nTrilateral initiative. He expressed this opinion during a telephone talk with\nthe representatives of Azerbaijan. At the same talk he declared, that in case\nthe peace process deadlocked, Russia would pursue Yeltsin's initiative itself.\n     Such statement from the Russian diplomat, who is one of the authors\nof the Trilateral initiative, suggests that the Russian leadership is\npaving the way for complete exclusion of the USA and probably Turkey from\nthe peacemaking process. This statement can also mean, that Russia and\nUS having achieved understanding on Bosnian problem, have agreed on partial\nUS departure from Transcaucasia.--0--\n\n\nFATE OF 645 MILLION TONS OF OIL WILL BE DECIDED THIS SUMMER\n\n   Baku (May 22) Turan: The president of Azerbaijan State Oil Company,\nSabit Bagirov, declared recently that complete treaty on development of\noil fields Chirag, Azeri and Guneshli would be signed this summer.\nAs it is known, western oil companies AMOCO, BP-STATOIL, PENNZOIL-\nRAMCO have an interest on development of these three richest Caspian\nfields.\n   According to the plan, SOCAR and BP-STATOIL are to sign a complete\ntreaty on development of Chirag field on June 16. Later AMOCO and\nPENNZOIL will sign treaties.\n   Specialists value total reserves of these three fields to be 645\nmillion ton. 310 million of them fall on Azeri field, 180 mln.ton\non Geneshli and 150 mln.ton on Chirag.\n   The exploitation of these fields is to last tens of years and it is to\nbring in Azerbaijan 100 billion dollars in revenue. In addition to the net\neconomic profit, Baku calculates upon the political support of the West in\nthe defence of its interests at the international scene.\n   As president Elchibey said in his closest encirclement "the May of\n1993 will be one of the most difficult periods for Azerbaijan and its\nindependence and we have to stand these tests".--0--\n\nTHE SCIENTIST-LAWYERS OF RUSSIA APPEALED TO THE PRESIDENT OF AZERBAIJAN\n\n   BAKU (MAY 22) TURAN: As the press-service of the president of Azerbaijan\ninforms, today, the appeal of the Institute of the Government and law of the\nRussian Academy of Sciences to president Elchibey was received.\nThe appeal contains the call "to display mercy, humanism and clemency \non the death sentences of the former servicemen of the Russian Armed\nForces".\n   The authors of the appeal point out, that they don't justify the\nparticipation of the Russian servicemen in the war against the azeri people,\ndon't call in question the lawfulness of the passed sentence, denounce\nthe mercenary according to the UN principals, and they are sorry about the\nRussian servicemen being drawn in such grave crime.\n    At the end of their letter, scientists, mentioning the soldiers'\nmothers' tears and grief, their praying day and night of safety, ask the\npresident of Azerbaijan to "save those guys".\n   It should be noticed, that unlike lawyers, soldiers' mothers,\ntaking part in the inquiry, called the cause of their grief only\nRussian policy. According to their words, the leaders, that lay down\nlives of Russian men to achieve their political aims, must be made\nanswerable.\n    Unfortunately, the appeal didn't mention the grief of the mothers\nof Azerbaijani soldiers, killed by sentenced Russian servicemen.--0--\n\n\nARMENIAN ARTILLERY CONTINUES FIRING ON AZERI DISTRICTS\n\n     BAKU (MAY 22) TURAN: On May 22, two soldiers of National army of\nAzerbaijan were killed during the "Grad" shelling of the villages of\nKolly Gyshlag, Shaifly, Shotaraz, Nyachaflar of Zangelan district of\nthe republic from the territory of Kafan district of Armenia.\n     The night before and in the morning of May 22, the villages of\nTovuz, Gazakh and Gubatly districts of Azerbaijan were under fire\nfrom the territory of Armenia. There are destructions. \n     The situation in Agder district of Azerbaijan became complicated. \nOn May 21, the enemy fired on the regional centre of Agdere from the\nvillage of Ortakend. The transportation of man power and military equipment\nto this district is in progress. According to reports the enemy is setting\nup a new weapon emplacement to fire on the regional centre and near by\nvillages.\n     According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the concentration\nof man power and military equipment is observed in Krasnoselsky\ndistrict of Armenia which borders on Azerbaijan as well as on the\nfrontier with Fizuli district. --O--\n\n\nAZERI PRIME-MINISTER IS LEAVING FOR GREAT BRITAIN\n\n  BAKU ( MAY 22 ) TURAN : The Minister of Foreign Economic Relations,\nRauf Garayev, in his interview to Turan agency said, that\n"Great Britain is the biggest foreign economic partner of Azerbaijan\nafter Iran". The business cooperation between the two countries\ndevelops in such spheres as oil - industry, the manufacture of oil\nextraction equipment, communication and agriculture.\n  According to the Minister's words, the forthcoming visit of\nAzerbaijani Prime-Minister, Panah Huseynov, to Great Britain on May\n23-24, is very important. It is expected, that the visit will\nhelp, to solve the problems of opening in Azerbaijan the branch\noffices of some British banks, insurance firms; to conclude\ncontracts on the sphere of manufacture of agricultural equipment; on\nbuilding in Azerbaijan off shore oil platforms, and reconstruction of the\nentire communication system of Azerbaijan.\n   In Garayev's view, the expansion of the cooperation with Great Britain\nwill have a great political meaning for Azerbaijan.\n   According to politicians and reviewers in Baku, at present, Great\nBritain as an European state is close to Azerbaijan. The continuation of\nthe economic and political cooperation of the two states is foreseen. --O--\n\n           \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \n             T U R A N    N E W S    A G E N C Y\n                     Baku - Azerbaijan      \n                Phone: (8922) 66-7977  66-7833\n                    Fax: (8922) 66-2009\n                   Telex: 142168 META SU\n           \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n                  \nSerdar Argic

These comments however make\nme long for the days when I was a flame warrior.  I would hope that you would\nrefrain from such idiotic slander.   \n\n\nWinslow (formerly of Madison)\n\nP.S.  I might have to drop the formerly and become the "old"  Winslow of Madison.
I agree with you Harry, however you must also concede then that\nArab terrorism is also a tragedy of war.  remember that the\nPalestinians have no other effective target but civilians in\norder to further their cause.  If Irgun had to attack civilian\ntargets to terrorize in order that they might obtain some\nobjective, I'm sure they would have done so.  I also don't\nexclude Irgun's action against British soldiers as terrorism.\nThe British were showing signs of favoring a compromise with\nregards to Palestine, and the Irgun and branch off groups made\na point to kill young British recruits so that mothers and\nfathers back in Britain would get angry at Britains continued\npresence in Palestine.  Sounds like a form of terrorism to me,\nand not much removed from Arab terrorism.  We must not also\nforget that Irgun, or Irgun branch off groups [more likely]\nkilled many jews who were not as hardline zionist as they, or\nwho cooperated with the British.  \n	I'll reiterate again.... both sides are screwy, but\nI'll favor the underdog in this case because I do think they\nwere a bit screwed.
Yea, I think not also. Israel's #1 issue is "Security" so *any* outcomes\nof "negotiation" certainly need to address ISREAL'S perception of this\nissue.\n\nThe problem is is defining (by "outsiders", by Israel, and by the Arabs\nthemselves) what is the #1 issue to the Arab side. Is it "Palestinian\nstatehood", is it that Israel as a state should not and must not be\nallowed to exist, is it that the existence of a self-governing non-\nmuslim "state" in the "Islamic World" is intolerable...what? Just as\nthe dividing line between Israel-fighting-for-security and Israel-fighting-\nto-expand is often hard to discern by "outsiders" (especially to the Arab \nworld), so the rationale behind the Arab-struggle-to-undermine-Israel-in-\nany-way could either be based on visceral rejectionism or a sense of being\nwronged that still values peace, who knows which. \n\nAnyway, in these talks, what "gestures" would you think would be seen\nby Israel as "substantial"?
Come again? The image-conscious Armenians sorely feel a missing \nglory in their background. Armenians have never achieved statehood \nand independence, they have always been subservient, and engaged \nin undermining schemes against their rulers. They committed \ngenocide against the Muslim populations of Eastern Anatolia \nand x-Soviet Armenia before and during World War I and fully \nparticipated in the extermination of the European Jewry \nduring World War II. Belligerence, genocide, back-stabbing, \nrebelliousness and disloyalty have been the hallmarks of the \nArmenian history. To obliterate these episodes the Armenians \nengaged in tailoring history to suit their whims. In this zeal \nthey tried to cover up the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million \nTurks and Kurds before and during World War I.\n\nAnd the justice is long overdue.\n\n\nSource: Documents: Volume I (1919).\n        "Document No: 50," Archive No: 4/3621, Cabin No: 162, Drawer \n        No: 5, File No: 2905, Section No: 433, Contents No: 6, 6-1, 6-2.\n        (To 36th Division Command - Militia Commander Ismail Hakki)\n\n"For eight days, Armenians have been forcibly obstructing people from\n leaving their homes or going from one village to the other.

[pseudo-letterhead deleted -- dcs]\n\n# While Israeli Jews fete the uprising of the Warsaw ghetto, they\n# repress by violent means the uprising of the Gaza ghetto and\n# attempt to starve the Gazans.\n\n  Why do I detect the faint scent of bias here?  Could it be because\n  the Israelis aren't feasting?  Perhaps because the Gazans aren't\n  starving?\n\n# The Gaza strip, this tiny area of land with the highest population\n# density in the world,\n\n  Oh, oh.  I hadn't realized that the Chinese had wiped out Hong\n  Kong, or that Singapore had sunk into the sea, or that several\n  other cities had vanished.  Either that, or this is a taste of\n  the quality of 'Research' we're about to see.\n\n#                       has been cut off from the world for weeks.\n\n  So I suppose that the footage on CNN last night was archival,\n  and Ted Turner was faking it after the NBC style?  Or is this\n  another wee little exaggeration for the sake of a Greater Truth?\n\n# The Israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of\n# Gaza, some 700.000 people, by denying them the right to leave the\n# strip and seek work in Israel.\n\n  Hey!  You forgot that Israel has also denied Syrians the same\n  'right'.  Come to think of it, Mexico is denying me that 'right'\n  evan as I write this!  Or are you ever so gently suggesting that\n  Israel, unlike every other country on Earth, shouldn't be allowed\n  to control traffic across its borders?\n\n# While Polish non-Jews risked their lives to save Jews from the\n# Ghetto, no Israeli Jew is known to have risked his life to help\n# the Gazan resistance.  The only help given to Gazans by Israeli\n# Jews, only dozens of people, is humanitarian assistance.\n\n  This sounds like a parallel, but it isn't.  Tell us how many Poles\n  went into the Ghetto to join the Jews there.  Oops!  For a moment\n  there I forgot that in Poland, 'humanitarian assistance" could\n  get you killed.  Come to think of it, humanitarian assistance to\n  the Gazans can get Israelis killed, too.  Except that in Gaza,\n  it's likely to be by a Gazan death squad in your own office.\n\n  So let's keep the parallel.  Since the gross numbers aren't the\n  same, we'll need a proportionality value.  Should we use:\n    * Gazan vs Jewish initial population?\n    * Gazan vs Jewish death rates?\n    * Gazans vs Jews who survived five years of occupation?\n    * Israelis vs Nazis attacked by the 'resistance'?\n    * Israelis vs Poles charged with aiding the victims?\n  Since the two cases are so comparable, it shouldn't matter\n  which we pick, they'll all be about the same, right?\n\n------------\n\nContrary to popular hyperbole, the IDF *could* quite easily kill\noff the entire population of Gaza in hours if they wanted to.\n(No, I'm not exaggerating.  And I really don't want to discuss how.)\nNote that a million dead Gazans don't get much more headline\nspace than a dozen, and are just as soon forgotten -- and once\nexterminated, they can't keep popping up as headlines.\n\nSo if a "Final Solution" for Gaza would be so much better from\na *Realpolitik* standpoint, why doesn't Israel go for it?  A\ndifficult question to answer for those who can't believe anything\ngood about Jews, and probably why they keep trying to force-fit\nthe facts into the theory.

Typical 'virvir' drivel. People will think you're just some \nlooney howling in the wires.

A campaign shaped; more raids on\n Moslem villages."\n\np. 358.\n\n"It will be three hours to take," Dro told me. We'd close in on three\n sides.\n"The men on foot will not shoot, but use only the bayonets," Merrimanov\nsaid, jabbing a rifle in dumbshow.\n"That is for morale," Dro put in. "We must keep the Moslems in terror."\n"Soldiers or civilians?" I asked.\n"There is no difference," said Dro. "All are armed, in uniform or not."\n"But the women and children?"\n"Will fly with the others as best they may."\n\np. 360.\n\n"The ridges circled a wide expanse, its floors still. Hundreds of feet \n down, the fog held, solid as cotton flock. 'Djul lies under that,' said \n Dro, pointing. 'Our men also attack from the other sides.'\n\n Then, 'Whee-ee!' - his whistle lined up all at the rock edge. Bayonets\n clicked upon carbines. Over plunged Archo, his black haunches rippling;\n then followed the staff, the horde - nose to tail, bellies taking the\n spur. Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war, even though \n I heard our Utica brass roar.\n\n As I watched from the height, it took ages for Djul to show clear. A tsing\n of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed,\n dogs barked, invisible, while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow\n puddle. Mist at last folded upward as men shouted, at first heard faintly.\n The came a shrill wailing.\n\n Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke. Red glimmered about\n house walls of stone or wattle, into dry weeds on roofs. A mosque stood in\n clump of trees, thick and green. Through crooked alleys on fire, horsemen\n were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot.\n\n 'Tartarski!' shouted the gunner by me. Others pantomimed them in escape\n over the rocks, while one twisted a bronze shell-nose, loaded, and yanked\n breech-cord, firing again and again. Shots wasted, I thought, when by\n afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body. But these shots and\n the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries.\n\n At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward\n Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and \n tough, through dense scrub. Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly,\n through alders, on smoldering houses. Across trampled wheat my brothers-in-\n arms were leading off animals, several calves and a lamb."\n\np. 361 (fourth paragraph).\n\n"Corpses came next, the first a pretty child with straight black hair, \n large eyes. She looked about twelve years old. She lay in some stubble \n where meal lay scattered from the sack she'd been toting. The bayonet \n had gone through her back, I judged, for blood around was scant. Between \n the breasts one clot, too small for a bullet wound, crusted her homespun \n dress.\n\n The next was a boy of ten or less, in rawhide jacket and knee-pants. He \n lay face down in the path by several huts. One arm reached out to the \n pewter bowl he'd carried, now upset upon its dough. Steel had jabbed \n just below his neck, into the spine. \n\n There were grownups, too, I saw as I led the sorrel around. Djul was \n empty of the living till I looked up to see beside me Dro's German-speaking \n colonel. He said all Tartars who had not escaped were dead."\n\np. 358.\n\n "...more stories of Armenian murdering Turks when the czarist troops fled\n  north. My hosts told me of their duty here: to keep tabs on brigands, \n  Turkish troop shifts, hidden arms, spies - Christian, Red or Tartar -\n  coming in from Transcaucasus. Then they spoke of the hell that would \n  break loose if Versailles were to put, as threatened, the six 'Armenian'\n  vilayets of Turkey under the control of Erevan...\n\n  An Armenia without Armenians! Turks under Christian rule? His lips\n  smacked in irony under the droopy red moustache. That's bloodshed - just\n  Smyrna over again on a bigger scale."\n\n\nSerdar Argic
Serdar, I have been told that you are not real, your account is fake (which I  \nconfirmed by trying to E-mail you) and advised not to waste my time writing to  \n"you".  But, I get pleasure from watching you make a fool of yourself. \n\n\nSo you stand by the statement that all Armenians are barbarians.  OK, I see.   \nLets not even act as if there is a chance they are human.  See Serdar, when you  \njudge people because of their race this is called racism.  I tend to frown on  \nthis sort of thing.  Obviously you don't.  When you label an entire race the  \nway you do, it is easy to stop thinking of them as human beings, and this can  \nmake GENOCIDE possible.  But I guess (and this is where Serdar will fill the  \npage with quotes taken out of context) you know that, huh?\nDon't you find it weak that all of Serdars enemies are  \nFascist/NAZI/barbarian/_________fill in the blank with any catch all bad term.\n\n\nPublic knowlege?  I was not aware of that.  NOW I see, the ARMENIANS decide to  \nkill the Israeli athletes in 1972 as PRACTICE.  I was confused, but thanks for  \nclearing that up.\n\nWow, you are on a roll with the accusations today Serdar, so how did the  \nArmenians steal from the Turkish children?  Was it their lunch money?  This is  \nvery cute how you inserted children in this fill in the blank accusation sheet  \nyou fill out every day.  It really touches my heart.  Oh and thank you for  \nletting me know that Kurds and Armenians hate each other.  I was not aware of  \nthis.  The only time I have ever talked about Kurds it was about the WONDERFUL  \ntreatment they were recieving in Turkey.  They must have a high incedence of  \ninsanity because there sure are a lot of them fighting against the  \nnon-oppresive Turkish government that has let their culture flower over the  \npast 70 years.\n\n\nThanks for the unbiased TURKISH MEDIA SOURCE.  I am sure the Milliyet is rated  \nnumber one for accuracy and truth.\n\n\nInnocent?  Is that what terrorists call their victims?  I have never heard of  \nterrorists calling their victims innocent.  "Yes, folks in other news the IRA  \npublic relations department reported that it had killed 20 innocent victims in  \na car bombing...  "  Nope Serdar, I don't think so.\n \nOops you almost forgot to fill in the "Say something about Turks being killed  \nby Armenians here" section of your note.
From article <1993May12.111030@IASTATE.EDU>, by jakhan@IASTATE.EDU (Javed Ahmed Khan):\n\n\n	First of all, this is NOT a strife; this is a massacre of innocent\n	Moslem poeples by the Christian West.\n\n	Since Ottoman lost the control of Balkans, many tens and hundereds\n	of millions of Muslem peoples (Turks, Albanians, Bosnians, and others) \n	have been tortured, raped, massacred, and driven out of their homes\n	by the Cristians of both the region and Europe.

The remaining others are being \n	finished now by local Christians, the USA, and the rest of Europe.\n\n	The Christian West is maintaining a tight arms ambargo on the Muslem\n	peoples of Bosnia so they cannot deffend themslves while letting \n	Christian Serbs and Croats torture, rape, and massacre the innocent \n	Moslem peoples of Bosnia.
Oboy, this is exciting. First you discuss your non-existent literature\ntastes, then your fantasies, and now your choices of historical revisionism.\nAre you related to 'Arromdians' of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and\nRevisionism Triangle?\n\nThe Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term 'Turks,' \nwhich demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference \nto 'Muslims.' The fact that the Greek governments also mention the \nexistence of a few thousand non-Turkish Muslims does not change the \nessential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger \nTurkish minority. The 'Pomaks' are also a Muslim people, whom all the \nthree nations (Bulgarians, Turks, and Greeks) consider as part of \nthemselves. Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized \naccording to the agreements? \n\nIt also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece \nand the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world.\nThe Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkish\nminority. They pursue the same denial in connection with \nthe Macedonians of Greece. Talk about oppression. In addition,\nin 1980 the 'democratic' Greek Parliament passed Law No. 1091,\nvirtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and\nother charitable trusts. They have ceased to be self-supporting\nreligious and cultural entities. Talk about fascism. The Greek \ngovernments are attempting to appoint the muftus, irrespective\nof the will of the Turkish minority, as state official. Although\nthe Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters in\nGreece, the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electing\nits religious leaders. Talk about democracy.\n\nThe government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic \nconvention in Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an \nattitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a \nviolation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the 'so-called' \nGreek Constitution, which is supposed to guarantee the protection \nof historical monuments. \n\nThe government of Greece, on the other hand, is building new \nchurches in remote villages as a complementary step toward \nHellenizing the region.\n\nThe longstanding use of the adjective 'Turkish' in titles\nand on signboards is prohibited. The Greek courts have\nordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers' Association, \nthe Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti \nTurkish Association on grounds that there are no Turks\nin Western Thrace. Such community associations had been \nactive until 1984. But they were first told to remove\nthe word 'Turkish' on their buildings and on their official\npapers and then eventually close down. This is also the \nfinal verdict (November 4, 1987) of the Greek High Court.\n\nHelsinki Watch, a well-known Human Rights group, had been investigating \nthe plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece. In August 1990, their \nfindings were published in a report titled \n\n 'Destroying Ethnic Identity: Turks of Greece.'\n\nThe report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the \nTurkish minority by the Greek authorities. It says for instance, \nthe Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in \nKomotini. Such destruction, which reflects an attitude against \nthe Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the \nLausanne Convention. \n\n\nHELSINKI WATCH: "PROBLEMS OF TURKS IN WESTERN THRACE CONTINUE"\n\nAnkara (A.A)  In a 15-page report  of the "Helsinki Watch"  it is\nstated that the Turkish minority in Western Thrace is still faced\nwith problems and stipulated that the discriminatory policy being\nimplemented by the Greek Government be brought to an end.\n\nThe report on Western Thrace emphasized that the Greek government\nshould grant  social and political  rights to all the  members of\nminorities that are equal to  those enjoyed by Greek citizens and\nin addition  they must  recognize the  existence of  the "Turkish\nMinority" in Western Thrace and  grant them the right to identify\nthemselves as 'Turks'.\n\nNEWSPOT, May 1992\n\n\nGREECE ISOLATES WEST THRACE TURKS\n\nThe  Xanthi independent  MP Ahmet  Faikoglu said  that the  Greek\nstate is trying to cut all  contacts and relations of the Turkish\nminority with Turkey.\n\nPointing out that while the  Greek minority living in Istanbul is\ncalled "Greek"  by ethnic  definition, only  the religion  of the\nminority in  Western Thrace is  considered. In an  interview with\nTurkish origin. The individuals of the minority living in Western\nTrace are also Turkish."\n\nEmphasizing  the education  problem for  the Turkish  minority in\nWestern  Thrace  Faikoglu said  that  according  to an  agreement\nsigned in 1951 Greece must distribute textbooks printed in Turkey\nin Turkish minority schools in Western Thrace.\n\nRecalling his activities and those of Komotini independent MP Dr.\nSadIk  Ahmet  to  defend  the rights  of  the  Turkish  minority,\nFaikoglu said.  "In fact we  helped Greece. Because  we prevented\nGreece, the cradle of democracy, from losing face before European\ncountries by forcing the Greek  government to recognize our legal\nrights."\n\nOn Turco-Greek relations, he pointed  out that both countries are\npredestined  to live  in  peace for  geographical and  historical\nreasons and said  that Turkey and Greece must  resist the foreign\npowers  who  are  trying  to   create  a  rift  between  them  by\ncooperating, adding  that in  Turkey he  observed that  there was\nwill to improve relations with Greece.\n\nNEWSPOT, January 1993\n\n\nMACEDONIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS TO FACE TRIAL IN GREECE.\n\nTwo ethnic Macedonian  human rights activists will  face trial in\nAthens for alleged crimes against the Greek state, according to a\nCourt Summons (No. 5445) obtained by MILS.\n\n  Hristos  Sideropoulos and  Tashko Bulev  (or Anastasios  Bulis)\nhave been charged under Greek criminal law for making comments in\nan Athenian magazine.\n\n  Sideropoulos and  Bulev gave an  interview to the  Greek weekly\nmagazine  "ENA"  on  March  11,  1992,  and  said  that  they  as\nMacedonians were  denied basic human  rights in Greece  and would\nfield  an ethnic  Macedonian  candidate for  the up-coming  Greek\ngeneral election.\n\n  Bulev said in the interview: "I am not Greek, I am Macedonian."\nSideropoulos said  in the  article that "Greece  should recognise\nMacedonia.  The  allegations  regarding  territorial  aspirations\nagainst  Greece are  tales... We  are in  a panic  to secure  the\nborder, at  a time when the  borders and barriers within  the EEC\nare falling."\n\n  The  main  charge  against  the two,  according  to  the  court\nsummons,  was   that  "they  have   spread...intentionally  false\ninformation  which  might  create   unrest  and  fear  among  the\ncitizens,  and  might affect  the  public  security or  harm  the\ninternational interests of the country (Greece)."\n\n  The  Greek  state  does  not   recognise  the  existence  of  a\nMacedonian ethnicity. There are believed to be between 350,000 to\n1,000,000  ethnic  Macedonians   living  within  Greece,  largely\nconcentrated in the north. It is  a crime against the Greek state\nif anyone declares themselves Macedonian.\n\n  In  1913  Greece,   Serbia-Yugoslavia  and  Bulgaria  partioned\nMacedonia into three  pieces. In 1919 Albania  took 50 Macedonian\nvillages. The part under  Serbo-Yugoslav occupation broke away in\n1991  as the  independent Republic  of Macedonia.  There are  1.5\nmillion Macedonians in the Republic; 500,000 in Bulgaria; 150,000\nin Albania; and 300,000 in Serbia proper.\n\n  Sideropoulos  has been  a long  time campaigner  for Macedonian\nhuman rights in  Greece, and lost his job as  a forestry worker a\nfew years ago.  He was even exiled to an  obscure Greek island in\nthe mediteranean. Only pressure from Amnesty International forced\nthe Greek government  to allow him to return to  his home town of\nFlorina (Lerin) in Northern  Greece (Aegean Macedonia), where the\nmajority of ethnic Macedonians live.\n\n  Balkan watchers see the Sideropoulos  affair as a show trial in\nwhich  Greece is  desperate to  clamp down  on internal  dissent,\nespecially  when it  comes to  the issue  of recognition  for its\nnorthern neighbour, the Republic of Macedonia.\n\n  Last year the  State Department of the  United States condemned\nGreece for its bad treatment of ethnic Macedonians and Turks (who\nlargely live in Western Thrace). But it remains to be seen if the\nUS government  will do anything until  the Presidential elections\nare over.\n\n================================================================\n                M.

AIRPORT\n\n    ESPIONAGE: Former police officer is taken into custody upon\n    arriving from Philippines, where he had fled after FBI\n    interrogation.\n\nBy Jenifer Warren, Times staff writer\n\nSan Francisco -- A former San Francisco police officer who fled to the\nPhilippines amid accusations that he funneled confidential law\nenforcement information to an investigator for the Anti-Defamation\nLeague was arrested at the airport here on 11 felony charges, police\nsaid Friday.\n\nThomas J. Gerard who abruptly left the United States in October after\nthe FBI questioned him about his activities, was apprehended Thursday\nnight after a source in the Philippines told investigators that Gerard\nwas returning home.\n\nGerard, 50, was booked into San Francisco County Jail early Friday\nmorning on eight counts of theft of government documents and one count\neach of computer theft, burglary and conspiracy.\n\nIf convicted on all charges, Gerard could face 16 years in prison and\n$40,000 in fines.  Bail was initially set at $250,000 after police\nargued that he was a flight risk, but it was later reduced to $20,000. \nA friend of Gerard was trying to post bail late Friday afternoon, a\nsheriff's spokeswoman said.\n\nGerard returned to the United because he missed his wife and child,\nwith whom he lived on a houseboat in Sausalito, and "wanted to have\nhis day in court," said Police Capt. John Willett, his former boss and\none of two arresting officers.\n\nGerard, an undercover agent for the Central Intelligence Agency from\n1982 to 1985, also feared that the CIA was out to kill him, Willett\nsaid.  In an interview with The Times last month, Gerard threatened to\ndisclose illegal CIA support of death squads in Central America if he\nwas indicted and tried on the San Francisco spying charges.\n\nGerard is a central figure in a scandal over an intelligence network\noperated by the Anti-Defamation League, a prominent Jewish civil\nrights organization.  Investigators allege that Gerard illegally gave\ncriminal histories to Roy Bullock, a San Francisco art dealer who said\nhe has been an undercover ADL intelligence operative for 40 years.\n\nInvestigators said they found confidential police files in Bullock's\nhome computer -- which contained entries on 10,000 people and 950\ngroups -- and in boxes in his apartment.  Files have also been seized\nunder search warrants from ADL offices in San Francisco and Los\nAngeles but authorities have not disclosed their contents.\n\nGerard could not be reached for comment Friday, and his attorney,\nJames Lassart, did not return telephone calls seeking comment.  In the\ninterview with The Times last month, however, Gerard acknowledged\nsnooping and sharing some information with Bullock, but denied any\ncriminal wrongdoing.\n\nBullock and Gerard also are under investigation for selling\nintelligence to South Africa.\n\nADL officials have described Bullock as a $550-a-week independent\ncontractor and have vigorously denied knowledge of any illegal\nactivity.  On Friday, ADL lawyer Jerrold Ladar said Gerard's arrest\n"has nothing to do with ADL.  Other than that, we have no comment on\nthe case."\n\nArab-American groups -- which were a main target of the spying,\naccording to police -- applauded the arrest and pressed authorities to\npursue the investigation.\n\n"We urge investigators to carry this case forward and to publicly\ndisclose the full extent of ADL and law enforcement involvement," said\nJames Zogby, head of the Arab American Institute in Washington.\n\nPolice, meanwhile, characterized Gerard's arrest -- the first in the\ninquiry into the spying scandal -- as an unexpected breakthrough.  A\nformer police colleague of Gerard, Inspector Fred Mollat, visited\nGerard several weeks ago and urged him to return home.\n\n"I knew he wouldn't want to live on an island on the lam forever, but\nwe didn't think it would happen this quickly," Capt. Willett said. \n"This development really speeds up our timetable on the case."\n\nDuring his 25-year career on the police force, Gerard was a highly\nregarded officer known for his work in the department's intelligence\ndivision.  His last assignment was on the gang task force.\n\nAfter FBI agents questioned Gerard last fall, he took early retirement\nand fled to the remote jungle island of Palawan, 300 miles south of\nManila.\n\nGerard was arrested at 8:40 p.m. as he stepped from his Philippines\nAirlines flight. He was traveling alone and looked tanned but haggard\nafter his six-month hiatus, police said.\n\n"He was surprised when he saw us standing there, and got a shocked\nlook on his face," Willett said.  "Then he said, 'Hello, I'm back.'"
Actually Judea and Samaria are proper geographical names, just like \n    Asia Minor or Lake Michigan. Judea and Samaria are even used in \n    an atlas published in (what used to be) USSR circa 1970 that I have at\n    home. The government of the USSR was of course quite hostile towards\n    Israel and would hardly engage in a pro-Israel propaganda. I would be\n    willing to mail a photocopy of the relevant page to Mr. Schmidling \n    with relevant words underlined to simplify his search, if he promises\n    to report to the net afterwards.\n\nMr. Schmidling is to be congtatualted for being living exception to this\ngeneral rule. For although he is almost without peer in both the number\nof lies posted and in the number of times he repeats them --- he hasn't \nfound many people who believe his lies (yet ?).
I really don't know how you can possibly maintain this hypocritical\nstance.\n\nOn the one hand, you imply that there is a conspiracy of Arab-Americans\nthat warrants the illegal gathering of information on them (ie. auto license/\nregistration information in California) and other forms of "monitoring", including\nblatant attempts by paid ADL agents to discredit an American-Arab \norganization by trying to distribute Nazi propaganda.  Furthermore,\nyou attempt to rationalize this through crude stereotyping by pointing \nto the WTC bombing, in which Arab-Americans had no involvement.\n\nOn the other hand, you publish this excerpt, which seems to rail\nagainst notions of a racial (Jewish, in this case) conspiracy and\nstereotypes.\n\nIf you really aren't the hypocrite you appear to be, please explain \nyourself.

There's your problem right there. 'ASALA/SDPA/ARF' crooks/idiots stole\nyour brain. Just watch...\n\nSource: "World Alive, A Personal Story" by Robert Dunn. Crown Publishers, \nInc., New York (1952). \n(Memoirs of an American officer who witnessed the Armenian genocide of 2.5 \n million Muslim people)\n\np. 361 (seventh paragraph) and p. 362 (first paragraph).\n\n 'The most are inside houses. Come you and look.'\n 'No, dammit! My stomach isn't-'\n 'One is a Turkish officer in uniform. Him you must see.'\n "We were under those trees by the mosque, in an open space....\n 'I don't believe you," I said, but followed to a nail-studded door. The \n  man pushed it ajar, then spurred away, leaving me to check on the corpse. \n  I thought I should, this charge was so constant, so gritted my teeth and \n  went inside.\n\n The place was cool but reeked of sodden ashes, and was dark at first, for \n its stone walls had only window slits. Rags strewed the mud floor around an \n iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black \n with soot. All looked bare and empty, but in an inner room flies buzzed. As \n the door swung shut behind me I saw they came from a man's body lying face \n up, naked but for its grimy turban. He was about fifty years old by what \n was left of his face - a rifle butt had bashed an eye. The one left slanted, \n as with Tartars rather than with Turks. Any uniform once on him was gone, so \n I'd no proof which he was, and quickly went out, gagging at the mess of his  \n slashed genitals."\n\np. 363 (first paragraph). \n\n 'How many people lived there?'\n 'Oh, about eight hundred.' He yawned.\n 'Did you see any Turk officers?'\n 'No, sir. I was in at dawn. All were Tartar civilians in mufti.'\n\n "The lieutenant dozed off, then I, but in the small hours a voice woke me - \n Dro's. He stood in the starlight bawling out an officer. Anyone keelhauled\n so long and furiously I'd never heard. Then abruptly Dro broke into \n laughter, quick and simple as child's. Both were a cover for his sense\n of guilt, I thought, or hoped. For somehow, despite my boast of irreligion,\n Christian massacring 'infidels' was more horrible than the reverse would\n have been.\n\n From daybreak on, Armenian villagers poured in from miles around.....\n The women plundered happily, chattering like ravens as they picked over\n the carcass of Djul. They hauled out every hovel's chattels, the last \n scrap of food or cloth, and staggered away, packing pots, saddlebags, \n looms, even spinning-wheels.\n\n 'Thank you for a lot, Dro,' I said to him back in camp. 'But now I must \n leave.'...We shook hands, the captain said 'A bientot, mon camarade.' And \n for hours the old Molokan scout and I plodded north across parching plains. \n Like Lot's wife I looked back once to see smoke bathing all, doubtless in \n a sack of other Moslem villages up to the line of snow that was Iran.'"\n\np. 354.\n\n"At morning tea, Dro and his officers spread out a map of this whole\n high region called the Karabakh. Deep in tactics, they spoke Russian,\n but I got their contempt for Allied 'neutral' zones and their distrust\n of promises made by tribal chiefs. A campaign shaped; more raids on\n Moslem villages."\n\np. 358.\n\n"It will be three hours to take," Dro told me. We'd close in on three\n sides.\n"The men on foot will not shoot, but use only the bayonets," Merrimanov\nsaid, jabbing a rifle in dumbshow.\n"That is for morale," Dro put in. "We must keep the Moslems in terror."\n"Soldiers or civilians?" I asked.\n"There is no difference," said Dro. "All are armed, in uniform or not."\n"But the women and children?"\n"Will fly with the others as best they may."\n\np. 360.\n\n"The ridges circled a wide expanse, its floors still. Hundreds of feet \n down, the fog held, solid as cotton flock. 'Djul lies under that,' said \n Dro, pointing. 'Our men also attack from the other sides.'\n\n Then, 'Whee-ee!' - his whistle lined up all at the rock edge. Bayonets\n clicked upon carbines. Over plunged Archo, his black haunches rippling;\n then followed the staff, the horde - nose to tail, bellies taking the\n spur. Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war, even though \n I heard our Utica brass roar.\n\n As I watched from the height, it took ages for Djul to show clear. A tsing\n of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed,\n dogs barked, invisible, while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow\n puddle. Mist at last folded upward as men shouted, at first heard faintly.\n The came a shrill wailing.\n\n Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke. Red glimmered about\n house walls of stone or wattle, into dry weeds on roofs. A mosque stood in\n clump of trees, thick and green. Through crooked alleys on fire, horsemen\n were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot.\n\n 'Tartarski!' shouted the gunner by me. Others pantomimed them in escape\n over the rocks, while one twisted a bronze shell-nose, loaded, and yanked\n breech-cord, firing again and again. Shots wasted, I thought, when by\n afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body. But these shots and\n the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries.\n\n At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward\n Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and \n tough, through dense scrub. Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly,\n through alders, on smoldering houses. Across trampled wheat my brothers-in-\n arms were leading off animals, several calves and a lamb."\n\np. 361 (fourth paragraph).\n\n"Corpses came next, the first a pretty child with straight black hair, \n large eyes.

If we can't avoid throwing out gut-reactions to what we see as "extremist"\nviews here in the newsgroup, we're certainly not going to be any better at\nit in the real world. Hey, it easy here. After reading the offending post, \nwe can step back, take some deep breathing exercises, have a gallon of\nice cream (or sex, whichever calmsus), and reply in something other\nthan the usual king-of-the-hill mentality.  \n\nPerhaps, starting here with an immediate "accusation" is not a particularly\ngood way to generate open responses? How about explaining what you see as\nbeing Israel's *real worries* and how they *need* to be addressed? Since\nthe "other side" sees Israel's "gestures" in a completely different light\nthan you do, perhaps "they" also have *real worries*. From their point\nof view, what are they? How can those worries be addressed? \n\nIt is certainly much harder to "reach compromise" (or, even sit down\nand talk with...) an other side which is fractured into several\ndifferent ideologies, each with its own set of "demands". While it is\nup to "them" to generate unity on their side, is there anything that\nIsrael can do (without sacrificing its security, its position) to\nencourage that unification along lines that Israel prefers?
Perhaps Iranians are not Arabs even not-so-strictly-speaking ?
I just exchange ideas over the USENET with other people. I never \nattacked you as to put you in the need to defend yourself against me.\nI am not a violent person, and I do not see how can anyone be threatened\nby the opinions and ideas of others as expressed on USENET.\nI asked you to continue on email because I am not interested on a\nflamefest, where you change my words or just make up some of your own\nand present them as mine.\nSo, do not worry. You do not need to defend yourself because I am not\nattacking you.\n\n\nThis is a good advice for yourself.
Can anyone figure out what kind of deranged parent was stupid enough to\nbring their infant on a rock throwing crusade (or jihad, sorry)?  18-month\nold infants certainly don't walk around the streets on their own.  That would\nlead me to believe that some nimrod of a "parent" brought them along for a \nlittle terrorism.\n\n\nthats what happened.\n\n\n\nUhm, last I heard, the territories were disputed.  Israel's occupation is not\nillegal.  They are legally allowed to remain there until a settlement is reached\nwith the arabs which, from the behavior of the Palestinian negotitating team,\nwill probably be never.\n\n\n\nhuh?  they were buying vegetables.

Infact on tuesday, the Bosnian foreign minister asked formally the UN to leave Bosnia,\njust to show how much hypocracy is there in Europe. These so called UN is actually\nhelping Serbs carry out their etnic-clensing/murders/rapes. In Zepa the UN effectively\nhelped the Serbs carry out their heinous crimes by spreading conflicting reports that\nnothing was going on there. The cowards, or so called UN peacemakers, only "attempted" to \ngo out there for a fact finding mission -as if with all the ham-radio operators were lying\nand all the US war planes out there have no means of flying over there. This is the biggest\nfarce in the history of the world and the same act has been repeated over and over again in\ndifferent beseiged Bosnian towns....\n\nYes! I heard today that the president of Bosnia- under pressure from the "civilized nations"\nhas appealed to the UN to stay there in Bosnia. He should know better..\n\nThese hypocrates (Sadly! it includes Clinton administration too) all came out and said\nthat the call for a referendum from bosnian serbian perliment (or a bunch of\nrapists/criminals) is a farce and yet they have to wait for the result of this referendum\nto act.... \n\nFor those of you who are against US to commit ground troops, fine just lift the arms-embargo on BOTH\nsides (since we know that serbs always got the heavy weapons form federal army). \n\nWake up West!! and admit that you are the most uncivilized, the most hypocratic and the most violent\nbunch on this earth...\n\n\n\n-Khalid

Far from it.\nI am merely suggesting that there are certain things which can be\nuniversally agreed to be morally incorrect. There are not many such\nthings. But there are some. As an example:\n\n(1) murder is morally incorrect\n\n(2) the idea that one group of people is somehow racially inferior to\nanother is morally incorrect\n\netc.\n\nThe point is that any action which serves to promote a morally\nincorrect action should be forbidden. This implies that no one has the\nright to say that an innocent person should be murdered. Regardless of\nfreedom of speech, I may not stand on a street corner and advocate the\nmurder of innocent people. The reason for this is that murder is a\nmorally incorrect action.\n\nIn the same way, since bigotry is morally incorrect in the narrow\ndefinition which we have given it, (2), I, nor any one else, has the\nright to stand on a street corner and promote bigotry. Such an\nenforcement does in no way deny any one their rights as guaranteed by\nthe first amendment. It merely ensures that no person may be the\ntarget of an attempt to deny him a fundamental moral right, such as\nthe right to not be murdered, and the right not to be discriminated\nagainst.\n\nI believe, Mr. Berson, that to blindly accept the constitution is a\nterrific mistake. We must cinstantly question the constitution and\ninterpret it in a way befitting the society in which we live. Anything\nshort of such an effort would render us little more than trained\nmonkeys, who are able to merely repeat what they have heard without\npaying the slightest bit of attention to the intent of the document in\nquestion.\n\nWould you disagree, Mr.Berson?
A typical Armenian revisionist. As in the past in x-Soviet Armenia, \nand today in Azerbaijan, for utopic and idiotic causes the Armenians\nbrought havoc to their neighbors. A short-sighted and misplaced\nnationalistic fervor with a wrong agenda and anachronistic methods\nthe Armenians continue to become pernicious for the region. As usual,\nthey will be treated accordingly by their neighbors. Nagorno-Karabag \nis a mountainous enclave that lies completely within Azerbaijan with \nno border or history whatsoever connected to x-Soviet Armenia. Besides \nthe geographical aspect, Nagorno-Karabag is the historic homeland and \nthe 'cradle' of the artistic and literary heritage of Azerbaijan, which \nrenders the Armenian claims preposterous, even lunatic. No one in his or \nher mind could have imagined that one day such a devious turn of event \ncould have plagued the Azeris. One cannot even imagine the reverse case \nto occur, for the Armenians either would have slaughtered the Azerbaijanis, \nor put them to forced exile to maintain their own majority. Where was she?\n\n\n                An Appeal to Mankind\n\nDuring the last three years Azerbaijan and its multinational\npopulation are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of\nthe Soviet Union. All humanitarian, constitutional human rights\nguaranteed by the UN Charter, Universal Declaration of Human\nRights, Helsinki Agreements, Human Problems International Forums,\ndocuments signed by the Soviet Union - all of them are violated.\n\nThe USSR's President, government bodies do not defend Azerbaijan\nthough they are all empowered to take necessary measures to\nguarantee life and peace.\n\nThe 140,000 strong army of Armenian terrorists with Moscow's\ntacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against\nAzerbaijan. As a result, a part of Azerbaijan has been occupied\nand annexed, hundreds of people killed, thousands wounded.\n\nSome 200,000 Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly\ndeported from the Armenian SSR, their historical homeland.\nTogether with them 64,000 Russians and 22,000 Kurds have also\nbeen driven out, a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan.\nSome 40,000 Turkish-Meskhetians, Lezghins and representatives \nof other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the Central\nAsia where the President and government bodies did not guarantee\nthem the life and peace also suffered from these deportations.\n\nOne of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against\nAzerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the\nArmenian extremists' destruction of the Karabakh scientific\nexperimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection \nof the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR.\n\nWe beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance,\nfor the honour and dignity of 7 million Azerbaijanis are\nviolated, its territory, culture  and history are trampled,\nits people are shot. There is persistent negative image of\nAzerbaijanians abroad, and this defamation is spread over \nthe whole world by Soviet mass media, Armenian lobby in the\nUSSR and the United States. \n\nOne of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and\ngenerated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance\nwhile the truth is that all these shootings and recent \nevents stem from the territorial claims of Armenia on\nAzerbaijan.\n\nIt is a well documented fact that before the conflict there\nwere no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on the\nissue of Karabakh. Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidly\nand calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land, had their\nrepresentatives in all government bodies of the Azerbaijan\nSSR.\n\nWe are for a united, indivisible, sovereign Azerbaijan, we \nare for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one\nof the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic \nRepublic - Muhammed Emin Rasulzade.\n\nBut all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the\nSoviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionists\nencouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new '1,000\nYear Reich' - the 'Great Armenia' - by annexing the \nneighboring lands.\n\nThe world public opinion shed tears to save the whales,\nsuffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent.\n\nBut what about the lives of seven million human beings?\nIf these people are Muslims, does it mean that they are\nless valuable? Can people be discriminated by their \ncolour of skin or religion, by their residence or other\nattributes?\n\nAll people are brothers, and we appeal to our brothers\nfor help and understanding. This is not the first appeal\nof Azerbaijan to the world public opinion. Our previous\nappeals were unheard. However, we still carry the hope\nthat the truth beyond the Russian and Armenian propaganda\nwill one day reveal the extent of our suffering and\nstimulate at least as much help and compassion for\nAzerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins.\n\n		THE COMMITTEE FOR PEOPLE'S HELP TO \n                KARABAKH (OF THE) ACADEMY OF SCIENCES \n                OF THE AZERBAIJAN SSR\n\n\n"PAINFUL SEARCH .."\n\nTHE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians\nin the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about\n600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the\nfour-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.\n\nThe figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials\nand casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid\nworkers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.\n\nThe 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of\nthe last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control\nof Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations\nin Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting\nretreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the\ndead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first\nsuppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku.\nLater  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken\nAzerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000\ndead.\n\nThe State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a\n15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  "Hojali\nDisaster", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on\npreliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman\nMemmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in\nthe Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more\nthan 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700\ndead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman\nof the Azeri Ministry of Defence.\n\nFranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International\nRed Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of\nAgdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque\nfrom  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. "We  did  not count  the\nbodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy," Mr\nZen Ruffinen said. "We have some idea since we gave the body bags\nand products to wash the dead."\n\nMr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the\nnumber of  dead in the  massacre. "Don't  get worked up.  It will\ntake  several months  to  get a  final  figure," the  43-year-old\nlawyer said at his small office.\n\nMr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to\nreach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714\nwounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist\nuprising in Baku in January 1990.\n\nThose  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power\nthree weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly\nwhat  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70\nmiles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.\n\nOfficially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being\nthe  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the\nrepublic's forensic department. "This  is just a small percentage\nof the dead," said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic\nscientist. "They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the\nchaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury\nour dead within 24 hours."\n\nOf these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14\nyears old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and\naxes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland\nsnows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of\ndeliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises\ncut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's\nreport. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those\nbelieved to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.\n\nFiles  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still\ndisorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six\npolicemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the\nnames of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The\nmost heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far\ncomes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a\nhelicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27\nFebruary.\n\n"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to\ncount properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream\nand the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village," Mr\nManafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter\npilot.\n\n"People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and\none  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was\npulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but\nArmenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to\nreturn."\n\nThere  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in\ncirculation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few\nmonths and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali\nat the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages\ntaken over by Armenian forces.\n\nTHE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/'92\n\n\nHEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIES\n\nAREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the\nCaspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in\nhis trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of\nHojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.\n\n"I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,"\nthe  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the\nHojali disaster. "I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to\nbe alive."\n\nMr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity\nfor more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12\ndays. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the\n2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the\nedge of Karabakh.\n\n"At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard\nbefore,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy\nmachine-guns, the lot," Mr Sadikov said.\n\nSoon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction\nof  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started\nfleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the\nsnow into a forest on the other side.\n\nTo escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam\nabout 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it,\nuntil at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two\nArmenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.\n\n"None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by\na  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening\nfire," Mr Sadikov said.\n\nAzeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward\nto force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts\nwere mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his\ngroup of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman\nson.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his\n67-year-old elder brother.\n\n"I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,"\nhe said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. "We\nhave never got any of the bodies back."\n\nThe first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire.\nOne hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he\nstruggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's\ncrossing, Mr Sadikov said.\n\nAnother hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and\nseveral others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy\nhillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three\nArmenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.\n\nAs the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was\nlittle comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was\nsoon to flee.\n\n"The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian\nrocket attack. Some people just  kept going," Mr Sadikov said. "I\nhad to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way.\nThey even found a bullet in my sock."\n\nVictims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in the\nHojali massacre in February  (left).

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n\nI dont think you're correct here. There have been no reports of the Bosnians\nMuslims supporting the Nazis in their genocide against the Serbians.

Funny you should mention. That's the whole point 'paliks' invariably miss. \n\n\nSource: 'United Nations, Human Development Report,' 1990.\n\nAnnual Output Per Person in Dollars Adjusted to Purchasing Power\nParity: Turkiye, Greece and Chile are in the same category. That\nis, $3,000 - $5,999. \n\n\nSource: 'International Economics: Theory and Policy' by Paul R.\n        Krugman and Maurice Obstfeld, Harper Collins Publishers,\n        1991, (second edition).\n\nIn terms of 'Annual Output Per Person in Dollars Adjusted to \nPurchasing Power Parity,' Greece is in the same category with \nTurkiye.\n\n\nIndeed, Greek Governments have enormous problems to tackle. The \neconomy is in shambles, corruption is rampant, air pollution is \nin outrageous dimensions, state-sponsored terrorism is the name \nof the game and infrastructure is decaying. Another insightful \narticle in the New York Times (Sunday, April 7) exposes the dirty \nlinen of Greece, and describes her as the pariah of the European \nCommunity. The article reports that ''...with un-European antics,\nGreece uses the Community as a cash register. She squanders, and\nat times even steals the European tax payers' money for political  \nfeatherbedding at home. The principal members of the Community\nadmit that it was a mistake to accept Greece to the European\nCommunity.'' This affirmation is testimony to the fact that\nnotwithstanding her geographic location, Greece is un-European\nin mentality and attitude. \n\nIndeed, during the last 12 years, Turkiye registered a great \nsuccess with regard to economic restructuring. A sound economy, \nready to be integrated to the world economies, has emerged, \nsucceeding to the faltering one, witnessed in the '70s.\n\nJust 12 years ago, Greece used to export double as much as \nTurkiye did. Now inversely, Turkiye's overall exports exceed \nby far that of Greece. As far as the tourism incomes are \nconcerned, we are witnessing the same phenomenon.\n\nThe governments in Turkiye have put a particular emphasis on \nthe infrastructure investments (rather than investing in\nworld terrorist organizations), thereby solving this issue \ncompletely. Indeed, in the '70s, it was out of the question \nto conduct a telephone call from Eastern Anatolia to the West. \nNowadays, this is not the case at all, and in a far remote \ntown, even in a village you may have, at any time, a long-distance \ncall to any given country.\n\nHowever, the same could not be applied to Greece. In fact,\nit is not so easy in Athens to have a trunk call to Germany\nround the clock. And if you happen to be in the Greek islands,\nthen your chance will be pretty slim. Therefore, it would not\nbe an exaggeration to argue that Turkiye is far ahead of \nGreece in regard to telecommunication facilities. Greece,\nby virtue of its full membership, has enjoyed all advantages\nof the EC, obtaining huge grants and extensive subsidies. \nTurkiye, having no access at all to similar financial supports,\nhas nevertheless managed to create a better economy which \nenabled it to produce consecutive current accounts surplus\nover the last two years. As such, Turkiye deserves to be the\nonly country in its region having permanent current accounts\nsurplus. \n\n\nSerdar Argic
I am forced to disagree with you. First of all, one may have been \nborn from a non-Turkish, non-Muslim parent outside the Turkish land, \nyet still can be a Turk, provided this person calls himself or herself \na Turk. Because the designation of a Turk is not a genetic feature,\nnot a racial or religious feature. It is a matter of identifying\nwith the Turkish values. Secondly, the following observations by \nWesterners were written in French by Ahmet Cevat: \n\n"If Turks had behaved like Christians to use force to convert to Islam the\nnations which they brought under their power, to which no one could have\nopposed, today there would be no Eastern problem. But Turks did not do so. \nThey obeyed the word of the Koran to permit everybody "to worship in their own\nway" centuries before Frederick the Great pronounced his famous dictum. Thus,\nin an age when the Christian Europe itself shed Christian blood and when \npeople in Europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefs\ndiffered from theirs, the Ottoman Empire became the sole country where the\ninquisition did not exist, where deaths at the stake were unheard of and \nwhere accusations of witchcraft were not made. And the barbarian (!) Turkey\nwas the only country where the Jews persecuted and chased away everywhere\nby the Christians, could find asylum. These facts demonstrate that Muslim\ncountries provided spiritually far better living conditions than Christian\ncountries."[1]\n\n"The Turks, who are a conquering nation, did not Turkify the nations that came\nunder their rule; instead, they respected their religions and traditions. It\nwas a stroke of luck for Romania to live under Turkish rule instead of\nRussian or Austrian rule. Because otherwise there would not have been a\nRomanian nation today" (Popescu Ciocanel).\n\n"Turks rule over people under their administration only externally, without\ninterfering with their internal structures. On account of this, the autonomy\nof minorities in Turkey is better and more complete than any in the most\nadvanced European countries."[2]\n\n"...human beings hate each other on account of religious differences. This flaw\nis older than Islam and Christianity. But there has never been any examples\nof this adjuration in Turkey because Turks never oppress anybody on account\nof his religion. If enmity on the basis of religion had been such a case of\nsimple contempt among us too, or if it did not keep translating itself into\naction, many nations in our Europe would probably have considered themselves\nhappy!" (A. de Mortraye).[3]\n\n"Turkey never became a scene for religious terror or for the cruelty of the\ninquisition. On the contrary, it served as an asylum for the unfortunate\nvictims of Christian fanaticism. If you look into history, you will see that\nin the fifteenth century thousands of Jews who were expelled from Spain and\nPortugal found such a good asylum in Turkey that their descendants have been\nliving there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years,\nand are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against the\ncruelty of Christians, especially that of the Orthodoxes. No Jew is able to\nappear in public during Easter celebrations in Athens, even today. In Turkey,\nhowever, if the Israelites are insulted by the Greek and Armenian communities,\nlocal courts immediately take them under their protection."\n\n"In that vast and calm country of the sultan, all religions and nations are\nliving together peacefully. Although the mosque is superior to the church and\nthe synagogue, it does not replace them. Because of this, the Catholic sect is\nmore free in Istanbul and Smyrna compared with Paris and Lyon. In addition \nto the fact that no law in Turkey prohibits the open-air ceremonies of this \nsect, neither does any law imprison its cross in the church. While the\ndead are being taken to the graves, a long line of priests bear processional\ncandles and chant Catholic hymns. When all the priests in all the churches in\nthe Galata and Beyoglu districts go into the streets and form clerical\nprocessions during the Eucharist celebrations, chanting hymns and bearing\ntheir crosses and religious banners, a detachment of soldiers escorts them\nwhich forces even the Turks to stand in respect around the group of \npriests."

Now I have a comment concerning Israeli terrorism\n   during the 1930's and 1940's.  The Hirgun, and other branch -\n   off militant groups, did fight the British do get them out of\n   Palestine.  Yet I fail to see how this Israeli form of\n   terrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the\n   Arabs.  These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent British\n   soldiers, but not only thta also killed many Jews who were in\n   favor of a compromise with the Palestinians.\n\nThe Irgun killed SOLDIERS,  which is a legitimate way to drive an unwanted\nfogriend regime from a country.  They didn't kill blindly their families or\nsuch (not as a policy,  I agree that brits which were not soldiers also were\nkilled sometimes) nor they killed Arabs just for being Arabs.\n\nIn case I have to remind you the difference,  the majority of the attacks of\nthe Arab terrorist organizations was on civilians.  They even tried to\njustify their attacks by saying that all Jews in the Israel served in the army\nat one point in time or another and therefore are legitimate targets.\n\n   In addition, they\n   massacred an entire Palestinian village in 1948, contributing\n   to the exodus of the frightened Palestinians who feared their\n   very lives.\n\nYes, these exceptions were tragic mistakes.  I wasn't there and don't have\nreffereces handy but from what I heard your description is a bit carried away,\nmost of the vilagers fled with several dozens,  most of them claimed to be\nfighters being killed.\n\nThose "massaceres" are far from being the rule considering that dozens if not\nhounders of Arab vilages came under Israeli rule during the same time period.\n\n	   I mention this not because I'm anti semitic [I'm part\n   Jewish] but because this self righteousness on the part of the\n   Israelites pisses me off so.  I'm not as critical of the\n   Palestinians because they were indeed screwed over by the\n   Jews.  It 's a damn shame that the Palestinians had to pay for\n   German and European anti semitism.\n\nWhat do you mean "screwed over by the Jews"?  They began the '47 war and\ndidn't accept the arrgenment planned by the U.N.,  what did you expect the\nJews to do??\n\n				   Pissed off at Immature,\n			     Closeminded, Self righteous\n				   Semites\n                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nArabs are also Semites.
A few things about the University. It is more fun than some may\nadmit. Partying does go on and it has consistently been ranked\none of Playboy's top party schools. But we do study and more\nimportantly learn a lot. The overall UVa drug use is actually\nlower than the average college in the U.S. \n	There is no hate law on the books even though they (The\nforces of PC) tried to have one last year( by the way a similar\nlaw at the University of Wisconsin ? was found unconstitutional\nlast year). There is a law\nagainst relationship of professors with their students or\nadvisees that just passed. \n	Thomas Jefferson was the sole author of the Virginia\nstatute for religious freedom(the basis for the first ten\namendments), though he is not given full credit for righting\nthe bill of rights. So someone who picked on me for that is\nright. \n	By the way, we're the man in everything. Sports\nacademics and partying. I'm sure a lot of other schools are\ngood at what they do as well, so don't start mailing me junk.\nI'm happy where I am and maybe I'll go to one of y'alls medical\nschools in a couple of years.
So why not condemn the Mufti for his Nazi leanings, and condemn all his\nsupporters, while also condemning the similarly genocidal killing of\ninnocents, Muslim or not, in Bosnoia-Herzegovina? Hatred and bigotry\nremain just that, no matter who practices them.
OK. Lets look into this.\nAccording to my dictionary,\nZi-on-ism: an international movement orig. for the establishment of a Jewish\nnational or religious community in Palestine and later for the support of\nmodern Israel.\n\nNow, I do not support the establishment of nations based on religious \nprinciples, while I support the establishment of nations based on cultural\nidentities.\n\nSo. Here are some questions I have to ask for anyone to answer. My point\nis what someone said long time ago: In politics, like with men, it is important\nto distiguish between what they say they do and what they are actually\ndoing.\n\n1) My mother is Jewish (and so is my father). If I apply for the Law of\nReturn, do I get in as a Jew trying to return to his land, from which my\nfamily was expelled about 2000 years ago?\n2) If I go back, which nationality would my ID show?\n3) If I decided to go back to the land from which my relatives had been \nexpelled 2000 years ago, but first I convert to any other religion, can I \napply to the law of Return as a member of the Jewish Nation or should I \napply as someone whose mother is Jewish?\n4) Which nationality would show my ID in case 3)?\n5) What has change in me between the day before and the day after I converted\nto loose my being part of the Jewish Nation?\n6) Suppose I want to get married to my current wife, who is non-Jewish in\nIsrael, how do I do it?\n7) How would my situation change if I decided, after going back to\nIsrael, to convert to Islam?\n\n\nNow, here is one more question. I do believe that most people in a country\ndo not care about politics. They just want to be left alone.\nSuppose my father is Arab. Suppose he was born in Palestine, in some place \nwhich now is part of Israel. Suppose that his father, and his grandfather as\nwell as 20 or 30 generations before him were born in that place.\nNow suppose there is a war of independence and my father, scared by all the\nfighting going on, tries to take his family to a place more secure, among \npeople he knows, who speak a language he understands, who worship the same\ngod. Now, suppose that that place is some other Arab country. \nAnd, now suppose that the war is over and that there is a new country created\nwhere my father used to live, and that that country is called Israel.\nAnd, that in that country, Jews from all over the world are received. And\nthat people whose family left thet country 200 generation ago are recieved and\ngranted full-citizenship.\nShould I, if I decided to go back to my father's land, where he was born as\n20 or 30 generations of my family were born, have the right to go back and\nask to be recognized in the same way those who are returning after 2000\nyears?\n\nThen, finally, people ask me how I would define a Jew, but that is irrelevant.\nI am not talking about how I would define a Jew, but about how people in \nZionist organizations, and more important, in Israel, define a Jew.\nHow would those who are Zionist define a Jew?

I can accept every\n  word quoted from Halabi and still have ZERO evidence of any mosques\n  being razed.  Note that what Halabi refers to is not that mosques\n  were razed but that people PROTESTED alleged razing.  Too well we\n  know that this is a common demagogic tactic (or has anyone forgotten\n  the Temple Mount riots, when the Moslem crowd was led to believe\n  that the Israeli Guards were there to cover for the TMF instead of\n  stop them?)

I always believed the statement 'those who do not know their history\nare condemned to repeat it (Will Durant ?), but I am beginning to\nbelieve the opposite is true.\n\nHere in t.p.m and in other newsgroups it seems that history is\nmainly remembered to foment hatred or to be used as a club. In the\nhistory of my own people there are ample acts of shame, both done\nby my people and done to my people. Since I was not party to any\nof those acts, I refuse to accept blame for the evil acts that my\nancestors committed, nor do I direct hatred toward the descendants\nof those who committed evil acts against my ancestors.\n\nWill all of this discussion rebuild a single mosque? Will it rebuild\nthe Temple? Somehow I doubt that it will.\n\nA post in another group, on the Bosnian war, asked us all to love\neach other, that love would conquer hate. Sadly, I remember a TV\ninterview with a young woman in Sarajevo (sp?) who was as I remember,\na former olympic calibre contestant in the rifle shoot. She was now\ntrying to pick-off Serbian snipers. During the communist years she\nhad married a Serb, who was now fighting against her people. So it\nseems that hate will conquer love.\n\nIs there an odd chance that we might all forget past wrongs and try\nand see how we might all live together? It's a damn small planet,\nwhich we have come very close to turning into a radioactive ball,\nglowing softly in space. We seem to have been spared that prospect,\nshall we now bathe it in each other's blood?\n\nShalom, Salam, and Peace
Yedi'ot Ahronot, April 9, 1993.  Excerpt.\n\nEACH ONE AND HIS OWN NEVO*\n\n(* A reference to General Azri'el Nevo, Shamir's Military Secretary. \nIrrelevant to this excerpt.)\n\nBy Nahum Barne'a\n\n. . .\n\nIn mid '91 SHABAK found itself in the center of another storm [...]. \nA year and a half earlier, Khaled Sheikh Ali, 27, a member of the\nIslamic Jihad, died at the SHABAK installation in Gaza prison.  The\ntwo SHABAK interrogators who were responsible for his death were put\non trial. In September '91 the Supreme Court rejected their appeal and\nsentenced them to 6 months in prison.  As far as is known, this was\nthe first time in Israel's history that SHABAK operatives were sent to\nprison.  The Supreme Court unanimously rejected the warning by the\ndirector of SHABAK that the sentence will be detrimental the\neffectiveness of other interrogators. [...] The judges in the case\nwere [...] Barak, Goldberg, and Matza.\n\nWhen they realized that they were on their own, the interrogators\nagreed to talk.  Deputy State Attorney Rachel Sukkar[sp?] was placed\nin charge of investigating the affair.  She [...] questioned the\ndirectors of all SHABAK divisions.  She investigated only the matter\nof the death in Gaza prison.  She discovered that not only torture,\nbut also "the culture of lies", which Judge Landau had described in\nhis report of two years before, were still very much in existence. \nNothing had changed.\n\nThe report was classified and was seen by only some ten people, among\nthem the Prime Minister, the people at the top of the judicial system\nand Judge Landau.  The director of SHABAK claimed that he did not\nknow.  After all, they were dealing only with a single jail and with\nlow ranking people.  The system bit the bullet and accepted the\nexplanation.  One of SHABAK's high-ranking officials was transfered\nfrom his very high position to a less high position.\n\n. . .\n\n["The culture of lies" referred to above is the SHABAK interrogators'\npolicy of lying in court when denying detainees claims that they were\ntortured in the course of interrogation.  The Landau commission sought\nto correct this problem by legalizing a list of torture methods --\nthus eliminating the fear that a detainee might be released if those\nmethods were used to extract a confession.  The fact that the need to\nlie still persists would seem to indicate that SHABAK is not sticking\nto the "approved" torture methods. -- Yigal]
It is the Croats that were divided, at least 70,000 were left in Serbian\nprovince of Vojvodina. It is the Muslims that were divided, 200,000\nleft in the region of Sanjak that now belongs to Serbia. If the Serbs\nin Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina want self-determination, the same\nright should be given to Croats and Muslims, and Albanians and Hungarians\nin Serbia. Why should Serbia be exempted?
I couldn't agree more.  Canada has an anti-hate law which exists to punish\nthose who wilfully spread false propaganda (lies) for the purpose of \nputting down another group.  This is actually the law that David Irving\nwill hopefully be found guilty under due to his denial of the Holocaust.\nIt's too bad that this useless "Centre for Policy Research" isn't in Canada.\nIt'd set a nice precedent to how the law applies in Cyberspace.\n\n  Steve\n--
ERGINEL) asked:\n\n[EE] No, no flaming here. Just a simple question.\n\n...with a simple answer!\n\n[EE] As far as I know most of the Armenians belong to the Gregorian Orthodox\n[EE] faith and such was the case in nineteenth century Ottoman Empire. It is\n[EE] also known that some Armenian communities were converted into Catholicism\n[EE] and Protestantism by the Western European missionaries in this period. \n\nThe vast majority of Armenians in eastern Anatolia were Gregorian or Armenian\nApostolic. There was, however, a higher percentage of non-Gregorian Armenians \nin Cilicia, closer to the Mediterranean, in Adana, Marash, Aintab, etc.  \n\n[EE] Another known fact is that almost half of the Armenians living in Anatolia\n[EE] did not speak any Armenian, but used Turkish in their everyday lives.\n\nThis is not true. While it was forbidden for Armenians to speak Armenian in\ncertain areas of Cilician Armenia, most all Armenians spoke Armenian. In fact,\nTurks who interacted with Armenians also spoke Armenian! For sure, most all\nArmenians, especially men, also knew Turkish in order to function in larger \nsociety.\n\n[EE] My question is, given so many separations in the Armenian community, what\n[EE] was the common denominator of the Armenian people that allowed Armenian\n[EE] nationalism to emerge in the nineteenth century? As I stated, religion\n[EE] was not uniform (unlike the Greeks) and many Armenians couldn't even speak\n[EE] Armenian. I would like to know what factors brought the Armenians in the\n[EE] Ottoman Empire together and led to the formation of an Armenian \n[EE] consciousness.\n\nThe Armenians in Turkey were persecuted because they were Armenian, regardless\nof the specific branch of Christianity they professed. The resultant Armenian\nnationalism was in direct reaction to this persecution. Even at the later \nstages of WWI, and after the genocide, many Armenians who were converted to \nIslam were also exterminated because they continued as Armenian Moslems. This \npractice continued well into the 1920s by Ataturk in parallel with the policy \nof clearing out pockets of steadfast Islamic fundamentalism. Many of these\nconverted Armenians, ironically, in order to stay alive, were staunch Moslems. \n\n[EE] Any information will be appreciated.\n\nYou answered your own question! The common thread throughout your inquiry\nwas the word Armenian!\n\n[EE] Regards,
Pardon me? Your ignorance cramps my conversation. Although the administrative \nmechanism was a strictly centralized one, the Ottoman Empire 'was a classical \nexample of a pluralist social order.' The 'millet system' was the mechanism \nwhich shaped the social order of the multi-national Ottoman Empire and stood \nbehind its continuity. As a matter of fact, because Islamic principles \nwere in force in the Ottoman Empire, it was natural to use religious \ncriteria to differentiate among the various communities which constituted \nthe Empire. The 'millet' system began to be based on ethnicity in the \n19th century under the influence of nationalism. Sousa writes of the \nexistence of thirteen communities in the Ottoman Empire in addition to \nthe Muslim 'millet' in 1914. These were: (1) Greeks attached to the \nOrthodox Patriarchate in Istanbul; (2) Catholics or Latins who were \nremnants of Genoese and Venetian merchants; (3) Gregorian Armenians \nattached to a Patriarchate in Istanbul; (4) Catholic Armenians; (5) Syrian \nCatholics attached to a Patriarchate in Mardin; (6) Chaldean Catholics \nattached to a Patriarchate in Mosul; (7) Syrian Jacobites attached to a \nPatriarchate in Mardin; (8) Protestants; (9) Melchites attached to a \nPatriarchate in Damascus; (10) Hebrews of two rites; (11) Bulgarian \nCatholics attached to the Bulgarian Exarch; (12) Maronites; and (13) \nNestorians.[1] Scholars who studied the pluralistic social structure \noutlined briefly above, concluded that the social order of the Ottoman \nEmpire fit the framework of the 'Mosaics Theory.'[2] \n\n[1] N.

Meanwhile Saudia faces a civil war and goes to war \nwith Yemen/Sudan over it,  The new North African \nAlliance (Algeria/Tun/Libya) goes to war with Morocco who attacks it.\nU.S/France involved everywhere but cannot concentrate on one place, \nespecially that Syria/Jordan/Iraq have to be kept under control.\n\nAfter the cloud clears, I do not know what the end result will be,\n\nO.K back to reality:\n\n 	CAIRO, Egypt (UPI) -- The Cairo-based Arab Organization for Human\n Rights (AOHR) Sunday called on King Fahd of Saudi Arabia to order the\n release of members of the kingdom's first human rights group.
No one is forced to blow up airplanes.  Terrorism is a choice\nmade by people because they do not want to work for peace.\n\n\n	There are *lots* of military targets in Israel.  There are\nlots of legitamate targets in Israel.  Old ladies, children, and\ncivilians in general are not acceptable targets.\n\n	If the only person you can kill is a civilian, you hold your\nfire.  If that means you can't kill anyone, then you can't kill\nanyone.  Claiming that civilain targets are acceptable because they\nare easy kills is rediculous.\n\n\n	Did they make a policy of it?\n\n\n	Did you mean excuse? :)  Killing a soldier and killing a\ncivilian are two very different acts.\n\n\n	No, they killed soldiers so that the British government would\nleave.  The objective was not to scare civilains, but show that the cost\nof staying was way too high.  \n\n	In contrast, a terrorist kills civilains to scare other\ncivilains.  They use random violence against people to make a point\nthat no one is safe until their demands are met.  An analogy would be\nthe Irgun blowing up Harrods or 10 Downing.\n\n\n	Thats because you missed the essential point of arab\nterrorism, which is to scare civilains away from Israel, by killing\nthose who have something to do with Israel.  It is to kill Jews\nbecause they might be Zionists.  It is to kill people who live in\nIsrael because of where they live.  The targets are rarely soldiers,\nor other people who understand they might be attacked in the line of\nduty, but innocent civilians, to underscore the message that no one\nwho deals with Israel is safe.\n\n\n	Oh, you mean you favor the Israelis, outnumbered 2 to 1,\noutgunned, surrounded by hostile states only one of which has signed a\npeace treaty in 45 years?  You favor the Jews, people like Leon\nKlofhinger, a cripple who was thrown off a boat because he was Jewish?\nYou support the right of the Jewish people to live in peace?\n\n	Why, thank you for your support.\n\nAdam\n\nAdam Shostack 				       adam@das.harvard.edu
(1)\n\n   You know ed,...  You're right!  Andi shouldn't be comparing\n   Israel to the Nazis.  The Israelis are much worse than the\n   Nazis ever were anyway.  The Nazis did a lot of good for\n   Germany, and they would have succeeded if it weren't for the\n   damn Jews.  The Holocaust never happened anyway.  Ample\n   evidence given by George Schafer at Harvard, Dept. of History,\n   and even by Randolph Higgins at NYU, have shown that the\n   Holocaust was just a semitic conspiracy created to obtain\n   sympathy to piush for the creation of Israel.\n\n(2)\n\n   Just kidding.\n\nBe careful rj3s.

I don't mean to sound disrespectful, but since the majority\nof the contributors (and may be even readers) of this newsgroup seem\nto be muslims, christians and jews, my question could be of some \ninterest to any of them.\n        It's my impression that both Islam and Christianity pay great\nrespect to an obscure 1st century jewish lad from Judea/Galilee. Why \nthey chose this particular jew among all possible jews is a mystery\nto me (personally, I prefer Woody Allen - his stories are much juicier)\n- but perhaps it's an accident of history.\n        Anyway, it seems that they may be talking about two different\njews. According to the New Testament his father's name was Joseph,\nwhile in Qur'an he appears as Zachariah.  \n        Who's right and why the name difference? I'm really curious.\n                David.

Some articles on the topic: \n\n\nRTw  12/23 0859  GULF ARABS DEMAND IRAN WITHDRAWAL FROM ISLANDS \n\n (Eds: updates with end of summit details, quotes) \n    By Youssef Azmeh \n    ABU DHABI, Dec 23, Reuter - Gulf Arab states, emerging from a summit\nthat restored \ntheir unity after almost three months of crisis, piled pressure on Iran\non Wednesday to \nreverse its virtual annexation of a strategic Gulf island. \n    They issued a statement after a three-day Gulf Cooperation Council\nsummit saying Iran \nhad to show proof of its good neighbourly intentions by rescinding\nmeasures that "rocked \nGulf stability and security." \n    The leaders avoided the anti-Iranian rhetoric of recent statements\nby Egypt, which \nengineered a last minute settlement of a border row between Saudi Arabia\nand Qatar that \nallowed all members to attend the summit. \n    Egypt said its fears about Iranian intentions in the region and\nTehran's alleged \nencouragement of Moslem fundamentalist unrest were largely behind\nPresident Hosni \nMubarak's mediation. \n    The GCC statement stressed that developing relations between the\nGulf Arab states and \nIran "is linked to enhacing confidence and to measures Iran might take\nin line with its \ncommitment to the principle of good neighbourliness and the respect of\nthe sovreignty and \nterritorial integrity of the region's states." \n    It denounced Iran's measures on the island of Abu Musa, which it\nshares with the \nUnited Arab Emirates, and the continued occupation of the Greater and\nLesser Tumbs \nislands. \n    Iran earlier this year extended its control over Abu Musa beyond a\nsmall garrison it \nestablished there in 1971 under an agreement with the UAE emirate of Sharjah. \n    It has since rescinded orders expelling foreigners who worked on the\nisland for the \nUAE government. But diplomats say it continues to exercise its authority\nover the whole \nisland, which the UAE sess as as virtual annexation. \n    The Tumbs were occupied by the former Shah of Iran in 1971 and the\nUAE has since the \nAbu Musa crisis erupted insisted that they have to be returned as part\nof a general \nsettlement. \n    The GCC leaders called on the U.N. to maintain sanctions against\nIraq for not fully \nimplementing Security Council resolutions following its 1990 invasion of\nKuwait. \n    They endorsed once again the "Damascus Declaration," a pact signed\nwith Egypt and \nSyria after their troops took part in the U.S. led alliance that drove\nIraqi troops out of \nKuwait. \n    But delegates said the leaders were unable to agree the details of a\nfund they \nannounced they would create at their last summit in Kuwait last year\nwhich would have \nhelped Egypt's and Syria's economic development programme. \n    They said the leaders could not agree on a breakdown of\ncontributions from each state \nalthough the total amount had been scaled down to $6 billion from the\n$10 billion agreed \nlast year. \n    The fact that the leaders of all GCC states -- Saudi Arabia,\nBahrain, Kuwait, Oman and \nQatar -- attended the summit was seen as a major achievement although\ntheir unity was only \nmaintained with outside help. \n    Most delegations were not too worried for the moment about the slow\nprogress of the \nconservative rulers discussions on a future security structure for the\nregion that boasts \nthe bulk of global oil and gas reserves. \n    The leaders were unable to choose between two proposals. \n    One put forward by a summit committee headed by Oman's Sultan Qaboos\nto create a \n100,000-man rapid deployment force that could rush to defend any member\nagainst external \naggression, such as Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. \n    Another was a Saudi-supported plan to expand the existing 10,000-man\n"Peninsula \nShield" force which had so far played a largely symbolic role and is\ncommanded by a Saudi \ngeneral. \n    Little headway was made on plans for a reginal common market\nalthough the summit \ncalled for concrete proposals to be submitted to next year's summit due\nto be held in \nSaudi Arabia next December. \n REUTER YA DYA DJG \n\n\n\nRTw  12/23 0835  GULF LEADERS END SUMMIT \n\n    ABU DHABI, Dec 23, Reuter - Gulf Arab states ended a three-day\nannual summit on \nWednesday with an appeal to Iran to end its occupation of three\nstrategic Gulf islands as \na condition for restoring friendly ties across the Gulf. \n    A joint statement issued after the summit, marked by relief over the\nsettlement of a \nrow between two Gulf Cooperation Council members, also called for\ncontinued U.N. sanctions \nagainst Iraq. \n    It said Baghdad had failed to implement key Security Council\ndecisions following the \nexpulsion of its troops from Kuwait early last year. \n    The summit broke no new ground on steps to achieve a Gulf common\nmarket, but called on \nofficials to present a plan for common external tarrifs for all six\nmembers to the next \nsummit which will be held in Saudi Arabia in December 1993. \n    The statement stressed that developing relations between the Gulf\nArab states and Iran \n"is linked to enhacing confidence and to measures Iran might take in\nline with its \ncommitment to the principle of good neighbourliness and the respect of\nthe sovreignty and \nterritorial integrity of the region's states." \n    It denounced Iran's measures on the island of Abu Musa, which it\nshares with the \nUnited Arab Emirates, and the continued occupation of the smaller\nislands, the Greater and \nLesser Tumbs. \n    It expressed deep regret and extreme concern for the unjustified\nIranian measures \nwhich contradict a proclaimed wish to develop relations and called on\nIran to rescind \nthose measures and end the occupation which it said was "shaking peace\nand stability in \nthe area." \n    Iran earlier this year extended its control over Abu Musa beyond a\nsmall garrison it \nestablished there in 1971 under an agreement with the UAE emirate of Sharjah. \n    It has since rescinded orders expelling foreigners who worked on the\nisland for the \nUAE government but diplomats in the region say that its security forces\ncontinue to \nexercise their authority over the whole island. \n    The UAE has seen this as virtual annexation. \n    The Tumbs were occupied by the former Shah of Iran in 1971 and the\nUAE has since the \nAbu Musa crisis erupted insisted that they have to be returned as part\nof a general \nsettlement. \n REUTER YA DYA DJG \n\n\nRTw  12/26 1441  IRAN HINTS IT READY TO GO TO WAR OVER ISLANDS \n\n (Eds: updates with SNSC statement) \n    NICOSIA, Dec 26, Reuter - Iran told its Gulf Arab neighbours on\nSaturday it was ready \nto defend militarily three disputed islands, reminding them of its\neight-year war with \nIraq. \n    "Our eight-year defence (in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war) has proved to\nthe world that \nour brave nation will never hesitate to defend the sovereignty and\nsafeguard the \nterritorial integrity of Iran," Iran's Supreme National Security Council\n(SNSC) said. \n    A meeting of the heads of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council\nvoiced full support \non Wednesday for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in its dispute with Iran\nover the Gulf \nislands of Abu Musa, Greater Tumb and Lesser Tumb. \n    The move has triggered strong Iranian criticism and warnings.\nBesides the UAE, the GCC \nalso groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. \n    Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who chaired the SNSC's\nmeeting on \nSaturday, said during his Friday prayer sermon at Tehran University:\n"Iran is surely \nstronger than the likes of you. To reach these islands one has to cross\na sea of blood." \n    The SNSC, quoted by the official Iranian news agency IRNA received\nin Cyprus, also \ncriticised the GCC and described its support of the UAE as "irresponsible." \n   "No country will ever be able to covet even an inch of Iranian soil,"\nsaid the SNSC. \n    Earlier on Saturday, the English language Tehran Times, believed to\nbe close to the \nForeign Ministry, said the UAE should be aware that Iran's\nself-restraint had certain \nlimits. \n    It dismissed a UAE claim to the islands as unfounded and said a 1971\nagreement to \nshare Abu Musa with the UAE emirate of Sharjah still applied. \n    "The idea of Abu Dhabi officials that Tehran would always refrain\nfrom responding to \nthe blows inflicted by them was "childish," Tehran Times said. \n    IRNA said the newspaper was commenting on the GCC statement which\nurged Iran to \nreverse what it says is the annexation of Abu Musa island and to pull\nout of the two other \nislands. \n    Iran says the islands near the entrance to the Gulf have\nhistorically belonged to it. \nThe dispute flared this year after Iran tightened its control over Abu Musa. \n REUTER AF JCH \n\nRTw  12/28 1011  TEHRAN PAPER WANTS IRAN REVIVE CLAIM TO BAHRAIN

This is a \ncritical point in the history of world and we can make a change otherwise things\nwill not change there in Bosnia..

It happened\nto the Jews in 1940's, it's happening to the muslims today and who will be the next\nvictim??\n\nSince the Europeans want to remain indifferent in this issue, time has come for US to\ntake a leadership role to stop these crimes against humanity. Time is now and\nthis is for real folks, the people of New England Bosnian Relief Committee seriously believe\nthat Clinton's Adminstration will stop supporting the Bosnian cause without sustained\npublic pressure. I just called Democaratic Sen. John Kerry's office and they are saying that \nhe (the senator) is waiting for president to take a decision, means that he will wait and \njoin the band-wagon later if it ever moves! \n\nPlease don't rely on others to take part in this demonstration -You as an individual\nwill make a big difference. Bring your families too, not only you will help a great\ncause but also it will be fun for all. I know of several families from Massachusetts\nwho are travelling friday night to participate there.

You are somewhat close to truth. But you shouldn't forget that\nnationality is a recent invention of the western europe. In the\ndays of the Ottoman empire, the religion was the main point of\ndifference between social classes. The Ottomans didn't recognize\nTurks, Arabs, Greeks, Serbs... Just christians, muslims, jews...\nSo, for all the interested parties in the Ottoman society the\nbosnian muslims were "Turks". After all, there aren't many "real" \n(ethnic) Turks living even in Turkey today. Even in Europe, it's\nthe culture that defines the ethnicity and religion is part of\none's culture.\n\n\nCan you support this?

The conditions were\nwonderful, thanks to our Armenians, who received us. But it's not relaxing all\nthe same. I don't know how everyone else feels about it, but for me it's \ntorture. We don't have a place to call our own. I had a two bedroom apartment \nin Sumgait, my children went to school and we lived well, in friendship. It's \npainful that in our times, in 1988, in the Soviet period, people can break \ninto our apartment and try to kill me and my children, in whom I've put all my\nefforts and my whole youth. Everything was going well for us: my older \ndaughter was studying at the Institute, the middle one was preparing to enter \nmedical school and was interning as an orderly, and my youngest had been sick \nfor a long time, but had returned to health. I have been though a lot in my \nlife: it's been seven years since I lost my husband, I raised my children by \nmyself. Lots of women have similar fates, but there's nothing to be done about\nit. But I can't control myself when I remember what happened in Sumgait on \nFebruary 27, 28, and 29, it was just a horror, it's indescribable.\n\nOn February 27 our relative, Ira, came to visit us. She's better friends with\nmy oldest daughter, and so right away she asked, "Where's Vika?" I say,\n"Vika's off in Pirkuli on a trip for three days, she's supposed to come back\ntomorrow." My middle daughter, Gaya, had baked a cake and we sat there talking\nand laughing, drinking tea. Then Gaya and Diana went to walk Ira home.\n\nThey left and a few minutes went by; suddenly I hear noise. I raced out to\nthe balcony--our balcony is right across from the bus station, we live at the\ncorner of Mir and Druzhba Streets--I look and see that there are hoards of\npeople near the bus station and they're all shouting something. What they're\nshouting I can't understand. Our neighbor is standing on his balcony, too. I\nask, "Nufar, what's happened?" He says, "I don't know, I can't figure it out\neither." I got scared--the kids had gone outside, and I wanted to run after\nthem, but then there was a knock at the door. I open the door and it's the\nkids. "Mamma," says Gayane, "you'll never believe what's going on out there! \nIt's awful!" Ira says, "Aunt Zina, they're shouting, 'Karabagh! Karabagh! \nKarabagh is ours!' We didn't know what was going on. They're threatening to \ndrive out the Armenians and slaughter them."\n\nI called my brother, and his wife answered the phone. I said, "Aunt Tamara, \ndon't worry, Ira is staying here with us, and we'll see her home later." I \ncouldn't shut my eyes all night long, even until morning. I was worried about\nVika. My God, what was going on, what had happened?!\n\n-Gayane: That day, on the 27th, we stood on the balcony and observed what was \nhappening, although Mamma wouldn't allow us to watch all of it. There weren't \n50 yards between our building and the bus station. We could see and hear \neverything perfectly. They were stopping buses, dragging people out, leading \nall the passengers out, looking for Armenians. If they found an Armenian on \nthe bus, then it started . . .I don't know what to call it . . .\n\n-Zinaida: It's called slaughter.\n\n-Gayane: The mob would descend on people and beat them. I don't know if they \nwere killing them or not, but when they left them, they lay still, not moving,\nas though nothing was left of them. One person was lying there and they \nstarted dragging him. The police were standing right there, to the side, not \ndoing anything, they didn't take any steps to calm that mob.\n\nIt was awful to stand there and watch it all from the balcony. And you \ncouldn't go anywhere, somehow . . . you wanted to be able to see everything\nso as to tell of it later. We wanted to leave Sumgait that day. What kept us\nwas the idea that we live in the Soviet Union, and that something would be\ndone about it. Where in the world was our government?!\n\n-Zinaida: We couldn't leave town, of course, because our older daughter wasn't\nhome. And at the same time I was terrified for Gaya and Diana. On Sunday \nmorning when I went to see Ira home, our neighbor said, "Zin', you know they \nwent into Valodya's house and smashed everything he had. They murdered his \nfather and two sons." Valodya is our neighbor, he's an Armenian, he lives on \nthe first floor. I think, my God, what is happening?! And in broad daylight!\n\nI saw Ira home and when on the way back I came across a mob shouting "Slay the\nArmenians! Karabagh is ours!" This was at 12 o'clock in the afternoon. On the \nway I stopped into a bread store and the saleswoman says, "They beat our store\nmanager, they thought he was an Armenian and they beat him, but he was an \nAzerbaijani." And I asked, "Did they kill him?" She says, "No, he's in serious\ncondition." I left there and started to walk home on that same street, but the\nmob started moving in my direction. I turned off the street and went down the \nlittle way that goes toward the Sputnik store. There I met another crowd, but \nthese weren't bandits, these were our people from Sumgait. I was so frightened\nthat I walked without knowing where was going, I couldn't feel my legs or the \nground under my feet. I was walking and there was a boy standing before my \neyes. This was on the 27th, around evening time. He ran under our balcony, and\nthe mob surged toward him shouting, "He's an Armenian, get him!" He wore a \nblack coat. They grabbed him, that boy, near the bus stop, I saw it. They \ngrabbed him by the legs and struck his head on the asphalt.\n\nI made it home but I just couldn't calm down. My oldest daughter was in my \nthoughts. I was thinking, my daughter's coming home now, they'll stop her bus \nand she'll be gone. There's no police, no protection, nothing. It's like they \nhad all died, there's no one, nothing, no authorities whatsoever. I can't even\nfind the words for it! I look and see an Ikarus arriving. Before going to the \nbus station they stop near our place, across from the Kosmos movie theater. So\nthis Ikarus stops  there and the gang is yelling, the Azerbaijanis are running\ntoward it yelling, "Armenians out!" And I see them take the Armenians and beat\nthem, killing them. I can't watch it any more. It was a nightmare. I just \ncouldn't watch it. But Gaya was standing there watching it, and I scolded her.\nShe says, "Mamma, I have to see it, I have to know what's happening, I have to\nsee it with my own eyes so I can tell our people of it later. So our children \nwill know."\n\nGayane: We saw a great deal on the 27th. They caught no less than 20 people\nbefore my eyes. I can't say for sure if they killed them or not . . .\n\n-Zinaida: There were too many people there, the mob was too big. You couldn't \nmake anything out. But I saw that boy in the black coat with my own eyes. He\nwas 18 or 19 years old.\n\n-Gayane: I think he was older, probably, about 22. A tall fellow, a big guy, \nin a coat. He was walking quickly, but when they shouted that he was an\nArmenian, he tore off running. And the mob went after him. They caught him \nright under our balcony. I don't know. I don't think there could have been \nmuch left of him after that. You can imagine what happens when a crowd attacks\none person. It was a mob, big, angry, and featureless. You know, there was a \nsimilarity in the way they were dressed, mostly they were wearing long black \ncoats. You couldn't even tell them apart, they were all wearing black and they\nall looked alike.\n\n-Zinaida: When they picked up that boy and struck him against the asphalt and \nhe cried "Mamma!" I ran into the room. I couldn't watch any longer. An awful \nlot was going on right then, in various places, it wasn't only that boy, \nseveral people were being beaten up. You couldn't see all of it at once, but \nwhen that boy cried "Mamma!" I immediately started watching only him.\n\n-Gayane: On that first day it went on from about six in the morning until\ntwelve at night. At midnight they dispersed and the police took their place.\nThey were scattered about in all districts. But how can you explain the fact\nthat by morning, when it had already started getting light, around seven\no'clock, our police were gone? The police disappeared and yielded their\npositions to the bandits. In the morning they started gathering at our inter-\nsection again, at the bus station and at the entrance to downtown. From\nmorning on all the roads and mass transit stops were covered, and by nine\no'clock you couldn't even see the ground. There were thousands of people in\nthe crowd. Again they began stopping vehicles and checking for Armenians.\n\n-Zinaida: They had signals. I realized that when I noticed that they made a \ncross with their arms, they crossed their arms over their heads. The cross,\nevidently, meant that the vehicle had Armenians in it. They let the\nAzerbaijani cars through, and they stopped the Armenian ones and started\ntheir pogrom.\n\n-Gayane: They stopped a white Zhiguli and asked the driver what his \nnationality was. He got out and said they were from Baku. "But what is your\nnationality?" He says Armenian. They immediately start shouting, "Ermeni,\nErmeni!" And he says, "What's going on? I'm coming from Baku. I don't live\nin Sumgait." "Doesn't matter, who cares if you're from Baku or Sumgait."\nAnyway the crowd pounced on him and started beating him, and they dragged a \nwoman--his wife, probably--out of the car. At this point the police came and \ntook the two and led them away. Then the mob started smashing the car, and \nthen burned it. The flames blazed . . . it was a horrible fire! Then everyone \nran away, they thought the car was going to explode. About 20 minutes later \nanother car comes along, a green Moskvich. They ran up shouting "Ermeni! \nErmeni!" But this time they didn't pull the people out of the car, they didn't\nbeat them. Maybe they burned them along with the car, because no one emerged \nfrom the flames. The neighbor boy Vakhit was standing on the balcony too, \nacquaintances of his walked by below, and he asked them and they said, "Yes, \nthey burned them along with the car." About two hours later a whole wedding \nprocession came by, and there was a doll on the first car. We thought they \nwere Armenians, but the cars started to honk loudly. They were Azerbaijanis, \nand they were immediately allowed through.\n\n-Zinaida: The driver waved his hand as if to say 'get out of the way.' The\nwhole crowd parted and the procession passed through freely.\n\n-Gayane: By the way, at the marriage hall, which is right in the courtyard\nof our building, there was a wedding that day. The Azerbaijanis were cele-\nbrating and dancing. On the streets there was grief and death, people were\nbeing killed, and people were celebrating the whole time.\n\n-Zinaida: Before the apartment itself was attacked I asked Gaya to call and \nfind out when the tourist bus was supposed to arrive. She went to her \ngirlfriend's in the building, she lives in the first entryway, on the third \nfloor. Gaya came back and said, "Mamma, the bus is supposed to come around\neight, after eight." You can imagine what I was feeling, how hard it was:\nVika knew nothing about what was happening and was coming to meet her death. \nThen I heard shouting. I raced to the window and see that the belongings of \nour neighbors from the second entryway are being thrown outdoors. They were \nthrashing about with the pillows and the feathers were lying like snow. I \nstarted to cry. I am walking around the room, crying, wailing: Vika's not \nhere, what will come of her . . . Gaya, of course, was consoling me: "Mamma, \nnothing will happen to her, don't worry, calm down, she's in good company, \nthey'll look out for her."\n\nDiana: I saw the green car burn. The car was burning when we went out onto the\nbalcony. Gaya pushed me away, telling me to get off the balcony. I left. Then \nthey came up to the balcony and asked if there were any Armenians here.\n\n-Zinaida: You're right, I forgot about that, that was on the 27th.\n\nDiana: There's a small, grassy area in front of our balcony; there are trees\nplanted there. The mob asked if there were any Armenians in the building.\nAll the neighbors said, no, there are no Armenians here. There weren't a lot\nof Armenians in our building, but there weren't just a few Armenian families, \neither.\n\n-Gayane: They fell upon the apartments on the 28th. There were terribly many \nof them. Our courtyard is huge, and it was completely filled with them.\n\n-Zinaida: Katusev had made an appearance on television earlier. He said that \ntwo people, Azerbaijanis, had been killed in Karabagh. And when he said that \n. . . you know how bees sound, have you heard how they buzz? It was like the \nbuzzing of millions of bees . . . and with this buzzing they flew into our \ncourtyard, howling and shouting. I don't know how to describe it. By this \npoint we were afraid to watch from the balcony, but when I looked out of the \nbedroom window--the Znaniye Bookstore is down there, and Armenians live on the \nsecond and fourth floors--I saw their things being thrown out the windows. I \nrealized that they would be upon us any minute. I shouted to Gayane, "Gaya, \nhide the gold." That's honestly what I told my child. I grabbed Diana. I \ndidn't know what to do! Vika still wasn't home, and it was already getting \ndark. I was afraid to look at the time because I was already horrified as it \nwas.\n\n-Gayane: Just in case, we changed the television channel from the Moscow \nstation to the Azerbaijani one.\n\n-Zinaida: And turned it up loud.\n\n-Gayane: We never listened to Azerbaijani music. It just didn't do much for \nus. In all those years we almost never listened to it. But sometimes we would\nwatch some entertainment show or film on Azerbaijani television. And that was \nit. And here we had it turned up full blast. So they would think we were \nAzerbaijanis.\n\n-Zinaida: Well you can imagine, they're slaughtering Armenians, robbing them, \nand we're listening to this concert music from Baku. Our Azerbaijani neighbors\nsuggested we do it, they knocked on the door and told Gaya to turn on \nAzerbaijani music. But we already had it on anyway. Turn on the lights, they \ntold us, so they will think you're not Armenians. They're saying the Armenians\nare afraid to turn on their lights, they're hiding.\n\n-Gayane: Apparently there was some kind of arrangement, because we noticed \nthat the lights were off only in Armenian apartments, that is, the \nAzerbaijanis were warned, and every last one of them had their lights on.\nWhen we turned the lights off two of our neighbors came immediately, and\nlater, another one. "Turn on the lights," they told us, "please. Nothing will\nhappen. Be calm. Nothing will happen."\n\n-Zinaida: "We won't allow them to come into your apartment."\n\n-Gayane: We believed those people. We had never done anything bad to them.\n\n  -Zinaida: After the whole nightmare, about March 15, before we left for\nArmenia, when I was coming into the building they were all crying. The\nAzerbaijanis were crying, saying, "Can it be there is no God? How could\nthey raise their hands against your family? You never did anyone any harm,\nyou never refused anyone anything, not in hard times, or in time of fortune,\nor in time of mourning. How could they give you away? How could they sell you \ndown the river?" They really had given us away. Some of them protected us, but\nothers gave us away. They sold us down the river.\n\n-Gayane: I was wearing slacks that day, and when it all began I became \ncautious for some reason and I changed my clothes. Azerbaijani women don't \nwear pants. Young Armenian and Russian girls in Sumgait wore pants, but the \nAzerbaijanis found that very strange. And I thought I better put on a skirt, \notherwise they won't believe me if I told them we were Azerbaijanis. There was\nnothing else we could do. No other way out. I was forced to turn myself into \nGod knows who. I let my hair down, tousled it, and threw a scarf over my head.\n\n-Zinaida: And she told me, "Mamma, you hide. Take Diana and go into the other \nroom. You two look more like Armenians. They'll figure out that we're \nArmenians right away." But how could I go away and leave her there?!\n\n-Gayane: I went out onto the balcony. It worked out better that way. We were \nthe only Armenian family in the fourth entryway. This gave us hope: we were \nthe only ones, the neighbors wouldn't let them in. They, the Azerbaijanis, \nwould fear for themselves and for their children. I looked and saw someone \ncrawling up on the balcony from below, it was easy to get up onto our balcony.\nWhen we would lose the keys the neighbors would let up into their places and \nwe would crawl across onto our balcony and get in that way. So I turned around\nand saw a guy with a knife on our balcony. He looks at me and shouts, "What \nnationality are you here?"\n\n-Zinaida: At the same time they were knocking on the door.\n\n-Gayane: "What nationality are you?" he's shouting. Well at first I was\nfrightened, but then I got control of myself and answered in perfect \nAzerbaijani, "You should be ashamed of yourself, asking a question like that.\nCan't you see I'm an Azerbaijani? If I were an Armenian would I come out to \nmeet you face to face and look you in the eyes?" He looks at me and tells the\npeople with him, "Yes, Azerbaijanis live here." From below they tell him,\n"Check it out, it can't be, they have to be Armenians." And he asks me again,\n"What nationality are you?" I say, "Can't you see?" I started fuming. I could\nnot say anything else. "You're blind, that's for sure! You can yell all you\nwant, but that won't make us Armenians." I hear them breaking down our\ndoor, and Mamma went toward the door. I say, "I don't have time to deal\nwith you, they're breaking down our door." 1 go to the door and ask, "Who is\nit?" They answer, "Open up!" I say, "Wait, why are you breaking the door?\nWhat's going on? I'm opening up." We never locked the lower lock, it was\nbroken, but now they had locked it out of fear, and I couldn't get it open. I\nsay wait, I'm looking for the key. I opened the door--it was almost broken\ndown already. I opened the door and they burst in. I say, "What's going on?\nWhy are you breaking down our door?"\n\n-Zinaida: Then they started climbing in from the balcony. They're shouting, \n"Why don't you open the door?" And I say, "Well you've already come in the \nbalcony." Then Diana sees their knives, runs into the bathroom, and closes the\ndoor. Gaya cries out, "Mamma, Diana ran into the bathroom!" I ran to the door \nand forgot that we were pretending to be Azerbaijanis, and said in Armenian: \n"Diana, open the door!" Gaya tried to calm them down, and I'm shouting with\ntears in my eyes for Diana to open the door.\n\n-Diana I was sitting on the couch with my doll, Little Red Riding Hood. That \nguy climbed in from the balcony with a big knife with a yellow handle. They \nput it up to Mamma's stomach. I ran to the bathroom, opened the door, and \nslammed it behind me. I was frightened, and started to cry. I shouted, "Mamma,\nthey want to kill you!" And then . . . then they started shouting, "Give us \nyour passports." And Gaya says, "What do you need passports for, we're \nAzerbaijanis."\n\n-Gayane: I tried to convince them that we were Azerbaijanis, I was trying\neverything I could, I could get on my knees and plead. I could humble myself, \nbecause at that moment I was worried about other lives than just my own. To be\nhonest I didn't care about anything else, as long as my little sister would \nsurvive, her life and health had cost us so dearly! I tell them, "What, don't \nyou understand anything?" They started shouting, they were tremendously \nexcited, shouting with terribly loud voices, saying that in Stepanakert their \ngirls were being killed, raped, and tossed around with pitchforks. Why \nshouldn't they do the same to us? I said, "Who's doing all that? Who is doing \nit? Some Armenians! What does that have to do with us? Give me the knife, I'll\ncut my own face." "Now you calm down," they tell me.\n\nZinaida: I told them, "Why didn't you deal with them there! There, in \nKarabakh? Nothing has happened here, no one has been fighting here, not we \nwith the Armenians, nor they with us. Why didn't you give it right back to\nthem there? What've we got to do with this?" I got confused. I had been\nsaying that we were Azerbaijanis, but suddenly I started speaking as though\nI were an Armenian, but they didn't notice. One of them was next to me,\nwith a knife at my breast. And he says to the others, "What pretty girls." He\nmeant Gaya and my 10-year-old Diana. I was terrified. Gaya started assuring \nthem that we were Azerbaijanis. One guy stood in the doorway and gave us bad \nlooks.\n\n-Gayane: He demanded the passports. I said, "Young man, I don't have my \npassport here." He says, "Let's have the passport, we won't believe you\nwithout your passport." And one of them started hurriedly searching for\ndocuments. They turned the wardrobe in the other room upside down, took the \npicture off the wall, and started pulling the clothes off their hooks, yelling\nand shouting, "Passport! Passport!" They all started yelling, there was so \nmuch noise in the apartment. They were all shouting. My hair stood on end. \nSuddenly I said, "Listen, my Papa died, 40 days haven't passed yet, we have a \nMuslim household, we're in mourning, you should be ashamed of yourselves, \nyou've disgraced your honor." And then Mamma started to cry.\n\n-Zinaida: I started crying: "My husband died, 40 days haven't yet passed,\naren't you ashamed of yourselves!" In fact my husband had died seven years\nearlier, in 1981. "We're in mourning, and you burst in here demanding docu-\nments. The documents are at the housing office, I'm filing for my pension."\nWell it seemed like they believed us. Then one guy said, "They're Lezgins.\nCan't you see, there are no men here, only women. Leave." Another fellow in\nthe group agreed with him, he also said that we were Lezgins. But a third\nsaid, "No, they're Armenians." Well the other two convinced him, I don t know \nhow, and all the rest of them listened to them too. There were about 50 of \nthem, if not more, all in our three-room apartment, even the entryway was \nfilled. They started leaving. Yes, we're Lezgins, we're Lezgins." They started\nleaving, and one of them took our tape recorder with him. And the one who had \nfirst called us Lezgins says, "Leave that, what are you doing?" They seemed to\nobey that guy.\n\n-Gayane: He was tall, wearing baggy jeans and a coat.\n\n-Zinaida: With a little moustache, I think.\n\n-Gayane: No, he didn't have a moustache, he was tall with brown hair, he \nwasn't a bad-looking sort. He didn't have anything in his hands.\n\n-Zinaida: He stood at the threshold.\n\n-Gayane: Yes, he didn't look like a bad guy, and you know, his face seemed \nfamiliar to me. I had seen him somewhere. And more than once. But I can't \nremember where. When he came in I was stupefied, I had a premonition that he \nwouldn't be able to remain indifferent. When he said that we were Lezgins and \nthat they should leave, such gladness started to glow inside of me. Hope. They\ncontinued to argue on their way out. Some said, "They're Armenians all the \nsame." And that fellow answered, "even if they are Armenians, it's shameful,\nthe father died, they're mourning, there's nothing but women in the house, \nthere's no men. We should stay out of the apartment." "What do you mean, stay \nout? We can go in there!" And he said, "No, we should stay out, they're \nLezgins, we're leaving here." The three of them protected us.\n\n   -Zinaida: No, the two of them. The one in the short coat and the one in the\ngrey suit, who stood at the threshold, about 19 or 20 years old. Well they\nwere all young really. The two of them defended us.\n\n-Diana: Three, three!\n\n-Zinaida: Do you remember the third one, Diana?\n\n-Diana: Yes, he was wearing dark clothes.\n\n-Gayane: The third one was the one who came back. He wore a long brown coat.\n\n-Diana: He wore a long, darkish brown coat, and his hair was dark too. When \nthey left, they told him downstairs that those women were Armenians, and ran \nback and said that they were going to kill us.\n\n-Zinaida: They had all left, and we had started to calm down a little, and I\nclosed the door. And then there is a knock. I told Gaya, "Take Diana and go\ninto the other room." My daughters went into the dining room, and I opened the\ndoor. There was a guy there who said, "Run, hide! They're coming to kill you \nnow!" We ran up to the third floor. We had some good neighbors up there,\nAzerbaijanis. I sent the kids and stood there alone, not knowing what to do. \nI was so far gone . . . Out of a whole room I couldn't even think of anything \nto take. I even forgot to take my work documents; at the time I had been \npreparing a report to send to Baku, and the documents were at home. I couldn't\nsee anything . . . I could only see Vika, my older daughter. I sent Gaya and \nDiana upstairs, and stood there asking that fellow, "Should I close the door \nand leave everything like this?" He says, "What do you mean, door? Get out of \nhere, they're coming to kill you! What are you standing there for?" And I ran \nafter the children.\n\n-Gayane: We barely had time to get up to the third floor when they burst into \nour apartment and started shouting, "Where are the Armenians?" We were already\nat the neighbors'. They had an infant at the time, and the neighbor said, \n"Don't you worry, I'm not letting anyone in this apartment no matter what."\n\n-Zinaida: On the third floor there I started asking the folks, our neighbors,\nto go meet Vika. The bus was due to arrive at eight o'clock. I dissolved in\ntears, Gaya was soothing me, Diana was next to us, she was crying too, and I'm\nalready thinking that I've lost my older daughter, but deep in my heart I \nstill believe she's alive . . . And my tears choked me. I was going out of my\nmind. But no one could leave the building, the courtyard was packed with\npeople, swarming with them. From the balcony the neighbor in whose apartment \nwe were hiding asked the bandits, "Where are those Armenians, the ones who \nwere at home? Where did they make off to?" They told him they didn't know. \nThey asked him where he lived. He answered, "Can't you see, on the third \nfloor." He asked them specially to divert attention from his own apartment. We\nheard them taking free reign of our apartment, and they threw our color \ntelevision off the balcony and it exploded.\n\n-Gayane: Mamma was crying the whole time. She fell into a faint and we brought\nher around and held her back, because the whole time she kept making for the \ndoor to go outside, alternately raving and sobbing, shouting, and calling \nVika. She didn't notice us, probably because we were next to her. Her thoughts\nwere only on Vika. The neighbors who were hiding us were calming her too, \noffering tea.\n\n-Zinaida: We are very grateful to them. Thanks to them my children and I are\nalive, well, and unharmed. When they were throwing our belongings out and \nburning them--the beds, the pillows, and the chairs--our neighbor came to us \nand said, "How lucky you are that it's not you standing there naked, but some \nother woman instead. You're from our part of the building you lost your \nhusband, you have children, thank God you're not in her position, we wouldn't \nhave been able to take it. I don't know what I would do." He of course \nwouldn't have done anything, he was just trying to calm us down. In the yard \nthey were torturing our neighbors, fellow Armenians They lived on the fifth \nfloor, in the third entryway. A married couple, Vanya and Nina, and their \nthree children. Their last name is V. They hid their two daughters, and stayed\nwith their son to defend themselves, they even got boiling water ready, and an\naxe, and held them off for a long time, but the . . . They beat up the \nhusband, dragged the wife outside, and stood her naked next to our burning \nthings; her husband was lying at her feet on the ground. The crowd shouted, \n"Look at the naked Armenian!" They were going to throw the poor woman into the\nfire. The neighbors came out, an Azerbaijani woman threw her a scarf, and she \ncovered herself with it, and the neighbors led her off to their apartment. \nAll the neighbors saw and heard it . . .\n\n-Gayane: Mamma wouldn't allow it but I went to the window and saw her standing\nthere, and they took skewers that had been heated in the fire and stuck them \ninto her body. Our neighbor, who lived in the same entryway as Nina--she \nlives with us in the same boarding house now--saw what they had done, Nina \nshowed her, from her knees up, almost up to her neck, her whole body was \ncovered, riddled, with wounds.\n\n-Zinaida: In the morning, during the night of the 29th, rather, after one\no'clock, two buses approached the station. I wanted to run out. By then I\ndidn't care any more if I lived or died, but Gayane wouldn't let me go, and\nthe neighbors said that I would bring disaster to them and they would be\nslain along with their children. Gaya was crying and said that I forgot about\nthem, my other children, but I could only think of Vika. I imagined her torn\nto pieces, I'm a mother, and they're just children, they don't understand I\nwould have jumped off the balcony and run to the soldiers for help. I was\ngoing to do it but Gayane wouldn't let me: "Mamma, please! Mamma, I beg of \nyou!" The neighbors were sleeping and Gayane woke them with her cries. So we \nheld on that way till morning.\n\nOn the morning of the 29th I told our neighbor I was going to go downstairs to\nour apartment, maybe Vika was lying there, murdered. He told me he would go \nhimself. He was gone for about five minutes, but it seemed like an eternity to\nme. He returned and said there was no one there, nothing. I went down too, \nstole down like a mouse, and slipped in everything was thrown all about. I \ndidn't go to the soldiers because the armored personnel carriers were far \naway, farther than the bus station. I began looking for the briefcase with my \nwork in it. I was miserable because of my daughter, and at the same time \nbecause of my work. My documents were there, my travel papers--I worked in the\ntransport division -- and my trip sheets.\n\n-Gayane: Mamma is a very responsible person, she was always ready to work \naround the clock to do her job.\n\n-Zinaida: I look around and I can't find the briefcase. I didn't care about \nthe fact that everything had been stolen out of all three of my rooms, that\neverything was smashed, and the furniture was broken, I worried about that\nlater, but at first I was concerned about the lost documents. I went into the\nkitchen. My daughter had hidden some valuables in the gas stove: my ring and \nmy earrings. It was all there. Five minutes passed and Gayane ran in and said,\n"Mamma, hurry." And Diana came downstairs too. Gayane found  her coat among \nthe debris, and Diana found her track shoes, her coat, and some of her \ndresses.\n\n-Diana: Immediately after we got back up to the neighbors they started \nthrowing things around in the apartment under us. They threw a television onto\nthe asphalt, it exploded so violently it sounded like a thunderclap. Then, \nwhen Vika wasn't there, I wouldn't eat, and they forced me, but I couldn't \neat. Because I loved Vika terribly and she and I had always gone to the movies\nand gone for walks in the park. When we went into our apartment the next day \nand everything was broken, right away I started looking for my dolls and my \nbooks, but I didn't see anything. When we went back upstairs I managed to take\ntwo cups from my tea service, and Gaya took Vika's suit and one of her own \ndresses. My Italian boots were gone, my brown coat, it was beautiful, there \nwasn't a one of my beautiful dolls, and my giant lion was gone too, the one \nthat had been on top of the television. He was very large and very handsome. \nI had two satchels, one for first grade and the other for second grade, one \nwas yellow-green with a boy and a girl on it, they're playing a drum and a \nviolin, and there is a dog sitting there closing its ears, and on the other \none were the letters A, B, C, D, E and the numbers 4+5, two girls and a boy \nwith their mouths open like they are singing. They were beautiful satchels. \nThey were gone too. I had many books, I collected them, they were in the \nbedside tables. And a boy had given me a little apron and a headband for my \nbirthday, they weren't around either. And I had some big books, fat ones, and \nthey disappeared, only one was left, The Malachite Box. The Adventures of \nKarlson, Pippi Longstockings, and Fairy Tales of the World were left. All the \nother books were gone.\n\n-Zinaida: I continued searching for my briefcase, and then my supervisor\narrived. He had waited for me until nine o'clock, but I didn't appear, and he\nthought something must have happened, so he came. He's a Russian, Aleksei \nSemyonovich Lomakin. Alik Aliyev, the mechanic, came with him. When they saw \nmy wrecked apartment they were just petrified, they could not say a thing. \nWhen I saw them I started crying. My Azerbaijani neighbors came in. Some of \nthem were crying, others were helping me pick up. I go on looking for my \ndocuments and at the same time put things into the wardrobe. Now that I \nremember it it's both funny and painful: How could I have thought that I had \nreturned to my apartment and that everything had gone back to normal? \nIncidentally, later, when I went back to the apartment again those things were\ngone too. And the door was gone. After my supervisor left, in the afternoon, \nthe neighbor said that we should leave, find another refuge. "I'm afraid," he \nsaid, "that someone saw you come to my apartment, and that they could kill you\nand us too. My God, where could I go it was daytime and those . . . I don't \neven know what to call them, the bandits, those marauders, those jackals, I \ndon't know what to call them, I can't find the words, they were everywhere. \nWhere should I go with two girls? When I opened the door I had tears in my \neyes, and I was terrified . . . And he said, "Go to Alik's, he's an\nAzerbaijani, too." and I say, "You should have said that earlier, when my \nsupervisor was here with the car, he could have taken us with him." Everyone \nfeared for their own lives. What could I do? I went out into the entryway and \nstood. And he says, "any other time I would keep you here a year, or two. But \nright now, I'm sorry . . . " Then another door opened, also on the third \nfloor. I ask the neighbor, "Tayara, can we hide at your place?" She's an \nAzerbaijani too. She says, "What kind of question is that? Come in!" She hid \nus. There were many people in the courtyard, and Gaya and I hid in the \nwardrobe, and they put Diana under a mattress, leaving a small opening so the \nchild could breathe. Tayara said that when the bandits left she would let us \nout, and when they came back she would hide us again.\n\nWe sat in the wardrobe for about a half hour. Gaya became ill, and I allowed \nher to get out. My legs fell asleep and felt like cannons. We hadn't eaten or \ndrunk anything for so long, since the 27th, when we saw that horror--and all \nof it just snapped in me. Tayara's husband went outside, even though I begged \nhim to stay, saying there should be a man in the house. He said that he'd be \nin the courtyard, and if anything happened his wife would signal him. She put \nher passport and all of their documents on the table so if they suddenly came \nin she could show them that they were an Azerbaijani family. My girls went to \nthe window--and what was going on out there! I feared for my children, that \nsomeone would recognize them from the street. Gaya let her hair down and put \non a scarf so she would resemble an Azerbaijani, but directly across there was\na 9-story building, their windows were right across from us, and I shouted \nthat someone would see her and give us away on the spot. But she kept on \nlooking.\n\n-Diana: I watched too.\n\n-Zinaida: Downstairs the bandits were fighting with the soldiers. The soldiers\ndidn't shoot, they didn't have orders to. I saw them throwing rocks at\nthe soldiers, they were young boys, 18- and 19-year olds, and they defended\nthemselves . . . I'm a mother after all, and they were no different from my\nchildren. When one of the soldiers fell and his head started bleeding I had to\nstop looking, l couldn't watch anymore . . . I imagined my children in their\nshoes . . .\n\n-Gayane: The troops had assumed their defense that morning and had cordoned \noff the buildings, and some of the soldiers surrounded the bus station, Block \n36, and our Microdistrict 3. But they only cordoned them off from the outside.\nThe mob fell upon the soldiers, who started to protect themselves, and the mob\nsurged into the courtyard with the soldiers after it. They caught several \nAzerbaijanis and started beating them with their clubs. One fell down and they\ncracked open another's head . . .\n\n-Zinaida: They show Lebanon on television, and the war in Afghanistan--that's just\nwhat it was like. Like in America, how they attack demonstrations with shields\nand clubs--that's just how it was in our courtyard.\n\n-Gayane: Don't compare it with America, those were peaceful demonstrations, \nbut these?!\n\n-Zinaida: But how could it happen here and not off somewhere in America! They \nattacked the soldiers, hurled stones at them . . . Then I thought, where's the\ntear gas that the Americans use to disperse demonstrators? If they had used \ngas on those jackals they all would have scattered.\n\n-Gayane: They would not have scattered. The soldiers had been there since \nmorning, they didn't bring in fresh troops. They hadn't eaten, they were fine \nstanding there for about three hours, but then they got tired. They weren't \neven allowed to sit down . . . At noon they, the soldiers, attacked them, and \nthen the tables were turned. The mob went after the soldiers, the guys were \nbunched into a group in the center street and covered themselves with their \nshields, and the Azerbaijanis surrounded them and threw paving stones at them.\nAnd those guys sat there covering themselves with their shields. And meanwhile\ntanks with machine guns were cruising the streets . . . They always say, "Our \nchildren have never seen war." I never even dreamed about it, there was no \nneed to. But then I thought about those people who had lived through a war. It\nwas truly horrible . . . The guys were tired, exhausted, some had had their \nclubs taken away, others, their shields, they had been beaten, they were \ncovered in blood . . . so many died! They beat the soldiers with their own \nclubs and shields. And those guys stood there and couldn't defend themselves, \nthey couldn't open fire. They couldn't even defend themselves, let alone us. \nIt's comical . . .\n\n-Zinaida: What are you saying? How can it be funny?\n\n-Gayane: No, I didn't mean that: How could something like that happen during \nour Soviet period? It's painfully embarrassing! And they burned the armored \npersonnel carriers, too. Someone shouted, "Get away, it's going to blow!" \nEveryone scattered away, and the armored personnel carrier exploded. The \nsoldiers lost their senses. And when they drove the personnel carrier and the \nbus at the mob out of rage and fury, they drove right up on the sidewalk.\n\n-Zinaida: The bus that had brought the troops. Only the driver was in it. The \nbus ran over three people straight off, I saw it. And two armored personnel \ncarriers ran over four more. All in one or two minutes. The bus ran over \nthree, one of the carriers ran over two, and the second, two more. Right on \nour street there's a dry cleaners and appliance and watch repair places; one \nof the armored personnel carriers went that way, and they say it ran over\nseveral over there, too. But they ran over seven before our eyes. Then the bus\nploughed into a book kiosk.\n\n-Gayane: No, that was a flower place. It was a new booth. He drove straight \ninto it.\n\n-Zinaida: The driver jumped out and they dragged the vehicle out to the\nmiddle of the road and set it on fire.\n\n-Gayane: And I also saw the troops put a bunch of Azerbaijanis in a bus and \ntake them in a convoy to Baku. There were many arrests.\n\n-Zinaida: Our neighbor, the one who hid us, couldn't take it, and he told his \nwife that we should leave. They were running around in the courtyard looking \nfor the Armenians. They knew that they were hiding with Azerbaijanis, and they\nwere saying that they were going to check the Azerbaijani families. Poor \nTayara got scared too, and started to cry; I pleaded with her, I said that I \nwould remember forever how she saved my children and me, but where could we \ngo?\n\n-Gayane: She didn't make us leave, she said that she would do anything, but \nshe was afraid.\n\n-Zinaida: I told Tayara that we would just stay a little longer and that at\nnight we would return to our apartment. Then her husband came back and said \nthat a curfew had been imposed. He says, "Zina, you owe us a drink. Gorbachev \nannounced a curfew." And Bagirov [First Secretary of the Communist Party of \nAzerbaijan SSR] was on television, he said that two people had been killed in \nKarabagh, but nothing was wrong, automobile windows had been broken, but there\nhadn't been any killings. He kept making statements, and there were \nAzerbaijani songs and dances. Tayara turned the TV all the way up. When we \nlearned of the curfew we calmed down, but then a crowd ran into the courtyard \nagain, a large one. Our neighbor told them that there had been only one \nArmenian family here, but they had already killed them all, there was no one \nleft. We hid in the wardrobe again. and they stuck Diana back under the bed.\n\n-Gayane: Tayara went down to our apartment to see what was happened there, and\nfound two bandits. They asked her, "What are you doing here" Tayara answered, \n"I came to take something for myself." "Take all you want, they're gone now." \n\n-Zinaida: Yes, she had wanted to get something for us, at least some bedding. \nShe said, "What are you going to do, empty handed, naked, with three children,\nnothing remains of your entire apartment." In short, we calmed down, and the \ncrowd raced off to the other building, the one across from us. I don't know \nwhat went on there.\n\n-Gayane: The curfew had its effect on the gangs, many started to disperse:\nthey were warned that they would open fire on them. The soldiers didn't know \nthe city, they couldn't get oriented, they drove up and down the main streets,\nbut didn't go into the courtyards. When we were at the City Party Committee \nthey asked people from Sumgait to go with them and show them the way.\n\n-Zinaida: The tanks entered the city on the night of the 29th.\n\n-Gayane: No, Mamma, the tanks had been there earlier, but were near the City \nParty Committee, where the Armenians were . . . After midnight, on March 1, \nwhen I had finally gotten to sleep after two sleepless nights, Mamma said, \n"Get your things together, they have sent buses for us." As it was we had been\ndressed the entire time. Mamma went to check it out . . .and came back for us.\n\n-Zinaida: When I came back for the children Tayara said that Vika was alive \nand well, some guys had come and told her that they had hidden her in a safe \nplace. I both believed it and didn't believe it. We ran out to the tanks. The \nGambarians were there, Roman and Sasha; their father, Shurik, the clarinetist,\nwas killed, and their mother was there. Sasha came over and asked about the \ngirls. I was surprised, how did he know my girls? He said that he knew me and \nthe girls. Our neighbor himself went for Gaya and Diana and it seemed like he \nwas taking forever so I went after him. Another neighbor came out, Anna \nVasilyevna, a Russian: "Zinochka, my dear, goodbye and good luck." She kissed \nDiana. They put us in the bus and the captain gave the order for us to be \ntaken to the City Party Committee. The bus wouldn't start, so they put us on \nanother one. It was pouring rain.\n\n-Diana: When they imposed the curfew there were many soldiers on the streets, \nand they all had clubs and shields. And when the Azerbaijanis attacked them, \nmany of the soldiers died. They threw paving stones--huge rocks--at the \nsoldiers. I saw this myself. The soldiers ran over those Azerbaijanis with the\ntanks. The soldiers saw that the Azerbaijanis were doing violence to people \nand they ran over them out of rage. We got scared and they hid me under a \nmattress and a blanket, and Gaya and Mamma crawled into the wardrobe. And they\nwere fighting right down there on the street . . . Near the building they were\nblowing up buses and tanks, and cars were burning, and there were many dead in\nthe courtyard. They drove without looking to see if it was a sidewalk or a \nstreet, they just drove, and the ones who didn't manage to get out of the way \nwere run over by the tanks. And when we left--it was evening, it was already \ndark--there were three buses, and one of them had soldiers in it. Mamma ran up\nand said, "Get your clothes on, let's go." Gaya was wearing slippers, and I \nhad on my blue dress, but it was an old one. I was wearing my old jacket, my \nold dress, and slippers. And nothing else. Gaya had on a skirt, her Angora \nsweater, and slippers. It was raining hard, and there were puddles on the \nstreet. They gave Mamma an old coat because she was wearing a short-sleeved \ndress; she put it on and we ran out. We got onto the bus and I was hungry, one\nof the soldiers from Yerevan gave me rations and carried me from one bus to\nthe other in his arms. I gave him the little glass that remained from Vika's\ntrousseau, and he gave me his telephone number.\n\n-Gayane: In the bus there was a soldier with a shield sitting at every window.\nWe had to be ready for anything. They took us to the City Party Committee, let\nus out, and then took us into the City Party Committee building under armed \nguard. It was jammed with people and you couldn't breathe. We asked, "Are \nthese all us? Armenians?" They answered yes. We were surprised that there were\nso many Armenians in Sumgait. All those years we lived there and didn't know \nthere were so many Armenians, 18,000. We were struck by that, we had never \nnoticed. Going downstairs the next day I ran into the Secretary of the \nKomsomol from Vika's plant, the Khimprom. He said that Vika was alive and \nwell. When I told Mamma she of course calmed down some more. But you know, \nafter all that it was hard to believe anything, our faith in everything was \njust gone. She didn't believe it completely.\n\n-Zinaida: I didn't believe it because I had heard all kinds of things. When\nwe arrived at the City Party Committee we heard everything imaginable! It\nwas the fear of God. I saw many of our acquaintances, they were kissing each \nother and asking how their children and homes were. Many people already knew \nthat there had been a pogrom of our apartment. They had seen the broken \nwindows. I cried, saying that I didn't know where Vika was. One woman said \nthat they had taken two of her daughters and that she couldn't find one of \nthem; the other had been slashed all over. A second said that her husband and\nher son had been murdered. That was Nelli Aramian. She lived in Building 6 in \nour microdistrict. They killed her husband, Armo, and her son Artur. I heard \nso many things like that that I was already starting to lose touch; my \npatience had run dry waiting for my daughter. Later an Azerbaijani fellow came\nto me and said, Aunt Zina, Vika sent me, she's alive and well and hidden in a \nsafe place; if you want I'll call her there and you can speak with her. We \nwent downstairs to the first floor and he called Vika. I spoke with her, heard\nthe voice of my child. She had managed to survive in that hell. Then I started\nbegging that Azerbaijani to bring her to the City Party Committee. He tried to\ntalk me out of it: "I'll bring her wherever you go, don't worry, I've looked \nafter her better than a brother does a sister." All the same I asked him to \nget her. He brought her and I calmed down. On the second day there was a \nmeeting with Demichev [Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the\nCommunist Party of the USSR,] and people started shouting. One shouted, "Give \nme my son back!", another yelled, "Where is my daughter?!", a third wanted her\nhusband . . . Bagirov  was there too, and he stood there blinking, not saying \nanything.\n\n-Gayane: When Demichev asked where we wanted to go, everyone shouted, "To\nRussia!" To be honest we were all frightened of Armenia, there were such wild \nrumors it was as though we were in a terrible dream, and no one wanted to go \nto Armenia. But he said that he couldn't evacuate 18,000 people to Russia and \nthat he would meet with everyone individually the next day and speak with \nthem. And he also said that today he was going to go look at all of our \napartments. On March 3 we went to the military barracks in the village of \nNasosny. We were taken care of marvelously by the military. They sent special \nflights of children right from there to Minvody, Yerevan, and Moscow. One \nwoman left for Moscow with a letter for Gorbachev and Gromyko.\n\n-Zinaida: The worst was truly behind us by then. Everything had passed, but \nthe pain will remain for our whole lives. It cannot be forgotten. Under no \ncircumstances should we, our children, or our grandchildren forget. Who will\nanswer for those who died? For our mothers, sisters, brother, sons and\ndaughters? Who will bear the responsibility? Who will wash away their blood? \nSomeone should be made to answer, and severely, so it has an effect on the \npeople that did with us as they pleased . . . It isn't over yet, now we live \nhere, in Armenia, protected, but the issue isn't resolved. We would like\nto stay in Armenia, in our homeland, so that all the Armenian people will be\nunited. Then we will be invincible. Armenians won't be scattered throughout \nthe Soviet Union, about the world, and if we're all together this won't happen\nagain. As a mother of three children, as a woman, as a sister, I ask Armenians\nto be united so that what happened in Sumgait will never happen again. Our \nhomeland . . . The only request we have is that we be helped in obtaining an \napartment and getting jobs. So that our children can work for the good of \nArmenia. If we aren't able to, then let our children do it. And if it's \npossible, we'll work for the good of Armenia too. This is the land of our \nforefathers. Our grandfathers and great-grandfathers lived here too, it was \nonly later that people dispersed all over. Like a mother, the land here bore \nand reared us. It is our wife, and will protect us, too. I want but one thing:\nthat our people never see the hardship that our children saw, that your \nchildren here, in Armenia, never see anything like it.\n\n  May 28, 1988\n  Yerevan\n		     - - - reference - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

Please cite specific examples where an Arab party member was rejected\nwhile a Jewish party member was accepted.  If you examine these I am\nsure you will discover that the Arab party member did not have the power\nbase that his Jewish counterpart had.  The party structure in Israel\nhas changed quite a bit insofar as knesset member elections go.  Knesset\nmembers for most parties are now elected via primaries.  The top standing\nmembers end up with cabinet posts.  This is purely a political power\nissue.  Check the ranking of Arab labor party members, as opposed\nto Jewsih members and let me know which posts are held by Jews that\nranked lower in the party than their Arab fellow electees.\n\nOnce again, if for arguments sake, all the Arab Israelis were to vote\nfor Labor at the next election, you can rest assured that the number of\nArab MKs and cabinet members would increase proportionately to the\npower shift.\n\n\nYou are overlooking the fact that they wield political power\nas individuals based upon a wider collective power base.\n\n\nThe reasoning I see at work is purely political.  As far as security\ngoes I think that some serious gaffs were made by right wing Jews\nas well - e.g. Sharon.

Bill Coleman writes...\n \n(responding to a discussion about a mosque in Jerusalem allegedly \nhaving been destroyed by Israel)\n\nBC> In today's Jerusalem Post Magazine there is a feature story about the\nBC> ongoing restoration of synagogues in the Jewish Quarter.  The author,\nBC> Leah Abramowitz, writes that there were FIFTY-SEVEN synagogues in the\nBC> quarter in 1948, ALL of which were destroyed, some, she says, used as\nBC> donkey stables.  The building shells, that is.\nBC> \nBC> I still find it really, really hard to understand why the demolition\nBC> of the buildings in front of the Kotel continues to evoke more outrage\nBC> than this.  Everything is so much cheaper when it happens to the Jews.\nBC> \nBC> Why?\n \n    The double standard of human behavior regarding the Jews must\n    be manitained.\n\n    A perfect example is the outcry over the temporary removal of\n    400 men who advocated murdering Jews and destroying the State\n    of Israel, compared to the deafening silence over the abusive\n    treatment of Jews in Arab countries during the past 50 years.\n\n    Compare the tacit appoval that the world gives to Muslims who\n    randomly murder Jewish civilians to the righteous indignation\n    expressed if people in the occupied territories are kept from\n    working in Israel in an effort to reduce these random murders\n    from occuring, while everyone knows that no country is at all\n    required to accept foreign workers, except Israel, of course.\n\n    Jewish blood has always been cheap.  The non-Jewish world ha\n    never regarded any form of Jewish suffering important, except\n    when the Jews were the models of the powerless victim holding\n    the high moral ground, as it had been just after World War 2.  \n    However, as soon as the Jewish people started to take care of \n    themselves, the ancient hatred of Jews was unleashed again.  \n    \n    I doubt if the non-Jewish world is even capable of having any\n    compassion towards Jews as anti-semitism is so ancient and so\n    basic to both Christianity and Islam.  \n    \n    Golda Meir said that there would be peace when the Arabs love\n    their own children more than they hate the Jews.  And while I\n    know that there are more Arab parents who love their children \n    than those who would send their children out into the streets \n    to throw rocks at men trained to defend themselves with guns,\n    the world is so obsessed by a hatred of Jews trying to defend \n    themselves that they have yet to even question the actions of \n    those parents who not simply allow their children to do this, \n    but encourage them to throw themselves into harm's way.  Even \n    Arab children are expendable, if their tragic deaths are used \n    in the neverending propoganda battle to blame Israel, and the  \n    Jews, for any misfortune befalling Arabs in the middle east.
Here you give positive, accurate "facts" about what happened to the beduins\nand the land:\n\n   After the creation of the State of Israel, 80 percent of the Negev\n   Bedouin were expelled to the Sinai or to Southern Jordan. The\n   10,000 who were allowed to remain were confined to a territory of\n   40,000 hectares in a region were annual mean precipiation was 150\n   mm - a quantity low enough to ensure a crop failure two years out\n   of three. The rare water wells in the south and central Negev,\n   spring of life in the desert, were cemented to prevent Bedouin\n   shepherds from roaming.\n\n   A few Bedouin shepherds were allowed to stay in the central Negev.\n   But after 1982, when the Sinai was returned to Egypt, these\n   Bedouin were also eliminated. At the same time, strong pressure\n   was applied on the Bedouin to abandon cultivation of their fields\n   in order that the land could be transferred to the army.\n\nAnd now you say noone knows anything about what happened there:\n\n   No reliable statistics exist concerning the amount of land held\n   today by Negev Bedouin. It is a known fact that a large part of\n   the 40,000 hectares they cultivated in the 1950s has been seized\n   by the Israeli authorities. Indeed, most of the Bedouin are now\n   confined to seven "development towns", or *sowetos*, established\n   for them.\n\n   (the rest of the article is available from Elias Davidsson, email:\n   elias@ismennt.is)\n\nSo what you basically say is that "we know for sure that nothing good happens\nthere now,  we know for sure that the beduins prospered before the Jews arrived\nand that they were driven away by the Jews,  noone on earth knows about\nwhat the Jews did there."\n\nIs that what you said?  Could you proove any of the nonsense you wrote?\n\nBTW,  try asking beduins in Sinai how they mis the Israelis.  Not to mention\nthat there are enough valotaring beduins in the IDF to have at least one full\nbrigade of them.
In the abstract, what you're saying is true.  But the facts happen to\nagree with me, and disagree completely with you.  \n\n\nListen, Pinkas.  I'm going to count on the supposition that you think\nthrough the opinions you have - something which is, by the way, against\nmy better judgment based on what I've seen from you to date.  We are\nagreed, aren't we, that dictionaries are *reference books* for the usage\nof a given language, and in particular for the meanings of the words and\nphrases which comprise that language?  Now, you are using meanings\ncompletely different from, indeed in some cases diametrically different\nfrom, those given in the dictionary.  As a reference book, a dictionary\ncontains those meanings in both past and (as much as it can) in current\nuse.  That's also why they are updated so often.  Now, if you are saying\nthings which you give different meanings than the dictionary does, and\nusing non-standard meanings about every word, what is your chance of\nbeing taken at face value...?\n\nJust about none.  Just about no one will take you that way because the\nwords mean something different to them.  It's quite clear to me from\nthe response this thread has been getting that that is exactly what is\nhappening.  Ponder that.\n\n\n\nWhat you did was ask a leading question.  In English idiom, the phrase\n"and guess why..." in the way you used it is a loaded question, with\nonly one answer expected.  \n\nI also take offense at being told I cannot read by someone who is\nobviously having trouble with the subject himself.  Mr. Pinkas, I am a\nPhD candidate in my field.  One does not get to PhD candidacy if one\ncannot read.  \n\n\nBalderdash.  You know this is false.  I would be able to make the\nabstraction if it bore any resemblance to the facts of the matter.\nYours did not.  The analogy is utterly inapplicable.\n\nI wouldn't be in the field I'm in -- astrophysics -- if I couldn't make\nabstractions and speculate about the general grand scheme of things.  I\nalso wouldn't be in education -- which I am (and my students give me\nrather good reviews I'd add) -- if I couldn't draw such analogies.\n\n\nThe vast majority of Palestinians in Israeli prisons aren't tortured,\nand their houses weren't blown up by the army.  In fact, you've seen me\nprotesting such measures ON THIS NET before.  Are you now trying to\nintimate my agreement with them?\n\n\nDo you know the meanings of the words you use or do you expect the\nreader to read your mind?  I can read just fine thank you.  And I don't\nneed someone who is obviously having some troubles with a tongue which\nisn't his native one telling me how to read the words in my own native\ntongue.  If it were Spanish, I'd ask you.  \n\n\nYes, they are.  As you well know.\n\n\nBalderdash.  See above.  Once again, you have a lot of gall and\nabsolutely no right to lecture a native speaker of a language, who is\nwell educated in it, in a language which isn't your own native tongue\nand with which you're obviously having problems.\n\n\nSocial life is one thing, legal status is another.  Once again, this is\na leading question.\n\n\nFinal question:  Is it possible to be both Jewish and Muslim?  Jewish\nand Christian?  Your response will be enlightening.
If that "culture" referred to is Israeli, being anti-zionist can be seen\nas a complete denial of that entity's right to exist and its "legitimacy". \nJust as saying that Islam has *no right* to establish and implement a \n"state" that includes any non-muslims, both are *absolute*, one-dimensional \nviews of that culture with regard to the issue of "state".\n\n\nIf that were the case, one would expect a few of that culture's positives\nto be discussed with regard to the issue at hand. Since the issue *centers*\non Israeli culture, I have yet to hear of *any* positives of that culture\nin this discussion.\n\n\nI agree with you. But I also feel that when a culture feels it is confronted \nby another group that wishes to see that culture "disassembled", the first\nculture has little choice but to *try* to secure its "survival" as well as\nmaintain its moral center. Since the culture is not about to turn away\nfrom *either* the matter of its survival or the valuing of its moral \nprinciples, it has the virtually impossible job of "balancing". \n\nTo discuss Israel's faults and "crimes" without *any* recognition of this\ncircumstance and *reality* it faces is a conscious decision based on the \ndiscussant's political biases, NOT on an honest and empathetically open \nunderstanding of the situation. The same applies to those who attempt to \npaint the Palestinian movement as "all bad" and dispense with considerations \nof the *reality* facing them.\n\nYou beg the question by centering on the symptoms while the issue\nof "self-hating" addresses the motivations. I certainly feel that\nanyone who expends so much effort inflating, distorting and robbing\nhuman context from aspects of his/her own culture is reflecting\na degree of dislike for it. Since bits of that culture are bound, \ndue to his/her upbringing, to be a part of him/her, a bit of self-\ndislike seems likely to be mixed in somewhere.\n\nAs you well know, this process of *blaming the other* for the morally\nquestionable actions one side is forced (by the "other", of course) to \ntake is thoroughly practiced by **both sides**. If you are only hearing\nthe pro-Israeli crowd's self-supporting arguments, that may be due to\nthe fact that you are not listening for anything else. *I* certainly\nhear the similarly distorting pro-Palestinian/pro-Arab element in\n*this* newsgroup (as well as in soc.culture.arabic).\n\n\nI agree, agree, agree, agree.\n\nHowever, in my response to the initial discussion above between Davidsson\nand those opposing his presentations, I saw Davidsson carefully putting \nacademic frills around a blatantly one-sided series of I-hate/dislike-\n"them", yesIdo,yesIdo,yesIdo. I did *not* find the approach of those \nopposing Davidsson to be centered *at all* on a denigration and denial\nof the "other side". \n\nI certainly do wonder if the degree to which Davidsson's views on the \nMiddle East have distorted is connected to his dislike and rejection\nof his jewish lineage. Having said this, however, I agree with you that \nthis constant accusing others of being "self-hating" jews seems\npointless. It is not worse a label than is "why, you're on their side",\nexcept to perhaps imply a certain degree of overly enthusiastic \nbiasedness.\n\nTim
Gulf has changed the third parts's perception of Arabs.\n1. Before, people tended to think Arabs have tough character. After seeing\nIraqis begging for surrender, people do not gave Arabs much weight.\n2. People tended to think Arabs are a united people in fighting Isrealis.\nAfter Gulf War, seeing some Arab nations beated up Iraqis in order to\nwaiver the debt to U.S. and Kuwaitis consistly trying to draw West nations\nto hit Iraq again, people started to see Arab World as a dog cage, echoing\nsound of barking.
All right! Let's hope they get off their rear ends and do something\nbecause the UN clearly is content to sit on its.
[TC] Do you, as I do, agree that this (sort) of "peace process" is needed?\n[TC] What about the particular points mentioned in the article? Is what\n[TC] Israel is (supposedly) going to propose "good"? Does it go too far?\n[TC] Not far enough?\n\n[TC] If you don't agree that a "peace process" is needed, what is?\n\nI personally think that a peace process is needed, since only through\nnegotiations will the future generations be able to live in stability.\nUnfortunately not all think like this, we have cases like:\n	Anas Omran, Hamza Saleh, Jle, Mohammed Reza, Mehmed Abu-Abed, \nAnwar Mohammed and others who think that JIHAD is the only solution. \n\nI wish that people (including myself) would have more objective views like Tim,\nBasil and Shai for example and put the rhetoric aside and start discussing\n"substance".\n\nMy view is that Israel has made more gestures towards its Arab foes than the\nopposite. What have the Sysrians given to us or proposed? What have the\nPalestinians proposed? If the Palestinians would just revoke or rewrite their \ncharter, or just condemn acts of Palestinian violence that would be a good\nstart.\nThe Palestinians have all to gain from these negotiations. Its seems though\nthat they are not strong enough to make decisions on their own and are\nplagued by internal strife, that is why we are not getting anywhere.\nFundamentalism is slowly taking over in the territories, then it will be\ntoo late to discuss issues with the Palestinians since they will only\nvow for the destruction of Israel.\nArabs  must take example on Egypt. Egypt came to the bargaining table,\ngot what it wanted from Israel and there is now peace and cooperation\nbetween the two countries. \nThe tougher you play ball with Israel the tougher Israel gets.\n\nTsiel\n\n\nTsiel
I would change one of the many parts that define my cultural identity.\nIf I loose a leg, it might change my personality, but I do not\nstop being a human being. \nEven more, when someone gets a baboon heart, that person is still\nhuman.\n\n\nNot really. That is what differenciates agnostics from atheists.\nAs an atheist, I do not believe there is a god, nor do I believe that\nthere ever was one.\nSo, those commandments have no meaning to me. Also, there are a lot\nof ideas that have no meaning to me: The idea of a chosen people,\nthe idea of a given right to the land of Israel, the idea of keeping\nkosher, the idea of opposing intermarriage, the idea of having a \nTorah that was inspired by god, etc. \nBy being an atheist, I cannot support the idea of the Jewish Nation\nas defined by a religious principle or based on a religious identity.\nFor me, religion is just another piece in what constitutes the cultural\nidentity of the Jewish people. I believe that as a people with a \ncultural identity they constitute a Nation and have the same right as\nany other people in the world to have their own State. The same right\nas the Armenians have, as the Palestinians have, as the French have,\nand as anybody else have.\nI cannot say that by accepting a different god someone has lost all \ncultural identification.
Thank you very much for clarifying your position and source.  Apologies \nare accepted in good faith.  This absolutely was no attempt to bring you to\nyour knees, It is merely a suggestion to really check and re-sheck your\nsources before throwing a flame into the net.\n\nThanx again
All Muslims knew that the whole thing was set up to destroy Iraq, not\nto "Liberate Kuwait", The people who were killed by the invasion are\nmore (many many more), than the ones that were killed by the Iraqis\nin their smaller invasion. I lived in the west, and I have seen how \nyour media prepared you (helpless naive Americans) for a war against\nIraq even before the artificial conflict between Iraq and Kuwait that\nled to the invasion, as the CIA correctly predicted (and pretended to\nbe surprised not to know).\nIt just happened that Saddam was so predictible and so arrogant and stupid.\n\nWhat would I have done: Most Muslims would choose 300 dead Kuwaitis over\n200,000 dead Iraqis and 1000 dead Kuwaitis. The first case would happen\nif no western intervention happened, and the second case was a direct\nor indirect result of western envolvement.\n\nHuman rights in Kuwait? what about human rights in Iraq? why the west\ngave Saddam a green light to slaughter his own people? I will give my\nreason: because the rich Kuwaitis do not mind to be your salves, so\nthey deserve some democracy, but Iraqis might not, so they don't.\n\nAs simple as that, whether or not you want to admit it.\n\n\nNot necessarily the best solution, my view of an Islamic state (and\nthat of Turabi that your media made you hate) includes all the benefits\nof a secular state minus the injustices. Did you ever read a book by\nRashid Al-Ghannoushi (Tunisia), Hassan Turabi (Sudan)? You only know\nabout them from your Self-censured, self-controlled media.\n\nIf they make this kind of campaign against such a moderate thinker as\nTurabi is, and keep quite about such an extremist Muslim scholar as Bin\nBez of Saudi Arabia is, it just does not encourage any moderation in\nour ARab world.\n\n\nNo it was not that, it was just some irrelevent stuff that I took out\nto go around the copyright (;-))\n\nI ceased to take the Newyork times seriously. In issues concerning Islam\nit has become one of the biggest enemies (although less than the other\nNewYork daily since Mortimer took it over). It lies, selects facts that\nfits its agenda and even prints racist and open anti-Muslim editorials.\n\nWhat they claimed in that articles is a bunch of lies because while \nthe selected facts are true about some of those persons, the other members\nare actually defence lawyers and University science professors who wanted\nto fight corruption, uncover atrocities against opposition activists and\nShia minority, and generally increase awareness about the rights of all \ncitizens. The only thing that is common between those people is their concern\nfor the deterioration of human rights since the Saudi clan took a green\nlight from AMerica (after the gulf) to do whatever is necessary to stay\nin power. \n\n\nDo you know that ALL OF THE SAUDI ULEMA have been taught the same things?\nthe ones in the official Iftaa are as conservative as the ones that are\nopposing it. SOme of the members of the human rights committe are MORE\nPRO-WOMEN and wanted to defend them, and that is precisely one reason that\nBin Bez's Fatwah  implied for the "Illegality " of this committee\nand  for his claim that it represents "Outside interests"\n\nThere is a human rights issue in Saudi ARabia, and YOU and NY times chose\nto ignore the main issue and select some of the members of that committee\nand actually defend the actions done against them (including banning them\nfrom their Jobs.\n\nWhat a hypocricy. I am not surprised really, THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME.\n\nThe official Ulema are the most extremist anti-women meat-heads in Saudi\nArabia, the west continues on its campaign to discredit itself in the\nMuslim community, by supporting them. Well after Bosnia, I guess it has\nZERO credibility to begin with, so what the heck.
[anti-Israel rantings deleted]\n\nAs my father says in Russian, "pol yevreya, poltara anitsemita" or roughly\ntranslated "half a Jew is an anti-semite and a half."  Now, Mr. Davidsson, \nI know what he means.
Muslims already have, they accepted the Vance Owen plan that gives\n50% of the population (Serbian statistics put it at 44%) only 25%\nof the territory. They gave some totally Muslim villages and areas\nto Croatia and Serbia, they in effect gave the Serbs the land they grabbed \nwhile slaughtering the Muslims anbd raping their women and expelling\nthe survivors.\n\nStill the Serbs (NOT BOSNIAN SERBS because the real Bosnian Serbs are\nfighting with Muslims to defend Bosnia from Serbs, those so called \nBosnian Serbs refused to be part of Bosnia and wanted a greater Serbia),\nstill those Serbs refused, they have the necessary weapons to kill\nmore Muslims and grab more territory.
Look nobody asked those countries about their UN forces\nto be on the ground.  They can take their forces which are\nincomponent and ineffective at the first place.  And let whoever are\nwilling to do the job what it takes.  How anyone can defend this\nstinking UN force on the ground who let the Bosnnian PM\nyanked out from the UN vehicle and being shot by the Serbian\nmilitary?  How anyone can defend this UN force who are just watching\nthe shelling on cities and towns everyday?  How anyone can\ndefend and say those stinking UN forces being effective\nwhen Bosnian had almost 14,000 children casualties between 5-14 age \ngroups?  I think talking about the current UN forces to Bosnian\nmuslims is just an insult to their casualties.   \n\nI think Senator Biden said it all what has to be said on this issue.\nEurope is a sad place to criticize human rights in anywhere in this \nworld.  Like Biden said, they are the bigots when it comes to \ncultural difference and minorty closer to their home.\nBecause they get rid of their minorities long long time\nago starting in 15th centuries.  And they let Adolph\nto take care of the rest in 20th Century.  But he was much more \nnaughty than they expected because he dared to step many \ntoes.  So, why spoil the good thing now when Serbs doing today what \nthey were thinking the same yesterday.

[SB] Oh yeah, Israel was really ready to "expand its borders" on the holiest day\n[SB] of the year (Yom Kippur) when the Arabs attacked in 1973.  Oh wait, you\n[SB] chose to omit that war...perhaps because it 100% supports the exact \n[SB] OPPOSITE to the point you are trying to make?  I don't think that it's\n[SB] because it was the war that hit Israel the hardest.  Also, in 1967 it was\n[SB] Egypt, not Israel who kicked out the UN force.  In 1948 it was the Arabs\n[SB] who refused to accept the existance of Israel BASED ON THE BORDERS SET\n[SB] BY THE UNITED NATIONS.  In 1956, Egypt closed off the Red Sea to Israeli\n[SB] shipping, a clear antagonistic act.  And in 1982 the attack was a response\n[SB] to years of constant shelling by terrorist organizations from the Golan\n							     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n[SB] Heights. Children were being murdered all the time by terrorists and Israel\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\n[SB] finally retaliated.  Nowhere do I see a war that Israel started so that \n[SB] the borders could be expanded.\n\nI agree with all you write except that Terrorist orgs. were not shelling\nIsrael from the Golan Heights in 1982, but rather from Lebanon. The Golan\nHeights have been held by Israel since 1967, and therefore the PLO could\nnot have been shelling Israel from there, unless there is something I am\nnot aware of.\n\n\nTsiel
I guess that it was not acceptable because Germany *also* chose\na path of aggression simultaneously that put the interests of\nother countries in peril.

I cite an essay by\nCharles Krauthammer in the Time (this week) that discusses\nthis issue eloquently.\n\nFor example, did US and other European countries abandon their\nmoral compunctions when they chose not to send military troops\nto Bombay when Hindus, in a rare fit of impassioned rage, killed\nmany Muslims recently.

This can be turned around.  The Austrians who should feel guilty about\n their actions during WWII, but don't, justify their anti-semetism by making\n every Israeli action into an atrocity.

Parts of Sen. Biden's statement were quoted by the Washington Post today:\n\n   Let me put it plainly, Mr. Secretary.  You are required to speak\n   diplomatically; I am not.  I cannot even begin to express to you\n   my contempt for a European policy that is now asking us to \n   participate in what amounts to a codification of the Serbian victory.\n   ...\n   What you have encountered is a discouraging mosaic of indifference,\n   timidity, self-delusion and hypocrisy.\n   ...\n   After they held our coats on Kuwait and Somalia, they are asking us\n   to put in a few thousand troops on the ground in order to have the\n   right to speak and in order to implement their new idea of 'safe\n   havens' for the Bosnians...\n   Let's not mince words.  European policy is based on cultural and\n   religious indifference, if not bigotry.  And I think it's fair to say\n   that this would be an entirely different situation if the Muslims\n   were doing what the Serbs have done, if this was Muslim aggression\n   instead of Serbian aggression.\n\nToo bad the Washington Post did not include his next sentence, which \npointed out that a consequence of such policy is a rising anger\nwithin the Islamic world, the consequences of which we cannot begin\nto predict.  Later, Biden told a reporter why he spoke out:\n\n   I think someone has to respond to Europe to make it clear\n   this is a big deal... so they will understand.\n\nand it IS a big deal.  By refusing the fundamental human right of\nself-defense to Bosnia-Herzegovina, Europe and the world have \naided the Serbian aggression.  Moreover, the arms embargo has\nforced a situation in which Bosnian Serbs have 10 times more heavy\nweaponry than Bosnian Croats and Muslims combined.  Under such\nconditions, it is very easy for Serbs to play a "divide-and-conquer"\ngame, and to get the Muslims and Croats (who have strong common\ninterests and who were allied against the Serbian aggression) \nto start fighting each other, which leads to their mutual catastrophe.\n\nOne final quote:  U.S. Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, has\nsaid in Rome last week that "In practice, the embargo had the opposite\neffect intended.  It made aggression certain."\n\nAll diplomats who deluded themselves that they could negotiate peace\nwhile enforcing a 10:1 imbalance of power on the ground have contributed\nto this tragedy.
Josip,\n\nplease, don't be offended at this question: Who are the "Muslims" in the\nBosnian context? i know that a moslem/muslim is a believer in Islam. Islam \nis a religion and it is practised in many parts of the world. But it is not\n, yes definitely not, an ethinic group. ok! so, these Bosnian Muslims, who\nare they? to which ethnic group do they belong? what language(s) do they\nspeak? do they have a different language from that of the Serbs or Croats? \nthe way the western press use the word 'muslim' in this Bosnian debacle has \nkept me wondering when the meaning of muslim/moslem i knew from childhood was \nchanged in the dictionary. this is just a question. no flames intended!

THE ENEMY WITHIN\n                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n                        By Robert I. Friedman\n         The Village Voice, May 11, 1993, Vol. XXXVIII No. 19\n\n        | How The  Anti-Defamation League  Turned the Notion |\n        | of Human Rights on Its Head, Spying  on  Progress- |\n        | ives and  Funneling Information to Law Enforcement |\n\n\nRoy Bullock wanted to be a spy since he was a teenager in Indiana and\nread "I Led Three Lives," Herbert Philbrick's Cold War saga of\npenetrating the Communist Party for the FBI.  Philbrick had become an\nAmerican folk hero in the 1950s for building dossiers on unsuspecting\ncolleagues.  It was a time when Hollywood produced more than 30 films\nportraying the informer as the quintessential American patriot.  In\nBoston, where Philbrick led three lives as an FBI informant, Communist\nParty member, and private citizen, the mayor even proclaimed a Herbert\nPhilbrick Day and presented the spy with a plaque.\n\nFor Bullock, a shy young man who was coming to terms with his\nhomosexuality in the straight-arrow '50s, the life of a double agent\nwas the perfect way to hide his lifestyle while fighting the Communist\nmenace.\n\n"I was fascinated with Herbert Philbrick," Bullock recently told\nfederal investigators, "and so I thought I would try to infiltrate the\nCommunist Part.  In 1957, I went to the Sixth World Youth and Student\nFestival in Moscow with the American delegation.  I gave them [the FBI\na full report on it when I returned, along with some photos I took of\nsome Soviet military vehicles."\n\nBullock was hooked.  For the next two years, he worked as an unpaid\ninformant for the FBI.  But he found his true calling when he became a\npaid spy for the Anti-Defamation League in 1960.  Now his activities\nare at the center of the biggest domestic spy scandal in recent\nAmerican history -- a scandal that may end with the ADL's criminal\nindictment in San Francisco.\n\nOver a 30-year period, he compiled computer files for the ADL on 9876\nindividuals and more than 950 groups of all political stripes,\nincluding the NAACP, the Rainbow Coalition, ACLU, the American Indian\nMovement, the Center for Investigative Reporting, Pacifica, ACT UP,\nPalestinian and Arab groups, Sandinista solidarity groups, Americans\nfor Peace Now, and anti-apartheid organizations.  Bullock, who even\nspied on the recently slain South African nationalist Chris Hani when\nhe visited the Bay Area in April 1991, sold many of his ADL files on\nanti-apartheid activists to South African intelligence.  Meanwhile,\nbetween 1985 and 1993, the ADL paid him nearly $170,000, using a\nprominent Beverly Hills attorney as a conduit in order to conceal its\nfinancial relationship with Bullock.\n\nLast month, police raided ADL offices in Los Angeles and San\nFrancisco, as well as Bullock's home, confiscating computer files and\nboxes of documents.  According to court records, Bullock's files\ncontained the driver's license and vehicle registration information,\nin addition to criminal histories on individuals -- much of which was\nallegedly stolen from the FBI and police computers.  Bullock, 58, told\nthe FBI that copies of virtually everything in his computer data base\nhad been given to the San Francisco ADL office.  "Based on the\nevidence," says Inspector Ron Roth, in a police affidavit, "I believe\nthat Roy Bullock and ADL had numerous peace officers supplying them\nwith confidential criminal and DMV information."\n\nWhat's more, the San Francisco D.A. is investigating Bullock for\ntapping phones, accessing answering machines, and assuming false\nidentities to infiltrate organizations.  Documents seized from\nBullock's home also contained evidence of his forays into Bay Area\ntrash cans: He had the names and phone numbers of employees at the\nChristic Institute in San Francisco, as well as telephone message\nslips to staff members (including names and phone numbers of callers),\noffice correspondence listing the names and return addresses of the\nsenders, and inter-office memos.  He also had receipts from Christic\nInstitute's bank accounts at Wells Fargo and Eureka Federal Savings,\nas well as itemized canceled checks with the names of the payees, the\ndates, and amounts.  Bullock even knew the balance in the Christic\nInstitute's checking account.\n\nInvestigations by the FBI and police in San Francisco have revealed\nthat the ADL has shared at least some of its spy gathering material\nwith Israeli government officials.  What's more, Israel apparently used\ntips from the ADL to detain Palestinian Americans who travelled there.\n\n                            *     *     *\n\nThe ADL was established in New York City in 1913 to defend Jews, and\nlater other minority groups, from discrimination.  It led the fight\nagainst racist and fascist groups like the Ku Klux Klan and the\nAmerican Nazi Party, and in the 1960s championed the civil rights\nmovement.\n\nBut there was also a darker side.  In the late 1940s, the ADL spied on\nleftists and Communists, and shared investigative files with the House\nCommittee on Un-American Activities and the FBI.  The ADL swung\nsharply to the right during the Reagan administration, becoming a\nbastion of neoconservatism.  To Irwin Suall, a repentant Trotskyite\nwho heads the ADL's powerful Fact Finding Department, the real danger\nto Jews is posed not by the right -- but by a coalition of leftists,\nblacks, and Arabs, who in his view threaten the fabric of democracy in\nAmerica, as well as the state of Israel.  In the tradition of his\nideological soulmate William Casey, Suall directed the ADL's vast\nnetwork of informants, who were given code names like "Scumbag,"\n"Ironside," and -- for a spy reportedly posing as a priest in Atlanta\n-- "Flipper."\n\nFor years, journalists and liberal members of the Jewish community\nknew the ADL spied on right-wing hate groups.  As long as the targets\nwere anti-Semitic organizations like the Liberty Lobby and Lyndon\nLarouche, no one seemed to be particularly troubled.  But the Bullock\ncase reveals that the ADL also spied on groups that have a nonviolent,\nand progressive orientation.  This apparent massive violation of civil\nliberties may end with the ADL's criminal indictment in San Francisco,\nwhere the investigation began.  The human rights group faces possible\ncriminal prosecution on as many as 48 felony counts, including an\nindictment for gaining illegal access to police computers.  Says one\nsource close to the West Coast investigation, "It is 99 per cent\ncertain that the ADL will be indicted."\n\nIn the wake of the San Francisco investigation, police probes of ADL\nspying are spreading to other parts of the country.  "We have received\nnumerous complaints about ADL [spying]," says Sam Adams, a\nspokesperson for the mayor's office in Portland, Oregon.\n\nOn April 16, the Harlem-based Black United Fund of New York, and\nAfrican American self-help group that Bullock allegedly spied on,\nwrote District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, requesting "an immediate\ninvestigation" of the ADL.  "The ADL's actions cause great concern, as\nit is a direct and flagrant violation -- at minimum -- of our civil\nrights....We call upon you to join with the District Attorney of San\nFrancisco to...bring and end to this latest form of McCarthyism."\n\nGerald McKelvey, a spokesperson for Morgenthau's office, says, "We\nhave no evidence before us that warrants any sort of investigation."\nMcKelvey adds that Morgenthau offered to assist the FBI and the San\nFrancisco D.A.'s office on their pending investigation.  "They have\nnot, so far, asked for our assistance."\n\nThe ADL acknowledges sharing information on violence-prone groups with\nlaw enforcement officials.  It also admits to maintaining extensive\nfiles on a wide variety of organizations, but says, in a two-page\npress release, "The vast majority of ADL's files are composed of news\nclips, magazine articles, books, journals, and other documents...."\n\n"ADL has made it clear that it does not and will not countenance\nviolations of the law on the part of anyone connected with the agency,\nand the process by which the League gathers information is presently\nunder review to insure that no laws are being violated."\n\nThat's what the ADL says for public consumption.  But morale is so low\nthat its employees complain of sleepless nights and crying fits.  And\neven as other Jewish groups circle the wagons around the ADL in a show\nof solidarity, many do so holding their noses.  More than a few Jewish\nofficials privately say the ADL has to decide whether it is a human\nrights group or a secret police agency.\n\n"The ADL is regarded both inside the Jewish community and outside the\nJewish community as the definitive source of information on anti-\nSemitism and extremist groups," says Daniel Levitas, the former\nexecutive director of the Center for Democratic Renewal, an Atlanta-\nbased group that monitors anti-Semitism, racism, and hate groups.\n"One of the things this scandal has done is that it has completely\ntainted the ADL's credibility and reputation with regard to its\nobjectivity.  This scandal is going to be a devastating blow to the\nJewish community at large because people regard the ADL as synonymous\nwith American Jewry."\n\n                            *     *     *\n\nBullock's talents as a snoop and his extreme conservatism meshed well\nwith the ADL's Cold War worldview.  In 1960, he moved to Southern\nCalifornia where he became an ADL spy for $75.00 a week.  Bullock\nalmost always used his real name when snooping, although he once\ncalled himself Elmer Fink when corresponding with supporters of\nAlabama governor George Wallace.  Bullock provided the ADL's office in\nLos Angeles with written reports, which were transmitted to Fact\nFinding Department head Irwin Suall, according to court records.\nUnder Suall's stewardship, Fact Finding Department had become the\nADL's heart and soul.  Located at ADL national headquarters across\nfrom the United Nations, the department had assembled a vast library\non "hate groups," culling material from publications, speeches, and\ninformants reports.\n\nBullock was more than adept at leading a double life.  Not long after\nmoving to California, he ingratiated himself with a woman in the John\nBirch Society who helped him gain access to the group's Boston office.\nThere, he found a file the right-wingers were keeping on the ADL.  The\ndiscovery gave rise to speculation in the ADL New York office that\nthey had somehow been penetrated by the Birchers.\n\nBullock focused almost exclusively on right-wing extremist groups\nuntil the early 1970s when ADL L.A. head Milton Sinn was replaced by\nHarvey Schechter, who encouraged him to target the left as well.  A\nfew years later, Bullock moved to the Castro District in San Francisco\nwhere he posed as an art dealer.  And ADL fact finder who had\ninfiltrated the local Arab community had just been exposed.  When the\nensuing scandal died down, Bullock was ordered by the ADL to penetrate\nthe Arabs.\n\nThe ADL was especially concerned about the American-Arab Anti-\nDiscrimination Committee, founded by the former South Dakota senator\nJames Abourezk to combat Arab-bashing.  In a page out of the CIA's\ndirty tricks handbook on penetration and destabilization, Bullock\njoined the ADC, and then recruited Nazis into the group, apparently\ntrying to discredit it, according to published reports.\n\nIn 1987, the ADL sent Bullock to attend the National Association of\nArab Americans annual congress in Washington.  According to court\ndocuments, Bullock was told to find the source of the group's funds.\nBullock was unable to "follow the money."  But he did such a good job\nat ingratiating himself that he was appointed to head a NAAA\ndelegation that visited Congress member Nancy Pelosi.\n\nIt's not surprising that the ADL penetrated Arab organizations.  But\nonly acute paranoia explains their interest in groups like ACT UP.  As\nfar as Bullock was concerned, gay groups in San Francisco were heavily\ninfiltrated by what he called "gay left revolutionaries," prompting\nhim to write about their activities for the ADL.\n\nBullock soon expanded his horizons, moving into the shadowy realm of\nforeign espionage after Richard Hirschhaut, the head of ADL's San\nFrancisco office, introduced him to Thomas Gerard in 1986.  Gerard was\nthen a detective with the San Francisco Police Department's\nIntelligence Unit.  Gerard had worked as a demolitions expert for the\nCIA in El Salvador in the early 1980s, where he apparently had more\nthan a passing interest in right-wing death squads.  (Police searching\nGerard's briefcase found extensive CIA literature about torture and\ninterrogation, photos of blindfolded and chained men, as well as\npassports made out to Gerard in 10 different names, including Thomas\nClouseau.  From a remote jungle island redoubt in the Philippines\nwhere he fled last November, Gerard told the Los Angeles Times that he\nwill blow the lid off the CIA's involvement with Latin American death\nsquads if he is indicted in the ADL spy case.)\n\nAfter their very first encounter in the ADL office, Gerard and Bullock\nhad lunch at McDonald's, "I liked Tom right off," Bullock later told a\nSan Francisco police investigator whose report of the interrogation\nwas obtained by the _Voice_.  "Tom is a very charming, roguish\ncharacter, with a great deal of integrity.  Let me say here, I\nconsider Tom Gerard one of the finest policemen I've ever worked\nwith, absolutely.  Honest, capable, intelligent and 100 percent\nAmerican."\n\nBefore long, Bullock was providing Gerard with confidential ADL\nreports on various groups and individuals.  In turn, Gerard gave\nBullock classified police intelligence files on local Arab Americans,\nskinheads, and others.  Bullock told the FBI that Gerard's material\nended up in his ADL reports.  "I would say 99 percent of the data that\nI got was name, address, and sometimes physical description.  Criminal\nhistory, very rarely," Bullock told investigators.  Gerard also gave\nBullock a chart that outlined a vast network of Bay Area Arab American\nbusinessmen and organizations that allegedly has ties to Middle East\nterror groups, as well as surveillance photos of Arab Americans\nreceiving weapons training overseas.  Bullock claims that U.S. Customs\nin New York gave Gerard the photos.  "It was understood that Bullock\nwould be very careful with what he did with the information Gerard\ngave him, and that Bullock would not release it except to the ADL or\nother law enforcement officers," says an FBI report.\n\nThere was nothing unusual about Bullock's cozy relationship with law\nenforcement.  By the mid-1980s, the ADL was swapping files with\nhundreds of "official friends," the organization's euphemism for U.S.\nlaw enforcement and intelligence sources.  The ADL's relationship with\nthe FBI's counterterrorism office was so close that ADL's reports on\nArab American group's covert ties to Middle East terrorists were "must\nreading."\n\nIt's no accident that police found a 1986 classified FBI report\nentitled "Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP)--New\nYork Area" while searching the ADL's San Francisco office.  In 1987,\nADL spooks investigated seven Palestinians and a Kenyan studying in\nCalifornia universities on student visas.  When the ADL discovered\nthey were disseminating PFLP literature, it informed the FBI, which in\nturn took the case to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\nAfter the INS ordered the students deported as subversives, ADL\nregional director David Lehrer gloated in the _Los Angeles Times_\nabout his office's cooperation with law enforcement, although he's\nbackpedaling now.  The "Los Angeles 8" deportation is still under\nappeal.\n\n                            *     *     *\n\nWhile the ADL worked quietly with America's top cops, it enjoyed\nsimilar ties with Israel's spy agencies -- a charge that ADL leaders\nvehemently deny.  But as early as July 7, 1961, ADL director Benjamin\nEpstein wrote to B'nai B'rith executive secretary Saul Joftes,\nrequesting $25,000 for his investigators.  "Our information," he\nboasted to Joftes, "in addition to being essential for our own\noperations, has been of great value and service to both the United\nStates Department and the Israeli Government.  All data have been made\navailable to both countries with full knowledge to each that we are\nthe source."\n\nIn 1987, the ADL came under FBI scrutiny in the wake of the Pollard\nspy scandal.  While assigned to the Navy's Anti-Terrorist Alert\nCenter, where he had access to the most closely guarded U.S. secrets,\nJonathan Pollard stole thousands of pages of classified documents for\nIsrael, which, according to federal prosecutors, "could fill a room\nthe size of a large closet...ten feet by six feet by six feet."\nPollard's handler was Avi Sella, an Israeli air force colonel whose\nwife worked for the New York ADL as a lawyer.  Pollard later wrote to\nfriends that a prominent ADL leader was deeply involved in the Israeli\nspy operation.\n\nWhile there is no proof that anyone connected with the ADL was\ninvolved with Pollard, there is evidence that the ADL freely passes\ninformation to Israeli intelligence.  In March 1993, the FBI\ninterrogated David Gurvitz, an ADL fact finder in Los Angeles until\n1992 when he was fired by Suall for illegally obtaining police\ninformation to use against a rival at the Simon Wiesenthal Center.\nThe FBI pointedly asked Gurvitz if he had ever transmitted information\nto Israel.  Gurvitz admitted that in 1992 he had learned from a law\nenforcement contact that Michael Elias, allegedly a member of a\nradical PLO faction, was scheduled to travel from San Francisco\nInternational Airport en route to Haifa.  Gurvitz phoned the deputy\nIsraeli consul general in L.A. with the information.  "Later the same\nday," according to a 15-page FBI interview of Gurvitz obtained by the\n_Voice_, "Gurvitz was called back by another man, who said he was from\nthe Israeli Consulate, and who asked Gurvitz to repeat the information\nabout Elias.  Gurvitz did not get this man's name, but their\nconversation was in Hebrew so Gurvitz felt confident the man was\nactually an Israeli Consulate official."\n\nAmong the 12,000 names of private citizens that police found in ADL\nfiles in San Francisco was Mohammed Jarad, a 36-year-old Chicago\nresident who was arrested in Israel on January 25, for allegedly\ndistributing hundreds of thousands of dollars to Hamas, the large\nIslamic fundamentalist movement in the Occupied Territories.  The\nChicago ADL office runs at least three undercover informants who work\nwith "official friends" in local law enforcement, according to\ndocuments released by the San Francisco D.A. and sources close to the\nADL.  Given these facts, Arab American groups surmise that the ADL has\npassed information on Jarad to Israeli intelligence.\n\nOne technique used by the ADL to monitor the large Arab American\ncommunity in the Midwest was to scan the local Arab press for funeral\nnotices.  According to sources familiar with the practice, ADL\ninvestigators in unmarked vans videotaped the Palestinian funerals,\nwhich sometimes turned into PLO rallies.  Palestinians have been\ndetained at Ben-Gurion Airport simply on the basis of having been\nfilmed attending a funeral in Chicago, according to Suhail Miari, the\nexecutive director of the United Holy Land Fund, whose cousin was an\nArab member of Israel's Knesset.\n\nShortly after Jarad was arrested, the Israeli government announced\nthat Hamas was being run from America with money and operational\ninstructions relayed by courier or fax.  Israel's charges were played\nup on the front page of _The New York Times_.  According to well-\nplaced sources, Yehudit Barsky, an ADL fact finder in New York, worked\nclosely with Israeli officials on this campaign of vilification,\nintroducing "friendly" reporters to "official friends" in Chicago law\nenforcement.\n\nBarsky, who is fluent in Arabic, prepared an ADL report about how\nHamas is funded in America.  She identified the Dallas-based Islamic\nassociation for Palestine in North America as the front organization\nfor Hamas in the U.S.A.  "Its infrastructure functions as an\ninterlocking network of organizations, small businesses, and\nindividual activists," says the February 1993 ADL report, which\noutlines the organization's development, its activities on U.S.\ncollege campuses, and its "metamorphosis" during the Gulf War. It\nalso traces Hamas fundraising through a plethora of alleged front-\ngroups from Plainfield, Indiana, to Culver City, California.  It is\ndoubtful that Barsky could have compiled such sophisticated data\nwithout the help of "official friends" and ADL spies.\n\nBarsky refused to comment.  But she used to talk to Greg Slabodkin as\nmany as three times a week when he was an opposition researcher for\nAIPAC, whose spy operation was disclosed last summer in the _Voice_.\n"The level of cooperation was very close," Slabodkin said during a\nrecent phone conservation from Israel where he is in graduate school.\n"If we felt our files were lacking, we contacted the ADL."\n\nWhen Sha'wan Jabarin, a 30-year-old Palestinian human rights worker in\nthe Occupied Territories won a $25,000 Reebok Human Rights Award in\n1990, Slabodkin recalls that Barsky faxed AIPAC the man's entire\npolice file, which she had obtained from the Israeli embassy.  Jabarin\nhad been arrested numerous times in Israel, and once confessed to\nbeing a member of the PLO after having been severely tortured.\nJabarin, who received a short jail term, became an Amnesty\nInternational Prisoner of Conscience.  Of course, to AIPAC and the\nADL, Jabarin was a terrorist.  Slabodkin, who was ordered to keep tabs\non him when he was in the U.S. to receive his award, called a\nrepresentative of Al Haq, the Palestinian human rights group that\nemployed Jabarin, to obtain his itinerary.  AIPAC even opened a file\non musician Jackson Browne, who presented Jabarin with the Reebok\naward.\n\nWhile the ADL may be able to rationalize its close monitoring of\nArabs, and even left-wing gay revolutionaries, it has a far harder\ntime explaining its obsession with spying on anti-apartheid activists.\nDavid Gurvitz told the FBI that when he started working as a fact\nfinder for the ADL in L.A. in March 1989, ADL files already bulged\nwith information about the Israel-South African connection and anti-\napartheid groups.  "Gurvitz confirmed that the ADL did routinely\ncollect information on persons engaged in anti-apartheid activities in\nthe United States," says the FBI report.  While Gurvitz said there\nwere files in the L.A. ADL office dating to the 1930s, he estimated\nthe oldest material on anti-apartheid activities dates back to the\nlate 1970s, paralleling Begin's rise to power in Israel and a\ndeepening of ties between the Jewish state and South Africa. "In\nabout August, 1992," says the report of the FBI's March 3, 1993,\ninterview with Gurvitz, "an anti-apartheid demonstration was held at\nthe South African Consulate in Los Angeles.  Participating in the\ndemonstration were the Los Angeles Student Coalition and the Socialist\nWorkers Party.  Gurvitz went to two demonstration planning sessions,\nand a subsequent demonstration.  He wrote a report for the ADL on each\nof the planning sessions and on the demonstration.  Copies of the\nreports were disseminated to Bullock, among others, in care of the San\nFrancisco ADL office."\n\nIn 1986 Bullock learned that the consul general of the South African\nConsulate in Los Angeles would be speaking in Las Vegas at a meeting\norganized by Willis Carto, the head of the anti-Semitic Liberty Lobby.\n"Suspecting that the Consul General did not know who Willis Carto is,"\nsays the FBI report, "Bullock suggested to Gerard that they might want\nto warn the South Africans.  Gerard agreed and informed the Consul\nGeneral, who canceled his appearance."\n\nA few months later, Gerard phoned Bullock and told him a South African\nintelligence officer wanted to meet them.  During a rendezvous in a\nhotel near Fisherman's Wharf, the South African said he was interested\nin acquiring information on American anti-apartheid activists.  The\nSouth African, who called himself Mr. Humphries, also asked for\ninformation about groups that were advocating divestments.  "Gerard,\nwho was present throughout the meeting," says the FBI report, "told\nHumphries that he [Gerard] had been employed by the CIA....Humphries\noffered to pay Bullock $150.00 per month in exchange for information.\nBullock noted that much of the information Humphries said he wanted\nwas already in the possession of Bullock and the ADL."\n\nBetween 1987 and 1991, Bullock sold information to South African\nintelligence, receiving steady raises, which he split evenly with\nGerard.  "Bullock said it was his impression, though Gerard never\nexplicitly told him so, (and Bullock never asked) that Gerard may have\nbeen telling the CIA about his and Bullock's contacts with the South\nAfricans," says the FBI report.  "Gerard had said he knew the CIA\n'resident agent' in San Francisco....Once, after Gerard dropped\nBullock off at Bullock's residence following a meeting with Louie [who\nreplaced Humphries as their handler], Gerard said he was going to go\nto the San Francisco CIA office."\n\nAl the while, Gerard may have been "tasking" Bullock for the CIA.\n"Bullock recalled that once, after he had met Gerard, Bullock went to\nChicago, Illinois to conduct an investigation on behalf of the ADL,"\nsays the FBI report.  "The target of the investigation was a group\ncalled the Palestine Human Rights Campaign.  Bullock learned that a\nwoman [name deleted] was transporting money between the PLO or the\nPFLP, and the United States.  Bullock told this to Gerard.  Gerard\nlater told Bullock that Gerard's 'guy at the CIA' would like to know\nmore.  Gerard asked Bullock if Bullock would go back to Chicago to\ngather more information on the Palestine Human Rights Campaign.\nBullock, however, never did go back."\n\nGerard also seems to have had a close relationship with Mossad, which\nmay have started in 1991 when he went on an ADL junket to Israel.  The\nADL frequently sponsors trips for American law enforcement officials\nto Israel, where they are wined and dined and meet their counterparts\nin various intelligence agencies.  According to an affidavit by San\nFrancisco police inspector Roth, the "all-expense paid trip [to\nIsrael] was more or less a thank-you gift and a liaison gesture by the\nADL to continue the close relationships it has with specific law\nenforcement officers from the United States."\n\nGerard may have liked what he saw in Israel.  A short time after\ntravelling there, he went to Addis Ababa where he helped with Mossad's\nrescue of Ethiopian Jews.\n\nAs Gerard's relationship with South Africa deepened, he talked more\nopenly about his exploits in the CIA.  "Bullock recalled Gerard\nmentioning that he had been in Algeria on CIA business, and that\nGerard discussed the PLO and 'safehouses,'" says the FBI report, "To\nthis Louie once responded that Israeli intelligence had determined\nthat the PLO and the African National Congress were cooperating.\nGerard also spoke of having travelled with the CIA to Afghanistan....\nLouie also [told Gerard and Bullock] about his adventures inside South\nAfrica as an intelligence officer.  Both Gerard and Louie traded 'war\nstories' and regaled each other and Bullock with tales of 'narrow\nscrapes.'"\n\nAlthough there is still much mystery about what triggered law\nenforcement's investigation of the ADL, it was probably the theft of\na classified FBI report on the Nation of Islam from the FBI's San\nFrancisco office.  Police armed with search warrants recovered the\nreport in the ADL San Francisco office.  Gurvitz says he had sent a\ncopy of it to Mira Boland, the director of the ADL's fact finding\ndivision in Washington, D.C.  Boland was preparing an op-ed piece for\n_The Washington Times_, in which she argued that the Nation of Islam\nshould not receive federal funds for the reconstruction of L.A.\nbecause the group is anti-Semitic and violence-prone.  (Boland, who\nhad arranged the ADL police junket to Israel attended by Gerard,\ntestified in a 1990 criminal trial in Roanoke, Virginia, that she had\nworked for the CIA for 14 months and later was a subcontractor for the\nDefense Department before joining the ADL.  During the trial, Boland\nadmitted to sharing information with a CIA official at an invitation-\nonly ADL conference.)\n\nAfter he was questioned by the FBI last fall, Gerard fled to the\nPhilippines, which has no extradition treaty with America.  Gerard is\nbelieved to have supplied information from police computers not only\nto the ADL, but to Israel and South Africa as well.  The _San\nFrancisco Examiner_ reported that Gerard may be charged with violating\nfederal espionage laws.\n\nAlthough Bullock worked for the ADL for 30 years, and Irwin Suall\npraised him in a July 1992 memo as "our number one investigator," the\nADL now argues that he was a rogue agent.  In its own defense, the ADL\nalso asserts that its fact finders operate no differently than\njournalists.  After all, ask ADL officials, don't journalists keep\nfiles?\n\nBut the difference between the practice of journalism and the ADL's\nmethod of gathering information couldn't be more striking.\nJournalists place information in the public domain where they are held\naccountable for falsehoods, distortions, and libel.  And for the most\npart, journalists don't share their investigative files with foreign\nand domestic police agencies.  The ADL has no such inhibition.\nBecause many of its files are not open to public scrutiny, false\ninformation collected by ideologically biased researchers cannot be\ncorrected.  Once a proud human rights group, the ADL has become the\nJewish thought police.\n\n"The ADL says it's a human rights group not just for Jews but for\neveryone," says Chip Berlet, a highly respected researcher at the\nMassachusetts-based Political Research Associates, which monitors\nright-wing extremist groups.  "That's fine but it can't do that and\nspy on Palestinians.  It's blatantly unethical and frankly immoral."\n\n"My argument to people is that the ADL wears four hats.  Each of the\nhats independently is appropriate.  It is a broad-based human rights\ngroup that looks at the broad issues of prejudice and discrimination.\nIt is a group that defends Jews against defamation.  Entirely noble.\nNothing wrong with that hat.  It is a group, whose leaders, at least,\nconsistently defend the actions of Israel against its critics, which\nagain is entirely appropriate.  And it is a group that maintains an\ninformation-sharing arrangement with law enforcement.  Again, there is\nnothing wrong for a group to do that."\n\n"But you can't do all four.  It is impossible to do all four and not\nviolate the bounds of ethics.  There's a built-in conflict of interest\nif you wear all four hats."\n\nADL national director Abraham Foxman apparently sees no such conflict.\nIn a September 1, 1992, letter to the _Voice_, Foxman complained: "ADL\nhas a proud 80-year record of fighting bigotry and promoting civil\nrights and constitutional freedoms.  Any imputation of an effort or\nmotive on our part to smear or stifle the free speech of anyone is\nfalse and baseless"\n\n"Throughout his pieces [on AIPAC's spying], Friedman describes the\ndissemination of information as if it were slander, and the existence\nof files as a token of McCarthyite inclination.  The depiction is\nmisleading in several ways.  Virtually every journalist, academic,\npolitician and organization keeps files on subjects they deem\nrelevant; tracing the logic of Friedman's reckless charges, the\nLibrary of Congress is tantamount to the KGB.  Moreover, disseminating\nthe public record of a public figure is neither defamation nor\nMcCarthyism."\n\nBut many believe the ADL is increasingly in the defamation business.\nAsk Jesse Jackson, James Abourezk, or the leaders of the New Jewish\nAgenda -- all past targets of ADL smears.  (At the same time, the ADL\nexonerated the fascist World Anti-Communist League, which assisted\nRonald Reagan's covert war against Nicaragua, a policy endorsed by ADL\nleaders.)\n\nIn the early 1980s, researchers Russ Bellant and Berlet asked to meet\nfact finding head Irwin Suall, to discuss their work on anti-Semite\nLyndon LaRouche.  "Our view then of Irwin Suall was that he was this\nreally terrific investigator," says Berlet.  "So we introduce\nourselves, say what we are up to and Suall leans back in his chair and\nbasically runs down a dossier on each of us: about what our political\nactivities are, who we work with, what organizations we belong to.\nObviously, he was just trying to blow us away and he succeeds\nadmirably.  We were just sitting there with our mouths open feeling\nvery uncomfortable."\n\n"And then he leans forward and says, 'The right-wing isn't the\nproblem.  The left-wing is the problem.  The Soviet Union is the\nbiggest problem in the world for Jews.  It's the American left that is\nthe biggest threat to American Jews.  You're on the wrong track.\nYou're part of the problem.'  We were stunned.  I was virtually in\ntears.  This is not how I perceived myself.  We basically stumbled out\nof there in a daze."\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n               Letters (response to Friedman's article)\n\n         The Village Voice, May 18, 1993, Vol. XXXVIII No. 20\n\nA LEAGUE OF HIS OWN\n\nRobert I. Friedman's assault on the Anti-Defamation League [The Anti-\nDefamation League Is Spying On You." May 11] demonstrates that he has\nan axe to grind and his own prejudiced and biased agenda to promote.\nIt also demonstrates that concern for accurate reporting is far down\non his list.  The story is replete with inaccuracies, innuendos, and\noutright falsehoods, and conveys a picture of ADL so divorced from\nreality as to be farcical.  Friedman is even wrong on such basic,\neasily determined facts as where ADL was founded (Chicago, not New\nYork) and the building in which ADL'S San Francisco office is located\n(not the Jewish Community Federation building pictured).\n\nADL has done the work of fighting haters for 80 years, without\n"spying" on organizations or individuals and with profound respect for\nthe law.  Our mission is to monitor and expose those who are anti-\nJewish, racist, anti-democratic, and violence-prone, and we monitor\nthem primarily by reading publications and attending public meetings.\nThrough the years, we have published scores of reports on anti-\nSemitism emanating from both the left and the right.  In fact,\nalthough Friedman's bias leads him to assume the contrary, ADL's\nprimary concern is still the far right.\n\nBecause extremist organizations are highly secretive, sometimes ADL\ncan learn of their activities only by using undercover sources.\nFriedman's hyperbole notwithstanding, these sources function in a\nmanner directly analogous to investigative journalists.  Some have\nperformed great service to the American people -- for example, by\nuncovering the existence of right-wing extremist paramilitary training\ncamps -- with no recognition and at considerable personal risk.  The\ninformation ADL obtains is placed in the public domain, and through\nthe years ADL has established a reputation for accurate reporting.\n\nFriedman's article, by contrast, contains so much misinformation that\nit would take an article equally as long to set the record straight.\nA few examples:  He states that an "ADL leader was deeply involved in\nthe [Jonathan Pollard] Israeli spy operation," and that Pollard's\nhandler's wife "worked for the New York ADL as a lawyer."  Not true.\nFriedman also states:  "ADL investigators in unmarked vans videotaped\nPalestinian funerals."  Not true.  Elsewhere, he asserts that ADL was\nobsessed "with spying on anti-apartheid activists."  Again, not true.\nWe could go on and on -- and, of course, Friedman does not reveal\n*his* sources.\n\nThe distortion games Friedman plays when he mentions numbers further\nreveal his lack of objectivity.  When it comes to how much ADL paid\nRoy Bullock a week -- as an independent contractor, not an employee\n(an important distinction Friedman also fails to make) -- he includes\nthe zeros ($75.00, $150.00), inviting the reader to see a large\nnumber.  By contrast, when he observes that ADL paid Bullock "nearly\n$170,000" between 1985 and 1993, he chooses not to point out that\namounts to little more than $20,000 a year -- hardly an excessive sum.\n\nWhat is accurate about Friedman's story is Chip Berlet's description\nof ADL's four hats.  Yes, ADL looks at broad issues of prejudice and\ndiscrimination.  Yes, ADL defends Israel against critics.  And yes,\nADL maintains an information-sharing relationship with law enforcement\nregarding extremist activities and hate crimes.  We see no conflict in\nthese four activities, and we believe most _Voice_ readers won't\neither.\n\nABRAHAM FOXMAN\nNational Director\nAnti-Defamation League\nManhattan\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nROBERT I.

What say you and Nick go somewhere else with this shool yard crap.
Sealing off the Gaza Strip has the interesting side-effect of\ndemonstrating the non-viability of Gaza as an independent state.\nWhere are all of these people going to go to find work if they are\nseparated from Israel?

Why don't you pull your head out of your ass and into reality?  First off, what\nis the deal with your subject lines? Do you think that you are being funny?\nHa ha.  What a developed sense of humor you have, I'm surprised they let you \nout of the cage.  Why don't we not talk about the "official" definition of\nforeign aid and talk about where money is really spent.  More money is spent\nstationing troops in Germany (ie paying the troops, maintaining bases and equip,\netc) than in Israel.  Plus, Israel does not ask the US to send troops to fight\nher battles.  If you look at the amount of money spent defending Korean \nshipping lanes, Norway, and other trouble spots in the world, you will see that\naid to Israel - from a practical standpoint - is not that much.  And so what -\nso what if Israel gets the most (assuming I buy your feeble argument)?  What \nis your point?  Do you not want to subsidize Israel?  Well, you have two options\n1) Start your own campaign, get elected as president, and then force congress\nto cut all aid to Israel or 2) get the fuck out!  If  you don't like how this \ncountry operates and can't change it then move to Iran or something.

If he gives you the same story explaining the presence of several\nsynagogues in the "Moslem Quarter", then the story becomes suspect...\n\nIn reality, the Old City was not as neighborhooded in the past as it\nbecame after 1948.  In pre-Israel Jerusalem, there were many Jews in\nwhat is now called the Moslem Quarter.  There are postal and telephone\ndirectories from that time to prove it.  It's really rather\ninteresting to hear Arabs there claim that a house or store has been\nin the family for centuries even when there are clear photos and\ndocuments that show a Jewish-owned business at the same location just\na few decades ago.
And the best evidence you can find is second hand hearsay from\nan unnamed source? You may indeed be confusing *some* Muslims \nwith Nazi Armenians. Altogether 30,000 Nazi Armenians served in \nvarious units in the German Wehrmacht, according to Ara J. Berkian. \n14,000 in predominantly Armenian army units, 6,000 in German army \nunits, 8,000 in various working units and 2,000 in the Waffen-SS.[1]\n\nA number of these Nazi Armenians were volunteers from France,\nGreece, Rumania and Bulgaria who had chosen to commit\nthemselves to the German war effort. Derounian says that\n\n"Dashnag Armenians from France bore the mark 'Legion \nArmenienne.'"[2]\n\nThat Nazi Armenians like Dro 'the Butcher' and Nezhdeh sided\nwith the Germans probably had an impact on the decision of\nArmenians who overwhelmingly opted for armed service.\n\n[1] Enno Meyer, A.

In the \nsecond half of 1943 infantry battalions 814, 815 and 816 were created.\nThese battalions together with other indigenous Caucasian units were\nattached to the infantry division 162. Also attached to ID 162 were\nthe field battalions II/9, I/125 and I/198 which were formed between\nMay 1942 and May 1943. Altogether twelve Armenian battalions served the\nNazi army, if battalion II/73, which was not employed at any time, is to be\nincluded.[1] Most battalions were commanded by Nazi Armenian officers.\nArmenians wore German uniforms with an armband in the Dashnag colours \nred-blue-orange and the inscription 'Armenien.'\n\n[1] Joachim Hoffmann, 'Dies Ostlegionen 1941-1943, Turkotataren, \n    Kaukasier und Wolgafinned im deutschen Heer,' (Verlag Rombach\n    Freiburg 1976), p. 172.\n\nWhile having collaborated with the Nazis against Stalin during the\nSecond World War, Nazi Armenians changed their policy after Hitler's\ndefeat. They now backed Stalin's claims on Eastern Turkish provinces,\nhoping that these would be annexed to Soviet Armenia and their Muslim \npopulation would be exterminated. Stalin played on Armenian national\nsentiments to enlist the support of Armenians in the USSR and America\nfor his imperial ambitions.[1] Stalin's ultimatum to the Turkish\ngovernment led Truman to formulate his famous Doctrine.\n\n[1] Walter Kolarz, 'Religion in the Soviet Union,' (London, Macmillan &\n    Co Ltd; New York, St Martin's Press 1961), pp. 160-164.\n\nSerdar Argic
In today's Jerusalem Post Magazine there is a feature story about the\nongoing restoration of synagogues in the Jewish Quarter.  The author,\nLeah Abramowitz, writes that there were FIFTY-SEVEN synagogues in the\nquarter in 1948, ALL of which were destroyed, some, she says, used as\ndonkey stables.  The building shells, that is.\n\nI still find it really, really hard to understand why the demolition\nof the buildings in front of the Kotel continues to evoke more outrage\nthan this.  Everything is so much cheaper when it happens to the Jews.\n\nWhy?
Kaufman,\nI think we have a problem in this newsgroup: every time somebody puts\ndown serious questions on Israel, the first response would be "what about\nthe Arab countries?" ...\n\nMost of the Arab countries governments are ruling their people with Iron\nfist policy and Dark Ages democracy (if exists). Ironically, these are \nthe countries that the "West" would like to deal with and would wage \nmassive wars to protect them and their resources.\n\nFor Israel the situation is different, Israel claims it is a\ndemocracy -- I would call it selective democracy, that abides by Western\ndemocratic standards. If Israel is saying that then\nit has to be compared to Western standards. If this comparison is the\nadvertized propaganda from Israel, then we have to look at seriously at\nquestion that can and should be asked regarding any country advertizing\nthis standard. \nThat is very incorrect, I see you have been brain-washed well, I would\nrecommend non-Zionist history books).\n\n\nPlease, speak for yourself. Do not imagine that "everyone" subscribes to\nyour beliefs, you would be lucky if you believe them yourself.\n\n\nWhat is this, you trying to destroy the credibility of the author, why?\nall of this because he asked some serious question. These tactics of\ndestroying the credibility of a person beacuse you do not agree with\nher/him is old and does not work anymore, go tell your superiors\n(AIPAC?) to change their guide books.\n\n\nSalam,\n\nEyad Nuweiri\nSoftware Engineer\nUnify Corp.		\n\n*** Disclaimer: This is my personal views, not of my employer ***
The whole "saddam is going to invade Saudi Arabia" was nothing but US State\nDepartment propeganda.  Saddam (and Iraq in general) never recognised the \nBritish created Kuwait.  They were trying to recover land they believed\nwas theirs, much like the Argentines in the Faulklands.  The Kuwaitis pushed\njust a little too far by taking Iraqi oil and Saddam thought he'd settle\nthe dispute the old fashioned way...\nEverybody would have been much better off had they left the reunited Iraq\ntogether and concentrated on taking out Saddam.  A strong, united Iraq with\nan elected government would have gone a long way to ridding the world of\nthe feudal dictatorships in the Gulf.\nBut of course a weak divided Arab people better suits US foriegn policy...

From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>\nSubject: Help Palestinian education\n\n\nHOW TO HELP PALESTINIAN EDUCATION\n\n(From 'Educational Network', No. 11, April 1993,\npubl. by Ramallah Friends Schools, P.O.Box 66, \nRamallah, West Bank, via Israel\nTel. 972-2-956230,  Fax. 972-2-956231)\n\nMany of our readers have written to us asking how \nindividuals and organizations can help Palestinian \neducation. We have compiled a list of suggestions to guide \nyou. If you are interested in pursuing one or more of \nthese suggested activities, the Educational Network can \naid you by /coordinating/ the initial contacts, /following \nup/, and /providing any other support/ you may need.\n\n1.  Link your teachers' union with a teachers' union here \n--- linkage should be based on a shared pedagogical \nenterprise.\n\n2. Get your union to actively support the right of \nPalestinian teachers in the Occupied Territories to form \nunions:\n\na. through the International Labor Organization (if your \nunion is a member)\nb. contacting other international unions which have \nsupported our right to form a union -- we can supply \nnames and addresses.\n\n3. Establish a SCHOLARSHIP FUND for one or more \nPalestinian students to study at a Palestinian university \nor school -- or establish a scholarship fund for a \nPalestinian student or teacher to study at a university \nabroad.\n\n4. Reproduce and publish information about Palestinian \neducation:\n\n    a. for your union membership;\n    b. for the outside community.\n\nThe Educational Network can supply up-to-date \ninformation and statistics.\n\n5. Send delegations of teachers to visit the Occupied \nTerritories during periods when our schools are in \nsession.\n\nThe Network can arrange an itinerary, make hotel and \nlocal travel arrangements, and provide a guide for the \nvisit.\n\n6. Sponsor Palestinian teachers to visit your city for an \neducational tour:\n\n      a. to see schools and speak with educators in order to\n          learn about progressive pedagogical ideas and\n           experiences;\n\n      b. to speak about the conditions of Palestinian\n          education.\n\nThe Network will coordinate from Palestine.\n\n7. Establish teacher-exchange programs for one year in \nwhich a Palestinian teacher from a private school teaches \nat a public or private school abroad while a teacher from \nthat school spends a year in a Palestinian private school.\n\n8. Send an experienced educator to the Occupied \nTerritories to give workshops (all-day workshops or two-\nday workshops) on innovative teaching techniques.\n\nThe Network will pay for the person's food, lodging, and \ntravel while in Palestine, and will serve as guide.\n\n9. Set up a pen-pal program with a Palestinian school in \neither English or French.\n\n10. Set up a sister-school program with a Palestinian \nschool which would actively involve teachers as well as \nstudents at both schools -- a great tool for building \ninternational understanding and mutual sensitivity.\n\n11. Keep the Educational Network informed about \nimportant educational conferences so that we can send a \nPalestinian teacher to attend.\n\n12. Send to the Educational Network articles or other \nwritings or books dealing with innovative approaches and \nideas in the field of education so that we can then \ndisseminate the information locally.

Well everybody,\n\nAfter reading tons of notes by Serdar, I have come to the following conclusion.   \nTurkey is PERFECT, and no Turk has ever made a mistake.  He has proved to me at  \nleast that the land occupied by Turkey today, was ALWAYS lived in peacefully by  \nTurks.  (Including Istanbul AKA Constantinople)  They treat their minorities  \nlike gods and have only done good while all of their evil neighbors attacked  \nthem.  Somehow, despite these evil neighbors capable of nothing but murder  \ntheir population has exploded to almost 60 million in Turkey alone. (Note,  \nArmenian worldwide population is approximately 7 million total)  I want to go  \nto this heaven on earth and meet the race that has made Serdar possible, that  \nhas persevered, and has become a mecca for human rights lovers.  (Amnesty  \nInternational must have bad sources, Turkey would never torture its citizens,  \ntreat minorities badly, or kidnap 7 foreign journalists last year alone, who  \nincidentally are still missing), what I am trying to say is I WANT TO BE A  \nTURK!!!!\n\nNow back to reality.  I have once again been astounded by Serdars ability to  \nignore all truth, all truly difficult questions, and go on to his encyclopedia  \nof quotes and sources that can be pasted into any note BY THE PAGE!  Anybody at  \nall who has believed ANYTHING he has said, please step forward.  Let him know  \nhe hasn't been wasting his time, that SOMEBODY out there can be convinced by  \nthe volume of e-mail you can produce, not the quality of the content. Well I am  \noff now.  I will go dream  some more about that perfect place, that nirvana,  \nthat utopia, that xanadu, that TURKEY!
Let me improve this one for you, then. For nearly one thousand years, \nthe Turkish and Kurdish people lived on their homeland - the last \none hundred under the oppressive Soviet and Armenian occupation. The \npersecutions culminated in 1914: The Armenian Government planned and \ncarried out a Genocide against its Muslim subjects. 2.5 million Turks \nand Kurds were murdered and the remainder driven out of their homeland. \nAfter one thousand years, Turkish and Kurdish lands were empty of Turks\nand Kurds. \n\nThe survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye.\n\nToday, x-Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and \nKurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x-Soviet Armenia.\n\nToday, x-Soviet Armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its \npredecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against \nhumanity.\n\nx-Soviet Armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the Muslims \nby admitting to the crime and making reparations to the Turks and Kurds.\n\nTurks and Kurds demand the right to return to their lands,\nto determine their own future as a nation in their own homeland.\n\n...On this occasion, we once again reiterate the unquestioned \njustice of the restitution of Turkish and Kurdish rights and...\n\n- We demand that the x-Soviet Armenian Government admit its \nresponsibility for the Turkish and Kurdish Genocide, render \nreparations to the Muslim people, and return the land to its \nrightful owners. The recognition of the Genocide has become an \nissue which cannot be delayed further, and it is imperative that \nartificial obstacles created for political manipulations be removed.\n\n- We believe the time has come to demand from the the United States \nthat it formally recognizes the Turkish and Kurdish Genocide, adopts \nthe principles of our demands and refuses to accede to Armenian pressures \nto the contrary.\n\n- As taxpayers of the United States, we express our vehement \nprotest to the present U.S. Government policy of continued \ncoddling, protection and unqualified assistance towards x-Soviet\nArmenia.\n\n- Our territorial demands are strictly aimed at x-Soviet Armenia's.\n\n\nSource: "From Sardarapat to Sevres and Lausanne" by Avetis Aharonian.

Oops...small mistake.  Thanks for mentioning it.  I just read on\nthe.Israel.line that a village just got shelled by terrorists last week \nand some children were killed.  I guess the terrorists must have gotten by\nthe security zone.  Just think at how much more shelling would be \nhappening if the security zone weren't there.\nL8r...\n\n   Steve\n--
Throughout the years of the Israel/Arab-Palestinian conflict, the internal\nPalestinian popultation has found itself essentially relegated to the\nlower tiers of the economy. Given the major kinds of positions required\nby the Israeli and the "Palestinian" economy, there are essentially two\ndifferent ones existing side by side aren't holding down many of the "\nskilled" positions. So, when Gaza has to operate on its own, there are \nfew residents trained to fill the need for middle and upper management.
From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>\nSubject: Arab H.R. Assoc.,Nazareth\n\n\nThe Arab Association for Human Rights\nP.O. Box 215\nNazareth, 16101 Israel\nPhone (972)-6-561923\nFax (972)-6-564934\n\nThe Arab Association for Human Rights (HRA) was \nformed in 1988 to address discriminatory practices and \nhuman rights abuses by Israel against its Palestinian \ncitizens.\n\nIt is a unique association concerned with the civil, \npolitical, economic, social and cultural rights of the \nPalestinian national minority in Israel. Among the issues \nof concern are land confiscation, education, prison \nconditions, unemployment, torture and the unequal \nallocation of Israel's resources.\n\nToday there are around 800,000 Palestinian Arabs living \nwithin the Green line (the pre-1967 borders of Israel), \nconstituting 18% of Israel's citizens. For them it is an \nempty citizenship in a system geared exclusively for the \nneeds of the Jewish population. Legally and practically, \nIsrael has proclaimed itself a Jewish state and early \npromises of equality for non-Jewish citizens have not \nbeen fulfilled. This is apparent in many areas strongly \naffecting the Palestinian national minority.\n\nMost Arab agricultural land has been confiscated since \n1948. The Arab sector is vastly underfunded and does \nnot receive a fair share of state resources. On a day-to-\nday level, Palestinians face discrimination in many \ndifferent forms and find it is a struggle to get permission \nto build a house, start a business, find a job or educate \ntheir children.\n\nACTIVITIES
In September 1990, our medical reserve unit was sent to the KETZIOT\nprison camp to take care of Arab prisoner who were housed in 5\nsections of 1500 prisoners each, with each section subdivided in\n5 units housing 300 prisoners. The prisoners would "communicate"\nwith other distant sections (sometimes 50-100 yards away) by\ntaking stones, tying written notes to the stones, and throwing\nthem with incredible precision to other sections. I should have\nbeen a recruiter for the Red Sox :-) There were at least three\nprisoners who could have been outstanding pitchers.

Owieneramus. Always has to stick his 'ASALA/SDPA/ARF' made nose into \nevery discussion with non-points and lies. Well, still anxiously\nawaiting...\n\n\nSource: Cemal Kutay, "Ottoman Empire," vol. II., p. 188.    \n\n"The atrocities and massacres which have been committed for a long time\n against the Muslim population within the Armenian Republic have been \n confirmed with very accurate information, and the observations made by\n Rawlinson, the British representative in Erzurum, have confirmed that\n these atrocities are being committed by the Armenians. The United States\n delegation of General Harbord has seen the thousands of refugees who came \n to take refuge with Kazim Karabekir's soldiers, hungry and miserable, \n their children and wives, their properties destroyed, and the delegation\n was a witness to the cruelties. Many Muslim villages have been destroyed\n by the soldiers of Armenian troops armed with cannons and machine guns\n before the eyes of Karabekir's troops and the people. When it was hoped\n that this operation would end, unfortunately since the beginning of \n February the cruelties inflicted on the Muslim population of the region\n of Shuraghel, Akpazar, Zarshad, and Childir have increased. According\n to documented information, 28 Muslim villages have been destroyed in the\n aforementioned region, more than 2,000 people have been slaughtered,\n many possessions and livestock have been seized, young Muslim women\n have been taken to Kars and Gumru, thousands of women and children who\n were able to flee their villages were beaten, raped and massacred in the\n mountains, and this aggression against the properties, lives, chastity \n and honour of the Muslims continued. It was the responsibility of the\n Armenian Government that the cruelties and massacres be stopped in order \n to alleviate the tensions of Muslim public opinion due to the atrocities \n committed by the Armenians, that the possessions taken from the Muslims\n be returned and that indemnities be paid, that the properties, lives,\n and honour of the Muslims be protected."\n\n\nSerdar Argic
Armenians have been doing just that for a long, long time.\n\nSource: "Hagop Hagopian said to have been part of 1972 Terror Attack at\nMunich Olympic Games," The Armenian Reporter, February 7, 1985, p. 1.\n\n"Le Matin, the influential Paris daily, based on unidentified sources,\nclaimed last week that Hagop Hagopian, the founder and leader of one\nfaction of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA),\nwas among the Arab terrorists who staged an attack on the living quarters\nof Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympic Games...\n\nLe Matin added that up to 1982, Hagopian operated out of Beirut, Lebanon,\nbut escaped from the country when Israeli forces entered the city. It was\nabout this time that a statement issued by ASALA claimed that Mr. Hagopian\nwas dead of wounds suffered during a bombing by the Israeli Air Force,\nalthough it is generally believed that the mysterious leader is alive and\nwell and presently is residing alternately in Damascus, Syria, and\nAthens, Greece. The paper also noted that the socialist government of\nPrime Minister Andreas Papandreou and his P.A.S.O.K. party accepted the\nArmenian underground leader with "open arms" and still providing him\nwith assistance simply because of Greece's traditional enmity with Turkey.\n\nLe Matin further adds that ASALA derives only a small portion of its\nexpenditures from wealthy Armenians who support the cause, with the rest \ncoming either from other sources or from proceeds of an involvement in\ndrug trafficking."\n\nSerdar Argic
Macedonia said yesterday it had neither requested or needs such\nforces.  \n\nThis is sort of like sending the National Guard to Bel Air when\nthe riot is in South Central!\n\nObviously, Clinton is again trying to make policy for image purposes\nin America rather than to try to deal with the real problem and\nassume a share of responsibility for the problem.  He obviously\ndidn't even consult with the Macedonians...he was just looking at\nthe map of the former Yugoslavia for the safest place to put \nAmerican troops so he could say to the Europeans...hey, look, we\nhave troops on the ground in the former Yugoslavia too...now let\nme bomb so I can make it look like I am doing something in the\nAmerican media. \n\nThe problem is that the blue berets in Bosnia are dead meat if\nClinton starts bombing, but Clinton doesn't have the courage to\nask that the blue berets leave, because then he becomes primarily\nresponsible to the Bosnian policy of the UN and the allies.\nClinton wants to have his cake and eat it too...he wants to feel\nfree to use American military power for the sake of domestic\nUS politics and his domestic image, but he doesn't want to assume\nthe primary international leadership role in the UN and among\nthe allies, like Bush, for all his faults, did in the Gulf War...\nbecause with leadership comes responsibility, and Clinton seems\nto want to retain the Europeans as scapegoats.\n\nClinton wants to leave the Europeans in charge and responsible,\nbut wants to freelance on the side...and if his freelancing gets\ntoo hot, he wants to be able to cut and run...the American public may\nbe easily fooled...European leaders aren't.
This is an outrage!  I don't even own a dog.
This is such Bullshit.  Deir Yassin was an unprovoked attack on\n   the part of the Jews, and a massacre defines it best in my\n   opinion.  The village of Deir Yassin had had a pact with the\n   Jews, a peace pact, but the Irgun purposely broke this\n   agreement in order to scare off the Palestinians.  I might\n   grant that this village housed armed Arabs [I doubt it] but\n   nothing in the archives and available literature indicates that\n   this was a motivating force amongst the Irgun.  The Deir Yassin\n   MASSACRE was part of an over all strategy to intimidate the\n   Palestinians to flee the Jewish Homeland.,...and contrary to\n   your belief, many civilians were killed.  Deir Yassin was later\n   advertized by the very Jews who perpetrated it because it was\n   useful in getting many Palestinians to leave.  The Palestinians\n   were rightfully scared off, because they did not want another\n   Deir Yassin.  \n	   I'm not necessarily condemning the Israelites here;\n   atrocities were aslo committed on the part of the Arabs.\n   Israelophiles should just be careful in thinking that they are\n   and were the good guys in the middle east.  Both Arab and Jew\n   suck equally.\n\nrj3s, you say that there is no evidence that what motivated the Irgun\nto attack Dir Yassin was its strategic importance. In fact, Begin,\nwho was in charge of the Irgun, wrote that Dir Yassin was attacked for\nits military significance.\n\nDir Yassin was merely a battle in the War of Liberation. People died.\nBut the thing was never intended to be a masacre. That this hapenned\nis a tragedy of war - not a crime of the Irgun.
Anybody has any information about the number of the people have been killed\nby Israel  during these 44 HAPPY YEAR?

How generous Andi.  Thanks for your validation.
OK, you've already disqualified yourself (who ever you are) from\nbeing objective.\n\n\nJews are a people with a common cultural heritage, religion, and history.\nWe are not a race.\n\n\n\nYou don't see a difference between killing British soldiers (who were\npreventing Jews who tried to escape the Nazis from entering the\nBritish mandate) and Arab terrorist who kill civilian men, women, and\nchildren?!?\n\n\n\nThat's ridiculuous on atleast two counts.  First of all, even if you identify\nyourself as completely Jewish that doesn't rule out the possibility that you're\na self-hating anti-semite.  One can always find Jews who are uncomfortable with\ntheir identities (since they only want Jews to be cowering victims) and are\nwilling to speak up for their enemies.  Secondly, the strength or weakness of\nyour arguments does not depend on your identity.
If you think that kind of uncalled for blanket statement will\ncause censorship at Mr. Jefferson's university you are wrong.

Do you have a problem with the language? I said\neveryone suffered emotionally because they sympathyzed with the\nvictims of Holocaust.

Regardless of what one \nsays you keep hearing what you want to hear.
This is historically incorrect.  Early Zionist 'fighters' did indeed\ntarget civilians.  They made random attacks in Arab marketplaces,\nkilling innocent passers-by.  Your assertion of the opposite is an\nattempt to whitewash history.  Anyone can read about the history of\nthe Zionist terrorists.  A good book to start is the one by J. Bowyer\nBell, an expert in international terrorism.  (His main interest is\nIrish terrorism.)\n\n        AUTHOR: Bell, J.

I have no idea what this guy means but the Syrian Jews are not allowed\nto leave Syria because Assad welshed on his promise and is not letting\nthem go. Israel has nothing to do with it.\n\nAs for the other Arab countries there are still small communities left\nin some Arab countries. Morocco has the largest group I think comprising\nperhaps just over a thousand (but I have lost the exact figure. Maybe\nsomeone will be so kind as to post it). There are communities left in\nYemen (which went to the polls yesterday in what might appear to be a\nfree-ish election), Algeria (this is a tiny group, a couple of leftist\nintellectuals I think), of course Syria and Lebannon.\n\nThe circumstances of the departure of the Jews from various Arab countries\nis controversial in some cases - like Iraq - and I do not want to get into\na dispute about it. Egypt expelled most of its community outright. Most of\nthe French North African Jews left rather than face Independence. I think\nthat Moroccans might have been encouraged by some AntiSemitic acts but I\nam not sure. Someone else around here will know for sure. There are claims\nthat Israeli intellegence officers spread rumours around Algeria that the\nJews would not be welcome but this is probably just propaganda. It would\ntake a very stupid person not to realise the benefits of a move to France\n(as most did) or to Israel. Yemeni Jews were airlifted to Israel. Those\nleft were rumoured to have another airlift last year but I heard nothing\nabout it so I guess it was just a rumour. Any I left out except Iraq?\n\nJoseph Askew

Ofranko. Coming from a self-exposed historical revisionist, a \nself-admitted anti-Muslim and a genocide apologist, Hamaza should \ntake your drivel as a compliment. Furthermore, you even deny the \nobvious. There was a genocide of the Muslims carried out by order of \nthe fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government. Massacres of Muslims must be \nstudied in detail, because they are the first modern example of the \nhorrible crime of genocide. Blame must be apportioned to the Armenians\nand their supporters for the murder of Muslims. The Turkish historic \nhomeland, emptied of its native population until today, remains occupied \nby the x-Soviet Armenian Government.

"Muslim" in ex-Yugoslavia was a *nation* not a religion.  In fact, not\nall Muslims in B-H are followers of Islam.  Therefore, there do (did?)\nexist in ex-Yugoslavia "Christian Muslims."  Tito defined the Muslim \nnation constitutionally, adding Muslims to Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes,\nthe three founding nations which entered into a voluntary union at the\nend of WWI.  In addition, Tito added two other nations constitutionally:\nMontenegrins, and Makedonijans. \n\nNations had the right of secession, but republics did not.  So, "Muslim"\nis much more a political term than a religious term (for those who \ndifferentiate between religion and politics, that is) in B-H.  It was not \na "Christo-Slavic" ideology that made a Muslim nation in Yugoslavia, it\nwas the "Atheist Communist" ideology of Tito.  Before Tito, there was\nno Muslim nation in Yugoslavia.  \n\nThe war is not a religious war, and it is not an ethnic war.  It is a\ncivil war in which the terms of secession are being negotiated with guns\ninstead of pens.  The Croat, Muslim, and Serb political leaders *all*\nchose to fight over the terms of secession instead of compromising and\npeacefully negotiating multilateral secession agreements.
REFLECTIONS ON BOSNIA\n\nLORD OWEN AND THE SERBS\n\nIn early February '93, Lord Owen made appearances in New York City\non the Donahue and Charlie Rose shows. On a couple of occasions on\nthose shows Lord Owen gave away his pro-Serbian position when he\nmade the point that much or most of the Bosnian territory then in\ndispute or already overrun by Serbian forces had been controlled\nand occupied by Serbs before WWII.  It was as if he were saying\nthat since the Serbs had previously occupied those territories and\nlost them during the Hitler years, they should be allowed to\nreconquer them today.\n\nI was familiar with this view because my father, a Yugoslav Jew\nwho escaped to this country during the war, was aided and found\nsympathy among the Serbs during those harrowing years.  In recent\nmonths when the subject of Serbian aggression was mentioned, my\nfather would make the point that 850,000 Serbs were killed by Nazi\nand pro-Nazi Croatian forces known as the Ustasha.  My father is\nso pro-Serbian that he dismissed reports of Serbian atrocities. My\nfather also excoriated New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis,\nbecause, my father said, Anthony Lewis "is always talking about\nthe Muslims."\n\nUpdate--April 28, 1993 After an uneasy truce in and around\nSbernica, shelling has resumed in nearby areas by all sides and\nthe killing and the misery continues apace while the Clinton\nadministration dithers its response.  In the days leading to the\ncollapse of resistance at Sbernica, Lord Owen changed his tune.\nPreviously he had opposed military intervention on the grounds\nthat it would endanger U.N. relief workers. When Serbian forces\nbegan to march on Sbernica, the threat to U.N. relief soldiers\nwent unmentioned while Lord Owen called for outside intervention\nto stop Serbian aggression, including the use of air strikes.  The\ncurrent disastrous situation can be seen as a failure of the West\nand a failure of the Vance-Owen initiative which did nothing to\nhalt the Serbs. Now that it's too late to save Muslim areas that\nLord Owen felt should be in a Muslim state, Lord Owen belatedly\ncalls for strong action.\n\nCLINTON AND BOSNIA\n\nIn the summer of 1992, George Kenney, a senior State Department\nofficial, the undersecretary in charge of the Yugoslav desk, made\nnews when he resigned from the State Department because of the\nBush administration's refusal to take any action to halt Serbian\naggression.  As Kenney saw it, Bush's inaction was largely due to\nthe president's unwillingness to risk any political capital by\ngetting involved there.\n\nApparently the same is true of the Clinton administration.\nClinton gives the impression that he cares more than Bush did\nabout the terrible ongoing tragedy, but the practical effect has\nso far been the same.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, (4/16/93) the Clinton\nadministration did everything it could to suppress a mid-March\nreport by its own experts which called for military action if\nnecessary to protect "safe havens" for the Muslims. At one point,\nSenate majority leader, George Mitchell was so incensed that the\nreport was kept from Congress, that he called for an\ninvestigation.\n\nInstead of helping the desperate Bosnians, Clinton has signalled\nagain and again that Milosevic and the Serbs are free to do what\nthey want in Bosnia--indeed, Clinton and the West have been\nsignalling that the Serbs should get on with the job and finish\noff the Bosnians as quickly as possible while we turn the other\nway.  A key signal was when Clinton made it clear that he would\nNOT send in American military forces on the ground.  On this\nissue, Clinton has made me wistful for Bush.  Bush and Baker could\nnot have done worse, and might have been pressured to do better\nwell before this time.  Lives in Bosnia might have been saved and\nthe destruction might have been curtailed..\n\nThe Nation, the left and "the Bosnian QUANDARY"\n\nTypical of the left's inability to come to grips with the core\nissue involved in Bosnia, i.e., a clear aggressor destroying\nhundreds of thousands of lives, is the editorial on the "Bosnian\nquandary" in The Nation (4/26/93).  In the end the editorial votes\nto do nothing, even while noticing "the ghastly atrocities of the\nBosnian Serbs"  and that the "greater and lesser powers...dither\nand fuss [and] hang back." ("Before anything else happens, the\nClinton Administration ought to pay the $530 million the United\nStates owes the" U.N. the editorial concludes.)\n\nIn its most striking passage, the editorial writer warns that\n"those who are pushing President Clinton to intervene on the side\nof the Bosnians had better review U.S. foreign policy since World\nWar II."  The editorial argues for inaction on the basis that the\nBosnian Serbs are no worse than any number of U.S. clients\nincluding the Chileans, the South Africans, the Greek fascists and\nothers. (In a subsequent column for The Nation, Christopher\nHitchens correctly called this editorial, "contemptible.")\n\n***\n\nWilliam Pfaff, a European based journalist who writes for the The\nNew Yorker and the Los Angeles Times, is among a group of liberal\ncolumnists like Anthony Lewis, and Leslie Gelb who have clearly\nand consistently called for strong Western and American\nintervention to stop the Serbs.  Pfaff's most recent column\n(Liberal Opinion Week 4/19/93) is entitled "International\nCowardice Worsened Bosnian Tragedy."\n\nHe clarifies the international failure which has led to present\nsituation in one sentence. "Having refused to intervene to\nsanction the threat to minority rights in newly independent\nCroatia in June 1991, or to block or penalize the military\naggression by Serbia that immediately followed, and the atrocious\n"ethnic cleansing" which followed that, the United Nations now\ncontemplates deploying in Bosnia military force on a scale which\ntwo years ago could have deterred the horrors Yugoslavia has since\nexperienced."  He goes on to explain that U.N. plans now envisaged\ncall for a "more daunting and open-ended military assignment than\na direct military intervention to halt the aggression would have\nbeen a year ago."\n\nAryeh Neier on the Serbs In his "Watching Rights" column in the\nThe Nation (5/3/93) Aryeh Neier gets to the heart of the\nmotivation of the "aggressors"--the preferred term for the Serbian\nforces who have been besieging and shelling Sarajevo for more than\na year.  He explains that "there is no  military purpose that is\nserved by the destruction of its fabric and its people...Above\nall, few of those aligned with the forces attacking Sarajevo would\nwant to live there even if the city could be rebuilt.  They are\nnot city people.\n\n"It is this, I believe--aside from a desire to break the morale of\nBosnians and make them press their government to accept peace at\nany price--that explains the conduct of the siege of\nSarajevo...[I]t is a loathing for all that is urban, pluralist and\ncosmopolitan that has made Sarajevo the object for devastation.\n\n"Historically, most of the Serbian population in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina has been rural, while Muslims, who were the civil\nservants and intelligentsia during the centuries of Ottoman rule,\nmade up a disproportionate share of the urban population....The\ndestruction of Sarajevo is not only an expression of hostility\nagainst this city; it is also an attack on the urban idea....The\ndemagogues who whipped up the passions let loose by this war\nexploited not only ethnic and religious bigotry but also hatred\nfor all that is cosmopolitan."\n\nThe light that Neier sheds on the issue helps to clarify what is\nat stake.  The Serbs represent the know-nothing, anti-secularist,\nfundamentalist, fascist forces who are attacking the urban,\ncosmopolitan, secular, multi-cultural idea.  They are attacking\nthe rest of us, just as Hitler did. One irony is that at the\nbeginning of the crisis over Bosnia, it was for awhile maintained\nby the Serbs and their supporters that they were responding to a\nthreat by the Bosnian Muslims to create a fundamentalist state.\n\nNeier has shown that it is the Serbs who are  the great threat to\nsecularism, multi-culturalism, diversity and democracy.  It's the\nSerbs who are attacking the democratic notion, the democratic\nidea.\n\nAnthony Lewis comes close to the point when he asks why does\nrespect for Clinton's presidency "depend...on his acting\neffectively against Serbian aggression?...First of all because to\ndo nothing about genocide would be such a betrayal of the values\nwe and our allies profess."  (Times, 4/26/93) But it's not merely\na betrayal of our values.  It's because the Serbs are attacking us\nby proxy, just as Hitler was.\n\nOne argument for decisive action by the West that is heard in a\ndifferent form, is that war in the Balkans is destablizing for\nEurope.  We hear it as, the Bosnians are Europe's Palestinians;\nthat is to say, just as the Palestinian refugee problem has been\nthe key to instability in the Middle East, just so will the\nhundreds of thousands of Yugoslav refugees of all ethnicities\nresult in turmoil in Europe for decades to come.\n\nOne of the lessons of the twentieth century is that even though\nthe Atlantic Ocean divides us, the Americas are ultimately tied to\nthe destiny of Europe. If Europe is destabilized, the U.S. will\ninevitably be affected and drawn into its problems.  As in a\nwhirlpool,  sooner or later we will be drawn into the maelstrom.\nAnd as past history and Pfaff have shown, it's much better if we\ndo so decisively, quickly and on our terms.

Hundreds of books, articles, and\n  documents have been published to describe the horrifying scenes of violence\n  and death.

For that case, I sat down and read his entire\n  treatise "History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey".

There are various contradictory views on the origin of the Armenians.\nThe name is to be found in the Darian inscriptions in the form 'Armina'\nor 'Aramaniya' is to be found in the inscription on the Bistun monument.\nThe following references to the Armenians are to be found in the Bistun\ncuneiform inscription of Dara Vishdasb (510 B.C.).\n\n\n 6.

'Ar' refers to a\nplace, as in Ararat, Archish, Aruyr, Archar, Arshav, Arazen and Aror, \nwhile 'men' is used to refer to spirit, thought or human being, and \ntherefore 'Armen' would appear to signify 'the people of that place'.\n\nG.

Our nation is in no way connected with the word "Armen" that\nforeigners apply to our people.'\n\nIt would thus appear that 'Armenia' is a place-name, that 'Armen' is \nthe name of the people who lived there, and that these are in no way\nconnected with the word 'Hai'.\n\nHaik and Haiastan:\n\nArmenian historians believe Haik to have been a great hero from whom\nthe Armenian people took the name 'Hai'. But the mere resemblance\nbetween the words 'Haik' and 'Hai' constitutes no real proof, and,\nin any case, no such theory appears before the time of Moses of\nKhoren.\n\nHaiasa:\n\nThe following studies show quite clearly that 'Hai' and 'Haiasa' were\nno more than general names used by the Hittites to refer to the \nregion known as Armenia.\n\nProfessor Hachadurian: 'Haiasa was the general name used in Hittite\ninscriptions for Upper Armenia.'\n\nYensen, in his 'Hittites and Armenians' tries to prove that 'Hai' is\nidentical with the Hittite 'Hatio', in other words that 'Hai' is a\nHittite word. Research, however, has proved this erroneous, and shown\nthat 'Hai' was derived from 'Hatio'.\n\nMortman's attempt to read the Urartu inscriptions as Armenian met with \nno success. As for Greek, there is no point in even mentioning it.\n\nThe resemblance between the words 'Haiasa' and 'Haiastan' is so obvious\nthat we may well accept 'Haiasa' as the oldest form of 'Haiastan'.\n\nLet us now cast a brief glance on how the words 'Hai', 'Haikazan' and\n'Haiastan' entered our older works.\n\nAccording to Karakashian: \n\n'The word "Haik" is never to be found employed with reference to a\nleader of the Armenian people prior to Moses of Khoren, nor is it\never found employed in the forms "Haika" or "Haykazn".\n\nAgahangelos and Puzant use the word as a title or a place-name (he\nimproved and developed Haiastan, etc.). If the word had referred\nto a nation and had been derived from "Hai" or "Haik" they could \nalso have used the words "Haikak" and "Haykazn" in a number of\nplaces.'\n\nAccording to Professor Sayce, who deciphered a number of Hittite \ninscriptions:\n\n'In the Hittite language the suffix -ha is used to specify quality\nor species. The words "Haddanas", "Haddina" were used by the \nAssyrians to refer to the Hittites. With the transformation of the\n"d" between the two "a" letters to "y" "Hadinasdani" was in this\nway transformed to "Haiastan"'.\n\nProfessor Grechmer fully agrees with this point of view, but regards\nthe significance and explanation so far accorded to the terms 'Hai'\nand 'Haistan' as quite unsatisfactory. He finds, however, that a \nsolution to this problem is brought nearer by the name 'Haiasa' \nwhich is so frequently found in Bogazkoy from 1400 B.C. onwards.\nForrer takes 'Haiasa' as referring to Upper Armenia. In that case\nit seems likely that 'Haiasa' was actually a part of Armenia. The\nsuffix -dan is of Anatolian origin. The real root is 'Hayasa', which\nrefers to the country of the 'Hayasas'.\n\nE. Chantre writes as follows on the subject of the ethnological \nand Anthropological characteristics of the Armenian people.\n\nThe Armenians in Russia may be characterized as follows: Almost\nall of them are brachycephalic or leptocephalic, very dark,\nabove average height, an Aissores Asian group with close ties\nwith certain Kurdish tribes and Azerbaijan peoples.\n\nAccording to J. Deniker:\n\nFrom the philological point of view, the Armenian and Kurds may be\nregarded as belonging to the Iranian group...The Armenians are \ndescended from various elements and from a very mixed race. Their\naverage height varies between 1.63 and 1.69 according to the region.\nThey are almost always short-headed, with skull measurements of \n85-87. As a race they belong to the Indo-Afghan-Assyrian-Turkic\nfamily.\n\nProfessor Rene Vernont writes as follows:\n\nThe Armenians are a mixture of Semites, Turk, Kurds and Mongols,\nbut some of them display Armenian features, e.g., height a little\nabove average, fair complexion, dark hair, dark eyes, very often\na hooked nose and a rather wide mouth. \n\nInvestigations carried out by N. Kossovitch on the links between\nArmenian blood groups and their anthropological characteristics\nled him to the conclusion that the Armenians did not form a \ndistinct race.\n\nSerdar Argic
The annihilation of Islam ("Turks") is an older Serbian agenda.   But\nI strongly dispute your notion that Croats had a similar older agenda,\nin fact, for the past century or two, Croats and Muslims have seen\nthemselves as having a lot in common, and they generally had friendly\nrelations.  Your suggestion that Croat-Muslim relationship is \nanything like Serb-Muslim relationship is completely wrong.\n\nTo say that Croats and Muslims have a lot in common does not imply\nthey are not separate peoples.  The events of the past two years\nclearly show Muslim determination to remain separate: in their alliance\nwith Croats, they maintained this separation.  Croats would have\naccepted a much closer relationship, I think.  This century plus\nof building bridges between these two friendly peoples is now at\nrisk, because of the inexorable logic of war.  \n\nSince Bosnian Serbs (32% of population) have 10 times more heavy\nweapons than Bosnian Muslims (44%) and Croats (17%) combined, they\nhave squeezed Muslims and Croats into only 30% of the territory.\nMuslims lost more territory than Croats (who built defenses early on).\n\nUnder these conditions, any alliance is bound to fall apart since\nit is easier to recover lost land from Croats than from Serbs.\nThe only thing keeping this in check was the hope of reversal of\nfortunes through foreign military intervention and lifting of the\narms embargo.  Since Warren Christopher had no luck persuading\nthe Europeans to go along with this, this hope was dashed.  Having\nno prospect of outside help, the former allies turned on each other,\nlike two starved animals in a tight cage.\n\nThis inexorable logic, of course, got plenty of help from Serbian\nintelligence operatives, who were doing everything to build\nmistrust between Croats and Muslims for over a year.  A timely\nintervention to stop Serbian aggression would have prevented this.\n\nSadly, nothing was done to create a balance of power on the\nground.  As long as the Serbs enjoy 10:1 advantage, they can \nbreak any alliance, even among friends.  This is tragic, but\nhardly new: "divide et impera" was used by ancient Romans\nwith success.  In my view, Bosnian Muslims and Croats managed\nto resist this divisive strategy reasonably well until May 9, 1993,\nwhen the hope of reversal of fortunes was lost.  \n\nI have a question for the distinguished diplomats: do they\nbelieve Balkan peoples are experimental cannon fodder?  I'd like to know\nwhat did they expect when they decided to enforce the arms embargo which\nsolidified Serbian 10:1 advantage in heavy weapons; how did they expect\nto prevent fragmentation of the Muslim and Croat defense forces;  and how\non Earth do they hope to restore peace without justice?\n\nThe implications of this immoral approach I cannot begin to predict,\nbut I am filled with foreboding...
Yes, it is.  I have taken photos of it's minaret.\n\n\nDunno.\n\n\nThis doesn't sound like "eye for an eye" anymore.  Changed your tune?
There are basically three alternatives for Gaza:\n\n1.  To throw the Jews to the sea. that is basically to make them leave\n   the Middle-East and go back to where they came from (russia, Europe, USA, etc)\n2.  To throw the Gazans into the sea, in accordance with Yitzhak Rabin's\n     wish and that of many Zionists.\n3.  For Israelis and Palestinians to come to an honorable and fair (I\n   don't attempt to say just) settlement, which would allow each person\n   to live in dignity in his country in freedom and equality.\n\nI personnaly opt for the third alternative.

Are you pretending not knowing it? Here is why:\n"Those who are not obedient to we West must be evil!".
If you _know_ that the number is "so high", would you care to provide it?  \nTo tell you the truth, Hamid, most of those killed by the Israeli Army were\nagressors who were invading or attacking Israel with the intention of murdering\nJews and destroying the Jewish State.  Thus, I have no sympathy for them and\nI really don't give a damn about how many were killed.
Yup.\n\n\nI expect better from you, 'Mau'. No, I take that back, I don't. The \ntreaty on the exchange of the Turkish and Greek minorities (1923) left \nno Greek minority in Turkiye, except a few thousand Greeks in istanbul. \nTurkiye is no longer an obstacle for 'Pan-Hellenism.' Although the material \nbasis of Greek policy is no longer visible, there is a residue, which \nseems to unite the Pelopenisians, the Greeks who came from Asia Minor, \nthe Greeks who are originally from the islands of the Marmara Sea\nor those who live in the numerous Aegean islands. This residue is \nalso recognizable in the contemporary Greek government.\n\n\nNot a chance. Greece lost in each and every war conducted "solely" \nbetween Greece and Turkiye: in the Morea in 1821, in Thessaly in \n1897-98, and in Anatolia in 1922. After the Ottoman Empire lost \nWorld War I, the British landed in 1919 a 200,000 Greek army in \nIzmir to exterminate the people of Turkiye. Are you suffering \nfrom a severe case of amnesia? The tired and defeated Turks rose up,\nformed a National Force under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal, and\non August 30, 1922 they annihilated the bulk of the Greek Army.\n\n\n\nI love people who don't read and then spout myths as evidence. Where\nwere Greeks in 1912 and 1913? I guess, they were busy with...\n\n  Greek Efforts to Decimate the Jewish Population of Salonica\n             Culminated in 1912 and 1913\n\n  <<Those Jews who survived these assaults in Southeastern Europe fled\n  particularly to Salonica, whose Jewish population increased substantially\n  as a result, from 28,000 in 1876 to 90,000 in 1908, more than half the\n  total population, though even there increased persecution by local Greeks\n  led many Jews to flee elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire, particularly to\n  the great port of Izmir.\n\n  Despite all the pressure from Ottomans and foreign Jews alike, the ritual\n  murders and other assaults by Christians on Jews went on and on. Greek\n  efforts to decimate the Jewish population of Salonica culminated in 1912\n  and 1913, following Greek conquest of Salonica during the first Balkan War,\n  when many of its Jews, were either killed or terrorized into leaving...>>\n\n  <<Though Greece was obligated by the post World War I treaties to allow\n  Jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to\n  practice their religions without hindrance, a law was issued in 1923\n  which forbad all inhabitants from working on Sunday, stimulating a new\n  Jewish exodus as it was intended to do. Between 1932 and 1934 there was a\n  series of anti-Semitic riots in Salonica, with the Cambel quarter, where\n  most of the remaining Jews lived, being burned to the ground. This\n  was followed by regulations requiring the use of Greek and prohibiting\n  Hebrew and Judea-Spanish in the Jewish schools. A start was made also\n  on expropriating the land of the principal Jewish cemetery in Salonica\n  for use by the new University in order to derive the Jews out [47]. By\n  killing and driving out large numbers of Jews, the Greeks left a\n  substantial Greek majority in the city for the first time, and starting\n  Salonica Jewry on the way to its final decimation by the Nazis during the\n  occupation of Greece starting in 1941.\n\n  Salonica and Izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for\n  Jewish refugees entering the Empire during its last century of existence.\n  Istanbul, Edirne, and other parts of Rumelia and Anatolia received\n  thousands more. Nor were Jews the only refugees received and helped by\n  the government of the Sultan. Thousands of Muslims accompanied them in\n  flight from similar persecutions wherever Balkan christian states gained\n  independence or expanded. The Russian conquest of the Crimea and the\n  Caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century, and particularly during\n  and after the Crimean War, combined with the same independence movements\n  in Southeastern Europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among\n  its Jews caused thousands of helpless, ill, and poverty-stricken Muslim\n  refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the\n  Ottoman Empire, with the Istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly\n  to house and feed them as best it could. From 1850 to 1864 as many as\n  800,000 Crimean Tatars, Circassians, and other Muslims from north and\n  east of the Black Sea had entered Anatolia alone, as many as 200,000 more\n  came during the next twenty years, while 474,389 refugees entered in 1876-\n  1877 as a result of the Ottoman wars with Russia and the Balkan states,\n  with an equal number gaining refuge in the European portions of the\n  Empire.>>\n\n[47] Robert Mantran, 'La structure sociale de la communaute juive de\n  Salonqiue a la fin du dix-neuvieme siecle', RH no.534 (1980), 391-92;\n  Nehama VII, 762; Joseph Nehama (Salonica) to AIU (Paris) no.2868/2,\n  12 May 1903 (AIU Archives I-C-43); and no.2775, 10 January 1900 (AIU\n  Archives I-C-41), describing daily battles between Jewish and Greek\n  children in the streets of Salonica.

The honest answer to your question about Arabs who were expelled\nfrom Jaffa, and/or who fled Jaffa, or anywhere else in Israel, having\nthe right to return is:  Yes, unfortunately, they have the right to\nreturn.  They may apply for citizenship like any other non-Israeli and\nthen go to >Jaffa and try to buy their house back from the Jews who now\nown it.  \n\n	And now a question and answer for you:  Can the Jews who were\nborn and raised in Hebron, or their descendants go back to THEIR homes\nin Hebron?  The answer is: absolutely NOT, because they were almost all\nmurdered by their Arab neighbors - the "palestinians".\n\n	Now, do I think the Arabs should be allowed to even visit\n"their" homes in Jaffa?  Hell, no.  Bring back the Jews of Hebron, Petah\nTikva, Jerusalem, Safed, etc. Then, perhaps I would be in favor of Arabs\nreturning to their Jaffa homes.  However, seeing as no Arab has yet been\nable to bring people back from the dead, I'd say that's out.\n\nWith all the hope in the world,\n\nNissan Ratzlav-Katz

Subject: RE: Europe vs. Muslim Bosnians\nFrom: f54oguocha\nDate: 13 MAY 93 02:28:53 GMT\nSerbs.\n1929).\nIslam \nnot\nwho\nCroats? \nhas \nchildhood was \n\n\nYou've asked a crucial question that underlies much of the genocide. \nBosnian Muslims are slavic in ethnicity. They speak Serbo-Croatian. But\nthere is a Christo-Slavic ideology whereby all true slavs are Christian\nand anyone who converted to Islam thereby must have changed ethnicity by\nchanging religion.  See the poems of Ngegos or the novels of Ivo Andric\nwho brilliantly displays these attitudes on the part of what he calls\n"the people" (i.e. Christian slavs).  For this reason, the war-criminals\ncall all the Bosnian Muslims "Turks" even though they are not ethnically\nTurk and do not speak Turkish as their first language.  For this reason,\nwhat is actually a genocide labeled against those who are ethnically\nidentical but religiously "other" is called, paradoxically, "ethnic\ncleansing" rather than "religious cleansing."\n\nThus, while a war rages between Serbs and Croats as a continuation of\nWWII, and older agenda, the annihilation of Islam and Muslims from\nBosnian, is being carried out under the cover of the Serbo-Croat war.\n\nRegards,\n\nMike.
Well, -I've- been reading t.p.m. for a while and here is what I saw\nYOU write:\n\n\n  >For balance, perhaps you should mention the mosques in Jerusalem that\n  >were razed after the Israeli victory in 1967.  An eye for an eye, I guess.\n\nYour statment clearly tries to "balance" Arab atrocities by noting a\nsingle incident by the Israelis in war-time at their most holy site.\nYou even characterize it as "an eye for an eye".  \n\n\n  >That would be false.  If you read your history, you will learn that\n  >right after the 1967 war, the victorious Israelis decided to raze a\n  >section of the newly captured East Jerusalem, near the Wailing Wall.\n  >It is in this section that mosques were razed.\n\nso now you have to find some source that notes that more than 1 mosque\nwas razed.  You then followed it with:\n\n  >This episode is an example of a good government running amok with\n  >newly acquired power.  \n\nReally?  Do you still feel that Israelis are comparable in the running\namok with power with, say, the Iraqis?  Your "eye for an eye"\ncomparisons don't match the realities that most of us are familiar\nwith.\n\n\nThis happened to be during a war!  And a fierce and mighty war it was,\ntoo.  Would you say that the Jordanians "indiscriminately shot up\nancient structures as is their custom" in describing bullet holes in\nthe walls of the city?  This was war!  It was certainly not any "eye\nfor an eye" characterstic.  Israelis do not harbor the same feelings\nof revenge as the Arabs generally do.  This is one of the reasons that\nthe Peace Now movement exists in Israel and nowhere else in the M.E.
It seems that, to keep the peace talks going, Israel has to keep\nmaking goodwill gesture after goodwill gesture, while Palestinian\nArabs continue to go around hunting Jews.\n\nIf the peace talks are going to have any realistic chance of success,\nthe Arabs are going to have to start reciprocating, especially since\nthey are the ones who will be getting tangible concessions in return\nfor giving up only intangibles.  If they keep trying to change the\nalready agreed upon rules, which seems to be one of their favorite\ngames, the Israelis are not likely to be very confident that the\nintangibles they will receive at the bargaining table will be worth\nthe parchment they're written on.\n\nIt takes two to negotiate a peace.  It's time for the Arabs to start\ndoing their share.
Mr. Oguocha,\n  "Muslims" in the Bosnian context are in fact "Turks"... In fact, correct\n  me if I am wrong, Serbs are attacking Bosnians with their battle cries\n  "Death to the Turks!". \n\n  Is this so shocking? Years of communism apparently suppressed their \n  hatred and anger towards the Turks. But such hatred is obviously one that\n  dies hard. \n  \n  Serbs must understand, Turks are no longer the good old barbarians world\n  has come to know by propaganda after propaganda. \n  \n  Serbs must further understand that barbarism does not work. \n  \n  Serbs must even further understand that barbarism would one day have\n  to face counter-barbarism. So, I urge those people [Serbs] to stop\n  killing Bosnian women and children. And they must never forget that\n  Turks in the motherland are watching...patiently.\n  \n Cordially,
The Jerusalem Post is only a small part of the Israeli media ( One\nthat caters to outsiders for the most part, anyways).\n\nIf you never read Ha'aretz, Maariv, or other Hebrew langauge papers\n, or at least seen some of their articles translated, you are not\nreally getting the Israeli media.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInlcuding some of the left-leaning ones?\n\n\n\nA -6 to a -10? Is that why stations such as PBS have run shows which\ndo not depict the Israeli standpoint at all?\n\nIS that why the Intifada got more coverage in 1987 and 1988 than did\nSaddamn gassing Kurds by the thousands?\n\n\n\n\n\nI am from Montreal. I read the Suburban. Did they ever advocate the\nKahane stupidity of expelling the Arabs? Are they racist?\n\nThe Suburban has some columnists that explain the Israeli standpoint.\n\nThey are nothing like Kahane. IN any case, the Suburban is a paper\nwith a minor local distribution and no influence.\n\n\n\n\nSo what source is the closest thing to a zero?
Joachim Martillo writes\n\nIf you were to substitute the word "Jew"/"Jewish" in this posting where you  \nsee the word "Muslim"/"Islamic", switch Joachim and Mohammed's names around,  \nand then repost this, you would get a flood of messages attacking the author  \nas an anti-semite. And rightly so. The author of this crap is a racist, pure  \nand simple. He obviously has no qualms about being open with it, either,  \nunlike some other Arab- and Mulsim-bashers on the Net. \n\nNow, I for one, am not going to look at Joachim's posting and infer from it  \nthat all Jews think this way. Sure, there might be some, but this view is not  \na part of Judaism, and it is stupid to believe that all Jews' minds are this  \ntwisted. However, some Muslims might look at Joachim's flame as a  \nreaffirmation of their worst fears about Jews: that they all hate Arabs and  \nare racists.\n\nFor this reason, I am alarmed that not more Jews on the Net have spoken out  \nagainst what Joachim has said. They have the chance to possibly change the  \nanti-semitic views of some people on the net, to show them that all Jews do  \n*not* hate all Arabs and Muslims, just like all Muslims do *not* hate all  \nJews. Yet they are missing that chance. Remember, to many people, silence  \nimplies consent.\n\nPeace.\n--
[BH] Tsiel,\n\n[BH] I would contend that there was shelling from both sides of the border,\n[BH] starting from the early 70's.  Certainly the PLO did shell Northern\n[BH] Israel from the Arqoub region, but Israel did much more shelling\n[BH] destroying several South Lebanese villages.  At the very least\n[BH] we can say that both sides exchanged shelling, with occasional\n[BH] aerial raids by Israel on Lebanese villages.\n[BH] In any case Steve's characterization that the 1982 invasion was only in \n[BH] response to years of shelling from Lebanon is false.  Israel had\n[BH] many reasons for invading but mainly it did so to install a government\n[BH] in Lebanon favorable to Israel, and it nearly achieved this aim\n[BH] with the election of Basheer El Gemayel, and his brother, Amin\n[BH] El Gemayel, but the internal situation in Lebanon was too hard\n[BH] to control and predict so Israel had to withdraw, and Amin El Gemayel\n[BH] had to abrogate the 17 th of May Agreement.\n\nBasil,\n\nI was only correcting Steve's statement that Geurillas were shelling Israel\nfrom the Golan, which was absurd.\nThe fact that "Israel did much more shelling" was in response to Palestinian\nshelling from Lebanon. Israel has no intention of keeping an inch of Lebanese\nterritory. Israel will continue to fight Hizbullah, PLO, FPLP etc. as long as\nits northern border is not quiet. If the Lebanese army can control these \nelements then I think we can see genuine peace on the Israel-Lebanese border.\nI remind you that a couple thousand Lebanese cross each day into Israel to \nwork.\nAs for the election of Bashir Gemayel, it is true that he was favorable to\nIsrael, is that why the Syrians killed him? His brother Amin was a Syrian \npuppet, if he had not been, he would have been dead by now.\n\nTsiel
From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>\nSubject: Rabin and his Palestinians kapos\n\n\nRabin's plans for a Palestinian police\n\n(from The Other Front, Alternative Information Center,\nJerusalem, 5 May 1993)\n\n"The decision to view the setting up of a local police force \nfor (sic) the Palestinians as the central issue for \ndeliberation at the peace talks to be resumed next week - \neven before subjects like elections in the territories and \nareas of juridiction in the framework of autonomy - is a \nsign of the Israeli government's serious attitude towards \nthe peace process.\n\n"The setting up of a police force is not part of the 'gesture \npackage', but deals with the very heart and substance of \nthe Palestinian struggle for national identity. As it turns \nout, the main objective guiding the prime minister in the \nsetting up of a Palestinian police force - and apparently \nalso supported by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres - is to \nensure the holding of democratic elections in the \nterritories."\n\nThus writes Amnon Barzilai in his editorial (Israeli daily \nHadashot, 23 April), and his position articulates the \nthinking of most of the commentators who dealt with this \nissue in the past two weeks. Over against them stand the \nsettlers and rightwing parties, who also interpret the \ndecision to encourage the establishment of a Palestinian \npolice force as a significant step towards the instituting of \nreal autonomy, something which will restrict what can be \ndone by the Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza \nStrip. With a variety of demonstrations, including street \ntheater on 'What will happen when there is a Palestinian \npolice force', rightwing elements are attempting to \nfrighten the Israeli public and to pressure Rabin to go \nback on his decision. Members of the Kach movement \nhave even begun to organize a 'settler police force' in the \nOccupied Territories, as counter-balance to the future \nPalestinian police force.\n\nHowever, as Barzilai points out, the main function of the \nnew police force - as far as the Israeli government is \nconcerned - has nothing to do with the settlers, over \nwhom they will apparently have no authority, but will \ncontrol political groups within the Palestinian population, \nwhom the government is interested in neutralizing. \nWrites Barzilai:\n\n"...According to ideas currently taking shape, the setting \nup of a local police force in the territories will precede, \nnot only the stage of electsion, but also the final stages of \nthe preparing of the interim autonomy agreement.\n\n"The willingness of the Israeli government to set up a \nlocal Palestinian police force is evidence that the \ngovernment is serious about arriving at a settlement with \nthe Palestinians..."\n\nIt's no wonder that the Palestinian public is also greatly \nworried about this new Israeli initiative. And it is \ninevitable that pressure will be brought to bear on Faisal \nHusseini and the rest of the delegation members, from a \nvariety of directions, to refuse the gift which Rabin would \nlike to give them. But at this stage, it looks like the \nPalestinians are cooperating in the fulfillment of his \nplans.
It is easy for Sen. Biden to say that when there are no US troops in\nZepa or Srebinica or Sarejevo...\n\nThe existing UN policy may certaining be wrong, but the US wants\nto dictate policy, and make Europe responsible for the consequences\nof that policy...\n\n...Bosnia is a big enough problem for the US to preach about what\nother countries should be doing with their forces...but its forces\nare safely tucked away at home in the US.
%\n%By Elias Davidsson - April 1991 (Revision Oct. 1991)\n\nNote - you are already posting "facts", some of which are outdated.\n\nThe biased presentation of facts, as well as the conclusions that\nyou reach leave me little hope of engaging in any fruitful\nexchange that might lead to a "meeting of the minds".  It is to those\nwho read with open mind, that I address myself.\n\n%The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of\n%Racial Discrimination adopted by the General Assembly of the\n%United Nations in 1965, has now been ratified by most member\n%states. Article 1 of this Convention defines the term racial\n%discrimination as "any distinction, exclusion, restriction or\n%preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic\n%origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing\n%the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of\n%human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic,\n%social, cultural or any other field of public life."\n\nWhile the ideals embodied in this text are worthy goals,\nas the text currently stands I know of no country in which\nracial discrimination of some sort can not be found.\nIt makes no mention of the need for for a legislative\nviolation.\n\n%The General Assembly endorsed in 1975 a resolution defining\n%Zionism as a form of racism and racial discrimination. The\n%important, correct and legitimate resolution is incomplete since\n%it does not include operative statements designed to end Israeli\n%racial discrimination. Meanwhile the United States, on behalf of\n%Israel, are exerting heavy pressure on member states of the United\n%Nations to repeal this resolution and give Israeli racial\n%practices - Zionism - moral legitimacy.\n\nIf you are, in principle, advocating UN intervention via operative\nstatements in this case, it must therefore hold that they can be\napplied to any other case where the council perceives some form\nof racial discrimination as previously exhibited.\n\nScarey thought.\n\n%The very definition of Israel as a State belonging to the Jews of\n%the world (but not to its inhabitants), alienates all native\n%non-Jews born in that country. \n\nActually, I know quite a few native non-Jews born in Israel that are not\nalienated by this law.  If you had said some, you would probably be\ncorrect, however your tendency to exagerate and slant facts becomes\napparent.  This slant permeates the text.\n\n%Practically all non-Jews who are living in or originate from areas\n%under Israeli control, identify themselves as Palestinians. Most\n%of them are Muslim, many are Christian. A few Jews, including the\n%author of these lines, also identify themselves as Palestinians.\n\nThe above statement is not true.  Practically all - discounting\nBeduins, Circassians, Druze, and some other fringe groups.\nYour own identification is a matter that has no bearing upon the\nissue.  You could equally identify yourself as a [insert group].\n\n%Zionism took off in Europe at the end of last century. It's aim\n%was to create a Jewish state in Palestine in spite of the adamant\n%opposition of Palestinian Arabs (95% of the population).\n\nIf I recall correctly, at the time "zionism" took off, there\nwas no adamant opposition in Palestine.  I am open to any\nfactual contradictory evidence .\n\n%But the\n%Zionists were more powerful, militarily, economically and\n%technologically, and succeeded in 1948 in conquering 70% of the\n%area of Mandatory Palestine. After driving into exile most native\n%Arabs from the conquered areas, approximately 750,000 people, and\n%razing most of their villages to the ground, the Zionists could\n%finally establish a predominantly Jewish State. Only 150,000\n%non-Jews remained on Israeli territory.\n\nDo you therefore contend that the 400 villages you mention further on "most\nof their villages"?\n\n%Once the Jewish State was established, it began enacting laws to\n%help the confiscation of land from native non-Jews, their\n%political repression and their destitution.\n\nThere is no doubt that laws passed provided a framework which was later\nused for these purposes.  However, you seem to imply that this was the\nintention a priori, which implies a policy and agenda.  My knowledge was\nthat this was not the case.\n\nYou also neglect to mention the circumstances that surrounded\nthis.  As you do again, below.\n\n%In 1967 the State of Israel invaded Egypt and Syria and occupied\n%the rest of Palestine (the West Bank and the Gaza strip). Thus\n%another 1.5 million Palestinians fell under its juridiction. Its\n%occupation of Palestinian and other Arab territories is considered\n%illegal by the international community, as reflected in Security\n%Council resolutions. Israel has rejected all U.N. resolutions and\n%began without delay to entrench its occupation and rule over these\n%territories with the aim of annexing them at the appropriate time.\n\nNot quite accurate.  Israel has not rejected all the resolutions,\nthough it has conflicting understanding with regards to some of them.\nIsrael never annexed the Sinai, West Bank, or Gaza.  The other\nannexations were brought about partly due to the UN resolutions.\n\n%Part of these territores, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights,\n%have already been forcefully annexed by Israel, in defiance of\n%international law and UN resolutions.\n\nOut of curiousity, provided that the annexees are granted citizenship,\nwhat int'l law do you claim prohibits annexation of territories\ncaptured in war?  Has this ever been applied to any other country\npreviously (other than Iraq) ?\n\n%It must be emphasized that, although these people live under\n%different regimes, they are united in their self-perception as\n%Palestinians, that is as people identifying with Palestine, a\n%territorial entity (not an ethnic or religious entity).\n\nIncorrect! Palestinians themselves claim to be discriminated against\non an "ethnic or racial" basis.  Therefore your above statement is\nincorrect.\n\nI also note that given the previous definition of racial discrimination,\nthe only means that you could argue for that is nationalistically.\nHowever, no such nation has existed.  It definitely did not exist\nat the time of the creation of Israel, in which case you can not\nargue racial discrimination during that period!\n\n%Furthermore Palestinians generally consider the PLO both as a\n%symbol of national identity and as the unchallenged authority that\n%represents them in world affairs.\n\nOnce again, some do, some don't.\n\n%The non-Jewish population living in the Palestinian and other Arab\n%territories occupied by Israel in 1967 suffers not only blatant\n%discrimination but is subject to brutal military occupation.\n\nAnother generalization, but then again, you don't seem to care\nabout anyone other than the Palestinian people, whose cause you\nespouse.\n\n%licence, to start a business and to buy industrial equipment, the\n%right to educate children, all of these basic rights are subject\n%to arbitrary rulings by military authorities and cannot be\n%challenged in court.\n\nIncorrect once again.  They have the ability to appeal.\nFurthermore, although you may not agree with them, not all\nof the military rulings are senseless or arbitrary.  Some\nare, but this is not due to the "whims" of the military as\nmuch as the sizeof the task/organization.\n\n%Only Jewish inhabitants of the occupied\n%territories are permitted to carry firearms.\n\nIncorrect once again.  I know two Arab policemen who lived in\nDaheisha and there were more.  Of course, with the outbreak of\nthe intifada they were forced by the locals to resign, bitterly.\n\n%Jewish settlers have\n%right to 6-7 more water per person than non-Jews. Jewish residents\n%of these territories number now about 100,000 people. It is Israel\n%governmentUs policy to increase this number substantially, in\n%total defiance of international law, UN resolutions and the will\n%of the population. The State of Israel systematically confiscates\n%land from non-Jewish inhabitants of these territories for Jewish\n%settlement.\n\nThat is no longer true, and I can't help but wonder what your\npurpose is/was in posting this.\n\n%Some 800,000 people in Israel proper,are not Jews. Most of them\n%consider themselves Palestinians with Israeli citizenship. For\n%many years after the establishment of Israel they were subjected\n%to harsh military control. Much of their land was confiscated by\n%the State and handed to Jewish organisations for exclusive Jewish\n%settlement. They have been subject to massacres, destitution and\n%humiliation. While they enjoy, with Jewish Israelis, the right to\n%vote, they are discriminated against both through law and in\n%practice.\n\nOnce again, to hell with the other minorities that don't fit in,\nright?  Their are many villages who did not suffer in the way\nyou seem to indicate, Abu Gosh comes to mind.  Yes, some did but\nas a result of what actions?\n\n%Approximately 92% of the surface of the State of Israel within the\n%Rgreen lineS is for all purposes closed to Palestinians who are\n%second-class citizens in Israel. They may neither legally live on\n%such land, nor rent or cultivate it. A direct effect of these\n%policies is that native non-Jewish citizens of Israel are denied\n%residence and membership rights in most rural communities in\n%Israel, including the collective settlements, kibbutzim. Non-Jews\n%are discriminated against in many other ways: The Government\n%starves local authorities of Palestinian villages and townships of\n%funds; Jewish city councils force Palestinians to live in ghettos;\n%Jewish families receive higher child allocations than their\n%non-Jewish neighbors, Palestinian schools suffer underfunding and\n%understaffing (as compared to Jewish schools); Palestinian\n%children are denied the right to learn their history and\n%literature; Israelis who struggle for equal rights and for the end\n%of racial discrimination, suffer continuous harassment by the\n%authorities.\n\n1.  There are some kibbutzim with Arab/Non-Jewish members.\n    It is up to the members of the kibbutz.  There is no\n    legislation against it, nor against a purely non-Jewish\n    collective.\n\n2.  Funds are the result of political lobbying.  Bearing in mind\n    that non_Jews compose ~20% of the voting population, it has\n    never failed to amaze me that they fail to form one large\n    bloc, and increase their power.  The recent elections are a case \n    in point.\n\n3.  Please provide factual evidence supporting your allegation\n    with regard to educational material.  You have obviously\n    never seen the curriculum of a school in the West Bank.\n    It is based upon Jordan's school system.\n\n4.  With regard to your last statement, it is simply another\n    gross generalization.  \n\n%The State of Israel refuses to acknowledge itself as the State of\n%all its inhabitants.  Although the Israeli Cabinet has never\n%openly endorsed the 'transfer' idea (the forced removal from the\n%country of its native Palestinian population, that is, its\n%ultimate Judaization), Israeli government policies towards\n%non-Jews bear the mark of this 'Final Solution'. No attempt is\n%made by the Zionist authorities to integrate Palestinian Arabs\n%into Israeli public life. Thus, although comprising approximately\n%17% of the population of Israeli citizens, no Palestinian citizen\n%of Israel has ever served as Cabinet member, as director of \n%ministry or of a national institution, as judge of the Supreme\n%Court, as ambassador of Israel, or in any leading position in\n%Israeli economic or financial life. Even the director of the\n%Ministry for Arab Affairs - yes, such a thing exists! - is a Jew.\n\nAnother generalization, but lets not stop here.\nThe transfer idea was espoused by one party in the last gov't,\nMoledet.  It was intended to be a solution to the problem in the\nterritories, not the country itself.  With regard to other items,\nI recall at least one Arab ambassador, and the rest was covered\npreviously.\n\n%Although sexual\n%relations between and cohabitation of Jews and non-Jews are legal,\n%they are considered by Israeli/Zionist society somewhat a betrayal\n%of the Jewish and Zionist ethics. The Israeli educational system\n%nurtures this attitude in a systematic way.\n\nWhen was the last time you were in Israel?  That is simply not true,\nnor has it been for quite some time.  The question of religious\nintervention is best answered by the proportional representation and\nthe lack of any Arab party bloc to counter the orthodox one.\n\n%Zionism rejects the idea of a modern secular state, based on\n%equality of all citizens. This is one main reason why Israel has\n%not produced any written Constitution. \n\nSimply incorrect.\nThe answer is political.  Once again, your failure to understand the\ndynamics and movements inside Israeli gov't, relegates your\ncontentions to the sidelines.\n\n%Zionism predicates a state\n%where Jews have privileged rights. Thus, according to Israeli law,\n%a Jew born in London, who has never visited Israel, does not speak\n%Hebrew and professes atheism, is granted automatic Israeli\n%citizenship, while native Palestinian inhabitants who happen to be\n%Christian or Muslim, are treated almost as aliens.  Racial\n%discrimination, as defined in international law, is thus not only\n%reflected in Israeli laws and policies, but is grounded in the\n%very nature of Israel as a Jewish state.\n\nBut the discrimination is not based upon race.\nOops, sorry, nasty habit I have of countering malicious false truths.\n\n%Any proposal for Israeli-Arab and Israeli-Palestinian peace that\n%does not address the issue of racial discrimination by Israel -\n%that is the Zionist nature of the State of Israel - is thus doomed\n%to fail.\n\nReal world intrusion - any proposal that does is doomed to fail.\nOf course, I wouldn't expect you to understand, wrapped up as\nyou are in your VIEW of things.  Let's not let anything penetrate\nshall we!?!  I may be a bit too sarcastic but there is a limit to the\namount of patience I have for rubbish at 02:00.

Igor and I had thought that if it was \na girl we would call her Raisa, after my mother-in-law, and if it was a boy, \nwe'd call him Arsen, after Igor's grandfather. I had a girl, and I, without\nIgor, named her Raisa, in honor of her dead grandmother.\n\nOur family and the Melkumians had been neighbors since 1965. Igor and I grew \nup together, we were friends from childhood on. We got engaged when I was 16. \nIn 1981, when I was 18, we were married. Two children were born to us in \nSumgait. My daughter is now 6 years old, her name is Kristina, and my son,\nSeryozha, is four and a half.\n\nFirst I shall tell what happened on February 27. That day on my way home from \nwork I passed Lenin Square, where about 1,500 people had gathered. There were \nKomsomol members there, and Pioneers [Children's organization], and there were \nboth Party members and non-Party people there as well. All of them were \nshouting, "There's no room for Christians here!" and "When we finish with the \nArmenians, we'll go after the Russians!" And some even cried Out, "Death to \nthe Armenians!" Absurd rumors had been circulating about town. I became \nfrightened. I came home, breathless, and told about everything I had seen \ndowntown. My family couldn't believe it. My father-in-law Sogomon Markovich \nMelkumian, wasn't home, he was at an Azerbaijani wedding. By eight o'clock he \nreturned and had barely finished parking the car when his rear window was \nsmashed with a rock. He got out of the car but there was no one there. Well I \nwas telling him everything, too, and he said, "What, is there no longer any\ngovernment?" That same day Igor said, "Papa, something terrible is happening \nin the city." And he said, "We'll stay at home, no one will drive us from our \nown home."\n\nThe day passed. On February 28, that was Sunday, we didn't go out. We called \nour relatives and asked them all kinds of questions, and they all said the \nsame thing. Sometime around evening they started smashing the car of an \nArmenian from the neighboring building. Ira, my brother-in-law's wife, and I \ncalled the police: they're wrecking a car, help. We called and called, and \nnonetheless they didn't come and they didn't do anything.\n\nOn February 29, on Monday, even though there were troops in the city, we were \nafraid to go to work. I called the school: I had the keys to the classroom. I \ntold the senior teacher that he should send someone for the keys, I wouldn't \nbe coming in. He agreed, and even said, "Fine, don't come in, we understand \nwhat's going on in town, don't come in."\n\nBefore that, on the 28th, the Ambartsumian family came over. They came to my \nfather-in-law and said, "Uncle Sergey, they broke our windows, bad things are \nhappening in town." Uncle Misha Ambartsumian even said, "With my own eyes I \nsaw them chasing naked girls through the streets. I don't know," he said, "we \nshould leave town." Well on the 29th we were already trying to decide where we \nshould go, thinking we'd go to our dacha. We got a couple of bags together, \nclothes, food, the bare essentials. And then somewhere around 4:45 the \nbuilding manager came by and said, "Uncle Sergey, the situation in town is \nbad, don't go out." My father even opened up to him and said, "Maybe we'll \ndrive to the dacha, it'll be safer there." "No," he said, "it'll be worse \nthere, you'll be safer at home." He said don't be afraid, if something happens \nI'll send people to save you.\n\nAfter he left about 15 minutes passed and about 200 people burst into our \ncourtyard. All of us were at home at the time: Igor and I and our two \nchildren, Ira and Edik and their daughter, my sister-in-law Ira, and my \nmother-and father-in-law. And the Ambartsumian family, there were three of \nthem, Uncle Misha, Zhasmen, and their daughter Marina. Now when they started\nbreaking down the door I remember Edik and Igor told us, "Go in that room\nand close the door. Close the door and calm the children so they won't hear\nthat there's anyone home." The children started crying. Suddenly Ira, my \nbrother-in-law's wife, suggested, "Let's run out onto the balcony." We -- the\ntwo daughters-in-law and the children, and Zhasmen and Marina -- raced out\nonto the balcony. My sister-in-law and my mother-in-law ran in and said, \n"Quick, over to the other balcony, or they'll kill you all." We lived on the\nsecond floor. We needed to cross over from our balcony to our neighbor's. At\nfirst we couldn't manage it. The balcony looked onto the street. At that time\npeople were coming home from work, and many just stood there, watching. I \npleaded and begged: "Please, call someone, have someone come!" I even started \nshouting. "I'll throw down the children, I'll throw them down, you catch them \nand take them somewhere, so at least the children will survive." Either they \nwere afraid or . . . I don't know what. They looked as though they were \nwatching a movie. Some of them started throwing stones at us. I'll say it \nagain, these weren't the bandits, these were people from the other part of the \nbuilding and from our entryway, they were just regular people, passersby. A \nbus even stopped. I remember a man's voice saying the Armenians were climbing\nover to the other balcony. Ira, my sister-in-law, helped us get the children \nover there. I was pregnant, about seven months pregnant. No, it wasn't yet \nseven, it was six and a half. I climbed over too. I think Zhasmen went first; \nyou know, I just don't remember it all that well. Zhasmen went first, I think, \nand Edik's wife Ira and I had the children, and they were all screaming and \ncrying. My Kristina said, "Mamma, don't throw us over the balcony, we're \nafraid!" Lilia was crying, and Kristina and Seryozha were crying too. Kristina \ndidn't even want to climb over. She shouted, "I'm staying with Grandmother,\nI'm staying with Grandma!" She loved her grandma, more than she loved me. And \nmy mother-in-law shouted, "Oh no, Kristina's still there, she's still there, \nsave Kristina, too!" Ira helped us climb over, with Kristina coming last. Ira \nhelped us and went back inside.\n\nWe started pounding on the neighbor's balcony door. I pounded with my fist, \nSevil, open the door, open it, please!" She didn't open it. "No, go away, go \nanywhere, go, I'm not opening the door." She was our neighbor, we were \nfriends, we never refused her anything, ever! And apparently she thought we \nwere going to break the windows, and she opened the door. She opened it and \nsaid, "Karina, Karina, go away, go anywhere, just don't stay here, they'll \nkill us, too, because of you." I begged, "Please, at least take the children, \nwe'll leave, we'll go back." "No," she said, "you have to leave." Her sons ran \nin, one had a knife. Sevil's brother, he's around 18, shouted at us: "Get out \nof here, leave, I'll kill you with this knife!" I became terrified, I took the \nchildren and went out in the entryway and went down a few stairs. I went down \nand heard a loudspeaker. It was in the courtyard "The Armenians must be \nkilled, they've taken all the best places, all the best apartments!" One of \nthem said, "Let the Armenian blood flow, none of them should survive!" When I \nheard that I went upstairs and started knocking on doors. No one opened their \ndoor for me! Not on the third floor, or the fourth. I couldn't see Zhasmen any \nlonger. Ira came upstairs later. I even thought that they had let her stay, \nthat they would save her.\n\nMy head was spinning. They were killing my family, and here I was in the next \nentryway with two children. Seryozha was four, and Kristina was five and a \nhalf. They were crying, "Mamma, we're scared!" They were so frightened that I \ndidn't even know how to calm them, should I try to calm them or myself? It was \nawful. But on the third floor a man did open his door. I asked, "Open up, let \nme inside!" He opened the door slightly and said, "No!" "No" and that was it! \nHe said it so sternly: "No!" I went up to the fifth floor. I pounded my fists \non the door with all my might. He opened up, the man of the house, and stood \nthere, looking at me. I was ready to get down on my knees. I almost did get \ndown on my knees. "Please, I beg of you, at least take the children." He \nwasn't an Azerbaijani, he was a Lezgin. I don't even know how, but he let me \ninside. And when I went in, Zhasmen was already there. Two minutes hadn't \npassed when Ira and Lilia came up the stairs. Lilia was crying. He didn't want \nto open the door. And again I started pleading, "Please, open the door, it's \nour Ira and Lilia! Open the door!" And he said, "No, I'm afraid." I said again \nand again, "Please, open the door, please!" He looked at me. He looked at me \nfor a long time and then opened the door after all. Ira came in with Lilia. We \nthrew ourselves into each other's arms, crying. Then the man locked us into \nthe bathroom. We sat there for a long time. Through the door he told us, "Calm \nthe children, and calm yourselves down, too."\n\nCalm down? This man was hiding us, but what of our family? When I was still in \nour apartment I had sensed that none of us would come out of this alive. I \nsaid, "Igor, Edik, let's say farewell." And Edik turned around and looked at \nme as if to say, is that some kind of joke? All the same I thought they would \nkill all of us. Igor looked at me, too . . . But it was already too late! They \nstarted pounding on the door, Igor was standing next to the door. Before that \nhe had told us, "Go lock yourselves in that room and sit tight." He thought we \nwere in the room. But before we went out onto the balcony we went to them: \n"Edik, Igor, let's say farewell." Igor didn't think we could climb over to the \nother balcony. And we did get over there, and I myself can't believe we were \nable to save ourselves.\n\nIgor put on a helmet, and Edik had his coat on, and he put on a fur hat. All \nthe men--Igor, Edik, their father, and Misha Ambartsumian--they all stood next \nto the door. They thought they would pound on it a while and leave. But from \nthe other side of the door they ordered in Azerbaijani: "Open the door!" We \nwere all silent, waiting. Someone outside the door said, "They're home,\nthey're in there, break down the door!" And I remember my father-in-law \nwhispering, "They're going to break it down now, it's coming down now . . . "\n\nHe had something in his hands, I think it was a knife: if they got in, we were \ngoing to defend ourselves. In the hall near the door there were two metal \nchair legs. From outside the door they said, "We're counting to five, open \nup!" But we were all quiet, we didn't answer them. We made like no one was \nhome. We figured they'd leave, they'd get tired and leave. My father-in-law \nhad said, "It's not possible they'd come into my home. How can that be? \nEveryone knows us, all of Sumgait knows our family, we are on good terms with \neveryone." And indeed a day did not pass that there wasn't an Azerbaijani \nguest at our table. We had a nice dacha, everyone would get together there \noften, Azerbaijanis liked being with us there too. But now we had to save \nourselves, we had to flee from our own home. Ira, I remember, said, "I'm not \nleaving here, my brothers and my parents are here, I'm going to fight \nalongside them." That's just what she said. She picked up a knife and said, \n"If they open the door and come into the apartment then I'm going to fight \nalongside my family, I'm not going anywhere."\n\nWe were at Sevil's when they broke into our apartment. We heard fighting and \nshouting. The noise was terrible. And when we hid upstairs on the fifth floor \nat the Lezgin's apartment, you could hear everything up there, too. Even Ira's \nvoice. I remember her calling her mother several times. She called her for a \nlong time . . . I started pounding on the door in the bathroom: "Open the \ndoor, what are they doing to Ira, who's shouting, that's Ira shouting, that's \nher voice!" But the Lezgin said, "It's nothing, calm down, no, it's not in \nyour apartment." He was lying to me so I'd calm down. Two hours went by and \nthe Lezgin opened the door and said, "Karina, Igor got away, calm down. He ran \naway." He saw Igor break away and run off with his own eyes. They killed him \noutside, next to the building.\n\nWhile we were in the bathroom I experienced every possible human terror. The \nway Ira shouted! She shouted, "Save me, Mamma, save me! . . . Mamma, Mamma!" \nShe repeated it several times. There was a wild din. There were very many \npeople there, all of them shouting, all of them bellowing, howling, \nwhistling--you just can't imagine what was going on, what the roar was like.\n\nApparently, after they had killed Ira those murderers came into the entryway \nwhere we were hiding and came upstairs, all the way up to the fifth floor. I \ndon't know if they were just looking for any Armenians or for us in\nparticular, but I think they were looking for us because when we had climbed \nover the balconies someone on the street was saying that the daughters-in-law \nwere climbing over the balconies. And after we heard Ira we heard them coming \nup the stairs in the entryway and hammering on the doors. I thought those were \nour last moments, and started saying good-bye to my children, kissing them. \nThey were sleeping. I woke them up: "Kristina! Seryozha, wake up!" And I tell \nIra: "Ira, if something happens, we'll throw ourselves off the balcony." We \nwere on the fifth floor. Apparently our Lezgin neighbor had opened the door \ntoo, because later he said, "I opened the door and told them there were no \nArmenians inside." And after they all left our neighbor went out on the \nbalcony himself to see: they were gone.\n\nWe weren't friends with those Lezgin neighbors, we only knew each other from \nthe building. But the people we were friends with wouldn't even consider \nhiding us.\n\nThe Lezgin let us out of the bathroom. They had a candle burning. He said, \n"Karina, there're no lights on in our block." The whole block was dark, the \nwhole block! It's a huge block, too. The Lezgin said, "I'm afraid to keep\nyou until morning, I'm afraid of the neighbors, they might kill me for saving\nyou." I said, "What are you saying, we'll leave now. But we can't just leave\nwith the children in the middle of the night. Give us time to find somewhere\nelse to hide." He said, "Well OK, go look." I asked Ira, "Ira, do you want to\ngo?" Ira said, "No, I'll stay with the children, Karina." I said, "Fine, then\nI'll go." Zhasmen and I went downstairs together. It was very dark. No one \nwas in the courtyard. It was dark, pitch black. l was afraid to go out at \nafter seven, Igor always met me after work and accompanied me home, I never \nwent out alone. And now here I was out in the middle of the night and after a\nslaughter like that, too. It was probably after eleven. Later I called the \nboarding school and my director answered. He said, "Karina, where are you?" I\ndidn't know, I was calling from a public phone outside and didn't know where I \nwas. I got confused and hung up the receiver. From him I only found out what \ntime it was, I asked him, "What time is it?" He said 11:20, I think, but I \ndon't really remember. So anyway Zhasmen and I went out into the courtyard. I \nlook and see what appears to be a person not far from our apartment. And there\nwas the smell of something burnt. I became horrified. I looked at the corpse \nfor a long time. It was either Ira or Edik. I only saw one of them, Zhasmen \ngrabbed my hand and squeezed it: "Hurry up, let's go . . . Hurry up, come on, \nwhat are you turning around for?" I turned around and saw a large truck, it \nmust have belonged to the bandits, because they came to kill us in a truck \nlike that. We lived in the third entryway, and that truck was next to the \nfourth. We walked quickly, holding hands. I thought, if I go to the police \nthen they'll put me away. I couldn't count on them. Before I reached the \npolice station I saw a military vehicle. We went over and I said, "Soldier, in \nBlock 41, I don't know if they've killed people or injured them--we need to \nsave them!" And he said, "Go to the police station and tell them everything." \nI said, "I'm afraid to go there, I'm afraid of them." He said, "Don't be \nafraid."\n\nWe went to the police and they wrote down the address, and the military \nvehicle went to our building. I didn't go with them, they left me at the \npolice station. I gave the addresses of my mother and my brothers so that \nthey'd rescue them, too. I didn't know where they were or what had happened to\nthem.\n\nAfter a while they brought my children and Ira and Lilia. First they took us \nto the KGB, that was at two or three in the morning. Then around five they \ntook us to the City Party Committee, and there were very many people there, \nvery many. I was pregnant and was wearing nothing but a dress. Seryozha was \nonly wearing a shirt, and Kristina had a little dress on. No coat, no boots, \nnothing! And we sat there for three whole days in the City Party Committee.\n\nThe Lezgin had told me that Igor escaped. And I thought that he was probably \nalive. But then after two and a half days, they took us, the Armenians of \nSumgait, to Nasosny. On March 6 some people from the Central Committee came \nand told us, "Karina, Ira, we need you, come with us to the City Party \nCommittee." My Mamma had come to Nasosny, and she had been looking for me for \nsix days. Mama, my brothers, and my uncle. We went to the City Party Committee \nand waited there in the courtyard. I was wearing nothing but a dress, and Ira \nhad only a dress on as well. There was a strong wind on March 6. An hour went \nby. And then one of the functionaries told us, "Karina, Ira, gather your \ncourage. Would you like to go to the burial?" I said, "What, did they really \nkill all of them?!" He said, "Let's look." He had a long list, and he started \nreading them off: Igor Melkumian, my husband, Eduard Melkumian, my brother-in-\nlaw, Irina Melkumian, my sister-in-law, Sogomon Melkumian, my father-in-law,\nand Raisa Melkumian, my mother-in-law. He read off all their names and said, \n"Get in the car, let's go to the burial."\n\nWe buried our family. I couldn't believe it at the time, I couldn't conceive\nof it or imagine it . . . And even now I think how shall I explain it to my \nchildren when they're older?\n\nMy children were very attached to their father and their grandfather and\ngrandmother. Kristina didn't love me the way she loved her grandfather and\ngrandmother, they spoiled her. Kristina would always announce, "My grandma is \nbetter than anyone!" Now, even though she is getting used to my mother, it's \ndifficult for her, and once she told her: "You're a bad grandmother."\n\nI don't know why, I asked her, "Kristina, where's Papa?" and she said, "They \nkilled him." She knows, she understands it all. And recently I scolded\nSeryozha severely for something, and he started shouting at me, "When Papa \ncomes I'm going to tell him everything!"\n\nJuly 26, 1988\nNairi Boarding House\nNear the Village of Arzakan\nHrazdan District\nArmenian SSR\n			- - - reference - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

In Turkish Genocide Apology <9304261739@zuma.UUCP> as scribed by its servile\ndolt sera@zuma.UUCP (Serdar Argic) we read a response to article <1993Apr26.\n175246.24412@colorado.edu> perlman@qso.Colorado.EDU (Eric S. Perlman) who\n\n[EP] This has been discussed before, by several people, on this net.  The\n[EP] statement is attributable either to Hajj Amin al-Husseini, former Grand\n[EP] Mufti of Jerusalem - and the leader of the Palestinian death squads\n[EP] during the 1948 war, or to one of his chief henchmen.  \n\n[(*] In Russia General Dro (the Butcher), the architect of the Turkish\n[(*] genocide in WWI, was working closely with the German Secret \n[(*] Service. He entered the war zone with his own men and acquired\n[(*] important intelligence about the Soviets. His experience with\n[(*] the Turkish genocide in x-Soviet Armenia made him an invaluable \n[(*] source for the Germans.[2]\n\nWhat a fool! For the above to be true, [which it is not] the WWI Russian\nGeneral Dro must have worked from his grave to assist x-Soviet Armenia.\nSoviet Armenia became ex-Soviet Armenia in 1991 and Dro died in 1958! Then\nDro would have to travel back in time, while dead, from 1991 to WWII to help\nNazi Germany!
It seems that Egypt is only interested in fighting wars against its own\npeople, while objecting to any steps for Bosnia.. I am not surprised,\nWHo said that Mubarak represents Egypt (Hell he does not even represent\nall the criminals of Egypt)\n\n\n....\n\nThanks Saudia for the pocket change.\nCompare that to the "Liberation of Q8" and to what they gave to some\nweird causes.. O.K at least they are paying.\n\n\nMr. Amr Moussa was not worried about International law when he tortured\nto death  many of his citizens and when he shot people praying in a Mosque,\nor when he is causing trouble to his neighbor just becasue the CIA says so.\nWhy doesn't he just shut up, he won't be involved in any Bosnian effort\nanyway, or does the west have to be represented even in an Islamic conference?\n\nThe more I hear about the Egyptian regime, the more I understand the\nexistence of the "Jamaa Islamiyah" there. After all most of its members\nand leaders are former and current victims of government torture, injustice,\nor relatives of victims. In some other places they get psychiatric care AND\nrevenge in the COURTS. But all they got is more of the same resulting  in a \ncycle of madness that is initiated by the government with the illicit support \nof the west who is more concerned about the safety of half naked tourists in\nconservative neighborhoods than the dignity, social justice, and safety of the\nmajority of the poor oppressed people of Egypt. Enough said.
As I said, I do not want to convice anyone, so, why should my opinions\nconvince anyone?\nI do not believe that my opinions are refuted by facts.\n\n\n\nMaybe youy view of a dictionary is the problem here. One thing is the\naccepted meaning of a word by a dictionary, and sometimes a completely\ndifferent thing is what that word came to mean after a long time.\n\n\n\nOK. Tell me how many people in Zionist movements define a Jew in a \ndifferent way, and how many are who define Jew based on a religious way.\n\n\nYou need to start reading before answering. \nMy point was that because some movement claims to be nationalistic, it \ndoes not mean that I consider it to be nationalistic. I did not comapre\nIsrael to the IRA. I think that you are starting to put words on my \nmouth and that is wrong.\n\n\n\nI never said that Zionism is monolithic. If you are going to attribute\nme things, present the quotes where I said that.\n\n\nThat is your problem. I could certainly interpret this like you are \nrunning out of arguments. First, you put words in my mouth, now, you\nsay you do ot believe me.\n\n\n\nWhy don't you try reading for a change? Did I say that the Law of Return\ndemand a person to be religious? Now, how does the Law of Return define \nwho is a Jew and who is not? I said that it uses a religious standard:\nIf your mother is a Jew, you are a Jew, if your mother is not Jewish,\nneither you are.\nDo not twist my words, please.\n\n\n\nI am not talking about the debate. I am talking about how things are right\nnow. When the debate is over, I'll see what happens.\nRight now, things are like they are.\nLet me ask you one thing. I understand that Israel differenciates between\nCitizenship and Nationality. Suppose M(ale) and F(emale) have a child in\nIsrael. Which nationality will the child's ID show, according to each one\nof the following cases:\n\na) F and M are both Jewish.\nb) F is Jewsh and M is not.\nc) F is Muslim and M is jewish.\nd) F is Christian and M is Jewish.\ne) F and M are both non-Jewish.\n\n\n\n\nIt called history. At some point it was OK. Now, I believe, it is not. \n\n\n                                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n ^^^^^^^^\n\nInteresting. How do you know? Had I ever talked to you about this and \nforgotten about that?\n\n\n\nWhich definition are you now talking here about? \nI do not know why you are so touchy. I never said that you did not support\nPalestinian self-determination. I just gave an example of hypocrisy. I never\nsaid that someone in this net is guilty of it. It was just an example. Nothing\nmore, nothing less than that. Why did you have to clarify what you think?\n\n\nHere you have several problems.\nFirst, you should know that words have more meanings than those given in\nthe dictionary.\nSecond, it may come to be a shock for you to know that there are more\nwords than those in the dictionary.\nThird, we can exchange ideas if you want, but you come out with this nonsense\nabout being believable = using the definitions given in a dictionary.\nIt seems that you cannot answer to the ideas given by others without insulting\nothers. Sad.\n\n\nIf you did not put words in my mouth, it might be that you might\nstart reading what I had actually said. So far, you come over and over\ntwisting what I said or presenting things I never said as if I had said\nthem. In this way, you are answering to yourself. That is why you do not\nfind it believable. Maybe, if you start reading what I had actually said,\nand not what you added, you might change your mind.\n\n\nFirst, there is nothing resembling a fact in what you added to what I said,\nas if I had said it. \nSeconf, anyone else is supposed to mean "than I do"?
Ah - Palestine and the Arab Israeli conflict.  Sounds interesting.\n\n\nThis is misleading.  I supposed Charles D. Smith characterizes the bombing\nof the King David Hotel as a civilian installation too.  Any installation \nattacked by Etzel was linked to some sort of official function of the \nMandatory government.\n\n\nWhat kind of CIVILIANS?  I assume Charles D. Smith means completely innocent\npeople who were intentionally targeted, right?  Please provide examples.\n\n\nNice strawman.  In _The Revolt_ Begin does state that the *myth* of a massacre\nat Deir Yassin may have had the effect of scaring some Arabs into fleeing.\nHowever, nowhere does he claim that this was the result of any specific policy\nof the Etzel.  Thus, if it did happen, it was not so intended.  I think Arab \ncalls for Palestinians to leave and fear of a war started by Arab hands had \na greater effecton Arab migration than Deir Yassin.\n\nIn fact these jewish TERRORIST groups managed\n\nReally.  Nice use of caps.  I like it.  Very effective.  Actually, according to \nmany sources, including American diplomatic officials, the greatest encouragment\nfor Arabs to leave their villages came from Arab leaders.
Not to muslims :)\n\n\n\nThat could be arguable.. (for bandwith and flames sake, I wont say more)\n\n\n\nIt is a civil war, but the serbian generals who allow rape are not fighting\nfair.  Yah I know .. war is hell  ..  those serbian generals are propretuating\nboth..\n\nLines and bordres .. money .. power .. fear .. \n\nLet's change canadian bordres while we are at it :) \nI see this as civvil war..\n(sp borders)\n\n\n\nPossibly..  I do agree that it is a civil war, which makes the donation of\nhumanitarian aid even more complex...  I mean serbs are bleeding too and I heardthat a few croats had raped serbian women.. (unconfurmable at this point)
wrote in response to article <30975@galaxy.ucr.edu>, raffi@watnxt08.ucr.edu \n\n[IC] There are some Armenians here, in the USA.\n[IC] In fact, there are some areas where Armenians are majority.\n[IC] Suppose, a large group of people of one of such area decides,\n[IC] that the US "government is not representing their interests, and vote for\n[IC] seperation" from the USA.\n\nThe Armenians you refer to have chosen to come to the United States lawfully \nand peacefully. However, if Armenians invade the United States and force\nAmericans to either flee or become Armenians, it will not succeed. Similarly,\nthe Armenians of Karabakh are being forced by Azerbaijan to either become \nAzeris or leave, and it also will not succeed, as has been demonstrated. \n\nKarabakh, irrespective of its geographic position situated technically within\nthe Stalin-prepared borders of Azerbaijan, has been long oppressed and \neventually was invaded in 1991 by Azeri OMON and Soviet forces, resulting in \nthe northern third of this Armenian area being depopulated of Armenians. The \nArmenians have been fighting back ever since. \n\nClearly, you feel it rather ridiculous for Armenians, of let's say Glendale, \nCalifornia, to engage in an independence movement for a free and independent\nGlendale. Similarly, the Azerbaijanis are engaging in a losing attempt at\nclaiming sovereignty over the land and people of Karabakh, who have lived\ncontinuously in Karabakh a thousand years before the first Central Asian \ninvaders ever stepped foot in the Caucasus. \n\n[IC] Should they get it? \n[IC] And should the UN enforce their will?\n[IC] And is it a simple, beautiful concept, indeed?\n\nYour analogy has broken down because you have switched positions of the victim\nand invader. A better analogy would be the direct parallel between Armenians \nof Karabakh and Native Americans. Now, if you wish, we can discuss the tenets \nof might versus right and the policies of settler nations!
This is such Bullshit.  Deir Yassin was an unprovoked attack on\nthe part of the Jews, and a massacre defines it best in my\nopinion.  The village of Deir Yassin had had a pact with the\nJews, a peace pact, but the Irgun purposely broke this\nagreement in order to scare off the Palestinians.  I might\ngrant that this village housed armed Arabs [I doubt it] but\nnothing in the archives and available literature indicates that\nthis was a motivating force amongst the Irgun.  The Deir Yassin\nMASSACRE was part of an over all strategy to intimidate the\nPalestinians to flee the Jewish Homeland.,...and contrary to\nyour belief, many civilians were killed.  Deir Yassin was later\nadvertized by the very Jews who perpetrated it because it was\nuseful in getting many Palestinians to leave.  The Palestinians\nwere rightfully scared off, because they did not want another\nDeir Yassin.  \n	I'm not necessarily condemning the Israelites here;\natrocities were aslo committed on the part of the Arabs.\nIsraelophiles should just be careful in thinking that they are\nand were the good guys in the middle east.  Both Arab and Jew\nsuck equally.

I am replying to this because I haven't seen anyone else do so yet. It\nseems rather odd really as there are so few really wierd posters left\nwho aren't fascists or Arab extremists.\n\n\nYes it was and it was clearly admitted so by the troops who carried it\nout and then stupidly deposited testimony in their own archives to that\neffect.\n\n\nSource? Noone is claiming this anymore except you. Would you like\nto name one credible historian who asserts this? I believe that\neven Begin has the decency not to claim this.\n\n\nYes they did and thye said so - they said they went their with the\nintention of killing all the men and all the women who got in their\nway. Their *own* archives remember, this is not hostile testimony.\n\n\nSound van bogged down in a ditch. No warning given.\n\n\nYes it was and no it was not. It was a massacre - the murder of hundreds\nof unarmed civilians who had no part in the fighting. The surviving men\nwere taken to the local quarry and shot in the back of the head. Not\nintentional? Yeah right.\n\n\nNo it did not - you have a source for this slander of course?\n\n\nThe men involved said clearly that the intention was to kill all the\nmen. It was a premeditated mass murder nothing else.\n\n\nOn that we agree at least.\n\n\nYes they did want to kill the inhabitants and many of them were killed.\nThis is of course simple to resolve, the Haganah sent a soldier to report\non the massacre. He brought a photographer with him. He sent in a report.\nThe Israeli government suppressed it. Now the government was a Labour\nGovernment. Since then the Revisionists have gotten into power but for\nsome reason Likud didn't release the report and its pictures either.\nPerhaps you might want to tell me why? If it happened as you claim then\nthere will be no pictures of men shot in the head with their hands tied\nbehind their backs, no women and children shot as they slept. Yet for\nsome reason they did not take the chance to clear their own name. You\nhave a reason for this don't you? I somehow doubt it. The facts are\nexactly as the people responsible claim - a premeditated mass murder\nnothing else. No Iraqi soldiers, no other fighting. Just ethnic cleansing\nat work.\n\nJoseph Askew
Please, read my post carefully, I am saying that lift the arms emargo\nand let the MUSLIMS defend themselves. The point is these Europians \n"civilized countries" neither want to get intervene militarily themselves\nand nor they like to see the muslims of the world to help the oppressed.\n(Remember what happened almost one year ago when the so called UN discovered\nsome riffles in an Iranian jet in Bosnia!). The west is not indifferent\nin this matter they are siding with Serbs by keeping this embargo on only\nmuslim side (okay on-paper on both sides). \n\n-Khalid

Have you ever seen\n    Israel even entertain a policy to exclude non-Jews, let alone  \n    actually try to remove non-Jews from Israel?  If you actually \n    believe that this quote has anything to do with Israel's non-\n    Jewish citizenry today, you are an idiot.  But if you realize\n    that Israel has no intention of removing non-Jewish Israelis,\n    then you are nothing but a common liar.  This one time I will \n    give you the benefit of the doubt, and assume you are stupid. \n\n \nED> "We shall try to spirit the penniless population [the \nED> Palestinians] across the border by procuring employment \nED> for it in the transit countries, while denying it any \nED> employment in our own country"\nED> (Theodor Herzl, The Complete Diaries, Herzl Press, 1960, \nED> I, p.88)\n\n    Once again you quote a man gone for almost a century.  You do\n    so within the context of modern day Israel.  \n    \n    Thomas Jefferson owned slaves.  How does this fact define the\n    United States today?\n\n\nED> "[Jews] must expel Arabs and take their place" \nED> (David Ben Gurion, 1937, quoted in Shabtai Teveth, Ben \nED> Gurion and the Palestine Arabs, Oxford University Press, \nED> 1985, p. 89)\n\n    Did he say 'Jews,' or did you add this?\n \n    This was also a statement from ten years before Israel became\n    a state.  It has no bearing on Israel.  \n    \n\nED> "We must do everything to ensure they [the \nED> Palestinian refugees] never do return"\nED> (David Ben Gurion, in his diary, 19 July 1948, quoted in \nED> Michael Bar Zohar, Ben Gurion: The Armed Prophet, \nED> Prentice-Hall, 1967, p.157)\n\n    YOU added the words 'the Palestinian refugees.'  And by doing\n    so, you are misleading people into believing that Ben Gurion,\n    who was expressing his hope that people who fled their lands,\n    at the encouragement of people such as KING ABDULLAH, and the  \n    MUFTI OF JERUSALEM, was gloating over people abandoning their\n    homes.  What he was refering to were the Arabs with whom Jews\n    were at war.  \n\nED> "The country was mostly an empty desert, with only \nED> a few islands of Arab settlement"\nED> (Shimon Peres, Minister of Defense, quoted in David's \nED> Sling: The Arming of Israel, Weidenfeld and Nicholson, \nED> 1970, p.249)\n\n    At the time of the rebirth of Israel this was certainly true,\n    especially when compared to what Israel has accomplished in a\n    few short decades.\n\n\nED> "All this story about the danger of extermination [of \nED> Jews] has been blown up....to justify the annexation of \nED> new Arab territories"\nED> (Mordechai Bentov, Israeli Cabinet Minister, Al \nED> Hamishmar, 14 April 1972)\n\n    Since Israel has not annexed even one millimeter of territory \n    in more twenty six years, this quote is irrelevant. \n\n\nED> "Neither Jewish ethics nor Jewish tradition can \nED> disqualify terrorism as a means of combat"\nED> (Yitzhak Shamir, Hehazit, Summer 1943 [Journal of the \nED> LEHI, the Stern Gang], translated from the Israeli daily \nED> Al-Hamishmar, 24 December 1987\n\n    Again, you are quoting a man who was fighting for what he had\n    been promised from a time as ancient as biblical, to the time\n    of the Balfour Declaration, just a few short years back.  And\n    what was thought of and described as terrorism by Jews didn't\n    include slaughtering Olympic athletes, brutally murdering the \n    innocent, attacking school buses, and murdering another human \n    being for the sole reason that he or she is an Arab.\n \n \nED> "The domination of Jewish agriculture by Arab \nED> workers is a cancer in our body"\nED> (A. Uzan, Israeli Minister of Agriculture, Ha'aretz, 13 \nED> December 1974)\n\n    There were serious concerns about a work force that consisted \n    of people from OUTSIDE Israel.  It is a wise to be concerned.\n    A work force consisting of foreigners is not a good situation\n    for a country.\n\n\nED> "There can be only one national home in Palestine, \nED> and that a Jewish one, and no equality in the partnership \nED> between Jews and Arabs"\nED> (Montague David Eder, President of the Zionist \nED> Federation of Great Britain, 1931,\nED> in Doreen Ingrams, comp., Palestine Papers 1917-1922, \nED> Seeds of Conflict, George Braziller, 1973, p. 135)\n\n    This also has no meaning for a country formed seventeen years\n    after this statement was made.  Obviously times change.  This\n    is NOT what Israel is about today.  I believe the peace talks\n    make this quote irrelevant.\n\n\nED> "There is not a single Jewish village in this country \nED> that has not been built on the site of an Arab village"\nED> (Moshe Dayan, Ha'aretz, 4 April 1969...)\n\n    This is completely false.\n\n\nED> "Some people talk of expelling 700,000 to 800,000 \nED> Arabs in the event of a new war, and instruments have \nED> been prepared"\nED> (Aharon Yariv, former chief of Israeli military \nED> intelligence, 1980, Inquiry, 8 December 1980)\n\n    Expelled from where?  Israel?  The occupied territories?  New\n    Jersey?  Is there any way we can read this and get an idea as\n    to what on earth he was talking about.  Obviously not.\n\n \nED> "We should there [in Palestine] form a portion of the \nED> rampart of Europe against Asia, an outpost of civilization \nED> as opposed to barbarism."\nED> (Dr. Theodor Herzl, The Jewish State, London, 1896, p. \nED> 29)\n\n    Interesting notion.  Considering that this was written nearly\n    a century ago, it is quite visionary.\n\n\nED> "I deeply believe in launching preventive war \nED> against the Arab States without further hesitation.

Begin is dead.  And it\n    should be obvious to anybody that if Israel was expansionist,\n    it would have ANNEXED the occupied territories right after it\n    captured them.  Israel would not be negotiating to get rid of\n    them.\n\n\nED> "During the last 100 years our people have been in a \nED> process of building up the country and the nation, of \nED> expansion, of getting additional Jews and additional \nED> settlements in order to expand the borders here. Let no \nED> Jew say that the process has ended. Let no Jew say that \nED> we are near the end of the road."\nED> (Moshe Dayan, Ma'ariv, 7 July 1968)\n\n    He's dead, too.  And since Israel has not annexed ANY land at \n    all since 1967, you are once again wasting bandwidth with all\n    of these misleading quotes.  They are so out of sync with the\n    reality of Israel, that you do nothing but make yourself look\n    like a fanatic desperate to sway people, by misleading them.\n\n\nED> "Let us not today fling accusations at the [Palestinian \nED> Arab] murderers.

It's true that we should never lose sight\n    of the plight of these people.  We should also recognize that\n    this quote preceded the disgusting wave of Arab terrorism and\n    violence directed at innocent people, that began in 1972 with \n    the massacre of the Israeli athletes in Munich, and continues \n    to this day.
Pete--\nThat was uncalled for. I'm sure Andi Beyer or whatever his name is\nwas a product of his environment before he came to school, and is\nenjoying the mantle of THE UNIVERSITY to make his viewpoint seem\nlegitimate (well-reasoned). I'm at Virginia, too, and I think \nmaligning UVA is in poor taste, even if Beyer did slip in here.

Not necessarily.  As Shai points out, political appointments are\nbased on power.  They are also based on favors owed, coalition\nbuilding, and deal making.  While this may have a racist element to\nit, I think that its much more fair to attribute it to the "old boy"\nnature of politics.  Now, I'll freely admit that the old boy system\nhas racist and sexist effects, but I don't think that those are its\npurpose, whether in the US, Israel, or elsewhere.\n\n\n\n	Here again, you miss out on the old boy nature of politics,\nand the existance of back-room deals.  As individuals, these arabs may\nnot be as well connected as the Jew who gets the job.  I don't like\nthis aspect of politics, but I understand it exists.\n\nAdam\n\n\nAdam Shostack 				       adam@das.harvard.edu

This is a tautological statement.\n# \n# I think you are confusing "tautological" with "false and misleading."\n\n  No, but you're right that I didn't express myself well.\n\n  The dialog went:\n\n   A: "Zionism is racism."\n   B: "What IS zionism?"\n  DC: "You weren't listening, were you?"\n\n  In other words, the first statement *defined* a Zionism of discourse.\n  Everything else was redundant.
They were attacking the Iraqis to drive them out of Kuwait,\na country whose citizens have close blood and business ties\nto Saudi citizens.  And me thinks if the US had not helped out\nthe Iraqis would have swallowed Saudi Arabia, too (or at \nleast the eastern oilfields).  And no Muslim country was doing\nmuch of anything to help liberate Kuwait and protect Saudi\nArabia; indeed, in some masses of citizens were demonstrating\nin favor of that butcher Saddam (who killed lotsa Muslims),\njust because he was killing, raping, and looting relatively\nrich Muslims and also thumbing his nose at the West.\n\nSo how would have *you* defended Saudi Arabia and rolled\nback the Iraqi invasion, were you in charge of Saudi Arabia???\n\n\nI think that it is a very good idea to not have governments have an\nofficial religion (de facto or de jure), because with human nature\nlike it is, the ambitious and not the pious will always be the\nones who rise to power.  There are just too many people in this\nworld (or any country) for the citizens to really know if a \nleader is really devout or if he is just a slick operator.\n\n\nYou make it sound like these guys are angels, Ilyess.  (In your\nclarinet posting you edited out some stuff; was it the following???)\nFriday's New York Times reported that this group definitely is\nmore conservative than even Sheikh Baz and his followers (who\nthink that the House of Saud does not rule the country conservatively\nenough).  The NYT reported that, besides complaining that the\ngovernment was not conservative enough, they have:\n\n	- asserted that the (approx. 500,000) Shiites in the Kingdom\n	  are apostates, a charge that under Saudi (and Islamic) law\n	  brings the death penalty.  \n\n	  Diplomatic guy (Sheikh bin Jibrin), isn't he Ilyess?\n\n	- called for severe punishment of the 40 or so women who\n	  drove in public a while back to protest the ban on\n	  women driving.  The guy from the group who said this,\n	  Abdelhamoud al-Toweijri, said that these women should\n	  be fired from their jobs, jailed, and branded as\n	  prostitutes.\n\n	  Is this what you want to see happen, Ilyess?  I've\n	  heard many Muslims say that the ban on women driving\n	  has no basis in the Qur'an, the ahadith, etc.\n	  Yet these folks not only like the ban, they want\n	  these women falsely called prostitutes?  \n\n	  If I were you, I'd choose my heroes wisely,\n	  Ilyess, not just reflexively rally behind\n	  anyone who hates anyone you hate.\n\n	- say that women should not be allowed to work.\n\n	- say that TV and radio are too immoral in the Kingdom.\n\nNow, the House of Saud is neither my least nor my most favorite government\non earth; I think they restrict religious and political reedom a lot, among\nother things.  I just think that the most likely replacements\nfor them are going to be a lot worse for the citizens of the country.\nBut I think the House of Saud is feeling the heat lately.  In the\nlast six months or so I've read there have been stepped up harassing\nby the muttawain (religious police---*not* government) of Western women\nnot fully veiled (something stupid for women to do, IMO, because it\nsends the wrong signals about your morality).  And I've read that\nthey've cracked down on the few, home-based expartiate religious\ngatherings, and even posted rewards in (government-owned) newspapers\noffering money for anyone who turns in a group of expartiates who\ndare worship in their homes or any other secret place. So the\ngovernment has grown even more intolerant to try to take some of\nthe wind out of the sails of the more-conservative opposition.\nAs unislamic as some of these things are, they're just a small\ntaste of what would happen if these guys overthrow the House of\nSaud, like they're trying to in the long run.\n\nIs this really what you (and Rached and others in the general\nwest-is-evil-zionists-rule-hate-west-or-you-are-a-puppet crowd)\nwant, Ilyess?
No wonder you 'wieneramus' are in such a mess. Following the Greek \nCypriot attempt to annex the island to Greece with the aid of the Greek \narmy, Turkiye intervened by using her legal right given by two international \nagreements. Turkiye did it for the frequently and conveniently forgotten \npeople of the island, Turkish Cypriots. For those Turkish Cypriots whose \ngrandparents have been living on the island since 1571. And the next is\n'Karabag'.\n\nThe people of Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek \nCypriots will never abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will \nremain eternally hopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever \nthe cost to the parties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece \nwas the sole perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent\nits troops on July 15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate\ngovernment of Archibishop Makarios.\n\nThe release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organization\nof Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the\n'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should not\nforget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks\nin Cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried to\ndestroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece. Of\ncourse, the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences \nfor this irresponsible conduct.\n\n             THE MUSEUM OF BARBARISM\n\n2 Irfan Bey Street, Kumsal Area, Nicosia, Cyprus\n\nIt is the  house of Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major who  was serving at\nthe Cyprus  Turkish Army Contingent. During  the attacks launched\nagainst the Turks by the Greeks, on 20th December 1963, Dr. Nihat\nIlhan's  wife and  three  children were  ruthlessly and  brutally\nkilled in the  bathroom, where they had tried to  hide, by savage\nGreeks. Dr.  Nihat Ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night, the\n24th   December  1963.   Pictures  reflecting   Greek  atrocities\ncommitted during and after 1963 are exhibited in this house which\nhas been converted into a museum.\n\nAN EYE-WITNESS ACCOUNT  OF HOW A TURKISH FAMILY  WAS BUTCHERED BY\nGREEK TERRORISTS\n\nThe date  is the 24th of  December, 1963... The onslaught  of the\nGreeks against the Turks, which  started three days ago, has been\ngoing on  with all its  ferocity; and defenseless women,  old men\nand children are being brutally  killed by Greeks. And now Kumsal\nArea of Nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the Greeks savage\nbloodshed...\n\nThe wife  and the  three infant  children of  Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a\nmajor on duty at the camp  of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent,\nare  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  the\nbathroom of their house, by  maddened Greeks who broke into their\nhome. A glaring example of Greek barbarism.\n\nLet us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by\nMr. Hasan  Yusuf Gudum, an  eye witness, who himself  was wounded\nduring the same terrible event.\n\n"On the night of the 24th  of December, 1963 my wife Feride Hasan\nand I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan.\nOur neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora, her daughter Ishin  and Mrs.\nAyshe's  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sitting\nhaving supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River\ndirection started to riddle the  house, sounding like heavy rain.\nThinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  was\ndangerous, we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought\nwould be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid in\nthe bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. We\nwaited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor, was standing\nin the bath with her three children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan in her\narms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open.\nGreeks had  come in and were  combing, every corner of  the house\nwith  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heard\nvoices saying, in  Greek, "You want Taksim eh!"  and then bullets\nstarted flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three children\nfell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks,\nwho broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again. I\nheard one of the Major's children moan, then I fainted.\n\nWhen I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later, I saw  Mrs. Ilhan and\nher three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of the\nneighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But what\nhad happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran to\nthe  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  I saw  her  body. She  was\nbrutally murdered.\n\nIn the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying\n"Help, help. Is  there no one to save us?"  I became terrified. I\nthought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not\ndead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself\nunder the double-bed.\n\nAn our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. My\nmouth was dry,  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some\nwater. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the\nbathroom, which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There I\noffered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe,  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber who\nwere all wounded.\n\nWe  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o'clock in  the morning.  I\nthought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and needed\nto be taken  to hospital. Finally, as we could  walk, Mrs. Novber\nand I, went  out into the street hoping to  find help, and walked\nas far as Koshklu Chiftlik.\n\nThere, we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were\noperated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there\nwere more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs.\nAyshe and her daughter.\n\nAfter staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to\nAnkara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  months\ntreatment but still I cannot use  my arm. On my return to Cyprus,\nGreeks arrested me at the Airport.\n\nAll  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during my\ndetention. They then released me."\n\nON FOOT INTO CYPRUS'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER\n\nWe went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia in\nwhich 200  to 300 people have  been slaughtered in the  last five\ndays.\n\nWe  were the  first  Western  reporters there,  and  we saw  some\nterrible sights.\n\nIn the Kumsal quarter at No. 2, Irfan Bey Sokagi, we made our way\ninto  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.  A\nchild's bicycle lay in a corner.\n\nIn the  bathroom, looking  like a group  of waxworks,  were three\nchildren piled on top of their murdered mother.\n\nIn a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in the\nhead.\n\nThis, we  were told, was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whose\nfamily had been killed by the mob in the first violence.\n\nToday was five days later, and still they lay there.\n\nRene MacCOLL and Daniel McGEACHIE, (From the "DAILY EXPRESS")\n\n"...I saw in  a bathroom the bodies of a  mother and three infant\nchildren murdered because their father was a Turkish Officer..."\n\nMax CLOS, LE FIGARO 25-26 January, 1964\n\nSerdar Argic

Well, does it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920, \nthe Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted and participated \nin the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race, religion\nand national origin?\n\nBetween 1914 and 1920, 2.5 million Turks perished of butchery at the \nhands of Armenians. The genocide involved not only the killing of \ninnocents but their forcible deportation from the Russian Armenia. \nThey were persecuted, banished, and slaughtered while much of Ottoman \nArmy was engaged in World War I. The Genocide Treaty defines genocide \nas acting with a \n\n  'specific intent to destroy, in whole or in substantial part, a \n   national, ethnic, racial or religious group.' \n\nHistory shows that the x-Soviet Armenian Government intended to eradicate \nthe Muslim population. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were exterminated by the \nArmenians. International diplomats in Ottoman Empire at the time - including \nU.S. Ambassador Bristol - denounced the x-Soviet Armenian Government's policy \nas a massacre of the Kurds, Turks, and Tartars. The blood-thirsty leaders of \nthe x-Soviet Armenian Government at the time personally involved in the \nextermination of the Muslims. The Turkish genocide museums in Turkiye honor \nthose who died during the Turkish massacres perpetrated by the Armenians. \n\nThe eyewitness accounts and the historical documents established,\nbeyond any doubt, that the massacres against the Muslim people\nduring the war were planned and premeditated. The aim of the policy\nwas clearly the extermination of all Turks in x-Soviet Armenian \nterritories.\n\nThe Muslims of Van, Bitlis, Mus, Erzurum and Erzincan districts and\ntheir wives and children have been taken to the mountains and killed.\nThe massacres in Trabzon, Tercan, Yozgat and Adana were organized and\nperpetrated by the blood-thirsty leaders of the x-Soviet Armenian \nGovernment.\n\nThe principal organizers of the slaughter of innocent Muslims were\nDro, Antranik, Armen Garo, Hamarosp, Daro Pastirmadjian, Keri,\nKarakin, Haig Pajise-liantz and Silikian.\n\nSource: "Bristol Papers", General Correspondence: Container #32 - Bristol\n         to Bradley Letter of September 14, 1920.\n\n"I have it from absolute first-hand information that the Armenians in \n the Caucasus attacked Tartar (Turkish) villages that are utterly \n defenseless and bombarded these villages with artillery and they murder\n the inhabitants, pillage the village and often burn the village."\n\nSerdar Argic
Any state that the CIA does not control is called "state that is linked\nto terrorism/militants/fundamentalists etc.."\nMeanwhile Even Egyptian "experts" who hate The Islamic movement admit\nthat what is happening in Egypt is spontaneous and most of the time a\nreaction to what the government does.\n\n...\n\nCan anybody see any contradiction between the above and the first\nparagraph? \nDoes anybody know what the UPI original article's title was?
About 2 years ago, there was a lot of noise about a Church in the Old\nCity of Jerusalem being taken over by a Jewish group.  In fact, the\nbuilding in question was a dormitory that belonged to a church and was \nnot physically connected to any church.  It had been leased to a\nPalestinean Arab for 99 years and a Jewish group sub-leased it from\nhim.  The church that owned the building disapproved and legal action\nwas started to revoke the sub-lease.  The media, however, made it look\nlike Jewish vigilantes were stealing Church property in Jerusalem by\nforce. \n\n\nThe damage has already been done by the press in the above case.  It\nis not surprising by now, of course, that many "decent people" regard\nthe press "with utmost suspicion".\n\n\nYou appear to be referring to Moshe Dayan.  How do you know that the\n"evicted Jordanians" were not provided with something else?  In fact,\nthis thread indicates that they were squatters on land that they did\nnot own but received compensation for their loss, anyways!  Woe to\nJews when they feel that recovering land that has been taken from them\nby force (with "ethnic cleansing" of any remaining Jews) is\n"disgusting and shameful".
This is quite a misrepresentation.  After WWI, many Bosnian Muslims were\nkilled and their land taken over by Serbs, and the motive was plunder,\nnot some fictitious "supression of rebellion."  Even earlier, one can\npoint to the destruction of mosques in Serbia itself and expulsion of\nMuslims.  Here is what Dr. Vaso Cubrilovic, political adviser to the\nSerbian monarchic regime, says in his memorandum "The Expulsion of the\nArnauts" which he presented to the royal government of Stojadinovic\non March 7, 1937, in Belgrade:\n\n   The Mode of Removal\n   -------------------\n\n   [ describes how expulsion of ethnic Albanians from Kosova is to proceed\n   through state terror and "private initiative", i.e. Chetnik plunder: ]\n\n   Private initiative, too, can assist greatly in this direction.  We should\n   distribute weapons to our colonists, as need be.  The old forms of Chetnik\n   action should be organized and secretly assisted.  [...]\n   ...the whole affair should be presented as a conflict between clans and,\n   if need be, ascribed to economic reasons.  Finally, local riots can be\n   incited.  These will be bloodily suppressed with the clans and the\n   Chetniks, rather than the army.\n\n   There remains one more means, WHICH SERBIA EMPLOYED WITH GREAT PRACTICAL\n   EFFECT AFTER 1878, that is, by secretly burning down Albanian villages\n   and city quarters.\n\n(Emphasis above is mine.)  These events in Serbia itself forced out virtually\nall Muslims during late 19th century.  This policy of state terrorism\nagainst Muslims, aided by Chetnik "private initiative," has continued in WWII\nand today.  For example, Muhamed Hadzijahic in his book "Od tradicije do \nidentiteta: Geneza nacionalnog pitanja bosanskih Muslimana" (Sarajevo:\nSvjetlost, 1974) writes (pg. 235) how Serbs killed a Muslim in Foca\nin WWII even though he claimed to be a Serbian patriot, explaining\ntheir action as follows:\n\n   "Inasmuch as you were a Serb, you sullied the Serb name, because you\n   are a Turk [i.e. Muslim].  And since you helped us, we shall not\n   torture you."\n\nso the shot him instead of cutting his throat.  In the past year, Serbs\nhave repeated the slaughter of Muslim residents of Foca.  Destruction\nof mosques, including priceless historical monuments, completes the\neradication of the Muslim presence from territories claimed by Serbs.\n\n\n\nWhich part do you claim is untrue?  Explain yourself, or withdraw your claim.\n\n\nCroatia never had many Muslim citizens for historical reasons, because it\nwas not a part of the Ottoman Empire.  The last major battles between\nAustro-Hungarian monarchy and the Ottoman Empire in Croatia were at the\nend of the 17th century.  Need I remind you that modern Croatian nationalism\ncame into being with Dr. Ante Starcevic, who saw Bosnian Muslims as the\nbest Croats, so much so that in 1853 he contemplated moving his operations \nto Sarajevo?  You are confusing clericalist Croatianism with Croatian\nnationalism here.   Political nationalism has always been stronger.  As\nfor your other theories, you are clearly overjoyed that Croat-Muslim\nalliance in Bosnia-Herzegovina is now in trouble.  Arguments such as\nyours are clearly intended to create and deepen this split.  \n\n\nIn international relations 101 you'll learn that unless weak unite to\ncounterbalance the strong player, soon they are taken over and that's the\nend of them.  Balance of power thinking has brought together Croats\nand Bosnian Muslims.  This is only natural; all other alignments are\nunstable.  I'm working on pointing out this basic fact: Croats and\nMuslims have been aware of it for as long as Serbia has existed.  \nYou are wrong if you think only "image" is at stake here.  Croatia has\na deep interest in her alliance with Bosnian Muslims, and vice versa.  \n\nI think Tudjman understands this, although he does not have much choice \nat this point.  Tensions should have been defused better earlier, before \nany open confrontation developed.  Although I still think Croatia will\nsurvive, it will lose a lot; but Bosnian Muslims may end up even worse\noff.  However, their position now is so horrible that perhaps they do not\nsee it getting any worse.  The key point is: do they still have any hope left?\nIf not, then all bets are off.\n\nMr. Stojanovic is clearly very, very happy about this.  I'm deeply hurt.\nThis is not about some "image" but about survival of a concept of a\npartnership which I believe is natural and essential for both Croats\nand Muslims.
Actually, this strife in Yugoslavia goes back a long way. Bosinan Muslims,\nin collaboration with the Nazis, did to Serbians after the first world\nwar what Serbs are doing to Muslims now. This is not a fresh case of\nethnic cleansing but just another chapter in the continuing saga\nof intense mutual hatred, destruction,... Not taking sides in this\nperpetual war does not amount to religious bigotry. It could just\nbe helplessness with regards to bringing peace to a region that does\nnot even know the meaning of the word.\n\nSatya Prabhakar
Dirty Cosar pig has been doing just that for a long, long time.\n\nSource: "Ahmet Cosar said to have been part of 1992 Terror Attack at\nMacDonalds in Munich," The Fuckersville Reporter, February 7, 1993, p. 1.\n\n"Le Merde, the influential Anatolia daily, based on unidentified sources,\nclaimed last week that Ahmet Cosar, the founder and leader of one\nfaction of the Big Mac Funny Army for the Liberation of Flies from the\nSpider Webs (BMFALFSW), was among the Argic led terrorists who staged an\nattack on the toilets at MacDonalds fast food restaurant in Munich...\n\nLe Merde added that up to 1992, Cosar operated out of tygra.michigan.com,\nbut escaped from the country when Bullshit bikers entered the city. It was\nabout this time that a statement issued by BMFALFSW claimed that Mr. Cosar\nwas dead of wounds suffered during a mailbombing by bdb@becker.gts.org,\nalthough it is generally believed that the mysterious leader is alive and\nwell and presently is residing alternately in Fuckersville, Bullshitia, and\nZuma, Stupidia. The paper also noted that the communist government of\nSexual Maniac Hasan B. Mutlu and his F.U.C.K.A.L.L party accepted the\nZumabot's underground leader with "open arms" and still providing him\nwith assistance in exchange for pornographic material.\n\nLe Merde further adds that BMFALFSW derives only a small portion of its\nexpenditures from wealthy drug lords who support the cause, with the rest \ncoming either from other sources or from proceeds of an involvement in\nchild-porn trafficking."\n\nSerdar Argic
Well, apparently we have another son of Dro 'the Butcher' to contend with. \nYou should indeed be happy to know that you rekindled a huge discussion on\ndistortions propagated by several of your contemporaries. If you feel \nthat you can simply act as an Armenian governmental crony in this forum \nyou will be sadly mistaken and duly embarrassed. This is not a lecture to \nanother historical revisionist and a genocide apologist, but a fact.\n\nI will dissect article-by-article, paragraph-by-paragraph, line-by-line, \nlie-by-lie, revision-by-revision, written by those on this net, who plan \nto 'prove' that the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds is \nnothing less than a classic un-redressed genocide. We are neither in \nx-Soviet Union, nor in some similar ultra-nationalist fascist dictatorship, \nthat employs the dictates of Hitler to quell domestic unrest. Also, feel \nfree to distribute all responses to your nearest ASALA/SDPA/ARF terrorists,\nthe Armenian pseudo-scholars, or to those affiliated with the Armenian\ncriminal organizations.\n\nx-Soviet Armenian government got away with the genocide of 2.5 million \nTurkish men, women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. \nYou, and those like you, will not get away with the genocide's cover-up.\n\nDuring the First World War and the ensuing years - 1914-1920, \nthe Armenians through a premeditated and systematic genocide, \ntried to complete its centuries-old policy of annihilation against \nthe Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering 2.5 million Muslims and \ndeporting the rest from their 1,000 year homeland.\n\nThe attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance\nof Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people.\nThis event is incontrovertibly proven by historians, government\nand international political leaders, such as U.S. Ambassador Mark \nBristol, William Langer, Ambassador Layard, James Barton, Stanford \nShaw, Arthur Chester, John Dewey, Robert Dunn, Papazian, Nalbandian, \nOhanus Appressian, Jorge Blanco Villalta, General Nikolayef, General \nBolkovitinof, General Prjevalski, General Odiselidze, Meguerditche, \nKazimir, Motayef, Twerdokhlebof, General Hamelin, Rawlinson, Avetis\nAharonian, Dr. Stephan Eshnanie, Varandian, General Bronsart, Arfa,\nDr. Hamlin, Boghos Nubar, Sarkis Atamian, Katchaznouni, Rachel \nBortnick, Halide Edip, McCarthy, W.

How about the following scholarly source?\n\nSource: Pierre Oberling, "The Road to Bellapais: The Turkish Cypriot\n        Exodus to Northern Cyprus", Social Science Monographs, Boulder,\n        1982, ISBN 88033-000-7.\n\n\nWell, I am forced to disagree with you. The Greeks started massacring \nthe Turkish population on Cyprus in 1974. In 1974, Turkiye stepped into \nCyprus to preserve the lives of the Turkish population there. This is \nnothing but a simple historical fact. Unfortunately, the intervention \nwas too late at least for some of the victims. Mass graves containing \nnumerous bodies of women and children already showed what fate had been \nplanned for a peaceful minority.\n\nThe people of Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots \nwill never abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain \neternally hopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever the \ncost to the parties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece was \nthe sole perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops \non July 15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of \nArchibishop Makarios.\n\nThe release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organization\nof Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the\n'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should not\nforget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks\nin Cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried to\ndestroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece. Of\ncourse, the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences \nfor this irresponsible conduct.\n\nTurkish Cypriots are simply seeking guarantees that will preclude a\nrepeat performance by the fanatical cadres of the Greeks' EOKA. If \nsuch assurances are not perfectly implemented, there is every reason \nto expect that the local Greeks will be misguided enough to perpetrate \ntheir past mistakes. On such an occasion, the Turkish side may not find \nit satisfactory to act with reluctance to go any further than before, \nfor it is unacceptable to remain always defensive against cyclical \nvicious attacks. Therefore it would be better to have a true federation\nof two separate sections living in obligatory peace, rather than another \narmed confrontation that would be started by the Greeks and obligatorily \nbut decisively terminated by the Turks. \n\nThe present Greek government is trying to tyrannize the Turkish population \nin western Thrace by forbidding it its ethnic and religious rights, which \nwere established through international treaties. One might be better\nadvised to remember that misadventures against Turkiye do not serve \nGreece well.\n\nAn offer of membership in the European Common Market as bait for concessions \nthat may doom the Turks in Cyprus to extinction is not a viable course for \nGreece or her friends. Neither Turkish lives nor Turkish honor has been \nplaced on the bidding block to be sold for commercial gain.\n\n\nSerdar Argic
Yeah right, sorta like the Indian sub-contient, eh?
That is the result of watching anti-Muslim 'SDPA' Nazis/crooks/idiots \ntoo much. Still covering up the crimes of your fascist Armenian grandparents \nand Nazi Armenian parents? Not a chance. As early as 1934, K. S. Papazian \nasserted in 'Patriotism Perverted' that the Armenians\n\n        'lean toward Fascism and Hitlerism.'[1]\n\nAt that time, he could not have foreseen that the Armenians would\nactively assume a pro-German stance and even collaborate in World\nWar II. His book was dealing with the Armenian genocide of the Muslim\npopulation of Eastern Anatolia. However, extreme rightwing ideological\ntendencies could be observed within the Dashnagtzoutune long before\nthe outbreak of the Second World War.\n\nIn 1936, for example, O. Zarmooni of the 'Tzeghagrons' was quoted\nin the 'Hairenik Weekly:' \n\n"The race is force: it is treasure. If we follow history we shall \n see that races, due to their innate force, have created the nations\n and these have been secure only insofar as they have reverted to\n the race after becoming a nation. Today Germany and Italy are\n strong because as nations they live and breath in terms of race.\n On the other hand, Russia is comparatively weak because she is\n bereft of social sanctities."[2]\n\n[1] K. S. Papazian, 'Patriotism Perverted,' (Boston, Baikar Press\n   1934), Preface.\n[2] 'Hairenik Weekly,' Friday, April 10, 1936, 'The Race is our\n   Refuge' by O. Zarmooni.\n\nIn April 1942, Hitler was preparing for the invasion of the Caucasus.\nA number of Nazi Armenian leaders began submitting plans to German\nofficials in spring and summer 1942. One of them was Souren Begzadian\nPaikhar, son of a former ambassador of the Armenian Republic in Baku.\nPaikhar wrote a letter to Hitler, asking for German support to his\nArmenian national socialist movement Hossank and suggesting the\ncreation of an Armenian SS formation in order \n\n"to educate the youth of liberated Armenia according to the \n spirit of the Nazi ideas."\n\nHe wanted to unite the Armenians of the already occupied territories\nof the USSR in his movement and with them conquer historic Turkish\nhomeland. Paikhar was confined to serving the Nazis in Goebbels\nPropaganda ministry as a speaker for Armenian- and French-language\nradio broadcastings.[1] The Armenian-language broadcastings were\nproduced by yet another Nazi Armenian Viguen Chanth.[2]\n\n[1] Patrick von zur Muhlen (Muehlen), p. 106.\n[2] Enno Meyer, A. J. Berkian, 'Zwischen Rhein und Arax, 900\n    Jahre Deutsch-Armenische beziehungen,' (Heinz Holzberg\n    Verlag-Oldenburg 1988), pp. 124 and 129.\n\n\nThe establishment of Armenian units in the German army was favored\nby General Dro (the Butcher). He played an important role in the\nestablishment of the Armenian 'legions' without assuming any \nofficial position. His views were represented by his men in the\nrespective organs. An interesting meeting took place between Dro\nand Reichsfuehrer-SS Heinrich Himmler toward the end of 1942.\nDro discussed matters of collaboration with Himmler and after\na long conversation, asked if he could visit POW camp close to\nBerlin. Himmler provided Dro with his private car.[1] \n\nA minor problem was that some of the Soviet nationals were not\n'Aryans' but 'subhumans' according to the official Nazi philosophy.\nAs such, they were subject to German racism. However, Armenians\nwere the least threatened and indeed most privileged. In August \n1933, Armenians had been recognized as Aryans by the Bureau of\nRacial Investigation in the Ministry for Domestic Affairs.\n\n[1] Meyer, Berkian, ibid., pp. 112-113.\n\nNeed I go on?\n\nSerdar Argic
From Israeline 4/27/93\n\nRabin: We Must Concentrate on Qualitative Changes in Israeli\nSociety\n \nToday's AL HAMISHMAR quotes Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's\nIndependence Day interview yesterday on Israel Television. Rabin\nsaid that enforcing Jewish sovereignty over the entire Land of\nIsrael would lead to the establishment of a bi-national state. "I\nwould view it as if the historical destiny of my generation, Dor\nTashach, the generation that had the great privilege of determining\nthe fate of the people and founding the Jewish state, had been\nlost."  Rabin added, "We must stop dreaming of settlements [i.e. in\nthe Territories] and focus on qualitative and substantive changes\nin Israeli society to make it a productive society dependent on its\nown labor." The Prime Minister concluded saying that he would like\nto achieve a significant breakthrough in the peace process during\nhis government's term.
Radiating from someone who is incapable of providing a single scholarly\nsource on his 'genocide apology program', it is rather amusing. Again,\nwhere is your non-existent list of scholars and scholarly sources?\nHere is mine:\n\n"An appropriate analogy with the Jewish Holocaust might be the\n systematic extermination of the entire Muslim population of \n the independent republic of Armenia which consisted of at \n least 30-40 percent of the population of that republic. The \n memoirs of an Armenian army officer who participated in and \n eye-witnessed these atrocities was published in the U.S. in\n 1926 with the title 'Men Are Like That.' Other references abound."\n     (Rachel A. Bortnick - The Jewish Times - June 21, 1990)\n\n\n "In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists a single Turkish soul.\n  It is in our power to tear away the veil of illusion that some of us\n  create for ourselves. It certainly is possible to severe the artificial\n  life-support system of an imagined 'ethnic purity' that some of us\n  falsely trust as the only structure that can support their heart beats \n  in this alien land."\n            (Sahak Melkonian - 1920 - "Preserving the Armenian purity") \n\n\n "The crime of systematic cleansing by mass killing and extermination \n  of the Muslim population in Soviet Republic of Armenia, Karabag, \n  Bosnia and Herzegovina is an 'Islamic Holocaust' comparable to the \n  extermination of 2.5 million Muslims by the Armenian Government \n  during the WWI and of over 6 million European Jews during the WWII."\n                  (Tovfik Kasimov - Azeri Leader - September 25, 1992)\n                 \n\n "Today's ethnic cleansing policies by the Serbian dictatorship against\n  Croatians and Muslims of Yugoslavia, as well as the Soviet Republic\n  of Armenia's against the Muslim population of neighboring Azerbaijan,\n  are really no different in their aspirations than the genocide \n  perpetrated by the Armenian Government 78 years ago against the\n  Turkish and Kurdish Muslims and Sephardic Jews living in these\n  lands."

From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>\nSubject: Labour's enclaves policy.IMPORTANT\n\n\nLabour's enclaves policy in the occupied territories\n\nby Israel Shahak\npubl. in Middle East International, London, 30.4.93\n\nIt is not difficult to discover Israel's policy towards the \nPalestinians at any given time. It can be easily inferred \nfrom the facts on the ground and from the information \nprovided by the Hebrew press. There is one condition, \nthough. The torrents of claptrap about "the peace \nprocess" must be totally ignored, as must Israel's official \npronouncements, whole sole purpose is to distort reality. \nBy concentrating only on the facts, it was early apparent \nthat Labour's policies were no different from those of \nShamir but for their greater reliance on deceit and their \nmore effective implementation.\n\nLikud's policies were accurately described by Ariel \nSharon in an article, accompanied by a map, in Yediot \nAharonot last August. The Sharon plan envisaged a \ndivision of the West Bank into seven, and the Gaza Strip \ninto four, "autonomous" Palestinian enclaves, all of them \nunder Israeli supervision. The total area of these \nenclaves amounted to about 15 per cent of the \nterritories. The rest was to be controlled by the Israeli \nsettlements and the highways built around the enclaves. \nThe entire area around Jerusalem, from the outskirts of \nRamallah to the boundaries of Bethlehem, has already \nbeen turned into a "Greater Jerusalem" where the Arab-\ninhabited localities amount to small enclaves surrounded \nby areas occupied by Israeli settlements or reserved for \nthem.\n\nJudging from Labour's settlement policy, it may be \nassumed that it may content itself with a lesser number \nof Arab enclaves of a rather larger size than Sharon had \nplanned. But the principle of surrounding the enclaves by \nsettlements strategically dispersed along the highways \nremains unchanged. Labour plans only four enclaves in \nthe West Bank: two in "Samaria" and two in "Judea" (i.e. \nnorth and south of Jerusalem respectively), and no more \nthan two in the Gaza Strip. In regard to "Greater \nJerusalem", Labour's policies hardly deviate from \nSharon's.\n\nA saner version of Likud policy\n\nAs some Israeli correspondents at once realised, Labour \npolicies were but a saner version of Sharon's \nextravaganza. Last July, Gideon Eshet wrote in Yediot \nAharonot that, while "barely a few months ago" Labour \nsupported the demand to freeze all construction beyond \nthe Green Line, "no specific decision to freeze \nconstruction in the territories has been taken". And Uzi \nBenziman wrote in Ha'aretz that "as far as can be judged \non the basis of the internal political discussions in \nJerusalem, Rabin intends to stick to Likud's ways".\n\nThe two biggest enclaves envisaged by Labour are \nlocated in "Samaria". Therefore the belt of settlements \naround the "Trans-Samaria Highway", designed to \nseparate those enclaves from each other, is of paramount \nimportance. According to the latest data, the percentage \nof Israeli settlers in the entire West Bank population \n(apart from East Jerusalem) is a mere 5.5 per cent. But \nfor the area around the "Trans-Samaria Highway", the \ncorresponding figure is almost 20 per cent, and it is \nincreasing steadily. The situation in the settlements of \nthe "Efrat Block" south of Jerusalem, designed to sever \nthe enclave around Bethlehem from the one around \nHebron, is pretty much the same. The "Efrat Block" is now \nbeing connected with West Jerusalem by a highway.\n\nThe project is costly in the extreme, because the highway \nis designed to bypass Bethlehem by a sequence of long \ntunnels. The final decision to build this highway was \nsuspended until Rabin's return from his US visit in \nMarch. The subsequent decision to renew its construction \ncan be seen as US approval for the enclaves plan as a \nwhole.\n\nProcess of impoverishment\n\nThe enclaves plan implies deliberate and steady \nimpoverishment of the Palestinians. This is well known \nin Israel but ignored abroad by all who should be \nconcerned, including the PLO. In regard to the Gaza Strip, \nthe whole process was best described by Ze'ev Shiff in \nHa'aretz in March. He mentions having seen "a pamphlet \nissued six years ago by the Civil Administration \nforecasting the conditions in the Gaza Strip under Israeli \nrule in 2000". His analysis deserves to be quoted \nextensively:\n\n"We continue to steal the Strip's water, even though its \nquality deteriorates from year to year. We continue to \nsteal the Strip's tiny land resources, in order to found \nthere more and more settlements, as if we deliberately \nwant to make the inhabitants despair, and in their \ndespair think in termws of having nothing to lose. It is \nby our own doing that the Strip's workers must now \nspend travelling to their workplaces almost as much time \nas they spend working. From the military point of view, \nwe have kept control of no more than half the Strip's \narea at an increasingly exorbitant price in manpower and \nresources. About a year before Moshe Arens left the \ndefence ministry, I heard him saying that we should \nwithdraw from the Strip come what may. His argument \nwas that Israel sinks into the Strip ever deeper and \ndeeper. He told me he had proposed this to Yitzhak \nShamir but he rejected it." Yitzhak Rabin rejects it too.\n\nEnormous state support for the Qatif Block settlers can \nalso be cited as proof that the enclaves plan is being \nimplemented. The Qatif Block settlements, founded by \nthe first Rabin government of 1974-77, are intended to \ndivide the Gaza Strip into two separate enclaves. Efraim \nDavidi of Davar had data showing how vital for Israeli \nthis enterprise is. "The Qatif Block is now producing 40 \nper cent of Israeli tomatoes destined for export, and a \nsubstantial proportion of cut flowers." He also deals with \nthe subsidies the settlers receive, considerably \naugmented by the present government. Owing to them, \nhousing units are cheap. The present government does \nnot spare efforts to recruit new settlers to the block. \n"Any prospective settler will get a 95 per cent mortgage \nfor his house on top of a grant of 18,000 shekels \n($6,500)."\n\nSuch data shows that Israel's plans apply whether the \nPalestinians of the Gaza Strip are allowed or forbidden to \nwork in Israel. The economic motivations were explained \nby Danny Rubinstein in Ha'aretz in March:\n\n"From the economic viewpoint Gaza could already be \nsealed off hermetically and all the Strip's workers could \nbe barred from entering Israel...Even though accurate \ndata is hard to come by, it is indisputable that during the \nlast two years the numbes of Gazan workers arriving \ndaily to work in Israel has markedly decreased, from \n80,000 in the mid'80s to 40,000 today. But the decrease \nis not only due to restrictions imposed on entering Israel \nfrom Gaza. It is also due to the drastic curtailment of \ndemand for Gazan labour in Israel. With unemployment \nin Israel soaring and the construction of apartments \nblocks virtually halted, the workers from Gaza are no \nlonger really needed..."\n\nGaza's total dependence\n\nThe entire economy of the Gaza Strip is totally dependent \non Israel. In recent years in the Gaza Strip there has \nbeen an increase in sub-contracted work for Israeli \nfactories, mostly footware and textiles. Thousands of \nsmall workshops, employing an average of four workers, \nget their raw materials or unfinished products, together \nwith detailed working instructions, from Israeli factories. \nRubinstein attributes this development to the fact that \n"the average wage in the Gaza Strip is merely 40 per cent \nof that in the West Bank, which in turn stands at half the \naverage wage in Israel; and besides the Gazan employer \ndoes not pay any social security for his employees." If \nthe average wage in the Gaza Strip is just a fifth of that \nin Israel, the profits of Israeli factories and even of \nPalestinian sub-contractors must be vast.\n\nThey are higher still when "a Gazan sub-contractor \nprovides labour to be performed at home, with the \nfamily's help. The livelihood of tens of thousands of \nGazans depends on such sub-contracted work." Many of \nthem are women and children, paid about ten shekels \n($3.50) a day which can last 12 hours or more. There can \nbe no doubt that profits from exploiting cheap Gazan \nlabour are one of the reasons for the stubborn opposition \nof Rabin and other Israeli ministers to withdrawal from \nthe Strip.\n\nEconomic conditions in the Gaza Strip differ little from \nwhat was created straight after Israel's conquest [in \n1967]. In this respect, one should not be deluded by the \ntalk, nowadays fashionable, about Israeli gestures \nintended to "encourage economic development in the \nterritories", As Israeli journalists point out, all permits \nfor opening new businesses depend on a prior approval \nby the Shin Bet. "Behind all the professed goodwill there \nis no desire to solve problems, just the attitude of a good \ncolonialist, willing to do something for the benefit of the \nnatives, but on condition that they behave nicely, do not \nbecome rebellious, and never do anything against the \ninterests of the metropolis, its economic interests \nincluded," wrote Michal Sela in Davar in February. The \ndevelopment of sub-contracted work in the Gaza Strip \naccords perfectly with Sela's diagnosis.\n\nSela also shows how exactly the economic controls work. \n"In all branches of the economy, lobbies have been set in \nmotion for purposes of freeing Israeli production from \nthe threat of any Palestinian competition. The method is \nsimplicity itself. As soon as any Israeli producer succeeds \nin persuading the government, or even the trade and \nindustry minister alone, a military order is issued \nprohibiting the export of a given produce to Israel. If this \ndoes not suffice, a Palestinian factory may be denied a \nlicence to operate or bureaucratic obstacles may paralyse \nits production." Among the most active of such lobbies is \nthe agricultural one. It has succeeded in limiting exports \nof Gazan vegetables (except for those grown by settlers) \nnot only to Israel but also to Europe, where they \notherwise might compete with Israeli exports.\n\nPerpetuaring apartheid\n\nLabour's goal is to perpetuate this apartheid regime in \nthe territories. The same goal is shared by the US, which \notherwise could not support the Labour government so \nfirmly. In my view one of the reasons the US feels \nhappier about supporting Labour than Likud is its \ngreater efficiency in pursuing the settlement drive. This \npoint was brought home by Ofer Shelah in Ma'ariv, who \ndeplored the settlers' failure which he attributed to \nLikud's inefficiency. he showed that the peak yearly \nsettlement growth "occured during the term of office of \nthe National Unity government (i.e. 1984-90) in which \nRabin served throughout as the defence minister". \nLikud's reputation for settling the territories better than \nLabour is false, attributable to the many tiny settlements \nwithout strategic value founded under Shamir for \nsymbolic reasons.\n\nTo sum up: Labour's policy, unconditionally supported by \nthe US differs from that of Likud primarily in the \nefficiency with which it is implemented. According to \nthat policy the territories are to be divided into two \nparts. The major part is to be ruled by Israel directly, \nand the minor part indirectly. In my view, this racist \nscheme is doomed to ultimately fail, but at a horrifying \nprice in human suffering. The sooner its true nature is \nrecognised, the less suffering it may cause.
I'll leave questions 1 and 2 to be answered elsewhere, but on question 3)\nsomething in the noos today might be an example of the restoration might be.\nNamely, that the Clinton Administration is considering asking the UN to \nestablish a police force for Haiti.\n\nI didn't hear any thing that said that the current Govt. of Haiti asked for it,\nnor is there any real precedent (barring Somalia) for the UN getting involved\nin internal conflicts.\n\nThat might also answer question 2). The neo-colonial countries are a diffuse\nlot - the UN (Security Council).\n\nAnd while I am at it, I'll take a stab at 1) - the new colonialism, as defined in\nmost articles I have read, would entail something of the nature of Trusteeship\nunder the UN Sec. Council, democracy, aid, education, free-markets, free press\nand then out for the colonialists, now assured that there is a "civilized" \ncountry that they have left behind.\n\nNote I don't support this idealized concept, simply because I think it is a\nlot of hogwash.\n\n-- \nSrinivas Sunder                                         sunder@crhc.uiuc.edu\n\nIf The University of Illinois shares these views, I'd be surprised.\nThey aren't that smart generally -:).
My recollection of History/Documentary books is slitely different.\nIt is my understanding that Croats were allies of Germany during\nWWII, while Serbs had sided with Russia.  As a result Serbs did\ntake a beating from Croats (NOT Bosnian Moslems) while Germany\nhad the upper hand.\n\nEven today, Russians consider/call Serbs as their Slovac brothers.\nThis is one of the issues involved in the U.N.'s lack of active\nintervention against Serbs.\n\nAs for the Bosnian Moslems, I have not heard of any alliance with\nGermany or Russia in recent history.  Therefore, I am curious\nif they did or were able to treat other parties in this conflict\nwith same brutallity (as they are getting it today) in the past\nhistory.
Muslims helping the Nazis???  Where on earth do you come up with such\naccuusation??  Do you have proofs??  If not, you should publically apologize\nfor such a statement.  Last time I heard, the nazis prided themselves in\nneeding no body to carry their politics and ideologies.  And if your statment\nwere true, don't you think Israel would of used it to point to what a Muslim\nneighbor (PALESTINE) could do to them if they allowed it to be?  The jewish\nlobby and power is very strong, and if what you said is true, we would of\nheard it from them before you could come up with it.\nAnd you dare say that you are taking no sides!!

Alberto, you've repeatedly misunderstood my postings.  You are now making the exact point\nthat I've made several times but with a different definition of religion.  You don't not\nhave to believe in the "religious" aspects of Judaism to be a Jew (this would confine\nJudaism to be just a religion in the sense of a Christianity.).  So, by converting out of\nJudaism, I don't mean just not believing in the god of Judaism.  I mean voluntarily\nremoving yourself from the Jewish nation.  I am an agnostic but still consider myself\nJewish because of my cultural heritage.  (I admit that many religious jews would argue\nthat I am not completely jewish because of my lack of faith, but Judaism is a religion of\ndissent and debate isn't it?).  The fact that one can opt to become Jewish simply by\nconverting to Judaism makes the nation of the jewish people the *least* racist and most\nopen nation.  We have no quotas!\n\nSo I will once again make my point.  Defining a member of the Jewish nation by religion\n(not, as you say, religious belief) is NOT racism.  You come to your incorrect conclusion\nbecause you use a different definition for religion when you define the law of return and\nwhen you define judaism.
I want to subscribe, I am located in Israel and my name is David Gotlieb
Which was my point. By converting to another religion I do not loose\nmy cultural identity, I just loose my religious identification.\nI consider that defining the belonging to a nation that claims the \nright to have a State based on religious belief is a form of racism.\n\n\nTo be a part or not of the Jeish Nation is defined by my culture and not\nby my religion. Actually, if I am an atheist, which is in fact like \nconverting into a non-Jewish in terms of religion, I am still considered as\npart of the Jewish Nation.\nI can be proud of my Jewish culture while not giving any importance to the\nJewish religion. Or, even more, I can be proud of my Jewish culture while\nstill be convinced that the real god is another one.\nI do not know anyone who lost his memebership to the American nation \nbecause he changed of god.\n\nI still believe that we should never confusse the actions of States with\nthe individuals who happen to live there.\nIn the same way that I do not think it is right to blame all Israelis for the\nhuman rights violations of Israel, I do not think that we should assume\nthat all Arabs are guilty of the actions of the Arab States.\nSome people fled their homes because they were scared. Now they are in\nthere, still suffering for what they are not responsible.\nAnd, remember that we also were told the same at some point. We ended in\nthe diaspora. And, of course, I am not for doing to others what I did not\nwant done to me.
It is 'Serdar', 'kocaoglan'.\n\n\nJust say so.\n\n The SUNDAY TIMES 8 March 1992\n Morgues fill as Azeris head for all-out war\n -------------------------------------------\n Thomas Goltz, the first to report the massacre by Armenian soldiers in\n the worst violence since the breakup of the Soviet Union, reports from\n Agdam\n ------\n Khojaly used to be a barren town, with empty shops and treeless dirt\n roads. Yet it was still home to thousands of people who, in happier\n times, tended fields and flocks of geese. Last week it was wiped off\n the map.\n .......\n As sickening reports trickled in to the Azerbaijani border town of\n Agdam, and the bodies piled up in the morgues, there was little doubt\n that Khojaly and the stark foothills and gullies around it had been\n the site of the most terrible massacre since the Soviet Union broke\n apart.\n .......\n I was the last Westerner to visit Khojaly. That was in january and\n people were predicting their fate with grim resignation. Zumrut Ezoya,\n a mother of four on board the helicopter that ferried us into the\n town, called her community "sitting ducks, ready to get shot". She and\n her family were among the victims of the massacre on February 26.\n .......\n "The Armenians have taken all the outlying villages, one by one, and\n the government does nothing." Balakisi Sakikov, 55, a father of five,\n said. "Next they will drive us out or kill us all," said Dilbar, his\n wife. The couple, their three sons and three daughters were killed in\n the assault, as were many other people I had spoken to.\n ......\n "It was close to the Armenian lines we knew we would have to cross.\n There was a road, and the first units of the column ran across then\n all hell broke loose. Bullets were raining down from all sides. we had\n just entered their trap."\n The azeri defenders picked off one by one. Survivors say that Armenian\n forces then began a pitiless slaughter, firing at anything moved in\n the gullies. A video taken by an azeri cameraman, wailing and crying\n as he filmed body after body, showed a grizzly trail of death leading\n towards higher, forested ground where the villagers had sought refuge\n from the Armenians.\n "The Armenians just shot and shot and shot," said Omar Veyselov, lying\n in hospital in Agdam with sharapnel wounds. "I saw my wife and\n daughter fall right by me."\n People wandered through the hospital corridors looking for news of the\n loved ones. Some vented their fury on foreigners: " Where is my\n daughter, where is my son ?" wailed a mother. "Raped. Butchered. Lost."\n Azerbaijan has said as many as 1,000 refugees were killed as they\n tried to flee. The Armenians have denied this, saying the civilians\n were caught in "crossfire".\n .......\n\n\nAre you idiot for real?\n\n     'After all, who remembers today the extermination of the Tartars?'\n      (Adolf Hitler, August 22, 1939: Ruth W.

You don't get it - do you? During the years of World War I, the x-Soviet \nArmenian Government has planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the \nMuslim people, which not only took the lives of 2.5 million Muslim people, \nbut was also the method used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants. \nTo this day, Turkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. \nIn order to cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish \nhomeland, which is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet \nArmenia continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:\n\n1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide\nin order to shift international public opinion away from its political\nresponsibility.\n\n2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism \nTriangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish \nGenocide.\n\n3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through\nthe ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to \nsilence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.\n\n4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet\nArmenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through\nterrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters\nof the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.\n\nUsing all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government \nis attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from\nmaking the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.\n\nYet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its \nterrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks \nto the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically \nexterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on \nthis issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of \ngovernments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition \nof the Turkish Genocide.\n\nWith the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorial\ndemands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish people\nwill unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victims\nof the Turkish Genocide demand:\n\n1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian \nDictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;\n\n2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and\nKurdish people;\n\n3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for \ntheir heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;\n\n4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officially\nrecognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse\nto succumb to all Armenian political pressure;\n\n5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it \nhas adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially \nrecognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be \nsupportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands;\n\n6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact \nof the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of \n2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.\n\n\nSerdar Argic

This is one of the most ridiculous arguments I have heard from the \nEuropeans. "Let's let the Serbs massacre, rape, and ethnically clean\n100,000 Bosnians because we don't want our pretty blue berets there\nto get scratched".  Well, I say, get them the hell out of there if you're\nworried for them, but don't deny Bosnians their basic right to self\ndefense! Lift the embargo against Bosnia, and let them defend themselves.\nWhat makes the UN troops more valuable than the Bosnian people?  They\nare letting the civilians die so the soldiers could survive, when\nif anything, it should be the other way around.  Idiots like Owen \nexpect Bosnians to swallow a forced plan, and just hope this problem\nwill go away.  Well they're wrong.  If they had got their butts in gear\n(that is, if Bosnia had oil) a year ago, much of this could be prevented.\nNow, however, the results of this tragedy will last for generations.\nThat's like forcing the jews to make peace with Hitler. Yeah right.\nThis, as senator Biden said, reeks of bigotry, and makes me and any \ndecent human being for that matter, quite sick.  It should be the\nEuropeans, not the Americans, who take the inititiative and ask the\nother for support.

Not to mention \nEuropean muslims who weren't even practicing before will rally to\nfundamentalism. Good luck handling that, your majesty!  Owen was\nupset at the question which compared him to Chamberlain, who hoped\nto appease Hitler.  He said that Chamberlain had been in Munich 2 years\nbefore any war, I have been here during a blazing war for the last\n18 months.  Well, that makes him even worse, because Chamberlain could\nhave at least argued I'm giving Germany the benefit of the doubt,\nwhereas Owen can't even do that.  What the west is doing is aiding the\nSerbs by tying the Bosnians' hands, and making the stupid excuse of their\npowerless troops on the ground, who can't even protect the Bosnian foreign\nminister in their own armored vehicle, and watch the killers just walk\naway!  What kind of peace is this?  What kind of civilization is this?\n\n\nEuropean leaders are PATHETIC, and are helping a genocide which even they\nwill not be able to forget.  Yeah, they'll go to Africa and fight for some\ndamn dictator in their former colony, they'll go to Kuwait and fight for\noil, but in Bosnia not only they won't fight aggression, they'll even\ntie the hands of the victim.  Now you tell me who is fooling whom.

The estimated population\n of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were\n Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.\n Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third\n of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the \n Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan\n uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians\n as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,\n however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the\n guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000\n inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character \n notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian \n Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the \n southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia." \n (See also Map 1.

I do not want to convince anyone. This is just USENET, not the real\nworld. I just read the opinions others have about a subject, and sometimes\nI present my opinion. I think that this net is only useful to exchange\nideas. I never wanted nor I want now to convince anyone of anything.\n\n\n\nFirst, and I repeat it, I never said that the idea of Jews having the\nright to have a State is racist.\nZionism, as a movement, is more than just that idea. I think that Zionism\nin the way it defines who is a Jew, for example, is racist-like.\nIn the same way I believe that Irish have a right to nationalism but I do\nnot support the bombing and killing of the IRA, I believe that Jews have\na right to nationalism but I do not support Zionism as it is right now.\n\n\nThat is what makes the basis for Zionist movements. However, I am not \nconsidering just that, but the rest of it. \n\n\nWhich makes an interesting point. People living in a Jewish State have\nshown that Jewish culture includes in it Jewish religion but they are\nnot the same. So, the Jewish people living in the Jewish State have shown \nus that there are some problems in a State where 80% of the people is secular\nbut Judaism is define according to religious standards, or where marriage\nis a religious stage, or where the Law of Return defines a Jew according to\na religious standard.\nDid those Israelis who do not believe in god and will never do become \nnon-Jews? Why should they still define then a Jew based on what is a \nreligious definition?\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary, Merriam-Webster Inc,\nPublishers, Springfield, Massachusetts, U.S.A., 1986, page 593, \n\nhy-poc-ri-sy: A feigning to be what one is nnot or to believe one does not.\n\nSo, saying that one believes in Zionism as a simple matter of people \nhaving the right to nationalism, but disregarding the right of the Palestinian\npeople to do the same, according to this dictionary, is hypocrisy.\n\n\n\nI know what my words mean. I do stand by what I said I believe: Zionism is\na form of racism. Of course, I tend to talk about things as they are and\nnot as they are defined in a broad sense.
It looks like Ben Baz's mind and heart are also blind, not only his eyes.\nI used to respect him, today I lost the minimal amount of respect that\nI struggled to keep for him.\nTo All Muslim netters: This is the same guy who gave a "Fatwah" that\nSaudi Arabia can be used by the United Ststes to attack Iraq . That\nFatwah is as legitimate as this one. With that kind of "Clergy", it might\nbe an Islamic duty to separate religion and politics, if religion\nmeans "official Clergy".
Nobody ever produced the meagerest evidence for this.  It does not\nappear in several long published accounts by Irgun participants.\nEven some Irgun propagandists do not make this claim.\n\n\nSeveral members of the Irgun attacking party, including the leader,\ndeposited personal declarations in the Irgun archives (Jabotinsky\nInstitute, Tel-Aviv) which state that the Lehi proposed to "liquidate\nthe village after the conquest".  It seems the Begin overruled\nthis plan, however the willingness of many of the attackers to\nseriously consider this possibility serves as instructive\ncharacter evidence.\n\n\nThe Haganah tried to get the Irgun to attack a village with\nreal military significance, but it was considered too hard.  \nThe soft target of Deir Yassin was chosen instead.\n\n\nThere was intention (probably originating with Begin) to give such\na warning but the loudspeaker truck got stuck in a ditch before\nreaching the village.  Everyone knows that.\n\n\nBy all rational standards, you should be posting from b-cpu.\n\n\nA lie repeated is still a lie.

Shaw, 'The Jews of the Ottoman Empire and the\n        Turkish Republic,' New York University Press, New York (1991).\n\n pages 202-203:\n\n  <<In 1865, immediately after enactment of the new Organic Statute for the\n  Jewish community, and just as Jewish capital from Europe was beginning\n  to have an effect in Istanbul, local Armenians and Greeks started a pogrom\n  against Jews immediately across the sea of Marmara at Haydarpasa, terminus\n  of the Anatolia railroad, with three hundred Jews massacred and many more\n  beaten and raped before the disturbance was stopped after the Sultan sent\n  his personal guard across the bay to protect the Jews [39].\n\n  In later years, ritual murder attacks against Jews, carried out mostly\n  by native Greeks, Armenians, and, in Arab provinces, by Maronites and\n  other Arab Christians, often with the assistance of the local European\n  consuls, took place throughout the empire. There were literally thousands\n  of incidents continuously until World War I, in Southeastern Europe as far\n  west and north as Monastir and Kavalla, in Istanbul, at Gallipoli and\n  the Dardanelles, at Salonica, and in all the Arab provinces as far south\n  as Damascus and Beirut and in Egypt at Cairo and Alexandria. These\n  invariably resulted from accusations spread among Ottoman Christians\n  by word of mouth, or published in their newspapers, often by Christian\n  financiers and merchants anxious to get their Jewish competitors out of\n  the way or to divert onto the Jews Muslim anger at reports of Christian\n  massacres of Muslims in Southeastern Europe or Central Asia, resulting\n  in individual and mob attacks on Jews, and the burning of their shops\n  and homes.\n\n  Individual experiences were horrible. Jews constantly went in fear of\n  Armenian or Greek attacks in the streets of Ottoman cities. In Egypt\n  and Syria, it was usually the Greeks who led the way, in many cases\n  with the assistance of local Armenians and Syrian Christians, whose\n  Greek, Arabic and French-language newspapers often printed all the\n  rumors they could find regarding Jews, evidently with the desire of\n  instigating violence. The Syrian Arab Christians in particular spread\n  their long-standing anti-Semitic hatreds from Syria to Egypt, where\n  their monopoly of the local press and their espousal of popular causes\n  such as Egyptian nationalism and opposition to the British rule, enabled\n  them to spread their anti-Jewish message among the Muslim masses with\n  little question or opposition.\n\n  On 20 June 1890, thus, Sir Evelyn Baring (later Lord Cromer), British\n  High Commissioner in Egypt, received the following report from David\n  and Nissim Ades, in Cairo:\n\n    ''Sir,\n\n      I beg sir to draw to your attention to the violent articles which\n      has (sic) appeared in an Arabic paper called El Mahroussa which\n      contained nothing but lies and false accusations against the Jews,\n      especially those (the issues) of the 14th, 17th and 19th instant.\n      Now, Sir, are we to have here an anti-Semitic party amidst fanaticism,\n      Greeks, Armenians, etc., or is he to be allowed to continue to poison\n      the people's minds with exaggeration and painted words? In an article,\n      he asserted that the Jews use Christian blood for Passover, of course\n      this has caused a deal of excitement.'' [40]\n\n  Whenever Greek and other Orthodox religious authorities or prominent\n  Greek business leaders or consuls were asked to help to stem the violence\n  or reduce tension, they invariably indicated their cooperation and then\n  failed to do anything to prevent attacks or punish those who stimulated\n  or led them.

Actually, the record of the Allies activities, in the face of\nincontrovertible evidence as to what the Nazis (may they rot in hell)\nwere doing, clearly points to the conclusion that they would have done\nnothing.  The railways to the camps were not bombed, despite the ease\nof doing so.  The US, the "place of refuge" allowed in a bare pittance\nof Jews from Europe, primarily for public relations, so that the\ngovernment could say it was "doing something".  Many ships with\nrefugees were turned away from US shores; some found refuge in Cuba or\nSouth America, many others sunk or had to return to Europe (with\npredictable consequences).  The hope today is that we have\ncollectively learned a lesson, and are less complacent to ignore other\ncountries' "internal affairs".  The sad reality is that this does not\nseem to be the case.

This was the age of\n  nationalism among the Christian subjects of the Sultan, starting with\n  the Greek Revolution early in the nineteenth century, which, based on\n  the Megali Idea, or Great Idea, sought to add to Greek kingdom Istanbul\n  and large portions of Anatolia, union of which with Greece was felt to be\n  the 'dream and hope of all'. The success of the Greek national movement,\n  provided more in fact by the intervention of the Great Powers than by the\n  efforts of the Greeks themselves, stimulated similar uprisings among the\n  other subjects in Southeastern Europe who had long been oppressed, not so\n  much by the Ottomans but, rather, by the Greek religious hierarchy which\n  dominated the Orthodox millet, leading first to pressure for religious\n  independence, granted to the Bulgarian Orthodox Exarchate in 1870, to the\n  Serbian Church in 1879, and to the Rumanian Church in 1885, with subsequent\n  aspirations for, and achievement of, political independence following...>>\n\n  page 188:\n\n  <<...They [new nationalist leaders] were greatly assisted in their\n   campaigns against the Ottomans both by the diplomatic and consular\n   representatives of the major Powers of Europe and also by Christian\n   missionaries, who emphasized feelings of Christian superiority and\n   hatred for Muslims and Jews which fortified the religious as well as\n   ethnic bases of their pursuit of independence.\n\n   Christian nationalism, based as much on religious as on ethnic identity,\n   soon resurrected the medieval bigotries which had devastated both Jews\n   and Muslims and consequently had driven them together in the past.\n   Vicious anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic movements developed, involving\n   large-scale persecutions and massacres carried out by invading armies,\n   by the independent states that resulted, also by Christian subjects\n   who remained within the Empire, particularly because of Jewish and Muslim\n   support for Ottoman integrity in fear of their fate in the emergent\n   nationalist states of Southeastern Europe. The results were explosive\n   and damaging.\n\n   The invading armies of Russia and Austria as well as the revolting\n   nationalists and, later, successfully established independent Christian\n   states, committed systematic genocide against Jews and Muslims throughout\n   the nineteenth century, despite Great Power admonitions to the contrary\n   in the treaties of Paris (1858) and Berlin (1878),...>>\n\n  page 188:\n\n  <<...As the peoples of Southeastern Europe achieved their independence,\n   their Muslim and Jewish minorities were systematically persecuted and\n   massacred, and those who survived were driven beyond the ever-shrinking\n   boundaries of the retreating Ottoman Empire in a kind of slaughter which\n   had not been seen since the dispersal of the Jews from Palestine centuries\n   earlier.\n\n   This sort of genocide had begun as long before as the late sixteenth\n   century, with the Rumanian Principalities taking the lead, as united\n   Rumania did subsequently during the later years of the nineteenth\n   century. In 1579 the ruler of Moldavia, Peter the Lame, banished its\n   Jews because of their competition with its Christian merchants. When\n   Prince Micheal the Brave revolted against the Ottomans in the Rumanian\n   principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia in 1593, he ordered the massacre\n   of all the Jews as well as Turks in Bucharest.>>\n\n  page 189:\n\n  <<The slaughter continued well into the nineteenth century.

When the Greek nationalist\n   movement Philike Etairia started its uprising in Wallachia and Moldavia\n   during the spring of 1821, hundreds of Jews and Muslims were killed by\n   the Greeks who lived there as well as by native Wallachs [14]. During\n   the height of the Greek revolution, five thousand Jews were massacred\n   in Morea along with most of the Muslim population, numbering about\n   twenty thousand in all [15]. In Tripolizza alone 1,200 Jews were\n   massacred along with uncounted Turks [16].  Reverend John Hartley,\n   after describing the carnage, concluded 'Thus did Jewish blood, mingled\n   with Turkish, flow down the streets of captured city. The sons of Isaac\n   and the sons of Ishmael, on this as well as on every occasion during the\n   Greek Revolution, met with common fate. Their corpses were cast out of the\n   city, and, like the ancient sovereign of Judah, they received no burial\n   superior to that of an ass.' [17] Jewish communities on the islands of\n   Sparta, Patras, Corinthos, Mistra, and Argos were wiped out by bands of\n   Greek rebels along with those of Thebes, Vrachori, Attica and Epirus [18].\n   The surviving Jews fled to the island of Corfu, where Jews who had fled\n   from Italy, and the Iberian Peninsula had lived in peace and prosperity\n   under the Venetian rule since the twelfth century, though divided into\n   rival Greek and Italian communities. It was not long, however, before\n   it too fell victim to the Greek Revolution, leading to savage repression\n   and massacres of Jews, forcing the surviving members of the two communities\n   to come together for self-defense for the first time. Throughout the years\n   of Greek revolution, Greek nationalists went from town to town on the\n   mainland and from island to island in the Agean, exterminating all the\n   Jews and Muslims they could find, many along the roads as they desperately\n   fled to safety in what was left of the Ottoman Empire. Contemporary\n   accounts relate that the Greeks left the murdered Jews and Muslims lying\n   exposed so their bodies could be torn apart by the buzzards [19]. Most of\n   the Jews who survived these massacres fled across the Agean in small boats\n   to Izmir, thus starting its rise as one of the leading centers of Ottoman\n   Jewish life during the nineteenth century. Only in Northern Greece,\n   particularly in the areas of Janina and Salonica, were the Jews and the\n   Turks able to successfully resist the Greek assaults, thus saving their\n   populations from massacre as well [20]. During the remainder of the 19th\n   century, particularly during the Greek-Turkish war in 1897, those Jews\n   who remained in Greece in the areas of Athens, Chalkis, Larissa, Corfu\n   and Crete suffered severe persecution and massacre, forcing thousands\n   more to emigrate into Ottoman territory, particularly to Salonica and\n   Izmir [21].>>\n\n   page 193 (last paragraph):\n\n   <<The inclusion in the Treaty of Berlin of stipulations providing\n   protection for the Jewish and Muslim minorities in Southeastern Europe\n   stimulated more popular anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim hysteria in all\n   the countries involved, with blood-libel accusations once again being\n   used as pretexts for attacking and ravaging Jewish quarters as well as\n   for new tactics for boycotting Jewish shopkeepers, merchants and\n   professionals, a movement which was quickly adapted by the Christian\n   millets in the major cities of the Ottoman Empire. Because the Bulgarians,\n   Rumanians and Greeks correctly regarded the Jews as supporters of the\n   Turks, both Jews and Turks were expelled from these countries in equally\n   atrocious and brutal manners. Their property was plundered and their\n   homes and shops taken over without compensation, while the survivors\n   fled in desperation to Edirne and Istanbul. While official statements\n   subsequently were issued granting equal rights to Jews, little was done\n   in fact and they continued to be persecuted regularly well into the\n   twentieth century.>>\n\n  page 194 (last paragraph):\n\n  <<Things were not much better elsewhere in Southeastern Europe or the\n   Greek islands of the Agean and the eastern Mediterranean. In 1891 the\n   Jews on Corfu were subjected to severe persecution by local Greeks due\n   to the revival of the old ritual murder accusations [26]. Many of\n   those who survived found refuge in Ottoman territory with the help of a\n   popular subscription drive carried out in Istanbul under leadership of\n   the Banque Camondo. In 1881 and 1884, and again in 1892 and 1903,\n   thousands of Jews came to Ottoman territory as a result of pogroms\n   in Russia which went on between 1881 and 1921 with only slight periods\n   of respite. In 1899 Jewish families arrived in Istanbul in flight from\n   persecution in Vidin, in independent Bulgaria.\n\n   The conquest of Ottoman Thrace and Macedonia by Greek and Bulgarian\n   forces during the Balkan Wars (1912-13), including Salonica, Corlu,\n   and Edirne, was followed by general attacks on Jews, their synagogues,\n   homes and shops, in both countries [27], resulting in a renewed exodus\n   toward Istanbul and beyond. Two reports from Salonica graphically\n   described the situation caused by the invading armies:\n\n      'All the self-interested justifications of the newspapers of Europe,\n      all the lies which they have used to cover up the truth, can never\n      destroy the impression of the terrible anguish which has marked the\n      entry of the Greeks in Salonica.

BIGOTRY"\n\nBiden spoke well.  Then there was John Major, the architect of the\nbetrayal of Bosnian Muslims to genocide.  \n\nHe basically has given yet another green light to HVO Ustashe and\nMladic-Chetnik serial killers, rapists, and plunderers to continue their\ngenocide against Bosnian Muslims.\n\nBut Major met with Mr. Rushdie and said it was "unacceptable" that Iran\nshould have a death decree on him.  While I disagree personally with\nFetwas against hack writers like Rushdie (it only helps them sell more\nbooks), I find it interesting that Mr. Major finds the genocide of two\nmillion Muslims in Bosnia acceptable, but a threat against one single\npopular British writer "unacceptable."
Since Facts and Myths doesn't even know where Deir Yassin was,\nwhy should we pay any attention to the rest of what it says?\n\n\nThis account from Eric Silver is the only valid point that M&F makes.\nYou can find it together with other evidence and analysis in \nSilver's biography of Begin.  Also in Silver's book you will find\ndocumentary evidence that nearly everything else in M&F's account\nis pure bullshit.\n\n\nThis is pretty disgusting.  The Guardian was told of one or two\nfeeble old men who dressed in women's clothing in a pathetic \nattempt to escape death.  See Silver's book.
How quaint of you to point this out, and then to completely ignore\nall of the blatant lies you've trotted out. The scenario and genocide \nstaged by the Armenians 78 years ago in Eastern Anatolia and x-Soviet\nArmenia is being reenacted again - this time in Azerbaijan. There are \nremarkable similarities between the plots, the perpetrators, and the \nunderdogs. \n\nRemember, in article <2BAC262D.25249@news.service.uci.edu>, you have \nblatantly lied and still have not corrected yourself.\n\n\nI'll let the rest of the net judge this on its own merits.\n\nSource: 'The Sunday Times,' 1 March 1992 (a British Weekly, written by \n        Thomas Goltz, from Agdam, Azerbaijan.)\n\n    ARMENIAN SOLDIERS MASSACRE HUNDREDS OF FLEEING FAMILIES.\n\n    The spiralling  violence gripping the  outer republics of  the former\nSoviet Union gained new impetus  yesterday with cold-blooded slaughter of\nhundreds of women and children in war-racked Nagorno-Karabakh.\n    Survivors  reported that  Armenian soldiers  shot and  bayoneted more\nthan 450  Azeris, many of  them women and  children, who were  fleeing an\nattack  on their  town. Hundreds,  possibly thousands,  were missing  and\nfeared dead.\n    The attackers  killed most of  the soldiers and  volunteers defending\nthe women  and children.  They then  turned their  guns on  the terrified\nrefugees. The few  survivors later described what  happened:" That's when\nthe real  slaughter began," said  Azer Hajiev,  one of three  soldiers to\nsurvive. "The  Armenians just shot and  shot. And then they  came in and\nstarted carving up people with their bayonets and knives."\n    " They were shooting, shooting, shooting", echoed Rasia Aslanova, who\narrived in Agdam with other women and children who made their way through\nArmenian lines. She said her husband, Kayun, and a son-in-law were killed\nin front of her. Her daughter was still missing.\n    One boy who arrived in Agdam had an ear sliced off.\n\n    The survivors  said 2000  others, some of  whom had  fled separately,\nwere still missing in the gruelling terrain; many could perish from their\nwounds or the cold.\n    By late  yesterday, 479 deaths had  been registered at the  morgue in\nAgdam's morgue,  and 29 bodies  had been buried  in the cemetery.  Of the\nseven corpses  I saw awaiting  burial, two  were children and  three were\nwomen, one shot through the chest at point blank range.\n    Agdam hospital was  a scene of carnage and terror.  Doctors said they\nhad 140 patients who escaped slaughter, most with bullet injuries or deep\nstab wounds.\n    Nor were they safe in Agdam. On friday night rockets fell on the city\nwhich  has a  population  of 150,000,  destroying  several buildings  and\nkilling one person.\n\nNow wait, there is more.\n\n           IT'S INHUMANE TO IGNORE THIS VIOLENCE\n\nThe stories of survivors of Karabag massacre:\n\n69 year old Hatin Nine telling:\n\n-''My Twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes. They told\nme: We won't kill you. But the babies have to die in front of your eyes.''\n\n72 year old Huseyin Ibrahimoglu:\n\n- ''Our Turkish village in Khojalu Town was blown up in two hours.\n  Turks, you must die.''\n\n28 year old Gulsum Huseyin:\n\n- ''They bayonetted my 3 year old daughter in her stomach in front of\n    my eyes.''\n\nAre these stories lies? Have the eye-witnesses been day-dreaming?\nWere these stories forged by Turkish journalists in the region?\n\nThe nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of British\nJournalists, too. Two days before we had quoted from a Sunday Times\narticle. They[British] reported the events in Karabag even before\nTurkish journalists. What is more here are the pictures. Pictures\nof people who were bayonetted, whose eyes were gouged, ears cut off.\n\nEven the Armenian Radio couldn't claim these "lies." They are saying\n"exaggeration." That means ''somethings'' have happened but the\nsituation is not as bad as reported. Perhaps that village of Khojalu\ntown was destroyed in 4 hours, instead of 2... Or Gulsum Huseyin's\n3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach...\n\nThe massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions. The effects of\nthis massacre on Karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word.\n\nSome of the western press', led by some French Newspapers, ability\nto ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre.\n\nYesterday we gave samples from Le Figaro. Until yesterday's print\nno news about the real events in Karabag were printed. So were the\nFrench TV channels.. The subject they considered related to Karabag\nwas ''The necessity of protecting Armenians against Azeri attacks.''\n\nThe age we are living in is termed a human rights age. There are lots\nof organizations such as United Nations and CSCE(Conference on Security\nand Cooperation in Europe), and rules, all designed to fight against human\nrights violations. International reactions must be made with international\ncooperation. With support of everybody and every organization claiming\nto be civilized.\n\nCould there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the\nright to live -and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty-? Where\nis the cooperation? Where are the reactions? And the intellectuals,\njournalists, writers, TV stations of certain western countries such\nas France who are fast to claim leadership of "human rights?"\nWhere are you?\n\nSerdar Argic

Look up the facts first, post second.  Bernadotte was assassinated\nin September 1948 by Lehi under the orders of its three commanders\n(one of whom was Yitzhak Shamir).  There is no hard evidence of\ncomplicity of the Israeli government despite some effort by the UN\nand other organizations (US intelligence, Swedish government) to\nfind it.  However a great fuss was made over the apparent lack of\nzeal of the Israeli government to track down the killers.  The Lehi\nman who actually pulled the trigger later became a personal friend\nof David Ben-Gurion.  The best published account in English is A. Ilan, \nBernadotte in Palestine, 1948 (Macmillan, 1989).
I too noticed that in all this screaming and shouting, not one \nperson brought up the question of atrocities being commited on non-muslims \nby the Sudanese Government. Could it be that they are Africans and so who\ncares? I suggest that everyone cut the hypocrisy and bleating about Bosnia \nand go on to discuss something even more meaningless.\n\n    The report below shows that the Sudanese are acting in the finest\ntraditions of Islamic law as expounded by some die-hard people on the \nnet (who shall remain nameless). \n\nSudan\n-----\n\nGovernment troops 'steal women, children'\n\n\nWASHINGTON - Government troops in Sudan are involved in massacres,\nkidnapping and the transporting of forced labor into Libya, according\nto a State Department document declassified Wednesday.\n\n    The report compiled by the U.S. embassy in Khartoum said government\nforces, particularly Arab militias organized as the Popular Defense\nForces, "routinely steal women and children" in southern Sudan.
Ilyess sez: \n  >So how would have *you* defended Saudi Arabia and rolled \n  >back the Iraqi invasion, were you in charge of Saudi Arabia??? \n  \n  All Muslims knew that the whole thing was set up to destroy Iraq, not \n  to "Liberate Kuwait", The people who were killed by the invasion are \n  more (many many more), than the ones that were killed by the Iraqis \n  in their smaller invasion. I lived in the west, and I have seen how \n  your media prepared you (helpless naive Americans) for a war against \n                                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ \nNo doubt you plan on exploiting "helpless naive Americans" for your own\npurposes. Hmm...let's see: \n\n  Iraq even before the artificial conflict between Iraq and Kuwait that \n  led to the invasion, as the CIA correctly predicted (and pretended to \n  be surprised not to know). \n  It just happened that Saddam was so predictible and so arrogant and stupid. \n\n  What would I have done: Most Muslims would choose 300 dead Kuwaitis   over \n  200,000 dead Iraqis and 1000 dead Kuwaitis. The first case would happen \n  if no western intervention happened, and the second case was a direct \n  or indirect result of western envolvement. \n\nPossibly, if 200,000 Iraqis had indeed died, but this number is based on\nGreenpeace estimates.  Greenpeace had compromised its alleged\nimpartiality during the war by condemning the potential environmental\nconsequences of Allied miiltary action, while initially *completely*\nignoring Iraq's horrible environmental crimes, starting with the dumping\nof millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf at Ahmadi to the blowing of\nover 700 oil wells.  What is the real number?  There has been a lot of\nwork on this in the last two years, none of it reported as the\nGreenpeace figure seems to get continuously bandied about.  The real\nnumber seems to be around 10,000, on the same order as the number of\nKuwaitis killed, tortured and kidnapped during the occupation.  I've\nincluded an article I recently posted below, but this is really old\nnews.  Independent Television News reported a figure around 15,000 only\na few months after the war, but it was hardly reported. \n\nFor the Allies to have killed 200,000 Iraqis, they would have had to\nkill twice the *total* number of Iraqis in Kuwait. \n\nThe favored image of the hysterics is the last battle of the war at\nMutla'.  This was yet another example of the American and European media\nplaying into the hands of Iraq and its de facto allies.     The\ndestruction of the Iraqi convoy at Mutla' was portrayed as an all-out\nslaughter.  This is simply not true.  The head and tail of the convoy\nwas bombed initially, resulting in a lot of casualties at these points. \n Before bombers came back, most of the rest of the Iraqi soldiers fled\non foot. \n\nFurthermore, your estimates of Kuwaiti war dead if Allies hadn't invaded\nis completely ridiculous.  You have acknowledged (certainly implicitly) \n that Saddam is a barbarous brute.  You have acknowledged the hundreds\nof thousands he has been responible for killing *in his own country*. \nYou *know* that the man he appointed as governor of Kuwait,  Ali Majid,\nwas his most brutal henchman, presiding over the near genocide of the\nKurds  in the late 80's and, more recently, the Shi'a.    Yet, when it\ncomes to his treatment of Kuwaitis, he is an angel.  In your estimate,\nhe would've killed *fewer* than he already had when the war started. \nWhat a joke! \n\n\nAPn  03/09 0006  Iraq War Dead \n\nCopyright, 1993. The Associated Press.

Subject: Re: PLEASE! SHOW UP IN WASHINGTON DC FOR BOSNIA (MAY 15th)\nFrom: Nick Jovanovic, jovanovic-nick@yale.edu\nDate: 12 May 1993 17:19:43 -0400\n\nNo, I'm not claiming 2,000,000 have been killed.  We are in the middle of\nthe genocide process that Mr. Major has given yet another "green light"\nto.  Mladic seems to have most of what he wants, but Boban is just\ngetting his appetite whetted. Because Mladic refuses to allow\ninternational observers to inspect mass-grave sites and killing centers\nin places like Foca, Brcko, and Visegrad, it will be years before we have\nan accurate account of the number killed. \n\nIn practical terms, it would be impossible to kill all 2,000,000.  There\njust isn't the kind of machinery of crematoria and gas chambers and\ntransportation lines that the Nazis took 8 YEARS to develop.  And\nremember, the Nazis killed minorities in the countries they occupied.  To\nactually kill 42% of the population requires extreme genocidal\norganization.   \n\nBut I do claim that the goal of the genocide is the systematic\nannihilation of Bosnian Muslim culture, by killing as many as is\nfeasible, by rape, by torture, by the demolition of mosques, libraries,\nand culture artificts, the burning and renaming of villages, the shelling\nof civilians.  So that there won't be any of the 2,000,000 or so Muslims\nwhose lives have not been shattered by the genocide, though they still\nmay be alive.\n\nAnd Mr. Major not only finds this acceptable, he helps it along by making\nsure that the victims don't have arms to defend themselves.\nMike.
What is so honorable about placing bombs in passenger airliners,\npromising to execute Rushdie, killing 1-2 million people in the\nIran/Iraq war, murdering tourists and persecuting ethinc Christians in\nEgypt, massacring Christians in Sudan, harassing Christians in and \nbarring Jews from Saudi Arabia?  How are paranoid Muslims "righteous\nin defending themsselves" in these situations?

Azeri views on this dispute have\n[AR] appeared rarely if at all in the Western news media.  Therefore let me\n[AR] present _Washington Report_ readers with some basic truths about the\n[AR] origins of the conflict.\n\nDuring the past two years, if one reads all the commentaries on the subject,\na small minority of the writers have been Armenia or Azeri.\n\nThe following should be interesting. \n\n[AR] Armenian leaders claim that Azerbaijan was the first to oppress and\n[AR] expel the Armenian minority from the Azerbaijani Republic.  Actually,\n[AR] the initiative to banish the Azeri minority and convert the Armenian\n[AR] Republic into a homogeneous state began in the winter of 1987-1988,\n[AR] when 165,000 Azeris were driven out of Armenia.  Following that move,\n[AR] there were massacres of Armenians in the Azerbaijani cities of Sumgait\n[AR]in February 1988 and two years later, in Baku in January 1990.\n\nThis not true. Other than simply checking the newspapers, I will quote from an\nindependent human rights report. In the _PAX Cristi Netherlands_, 29 September\n1991, page 28, we read:\n\n "By mid-november, many incidents took place in several places in\n  Azerbaijan. The APF [Azeri Popular Front] challenged the Communist Party\n  for power. ... After ten days, the authorities came in with tanks to\n  reimpose their power. In Nakhitchevan, the last Armenian villages were\n  deported. In Ganja, Armenians were attacked and killed. All 40,000 \n  Armenian inhabitants fled the city..."\n\n  Between 22 November and 8 December 1988, refugees from Ganja arrived in\n  Armenia while all 167,000 Azeris in Armenia were chased away."\n\nIn this part of the world February 1988 [start of organized anti-Armenian \npogroms in Azerbaijan] come before November and December of 1988!\n\n[AR] Azeri parliamentary committees have compiled evidence indicating that\n[AR] both events were inspired from Moscow to secure Russian imperial rule\n[AR] in the Transcaucasus, according to the Roman principle of "divide and\n[AR] rule."  Similar conspiracies are evident throughout the five-year\n[AR] history of the conflict.\n\nIt is interesting that the Azeris killed, burnt, raped the Armenians but the\nperpetrators blame Russians, and Armenians themselves on other occasions.\n \n[AR] Each time the parties have been about to reach an agreement (in\n[AR] Zheleznovodsk, Moscow, Tehran, Rome, Geneva and Alma-Ata), an\n[AR] invisible hand provoked further bloodshed.  Those interested in\n[AR] maintaining the Azeri-Armenian conflict, as well as the Georgian\n[AR] turmoil, are imperialist forces in Russia, and probably in Iran.\n\nIncorrect! When were the people of Nagorno-Karabakh ever involved in an\nagreement? Never. Until Azerbaijan sits down with the Armenians of Nagorno-\nKarabakh there will never be an end to this conflict.\n \n[AR] The Armenian offensive last spring created more than 100,000 new Azeri\n[AR] refugees from the captured towns of Upper and Lower Karabakh and\n[AR] adjacent rural districts.  Today 500,000 Azeri refugees throng the\n[AR] city of Baku and environs, providing more problems for the newly\n[AR] elected Popular Front government, which is opposed by the rigidly\n[AR] nationalistic National Independence Party.\n \nIt's called war. If the Azerbaijanis didn't try to deport and allow the \nArmenians of Nagorno-Karabakh to live in their ways, keep their Armenian\nculture, these Armenians would not have had to defend their existence. The\nAzeris should not have assumed that Armenians were going to roll over and\nplay dead. \n\n[AR] How can a Western-style democracy survive in a small Muslim country\n[AR] where 1 million of the 7 million inhabitants are unemployed?  In the\n[AR] absence of any international effort to help Azeri refugees, as Kurdish\n[AR] and Bosnian refugees have been helped, how can the Azeri government\n[AR] reject the demand of these exiles to recapture their lands, homes and\n[AR] possessions?\n\nThe Azeri government should have thought about such thnings before they\nattempted to deprive Armenians of "lands, homes, and possessions".\n \n[AR] Such simple realities must be understood in the West.\n[AR] Misunderstanding Caucasian politics leads both Western and Russian\n[AR] public opinion to imagine a permanent, and therefore irreversible,\n[AR] ethnic and religious rivalry in the Caucasus.\n\nTrue, and you, Dr. Alec Rasizade, should practice what you preach!\n \n[AR] I think Western reluctance to interfere derives from this idea.\n[AR] Meanwhile, continuation of the war could draw both Eastern and Western\n[AR] states into the conflict through activation of various security\n[AR] alliances.  These include, on the Armenian side, the Moscow-led\n[AR] Commonwealth forces under the Tashkent mutual security pact, signed\n[AR] May 15, 1992.  On the Azeri side, should Turkey get involved as the\n[AR] guarantor of the Nakhichevan autonomy through the Kars Treaty of Oct.\n[AR] 13, 1921, these include the North Atlantic Treaty forces.\n\nWestern interference! Turkish intervention! The moment Turkey dares step into\nthis conflict it will close the doors of any chance of Turkey being part of \nEurope (as if it ever will) and will destroy the eastern third of Anatolia!\nDr. Rasizade, international realpolitik is not as simple-minded as you would\nhave us believe.\n \n[AR] Upper Karabakh generally is described in Western press reports as an\n[AR]"Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan."  The truth is that the Armenians\n[AR] began to appear there only in the middle of the last century.\n\nIncorrect once again. A brief scan of history addresses such a foolish\nclaim. \n\nArmenians today, refer to the area of Nagorno-Karabakh as "Artsakh", which \ncomes from the Urartian term "Urtekhe-Urtekhini". NO Azeris yet! \n\nAncient Greeks referred to Artsakh as "Orkhistena". NO Azeris yet!\n\nIn the first half of the 6th century B.C., Artsakh, as part of Ervandid\nArmenia of Media. NO Azeris yet!\n\nFrom the end of the 4th century B.C., Artsakh was part of the Armenian Kingdom\nof Ervan. NO Azeris yet!\n\nArtsakh was still part of the Armenian Empire of Tigran. Orkhistena, or \nArtsakh is refereed to by Strabo, as part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet!\n\nAfter Armenia was divided between the Persian and Byzantine Empires in 387 \nA.D. until 428, Artsakh was part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet!\n\nEnd of the 5th century, Utik and Artsakh became principalities of the \nAranshakhiks. NO Azeris yet!\n\nBy the 7th century an Artsakh dialect of Armenian formed. NO Azeris yet!\n\nEmperor Konstantin (913-959) addressees a letter to the Prince of Khachen "To\nArmenia". Khachen was the central principality of Artsakh. NO Azeris yet!\n\nIn the decree of Paul I (1797), the number of Armenian families in this area\nwas stated as 11,000.\n\nIt was from the 16th to the 18th centuries that non-Armenians from Central\nAsia, Asia Minor, and Kurdistan first began to be exercise political influence\nin the planes of Artsakh. Caucasian Muslims around Karabakh!\n\nIn 1813 Karabagh becomes part of Russia. Officiallt part of Russia 1828. Some \nMuslims in Karabakh!\n\nIn 1914, the number of Armenian churches in Nagorno-Karabagh was 224, 188\npriests, 206,768 parishioners in 224 Armenian towns and villages. The Armenian\npercentage of the population was over 90%. MAX: 10% Azeris in Karabakh --\nassuming no Kurds!\n\nConsider the following statement by the Azerbaijani Revcom on December 1, 1920:\n\n "The Worker-Peasant Government of Azerbaidzan, having been informed of the\n  proclamation of Armenia a Soviet Socialist Republic, sends its greetings\n  to the brother people. From this day the previous boundaries between\n  Armenia and Azerbaidzan are annulled. Nagornyi Karabakh, Zangezur, and\n  Nakhichevan are recognized as integral parts of the Armenian Socialis\n  Republic.\n\n  Long live the brotherhood and union of the workers and peasants of Soviet\n  Armenia and Azerbaidzan!\n\n				Chairman of the Revcom of Azerbaidzan\n							N. Narimanov\n\n				People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs\n							Guseinov"\n\n[AR] A few years ago they celebrated the 150th anniversary of their\n[AR] resettlement from Persia to Karabakh, after it came under Russian\n[AR] rule. \n\nNo, incorrect. The 1988 celebration was the 150th anniversary of Russian rule\nin the Caucasus, including Karabakh!\n\n[AR] At the same time the Russian colonial administration also drew\n[AR] in Russian and German settlers, who were welcomed by Azeris.  How\n[AR] would Americans react if the large numbers of Armenians living in\n[AR] southern California suddenly claimed an Armenian homeland, and\n[AR] demanded separation from California?\n\nNon-sequitur. \n \n[AR] Armenian historians insist that before the Armenian resettlement\n[AR] Karabakh was inhabited by aboriginal Christians.  That is correct.\n\nArmenian historians don't say this!\n\n[AR] The people of medieval Caucasian Albania adopted Christianity in the\n[AR] fourth century.  But those ancient residents had no link to and\n[AR] nothing in common with Armenians.\n\nConsidering the Caucasian Albans were of the Armenian Apostolic faith, and\ntheir utilization of the Armenian language in their liturgy, makes such an \nargument totally invalid!\n\n[AR] Azeris would have a better claim to\n[AR] be successors of Albania, since Azeris have for centuries inhabited,\n[AR] dominated, and developed the Karabakh part of the Azeri nation.\n\nWishing to be part of a people non-existent for nearly a millennium for geo-\npolitical advantage is rather outrageous. In addition to such absurdity,\nAzeris claim to be Turks, Persians, and all the while are Azerizing their\nminorities, such as the Lezgians, Kurds, Tat, Talish, and a host of other\nnationalities which may amount to nearly half the population of Azerbaijan.\n\n[AR] Both Armenia and Azerbaijan last year signed the Final Act of the\n[AR] Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe of 1975, and the\n[AR] Paris Charter for New Europe of 1990, confirming their mutual\n[AR] adherence to the principle of inviolability of existing borders.  This\n[AR] principle means that the borders and territorial integrity of the\n[AR] Republic of Azerbaijan are to be guaranteed by all of the signatory\n[AR] nations, not just by Turkey.\n\nSuch agreements do not give Azerbaijan the right to de-populate Karabakh of\nArmenians.\n \n[AR] This is one key to intervention on behalf either of the U.N., the\n[AR] CSCE, the Commonwealth, NATO or Iran.  The second key to untying the\n[AR] Caucasian knot is to determine who is the aggressor, according to the\n[AR] U.N. definition of 1974.\n\nFine, so why has Azerbaijan refused to allow UN troops into the Armenian\nenclave? What is Azerbaijan afraid of? Perhaps the fact that the territory\nis the home of Armenians, the UN, would by definition, support the local\npopulation! \n \n[AR] When that is accomplished, the international community can and should\n[AR] apply to the aggressor in the Caucasus international sanctions such as\n[AR] those presently being employed against Serbia and Montenegro in the\n[AR] former Yugoslavia.  Such decisive collective international action can\n[AR] halt further aggression in Karabakh, and prevent the Armenian-Azeri\n[AR] conflict from growing and spreading.\n \nAzerbaijan's refusal to allow the Armenians of Karabakh to determine their\nown future the is issue, not viewing isolating events out of context are \nactions that will address the Karabakh conflict. Viewing events in a war\nin isolation and out of context is like viewing the landing at Normandy as\nan act of Allied aggression! \n \n[AR] Dr. Alec Rasizade, senior research officer at the Academy of Sciences\n[AR] of Azerbaijan, is a visiting researcher at the Harriman Institute of\n[AR] Columbia University in New York.\n\nHa!
There are doubts about it. Why don't you define what self-hating Jew means?\nI found the idea itself of being a self-hating Jew to be one of those\nrediculous things that people repeat and repeat because it seems to have a\nmeaning when in fact it has none.\nI hope you can come up with a definition in itself and not something like:\nlook at this person, that is a self-hating Jew.\n\n\nThat is why I get moved when I see the Israeli Army killing people in \nthe Occupied Territories as much as I get moved when I see a Plestinian\nstabing people in Israel.
If Croats are now divided, it is because Croatia seceded from Yugoslavia.\nCroats in Croatia, B-H, and Serbia were in *one* country--Yugoslavia--\nuntil they divided themselves. \n\nIf Muslims are now divided, it is because B-H seceded from Yugoslavia.\nMuslims in Croatia, B-H, and Serbia were in *one* country--Yugoslavia--\nuntil they divided themselves.\n\nThat Croats and Muslims in Yugoslavia decided to divide themselves does\n*not* give them the right to divide Serbs in Yugoslavia.\n\nCroatia and B-H shoulder the burden for dividing their own nations among\nvarious unstable countries.
I believe that things are getting mixed here.\nCritizicing Israel and/or being anti-zionist is not seeing "the absolute \nnegatives of that culture". Maybe, because a person can see the positives \nof that culture is that that person opposes zionism and the actions of the\nState of Israel.\nI, for one, consider the actions of the State of Israel with respect to\nthe human rights of the Palestinian people as an example of an action thaty\nopposes what Jewish culture was suppose to uphold as an example of \nrespect and what the Jewish people learned about oppresion, segregation and\nyears in the diaspora.\n\n\n\nHe might not want to recognize that. It does not make him a self-hating\nJew, as far as I see it. At most, he is a person who is not telling\nthe truth.\n\n\n\nBut, so far, it seems that the blame is always put on "the other".\nIf you read this newsgroup, for example, Israel is never guilty by\nherself. She is always responding to the actions of the "other", and\nit goes as if the actions of Isreal do not also affect the response\nof the "other' in a cycle that never ends. Also, there is blindness to\ntry to understand what the other feels and why.\nThere is always and excuse. There is always a rationale to explain why\nthings happen as they do.\nAnd, what is the worst part for me, there seems to be all the time an\nintention to try to de-humanize the "other", as if the other did not\ncare about their future, children, peace, etc, etc.

It has nothing to do with how long they have been voting, as much as HOW\nthey have been voting.  Pick up a list of the Labor parties proposals\nfor MK prior to the election and pay attention to the order.  Correlate this\nwith the number of Arab party members eligible to vote in party elections.\nFurther correlate this with the voting results from Arab areas.\n\nLo and behold, you will discover that Israeli Arab Labor party members\ndid not band together unanimously or en large for a select group of\nArab candidates.  This problem is further exacerbated by the rifts\nbetween Israeli Arabs.  Some claim membership to right wing parties\nwhile others vote for parties that do not pass the minimum cutoff.\n\nI worked within the labor party during the late 70's elections (not this\nlast one) as a volunteer and was privy to the voting results that\nwere returned from the local delegates elected.  At the time, the system\nwas structured differently but it did not cease to amaze me that there\nwas no massive effort to lobby for Arab reps. by their own delegates.\n\n\nQuite simply, if all eligible Arab voters became members of the Labor\nparty and voted, they would be able to command more than %15 of\nthe delegates.  This is a power base that can not be ignored!\nEspecially when they are not ranked high in the party (once again\ndue to lack of political power).  I have seen how the labor party\nworks from the inside and my experience has been that, as in most\npolitical situations, the MKs act out of their own self-interest.\n\nAnd to answer your question, I "broke" with labor because I felt\nthat they were heeding too much to the right-wing and ultra-orthodox\ncoalition members.\n\n\nFair enough.  My take on the matter, and I will admit to the possibility\nthat this might be seen differently is that this was a dummy argument.\nIf he was sitting on the committee, then someone else obviously would not\nbe.  In drumming up support for his seat, MK [?] would not be averse to\nusing this argument, or it could be used on his behalf.\n\nAs to the proof presented in this article, I would find it very\ninteresting to know who proposed the compromise along with a followup\ndescribing how the matter stands/was resolved.\n\nLet me just take this opportunity to say that I deplore such actions\nand groundless justifications.\n\n\nFor the record, Roni Milo, is a brash MK (self described) from the Likud\n(note NOT LABOR).  Quite frankly, I don't think anything he would say could\nsurprise me.  Annoy and aggravate, yes, surprise - no.\n\n\nYes I do and thank you for providing it.  I would be most interested\nin knowing how things turned out.  Anyone......?
Since your criminal grandparents ruthlessly exterminated more than\n600,000 Kurds between 1914 and 1916 in Eastern Anatolia. Referring to \nnotes from the personal diary of Russian General L. Odishe Liyetze on \nthe Turkish front, he wrote,\n\n"On the nights 11-12 March, 1918 alone Armenian butchers \n bayoneted and axed to death 3000 Muslims in areas surrounding\n Erzincan. These barbars threw their victims into pits, most\n likely dug according to their sinister plans to extinguish \n Muslims, in groups of 80. My adjutant counted and unearthed\n 200 such pits. This is an act against our world of civilization."\n\nOn March 12, 1918 Lieut-colonel Griyaznof wrote (from an official\nRussian account of the Turkish genocide),\n\n"Roads leading to villages were littered with bayoneted torsos,\n dismembered joints and carved out organs of Muslim peasants...\n alas! mainly of women and children."\n\nSource: Doc. Dr. Azmi Suslu, "Russian View on the Atrocities Committed\n        by the Armenians Against the Turks," Ankara Universitesi, Ankara,\n        1987, pp. 45-53.\n        "Document No: 77," Archive No: 1-2, Cabin No: 10, Drawer \n        No: 4, File No: 410, Section No: 1578, Contents No: 1-12, 1-18.\n        (Acting Commander of Erzurum and Deveboynu regions and Commander\n        of the Second Erzurum Artillery Regiment Prisoner of War,\n        Lieutenant Colonel Toverdodleyov)\n\n"The things I have heard and seen during the two months, until the\n liberation of Erzurum by the Turks, have surpassed all the\n allegations concerning the vicious, degenerate characteristic of\n the Armenians. During the Russian occupation of Erzurum, no Armenian\n was permitted to approach the city and its environs.\n\n While the Commander of the First Army Corps, General Kaltiyin remained\n in power, troops including Armenian enlisted men, were not sent to the\n area. When the security measures were lifted, the Armenians began to \n attack Erzurum and its surroundings. Following the attacks came the\n plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder\n of the owners of these houses...Plundering was widely committed by\n the soldiers. This plunder was mainly committed by Armenian soldiers\n who had remained in the rear during the war.\n\n One day, while passing through the streets on horseback, a group of\n soldiers including an Armenian soldier began to drag two old men of\n seventy years in a certain direction. The roads were covered with mud,\n and these people were dragging the two helpless Turks through the mud\n and dirt...\n\n It was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and\n traps. The Turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds\n and withdrew. The reason was that most of the Turks who were on night\n patrol did not return, and no one knew what had happened to them. The \n Turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear\n also. Finally, the Court Martial which had been established for the\n trials of murderers and plunderers, began to liquidate itself for\n fear that they themselves would be punished. The incidents of murder\n and rape, which had decreased, began to occur more frequently.\n\n Sometime in January and February, a leading Turkish citizen Haci Bekir\n Efendi from Erzurum, was killed one night at his home. The Commander\n in Chief (Odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days.\n The Commander in Chief has bitterly reminded the Armenian intellectuals\n that disobedience among the Armenian enlisted men had reached its\n highest point, that they had insulted and robbed the people and half\n of the Turks sent outside the city had not returned.\n\n ...We learnt the details this incident from the Commander-in-Chief,\n Odishelidge. They were as follows:\n\n The killings were organized by the doctors and the employers, and the\n act of killing was committed solely by the Armenian renegades...\n More than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless Turks have been\n killed in Erzincan. Large holes were dug and the defenceless \n Turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes. Later, the\n murdered Turks were thrown into the holes. The Armenian who stood \n near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses:\n 'Seventy dead bodies, well, this hole can take ten more.' Thus ten\n more Turks would be cut into pieces, thrown into the hole, and when\n the hole was full it would be covered over with soil.\n\n The Armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently\n fill a house with eighty Turks, and cut their heads off one by one.\n Following the Erzincan massacre, the Armenians began to withdraw\n towards Erzurum... The Armenian renegades among those who withdrew\n to Erzurum from Erzincan raided the Moslem villages on the road, and\n destroyed the entire population, together with the villages.\n\n During the transportation of the cannons, ammunition and the carriages\n that were outside the war area, certain people were hired among the \n Kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages. While the travellers\n were passing through Erzurum, the Armenians took advantage of the time\n when the Russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill\n the Kurds they had hired. When the Russian soldiers heard the cries\n of the dying Kurds, they attempted to help them. However, the \n Armenians threatened the Russian soldiers by vowing that they would\n have the same fate if they intervened, and thus prevented them from\n acting. All these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with\n hatred and loathing.\n\n Lieutenant Medivani from the Russian Army described an incident that\n he witnessed in Erzurum as follows: An Armenian had shot a Kurd. The\n Kurd fell down but did not die. The Armenian attempted to force the\n stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying Kurd. However, since\n the Kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony, the Armenian failed\n in his attempt. Having seen this, the Armenian ripped open the abdomen\n of the Kurd, disembowelled him, and finally killed him by stamping\n him with the iron heel of his boot.\n\n Odishelidge himself told us that all the Turks who could not escape\n from the village of Ilica were killed. Their heads had been cut off\n by axes. He also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered\n children. Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov, who passed through the village\n of Ilica, three weeks after the massacre told us the following:\n\n There were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces, on the roads.\n Every Armenian who happened to pass through these roads, cursed and\n spat on the corpses. In the courtyard of a mosque which was about\n 25x30 meter square, dead bodies were piled to a height of 140 \n centimeters. Among these corpses were men and women of every age,\n children and old people. The women's bodies had obvious marks of\n rape. The genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder.\n\n A few educated Armenian girls, who worked as telephone operators\n for the Armenian troops were called by Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov\n to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be \n proud of what the Armenians had done. To the lieutenant colonel's\n disgusted amazement, the Armenian girls started to laugh and giggle,\n instead of being horrified. The lieutenant colonel had severely\n reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour. When he told\n the girls that the Armenians, including women, were generally more\n licentious than even the wildest animals, and that their indecent\n and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity\n and barbarity, before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers,\n the Armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and\n claimed they had laughed because they were nervous.\n\n An Armenian contractor at the Alaca Communication zone command\n narrated the following incident which took place on February 20:\n\n The Armenians had nailed a Turkish women to the wall. They had cut\n out the women's heart and placed the heart on top of her head.\n The great massacre in Erzurum began on February 7... The enlisted men \n of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people. Then they\n took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts. 100 people\n among this group were able to save their lives as the result of\n my decisive attempts. The others, the Armenians claimed, were \n released when they learnt that I understood what was going on. \n Among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the\n Armenian officers, Karagodaviev. Today, some Turks were murdered\n on the streets.\n\n On February 12, some Armenians have shot more than ten innocent\n Moslems. The Russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were\n threatened with death. Meanwhile I imprisoned an Armenian for\n murdering an innocent Turk. \n\n When an Armenian officer told an Armenian murderer that he would \n be hanged for his crime, the killer shouted furiously: 'How dare\n you hang an Armenian for killing a Turk?' In Erzurum, the \n Armenians burned down the Turkish market. On February 17, I heard\n that the entire population of Tepekoy village, situated within\n the artillery area, had been totally annihilated. On the same \n day when Antranik entered Erzurum, I reported the massacre to\n him, and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible\n act. However no result was achieved.\n\n In the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred, there was a\n natural silence. On the night of 26/27 February, the Armenians deceived\n the Russians, perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the \n Turkish soldiers. Later, it was understood that this massacre had\n been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular. \n The population had been herded in a certain place and then killed\n one by one. The number of murders committed on that night reached\n three thousand. It was the Armenians who bragged to about the details\n of the massacre. The Armenians fighting against the Turkish soldiers\n were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even\n withstand the Turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred\n people and two cannons, for one night, and ran away. The leading\n Armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre.\n However, the Armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with\n the renegades in this massacre, just as in all the others. The lower\n classes within the Armenian community have always obeyed the orders\n of the leading Armenian figures and commanders. \n\n I do not like to give the impression that all Armenian intellectuals\n were accessories to these murders. No, for there were people who\n opposed the Armenians for such actions, since they understood that\n it would yield no result. However, such people were only a minority.\n Furthermore, such people were considered as traitors to the Armenian\n cause. Some have seemingly opposed the Armenian murders but have\n supported the massacres secretly. Some, on the other hand, preferred\n to remain silent. There were certain others, who, when accused by\n the Russians of infamy, would say the following: 'You are Russians.\n You can never understand the Armenian cause.' The Armenians had a\n conscience. They would commit massacres and then would flee in fear\n of the Turkish soldiers.\n\n The incidents that occurred only recently clearly manifest the real\n nature of the Armenian ideology. Nothing which is already done can\n be undone."\n\nSerdar Argic
Providing safety and security for one's own people is the most\nfundamental responsibility of any political entity. For the Palestinian\nleadership to refuse to accept this responsibility, i.e. take the\nresponsibility to protect their people from radical Palestinian elements\nwho are opposed to the peace process, is reprehensible. To argue that a\nPalestinian police force would be established in order to control peaceful\npolitical groups only reinforces the reality that the Palestinian\nleadership, so far, can not exercise control over radical Palestinian\nelements nor effectively deal with the killing of Palestinians by\nPalestinians. This is a problem that can only be solved by the\nPalestinian people.
Actually, You're wrong as well. The KKK is allowed to\nmarch and any attempts to curtail their freedom is rejected\n(Actually I believe the ACLU won a case for them last year). \n	Morality should not be legilated in a free country like\nthe U.S. \n	I'll post something on TJ and Uva under Uva for those\nHoos bashers.
In the following report: _Turkey Eyes Regional Role_ ANKARA, Turkey (AP)\nApril 27, 1993, we find in the last paragraph:\n\n[Turanist] Although Premier Suleyman Demirel criticized Ozal's often\n[Turanist] brash calls for more Turkish influence, he also has spoken\n[Turanist] of a swath of Turkic peoples "stretching from the Adriatic\n[Turanist] Sea to the Great Wall of China."\n\nWho does Demirel think he is fooling? It seems at both ends of his envisioned \npan-Turkic Empire -- the Balkans and the Caucasus -- Turkey's fascist boasts\nare being pre-empted.\n\nI would suggest Turkey let the world feel some of their "Grey Wolf Teeth", and\nattempt to stretch from the Adriatic to China! Turkey will have cried "wolf"\njust once too much!

The falsity of this statement is easily visible in the\n    intellectual corruption that dominates everything you post in\n    this group.  Your complete lack of objectivity toward Israel, \n    and Jewish identity in general, reveal biases that indicate a\n    great steaming heap of hatred!\n    \n    You certainly have shown a genuine hatred for honesty and for\n    objectivity. You repeatedly post items or quotes removed from \n    their original context so that they can be used to further an \n    agenda of rabid opposition to the very existence of Israel.\n\n    You have used this dishonest technique to paint a false image \n    of several Israeli leaders.  I can't say if you actually HATE\n    these leaders, but the lies and misrepresentations of them do\n    suggest that you have a visceral prejudice against them.\n    \n    So, while you claim that you do not hate anybody, there is an\n    ample body of evidence to suggest that this claim of yours is \n    false.  It is obvious that you hate Israel, and it is evident\n    that you hate the Jewish people.\n\n    And, if you are Jewish, you are a self-hating Jew.  There can\n    be no doubt of this.  Although you will call upon your Jewish\n    background in an effort to claim the high moral ground, there\n    is no doubt that you would like to see the Jewish people fade\n    away completely, as a people.  Your advocacy of intermarriage\n    for the purpose of dissolving the Jewish people is proof that \n    you hate the Jewish people.\n\n    And by your effort to superimpose the meaninglessness of your\n    own Jewishness on all Jews, you've clearly demonstrated to me \n    that you hate yourself.\n                      \n                      *       *       *       *\n\n    "Who is a Jew?  A person whose integrity decays when unmoved \n    by the knowledge of wrong done to other people."
Then you haven't been paying attention to the arguments levelled against\nthem. They have been, over and over again.  They will be again.\n\n\nHey, what do you think dictionaries are for?  You quite obviously need\none.  A good dictionary gives both, and you well know it.\n\n\nI don't think that data exist on this directly.\n\n\nThat is no problem.  But once again you are defining Zionism as *ONE*\nmovement.  You are implying that it is monolithic.  You *KNOW* this is\nnot and has never been the case.\n\n\nYou don't say it directly.  You implied it, and I showed explicitly\nwhere and how you implied it.  Now you're trying to wriggle out of it.\nWon't wash, and you know it.\n\n\nIt's you, not me, who is running out of arguments.  \n\n\nWhat you said is that "Judaism is defined according to religious\nstandards."  Now this can have several different meanings, and you know\nit.  One of the meanings that it can have is to say that "Only those who\nare religious are defined as Jews".  Another is to say that "Only those\nwho meet the religious definition of a Jew is one."  And there are\nothers.  I'm not twisting your words.  I'm trying to make you aware that\nyour words don't mean what you think they do.\n\n\nActually, it doesn't.  And the citizens' rights are exactly THE SAME in\nboth cases, anyway.\n\n\nJewish\n\n\nJewish\n\n\nIt'll depend on what religion is practiced in the house.  The original\nlaw of return would still admit such a person if they were Jewish, if\nmemory serves.\n\n\nNot Jewish.\n\n\n\nThat's valid, as far as I can see.\n\n\nMore than once.  As have others.\n\n\nThe very one you give above.  It is absolutely inconsistent with the\ntwist you put on it.  \n\n\nNo you didn't.  You had to twist the definition of the word 180 degrees\nin order to do so, and everyone else knows it.  I'm not being touchy.\n\n\nBecause what you gave *WAS NOT* an example.  IT WAS an example of how\nthe definition of a word can be twisted around 180 degrees.  \n\n\nOh, so now what are dictionaries for?\n\n\nDuh.  As a scientist, whose technical terms are very often not found in\ncommon dictionaries, I know this.  But when a term is common, like\nhypocrisy, a good dictionary can be regarded as an authoritative source.\n\n\nIt's not nonsense.  When people read what you write, they have to try to\nassociate a meaning to those words.  Dictionaries give the meanings of\nwords, don't they?  Now, I assume that you'd like to have the words you\nuse mean what you'd like them to.  But the fact is, you're using very\ndifferent meanings than are in the dictionary, or you would like the\nreader to assign them new meanings, which they never had.  \n\n\nNot at all.  What I cannot abide is utter bombast when you've been\nproven completely wrong.\n\n\nI never put even one syllable in your mouth.  You have tried to prove\nthis and you failed.  \n\n\nPoppycock.\n\n\nI read what you said.  I did not add anything.  You simply either don't\nknow that the words don't mean what you'd like them to - which cannot be\nthe case now since you've been proven wrong and you quite obviously\ndon't have a defense against the arguments presented, or you're twisting\nthe meanings.  Which is it?\n\n\nHa!  There's nothing resembling fact in what you've said.  I NEVER added\n*ANYTHING* to what you said.
