I've built xcoral on my system (SunOS 4.1.3, X11R5, Motif 1.2, OW 3.0)\nand it builds fine, but when I run it, any child windows that xcoral\nopens,\n1) locks the mouse into the window area\n2) doesn't accept any input from the mouse.\n\nNeedless to say, this is a pain in the ass, as I have to go find an\nempty terminal to login and kill xcoral.\n\nIs this a problem with OpenWindows or Motif?  Is there a patch?\n---\n#######################################################################\n# Bob Campbell                 #  "Crayons can take you where no      #\n# System Manager               #   Starship can go."                  #\n# HAO, NCAR                    #                    -Guinan           #\n# rsc@hao.ucar.edu             #                     STTNG            # \n#######################################################################\nDISCLAIMER: My views are in no way connected to my employer.
Hello,\n\nI was wondering if anyone knew of an interface to od ( octal dump ), I assume\nit would be called xod.  Actually, any viewer for a core file will do.\n\nI looked at export ( @ mit ) in the index of /contrib, but didn't find anything \nrelevant.
Can somebody send me a copy of this faq?\n\nThanks alot!
Is there an easy (ie via shell commands) way to tell what the DISPLAY \nenvironment variable is for any given client process?  Sometimes I can \nget what I want by typing ps -axe if:\n   a. the client was invoked with a -display argument\n      or\n   b. DISPLAY is one of the first few variables defined in the environment\n      (actually I've never seen b. but it's there to illustrate the type \n      of thing I'm looking for)\n\nUltimately I wish to determine the number of displays that are simultaneously \nrunning a given X application.\n\nmy system: SunOS 4.1.2 sun4c\n\nthanks for any help,

Whatever happened to uwm? Is it still available in some form? It's\nbeen years since I used it or heard anyone talk about it.\n--
The *fastest* way is to use an X server with shared memory extension. It uses\nshared memory if it is a local X server (hence images don't have to be duplicated),\nand defaults to the regular image routines if either the shared mem extension\nis not available, or if it's  not the localhost.
Several ways are available -- pageview (which I think came\nwith our system, so I can't point), ghostview (with ghostscript), and\nthe new xv 3.00 package all do so.  I recommend the latter two,\nespecially xv if you want to do any conversion.\n\n	I'm not sure offhand, but I will attempt to mail you the\ncomp.lang.postscript FAQ, which has a list of utilities.

Hello!!!\n\nThe title just about says it all.\n\nI need a list of the bugs for Motif 1.2.
It seems silly, but while I've located things like tgif that can  edit\ngif  files, and various tools to convert to/from gif format, I haven't\nbeen able to locate a program that just opens a window and displays  a\ngif file in it.  I've looked thru various faq files, also to no avail.\nIs there one lurking about in some  archive?   Nothing  sophisticated;\njust "show the pretty picture"?\n\nAlternatively, if I could locate the specs for gif, I don't suppose it\nwould be too hard to write it myself, but I have no idea where to even\nstart looking for the spec.  (Well, actually, I do have an idea - this\nnewsgroup.  ;-)
I am saving an image on one machine and redisplaying the image on\nanother machine (both are HP 9000 Model 750s).  The image is created\nusing XCreateImage and XGetImage and displayed with XPutImage.  The\nimage is redisplayed correctly except that the colors are wrong because\nthe server on the other machine is using a different colormap.\n\nI tried saving the colormap (pixel and rgb values) and on the redisplay,\nperformed a table lookup against the new colormap.  This didn't work\nbecause some rgb combos don't exist in the new colormap.\n\nIs there a way to force the server to load colors into set pixel values, or\nis there a simpler way to solve this problem?  I tried using xinitcolormap\nbut couldn't get that to work either.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.
Is there a portable and convenient way to use color picture files in\nthe .xpm format to define an X pixmap in a Motif application? Any\nfunctions, pointers, tips etc. would be most welcome.\n\n--------------------\nSaad Mufti\nPersonal Library Software
I am just beginning to try using the Athena toolkit and am having some problems \ngetting started.  I think that some files are missing on the system, but there is\nthe possibility that they are just in a different directory.  When I try to link\nmy program it can't find XtInitailize, XtRealizeWidget, XtMainLoop, \nXtCreateManagedWidget, or commandWidgetClass.  I've included Intrinsic.h and\nCommand.h.  I also had a problem on compile with XtNcallback but replaced that with\na NULL in order to compile and see if there were any other problems.  I haven't \nused a toolkit before and this is simply an example I got from the manuel.  Can\nsomeone tell me where I might look for these calls, that is, in what file not what\ndirectory they are supposed to be under because the system manager doesn't believe\nin standard directories and generally does things his own way.  (I am using UNIX)\n\nThank you for your assistance.

The patches for xv.h need to use ``#ifdef SVR4'' rather than the\noverly complex ``#if defined(sun) && defined(SYSV)'' in order to\ngenerically compile XV on i386SVR4Architecture.  Also, rand and srand\ndon't work very well--use lrand48 and seed48 to get better results.\nOtherwise, xv-3.00 compiles just fine on my Esix System V 4.0.4 box\nwith XFree86 and gcc-2.3.3.  I just uncommented the gcc definition in\nthe Makefile, added -L/usr/X386/lib -I/usr/X386/include to the COPTS\nline and modified LIBS to include -lsocket -lnsl.

I'm trying to compile xftp which uses the Xw widget set and I'm having\nproblems.  We're using Motif and X11R5 and it seems that my version of the\nXw stuff was only ported to R3.  Are there patches out to port this to R5\n(or a newer port altogether)??\n\nOr perhaps a newer port of xftp for use with R5??\nThanks in advance.
I have written a server program which makes socket connections to many nodes\nand collects data from that nodes periodically. I need to display this data on\nmy X Application. I tried\nto invoke this server using XtAddAppTimeout which works ok. But the\nproblem here is some time there is delay in collecting data. So I doesn't\nreturns to EventLoop during that time and my application remains busy and\nIt doesn't respond to users input. I button press events are queued and\nexected after server finished its task. Now I am going to try AppAddInput\ncall. So that It reads pipe only when there is something to read in pipe.\n\nI am thinking of creating one pipe in which server will write and client\nwhich is my X application will read. Now I have some doubts which you may\nbe able to clarify.\n\n1) When I fork a process. It will create to copy of my process. Right !!\n   Now what does this two copies mean? Two Shells. Where should I fork\n   my application. What are the responsibilities of this processes. How\n   should I call this processes.?\n\n2) Can I fork more than one processes. So that I can read from more\n   than one servers input.\n\nThanks\n\nSamir Patel\n\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nspatel@cs.tamu.edu

That's not all it says.  The coverage of modifiers is in Chapter 8\nof Volume Four (or chap 7 in older Athena editions), where there is about \n10 pages on how to specify translations to capture\nvarious combinations of keys or buttons.\n\nThe Xlib route uses XLookupString and there is a lot of coverage\nof how that works in Volume One,  chapter 9.  You should read this\nto understand how all the mappings work before trying to do anything\ncomplicated.

HI\n\nI`m looking for some assistance in locating information on how to run\nwin 3.1 on a CGA monitor. The setup suggests you look at the manual, but\nthe guy I`m helping is part of a large office and computer assistance\nmust be booked in advance, therefore he cant get windows onto his CGA\nsystem. \n\nThanx in anticipation
Will there be no chance to get the Author of this _REALLY_ superb program\nto remove the 'institutional' point in his license statement ?\nOr at least to say 'except educational ones' at this ?\n\nI understand that use of this software by either commercial or governmental\nusers should be result in a donation to its creator, but the everytime\nrare on money universities, schools or whatever else institutions should\nnot be restricted.\n\nIf the situation stays as is and the Author explicitely states that\nhe treats universities and schools as institutions in this context,\ni'll have to fallback to xv 2.21 here. Maybe our disk capacity will\nsoon be dead, when every user has a copy of xv-3.00 in his home dir...
Yes, but it's broken on OW 2.0.  It does not handle multiple pages\nwell.  If you don't have the proper PostScript commands it will\ndraw the entire document on the same page instead of pausing after\neach page.  I haven't tried OW 3.0 yet, though.
<\n<>OW 3.0 is the same.  But, the definition of broken is relative.  Pageview\n<>requires DSC compliant PostScript files, in order to stop at page breaks.\n<>I don't consider that broken.  I say that any program that puts out a\n<>PostScript file that isn't DSC compliant is broken.\n<\n<Well that may be true.  However, the man page for pageview for OW 2.0\n<does not mention about DSC compliance.  In any event, the point here\n<is that if you try to display some PS files using pageview you will\n<find out that it's not a practical tool.\n\nIt is true that the man page for pageview does not say that the files need\nto be DSC compliant.  That is the fault of the left hand not knowing what the\nright hand is doing at Sun.  I was informed by a Sun employee that the pageview\nprogram does require DSC compliant PostScript.  There was the possibility that\nit was going to be changed so that if the file wasn't DSC compliant that it\nwould stop at each showpage.  I believe that this method would preclude being\nable to go backwards and forwards through the file, i.e., you could only go\nforward to the next showpage.  This isn't in OW3.0 pageview, but maybe it is\nin the Solaris 2.x version of OW (OW 3.1?).\n\nIn any event, I find pageview extremely useful.  Since all of the PostScript\nthat I produce IS DSC compliant, I don't have any problems.

I just got a bug report and a fix for this exact problem from\nfisher@iscp.bellcore.com (Greg Fisher):\n\n\nHe isolated the problem a proposed a workaround which seems precisely\ncorrect.

In that case, the proposed layout is already\n     * forgotten, so we should just quietly exit.\n     */\n    if ( tw->table.resize_status == RSdueToRequest )\n    {\n        XmpTableMakeColsFitQueryWidth(  tw );\n        XmpTableMakeRowsFitQueryHeight( tw );\n        XmpTableGetProposedChildSize(   tw );\n        XmpTableSaveProposedLayout(     tw );\n    }\n    /* else the resize has already been done.  Our proposed layout would\n     * have been forgotten in the process.\n     */\n}\n\nThe XpTable the fix is identical, except of course for the names:\n\nXp/Table.c:\n\nvoid XpTableNewProposedLayout(  tw )\n    XpTableWidget  tw;\n{\n    XpTableConsiderSameSize(       tw );\n    XpTableProposedColsAndRows(    tw );\n    XpTableQueryParentForResize(   tw );    /* query only, no resize */\n    /*\n     * Since we only made a query, we *should* still need to continue.\n     * However, some manager widgets are broken so that we actually may\n     * already have * been resized.

I use it all day every day (maintaining our ftp site and answering mail\nvia support@qdeck.com), and I can honestly say that in the last few\nmonths I've never had my machine go down due to any sort of tcpip network\nmanager instability. (Of course, I've crashed my machine quite a few times\non purpose, during beta testing and that sort of thing, but the tcpip\nportion is quite stable...)\n\nHowever, keep in mind that DVX and the network managers are only going\nto be as stable as the software they sit on top of (so if your underlying\nnetwork kernel is flakey, you can't expect DVX to be terribly stable...)\n\n\nIt just goes as a window that has graphics drawn into it. (To vastly\nover-simplify what goes on, we just take the windows graphics API calls,\nand translate them directly to X-protocol; unfortunately, windows was\nnot really written to be network-aware, so sometimes we see a speed\npenalty when an app does something stupid, like sending a big white bitmap\nto erase something rather than just drawing a white box; fortunately,\nthat sort of thing is rare...)\n\n\nYou need to run MS windows, which Word then runs inside. You could run\nmultiple windows programs within the one WinX window, and windows has\nways to automagically start winapps when you start windows, so in practice\nit's not really a major problem. I have my system set up so that I can\nrun WinX, which automatically starts Word Full-screen (for windows), so\nI never see any part of windows but word...)

We have a problem with 'makedepend': it doesn't know how to correctly process\n   #if clause in C preprocessor statements. It evaluates everything to\n   true no matter what the conditionals are.\n\n   [...]\n\n   Has anybody come up with some solution/fix to 'makdepend' other than\n   WriteYourOwnParser... and willing to share it with us?\n\nrewrite 'makedepend' to use 'cc -M' or 'gcc -M' or 'gcc -MM' (which is\nthe one I prefer, since system headers don't change that often) for\ngenerating the actual dependencies.  you'll still need to write the\nparts that edit the actual Makefile.

You allways could port and use emu from export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/emu.tar.Z.\nWe've implemented a blinking text cursor for the very reasons people mentioned.\nYou can even configure the actual size of the text cursor (horizontal / ver-\ntical line cursors, smaller block cursors), turn on and off blinking,\nset the blink rate and so on. You even get blinking text - ok, enough\nadvertising.\n\nI haven't looked at the xterm code in this respect, but from the memories\nI have when we had to decide whether to start with xterm and make it do\nwhat we wanted (mostly the blinking text), I'd say it won't be easy, since\nxterm is a hairy mess (understandable if you follow it's roots back to\nX10).\n\nThe actual task to get the cursor to blink isn't that difficult if you\nprovide the right hooks. As Antonio mentioned, you'll have to show the\ncursor directly after it has moved, or people will become confused.\nSince it's a good idea to take the cursor off the screen when you \ndo anything on screen anyways, this isn't very complicated. You'll just\nhave to start the blink process with the cursor showing directly after\nit's mapped.\n\nAs for the portability of emu and it's newest version. The one on export\nis still the same as on the R5 contrib tape. We wanted to get out a new\nrelease for over six months now, but unfortunately we're drowning in work.\nBut since the changes aren't affectiong emu's behavior much, I'd say\nwhoever wants to try emu shouldn't wait for a new version.\n\nAs is, emu won't work on BSD derived systems (e.g. SUNs) with anything else \nthan a csh. There is a fix to this, which is very short (remove one line\nof code). I'll put this on export today.\n\nMichael

Ok, I'm being driven batty.\n\n\nTrying to create popup-menus (ie. button3 press, and a menu\nappears).  I would really like to use the standard Athena\nclasses to achieve this goal, but for my best attempts\nI cannot get the menus to come up without using a MenuButton\nas the parent of the widget tree.  I know this should be\npossible to to with an XtPopupSpringLoaded() and a\nlittle twiddling, but something is escaping me.

Excerpts from netnews.comp.windows.x: 15-May-93 Re: COLORS and X windows\n(A.. John Cwikla@morrison.wri (4620) \n\n\nWhat I'd like to see is this scenario: \n\nEach widget, view, whatever, describes it's colors via a palette. \nPalettes can be shared and they only contain descriptive information. \nThey are not directly tied to the object that uses them.  Palettes are\nheld in the server.  A palette can accomadate, up to, the number of\nhardware color cells of color descriptors. \n\nWhen the input focus is in a particular widget, that widget has access\nto all of the colors that are described in its associated palette.  ALL\nOTHER WIDGETS, TRANSIENTLY, GET THE CLOSEST APPROXIMATION THAT CAN BE\nGENERATED BY A UNION OF THE COLORS FROM THE CURRENT PALETTE AND ANY FREE\nCOLORS THAT ARE LEFT OVER. \n\nA widget specifies a color for imaging by providing an index (pixel)\ninto its associated palette.
One way to "mask" the left button check the contents of the XEvent that the\nXAddEventHandler send to your event_handling function (in your case, it is the\nshow_mouse_position function. \n\nIf the XEvent arrive in this function as \n\nXEvent p_event;\n\nthen, the value of p_event->xbutton.button is the button that was pressed. So, \nyou just do a switch on that value in order to distinguish between them. In case\nit was not clear p_event->xevent.button is an int. \n\nBy the way, you mentioned the Button1MotionMask and if anyone can help me with \nthese MotionMasks I would be grateful. I can not figure out how do distinguish\nbetween motions by which button is pressed as the motion is occurring. In \nessence I would like an seperate event-handler for motion with each button. \nUnfortunately, the XEvent sent by a MotionMask does not seem to contain the \nvalue of the pressed button.

Hi,\n\n   We have a requirement for dynamically closing and opening\ndifferent display servers within an X application in a manner such\nthat at any time there is only one display associated with the client.\n\n   Assumming a proper cleanup is done during the transition should\nwe anticipate any problems.
The problem was that TextField was improperly walking the string; it used\nthe character count instead of the byte count... a significan "Oops". \nThe problem has been fixed and the patch is included in the latest periodic\npatch from HP support services.

Anyone help me?\n                       Thanks in advance for any help!!!\n                                                            IOP
I recently corrected the resolution on my Sparcstation by changing\n/usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers from:\n:0 local /usr/bin/X11/X :0 -ar1 500 -dpi 100\nto:\n:0 local /usr/bin/X11/X :0 -ar1 500 -dpi 85\n\nI determined that my 19" 1152x900 monitor was 85 dpi by measuring the\nactive screen area and dividing by resolution.\n\nHowever, this has caused my application fonts to behave strangely.\nAfter some research, I believe this is caused by my applications\nrequesting fonts by Family, Weight, Slant, and Pointsize.  I believe\nthat X is grabbing the first font on the path with these characteristics\nand displaying it.  Since I have only 75dpi and 100dpi fonts on my\npath, the results are inaccurate.  I do have some Speedo fonts, but\nnot for the family I am using (Helvetica).\n\nI think this is incorrect.  The fonts should always be provided in the\nresolution of the display.  This never seems to happen unless you\nexplicitly request fonts by xres and yres!  This is true of both the\nscaleable and bitmapped fonts!  For instance, the command\n\nxfd -fn '-bitstream-charter-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*'\n\nWill invoke a 75dpi font (despite the fact that this is a Speedo font).\n\nThe command  \n\nxfd -fn '-adobe-courier-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*'\n\nWill invoke a 75dpi font or a 100dpi font (depending on my font path).\nDespite the fact that X knows my display is 85 dpi, and that it can\ngenerate an 85dpi font for me!  Unless I my applications specifies a\nresolution, X appears to pick a stupid default.\n\nIs this a bug?  Is it a feature?  If so, why?  Is there anything I can\ndo to get around this problem?  People have suggested that I lie about\nmy resolution, and specify a single font path (75 or 100, not both).\nThis would at least make my app consistent, but I like being able to\nlook at rulers that appear in my paint application and say: "Yup, thats\nan inch".  Anyone have a set of 85dpi bitmapped fonts I can use?\n\nSystem info:\nSun Sparc 10/41 w/32 MB, SunOS 4.1.3.\n\nxdpyinfo:\nversion number:    11.0\nvendor string:    MIT X Consortium\nvendor release number:    5000\nscreen #0:\n  dimensions:    1152x900 pixels (348x272 millimeters)\n  resolution:    85x85 dots per inch\n\nxset q font path:\n  /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc/,/usr/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo/,/usr/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi/,/usr/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/

This is a question aimed at those who have done some server code hacking:\n\n\n\nI am attempting to add a working SaveScreen function to a new\nserver.  I have been able to get the screen to blank out properly, and through\ndebugging I can see that my savescreen function is being called with on=0,\nwhich (for some arcane reason) means to blank the screen.\n\nMy problem is that this function is never being called again with on=1, even\nafter I have moved the mouse and/or typed some keys.  My question is:  what am\nI likely to be missing that would cause this problem?  I copied the basic\ndesign of my function from the existing versions:\n\nstatic Bool next_savescreen(scr,on)\nScreenPtr scr;\nBool on;\n{\n\n  /* this was copied from the omron server code -- is it the right way? */\n  if (on != SCREEN_SAVER_ON) {\n		nextSetLastEventTime();\n  }\n\n  if (on == SCREEN_SAVER_ON) { /* Save user's current setting */\n		next_save_screen_brightness = NXScreenBrightness(my_eventhandle);\n		NXSetScreenBrightness( my_eventhandle, 0.0); /* Blank the screen */\n  }\n  else {											 /* Unblank the screen */\n		NXSetScreenBrightness( my_eventhandle, next_save_screen_brightness);\n  }\n\n  return TRUE;\n}\n\nI can see in the server/os code where the screensaver is called to turn on the\nsaver, but I cannot find where it "wakes up" the server and unblanks the\nscreen.\n\nAny tips/help would be appreciated.\n\nThanks.

Bristol Technology announces the availability of \nits HyperHelp(tm) and Xprinter(tm) demo for downloading.\n\nThis demo showcases the two products in the form of a \ndiagram editor called DE.\n\nDownload the demo and see some of these exciting features for yourself:\n\n	 o Complete on-line context sensitive help system.\n\n	 o Printing support for PCL5 and PostScript.\n\n	 o Rotated Text support!\n\n	 o Source code for the demo is provided.\n\nThe demo is available via anonymous ftp from ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9).\n\nThere are two versions of the demo located in the vendor/Bristol directory:\nSun     - sun4.demo.tar.Z (SunOS 4.x)\nHP      - hp700.tar.Z     (HP-UX 8 & 9)\n\nIf you have any questions about the demo, send an\ne-mail to: support@bristol.com.\n\nIf you want another version of the demo (rs6000,etc...) \nplease send an e-mail to: info@bristol.com.\n\nRemember to use binary mode!\n\n\nWhat are HyperHelp and Xprinter?  Read on......\n---------------------------------------------------------\nBristol Technology is proud to announce version 3.0 of\nits popular HyperHelp product and version 2.0 of Xprinter.\n\n			    HyperHelp 3.0\n			    -------------\nHyperHelp is the de-facto standard for on-line context\nsensitive help in the Unix marketplace.  Through a one\nline function call, application developers can access the\nfull features of HyperHelp and cut down drastically on\ntheir development time.  HyperHelp can use the same RTF,\nproject, and bitmap files as the MS Windows Help facility.\nThis allows a documentation department to maintain a single\nset of help documents portable between MS Windows, Motif and\nOpen Look.  HyperHelp can also be authored in FrameMaker. \nAnd with HyperHelp 3.0 Bristol introduces its SGML compiler!\n\nNew features in HyperHelp 3.0 include secondary windows,a character\nbased viewer, segmented bitmaps, SGML support, and an improved History\nwindow.\n\n			     Xprinter 2.0\n			     ------------\nXprinter 2.0 allows developers to add sophisticated\nprinter support to their existing/new X based applications\nvery easily.  Xprinter uses the Xlib API for both the\ndisplay and printer.  This lets you use the exact same code\nfor drawing and printing.  Take a look at the source code for\nour demo and see Xprinter in action.\n\nIf you are interested in adding PostScript and PCL5 support\nto your application, Xprinter is the tool for you!  Earlier\nthis year Bristola dn USL signed an agreement that\nresulted in Xprinter becoming the standard printing technology\nfor UNIX SVR4.2.\n\n\nFeel free to run the demo and let us know what you think about\nHyperHelp and Xprinter. \n\nIf you have any questions or comments, send them to us at:\ninfo@bristol.com or call us at (203) 438-6969.\n\n				Happy demoing,
Figured it out.  The answer lies in mit/server/ddx/mfb/mfbcustom.h.

I am having the problem of ensuring point-to-focus when the mouse\ncursor enters a window in my application.  I'm using InterViews,\nbut that may not matter, this seems to be a generic problem in X.\nFor example, I use OpenWindows on a Sparc2, with point-to-focus\nset, and that generally works, but not always, depending on what\nwas going on in some window when I move the cursor from one shell\ntool window to another.  Or so it seems...\n\nMy question, then, is what can I do within X to guarantee point-to-\nfocus within my application?  Thanks for any response.

HPGL does not support raster primitives, so a formatter would have to \npunt on most popular image formats.  This probably explains the lack of\ntranslators out there.  What do you need to plot ?

After looking at the scaling code I realized the follwing:\n\n  1) My problem with the resolution 100x100 foints is due to an installation \n     problem.\n\n  2) That the X server or font server will rescale the best font it can find\n     to meet your requirements.  \n\n     This means that if you server return a response like the following\n\n     -adobe-helvetica-medium-o-normal--0-0-75-75-p-0-iso8859-1\n\n     You can ask for the follwogin:\n\n        -adobe-helvetica-medium-o-normal--14-100-90-90-p-0-iso8859-1\n \n     and it will generate it for you.  You should try to always use \n     known pixel sizes.

Well, I know of one hack to sort of do this conversion.  First\nget ghostscript and check out the gs_2asc.ps file that comes with it.\nIt prints out some information about where each text string goes on the\npage, and maintains page counts.  I've written a little C program to\nmassage the output of gs -dNODISPLAY gs_2asc.ps somewhat, so that you\ncan get all the ascii strings in the document.  No guarantees that it\nwon't break up words/sentences, though - I've used it with varying\ndegrees of success.  Anyways, try this out, it may do what you want.\n\n/*\n * massager: a filter for use with gs; does crude Postscript->ASCII conversion\n *\n * Usage:\n *	cat file.ps | gs -dNODISPLAY gs_2asc.ps - | massager\n *\n * I print a <Ctrl-L> after each new page.\n *\n * Put the following source into massager.c and compile it:\n */\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nmain()\n{\n	char	line[1000], *p;\n\n	while (fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin) != NULL)\n		if (line[0] == 'P')\n			printf("\f\n");\n		else if (line[0] == 'S' && line[1] == ' ') {\n			if ((p = strrchr(line, ')')) == NULL)\n				continue;\n			*p = '\0';\n			if ((p = strchr(line, '(')) == NULL)\n				continue;\n			for (p++; *p; p++)\n				if (*p != '\\' || (p[1] != ')' && p[1] != '('))\n					putchar(*p);\n			putchar('\n');\n		}\n\n	return(0);\n}

It's compatible with the\n    X11 window system from MIT as well as (currently) Sun's NeWS and SunView,\n    so you can intermix programs written for any of those systems.\n    It comes from Sun and also with System V Release 4 from certain vendors.\n    OpenWindows is sometimes also called openwin or xnews, after the\n    program used to start it and the main executable itself, respectively.\n    It should not be called `Windows' or 'OPEN LOOK' or `OpenLook', as\n    these terms are either wrong or apply to something else.\n    A commerical OpenWindows source licence costs about $5,000 for the server,\n    plus about $25,000 for DeskSet, and another $40,000 for ToolTalk.\n    The current versions of OpenWindows for various platforms are:\n	SunOS 4.1.1 on Sun 3: 2.0\n	Solaris 1.x (SunOS 4.1.x) on SPARC: 3.0\n	Solaris 2.0 (SunOS 5) on SPARC: 3.0.1\n\n    See Also:\n	Mixing X11 and OpenWindows\n	Where can I get it?\n\n@ What are OLIT, XView and TNT?\n    These are all toolkits for programmers to use in developing programs\n    that conform to the OPEN LOOK specifications.  See the Bibliography\n    for documentation on the individual toolkits.  Here's a brief summary:\n\n    OLIT was AT&T's OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit for the X Window system;\n    it used a widget set, and was probably the easiest for people who were\n    already X11/Xt programmers to learn.  You could buy the source from AT&T,\n    although you didn't get the same version tht Sun ship.  Sun includes the\n    OLIT library in OpenWindows (q.v.); it is also often included in\n    System V Release 4.  It was written in C.  The release of OLIT in\n    OpenWindows 3.0 was OLIT 3.0.  OLIT support passed to USL (then a\n    division of AT&T, now owned by Novell), who replaced it with MoOLIT (q.v.).\n    Note that because of the nature of Xt subclassing, you will probably\n    want or need OLIT source in order to develop a large application or\n    anything else that uses subclasses.\n    [see the proceedings of the 1991 X Technical Conference]\n\n    XView is Sun's toolkit for X11, written in C.  XView is similar in\n    programmer interface to SunView.  There's even a shell script to help\n    migrate source code from SunView to XView.	 XView is often said to be\n    the easiest toolkit to learn if you are not familiar with X Windows.\n    The XView toolkit is included in OpenWindows, and full source is\n    available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (and elsewhere).\n    The current version of XView from Sun is 3.0.\n    Despite rumours to the contrary -- some even from within Sun -- the\n    XView toolkit is *NOT* about to be dropped by Sun.  XView *will* be\n    included in the next release of OpenWindows, unlike NeWS.\n    On the other hand, the XView toolkit is not likely to receive as much\n    attention from Sun in the future as OLIT.\n\n    The NeWS Toolkit (TNT) was an object-oriented programming system based\n    on the PostScript language and NeWS.  TNT implements many of the\n    OPEN LOOK interface components required to build the user interface of\n    an application.  It's currently included in OpenWindows.\n\n    The current version of TNT from Sun is 3.1; Release 3 contains some\n    incompatibilities with `tNt' 1.0 and TNT 2.0, but Sun are committed to\n    supporting the API, at least until they stop NeWS support some time\n    later this year and replace it with Display PostScript.  Wail.\n    You might ask what `is committed to' means in this context; the\n    answer seems to be that it means absolutely nothing.\n    Sun currently asserts that it is committed to OLIT, however.\n\n    The C++ User Interface Toolkit (UIT) consists of an object-oriented C++\n    class library layered on top of XView and a tool to generate code from\n    DevGuide 3 GIL files.  The UIT also includes features that simplify\n    event management and the use of PostScript and color.  It is said to be\n    compatible with OpenWindows V2 and V3, and presumably V3.0.1, since the\n    release mentions that it works on Solaris 2.\n    UIT is not an official Sun-supported product but an ongoing project of\n    various people within Sun.  It can be found on export.lcs.mit.edu in\n    the MIT contrib directory as UITV2.tar.Z (use binary mode!).\n\n@ Where does Motif fit in?\n    It doesn't :-).  Motif is an alternative Graphical User Interface that\n    is being developed by OSF.	It has a `look and feel' reminiscent of\n    Microsoft Windows and the OS/2 Presentation Manager.  There are no non-\n    commercial Motif toolkits available, although the Motif source is sold\n    reasonably cheaply by OSF.	Although Motif is currently available on\n    more platforms than OpenWindows, the OPEN LOOK GUI is almost certainly\n    used on many more machines, simply because Sun (and SysVR4) have such a\n    large installed base.\n    Sun's CD/WARE Volume 2 contains a roadmap for improving Motif\n    applications by converting them to OLIT [:-)]; there are also notes in\n    the `Periodic Table' OLIT demo, $OPENWINHOME/demo/olittable.\n\n@ What is MoOLIT?\n    MoOLIT is a version of OLIT from AT&T/USL that lets users choose between\n    a Motif and an OPEN LOOK UI feel at run-time.  It will be part of System V\n    Release 4.2.\n    Contact: Joanne Newbauer, jo@usl.com, (908) 522-6677\n\n@ What about that Display PostScript thing?\n    Sun and Adobe have agreed that Sun will include the DPS extension to X\n    in the next release of OpenWindows.  DPS is essentially a badly designed\n    hack on top of a slow Level 2 PostScript interpreter intended to give a\n    very small subset of the functionality of NeWS whilst simultaneously\n    being harder to use, as I understand it.  The only real advantage it\n    has over NeWS is that the manual is much smaller, being generally less\n    complete; DPS is also available on more kinds of machine.\n    Performance on our RS/6000 is not suitable for interactive work;\n    what it will be like on the SPARCStation remains to be seen.\n    Note that whereas X/NeWS fonts are shared by both subsystems, the DPS\n    extension to X does _not_ make Type 1 PostScript fonts available to\n    ordinary X11 programs.  It is not like ATM on a PC in this regard.\n    (there is at least one third-party version which does make fonts\n    available, however)\n\nSubject: Window Managers -- olwm, olvwm\n\n@ What are olwm and olvwm?\n    They are window managers.  A window manager is the part of the X Window\n    system (e.g. X11) that is responsible for deciding how to lay out windows\n    on the screen, and for managing the user's interaction with the windows.\n\n    Olwm is the standard OPEN LOOK window manager.\n    It's included with all of the OpenWindows (q.v.) implementations, and\n    you can also get the source by ftp, since Sun donated it.\n\n    Olvwm is a version of olwm that manages a `virtual desktop' (hence the\n    `v' in its name).  It shows a little map on the screen, with the\n    currently displayed area represented by a little rectangle.	 You can\n    move around by dragging the rectangle or with the arrow keys.  This\n    lets you run several clients (applications) and move the display around\n    from one to the other.  Olvwm was derived from the OpenWindows 3.0 olwm\n    by Scott Oaks; you need to have XView 3.0 to compile it.\n    Get olvwm from an ftp site such as export.lcs.mit.edu (in the contrib\n    directory; there are three patches).\n\n@ Can I use my favorite window manager with OpenWindows instead of olwm?\n    Yes.  If you use twm, for example, or mwm, you won't be able to use\n    the Pin and Unpin feature of olwm, and you (probably) won't see the\n    footers some windows use to display certain messages.\n\n    If you use twm, you'll want to use the f.delete function to unpin menus\n    and get rid of programs that don't have a `quit' button when not run\n    under olwm.\n    For twm, put this in your $HOME/.twmrc:\n	LeftTitleButton "target" = f.delete\n    where "target" is a 16x16 icon from /usr/include/X11/bitmaps.\n    Alternatively, try\n	# Add a menu to each window managed by twm or tvtwm\n	LeftTitleButton ":menu" = f.menu "OL.menu"\n\n	menu "OL.menu" {\n	    "Quit"         f.delete\n	}\n\n    For mwm, you can double-click on the menu icon on the left of the title\n    bar to dismiss a pop-up window (I am told).\n\n    See the manual page for your window manager (twm, etc).\n\nSubject: OpenWindows, Terminals, and Other Displays\n\n@ Can I use olwm and olvwm without OpenWindows or on an X Terminal?\n    The OpenWindows xnews server combines SunView, NeWS (PostScript) and X11.\n    This means that it can run programs compiled for any of those systems.\n    Unfortunately, it means that some OpenWindows programs need either NeWS\n    or SunView support, and thus won't run on an X terminal.  This includes\n    pageview in particular.\n\n    You can use olwm or olvwm (see above) on an X terminal or a non-Open-\n    Windows display, and most OPEN LOOK clients (e.g. OLIT or XView ones)\n    will work perfectly well.  You may find that you get complaints about\n    fonts not being found.  If so, see the Fonts section below.\n    If you are running the window manager built-in to an NCD terminal, you\n    may have problems with input focus; setting *Input: True in the terminal's\n    XDefault file in /usr/lib/X11/xdm may or may not help.\n\n\nSubject: Configuration Files: Getting started with OpenWindows\n     \n@ What configuration files do I need to know about?\n\n    .xinitrc and .xsessionrc\n\n    The first time you run OpenWindows, a .xinitrc file will be created in\n    your login directory ($HOME).  If it already exists, you might have to\n    edit it somewhat; it's simplest to move it and any other old X11 files\n    you have to another directory, and then merge the old and new files.\n\n    If your site uses xdm, you should use .xsession instead of .xinitrc,\n    since xdm doesn't look at your .xinitrc file.\n\n    .openwin-init, .openwin-menu and .openwin-sys\n\n    These are optional files you can create in your $HOME directory,\n    depending on which version of olwm or olvwm you use.\n    Look in $OPENWINHOME/lib (normally /usr/openwin/lib) for these files\n    without the leading . and copy any you want to change.  You may need\n    to edit your .xinitrc to get them recognized.  If you are not on an\n    X terminal, you will want to run a console window (such as cmdtool -C,\n    shelltool -C, xterm -C) or Chuck Musciano's "contool" program so that\n    system output will be directed there instead of writing over your screen.\n    Note that .openwin-sys is not executed unless you edit .xinitrc.\n\n    .Xdefaults\n\n    You can put X Windows resource specifications in here.  In particular,\n    it is a good idea to include at least:\n	OpenWindows.FocusLenience:	true\n	*Input: TRUE\n    These allow non-ICCCM-compliant programs to receive input even if they\n    forget to ask for it.\n\n    Props, the program that runs when you select `properties' from the default\n    root menu under olwm or olvwm, writes your choices into .Xdefaults.\n    Don't put comments in .Xdefaults, since `props' deletes them.\n\n    .startup.ps\n\n    This is the NeWS user profile file, read by OpenWindows (actually xnews)\n    on startup.	 This is documented in the NeWS programming manual, near the\n    back.  The most useful thing to put here is PostScript code to change\n    the keyboard repeat rate, although you must be very careful, since a\n    syntax error in the PostScript means that xnews will either not start up\n    at all or will get broken in strange ways.	The NeWS manual gives code\n    that is both incorrect and insufficient.\n    WARNING: things in this file rarely work on both OpenWindows 2 and 3.\n\n    Note that the mouse speed is best set in your .xinitrc with xset m; see\n    the man page for xset ("man xset", and "xset -help") for more information.\n\n    Here's what $HOME/.startup.ps  should look like if you want a delay of\n    about a third of a second (300000 microseconds), and a repeat rate of\n    twenty or so keys per second (30000 microseconds between repeats) for\n    OpenWindows 3.  You'll have to experiment a bit because the RepeatTime\n    is the delay between keys sent, and thus doesn't include the time to\n    process each key, which is probably higher on my 4/110 than on your\n    SuperSPARC 10/51 GTi injection :-)  Again, this is for OpenWindows 3...\n\n	% don't want the demos - see p. xxxii of NeWS Toolkit Reference Manual\n	% /IncludeDemos? false def\n\n	UserProfile begin\n	    /KeyRepeatThresh 0 300000 timeval storetimeval def\n	    /KeyRepeatTime 0 30000 timeval storetimeval def\n	    % Note: 300000 and 30000 differ greatly...\n	end\n\n    You must also have a .user.ps file in the same directory, like this:\n\n	/NeWS 3 0 findpackage beginpackage\n	/TNTCore 3 0 findpackage beginpackage\n	/TNT 3 0 findpackage beginpackage\n\n	ClassRepeatKeys pop	% force repeat.ps to autoload\n\n	endpackage endpackage endpackage\n\n    If you change these parameters, you can test them without restarting the\n    OpenWindows server like this:\n	$ psh -i .startup.ps\n	Welcome to X11/NeWS Version3\n	$ psh -i\n	Welcome to X11/NeWS Version3\n	/classinit ClassRepeatKeys send\n	%%% now press control-D\n\n    You can also either of these two files (.startup.ps and .user.ps) to make\n    the root window be "retained", so that a PostScript drawing on the\n    background won't be erased when you move windows:\n	frambuffer /Retained true put\n    will do this.  Note that this may increase the amount of memory used\n    by the NeWS server (xnews) dramatically.\n    \n    See also:\n	Trouble Shooting: It Won't Let Me Type\n	Trouble Shooting: Is there an easy way to edit Xdefaults?\n	Environment Variables\n\n@ How can I configure OPEN LOOK for a left-handed mouse and keyboard?\n    You can use xmodmap to change the mouse buttons, but be prepared for one\n    or two occasional surprises.  See also "man 7 xview" for a list of\n    keybindings you can change, at least for XView programs.\n\n    With OpenWindows 2.0, you can use defaultsedit to set the mouse mappings\n    and then let SunView handle them.  The status returned by svenv should\n    tell you whether your server is running under SunView or not; put this\n    in your .xinitrc:\n\n    if eval `svenv -env`\n    then\n	xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 2 3"\n	input_from_defaults\n    else\n	xmodmap -e "pointer = 3 2 1"\n    fi\n\n\n@ How can I get the screen to go blank when the system is idle?\n\n    Run screenblank from /etc/rc.local if you can; it's a boring but\n    effective screen saver.  See `man screenblank'.\n    Under Solaris 2 you'll need to copy screenblank from an older system, as\n    it's not supplied.  Then add a new file in /etc/rc2.d to make the system\n    run screenblank automatically.\n\nSubject: Key Bindings, Cut and Paste\n\n@ How do I cut and paste between XTerm and OpenWindows programs?\n\n    To go from XTerm to textedit (say):\n    * Select the text you want to copy by dragging the SELECT mouse button\n      in xterm\n    * Press COPY in the XTerm (this key is L6, or Meta+c (the O'Reilly\n      XView manual gets this wrong)\n    * Move to the textedit window, and press PASTE (L8 or Meta+v)\n\n    If this doesn't work, see Trouble Shooting: Cut and Paste\n\n   To go the other way, from textedit to XTerm:\n    * Select the text in textedit.  No need to use COPY\n    * Move to the XTerm window and press ADJUST (the middle mouse button).\n    * You can also use the COPY/CUT and PASTE buttons.\n\n@ COPY/PASTE is boring.	 What short-cuts are available?\n\n    Quick Copy within textedit, mailtool, etc:\n    * Click SELECT to get a text caret where you want the copied text to go\n    * Press and HOLD DOWN the PASTE (or CUT) button\n    * Select the text you want to copy/move.  You'll see that it's underlined\n      or crossed out, as appropriate.  (In the jed demo it goes grey)\n    * Let go of the PASTE (or CUT) button.\n    * The text you underlined or crossed out appears at the insert caret.\n\n    Drag and Drop to Move a Selection\n    * Select the text you want to copy or move, by dragging or multiple-\n      clicking the SELECT or ADJUST mouse button\n    * Put the mouse pointer anywhere within the selection\n    * Press and HOLD DOWN down the SELECT mouse button, and move the mouse\n      pointer a little to the right; you'll see the cursor changes to be the\n      first 3 letters of the text (or some other icon).\n    * Still holding SELECT down, move the mouse over the point where you want\n      to drop the text\n    * You may see the mouse pointer change to a rifle-sight or target, to show\n      that it's OK to drop things here\n    * Let go of SELECT, and the text is moved.	This works in text fields of\n      dialogue boxes as well as in text subwindows.\n\n    Drag and Drop to Copy a Selection\n    * This is the same as using Drag and Drop to Move a Selection, except that\n      you must hold the CONTROL key down as well as the SELECT mouse button.\n\n@ What are the default key bindings in textedit and elsewhere?\n\n    See the man page for textedit(1) for some of them.\n    In general, the editing/moving commands go in the opposite direction when\n    shifted - e.g. Ctrl+w deletes a word, and Ctrl+W deletes the word to the\n    right of the insert point.\n\n	Meta-i - include file	    Meta-f - find selection (forward/backward)\n\n	Ctrl-a - start of line	    Ctrl-< - back word\n	Ctrl-e - end of line	    Ctrl-> - forward word\n	Ctrl-w - delete word	    Ctrl-u - delete to start/END of line\n	Ctrl-Return - move to end/START of document\n\n    See the O'Reilly XView Reference Manual for a list of some of the default\n    keys; see also the olwm or olvwm manual page.\n\n@ What can I put in my .ttysrc?	 Where is it documented?\n\n    See the manual page for shelltool.\n\nSubject: Applications: Finding Out...\n    Contact SunSoft (or Sun) and ask for the Catalyst OPEN LOOK guide,\n    which lists over 200 pages of applications, and also the _huge_\n    Catalyst listing of products for Suns, updated six-monthly.\n\n    Sun's free CDWare CD/ROMs each contain demo versions of several popular\n    OPEN LOOK applications.  Often you can simply contact the vendor\n    concerned to have the license upgraded from demo, and receive the full\n    product documentation.\n\n    SunPICS produces a CD/ROM for NeWSPrint users, Printer's Pallate, which\n    contains NeWSprint drivers for a variety of printers and plotters, as\n    well as 600 scaleable fonts that you can license.\n\n    There is a separate FAQ posting in comp.windows.open-look that lists\n    a number of free and commercial aplications; mail lee@sq.com for a\n    copy, including OPEN LOOK UI Application List in the Subject for a\n    faster reply.\n\nSubject: DeskSet, Mailtool, Calendar Manager, etc.\n\n@ Is there a tty-based interface to cm (Calendar Manager)?\n    Yes, cm_delete, cm_insert and cm_lookup; these all have manual pages.\n    If "man cm_delete" doesn't work or gives strange messages, see under\n    Trouble Shooting: Strange Error Messages, below.\n\n@ How can I arrange to have my .signature included in my outgoing mail?\n    The best way is:\n    $ cd\n    $ cp /usr/lib/.textswrc .\n    $ chmod +w .textswrc\n    edit .textswrc (use vi, textedit, or whatever you prefer)\n    add the follwing:\n	KEY_RIGHT(3)    FILTER\n	cat ~/.signature\n    (you might need to change ~ to $HOME)\n\n    Now pressing R3 will insert your .signature file.\n\n\n\nSubject: Fonts\n\n@ Does OpenWindows support Type 1 PostScript fonts?\n    Yes, under either Solaris 2.0 or 2.1 (I'm not sure which).\n    Or, Not Yet, in other words.\n\n    If you have FrameMaker there is a utility to import them, I'm told.\n    The 57 fonts supplied with OpenWindows are fully hinted, though, and\n    comparing them to the Microsoft Windows and Apple TrueType fonts is\n    interesting...  The F3 font format is described in a publication from the\n    Sun OpenFonts group, listed in the Bibliography below.  Documentation on\n    the unbundled version of TypeScaler is also available from Sun OpenFonts.\n\n    You can buy F3 fonts from SunPICS, Monotype, Linotype, URW and probably\n    other major foundries.\n\n    SunPICS' NeWSPrint software supports Type 1 fonts.\n\n@ Improving font rendering time\n    Although the Sun type renderer (TypeScaler) is pretty fast, it's not as\n    fast as loading a bitmap :-).  You can pre-generate bitmap fonts for sizes\n    that you use a lot, and you can also alter and access the font cache\n    parameters.	 If you have a lot of memory you might want to increase the\n    font cache size.\n	$ psh -i\n	Welcome to X11/NeWS Version3 <--- psh will say this at you\n	currentfontmem =	% type this line ...\n	300	% and here's whai my server was using -- 300 Kbytes\n	1024 setfontmem\n	% Just to check:\n	currentfontmem =\n	1024\n    See pp. 328ff of the NeWS 3.0 Programmer's Guide.

Better still, pick up "contool" and run\n	that.  Get it from export.lcs.mit.edu in the contrib directory.  It\n	will monitor the console and open, flash its icon or beep when a\n	message appears; it's very easy to configure.\n\n    If "refresh" from the Workspace->Utilities menu doesn't make the messages,\n    go away...\n	a Sun with a cg4 frame buffer has two screens - you can move the\n	mouse off the right-hand (by default) edge of the screen and onto\n	a whole new (but monochrome) display, called ":0.1".  See the man.\n	page for openwin; I have a shell script that checks for this and,\n	if there's a /dev/cgfour0, does\n		openwin -dev /dev/cgfour0 -dev /dev/bwtwo0\n	If you are running X11 or OpenWindows 2, you might need to add this\n	to your .xinitrc or other startup file:\n	(\n	    eval `svenv -display unix:0.1 -env`\n	    olvwm -display unix:0.1\n	) &\n	Later releases of olwm and olvwm do this automatically.\n	You can also run switcher -e 0 to get rid of the messages.  Also, see\n	the note about contool, above.\n\n@ Is there an easy way of editing .Xdefaults?\n    Use `props', which appears in the default root menu as `properties'.\n    This starts `props', a property editor which will re-write your\n    .Xdefaults after removing comments.  It then applies any changes.\n    Keep comments by using "comment." instead of "!", for example,\n	comment.*.font: Palatino-Italic-37\n\n@ How do I get the File manager to use emacs instead of textedit?\n    set the default editor to\n	sh -c "exec emacs -font lucidasanstypewriter-18 \"$FILE\""\n    (you can change the font if you prefer a smaller one)\n\n@ How do I run OpenWindows in inverse video?\n    This tends not to work under OpenWindows 2.	 With OpwnWindows 3.0,\n    there are various ways, including using -bg and -fg options.  If you're\n    using OpenWindows 2 on a Sun 3 , probably the best you can do (short of\n    upgrading the workstation to a SPARC!) is to use xterm instead of cmdtool.\n\n@ Why don't flat check-boxes work?\n    A known bug may make Guide's output dump core if you use these.\n    A workaround is to edit the Guide output, as it's only Guide's output\n    that's broken, not the actual check-box code.\n    This applies only to versions of DevGuide before Devguide 3.0.  If you're\n    still using an ancient DevGuide, you should upgrade as soon as possible;\n    the new one is fantastic!\n\n@ When I leave OpenWindows, my screen goes blank or my mouse cursor stays\n  on the screen.\n    Try running clear_colormap; if this helps, put it as the last line in\n    the shell script you use to start OpenWindows (e.g. `openwin').\n\n@ When I use snapshot, the system crashes, or the server hangs, or something.\n    This was a bug related to some systems only.  The only work-round was to\n    use some other screen dump program, such as xwd, xv 2.21 or xgrabsc.\n    \n@ Why have some of my function keys stopped working?\n    Keys F11 and F12 changed from SunF36 and SunF37 to SunXK_F36 and SunXK_F37\n    respectively in OpenWindows 3.  Applications must be recompiled, or you\n    might be able to use xmodmap or the public domain xkeycaps program to\n    change your keyboard layout back again.\n\n@ When I type shelltool or cmdtool or textedit, I get the Sunview version\n    See under "Trouble Shooting: Strange Error Messages" below.\n\n    (see also next item)\n\n@ Mixing X11 and OpenWindows\n    (see also next item)\n\n    Note that OpenWindows 3.0 includes the X11R4 core distribution (to patch\n    level 18), but not the contrib directory.  These notes apply to\n    OpenWindows 2.0, although you could also the do same sort of thing with\n    OpenWindows 3.0 and X11R5.\n\n    Install the X11 libraries in /usr/lib/X11.	You can intermix OpenWindows\n    and X11R4 or X11R5, they're all compatible in this respect.\n    Put the X11 binaries in (for example) /usr/bin/X11.\n\n    Put /usr/bin/X11 last in your PATH, so that you get OpenWindows versions\n    of programs instead of X11 ones where appropriate, although this is a\n    matter of preference.  In any event, put the OpenWindows bin directory\n    first -- see the preceding item for more details on that.  If you have\n    /bin (or /usr/bin, they're the same directory on SunOS) earlier in\n    your PATH than $OPENWINHOME/bin/xview, you'll get SunView programs instead\n    of OpenWindows ones!\n\n    Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that /usr/openwin/lib is last, after the X11\n    library directory.	This doesn't matter with OpenWindows 3.0, but with\n    older versions you'll get error messages from X11 programs if you don't\n    do this.  The messages are generally harmless (see next item), although\n    xdm core dumps if this isn't right.\n\n    Set OPENWINHOME to the directory containing OpenWindows if it isn't\n    /usr/openwin.\n\n    See Also:\n	Environment Variables (especially XFILESEARCHPATH).\n\n@ I get error messages on my screen about ld.so: libX11.so.4 not found\n    set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be /usr/openwin.  If you also use X11, use\n	     /usr/lib:/usr/5lib:/usr/openwin/lib\n    If you put this in a shell script or your .profile, use\n    ${OPENWINHOME-/usr/openwin}/lib instead of /usr/openwin; this is for\n    /bin/sh; for csh it is different.\n\n@ I launch my filemgr and I get ld.so:map heap error (9) at /dev/zero\n    Your system needs to be patched.  Look in $OPENWINHOME/lib/OSpatches\n    and install the patch.\n\n@ Why doesn't AnswerBook run for me?\n    You must be running OpenWindows to use AnswerBook.	It won't run under\n    X11 (on an X terminal or on anything else) because it uses NeWS to draw\n    the PostScript text and pictures.\n    If you are using OpenWindows 3.0, you need to use the OpenWindows 3.0\n    compatible navigator; it's called .navigator.ow3 on the AnswerBook CD/ROM.\n    If all AnswerBook users are using OpenWindows 3.0, you can replace\n    navigator wih .navigator.ow3 altogether (rename the old one first to\n    satisfy your sense of paranoia!)\n    The navigator.ow3 binary is also on CD/Ware Vol 2.\n    Note that the data files are in PostScript, so you can look at them with\n    a PostSript viewer (q.v.).\n\n@ Why aren't there any fish in realxfishdb?\n    A fixed version of realxfishdb is available by ftp from\n    ftp.eng.auburn.edu [131.204.10.91] as /pub/realxfishdb.Z\n\n@ Why is the Properties choice disabled in the Window menu?\n    It isn't implemented yet.  Many programs do respond to the Properties\n    Key (L3), though, or have a pop-up menu with Properties on it.\n\n@ File completion in the C-shell is broken in cmdtool\n    Sadly true, but use shelltool or xterm instead and it's fine.  It also\n    works if you run command tool on a remote machine.\n    Fixed in OpenWindows 3.0.1 shipped with Solaris 2.\n\n@ When I run OLIT programs, some of the widgets are red!\n    Release 3 of OLIT added mouseless operation; action widgets can be\n    selected via the keyboard.  The currently selected item is highlighted\n    in red (the `Red Stain') to show that it has the input focus.\n    To disable it in most places, add this to your $HOME/.Xdefaults file:\n	*traversalOn: off\n	*TextEdit.traversalOn: on\n	*TextField.traversalOn: on\n    You can change the color using (for example)\n	*InputFocusColor: grey50\n	*input*FocusColor: green\n	*List*inputFocusColor: <your background color>\n    See the man page resources(3w), at the start of the OLIT 3 Widget Set\n    Reference Manual included in the OpenWindows 3 programmer documentation.\n    Meanwhile contact your distributor and ask for patch id 100451-30, the\n    OLIT/3.0 CTE Jumbo Patch.\n\n@ When I run several programs, the colors on the screen all change when\n  I move into a different window! ("colormap flashing")\n    \n    This is becasue most hardware can only display a few colors at a time.\n    However, you can minimise the effect with the following procedure:\n    *  Start all the applications with colors that you wish to reserve.\n    *  Run\n	cmap_compact save\n       to create the .owcolors file\n    *  Put the line\n	cmap_compact init\n       near the start of your start-up file (.xinitrc)\n    *  Exit and then restart the window system.\n    *  cmap_compact init will push those colors .owcolors to the end of\n	the colormap and reserves them.\n\n    Also note that control-L2 locks the colors of the current window, and\n    Control-L4 unlocks them -- this is described in the olwm manual page.\n\n@ pageiew uses the wrong colors, or makes the colormap flash (see above):\n    This problem was reported by people for some reason running the Motif\n    window manager (mwm) with OpenWindows.\n    Try running pageview like this:\n	$OPENWINHOME/bin/reservecolors -svmono\n	$OPENWINHOME/bin/pageview\n	$OPENWINHOME/bin/reservecolors -discard\n\n@ XDM breaks things\n    Command tool doesn't like being run without a Unix `controlling terminal'.\n    Use /etc/setsid to start your command tools and all will be well.\n    SunView applications may need to be run with svenv, as in\n	svenv -exec /usr/bin/traffic\n    because xdm won't set the necessary environment variables.\n    Note that the MIT xdm starts up the X server as root, which is a security\n    hole for OpenWindows; use the OpenWindows 3.0 xdm or be aware that your\n    users can access files and start Unix processes ass root...\n\n@ Function keys 11 and 12 stopped working\n    In OpenWindows 3.0, the X11 names ("keysyms") for these keys was changed\n    to SunXK_F36 and SunXK_F37.

Hi,\n\nI'm trying to get my program to monitor resize/position events,\nso that when the program exits, I can save the last known geometry in \nsome sort of 'preferences' file.\n\nI am adding an event handler for StructureNotify to the TopLevelShell:\n\n XtAddEventHandler(topLevel,StructureNotifyMask,False,configureCB,myData);\n\nThis works fine, and my callback is called whenever the window is resized\nor repositioned using the window manager (mwm).\n\nHowever, when I'm just resizing the window, using any resize handle on the\nwindow manager resize decoration, the x and y are set to zero in the\nXEvent passed to the event handler callback.  I'm accessing the xconfigure\nstructure, like the X11 manual says.  (xev->xconfigure.x, xev->xconfigure.y).\nThe width and height memebers are correct.\n\nWhen I reposition the window, using the window manager, the xevent's xconfigure\nstructure contains all the correct x, y, width, height member settings.\n\nQ1: Anybody know why, when just resizing, the x and y are being set to zero?\n\nQ2: Any other way to handle detecting and saving geometry changes?\n\nI've tried using XtGetValues() on the topLevel widget when exiting my\napplication (before destroying any widgets) and all I get is garbage values\nfor the x, y, width, height resources.\n\nThanks\n--

I am writing a X-based dosemu which requires XKeyReleasedEvent. \nI found the keycode of XKeyReleasedEvent is wrong.   If I run the program on\na Linux host(XFree1.2) with  DISPLAY set to the local Linux and to\nthe Sun host (X11R5), the two keycodes from the two Xservers are different. \nOf course, the keycode of XKeyPressedEvent is O.K.\n\nCan anybody verify this ?

Get ghostscript and ghostview.  Ghostview is a postscript previewer\nthat uses ghostscript.\n\nFrom the ghostview README:\n\n\n\n    Ghostview -- An X11 user interface for ghostscript.\n\nGhostview is full function user interface for ghostscript 2.4.\n\nBrief list of features:\n  - Ghostview parses any known version of Adobe's Document Structuring\n    Conventions.\n  - Page size is automatically determined from the Document Structuring\n    Comments.  The user is able to override the values from the comments.\n  - Window size is set to the bounding box for Encapsulated PostScript figures.\n  - Default page size is Letter and can be changed via Xresources or\n    application defaults file to A4 (or any other valid size) for our\n    European friends.\n  - Scrollbars appear when necessary.\n  - Page orientation is automatically determined from the Document Structuring\n    Comments.  The user is able to override the values from the comments.\n  - Ability to view at 4 orientations: Portrait, Landscape, Upside-down,\n    and Seascape (for those who rotate landscape the other direction).\n  - Ability to preview in any supported visual.  (Can preview in gray-scale \n    or color on a Color monitor.)\n  - Ability to mark pages for printing, or saving.  (Good for people that\n    printed a 100 page document and lost page 59 due to a printer jam.)\n  - Can popup zoom windows at printer resolution\n    (1 display dot = 1 printer dot).\n\n    The Ghostview distribution includes a Ghostview Widget that people\n    are encouraged to use in other programs.\n\n    Ghostview-1.3 is available via anonymous ftp from:\n        prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/ghostview-1.3.tar.Z\n        appenzell.cs.wisc.edu:/pub/ghostview-1.3.tar.Z\n\n\nFrom the ghostscript README:\n\n*****************************************************\n* This file describes version 2.4.1 of Ghostscript. *\n*****************************************************\n\n********\n******** An overview of Ghostscript ********\n********\n\nGhostscript is the name of a set of software that provides:\n\n        - An interpreter for the Ghostscript language, which very\nclosely resembles the PostScript (TM) language; and\n\n        - A set of C procedures (the Ghostscript library) that\nimplement the graphics capabilities that appear as primitive\noperations in the Ghostscript language.\n\nThe Ghostscript language interpreter and library are written entirely\nin C, with some assembly-language accelerators for MS-DOS platforms.\nCurrently, Ghostscript is known to run on the following platform\nfamilies:\n\n        - IBM PC and compatibles with EGA, VGA, SuperVGA, or compatible\n          graphics under MS-DOS 3.1, 3.3, or 5.0;\n\n        - A wide variety of Unix systems using X Windows version 11,\n          release 3, 4, and 5, including Sun-3, Sun-4, Sun-386i,\n          Sun SPARCStation 1; generic 80386 machines running 386/ix;\n          H-P 9000/300 and 9000/800; DECStation 2100 and 3100; VAX\n          running Ultrix; Sequent Symmetry; Convex C1 and C2;\n          Tektronix 4300; SGI Iris Indigo;\n\n        - Sun workstations (Sun-3, SPARC, Sun-386i) running SunView;\n\n        - VAX, VMS with X11R3/4/5, gcc and DEC C compiler (DEC C compiler\n          version 3.1 or later is required).\n\n\n(Get ghostscript from the same ftp site you get ghostview.)
This discussion on viewing .ps files undex X11 seems rather interesting\nbut I fail to understand the reason it is not contained in 2 at most\nnewsgroups.\n\nI am subscribed to comp.text.interleaf and I could care less about\n.ps viewing under X11. I am sure that members of this group interested in\nthe topic can followup by looking at other newsgroups.\n\nCould you please remove the comp.text.interleaf from your distribution?\nJust as a nettish sort of courtesy.\n\nBest regards.\n\n-- \nLeo J Irakliotis               irakliot@longs.lance.colostate.edu

I understood that there are two methods to connect application code to widgets:\n\n                       callbacks and actions\n\nThe problem I face now is that I have a quite long piece of application code\nthat performs a lot of drawing into a window. I want to connect this to a\nwidget. No problem so far. I could use a callback function or an action to do this, processing any events afterwards.\n\nBut because the drawing takes some while, I want the application code sequence\nto be able to be interrupted by events. Then I want to handle the events\nand resume with processing the application code at the point it was\ninterrupted.\nIt seems to me that this isn't possible, but how can I give the user the\nimpression that his inputs are immediately processed ?\n\nHas anybody an idea?\n\nPlease answer via e-mail.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nSoenke\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSoenke Voss                                                Faculty of Economics\nsoenke@wiwi12.uni-bielefeld.de                          University of Bielefeld\n                                                             W-4800 Bielefeld 1\n                                                                        Germany\n\nThe only difference between me and a madman is\nthat I am not mad !

I would appreciate any help in this \nregard. Thanx.\n\n	- Mahendra.\n\nPS : Please mail your replies to me as I am not a regular reader of this \nnews group. I will post a summary if there is sufficient interest.\n\n--
One usual suggestion is to put everything into your every-time shell rc-file\ninstead of your login-only one, which is fair enough if you only have a few\nusers who know what they're doing.  If you have several hundred users who do\nwhat the books tell them, though, then it's confusing at best.  Another is to\nhave your xterms run login shells, but that still leaves the window manager\nand the things that get started from its menus with the wrong environment.\n\nOur alternative is that instead of having xdm run the client startup scripts,\nit runs the user's favourite shell as a login shell, and has *it* then run the\nrest of the startup scripts.  That way the user's usual environment gets set\nup as normal and inherited by everything.  You can find an almost-current copy\nof our scripts and things in contrib/edinburgh-environment.tar.Z, available\nfrom the usual places.
I had exactly the same feeling.  I was depressed.  If you ever programmed\nWindows and X11, you'd be depressed if an X conference touted its tutorials\nto show you how to convert from X to Windows API.  Sort of like, "how to\nconvert your C++ classes to the new, improved C."\n\nWhat happened?
Hello X'ers\n\nI have a problem: I am not able to create a window with 24 bit planes. The\nfollowing code illustrates the problem:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <X11/Xlib.h>\n#include <X11/Xutil.h>\n\nmain()\n{\n        Display *display;\n        Window win;\n        XVisualInfo vinfo;\n        Colormap colormap;\n        XSetWindowAttributes attributes;\n        XEvent event;\n        Status status;\n\n        display=XOpenDisplay(NULL);\n        status=XMatchVisualInfo(display,DefaultScreen(display),24,TrueColor,\n                &vinfo);\n        if (!status){\n                fprintf(stderr,"Visual not found\n");\n                exit(1);\n        }\n        colormap=XCreateColormap(display,DefaultRootWindow(display),\n                vinfo.visual,AllocNone);\n\n        attributes.colormap=colormap;\n\n        win=XCreateWindow(display,DefaultRootWindow(display),0,0,100,100,\n                0,24,InputOutput,vinfo.visual,CWColormap,&attributes);\n        XMapWindow(display,win);\n        for (;;){\n                XNextEvent(display,&event);\n        }\n}\n\nI tried this with an SGI with 24 plane TrueColor server, and with an HP\n9000-700 24 plane DirectColor server (with the obviously neccessary change),\nboth running X11R4. On the client side, I have tried with X11R4 Xlib on\nHP 9000-700 and DECstation, and with X11R3 Xlib on DECstation. All the\ncombinations gave BadMatch error on the CreateWindow request.\n\nAs far as I can tell from the manual, the only attribute which may give\na BadMatch, is the colormap, if it belongs to a wrong visual. But the\nvisual was correctly matched, as I did not get the error message. What\nam I doing wrong? For information I can tell that xwud aborts with the\nsame error.\n\n                                   Karsten\n--
Due it seems to Sun's crapulous organisation of the X libraries and includes,\nmost standard (GNU and other) software won't compile out of the box (well, tar\nfile). \n\nRight now I'm trying to make ghostview. It complains it can't find X11/XaW/...\nso I just linked (ln -s) the files from /usr/openwin/share/include/X11 and \nnow the ghoddam thing _still_ complains it can't find them.\n\nI still haven't been able to compile xdvi, not no way.\n\nHas anyone _ever_ managed to get _anything_ normal to compile on a Sun\n(SunOS 4.1.3 and OpenWindows 3)? What's the trick I'm missing? I've even \ntried hard copying all the relevant files into the "right" places and\nevery time, there's some bit missing or it refuses to find it.
Hi,\n\nis there any script/program/thelike already existing which could transform\nthe output of x11perfcomp (a huge table) into a nice 3d'ish diagram or\ngraph by producing postscript output from x11perfcomp input ?\n\nMaybe someone has already written such beast ...
REPOST:\n\nI have two questions (well probably more...) about how Expose & Configure\nevents are handled.\n\nI have an appl. which uses 1 window to draw in.  Since I give the user the\ncapability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be\nresized, I made a translation table for the Expose & Configure events.\nThe Expose event calls my redraw method while the Configure event\ncalls my rescale method.  The rescale method invokes a "fake" Expose\nevent (actually just calls the redraw w/ an appropriate Expose struct)\nto draw the data.\n\nQuest 1.\nWhen the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R4 (running in either R4 or R5 env.)\nI get multiple (>4) redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size\nis changed.  I assume I'm getting cascading events.  Is that right?\nAny suggestions as to how to handle/trap events in a better way?\n\nQuest 2.\nWhen the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R5 I get no Expose events\nwhatsoever.  Do events and/or translation tables act differently in R5?\n\nThanks in advance

Take a look at TeleUSE, a complete UIMS from Alsys (formerly TeleSoft).\nIn the US, you can reach them at (619) 457 2700.\n\nAlsys have an VMS version of TeleUSE v2.0.5 for VMS V5.5 or higher,\nbuilt using DECwindows Motif 1.0 (based on X11R4 and Motif v1.1.1).\n\nBTW, the VMS port from the UNIX version was made at my company, and was\nreleased in November 1992.

[stuff deleted]\n\nThe colormap element of SetWinAttrib must be a legitimate TrueColor\ncolormap. So, use XCreateColormap() with the proper visual and use it\nin SetWinAttrib (and don't forget the mask!).\n\nAnd the inevitable caveat: I usually use widgets, setting the visual\nand colormap resources rather than direct X routines, so I could be\nwrong. But, I think this is the general difficulty.

Since I don't think Tom always gets time to read this group, I'll take the\nliberty of responding to some of this.  If you really want Tom to reply\nyou should send mail to support@qdeck.com.\n\nA 64k line is certainly going to restrict you far more than the 10mbps\nethernet that we typically run.  How restrictive it will be depends on \nwhat you run and how you run it.  I would think that a couple of instances\nof some really nasty program like "Smoking Clover" would make the link \nuseless for anyone else.  On the other hand, probably 50 xclocks quietly\nupdating every 10 seconds or so wouldn't impact it too much.  In the real\nworld, you will be somewhere in between these two extremes.\n\nGoing by the way I personally use X on a daily basis, I wouldn't want to have\nto share that 64k link with more than 3-4 other people.\n\n\nOur corporate WAN is as unique as any other.  The usage patterns are not very\ngood predictors of how yours will behave.  The only one of our low bandwidth\nlinks that normally get used in this way is a 56k link to Ireland that they\noften use to run a DOS text based client end of a client-server database \nremotely from the DVX machine behind me. Since the server end is (or was) always\nat this end (California) it is faster to remotely run the client via DESQview\nX and have a short hop to the server than running the client locally and having\na long hop to the server.  As I warned you, this tells us very little about\nhow you usage pattern will fill a 64k ISDN link.\n\nRunning Word for Windows remotely is going to itself be very usage dependent.\nLet's break it into pieces and look at it.  Tracking the mouse pointer is easy\nand efficient to translate from Windows calls into X. Popping up a menu is a\nlittle more involved and will generate some traffic.  Restoring the screen\nthat was covered by that menu may be easy and may not be.  Does the server\nthat it's displaying on have backing store?  If so and the server had enough\nmemory the display can be updated locally and will generate little network\ntraffic. If no backing store, then what was being covered up?  If it was a \nsolid colored rectangle of space we can tell your xserver to draw that quite\neasily.  If it was a full color backdrop of Ren & Stimpy we may have to send\nit back to the X server bit by bit.  DVX will do its level best to only redraw\nthat small area, but in some unusual cases the entire screen may need to be \nrepainted.  Assuning a 1024x768 screen with 4 bits per pixel that's 3145728 bits\nthat has to be sent.  Worst possible case you're looking at about 50 seconds.\nIn reality it would never be this bad since the screen will always have parts \nthat will be tranlatable into higher level X calls.\n\n\nX was designed from the ground up to be efficient across a network.  It's \npretty good for this.  X programs are best, DOS text programs are almost\nas good (since we conert them to X easily).  Something like WinX is a hybrid.\nWe intercept the calls Windows makes to it's graphics driver/ mouse driver\nkeyboard driver and convert them to X.  The calls Windows is making are in\nno way designed to be efficient on a packet switched network.  We go to a \nlot of trouble to convert them to the highes level Xlib calls we can, but\nwe are somewhat limited because we only know what Windows and its applications\ntell us.
I have placed a new release of my aXe editor in aXe-5.0.tar.Z on\nexport.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1).\n\nThe significant change this time, and the justification for the hike\nin the major version number, is:\n\n  o undo has been implemented.\n\n    By default only the last change can be undone, but a resource is\n    provided to allow the user to specify how many, including unlimited,\n    levels of undo information should be kept. Also, undo of undo is\n    supported.\n\nThere is no truth in the rumour that the next version will be EmaXe 19 :-)\n\n                          -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFor those who have not encountered aXe before here is a summary of\nwhat it is all about:\n\naXe is a simple to use text editor for X that represents a significant\nimprovement over xedit. Also built around the Athena Text Widget it\nfeatures, amongst other things,\n\n   o multiple windows\n   o multiple buffers\n   o default menu interface\n   o optional button interface, with choice and layout of buttons \n     under user control\n   o minibuffer for expert use and access to external filters\n   o provision for defining a keyboard macro\n   o geometry specification and resizing in terms of characters\n   o file selection via a browser\n   o knowledge of line numbers\n   o parenthesis matching\n   o regular expression searching\n   o restricted or unlimited undo\n   o ability to change font\n   o easy entry of control codes\n   o xterm-like keymap feature\n   o easy runtime setting of selected preferences (resources)\n   o both brief and comprehensive on-line help\n   o server mode with cooperating client programs\n   o optional extension language using Tcl\n   o optional Xaw3d widget set compatability\n   o collection of reusable widgets that embody the functionality of aXe\n\nI have personally built and run core aXe, i.e. without the Tcl and\nXaw3d options, on the following systems:\n\n   Sun SPARC        SunOS 4.1.x     MIT X11R5\n   Sun SPARC        SunOS 5.1       MIT X11R5\n   Encore Multimax  UMAX 4.3        MIT X11R5\n   DEC 5000/120     ULTRIX 4.2      MIT X11R5\n   HP 9000/710      HP-UX 8.07      MIT X11R5\n   MAC IIci         AU/X 3.0        MIT X11R5\n   \nbut not all have been subject to the same level of testing. I have\nonly tested the Tcl and Xaw3d options on the first.\n\nA number of '#ifdef SYSV'-isms that have been fed back to me have been\nincorporated into the code and a possible scandir replacement is\nprovided for those systems that do not have one.\n\nAlthough aXe will probably build under R4 run-time problems have been\nencountered in the past. I have not bothered to try this version under\nR4, and have not put any effort into solving previously known\nproblems.  Therefore, if you are at R4 you very much take pot luck. If\nit doesn't work the only alternative is to try the last release,\n2.1.1, of version 2 which should still be around. It doesn't have as\nmany features and uses the Widget Creation Library (Wcl). Not only\nthat, it requires an old version of Wcl, 1.06 or 1.05. Version 3 of\naXe was nearing completion when version 2 of Wcl came out so aXe 2\nnever got converted to make use of it.\n\naXe is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12)\nand arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1) initially, and probably in due\ncourse from several other ftp sites.  Check your nearest using\nxarchie.\n\nIf you can't ftp, try sending email to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com with the\nword "help" alone in your message body.  You will receive instructions\non how to ftp via email.\n\nJim

I've spent the past week tearing my hair out, trying to get the output of\na piped "tail -f" to end up in a widget.  I've managed to make it work in\nsome ugly ways, but either a) X blocks on the tail and won't allow user\ninput, b) the "tail -f" functions like just "tail" and doesn't follow the\nexpansion of the file, c) the "tail -f" doesn't die after I've closed\nthe pipe and destoryed the widget, or d) pclose() blocks forever waiting\nfor tail to die.\n	I _know_ this code has to exist.  Anybody have it?  A general\npopen() case would be perfered but at this point I'll take anything...\nThanks.

We are adding a Motif wrapper to a family of data display programs.\n\nThese programs are each written as a 'main loop' with these steps:\n- use semop to check a semaphore and if true access new data\n  otherwise block (new data comes quite often)\n- use msgop to check for messages and if true read them\n  otherwise continue (messages are user commands and not often)\n- update the display according to latest data and messages.\n\nWe typically have several of these running in windows,\nplus a data producer serving some device and setting the flag.\nEveryone blocking makes sure the device server gets to run.\n\nXt and Xm also have a 'main loop' model that we must fit into.\nO'Reilly Vol IV Ch 9 discusses adding a file-watcher and also\nhow to add workprocs that are run during idle time.\n\nWe can 'open-up' our existing main loop and call it as a workproc.\nThe problem is our blocking until new data is no longer appropriate.\nNeither is letting the program free-run because others are hurt.\n\nThe unix select call lets you block until any of several i/o are ready.\nWe want that for the X main loop except not file i/o.\nAny suggestions or examples most welcome!\n\nWe run SGI Personal Iris and Indigo systems.

Our group is interested in using a 'pixmap' format for multi-colored\nicons/buttons etc that is easily converted to and from other format from\n'resource' files. Using pbmplus we can easily move to/from Xpm to our other\nenvironments of MS-Windows and OS/2 PM :-(. We were wondering if Xpm or some\nother format is under consideration to be used as a standard by the X\nconsortium for R6 as we would prefer to use whatever will be best supported by\nX. \n\nAlong the same subject line, is the reason the standard X pixmap is not used\nbecause it doesn't have an associated colormap and other attributes? or is it\nmore involved? just wondering why there aren't editors for pixmaps out there\nfor the 'original' format.\n\nEmail replies preferred. Thanks in advance.
Hi,\n\nI've tried to get rid off XDM's ugly Login window by giving it a 'cool'\nbackgroundPixmap ressource. As Login is derived from Core, this should be\npossible. Anyway, setting xlogin*backgroundPixmap:/a/b/c.xpm did not\nproduce any message of the form 'cannot convert String to Pixmap' and\nexplicitely registering such converter lead to nothing, too.\n\nAny way to do it ?
I've found a problem in the use of Xlib functions regarding re-entrancy. I\ndecided to implement an animated cursor (using 6 created cursors) by calling\nXDefineCursor from a SIG_ALRM signal handler. This is used to indicate we are\nwaiting for a operator request to complete. (on a production control system).\nI was redrawing the screen underneath the animated cursor and then restoring\nthe standard cursor when complete. I found dumped core , and upon analysis\nit was when the SIG_ALRM handler was called during a XDrawString call. XDrawString\nwas doing a bcopy (presumably an internal structure) when the XDefineCursor\nwas called. Presumably the (internal) structure that XDrawString was manipulating\nwas not in a stable state and sent XDefineCursor to where it shouldn't have been.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? Is there any official documentation that\nsays you should ensure this doesn't happen? Or should bcopy() be atomic.\nWe are running on SGI Irix 4.0.1 with X11R4.\n\n\n\n-- \nRegards, Martin
Thanks to Bruce Barnett, who recommended xvttool, and Bernward Averwald and\nLiam Quin, who recommended modifying .Xdefaults to get the desired behavior\nfor a *class* of xterms.\n\nIn xvttool, simply create a key file that looks like:\n"a"	"A"\n"b"	"B"\n"c"	"C"\n...\nand specify said key file on the command line.  This will translate\nany input into any other (in my case, lo-case to up-case).  Works great, and\nyou get a customizable button-pad on the right or left side.\n\nTo use an xterm solution, add to your .Xdefaults:\ncapxterm*VT100.Translations: #override \\n   <Key>a: string("A")\n\\n   ...\n\nor:\ncapxterm.vt100.translations: #override \n\\n        <Key>a: insert-string(A) \n\\n        <Key>b: insert-string(B) \n\\n        ...\n\nand invoke as: xterm -name capxterm\n\nThanks loads!

I have a SPARC-2 with 2 CGSIX cards in it.  I'd like\nto have the R5 server recognize the second card.\n\n\nI mknod created a /dev/cgsix1 device, but when I brought up the\nserver, the second device was ignored.  \n\nHow do I setup the second card?\n\n\nNote:  If I borrow a cgthree card, and put a cgthree and\na cgsix card in the same SPARC-2 box, the R5 server finds\nthe second card. I then set the DISPLAY to the\nsecond card, and start a second window manager.  \n\nWorse case is I trade cards with someone, but maybe someone\nout there has seen this problem already...\n\n\nemail is preferred... post if you must...\n\nThanks in advance....\n\n\nJim
i want to do something like this:\n\n  date | xcb -s 0 | xcutsel\n\nto get the output of the date command put into the XPRIMARY selection.\nunfortunately, xcutsel is an interactive little bugger and there isn't a\ncommand argument to tell it to just do it and not put up its little\nwindow.  so, is there some other command that i CAN use like this?  or,\nis there an analog to xcb that will put stuff in XPRIMARY instead of cut\nbuffer 0?

Yesterday I changed the US-Keyboard of my Sparc10 with a german keyboard.\nAnd now I cannot get any "Alt Graph" characters ('tilde' usw.).\nWhen I exit from X I can get the characters, but not under X.\n\nCan anybody give me some hints, where to check for the correct installation\nof the keyboard.
This would be tedious, but if you have the time you could get the .bdf\nfile (I can email it to you if you don't have it or don't have easy access \nto the X source), and could make your own bold font from this.  Since each\nglyph is just a bitmap, you could write a program to convert each\nglyph to a bitmap-readable file, use bitmap to make each glyph "bold", and\nconvert the results back to .bdf format.  Then, use "bdftopcf" to create\nthe .pcf file.  Then, stick the .pcf in /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc (or wherever)\nand include it in fonts.dir and, voila, you'll have what you need!
If you already own all the "clone" equipment then there are lots of such\nprograms (see a current copy of Unix World Magazine).\n\n*BUT*  your performance WILL suck lemons running an Xserver on a clone.\n(From experience).  You would be much better off with an Xterminal if this\nis a new install.  The performance will be at least four times better.\nIn addition it would be MUCH easier to install and use.  On top of that\nthey will cost about the same (price a clone with 4MB RAM, ethernet card,\nvery high performance graphics card, GOOD monitor, server software, TCP/IP\nfor clone software, mouse, keyboard, etc, etc, etc.... you spend a whole\nlot of $$$$).\n\nI can get 15" Tektronix XP11 terminals for under $900, and the performance\nis over 80000 Xstones.....

Hi!\n\n	I have a question which is not directly related to X Screen Saver.\n\nWhat X Screen Saver does is to blank the screen if it has been idle for\nsome time.  I don't want my screen to go blank but to get locked or call\nxlock program.\n\n	Is there a parallel call to XSetScreenSaver() which locks my screen\nor call my lock program after certain amount of idle time?  Or is there a\nway to find out how long the server has been idle?

At the moment, it\nis difficult to get phone calls returned and otherwise obtain info.\nHopefully they will post something about themselves once things settle down. \n\n	Visual Solutions\n\n	LIBWXM is a product that I just heard about.  They don't\nyet support MDI or MFC.  Libwxm was used to port VisSim, a mathematical\nmodeling package.  Does native Motif Widgets, like Wind/U from Bristol.\nContact Carrie Lemieux at 508 392 0100 for more info.  She's very helpful.\n\n	MainSoft\n\n	This translates Windows source to a Unix executable that\ncan switch off between a Windows or Quasi-Motif look and feel at\nruntime.  They skip the Xt and Xm (Motif) X toolkit levels and go\nstraight to Xlib.  They don't yet support MFC.  They're at 415 896 0708.\n\n	Bristol\n\n	This company that seems to be on the right track.  Wind/U uses\nXlib/Xt/Xm to give a *real* Motif app.  They seem to be doing the most work\nin trying to support things like DDE, Common Dialogs, and more on the horizon.\nMy contact there is knowledgeable, responds to my email, and wrote an example\nprogram for me showing how to obtain X widgets from Windows handles.\nThey're at 203 438 6969, or you can email info@bristol.com.
Hi, netters:\n\nWe have a problem with 'makedepend': it doesn't know how to correctly process\n#if clause in C preprocessor statements. It evaluates everything to\ntrue no matter what the conditionals are.\nFor example, makedepend chokes on one of X11 include files (as distributed\nby Sun) - namely Xos.h:\n\n#if     !defined(SUNOS41) || defined(__STDC__)\n#       include <string.h>\n#       define  index   strchr\n#       define  rindex  strrchr\n#else   /* BSD && !__STDC__ */\n#       include <strings.h>\n#endif  /* !SUNOS41 || __STDC__ */\n\nHere 'makedepend' evaluates both #if and corresponding #else statements\nto 'true' and tries to open the file <strings.h> which doesn't exist\nunder Solaris2.\nWe also have a lot of #if statements in some of our legacy code.\nWe got and built 'makedepend' off the net - it didn't fix the problem.\n\nIn all fairness it should be noted that 'makdepend' man-page (Sun's\ndistribution) mentions this problem:\n\nBUGS\n     If you do not have  the  source  for  cpp,  the  Berkeley  C\n     preprocessor, then makedepend will be compiled in such a way\n     that all #if directives will evaluate to  "true"  regardless\n     of  their  actual  value.  This may cause the wrong #include\n     directives to be evaluated.  Makedepend should  simply  have\n     its own parser written for #if expressions.\n\nHas anybody come up with some solution/fix to 'makdepend' other than\nWriteYourOwnParser... and willing to share it with us?\n\nSince we often experience delays in our newsfeed - please reply \ndirectly to my e-mail address -> I'll post a summary.

From my own notes on this subject....\n\nMethods to automatically passwd Authorization from one machine to another.\n  This also includes the problem of notifing the remote host of the current\nDISPLAY that is being used.\n\n1/ Use rsh/rexec/on...  (the method in the xauth manual)\n      Set up the your .rhosts file in the home directory on the remote\n  machine so that a password in not required to remotly execute commands.\n\n         xauth extract - $DISPLAY | rsh other xauth merge -\n\n  This method is also used by xrsh to pass authorization. My vampire\n  program also uses a variation, however I wrap it as part of the remote\n  command sequence  (EG:  xauth add $auth)\n\n     Included in this method is the use of `xrlogin' and `xrsh' to do\n  this job for you. These programs usally (the newer ones that is) allow\n  you to pass a secified list of ENVIRONMENT variables which includes\n  the `DISPLAY' and/or a copy of the authorization code required.\n\n     The `xon' program available (if enabled) on sun machines will also\n  pass environment variables, as well as the current directory.  You will\n  however be required to store the Authority in such a variable for\n  passing. Unless you are also have shared home directories.\n\n    WARNING: Environment variables and command line arguments are visible\n  in `ps' listing with the appropiate flags. As such passing authorization\n  information in environment variables or as arguments is not recomended.\n  The recommended method as given in the manual (shown above) is safe from\n  the view of other users.\n\n2/ Wrap it as part of the TERM environment variable.\n      This method uses the fact that most remote command executors do pass\n  the TERM environment variable to the remote host. It is then a matter of\n  an appropiate script in your remote .login file to extract the information\n  from the TERM environment variable and set up things appropiatly.\n    A version of the xrlogin script is available on the network which does\n  this. Basically you change the TERM environment variable before the\n  actual call to rlogin is performed, to include your DISPLAY and your\n  authorization.\n    On the remote machine you then extract this information and return the\n  TERM environment variable to normal BEFORE you use it for reseting or\n  stty'ing your terminal.\n\n  ---8<---\n  script for launching rlogin:\n    #!/bin/sh\n    # ~/bin/rl   --- Rlogin with display:\n    if [ -n "$DISPLAY" ]; then\n      case "$DISPLAY" in\n        :*) DISPLAY=`hostname`$DISPLAY ;;\n      esac\n      TERM="$TERM&$DISPLAY&`xauth nextract - $DISPLAY`"\n      export TERM\n    fi\n    rlogin $*\n  ---8<---\n  add to your .cshrc or .login\n    if ( $?TERM ) then\n      if ( `echo $TERM | tr -cd '&'` != '' ) then\n        echo "$TERM" | cut '-d&' -f3 | xauth nmerge -\n        setenv DISPLAY `echo "$TERM" | cut '-d&' -f2`\n        setenv TERM    `echo "$TERM" | cut '-d&' -f1`\n      endif\n    endif\n  ---8<---\n  xterm command to use\n    xterm -T hostname -e ~/bin/rl hostname\n  ---8<---\n\n3/ NFS.\n     Write it to a file on a shared NFS partition you have access to.\n   Note that if the home directories are NFS mounted, then authorization\n   is automatically passed, Hoever you will still have to pass your\n   DISPLAY environment variable via a file or other means. IE:\n\n      login host:       echo $DISPLAY > ~/.X11host\n      remote host:      setenv DISPLAY `cat ~/.X11host`\n\n4/ Finger for the info in a .plan file\n      This involves encrypting the information into your `.plan' or\n  `.project' and having the remote machine finger for the information.\n  This has the disadvantage of having the information to anyone fingering\n  the user.  Thus requiring a encryption method that is uniq to each\n  individual.  IE: the method of decyrption must not be shared or known\n  by others, nor should it be easy to determine.\n    A improvment is to use the `who fingered me' technique to only give\n  the information only to your own remote accounts and not just to anyone\n  who is asking.\n    This last method was developed last year by a second year here, untill\n  I explained to him the need for the encryption, at which point he gave\n  up this method. It is however a valid method. It is easer than (2) but\n  less secure.\n\n\n  Anthony Thyssen - (SysProg @ Griffith University)     anthony@cit.gu.edu.au\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    "Magic is Real -- unless declared an integer"  ---  John P.Melvin

Personally if I was in his position I would\n: do exactly the same thing, John has obviously put in lot of time and effort\n: into xv and why shouldn't he receive some money for it.\n\n: Just my pennies worth\n\n: (Keep up the good work John)\n\nYeah I agree..I am very impressed by the kind of effort that has gone into\nthe lastest release...some people are just looking for excuses to gripe..\nI personally feel that the work is worth much more that $25...after seeing\nthe kind of things people get paid for..
I don't seem to be able to get window positions reliably through\nthe XView xv_get() function:\n\n   x = (int) xv_get(my_frame, XV_X);\n   y = (int) xv_get(my_frame, XV_Y);\n\nFor example, if I set XV_X & XV_Y to 50,50 the frame comes up\nin the correct position, with the top left corner (the size\nhandle) at 50,50. xv_get() returns 50,50 as well. But later on\nxv_get() returns 5,25 without any intervening xv_set(my_frame,\nXV_?). My frame is fitted around a canvas, and it turns out\n(by measuring on the screen) that 5,25 is the position of the\nfirst pixel in my canvas relative to the frame's origin. What\ngives? Any help most appreciated!\n\nDerek\n\nP.S. On a related subject, is there any way of querying the\nwindow manager as to the thickness of borders it puts around\nframes, etc.?\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------
I have found a situation which I think is a bug in X or Motif, but I'm hoping\nis really just a mistake on my part.  Does anyone know anything about\nthis problem........\n\n- I am using an XmTextField, and setting its XmNvalue to a hardcoded\n  text string (ascii or Kanji) either via XtSetValues or XmTextSetString.\n  The problem is that when the XmTextField is displayed, the text is getting\n  truncated, depending on the setting of the environment variables\n  LANG (more specifically LC_ALL).  When they are set to japanese,\n  the text gets truncated.  When they are set to english, everything\n  works fine.  I am taking the default for XmNcolumns.\n  (Please note that hardcoding of text is NOT done in my actual\n   application, just in my sample code to make things easier)\n	\n- I am running Motif 1.2, X11R5 via HPUX9.01.  My test program is set up\n  to handle 16 bit Kanji characters.  I have remembered to do   \n  XtSetLanguageProc() prior to my MrmInitialize and my font resources\n  are set to japanese fonts.\n\n- Don't know if this matters, but my dialog box and TextField is initially\n  created with UIL. \n\n\nThe problem does NOT happen with XmText.  Unfortunately substituting\nXmTextFields with XmTexts in my application is not an acceptable\nalternative (way too much code to be modified while in beta!)\n\nI have a small test program which illustrates the problem if anyone\nwants it.  My best guess is that either the X code or Motif is not\nproperly allocating memory for japanese, but since I don't have the\nsource to look at it is just a guess.\n\nPlease let me know if this sounds familiar, or if you have a suggestion,\nor if you want the sample program.\n\nTHANKS!!!!!!!!\n\n- Susan

How can I draw an object of a specified color over objects of varying colors\n  and then erase it without having to redraw everything else?\n\n  What's happening is this,\n\n      If I draw it using GXcopy, it is drawn in the specified color.  If I erase\n      it using GXcopy with foreground and background reversed, it erases \n      whatever it overlayed.  I then need to redraw\n      all of the items it crossed.  Yuch.\n\n      If I draw it using GXinvert it is drawn in a random color - nothing \n      resembling what I requested.  It properly restores the color of \n      underlying objects in erase mode.\n\n  What's the solution?
I am working for a company which has only one connection to the Internet.\nThis is through a firewall gateway (unix workstation). I would like to be\nable to telnet to a host outside the company and set the DISPLAY to my PC\nwhich is running an X-terminal emulator (eXceed/W). The display can be set\nto the gateway workstation with no problem but when I set the variable to \nmy IP address I get a "Error: Can't open display" message. \n\nThis can't be that hard to work around can it?\n\nBTW I have no trouble running x-clients on local workstations (in the company)\nand having them display on my PC.
Show me the realistic price tag...\n\n\n\nNice, but way over $900....\nMy point is price/performance  not just performance...
Yes, Xhibition is for the X Window System.  The X Window System Conference \nremains the largest and most complete conference devoted to X.  Nineteen full\nand half day tutorials and thirty-six technical sessions over three days\nprovide huge amounts of information for X application developers.  Add vendor\nexhibits and a Product Presentation track to provide information on what\nfolks can purchase today, and you have a complete show focused on X11.\n\nSpeakers at Xhibition 93 include: \n\n  Bob Schiefler, Lu Abel, Mark Ackerman, Paul Asente, Doug Blewett, \n  Donna Converse, Jim Fulton, Oliver Jones, Keith Packard, Ralph Swick, \n  Doug Young, and many others.\n\nXhibition is growing (fortunately for us:-) and we have added some additional\nconferences.  Surveys that we have given have indicated additional topics of\ninterest.  These include: object oriented technologies such as the Object\nManagement Group's ORB and CORBA; C++ as it applies to X; client server\ntechnologies such as DCE; threads; databases- object oriented and relational;\nand (not surprisingly when you look at the audience) Windows NT.\n\nWith the bulk of the Xhibition audience (and the UNIX community) developing\napplications for in-house or custom use, a new 32-bit operating system from a\nplayer as large as Microsoft needs to be evaluated. With MS Windows on so many\ndesktops, and the price of computing power dropping, its successor needs to be\nevaluated.  As corporations begin to look at NT, so must their developers and\nsuppliers.\n\nThe mission of the Xhibition technical conferences is to provide information\nto the application developer and to the technology planner.  The NT Conference\nat Xhibition is designed to do just that.  We worked with Microsoft to provide\nthe *only* conference this year specifically designed to show X and UNIX\ndevelopers the capabilities of Windows and NT.  If you aren't sure that NT has\nwhat you need for your application development or systems deployment, this is\nthe place to find out.  Ask the folks from Microsoft, get them to show you\nwhat you need.  Conference attendees will receive NT Software Development\nKits- to bang on, evaluate, and generally to see for yourself.\n\nI hope this doesn't sound like an NT commercial (it should sound like an\nXhibition commercial:-).  I just want to reiterate that the Xhibition audience\nis growing and Xhibition is growing along with it.  The industry is a\nconfusing place at the moment with UNIX, COSE, NT, DCE, CORBA, and all of\nthe other acronyms sprouting up.  Xhibition can help sort out the confusion.\n\n\n-Aub Harden\n Technical Program Manager\n harden@ics.com\n\n\n        X H I B I T I O N   The Conference and Trade\n         ******    *****    Show for Corporate\n        *      *       *    Software Development\n         ******     ***  \n             *         *    201 Broadway\n          ***     *****     Cambridge, MA  02139\n\n              Windows on Distributed Computing\n\n                 June 7 - 11,   San Jose, CA\n\n           xhibit@ics.com  uunet!ics.com!xhibit\n        Voice: (617) 621-0060  Fax: (617) 621-9555

We have Suns running SunOS 4.1.3 and Openwindows 3.0 (X11R4). We have\nused Xvision on a PC, setup to broadcast query to the UNIX xdm servers and\nallow a user to choose a UNIX client in which to login: xdm will then\nmanage that display. I would like to do the same thing with xfree86\nrunning under Linux, but I don't know how. I don't want to hardwire the UNIX\nxdm to manage the PC displays as the PC's are not always running Linux \n(let alone xfree86). I would like the same setup as provided by Xvision.\n\nCan anybody help?\nThanks,

I have placed a new release of my aXe editor in aXe-5.0.tar.Z on\nexport.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1).\n\nThe significant change this time, and the justification for the hike\nin the major version number, is:\n\n  o undo has been implemented.\n\n    By default only the last change can be undone, but a resource is\n    provided to allow the user to specify how many, including unlimited,\n    levels of undo information should be kept. Also, undo of undo is\n    supported.\n\nThere is no truth in the rumour that the next version will be EmaXe 19 :-)\n\n                          -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFor those who have not encountered aXe before here is a summary of\nwhat it is all about:\n\naXe is a simple to use text editor for X that represents a significant\nimprovement over xedit. Also built around the Athena Text Widget it\nfeatures, amongst other things,\n\n   o multiple windows\n   o multiple buffers\n   o default menu interface\n   o optional button interface, with choice and layout of buttons \n     under user control\n   o minibuffer for expert use and access to external filters\n   o provision for defining a keyboard macro\n   o geometry specification and resizing in terms of characters\n   o file selection via a browser\n   o knowledge of line numbers\n   o parenthesis matching\n   o regular expression searching\n   o restricted or unlimited undo\n   o ability to change font\n   o easy entry of control codes\n   o xterm-like keymap feature\n   o easy runtime setting of selected preferences (resources)\n   o both brief and comprehensive on-line help\n   o server mode with cooperating client programs\n   o optional extension language using Tcl\n   o optional Xaw3d widget set compatability\n   o collection of reusable widgets that embody the functionality of aXe\n\nI have personally built and run core aXe, i.e. without the Tcl and\nXaw3d options, on the following systems:\n\n   Sun SPARC        SunOS 4.1.x     MIT X11R5\n   Sun SPARC        SunOS 5.1       MIT X11R5\n   Encore Multimax  UMAX 4.3        MIT X11R5\n   DEC 5000/120     ULTRIX 4.2      MIT X11R5\n   HP 9000/710      HP-UX 8.07      MIT X11R5\n   MAC IIci         AU/X 3.0        MIT X11R5\n   \nbut not all have been subject to the same level of testing. I have\nonly tested the Tcl and Xaw3d options on the first.\n\nA number of '#ifdef SYSV'-isms that have been fed back to me have been\nincorporated into the code and a possible scandir replacement is\nprovided for those systems that do not have one.\n\nAlthough aXe will probably build under R4 run-time problems have been\nencountered in the past. I have not bothered to try this version under\nR4, and have not put any effort into solving previously known\nproblems.  Therefore, if you are at R4 you very much take pot luck. If\nit doesn't work the only alternative is to try the last release,\n2.1.1, of version 2 which should still be around. It doesn't have as\nmany features and uses the Widget Creation Library (Wcl). Not only\nthat, it requires an old version of Wcl, 1.06 or 1.05. Version 3 of\naXe was nearing completion when version 2 of Wcl came out so aXe 2\nnever got converted to make use of it.\n\naXe is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12)\nand arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1) initially, and probably in due\ncourse from several other ftp sites.  Check your nearest using\nxarchie.\n\nIf you can't ftp, try sending email to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com with the\nword "help" alone in your message body.  You will receive instructions\non how to ftp via email.\n\nJim
How do you solve the problem when the message "Cannot perform malloc"\nshows for XtCreateManagedWidget call?\n\nI have the application written in X11R5 running on DECstation using\nAthena widgets.  As soon as I added codes to do Remote Procedure Call,\nthe program refused to work.  I also have my program working using\njust Xlib calls with RPC.

I'm quite familiar with a variety of window title *setting* methods.\n\nMy question is...  Is there any way (via Resources, etc) to stop an\napplication's ability to re-name it's own Name / IconName properties?\n\n...who cares if it's not 'nice' to the application -\n\n	I WANT CONTROL! ;-)\n\n-Mike
Is there such a document either in the Bookstores or possible\non an ftp site somewhere?  Nothing really fancy, just something\nthat gives a listing of the available widgets, and the resources\nthat are pertinant to them, and what flavors of Motif they\noccur in.
I've installed many X apps, and have that many of them Imakefiles that have\nlines startingwith XCOMM in them. When I do a xmkmf to create the Makefile,\nthe Makefile also has the XCOMM (comment?) lines in them. I always have\nto edit out these lines because the make command barfs on them. I was\nwondering what these lines were for, and what I might be doing wrong that\ncauses the make command to dislike them. Thanks!
#\n# Does anyone know if the following is possible, and if so how do I go about\n# doing it.\n# \n# I want to be able to display remote X11 applications on a VAXstation 2000 off\n# of an Internet node. Here is where the problem comes up, the VAXstation isn't\n# connected directly to the Internet but is connected via Decnet to a node that\n# does have a connection to the Internet. Does anyone know if it is possible to\n# get the display to use TCPIP from the remote Internet node down to my local\n# Internet node and then send it via Decnet down to the VAXstation 2000?\n#\n\nFor the machine that is connected to the InterNet, what is it running?  If it\nis running VMS, then if you obtain MultiNet for it, MultiNet comes with a\nTCP/IP to DECnet gateway for X11.\n\nPatrick L.

NCD just announced a new generation of PC-Xview. They\nchanged the name a little though and I can't remember\nexactly... PC-Xsomething.
Text & Graphics:\n	Bristol Technologies has help clone of MSWindows help\n	Frame (makers of FrameMaker) has FrameView\n\n	Text only:\n	Graphical Software Technology has Xtra Widgets (includes help)\n\n	There are probably others (check out ICS widget data book)\n\nI actually wrote one for the last company I worked for-- however it is\nlocked in their internal reuse library.  :-(  \nIt was a good one too! (IMHO and totally unbiased view of things) ;-)
Check out a program called PC-Xview. I've used it before, and from\nwhat I can tell, it's exactly what you're looking for. Last I checked,\nyou should be able to find it for about $160 a copy.\n\n-Eric

Most DOS X servers are terribly slow to use in my experience - and no, I guess \nperformance would be pretty bad. I believe the discussion is valid for an X \nserver on a decent workstation.

Hi all,\n\nI've read the FAQ, I've fiddled around, but I am still having problems getting\nmy poor old HP9000/300 to let me input/display characters above 127.  I have \nthe following in my .Xdefaults:\n\nXTerm*Font     :   -adobe-courier-bold-r-normal--14-140-75-75-m-90-iso8859-1\n\nSo I believe that I have the correct font selected to use in xterm.  I have NOT\nset my LC_CTYPE environment variable because whatever I put it, it tells me that\nthat locale is not supported (apparently we have no additional locales defined,\nor at least, /lib/locale doesn't exist).  I can get some of the characters\nabove 127 to print out, but they are not where I'd expect them -- for example,\nAlt-v does not produce a u umlaut.  This leads me to believe that the fault\nlies with the stty settings, which are as follows:\n\nspeed 9600 baud; line = 0; susp <undef>; dsusp <undef>\nintr = ^C; quit = ^\; erase = ^H; kill = ^K; swtch = ^@\neof = ^D; eol = ^@; min = 4; time = 0; stop = ^S; start = ^Q\n-parenb -parodd cs8 -cstopb hupcl cread -clocal -loblk -crts \n-ignbrk -brkint -ignpar -parmrk -inpck -istrip -inlcr -igncr icrnl -iuclc \nixon -ixany ixoff -ienqak \nisig icanon iexten -xcase echo echoe echok -echonl -noflsh \nopost -olcuc onlcr -ocrnl -onocr -onlret -ofill -ofdel -tostop \n\nAnyway, I've struggled with this off and on for a couple of weeks, and any help\nanyone could offer would be greatly appreciated.\n\n\n					Thanks!
Evolution of SCO newsgroups and Mailing Lists\n              ---------------------------------------------\n   \n   Many readers enjoyed the opportunity to obtain and contribute useful\n   information on SCO Open Desktop since 1990 through the ancestral USENET\n   newsgroup sco.opendesktop or it's companion mailing list.  Similarly,\n   there was a demonstrated need for an information and discussion forum\n   for SCO products in general.\n   \n   With the increasing demand for accessibility and for additional SCO\n   newsgroups, many current contributors including those who have been\n   active in circulating SCO related newsgroups and mailing lists felt\n   that the readership would be best served by creating a biz.sco.*\n   hierarchy to improve propagation (and hence availability) worldwide.\n\n   biz.sco.{opendesktop,general,announce} were newgrouped May 1, 1991 in\n   accordance with accepted procedure within "biz".  Given the content,\n   this change relocated the "opendesktop" newsgroup to a more proper place\n   within the established usenet news hierarchy and adds the new "announce"\n   and "general" groups.  On Aug 1, 1991, the former "sco-list@uunet.uu.net"\n   became "scogen" in keeping with established biz.sco.* naming conventions.\n\n   biz.sco.binaries and biz.sco.sources were newgrouped on June 1, 1992\n   to respectively accommodate SCO Xenix, UNIX and OpenDesktop specific\n   binaries and source code.  The binaries and sources news groups are\n   moderated, with moderator and submissions information and policy\n   outlined in the periodic imformational postings in those newsgroups.\n   Respecting USENET etiquite, these newsgroups are _not_ gated to\n   mailing lists, but are archived on several nuucp and ftp hosts.\n\n   biz.sco.magazine was newgrouped Dec 14, 1992, to provide a discussion\n   area for the readers, writers and publishers of SCO Magazine.\n   \n   Subject to the USENET NEWS hierarchies carried by your upstream feed,\n   you are now able to subscribe to the following:\n   \n        Newsgroup                    mailing list subscription\n        ---------                    -------------------------\n        biz.sco.opendesktop          scoodt-request@xenitec.on.ca\n        biz.sco.general              scogen-request@xenitec.on.ca\n        biz.sco.announce             scoann-request@xenitec.on.ca\n	biz.sco.sources			<none>\n	biz.sco.binaries		<none>\n	biz.sco.magazine	     scomag-request@xenitec.on.ca\n\n   You are _strongly_ encouraged to obtain these newsgroups via USENET\n   NEWS mechanisms vrs mail.  Anyone having difficulty arranging a news\n   feed for these newsgroups is welcome to email the undersigned and\n   I'll do my best to help.  We also offer all required software in\n   source code form via anonymous FTP and UUCP, as do many archive sites.\n   If, after having explored all options, you are still unable to receive\n   biz.sco.* as news, you may subscribe to the mailing lists.\n   \n   The 4 discussion newsgroups are bi-directionally gated to companion\n   mailing lists, so anyone not having access to NEWS but who does have a\n   UUCP or Internet mail feed can still participate fully using email.\n   Mailing list subscribers should send their request to the appropriate\n   "mailing list subscription" address above, including in the message body:\n\n	Add: subscriber_address		-eg-\n	Add: your_logname@site.do.main  -or-\n	Add: up!stream!yoursite!your_logname\n\n   Inclusion of an alternative working bang-path relative to a well know\n   major functional site might prove beneficial.  Deletions are handled\n   the same way, simply substitute "Delete:" for "Add:", ensuring that\n   you use the exact same address you subscribed with.  Mailing list\n   subscribers receive "how to post to the mlist" article submission\n   information when their request is processed.  If you don't receive\n   an acknowledgement within a few days, check your routing and try a test\n   message via xenitec.on.ca back to your host.  In such cases, it's likely\n   that someone, somewhere, is bouncing mail replies to you (and would do\n   the same with mailing list traffic), and you'll want to resolve your\n   connectivity problem before trying to subscribe again.

We are planning on buying 15-20 X Terminals.  I have the article from Jim\nMorton regarding prices, etc., and am looking for any other information\nthat will help me decide which to buy.\n\nThe terminals will be connected to a DEC 3000/400 AXP with 96Mb RAM,\nrunning OSF/1.  From what I have found out so far, it would be best to run\nas much as possible in the terminal itself (X11, window manager, xterm,\netc.), and that in order to do this we need n Mb RAM in the Xterminal\n(where n ranges from 4 to 10, depending on who I talk to).\n\nWhat should I be looking for?  What sort of questions should I be asking\nthe salespeople?\n\nThanks
We're looking at various X11 clients for PC's and we're looking for some\ninformation about the relative efficiency of different products.  Are any\nnotably efficient (fast)?  Are any notably inefficient?  I assume that a\nGraphics Accelerator makes them significantly faster (right now I'm looking\nat ico running on Xoftware/32 for Windows sitting on the Distinct TCP/IP\nplatform, and it's (not surprisingly) much slower than ico running on the\nSparc10's console.  What are the key ways of improving performance for\nPC (presumably Windows) clients?\n\nAlso, what about async solutions?  (Yes, I appreciate that it will be \n*much* slower even with V.42bis.)  I'm in the process of installing PPP\n(with header compression).  How does that compare to cslip?  I've seen\na product called XRemote by NCD that promises to be pretty efficient, but\nare there comparable products out there?  If we're looking for efficiency\nfor async, PC clients, what should we be looking at in addition to standard\nPPP w/ compression and XRemote?\n\nAny information would be greatly appreciated.  I'm still taking in all\nthe information in the faq, but any tips about the relative efficiency\nof various product offerings would be great.  (I get the impression\nthat discussions about speed are largely application specific, but\nthat not withstanding, any comments would be appreciated.)  Thanks.\n\n-- Rob
Answers please by e-mail, since not all groups in the header are carried here.\n\nHi!\n\nPersonally, I like NeXTSTEP very much. Even more when I realise how much a  \nburden ordinary X or Windows programming is. I also like Objective-C better  \nthan I like C++.\n\nBut, sometimes the restrictions are there. For instance it sometimes has to be  \nMS-Windows or X. Now I'm looking for pointers to tools on those environments  \nthat come close to NeXTSTEP, the appkit etc. Also, environs that support rapid  \nprototyping (like with IB) without producing spaghetti-code as soon as you want  \nto do real work.\n\nMaybe STEPSTONE with some Windows version of a kit of UI objects? Interviews  \n(what it is exactly, I don't know. I kind of lost touch with that world when I  \nstarted with NeXTSTEP.)\n\nThanks,
I assume that you are literally trying to create a widget of type\ntextWidgetClass. Use the AsciiText widget instead.\n\nJim
The x3270 at export.lcs.mit.edu supposedly does.  I use another x3270\nthat was cleaned up by Brian Ward <ward@math.psu.edu> which adds better\ncolor support, and cleans up _lots_ of bugs, as well as cut&paste.\nI just put it on export.lcs.mit.edu, as x3270v2.65beta.tar.Z.\n\n--Dave

Wasn't the shareware fee a "suggestion" by John?\n   Is so then it's up to the individual to make the choice whether or not to\n   honour it and part with money.  Personally if I was in his position I would\n   do exactly the same thing, John has obviously put in lot of time and effort\n   into xv and why shouldn't he receive some money for it.\n\nIt is interesting to look at the change(s) of mind that John has had.\n\nThe AUTHOR file for xgif (an early incarnation of xv) reads (in part) \nas follows...\n\n  Do whatever you want with this program, though it *would* be nice if my name\n  remained on it somewhere...  Other than that, it may be freely modified,\n  distributed, and used to fill up disk space.\n\nThe README file for xv 1.00 (?) reads (in part) as follows...\n\n  NOTE:  If you like the program and decide to use it, *please* send me a short\n  email message to that effect.  Be sure to mention the full name of your\n  organization.  When our sponsors ask us 'what have you been doing', it would\n  be most handy to be able to come up with a nice long list of organizations\n  that are using code developed in the GRASP Lab.  Brownie points, as\n  it were.\n\nThe copyright notices as it appeared then was...\n\n  /*\n   * Copyright 1989, 1990 by the University of Pennsylvania\n   *\n   * Permission to use, copy, and distribute for non-commercial purposes,\n   * is hereby granted without fee, providing that the above copyright\n   * notice appear in all copies and that both the copyright notice and this\n   * permission notice appear in supporting documentation.\n   *\n   * The software may be modified for your own purposes, but modified versions\n   * may not be distributed.\n   *\n   * This software is provided "as is" without any express or implied warranty.\n   */\n\nThe README file for xv 2.00 reads (in part) as follows...\n\n  Also, if you find XV to be nifty, useful, generally 'cool', and of\n  some value to you, your donation (not tax-deductable) would be greatly\n  appreciated.  $10 (U.S.) is probably a fine amount to donate.\n  Folks who donate $25 and up will receive a nice, bound copy of the XV Manual\n  printed on a spiffo 600-dpi laser printer.  It'll look lovely mounted over\n  your fireplace.\n\nWhich looks to me as a suggestion (see Julian's comment above).\n\nThe copyright notices as it appeared then was...\n\n  * Copyright 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992 by John Bradley and\n  *                       The University of Pennsylvania\n\nThe README for xv 3.00 reads (in part) as follows...\n\n  XV is shareware for PERSONAL USE only.  You may use XV for your own\n  amusement, and if you find it nifty, useful, generally cool, or of\n  some value to you, your non-deductable donation would be greatly\n  appreciated.  $25 is the suggested donation, though, of course,\n  larger donations are quite welcome.  Folks who donate $25 or more\n  can receive a printed, bound copy of the XV manual for no extra\n  charge.  If you want one, just ask.  BE SURE TO SPECIFY THE VERSION\n  OF XV THAT YOU ARE USING!\n\n  Commercial, government, and institutional users MUST register their\n  copies of XV, for the exceedingly REASONABLE price of just $25 per\n  workstation/X terminal.

Are there any graphics texts with examples/demos/projects directly in\nX?\n\nThe last time I taught the course, I used a popular graphics text that\nuses its own graphics package, with implementations available for\nX/Mac/PC.

I use those routines in a widget which only redraws exposed areas.\nhere's a small piece of code that uses those routines\n\nstatic void Redisplay(pw, ev, region)\nXtpManagerWidget pw;\nXExposeEvent *ev;\nRegion region;\n\n/* pp->exposure_region is an XRegion */\nXtpManagerPart *pp = &pw->plotter;\npp->exposure_region = XCreateRegion();\n   /* region is passed via an expose event */\nif(region == NULL)\n{\nif (ev->send_event)  /* synthetic event sent by widget it wants a full redraw*/\n        {\n        exporect.x = pw->core.x;\n        exporect.y = pw->core.y;\n        exporect.width = pw->core.width;\n        exporect.height = pw->core.height;\n        }\n     else\n        {\n        exporect.x = ev->x;\n        exporect.y = ev->y;\n        exporect.width = ev->width;\n        exporect.height = ev->height;\n        }\n\nstuff deleted      \n\n/* region now contains the exposure region */\n        XUnionRectWithRegion(&exporect,pp->exposure_region,pp->exposure_region);\n}\nelse\n        XUnionRegion ( region, pp->exposure_region, pp->exposure_region);\nstuff deleted \n/* WE NEED to CLIP on EXPOSE REGION for REDRAWING the GRID */\n        XSetRegion(XtDisplayOfObject(pw), pp->plotarea_gc,pp->exposure_region);\nstuff deleted \n        /* check to see if child is exposed */\n        if (XRectInRegion (pw->plotter.exposure_region,\n                         child->core.x ,\n                         child->core.y ,\n                         child->core.width  ,\n                         child->core.height ))\n\nSo, I build up a region of exposures so that when I service my container\nwidget redraw of rectobj children, I only redraw what need to be redrawn.\n\nIt works for me, hope this helps you.\nBrian
The Andrew Consortium\n          of the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon \n                         is pleased to announce\n\n                          AUIS 5.1.1 for AIX3.2\n                                 4/26/93\n\nThe Andrew User Interface System version 5.1 (our CDrom version) was\ndeveloped for AIX  version 3.1 on the IBM RS/6000 and many other\nplatforms.  To accomodate AIX version 3.2, we have created a patch to\nthe sources.  The patch and accompanying instructions for its\napplication can be retrieved at no charge via anonymous-ftp from the\ninternet host emsworth.andrew.cmu.edu (128.2.45.40) in the directory\n./aixpatch.  For those without internet access, a 3.5" diskette can be\nordered for $10 by sending, or faxing, a purchase order to the address\nbelow. \n\nThe base 5.1 system can be ordered from us as a CDrom or ftp'ed from the\nsame host.\n\nNote that this patch adds no additional functionality but simply allows\nAUIS to compile under AIX3.2.\n\n-----------\n\nThe Andrew User Interface System (AUIS) is a comprehensive environment\non top of X11 windows in which you can create, use, and mail multi-media\napplications and documents.   A major advantage of AUIS is the\ncapability to recursively embed objects.  Thus, one can edit text that\nnot only contains multiple fonts, indentation, and other typography, but\nalso  contains embedded raster images, spreadsheets, drawing editors,\nequations, simple animations, and so on. These embedded objects can\nthemselves contain other objects, including text.\n\nAUIS has three components:\n\n    The Andrew User Environment is an integrated and extensible set\n    of applications beginning with the ez text editor, a help\n    system, a system monitoring tool, an editor-based shell\n    interface, and other editors corresponding to the various\n    available types of objects. \n\n    The Andrew Toolkit (ATK) is a portable, object-oriented\n    user-interface toolkit that provides the architecture wherein\n    objects can be embedded in one-another.  With the toolkit,\n    programmers can create new objects that can be embedded as\n    easily as those that come with the system. \n\n    The Andrew Message System (AMS) provides a multi-media interface\n    to mail and bulletin-boards.  AMS supports several mail\n    management strategies and implements many advanced  features\n    including authentication, return receipts, automatic sorting of\n    mail, vote collection and tabulation, enclosures, audit trails\n    of related messages, and subscription management. It also\n    provides a variety of interfaces that support ttys and\n    low-function personal computers in addition to high-function\n    workstations. \n\nThe current public release of Andrew, Version 5.1,  includes support for\nthe new Internet MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) standards\nfor multipart, multimedia mail.  A newer release, 5.2, for members of\nthe Andrew Consortium has numerous additional features including new\neditors for drawings, images, fonts, and user preferences.\n\n\nRemote Andrew Demo Service\n\nYou can try out Andrew from your own work station via the Remote Andrew\nDemo Service.  You need a host machine on the Internet running the X11\nwindow system.  You'll be able to compose multimedia documents, navigate\nthrough the interactive Andrew Tour, and use the Andrew Message System\nto browse through a few of CMU's four thousand bulletin boards and\nnewsgroups.\n\nTo get started with the Remote Andrew Demo service, simply run the\nfollowing command on your machine:\n\n	finger help@atk.itc.cmu.edu\n\nThe service will give you further instructions.   \n\n\nMore information about Andrew is available from:\n\n    Information Requests\n    Andrew Consortium\n    Carnegie Mellon University\n    Smith Hall 106\n    5000 Forbes Avenue\n    Pittsburgh, PA 15213-3890\n    USA\n    phone: +1-412-268-6710\n    fax: +1-412-682-6938\n    info-andrew-request@andrew.cmu.edu
I need to know where I can get a FAQ on Xwindows for MS-DOS machines.\nThe usual FAQ just gave me a name of a file called XServers-NonUNIX.txt.Z.\nwhich I cannot find anywhere.
The subject line says it all really, I'm looking for a PD application\nwhich will just handle the displaying of 3D data sets (images) in\ncross section, or any pointers to code which will aid in the development\nof such a system.\n\n  Thanks in advance\n\n	Keith Marlow
: I have the following problem on X11R5 servers.\n: \n: When a window of my is obscured by a pop up window which has\n: the Save Under attribute set, the subwindows of my window are not restored.\n: Normally, the subwindows are redrawn when the parent window gets an expose\n: event, but because the save under attribute is used for the pop up window\n: that obscured my window, no expose event is sent.\n\nWe had the same problem and on most of our machines it works if we use\nBacking Store instead of Save under.\n\nMarcus

I would have appreciated an announcement of the policy change - \nDartmouth will not be able to run xv 3.0, and I'm probably going \nto have to take v2 off line (I somehow missed the "shareware"\ndesignation in the README of v2, and didn't realize that we were\nsupposed to register).\n\nI also debate whether this, with the new "institutions must pay"\npolicy belongs in the contrib directory on export - to me, "contrib"\nmeans "contributed" (i.e. no strings, except copyright) attached.
The Only directory I know of that lists commercial and non-commercial\nwidgets is the ICS Widget Data book.  ICS sells the widgets for various\nprices.  There are also some public domain widgets in the delivery. \n\nThe ICS Widget databook is a subscription kind of thing, where \nyou pay some nominal fee, get a cd with the widgets and then you \ncan use the public domain widgets freely, and selectively activate \nwidgets which you want to purchase the right to use from them. \nThe nice thing about this is that you can purchase whole sets of widgets\nsuch as those used in dataviews.  I dont know there pricing schemes\nbut It is often better to buy than to redevelop the more complex \nwidgets, especially if you only one customer to distribute to. \n\nThis is the extent that I know about them except that I got their \ndatabook catalog  and it looked impressive (lots o' widgets there)\n\nI dont work for ICS or have any widgets being sold by them.\nhope this helps you.\n-- \nBrian Dealy                |301-572-8267| It not knowing where it's at  \ndealy@kong.gsfc.nasa.gov   |            | that's important,it's knowing\n!uunet!dftsrv!kong!dealy   |            | where it's not at...

I am *almost* done porting XFree86 1.2 to a new piece of display\nhardware, but have run into a snag I think may be somewhat\ncommonplace, so I'm sending a net-feeler.\n\nI have a display that is a non-interlaced, memory mapped, 1-bit\n720x280 display.  The server's view of the world, (obtained via xwd |\nxwud), seems to be exactly what it should be.  However, the displayed\nversion of the framebuffer gives the impression that the server is\nusing scanlines that are too long.  After a bit of experimentation, it\nseems that the problem was that the server was padding the line out to\na word boundry, but the scanline size in the buffer is 90 bytes, which\nisn't exactly divisible by four.  Changing the following defines in\nmit/server/include/servermd.h:\n\n----\n\n#define BITMAP_SCANLINE_PAD  32\n#define LOG2_BITMAP_PAD		5\n#define LOG2_BYTES_PER_SCANLINE_PAD	2\n\n---\n\nto:\n\n---\n\n#define BITMAP_SCANLINE_PAD  16\n#define LOG2_BITMAP_PAD		4\n#define LOG2_BYTES_PER_SCANLINE_PAD	2\n\n---\n\nWas not exactly the right solution.  How do I tell the server either\n(a) don't pad the scan lines at all ('cause this server is only being\nbuilt to run on this particular display), or to pad only to byte\nboundries?\n\nI'm using a customized version of XFree86v1.2, under Mach 3.0.
Judging from the responses so far, I have not made clear enough in my\narticle quoted above that Imake-TeX is not for installing TeX, but for\n*using* it. With Imake-TeX, you will never again have to fiddle around with\ncalling latex and its various utility programs (makeindex, bibtex). Simply\ntype "make" and your document's DVI file will be up-to-date. All you have\nto do is to write a simple Imakefile and let Imake generate a suitable\nMakefile for you. Here is such an Imakefile:\n\n	#include "TeX.tmpl"\n	PaperFormatA4()\n	SimpleLatexTarget(document)\n\nThe generated Makefile provides the following commands:\n\n    make depend:    Searching the TeX source files for dependencies like\n                    \input{somefile}\n\n    make dvi:       Generate an up-to-date DVI file\n\n    make viewdvi:   Display it on your screen\n\n    make ps:        Generate a PostScript version of your document\n\n    make viewps:    Display it\n\n    make clean:     Remove unnecessary things\n\n    make veryclean: Remove even the DVI file\n\n    make Makefiles: Generate Makefiles in subdirectories\n\n\nIf ...\n\na) ...this seems attractive to you,\nb) ...you are willing to test Imake-TeX and send me a short test report,\nc) ...you are willing to cope with a rudimentary English documentation\n   (however, the German version is completed and included),\n\nthen you are invited as a beta tester. I am looking forward to your e-mail.\n\n-- \n  Dipl.-Inform. Rainer Klute      I R B :  immer richtig beraten\n  Univ.

I tried to send this as private mail, but mail to benj@ossa.hq.nasa.gov was\nrejected, so here it is:\n\nHere is an extract from the README file that comes with MacX:\n\nUsers of remote commands with Sun machines may find that their remote commands \nappear to do nothing and there is no output from the Sun machine.  This is due \nto a feature of the Sun rexecd network daemon which quietly disconnects from \nrequesting machines that are not known to the Sun|s network address (/etc/hosts\nor NIS hosts) database.  To successfully use remote commands with a SunOS-based\nmachine, there must be an entry in the network address database for the \nMacintosh which is running MacX.\n\n--

At the moment, I am using a Sun 3/80 (cgfour/bwtwo) with SunOS 4.0.3\nand OpenWindows 2.0.\n\nThis configuration is slow and I can't run all the programs on OW2. For\nexample, when I start a mailtool from OW3 and display it on my OW2\ndisplay, I can't open the compose window.\n\nI want to install an X11R5 or X11R4 server on my Sun and use xdm (yes,\nwe have xdm already running for other X-Terminals) to log in and start\nthe X programs.\n\nIs there a "ready to go" binairy of the X11 server for my configuration\n(I have read something about Xsun), or must I compile the X11 stuff by\nmyself?\n\nAny help is welcome\n\n	V. Smeets
[...]\n\n\n\nI think your performance will depend upon the X server. \n\nI'm running Linux and XFree86 on a 33Mhz 486DX with 4MB of RAM (8MB swap) and\nit runs just fine.  Its a lot better than some of the crappy old Xterminals\nin the labs at school anyway.\n\nYou could probably outfit a 386SX with a minimal Linux/X setup for $900\nand be better off than with an Xterminal. IMHO.\n\n\nScott\n--
sherman@lea.csc.ncsu.edu (Chris Sherman) gripes:\n\nxv's been shareware for about a year ... hadn't you noticed?\nI don't have a problem with this.  John Bradley has put a *hell*\nof a lot of work into xv, and if he feels that it's time to get\nsome monetary reward from it, that's surely his right.\n\n\nHad you bothered to consult the distribution terms of the IJG JPEG\ncode (which are right there in the xv distribution), you would have\nobserved that we specifically grant permission for use in shareware\nand commercial software.  Sam Leffler's libtiff copyright also grants\npermission for unrestricted use including resale.\n\n\n"Commercial"?  There's a big difference between a polite request\nfor a voluntary donation and commercial, it's-illegal-to-copy-this-\nand-we'll-sic-our-lawyers-on-you software.\n\nI do agree that John's readme file could be a little clearer about\nwhat he means by personal use.

Hello,\n\n  I am considering buying the Hummingbird X-Windows software for a MS-Windows\n3.1 PC (386-40MHZ, NE2000 Ethernet board).

Hi, friends,\n\nOur SPARC workstation is now equippied with a GT-accelerator. we want to use\nit to display stereo images. The accelerator has double buffers. How can we\naccess the buffers and switch between them ? With which functions can we do \nthat ? with functions from XGL, Phigs, Xlib or Xlib-extension ?\n\nYour help will be highly appreciated.\n\n\nYonglong Xu\n\nUni. of Hannover
I am using xnlock as the screensaver for a PC-based X server. However,\nafter an interval of no activity, my X session ends. This does not\nhappen when I use xscreensaver. \n\nMy screensave command is fired up from my .xsession like this:\n\nxautolock -time 1 -locker xnlock -corners ++++ -cornerdelay 1 &\n\nMy hypothesis is that xdm (I use xdmcp to start my X session) detects\na period of inactivity from the server, then terminates the session.\nHowever, for some reason, this does not happen with xscreensaver. Is\nthere a workaround?\n\nI'd prefer responses via e-mail.\n\nThanks.

I have gotten X11R5 pl 23 to compile on AIX 3.2.2 using cc.\n but the server will not run. it simplys starts and a couple seconds\n later exits. no error are displayed. \n my defines for compile are\n -DSYSV -DAIXV3 -DSYSV_WAIT   -DMALLOC_0_RETURNS_NULL \n\n \n   could somewhere share some light, or maybe the ibm.cf file. \n\n thanks.
Given that all the source code contains explicit permission to use or\nmodify the code without fee in addition to the shareware notice, I would\nsay that the shareware notice is unenforceable.  All you need to do is\nmake minor changes to create a derivative work which is explicitly allowed\nunder the first part of the copyright notice.  Of course, this would be\ncircumventing the author's wishes on the subject, but I'd say if you're\nnot going to pay him no matter what, you'd be on relatively safe ground\nwith that approach...  In fact, given the internal contradictions of the\ncopyright notices, I'd guess none of it could ever be enforced, but not being\na lawyer, I can't be positive.\n\nRegardless, the fees he's asking are not excessive, and I would encourage\nanyone who wants to use the program to pay them if at all possible.  Even\nthough it is unlikely that you have actual legal obligations to pay the\nauthor, it would be reasonable to do so, to support his efforts if nothing\nelse.\n\n- Brad
Does anyone know any sites/resources where I can find gadgets for the vuewm\nwindow manager?  Such as types,actions,icons for the file manager and\nevent manager...etc....
For flexibility. Anyway, what you say is not really true. The color information\nis associated with a GraphicsContext, not with a display, and the GC _IS_\na parameter to the drawing routines.\n\nSo, if you need to fast switch between green dotted lines and blue ones of\nwidth 2, you can make 2 GCs for those cases and then simply do\n\nXDrawLine(dpy,win,gc_red,x1,y1,x2,y2);\nXDrawLine(dpy,win,gc_blue,x3,y3,x4,y4);\n\nfor this effect.\n\nThis is eventually more complicated to do for the programmer, but also much\nmore efficient and flexible. You would not include all the other parameters\nlike line pattern, with, cap and joinstyle, drawmode and so on in every\ndrawing call, so why do it for color ? BTW, stay away from XDrawPoint()\nif you don't really need it (to draw RANDOM points), for image transfers\nthere are Image routines.
Hi Netters,\n	Having inherited a Solbourne (S-4000 : Sun 4 Compatible), I was wondering\nif somebody has ported X11R5 to this beast. Since Solbournce Computer Inc. folded\nup I don't know where I can get the kernel to move from R4. Since they never\njoined the MIT Consortium, the regular distribution doesn't work. Any pointers\nwill be highly appreciated.\n\nJulian
I have done this before, but I'm not sure I used the best approach (although\nI tried several methods...).\n\nYou have to run up the window heirarchy (using XQueryTree()) until you get\nto the root window.  Now, this is not so simple because some window managers\nslap a window over the root window that is the same size as the root window,\nso be sure to take that into account for further calculations.\n\nCalculate the position and width/height offsets for each window using\nXGetGeometry().  BE SURE TO TAKE THE BORDER_WIDTH INTO CONSIDERATION.\nRemember a windows border_width IS ON THE OUTSIDE of a window, so the\nwindows x,y,width,height must be adjusted accordingly.\n\nAll of this should give you pretty good numbers for how much space the\nwindow-manager is using.\n\nNow, to place the new window, you have to use the same numbers to calculate \nwhere you want to place it, because the window-manager will re-parent it on\nthe OUTSIDE of where you place your window (if I remember correctly).\n\nDISCLAIMER: All of this is from memory, and I no longer have the code.  But\nI did get it working under several window managers correctly.  Feel free to\ncall or e-mail for further info.\n\n              -McGary
I'm trying to make a 24 bit window using XCreateWindow on a 8 bit\nPseudoColor server. As far as I know this should be possible if you\nserver supports a TrueColor or DirectColor visual.

Try to run Xsun under truss(1).\n\n	The best way to do this is by logging in over the network\n	and typing:\n\n	truss -t open Xsun\n\nopen("/opt/X11R5/lib/X11/fonts/misc/fonts.dir", O_RDONLY, 0666) = 8\nopen("/opt/X11R5/lib/X11/fonts/misc/fonts.alias", O_RDONLY, 0666) = 8\nopen("/opt/X11R5/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo/fonts.dir", O_RDONLY, 0666) = 8\nopen("/opt/X11R5/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo/fonts.alias", O_RDONLY, 0666) Err#2 ENOENT\nopen("/opt/X11R5/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/fonts.dir", O_RDONLY, 0666) = 8\nopen("/opt/X11R5/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/fonts.alias", O_RDONLY, 0666) = 8\nopen("/opt/X11R5/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi/fonts.dir", O_RDONLY, 0666) = 8\nopen("/opt/X11R5/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi/fonts.alias", O_RDONLY, 0666) = 8\nopen("/opt/X11R5/lib/X11/fonts/misc/6x13.pcf", O_RDONLY, 0666) = 8\nopen("/opt/X11R5/lib/X11/fonts/misc/cursor.pcf", O_RDONLY, 0666) = 8\n\nThis will give you and idea of where Xsun things the fonts should be.\n\nIf you have defined  a project root and done a make install, everything\nshould have gone right by default, even without symbolic links.

I have a clone almost with no name generating 91k xstones on a 486/33Mhz\nsystem.\n\n\n\nExcuse me, but with a 486/50 256k cache, S3 928 ISA card, 8Mb XS3 (X11R5) running 386bsd  you can get 100k+ xstones at 1024x768 65Mhz which I doubt \nthat your XP10 series gets. Commerical verions X servers for S3 928 cards\ncan get 136k xstones. So the performance is there and additionally since\nis running unix multiple users can use the system which I have done in\nmy home setup.\n\nMaintenance is minimal if you can read README files for the X servers and\nfor 386bsd.\n\nAmancio Hasty

I would further add that a 486/50,S3/928,8mb,15",200mbDISK is going to cost\n/WAY/ more than $900, probably $3,000.  Color makes it not apples/apples too.\nXterminals provide better price/performance than PCs.  You can make a PC\nmuch cheaper, and perform much worse, and you can make PC's perform great, and\ncost more.  You pay extra for the additional functinality and expandability\nof a PC.  For home user, that extra functionality is worth the added cost.
Some  people working a few cubes over have come up with this need, and\nit seems that someone out there just might have done it  already,  and\ncan point me to some tools that would help. What they'd like to do is:\nGiven a window that is taking a long time to draw (because either  the\ndata  is  arriving  over a slow link, or the $DISPLAY is across a slow\nlink), they would like to first paint a low-resolution version of  the\npicture,  and then repaint it in higher resolution.  Thus, the picture\nmight first be generated in 1/4 resolution, with each  4x4  square  of\npixels  being  filled  in  with a single color.  Next, each 4x4 square\nwould be replaced by 4 2x2 squares; finally the 1x1 version  would  be\npainted.\n\nSince  one of the scenarios is with the window being on the other side\nof a slow link, the low-res version obviously wouldn't be  transmitted\nas  a bitmap; that wouldn't help at all.  Instead, there would have to\nbe a process on the far end that receives the  low-res  picture  as  a\nsmall  bitmap,  and  blows up each pixel into a square (sorta like the\nmagnifier programs do).  This brings up the question of whether the  X\nserver  can help.  That is, when a window is opened, is there a way to\nask that a "filter" program be run to process the pixels?  Or  is  the\nonly  way  to  use  something  like  rsh  to start up a remote process\n("Permission denied" ;-), and have it open a local window?\n\nIt seems the most likely scenario is a library routine that starts  up\nsuch  a  program  remotely, and then accepts bitmaps, compressing each\none by some amount, and sending them to the remote program to  expand.\nBut  if  there is something that X itself can do to help, it's be nice\nto hear about it.  (I looked in several FMs,  but  if  it's  there,  I\nobviously  don't  know  the keywords ;-).  If someone has a nifty tool\navailable that packages it all, we might want to get a copy.\n\nOh, yes; this is to run on some Suns.  Part of the idea  is  to  build\ndemos  that  can  show such things as "If this were run across, say, a\n4800-bps link, this is how fast the pictures would appear."  Then  the\ncustomer would get a feel for the speed that they need to pay for.
Does any one out there have experience with Planet X, I am\nconsidering buying it to use on a SPARCstation IPC, in this\nway I can run Mac programs from the SPARC.\n\nWould you recommend buying this piece of Software and what is\nthe emulation on the SPARC like?  Does it give a window of a\nMac or does it give a window of just the individual programs?\n\nAny information would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\nDean

To allow the execution\nXof X programs, it copies a number of environmental variables to\nXthe remote session.  If you omit\nX.IR command ,\nXthen rx will start an xterm on the remote host.  The\nX.B rxterm\nXvarient starts a remote xterm on a host, and also passes\nX.I args\nXto the remote xterm as arguments.\nX.PP\nXShell metacharacters which are not quoted are interpreted on the local\nXmachine, while quoted metacharacters are interpreted on the remote\nXmachine.\nX.PP\nXIf the name of the file from which\nX.B rx\nXis executed is anything other than ``rx,''\nX.B rx\nXtakes this name, stripped on a leading ``r'' as the command\nXto run on the remote host, using any\nX.I command\nXparameters as arguments for the remote command.\nX.PP\nXIf\nX.B rx\nXthinks you are using\nX.B xauth\nXbased X authorisation, and you are calling to a off-site host, or\nXto a different username, it will attempt to copy an authorization\nXkey to the remote account.  Otherwise it will try to use\nX.B xhost(1)\nXto grant access to the remote host.\nX.SH OPTIONS\nX.TP\nX.BI \-l " username"\nXUse\nX.I username\nXas the remote username instead of your local username.  In the absence\nXof this option, the remote username is the same as your local username.\nX\nX.SH ENVIRONMENT\nXIf set, the values of PATH, DISPLAY, XENVIRONMENT, XAPPLRESDIR,\nXXFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, OPENWINHOME, LD_LIBRARY_PATH,\nXand XAUTHORITY are exported to the remote program, unless the\nXremote username is different, or the remote host is off-site, in which\nXcase only DISPLAY is exported, with in all cases any variables named in the\nXvariable RXENV.\nX.PP\nXThe DISPLAY variable is tweaked as appropriate, to contain as qualified\nXa hostname as is needed.\nX.SH DIAGNOSTICS\nX.TP\nX.IB command ": don't recognise my name."\nX.B rx\nXcannot decode the name it has been called under.  In this case\nXit prints a warning message, and continues, as normal.\nX.TP\nX.B "rx: usage: rx [-l username] hostname [args...]"\nXThis means it could not decode the arguments given to it.\nX.SH AUTHOR\nXDuncan Sinclair <sinclair@dcs.glasgow.ac.uk>, July 1992\nX.br\nXOriginally based on a program with the same name from the\nX.B gwm\nXdistribution.

These\n  are the standard responses you hear when you ask how to improve the\n  performance of your workstation.\n\n  Well, more hardware isn't always an option, and I wonder if more\n  hardware is always even a necessity.\n\n  This "FAQ" list is a collection of suggestions and ideas from different\n  people on the net on how you can the best possible performance from X\n  Windows on your workstation, WITHOUT PURCHASING MORE HARDWARE.\n\n  Performance is a highly subjective issue.  The individual user must\n  balance `speed' versus `features' in order to come to a personal\n  decision.  Therefore this document can be be expected to contain many\n  subjective opinions in and amongst the objective facts.\n\n  This document is specifically concerned with X.  There are of course\n  many other factors that can affect the performance of a workstation.\n  However, they are outside the scope of this document.\n\n    [ People seriously interested in the whole area of system\n    performance, might want to look at the O'Reilly Nutshell Handbook\n    "System Performance Tuning" by Mike Loukides.  IMHO, it contains a\n    well-written, comprehensive treatment of system performance.  I'm\n    unaware of any other similar books.  --ed.]\n\n-----------------\nTable of Contents\n-----------------\n  0. Introduction & Administrivia\n  1. What about the "Other X FAQ"?\n  2.

To find out more about\n  them and how to access them, please see the "Introduction to the\n  news.answers newsgroup" posting in news.answers.\n\n  The main FAQ archive is at rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].  This document\n  can be found there in /pub/usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups.  If\n  you do not have access to anonymous ftp, you can retrieve it by\n  sending a mail message to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with the\n  command "send usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups" in the message body.\n\n-----------------------------\nWhat about the "Other X FAQ"?\n-----------------------------\n\n  David B. Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and\n  well written "comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions" document.\n  Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates\n  on performance.\n\n  The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with\n  regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be:\n	"Use X11R5, it is faster than R4".\n  (Please see the X FAQ for complete details).\n\n---------------\nWindow Managers\n---------------\n\n  There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different\n  features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a\n  balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this\n  point, most respondents have agreed upon "twm" as the best candidate\n  for a speedy window manager. \n\n  A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,\n  is turning off unnecessary things like "zooming" and "opaque move".\n  Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the\n  amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping\n  windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)\n\n  I've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka:\n  -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is\n  the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen)\n  and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the\n  display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted.\n\n------------\nThe X Server\n------------\n\nWhich Server?\n- - - - - - -\n  Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.\n  If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.\n\n  On my Monochrome Sun, I haven't noticed much difference between\n  the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to\n  me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute\n  to less paging.  \n         [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk),\n                        Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ]\n\n  How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law\n  (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be\n  compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.\n  You can expect to get "*very* large speedups in the server" by not\n  using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results\n  would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial\n  compilers on the market.\n\nLocking the Server into RAM?\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n  Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and\n  does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help\n  performance at all?  I've had one inquiry on this topic, and a few\n  pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone\n  who's tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try.  \n			  [thanks to: Eric C Claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com),\n				      Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be),\n				      Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ]\nStarting your Server\n- - - - - - - - - - -\n  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :\n    If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep\n    for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my\n    .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time...\n    we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.\n\n  This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!  \n\n  Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of\n  why this works, which I have summarized here:\n\n    When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to\n    start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by\n    the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of\n    pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the\n    server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you\n    put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself\n    sorted out before the clients start up.\n\n    Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X\n    client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources\n    being fetched, programs initializing state and "databases" and so\n    forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this\n    initialization is done ("The process has reached a steady state"),\n    the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.\n    By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your\n    .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your\n    workstation's limited resources\n\n  This is most definitely a "Your Mileage May Vary" situation, as there\n  are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap\n  space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients\n  you are starting, etc.\n\n  Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like:\n	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\n	(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &\n	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n\n  I've experimented with:\n	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\n	(sleep 2; exec xbiff ) &\n	(sleep 3; exec xterm ) &\n	(sleep 4; exec xterm ) &\n\n  I've even tried:\n	(sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &\n  and then in start_X_clients_script I had:\n	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\n	(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &\n	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n\n    [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had\n    completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down\n    into a "steady state" before the sleep expired and all my clients\n    were launched. ]\n\n  All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with\n  my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to\n  experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.\n\nFonts\n- - -\n  Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts\n  your applications use, you'll get speed increases in load-up time.\n\n  One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one\n  large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or\n  at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.\n  Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded\n  into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer\n  fonts will be loaded by the server.\n			      [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au),\n			        Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ]\n\n  eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13\n  in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since\n  I don't normally use 8x13, I've eliminated one font from my server.\n\n  Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com):\n    Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.\n    If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server.\n\nAbout the Resources File\n- - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n    Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves\n    on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)\n\n  One suggestion:\n\n    In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum\n    number of resources that you want to have available to all of your\n    applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true\n\n    Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific\n    resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your\n    .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH:\n\n	setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N\n\n    [ The "comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions" FAQ contains\n    an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.\n    --ed.]\n\n    So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from\n    .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,\n    and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same\n    XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system\n    app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to\n    find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files\n    with the same name.\n\n    This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666).\n		    [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com),\n		         Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov),\n		             and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu).\n	     Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]\n\n  This method of organizing your personal resources has the following\n  benefits:\n\n    - Easier to maintain / more usable.\n\n    - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER\n      property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally\n      quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.\n\n    - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort \n      through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.\n\n  It also has drawbacks:\n\n    - the application that you are interested in has to load an\n      additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to\n      make that much of a performance difference, and you might\n      consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an\n      application's resource database, you just need to re-run the\n      application without having to "xrdb" again.\n\n    - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When\n      your resources are split out into multiple resource files and\n      then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.\n      WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!\n\n      I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped\n      out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource\n      files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why\n      my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*\n      provide any error message when it encountered the C style\n      comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted\n      processing the resource file.\n\n      The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef\n      COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this\n      method of resource management.\n\n    - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For\n      example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their\n      resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.\n\n    - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files\n      with the machine where your resources are stored, your client\n      will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the\n      server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find\n      their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)\n\n  A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)\n  is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my\n  .Xdefaults file, and to use the "separate resources files" method for\n  clients that I seldom use.\n\nDefine Your Display Properly\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n  Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In\n  that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to \n  "<hostname>:0.0", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you\n  should set your DISPLAY variable to "unix:0.0" or ":0.0".  By doing this\n  you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same\n  machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.\n			[thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)]\n\n  See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further\n  explanation of how to properly set your display name.\n\n  "I don't think it's stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have\n  libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when\n  the DISPLAY isn't set specially."\n			      Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET)\n\n  [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change\n  stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set.\n  I don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle\n  non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.  Hopefully MIT\n  will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.  In the meantime, if\n  you want to try it yourself, email Jody.  --ed.]\n\n-------\nClients\n-------\n\n  If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think\n  carefully about the number of programs you are running.  Think also\n  about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there\n  a smaller clock program than xclock?\n\n  Unfortunately, I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large\n  they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.\n\n  [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients\n  (eg: Xclock, Xterm, Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.]\n\n  I've received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject\n  of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are\n  strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather\n  large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using\n  may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In\n  this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually\n  _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.\n\n  The upshot of all this seems to be: Don't mix toolkits.  That is, try\n  and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif\n  clients, etc).  If you use more than one, then you're dragging in\n  more than one toolkit library.\n\n  Know your environment, and think carefully about which client\n  programs would work best together in that environment.\n\n		  [Thanks to: Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET),\n      Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk | sinclair@uk.ac.gla.dcs) ]\n\nA Better Clock for X\n- - - - - - - - - - -\n\n1) xcuckoo\n   suggested by: Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk)\n   available: on export.lcs.mit.edu\n\n   Xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of *another* program.\n   Saves screen real estate.\n\n2) mclock\n   suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU)\n   available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in /X/mclock.shar\n\n   Non Xt-based.

[ Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com),\n		   Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) ]\n\n1) Xvt\n   suggested by: Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) :\n   available: export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/xvt-1.0.tar.Z\n\n   "...if you don't need all the esoteric features of xterm, then get\n   hold of xvt ...  it was written here just to save swap space as\n   xterm is rather a hog! "\n\n   This was written as a partial 'clone' of xterm.  You don't have to\n   rename your resources, as xvt pretends to be XTerm.

I've heard that\n   there are versions of xvt with this feature, but I've not found any\n   yet.\n\n   UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with\n   Brian Warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt.  He\n   questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For\n   instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling\n   speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap\n   bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also, while xterm\n   may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don't have any hard\n   numbers here, does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text\n   segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major.\n\n   As an experiment, he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm, but it\n   made little difference, since if you never use it, it never gets\n   brought into memory.\n\n   So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of\n   xvt over xterm.

Examining the what was\n    going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource\n    XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget\n    (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink.\n    Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the\n    widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user\n    can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not\n    noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference\n    on a [slower system].\n\n  This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots\n  of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor\n  embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server\n  requests?\n\n-------------------------\nMiscellaneous Suggestions\n-------------------------\n\nPretty Pictures\n- - - - - - - -\n  Don't use large bitmaps (GIF's, etc) as root window backgrounds.\n\n  - The more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server\n    is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc)\n\n  - These take up RAM, and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm\n    conscious of performance issues, I can't comprehend it when I see\n    people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window.\n\n    I'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by\n    having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.\n\n  - If you're anything like me, you need all the screen real estate\n    that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway.\n\n		      [ Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu) \n			for reminding me of this one. --ed.]\n\nA Quicker Mouse\n- - - - - - - -\n  Using xset, you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen\n  when you move your mouse.  I use "xset m 3 10" in my .xinitrc file,\n  which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of\n  the wrist.  See the xset man page for further ideas and information.\n\n  Hint: sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for\n  fine work.  To cover my options, I have placed a number of different\n  mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager.  \n\n  e.g. (for twm) :\n      menu "mouse settings" {\n        "Mouse Settings:"			f.title\n	"  Very Fast"				! "xset m 7 10 &"\n	"  Normal (Fast)"			! "xset m 3 10 &"\n	"  System Default (Un-Accelerated)"	! "xset m default &"\n	"  Glacial"				! "xset m 0 10 &"\n      }\n\nProgramming Thoughts\n- - - - - - - - - - -\n  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :\n    To speed up applications that you're developing, there are tons of\n    things you can do.  Some that stick out:\n\n    - For Motif programs, don't set XmFontList resources for individual\n      buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or\n      labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager\n      widget.  Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.\n\n    - Better yet, don't use Motif at all.  It's an absolute pig.\n\n    - Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them.\n      (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)\n\n    - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE\n      difference.\n\n    - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the\n      difference between a fast application and a completely unusable\n      one.\n\n  Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) :\n    Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc\n    function would greatly increase performance of Xt based\n    applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying\n    out the GNUY malloc, but I didn't find the time yet. I did some\n    tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the\n    differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)\n\n  [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.]\n\n  Andre' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) :\n\n  - Unnecessary NoExpose Events.\n\n    Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines, but\n    they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the\n    blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most\n    cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to\n    run through it's event-loop again and again.\n\n  - Thousands of XChangeGC requests.\n\n    This "Gfx Context Switching" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps,\n    where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed\n    again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching\n    and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will\n    remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the\n    connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).\n\nSay What!?\n- - - - - - \n  Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first:\n\n  David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org, by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) :\n    How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs\n    on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your\n    machine onto the other display. Goal: reduce context switches in the\n    same operation between client and server.\n\n  I'm not in a situation where I can easily try this, but I have received\n  the following confirmation...\n\n  Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se):\n    I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big\n    difference. I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage\n    and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. This\n    helps a lot on my poor little SS1+ with only 16 MB, it was\n    essential when I only had 8 MB.\n\n  Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) :\n    [The X11 Server and the client are] competing for the same CPU as\n    your server when you run it on the same machine.  Not really a\n    major problem, except that the X11 client and the server are in\n    absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing.\n\n  Timothy H Panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) :\n    Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU's are mostly idle, X's\n    cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate\n    doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they\n    are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your\n    action.\n\n    The second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2\n    cpu's halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going\n    over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved\n    buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing\n    even fewer context switches.\n\n----------------------------\nOther Sources of Information\n----------------------------\n\n  Volume 8 in O'Reilly's X Window System Series, ``X Window System\n  Administrator's Guide'' is a book all X administrator's should read.\n\n  Adrian Nye (adrian@ora.com):\n    A lot more tips on performance are in the paper "Improving X\n    Application Performance" by Chris D.

I'm trying to turn on Xauthorization using MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE on my servers\n(CPU heads, HP700RX Xterminals), but I'm running into a couple of problems.\n\nFirst, at least one of our applications (Maple) doesn't seem to understand \nhow to deliver the magic cookie, and won't run on a display with authorization\nturned on. \n\nSecond, we have people with client software on remote machines, and I\nreally don't want to hassle them with having to copy their .Xauthority\nfile to the remote machine... assuming that the clients there support\nXauthorization.\n\nSo, what I would like to do is turn on MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE by default, with\nnon-privileged users able to turn it off - dropping back to host-based\nauthorization.\n\n(Yes, I know how to turn it off by changing the Xconfig file for the\nheads and the Client Authorize setting for the Xterminals, but\nnon-privileged users can't do this.)\n\nI've checked with the HP Support Line, and there doesn't appear to be a way.\nCan anyone confirm this, or do you know of a way to accomplish what I\nwant?\n\nBTW, I'm running HPUX 9.0, and Vue 3.0.\n\nThanks in advance,\nRick\n-- \n\nRick McTeague\nElectrical Engineering Department, Speed Scientific School\nUniversity of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40292\n(502) 588-7020\n\nInternet: sysrick@starbase.spd.louisville.edu

This problem is caused by a bad interaction between the way olwm reparents\nwindows, a misfeature of the X protocol, and a bug in the Xt intrinsics.  \n\nThe Intrinsics bug is that it ignores the (x,y) position given in\nReparentNotify events.  Olwm is structured in such a way that, when a window\nis popped down, the last event the client receives is a ReparentNotify event. \nAt this point, the Intrinsics' notion of the shell's location is out of date.\n\nIf a SetValues is done using the same (x,y) position, the Intrinsics thinks it\nneeds to move the shell, so it issues a ConfigureWindow request to move it\nthere.  However, a (mis)feature of the X protocol is that a ConfigureWindow\nrequest that has no effect will generate no ConfigureNotify event.  The\nIntrinsics thus waits for an event that will never arrive, and times out after\nwmTimeout has expired.  (Actually, things are somewhat more complex because\nthe request is redirected to the window manager, but the net result is the\nsame.)\n\nThe solution is for the Intrinsics to note the (x,y) positioning information\nin ReparentNotify events.  This has been implemented and is available in X11R5\npublic fix 20.  This is XBUG 5513 for those of you who are interested in\ngorier details.\n\ns'marks

SCO ODT allows to adapt the X-Server to any non-standard (AT) keyboard \nusing the Xkeyboard configuration compiler xsconfig. SCO provides some\nconfiguration files in /usr/lib/X11/xsconfig/*.kbd, e.g. for \nSiemens WX200.\n\nQuestion:\nIs there anywhere a configuration file for the HP46021A keyboard\navailable ? \nI am especially interested in using the HP specific keys such as \n"InsertLine", "Menu".
Hi.\n\nI'm wonderring if it is possible to replace a single module, as XKeybind.o\nin a shared library, as libX11.so in Suns OpenWindows. I tried to RTFM, but\nI didn't get any wiser that way. Also, can I do the same on an RS6000 machine\nrunning 3.2.2 (if it is possible at all). I know how to do it with real \nlibraries (ar). I am trying to replace XLookupString in the delivered\nlibraries, with another that does a few special things.\n\n/Per\n--

Hello,\n\n	I am admin for an RS/6000 running AIX 3.2, X11R5, Motif, and xdt3.\n	I want to prevent the user from hitting CNTL-ALT-BKSPC to exit X.\n	\n	I've tried invoking X with 'xinit -T', but that doesn't work.\n	xinit appends the -T to the call to .xinitrc, and not to the\n	call to X.  \n\n	The man page to xinit is no help.  In fact, it tells\n	me that xinit is a script when it is really a binary file.  \n\n	So far, the only way I've been able to accomplish this feat is\n	to add the -T to the call to X in /usr/lpp/X11/defaults/xserverrc.\n	I would rather not do it this way.  Does anyone have any other ideas?\n\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Brian DeFord				Internet: deford@netwrx1.nw1.com	\n  Open Networks, Inc.

The MOTIF application consists of multiple Transient shells as children \nof a single TopLevel shell:\n\n+-----------+   +---------------+   +----------------+\n+-----------+   +---------------+ | +----------------+\n                                  |\n                                  | +----------------+\n                                  |-| TransientShell |\n                                  | +----------------+\n                                  |\n\nWhile a Transient shell is popped-up, my application modifies the \nsensitivity of a button in the TopLevel shell which is hidden by the \nTransient shell window.  When the Transient shell is popped-down, the \nbutton sensitivity is correct but the button text remains unchanged \n(i.e., solid/shaded).  Subsequent selection of the button causes the \ntext to revert to the correct visual state.\n\nWhen tracing event messages sent to the application, many of the events \nseen under mwm are not present under OpenWindows.
I have been using a HDS X-terminal, and really like it. What\nis really powerful is that it can run the X server without\nrunning a window manager. One can then run a special client\nX program called a window manager, either (1) run \nmotif or openlook from it's own firmware (limiting the network\ntraffic - but having no HOME). or (2) run motif or openlook\nfrom some home place (like a sparc, or vms).\n\nThis is powerful, especially since I can exit one window manager\n(without killing windows) and then start up another manager.\n(Some of my VMS tools need special meta-mouse combos that work in\none manager and not the other).\n\nWell the question is:\n\n  On a sparcstation running openlook, does anyone know how to\n  break apart olwm from the olwm_slave program? Basically I\n  want to run only the server, and go somewhere else to run\n  the window manager.\n\n---\nPlease respond my e-mail (as well as posting) because of the\nlarge volumes in window.X)\n\nThanks.
Hi,\n\nI am running X11R4 on an IBM RS/6000 (AIX 3.2) and X11R5 on a Sun4 (SunOS 4.1).\n\nSince I run X on both colour and black&white displays, I need different\nvalues for the same resource, so I want to use #ifdef COLOR in my\napplication defaults files. However, cpp is only invoked by xrdb, and\nnot when the resources are loaded on demand.\n\nIs there a proper solution to this?\n\nSo far, the only proper solution I've come to think of, is to create 2\ndifferent files in my ~/app-defaults/, say XTerm and XTerm-color, and\nset my XFILESEARCHPATH to either $HOME/%T/%N or $HOME/%T/%N-color.\nBut that does not always seem to work (e.g. executing a remote shell\ncommand without reading the .cshrc does not set XFILESEARCHPATH).\n\nFurthermore, I thought of using #include "XTerm" in XTerm-color.\nHowever, for resources in XTerm that I want to override in XTerm-color,\nthings are different on both machines. On a Sun, the FIRST found resource\nis used (i.e. the one from XTerm, the b&w one), while on an RS/6000, the\nLAST found value is used (i.e. the one from XTerm-color). What can I do\nabout it?\n\nI have one last question: for the specification of XFILESEARCHPATH, I\ncan use %T, %N, %C and %S. %T stands for app-defaults, %N for the\nresource class, but what do %C and %S stand for?\n\nThanks in advance for replying,\nMarcel.

Hmm, depends on how you define 'clean'. Jordan implemented the system\ndependent stuff in a way that you have basic implementations for,\ncall it, operating system types, then you go ahead and write a include\nfile for your specific machine or operating system using the basic\nimplementations. Since both Jordan and I haven't encountered a \nOS flavor yet, that is fully POSIX, we haven't gotten around to\nreally implement (and test) a top-level include file specifically\nfor just posix. The posix routines are used in the sun specific file\ntty_sun.i for example, but here we also use some bsd stuff. All in all\nit still is probably better to implement a include file for each and\nevery operating system than '#ifdef'ing in existing ones. The type\nof mess that can result from that can clearly be seen in the xterm\nsources. Even if quite a bit of code gets copied almost unchanged a \ncouple of times, this only uses up some disk space, since only the \n"drivers" actually included from the toplevel include file will be \ncompiled into emu.\n\nIt shouldn't be hard to come up with a tty_linux.i file that fully\nrelies on the posix stuff, but unfortunately I don't have a linux\nsystem available to me, so I can't do the port myself. I would suggest\nyou read the README in term/sysdep and if you have any problems or\nquestions, contact me and we could try to sort this out. Unfortunately\nwe have to rely on help from the net on this part of emu, since we \njust don't have access to that many different systems.\n\nMichael

Just create the window in the place you want it and set the program\nposition field in the WM_NORMAL_HINTS property, then map it.\n\nThen, assuming they have a non brain dead window manager, the user can\nsay whether they want to us program specified positions or not. For\ntvtwm the UsePPosition command in the .tvtwmrc will do this.\n\nNow, I'm sure that by the time this message gets out of our local news\ntimewarp someone will have advised you to set the user position bit in\nthe WM_NORMAL_HINTS. _Do_not_ do this.

I am looking for a  program to draw various kinds of diagrams on my Linux\nsystem.\n\n- It must be free.\n- It must run on standard (monochrome) X with a small screen size (800x600)\n  No motif/openlook etc.\n- It must compile under Linux with gcc/g++. Most generic unix software\n  works ok.\n- It must produce postscript files that I can include into LaTeX documents\n  with dvips. Or just tell me another free program that converts one\n  of the supported formats to ps.\n- It must produce drawings that are larger than the window size (scrollable).\n\nI know of several such programs, idraw, xfig. tgif. I have\nno experience with any of them. Features I would like in the programs are.\n\n- ability to draw circles, arcs, straight lines, boxes and arrows.\n- support for both dashed and solid line styles for all of these objects.\n- support for texts in any size.\n- ability to move/copy/resize/rotate any part of the drawing.\n- ability to turn any part of the drawing into a library component\n  (e.g. a transistor symbol composed of three lines, an arrow and a circle)\n- any aid (numeric coordinates, screen grid) to align parts of the drawing.\n- less essential, but in fact very handy: preservation of connection.\n  If I move one part of the drawing, the lines that connect that part to the\n  rest of the drawing, stay connected.\n\nIdeally I want the tool so general and flexible that it is comfortable to\ndraw electronic schematics, flow charts, logic diagrams, data flow diagrams\nand block diagrams with it. \n\nI just want to know which of the programs offer which of the features on my\nwhishlist and are there any other programs? How demanding are the programs\nwith respect to disk space, memory and CPU usage? Are any of the programs\nknown to work on Linux with monochrome X?

Free options\n	The BEST option is XFree86, which is an enhanced version of X386 1.2.\n	Any other version of X386 will have slower performance, and will\n	be more difficult to compile.  Information on how to obtain XFree86\n	is listed below.\n\n	X386 is the port of the X11 server to System V/386 that was\n	done by Thomas Roell (roell@sgcs.com).\n	It supports a wide variety of SVGA boards.\n	There are 2 major free versions: X386 1.1 is based on X11R4,\n	X386 1.2 is included in MIT's X11R5 distribution (ie. you\n	don't need to patch it into the MIT source any more).\n	X386 1.3 is the current commercial offering from SGCS (see below).\n\n2.

What is XFree86?\n\n   XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which was distributed with\n   X11R5.  This release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and\n   other enhancements.  Here are the highlights of the enhancements:\n\n    1) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86,\n       selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file.  Some SpeedUps require\n       an ET4000 based SVGA, and others require a virtual screen width of\n       1024.  The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by\n       default.  With a high-quality ET4000 board (VRAM), this can yield\n       up to 40% improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2.\n    2) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default\n       operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected.  This mode is now\n       equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b (X11R4), and approximately\n       20% faster than X386 1.2.\n    3) Support for LOCALCONN, compile-time selectable for server, clients,\n       or both.  This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4.  For SVR4.0.4\n       with the 'Advanced Compatibility Package', local connections from\n       SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported.\n    4) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets.\n       Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about\n       the ATI and Trident drivers.\n    5) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (Thomas Eberhardt's\n       code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu).\n    6) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included, and is\n       compile-time selectable.  There are contributed Type1 fonts in the\n       contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu.\n    7) New configuration method which allows the server's drivers and font\n       renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary\n       distributions.\n    8) Integrated support for 386BSD, Mach, and Linux.\n    9) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA\n       cards is now included.\n\n   The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2\n   (they were not in XFree86 1.1):\n\n    1) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of\n       available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200 \n       (see the X386(1) manual page for more information).\n    2) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the\n       monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a "two\n       headed" server - one VGA, and one Hercules.  So far this has only\n       been tested on SVR4 (it is also reported to work under Linux).\n    3) SVR3 shared libraries, tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1.\n    4) Support for SVR4.2 (There are some special considerations to\n       consider, due to new USL bugs; see the README.SVR4 file for\n       more information.)\n    5) Support for PS/2 mice, and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan (some \n       versions of these devices were not previously compatible).\n    6) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor\n       timing data, written by Eric Raymond (derived from previous\n       documentation and a lot of experimentation).\n    7) Greatly improved support for international keyboards, including\n       implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many \n       vendor servers (see the X386keybd(1) manual page for more \n       information).\n    8) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has\n       been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of\n       0.1 MHz.  Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks\n       line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server.\n    9) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig\n       configuration file.  Error messages are much more informative\n       and intuitive, and more validation is done.  There are many new\n       options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file (see the X386(1) \n       manual page for more information on the format of this file).\n\n       Plus a number of other small things.  Refer to the CHANGELOG file\n       in the source distribution for full details.\n\n   Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond, and the\n   current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat.\n\n4. What OSs are supported?\n\n    XFree86 supports:\n	SVR4.2: Consensys V4.2\n	SVR4.0: Microport, Dell, Esix, ISC, AT&T, MST, Consensys, UHC\n	SVR3: ISC 2.2 & 3.0, AT&T 2.2\n	Linux, Mach 386, 386BSD 0.1\n\n	BSD/386 is not supported, but it should work. The most active\n	BSD/386 person is Greg Lehey <grog@lemis.de>.\n\n	Note that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet,\n	but anyone should feel free to submit patches.\n	If you are interested in tackling this, send mail to\n	xfree86@physics.su.oz.au\n\n5. What video hardware is supported?\n\n   At this time, XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets:\n\n	Tseng ET4000\n	Tseng ET3000\n	Paradise PVGA1\n	Western Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11 (these are supersets of\n		the PVGA1, and use its driver)\n	Genoa GVGA\n	Trident TVGA8900C, TVGA9000\n	ATI 18800, 28800\n\n	All of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes,\n	with the exception of the ATI chipsets, which are only supported in\n	256 color mode.\n\n	The monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of\n	video memory in a single bank, and the Hercules card.  On the\n	ET3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome\n	server, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k.\n\n	It appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to\n	non-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies.  To\n	avoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree86\n	1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel\n	clock.  This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are\n	discovered.  Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on how\n	these programs work, if you need to write one.  If you do develop such\n	a program, the XFree86 team would be interested in including it with\n	future XFree86 releases.\n\n	If you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86,\n	it is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as the\n	Orchid ProDesigner IIs.  Avoid recent Diamond boards; XFree86 will not\n	work with them, because Diamond won't provide programming details.\n	In fact, the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamond\n	products, as long as such policies remain in effect.  Contributions\n	of code will NOT be accepted (because of the potential liabilities).\n	If you would like to see this change, tell Diamond about it.\n\n	Some people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISA\n	video cards. Theoretically, the means of communication between the\n	CPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility. It\n	could be ISA, EISA, or local bus.  What should matter is the chipset\n	on the video card.  Unfortunately, the developers don't have a lot\n	of access to EISA or VLB machines, so this is largely an untested\n	theory.  However, we have yet to see any reports of things not\n	working on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86\n	working fine on them.\n\n6. What about accelerated boards?\n\n	At this time, there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boards\n	like the S3, ATI Ultra (8514/A), TIGA, etc.  This support is available\n	in commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink (for SVR3 and SVR4).\n\n	An S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux.  Contact\n	<hasty@netcom.com> for 386BSD or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk> for Linux.\n\n	A beta 8514/A server is available for Linux. Contact <martin@cs.unc.edu>\n	or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>. Note: these servers are NOT part of XFree86.\n\n7. Why doesn't XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes?\n\n	The reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the\n	16-color modes.  In 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memory\n	contains 1 pixel.  But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit-\n	planes.  Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each\n	of each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes.  The MIT frame-\n	buffer code is not designed to deal with this.  If VGA handled\n	16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the MIT code\n	could be modified to support this (or it already may; I'm not sure).\n	But for the VGA way of doing things, a complete new frame-buffer\n	implementation is required.  Some beta testers are looking into this,\n	but nothing is yet available from the project.\n\n8. What other hardware or software requirements are there?\n\n	Obviously, a supported SVGA board and OS are required.  To run\n	X efficiently, 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum.\n	The various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space, depending\n	on the OS (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries).\n	To build from sources, at least 80MB of free disk space will\n	be required, although 120MB should be considered a comfortable \n	lower bound.\n\n9. Where can I get source for XFree86?\n\n	Source patches for the current version (1.2, based on X11R5 PL22\n	from MIT), are available via anonymous FTP from:\n		export.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/XFree86)\n		ftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86)\n		ftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86)\n	(For the rest of this FAQ, these 3 location will be called $FTP)\n\n	Refer to the README file under the specified directory for information\n	on which files you need to get to build your distribution.\n\n10. Where can I get binaries for XFree86?\n\n	Binaries are available via anonymous FTP from:\n		ftp.physics.su.oz.au		- SVR4 binaries\n			under /XFree86/SVR4\n		ftp.win.tue.nl			- SVR4 binaries\n			under /pub/XFree86/SVR4\n		ferkel.ucsb.edu			- SVR4 binaries\n			under /pub/SVR4/XFree86\n		stasi.bradley.edu		- SVR4 binaries\n			under /pub/XFree86/SVR4\n		blancmange.ma.utexas.edu	- SVR3 (ISC) binaries\n			under /pub/ISC\n		ftp.prz.tu-berlin.de            - SVR3 (ISC) binaries\n			under /pub/pc/isc/XFree86\n		tsx-11.mit.edu			- Linux binaries\n			under /pub/linux/packages/X11\n		agate.berkeley.edu		- 386BSD binaries\n			under /pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86\n		ftp.cs.uwm.edu			- Mach binaries\n			under /i386\n\n	Ensure that you are getting XFree86 1.2 - some of these sites may\n	archive older releases as well.  Each binary distribution will\n	contain a README file that describes what files you need to take\n	from the archive, and which compile-time option selections were\n	made when building the distribution.\n\nIV) What general things should I know about running XFree86?\n\n11. Installation directories\n\n	The top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot\n	(/usr/X386, by default) variable in config/site.def. Binaries, include\n	files, and libraries are installed in $ProjectRoot/{bin,include,lib}.\n\n	This can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modified\n	via symbolic links for those OSs that support them. This directory is\n	nonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installed\n	alongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation.\n\n12. Configuration files\n\n	The XFree86 server reads a configuration file ("Xconfig") on startup.\n	The search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented in\n	the server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions.\n\n13. Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes\n\n	David E Wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of known\n	clock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings.\n	The database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt, and\n	is in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. This database is\n	also available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept on\n	export.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z, which is updated\n	occasionally.  Obtain a copy of this database.  It just might have the\n	settings you need.  If you create new settings, please send them to\n	David for inclusion in the database.\n\n	If this doesn't help you, the VideoModes.doc (by Eric Raymond) file \n	with XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings.\n	It may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and use\n	this description to get them right.  When you do, send the information\n	to David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database.\n\n	NOTE: The old 'clock.exe' program is not supported any more, and\n	      is completely unnecessary.  If you need to determine dot\n	      clock values for a new board, remove the 'Clocks' line from\n	      your Xconfig file (if present), and start the server.  The\n	      server will probe for clocks itself and print them out.\n	      You can use these values to put a 'Clocks' line into your\n	      Xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up\n	      starting the server in the future.\n\n14. Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit\n\n	If you have installed the server Binary Link Kit, it is possible to\n	reconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server.  This is\n	fully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit.\n\nV) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86?\n\n	First of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755).\n\n15. SVR4\n	Why won't my xterm run properly?\n\n	If your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should define\n	CONSEM=no in you environment. Otherwise xterm won't run.\n	csh users should use 'setenv CONSEM no'\n\n	The Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping\n	problems with XFree86.  It recommended that this patch not be\n	installed.  Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap.\n\n16. SVR3\n\n	Make sure you look at $FTP/README.ISC, if that's what you are running.\n\n17. 386BSD\n\n	Make sure you look at $FTP/README.386BSD.\n\n	Also, a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey\n	<Rich@Rice.edu>.  The latest version should be available in the\n	file XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites:\n\n	    agate.berkeley.edu:/pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\n	    wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\n	    grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\n\n18. Linux\n\n	You must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gcc\n	jump libraries installed.\n\n	Make sure the binaries X386, X386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root.\n\n	If your kernel doesn't have TCP support compiled in, you'll have to\n	run the server as "X -pn". The default startup configuration assumes\n	that TCP is not available. If it is, change the two files\n	/usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers, removing the\n	-pn argument to X386.\n\n	Make sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major\n	number 4, minor number 0. Also note that if /dev/console is not\n	owned by the user running X, then xconsole and xterm will not permit\n	console output redirection. Xdm will properly change the owner, but\n	startx won't.\n\n	When running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it with\n	a tty, for example "xdm < /dev/console &".\n\n	For more detailed information, please read the file README present\n	with the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu.\n\n19. Mach\n\n	Make sure you look at $FTP/README.Mach.\n\nVI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source?\n\n	This section has been removed from the FAQ, since it is\n	fully explained in $FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs.\n	Please look at those files for information on building XFree86.\n\nVII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86?\n\n20. BSD compatibility library\n\n	A lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy(), etc.\n	The default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.a\n	which contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(),\n	seed(). A better way of providing the 'b' functions is to include\n	<X11/Xfuncs.h> in source files that call them.  Xfuncs.h provides macro\n	definitions for these in terms of the SYSV 'mem' functions.  If you are\n	linking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these\n	functions, then you should link with libXbsd.a\n\n21. ANSICCOPTIONS\n\n	This is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the\n	ANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite\n	the entire CCOPTIONS line.  For example, with stock MIT, you'd see\n	something like\n		CCOPTIONS="-ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings"\n	and to get rid of the ANSI-ness, the developer would have to put\n		CCOPTIONS="-O2 -fwritable-strings"\n	in his Imakefile.  With this change, you would see a default of\n		ANSICCOPTIONS="-ansi"\n		CCOPTIONS="-O2 -fwritable-strings"\n	and all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is:\n		ANSICCOPTIONS=\n	to get rid of the ANSI-ness (many X clients will die a horrible death\n	with -ansi).  The effect is even more dramatic in practice, because\n	CCOPTIONS is actually quite complex.  The other issue is that one must\n	add 'ANSICCOPTIONS=$(ANSICCOPTIONS)' to a PassCDebugFlags definition.\n\nXFree86 Contact Information\n\n    Ongoing development planning and support is coordinated by the XFree86\n    Core Team.  At this time the Core Team consists of:\n\n	The original "gang of four":\n		David Dawes <dawes@physics.su.oz.au>\n		Glenn Lai <glenn@cs.utexas.edu>\n		Jim Tsillas <jtsilla@damon.ccs.northeastern.edu>\n		David Wexelblat <dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com>\n\n	Those supporting non-SYSV operating systems:\n		Robert Baron <Robert.Baron@ernst.mach.cs.cmu.edu> [Mach]\n		Rich Murphey <Rich@Rice.edu> [386BSD]\n		Orest Zborowski <obz@kodak.com> [Linux]\n\n    e-mail sent to <xfree86@physics.su.oz.au> will reach all of the core team.\n\n	--------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks to all the people who already sent me corrections or additions,\nespecially David Wexelblat (one of the major contributors of updates).

Hello, I hope this is the right group to post this in.\n  I've got a little problem.  I finally managed to get a REAL operating\nsystem (Linux, as opposed to MS-Dos) and I like it alot.  But, when I\ntry to run 'startx', I get a strange response: My monitor goes into\ngraphics mode and I get this big white rectangle on the screen - that's\nall! Nothing else!  Now, I've collected almost every FAQ in the world to\nhelp me but either it's too confusing or I must be missing something.\n  My setup:\n	386DX (about 20Mhz)\n	Trident 8900C SVGA (w/1 Meg)\n	4 MB RAM\n	Plenty of HD space\nAny help is appreciated.\nThanx.
please subscribe me.
Im new to Xlib programming. Im having a problem I hope someone here can\nhelp me with. I create a window, and I want it to have some background color,\nsay red, and draw an oval in it. Further, when I resize the window, I want\nto be able to redraw the image so that is fills the new window (whether it\nis larger or smaller.) Im using AIXwindows on an RS6000.\n\nMy problem is this: when I resize the window, only the "original" part of the\nwindow that was part of the window creation gets drawn into. Everything else\nis a grey..the oval "tries" to redraw itself but gets clipped. I can see that\nit WOULD be the right size if I could see all of it, but it only shows up in\nthe region that was the original size of the window when created.\n\nFor example, I start out the window at 200x200 in width and height. If I\nresize it to 400x400, the only part that has any color drawn into it is\nis from the origin out to 200x200..the rest is grey. Further the oval\nonly shows up in that 200x200 area.\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?? How can I get a window to resize and redraw a \nre-scaled image in it to take up the full size of the window?\n\nSecond question:\nCould someone tell me what Xaw and Xmu are???

Is it possible to have xdm put up a multi-line greeting?  If so, how do\nI specify such a thing in the Xresources file?  I don't have much\n(anything) for X books, so I can't look it up.

You don't mention your platform but Digital has a custom widget, NetEd, \nwhich does exactly what you want to do. Cost is nominal 300 or so - call your\nlocal office.  The widget is supported on a variety of platforms and I heard\nrumblings of porting to Sun, etc. so it may be worth the check.
We are making a transition from NextStep to X-windows. I am trying to find the best GUI tool for our needs.  I have looked at several tools but they all seem basically the same (each salesman will beg to differ). I realize that there are differences but I don't have an infinate amount of time to discover what they are. The tools I have looked at so far are UIM/X, X-designer, Tele-Use, tcl/tk,Interviews, and SUIT. \nSo far I've drawn the following conclusions:\n\n1) The builder for Interviews is not very mature, bad docs\n2) Tele-Use is very expensive and uses a proprietary toolkit\n3) UIM/X & X-designer seem about the same, even though X-designer does not have a interpreter (I'll by Centerline if I need one)\n4) tcl/tk is a little buggy\n5) I know very little about the ICS Builder (just have the sales info)\n6) Due to a corporate agreement X-designer is much cheeper than any other comercial product.\n7) For the time I'm spending I could have bought all of them (well different money)\n8) We will have to live with any shortcomings and make it work\n9) this type of tool seems great, but noone seems to talk about them on the net. Is there another news group for this ?\n10) SUIT cost too much for comercial development.\n\nI'm hoping someone out there has a strong opinion on at least one of these products.\n\nthanks
When attempting to connect to an SGI Indigo from a PC clone using\na commercial X windows emulation package, the X package hangs in\na pre-login X screen mode.  The login box won't display.  Using\nthe package in 'telnet' mode, I can logon to the SGI, and run any\nnone graphic type things.  On the PC I get an error:\n"Read error 0 on socket 1"  (raw socket error)\n\nOn the SGI, in xdm-errors:\nI get a termination error when I kill the stalled screen on the PC\n\nOn the SGI, in SYSLOG:\n<date><time><SGI> xdm[#]:Hung in XOpenDisplay(<remote>:0, aborting\n  "                  "  :server open failed for <remote>:0, giving up\n\nI have all access control disabled (I believe, SYSLOG message confirms\nthis when I login on the SGI).  I believe I have the SGI set up properly\nas described in the X ADm. book by O'Rielly....\n\nThe X emul package tech support hasn't been able to solve the problem.\n\nSo what I'm looking for is some suggestions on where to look for problems,\nand possible tests to run to narrow down the questions.\nThanks
<It seems silly, but while I've located things like tgif that can  edit\n<gif  files, and various tools to convert to/from gif format, I haven't\n<been able to locate a program that just opens a window and displays  a\n<gif file in it.

Can anybody tell me anything about the availibility of non-Roman fonts\nfor X-Windows? Especially Unicode and/or han idiographic fonts.\n\nAlso, how about conversion tools for getting PC/Macintosh fonts into a\nformat suitable for X? I would assume it is not too difficult for\nbitmap fonts.\n\nThe FAQ's for this group and comp.fonts are not very helpful on these\nquestions.
Hello Xperts out there.\nI've just built X11R5 for SunOS 4.1.1/SPARC.\nI have gcc-2.2 and I'd like to use its 64-bit capability\nto generate an X11 release which will render to the frame\nbuffer using store-double (64-bit) machine code.\nCan anyone tell me which directories/source files/\ncompiler switches to begin with?\n\nthanks in advance
Thanks for all the responses. I've made contact with the UK distributor :-)
In X10, the drawing attributes were bundled into drawing\nrequests;  that is, the server's drawing model was stateless.\n\nThis caused problems with performance and network traffic,\nso the X11 redesign included the graphic context to codify\nthe drawing state.  Most application designers who want to\ndraw things in several different colors create a GC for\neach color during initialization, then pass the GC id in\neach drawing request.
So what? I'm running emu on a 25 MHz 68020 box. I cannot make out ANY\ndifference in performance whether the cursor is set to blinking or\nnot (If you think about it a bit, a cycle of 400 ms is a hell a lot of\ntime for even the slowest PC). Since you would of course only enable\nthe blinking text cursor when your xterm has the input focus, this \napplication is active anyway. To repeat it, a blinking text cursor\ncosts almost nothing in performance, it just needs some thought when\ndesigning the xterm software.\n\nMichael
Three q's:\n\n1) is it reliable?\n\n2) how does it send the information from a MS Windows app over\nthe X11 protocol? Does it just draw everything as graphics into\none window, or does it use multiple windows and essentially work\nmore cleverly?\n\n3) If I want to run MS Word, for example, remotely, do I have to\nrun a separate copy of MS Windows remotely, and then start MS\nWord from that, or can MS Word be started remotely on its own?
Hello,\n\n\nOur application requires us to capture keypad presses for all windows\nin a number of applications.  We are trying to use action translation\ntables to implement this.  We have only succeeded by assigning the\ntranslation table to every individual widget in all windows in a single\napplication.  The Xt calls we make are included below.\n\nIt would be much more convenient if we could assign the translation\ntable to a class of widgets rather than individual widget instantiations,\nand also accomplish it for MULTIPLE applications.  If someone could\ndescribe how do this it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nPlatform: Sun Sparc w/ X11R4 & Motif 1.1.4\n\n***********************************************************************\n\nstatic XtActionsRec actionsTable[] = {\n        {"up", do_up},\n        {"right", do_right},\n        {"middle", do_middle},\n        {"left", do_left},\n        {"down", do_down},\n	{"bye", quit},\n};\n\nstatic char defaultTranslations[] = \n		"<Key>KP_8: up() \n\\n		 <Key>KP_6: right() \n\\n		 <Key>KP_5: middle() \n\\n		 <Key>KP_4: left() \n\\n		 <Key>KP_2: down() \n\\n		 <Key>KP_1: bye()"; \n\nXtTranslations	trans_table, trans_table2;\n\n(. . .)\n\n    XtAddActions(actionsTable, XtNumber(actionsTable));\n    trans_table = XtParseTranslationTable(defaultTranslations);\n\n    widget = XtCreateManagedWidget("msg", xmPushButtonWidgetClass,\n		form, wargs, n);\n\n    XtOverrideTranslations(widget, trans_table);
In the list you mentioned, tgif handles everything except rotation and\nany size text.  It only supports 90 degrees rotation.  Currently, it\nsupports 11 (X11R4 standard) font sizes.  However, it allows arbitrary\nscaling of the entire drawing.  Effectively, it allows any font sizes, but\nyou can only have 11 different sizes per drawing.\n\nTgif takes up 850K (compiled with -O option) on a SPARCstation.  I was told\nthat it compiles under Linux, but I haven't tried it yet.  It works with\nboth color and monochrome X.
check prep.ai.mit.edu.  It's called fax-3.2.1.tar.Z or something to\nthat effect and is the software for netfax. Be forewarned that it\nrequires (at the moment) a fairly costly $450 fax modem with certain\ncapabilities to use it.

Sorry, that's a feature.  The ICCCM specifies how the app should set its title, so the wm is obliged to do it.  If this bothers you, complain to the app writer.\n\n\nWrite your own wm that doesn't support the ICCCM.  Or write an program that you give a window ID and a title.  The your program can set the windows title for the app and then if the app changes it, your program switches it back again.

Well, thanks largely to subscribers of this group, here's xrastool 1.0,\nthe animation package I started just over 3 weeks ago. A number of the\nsolutions provided through discussions here have been incorporated in\nthe code, so have a look! The full blurb has been posted to\ncomp.windows.x.announce.\n\nThis post is in two parts. To unpack the source code, extract the\narticles into file1 and file2 (for example). Use a text editor to\nremove leading and trailing text at the "---cut here---" markers\n(including the markers themselves). Next type "cat file1 file2 >\nfile", then "uudecode file" and "zcat xrastool1.0.tar.Z | tar xvf -".\nRead the README file for instructions on how to proceed from there.\nEnjoy!\n\nDerek\n\nP.S.

We've just recently upgraded our X11 to R5 and are now running into problems\nwith some of our applications that use Motif 1.1.  It appears that pointer to\nthe widget being passed to the callback function (i.e., the "w" of\n(w, client, call) ) is nil.  The client and call pointers are okay in some\ninstances, but bogus in other instances.\n\nWe are running SunOS 4.1.2 on a Sun 4.  After compiling X11R5 and all 23\npatches (with the MotifBC flag set), we recompiled Motif and then we \nrecompiled the application.\n\nDid we skip a step or leave something out?  Is there a flag that we should\nhave used?  Should we have left Motif alone?\n\nAny answers or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks\nKathy
I'm running xterm under X11R5, Motif 1.1, mwm and UNIX SVR4 on a UNISYS\n386 based machine. My default shell is /bin/csh or the C shell. Whenever\nI run xterm, I get the following message before the first C shell prompt:\n\nWarning: no access to tty; thus no job control in this shell...\n\nAfter this, I can't run any job control commands like fg, bg etc. Also,\nI can't run another xterm from the command line of this xterm (I can only\nlaunch additional xterms from a .mwmrc menu).\n\nI'd appreciate some help with this problem, or pointers to where I can get\nsome help. By the way, my environment variable TERM is set to xterm.\n\n----------------------------\nSaad Mufti\nPersonal Library Software

Hi,\n\n    Does anyone know how to redirect the stdout and stderr of a program to\n    a callback function in X ? The program does not fork() a child process\n    so I guess I can't use pipes.\n\n    Can anyone help ?\n\n    Thanks,
...\n\nBadWindow is an X protocol error.  If you write a custom error handler\nwhich does not do "exit(1);" the error handler will return and let\nyour program carry on.  So, using a XSetErrorHandler is the way to\ngo, but never mind the longjmp.

I need some advice regarding monitor to use with Xfree86. I have an ET4000\nbased graphic card with 1 Meg of memory. I know this card is supported in\nXfree86 because a friend of mine has one of these in his PC. His monitor is\n17" colour capable of displaying 1280x1024 resolution. I cant afford this kind\nof expensive monitor. I heard from somewhere that Xfree86 requires multisync\nmonitor with minimum horizontal scan frequency of 60KHz. Is this true?\nI would only like to use Xfree86 at resolution of 800x600 in 256 colours and\nso was thinking of buying a cheap 14" SVGA monitor. Interlaced (Cheap)14" SVGA \nmonitors only have have maximum horizontal scan frequency of about 38KHz.\nWill this kind of monitor work with Xfree86? \n\nPlease reply by email.\n\nThaks in advance.
Hi folks,\n\nI'm trying to compile xfig 2.1.7 on a SS1+ running SunOS 4.1.1 and OW 2.0,\nand I'm having a little trouble with make/imake.  Specifically, make bombs\nwhen it needs to use any Xaw file.  This isn't surprising since X11 files\non Suns with the standard OW 2.0 distribution are in various places under\n/usr/openwin (Xaw files are in /usr/openwin/share/include/X11/Xaw !!)\nActually, the real problem is that I know squat about imake, and I don't\nknow how to tell imake where the X11 files are.  I can see from the \nMakefile that it's looking in the wrong places, but the first line of the \nMakefile reads \n\n   # Makefile generated by imake - do not edit!\n\nHelp!  Is there some way I can edit the Imakefile to tell it where to\nlook?  (I have set DEFINES = -DOPENWIN_BUG, as it said to in the README\nfile.)\n\nEmail and post are both fine.\n\nThanks in advance,
I've written an application for SparcStation 2 GX+, under OpenWindows 3.0.\n\nThe application uses XView stuff to create my window, and the SUN XGL\ngraphics library for rendering into the Canvas.\n\nThe application does real-time 2-D animation, but it does not update the\nthe display fast enough.\nI'm using notify_set_itimer (XView call) to periodically kick off my\nupdate routine, and it's not happening fast enough. I want it to\nupdate 25 times / second. It's only doing about 11. Also, it appears to\nbe compute bound, because if I run anything else while my appplication is\nup, the update rate slows down even more.

While I have respect for John's ability and integrity, I really regret his\nleaving just after a major release (or, more accurately, making the release\njust before leaving).

Without John to adjudicate, and everybody\nposting fixes that work for *them*, chaos is inevitable; let's hope it is\ntemporary.

I am wondering how to change the English fonts in an existed \nAPI to some multi-bytes fonts ? (such as Chinese, Japanese...)\nSomeone told me X11R5 supports some internationalization\nfeatures, but I cannot find any examples for my need. Is there\nanybody has done some similar jobs ?\n\nBy the way, all the English fonts should be replace by Chinese or\nJapanese fonts, that means in windows, menubar, button....\n\nThat will be great if someone can share us what you have done.\nThanks in advance.

An application we *must* use requires upper-case input.  I'd like to be\nable to simply move my cursor into the window where that application is running\n(just a text window, xterm or some such) and have everything I type be entered\nas ALL CAPS.  When the cursor is in any of my many other windows, I want to\nautomatically return to normal functionality.

Any\nhints would be most appreciated.  I program in C but not X, although I can\npick up somthing that's not too involved.\n\nThanks kindly.

Hi! I've just installed the new XArchie 2.0.1 and it all works\nfine, except:\n\non our grayscale xterm the custom icons compiled into the\nprogram don't work at all, but on the BW terminal it works fine.\nI can set the icon to an xbm file with .twmrc, but that doesn't\ngive the neat-o change when busy action. (Other programs with\nsimilar actions, e.g. xmail, xbiff, work fine.)\n\nThe X-interface author, George Ferguson, suggests it might be a\nproblem with the X intrinsics, but isn't willing to hack around\nto fix it himself. But I know zero about X programming, so I\ndon't think I can find it. \n\nDoes anyone out there know an obvious fix for the problem?\n\nAndrew

That's expected. The first sentence describing the bitmap resource in the\nMenuButton section of the "Athena Widget Set - C Language Interface"\ndocumentation states\n\n      bitmap      A bitmap to display instead of the label.\n\nOne way round this might be to make use of the button's backgroundPixmap\nresource, but remember that you, or a user of your application, won't be able\nto set it from a resource file. Also, the button won't automatically be the\nsize of the bitmap. The bitmap will be tiled if necessary, or you could set the\nbutton's dimensions to match its size.\n\nJim
May I humbly suggest DESQview/X? (Of course, I'm biased...)\n\nDESQview/X is a multitasker for DOS computers, that uses a standard\nX11R4 server as it's display mechanism.

(Often, you only need to create a new makefile!)\n\nIf you're interested in more details, you can check out the usenet group\ncomp.os.msdos.desqview, or just email me directly at support@qdeck.com,\nand I'd be happy to fill you in.

Hi,\n\nI'm working on a project that involves storing an application's rendering\nto an X display and then playing it back again.  Rather than \n"reinvent the wheel", it like to find:\n	* a file format for saving X protocol.\n	* software that saves and replays such a session.\n\nAny ideas out there?  I've heard that there is a version of Xscope\nthat will save and replay sessions.\n\nI'd be willing to share much of the code I develop back to the X community.\n\n\nAxel............

Hi there\n\n(I posted this to comp.windows.x.intrinsics but got no response, so I'm posting\nhere.)\n\nI'm wanting to connect a digitiser made for PCs into my workstation (an HP 720).\nIt is my understanding the X windows can understand a variety of input devices\nincluding digitiser tablets.  However, this digitiser makes use of the serial\nport, so there would seem to be a need to have a special device driver.\n\nThe HP manual pages say that the HP X server will accept X input from\ndevices listed in the /usr/lib/X11/X*devices file (* = display number).\nI shouldn't think I would be able to simply insert /dev/rs232c as an input\ndevice in this file and expect a digitiser to work.  But maybe I'm wrong.  Am I?\n\nWhat I would like to know is: does anybody out there have a digitiser connected\nto their workstation for use as a pointer for X (rather than just as input to a\nspecific X application)?  If so, what were the steps required for installation?\nDid you need a special device driver?  Did the manufacturer supply it?  Are\nthere generic public domain device drivers around?  (I understand that\ndigitisers generally use only a couple of standard formats.)\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nCheers\n- Vaughan
Users can't find the cursor?  Run "xneko" - it'll turn the cursor into a\nmouse (rodent variety (-: ).  If your users still can't find it, the cat will!
You don't give the precise error message, but I assume that\nthe making of the target fails, because make can't find the rules.\n\nWe've seen this happen with SunOS 5.x make as well and aat this\npoint I'm not sure why it happens. It seems to happen\nwith large Makefiles. The entries near the end get lost.\nSmall changes in the makefile will remedy this problem,\nas it does in your example.\n\nIn the MIT R5 distribution + R5.SunOS5.patch this can happen with\nthe target ``Makefiles'' in one of the doc directories.\n\n\nThis is really weird. Are your *really* sure that you were using GNU make?

Well, I'm glad that there's plenty of NT stuff at Xhibition.\nNot because I want to use it instead of X, but because I want to \nfind out what the chances are that some time in the future I may \nnot have any choice.
I'm posting this request again since the last one had no title.\n \n  I'm looking for X server software on DOS or Windows.\n \n  I've already seen Desqview/X and XVision but would like to be aware\n of other solutions, namely public domain or shareware implementations.\n \n  I'd also like to know, in the commercial case, about possible problems,\n incompatibilities, available window managers and libraries, etc.\n \n  If you have any experiences in this area please let me know.\n \n\n  C U!\n \n  By(e)
I was wondering this myself.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately it does.  I don't agree with the logic of NT at an X windows\nconference.  Perhaps some good will come of it, but the two are so dissimilar\nand the NT marketing stuff is so large in the Xhibition adds that I was \ncoming to a similar conclusion as Jesse...
Hi ppl,\n\nI am running XFree386 under Linux SLS1.0 and am trying to get the german\nkeyboard working. I have already recompiled my kernel and the german\nkeyboard in the textmode works just fine.\nI have found out, that there is a preconfigured german keymap for X\ncalled Xmodmap.gr in /usr/lib/X11, so I ran xmodmap /usr/lib/X11/Xmodmap.gr.\nMy first impression was very good, I was able to get Z and Y straight :)\nThere's still a little problem I can't solve however:\nI cannot get at the backslash, bar, brackets and curly brackets.\nThe ALT-GR key doesn't seem to work.\nI tried xev to find out whether it produces an event at all and it does.\nLooking up its keycode (113) in the Xmodmap I found the entry "Mode_switch"\nwhich doesn't ring any bell. The entries for the keys I cannot use seem\nto be correct. Example: keycode XX = ssharp questn backslash\nThe first 2 entries I can even get at. The first one is the unmodified\nkey and the second is the key with shift, but what is the 3rd??\nMy guess is that it should be the key with ALT-GR but it isn't.\nIf anybody has run into similar problems and knows how to solve them,\nhelp would be appreciated.\n\nCU
Has anybody built an X11R5 server that can run on a Personal Decstation\n5000 line with ultrix 4.3?  The only catch is that being "personal" machines,\nwe did not install DECnet onto them, which the Xdec server on gatekeeper\nrequires.

Wasn't the shareware fee a "suggestion" by John?\nIs so then it's up to the individual to make the choice whether or not to\nhonour it and part with money.

Is it possible to get an xterm scrollbar to come out on the right\nside instead of the left?\n\nRon Shenk
Xt(App)AddTimeout doesn't work in xterm, because, despite appearances \nto the contrary, xterm is not really an Xt based application.  "Other\nsources" like timeouts and inputs are never checked in xterm's main\nloop. So don't be surprised when you try this and it doesn't work.\n\n--

Does anyone know of any free X-servers for PCs, preferably that run under\nMS Windows? THANKS.
Check into the vopl and vogle libraries.  I beleive that I still have\nthem available on ftp.c-mols.siu.edu but I'm not sure.  I haven't seen\nany new announcements for the software but I'm sure it's still around.\n\nI have used it to do real-time data display and analysis as well as\njust for producing graphs after the fact.  It works well and supports\nnumerous graphics output formats (including X.)  I tried it and liked\nit.  YOu may as well.
Here's a listing that I came accross a while ago.  This question seems to \ncome up often enough that I figured this would be of interest.  Note that \nthe server "X Appeal" for DOS is available in demo form on the internet via \nanonymous ftp.  This is one way of quickly checking out the feasability of \nusing your system as an X server.

hi, is there anybody has some example programs about using\n the internationalization features in X11R5 ? Such as a small\n X program just to show Chinese texts in wondows, menu bar or\n icons... Thanks in advance.
Or the library might be there but not pointed to by LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
You are stuck in a distributed system feedback loop!  What if you are on an\nXterminal or running xterm over the net to another machine?  That is when the\nload problems occur.  If you had a machine with 20 Xterminals attached and\nthey all had blinking cursors in xterm's, this could represent a considerable\nethernet bandwidth waste.\n\nI'm not picking on you, just people keep forgetting that there is a lot of life\nout there besides distributed or singleuser "Workstations"!
I forot to mention the free widget foundation which maintains a freely\navailable set of widgets.  Info on this group can be gotten from \nfree-widgets-request@kazoo.cs.uiuc.edu   this list is maintained by volunteers\nand you may subscribe to a mailing list which discusses various \naspects of using and abusing these widgets\n\nBrian
Most graphics systems I have seen have drawing routines that also specify\na color for drawing, like\n\nDrawpoint(x,y,color) or Drawline(x1,y1,x2,y2,color) or\nFillrectangle(x1,y1,x2,y2,color) \n\nWith X, I have to do something like \nXSetForeground(current_color)\nXDrawPoint(d,w,x,y)\n\nWhy split this into two functions? Why did X designers decide to not associate\nthe color with the object being drawn, and instead associate it with the\ndisplay it is being drawn on?
I've found that I have to add the "-8" option for displaying JPEGs\nwith the new version.  For some reason, if I don't, it goes into\n24-bit mode and the resulting image is displayed with 216 colors \n(from a 6x6x6 array) instead of 256 and looks grainier.  Since I'm\non the ubiquitous 8-bit pseudo color display I would have thought it\ncould tell that.

hi,\n\ntry DontZap in /usr/lib/X11/Xconfig\n\ncu\n	styx
Rather than write my own, can anyone direct me to a package that will let me create\ncascaded popup menus in X windows.  For reasons of portability, the package should \nnot rely on any X toolkit other than XLib and the XT Intrinsics.  Something written\nin C++ would be nice, too.
Bandwidth is unlikely to be the problem, except over a wet string network.\nOne of major flaws of X is the horrendous number of transactions (and\nhence process switches) that it forces upon a host.  Actual measurements\n(hourly average) are 5 per second per logged in user, which can lead to\n20-50 or more process switches (depending on whether each event is\nfiltered by the window manager as well as the applications and how\nmany processes are needed for each character.)\n\nWhile a blinking cursor needs only the application and the networking\nprocess, and does not add any transactions, it will add something like\n10 process switches per second per user.  This is a significant increase\nin overhead, especially as the application may have quite a large working\nset.  If you want a rapidly blinking cursor, there could be as many\nas 50.\n\nIf you want to go there, I wouldn't start from here!
Does anyone know of a source (book, file, etc.) of ALL the standard \nresource names in X11R5? A small description of what the resource\nIS would also be helpful, but not vital. Any help in which direction\nto go would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks. \nRobin Kinzy\n\n =================================================================\n =================================================================

Hi,\n\nI am using xdm on X11R5 with OW3 and Xview3 on Sun3s and SPARCs running \nSunOS 4.1.1.  Prior to using xdm, I used to set PATH and other environment\nvariables (like MANPATH, HELPPATH, ARCH, etc) in my .login file.  With xdm,\nthe .login file doesn't get executed and therefore neither the olwm\nroot-window nor my applications know about these variables.\n\nI used the "DisplayManager._0.userPath" resource in /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config\nto succesfully pass the PATH variable.  But I am having problems passing anything else!!!  I tried execing $HOME/.login in /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xsession\nbut that didn't help.  I also tried using\n	"DisplayManager.exportList: HELPPATH MANPATH ARCH"\nwhich didn't work either.\n\nI would appreciate any help on this matter.\n\nThanks in advance,\nShash
Greetings,\n	We have a network of ~20 Sun Workstations, running SunOS 4.1.1\nand Openwindows 3.  7 of these are Sun 3's that we have modified to\nrun Seth Robertson's xkernel image, effectively turning them into\nxterminals.  We use xdm (X11R4) to manage the displays.\n\n	When we had 3 xkernel machines, things worked fine, but when\nwe installed 4 more last weekend, we appear to have found a weakness.\nWith 7 clients to 1 Sparc 2, the Sparc 2 window manager is eventually\ngetting munged.  \n\n	Let me try to be precise:  The user sitting at the machine\nthat does all the actual processing for these xterminals is having\ncontrol of his keyboard and screen yanked away.  (When this was the\ndepartment chair, it was kind of cute).  We poked at xdm for a few\ndays and are satisfied that it is not at fault.  Our current theory is\nthat olwm (the Sun version) was not meant for running multiple copies\non one machine (which is what happens -- the console user runs olwm,\nand every xterminal logged in has olwm running on the xterminal\nserver). \n\n	Has anyone had any prior experience with this sort of behavior?\n	Can anyone shoot obvious holes in this theory?\n	How about obvious gimmes?\n	And, of course, any ideas on how to solve it?\n\n	Any ideas are greatly appreciated.
A while back (i.e., several months) someone posted a method for allowing \na user to choose (via XMenu and something else??) a window manager \ninteractively at X startup time. Could the original poster (or anyone \nelse) please Email a copy of the method to me, as I have lost the \noriginal posting? Thanks.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\nHenry Stilmack                               )  \nComputing Systems Manager                    ) Perform random kindnesses \nUK/Netherlands/Canada Joint Astronomy Centre )   and senseless acts of beauty\n660 N.

Yes, it is.  It is available at ftp.ctr.columbia.edu, probably\nin pub/xkernel.  \n\n	In response to the earlier gentlemans question, you could\ntheoretically recompile xkernel on a sun4.  The binaries available are\nfor the sun3/50, but the author says it could be used on most\narchitectures, and he does have a 'do-it-yourself' type distribution.\n\n	We use Xkernel for about 7 machines here.  email me if you\nhave any questions I can help you with...
You have to do the same sorts of things that Xt does with its main loop.\nThat is, you have to rig up a timer queue, and you have to put a \nselect(2) or poll(2) call in your main loop.  You can obtain the \nfile descriptor of the X display connection using \n    fd = ConnectionNumber (display);
I am tunning into this newgroup after a long time. Could somebody tell me \nwhat the slave mode in the xterm is? and what can it be used for? Any info\nwhere I can get more info or examples.

I've just started messing with X Windows under Linux, and I've run into this\n"-<toolkit options>" thing in the man-pages of a number of X clients.\n\nWhere can I get a list of these options?  Is this only an "xview" thing?\n(If so, would some kind soul show me how to set it up under Linux?)

Xm++/CommonInteract    Another User Interface Development System\n-------------------\n\nIf you would like to implement X-Toolkit applications with C++ in a style\nlike this...\n\n// mini sample application /////////////////////////////////////\n\nclass Test : public XmWindow {\n	void cmd(char*);\n	void quit(void*);\npublic:\n    Test() : XmWindow("Xm++ Test Window") {}\n\n	void initialize();\n};\n\nvoid Test::initialize() {\n    XmDropdownMenu* menu = createDropdownMenu();\n\n    menu->addLabel("&File");\n    menu->addItems( Entry("Menu Item &One", CB(Test::cmd)), \n                    Entry("Menu Item &Two", CB(Test::cmd)),\n                    NULLENTRY);\n    menu->addSeparator();\n    menu->addItem(	Entry("E&xit", CB(Test::quit)));\n\n    addSubpane(Edit, "myEdit");\n    edit("myEdit")->setText("Hello World.");\n}\n\nvoid Test::cmd(char* n) {\n	edit("myEdit")->setText(n);\n}\n\nvoid Test::quit(void*) {\n	exit(0);\n}\n\nvoid XmApp::initialize() {\n    (new Test)->initialize();\n}\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\n...then continue reading (contents of the current release's README):\n\nXm++ is a user interface framework for the C++ language built upon X11\nand the X-Toolkit. It is designed to be a simple and intuitive programming\ninterface to access the functionality of commonly used widgets.\nXm++ was initially created for the Motif widget set, now support for the\nAthena widgets was added. Applications created with Xm++ run in both\nenvironments without changes, although many nice features are only\navailable when using Motif.\nIn some situations Xm++ extends the underlying toolkit (i.e. providing\na ComboBox borrowed from MS-Windows), but never tries to replace it -\ndata of user interface objects is left to the widgets and only duplicated\nin rare cases.\n\nXm++ has nothing common with Motif++ besides the general idea to\nencapsulate Motif widgets in C++ objects and the '++' in it's name. Many\nideas for the Xm++ architecture came from Digitalk's Smalltalk version,\nwhich provides an easy to use framework for Windows/PM/Mac applications\n(in the very first time of development I used the Windows dialog editor and\na simple parser to create similar Smalltalk and Xm++ dialogs :-).\n\nTop level objects in Xm++:\n* 'Windows', 'SystemDialogs' and 'ToolBoxes' which use the automatic layout\n  feature of various composite widgets in Motif and Xaw\n* 'UserDialogs' which can be individually laid out with a user interface\n  builder (a first version of such a dialog editor is included in this\n  distribution)\n\nControls (children of top level objects):\n'staticText', 'staticImage', 'pushButton', 'checkBox', 'radioButton',\n'edit', 'listBox', 'comboBox', 'groupBox', 'paneArea', 'drawing', 'toolBar'\n\nThe staticImage and all the button classes can display b/w (X-bitmap\nformat) or color (GIF format) pictures as an alternative to a label text.\n\nEvent handling is done by a simple but powerful mechanism which redirects\nXt callbacks to member functions of Xm++ objects.\n\n\nCommonInteract(II) is built upon the Xm++ drawing class and provides\ncomponents for building direct manipulative applications. Is is a very\nsimplified implementation of some features from the CommonInteract system\n(research project of our institute in 1991), an approach to define a\nsoftware achitecture for implementing direct manipulative applications\nwith multiple interaction media (i.e. sound, alternative input devices).\nIf you are interrested, look into the June 1993 issue of the JOOP (SIGS\nPublications - Journal of Object Oriented Programming) - there should be\nour paper about CommonInteract (but be aware, that it is our 'state of\nthe art' from 1991).\nCommonInteract(II) is still undocumented and is included because it was\nused to implement the dialog editor. It currently supports only drawing\nprimitives (lines, rectangles, circles...), but we plan to extend it to\nsupport bitmaps and some controls also.\nKnown problem: the Xm++ drawing class has no redrawing strategy (always\nredraws the whole window, even after minimal changes like selecting an\nobject), this looks very ugly on slow displays and should be fixed.\n\n\nAbout this first release:\n\nXm++ is still incomplete and has a lot of bugs but we are using it here\nfor smaller applications which are running without problems. So I think\nI can call it a 'beta release' which can be used to develop applications\nfor any non-critical purposes.\nCommonInteract may be called a 'pre alpha release'. It's development will\nbe continued this year because we plan to use it for another research\nproject here. Besides incompleteness and the redrawing problem it seems\nto be stable and can be used for experimental applications.\n\nPlatforms: this release was compiled and tested on:\n  HP9000/720 running HP-UX 8.07\n  SUN SPARC running SunOS Release 4.1.1\n  PC-AT386 running Linux v0.99pl6\n\nCaution: although the whole stuff was initially developed using an AT&T\nstandard C++ compiler - this release is tested only with GNU g++ 2.3.3 or\nabove (the next release will be tested with both compilers).\n\nWhere to get it:\n================\n\nI have uploaded it on: export.lcs.mit.edu as: /contrib/Xm++.0.5.tar.Z\n\n(send a mail, if you cannot find it there, e-mail addr. below)\n\nWhere to find more information:\n===============================\n\nthe .../doc directory contains\n   INSTALL - how to build the libraries and examples\n   README.GNU - problems and limitations when using gnu g++ (read!!)\n   usersGuide.txt - a tutorial how to use Xm++\n   reference.txt - a first try of a Xm++ class reference manual\n\nthe README files in the .../samples gives a brief description of\neach of the seven samples.\n\n\nXm++/CommonInteract is free software for any non-profit purposes,\nsee the file .../lib/COPYRIGHT for details.\n\nSend any comments, bug reports and donations :-) to the Author:\n\n    Bernhard Strassl\n    Vienna User Interface Group\n	Institute for Applied Computer Science and Information Systems\n    University of Vienna\n    Lenaugasse 2/8, A-1080 Wien, Austria

Is there an "official extension" to X which allows the use of audio? Most\nof the X audio programs use system-specific ways to access the audio\ncapabilities of the computer they run on. Is there a hardware-independent\nway to do this (like the video extension XV)? Thanks for any help.
How can I capture ButtonPress/ButtonRelease events in multiple clients?\nI want to know if the user is still at the display before locking the screen.\nI can get  KeyPress/KeyRelease and Pointer motion events, but if the user\nis pressing the mouse button in the same location (the mouse doesn't move)\nI can't capture the events.  \n\nThe O'Reilly Xlib Programming Manual (vol. 1) says on page 252;\n   "Only one client can select button events on any one window at one time, \n    due to the grab that automatically takes place."  \n\nAny help would be appreciated.

I need some help in tracking down a dvi viewer for X. I have xdvi but we\nhave not got the X libraries and includes installed- so \n		i) is there a way around this, as we are trying to avoid\n		   installing the stuff (space is at a premium).\n		ii)would someone be prepared to make the binaries\n		   available. We have a HP700 and a HP382.
Did anyone install xdbx v2.1.2 on SGI workstation ?\n\n\nThanks for your answer.		Gildas PERROT.
Hi all,\n\nI wrote a small application which uses pixmaps copied into a window\nto show some drawings. This works perfectly for all kind of objects\nexpect large fonts. What happens on the screen is that the right\nhalf of the font is not shown. The way I create these things is\nquite simple; some aggregated code:\n\nXFillRectangle(Disp, Pixs, AnyColor, 0, 0, Width, Height);\nXDraw[Line|Rect|String](...);\nXCopyArea(Disp, Pixs, Win, 0, 0, Width, Height, 0, 0);\n\nI am using a RS6K 340 with BOS 3.2.\n\nThe question is:\n  is this a bug in the AIX X-server (may be some PTFs), or did I do\n  something wrong within my code??\n\nSorry for the cross-posting, but I really do not know what kind of\nerror it is.\n\n\nJuergen Schietke\nResearch Insitute for Discrete Mathematics\nUniversity of Bonn\nNassestr. 2\n5300 Bonn 1 (Germany)
Hello, I am writing a program which forks of a number of child processes\nand each of the children printing things on the screen (quite messy in\none window)... \n\nThe "xterm  -Sxxd"  option seems to be the solution to opening up\nslave windows only to display output and I use the following code to\nopen up a pty (taken from Stevens)...and manage to open up an x-term\nsuccessfully.... \n\nThe problem however is how do I write into this x-term ? Please help!\n\n\nstatic char pty_name[12];\nint pty_master( void );\n\nint pty_master( void )\n{\n  int i,fd;\n  char* ptr;\n  struct stat statbuff;\n  static char ptychar[] = "pqrs";\n  static char hexdigit[] = "0123456789abcdef";\n  \n  for( ptr = ptychar; *ptr!=0; ptr++ ) {\n    strcpy( pty_name, "/dev/ttyXY" );\n    pty_name[8] = *ptr;\n    pty_name[9] = '0';\n    \n    if( stat( pty_name, &statbuff) < 0 )\n      break;\n\n    for( i=0; i < 16; i++ ) {\n      pty_name[9] = hexdigit[i];\n      if( (fd = open( pty_name, O_RDWR )) >= 0 )\n	return( fd );\n    }\n  }\n  return(-1);\n}

Hi,\nI have a lots of problems using XView (libraries Release 3.2) in order to\ndo the following:\n+ I want to create a MODAL Dialog which block the program flow\n  (a syncronous dialog, ala Macintosh) , as the Notice Panel\n  does, but with Text Item, List Item, and other XView objects.\n+ The MODAL Dialog also must allows the Timer to be called (why\n  Notice doesn't do that?).\n \nThe problems are:\n- Using the "xv_window_loop" functions most XView objects dont work\n  (as the List Item), and the timers aren't called.\n \n- With the "notify_dispatch" explicit I have problem because:\n  "...never attempt to do direct dispaching from within a callback\n  routine..." as say the "XView Programming Manual (Third Edition)"\n  on page 486 (uhm... I know this number!!! :->).\n  But I need to do dispatching just inside a callback routine!\n \nHelp me, please!!!\n \nThanks in advance,\n--- Giovanni\n \nP.S. Please, send replay directly to my address belove (I haven't\ndirect access to Internet).
** I am posting this for a friend **\n** please respond to vaughn%sonatech@hub.ucsb.edu **\n\nI'm working on an application where we are creating a dither pattern \nand rendering it in a window by applying it to the stipple pattern \nof the GC.  The following code segment almost works if the window width \nis an even multiple of 8.  If it is not an even multiple it skews the \npattern towards the right.  Another problem, whether it is an even \nmultiple of 8 or not, is a series of vertical lines spaced 8 pixels \napart.\n\n\nextern	Display	       *dpy;\nextern	Window		xid;\nextern	GC		gc;\n\nextern	int	Max_X, Max_Y;		/* set in resize handler	*/\n\ndither(pixels)\n\n	char	*pixels;		/* dither pattern data		*/\n\n	{\n	char	*bm;			/* bitmap data			*/\n	char    *bmp;\n	long	 I, arraymax;\n\n\n	arraymax = Max_X*Max_Y;\n\n	bm  = (char *)malloc(arraymax);\n	bmp = bm;\n\n	for (I=j=0; I<arraymax; I++)\n		{\n		if (pixels[I] & DITHER_BIT)\n			*bmp |=   2<<j;		/* pixel on		*/\n		else\n			*bmp &= ~(2<<j);	/* pixel off		*/\n\n		if (++j > 7)\n			{\n			bmp++;\n			j = 0;\n			}\n		}\n\n	stipple = XCreateBitmapFromData(dpy, xid, bm, Max_X, Max_Y);\n	free(bm);\n\n	XClearWindow(dpy, xid);\n\n	XSetStipple(dpy, gc, stipple);\n	XSetFillStyle(dpy, gc, FillStippled);\n	XFillRectangle(dpy, xid, gc, 0, 0, Max_X, Max_Y);\n	XSetFillStyle(dpy, gc, FillSolid);\n	}\n\nI suspect the answer is to pad the data.
Hi All,\n\nI've heard of a commercial package named ZINK, that could convert MS-Windows\nsource-code to XWindows source-code (C). The only problem is, the package\nisn't available in Holland (at least, I can't find it anywhere :-( )\n\nIs there another package (preferrably free- or shareware), that can do the \nsame thing? And if so, where can I find or buy it?\n\nThanks in advance
You  should  try  having  a  .xsession  script in $HOME to do these\nthings.  xdm will  start  up  your  process  using  the  system  version\n(usually /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xsession), which should check whether you have\nyour won and change to that if you do.  (Take a copy of the  system  one\nand edit it). \n\n     Note, that this file requires "x" access to be set.
For all those people flaming John Bradley, the author of xv - he's on\nvacation till May 10 (or 15, I don't remember). Maybe we all should slow\ndown and wait to hear his side wrt copyrights, fees, etc.
See xwd, xpr.  Even better, grab xdump from ftp.cs.uwm.edu.  It makes use \nof these programs as well, but has a much nicer interface (and can do more).\nYou can dump to PostScript, bitmaps, etc.
Where can I obtain a copy of the Open Look widgets?  Is it obtainable on\nthe net somewhere, or do I need to order a copy (if so, how)?\n\nThanks for any help.  Please email.
Hello,\n\nI have a problem with X11R5 on a Sun386i an I hope that someone can help\nme with it.\nI've built X from the MIT sources after applying all patches I have got (I\nthink 23). Building was easy. After installing everything I started X but\nnothing happened but the screen and the keyboard freezed, the machine seemed\nto hang. I loged in from another machine an found the Sun386i running well.\n'ps' told me that there's a X-server and a xterm running. And with some \nexperimenting with the mouse and repeatedly pressing ^D I blindly hit the\nxterm, endet the session and got my prompt back.\nI guess it's a device problem but I did not find the correct device yet.\nI've got a Sun386i with a b/w framebuffer (ACE-6 0688 94V-0, Rev 53)\nSunOS 4.0.2 and ROM 4.4.\nPlease help me. I'm able to run clients on the Sun and send the output to\nother machines but that's not what I did it for.
