I just bought a little gizmo that is supposed to be installed "in\nseries with the tip or ring lines" of the phone wire. Which ones are\nthose? Suppose I am holding a regular phone wire, such that the little\nplastic tooth (on the little plastic square thing with the naked lead\nends that you plug into the phone) is facing down, and away from me.\nWhich of the 4 wires that I see is the "tip" and which is the "ring"?\nPlease reply to mlevin@husc8.harvard.edu.
Radio Shack stores sell them here in the States. Not sure if\nInterTan is carrying these for Australia or not...\n\nCost is $6 USD. You charge them under a fluorescent, then\nthey glow when exposed to IR.
This is just a test to see if this works.
Being in the "visualization" stage of a circuit design right now,\nI was wondering what the best way to "scale" an AC voltage using an 8-bit\ndigital word is. I am thinking of using the common method of sending the\nword through an ADC and then comparing it with the AC voltage (converted\nto a sawtooth wave) to get a duty cycle. However, I am leary of this\nmethod because it a) requires a lot of parts, and, more importantly, b)\ncreates a lot of interference from the switching on the entire AC line. I\nrealize that correct filtering could cancel out most of this interference,\nbut that would require more parts and boost the price further.\n	Someone mentioned to me that they had seen an IC which input 8\nbits of data and DIRECTLY scaled the AC voltage coming in all on-chip.\nUnfortunately, he couldn't remember the chip number or the manufacturer;\nif anyone else has heard of this chip, please e-mail me.\n	I am building this project as a "dimmer box" for a light\ncontroller circuit and it is important that the cost of each box remains\nvery low because one dimmer is required for each light that the user\nwishes to control (well, each channel, at least). Therefor, if each box\ncosts $150, I doubt that an end user will want to dish out ($150 x 16 =\n$2400) for sixteen channels... This is something I have noticed about\ntoday's dimmer boxes; they are so expensive!\n	Anyway, any help which someone could offer on either a method of\neasily doing this or info about the chip which will do it for me (always\nthe preferred method... :) will be greatly appreciated!
Sorry Ian, I haven't toyed with it in several years. I haven't seen\nthe insides in quite a few years. I just saw the post lagging for\nquite a few days, and thought I'd toss in my $0.02. I assume the 6507\nwas functionally similar to the 6502 (was it also made by MOS\nTechnologies?). I really am more versed in the (6502 based) Atari\ncomputers. The 2600 came later on.\n\n\nIn the Atari computers, the "CIA" chip you refer to sounds an awful\nlot like the CTIA (Color Television Interface Adapter) chip used in\nthe early models. Later Atari upgraded this to the GTIA (Graphics\n...). Other colorful literature stated that the GTIA might have stood\nfor "George," the developer of the chip.\n\n\nFunny, I had an old and new model. The old one was SIGNIFICANTLY heavier.\n\n\nSorry, I am way out of line here. My first microcontroller I built was\na MC68701 based chipset with 128 bytes onboard. That was not easy to\nwork with (in addtion to a small 2K on-board EPROM).
I know for sure that the Everex Magic I/O EV-170A can be jumpered\nfor a printer mode, or for a general purpose bidirectional I/O mode.\n\nAlso, I know for sure that the IBM Technical Reference says the following\nabout the Monochrome Display & Printer Adapter and the IBM Parallel Printer\nAdapter:\n\n    It is essential that the external device not try to pull these\n    lines [referring to the data lines] to ground.\n\nAnd later:\n\n    If an external device should be driving data on these pins (in\n    violation of usage ground rules) at the time of an input, this\n    data will be `or'ed with the latch contents.\n\nI will accept no responsibility if you incur damages of any kind\nas a result of my saying, ``I DO NOT know for sure, but I think\nyou should be able to use a traditional parallel port as an input\nport by writing 0x to the data lines, and then reading from the\ndata lines, while an external device drives them.''  The input\ndata will not be latched, so noise could make this infeasible.
I would like to hook up some cameras that were recently donated to our\nlocal community cable TV station which have sync inputs in the form\nof horizontal and vertical drive. Our station sync is a black burst\nwhich works fine with other boxes with "genlock" style inputs. Can\nanyone point me at a design, article, or whatever showing how to produce\nthe horizontal & vertical drive signals? Thanks in advance.\nJack Powers
When constructing active filters,  odd values of resistor are often required \n(i.e. something like a 3.14 K Ohm resistor).(It seems best to choose common \ncapacitor values and cope with the strange resistances then demanded).\n\nIs there a PD program out there that will work out how best to make up such\na resistance, given fixed resistors of the standard 12 values per decade?.(1,\n1.2,1.5,1.8,2.2,3.3 etc ).  It is a common enough problem,  yet I cant \nrecall seing a program that tells that Rx+Ry//Rz gives Rq,  starting with \nq and finding prefered values x,y and z.
I need to make a power supply that can take input from a \ncigarette lighter in a car (12v dc) and drive 7.5 volts\nat up to 3.0 amps. I know enough to know that a simple\nvoltage divider with two resistors won't do it right. Can\nsuch a thing be made from Radio-Shack-able parts without\ntoo much difficulty?\n\njps\nbf\n\np.s. I've looked for premade things like this at radio shack but\nnone of it seems to go any higher than about 800mA.
I'm glad to see this idea come up because I've had something similar in mind.\nWhat if you had an authorization key that computed from the name and address \ndata.  When the user registers, you don't even need to send executable code, \njust compute his/her key and send him/her instructions to enter in the \nappropriate place the following:\n\nName=Joe Doe\nAddress=123 Main Street\nCity=Anytown, CA\nkey=ldslfoialsdkcdsngsikhsfd
I would not be suprised if the equipment is compatible, in fact New York\nTelephone (NYNEX) spend a lot of money on Swedish switching equipment\nrecently.\n\n\n You can guess what brand of equipment I refer to :-)\n\nMichael
There is a cartridge capping upgrade for older deskjet printers\navailable from hewlett-packard.  Older original deskjet and\npossibly deskjet 500 units may have a black plastic slide with\nrubber capping components in the cartrige parking area on the right\nside (viewed from front) of the printer.  Newer printers have a\ngray or white plastic slide.  The black plastic slide can allow\nyour cartridge to dry out.  There was and may still be information\npackaged with ink cartridges explaining the situation.  HP placed a\ncoupon for a free upgrade kit to modernize old deskjets to the new\ncapping mechanism.  I did this on my printer and did indeed find\nthat the cartidges now last longer.\n\nI don't have the information handy.  I suggest contacting your\nnearest HP service center for information on obtaining the kit.\n\nHP has upgrade kits that consist of electronics and mechanical\ncomponents that vary depending on the starting level printer and\nthe level to which you wish to upgrade.  I upgraded my original\ndesket to a dekjet 500.  The kit was fairly expensive.  You are\nlikely better off selling your old printer and purchasing a new\ndeskjet 500 now that prices have declined so much.  Upgrading an\noriginal deskjet to 500 requires a fair amount of skill, but no\nsoldering.  Upgrading a deskjet plus to a 500 is involves swapping\nthe processor card and changing a few minor parts.  Contact your HP\nservice center for further information.\n\nThe PCL language used by Deskjets is considerably different from\nthe PCL used by laser printers, especially the newer laser\nprinters.  The biggest problem is dumb laser drivers that send a\nraster end command after each scan line.  This makes no material\ndifference for lasers, but causes the deskjet to print the\naccumulated raster.  As you might guess, the result is hideously\nslow printing.  The new DOS Wordperfect print deskjet drivers are\nstill guilty of this particular behavior.  From the way Wordperfect\nworks, this would not be easy to change.  Windows Wordperfect works\nefficiently unless you use the DOS drivers instead of Windows'.\n\nThe PCL4 dialect used in the Laserjet IIIP allows compression that\npermits a full page 300 dpi image to be rendered with only one\nmegabyte of memory.  An uncompressed image could be as large as\nabout 909 Kbytes, but the printer needs about 300K of memory for\nits internal house-keeping.  Laserjet IV models support banded\nprinting that allows incrmental download of the image with\ncompression in limited memory situations.  Deskjet downloadable\nfonts are not compatible with laserjet fonts.\n\nA single page from a laserjet only requires about 20 seconds.  This\nis faster than any but the most trivial printing from a deskjet\nprinter.  The presumption, of course, being that the laser printer\nhas completed its warm-up cyle.\n\nUntil ink chemistry is changed, wicking resulting in image\ndeterioration is unavoidable.  I won't use the word impossible, but\nmatching laser quality output from a deskjet printer is unlikely.\nChosing an appropriate paper type helps, but does not eliminate the\nproblem.\n\nLaser printers are more wastful of energy and consumable\ncomponents.  HP does accept return of spent toner cartridges,\nmitigating the material waste problem to a degree.  Energy waste\ncould use more work.  Warm-up times have decreased, allowing\nstand-by current consumption to be significantly reduced in the\nlaserjet IV.\n\nKyocera produces a laser print engine that employs an amorphous\nsilicon imaging drum with a replacable toner system.  The image\ndrum is good for approximately 100K copies.  It is a very nice\nprint engine.  I wish HP used the Kyocera engine.  Kyocera also has\na neat modular paper source and stacker system.\n\nThe recommended duty cycle for a deskjet is significantly lower\nthan any of HP's laser printers.  The pick-up pressure rollers are\nsubject to wear and I case confirm eventually do wear out.  The\nusual symptom is that the printer becomes reluctant to feed paper.\nThe paper feed is integrated in a transport mechanism that is a\nsingle part from HP service.  Replacement cost for the transport is\nalmost $200.  The feed rollers are not separately replacable,\nthough it would not be a difficult job for a competent technician.\nI have disassembled and reassembled the transport on my own printer.\n\nIt depends upon the application which printer is best for you.  If\nyou only print 5 or 10 pages a day and are satisfied with the\nappearance of output, the deskjet is a very good choice.  As noted,\nthe deskjet 500 is my choice for personal use.
I don't know much about Hydrophones, so I'm looking for any information\nthat will help avoid problems I haven't thought of! I would like an \ninexpensive hydrophone and amplifier with tape (line level) outputs...\nsomething like Edmund sells for $250.

I have a question about accessing certain addresses on a chip,\nparticulary a 27C512 EPROM.  Although I don't know that much about it, as I\nunderstand it, there's a pin on the chip that, when voltage is applied, kicks\nup the address.  The question is how do you determine how many bytes the\naddress is incremented by??  For example, if I have code I want to be\naccessed at $2000 and also at say $4000 how do I move the address pointer to\nthose positions??  Thanks for any info...
I don't see any way that the concrete floor could do anything to the\nbattery.\n\nHowever, you would have been better off leaving them outside. Keeping\nthem cold would have been better for them than bringing them inside.\nA warm battery will self-discharge faster than a cold one.\n\nWhen you are storing a battery it's a good idea to charge it once a month.\nLetting a battery go completely dead is bad for it (I suspect this is\nwhat caused your problems).\n\n--

I am looking for a text/reference that will include pinouts, \ndescription, and functionality for just about any IC made.\nDoes such a text exist?  Are there docs on the Internet that\nreference IC's?  It would be a great idea if each major\nIC manufacturer made available to the public an anonymous\nFTP site with all it's data books in the form of text files.\n(ala RFC style).  This would save time and money for the\nIC manufacturer since a text file costs nothing to send\naround the world via internet and since most users of\nIC's\nare found in the internet anyway.  \n\nAre there any books available for purchase that reference\n(as many as possible)?  Or am I going to be stuck obtaining\na zillion databooks from the manufacturers (those little\nphonebook-type books that are obsoleted every couple years)
Wonder if anyone would know where (or if) I could find the schematic for the \nold Timex-sinclare (sp) computer... Or even a pin out on the expansion bus??
Comments about "who needs backup copies"?  and "YOU do" deleted....\n\nI'll toss in my 2 cents worth - I've begun to think that distribution\ndisks are made on some of the least reliable floppy disk stocks available.\nWe've been especially plagued by Borland's distribution disks.  I'm \nlucky if I can install from them as many as 3 times before they crap \nout on me.  So definitely, as a matter of course we ALWAYS make copies\nto do our installations with.
At least locally, many shops carry a product called Goo Gone.  It works well\non scummy-gummy-sticky-goop-that-won't-go-away...  As always, color test in\nan inconspicuous corner before use.
Ah-ha!  I'm not alone at last!  Which Sony do you have??  I have a\n27"SXR (pre-XBR series, circa 1987).  That damn thing used to\nmake noise like a mad-man.  I had/have 2 separate problems...one being the\nflyback, the other was the assembly where the windings of the yoke\ncame together. \n\nFirst:  I found by poking around the windings on that assembly,\nthe thing would make noise.  I guess that there was enough of a potential\nin that assembly to leak, so I sprayed it with a dielectric insulation\nspray--I think it was urethane or acyrilic.  That fixed it.\n\nSecond:  Flyback...for the life of me, I can't isolate this one.  If I\nleave the cover off, the TV will be quiet.  If I put the cover back on,\nand let it heat up, it'll start to whine--kinda hard to solve with the\ncover on!! :-(\n\nA friend of mine who used to fix TV's says there might be a pin-hole\nleak somewhere on the flyback.  Usually it's surrounded by a bunch of\nblack dust/dirt.\n\nI hope this is a start...if you find something out, let me know!
Funny . . . I and most of the detector-owning friends I have, are  \ngenerally able to *REMEMBER* such things as nearby microwave towers and  \nradar detectors going off in EXACTLY the same spon EVERY DAY . . ..\n\nI know on I-64 at the Grayson, KY exit, there's a store just off the side  \nof the road (think it's a Liquor store . . .) with what must be a security  \nsystem that would make most federal prisons proud.  It's the only thing  \nI've ever driven by (besides a cop) that puts my Whistler in "Oh my God  \nhe's Right Behind You!!!!" mode . . ..

I just got a copy of spice 5.2. I would like to know if there are\nany published books on the market yet and where I could get one. I would\nappreciate any help. Thank You
Tis' only a gleam in my eye at this point.  I have yet to chose a tracking \nmethod.  The initial requirement was to design a system to locate a dancer\nin one of eight zones across the stage.  I did some experiments with \npyroelectric detectors and found them difficult to align to get a definite\nzone transition.  And dancers stand still alot, so their IR signature goes\naway.  The good thing about pryoelectrics is that their signal is proportional \nto the size of the warm body (or body part), and the velocity of said body.\nThis could be useful for detecting the intensity of a dance gesture.\n\nDancers also really hate to wear little boxes and batteries strapped on their \nbodies, but they really need to be emitting some kind of signal to be tracked.
I have seen the existance of electronics solder with a 2% silver\ncontent that seems to have good wetting and fatique reatings.\n  Can anyone tell me why it is not used? (silver is not such an expensive\nmetal).\n\n\nAndy
Pretty high frequency for one chip...\n\n\nYes and no. I would use the FM transmitter chip from Motorola (Linear and  \nInterface Databook), a stable cristal oscillator and a mixer (e.g. SBL-1 from  \nmini circuits lab). Everything is done in the FM chip and then mixed up with  \nthe oscillator frequency. Just have a look at the ARRL Handbook. There are lots  \nof ideas in there about oscillators and mixing. I don't think, there are single  \nchip designs for such high frequencies yet.\n\n\nCheers   Robert HB9NBY

Well, yes and no.  The _image_ can't be on the screen less than 1/30\nof a second, but a _mixture_ of images that's about 90% of the field\nthat was supposed to be there and 10% of the 'subliminal' addition\ncould be overlaid for one field, producing the same overall effect to\nour sluggish retinae of a discrete image projected for 1/300 second.\n\n..although, like the previous poster, I have to reserve my doubts\nabout the effectiveness of said discrete image in steering my\nsubconscious around ..

Sorry Geoff,\n\nAgree solder mask is green, but in the old days we didn't have wave soldering\nmachines (which are another topic again).  I had a crew of a dozen ladies which\ncould stuff and hand solder a board like lightning!\n\nBoard under the mask was the original query.\n\nBTW cheap inport electronic devices (mainly from 3rd world countries) are done\nwith brown pheonolic boards.  Is seems the electronics industry has discovered\nthe cheap labor pools.  Workers are paid by the board to assemble circuits at\nhome.  They are very obviously hand soldered.  Quite a few tape recorders are\nbeing brought into Canada from Red China.  In China there is no warranty for\nthe equipment other than if you plug it in and it works it's yours.  One of my\nco-workers spent a year there and he said the failure rate out of the box was\nalmost 50%.\n\nAlso, the original method for making printed with conductive ink on a regular\nprinting press.

I didn't say the program is DISABLED, did I?  (I HATE!!!! it when people\ntake my words out of context...)

Are you saying that you have some extras that you would like to do some cost\nrecovery on?  I may be interested.

For some time I've been thinking about the possiblity of starting a group\nwhere scientific articles can be published (or perhaps just summaries).\nPossible advantages would be:\n* Free disribution\n* Fast acceptance\n* Online discussion between authers and readers\n\nThis would be possible with one group with a moderator for publishing the\narticles and one perhaps without for discussion.\n\nThe best thing would be if all the articles would be in a standard format which\nwould make it possible to print or view the documents camera ready.

I hope David isn't going to be too upset with me for sticking my nose\nin here again, but here goes......:-)\n\nIt isn't the average temperature that is the key factor here, but rather\nwhich is better at transferring the heat out of the (presumably warmer\nthan ground temperature) battery.  Call it a question of thermal\nconductivity, or of insulating ability, or "thermal mass" - whatever you\nlike.  Question - why does a concrete floor feel cooler than the \nsurrounding dirt when you place your hand on it?
It has been a while since I knew the electronics of ham radio, but I seem\nto remember that PeP is actually 4x the "real" power.  Which makes 1KW PeP\nactually around 250W.  Or was it 2x?  I disremember.\n\n"Effective transmitted power" is also "odd", in that it takes into account\nantenna height and geometry.  Which is why a TV station with a 50KW Klystron\nmight advertise a megawatt (if their antenna is on the top of the\nCN tower ;-).\n\nThis is like Sears HP ;-)\n\nThough, 1500 real watts still isn't impossible.  About 125-150A with\na 12V alternator, less if the alternator produces higher voltages.\n\nIt's only three horsepower (taking into account inefficiencies).  You'll\nfeel it when you hit the key.  But not too much.

They do interpolate - it's not linear interpolation though. You are correct\nthat the frequency content is not altered (more specifically, the baseband\nspectrum is preserved, and so is every Nth image spectrum. The other\n(N-1) in N image spectra are removed, where N is the oversampling rate)\n\n\nIdeally the filter has a gain of 1 from 0Hz to 22050Hz, and a gain of 0\nfrom 22050 to the new Nyquist frequency. In practice a finite transition\nband is required, and there is also a certain amount of pass-band ripple\nand stop-band leakage. With a high order (eg 200 taps) digital filter,\na very good approximation can be easily achieved.\n\n <<< BIT DELETED ABOUT OBSERVATIONS OF INTERPOLATION FILTER AT WORK >>>\n\n\nNo, they actually use a digital FIR just like yours, but built in hardware,\non custom VLSI chips for (mainly) economic reasons.\n\n\n\nI guess that the answer is somewhere between the two.\n\nAs an interesting (?) aside, some of you out there may be aware of a scheme\nused by Pioneer and Wadia, which is called (by Pioneer, at least) Legato\nLink. I haven't heard one of these players, but by reading advertising\nblurb, and a couple of pseudo-technical articles I deduced that all they\ndo is build a lousy digital oversampling filter, and let a load of the\nfirst image (ie aliassed) spectrum through. Talking to Bob Stuart (of\nBoothroyd Stuart, aka Meridian) confirmed my suspicion. He said that it\nsounded awful, but then he would, wouldn't he...\n\nChristopher
The May 1993 cover of QST has a picture of three different boards without\nany solder mask (you can tell from the copper colored traces). The box\nlabeled 2304 transverter has the brown teflon/glass board, while the one\nin the center has the grayish board exposed.  On the left is some \nfiberglass board that looks green to me.  I see no reason\nfor putting solder mask on circuit board used for box covers :-).\n\nI wonder if any manufacturer actually puts a solder mask on their\nlow noise microwave preamps?  Often, microwave circuits have odd\nbits of wire/foil/metal attached to wherever/whatever is necessary\nto make the unit work properly (this is a commercial product?).  A\nsolder mask would certainly make doing this tougher, never mind \nthe finding something that minimally degrades the circuits.  (Q dope\nfor coils *does* not improve the Q--it just holds things together with\nminimal loss).\n\nZack Lau  KH6CP/1\n\nInternet: zlau@arrl.org           "Working" on 24 GHz SSB/CW gear     \n			          Operating Interests: 10 GHz CW/SSB/FM\nUS Mail: c/o ARRL Lab				       80/40/20 CW\n	225 Main Street		  Station capability: QRP, 1.8 MHz to 10 GHz\n	Newington CT  06111	               modes: CW/SSB/FM/packet\n						      amtor/baudot\nPhone (if you really have to): 203-666-1541\n\nZack Lau  KH6CP/1\n\nInternet: zlau@arrl.org           "Working" on 24 GHz SSB/CW gear     \n			          Operating Interests: 10 GHz CW/SSB/FM\nUS Mail: c/o ARRL Lab				       80/40/20 CW\n	225 Main Street		  Station capability: QRP, 1.8 MHz to 10 GHz\n	Newington CT  06111	               modes: CW/SSB/FM/packet\n						      amtor/baudot\nPhone (if you really have to): 203-666-1541
Mike, Ring is the RED wire. Tip is the GREEN wire of most standard\nphone lines. They two constitute the two wires most often used for\nvoice telephone (the two live lines). They are the two innermost\nconnectors of an RJ-11 phone jack.\n\nAnother way of telling is that if you measure voltage from RED to\nGREEN (ring to tip. tip/green being at ground potential of the\nvoltmeter), it should read -48 volts in the on-hook no-ring position).\nI am 98% sure it's -48 V and not +48 volts. Doesn't hurt a phone too\nmuch if they're reversed, it's just bad if one happens to somehow get\ngrounded to earth ground elsewhere).\n\nAdditionally, when off-hook, the voltage drops to about -4 to -9 Volts\nDC. I think it is supposed to correspond to a 36 to 40 mA current\nloop. And lastly, when ringing, the two wires develop an AC potential\nof about 80 V p-p at 20 to 30 Hz across them (where you get the\nelectromechanical old fashioned bell ringer from).
Hello there.  The other day I was feeling a tad nostalgic and thought\nabout constructing an old-time crytal radio set.  I figured on\nsubstituting a modern germanium diode for the crystal, and winding the\nantenna coil, etc., myself.\n\nThe only problem I seem to have is in locating a source for a tuning\ncapacitor -- you know, the old meshed-plate variable condensers which\nused to be the mainstay for tuning circuits.  Well these things seem to\nbe all but extinct in their original catalog habitats.  Trimmer\ncapacitors are relatively abundant, but are not really suitable for this\napplication.\n\nSo, can anyone point me to a supplier of tuning capacitors in the \n0--360 pF range?\n\nManythanks.\n\n--

I think a few things are being missed overall here... First of all, anyone\nwith a DOS manual can copy a disk, or copy anything (hidden files dont\ngo far if you are dealing with anyone who is not comletely DOS ignorant) off\nof a hard disk. 'Professional' crackers aren;t interested in copying disks.\nThey are programmers who get some thrill out of going through unassembly\nlistings of programs to disable copy protection such as serial number\ndialog boxes, volume label checks, and who knows what when it comes to\ncomputer games. \n    \nThose people are in the minority, however. In my experience with the world of\npeople and software, it seems that a good majority of people (say 80%) will\nat some point copy a friend's program ("Gee, you really oughta try this") or\naccept a copy. These are people who normally would buy a software package\nor do without, but decided that just once it wouldn't matter.\n\nThe last thing is people who own or are responsible for more than one \ncomputer; most people aren't going to spend $150 * X# of computers for the\nsame software package.. they will just install it x# of times, especially\nthings like DOS upgrades.

the\nunuseable)\nmotorcycle\n\n\nWhat happens is that (I heard this discussed on "Northern Exposure") there  \nis a molecular juxtaposition of the molecules in the battery and the  \nmolecules in the concrete.  This acts as an attractant to UFOs (actually  \ntheir crew members) and they arrive at the scene of the battery/concrete  \ncombination.\n\nThen they proceed to SUCK ALL THE ENERGY OUT OF THE BATTERIES!\n\nRemedy:  Set the battery on a nonconcrete floor.
This is a 1950s idea.  Supposedly, splicing in a frame of "Buy\npopcorn" upped popcorn sales in a movie theatre.  Big flap at the time.\nCongress involved.  Talk of making it illegal.  General agreement by\nnetworks not to do it.\n\n      A few years ago, some junior person at an advertising agency\nre-invented subliminal projection and one commercial went out on tape\nwith single-frame messages.  It aired on a few stations, but a tech\nat one station, previewing the tape, noticed a flicker and looked at\nthe tape frame-by-frame to find the "defect".  Big flap.  FCC notified.\nCommercial pulled.  Press reports. Embarassed ad agency.  You could\nprobably find the press reports via Dialog or Nexis if you wanted.\n\n      Now that everybody has VCRs, it's not likely that anybody could\nget away with this on TV.
Check the station's master sync generator.  You'll probably find that\nit already has horizontal and vertical drive outputs that just aren't\nbeing used.  A couple of cables and you're in business.\n\nAnother possibility is to find a genlockable sync generator with HD and VD\noutputs - genlock it to station sync, and then feed HD and VD to the\ncameras.\n\nIf neither of these is possible, then you'll have to build a sync\nseparator.  Look at the circuit diagrams of your existing sync generators -\nthey probably all include circuitry that does what you want.
I have a mystery part labeled NEC AC100.  It's from the low voltage\nsupply of an NEC Multisync I monitor.  It's a three lead part in a\nsquare package like a volate regulator or power transistor.  The board\nis labeled CR691 where the part goes.  (Possibly an SCR?)  The pin\nlabeled G on the board goes to a zener diode (reference voltage?); the\npin labeled T1 goes to the negative lead of a capacitor in the power\nsupply, and the pin labeled T2 goes to the negative side of the bridge\nrectifier in the supply.\n\n    If anyone can tell me what this is, or better yet, where I can buy\none just like it, please email me at ck3i@andrew.cmu.edu.  I've called\nNEC's "monitor repair number" and not only do they not know what the\npart is, but they don't think that they can find one to sell to me... \nIt makes no sense to me...
in article  <735604750.28979.0@unix5.andrew.cmu.edu>,  Mark Yeck\n\n--------->\n\nHey, can someone clue me in on these and other weird types of amplifiers?  Just\na brief intro to the concepts behind these would be cool.  I have the clues \non type A, B, and AB already and stuff, but these other ones are mentioned \noccasionally and I dont know what they do.  I think type D is like a PWM scheme\nor something.  Thanx in advanced.\n\n---------->\nThe whole point to these weird amplifier types is improved efficiency.\n\nClass D amps *are* PWM (pulse width modulation) amps which work very much like\nswitching power supplies. I think I've seen these things called "class S"\nbefore as well. They're capable of very high efficiencies, and would be suitable\nfor very high power. I've yet to see anything like this used in an audiophile\namp, though.  I've been trying to design a three-kilowatter for the last year\n(to be used as an inverter for an UPS), but have been having serious problems\nwith layout parasitics (10 IRF 450's in parallel... any help  with a  do-able\nisolated drive ckt would be appreciated :) ) \n\nI'm not absolutely positive about this, but I beleive a 'class G' amp is one that\noperates off a variable- or switched power supply rail voltage. The Carver\namps do something like this. They use some sort of phase-control circuit \n(I do not fully understand its operation) to reduce the transformer size, and\nI beleive that is patented. I had an M400 apart (trying to fix) and found that\nit had three rail voltages that it switched between. I ran a simulation on\nPSPICE and found that the topology would greatly reduce power dissipation (heat)\nunder large-signal conditions, or when driving reactive loads (which draw high\ncurrent at the zero-voltage crossings).

Wrong, wrong, completely wrong (and a little misleading, too).\n\nWhite noise is random noise whose energy density is constant for a\nconstant bandwidth. That is, a 5 Hz wide band at 20 Hz will have precisely\nthe same amount of energy as a 5 Hz band at 20 kHz.\n\nPink noise is random noise whose energy density is constant for a constant\nprecentage bandwidth. Thus, a 5% wide band of noise at 20 Hz (whose\nbandwidth is 1 Hz) will contain the same energy as a 5% wide band at 20\nkHz (whose bandwidth is 1000 Hz wide). \n\nWhite noise is often used with spectrum analyzers that have constant\nbandwidths, pink noise is used with audio-type real-time analyzers whose\nbandwidths are centert-frequency dependent (often described as "1/3\noctave" or "1/2 octave" or some such terminology).\n\nWhite noise, relative to pink noise, has more energy at high frequencies\n(at a rate equal to 3 dB per octave). Pink noise, relative to white noise,\nhas more energy at low frequencies (at a rate equl to, again, 3\ndb/octave).
One way to make cheap trimmable resistors is to use a high-wattage carbon\ncomposition resistor, and saw a notch in it with a triangular file.\nOf course, you can only increase the resistance, not decrease it.
There are several types of copy protection, and the point is to make sure the\nuser is using a legitimate copy.  The simplest and virtually fool-proof way is\nfor the program to somehow fixate itself to the machine it was installed on\n(some sort of checksum, serial number, whatever) so a copy put on a different\nmachine (NOT installed from original disks) will not work.  \n\nThe program is definitely backupable, if restored to the same machine (depends\non the programmer...  don't use a disk drive characteristic!)  If the user \ndid an upgrade to the machine, he/she should reinstall all programs any way.\nNo document look-up, no disk wear-and-tear!\n\nI did not say that the originals would allow only one install.  The user's \nconscience should do that.\n\nI know, I'll get flamed for this...  But with the increasing number of "casual"\nusers who either unknowingly or don't care about the software copyrights\n(It's the truth.  I have "friends" who ask me for copies of my latest games\nall the time, and when I refused, they went after somebody else.), casual\npirating is becoming more of a problem.  Some sort of copy protection will\ndiscourage the casual copying.  I've seen what some of my "friends" dug up\nsomewhere...  Latest and the greatest games, all cracked, WITHIN days of actual\nrelease!  You know how many bytes you need to change in X-wing to disable\nthe quiz?  TWO!  Yes, TWO!  (And don't ask me which ones they are.)  Determined\npirates are unstoppable, given enough time, but their results do not spread \nthat far, since pirate boards are not that well-known, and easily tracked once\nfound by authorities.  It is the "casual" pirates that the copy protection is\ndetermined to discourage.\n\nWhat I believe the companies should do is implement the above plus\na special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup\n"REGISTERED TO XXXXX -- address, city, state zip" and disables the above.\nTwo benefits: 1) encourages registration, 2) cuts down on pirating and\nmakes it more traceable, because if the patch's registration message is\nencrypted, it will be quite hard to change, and therefore provides a\nstable trail of who allowed their copy out of their hands, and thus\nviolated their license agreement.\n\nThis way, the legitimate users who does not register will experience minimal \ndiscomfort (who does major upgrades to their computer frequently?) as only\nproblem they have is they won't be able to restore to another computer.\n\nThe registered users would have proven they are legitmate users and therefore\ngains full rights, and can restore to different machines.  On the other hand,\nthe software company now have a record of where THIS particular copy is \nsupposed to be.  If this user's copy was found to be somewhere it was not \nsupposed to be, we know who has broken their license agreement.  Of course,\na hacker can break that eventually, but that's not the point, is it?

It's NOT the concrete floor that does it. The problem is that lead-acid\ncells self discharge over time. Even high quality cells (Gates for instance)\nwill discharge 50-60% over a 3-5 month period of time. Non-sealed cells\nself discharge even faster. If the battery was not completly charged\nwhen left sitting, it probably discharged past the the point where cell\nsulfiding occurs, which in many cases means a ruined battery.
I have a project in mind that requires an array of LEDs that can be addressed\nindividually by a microprocessor (say, 16x16 or so).

(I want to avoid having\na huge board covered with 373s if possible!)  Thanks in advance...
Just saw an article in New Scientist; AT&T videophones won't talk to (?)BTI \nvideophones. The AT&T ones use a 19.2kb modem, BTI uses 14.4kb.

Pink noise has constant power per geometric frequency increment\n(octave, 1/3 octave, etc).  Thus the 10kHz-20kHz octave has the same\namount of noise power as the 10Hz-20Hz octave.\n    White noise has constant power per arithmetic frequency increment\n(Hz, kHz, etc).  Thus the 10kHz-10.1kHz band has the same amount of\nnoise power as the 10Hz-110Hz band (both bands are 100Hz wide).\n    Pink noise can be made by passing white noise thru a -3db/octave\nfilter (usually approximated by a network of several RC pairs).\nNote: you can't get -3db/octave by using half a -6db/octave network \n:-(\n    Pink noise is commonly used in audio power response measurements.\nIt shows up on audio spectrum analyzers (with octave-related bands)\nas a flat line across the bands.

WHAT??!!!!\n\nYou can't remove it, unless you register?  \nYou gotta be joking, right?\nWhat happens if I get a demo-version of that program, install it, and then\ndecide that I don't like it.  Do I have to register to be able to get rid\nof it?  (Hell, no, that is the last thing I would think of!)\nIf that is what you mean, then you would better make pretty sure, that a\nstatement to that effect is printed loud and clear on the package!\n\n\nA better way to implement the above mentioned scheme is (IMHO) to allow\nanyone to install the program, but if they register, they get some\nadditional features enabled.  It could mean only one new .EXE file needed\nto be copied, to have got the full-version of the program.\nOf course anyone is _free_ to _delete_ or _remove_ that program at whatever\ntime they like.\n\nStill, we face the trouble of 'moving' the new .EXE file around.  That\ncould be solved by having the user registering him self, and get back a\nspecially marked for him (or her) a new .exe file.\n\n\nAs for some sort of limitations, here are some suggestions:\nLimit the size of data that the program can work with,\nDisable saving the data,\nPrint it out with some defects in the output (but be sure to mark them as\nsuch)\nLet some pop-up screen appear for ca. 10 secs. when the program is started\nand/or exited\n\netc....\nbut DON'T have it that you _must_ register to be able to remove it.

If you want slow LED flash rates, adjustable by switches (or by a\n4066/4016 digitally controlled switch), I suggest looking at a 555\noscillator chip. They cost ~$1 at Radio Shack (much cheaper in\nquantity at quality places), and you will be able to find good info\nabout simple circuits in a 555 oscialltor notebook (I think Forest\nMims has one at Radio Shack). You'll have to toy with\nresistor/capacitor values OR you can use your head with a little math\nto get the right frequencies. Any engineer worth his salt, can make a\n555 osciallator... It's in the book, and left up to you to see (I hate\ndoing ASCII circuit graphics). The 555 can accurately go from a few Hz\nto about 500 KHz (I think).\n\nAbout the Tape Recorder gizmo, you could alter a stereo tape deck to\nuse one channel as a DATA line (for flashing LED), and one as audio\nline (for voice or music). This would eliminate a lot of noise.\n\nThe data line is probably most easily done\nby some kind of PLL or bandpass filter (using just an op-amp). The 565\nchip is a good PLL, and not hard to work with. However if you nothing\nabout how a PLL works, I suggest you don't try this. Op-Amp\ninformation can also be found in the Forest Mims Radio Shack\ninfo-booklets, and the popular 741 op-amp is a snap to work with.\nSetting frequency and bandpass filter values are not so easy, so I\nwould suggest the 555 method firstmost... I have no idea what this is\ngoing into, so I am really generalizing...\n\nAs for manufacturing techniques, if you're only goofing with it, I\nsuggest you breadboard the thing... No need to solder. Wire-wrap would\nbe the next, more permanent step. And lastly, soldering/PCB making.\nHope that clears things......
No.  The blue LEDs sold down the street are in milky-white plastic.  \n\nAnd, fyi, putting a filter on a "typical visible light LED" (presumably meaning\na non-blue one) won't produce blue light.  A filter can only block light, it\ncan't generate wavelengths that aren't there to start with.
Are the boards at all intelligent?  (I.e., run by microcontrollers?)  The\neasiest thing would be to have another line that says that one of the\nboards is talking to the PC.  When this line was true, the other boards\ncould all hold off and not send their data.  This isn't a perfect solution,\nthough, since you have to worry a little about making sure two boards don't\ndecide to talk at the _exact same time_.\n\nOther than that, I think you will need to hook up each board to "something"\nthat speaks RS-232.  This actually isn't as hard (or as expensive!) as it\nused to be, though.  Assuming the boards talk relatively slowly (9600 BPS\nor slower), the PICs can coordinate things between themselves to multiplex\nthe data.  (This is really just forbicly adding the suggestion in the first\nparagraph to your system.  And it assumes that each board doesn't talk more\nthan 1/8th of the time, of for very long, since a PIC isn't going to be\nable to buffer more than, maybe 20-some bytes!)\n\nYou might want to check into the prices of multi-serial card for your PC,\nthough.  I recently bought a Boca Research 2x4 card (2 parallel ports, 4\nRS-232 ports) for a very reasonable $85.

From "Management of Electronics Assembly" (Ian Oakes)\nAfter talking about 63/37 tin lead alloy and the eutectic point...\n"Occasionally, impurities may be added to solder, to vary charactersitics \nwithin the soldering process in an attempt to improve performance.  For\nexample, addition of small quantities of antimony and copper can reduce\nthe amount solder moves under stress when solid.  For particular\napplications additions of impurities may be warranted but, in general, it\nis best to keep the solder used in a soldering process as pure as possible."\n\nI guess this is the good oil for commercial operations, but it doesn't\nmention anything esoteric.
Yes it has to be very clear (like it wasn't there).  And of course, cost is \nalways a factor.  I am trying to get an idea of the feasability of such an \nidea.  But I don't want to give too much away.

This would be susceptible to fading, multi-path etc. We used to use a\nsystem at the shop made by Tellurometer in South Africa. It used a\n10 GHz signal between 2 units across the distance to be measured.\nThe 10 GHz was just the carrier: the real signals were several switched\nones around 7.5 MHz or so, whose relative phases at the receiver would\nread out the digits of the distance down to 10 cm if needed. The units\ncame with psychrometers (sp?) to measure the relative humidity and\ninstructions for correction of the measurements due to RH and temp.\nThey were rather heavy and required an operator at each end.\nCurrent technology uses polarized reflectors, dual polaization TX/RX\nand psuedo-random coding of a radar pulse. about the same resolution\nat X band, much better at 47GHz. (Only one end is heavy :-)  ).\n \nRegards, Stu Beal, VE3MWM, U009@CSX.CCIW.CA,\nNational Water Research Institute, Burlington, Ontario, Canada.
Pink noise is a random signal with more low-frequency components\nthan white noise.\n\nIf you look at the frequency spectrum of white noise at a frequency\nanalyzer, you will find that the spectrum power density is flat, which\nmeans that every frequency is present in the noise signal.\n\nOften pink noise is obtained from white noise by integrating of low-pass\nfiltering a white noise signal. Therefore pink noise contains much more\nlow-frequency components.\n\nThe effect of pink noise is sometimes used to simulate thunder or roaring\nanimals. An additional low-pass filter with variable cutoff frequency will\nexplain you why.\n\nEnjoy it.

One of the most popular methods of course is the password check where they ask\nyou for a word from page x, line y, and word z, but this is pitifully simple to\nremove unless you throw some checksums into the main part of your program, and\nsome self-rewriting code to confuse some people.  Also, make sure that your\nprogram can not be run out a debugger.\n\nAnother method of course is to not even make bad sectors on the original disk,\njust write a certain key to a certain unallocated sector.   To help you here,\nyou also must do the code protection schemes mentioned in the first paragraph.\nMake sure you also fill the rest of the unallocated parts of the disk with\ngarbage as well, or they (wanna be crackers) can just look for the junk in\nsome random sector.\n\nLike you mentioned, there are the laser holed disks and hardware keys, but they\nare both expensive and a pain in the butt for the end-user, which you is the\nopposite of what you want.\n\nAnother configuration that can be used is to save the configuration of the\nmachine that it is being installed to in the most undecipherable format you can\nthink of.  If the program does not find that this is the same system, it\nrequests being installed by the original disk again.  The original disk should\nbe encrypted, compacted, have many sectors that should be checked, and anything\nelse you can think of to make sure that the original cannot be copied.  Once\nagain, you MUST put code-encryption, self-rewriting code, and multiple CRC\nchecks in the program to make sure that it does not get changed.  Among other\nthings, this also protects your program from virii.  If the program detects a\nchange in its code, tell the user that a virus has been detected in the\nprogram.  Tell them the program is "VIRUS SECURE", and remember, you have\nhelped the world kill some pirating and kill some viruses.  Feel good.\n\nI hope that I have helped.  Have fun.  Knock some cracking out (well, you can't\ndo it, everything that can be written can be cracked, but you'll piss'em off in\nthe process!).

What are people's opinions about laser detectors?  Escort makes a\nlaser detector, the Passport 1000, and claims it works fine.  However,\nI've talked to some people who have said that it will only work if you\nare lucky - i.e. if the cop happens to point his laser at a car in\nfront of you, and the laser beam happens to reflect back to your\ndetector.  Otherwise it won't work.  Regular radar, of course, travels\nin all directions; hence it is more detectable.  Any comments?\n\nEscort has a deal (till the end of April, I think), where if you buy\ntheir wideband (Passport 3200 - X, K, Ka) and laser detectors, you'll\nsave $60 off of buying them separately.  In this case, the addition of\nthe laser detector over the Passport 3200 is only $40 (i.e. Passport\n1000 normally costs $100).\n--\nEddie Gornish\nUniversity of Illinois - Center for Supercomputing Research & Development
Bzzzzzt! Wrong answer.

I once wrote such a program (in BBC basic...) It was very crude, and took\naround 5 seconds to do an exhaustive search (with a small amount of \nintelligence), and told you the best combination >Rq and the best below Rq.\n\nIf you want to write one, just store the prefered values in an array, and\nthen search the solution space using three nested loops. I'm sure you\ncould knock this up in an hour.\n\nChristopher
sure the\nway is\non\ndifferent\n\nOkay, so what do you do if some part of the machine (presumably the part  \non which the code number or whatever that the program has fixated itself  \nupon goes bad, you replace that part, and now your program won't run  \nbecause it's on a "different" computer???\n\nThis is, of course, assuming that the program uses something in ROM (like  \nthe BIOS serial number, maybe?) and not a disk-based code number.   \nObviously if the drive goes bad you'll be reinstalling the stuff anyway.\n\nI work in a computer lab which is part of the university microlab system.   \nWe have the wonderfully fun task of maintaining well over a hundred  \nmachines, both PC and Macintosh, as well as administering a network of  \nover 50 NeXT machines.  I personally am concerned only with a small lab  \nwith ten PC's and ten Mac's.  (I'm not the manager, but help him with  \nadmin often).  IMHO, copy-protection schemes of ANY sort are nothing more  \nthan a major headache for the legitimate user.  Anyone who wants a copy of  \nyour program and doesn't care about legality will get a copy.  Period.   \n"Pirate board" or no pirate board.  I too have "friends" who blatantly and  \nquite successfuly "hack" copy protection schemes practically in their  \nsleep.\n\nLet's consider what goes on in our lab.  Almost daily we have at least one  \nmachine down, sometimes several, due to some goofball screwing up some  \nsetting or other on a piece of software.  Admittedly, we (being students,  \nmostly) are not the world's most efficient and effective network  \nadministrators, but we try.  Keeping even the twenty machines that are  \n(partly) my responsibility even vaguely looking and "acting" similar to  \nthe average user, and maintaining "behind-the-scenes" consistency is a  \nreal headache, but not so bad a headache as trying to remember twenty  \ndifferent folder locations of Norton Utilities when some guy trashes his  \ndisk.\n\nOften we have hardware problems at peak "business" times and have to do  \nsome parts-swapping to get stuff working temporarily. . . .\n\nWell, I'll cut to the chase and quit boring y'all . . ..\n\nThe point is, often we have to re-install software and copy configuration  \nfiles etc. from machine to machine.  By far the easiest way we have found  \nto do this is to get ONE machine working EXACTLY the way we want to, then  \nCOPY the complete setup of this machine to the other nine (of that  \nmachine's type).  This ensures us that (for at least ten minutes) we have  \nten IDENTICAL machines to work with.  Having them networked simplifies  \nthis considerably, as our major packages (WordPerfect, Windows, etc.) are  \nall network versions and thus only one copy to mess with.\n\nOften, however, we need to install a package requested by some instructor  \nto one, some, or all of the machines for a special project.  This is  \nusually a hand-written or shareware,etc. program similar to what I believe  \nthe original poster was asking about.  The few we have had with "copy  \nprotection" schemes have caused nothing but NIGHTMARES for us to maintain  \n . .\n\nIn short, don't waste your time with a copy protection scheme.  It's sort  \nof like outlawing guns.  The criminals will get your program anyway, and  \nyou will only be hurting the legitimate, honest user.  Write a good user's  \nguide and tech manual, whatever else for your program (PLEASE do this  \nREGARDLESS of whether you copy protect the thing!!!), and only distribute  \nthe manual to LICENSED users.  Jack the price to cut your losses, but  \nplease take a cue from the major companies (who can admittedly afford the  \ncosts of illegal copies far better than you) and don't burden the  \nlegitimate user with a "copy protection" scheme!\n\n\nSorry for the tirade, but it's been a long day here . . .. :-)\n\n\nMark S.

[stuff about hardware keys]\n\n\nTrue, which is why many of the newer keys ship out, oh, maybe 32 bits or\nso, have the key encrypt them, and return them to the PC.  Making a bunch\nof these 32 bits part of your program code is a good way to make sure\nthings won't run without the key. :-)  Anyway, then, this scheme at least\ndefeats your approach.  It's a little costly, though.\n\nPersonally, I don't believe in copy protection, and agree with the thought\nthat the mass inconvenience that it causes all legal users far outweighs\nthe gains from what few pirates won't be able to copy the program.
I was a bit surprised that the manual for my Fluke-87 multimeter\nsuggests applying WD-40 to the test lead sockets, especially the\ncurrent range socket.  The intention is to prevent the\ntest-lead-is-in-the-wrong-scocket beeper from going off when there\nis no test lead in that socket.\n\nThe manual is a bit vague, but I think I'd apply the WD-40 to a\nswab, then wipe the socket instead of spaying the stuff directly\nfrom the can.\n\nSpeaking of said meters:  I compared the 87 against the 8060A that\nI've had on my bench for almost 11 years.  It has been five years\nsince the 8060A has been calibrated.  On the DC scale, they agree\nwithin .01 mV.  AC scale is within about .1 mV.  The 87 would be\njust about the perfect portable meter if it had the dB scale; I\ndidn't feel it was worth the extra $100 for a second 8060 since I\ndon't use dB all that much in my work.
This is not a good idea.. I upgraded my motherboard last fall.  I\nwould have been quite pissed at any software that would have forced me to\nreinstall simply because I changed motherboards.\n\n	Any info in the BIOS is too volatile to use as a checksum.  Are you\ngoing to require that a user re-install all their software if they add 4Mb\nof RAM to their computer?  I did that a couple of weeks ago.  It's in the\nBIOS, and if software had told me "this isn't the machine you installed me\non" I would never have used that software again.  Really bad idea.\n\n\n	This is silly.  It's much easier to loan disks to a friend and let\nthem do an install than to backup your copy already on disk, and then give\nthem that.  Your scheme isn't going to stop anyone.\n\n\n	Do you know any assembly language at all?  All anyone needs to do if\nfind the part of the code that does the quiz, and insert a JMP instruction\nto just completely skip it.  Not that difficult, really!  And there is very\nlittle that commpanies can do to stop this type of thing.  Using PKLITE or\nsome similar utility would help, but only if the resulting compressed .EXE\nwere tagged as uncompressable.\n\n\n	This is by far the best idea you presented in your post.  Making it\nplainly obvious who registered is going to stop casual pirates. But, the\ndetermined ones are just going to answer "Joe Blow" to the question of\n"what's your name" so this won't stop them in the long run.\n\n	Pirates are always going to win this fight.  They simply have more\ntime to work on the software and figure out the protection scheme.\n\n--\nSteve Madsen\nsjmadsen@nextsrv.cas.muohio.edu

I remember, back before commercial mikes with the "PZM" label (for\nPressure Zone Microphone) started showing up, I read an article,\nin some engineering journal, that described the principles involved.\nAll the physics aside, from a practicle standpoint the author's said\nthey built a prototype with nothing more than a small Sony lavelier\nmike laid up against a large aluminum disk.  In demonstrating it at\na presentation to audio engineers, this was impressive enough that\nthe people present were bugging them about where they could buy them.\n\nAnyway...I want to build some to use as "choir mikes" (wide coverage).\nI've had good luck using some small electret mike elements I got\nfrom Digi-Key - most of these are limited-bandwidth, peakey units\nbut for a buck or two more I got the ones spec'd to go out to 20kHz\nwith a bit flatter response.  \n\nThe distance of the mike opening from the flat plate is kind of\ncritical.  I'm debating whether to mount it on it's side, which\nputs the opening a shade under 2mm from the plate, or mounting\nit with the opening actually pointing down into the plate at a\nsmall clearance.  I haven't dissected a unit like you can buy at\nRadio Shack to see how they do it.  Thoughts?
Why can't he record it legally?  It may not be admissable in court, but\nrecording for personal use is legal.

Yet another suggestion, but this one is non-toxic (although I would handle\nit like any other cleaner) and it smells nice.  The chemical is called\nd-Limonene, and it smells like lemon peels (I think it is a lemon extract\nof some kind).  You might find it in a hardware store, sold as a\ngeneral-purpose solvent, but your best bet would be any bike store --\nit is used as a chain-cleaning fluid.  It works on sticker glue, crayons,\ngrease, oil, etc.\n\nIt's clear yellow in the bottle, and you can use it straight; if you add\nwater, it changes to a creamy consistency, which is good for some jobs.
Having vainly looked for devices capable of dealing to the NEC 77P20\nDSP chip which dont require taking out a mortgage, i decided to roll\nmy own. Not a difficult task for an 8751, given that all the timing\nrelationships are set out in the databook. One thing bothers me, that\nis the accursed 50ms 21 volt Vpp pulse.

Does anybody have an idea how to model a tunnel diode on SPICE?\nThank you.
Yup, it's not all that difficult to do.\n\n\nThe Panasonic cartridges aren't bad, but they aren't spectacular.\n\n\nDon't mount it on the side.  Call up Crown, the company that has the\npatent on the PZM, and ask them for information on construction and\nuse of the things.  You may have to determine the correct spacing\nemperically with a noise source and a spectrum analyzer because the\ndesign of the Panasonic cartridges uses a tuned cavity in front of\nthe electret element to increase the high frequency response, and you\nare going to be altering the resistance through the cavity entrance.\n\nCrown has a nice book on the subject, though it's unfortunately rather\nshort on mathematics.  There's a JAES article from many years back, too.

Charlie Brett's suggestion -- buy one of the disposable flash cameras, use\nthe film, then take the thing apart -- is a good one.  Note, though, that\nyou won't get a particularly precise voltage out of such a thing, and it\nmay be a single-point design that won't adapt well to off-nominal operation.\n\nThe things are easy to dismantle.  The key piece of information is that\nwhen you advance the film on one of them, you are winding it *into* the\nfilm cassette -- it is unwound from the cassette in the factory, when\nthe camera is made.  So no darkroom is needed for dismantling.  It's\nstandard film, so just take the cassette in for processing.\n\nAll the camera-store people do when you bring in one of the disposables\nis rip it apart, toss the film cassette into the to-be-processed bin,\nand throw the battery in one trashcan and the rest of the camera in\nanother.  If you take it apart yourself, you get an AA alkaline battery\n(still with a fair bit of life in it) and all kinds of little bits and\npieces from the camera.\n\nI expect you could even re-load and re-use the camera if you were really\ndetermined.
I'm looking for a circuit that will flash an led on in response \nto the output from a walkman cassette player. How could I do this?\nI don't want it just to turn on, I want it to 'strobe' once so to speak,\nper every beep I put on a cassette tape. \n\n     Would it be better to use a circuit based on the volume of the beeps\non the cassette, or better for the leds to respond to a tone of a certain\nfrequency? Is there any easy way to do either of these? I'm looking for \nthe simplest circuit possible. I guess what I'm asking for is some sort of\ncolor organ, but not quite. Let me trt to explain again...\n\n\n     I'm going to have a pattern of beats (or beeps) on a cassette tape.\nSo on the tape you'd hear:   beep! (pause) beep! (pause) beep! (pause)..etc. \n, with speed increasing as time goes on. I want to synchronize an LED (\nprobably two of them) with the beeps on the cassette tape. So the LED, with\neach beep, would go on and off real quick, generating a strobe light sort\nof effect. The rapidity of the beeps on the tape would in turn effect the\nrapidity of the blinking of the LEDS. And if there was no sound on the tape\n(except for background his), the LEDs would remain off. Please help!\n\n\n  Thanks,

You don't say what kind of "electronic equipment" you mean.  It's hard\nto give a generic answer.  There is essentially no solvent that won't\ndo things like washing lubricant out of switches.\n\nWhen we've needed to do an emergency cleaning job on things, we've just\nused distilled water.

Hey, can someone clue me in on these and other weird types of amplifiers?  Just\na brief intro to the concepts behind these would be cool.  I have the clues \non type A, B, and AB already and stuff, but these other ones are mentioned \noccasionally and I dont know what they do.  I think type D is like a PWM scheme\nor something.  Thanx in advanced.
Yes. It's called RADAR.\n\n\nDepends on the environment: in a static environent such as a waveguide yes, in\na dynamic environment (with objects moving about) the multipath kills this\nconcept.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between vertical and horizontal?
: \n:    Hams can legally run up to 1500 watts.  It is very unlikely, however,\n:    that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs\n: \n: Not possible either.  You'd need about a 300 amp alternator for\n: just the amplifier.  I can just see it.  You need to slow\n: down on a downgrade,  so you hit the push to talk button.\n\nWell - 100+ amps anyway. Transmissions are generally for a short interval.\nThe battery would supply the rest. Of course, if you transmitted too much,\nyou would run the battery down.\n\nIt really would not be that much of a brake.  Even at 50% efficiency, 1500\nwatts would only consume 4 horsepower.

I thought the first thread was hilarious, so here goes another post.\n\nSome more background information on what has happened to my poor batteries.\n\n  One year, I left the batteries in the garage.  The garage is Unheated.  \nThey were left in their places that they needed to be.  One in the riding\nlawnmower (what a lux) and one in each motorcycle.  The battery in the \nriding lawnmower was about 3-4 years old, and one of the cycle batteries \nwas new, and one was around 5 years old.  Upon spring time, I discovered\nthat all of the batteries were dead, and needed to be recharged.  They all\nworked properly, except for the older ones, and they had to be replaced \nabout halfway through the summer.  (they had originally been stored\nin the garage, and I think I remember my dad charging them in spring)\n  Last year, I decided to bring them in to the basement, which has two parts.\none is dirt and brick, and the other is concrete.  I brought in all three, and\ndiscovered in the spring, (about 15 days ago) that not only were the batteries\ndead, but when I put the charger on them, the charger said "HMMMMMMMM" and \nthe amp-meter read around 1,000,000,000  (In other words, it was pinned)\nthe internal circut tripped, and I went on to the other batteries.  They\nwere the same.  \n   Realizing that we still had 2 GIGANTIC sailboat batteries, also lead\nacid, I decided to put the charger on them.  (these had been sitting for around 1 and a half years, on the brick and dirt part) and noticed that they only\nneeded a small charge, around 2 hours or so on trickle.  I tested them\nby using them at the local gas station for giving jump starts, and they\nworked fine for around 25 of 'em. \n  This leads me to believe one of several things.\n     1) I bought really #$%tty batteries last year. (sorta true)\n     2) the concrete has something to do with the discharge of the\n        batteries.\n     3) There was enough moisture to short out the terminals in the \n          room where the concrete is, \n     4) The dirt room was able to absorb the moisture in the air\n         better than concrete.\n\n(BTW, I can almost waterski in the dirt room)
PUFF is sold by CalTech, although very inexpensively for the quality.\nSource was also available for the earlier releases for a nominal charge,\nbut I'm not sure if this practise is continued.\n\n \nRegards, Stu Beal, VE3MWM, U009@CSX.CCIW.CA,\nNational Water Research Institute, Burlington, Ontario, Canada.

While I have gotten 8-9 years out of this digital receiver, it\nhas been acting VERRY strange of late.  I hope that  the following	\nsymptoms may help someone diagnose the error:\n\n- i know that whatever lithium memory backup it had - has long died\nthus if i unplug it - it won't remember the presets\n\n- it has given up listening to the remote.  (i tried changing the remote's\nbatteries) when i try a remote function - the receiver registers that it\nreceived it (a green remote light flashes) but the right function\ndoesn't happen - if any function at all.  (also strange- when i hit \nthe "mute" button, for example, the display panel goes black - yikes-	\ni've never seen that before ...)\n\n- before all the strangeness started, the system turned itself OFF and ON\nagain - by itself\n\n- sometimes it won't play a radio station, so i have to kinda twist it \n(yes kinda flex the motherboard, chasis) for it to get the radio\ntuning back - the aux in function always works however....\n\nit is inconvenient, but NOT inconvenient enough to pay an \nexpensive repair fee.  while, i'm not a hardware guy, i wonder \nif something as simple as a surge supressor will be a quick fix.\nthe strange thing is that these symptoms come and go ...\n\nsomeone told me this unit series has a bad Voltage Amp chip.

MEK has a\nmethyl (CH3) on one side, and an ethyl (C2H5) on the other.  Acetone\nhas two methyls.  So acetone is not methyl ethyl ketone, but instead\nis dimethyl ketone.  Both solvents have similar properties.  I think\nthat MEK may be a little less flammable but a lot worse to breathe.\nIt's a lot harder to buy MEK than it once was.

Does anyone have recommendations on whether a smart data I/O (print spooler,\ndigital sampling, etc.) would be better implemented with a DMA chip or a\ndedicated microcontroller?

For those who are interested, the FCC does indeed care about cable\nleakage, particularly into the aviation nav band, or leakage that\nis "causing interference to other services".\n\nPart 76.611 details specific limits to acceptable leakage, and\nmeasurement technique.  If you will clearly document your problem,\nand measurement technique (a signal level meter with dipole is the\nnormal approach, remember to correct between measurement data and\nmicrovolts per meter) and fax or mail the details to Mr. John Wong\nCable Branch, FCC 1919 M st. NW Wash DC, and a copy of your letter\nto the local cable company, you will get results.  In fact the cable\ncompany will probably start treating you much better when they realize\nyou have figured out how to get the FCCs attention.\n\nWhat is important is to document your case as it relates to the\napplicable rules.  However the cable company *is required* to\nat least check out every complaint of leakage.  They must file\nwith the commission and maintain on premises a yearly measurement\nreport that details the results of leakage testing.\n\nBut remember, call the cable company first, and give them a\nchance to work to correct the problem before contacting\nthe commission.\n\nI am in the business of measuring cable system leakage via\nthe airborne method.
It's not the temperature, it's the karma.  You see, dirt has good karma,\nsince it's all organic and full of living things, but cement is all squared\noff and artificial looking, and has lost its karma in the process.  Being\na karma sink, it sucks all of the good karma out of the battery which is no\nlonger able to keep a charge.

Greets,\n \nI have an IC I need help in identifying.

Wrong, it has a 6507.\n\n\nIt had one custome chip (not an ASIC in the sense that word is now understood):\nthe TIA (sometimes known as the 6526, although most other manufacturers list\nthat as the CIA complex interface adapter.)  TIA stands for Television\nInterface Adapter, and it handles sound, paddles and the minimal video hardware\nthe 2600 possessed.\n\nThere was also a standard 6532 RAM, I/O, Timer (RIOT), plus a voltage\nregulator and (if memory serves) a 555 timer.  That's all.\n\n\nNot according to the servicing documentation I have here.  The 2600 did not\nchange intenally very much at all.\n\n\nROMS were mapped into the upper 4K of the 6507's address space.  2K and 4K\ngames were fine, but later 8K and 16K games needed bank switching.  Atari\n(and others) made much of these "huge" cartridges.\n\n\nWrong, it had 128 bytes of RAM from the RIOT.  This was multiply mapped into\nboth page 0 (pseudo-registers) and page 1 (stack), and also throughout the\nbottom 4K of memory.  TIA registers also sat in this address space.\n\nAs 128 bytes of RAM was somewhat limiting, some later cartridges also carried\nRAM themselves, which was interesting as Atari had provided no write line\nto the cart.  This was managed by mapping the reads from RAM into one address\nthe *very* scarce ROM address space.

Actually, no I don't have a tape drive.  In the event of a total\nhard disk failure, I reinstall the apps from originals, and restore the data\nfrom the backups I keep of that.  With upwards of 100Mb of stuff on my hard\ndisk, there is no way I'm going to try and back it all up without a tape\ndrive. :)  Would be nice to have one though!\n\n\n	Maybe, maybe not.  Today it doesn't happen as often (I would hope),\nbut then if a BIOS is buggy and the user gets an upgrade, the BIOS\ninformation is going to change, at least the date anyway.  Tagging the BIOS\nmanufacturer is still going to falsely tag those users who upgrade the\nmotherboard.  This type of upgrade doesn't require a hard disk\nbackup/restore.\n\n\n	As long as it wasn't done too terribly often.  Otherwise I think it\nwould get annoying and the user would go looking for other software.\n\n\n\n	Of course not.  If something gets corrupted and my app needs to be\nreinstalled, the *worst* thing I want that software telling me is "this\nsoftware has already been registered to <blank> and it is against the law to\ninstall it on other machines."  Or something similar; Access for Windows\ndoes this and it only requires a click on "OK" to go away.  Pretty\nnon-intrusive, but it gets the point across.\n\n\n	This is a great idea.  I like the key system that some shareware\nproducts use.  The only problem is that it will be difficult for big\nsoftware companies to implement this without it getting very\ncost-ineffective for them and more of a burden than a benefit to the users.\n\n--\nSteve Madsen\nsjmadsen@nextsrv.cas.muohio.edu
Inkjet and Bubblejet printers are the same tech.  "Bubblejet" was trademarked\nby Cannon and inkjet was by HP I belive.

Not entirely true. A friend of mine was having trouble finishing the game\nGODS and asked me for help since he could not find a "trainer" (small\npatch that lets you play without losing lifes). The game is compressed but\nI did find *one* byte which when changed in the original *compressed* file\nwould not affect the decompression and would also prevent the "shield" in the\ngame from being tured off turning therefore making you invincible.\n\nThere are many other progs whose copy protection was defeated one way or\nanother and I have seen examples of this with my own eyes. The copy\nprotection schemes defeated were various such as using protected mode,\ncompressed executables, progs that load and execute other progs (possibly\ncompressed), dongles, key disks, etc...\n\nI believe that persistence overcomes even the very best copy protection\nschemes.
Look for information about 567 tone decoder chip. It is an easy to use\nchip for detecting sound of certain frequency.

It should be simplest way to go. The chip costs\nsomething like 1-2 $.

The first step is to make sure that there is no DC component, intentional\nor not, on the audio lines to be switched. If neither the output or\ninput presents an unintentional DC level (let's say they're capacitively\ncoupled), then putting a 22 K resistor from each input to ground, and\nfrom the output to ground is a good precaution against leakage in any\ncoupling caps presenting a DC level that is GUARANTEED to cause a click.\n\nIf the device presents an unintentional DC level that is from more than\njust coupling capacitor leakage, then you need to remove the DC before\nswitching with coupling capacitors of your own.\n\nIf you have more than one relay (each relay switching one input\nthrough to a common output), you can use make-before-break switching\nwhere for a brief instant both sources are connected during a switch\nchange. This may mask the switch click.\n\nAn audio switch that is clickless is made by taking a light bulb and\nmaking your own ersatz opto-isolator with a light-dependent resistor (LDR)\nsealed inside a piece of black heatshrink. Many broadcast consoles\nuse this older, but time-honored technique. Claro actually makes\na complete optisolator like this, but I don't have a part number handy.\nRadio Shack has a LDR grab-bag (276-1657) you might want to try.\n\nFor a simple, solid state clickless switch that is cheap, you might try \nlooking at the CD4066 analog switch that is commonly available (or its\nolder predecessor, the 4016). Again, the DC component must be removed\nprior to switching. Other alternatives include JFET switches (both discrete\nand IC) and diode switching (which works relatively well, surprisingly).\nAll the above, with their pitfalls and application tips could easily\nmake a subject for a multi-page article.\n\nSolid state switches may induce a click of their own when turned on\ndue to charge being injected into the audio line through device\ncapacitance when the control signal changes state. Techniques to\nminimize this include lowering the impedance of the signal paths through\nthe switch, differential switching, and slowing the risetime of the\ncontrol pulse. With the 4016, cutting the click can be as simple as\nputting 10K - 47K resistors in series with the control pins.\n\nHope this helps at least get you started.\n\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Dave Medin			Phone:	(205) 730-3169 (w)\n    SSD--Networking				(205) 837-1174 (h)\n    Intergraph Corp.\n       M/S GD3004 		Internet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.com\n  Huntsville, AL 35894		UUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin\n\n   ******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) *******

Rubbish. The reason for the colour of the boards depends on the solder\nmask that is used. Older boards (bakelite and phenolic) rarely used\na solder mask (these boards are not suited well to automatic stuffing\nand soldering techniques) and hence are the colour of the compound\nused to make them. These days boards are made of fibreglass for most\ngeneral purpose uses and have a solder mask applied to them to prevent\nclose traces shorting to one another during soldering (and also to prevent\nthe decomposition of traces under harsh environments). The light and dark\ngreen boards ofter seen have a "dry film" mask applied to them (usually\napplied as a complete film photographically produced). The blue (and red\nor orange) boards are a two-part epoxy or a liquid-imageable resist\nformulation and are applied in a different manner. There's a lot of info\nabout the pro's and con's of each, but that's another story...\n\n    Sla/n go fo/ill,\n                    Risky B.

Most switches are now digital and thoses that aren't have\nbeen retrofitted with "magic fingers" that converts from DTMF to pulse\ndialing.\n\nThomas

Nope.  Your problem is either being caused by excessive voltage drop in the\nlong cable from the generator, or just plain not having enough power.  I\nwould suspect that those amps are going to draw a lot of current on short\npeaks.\n\nYou can try using larger (and shorter) cables to the generator, or try\nstrapping the amps for 240V service and running 240V mains cables out,\nwhich will minimize the line drop.  If these don't work, though, you're\ngoing to need a bigger generator.\n\nI assume that you're using well-maintained generators, and have watched the\nvoltage output on the generator properly.  If you don't have 120V coming out\nof the unloaded generator you'll never get 120V at the other end.
When will people learn!\n\nThe trouble is the ballast in the concrete and as every fool knows Ballast \nresistors are used to discharge batteries. Furthermore it is very silly to \nstore the battery with the terminals downwards as you must have done to \ncontact the ballast. \n\nSeriously: self discharge (the actual problem, as stated by others) does vary \ngreatly with certain types and freaks show low self discharge. I have in \nfact seen ordinary automotive batteries which have effectively held full \ncharge for > 2 years so it must be possible.\n\nIf your garage is heated, store the batteries somewhere cooler but above \nfreezing (flat batteries freeze more easily). Occasionally charge it (once a \nmonth?) or even leave it on 'float' charge permanently (special charger, \nDON'T do this unless you know what you are doing, seriously dangerous).\n\nAnouther point is the unsuitability of automotive batteries for things like \nelectric mowers -- they are not generally designed to be repeatedly deep \ndischarged and their life may be greatly shorted. Some early zero maintenance \nautomotive batteries in fact responded to a full discharge with total failure \nshortly afterwards but modern ones are superb. (6yrs, 95000 miles and \ncounting)

The concrete floor accelerates the problem because it is a heat sink and a\ncolder lead-acid battery self-discharges at a slightly faster rate. That's\nwhy the old wives' tale of sitting it on a piece of wood on the floor works\nto help keep from killing the battery as fast ---- it insulates the battery\nthermally. It you'll set the battery down on a piece of styrofoam, it will\nself-discharge even slower. The best thing would be to attach a small load\nsuch as a small transistor radio with the volume turned down low and leave it\non constantly, but also trickle-charge it every couple days too to "shallow-\ncycle" the charge in the battery. Such mild "exercising" of a lead-acid\nbattery is the next best thing to completely removing the electrolyte for\nstorage. If you do remove the electrolyte, may sure you keep separate storage\ncontainers for each cell's electrolyte and put it back into the same cells\nwhen you refill the battery. This isn't so critical for a brand-new battery\nin a fully charged state, but will maximize the restored output of an older\nbattery which may not be fully charged when you remove the electrolyte for   \nstorage.

This is called silver bearing solder.   It is used to solder to\ndevices that have silvered contacts.   One application is soldering\nto the ceramic terminal strips used in the old Tektronix scopes.   These\nwere notched ceramic strips that were silver plated in the notches.\nIf you used ordinary solder the molten metal would disolve the silver\noff of the ceramic.   The silver was quite thin.   The 2% is a saturated\nsolution of silver in tin and lead.    Thus, no more silver can be\ndisolved in the solder solution.   Other devices that use silver contacts\nare quartz crystals and ultrasonic transducers.

I am not a battery expert, but from recent reading, a lead acid battery\nwill self discharge at a relatively high rate, and if stored in a discharged\nstate, will develop a condition I think is called sulfation.  In storage,\neither the electrolyte should be removed and replaced for use (fat chance\nI'd ever do that at home), or the battery should be stored on a trickle\ncharge.  I have also (I think) read that the condition may be reversable\nif hooked up to a current limited charging circuit fro a LONG period of time.\nThe refernce I remember is to use C/50 (where C is the amp hours) as the\ncharging circuit, and leave it hooked up for weeks.  Some of this may\nonly apply to Gel type cells, but I suspect the same applies to the liquid\ntype.

On the time\nscales in question, and with the considerably reduced temperature swings\nseveral feet underground, there isn't going to be any major temperature\ndifference between the battery and what it's sitting on.\n\n\nBecause the temperature of your hand, *unlike that of the battery*, is\ndetermined by the balance between internal heat production and external\nheat loss.  You're feeling the greater rate of heat loss from an object\n(your hand) which is kept much warmer than its surroundings.  In the case\nof an object with no significant internal heat production, this will\naffect how quickly it comes into equilibrium with its surroundings (if\nit started out not in equilibrium with them) but won't affect the final\ntemperature.\n\nFor the same reason, windchill affects whether you will freeze but not\nwhether water will freeze.

Oh, yeah.  This is a fine place.  We haven't had the "why does concrete\nkill lead-acid batteries" thread in at least six months.\n\n\nThe concrete simply sucks all the electrons out of the battery and drains\nthem into the ground.\n\nAnother explanation, implausible as it is,  is that the lead-acid battery\nneeds to be periodically charged (topped-off), otherwise the battery\nself-discharges and then undergoes irreversible chemical reaction.\n\nNaawwwww.... the concrete sucks the life out.
Back in high school I worked as a lab assistant for a bunch of experimental\npsychologists at Bell Labs.  When they were doing visual perception and\nmemory experiments, they used vector-type displays, with 1-millisecond\nrefresh rates common.\n\nSo your case of 1/200th sec is quite practical, and the experimenters were\nprobably sure that it was 5 milliseconds, not 4 or 6 either.\n\n\nSteve

I would expect that CD-ROM software would not even need copy protection.\nAs the program on a CD-ROM would not fit onto a hard-drive, and it is\nimpossible for the average (and even not-so-average) user to write to a\nCD-ROM, copies of the software (that still work) could never be made.\n\nHmmm.. now that I think about it.. with a creative TSR, maybe\ndisk-swapping could be used to simulate files on a single disk. You\nwould need a tonne of disks though.
You might want to get a disposible flash camera, shoot the roll of film,\nthen take it apart (they're snapped together). We used a bunch of them\nat my wedding, but instead of sending the whole camera in, I just took\nthe film out (it's a standard 35mm canister), and kept the batteries\n(they use one AA battery). Sorry, I didn't keep any of the flash electronics.
If you use MEK for your sake wear safty glasses or better still\nindustrial goggles. The small est drop in the eye will casue\nblindness by a catalysis reaction that is non cureavble once it starts.\nThe results are similar to mustard gas contamination.

I'm doing some work on the Mac IIsi and need some information on the CPU.\nI have the Motorola MC68030UM/AD Rev. 1, but I fear it is out of date as it\ndoes not have the characteristics for the CPU package type used in the IIsi.\n\nWhat I need is the Theta (JC) Thermal Characteristic (the Junction to Case\nthermal resistance) for the _PLASTIC_ FE style package.\n\nIf you have this info, I would appreciate your sending it by email as postings\nsuffer a few days delay here.\n\nIf you are keen on this stuff, I am also interested in a more accurate value\nfor the typical power dissipation. I'm assuming 2.25 Watts (using the 2.6 W\nmaximum at 0 C decreased the way the Pd drops in the 6801x as Ta increases).\nIf your manual has a chart of power dissipation, I'd like to know what it\nreads at 25 C and 40 C.\n\nThanks for reading!
If you can modify the design of the DTMF decoder, the ideal comunications\nwould be over a multi-drop system, like RS-485.  RS-485 boards are available\nfor PC's, probably cheaper than a bunch of RS-232 channels, and RS-485 is\ncheaper to build onto your satellite modules, using only a single supply\n8-pin DIP driver chip.  Software at the PC end would be similarly complex\nfor either RS-232 or RS-485, in my opinion.  The higher data rates possible\nwith RS-485 would permit quasi-simultaneous data transmission.\nHope this helps.

I'm looking for some specs for a Toshiba TA6267-BP.

To put it bluntly, they are full of it.\n\nPaying a tape is playing a tape.  There is no difference whether the \noutput goes to a second VCR or to a TV.  (How the VCR or TV reacts to \nthis signal is a different story - see messages pertaining to macrovision \ncopy protection.)\n\nIn order for the tape to self-destruct, it would have to have circuitry \nof its own within the tape case.  The circuit would have to somehow \nmagically determine what the output of the VCR is connected to.  The \ncircuit would then have to have an erasing head to actually do anything.\n\nIt is a pretty lame scare tactic.  (I've seen something similar on a BBS.\nWhen the SYSOP wanted to, he could have a message sent to the user's end \nsaying that it is sending the code to format your HD.)
The color of the board shows the composition of it, hence the use of it.\n\nOriginal and older boards were bakelite composition, and were brown.\nPhenolic (spelling) was a tan\nMost "non filled" fiberglass boards used in computers are green.\nFilled fiberglass is blue.\nTeflon is white.\n\nAs boards evolved more and more demands were made of them.  First boards were\nused mainly in audio circuitry.  Couldn't be used in high voltage or RF because\nit would arc and burn.  Most boards today are fiberglass, the type being chosen\nby its use and cost.  \n\nBoards in satellite and microwave communication are teflon (and ceramic) as the\nfiberglass, and other boards are conductive (they actually work more as a \ncapacitive dialectric, but the word conductive simplifies explaination) at the\nhigh frequencies.\n\nAnother printed circuit material used mainly in automotive and interconnections\nis a thin flexible (mostly mylar) material and is used to connect the front of\nthe vehicle (etc) to the back instead of wiring harnesses.  Camcorders use this\nto intereconnect the boards inside where wires would be a nuisance.\n\nAm working on a generator made by Hewlet Packard right now and the entire board\nis gold plated, boy it looks expensive!!!\n\nHope I got most of my facts right as I am working from memory of material read.\n\nMy education was pre-transister!\n-- \n73, Tom\n================================================================================\nTom Wagner, Audio Visual Technician.

The battery goes dead primarily becaust the floor is cold.  The temperature\ncombined with self-discharge promotes sulfation which ruins the plates of \nthe battery.  I strongly suspect that the only reason the battery doesn't\ngo dead as quickly on a dirt surface is because cement tends to be quite\ncooler.
I think its a great, but idealistic idea. A reseacher will first of all try \nto publish a worthy paper in a credible, professional magazine and not in a \ncommunity like USENET which is infamous for lots (not all) of junk \ninformation. The papers that will be "published" here will, in general, be \nof low quality. Also, it is improbable that any credit will be given to a \nresearcher who publish here - and sadly, that is nowadays a main reason for \npublishing.\n\nUSENET is great for informal discussions and free exchange of ideas - keep \nit like that. A new, specialist group is just not worth it.

Not that the question is anything important, but I am still curious:\nWhy is that almost all printed circuit boards are green? I have seen\na few blue ones, but no red, yellow, company logo etc. Is there a\ntechnical reason or could it be that the marketing "geniuses" have\nnot tought about it (yet)?
Um...\n\n1) Your Professor if just plain wrong.  Although blue LEDs are one heck of\na lot less efficient than red ones.\n2) "Typical visible light LEDs" don't really exist.  LEDs have a fairly\nnarrow region of transmittence.  (Since the Fermi energy around either side\nof the band gap falls off exponentially, blah, blah...)\n\n\nYou might want to check the copyright date on that. :-)\n\nBlue LEDs most certainly do exist, I've got a bunch at work.  Cree Research\nmakes them (probably along with other companies...  Cree is big in\nmaterials science, though; they advertise in the stuff like Physics Today,\netc.).  You can buy them from JameCo (I think), DigiKey (definitely), and\nplenty of other distributors.\n\nActually, these days you _can_ get a "typical visible light" LED -- it's\ncalled a "rainbow LED", and I've forgotten who makes it (they advertise in\nEDN and many of the other trade rags, though).  It combines a reg, green,\nand blue LED all on one chip (and has four leads).  Nifty device, although\nit's probably fairly expensive.
Judging by your .sig you are trying to make some kind of game cartridge.\nInformation of how to build an EEPROM cartidge for the vectrex is available\nvia anonymous ftp at 'csus.edu'.\n\nSince you've chosen the 27C512 you are probably trying to make a 'multicart'.\nTo do this simply:\n1. Load the game images into the EEPROM at $2000, $4000, etc. (Your EEPROM\nburner software may allow this or you will have to assemble the images into\none file yourself with suitable gaps.)\n2. Wire up the cartridge with the lower address bits going to the game\nconsole, and the high bits going to switches to choose between games.\n\nTo directly answer your question above, the pin that 'kicks up the address'\nis simply another address line.
Two or three years ago I saw a report on TV about a company that had \ndeveloped a method of making solar cells on a flexible substrate.

TriQuint (Beaverton, Oregon), has been selling an 8 bit, 1 GHz D to A\nfor several years.

You can design for ramp shutoff, brick-wall current limit or even \nfold-back cutoff....sounds like you want "BRICK-WALL" current limit.\n\nYour lead is correct to pull down the bias to the series regulator base \ndrive. In order to get the brick -wall, you need enough voltage gain on \nthe current sensor.  Normally a darlington on the current sensing \nresistor will be adequate, but for infinite gain.. use an op amp to sense \nthe current releative to a stable voltage reference and use a driver to \nturn off the base bias on the series-pass transistor.  Phase compensation \nmay be necessary with this closed loop control system if yopu have more \nthan 180 degrees phase shift in your feedabck circuit at unity gain OK??

I have always thought that if I wanted to send the Police a tape with\na ransom demand on it, or send CNN a video tape to see if they wanted\nto buy it, I would place a small magnet near the take-up spool so the\ntape would be erased as it was played. Who would think to check?
Two things to watch for:\nIn Germany (and I think the same holds for Sweden) only some\nof the connections can handle tone dialing, so make sure the\nphone can be set to pulse dialing.\nIn Sweden, the '0' is the first digit and all other digits\nare pushed "down" by one position; this makes dialing (and\nin the process converting numbers) an interesting task.\nOtherwise, it is technically no problem to connect a foreign\nphone to either the German or Swedish phone system.\nOTOH neither you nor I would ever try that, as it is of course\nillegal.
The green layer is a solder-mask, and is used to make a finished board\nlook neat, and to avoid solder bridges, especially when using wave\nsoldering (or any other mechanized approach). I've seen red mask,\nbut most that I've seen are green.\n\nA bakelite board will look brown in colour, and, if the solder mask\nis put on, looks like a brown board with green 'paint' on either side\n(or just one side) of the board.\nA fibreglass board will look green from the side, because the green\nsolder-mask makes the board appear that colour. If you got a fibreglass\nboard with no mask, it would be a whitish-grey colour.\nTeflon boards do exist, as well... but I'm not sure about that one.

: \n: >What kind of power must he be putting out to cause the effects?\n: >The affected equipment is about 100 feet from the road...\n: \n: Might be a couple of hundred watts, from the sound of it.  Kicking sound\n: out of the TV and stereo speakers by direct RF rectification requires a\n: mighty strong carrier!  [I've heard of linears so powerful that\n: triggering them while the car was idling, would stall the engine by\n: pulling down the battery voltage.]\n\nIt would take a lot more than that. It sounds like the radio equipment is\nactually not shut completely off - but just goes to a standby situation.\n\nI suspect that the stories are just that, stories.  The voltage can only\nbe sucked down so far instantaneously. When you try to jumpstart someones \ncar, when your vehicle is at idle, does your car stall? No, the other car\njust does not crank well.  Now, the engine might stall because the idle\nwas too low to start with. When the extra current is drawn, the idle speed\nwill drop - as the alternator loads down the engine to compensate for the\nincreased amperage requirement.\n\n: >Is resolution of this problem a matter for the power company, the fcc, or both?\n: \n: Ultimately it's likely to be your problem to resolve, I'm afraid.  The\n: FCC is so understaffed that they don't pay much attention to citizen\n: complains about RFI (or so I've heard)... they'll just send you a\n: pamphlet describing how you can apply corrective measures.\n: \n: Talking to the power company might help - they might be able to install\n: filtering devices at your service panel (or recommend a type which you\n: could have installed by a licensed electrician).\n\nA transmitter is not going to be affecting house power. If surges are\noccurring there, it is due to another cause - not a transmitter.\n\n: Unfortunately, there's a fair chance that enough signal is being picked\n: up by your house wiring that a simple service-panel filter won't\n: suffice.  You may need to install heavy-duty RFI filters at the power\n: connections of your affected equipment.\n\nIt is probably not that much of a problem. Often - toroid coils on the\npower leads will solve that part of the interference problem. It will\nnot solve internal equipment deficiencies.\n\n: If the problem occurs regularly, you may need to "stake out" the street\n: in question, and watch for trucks or cars with big antennae driving by\n: at the time interference occurs.  If you can identify the vehicle which\n: is transmitting, you may be able to contact its owner and complain.\n\nIt is probably not the transmitter that is at fault. If the person is an\namateur, then he/she will probably be willing to help - if you explain\nthat the person is causing interference.

I have recently used the 4066 to switch a bipolar signal.  I simply\nran the 4066 off a bipolar supply, +/- 8V in this case.   As long as your\nanalog input signal stays between the supply rails, the 4066 will work fine.\nOf course, your control (logic) input must use -8V as the logic LOW and\n+8V as the logic HIGH reference, so that either (1) all your driving logic\nmust be 4000 CMOS with the same bipolar supply or (2) you must provide\nsome kind of voltage level shifting circuit between the 4066 and the\ncontrol logic.  In my case, I was able to use the bipolar supply all the\nway.

Much deleted about assembly in USA vs. other, \nI wish to focus on the subject of warm-running amplifiers:\n\n\nThere is a correclation between warm-running amps and good sound,\nor in your words, "it DOES have a bearing on....".\n\nNow, I don't suggest that everyone run out and create combination\nstove/amplifiers that will degrade lifespan,\nbut a cold-running circuit is much more suceptible to temperature\nvariation with varrying current than is a warm-running one.  And since\njunction resistance is a function of temperature, this has a detrimental\neffect on linearity.  \n\na few facts:\n-bias points vary with temperature\n-junction resist varrie with temp\n-Adcom products do NOT run class-A\n\nIf you still don't beleive this assertion, consider the warm-up requirements\nfor most good test equipment, or better yet, just listen to an amplifier\nwarm-up.  On many designs its quite audible, on mine, about 20 minutes for\nthe output stage, many hours for the drivers.  Fortunately the drivers\nare not switched.\n\nIn any experiment, or when drawing conclusions from listening,\nbetcareful to seperate the effect of device temperature from bias\n(idle current) level.  Both have a positive correlation with low\ndistortion and "good" sound quality, and high bias results in\nwarmer operation, all other factors being equal.

Yes, it is possible.  I'm making a 7 stepper controller board, \nwith 7 digital inputs, and (up to) 18 digital outputs from the // port.\n   One main thing that will tell you whether the // port is \nbi-directional or not is the bus tranceiver on it.

The status lines, pins 14, 16, 17, as well as the \nstrobe, pin 1, are bi-directional lines, and are read by base address +2, \nso for 888, to read from status, then read from 890.

We use a CD-ROM based system here.  There are about 45 CD-ROM disks and a\n4-disk changer hooked to a dedicated MS-DOS computer.  It contains scanned\nimages of data book pages for several thousand parts.  When you ask it for\nsomething it knows about (mostly active IC parts), it works quite well.\nTHey don't handle all the varieties of transistors or diodes that exist.\nIt is definately a start in the right direction, but they need to expand\nthe data base to handle more types of stuff.\n\nThese systems aren't cheap.  We paid about $7,000 for the liscence and get\nmonthly updates of some of the CD-ROM disks.  We send the old ones back to\nthem so that they will keep sending us the updates.  I think we pay a\nyearly maintainence fee of about $1,500 to get the updates.\n\nIf you find the part you want, you can look at the data sheet on a\npage-sized monitor (it's a special monitor from SigmaSystems).  You can\nalso print each page of the datasheet you want on a LaserJet printer.  Page\nprinting takes a couple of minutes per page.  It can take a while to dump\nthe 5 or 6 pages you usually need.\n\nI have a feeling the maker wouldn't like it if we made the data available\nto all Internet users.    :-)\n\n  -dave

I got mine for about 7 bucks at Radio Shack.

Another alternative is to cover the adhesive with another piece of\nduct tape then remove the tape. \n\nIf it still doesn't work, try WD-40.\nBQN
The curiosities that you speak of are EL (Electro-Luminescent) pads.  They\nare mostly used as backlights for LCD's, and as you pointed out, comes\nin several different colors.  Many of them emit white-ish colors ("true"\nwhite, and blue-whiteis-blue are the ones that I've personally encountered\nthe most often.)\n\nThey vary in their input requirements, however, they tend to operate at \nabout 100 Vrms, and at much higher than 60 Hz.  (400 Hz to 1 kHz, if I \nrecall correctly.)   You can get them to work at 120 Vrms, 60 Hz (i.e.,\nline) but they don't glow as brightly, and they will degrade much faster.\n(Oh yes, almost forgot, EL's have this tendency to wear out over time...)

With regards to what you wrote, how does one "adjust for room dynamics \nand stuff like that"?  I asked a professor that question just\nlast week and he didn't really know himself.  Since pink noise is believed\nto be due to surface states (say, the surface of the Silicon where there's\na lack of a covalent bond) that act as "traps" to nearby elecrons, and since\nthis happens at low frequencies (because at high frequencies they aren't\nable to "trap" electrons), how do you compensate for that?  It seems to me\nthat you wouldn't be able to compensate for pink noise.  I have seen the\n"pink noise" feature, however, on many EQs, and I was wondering\nhow they are suppose to compensate for noise when pink noise is not due to\n"man made noise" like power lines, crosstalks, coupling, etc.  If you have\nany information about this, it would be appreciated.  Hope this didn't sound\ntoo drawn out.  Thanx.

Back in high school I used to work for a detailing company, and one of the\nservices we offered was an engine cleaning (remove all that oil BEFORE you\nsell the car...  ;-}). Unfortunately, we did not have a high pressure\nwasher so we would use one several miles from the shop. On more than one\noccasion after washing the engine, it would not start as water would have\ngotten under the distributor (I would put a plastic bag around it to try and\nminimize this), around the spark plug wires, etc and it would be nearly\nIMPOSSIBLE to try and wipe all these areas down with a dry rag. The usual\nsolution was to carry a can of WD-40, and when the car wouldn't start to spray\nall the likely areas and it would then start on the very first time.\n\nIt may be a myth, but it certainly kept me from being stranded at a car wash...\n\n--
Maxim makes a chip that does exactly what you want. The MAX7219 drives 8\n7 segment LED displays with full decode or drives 64 discrete LED's with\na 3 wire serial interface.  The chips can also be cascaded to allow very\nlarge arrays.  I am working on a sign display using this part.\n\nI'll have to post the contact info for Maxim later, it's at home.

This is just basicly right. The connections that cannot handle touchtone dialing is very few. I would estimate a couple of percents and if you are in a bigger\ntown, there is none that cannot handle tone dialing.\nAnd regarding our swedish dialing system (a rather screwd up system), that does\njust apply to pulsdialing. Not to touchtone.\nBtw; Norway is even more interesting. They got both system! So you need different phones depending on where in the country you live.
It's possible to make boards in other colors, and I have an ad\nfor laser light-show equipment which offers the circuit boards in your\nchoice of Day-Glo (tm) colors.\n\n       The usual light green color is just the natural color of Fiberglas.\nThe dark green or blue is the solder mask layer, and I suspect that color\nis a dye.

Sorry Charlie...\n\nI have a dozen, VERY blue LED's on my bench right now. They have\na clear plastic case and when lit, are absolutely BLUE. The hue\nis sort of a "summer day cloudless sky blue" but make no mistake,\nthey are blue.\n\nYou can buy them from Digikey, Circuit Specialist, Jameco (I think),\nLED-Tronics, Stanley Optoelectronics, and others. The current price\nis around $2.50 each for small quantities. I will also be selling\nthem through my mail-order company in the near future (4 weeks).\nWrite for details if interested.

That's kind of extra work that one cannot expect the store people to do.\nIMHO it would be easier if companies sell their software as cheaply as\npossible AND to sell the customers detail manuals (for the brain-deads)\n, quick reference books, how to do books and videos, paid support hot line\n(1-900 :).  For the registered purchasers, these can be part of their package.\nI have seen many books to teach people how to use DOS, WP and other software.  I\nI suspect either users can't read the manuals or they don't have manuals.\nEither way, there is $$$ to be made.   BTW books are quite a bit more\nexpensive to reproduce than a $1 disk.\n\n\nWith the popularity of Multitasking and pseudo multitasking systems\n(eg. OS0.5, Windoze, Mack System 7), it is pretty easy to run a debugger\nand figure out the protection schemes by disassembling/tracing/trapping\nthe application during run time.  Schemes like compressed software/\nspecial loaders would be easy pray even to beginner hackers.\n\nHardware keys (unless well designed and *TOTALLY* transparent) is a\npain in the b*t.  We having using a piece of software under Windoze\nthat uses a hardware key.  The key interfers with the printer stuff\nwith other programs and often has to be unplugged for those software\nto work properly.\n\n\nAll the hacker has to do is to remove/modify code that communicate with\nthe port.

Yes, but still not a 6502 for those differences.  Same instruction set,\nof course.\n\n\n\nYes, the same number, but an entirely different device.  I should have\nqualified this further by stating that this was the PAL version of the TIA -\nI am not 100% sure that the NTSC TIA would have a different number.\n\n\nDoes anyone on the net actually have details of the TIA, as this is the only\ndevice I have not yet discovered details about?  Atari Australia, when asked,\nclaimed that their attempts to get the programmers documentation for the 2600\nhad failed, as the US head office had refused to provide it.\n\n\nI saw a couple of cheaper devices with PN2222's and a couple of resistors\nhooked up as a cheap inverter.  Nasty, but workable, and cheaper than a\n7404 inverter if labor costs almost nothing.
[stuff deleted]\n\nYou should be clear in your mind what your goal is. Two possible goals\nare (1) maximizing you income from your program, and (2) minimizing\nthe number of illegal copies which get created. Accomplishing (2)\ndoesn't usually accomplish (1).\n\nMost vendors have concluded that copy protection reduces the number of\nnormal legitimate sales by far more than it increase sales by virtue\nof changing 'copiers' to 'purchasers', and hence merely reduces\nrevenue.  Most legitimate buyers nowadays (including me) have had bad\nexperiences with copy protected products (e.g., hard to make a\nlegitimate backup, incompatabilties when new system on system upgrade,\netc.), and they won't touch them with a ten foot pole.
Most commercial switchers do NOT use magnetics for their energy storage;\nthat's handled by the big caps on the primary side, those which in a \nlinearly-regulated power supply would be considered the "filter" caps,\ncoming right after the bridge.  The transformer is just that - a \ntransformer.  It's there primarily to step the voltage up or down.  (Although\nthe inductance seen by the switch transistor on the primary side is NOT\nnegligible, as anyone who's zapped said transistor from either failing to\nget one with a high enough breakdown voltage or neglecting to include a\n"snubber" diode across it would tell you.  Actually, many transistors intended\nfor switcher use today have the diode built in.)\n\nThe basic switched-mode power supply operates something like this (in\na somewhat simplified manner):  The AC line is rectified to produce a\nhigh voltage, more-or-less unregulated DC rail.  The energy storage (or\n"filter") caps appear across this rail, as does the switching transistor.\nThe transistor chops the current into the primary side of the transformer,\nresulting in stepped-up or stepped-down pulses out the secondary, which \nare then rectified and filtered.  At least one of the transformer's outputs\nis sampled and fed back to the control circuit for the switching transistor,\nwhich acts in a "pulse-width modulation" (PWM) fashion to control (by varying\nthe pulse width) the amount of energy being dumped into the primary, and\ntherefore the voltage coming out at the secondary.  The remaining outputs\nmay be allowed to simply run at whatever value they will, more-or-less\ntracking the regulated output, or they may have some additional linear\nregulation added.  You may also note that the feedback between the \nregulated output and the PWM control (which is most typically an IC)\nis not done via a direct electrical connection; this is due to various\nsafety standards which require primary and secondary circuits to be\nelectrically isolated.  Often, the feedback path involves an optoisolator\nto meet this requirement.\n\nWhile the transformer isn't the primary energy-storage device in these\ndesigns, this does not mean that the energy stored in the transformer can\nbe ignored; besides the inductive "kick" giving the switch transistor a\nbad time (as noted above), you also need to worry about getting all the\nenergy that went *in* to the transformer back *out* again, one way or another.\nIn some designs, this happens more or less automatically - but in others,\nyou need to take special care to ensure that the transformer core doesn't\nsaturate, which again would have disastrous results (best left to the \nimagination! :-)).\n\nI'm NOT by any stretch of the imagination a power-supply designer; \nhopefully, a real one will come along soon and clean up any gross errors\nin the above.

Sorry about following up my own article, but I wanted to continue\nthat what might be being missed here is that the important thing\nmight not be temperature differences per se, but the action of\nheat sinking the battery.\n\nPerhap someone could conduct an experiment, taking two identical\nlead acid batteries, placing both on wooden shelves, but putting\none of them in a water bath designed to act as a heat sink.  This\nwould eliminate the 'concrete floor effect', and keep both batteries\nat the same ambient temperature.\n\nI think the argument over temperatures is not pertinent, but the\none over heat conductance and removing the exothermic heat may have\nsome validity.

: I'm wondering if it's possible to use radio waves to measure the\n: distance between a transmitter(s) and receiver?\n: \n: Seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength\n: and determine distance. This would be for short distances (2000 ft),\n: and I would need to have accuracy of 6 inches, or so.\n: --------------------\nYou might try looking at whats available in laser locating systems. They\nwork best for close work( 1 mile and under).\n\nRF is used for much longer distances in two major modes. Transponder and\nphase measurment. Transponder requires you send a pulse to another station\nand it returns it to you and you measure the round trip time minus the\nreceiver time.\n\nPhase measurements require two or more transmitting stations sending the\nsame frequency signal multiplexed in time. A receiver can pick them up and\nmeasure the phase shift between signals. Maps can be drawn that plot the\nLines of Position that correspond to a certain phase shift between two\nstations.
I've been wondering about this myself.  The house wiring thing is really\nhokey.  There is no doubt that high pressure ultrasound is annoying, but to\nwhom?

Could there\nbe that much selectivity in frequencies?  Have there been ANY studies\non the effects of various pressure levels, bands, and sweep patterns on\nvarious life forms?\n\nAnd how effective could they be?  I certainly would not want to tell anyone\nthat they are safe from nasty dogs because they were carrying a piezoelectric\nbuzzer...

Probably, but the point is THE COMPANY make the registration patch, NOT\nYOU.  Sure, you can probably find another registerred user and compare notes,\nbut WHY?  It's not hindering you in any way unless you are just hacking.\n[Problem about people who cut TOO MUCH from quoting...]\n\n\nNothing, but if you read my WHOLE suggestion, I'm saying that you register\nvia MAIL by mailing in your registration card, THEN the company send you\nthe patch which includes the info you put on the registration card.
Greetings. There are 3 types of warnings on (US) tapes:\n\n	1) A hologram is glued across the seam of the 2 halves of the\n	   tape. The message usually reads, "If seal is broken, you must\n	   buy this tape"\n\n	2) The standard "MacroVision" warning, "Copies of this tape will\n	   be unviewable"\n\n	3) [your case] Extended message for the Average Consumer (tm) which\n	   states that even attempting to copy the tape will destroy the\n	   original. I don't believe you can sue them for misinformation\n	   in cases like this :-)\n\n	Take care.\n\n	P.S. Of course, #3 is utter BS - but the Average Consumer (tm)\n	     believes it. Heck, my mom once returned such a tape without\n	     watching it... she was afraid that something might just \n	     happen :-)
For those who would like to know, the 6507 was a 6502 without IRQ or NMI,\nand with only 13 address lines (giving 8K memory space).\n\n\nDidn't know about it being called the 6526 - thats the CIA found in the\nCommodore 64 (I don't believe this chip existed when the 2600 was around).\nThe TIA was mapped into the bottom 128 bytes of page 0, and shadowed in the\nbottom 128 bytes of page 1. To get an image on the screen, you had to wait\nuntil the raster line your picture started at, load bitmaps for this line\ninto the 'sprite' registers, tell them what x positions to take, how many\nduplicates you wanted, etc, then do it all again for the next line. This\ntook all of the processor's time during the visible portion of the\ndisplay.\n\n\nThe RAM was mapped into the top 128 bytes of page 0, and shadowed in page\n1. The 6502 has a zero-page addressing mode on most instructions that is\nboth shorter and faster than the normal ones, so it is important on a\nmachine like this to have the scratchpad RAM in page 0. Unfortunately, it\nalso wants its stack to be in page 1 (the stack pointer is 8 bits, and the\nhigh byte of the address is hardwired to 1).\n\nThe IOT section was mapped into page 2 somewhere. 2 8 bit I/O registers\n(can't remember if each bit could be independantly set to I or O like the\n6522 and 6526), and 1(?) 8(?) bit timer with a programmable prescaler (I\nthink this was some power of 2). There were no interrupts in the system, so\nmany games would set up the timer at some known time, go away and do\nsomething else for a while, then sit and wait for the timer to run down.\n\nThere was no logic in the box to do address decoding - the RIOT had at\nleast 2 chip select pins (probably one active high, one active low), and I\nimagine the TIA was much the same. Various address lines were fed directly\nto chip selects. The 6507 likes to have ROM right at the top of memory, so\nthe 2600 had to use ROMs with active high chip selects - not exactly\nnormal, so some cartriges had a 7404 in them to convert this to the more\nusual active low chip select.

Acetone will likely damage the carpet. First solvent to try is denatured\nalcohol. Do not waste your time with rubbing alcohol. You can use methyl\nalcohol instead of denatured alcohol. If you want to have a cocktail while\nyou are removing the goo, use pure grain alcohol :-). If the alcohol does\nnot work try carbon tetrachloride. If neither of these work you may need to\ntry a stronger solvent, but the alcohol works for most adhesives. Good luck.
I didn't catch your posting one year ago, but I presume you like to leave out\nan extra a-latch ? (I presume you allready know there is a '573 but that couldnt\nbe the question, could it ? ;-)\n\nDuring my student-trainee project, I discouvered a nice device, it's a PSD301  \nfrom Waferscale Integration. In one single (44 PLCC I think it was) package\nit contained: ROM, RAM, I/O lines and a programmable addressdecoder...\n\nAs far as I can recall, it can be hooked directly with a MCS-51 series uP ... \nNeat huh ? But it needs programming before assembly, so it wasn't suitable\nfor my project. Perhaps usefull for you (future) plans ?
Probably won't help.  I'd be willing to bet that _every_ manufacturer\nused those little self-contained modules.  I think Sharp made them.\nRadio Shack used to sell them for a few bucks (maybe they still do.)\n\nThe module had 3 leads:  power, ground and demodulated output.  It\ncontained the photo-detector, amplifier, integrator and demodulator\nall in a tiny metal can.\n\nIf you want to buy one, try Radio Shack, or else a TV repair shop can\nprobably order one.  BTW - the carrier frequency is 40 KHz, and each\ndifferent TV/VCR/cable box/stereo manufacturer uses a unique pulse\nscheme to perform each different function on their equipment.

Greetings. I've recently decided to chuck the linear regulators\n	and learn the "black magic" art of switching power supplies...\n	(before anyone flames me, I KNOW, both have their place :-)\n\n	Anyways, I've built the basic up & down converters with pretty\n	good results (>80% efficiency) but I'm running into problems\n	when I try to design & build anything that puts out serious\n	amps... I know it can be done (I have some 5V@200A guts on my\n	bench) but something puzzles me: I'm using a simple choke as \n	the storage element (basicly a toroid with a single winding)\n	but ALL commercial models use transformers with MANY windings.\n	I traced a few and they seem to use some of the winding for\n	the usual error/feedback but some of the others seem to loose\n	me... What are they for? Better than that, anyone have a full\n	schematic for one of these that I could get a copy of? I'd\n	love to see how they manage to squeeze out so much from such\n	low volume :-)\n\n	My other problems (in getting high amps & good efficiency) are\n	1) Lack of sources of ideal components (calculated) and 2)\n	Limited knowledge of the whole topic... I'm doing this on my\n	own (not school) mind you (in fact, I have yet to take any\n	course that covers transistors ;-)\n\n	So, is the answer to #1 the accumulation of dead commercial\n	models and truning into a scavanger (not that it's not what\n	I'm doing now...) and #2 getting & understanding schematics\n	and a bit more of the [mind-boggling] theory? \n\n	Take care.\n\n	P.S. My goal is 12V @ ~25A in (car battery) -> 250VAC out and\n	(on the other end) 250V -> +5VDC @ 5A, -5V @ 1A, +12VDC @8A\n	and -12VDC @1A... the distance between the two will be\n	more than 100 feet (of 14-16 gauge) but less than 300 feet.\n	Would like to have a working model in a year or so... :-) \n	(Do I have a chance to make it?)
Assuming you are refering to standard POTS or ground start lines:\n\nIf you are looking at loop start lines under idle conditions, the RING\nconductor is the one with approximately -48 to -52 vDC with respect to\nground while the TIP conductor is at or very near ground potential (be sure\nto reference the telco ground when taking your measurements).  \n\nIf you are dealing with ground start lines under idle conditions, the RING\nconductor will be the one with approximately -48 to -52 vDC while the TIP\nconductor would look like it's floating (you may see some potential from\nline capacitance it will bleed off over time).  Remember to use the telco\nground as your reference when making measurements.
Just thought I would add $0.02 to DeskJet thread. I got my\nfirst one in college about 5 or so years ago.\n\n	I've been a happy HP user of the DeskWriter for Macintosh for\npast 5 years. I got one just a few months after their release. And I\ngot software revision 1.0a (now I'm up to rev. 3.1. Our family (sister\nand father) have each purchased their own DW's after seeing mine go\nfor one year unscathed (their stuck to their trusty ImageWriter II's).\nThe original DW has gone for 5 years at moderate personal use. I would\nsay that it has gone through at least 15,000 sheets, and around one\n(small) ink cartridge every 3 months or so.\n\n	My brother might take this DW now (I'm probably gonna give it\nto him), and I am looking to upgrade to a color DW. The chief\nadvantages/disadvantages I've found over the years are:\n\nAdvantages:	Quick (2-3 ppm), Quiet (roomate can sleep while it's\nprinting), AppleTalk Networkable (unfortunately the original wasn't,\nso look out if you buy used. I rewired our home with phonenet\nAppleTalk connectors, and while home, we can all use my dad's one\nDW!), and cheap (now run ~$300). BTW, you can upgrade older DW's to\ncolor or for appletalk, I dunno if HP still does the upgrades, but I\nreceived many offers (I just didn't ned it however). Also, crisp\nlaser-quality output is a wonder (used to really impress those\nImageWriter Dot-Matrix people so much so, that I had to charge $0.25\nper sheet to stop my college dorm neighbors from bothering me at all\nhours of the night....)\n\nDisadvantages.	Ink used to be hard to find, and wasn't cheap, and\nwasn't originally water-proof. While HP has done wonders with the ink\n(I dunno if it's still toxic), it is still subjet to smearing and\nrunning (if you run around in the damp Boston rain, and get your\nbookbag completely soaked). Ink now runs about $14-$15 for small carts\n(I get mine from Elek-Tek in Chicago, I think they're now down to\n$12). The ink carts used to say they're dated for only 6 months, but\nI don't think they say so anymore. We stick to a 4 month supply (of\nabout 3 carts). We use cheap Hammerhill Laser Print paper (after\nfooling for a long time. Laser/Xerox paper is also good). Smearing\ndoesn't happen, unless you have a brand new ink cart and you grab the\npaper and smudge it all over as soon as it comes out of the machine.\nOther disadvantages are : No Postscript (this can be an advantage in\nspeed, usually). Ways around this are Ghostscript or Freedom of Press\nsoftware solutions. I bet HP probably has a PS prototype inkjet, but\nthey won't release it for fear of hurting LJ sales.\n\nIn the end, the primary advantages of laser are true postscript\n(unless you go for cheap lasers), and fused toner (no smearing, even\nwhen soaking in water). Lasers are slightly sharper, but the only\ninstance where I needed precise layouts was Printed Circuit Board\nTransparencies for PhotoEtching. I found a Textronix color Phaser\nPostscript (Thermal Wax Transfer) to work the best to make PCB\nnegatives directly onto a transparency.
:   Why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead (totally unuseable)\n: when stored on a concrete floor?  \n\nIt could be that you stored it somewhere that it could become covered\nby moisture or damp air, which would short out the terminals.\n\nThe same thing happens to my car (Citroen 2CV) -- damp gets under the\nbonnet (US: "hood") and shorts the spark-plugs to earth so it won't start.\n\nThe solution (for the car) is to clean the plug leads and spray with\nWD-40 (moisture repellant).  If damp *is* the problem, then storing the \nbattery off the ground may help.  I'm not sure if spraying with WD-40\nwould be safe since it is very flammable (high percentage petroleum).\n\nJust a thought...\n\nChris
WHen trying to choose a resistor with a tolerance better than 1%, you \nneed a trimmer or to screen devices, it can't be made from adding 2 \nresitors of 1% value in parallel, since the smaller device will have the \nerror of 1% to cope with. \nYou have 3 choices;\na) live with the error of 1% tolerance devices for low Q circuits or low \nsensitivity designs\nb) buy resistors with better than 1% tolerance (Vishay/Dale)\nc) use trimmers or SOT's (Select-On-Test)

They are real, and we still pay licence fees to receive TV.\nThe detector vans pick up the IF, true. This tells them what channel you\nare watching. The can also pick up the line time base freq, and frame rate\n(Try it with a LW/MW radio near telly, it picks up a sharp hum)\n\nFrom this they can even watch (poor quality though) what *you* have on the\nscreen, by picking up re radiating junk.

What I usually use...and this stuff is only good on glass....is either Acetone,\nor a little Benzene. The latter of the two is a bit dangerous (possibly a \ncarcinogen(sp?)) but it usualy gets the job done. I imagine you can you the two\nsolvents on most metals as well as glass, but keep the stuff away from plastic.\nBetter yet, you may just want to go to your local hardware store and ask them\nwhat they use.

There are a number of inaccuracies here:\n1) In fact, a colder battery will self-discharge more slowly.  This is why\n   batteries should be stored in a COOL, dry place.\n2) An battery placed on concrete does not become colder than one placed\n   on wood.  The battery, the wood, and the concrete will all be at the\n   same general temperature (ignoring temperature fluctuations) and thus\n   none will effect the other.\n\n\nThere is no need to 'exercise' the battery.  Just keep it charged.  (A trickle\ncharger will do the job.)

It's in\nthe >BIOS, and if software had told me "this isn't the machine you\ninstalled me >on" I would never have used that software again.  Really bad\nidea. \n\nRAM is something you add all the time, so no.  It's more like BIOS\nmanufacturer and/or processor type (386/486/etc).  Data cannot be used,\nesp with these new Flash ROM BIOS machines with updates on a diskette.\n\nOn the other hand, to make this LESS intrusive it could be disguised as\n"Please Insert Original Disk #XX as I need file YYYYYY for update".  :-) \nIt would be perfectly reasonable...  Sort of.\n\nuser's >> conscience should do that. \n\ngive >them that.  Your scheme isn't going to stop anyone. \n\nOf course it is easier.

And\nthere is very >little that commpanies can do to stop this type of thing. \nUsing PKLITE or >some similar utility would help, but only if the\nresulting compressed .EXE >were tagged as uncompressable. \n\nI know x86 and 680x0 assembly quite well, thank you.  I know exactly which\ntwo bytes need to be changed, I have the code to do them too.  I just said\n"Don't ask me which ones."  I didn't say I don't know what that means.\n\nSuch hacking can be EASILY discouraged by adding anti-patching code which\ndoes a self-check upon execution and refuse to load if CRC does not match\nvalue stored (encrypted, of course) in the program.  It could be claimed\nas a part of anti-virus code, and it would not be far from the truth. \n\na special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup\nabove. \n\n\nDid ANYONE read what I wrote?

The manufacturer will then supply the\nthen-proven-legitimate-user with a patch that will disable the restriction\nand PROUDLY PROCLAIM the legal copy with the "Registered to XXX" screen.\n\n\nOf course they will, but that was NOT my point.  The purpose of copy\nprotection is to discourage casual pirates ("Oh, can I have a copy of\nthat?"/"Sure, here.") and the less sophisticated pirates ("Let's look for\nall those calls to INT13H...") .  Any one determined enough to break copy\nprotection can and will succeed.  They can always backtrace the entire\nload-sequence of the program.  The point of copy protection is to make\nsuch attempts take as long as possible while not intruding upon the uses\n(or to minimize such intrusion) of legitimate use.  Pirates who see copy\nprotection as a challenge love breaking them, and no amount of copy\nprotection will stop them, but the rest of us WILL be stopped.  How many\nof these hardcore pirates are there compared to rest of us?  Not that many.

The lead-acid secondary cell releases energy (electricity) with the following\nchemical reaction:\n \nPb + PbO2 + 2H2SO4 --> 2PbSO4 + 2H20\n \nLead and Lead (IV) Oxide and Sulfuric Acid produce Lead Sulfate and Water\n \nThe standard heats of formation at 25 C (77 F) of the various compounds are:\n \n              Heat of formation\nCompound      at 25 C, kcal/mole\n--------      ------------------\n   Pb               0.00\n  PbO2            -65.0\n H2SO4           -193.69\n PbSO4           -218.5\n  H20             -68.3174\n \nThe heat of reaction at 25 C is therefore -60.6 kcal per mole PbSO4 produced.\nNote that lead sulfate is not very soluble (0.0048 grams per 100 grams water\nat 25 C), and it will thus precipitate out of solution where the reaction is\noccurring, or the cathode (positive terminal) of the battery.  (I am almost\nsure it is the positive terminal where the precipitate forms, but I may be\nwrong.  Oh well, I don't have a corroded battery to corrobate, and I don't feel\nlike thinking through it right now.)\n \nWhat is important to notice here is that the reaction, as you knew it would be,\nis exothermic, or energy discharging.  If moisture with dissolved electrolytes\n(acid rain) condenses on the battery, a conductive path between the terminals\nmay form.  This will discharge the battery as the chemical reaction proceeds.\nThe reaction is reversible, if electricity (from an alternator or battery\ncharger) is put back into the battery.\n \nLead-acid batteries must change in chemical composition to discharge.  Each\ncell has all the reactants necessary for the reaction.  The non-reacting posts\n(terminals) of the lead-acid battery are there to remove (or add) electric\nenergy during a discharge (or charge).  Because the reaction is exothermic, it\nhas a tendency to happen, though quite slowly under normal circumstances.  So\nwhile keeping the battery dry is a good idea, it is not a total solution.\n \nTo understand why lead-acid batteries DO INDEED discharge faster when stored on\nconcrete as opposed to wood or earth (dirt), one should recall LeChatelier's\nPrinciple, which can be paraphrased as:  anything subjected to some stress will\nact to move to a more comfortable position.

The thermal conductivity\nof concrete is around a factor of 10 greater than that of dirt, and is 2-4\ntimes greater than wood.\n \nIt is these differences in thermal conductivity that cause the battery on\nconcrete to discharge faster than that on dirt or wood.  At any instant the\ndischarge reaction is occurring, energy is being released, either as electricity\nor heat.  (Thermal conductivity of air is about 0.015 BTU/(hr-ft-ft)(F/ft).)\nDuring storage, except for the trickle that passes through any condensate on\nthe battery, this energy is mostly released as heat.  The higher conductivity\nsurface will remove the heat proportionately faster than the lower conductivity\nsurface.  Thus, if you perfectly insulated a dry battery on all but the bottom\nsurface, at any given battery temperature above the storage surface temperature,\nthe battery on a concrete surface will be discharging about 10 times faster\nthan that on dirt.\n \nThis is where LeChatelier's principle comes into play.  Removing energy from\nthe exothermic reaction will drive the reaction further to completion.  If the\nreaction normally occurs at room temperature, keeping the battery at that\ntemperature requires the removal of any heat produced.  A concrete surface is\na better heat sink than a dirt or wood surface.  Store a battery in the corner\nof a poured concrete basement, and you have 3 surfaces removing energy, which\n"pulls" the reaction along.\n \nAlso, if water evaporates from the battery, that elevates the ratio of sulfuric\nacid to water.  This will tend to drive the discharge reaction.\n \nJeff White      jhwhit01@ulkyvx.louisville.edu
Jeez, that should do it.\n\n\nVery interesting application, controlled lighting and environment, moderate\ndistances ... might be more interesting than my application.  Just a thought,\nyou could use a roof mounted IR sender, similar in operation to a TV remote\ncontrol that tells each persons coded IR pulser to send a pulse.  A Hamamatsu\ndetector, as was mentioned in a previous message in this thread, would give\nthe current position.  Store and collate this on a computer and you could\nreplay the movements on the screen.  Interesting!\n\n--
Well, actually not quite. Both Radar and Radio-Altimeters measure distances\nby measuring the time required to transmit a signal, then receive its\nreflection from a target. Radar generally uses pulses, while Radio Altimeters\nuse either pulses or a modulated continuous-wave transmission. In the case of\nthe latter, highly accurate distance measurement can be made. As an example,\nthe original Bendix ALA-52 Radio Altimeter was accurate to 1/8 foot at 2500\nfeet altitude.\n\nNote, however that this is a different method of measuring than the poster\noriginally asked about. The problem with gaining accurate measurements between\na transmitter and a seperate receiver is that you need a highly accurate\ntime base which starts at the receiver at the exact instant the transmitter\ntriggers. This cannot be wire connected, since radio waves will actually\ntravel faster in free-space (air, in this case) than wire (the difference\nis called the velocity factor of the cable). So you need to resort to a\ncommon timebase that is automatically corrected for distance, etc. Something\nlike a PLL connected to a GPS receiver should do the trick, triggering both\nthe transmitter and receiver simultaneously. Sound expensive? Not too bad,\nbut plan on spending a few bucks in both equipment and effort.\n\nWhy not go to a different method? Surveyors use a laser-light system where again\nthe reflection time is measured. Why not try this? (Sounds like something a P.E.\nshould know about anyway ;-).\n\n\nThis is actually highly inaccurate, since the power output of a transmitter\nvaries from unit to unit, there are variances in the antenna and transmission\nline, and the receiver may also vary, both from unit to unit, and the same unit\nover time. You would need to continuously calibrate the entire system. With\nthe radio altimeter this is also done, but since everything is located at\none place, it is much easier to do. Note especially that the time base for\nthe R.A. receiver and transmitter is one unit also...\n\n\nNope. FM capture effect says that the strongest signal wins. That is, unless\nthe two interfering signals are seperated by more than 3 db in signal strength.\nThis is the one problem that makes altimeters inaccurate at very low altitudes.\nSignals bouncing off runways tend to be VERY strong...\n\n\nAs high as possible to eliminate outside influence, and also to enhance\nattenuation of multipath signals. Radio Altimeters typically use frequencies\naround 4 GHz.\n\nHope this helps...
I strongly disagree. I think most pirating is done by amateurs, who won't\ncopy the program if "diskcopy" can't do it.\nIf you're talking a 20% max goal of pirated copies, I bet that anything that\nwill beat diskcopy, and can't be easily copied from a hard drive, will\nsuffice.\nI hate hard copy manuals, and would rather have all docs online - *not*\nbecause I want to copy the program, but because its usually faster and\nand convenient than sifting through an old book I can't find.\n\nOff deeper end-> Why does everyone think they need to be able to make a \nbackup copy? Almost all new software must be installed to the hard disk,\nso you are left with the originals as your backups. I think its a waste\nof time, space, and money, as well as it makes it to tempting to "lend"\nout the backups. \n\n\nNo flames intended - just my thoughts.
Hello, I'm looking for information on Alphanumeric pagers \nand *how* the data is sent from the paging transmitter and how \nI would go about building a device to decode the paging data \n(like my pager does) and feed it though an RS232 port.\n    I'm planning on seperating different paging messages and \ndifferent pagers in software to keep amount of hardware I need \ndown....  Does anyone know what chips (Motorola?) are good for \ndecoding Numeric and Alphanumeric paging data (and then stuffing\nit down an RS232 port (basically any baud rate is fine!) ? \n    (I already have a radio reciever with headphone level \noutput for the audio signal from the paging tower, but I'd be \ninterested in anything you know about pagers, including the \ntype of radio recievers they use!)\n    Thanks in advance!            \n-theo\nEMAIL = theo@walt.caps.maine.edu
This topic was beaten to death a year or so ago.\n\nThe concrete is not the problem. \n\nLead-acid batteries often fail from disuse (not being charged for a long\ntime), but there's no way the concrete floor could be the cause of the\nproblem.
: : bit of it, you could take the tape over to a local ham operator's house\n: : and ask him for his opinion of what you're hearing.  Most communities\n: \n: You cannot do that legally. However, you can ask a ham over to listen.\n: If the interference occurs at a specific time each day, then it would\n: be possible to do such scheduling.  If nothing else, you could invite\n: the ham over to transmit from your driveway, to see if he interferes.\n: If he does, then you probably need to have your equipment worked on to\n: make it immune to rf interference.\n\nAs a coupld of people have pointed out - this is wrong. It is not illegal\nto record or disclose what you heard on the Ham bands.
I hate to disagree, but I will. :)\n(note: I don't pirate software, nor do I trade it. I simply have met and\ntalked extensively with those who have. that's it. the FBI can tap someone\nelse's phone :)\nMost pirating is done by people who don't use the programs they pirate.\nA cracked program tends to get passed on, resplendant in the various graphics\nand animations that advertise whoever performed the modification(s).\n\nI admit that a large portion of the business world is involved in 'giving'\ncopies of programs to one's fellow workers, maybe taking it home for use\non one's own PC, but such trading tends to be interdepartmental or at most\nspread throughout the business as a whole- how many times have you had\nsomeone walking from business to business letting people copy disks?\n\nIt's mostly a matter of convenience: a person sees a program they want to\nuse and they feel justified in making a copy since "someone's already paid\nfor it", etc., etc. (A note: this is starting to change a bit. not much\nthough.)\n\n\nwhat about commercially available copy programs? CopyII?\nhow about programs like teledisk, that can do things diskcopy can't?\nand before anyone disputes this because they feel that those who would copy\nwouldn't know about this:\n  after working with people around computers, one comes to realize that\nthe 'average' user doesn't know much. Any computer enthusiast is at least\n200x better at pre-guessing commands and how to use them (can *you* sit down\nand use something without reading the manual?) and it is these people who\nare doing the '20% pirating', not Joe Windows User who can't remember a few\narguments to the dir command.\n\n\nreally? I find it evens out- the online stuff can be read through faster,\nbut you're stuck reading it in linear flow: start to finish, unless you\njump ahead with a search or such. A book, though, you can flip through\nfaster than you can read text on a screen and they usually have a nifty\nindex too!\n\nBut I partially agree: I often wish I could grep something that was written\ndown.\n\n\nwhat if they need to re-install? The idea of a backup still holds- if\nthe original disk goes bad, they're out of luck for about 1-2 weeks, which\nis the usual turn around time for a company to send a new set of disks-\nif they'll do it without a charge.
Hmmm...\n  A possibility for the software registration conondrum would be to have the\ndistributor register the copy when the software was sold.  The clerk sticks it\nin the store PC and asks for the buyers ID. Later, if pirated versions showed up they could be tracked to the original purchaser. In addition copies which were\nsent to distributors/stores would have a vendor reg # or serial # in order to\ntrack in store piracy.\n\nPossible additional program security schemes would be:\n1. having monthly password changes which necessitate user call in\n   and registration. (inconvenient)\n2. taking dire legal action on anyone caught (expensive)\n3. encryption, crc check, self modifying code (limited effectiveness)\n4. have an independent watchdog program in the installation/setup config or\n   memory manager, etc. which would check the main program's crc. \n   (only as effective as above methods at best.)\n5. have the above watchdog circulating as a virus which would trash cracked \n   copies of the program and/or the offenders hard drive. (risky, and probably\n   illegal, certainly immoral)\n\nmy new ideas aren't terribly feasible to implement as presented, but I thought\nif I threw them out people could think of variations that might be effective.\nWhat is the problem with parallel port security keys? I haven't used anything\nthat had hardware key copy protection schemes, so I don't know what the\ndrawbacks are. I know the companies that make them claim they're uncrackable,\nbut I've seen cracks of AutoDesk 3d-studio floating around (I don't have one\nso don't ask) and I had heard that it had parralel port keys.
Typical (in the old 2x-oversampling units) was a thirteen-tap\nFIR, implemented as a dedicated hardware addition circuit.  At this kind\nof speed (slow, by digital standards) such an adder is much less\nexpensive than analog components of comparable precision.\n\n	I gleaned this information from a hardware manual for\nan old CD player design; where one would find similar info for\na particular CD (the digital filter IS an interesting component,\nfrom my point of view), I have no idea.  The digital filter\nis a kind of interpolation scheme (read a book on numerical \nanalysis, to see just how BROAD the term 'interpolation' is...),
The simplest and cheapest soft UV bulb is an AR-1 argon bulb (or other argon\nbulb).  It works like a neon bulb except it glows purple.  It will cause\nstuff to fluoresce.  It requires very little power, just a battery, an\noscillator, and a step-up transformer to about 100 volts.
It is also much easier to scribble corrections on a hard-copy manual.
This definately gets the car going, but... WD-40 is highly flammable. Explosive\neven in the right conditions, like a vapour sealed inside a distributor for\neg. And contact points tend to arc a tiny bit :)
In order to emit blue light, a semiconductor must have a band gap energy\nwithin the region of 2.6 to 2.8 electron Volts. According to my physical\nelectronics prof, you can't get an LED with that band gap. That's why you\ndon't find blue LEDs or, for that matter, some other colour of LEDs. That\nis not to say that blue LEDs can't be found.  I've seen 'blue' LEDs sold,\nbut they were just your typical visible light LED in a blue plastic covering.\nThey didn't emit very much light...\n\nSource: Solid State Electronic Devices (Ben G.

I am not quite so sure about the illegality of using a regular American phone\non your home system. I vaguely remember a few years ago, when "Deutsche\nBundespost" split into Postdienst, Postbank, and Telekom there was some\ndiscussion about a new regulation. I know that cordless or cellular phones\nstill have to be approved by the Telekom, but does that hold true for regular\nphones? In my areacode in Germany (2234 - Frechen, near Koeln) you can use\ntouch-tone dialing. I assume, however, that most areas are still exclusively\nset to pulse dialing. Last time I checked (Jan '93) the Cologne areacode 221\nwas still solely pulse dialing.\n\nBTW, touch tone does become more common in Germany, bringin with it the\nflourishing of 1-900 services (in Germany 0190).

Gee, how about an (ahem) "accelerometer"! Such devices are available from\na variety of sources (one that comes to mind is Bruel & Kjaer if you have\na lot of money to spend). MOst of these sorts of devices output a voltage\nproportional to acceleration. You need to know what range you're talking\nabout though.
Just MHO, but I prefer hardcopy books because you can have three or four  \nof them open spread across the bed (next to the desk in my dorm) and  \nreference them while using the program full-screen.  The Windows Help  \nthings come closest to good on-line documentation I've seen, but they  \ngenerally aren't detailed enough and would probably take a LARGE amount of  \nspace (even compressed) which is at a premium on my system . . ..  In  \nfact, the manuals are the primary reason I bought Borland's C++ compiler  \ninstead of using the one the lab licensed (in the lab, of course).  I've  \ngot a SHELF full of books to help me out when I'm stuck.  :-)   To each  \nhis own . . . :-)\n\n\nWe've destroyed about six sets of original Microsoft Word for Mac 5.0 and  \nWord for Windows (may have been a bad batch of disks).  Don't have the  \nfaintest idea what happened to them, they just went bad.  Weren't stored  \nnear any magnetic fields or otherwise mistreated, indeed they were only  \nused once.  Given this, and the massive headaches finding a working set of  \ndisks to fix some of the machines that periodically go down, I'd say  \nhaving working backups is a godsend.  I sure wish we'd had them (Sometimes  \nI think Murphy's Law holds true more often than Newton's!!) when we needed  \nthem.  I think it's sortof like snake antivenin.  99.995% of the time you  \nhave absolutely no use for it, but when you need it, BOY do you ever need  \nit!\n\nI don't have backups of my originals at "home" but then my machine doesn't  \nsee anywhere NEAR the use/abuse of these here at the lab, and so I  \nconsider it less of a risk.  Still, I usually make "working copies" of  \nthem when I install them and then eventually re-use these "working copies"  \nfor something else. . ..\n\n\n\nJust mine, too!  :-)\n\nBTW, before anyone notices my mentioning "copying" programs from machine  \nto machine when we do installs here and wonders about the licensing, the  \nupper-management (non-student staff, of course) are METICULOUS in checking  \nwith providers of the software and making SURE we are sticking to the  \nlicense agreements . . ..
I would also be interested in the application here.  I work with a Dance and\n   Technology program, and want to build something to track dancers on a 30 foot\n   wide stage from 50 feet away.\n\n\nCould make for some interesting choreography... light and sound could be \ncontrolled directly by the position of a dancer on stage, or by the number\nof dancers on stage. Neat.\n\nYou could even build a spotlight that follows the dancer around on stage!\n\nCan you tell us more about what you're doing? Sounds like a very cool program.
I'm wondering if I can tote my American touch tone phone around with me\nto Sweden and Germany.  It's DC powered, and I can buy a special adapter\nfor that in Europe.  The question is if the general electronics work\nthe same.  I can buy a different wall plug and refit it (I'm sure I'd\nhave to), but would that do the trick?

I think it's because the lead gets coated with lead oxide if the battery is\nnot being charged or discharged. I remember some advice from an ancient car\nmanual guide my father had, which was to use car batteries to power a garage\nclock or something similar when they're not in a car. This is supposed to \nprevent the oxidation but I've no idea if it really works. The concrete floor\nconnection is a red herring.\n\n\nThis may contribute to discharging but would be reversible.\n \n\nWell, this is off-topic, but back in the days when I used to drive bangers\nI never found WD-40 to do anything that wiping with a dry cloth did'nt do.\nI think the effectiveness of WD-40 is a myth invented by the guy who owns\nthe company.

Yes, it does.\nAll the equipment has to have that Telekom approval number to be\nlegal.\nWhat has changed is that you can buy the equipment somewhere else.\nI'm pretty sure the same holds true in Sweden (at least when I read\nsome information on it about tweo years ago).\nAnd BTW I do know that most of the lines in Sweden can handle tone-dialing,\njust don't be sure that all can.

:   I have seen the existance of electronics solder with a 2% silver\n: content that seems to have good wetting and fatique reatings.\n:   Can anyone tell me why it is not used? (silver is not such an expensive\n: metal).\n: \n: \n: Andy\n: \n\nFor the most part, silver-solder is not used for general soldering\ntasks due to the mechanism of dendritic growth. Silver-solder, when\nexposed to high humidity and placed in an electric field, will actually\ngrow dendrites which are conductive and will adventually electrically\nshort across closely spaced nodes which are creating the field. For this \nreason, silver is allowed only in hermetically sealed assemblies.\nFortunatly, tin-lead solder is quite stable and will not grow dendrites\nas fast as silver-solder. Therefore, it is used extensively.\n\n \nJerry Long

Well, the fastest, crudest mixer (aside from just physically connecting\nall your inputs together directly) is to run each signal through a \nresistor to a common output.  The resistors give some isolation so the\nsignal sources aren't driving directly into each other. \n\nTaking a wild, seat-of-the-pants guess, I'd say that if you are mixing\nhigh-impedance sources like some dynamic mikes, electric guitar pickups,\netc., your resistors ought to be maybe 5K - 10K or so.  If you are mixing\nline-level stuff or the outputs of a Walkman, or such, I'd go with 1K.\n\ninput 1 --/\/\/\/ -------------+--- output\n                               |\ninput 2 --/\/\/\/\-------------+\n                               |\ninput 3 --/\/\/\/\-------------+

: One not-so-quick question to throw out there for you guys...\n\n: For our class project, we need to design and build a power supply\n: to the following specs:\n\n: Voltatge:  adjustable from 1-12V\n: Current:   *limited* at 1A\n\n: Voltage must stay within 2% of designated value for I from 0-1A\n: AC ripple less than 5 mV (rms)\n\nTo decide which kind of circuit you must know the initialprecission of\nthe limiter-current and the allowed temp-drift.\n\nIn the first case, you can use a Ube of a transistor as a voltage-reference\nof about 0.7 VDC with a temp-drift of 2mV/K. In the second case its better\nyou use a bandgap-ref and a opamp-circuit to detect the maximum-current.\nThe output of this opamp controlls the outputstage to limit the current.

Thus the heats of formation of\nPbSO4 and H2SO4 are for the most part irrelevant.\n\n\nAs it turns out the reaction is indeed exothermic (heat producing).\n(More about this later.)\n\nWhat actually happens to make the battery completely useless is this:\n(we're talking lead-acid batteries of course)\nThe battery slowly self discharges.  As this discharge takes place two things\nhappen. -The level of Pb++ ions in the acid solution increases (i.e. the lead\n           and lead oxide plates are dissolved).\n        -The level of H30+ ions in the acid solution decreases (i.e. the solution\n           becomes less acidic, or more like water if you like).\nNow, as the post to which I am responding correctly stated, PbSO4 will precipitate\nin a WATER (non-acid) solution.  When the battery dies (i.e. is fully discharged)\nwe end up with a high concentration of Pb++ and SO4-- in water.  So PbSO4\nforms in the solution and FALLS TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BATTERY (of course this\nhappens in varying degrees, the more discharged, the more precipitate forms).\n\nThe precipitate forms a conductive layer on the bottom of the battery.  If\nthere is enough of the lead and lead oxide plates left to touch the precipitate\n(more common in a newer battery) a dead short results.\n\nI have seen products in automotive shops to correct this condition, but they\nare for the most part useless.  They can dissolve the PbSO4 but cannot restore\nthe lead and lead oxide plates properly.  You may have some success with\nthese products for a newer battery.\n\n[stuff deleted]\n[stuff deleted]\n\nThis stuff is just made up by the author and is completely invalid.\nIn fact the discharge reaction takes place at a higher rate at higher\ntemperatures.  A logical consequence of the above argument is this:\n"If you really want your car to start, lower the battery temperature to\n -50 to 'pull' the reaction along."  We all know from experience (at\n least those of us in Canada do (it gets cold up here)) that this is\nnot true.  If we want to start our car on a really cold day we warm\nthe battery.\n\n(Besides which, there is not enough energy released through self discharge\n to appreciably raise the temperature.  The air would amply dissipate any\n such heat, whether the bottom of the battery was insulated or not.  This\n is of course irrelevant, since you would WANT the battery to be cool\n during storage.)
Marvin Minsky (hi there) writes of building "perceptrons?" in the 1950s using\nmotor-driven potentiometers to vary the weights. He reported that the circuits\nworked even tho there were wiring errors. (Can you say ROBUST?)\n\nCadium Sulfide cells vary with light. CMOS or TTL gates provide the SIGMOID\nsomewhat-linear-yet-somewhat-limiter transfer function often used. \nLow power Schottky gates, and earlier gates, has about a gain of X8.\nLEDs probably output enough light to easily control CdS cells, even at a\nfew mA. And paper with dark and light regions, controlled by pencil and\neraser, could also control CdS resistance. The very high input resistance of\nCMOS gates may let you charge up 1uF paper/mylar caps to serve as memory.
Hello,\n\nCan somebody tell me what kind of MOV's are most useful for a computer\nsurge protector?  Radio Shack have 2 types, both rated 130V, one for\na 10A current and the other for 20A.  On the other hand, commercial surge\nprotectors I have seen claim a clamping voltage of 330V-400V, which SEEMS to\nme in imply a rated voltage of about 250V (250V * SQRT(2.)=353).\n\nWhat is the right kind?\n\nWhile at it, ow important is really the EMI/RFI module?  Is there really any\nnoticable level of such noise in the power line?\n\nPlease-  E-MAIL to me, as this group has too much volume for me to be able\nto follow.
You are quite correct in your understanding.  The filtering is not\ninterpolation, as that would distort the frequency content of the signal\nyou are listening to.  Generally, these players run the samples thru an\nall-pass filter network.  I have done this for ECG waveforms from a person's\nheart, and the effect is rather spooky.  It actually reconstructs peaks\nthat weren't there (correctly, too!) and fills in the gaps with the\nproperly computed values, just as if there had been a real sample taken at\nthat point.  I use a CPU to do all the math.  It takes a decent (but not\nunreasonable) amount of CPU time to do this.  You can keep up with things\nin realtime if you write efficient code.\n\nIn case you care, the filtering method uses an FIR (finite impulse response)\nfilter.  I'd guess that CD makers use the same kind of method.  Anybody out\nthere know the real answer?  I'd say that they use a tapped delay line with\nresistor/op-amp weighting to accomplish the filtering.  This strikes me as\nthe most cost effective method for volume production runs.\n\n\n\nActually, I think the only reason they do this is so that they can say that\nthey have a marketting gimic.  I would guess that it is acutally cheaper to\nfilter an oversampled signal than not.  You can use sloppier components and\ngive the filter a roll-off that isn't so sharp.   It's too bad that they\ncharge more for something that (I think) is actually less costly to build.\n\nI seriously doubt that the filters cost the same but are better.  They are\nbuilt to a price spec, and that spec says "cheap as possible!". \n\n\n\n  -dave
Is there a readily available solvent that does a good job at removing the  \ncorrosion/encrustation that collects on the battery terminals (usually the  \ncathode) when using alkaline batteries (or more accurately, when NOT using  \nthem for a long time)?
I would like to get some information on the current systems used for HD-TV\nsound systems.thanks.

Could someone point me toward a source (FTP/BBS/whatever) for development\ntools for the 8051 microprocessor.  I specifically am looking for a Macintosh\ncross-assembler/disassembler.  Also, is there a mailing-list dedicated to\ndiscussing the 8051?  Thanks.
This has been an interesting thread to follow... and obviously this group\nwasn't intended as a forum for the discussion of piracy... Has anyone seen\nany estimates of the lost revenue due to pirates?  I was wondering if\npiracy is more rampant in Home or Corporate computing environments.  I would\ntend to think that business environment "piracy" is the major contributor to\nthis form of lost revenue.  So many companies will purchase a few copies of a\nsoftware package and then employees will internally distribute them as if they\nowned a site-license!  What do you guys think?
Why are circuit boards green?  The material used to make them goes by two\nnames.  If it is used to make circuit boards it is called FR-4.  The same\nmaterial is used in the cryogenics industrya and marine industries as a\nstructural material and is called G-10.  FR-4 and G-10 are both green.  They\nare not green because of a solder masking agent.  The basic ingredients are\na clear epoxy resin and glass fibers.  I am not sure what the specs are on\nthe resin, but if you are really curious you can call NEMA (National\nElectronics Manufacturing Association) or Ciba Geigy (a major manufacturer\nof epoxy resins) to find out.  As an aside, I occasionally mix clear epoxy\nand glass microsphres to cast small structures for cryogenics experiments.\nThe proportions of glass to epoxy are about the same as in G-10.  They are\nthe same green color.
