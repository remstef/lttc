Gant's ML record  Age 28 this season.\n\nYear   G   AB     BA   OBP   SLG   HR   SB  CS\n1987   21   83  .265  .271  .386    2    4   2\n1988  146  563  .259  .317  .439   19   19  10  <-- 3rd Base Expt. year\n1989   75  260  .177  .237  .335    9    9   6\n1990  152  575  .303  .357  .539   32   33  16\n1991  154  561  .251  .338  .496   32   34  15\n1992  153  544  .259  .321  .415   17   32  10\n\nIn the majors for parts of 6 seasons, total playing time\napprox 4.5 seasons.\n\nJust looking at his hitting record, he's had 2 seasons of OPS\ngreater than .800, which is pretty good for an OF.  His\n1988 season is pretty decent for a rookie 2B.  The move to\nthird base explains a lot of his 1989.  When he returned as an OF,\nhe began hitting again.  And of course, last year he slumped.\n\nBut no learning curve?  He has obviously improved his batting eye\nover the years, as well as his SB/CS ratio.  As to his fielding,\nhe was an infielder when he was drafted, a 2Bman as he came\nup through the Braves system, and then the Braves put him through\n2 position changes in the space of a year.  He's an adequate OF,\nalthough not great, and at least some of your perception of his\nfielding is colored by watching him learn to play the OF at the\nML level.  (I know you're another long-term Braves fan :)\n\nAbout playing 3B...IMO, that's the 2nd most DIFFICULT position\nto field, after catcher.  At SS or 2B, you need more range and \nspeed, but at 3B, you've got to have quick reflexes and have \na GUN for an arm.  There are NO second chances at 3B, even when\nplaying sandlot softball!  Granted, I'd still put my best\noverall infielder at SS, but that's because he gets more\nchances, not because the job is harder.  It still amazes me\nthat so many teams have tried to convert other position players\nto 3B.  But maybe that's because the supply of "natural" 3B is\nscarce.\n\nFinally, Gant is a player who puts pressure on himself to\nperform well, and works hard to improve.  You don't get\nthose amazingly huge arms on that relatively small body without a\nlot of weight work.  Now, whether he's been overdoing it these\ndays may be a valid question, as is the question of whether\nhe tries too hard to make something happen during each at-bat.\nBut frankly, if a player is going to not live up to potential,\nI'd much rather they fail by trying too hard, than by not\ntrying hard enough.  You might be able to teach relaxation\nto an adult; but at that age I don't believe you can teach\nhustle.\n\nAll that said, I don't think I'd sign Gant to another long-term\ncontract.  He's 28 now, and I think he's free-agent eligible\nin 2 years, when he'll be 30.  Given his career curve and\nlimitations, I wouldn't expect him to last much past 35\nas a ML ballplayer.  He might surprise me here, but Atlanta's\ngot some talent on the farm, and I'd rather take my chances\ndown the road with Nieves et al.
I think there is another formula for ERA.  I heard something about it last \nyear.  Im not sure what it is, but im gonna give it a stab.  It allows for\na pitcher to pitch more than 9 innings at a time and not benefit, cuz it\nuses outs recorded instead of innings pitched...\n\n        ERA = (ER*27)/outs recorded\n\nLike i said, im not sure this is exactly it, but im pretty sure they changed\nit to something of the sort.
Note:  I'm not posting this as part of an argument with Roger Meynard,\nbut as an independent sort of thread.  I do actually quote some things\nthat Roger Meynard wrote, but it might be better to think of this as\n"sampling" his post (in the hip-hop sense) because it fits in with what\nI want to say.\n\n\nThere's an interesting parallel between this way of viewing a baseball\nteam and some people's conception of a biological organism.  In the\nbiology context, we would very likely read "fitness" for "the score of\nthe game" and "organisms" for "teams".  How we interpret "players" is\ntrickier, but either "organs", or "genes" might seem reasonable\nchoices depending on what point we were trying to make.  A "genes"\ninterpretation actually might be really interesting in this case, \nbut that would be a different and probably longer post.\n\nIf, however, we take the "organ" view, then our knowledge of biology\nshould make us pause before we start saying things like "species X is\nmore fit than species Y because of a better organ Z".  Given what we\nknow about the interdependence of organs, we would often be suspicious\nof such claims.  (But note that this type of argument is quite often\nmade when you map "species X" onto 'humans', and "organ Z" onto\n'brain').  On the other hand, some statements of this kind do seem\nmore reasonable than others, as far as we can test them (e.g. 'brain'\nabove might be more reasonable than 'pancreas' assuming no gross\npathology, particularly if species Y is a primate).\n\nEven when you make such statements, you should be concerned with the\nfunctioning of the whole organism, and the possibility that one organ\nmight be more crucial for one species and a second organ in another.\n(Not to mention the possibility that no organ is particularly crucial\nin some third species.)  However, if we are non-vitalists with any\nkind of reductionsit streak, we will want to say that an organism is\nnot some completely magical unanalyzable "whole" but an intriguing\nprocess made up of various subprocesses that interact in ways that are\npotentially observable.  Some of these processes might be localized to\nparticular organs, while others may be distributed across multiple\norgans.  In a way, this is just like a baseball team, except that I\nthink it is pretty clear that the processes and interactions involved\nin baseball are *much* simpler and less numerous than in most organisms.\n\n\nOne thing that is quite difficult about baseball is that perfectly\ncontrolled experiments are sometimes very tough to do.  But, of\ncourse, this has never stopped researchers from doing the best they\ncan, and sometimes deriving very powerful conclusions even in the\nabsence of certainty.  Most of this goes far beyond sheer speculation,\nbut even sheer speculation can motivate further interesting research.\n\n\nIn this cases, we're seeing the word "statistics" means "summary of\nobserved events", where the events themselves can be viewed as the\noutput of some process, and possibly inputs for other processes.\nThus, if we have any valid notion of how the processes are put together\ninto the functioning organism, data in the form of statistics might\ngive us a basis to test particular hypotheses.\n\n\nThis statement brings us back to the concept of fitness again.\nFitness is defined in terms of both an organism and its environment;\nyou might be fit in one situation and not another.  Moving to\nbaseball, it is clear that each team spends the entire season in an\nenvironment including all the other teams in the league.  In at least\na nominal sense, the division winners are the fittest teams in the\nleague, in that they (on average) had better fitness scores than any\nof their competing opponennts.  But in a real sense, there is a fairly\nlarge random component in the performance of each team that is\ndifficult if not impossible to account for in terms of factors\nintrinsic to (or interesting for) baseball.  The same is true in\nbiology.  But here is also no direct biological equivalent of the\nWorld Series in basebal.  In the world series, the random component\nmay be greatly magnified by the small number of games that are played,\nand both teams suddenly experience huge changes from the environement\nwhere they were originally successful.  It might be fun to watch, but\nit's unclear what it all really means.\n\n***\n\nNow just one more un-related point:\n\n\nOn the other hand, you have seen some of us who can predict the\noutcome of the divisional races better than a random assignment of\nteams to finishes, and maybe some of us (e.g. me) who can do this\nbetter than the other participants in this forum on a regular basis.\nBut this is probably only due to the fact that a 162-game schedule\ngives you a little hope that bad hops aren't the only difference\nbetween the winners and the losers.\n\nMoreover, you've had the opportunity to see some analysis of the World\nSeries situation that makes the strong claim that *nobody* can predict\nthe WS winner with reliably greater accuracy than a coin biased only\nto reflect the well-known home vs. road effect on winning percentage.\n\n\nSince stats are summaries of events, it's true that if you know the\nevents you can derive the stats.  But if somebody is trying to\nunderstand the process behind the stats, then the stats produce new\nknowledge, and some of this might even be reliable, repeatable, and\nuseful.  Speaking of which, I should get back to producing knowledge\nin a different field.  That is, of course, if I can produce knowledge\neven though I'm relying on stats to do it.
Cardinals\nfor poor\n\nWithout opening this up for a sabermetric flame war, I would like to\nquestion the notion that "sitting a rested player down" has any real\neffect on his long-term performance.  Sure, if a man is tired and needs\nreal rest, then taking a break might be a constructive act.  Perhaps if\na man is mentally "strained", then sitting him down might help to the\nextent that that helps him relax.  But I would like to suggest that\nin the long run, players do slump, and benching is probably irrelevant.
Some time back in this newsgroup, I seem to recall a thread about\npredicting the runs a given lineup of 9 batters could be expected\nto score given the appropriate statistical alphabet soup for these\nhitters (OBP, SLG, AVG, bat length, hat size, day-of-the-week,\nweather conditions, etc.).  :-)  Anyway, was I dreaming or is there\nsome such animal?\n\nMy apologies if this has been covered recently, I probably get to\nread 10% of the articles posted here.  No time.  \n\nMany thanks in advance,\n\nscotty\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n M.

Ah, but the illusion in football is that there is always lots of action and\na sense of urgency because of the game clock (not all the time, but it happens\nwhen there's less than 5 minutes to go quite often).  This sense creates\ndrama, even when there may not necessarily be any and that holds a viewer's\nattention.  In baseball, only 3 players are involved in the action for about\n(here comes a wild guess) 70% of the time?  And they're just playing a\nsophisticated game of catch/hold-the-ball/step-out-of-the-box/adjust-chains/\ntouch-self-in-interesting-locations.  There's a lot of "dead time" with the\nplayers warming up between innings or the manager visiting the pitcher at the\nmound or the manager removing the pitcher and bringing in a relief pitcher\nwho then takes (8? 10?) pitches or Helen Dell playing the organ (Dodger fans\nwill appreciate that one).  To the non baseball junkie this is boring.\nAt any rate, I'm not putting baseball down for this - I've been an avid\nfan since I can remember - it's just that watching a baseball game on\nT.V. at home can be tedious for the non baseball junkie.  That's what Major\nLeague Baseball and the networks are trying to address when they talk of\nshortening the game.  It's because of T.V. not because "football has more\naction than baseball".
No.  I do not find this conceivable.  I also cannot conceive of the\npossibility that there is any hypothetical team which Morris would\nhelp more than Clemens.\n\n\nGiven your premise, yes.  But you are alone in your ability to\nconceive of that premise.
Well, yeah. On the other hand, for the first few years of his career he\nlooked like Herb Washington. Dan Gladden doesn't seem to suck defensively,\neither.\n\nYeah, and how many of the white guys played one year into a long career?\nIt's actually not an uncommon phenomenon, and how long a guy hangs around\nbased on one good year seems like a reasonable question to explore on a\nracial basis.\n\nHey, he plays for Lou Gorman, doesn't he? OK, so it's eight years.\n\n\nGood point on Cedeno. OTOH, I haven't seen that extensive list of 10-year\nDan Gladdens, either. There really aren't that many players altogether who\nhang around for 10 years even if they're reasonably good.\n\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com
They lowered the mound first (before the 69 season).  The shrinkage of\nthe strike zone didn't start until the mid-70s.
Could someone out there send me Pecota's stats for the last few years, or\nsomething to give me some sort of "feel" for what kind of player he is?\nMy mind has no handle on him at all, it bothers me.  Pecota of the Braves,\nthat is.  Pretty meaningful that I can't even come up with his first name,\nI think..
Of course you can.  You just have to be careful about what conclusions\nyou draw.\n\n\nHuh?  The 20's and 30's were the *worst* decades for great pitching.  Grove,\nVance, Dean, and not a whole lot else.  \n\nAs for the best all-around hitters, stat-wise, Ruth, Gehrig, Foxx, Greenberg,\nHornsby, Cobb, etc. all played before the 40's.  Stat-wise, the 60's were \na graveyard for hitters.\n\n\nHow do you know?  Which ones do you consider great?\n\n\nSo?  Sheffield also has better shoes.  More time between pitches.  You can\nrun the comparison, but there are *lots* of things to take into account.\n\n\nWell, can we compare them or can't we?\n\n\nWhy?  We can compare players to the *standard* of their era; and we can\nkeep in mind era-to-era differences without throwing up our hands in\ndespair.\n\n\nYou haven't shown us what's *un*reasonable about the MAntle-Sheffield\ncomparison that you yourself did.
So, that is the reason why the Toronto Blue Jays *should* keep Alfredo\nGriffin, just because it "worked"?\n\nA team winning doesn't mean that everything that it's doing is right.\nA team not winning doesn't mean that everything that it's doing is wrong, or\notherwise (to borrow the Sharks' situation) you would say that George Kingston\nshould be fired.\n\n\nBy then, it's too late.  The problem with "not fixing something while it's\nworking" is that by then, there may not be anything left to fix.\n\n\nSo, the Blue Jays were simply perfect last year; there was nothing that they\ncould have done to have improved that team.  NOT.
Major League Baseball is trying to expand its appeal to people with shorter\nattention spans (i.e. the football crowd). (-:  Invariably, all the\narguments from people who don't like to watch baseball on T.V. say the\nsame thing:  the games are too long and too boring.  Baseball is trying\nto find a way to shorten the games for wider T.V. appeal.  If you look at\nit, though, baseball games last around the same amount of time as football\ngames.  The difference is that there is "more action" in that duration in\nfootball games.  Perhaps if there were "more action" in baseball games, you\nwould get more of those fans to tune in.  Anyway, coming up with a solution\nto make baseball more appealing to a bigger crowd is going to be difficult.\n[On soapbox] Yet another reason to get a commisioner NOW since it's obvious\nthat ruling baseball by comittee works about as fast as a snail race in\nNebraska.

Ugliest swing..I am not sure. I think the ugliset stance is\nJolio Franco of the Ranger. I wonder how that bat comes around in time\nto hit the ball. It looks bad but hey.it get the job done.
I laugh at you now, and I will laugh at you again, equally publicly,\nwhen the Jays finish third due to the severe depletion of their talent.\nI think Bill James put it best (about Sparky Anderson, _Abstract_ 1983):\n\n"There are a million guys in this country with great attitudes, but there\nare only about five hundred who can play a major league brand of baseball;\nwhich are you going to take?"
Disclaimer -- This is for fun.\n\nIn my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called\n"stolen hits", defined as a play made that "an average fielder would not\nmake with average effort."  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted\nby Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive stats\nfor the centerfielders. Hits Stolen have been redefined as "Plays Juan\nGonzalez would not have made."\n\nOK, I realize that's unfair.  Juan's probably the victim of pitching staff,\nfluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If we\nreplaced every centerfielder in the league with someone with Kevin's 55.4% out\nmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?\n\nTo try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net\nHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league\naverage fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net Extra \nBases (doubles and triples let by).\n\nFinally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or\nDCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.\nI add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which\nshould represent the player's total contribution to the team.  So don't\ntake it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this\narticle.\n\nThe short version -- definition of terms\nHS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell\nNHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder\nNDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder\nNEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder\nDCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate.\nDOPS -- DCON + OPS -- quick & dirty measure of player's total contribution.\n\nNational League\n\nName            HS   NHS   NEB   DCON    DOPS\nNixon, O.       34    12    15   .083    .777\nGrissom, M.     48    18    12   .072    .812\nJackson, D.     46    13    20   .060    .735\nLewis, D.       25     8    -6   .029    .596\nDykstra, L.     25     5    -5   .013    .794\nDascenzo, D.    10    -5    10   .001    .616\nFinley, S.      32    -2     2  -.003    .759\nLankford, R.    39     4   -12  -.007    .844\nMartinez, D.    21     5   -16  -.017    .660\nVanSlyke, A.    30    -4   -17  -.040    .846\nSanders, R.      7   -10    -4  -.059    .759\nButler, B.       1   -29     5  -.088    .716\nJohnson, H.      3   -12   -19  -.118    .548\n\nOrdered by DOPS\n\n.846 VanSlyke\n.844 Lankford\n.812 Grissom\n.794 Dykstra\n.777 Nixon\n.759 Finley\n.759 Sanders\n.735 Jackson\n.730 *NL Average*\n.716 Butler\n.660 Martinez\n.616 Dascenzo\n.596 Lewis\n.548 Johnson\n\nAmerican League\n---------------\n\nName            HS   NHS   NEB   DCON    DOPS\nLofton, K.      57    32    17   .220    .947\nWilson, W.      47    26     0   .125    .787\nWhite, D.       52    25    28   .119    .812\nFelix, J.       22     0    32   .063    .713\nDevereaux, M.   43    16     0   .047    .832\nMcRae, H.       38    11    -1   .038    .631\nYount, R.       31     8    -3   .022    .737\nKelly, R.       13    -6    -3  -.025    .681\nJohnson, L.     23    -5   -13  -.040    .641\nGriffey, K.     15    -9   -12  -.052    .844\nPuckett, K.     13   -13   -15  -.063    .801\nCuyler, M.       6   -10    -6  -.088    .503\nGonzalez, J.     0   -21   -15  -.095    .738\n\n\nOrder by DOPS\n\n.947 Lofton\n.844 Griffey\n.832 Devereaux\n.812 White\n.801 Puckett\n.787 Wilson\n.738 Gonzalez\n.737 Yount\n.713 Felix\n.709 *AL Average*\n.681 Kelly\n.641 Johnson\n.631 McRae\n.503 Cuyler\n\nMore discussion --\n\nDCON formula:  ((NHS + NDP)/PA) + ((NHS + NDP + NEB)/AB)\nWhy such a bizzare formula?

A-hem. Two words: Russell Davis. Playing in the cavern at Albany (AA) last\nyear (375/410/385 down the alleys and to center), Davis went .285/.355/.483\nwith 22 homers. There aren't any small parks on the road in the Eastern\nLeague, either. He's 23(!) and his MLE was .258/.308/.416, 17 HR. I have no\nfielding statistics, but from seeing him a number of times last year I'd say\nthat he's not Brooks Robinson, but neither is he Howard Johnson. Unless they\nthink they can win the pennant *this year* (which seems possible) and need\nBoggs to do it, I think they're making the same sort of mistake with Davis\nthat Boston made with Boggs, leaving him in the minors for two or three\nyears after he'd shown that he was a good hitter.\n\n\nHrm? They still have him on the roster (16 AB through the first two weeks).\nThey've just never figured out what to do with him. I suspect that he hits\nenough (especially vs. lefties) to be a reasonable shortstop. One rumor\nrunning around during spring training was that they wanted to convert\nSilvestri to be a catcher(!) because "his body type was wrong for a\nshortstop".  You'd think that somebody in the same *division*, who plays\nBaltimore about a dozen times a year, would know better.\n\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com
[some deletions]\n\nWell, we agree on the last part.:-)  One of the basic things you need to \nhave in a statistic to be able to predict a player's performance on it\nin the future is for there to be a correlation from year to year.  A \nplayer's batting average is correlated fairly well from year to year.\nA player's ability to walk or infielder's Defensive Average are correlated\nbetter.  That is to say, given their past performance in those statistics\nwe can have a pretty good handle on how they'll do next year.  Put in \nsome simple information about aging and you can do even better.  One of \nthe basic problems with something like "clutch" batting average - overall\nbatting average is that the correlation from year to year is almost zero. \nAdding to the sample size doesn't seem to help much.  As a counterexample to \nwhat you showed, consider the following two players from 1984-1987:\n\n               Non-Clutch                      Clutch\n               AB      H       BA              AB      H       BA\n \nMaldonado      1060    260     .245            254     78      .307\nLemon          1643    457     .278            256     57      .223\n\nIf you had had these two players in 1988, by your logic, in those "clutch"\nsituations, you'd bat Maldonado for Lemon in a blink of an eye.  Well, in \n1988, Maldonado hit .267 in "non-clutch" and .190 in "clutch", while Lemon\nhit .254 in "non-clutch" and .313 in "clutch".  Before you accuse me of \ncompletely cooking the data, there were 96 players who had 25+ "clutch"\nat bats every year from 1984-1988 (according to Elias).  As a simple\nmeasure of clutchness, let's just look at clutch BA-non-clutch BA. If you use \n'84-'87 to predict '88 for those 96 players, you'd find that 27 of the\n96 were below league average in that measure both in '84-87 and in '88,\n26 were above league average in both periods and the other 43 were \nabove in one and below in the other.  If you were just flipping coins,\nyou'd expect to get 24 above/below in both and 48 that switched.  The\ndifference between the observed results and the coin flip experiment\nis not statisically significant.\n\nBTW, correlating players' _overall_ batting average from '84-'87 with\n'88 gives a correlation coefficient of 0.59, which is significant at\nsomething better than the 99.9% confidence level.  Correlating their\n(clutch-non-clutch BA) for the same period gives a correlation of \n0.088, significant at no level of any interest.\n\n\nActually, it's technically incorrect to say that we can't predict future\nclutch performance.  It's more correct to say that we can't predict\nfuture clutch performance with any skill.\n\nHarold
This is a phenomenon known around work as ready-fire-aim. I am astounded at\nthe number of times people post strong opinions about things they not only\ndon't understand but publicly admit to not understanding. In fact, there's a\nplausible argument that saves are a more rational stat than wins.\n\nFor the record, there are two ways that a reliever can get a save:\nHe must finish the game and either\n1. have entered the game with the tying run on base, at bat, or on deck.\n2. have pitched at least three innings effectively.\nA pitcher may not get a win and a save in the same game.\n\n\nBut this is an argument that *wins* is a dumb stat, not saves.\n\n\nThis again doesn't support your claim about saves at the beginning of your\npost. \n\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com

I couldn't agree more.  The Jays have a lot of power in their line-up. \nSo far pitching has been the biggest problem.  Maybe we can get Acker back? :-)\n\n\nOne incident that sticks out in my mind was when Derek Bell ran back out on\nto the feild after the Jays had won the division and all the players were\nback in the clubhouse.  Bell ran around the field with his arms in the air,\nwaving a big towel over his head.  He looked like a big jerk, especially\nwhen you consider he did not contribute much to the team over the whole\nseason.  The next day, Winfield and Carter somehow got the keys to Bell's\nJeep and brought it out on to the feild before the game started.  The stadium\nannouncer said that there was going to be a draw later in the game for Bell's\njeep.  Bell really freaked out. I don't think Bell was to popular after that.\n\nI think that Jackson might be trying a little too hard right now.  He's known\nfor being a great outfielder,  and he's not the only Blue Jay who has been\nbooting balls and playing generally awful.\n\n\nandrew

It was the game\nwhere Pendelton broke up the scoreless tie in the ninth with a two-out,\ntwo-run homer to right to win it.  (It wasn't the game where the fans\nthrew the give-away "fotoballs" onto the field in response to the homer --\ntoo bad, huh?)\n\nWell, the 'Stick is still cold.  The Saturday game ended at 5:45pm, and it\nwas cold then.  I can't imagine night games in April at the 'Stick.  The\nwind kicked up a little, too, and I got this idea.\n\nAt most games, there's a pile of hot dog wrappers and cups and trash on\nthe field a lot of the time.  I propose a Kid's Clean-up Corps composed\nmainly of 10-12 year old kids who would love nothing better than to run\nout on the field in the fifth inning (when the guy in the Toro smooths\nthe infield) and grab the trash.\n\nIt might not be glamorous, but at that age I probably would have given\nanything to be on the field with the ballplayers.  Everybody wins here!\n\nWhaddaya think?
As of today's USA Today (4/23) John Wetteland should come off of the DL\ntonight and possibly pitch in the series this weekend (I forget who they play.)\nDerek Lilliquist is probably going to be the main closer, but it will be kind\nof a bullpen by committee also.
Dummy Hoy, a late 19th-Century baseball player, was deaf.  In\norder for him to be able to find out whether the pitch was a ball or\nstrike, the umpires developed hand signals.  This also helped to relieve\nthe stress on umpires' vocal cords, so they didn't have to shout "STRIKE!!!"\nor "BALL!!!!!" 350 times a game...\n	Heard about this one from the only worthwhile baseball book\nJohn Thorn has ever authored, "A Century of Baseball Lore" :-)
It would help if his OBP were higher than his batting average. Yes, the\nApril 12 USA Today lists Le Grand Chapeau as having a .422 batting average\nand a .413 OBP. That's on 19-for-45 hitting with 0 (zip, nil, nada) walks.\nThe reason a lot of us are down on Galarraga is that he's has a long history\nof showing that this is nowhere near his real level of ability (except for\ndrawing walks). If he hit .400 for, say, even 250 AB's I'd be convinced that\nthere was a real change in his ability. If he did it with an OBP<AVG, I'd\nnot only be amazed but I'd make a bet that that would be a unique feat in\nthe history of the game. But what do 45 AB's prove? Look at some of the\nother fluke players at this point in the season:\n  Player    AVG AB\n  Blauser  .367 49\n  Grace    .391 48\n  Milligan .400 35\n  Conine   .375 40\n  Lansing  .400 50\n  Slaught  .406 32\nAre any of these guys really that good? Well, in a word, no. How significant\nis Galarraga's average? At the 45 AB level, a hit is worth about .020. If\nhe'd had one of those hits called an error and one taken away by a good\ndefensive play, he'd be in the .380 range. If he goes 0-for-4 in his next\ngame he's all the way down to .388. In one game. Come back in June. Let's\ntalk then.\n\n\nIt's history, Greg. Andres' history is that he doesn't walk much because he\nswings at bad pitches, so his average isn't very good. 45 AB's doesn't mean\nan awful lot compared to a history of a couple of thousand, especially when\nthere's ample evidence (0 BB in 1992) that his basic hitting approach hasn't\nchanged. Yeah, he might suddenly have turned into a .400 hitter who never\nwalks, but don't bet the rent money on it.\n\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com
As the heading indicates, it is impossible for me to fathom why Barry is not\nbatting 4th for the Giants behind Will Clark.  Barry is such an awesome and\nconsistent hitter -- definitely the best in the National League.  IMHO, to \nhave Williams, a streaky hitter (and not really a clutch hitter) batting\n4th ahead of Bonds is simply an injustice to the Giants and fans of the\nGiants.
In this morning's paper (or was it on the radio?), Vizquel was quoted as\nsaying that he could have fielded the ball with his glove and still\neasily thrown out Riles, that he barehanded it instead so as to make the\nfinal play more memorable.  Seems a litle cocky to me, but he made it\nwork so he's entitled.\n-- \nDoug Dudgeon                             Dept. of Chemical Engineering, BF-10\ndudgeon@opus.cheme.washington.edu        University of Washington, Seattle
Last night, Boston Red Sox win its 11 games of 14 games by beating Seattle\n5-2.  Roger Clemson pitch not so dominate.  He walked at least 6 man in\nfirst 6 inns.  But Valetin and Greenwell hit homeruns and Red Sox prevail.
[...]\n\nYou could be right.  Then again, you could be wrong.  This claim is completely\nunverifiable and untestable.  I'd wager most of the Braves fans on the net\ncould name more than 3 players from their 1988 season.\n\nYou could give away tickets to Braves games.  However, my Dad and I were able\nto get great seats from scalper for face value, which isn't exactly the sign\nof a hot ticket...\n\n\nThis is *precisely* why they were considered America's team.  Even\n(especially?) when they were bad, you could see most of the Braves games on\ncable.  You could do that for the Cubs as well, but the Braves had better\ncamerawork, better announcers (what would you rather listen to -- Harry discuss\nthe game, or Skip and Pete discuss motoball?), and teams that weren't *too*\nmuch worse.  Because of TBS, the Braves had a lot of fans outside of Georgia.\nAt home in Kentucky, even though we were much closer to Cincinnati there was\nas many Braves fans as Reds fans, even in 1990.  You could actually watch the\nBraves play -- you had to go to Cincinnati to watch the Reds.  I can go\nanywhere in America and watch the Braves.\n    \n\nWhy?  I'd guess that Braves fans are more widely distributed than Toronto\nfans.\n-- \nDale J. Stephenson |*| (steph@cs.uiuc.edu) |*| Baseball fanatic
TWINS UPDATE --  Posted April 22, 1993  \n---------------------------------------------\nThe Twins defeated the Milwaukee Brewers 5-4 today to conclude a three game\nhomestand with the Brew crew.  The Twins took two of three games in the series,\nwith scores as follows:\n\n                  Tuesday April 20th    MN  10\n                                        Mil  0\n                   Winning Pitcher Banks (2-0)  \n\n                  Wednesday April 21st  Mil 10  (10)\n                                        MN   8\n                    LP  - Hartley ( 0-1 )\n\n                  Thursday April 22nd   MN  5\n                                        Mil 4\n                    WP - Deshaies (4-0)\n                    Sa - Aguilera\n\nHighlight/Low Lights of the Series:\n------------------------------------\nJim Deshaies continues to be the surprise of not only the Twins, but of\nthe American League as well.  Going into today's game, Deshaies was 3-0\nwith a 1.74 ERA.  Deshaies allowed 2 Earned runs in 6 2/3 innings, meaning\nhis ERA will climb slightly.  Deshaies, who came to MN via a trade with\nPhiladelphia which sent David West there, continues to make Andy MacPhail\nlook like a true genius.\n\nWillie Banks has put together two solid starts for the Twins, going 6.1 innings\non Monday while coasting on solid Twins hitting.  Deshaies and Banks now \ncombine for 6 of the Twins eight victories, while Tapani/Mahomes/Erickson are\n0-5.\n\nWednesday's game marked the first opposing left-handed starting pitcher for the\nTwins this year (Rickey Bones).  The Twins teed off against both him and \nsubsequent relief, including a Grand Slam by Kent Hrbek which pushed the lead\nto 7-3.  The Twins pitching staff could not hold the lead, though, allowing\n4 walks in the 7th inning, 2 of which scored and coming with bases loaded.\nTapani gave up one walk before being relieved, Guthrie two walks, and Mike\nHartley one walk before the inning was over.  This tied the game at 7-7, and\nthe Brew Crew rocked Mike Hartley for 3 runs in the top of the tenth to win\nit.\n\nAguilera continues to be shaky against the Brew Crew.  6 of 20 career blown\nsaves have come against the Brew Crew, and today's game was shaky as well.\nComing into the ninth with a 5-2 lead, Aguilera gave up a solo HR to Vaughn,\nthen hits to Darryl Hamilton and Dickie Thon before finally retiring the\nside.  Once again, the tying run made it to second base on Aggie.\nWeak hearted Twins fans are advised not to watch Aggie in the ninth.\n\nGeneral News\n-------------------------------------\nPedro Munoz continues to improve as an outfielder, playing in left field on\nTuesday's game.  He continues to bat weakly against right handed pitching,\nthough, which has limited his playing time.  Gene Larkin and JT Bruett(former\nGopher) have been playing right field, as both can bat left handed.\n\nThe Twins begin a three game series with the Detroit Tigers tomorrow.  Starting\nPitching is tentatively scheduled as Erickson, Mahomes, Banks.  The Detroit\nTigers have had TWO 20 run games in the last ten days, and should provide \nquite a challenge to the young MN pitching staff.\n\nThe Twins have 9 HR's this year, three each from Puckett, Hrbek, and Winfield,\nthe third, fourth, and fifth batters, respectively.\n\nBrian Harper pegged 4 of the first 6 baserunners attempting to steal second\nthis year, and shows much improvement in this category.\n\nJim Deshaies has three pick-offs and one balk this year.  Some say he \nhas the best 1st base move in baseball.  This move has enabled him to pitch\nout of some tight early jams, and has certainly contributed to his 4-0 \nstart.  Watch to see if umpiring crews began calling the balk more tightly\nin response to opposing team complaints about his leg kicking behind the\nrubber on the pick-off move.\n\n\nCurrent MLB AL West Standings( from Joesph Hernandez, jtchern@ocb.berkeley.edu  )
Can anyone out there tell me Babe Ruth's complete pitching stats? I know he\nwas 5-0 as a pitcher for the Yankees, but what were his numbers when he was\nwith the Red Sox? Thanks in advance!
The best one I saw last year was Willie McGee off Matthews (I think?) in\nPhillie.  A fierce line drive that was still rising when it hit thE\nsecond deck facade at the Vet.  Willie McGee had one homerun last year.
The answer is - they're stupid.  Seriously, I think you're right\non the money; I've never understood the preoccupation with making\nsure a rotation has left-handed starters.  The only time it makes\nsense to me is when you have an unbalanced schedule and your main\nrival(s) is loaded with lefthanded hitters.  Other than that, I think\nyou're completely right.
a) Dominican\nb) not all that light-hitting.  .304 lifetime, .315 or so in 1966-73\nwhen he did most of his playing.  \nc) Professional pinch-hitter after that.  Yes, that also gives you\nJerry Hairston.\n\n\nBeginning 10th year now.\n\n\nGood one.\n\n\nNot the same thing.  LOTS of people are bad OFs.\n\n\nNot all that light either.  .750 OPS.\n\n\nNot 10 year.\n\n\n10-year this year.\n\n\nNot 10-year.  \n\n\nNot 10-year.\n\n\nYup.\n\n\nOK.\n\n\n10-year this year.\n\n\n*Six*-year this year.\n\n\nBrock, Coleman, and Wilson were hot-dog basestealers (also Lonnie Smith);\nthat seems to be a special class.  CFs like Pettis and Wilson also get \nmore of a break, especially if they actually *do* field well.  And Brock\nwasn't all that bad a hitter either, not until the end there when he \nspoiled his ifetime .300 BA.\n\nAnd again, I suspect thatthe problem is lessening over time.  But if\nyou look at the history of the last three decades, there seems to \nbe a clear race-based pattern by which utility players and platoon\nplayers and lesser talents stayed in the ML far longer if they were\nwhite.\n\n\nLight hitting?  199 HR, .793 lifetime OPS mainly with *HOUSTON*?\nAlso Latin, btw.\n\n\n\nCome back in 1999 and we'll party^H^H^H^H^H talk.
AND the first team in the majors to win 10 games! Yes! It'll never last, but\nGod it's good while it's here!\n\n\nWell, there's a holiday in Massachusetts called Patriots' Day. Three things\nhappen on Patriots' Day: almost all businesses are closed, the Sox play a\nmorning game, and they run the Boston Marathon.\n\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com
NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nWHAT KIND OF HAPPY GRASS YOU ARE SMOKING?

I'll go with Mark Grace, and in 2 years, Frank Thomas.
I watched the final inning of Bosio's no-hitter with several people at\nwork. After Vizquel made that barehanded grab of the chopper up the\nmiddle, someone remarked that if he had fielded it with his glove, he\nwouldn't have had time to throw Riles out. Yet, the throw beat Riles\nby about two steps. I wonder how many others who watched the final out\nthink Vizquel had no choice but to make the play with his bare hand.\nDoes anybody think Vizquel was wrong to field the ball barehanded? And\nif he failed to field it cleanly, would it (or should it) have been an\nerror or a hit? (Judging from Bosio's grimace when the ball bounced\npast him, he must have thought it would go through for a hit.) Whether\nVizquel was right or wrong, he certainly made one hell of a play.\n\n\n\n--\n--------------------------\nPhil Brown                |\naka pb6755@csc.albany.edu |
I dont know about the story but it comes from the fact that in most stadiums, the batter faces northeast and so when\na pitcher is on the mound, his left arm is to the south, hence the term.
: I have wondered why a pitcher is given 8 pitches when he enters the\n: game.  Let's be serious.  The relief pitcher has normally been\n: throwing out in the bullpen for a few minutes.  Does he really need 8\n: more pitches?\n\n  If the relief pitcher didn't get 8 pitches, there wouldn't be enough time\nto:\n\n  1) Play "Hit The Road Jack"\n  2) The Iron City Relief Pitcher Commercial\n  3) The announcers to detail to us exactly what drove the \n      previous one from the game\n  4) A detailed biography, both personal and statistical, of the \n      new guy throwing his 8 pitches.\n  5) Get really cool super-slo-mo pictures for Diamond Vision to put up\n      by said pitchers name and stats!
To all the Braves doubters:\n\nDon't worry.  The bats will come alive, and the Braves will come around.\nThe pitching is solid, and as long the Braves don't have serious injuries\nto the starting rotation, they'll continue to pitch well.  Heck, with\nthe five starters on the Braves rotation, they could even sustain an\ninjury to one of the five (I hope this doesn't happen, though).\n\nThe bats are there... Pendleton will certainly bat over .280, Justice\nis catching fire, Bream, Nixon, Sanders, Gant... well, there's too\nmuch offense there to be kept quiet for much longer.  Right now, the\nCleveland Indians have 7 players batting over .300!  But I certainly\nwouldn't their seven for our respective seven (though wouldn't the\nBraves be something right now with their pitching and 7 players batting\nover .300?).\n\nThe bullpen... well, it IS suspect.  But when the bats come alive, the\nguys in the bullpen will be of less concern.\n\nSo anyway, I believe the Braves will be tough to beat this season.  I'm\nnot saying the Braves have automatically won the division, but I'm optim-\nistic about their season (though it's awful painful to watch them at\ntimes right now).\n\nGo Braves!!!
Actually, Keith Hernandez is the best.\n\n                                    -Sean

Your list of Jewish ballplayers includes Levi Samuel Meyerle (son of\nJacob and Margaret Meyerle). Although that sounds like a Jewish name,\nMeyerle's "surviving relatives" say he wasn't Jewish, according to\n"Nineteenth Century Stars," published by SABR in 1989. Incidentally,\n"Long Levi" (he was 6-foot-1) batted .492 in the first season of the\nNational Association, the first pro league. Needless to say, he hasn't\nbeen topped yet. (Of course, the NA is not considered a "major" league\nby officialdom.) Over five seasons, Meyerle hit .368 in the NA.

A "reasonable" umpire would have recognized that Ron Gant was \ndisturbed with the call.  A "reasonable" umpire would have realized that\nthere was a 1-run game in progress, with two outs in the ninth.  What\nRon Gant did was try to regain his composure.  What a "normal" baseball\nplayer would have done would have been to get into a heated argument\nwith the umpire, and since you can't argue balls and strikes, he would\nhave been ejected from the game.  Ron Gant, by trying to avoid such a\nconflict, was penalized for showing some restraint.\n\n	Incidentally, a "reasonable" home plate umpire would not have been\nso resistant to seeking the appeal to the first base umpire, as Gant\nrequested.  If the home plate umpire had appealed to first, the first base\numpire could have wrung up the strike, and Gant would not have been so\nupset.  If the call had been a ball, and the catcher had requested the\nappeal, it is likely the home plate umpire would have asked for the help.\n\n	Finally, the entire game was pretty much a mockery of the so-called\nefforts to "speed up the game."  The game was played very quickly, it was\njust at 2 hours when the stuff happened in the ninth, and the only delays\nin the entire game had been *the result* of actions by the umpires (other than\nDeion having to clean garbage off the field).
I know, you all were saying "Ha!  The Braves score a few runs for \nMaddux, that'll shut that guy up."\n\nBut no,  I think we'll just keep track a bit longer...\n\nLast  outing: 5 runs.\n\nTotal to date:  8 runs, 4 games\n\nBraves record in Maddux's starts:  2-2\n\nSee ya next time.\n\nDennis

[stuff deleted]\n\nI agree with the flavor of this post, but disagree with one specific\nargument.  That "has great hands" means nothing.  It seems to me that\na first-baseman's defensive value is not entirely (or even primarily)\nfrom his ability to field grounders or catch popups.  How many such\nchances does he get during a game?  Many fewer than he gets chances\nto catch throws from 2B,SS,3B and P (I mean the total of these is\nmuch higher than Grounder/Popup totals).  This implies to me that there\nis value in catching these throws well, even if they are high, up-the-line\nor in the dirt.  "Good Hands" are needed for such plays, and thus have\nvalue.  I don't have any numbers for the relative number of occurences\nof these plays, but I'd guess that the values of these abilities are\nsimilar.  It's just like: you don't judge catcher's defense primarily\non how they field bunts and popups. (But not as marked I suppose).
Hey guys, who is this Jack Morris fella ??????\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nONLY JOKING !!!!! But try to lighten up will ya ? The season's only just \nstarted and everyone's apoplectic. If all you statheads out there are trying to\njustify how Morris is doing at the moment, just remember that we're talking\nabout a very small sample size. There is a helluva long way to go, so sit back\nand enjoy the ride.
First, a longer game in no way suggests "more baseball to watch," unless\nyou include watching the grass grow as baseball.  The lengthier games\nare so because of batters stepping out of the box, pitchers taking\nlonger between pitches and excessive trips to the mound by managers\nand pitching coaches.\n\nAnd while it's true that the gaps between plays can be interesting, this\nis only true when they don't become extra-long.  Quickly-pitched games\ncan grab and hold your attention much better.\n\nBring back the two-hour baseball game!  (And the three and a half hour\ngolf game with it!)
useless\nwhich of\nand\na\n\nBut ingnoring putouts is biased in yet another way. Range is\nnot the only thing that makes a good firstbaseman. The ability\nto field all sorts of balls thrown to him: digging some out of the\ndirt, stretching for others, and so forth is important. Thus, \nputouts do provide some information.  Maybe what we need is a\ncomparision of how many balls were thrown to the area of the\nfirst baseman vs. how many he actually got.
How do you know they can be shortened by half-an-hour?  Has anybody done a\nstudy to determine how much time is actually "wasted" -- say, in these A's\ngames?

so.\ndone,\ncareer\n\n\nVelarde hasn't been to Columbus, if I recall, for about three\nyears.  Granted, he hasn't been a full time player but\nwhen he does play I've always thought he had a good bat.\nHe might be demoralized about not playing full time, but\nhe hasn't been shuttled around.  I think he's been in New York\never since he had 34 hits in 100 AB back in 1989, or 90, I\nbelieve.  \nI don't think he is gold glove calibre, but he doesn't boot\nit around either.  I think if Velarde is given a chance,\nhe could become extremely productive.  I don't have any stats\nto back this up, and I don't know if his Defense would\ncost any games, but I think he could help - and he has\nthis year.  He has 3 HR already.  Same goes for\nJim Leyrtiz.  He has a big mouth, but he does get\nthe job done when he concentrates.  I think the situation\nwith Leyritz is that he believes he is a potential\nsuper-star, and he gets pissed about not playing.  I\nthink he might have realized something when the Marlins\nor Rockies didn't select him.\nThe Yanks need to worry about the Bullpen right now.\nKamieniecki and Wickman/Militello in the bullpen?\nOuch.  I'm praying that the BP will return to last year's\nform....
The original poster wanted to know how the Big Cat looked. I was also at\nthe Saturday game in Montreal (Apr 17) that Rockies won 9-1. I haven't\npaid much attention to Gallarraga since he left the Expos but his stance\nseemed to be MUCH different. He stands more erect and very open, with his\nleft foot pointing to 3rd base. I'm wondering if this is a recent change\nin stance for him? Andres had one glaring weakness as a hitter. He could\nalways be fooled by a curve ball low and away. If this is indeed a new\nstance for him, maybe he is not being fooled as easily? As for his patience,\n\nDennis Martinez definitely did not have his good stuff. If he was grooving\npitches to Andres, you can hardly fault him for drilling them (which he did!).\nDoes Andres generally start hot or cold? Does it take until May for most\npitchers to have confidence in that curve ball low and away?
I guess that nobody noticed that the calls during the world series (and, in\nfact all year) have been pretty much consistently CORRECT.  Remember: the rule\nsays it's a strike if ANY PART of the ball passes through the strike zone.\n\nI would certainly agree that  high strikes are not called (who could argue\nthis point?) but all in all I think in and out is called pretty well.
There are several reasons for this difference.  The main reason is that\ngood hitters in their prime (such as Frank Thomas and Danny Tartabull)\nare rarely regular DH's, even if they can't field; it's more commonly a\nplace to put aging veterans.\n\nAnother use of the DH slot is to help a player come back from injury\nslowly, getting his bat in the lineup without forcing him to play in the\nfield.  I would expect such players to hit worse as DH's than they did\nduring the rest of the season.\n\nA third factor is that most player who split time between DH and first\nor the outfield don't hit as well as DH's for some reason.  Reggie\nJackson was a good example; in five years as a RF/DH for the Angels, he\nhit like the old Reggie when he was in right.\n\nThe second and third factors will be lost if players are considered by\ntheir primary position only; a player who plays 90 games in right and 60\nat DH will count only in the right fielders' averages.\n\n\nThis makes sense; you might also look at it another way.  Although the\n*average* offensive performance of a DH may be lower than for a left\nfielder, the *replacement-level* offensive performance is certainly\nlower; if you are a left fielder but can't hit well enough to keep a job\nanywhere, then you certainly can't hit well enough to keep a job at DH.
Let's be careful here.  If players' performance was completely random\nin (Clutch-No Clutch), then you would still expect some players to be\ngood in the clutch every year and some to be not-so-good every year.\nWith two years worth of data, you'd have 1/4 of the players good each\nyear, 1/4 bad each year, and 1/2 would have one good and one bad year.\nWe have 96 players for 5 years ('84-'88).  Just flipping a coin, you'd\nexpect 3 players to be good all 5 years and 3 to be bad every year.\nThis is what we actually get--\n\nNo. of good years    0    1    2    3    4    5\nClutch performers    4   10   37   24   18    3\nCoin flip (random)   3   15   30   30   15    3\n\nEssentially the distribution of clutch performers by number of years\nof good performance is the same as what you would get if the process\nleading to deviations from non-clutch performance was completely random.\nIf there was anything to clutch hitting (at least in this definition)\nthat had any predictive capability, you expect to see the number of\nplayers at the ends to be much larger than that predicted by flipping\na coin.  Further, if you limit yourself to players who were a lot above\nor below average in clutch situations (say, 1 standard deviation from \nthe mean) more than one year, the random explanation still looks good.\nIn the four years ('84-'87) that I looked at the data from Elias, there\nwere 79 (29) players with a minimum of 25 (50) at bats in clutch \nsituations that were 1 sigma from the mean two different years.  Of\nthose 79 (29) players, 38 (14) of them changed sign between the two\nyears.  In other words, they were great clutch hitters one year and\nreally horrible the other year.  If it was just a random process, \nyou'd expect those numbers to be 39.5 (14.5).  \n\nEverything that's been measured about clutch hitting over a period\nof years that could be used to predict any ability with any \nproposed definition has looked like a random process (with the \ncaveat that there may be something related to platoon advantage\nthat could be dragged out of the data--e.g., John Lowenstein \nprobably never had a "clutch" AB against a left-handed pitcher,\nbut he might well have had some in blowouts, so that there would\nbe a bias since his clutch ABs would be more geared to his \nplatoon advantage).  This is not a subject that has been glanced\nat casually.  A lot of people have put a lot of effort into \nstudying it and every one of them, with the exception of the\nElias study, has been unable to find anything that would allow\nyou to predict how someone will do in clutch situations better\nthan flipping a coin.  (Self-serving plug follows:  some of the\nflaws in the Elias study are discussed in my paper in the forth-\ncoming SABR book, _The Perfect Game_, by Taylor Publishing.  The\nauthors are supposed to get a slice of the advance, so go bug\nyour local bookstores now, and maybe I can get enough to take my\nwife to dinner once.:-)\n\nHarold
What's with John Franco?  The Mets are hardly using him.  I heard he was\ncompletely recovered, but now I'm not so sure.\n\nIf there is anybody out there with information about Franco, I would\nappreciate it if you could drop me a line.

Hey!  What's this?  We agree!\n\nNo platoon advantage (Sabo vs. Samuel).\n\nBoth players have a reputation of being excellent fastball hitters,\n	and both have a reputation of being fooled too often with\n	slow curves and change ups.\n\nSabo has more power, and a little bit of a better batting eye.  Samuel\n	is noted as an agressive free-swinger.  Sabo has more homerun power.\n\nBoth players started the game hitting below .200.  \n\nThere may have been some game considerations that might have prompted\n	Perez to want to reserve Samuel for use later.  But the game\n	*was* on the line, and Samuel never did get in.\n\nGiven all of this, I don't see a lot to suggest pinch-hitting, nor do\nI see anything to suggest no pinch-hitting.  There is, of course, the\nclutch-hitting information.  But if that's useless...\n\nThen again.  If it's not...
: Hi there,\n: \n: I'm german and I have been into this MLB stuff since almost one year now.\n: There are many problems occuring for me. One of them is the ERA statistic for\n: pitchers. What does it say ??\n\nERA indicates the average number of earned runs attributed to a pitcher per\nnine inning game.  Thus, if a pitcher pitched 3 innings and gave up 1 earned\nrun, his 9 inning equivelent perfomance would be 3 earned runs, thus his ERA\nis 3.00.  To compute the ERA you simply take the number of earned runs divided\nby the innings pitched and then multiple the result by 9.\n\n	ERA = (ER/IP) * 9\n\nAn earned run is run that is given up by the pitcher that is not attributed\nto a fielding error.  More specifically, if an error occurs that represented\nthe third out, all runs scored after the error are considered UNEARNED runs.\nEarned runs are also runs scored as a result of players who were left on base\nwhen the pitcher exited the game.  Here are some examples:\n\n	If there are two outs in an inning and there are men on base.  If\n	an error occurs that represents the third out, all of the runs after\n	this error and NOT counted as earned runs.\n\n	If a pitcher issues some base on balls (walks), and leaves the game\n	before the inning is completed, he is responsible for the people who\n	were left on base.  If the those runners who were left on base score,\n	and the score was not a result of an error, those eraned runs are\n	attributed to the pitcher who left the game.\n\nI hope this explains things for you.

Well then given your definition of "best" is it not conceivable that\nAlfredo Griffin could bring something to a team that that team needs\nto win while Larkin might not have that something the team needs?\nWould Griffin then be better than Larkin?\n \n\n\nNo, I am not trying to define the quality of an individual, at least not\nfor the purpose of ranking them.  Toronto won with Olerud.  They might\nhave won with Fielder.  They might not have won with Thomas.  Detroit\nmight have won with Thomas.  Chicago might have won with Fielder.  You\ncan't rank these individuals.  You can only look at who might contribute\nmore to the team effort, which is winning the WS.  Thomas could not\nhave contributed to that goal any more than Olerud so I cannot say that\nOlerud is less of a player. \n \n--
But, Gary, for certain sofa tubers like myself, this is an advantage.  I\ncan watch the Pirates on KBL, the Mets on WWOR, the Braves on TBS, and the\nmediots on ESPN at the same time, without missing anything.  (If something\nimpressive happens, I'll catch the replay :-) ).\n\nSo, I see (essentially) 4 games in 3 hours, instead of 1 game in 2 hours.\nWhat a deal!\n\n(Insert smileys as desired...)
I definitely do.  That's why I don't like going to see games played\non artificial turf :-)\n\n\nWell, your idea of "interesting" differs from mine.  I think\nbatting practice is interesting, for example, and make a special\neffort to get to the game very early in order to see it.  I think the\ndelaying tactics of batters, pitchers, catchers, and managers are\ninteresting because they're attempts to gain advantage through control\nof the flow and timing of the game.  Of course, the umpires can, and\nshould, intervene when these tactics get out of hand.  As Ryan Robbins\nhas pointed out, there are rules that cover this.\n\nOne of the more fascinating things about baseball, I think, is its\nopen-endedness with regard to time.  You never know if the game is going\nto zip right by and be over in less than two hours, or if it's going to\ngo on until four in the morning.  Likewise, some games are action-packed,\nand some games are slow and lazy.  That's fine by me.  Those folks who\nwant constant action should watch the games on TV so they can channel-\nsurf and cater to their short attention spans.

A HBP, but it reminds of my favorite (apochryphal ? sp ?) Don Drysdale story.\n\nWhen ordered to intentionally walk a batter who had hot-dogged on him in\ntwo previous at-bats, Drysdale reared back with the first pitch and\ndrilled him right in the ribs.\n\nHis manager came storming out of the dugout and yelled "What did you do that\nfor ?"\n\nDrysdale growled back, "What are you complaining for ? I saved you three\npitches !"\n\nIncidentally, if this is true, I'd love to know the other people involved.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTed Kury            | "One man stands... and the wall, cracks... and the wall,  \nSUNY at Buffalo     | cracks... and the wall, cracks... and the wall comes\nDept. of Economics  | crumbling down."                - Anthrax
I forgot to mention that the stats are for games through 4/20.
The problem with your nihilistic approach, Roger, is that it takes all the\nsense out of the game.  By your line of reasoning, if a guy hits into a\ndouble play with one out and the bases loaded, there's no point in saying\nthat that was a bad thing to do (if his team won anyway) or speculating\non what might have happened if things had gone otherwise, so the double\nplay is merely an event that happened in the course of a game that was\neventually won or lost for unknown reasons.  After all, any speculation\ninvolves constructing a fantasy about what would have happened but didn't.\n\nRoger, do you ever worry that the next pencil you drop will fall to the\nceiling instead?  Or are you willing to consider empirical evidence?\n\nTeams go to the post-season when they win more games than anybody else\nin their division.  If they don't make the post-season, they don't win the\nSeries.  Will you agree that winning a division is a useful intermediate\ngoal in ring-collecting?\n\nIf so, you must agree that winning games is a useful intermediate goal\ntowards winning the division, and our disagreements come when we consider\nhow to win games.\n\nIn your viewpoint as expressed, winning games happens for reasons that\ncannot be analyzed.  While many of us are thinking things like "Base-\nrunners are good, outs are bad, and therefore walks are better than\ndouble plays with the bases loaded", you are thinking things like\n"It's a team game, so perhaps the double play will cause some mysterious\nteam dynamics that will cause the team to win today".\n\nThe result is that it becomes impossible to say *anything* about individual\nplayers.  Perhaps Atlanta would have won the Series with me playing left\nfield.  After all, perhaps in some way my knowledge and personality would\nhave helped the team more than my complete lack of skill would have hurt\nit.  Therefore, I could be an extremely valuable player.  Did Dave Winfield\nhave anything to do with the Jays' victory?  Probably, but how do you know?\nIf you replace him with Andres Galarraga, perhaps the Jays would have won,\nperhaps they would have lost, perhaps they would have defected to Alpha\nCentauri (bearing in mind that the flying saucers would not have landed\nin mid-season had Winfield been DHing for Toronto).\n\nWas Babe Ruth a good player?  He played on some WS-winning teams, but did\nhe have anything to do with their success?\n\nIt is generally accepted that Ernie Banks was a good baseball player, and\nJarvis Brown and Dan Schatzeder weren't.  It seems to me that anybody who\nwould deny this needs to provide the proof.\n\nNow, we have observed things about baseball over the years, both empirically\nand by looking at the rulebook.  It is necessary to score more runs than\none's opponent to win the game, so it would seem important to score runs\nand to prevent one's opponent from scoring.  Runs are scored while a team\nis batting, and an inning ends after the third out, so it would seem that\nmaking outs is bad while hitting home runs is good.  Players have tendencies\nto hit or pitch at certain levels, and these are usually somewhat consistent\nfrom year to year.\n\nWe do use these statistics to predict winners, and so do you.  To make\nsome flat predictions:  Barry Bonds will have a higher OBP+SLG than\nGene Larkin this year.  The Braves will finish ahead of the Rockies\nin the standings.  The Tigers will score more runs than the Royals, but\nwill also give up more.  I would be astonished if any of these turned\nout to be false, and, I suspect, so would you.  As a matter of fact, I\nam pretty sure I can predict all the division winners this year, given\n3-4 guesses per division, and this is certainly better than random\nchance (and almost statistically significant).\n\nIf you will admit that the Rockies and Mariners are unlikely to meet in\nthe World Series, you must admit that there is some sort of way to measure\nlikelihoods, however fuzzy.\nSo how about "real life"?  Person A robs a service station with two people\nin it, using a .38 automatic pistol, gets $42, and is convicted and sentenced\nfor three years.  Person B, with a similar criminal record, robs a service\nstation with two people in it, using a .38 revolver, gets $42, and is\nconvicted.  Since they used two different types of handgun, are comparisons\ntotally meaningless?\n\nSay you drop a pencil to see if the gravity still works (my cats are always\ntesting this - they don't trust me to pay the gravity bill on time).  You\nhave never dropped a pencil at that exact time of the century before, so\nall previous evidence is meaningless?  Or would you be surprised if it flew\nout the window instead of hitting the desk?
[detailed explanation deleted..]\n\n\nIndeed, you have struck right at the heart of our disagreement. To \nrebut my opinion, you have made an analogy with a game of chance.\nYour hypothesis assumes that the Lotto players have no impact on\nthe selection of the numbers, and hence their ability to win.\n\nWell, that's certainly true in Lotto.  But it has absolutely\nNOTHING to do with the sport of baseball.  When you start down\nthe wrong path, you finish down the wrong path.\n\n\n\n\n\nI repeat.  I do not think that statistical analysis of prior clutch\nhitting performance is an accurate predictor of future clutch hitting\nperformance.\n\nI do, however, think that analysis of prior clutch hitting performance\nmay, for some players, indicate a deficiency in their game that indeed\nwill provide a basis for projecting their particular future performance.\nAnd I think Chris Sabo is such a player.\n\n\n\n\n--	The Beastmaster
I grew up listening to Harry Carey call the Cardinals' games and\nreally liked him--then. But, as I recall, he was fired because\nhe was too critical (read: honest) when he was announcing. He\ndared to point out the Cards' miscues and such. At least, this is\nwhat I remember from when I was a kid.
Wiggins, Alan?\n\nBut that's besides the point.  I'm sure people would feel slightly\nsympathetic for Rickey if he were killed.  But, they would also be\ncriticizing him a lot more for his actions.\n\nExample?  \n\nHow about Jose Canseco?  He gets a couple of speeding tickets, and all\nof the sudden his attitude is awful.  What the hell do speeding tickets\nhave to do with clubhouse influence anyway?  So why do sportswriters\ntalk about it all the time.\n\nOr Brian Hunter and Keith Mitchell?  Both of whom had DWI problems\ntowards the end of last year.  (Two years ago?)  It was cited as a sign\nof their immaturity, etc.  \n\nMeanwhile, Dykstra almost killed both himself and Daulton, and I didn't\nread any sportswriter complaining about that.  They may have talked\nabout how bad it was for the Phillies, but I NEVER read anywhere\ncriticism of Dykstra's character (or Daulton's intelligence, for that\nmatter) based on this incident.

Be fair.  He did walk 6 batters in 6.1 IP.  He also allowed only three\nhits, none for extra bases.  Only one run.  A pretty good outing, all\ntold.\n\n\nThere is no such thing as a "must win" game this early in the season.\nAnd we can always *hope* that Darwin pitches well!
Disclaimer -- This is for fun.\n\nIn my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called\n"stolen hits", defined as a play made that "an average fielder would not\nmake with average effort."  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted\nby Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive stats\nfor the leftfielders. Hits Stolen have been redefined as "Plays Kevin\nBass would not have made."\n\nOK, I realize that's unfair.  Kevin's probably the victim of pitching staff,\nfluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If we\nreplaced every leftfielder in the league with someone with Kevin's 49.4% out\nmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?\n\nTo try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net\nHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league\naverage fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net Extra \nBases (doubles and triples let by).\n\nFinally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or\nDCON :->.

There are very few disciplines where 100% certainty is necessary to\nstate something as fact.  Baseball is not one of them.\n\nTherefore I can say that I know Clemens was better than Morris last\nyear, and Larkin was better than Griffin.  No, I can't ascertain this.\nI can't prove it.  But I'm not required to do so.\n\nAnd since you obviously feel that such threads are meaningless,\nwhy don't you simply stay out of them?
You want to speed up ballgames?\n\n1.  Enforce the two minutes between innings.  As it is, many fields are\n    allowing THREE minutes between them.  Fifteen seconds before \n    TV commercials are gone to, Thirty or so before action begins upon\n    the return to the game.  Two minutes, last out to first pitch, or\n    a ball is called.\n\n2.  Don't grant time to batters just because they want it.  They may get\n    pissed at first, but they'll get in line, once anything the pitcher\n    throws while they're adjusting their wristbands is a strike.\n\n3.  Mandate a rule permitting only N seconds between pitches (the current\n    rule is too lenient), and then enforce it.  Fifteen seconds is more\n    than enough time.  If the pitch isn't released in 15, call it a ball,\n    and restart the clock.\n\nBaseball games take about 2:51 in the NL, and just a shade under 3 hours\nin the AL.  That's just too damn long.  I don't like to PLAY in 3 hour\ngames, much less WATCH a game for that long.  My butt falls asleep, and\nif I'm watching on TV, I'll channel surf between pitches, catching\ncolorized versions of Mr. Ed, Leave it to Beaver, and "Those Wacky\nNieporents" on Nick at Nite.

Do you have a better e-mail address, Mr. Lurie?  I'm afraid I can't\nget the short version to work.\n\nIn any case, on Winfield.  Yes, his career BA is a mere .285.  He\ndidn't beat this until his sixth year in the majors, and has only\ntopped it once since 1988.  His peak was in the early '80s, and\nincluded some rather impressive seasons.  But then he's also had\nother scattered great performances (like 1988 and 1992).  Definitely\n*not* a smooth career curve!
Did anyone happen to see Peter Gammons on ESPN last night?  He addressed\nthis exact issue, and dismissed it rather quickly.  According to Gammons,\nadvanced scouts are reporting that Morris' fastball and slider still have\nthe same zip and that his problems this year are due to his sudden inability\nto keep the ball hidden during his release.  Guzman and Stottlemyre have\ngone through similar stretches that have been cleared up succinctly by a\nlittle work with the pitching coach.  Gammons looks to see Morris back in\ntop form within the month.\n\nI, on the other hand, still have my doubts.  Morris' ERA last year was\nrather high for a pitcher who won 20 games.  His showing in the Series was\nnot surprising.  Although I'm not convinced that he's washed up, I have my\ndoubts as to whether or not he can ever regain the form he had for the\nTwins in '91.
I plan on being in the Toronto area sometime this summer (late June or\nearly July) and would like to attend a Blue Jay game.  I would\nappreciate if anyone could give me information on how to obtain\ntickets for Blue Jay games.  I would prefer to get good seats and I\nassume this would require going through some ticket broker and paying\n$$$$.  Ticket broker info for the Toronto area and/or ticket info\ndirectly through the Blue Jays would be appreciated (I'll bring oxygen\nif need be.)  My schedule is flexible so any games are candidates\n(though I'd prefer to see Texas.)\n\nThanks in advance.
Well, they just said that Franco will probably go on the DL tomorrow.\n(They mentioned a career minor leaguer as the "warm body" who would go \nalong...I forget.)\n\nAlso, when answering questions about the rotation, Coleman (SD \nbroadcaster) said that Hurst is gone in about a month-month and a half, \nwhich is when he should finish re-hab.\n\nLater\n\nDennis

To encourage the great tradition of Red Sox negativism, I am having a \ncontest to predict the magnitude of the Sox' fall from their current \nheights.  You must decide first, whether the Sox will be at .500 again\nat any time during this year.  Then you must predict either:\n\n(1) Their record the first time they're at .500, if they are, or\n\n(2) Their final record, if they stay above .500 the rest of the year.\n\nSo Valentine's earlier prediction would go as "13-13" (resend it if you \nwere serious, Val!).\n\nESPN pointed out last night that the last Sox start better than this was\nin 1952, when they finished 76-78, in sixth place.\n\nSo email me your guess, either at "barring@cs.washington.edu" or directly\nreplying to this post.\n\nEntries close 5 pm PDT on Wed 28 Apr 1993.
Yep.  And the Ks don't have to denote a slow game, either.  Last night,\nSid Fernandez was mowing the Giants hitters down (14 Ks in 8 innings),\nyet the first 7 1/2 innings of the game were quite brisk.\n\nHe also threw 119 pitches, leading me to believe it isn't just the\nnumber of pitches that determines the length of a game, but the \nbehavior *between* pitches.
Alright, that's enough. I've suffered with all kinds of insults (as\ntypical for the net), but give me a break. Galarraga is currently\nbatting over .400 and you guys are complaining that he isn't drawing\nenough walks.  What would he have to do to please you guys, bat 1.000?\nYou can hardly claim that he is "hurting his team".\n\nIf it happens that the pitchers start throwing him fewer good pitches\nand he starts making lots of outs (as someone speculated might happen),\n*THEN* I would agree with you that he isn't taking enough pitches. My comment\nthat "he isn't paid to walk" doesn't mean that he should have a license\nto swing at bad pitches and make outs; it's more along the lines of: he's\nbatting .400 and leading the league in RBI's so what bloody difference\ndoes it make if he isn't drawing  a lot of walks? Sheesh.
It is ironic that in any post that criticizes langauge ability, the critic\ninvariably makes a mistake himself ("english" is generally written "English".)\n\n\nOddly, I do not see that I have contested any of that. Perhaps you, with \nassuredly greater "english" ability can explain, in tiny words that I might\ngrasp their meaning, precisely WHERE I infer that you have said any of those\nthings? \n\n\nNo Mr Fisher, you should place the burden of proof on the one who makes the\nallegation in the first place. You do not. Perhaps you might explain why that\nis? As for the email route, Mr Fisher, you might have tried that yourself.
Wait a minute.  If I read the rules right. A stike is ANY portion of the ball \nover ANY portion of the plate.\n\n\nGiven that the ball is ~ 2.9 "" in diameter.  This sez that the zone width\nis ~= 17 + (2 * 2.9)  or 22.8 "" . While this is still less than the 23 "\nnumber given.  I can forgive any UMP for misjudging .2" on an object moving\nat 85 to 100 miles per hour many times not in a straight line.\n\nI think the Umpires Union has a great grasp of the rules!!!
Always has been??????\n\nEven before he was even conceived of? That's a neat trick.\n\nAlways will be??????\n\nWe leave a lot of room for error don't we.\n\nHopefully I missed an earlier post that this was with regard to otherwise ...\nwell I leave that to the individual to fill in but I will say what about\nGehrig! (shortened and not capitalized for the ease of the reader)
Some comments deleted for bandwidth (God knows, we need it... :))\n\n  \n  Ok, Roger, here's a question for you.  Say you are running an expansion\nteam.  You don't HAVE a team at the moment, but the draft is coming up.  Who\nare you going to pick, guys who have won the most WS rings, or guys who \nCOULD contribute the most to your team.  Say the Reds were dumb enough to \nnot protect Larkin, and the Jays didn't protect Alfredo.  Who would you\npick?\n\n    (I can't believe I'm getting involved in this... :)\n\n  John
We cannot isolate completely, Roger, but we can make a pretty good\nestimate. I won't claim to split hairs and say that we can really\nmeasure who was better, Robby Alomar or Carlos Baerga, last year; the\ndifference is too close to call. But Larkin and Lee? Clemens and\nMorris? The differences are too great there.\n\nIn your measure of the game, why should a team that has just won it\nall ever replace a single player? Since they are now clearly "best",\nhow can they do better? Yet every team can always find someplace where\nthey beleive they can improve the team; they can always find a player\na little better than one they already have. (BTW, by my definitions,\nthe "best" player is the one who does the most things to help his team\nwin. I will allow that this could vary depending on who else is on the\nteam, by having aptitudes one team needs more than others.)\n\nBaseball is a team game, but it is made of individual talents. It is\nabsurd to judge the success or failure of an individual by the success\nor failure of his teammates, whom he did not choose (at least in most\ncases.) Morris won last year because he played on a team with Joe\nCarter, Robby Alomar, Tom Henke, Juan Guzman, John Olerud, et al.\nClemens lost because he was surrounded by such lesser performers as\nHerm Winninham, Luis Rivera, and Jeff Reardon. To define the quality\nof the team as a sum of its components (as I do, albeit imperfectly)\nis a lesser error than defining the quality of an individual as the\nmean quality of the team (as my reading of your arguments suggests you\ndo)
I agree. I'll delete more as well.\n\n\n\n\nStill, if the 'whispers' reached San Francisco, it is certainly possible they\nwere stronger elsewhere. Also, it was teammates making the aspersions. In any\nevent, I know of no other player to be maligned in the last couple years.\n\n\n\nUh, the original author's point was that black and white players were por-\ntrayed differently by "the media", and towards this, he gave a highly selected\nlist to "prove" his case. Sanders' name showed up eventually. I dispute that\nSanders has ever been called lazy by "the media". \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUh, that poster specifically stated "allow me to be the first". It is NOT a\nquibble, then, to state that "the media" did not portray Canseco as being \nlazy. If the other person chooses to so accuse him, after my post, that does not\nmake it a quibble. And in fact, the media around here tend(ed) to play up his\ntime in the wieght room. Hardly "lazy", and hardly a "quibble". Have you ever\nseen any "mediot" portray Canseco as "lazy"? Unconcerned with his fielding, yes.\nLazy, no.\n\n\nWell, Canseco has been involved in several felonies, including his high-speed\nrecord, carrying concealed fire-arms, and of course the domestic violence. \nClemens had a run-in at a bar. Canseco had that, as well, and in both cases, the\ncoverage was relatively minimal.\n\n\nUh, if the only evidence offered is anecdotal, how can it be objected that the\ncounter to it is also anecdotal?\n\n\nUh, yes, and I agree with your assesment of Boggs, rather specifically. However,\nyou did say "everybody who has ever won a batting title" has been accused of\nselfishness. I have not ever, anywhere, heard this said of Puckett. Pendleton,\neither. Similarly, Brett, B Williams, and others.  \n\n\nThere are others. Perhaps they are simply not as outspoken, except in the\ncase of the "born-again" types I mention.

Another pair of suggestions:\n   1. Remove the Balk rule.  It is the runners responsibility to stay "safe"\n      no matter what the pitcher does.\n\n   2. If a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than X time (X = 3 to 5)\n      without successfully picking off the runner, the runner advances a base\n      as if walked.\n\nThis last suggestion will probably increase the number of stolen bases\nconsiderably.  Suppose the pitcher uses up (N-1) of his N pick-off\nattempts.  The runner can probably stretch his lead off the base,\ngiven that there will be extra pressure on the pitcher to get it\nright this time.\n\nWould this suggestion apply to pick-off attempts per pitch, per\nbatter, or per base runner (on the same base)?\n\n\n--\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDr. Edward J.

You are absolutely correct.  Braves fans are nothing but a bunch of\nbandwagoners.

Fine, are you willing to bet that he will bat .400 the rest of the way?\n\nThe point is that he has hurt the Rockies so far; it's that he *will* hurt\nthem, eventually.  Just as much as he hurt the Expos and the Cardinals the\npast couple seasons.\n\n\nIt has happened for the past 3+ seasons; where have you been?\n\n\nWe'll see come September.  (I have an outstanding bet with someone that\nGalarraga's OBP will be less than .300 on June 1.)
And he pitched many not-so-outstanding ballgames, too.\n\nJack essentially pitched a lot of .500 ball last year.  This certainly\nisn't irrelevant, and iif you replace Morris with replacement level quality\nthe Blue Jays might not win.\n\nRe leadership, I don't see it.  If the leadership effect is there for\na starting pitcher, you would expect to see its primary effect on the\npitching staff.  You would expect to see the rest of the staff improve.\nInstead, the rest of the staff declined.\n\nYou can make a reasonable argument for Winfield providing leadership;\nthe offense picked up considerably from its effectiveness the previous\nyear. I'm not saying I buy that, but at least that argument makes\ninternal sense.\n\nGreg

IMHO this is the most untrustworthy, silly stat, by today's rules, in all \nof baseball.  My understanding is to qualify as a save a pitcher cannot \npitch more than three innings and the potential tying run must at least \nappear in the on-deck circle.  Also, the lead a pitcher enters with cannot \nexcede three runs.\n\nI believe that the official scorers must assert more of their authority in \ndetermining winners/savers/etc.  For instance, a pitcher can come in in the \nninth with a lead, blow the lead, fall behind, have his team come back in \nthe next half inning and earn the win.  Has this pitcher earned a win, no \nway.\n\nI guy could pitch five strong innings of middle relief and see his \nteammates rally to tie the score.  Assume he came in to start the fourth \nand left after the eighth.  His teammate holds the opposition scoreless in \nthe ninth and they score a run in the bottom of the ninth to win.  The \nthird pitcher earns the win and the middle reliever gets no "stat" \nsatisfaction.\n\nMike
With all the recent problems the Indians have been having\nwith their pitching staff I have heard numerous names\nthrown around about who could solve their problem.\n\nOne name I have not heard is Mike Soper (RP).

Pitchers are required to pitch (or feint or attempt a pick-off)\nwithin 20 seconds after receiving the ball, not 15.\n\nPitchers are required to pitch their warm-up throws within a\none minute time frame, beginning after each half inning ends,\nnot two minutes.\n\nAnd the reason why a reliever should be allowed warm-ups is\nsimple: Different mound, different catcher.\n\nRyan Robbins\nPenobscot Hall\nUniversity of Maine
I didn't say that pitcher's fear of throwing strikes to guys like\nMcGwire, Bonds, and Frank Thomas was rational.  \nI just said that it exists.\n\n\nI don't know Alex Cole's batting style at all.   Some questions:\nHow tall is he?\nDoes he go into a crouch like Rickey Hederson/Pete Rose?\nDoes he foul off a lot of pitches like Brett Butler?\nDoes he take 1 or 2 strikes in each at bat?\n\nIt could be the Cole has a good batting "eye".\nLook above, I said that *many* high OBP guys draw their walks because\npitchers are afraid to throw a strike to them, not "all" high OBP guys.
This comes up periodically, and I just don't get it. Take, for example, Mark\nMcGwire. He walked 90 times in 1993. If that's not a potential great example\nof what you're talking about then I don't know what is. Now let's look at\nwhat happens when McGwire doesn't walk:\n  75% of the time he made an out.\n  10% of the time he hit a single.\n  5% of the time he hit a double.\n  10% of the time he hit a homer.\nNow, you're pitching against McGwire. Would you trade 20 walks for 2 homers,\n1 double, 2 singles, and 15 outs? I would. Why give him the base when you\ncan get him out 3 times out of 4?\nThen there are guys like Alex Cole, who has a career .363 OBP even\nthough he's never had a batting average over .300 (he did hit .300 in\n227 AB in 1990) or hit a single home run. Yep, that's right, he's\n*never* hit a homer in 916 AB's through the end of 1992. Who'd be\nafraid to throw a strike to him?\n\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com
I like the Clark-WIlliams-Bonds order.\nPitchers can only walk Clark with 2 outs (unlike last year).\n\nWilliams is getting better pitches to hit with Bonds looming\nin the on-deck circle.  Since Matt has a terrible batting eye,\nthis helps the Giants a lot.\n\nWhen Bonds gets on base all by himself, he can try to steal 2nd\nand then be driven in with a single by Thompson, Manwaring, or Clayton.\n\nIf you bat Bonds before the other sluggers, then you don't want\nhim to run because a "caught stealing" could take you out of a\nbig inning.\n\nAlso Bonds is less in need of protection behind him because he\nis such a good base stealer (a walk is a potential double).\n\nThe only draw back is when Clark and Williams are clogging up the \nbases infront of Bonds... and I think that's a problem the \nGiants will be glad to see especially if Robby Thompson gets hot.
Not to mention that Lankford had been hurt two nights before running\ninto the outfield wall. This being the reason he was available to pinch-\nanything.  His ribs were the problem so he could run but not hit.\nTorre is no white rat but give him credit for what he is , a pretty darn\ngood manager. with the exception of the Felix fiasco, but i'm not sure  \nwho's brainchild that was.\n                       -BIL
I'm a little worried about this pitching thing.  6.08 is scarry even for\nthe first 16 games of the season.  Mesa (sp?) seems to be settling down. \nHe pitched well against the Red Soxs, but The Rocket matched him.  I got a\nchance to watch them play against California Wednesday and he pitched well\nalso.  Then the dam broke.  Wickander came in and promptly it was 6-1.  (3\nrun homer by Snow?).\n\nI heard the guys on ESPN say that 7 of the TRIBE's top 10 prospects are\npitchers.  Anyone out there like to post who these guys are and where they\nare?\nThe TRIBE is on ESPN again tonight against Oakland.

WIP is the REAL home of the Eagles.  Merril Reese and the Birds on\nFM radio...what a joke.\n\nA "classic rock" station at that!  Whats the sports world coming to?
Take a look at the standings. It's REAL easy to get so focussed on \nminutinae and forget that the Giants happen to be in first place. If it's\nworking, you don't SCREW IT UP by changing things, just because you think it\nought to be different.\n\nSome folks like to argue about theoretical details. I prefer to watch teams\nwin. When the Giants slip to third, then we can talk about how to re-arrange\nthe batting order. Until then, I think it's stupid to focus on what's wrong,\nfor the simple fact that IT'S WORKING AS IT IS.\n\n\nIn the majors? I don't follow AL, so I won't comment on "Majors". In the NL,\nif I had my choice of any 1B in the league for my team, it'd be Clark, and\nI'd hit him third. (My fantasy team has both Grace and Murray on it, because\nI've never been able to GET Clark. I'd take any of the three without\nhesitation in real life, but I think Clark is it).\n\nWilliams: Not even close. I much prefer his defense, but when he isn't\nheadcasing it, Matt has a good, solid swing and some real punch. If he drops\nto .230, then he wanders out of cleanup, but according to the latest\nBaseball Weekly, he's hitting .275, and in the last week, hitting .296.\nThat's not exactly chopped liver.\n\nMostly, though, the Giants are winning, and frankly, as long as that\ncontinues, it's rather silly to second-guess their strategy. But evidently,\nsome folks would rather be right than be first.
There is a great book out called "They Also Served" which is about the \nballplayers during WWII.  There is some info on Berg in there.  It also has \ninfo on Pete Gray (one armed outfielder) and other players of the era.  Because\nof the draft many players during the war were those who were exempt from the\ndraft for medical reasons.  There are some very interesting stories in the\nbook. It is very well written and I would suggest reading it to anyone with an \ninterest in baseball.\n\nRob Koffler
Dear Anybody,\n\nI am in Rochester, NY, where people can look at a Rangers-Penguins playoff game and\nsay, no joke I heard it, "Hey whats this, OH, its not even the AHL, its just\nthe NHL, I think."  Because of this e get Red Wings (Orioles AAA) stats and\nupdates but no AL or NL stats.  Specifically Im looking for Red Sox stats so\nfar, Id like all of them, but could handle just Greenwell and Vaughn.  CAN\nANYBODY PLEASE HELP ME!!!!!!!!
Minor point:  Shea Stadium was designed as a multi-purpose stadium but\nnot with the Jets in mind as the tennant.  The New York Football Giants\nhad moved to Yankee Stadium (from the Polo Grounds) in 1958 and was\nhaving problem with stadium management (the City did not own Yankee\nStadium until 1972).  The idea was to get the Giants to move into Shea.\nWhen a deal was worked out between the Giants and the Yankees the\nnew AFL franchise, the New York Titans, approached the City about using\nthe new stadium.  The Titans were playing in Downing Stadium (where the\nCosmos played soccer in the 70s).  Because Shea Stadium was tied into\nthe World's Fair anyway, the city thought it would be a novel idea to\npromote the new franchise and the World's Fair (like they were doing\nwith the Mets).  So the deal was worked out.\n\n\nI'm under the impression that when Murph says it, he means it!  As a\nregular goer to Shea, it is not a bad place since they've cleaned and\nrenovated the place.  Remember, this is its 30th Year!
I'm sure all of you have heard of the extraordiary start by  rookie\nJ.T. Snow of the California Angeles.  Other than the fact that his\nfather was a star receiver with the L.A. Rams and is now a radio\npersonality in Los Angeles and J.T. came from the Yankees organization\nI don't know much about J.T.  If anyone has info and background on \nthe young fenom....please post.\n\nBy the way, for those of you not following his exploits he has hit\nfour home runs in three days.  Two last night.  He has also delivered\nthe winning hit a couple of times for the Angeles in this young season.\n\nThanks...

Yeah, maybe that is more likely.  But from the Mariners-Tigers \nseries, it seems like every time there are base runners, the pitchers \nseem to purposely pitch around him or give him a free pass.  The \nfunny thing was that Griffey was struggling up until the last game of the\nfour game series if I remember correctly.\n\n- Chung Yang
} Last night, Boston Red Sox win its 11 games of 14 games by beating Seattle\n} 5-2.  Roger Clemson pitch not so dominate.  He walked at least 6 man in\n} first 6 inns.  But Valetin and Greenwell hit homeruns and Red Sox prevail.\n\nClemens struggled with his control, but was also the "beneficiary"\nof some pretty shoddy umpiring. but to be fair, most of the walks were\nearly in the game, and he adjusted. he was also helped by (dare i say\nit?) some pretty good defense by the Sox, including Rivera playing\nat second, not his normal position.\n\nactually, Clemens is pretty lucky that he got the win, considering the Sox\nalmost gave up the lead in the bottom of the 7th on Mo's error catching\na throw-over.\n\n} I think that game is must win for Red Sox in Seattle, considering Darwin will\n} faced Seattle ace Randy Johnson tonight.\n\nmust win? in April?\nthey've already won 4 more games so far than anyone thought they would at this \npoint of the season... i hope people aren't getting too caught up\nin this streak; it's been fun, but teams have 11-3 streaks all the time,\nand it is only when they are at the start of the season that they get\nso much attention.
Hey, Bosio threw a no-no what the hell a Red Sox fan\ngoing to say to that. Heck...Remeber Matt Young last year? ICK..
I believe Acker got a ring from his wife when they were married\n\n \n\n\nI don't know why you guys keep bickering about Morris. The stats show he\nis a mediocre pitcher at best (this year is another case), he just happened\nto win 21 games. I saw many of his games last year, he did pitch some good\ngames. But this crap about being a clutch pitcher is nonsense, he was \nconstantly giving up go ahead runs in the 6-8th innings (the clutch innings)\nand the Jays would somehow scrape a win for him. Another major factor in\nhis 21 wins, is that Cito 'I dont realize i have a bullpen' Gaston would\nleave Morris in for ever, therefore giving him many more chances to win\ngames (i believe this is the major reason he won 21 games last year).\n\n\nBarry Walker\nBNR \nOttawa\nCanada
You're definitely correct in that Williams absolutely has to be sandwiched\nin between Clark and Bonds.  He must, and I mean MUST, get fastballs to\nhit...otherwise he becomes little more than Sixto Lezcano in disguise.\nWhat I would suggest is perhaps batting Bonds, Williams, and Clark\n3-4-5, the reason being that I feel Bonds' potential basestealing\nabilities are wasted when he's stuck behind two slow runners.\nI think the chance of getting 20-30 extra stolen bases with Bonds in the\n3 spot would more than offset any drop in in run production by having \nClark in the 5 spot.
I wonder why you say that?  I don't see why having a spouse and/or\nkids would have anything to do with it.  It might if you brought\nyour kids to the game and wanted them to get home in time to get\nto bed at a reasonable hour (in which case I'd probably decide\nto take my kids to games on weekends, as many people do, or else\nbe prepared to leave the game early), but from what you say later\non, you don't bring your kids *or* your spouse to the game.\nAs it happens, I have a husband but no kids, and my husband usually\nattends games with me.\n\n\nI can see it's a problem if you don't bring your wife to the ballgame,\nbut that's a problem even if the game goes a trim 2 1/2 hours.  As far\nas bagging work the next day, I don't really understand why that's\nnecessary, unless going to a game also means that you consume vast\nquantities of beer (I note that this is the case for many guys).\nIf you don't think you can get up to go to work after a long evening\nout, then don't have long evenings out during the week.\n\n\nLook: if I pay between $8.00 and $20.00 apiece for tickets, plus $10.00 \nfor parking, plus spending my time and energy driving to and from Boston, \nplus spending additional money on concessions etc. at the ballpark, then \nI see going to a game as a considerable investment of time and money.\nI can't afford to go to a lot of games.  Hence, going to a game is a\nbig deal, like going to a play or an opera.  Maybe you have more money than \nI do and can go to games all year long, so it's not such a big deal for you.  \nBut I'm not interested in having games "sped up", any more than I want to\nhave _Die Walkure_ cut down to a convenient "weeknight version" of two\nhours.  If I felt that going to a night game during the week would interfere \nwith my family life or my work life, then I'd choose to go to a weekend game.\n\nIMPO.
DON MATTINGLY IS THE BEST FIRST BASEMAN IN THE HISTORY OF BASEBALL.....ALWAYS\nHAS BEEN.....ALWAYS WILL BE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yes - Everyone seems to be in agreement that the Yankees are \nfinally moving in the right direction.  They should finish\nover .500 this year and maybe even be in the pennent race \nin August.  However, I would take back a few moves:\n\n1.  The Jim Abbott Trade.\n    I think Abbott is not only an inspirational person, but a\n    great pitcher also.  He could win the Cy Young this year, \n    but he won't because the right side of the Yanks infield\n    isn't good enough.  So why was this not a good trade?  \n    JT Snow.  How many rookies have been able to step in and\n    immediately have the impact that he has had so far on \n    the Angels?  I know it's early, but if you've seen this kid\n    hit, field or talk you can just tell that he is going to be \n    a tremendous player.  The Yanks should have kept him.  What\n    about Mattingly, you ask?  Well - it's great that the Yanks\n    have taken care of him and remained loyal, but he's 10 years\n    older than Snow and just doesn't have the same bat speed as\n    before his back injury.  It's a shame, but as a Yankee fan \n    who wants to see the *best* Yankee team, I'd take \n    Snow over Mattingly at first.  The Yanks also gave up two\n    promising propects with Snow for Abbott.  Besides, with\n    Domingo Jean, Brien taylor, Wickman, Militello, and Sterling\n    Hitchcock, they are just loaded with propects.  I know Abbotts\n    only 26, but this was too much to give up.  I believe George\n    forced this trade because he believes (and he's right) that\n    Abbott will be a big hit in NY.  However, I'd like to see the\n    Yankees build a baseball team, not an amusement show.\n\n2.  Wade Boggs.\n    I live in Boston and like Wade a lot.  But, his career is \n    winding down and I would rather see the Yanks start to develop\n    a long term solution (i.e. Hensley Muelins, Russ Davis, Velarde?).\n    Besides, Wade just doesn't have any range.  What a shame about\n    Charlie Hayes, huh?\n\n3.  Spike Owen.\n    See Wade Boggs.  I'd much rather see them develop Dave Silvestri\n    or whoever.  Wade and Spike next to each other in the infield is\n    going to raise the Yankee staff ERA 1/2 point.  And these guys\n    are on the down sides of their careers.\n\n4.  Danny Tartabull.\n    Yes - he's put up some tremendous numbers and it's nice to think\n    about what he could do if he were ever healthy all year.  But he\n    never is.  We should expect 120 games max out of him.  Meanwhile,\n    Gerald Williams is playing at Columbus and Paul O'Neil is playing\n    left field!  I believe O'Neil led NL outfielders in assists\n    last year - and Tartabull is a poor defensive outfielder.\n\nWhat I'm basically getting at is the Yanks are moving in the right\ndirection but are NOT ready to win a pennent this year.  They should\n(at the GM level) be planning for a 1994 or 1995 world series.  This\nmeans getting the younger players experience in the majors NOW so they \nwill be ready in a year or two.  \n\nI'm afraid that all this stuff wreaks of George Steinbrenner.\nCertainly, the Boggs deal was all George.  It looks like George is\nplanning the right mix of veterans and young players to win a world\nseries now.  The veterans are always available and can be added at any\ntime (like Boston did this year).  Develop the young players first,\nthen add the one or two veterans (or in the Yankees case, just keep\nthem).  Let's all us Yankee fans hope that George doesn't dismantle\nthe terrific job Stick and company have done building the Yankee\norganization back into one of respect.  I'm really afraid that he will\ntrade whoever it takes to patch holes today (relief pitching for\nexample).  George must realize that the Yankees rebuilding process is\nstill one or two years away.  Have patience George and we will all\nenjoy the future.  Fire Bucky and trade the kids and it's baseball\nhell for all loyal Yankee fans for a long time!
Tickets are very hard to get, even at the box office at Camden Yards.\nIf you really want to see a game here (I go to school in Baltimore),\nprice should not be an issue. Tickets go up to $15, but you should be willing\nto go as high as $20-25 if you really want to come.
But why McGwire, and not Carter?  I can see some justification for Bonds or\nThomas, because they tend to have higher batting averages, but the major\ndifference I see between McGwire and Carter is that Carter doesn't draw\nwalks.  Why aren't pitchers afraid to throw strikes to Carter?
My father is a huge Tiger fan, and I am a loyal Blue Jay fan, who endured the collapse of 87, the heartbreak of 85.  \n\nI don't have the stat book, so let's throw them out.\n\nFirst of all, Morris in his heyday (81-88) vs Clemens (86-present).\n\nHow many Cy Youngs does Morris have?\n\nHow many Cy youngs does Clemens have?\n\nBallparks and such... Fenway average pitchers park.  Detroit, hugh hitters\nparadise.   \n\nMorris is a great team pitcher, sort of in the Doug Drabek mold.  \nIf Morris's team needs a well pitched game, as in Minn in 91, Morris\nsnaps the ball, and throw for Ks.  Otherwise, he just tries to get people out.\n\nAs for Clemens, in the Elias Stat Book of 1992, I believe\nthat Clemens has the best lifetime record for his team, as compared to\nwhen he doesn't pitch.  How bad would the Red sox have been last year\nwithout him?  Can you say 92 Phillies?\n\nI believe Clemens is the better pitcher because of more power, and hsi\ngreat tenacity.  Morris is among the guttiest pitchers I;ve ever seen,\nbut Clemens is in a class with Seaver, Carlton, etc.
Minor correction: Hartley came in the West trade to Phily.  Deshaies signed\nas a free agent ($1.7M over 2 years).  He pitched for San Diego last year.\n-- \nRegards,
the owners are whining about baseball not being popular among a\nlarge enough portion of the population, and have suggested various\n"remedies", such as shortening the game or trying to convince us that\n"smoke'embake'emdominatebysheerintimidation" is an accurate description\nof what is, essentially, a laid-back game.\n\nforget those lame ideas.  here is my new and exciting two-point plan to\ngenerate interest in baseball among the masses.\n\npoint one: sex.\npoint two: violence.\n\nlet's face it, sex and violence are the only things that sell in\namerica.  here's how we can implement them in the game:\n\nsex: cheerleaders, cheerleaders, and more cheerleaders.  dancing on top\n     of the dugouts.  bringing hot dogs to the umps during the seventh\n     inning stretch.  running up and down the stands.  (the south bend\n     white sox actually do this).\n\nviolence: baseball players are such utter wuss boys.  the pitcher beans\n     the batter, and both benches empty in what is called a "bench-clearing\n     brawl".  EVERYBODY JUST STANDS THERE AND LOOKS AT EACH OTHER. stand,\n     stand, stand.  look, look, look.  ho, hum.  then, the bullpens\n     come running in.  when they reach the "fight", they just stand\n     there, too.\n\n     anybody coming off the bench who does not throw at least one punch\n     should be suspended and fined.  further, the bullpens should fight\n     it out in the outfield, so as not to waste time and energy running\n     to the infield.\n\nfootball: sex, violence.\nbasketball: sex, violence.\nhockey: violence.\nbaseball: "da pastime of da nayshun!" - yawn.
DJ was a popular player in San Diego, Derek Bell was not faring well in the\nclubhouse at Toronto, so no matter how bad he looks now I still think it\nwas a steal for the Jays just from the perspective of team chemistry.\nNo statistic can describe it (sorry statheads) and since there are so many\nnew faces in the clubhouse I think the Jays are still trying to find it.\n\n(Insert the same comment into the Jack Morris v. Clemens WS Ring string)\n\nYet at first I was sad to see Derek go, still anticipating all of the talent\nthey raved about at the beginning of last season.  I'm glad to see him\nfaring well for the Padres though.

Sorry, Sherri, but I can't agree with this particular incident.  While\nI'm all for cutting down the number of chain-rattles and other examples\nof rampant Hargroving, there was a difference here.\n\n1)  Since time immemorial, batters have complained about calls.\nSo have pitchers and catchers.  Usually, nothing happens.\nUnless the league notified teams this year about not allowing\ncomplaints, Hirschbeck was acting against expectations.\n\n2)  It's not as if Gant was "in Hirschbeck's face".  Gant said\nsomething about the call, stepped out of the box, and turned away\nfrom Hirschbeck.  As a hitter (alibet of little consequence, but\nwith a decent eye), whenever receiving the short end of the stick\non a questionable call, I'd want a moment or two out of the box,\nif for no other reason than to rethink the strike zone based on\nthe experience of the last pitch.  And if I was really angry\nat the ump, I'd rather turn away and catch my breath than\nturn to him and say something that might get me tossed,\nespecially at a key moment in the game.\n\nWhen Gant turned away, Hirschbeck IMMEDIATELY motioned for Gant\nto step into the box.  IMO, at this point in time, Hirschbeck\nwas determined to show Gant exactly WHO was in charge of this game.\nGant wasn't dawdling; he hadn't had a chance to dawdle.  And Hirschbeck\nwas simply exercising a power play.  Gant resisted, as many of\nus might to what we thought was an unreasonable request, and\nHirschbeck called for the pitch.  At that point, Cox came out on\nthe field, the pitch was thrown, and many other Braves left the\ndugout.  Cox was tossed "protecting his player".  I was pleasantly\nsurprised that Gant kept his cool enough to stay in the game.\n\nIt's a small sample size, but based on what I saw in that game,\nMark Hirschbeck has a hair-trigger temper and a need to play\nGod on the field.  Not good qualities for an umpire.  I will\nkeep my eyes open for future appearances of Hirschbeck in the \nfuture, in order to improve my sample size.\n\nIMO, any game where you remember the name of the umpire was\na bad game for the umpire.
Hi- Does anybody know the # for ticket info for Fenway?\n\nThanks
Jason Lee asks:\n\nYou must have heard wrong.  His arm is still sore.  He hasn't gone on the DL,\nbut he may.  Managmenet is treating him as a day-to-day situation.  \n\nHis doctors thought that he was ready, and they had him throw in\nColorado, but his arm wasn't up to the strain.  He is throwing every day,\nbut he's just not quite ready to pitch full strength yet.\n\n(This is based on an interview that he gave on WFAN NY radio on Thursday,\n4/23)
[...]\n\nThe events I saw were:\n1)  Called strike by Hirschbeck\n2)  Shocked-looking Gant asks for appeal to first\n3)  No appeal to first\n4)  Gant steps out of batters box.\n5)  Hirschbeck *immediately* orders Gant back in.  [bad move]\n6)  Gant ignores Hirschbeck and walks off. [bad move]\n7)  Hirschbeck yells at Gant.  Gant is silent.\n8)  Hirschbeck calls for the pitch.\n9)  Pitch is called a strike.\n10)  Cox argues (couldn't see when he came on the field)\n11)  Cox is ejected, players everywhere\n12)  Play finally resumes.\n\nGant shouldn't have ignored Hirschbeck.  Not returning made the strike\ncall fairly likely.  Although I suspect an argument might have gotten\nGant tossed altogether.  But if Hirschbeck had let Gant step out, the\nwhole incident probably would have been avoided.\n-- \nDale J. Stephenson |*| (steph@cs.uiuc.edu) |*| Baseball fanatic
The major problem with this analysis is that it ignores age.  Even if\nMorris were performing as well as Clemens right now, and were likely to\nthis season, nobody would trade Clemens for Morris straight up because\nClemens has more of his career left.
Not totally true.  For the past year or two, the AP has been getting box\nscores from STATS, Inc.  The AP representative in the press box is actually\na STATS reporter ($25 dollars a game, but free parking.  And anybody can\ndo it.)  The box is downloaded to STATS in Chicago, some quick error \nchecking is done, and then STATS sends it to the AP.  I'm not sure where\nthe appreveiations come in hear.  I don't think it is at STATS's.  It may\njust be a space correction by the AP sports editor that day. \n\nWhile I'm mentioning STATS reporters, they are always looking for new\npeople.  Especially if you live in Cleveland or Pittsburgh, you're road\nto getting into the press box may be real short.  For more info, call \nSTATS (708) 676-3322, and ask about the reporter network.  It's a fun\nway to get paid for watching baseball games.\n\nEnd of public service announcement.
It's me again!
Just wanted to let all the people who e-mailed me about \na possible Cardinals mailing list that I wasn't able to\nget the OK to host the list here so someone else will\nhave to do it. :-(\n\nMany thanks to Bob Netherton for his helpful info.
Even I noticed that Gant's demeanor was not one of a batter\nattempting to regain his concentration.  Gant was stalking off.\nI wonder if Gant said something to the ump?\n\n\nActually, there was a small hand wave by Gant...as if to say\n'Don't bother me'. Gant may have said something here, too.\n\n\nCox was already halfway to the ump when the strike was called.\n\n\nMy impression was that Gant was not 'stepping out.'  He was making\na protest about the lack of an appeal to first.  As has been\npointed out earlier, there is no appeal to first on a strike.\nI can understand Gant feeling a little pressure in a two-out,\nRISP, 1 - 0 game, ninth inning.  He let it get to him.  The ump\nalso overreacted.  Gant was stalking off, but I doubt he would\nhave been gone long.  Hirschbeck should have let him have a\nmoment to compose himself before telling him to come bat.\nIMHO, umpires should be more flexible than what Hirschbeck\nshowed.  Gant was disturbed to the point it was pretty likely\nhe would not get a hit.\n\nA very bad finish to a pretty good game.
The Phillies have won two games back to back in extra innings.  Last\nnight's game was hard fought.  The game in Chicago should have been a\nblow out.  All in all these two games show a different Phillies team.\nIn past seasons they tended to always be on the short end of 1 run\ngames.  I don't know how many times I saw them losing by only 1 run.\nIf they were able to win most of those, they might have been more of\na contending team.  They are 3-0 so far in extra innings.  And of\ncourse, they are 10-3.
Lou Gehrig, IRONMAN
You started it...\n\n\nYou most certainly did!\n\n\nSabo is clearly a better hitter than Samuel.  Yet you would pinch-hit\nSamuel because you predict that Samuel will be a clutch hitter and\nSabo will be a choke hitter.  Right?  I'd call that "predicting the\nfuture".\n\n\nRight.  I would have used aspects of prior performance which have been\nshown to be consistent in the past.  Overall performance, L/R splits,\neven matching hitting/pitching styles.  All of these will give me some\nadvantage if used properly.\n\nEVEN IF ALL ELSE WERE EQUAL, there would be no advantage gained by\nlooking at past clutch performance.  And in this case, everything else\npointed to Sabo.\n\n\nThat comes down to the same thing.  When Perez left Sabo in, he\nwas predicting the future, the next AB.  He was predicting that\nSabo was more likely to get a hit than Samuel.\n\nBy supporting the swap, you are predicting the opposite.\n\n\nWell, yes.  You are aware of its existance.  You claim to be incapable\nof understanding it (though I suspect you are simply unwilling).  Yet\nyou rather forcefully state the opposite.  You don't seem to think the\nwork is worth reading (yet you obviously feel the topic is important).\nI'd say this is insulting.\n\n\nRIGHT!  This is the beef.  It has not proven to be an indicator of\nfuture performance under *any* circumstances.  At least none that\nwe've been able to come up with.  If you know of some where it *is* an\nindicator of future performance, please let us in on your secret.\n\n\nMost certainly.  As I have repeatedly stated, if you can come up with\na study which even *hints* at a consistent clutch ability, I would\nlove it!  However the straightforward attempts at such a study have\nall failed miserably.\n\n\nWell, it was a stupid argument.  (Are you honestly debating that???)\nSure, we know Sabo didn't get a hit.  We have no idea whether Samuel\nwould have done any better or not.  One AB most certainly doesn't\nprove anything!\n\n\nIs this simply a prediction for Chris Sabo for this year?  Or is this\na prediction for *all* batters who have, over the past few years, hit\n(xxx amount?)  worse in the clutch than overall?\n\nIf you mean the first, then as you say, we'll just have to wait and\nsee.  But the second is a much stronger statement.  In fact, it\nsuggests a rule.  We can then test this rule on past data to see if it\nworked for recent years.  I think you will agree that if the rule\ndidn't work last year or the year before, that it is unlikely to do\nany better this year.  Right?\n\n\nI'm not going to get into case analysis.  Sure, you can find somebody\nwho hit poorly from '89-'91 and then hit poorly in '92 as well.  You\ncan also find those who hit poorly from '89-'91 and then hit *well* in\n'92.\n\n\nGambler's fallacy.  Unless there is reason to expect consistency, a\nrun proves nothing.  Can you give us a reason to expect clutch BA to\ncorrelate from one year to the next?  I've seen a detailed study of\nwhy I *shouldn't* expect it to correlate.\n\n\nThe "stupid" was in reference to a statement which *was* stupid.  (And\nI don't see how you can deny it.)  As for "total idiot"?  Yes.  If you\nprove yourself unwilling to even *consider* evidence that might\nsuggest that you are wrong, I would say the term fits nicely.\n\nSo tell me?  Does the term fit?  Or do you have an open mind?
Er..yes.  If Manny Lee was on your team last year, your team would have been\nthe Toronto Blue Jays.\n\n\nAgain.  If Manny Lee was on your team last year your team would not have been\nthe Albuquerque Leftturns.  It would have been the Toronto Blue Jays.\n\n\nThat's the whole point isn't it?  Clemens didn't get a ring but Morris did.\n\n\nExactly.  And Morris was part of the team.  Would the Jays have won with \nClemens?  We will never know.  But we do know that the Jays won with Morris.\nSo how could you possibly say that Clemens had a better year?  No pitcher\nin baseball could have had a better year than Morris had last year.\n\n\n--
Someone on the minor league mailing list probably does. \n\n\nI do, but I don't have time to type the whole thing in (I don't mind looking\nup specific date ranges or individual games when I can, but there are\nlimits). \n\nBesides, this stuff is EASY to find. Baseball America puts out a book called\nthe Directory. It's $10(US). Has every team's data and schedule in it. If I\nWERE to type in the whole scheudle, I'd just be spending a lot of time\ninfringing on their copyright.\n\nFolks who are interested in the minors should check out my minor league list\n(see the signature), and folks who are tracking down team schedules should\nchec out the BA Directory. You can order it from 800-845-2726. I find it\nindispenable.
Stole 300 bases.  (Ok, he's still light-hitting, but baseball managers don't\nthink so, they think he, like Omar Moreno before him, is a perfect leadoff\nman.  Awesome defense.)\n\n\nHe's still around because of his 1986, when he hit 20 HR.\n\n\nHasn't played 10+ years in the bigs.  Wasn't a full-time major-leaguer\nuntil 1988.\n\n\nConsistent .300 hitter.\n\n\nWe'll see if he's still around in 1994 for his tenth year.\n\n\nSame goes for Herm.\n\n\nDoesn't count then.\n\n\nRedus is hardly light-hitting, plus he stole 300 bases.  Close to\n800 OPS career against LHP.\n\n\nWe'll see if he's still around in 1995 to qualify.\n\n\nSlugged .416 to .440 for three straight years in one of the worst hitters'\nparks in the NL.  He's going to be one of Colorado's better players this\nyear.  Plus, to make ten you have to count all the time he spent in Denver\nand Buffalo and Hawaii while with the White Sox.\n\n\nColeman, assuming he makes it to 1994, was never perceived as being\nweak offensively, though of course he was.  Led NL in SB his first six\nyears in the majors.\n\n\nWe'll see if he's still around in 1997.\n\n\nWilson has always been overrated, but hit .300 five times in a six-year\nstretch and led the league in triples five times.  But we can count him\nif he's still playing in 1994, though it'll be because he's Otis Nixon\ndeluxe with slightly worse defense.\n\n\nOkay, if he's in the league this year, he can count, though he's also\nin the majors because of Otis Nixon syndrome.\n\n\nHe's not spectacular, but he's neither light-hitting nor a ten-year man.\n\n\nHalfway there, and unlikely to make it 3/4 of the way there.\n\n\nBrock suffered from Otis Nixon disease, but he wasn't perceived as\nlight-hitting.  Neither was Curt Flood.  Cesar Cedeno was *not* light-\nhitting.\n\n\nHe'll have to steal a lot more bases.
Viola has only played in the NL with the Mets -- not possible for him\nto have defeated or lost to every team.  Ditto for Tanana who was mentioned\nin a previous post.\n\n\n	I don't remember if Seaver managed to get a win against the White Sox\nin his brief sojourn with Boston so I'd say the other pitcher to defeat every\nteam is either Mike Torrez (he bounced around enough for a long enough period\nof time) or Koosman as mentioned.  I would also guess that if one of these\ntwo did not manage to beat every team he did manage to lose to every team.\n\nTom

I remember a post from last year indicating that a "pitch clock" was tried\nin one of the minor leagues some time back and did not work.  I don't remember\nwhy they said that it did not work.  Anyone remember this?\n\nJody McDonnel on WIP in Phil. has been saying that a pitch clock was\ninevitable.  How would a pitch clock work on throws to first?\n\nAnother pair of suggestions:\n1. Remove the Balk rule.  It is the runners responsibility to stay "safe"\n   no matter what the pitcher does.\n\n2. If a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than X time (X = 3 to 5)\n   without successfully picking off the runner, the runner advances a base\n   as if walked.\n\nThe no-balk seems to give the pitcher the advantage.  The base-walk allows\nthe runner to "challenge" pitcher to throw over to the base.\n\n\nI too, find myself surfing when I know that it will be enough time between\neach pitch to allow the batter to adjust his "jewlery".
That's the trouble: *what* peak years?  He wavers between excellent and\nvery good, with no real bell-shaped pattern in there.  1979 was a fine\nyear; 78 and 80 were merely really good.  With the Yankees, 84 (I think)\nwas the best; that was the one with the .340 BA.  \n\nOf course, 1992 wasn't bad, either.  He's been in the bigs since 1973,\nwith a one-year intermission for surgery.  Though he doesn't have the\nmix of skills that Pete Rose did, he's like Pete Rose in one way: he's \nnot a natural hitter.  Winfield's swing used to be the ugliest thing\nin New York, and that includes the Gulf+Western Building.  But his sheer\nathletic prowess and physical size made up for a lot.  \n\nFascinating player to watch, even now.  Not obviously great in any one\nway; but able to do quite a few things in surprising ways and at surprising\nlevels.
[Some discussion about whether Elias is money grubbing deleted]\n\n\n\n\n\nSome thoughts and facts,\n\n1.)  Bill James is a partial owner of STATS, inc.  However he has almost\nnothing to do with the day-to-day operations of the company, although he\ndoes have significant input into the design of the books that bear his name.\n(The handbook, but not the scoreboard).  To the best of my knowledge, the\nonly things that Bill actually writes for STATS are the predictions section\nof the handbook, and the Bill James Fantasy Baseball rulebook.\n\n2.) The debate over Elias goes way back.  Bill James' early stuff was hampered\nby the fact that Elias would not give access to their stats at any price.\nProject Scoresheet, and later, STATS were founded to fill this void.  You\ncan call STATS, and ask them for a report on just about anything in their\ndatabase, and they will provide it -- for a price, of course.  Or you could\njust log into their online system and look at the data yourself.  Having\nattempted to pry numbers from Elias in the past (football, not baseball), they\njust don't do that.  In STATS eyes, the high ground comes from making the\ninformation available at all.\n\n3.)  That being said, I'm pretty dissapointed by Bill's book this year, too.\nI am given to understant that it was mostly a response to the publishers \ndesire to have the book come out sooner than April.\n\nHope this makes things just a little bit clearer.\n\n(Bias alert.  I am a former part-time employee of STATS.)
The Babe and The Pride of the Yankees offer very different renditions of\nthe sotry about Ruth and Gherig hitting home runs for the boy in the\nhospital.  Can some historian out there explain "history's" version of the\nstory.  \n\nI wouldn't put is past either (or both) of the movies to season the truth\nwith a little extra spice.\n\nAny other comments as to inaccuracies in these two movies?\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nEric A.

bleagh! this was a terrific trade.  snow will certainly be better than\nmattingly in the future, but that they'll be about the same now is a\ndefensible opinion.  abbott is one of the few truly great pitchers in\nthe game today.\n\n\ni'm not sure about this one.  i think that it's good, in that a\npre-1992 boggs kicks hayes/meulens/whoevers' ass, and that a 1992\nboggs still isn't ALL that shabby.  it's bad, though, that the\nyankees expect a pre-1992 boggs, and will probably get a 1992 boggs.\nhowever, i'd still play boggs over hayes or bam bam.\n\n\nyou have my full agreement here.  he's not all that much better than\nvelarde, and silvestri is just about a lock to be better than him.\nhowever, i do enjoy the fact that "spike" is not a nickname.\nnot that this helps the yankees.\n\n\ni strongly disagree.  i'd much much rather have a hundred games of\ntartabull and sixty games of dion james than 162 games of james.
Tim Belcher pitched a dandy three-hit shut-out tonight as Cincinnati won \ntheir second straight 5-0.  Pittsburgh Lefty Randy Tomlin was hit early and \noften by the heavily right-unbalanced Reds line-up, which managed some\nrecently rare power with their bats.\n\nBelcher (1-1) was solid throughout and in fact seemed to get stronger as the\ngame progressed.  Early on he had several three-ball counts, but even those\nwere few and far between later on as he allowed only one base-on-balls while\nstriking out nine.  In a post game interview he said his change-up was working\nfor him--I should say so:  all nine of his strikeouts were apparently on \nbreaking balls.\n\nTomlin (0-1), on the other hand was in trouble early, giving up a second-pitch\ndouble to lead-off batter Bip Roberts.  Bobby Kelly followed with a single and \nBarry Larkin scored Roberts with a sharp single to right.  The big guys\n(Mitchell, Sabo, Milligan) were unable to get anything after that--in fact\nthey all struck out--but Kelly managed a score anyway due to a double-steal\nand a Tomlin wild pitch.\n\nIn fact, it appeared that Tomlin was going to recover nicely from his shaky\nstart-- he retired 9 of the next 11 batters to get to the fourth behind only\n2-0.  Randy Milligan, though, had different ideas as his line-shot was\npoorly played by Orlando Merced and turned into a triple.  Milligan would \nlater score on Reggie Sanders' sacrifice fly, giving Cinci the 3-0 lead \nafter 4.\n\nThe fifth inning spelled loss for Tomlin when Roberts led off with his second\ndouble of the game, and one batter later Larkin smacked a double down the \nleft field line, chasing Tomlin.  Barry later would score the final run on\nTom Prince's two-base passed ball.  \n\nThe Pirates managed their only threat of the day in the bottom half of the\nfifth when Merced and Kevin Young hit back-to-back singles (the second \nbeing of the "bunt" variety), but Carlos Garcia struck out, Prince fit a \nfoul fly, and pinch-hitter Lonnie Smith "K'd" to end any Pittsburgh hope.\n\nPittsburgh pitchers backed Tomlin up well, though:  relievers Blas Minor,\nMoeller (sp?), and Nagel gave up only two hits in their four-plus innings\nwork.\n\nBarry Larkin left the game in the seventh when the grounder he (mis)played \nbruised his right thumb.  He was taken to the hospital for "precautionary\nX-rays".  Let's hope he's OK.\n\nCincinnati is now 4-9, still the worst record in the majors, but with the\ntwo wins they may be looking at  moving out of the cellar!\nPittsburgh is now 7-6.\n\n*********REDS FANS***************************\nIf you would like to receive this report on a \nsemi-daily basis (as often as I write it), \nsend me your e-mail address and I'll put you \non the list.

According to an article in the LA Times, Todd Worrell will not\nbe ready to come off the DL list Friday.  It sounds like\nhe has had another set back in his come back.  At present,\nhe has stopped throwing the ball.  Supposedly, he had\nno velocity.  It doesn't sound like there is any particular\ntime table at this point for when he will be back.
^^^^^^^\n        ^^^^\nPlease pardon my ignorance if this is well known, but what is the current \nrule? \n\n\n\nMaybe we could limit the number of throws to first that the pitcher can make,\nand award a balk if he exceeds it.  I'd have another question:  who would \noperate the pitch clock?  One of the umpires?  Add another one to the crew?\n\n\nI'm not sure I like this idea.  I think it would severely diminish the \nnumber of stolen bases and limit the availability of such neat strategic\nploys as the hit and run and the squeeze play (one of my personal favorites).\n\n\nAhhh!  I suppose I should read the whole article before I hit the 'f' key,\neh?  Obviously, from what I wrote above, I like this idea.\n\n\nIt may also increase the number of wild throws to the bag, since the \npitcher knows he doesn't have very many chances to pick off the runner,\nso he may hurry too much.  I'd rather see runs scored as the result of \nsound hitting and sound baseball strategy rather than on the sloppiness\nthat could result from this kind of rule.  So, I suppose there are some\ndisadvantages to that idea too.\n\n\n\nI remember in little league, if when up to bat we stepped out of the batter's\nbox, even for a moment, we were automatically out.  That may be a little \nharsh for the majors, but seriously, how about putting a limit on the \nbatters being able to step out, take several dozen practice swings, pound\ntheir shoes, scratch their balls, etc.?  Maybe forcing them to stay in the\nbatter's box wouldn't be such a bad idea.  That could save a few minutes.
On a cold, damp night last night at Tiger Stadium, Dave Wells, David Haas, Bob \nMacDonald, and Mike Henneman combined for a 3-1 victory over the Texas\nRangers.  Here are the highlights:\n\n\n            R     H     E\nTexas       1     4     1\nDetroit     3     5     0\n\nWells gets the win, he's now 3-0 with an ERA just under 1, and Henneman gets\nhis third save in three chances.  Ken Rogers started for the Rangers and \ngets the loss.  He was relieved by Burns in the 7th.\n\nThe Rangers got their only run on a solo home run by Dean Palmer in the 7th.\nThe Tigers opened the scoring with an RBI single by Fryman in the 3rd, then\ntook the lead for good in the bottom of the seventh when Whitaker greeted\nreliever Burns with an RBI double which scored Tettleton.  Whitaker in turn\ncrossed the plate on an RBI single by Phillips (who has been red hot) for \nthe third Tiger run.\n\nThis afternoon, it's another battle of southpaws, Bill Krueger for the Tigers\nvs. Craig Lefferts for the Rangers.\n\n--Randy
There's a blurb in the STATS Scoreboard about this, and though I don't have\nthe book with me here, my memory is that the best at hitting sac flies were\nfar below this 60% number.
That'll teach me not to qualify my statements...\n\n\nOK, something to shoot for.  The Royals will score 531 runs or less\nthis season (although they just decided to get McRae out of the\nleadoff spot :-( )\n\nOf course, Valentine will throw this one back in my face when the\nRoyals even manage to outscore another AL team.\n\n\nSean
I've seen it as "Colmn" also.\n\nBlame the Associated Press.  After the official scorer balances the\nofficial score card, they copy it and give it to several diffent people. \nOne of those is a person from AP whose job it is to type it up (using a\ntemplate on a laptop) and transmit it to the AP offices in New York\n(Rockefeller Center) via the telephone.  The box scores are not checked\nand just rebroadcasted over AP's news delivery services.  If there are\ncorrections, those are issued later.  It is the person sitting in front\nof a laptop at Shea (or whereever) whose fault that is.  [NOTE: The AP\nputs out boxscores in three different formats with the one you see in\nmost newspapers being the first one]\n\nLast week they were in Denver.  Maybe the AP person in Denver did this\n(remember, they just started with MLB out there).  Check tomorrow's\npaper (4/21) and see if the person who is doing it from Shea does the\nsame thing.
Yes, but\n\n	(a) we were talking about peak level, not career averages\nand\n	(b) Clemente was the best fielding RF of all time, as far\n	    as anyone can tell\n\nI did a quick scan last night, looking for players with a peak comparable\nto or better than Winfield.  In my quick-n-dirty subjective judgement, you\ncould make good cases for Ruth, Aaron, Ott, Robinson, Clemente, Kaline, \nMaris, Klein, Jackson, Waner, and probably a few others.  This is not a\nknock on Winfield, but a comment on his consistency: all of those other\nplayers had awesome stretches and very good stretches, while Winfield has\nbeen more uniformly excellent.  Hall of Fame?  Absolutely.  Top-10 peak?\nI'm not so sure.  Top 10 total career value?  Yes, almost certainly.
[argument over "reasonable" players and umpires deleted]\n\n\n\nYes, but the baseball rules say you can only appeal a ball and not a\nstrike. There was no decision made by the umpire regarding an appeal.\nOnce he called it a strike the call could not be changed.  \n\nI thought that the umpire did the right thing.
But it is subject to all kinds of bias, and is almost completely useless\nfor first basemen.  From the raw stats, there is no way to tell which of\na first baseman's putouts were made on throws from other fielders, and\nwhich were made on his own plays; likewise, you can't tell whether a\ndouble play was 6-4-3 or 3-6-3.  Fielding Runs thus gives a first\nbaseman no credit for putouts or double plays, only for assists and\nerrors.  \n\nIt thus favors first basemen who play deep, reaching a lot of balls but\nforcing the pitcher to cover first more frequently.  It also hurts first\nbaseman who play behind left-handed pitching staffs and thus face few\nleft-handed batters.\n\n\nThis is better; of course, it still isn't all of a first baseman's\ndefense.\n\n\nDefensive Average, which uses larger (and probably better) zones, has\nMattingly tied for second in the league.\n\n\nWhile 233 batting runs is good, it is mostly in the past; the runs he\nproduced in 1986 don't say much about his value in 1993.
Actually, I was hoping for Barry Bonds.  Oh well.\n\n\nFirst off, Jeff has had like 5 hits in the last two games, and walked\n*yet again*.  Sorry Ken, but Jeff King does have some power, which\nmeans his SLG won't be below .300, and his walks are *way* up.  If\nthat increase is real, Jeff King will be an above average NL third\nbaseman in 1993.  Jose Lind, on the other hand, *still* doesn't walk,\nand clearly isn't a .320 hitter.  My bet is that he won't be getting\nany extra bases either once everybody starts pulling the "Lind Shift"\nwe were seeing in the NL.\n\n\nNo, although since the Lavalliere weirdness, nothing would really\nsurprise me.  Jeff King is currently in the top 10 in the league in\n*walks*.  Something is up...
I think what Bob is describing here is a game which MAD magazine\ncalled 'Basebrawl'.  I have no idea what issue, but it sure did cover\nthe violence issue.\n\npaul
No, Brian's hurt. His hand I think.  He started Saturday's game but was taken\nout.  It's far too early to populate the dog house, although Bedrock was seen\nwith a milkbone.
This is a fine strategy if you expect to run away with the division.\nBut the Giants are going to need every break they can get, if they\nwant too hold that lead.  I don't think they can afford to be\nlackadaisical, and say "well it has worked pretty well so far, and\nwhile we might be able to improve the results, we don't think it is\nworth the risk".\n\n\nThe two tend to go hand in hand...
And then cosper@seq.uncwil.edu (Kit Cosper) quoth:\n=>A comment made by one of the Braves announcers, attributed to\n=>an anonymous player after Friday night's game,\n=>\n=>	"I'm sorry we didn't tie it up, I wanted to see some more\n=>	 umpiring."\n=>\n=>Just about sums it up.............\n\nSure, like Ron Gant wasn't completely out of line.\n\nIf I were Hirschbeck, I would have ejected, in order, Ron Gant, every single\nlast Brave who came onto the field, and possibly Bobby Cox, depending on the\nlanguage he used.  Since Cox was the only Brave rung up, I suspect I would\nhave thrown him out too.\n\nYou simply cannot show up an umpire like Ron Gant did.  It is disrespectful\nof not only the home plate umpire, but of the dignity of the game.
I suspect that splits such as these are the result of positioning.  An\noutfielder who is fast and gets a good jump would be expected to catch a\nlot of balls, preventing both singles and doubles, and also cut off more\nuncatchable balls, turinging doubles into singles.  However, a fielder\nwho plays shallow will catch more short flies and fewer long flies; this\nmeans that he will allow fewer singles but more doubles.\n\nHas anyone seen these players' positioning?  Do Butler and Felix play\ndeep, and Lankford, Martinez, and Wilson shallow, or is this a park\neffect?  I thought Butler liked to play shallow.
Sorry, I still don't buy it.  You're certainly right that the runner is\nnot out merely for running out of the baseline: he must interfere with\nthe play.  But the argument here is over what constitutes interference.\nYou certainly cannot infer from what you've quoted that the batter-runner\nmust be hit by the ball to be guilty of interference: you haven't posted\na definition of interference at all.\n\nIMO this calls for one of the "approved ruling[s]" that go in small print\nin the rulebook.  Something like:\n\nAPPROVED RULING:\nIf in the judgement of the umpire the runner, by running to the left\nof the allowed path, caused the fielder to make a bad throw, blocks the\nvision of the fielder receiving the throw, or otherwise impedes the\ndefensive team's making a play on him, the batter-runner shall be\njudeged guilty of interference.\n\nor\n\nAPPROVED RULING:\nThe runner cannot be judged guilty of interference in the unless he makes\ncontact with a fielder or is hit by the thrown ball.\n\n--\nIn the absence of such an approved ruling I claim that this is a poor\nrules trivia question--since it cannot be authoritatively answered.
My mistake.
I didn't mean that it would necessarily help him improve at that\nspecific deficiency.  I meant that if having Bonds bat behind him\ngives Williams (possibly unfounded) confidence, that might translate\ninto more hitting productivity.  But you're right -- if Williams'\nbiggest problem is more physical than mental, that's less likely\nto make a difference.
Here's a few two-sport star trivia questions.  I'll admit they're not\ntoo difficult, but a bit challenging nevertheless.\n\nMail me your answers please; or post them.\n\n\n1.  Which pitcher played for the Harlem Globetrotters?\n\n2.  Which major leaguer briefly tried professional golf in 1978?\n\n3.  Which does Dieon Sanders have more of (professionally):\n    career touchdowns or triples?\n\n4.  Has there been any player of both pro hockey and baseball?\n    If so, name him and the years he played each.\n\n\nIf you have any other two-sport star tidbits, feel free to include them.
Okay, I'll bite.  How can OBP be *lower* than batting average?\nSac flies or something?
I really think that this is the key point.  When I saw the incident on\nBaseball Tonight Sunday, I couldn't believe how far away from the plate\nGant went.  Then he casually leaned against his bat.  I don't blame the \numpire at all for telling the pitcher to pitch.\n\n  The worst part of the whole incident was the Braves coming out onto the\nfield.  What were they going to do, attack the umpire?  The only people\nwho should've been out there were Cox and maybe the coaches, but NO players.\nI agree with the person who posted before that Cox should be suspended for\nhaving no control over his team.
During the local Rockies broadcast the other day Don Baylor\nwent out to bring in a relief pitcher and a graphic came up\non the screen that it was the "so and so sponsored" pitching \nchange. I saw another game where the pinch hitter was sponsored.\n\nAt other times during the game Rockies announcer Duane Kuiper was\nsetting up the strategy that the defense might use with the expectation\nthat Charlie Jones would jump in and discuss the situation. But\nwhat does Charlie do, he read's a beer advertisement and leaves\nDuane hanging. Duane's strategy proved prophetic.\n\nThese examples happen over and over on radio and T.V. braodcasts\nmaking them sometimes very boring to listen to.\n\nI guess it's just a matter of time before a player sells his name\nto  Budweiser, Nike, etc.\n\nI don't think it will be long until we hear: "Nike Budweiser drills\nit deep to left field, Chevrolet goes back, back, it's gone!

o any of you experts want to analyze Ron Gant?\nIs his early season slump because he is still swinging his bat the way\nhe was last year (trying to hit to all fields, etc.) or has he changed his\nswing back to the "old" Gant and is just in a small early season slump.\n\nIs his spot int he lineup even secure, especially the way he has\nbeen hitting?\n \n--\nmsilverm@nyx.cs.du.edu				GO CUBS!!!

^^^^\n ^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^\n	Whoa. Aren't you forgetting a couple of guys named Gant and Justice?\n\n \n	He can lead off. He'll probably steal 40. He might hit .300. He'll\nnever hit 20+ homers. I think you went 2 for 4 on this one.\n \n		       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n	You said it all right there. \n\n	Does anyone else out there not like Deon? I think he's all hype.\nHis .300 season last year was good, but I'm not convinced that he can do\nit again. It reminds me (sorry) of the year 1987(?) when Tim Wallach hit\n30 or so homers and had 127 RBI. It never even came close to happening \nagain. Of course, maybe I just prefer guys who go about their business\nand don't play it up for the attention. Just my HO.\n\nDoug Roberts - Larry Walker is God. Delino Deshields thinks he is.

I wholeheartedly endorse it.\n\n I have no problem with the\n\nHaven't been to many A's games, have you?\n\nSeriously, I don't mind a baseball game that lasts a long time if it lasts\na long time because there is good baseball being played.  However, I don't\nlike 3-2 games that take 3+ hours, because there's a lot of dead time going\non in that game.  I don't find anything exciting about watching batter or\npitcher wander around between pitches, or watching the catcher make a slow\nwalk to the mound, or watching lots of pitcher changes for no good reason\n(Whitey Herzog used to be the master of this; the game could be way out of\nreach, and he'd still be making switches for platoon advantage).  \n\nI want to see the game, not people standing around.  I don't really enjoy\nwatching NFL football games in person, for example, because there's so much\ndead time (you don't really notice how much dead time there is if you watch\nit on television, because they're busy showing you replays).  I don't like\nthat college basketball games have so many time outs at the end of the game\n(the NCAA has made some moves to try to alleviate this problem for next\nyear: they're going to stop the clock after made baskets late in games next\nyear, and they're going to a 35 second clock).  \n\nThere's also a difference in how tolerant I am of long games if I'm\nwatching them on the tube, and if I'm going there in person.  For me, going\nto an A's game has become a major commitment of time, one that I'm not\nwilling to make that often:  the length of their games is costing the A's\nrevenue from me.
Baltimore Baseblazers? Where the hell did you come up with that? The\nOrioles are not a base-stealing team except for Anderson. Besides we would\nnever call them anything but the Baltimore Orioles. Why? The ballpark has\nall these orthologically (spelling error?) correct BALTIMORE ORIOLES all\nover the place. I bet you thought the bird is just an oriole. It's not. The\nbird was named after Lord Baltimore when Maryland was founded. They're\ncalled Baltimore Orioles. But the post is just a joke so why do I care what\na non-O's fan thinks of us? But I still wonder where Baseblazers came from.\nSan Diego Padres, now there's a name that needs to be changed. How is padre\nbeing used? As "Father" ie priest or "father" ie parents?
Like Clinton and Reno, I accept full responsibility for this\nsenseless disaster.  My wife and I picked this game to go to\nand thus caused the return of the pre-season-projected Sox\noffense.  Like all no-no's Bosio was good, lucky (hard grounder\nby Vaughn off T. Martinez' glove but straight to Boone who \nthrew to Bosio at first, 3-4-1), and backed by good defense\n(many non-trivial groundouts).  The game was amazingly fast,\nas the Sox tended to go down quickly and Hesketh was also \nworking fast.  The Sox relief pitching was ok -- the runs off\nQuantrill were on two ridiculous bloops and a hard line single\nwhich Greenwell let get past him trying for a catch.\n\nGreenwell's mental stability is a serious concern (I guess it\nhas always been, but his quirks were amusing back when he was\nan MVP candidate).  Wednesday he got in a huff with Johnson a\nafter striking out on a bad inside pitch (apparently Johnson\nmade an "ok, I've got to stay focused" gesture which Iron Mike\ninterpreted as taunting), and struck out to heavy booing the \nnext two times.  As Valentine noted, last night he came up in\nthe first after Riles and Quintana had walked to open the game.\nCan you say "take the first pitch"?  Not Mike, who dribbled it\ninto a 6-4-3.  The PI quoted Bosio that this was a "batting\npractice fastball".  Next time up he also hit the first pitch,\na hard liner straight to KGJr in center.  He also made the\npathetic error and failed to catch Boone's HR (which looked \ncomparable to the ball Lance Johnson caught on the highlight\nreel that night).\n\nIs Riles suppsoed to be good defensively?  I couldn't tell from\nthe field angle but his range looked bad, and he coughed a DP\nthat cost a run or two.  Why was he leadoff?  I hope Fletcher\ngets well soon.\n\nAlso on lineups, Pinella put Bret Boone fifth for reasons beyond\nme.  It seemed to work, as he was 3-4 with a HR and some good\ndefense (a wag behind us said "He sure don't want to go back to\nCalgary!")  There is a theory that you put a leadoff type fifth\nbecause they'll likely lead off the second (as Boone did).\n\nWell, now we face the hot Angels and another power pitcher in\nLangston.  A reminder that contest entries are open through next\nWednesday -- I expect a surge of pessimism.  By the way, ties will\nbe broken by earliest entry.  One entry per person or pseudonym,\nplease, and easy on the pseudonyms.
why?
The injury is to his fielding hand, which is good.  Unfortunately, he may\nhave some ligament damage and may require surgery, which would lay him up\nfor a while.\n\n\nApparently just a strain of some sort.  He hasn't been put on the DL, so\nit's probably just day-to-day.
So what is your definition of "interfering with the fielder taking the throw"?\n\nThe rule book certainly doesn't have a definiton or clarification, so it's\npossible to interpret the rule as saying that if the catcher has to alter\nhis throw to avoid hitting the batter-runner, then again we have interference.\nYou know, it seems that there is no way to apply this rule justly--if the\ncatcher (or the pitcher, say Rob Dibble, for example) throws toward first\nand hits the runner running inside the baseline, the fielder takes the chance\nof being ejected.  Therefore he probably would throw around the runner or\n(your scenario) above him.\n\nYou should note that in our American Legion League, (which uses MLB rules) we\ninterpret the rule to say in this very circumstance there IS interference\nper rule 7.09.
This is certainly not the case.  There is no significant *ability* toi\nperform in the clutch, but clutch performance certainly happens every\ntime there is a game-winning hit.  The "clutch pitching" quoted above is\nsomething which happened, not a claim that any particular player should\nbe expected to be a clutch pitcher.\n\n\n\nSimple statistics tell me that there is a 2% chance an average clutch\nhitter would have this large a split (the average decrease is 7 points,\nstandard deviation about 30).  There will be such hitters in any league,\njust as there will be hitters who hit poorly on Tuesdays.\n\nAnd there is only a very weak correlation (.01 in my best study) between\nclutch hitting in the last four years and clutch hitting this year,\nprobably because most of the clutch data is determinaed by luck rather\nthan any ability.  *Based only on this data*, I don't see any reason to\npinch-hit for Sabo, or any other player who had been a poor clutch\nhitter in the past.\n\nBut there are many other factors involved in a decision to pinch-hit.\nDoes the pinch-hitter give you a platoon advantage?  (Any portion of\nSabo's clutch split that results from his platoon split is certainly a\nreal ability, even if it has nothing to do with clutch hitting.)  Do you\nhave a singles hitter at the plate when you need a home run?  Do you\nhave a curveball pitcher facing a batter who has trouble with curves?
It's gotta be an HBP.
I didn't say that.  Did you say that?  Wow, I can't believe that\nanyone would think that the Braves (or any other team, for that matter)\nshould get the title for free.  What a dolt that person would be, if\nthat was what they thought.  Incredible.\n\n\n\n\n--
to take this to its, er, "logical" conclusion, it is impossible to\nascertain whether or not i am a better hitter than roberto alomar,\nor a better pitcher than juan guzman, or a better center fielder than\ndevon white.  after all, if i were on the blue jays, can you really\nprove that they wouldn't have won the world series in both 1991 AND\n1992?\n\nwhile i thank you, mister maynard, for your faith in my atheletic\nprowess, i can assure you that your faith is misplaced.

His performance at the plate may well be from the shoulder injury\nreceived when he ran into the wall making a catch in the Cincy series.\nIt may also be him pressing a little.\n\nAs for the baserunning, it does not appear to be just Lankford.\nDent made the bad call sending Lankford in the Sunday night game\nagainst Cincy - but everyone had a bad time against the Dodger's catcher.\n\n\nGood question.

NPR this morning had an interview with Linda McCarthy (name possibly\ngarbled by me), an official historian for the CIA.  She has won an Emmy\nfor research on Moe Berg for a TV documentary (which I know from nothing\nbut which sounds good).  She said that among other things, Berg was the \nprincipal spy for the OSS (CIA's WWII precursor) spying on Axis atomic\nprograms, because of his physics background and language skills.  She said\nthat during the war he met with Heisenberg in Switzerland, and had \ninstructions to shoot Heisenberg if the Germans were close to us in bomb\nresearch (he concluded they were two years behind, and didn't shoot him).\n(I have heard elsewhere that Heisenberg deliberately misled the Nazi bomb\nprogram, but I don't know how reliable this is.)  Unfortunately, NPR didn't\nmention any kind of a book she's writing -- I'd certainly buy it.\n\n(In case you're wondering about baseball relevance, Berg was a longtime\nMLB backup catcher.  He was a member of an MLB All-Star team that toured\nJapan in 1934, presumably not because of his baseball prowess but because\nhe was one of the few Americans, much less MLB players, who spoke Japanese.\nPhotos he took of Tokyo on that trip were later used to plan bombing raids,\naccording to McCarthy.)
I'll post my guesses to some of these and other trivia questions posted.\n\nFor most career K's with one team, if it's not Ryan, perhaps Steve Carlton.\nWith the Rangers, Hough was there for a long time.\n\nIn the 100 saves department...Maybe Lee Smith(he should have at least\na hundred with the Cubbies, maybe enough with either the RSox or Cards.)\nThen maybe, Gossage?(NYY and SD), Fingers (MIL, OAK)\n\nDon't know about the homers/steals dept.\n\nIn some other article,(Mets trivia), it could be Tim Leary in at least\nthe losing to all teams, maybe beating all of 'em too.  Probably Seaver\nand Koosman fit too.\n\nAnd in Randy Johnson's no-hitter, I think it was Scott Bradley, the\nother half of the old Mariner catching platoon, who was behind the plate\nthat night.

A few weeks ago I posted about the Phillies team personalities.  Did anyone see the ESPN feature on the Phils on Monday Night.  John Kruk had a great line.  He was talking about people on the team always playing and not sitting out because of a minor injury.  He said if they do they know we'll kick their ass.  The \ntime I saw in was in the afternoon and it was not bleeped.  When I saw it at\nthey bleeped "ass."  Mitch Williams talked about the team being a bunch of \nthrowaways from other teams, and that is why they are so close.  Kruk said that\nthey all get along this year.  Last year, he said, they hated the pitchers.  I \nassume he was joking, but he always keeps a straight face when he talks.  Oh,\nWhat a team!!!!!\n\nRob Koffler

I know it's very trendy nowadays to dump on Morris, but let's give credit\nwhere credit is due.\n\nIt is doubtful that the blue jays would have won the AL east without Morris.\nLast year, when the team went 13-15 for the month of August, and all the \nother starters were being shelled, and Milwaukee was making a charge,\nMorris went 5-1 with a pretty good era (I can't remember exactly).\nAlso, let's not underestimate the importance his 240+ innings to save \nthe bullpen every fifth day.  If he didn't help us win the AL east, forget\nabout the pennent and the world series.\n\nHis run support was high (5.98 runs) but so was Stottlemyer's (5.90 runs)\nand he won only 12 games.  I do remember Morris winning an inordinate number of\n6-5 and 8-6 ballgames, but this is to his credit.  He pitched only as good\nas he needed to be.  When he was up 6-1 in a ballgame, he just put it in cruise\ncontrol and threw the ball up there and let the batters "get themseleves out"\n(I hate this expression!).  An inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out \ntrying to make perfect pitches to keep his era down.  But Morris, being a \nveteran pitcher, knows that winning is the only thing that really matters in\nbaseball.  By saving himself, he was able to reach back for that little extra\n(I hate this too!) when the game was on the line.\n\nYes Morris is crapping out big time this year, but let's not change history\nto suit the present.  \n\nBTW, I think he should be put in the bullpen; it would be embarrassing a \nveteran pitcher which Cito would never do, but his era is 17+, how much more\ncan he be embarrassed?\n\n\nditto!
Since Roger is a Canadian who probably knows nothing about baseball\nI am gonna try to explain it to him in terms of hockey...\n\naccording to his logic...\nI can say that since 1988...Bob Errey is better than Wayne Gretzky\n\nhey...Errey contributed to 2 Cups while good old Wayne has won nothing...\n(I think the Kings should trade Gretzky for Errey....what do you think Roger?)
funny, it seems to me that the stats major league and minor league handbooks,\nwhich are nothing BUT collections of statistics, are authored by "bill james\nand stats inc. (and howe, for the minor league handbook)".\n\nand i am not sure how the 1993 bill james player ratings book qualifies\nas a "book with statistics", while the elias analyst is a "statistics book".\nthe analyst contains more stats, sure, but it also contains more dialogue.\n\nfinally, the point was not about the word "statistics".  it was about\n"money-grubbing".  i don't see how anyone who has looked at the bill\njames player ratings book cannot consider him money-grubbing.
While I can see why they want to cut down on the time spent walking around,\nGant wasn't ordered back in the box "sooner", he was ordered back immediately.\nAs soon as he stepped out, Hirschbeck told him to get back in the box.\nNow, Gant doesn't take a lot of walks between pitches.  The only reason\nhe did then because he was *very* bothered by the call.  I expect his\nconcentration wasn't there yet, and in a crucial situation I imagine it's\nbest to be as calm as possible.  Contributing factors would be Gant's\nbad day at the plate, bad year at the plate, and the Braves long scoring\ndrought.\n\nNow, it's pretty stupid to go ahead and talk the walk when the umpire is\ntelling you to get in there.  You know the umpire is going to do something\n(call for a strike, throw you out, etc.).  Gant was wrong.\n\nBut Hirschbeck was more wrong, in my biased view.  Aside from the major chip\nhe seemed to have on his shoulder, what was the problem.  Gant had a reason\nto want some time (disputed strike call).  Gant hadn't been wasting time all\ngame.  The game had been cruising along, and was just over two hours old.\nThe score was 1-0, with 2 outs in the ninth and a runner in scoring position.\nIs there *any* reason Hirschbeck couldn't, and shouldn't, cut Gant a little\nslack?  For no discernible constructive reason, Hirschbeck disrupted the\ngame, caused a five minute delay, and materially hurt the batter in a key\nsituation.  Did he have a date to get to?\n\nAnd I still wonder why Terry was tossed earlier in the game.\n-- \nDale J. Stephenson |*| (steph@cs.uiuc.edu) |*| Baseball fanatic
Yes, that's him.  Was I not specific enough?\n\nJust because someone consistently pulls the ball does not mean that\nthey have a quick bat.  Dawson's release is slow, and he *IS* 38, after\nall.  He may swing early, and rotate his hips so that he hits the ball to \nthe left side all the time, but he swings slowly.\n\nAs for me disagreeing with Peter Gammons... Whoa!  That's never happened\nbefore!  Next thing you know, I'll probably believe Dave Campbell is the\nbiggest imbecile even to come near a mic, and that Ray Knight has\nthe IQ of drained crankcase oil.
If it encouraged the runner to stretch his lead, it would probably\nalso result ina greater number of pickoffs. I think it would be a\nworkable rule, but it would probably be best to experiment in another\nleague before trying it in the bigs.

The subject line says it all. What is the rule that qualifies\na pitcher as making a save?
Well, it looks like, just as Doug trumped Tim, beating him to the net\nwith his defensive analyses, so Tim has gotten in ahead of me.\n\nThe way I was doing it was a little different. Being me, of course, I\nused equivalent averages to work out how many runs a player was worth,\nand I calculated both rate of performance (fielding equivalent\naverage) and total performance (fielding equivalent runs). But I\ncompared, not to the average player, but the replacement player, and\nhere's why: because the positional adjustment comes built in to the\nsystem. In the AL of 1992, the average SS is 32.9 runs above\nreplacement (RAR); cf, 31.6; 2B, 28.8; 3B, 26.3; LF, 26.0; RF, 24.6;\n1B, 16.9. We may quibble with the exact numbers, but the order looks\nsubstantially right.\n\nIn the equivalent average, I have always set league average to .235. I\nhad decided in hitting that the replacement level batter has an eqa of\n.180; the name of that replacement level hitter, often as not, is\n"Billy Ripken". I decided to let the replacement level fielder be the\nsame distance from .235 as .180, but in the opposite direction as I\nhave set it up; that makes for an eqa of .280. (Yes, I can add. Runs\nare proportional to eqa squared; the difference between 180 squared\nand 235 squared equals the difference to 279 squared, and I rounded\noff for simplicity). An all-replacement fielding team would have:\nRandy Milligan at first (.282), Willie Randolph (.269) at second, Leo\nGomez (.279) at third, Walt Weiss (.269) at short, Kevin Bass (.271)\nin left, HoJo (.257) in center, and Eric Anthony (.277) in right. Ugh.\n\nSo, the total number of RAR for a player is the sum of his batting and\nfielding RAR. I can rate them by total RAR, or RAR per some number of\nbatting outs, like 400. An average player has a total RAR of about 55,\n30 batting, 25 fielding.\n\nTotal RAR (bat/field)\n\n1. Bonds      152 (124/28)  Ventura    124 (66/58)\n2.

quoted for future reference...\n\n\nHe believed one of two things: 1) Sabo was more likely than Samuel\nto get a hit OR 2) that more good would be done in the long run\nby leaving Sabo in regardless of the expectation of the actual outcome.\n\nIn fact you don't know what Perez had in mind when he left Sabo in.\n\n\nIn fact, I don't think anyone is claiming that they can predict\nthe future, or any particular future event.  But we can believe\nthat certain trends are due to a cause (whether or not we have\nidentified the cause) and therefore will continue.\n\n\nI think seeing insults in other people's opinions is kind of silly.\nAfter all, Mark didn't call you a total idiot, or call your work\nstupid, he simply stated that it didn't change his opinion on the \nsubject.\n\n\nIf player A hits better on Tuesdays and always has, and Mark believes\nthat it might be an indication that he will hit on Tuesday better next\nseason as well, would you respond the same way?  At some point you\nmight admit that all variable might not be known to you (who knows\nwhat this guy does every Monday night?  Maybe he sees his sports\nshrink on Tuesday mornings, or has his Vitamin B shots Monday nights?)\n\nBut this is something that's true of one guy only.  It doesn't\nmean that there will be a meaningful correlation for the entire\nleague by days of the week, nor that there should be.  But it doesn't\nmean we can't make predictions based on that for that particular\nplayer.\n\n\nI only see a prediction for one player here.  I don't see anything\nabout ALL batters.\n\n\nThat's exactly what Mark is trying to do though.  Find hitters\nthat have these correlation and ask whether we can make predictions\nfor these hitters based on their past performance.\n\n\nHuh?  What does gambler's fallacy have to do with anything?\nWhether you can know the reason for correlation or not, you can't\ndeny that it has existent, you can only make an argument that\nyou don't think it is likely to continue to exist because you\ncan't see a reason for it to exist.\n\n\nSomeone posted recently on why negative clutch would correlate.\nThe argument along the lines of star player with L/R splits will\nalways see an adverse condition in late innings of a close game\n(i.e. opposing manager will always bring in a AH pitcher to\nface him, where his manager will not pull him for a PH)\n\n\nWhat about you?  If the shoe fits, will you wear it with an open mind?
Not an astute observation -- this is a straw-bullpen.  The lefties,\nStanton & Mercker are strong, and Wohlers is down learning a new pitch.\nThe bullpen is fine, probably superior.\n\n\nAlso false.  Gant, Nixon, Justice, Hunter, Blauser present a decent enough\noffense.  EVERYONE is slumping (except Blauser), not just Pendleton.\n\nBTW, what is the story with Brian Hunter?

Good question.  It's my impression, not backed by evidence, that general\nsouth-of-the-borderness seems to exempt one from the hiring-firing effect\nI was talking about.  \n\nBack in the 20's there were some attempts to hire black Cuban ballplayers; \nthey were rejected by the commissioner and others.\n\n\n\n\nWell, what *did* I mean to say?  Aside from some short-lived exceptions\nsuch as Japanese internment in WW II, only blacks were affected by laws\nregarding: slavery, Jim Crow, miscegenation, military service, etc.  If\nmy claim of exclusivity is not 100% airtight, that is, if you can come\nup with this or that exception, fine -- have a cookie.  But compared to\nthis list, no other racial group put up with a legal onslaught worth\ndiscussing at length.

That's why he lost 18 for Detroit in\n1990. Funny how he wins a lot of games when he pitches on good teams but\nloses a lot when he pitches on bad ones.

Right.  Most definitely.\n\n\nThis may be the root of the confusion...\n\nPlease consider the following hypothetical with an open mind.  Note\nthat I am *not* (yet) saying that it has anything to do with the\nquestion at hand.\n\nSuppose we have a simplified Lotto game.  You pick a number from 1-10\nand win if that number is drawn.  Suppose we have a large population\nof people who play this game every week.\n\nIn the first year of the game, approximately 1/4 of the population\nwill win 7 or more times.\n\nIn the second year of the game, 1/4 of those 7-time winners will again\nbe 7-time winners.\n\nIn the third year of the game, 1/4 of those who won 7 or more times in\neach of the first two years will win 7 again.\n\nSuppose I started with 1024 people in my population.  After three\nyears, I have 32 people who have consistently, in each of the last\nthree years, won 140% or more the number of times expected.\n\nDo we expect them to be big winners in the fourth year of the game?\nNo.  Because we know there is no skill involved.  Nothing about these\n"consistent winners" can influence their chances of winning.  But\nsuppose we *don't* know whether or not there is a chance that skill\nmight be involved.  Perhaps some of the people in our population are\npsychic, or something.  How would we test this hypothesis?\n\nWe can look for correlations in the population.  Now most of the\npopulation will show zero correlation.  But our psychics should show a\nhigh positive correlation (even if they aren't very good psychics,\nthey should still manage to win 7 or more times most years).  Net\nresult?  A small positive correlation over the entire population.\n\n\nWell, zero correlation is zero correlation.  You mention that Sabo has\nhit poorly in the clutch over the last 3(?) years.  But if we look at\nthe past, we find that clutch patterns are just as likely to reverse\nas they are to remain consistent.  The length of the streak doesn't\nseem to make a difference to the probability that the player will be\nclutch or choke the next year.  Is there any reason to expect *this*\nstreak to be different from past streaks?\n\nNow if it were true that "75% of all three-year streaks remained true\nto form", then we might have something useful.  But then we wouldn't\nhave zero correlation.  Instead we have "50% of all three-year streaks\nremain true to form, and 50% of all three-year streaks reverse".  You\nlook at those numbers and say "three year choke streak implies more\nlikely to choke this year".  But it would be equally valid to look at\nthose numbers and say "three year choke streak implies more likely to\nbe clutch this year", since the probabilities are split 50-50 each\nway.\n\n\nThen we would have something useful.  And we would also have a\npositive correlation.  But for every individual that exhibits such a\npattern and holds true, there is another who exhibits such a pattern\nand then reverses.
How about Matt Nokes 2 run single against Ron Darling.  Was that a hit or what?  \nWhile watching the game yesterday they flashed up something regarding The\nBoss' talking about Mark Connor as bullpen coach.  He said something like it's\nMark Connor's fault that the bullpen is so horrible!!  Here we go again!! \nGeorge sticking his non-baseball nose in the baseball business.  Shut up\nGeorge, just spend the money, get the players and leave Buck and the coaches\nand players alone.
Quite honestly, this one is ridiculous.  Consider the following\nscenario: Runner on third. As the pitcher starts to throw home, the\nrunner takes off for home and the batter squares around to bunt for\nthe suicide squeeze. The pitcher, seeing this, does not throw home,\nbut stops in mid action and puts the runner in a run down.  It is the\nbalk rule that prevents this from happening.  \n\nBelieve it or not, this actually happened to me once in an OBA\n(Ontario Baseball association) game in Milton, Ontario.  I was the\nbatter and to my amazement, the umpire missed it.  In the 12 years\nthat I played ball, this was worst piece of umpiring I ever saw.
It took three days to get to us, but I'll try anyway as I naturally\nhaven't seen the answer.\n\n\nSAFE. The correct call is "Infield Fly, (batter out) if fair". Runners\nmay advance at own risk. (Gotta tag up if caught, etc.) It is not a\nforce, and the pop was not caught, so regardless of whether the SS\ntags 3B or 2B (it wasn't clear, above), he hasn't got the runner out.\n\n\nOUT. See rule 6.05(L) APPROVED RULING. (Below). In this case, the\numpire has decided for whatever reason that the infield fly rule\ndoesn't apply. (Sounds like a bad call here, but that's not the\npoint). The batter is not out, so a force situation is created.\nTherefore, the runner is out.  ( UNLESS, by rule 6.05(L) the ball is\ndead AND the batter is safe, then I guess the runners would advance\nunmolested.  I can't really tell from 6.05(L) that the ball is dead in\nthis situation.)\n\n\nPertinent rules: 2.00 Definition of Infield Fly: "When an Infield fly\nis called, runners may advance at their own risk. If on an infield fly\nrule, the infielder intentionally drops a fair ball, the ball remains\nin play despite the provisions of Rule 6.05(L). The Infield Fly rule\ntakes precedence."\n\n6.05(L) A batter is out when: an infielder intentionally drops a fair\nfly ball or line drive, with first, first and second, first and thrid,\nor first,second and third base occupied before two are out. The ball\nis dead and the runners or runners shall return to their original base\nor bases. APPROVED RULING: In this situation, the batter is not out if\nthe infielder permits the ball the drop untouched to the ground,\nexcept when the infield fly rule applies.
Let's not forget Al Michaels, of "Do you believe in miracles?" fame.
Do you remember Game 7 of the 1988 NLCS, after the Dodgers defeated\nthe Mets, and Ugh-a-dugh foo-boo fat stomach Tom Lasorda came running out\non to the field in celebration?  YUCK!!!!!!\n	He undulated.  His arms flew up and down, keeping time with his\nrolling set of 9 stomachs, which flew all around the cozy confines of\nChavez Ravine.  He oozed, like a white gastropod.  He ran.  It was a \ndisgusting sight.  Not only couldn't I watch my Mets in the Series, I had\nto watch Fat Stomach Lasorda roll around Dodger....\n	BLARGH!\n\n\n	"If you like short, fat men, who grunt, curse, and spit a lot,\nWhitey's certainly your man" - Former WFAN host Pete Franklin, on The White\nRat ...\n	But it's true, this emphasis on the appearance of ballplayers in\ntight uniforms only works if the player actually has an extraodinary \nphysique.  Looking at Charlie Hough's scrawny torso through those tight\nwhite shirts just sort of makes me decide, "Hmmm, I don't want to eat lunch\ntoday...or tomorrow...or anytime soon...".\n	When Al Harazin first became Mets' GM, he was asked if he intended\nto help redesign the Mets' uniforms and change their image.  In particular,\nthey asked him about the orange and blue racing stripe that runs down the \nsides the uniforms.  He said that he's very much in favor of keeping them\nbecause "they're sleek and they're sexy".\n	Sid Fernandez, in a tight-fitting uniform, with a sleek racing\nstripe to denote speed and potencty.

I don't really mind the length of games either.  If they want to speed\nthe games up in sensible ways, that's fine with me too.  However, what\nI object to is the assertion by baseball people (Whitey Herzog, Buck\nRodgers are who I've heard say this) that games are too long because\nhitters are taking too many pitches, and that the strike zone needs to\nbe expanded.
Nice post Chuck, but you made just one mistake. Bones is a right-handed\n   pitcher. However, Hrbek's grand slam came off Graehme Lloyd, a lefty.

It depends. If, in the judgment of the umpire the batter made no\nattempt to avoid getting hit, the batter is awarded first for a\nbase on balls. If the umpire rules he did try to get out of the\nway, he's awarded first because of a hit batsman.\n\nRyan Robbins\nPenobscot Hall\nUniversity of Maine

Sigh.  Here we go again.                     \n\n\nMust I?  If I were to say that batting average is a predictor that \ncan be used to judge which of two hitters is more likely to get a\nhit on a particular plate appearance, is that only valid if I can\ndefine the skill in hitting a baseball?  That's all I've said, \nexcept I used the smaller sample of batting average in clutch situations.\n\n\nI did not say I could predict the future.  I've suggested that the\nstatistic is not necessarily meaningless.  Here's the data for this\nsituation:\n\n		Non-Clutch			Clutch	 \n		AB	H	BA		AB	H	BA\n\nSabo		1539	452	.294		259	59	.228\nSamuel		1564	383	.245		278	83	.299	\n\n\nIf you were to have been the Reds manager at that time, I assume you\nwould have had some basis for letting Sabo hit rather than pinch-\nhitting Samuel.  I'm sure some of that basis would have utilized\nprior performance.  You just wouldn't have used this particular\naspect of prior performance.  Is this not correct?\n\n\n\n\nOne more time.  I did *not* claim to be able to predict the future.\nI said that I accept the above data as an indication that Samuel would\nhave had a better chance for success in that situation than Sabo.\n\nAnd I am not dismissing your work.  I'm stating my opinion.\nYou are saying that your work renders any opinion to the contrary\ninvalid, so that the retention of that opinion is some kind of insult\nto your work.\n\n\n\nI did not say that clutch-hitting is well defined.\n\n	I said that the data is significant  to me.\n\nI did not say that it is a consistent skill.\n\n	I have said that it is an indicator of performance under a\n	certain set of circumstances.\n	\n\n\n\nAnd, [big sigh]\n\n\nI have NOT\n	NOT\n	 NOT\n	  NOT\n	   NOT\n	    NOT\n	     NOT EVER called you or anyone else on r.s.b. "stupid".\n\n\nIt is nice, however, to see that you will consider the possibility\nthat you actually could have some preconceived biases.\n\n\n\nAh.  I knew we could get to the name calling.  And there's that word\nyou like so much.\n\n\n\nWait a minute.  I thought I first had to define clutch hitting.\nDo I, or don't I?\n\n\nI made two statements in my post.\n\n1.	I am not convinced of your conclusions regarding clutch hitting.\n\n2.	I would have hit for Sabo.\n\n\nAs for #2, many of us make a number of written statements through \nthis media about what we think will happen in baseball.  I'm not\nshy about it.  I'll make the statement again.  I believe that by\nseason's end that Chris Sabo's batting average in clutch situations\nwill be significantly lower than his batting average in non-clutch\nsituations.  I can't prove that it will happen, so I guess we'll \njust have to wait and see.\n\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  - - - - - - - -  - - - - - - - - - -\nHere's another one for you.  In 1989 - 1991 Joe Carter's batting\naverage in clutch situations was significantly below his batting\naverage in non-clutch situations each year.  I presume you think\nthis is random.  \n\nNon-Clutch:	1585 AB		411 H		.259\nClutch:		 338 AB		 68 H		.201\n\nSo what could we expect in 1992 from Mr. Carter?\n\nWell, his composite BA through 1989 was .268;  through 1990 was\n.262;  through 1991 was .263, so I think we have a pretty good\nidea of what kind of batting average he can produce.  In 1992\nhe hit .264.  Not surprising, huh?  Also in 1992: \n\nNon-Clutch:	 536 AB		144 H		.269\nClutch:		  86 AB		 20 H		.233\n\nNo, this doesn't prove any overall statistical trend that can\nbe used to predict future performance across the breadth of \nmajor league ballplayers.  It just makes me think that in 1993\nJoe Carter's batting average in the clutch is not going to be\nas high as his ba in non-clutch situations.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n \nAs for #1 (above), I have plenty of company.  John Dewan of STATS,INC. is\nthe editor of The Scouting Report wherein the statistics regarding\nclutch hitting are compiled, reported and referenced in the text.\nBill James makes numerous references to a player's ability to hit\nwell in the clutch.  I am not saying that I can predict the future\nany more than they are.   You (and others) are saying that your\nwork renders their statements (and mine) meaningless.  I don't \naccept that, which in your words proves that I am a "total idiot".\n\n\n"Stupid".  "Total idiot".  \n\nMy, my.  Such hostility.\n\n\n\n--	The Beastmaster
I heard he had a strained abdominal muscle or something like that.

Come back ten years from now and look at the careers of Juan Gonzalez vs. Mark McGuire,  and then tell us how bogus the Juanderful one's 1992 HR title was.  I'd say that by 2003,  Juan will be preparing his HOF acceptance speech while the voters will be saying "Mark McWho?"
Okay, I'm curious. Why? Are you expectin the Commissioner to fly in and\nstand on the pitchers mound to yell at the fans to sit down, or what?
I've only ever seen this called once.  Back around 1979-1980.  I think\nthat Steve Carlton was pitching.  On the other hand, I am not sure how\nmuch effect this would have.  It seems that most of the time lost is\nwhen there are runners on base and the rule does not cover this.\n\n\nI have wondered why a pitcher is given 8 pitches when he enters the\ngame.  Let's be serious.  The relief pitcher has normally been\nthrowing out in the bullpen for a few minutes.  Does he really need 8\nmore pitches?
Well, there were 27 outs in a row with no hits or walks in between, but\nreally, he only retired 26 batters in a row.  The first out of the game\nwas the front end of a double play.  Still counts as a back-end perfect\ngame in my book, though. \n\nCongrats to Chris Bosio.  Too bad the Brewers couldn't hold on to him.
I don't know.  I think Phil Plantier has the ugliest stance.  He looks like\nhe's sitting on the toilet.
At the time I didn't really want the Sox to sign either.  I was more\nthan a little worried about Viola's elbow.\n\nBut you *surely* remember my shout of relief when, after a week of\nrumors that Morris was coming to the Red Sox, they ended up with Viola\ninstead.\n\nNow I'm even happier.  Viola seems to have rebounded nicely.\n\n\nHow long did Viola sign for.  Three years?  I generally agree with\ntheir policy of avoiding long-term contracts for pitchers.  But I\nthink they enforce it rather too strictly.  These days the premier\npitchers all sign three or four year deals.  Which leaves the Jays\nwith Morris and Stewart.  If the Jays want to compete for top free\nagent pitchers, they will have to accept greater risks.\n\nAny idea what the option year deal is for Morris?  Are there any\nautomatic activation clauses?  What is the buyout amount?f
2 simple reasons:\n\n(1)   Batting Williams ahead of Bonds will create a Left(Clark), \n      Right(Williams), Left(Bonds) situation in the middle of the\n      batting order.  This makes it tougher for opposing manager\n      to change pitchers.\n\n(2)   Having Bonds batting behind Williams means that Matt will get\n      more good pitches to hit.  This is important since he struggles\n      so much with breaking balls.  Opposing pitchers don't want to\n      walk Williams to get to Bonds.
Is there a Chicago Cubs mailing list??  If so, I'd like to join.\nAny help appreciated....
To really speed up the game umps need to START CALLING STRIKES the way\nthey used to.  I'm talking about making the strike zone start at the\nknees and go up to the top of the letters.  Forget this "the strike zone\nis in the general area of the groin".  A lot less 3-and-2 counts and a\nquicker game.
[...]\n\n\nTim Wallach can be explained with the rabbitball.  Deion can be explained\nas "learning how to play the game".  I'm not betting that Deion will be able\nto play as well as last year, but I think the odds of Deion playing as well\nor better than he did last year are better than the odds of Otis Nixon\ndoing the same thing.  When you factor in defense, Otis was more valuable last\nyear.  But I'm not convinced he'll be more valuable this year, and especially\nnext year.\n-- \nDale J.

Sounds like Darryl being Darryl, Tommy spending too much time on\nSlim Fast and needs a pasta fix, and the media being their usual\n"charming" selves.  Sounds like a New York-like story to me!!  :-)\n\nI saw the replay and am wondering what the big deal is?  I didn't\nrealize the folks in LA were making a big to do about it.  I think\nStawberry, Lasorda and the various media types should sit and watch\nthe replay then apologize to the fan.\n\n\nDarryl has not gotten off to a good start, he has to blame someone.\n\n\nAs long as the fan doesn't interfere with the play I see no problems.
I don't understand this at all.  Matt Williams has demonstrated\nthroughout his career that he will NOT wait for good pitches to hit.\nHe won't take walks.  He'd rather swing.  If I'm the opposing pitcher,\nwhy would I groove a fastball to Williams and have him hit it well,\nwhen I know that Williams will swing (and miss, or at least not hit\nvery well) at a low and away curve?
And it has worked again. Pena went 3 for 3 last night against Colorado.

Yes, I could look it up but I prefer to post this question \nto the net...\n\nI read somewhere in a long forgotten article that the handsignals \nused by major league umps were originally used to help a \ndeaf ball player by the name of "Dummy". Urban myth? True? \nI gots ta know.

Was it just me, or did it look like Hirschbeck pointed to\nthe 3B umpire before calling that strike?  I thought that's\nwhy Gant was asking for the appeal to the 1st base umpire;\nhe thought Hirschbeck had gotten checked-swing help from the wrong\numpire.\n\n\nAfter Hirschbeck called for the pitch, but before the pitch was thrown,\nCox came onto the field.  It was obvious that he was trying to get time\ncalled before the pitch, but no one was watching.\n\n\n\n\nYour listing pretty much agreed with what I saw, with the aforementioned\naddendums.  Perhaps it appeared differently at the ballpark.  Personally,\nI was amazed that Gant didn't get ejected.  But that's why Cox did;\nit's called protecting your players.\n\nAnd to those people who would have thrown everyone out of the game,\nall I can say is that you'd be making baseball history.  Even in\nthe worst baseball brawls, usually only the major instigators are\nejected, not everyone who comes onto the field.  And I'd have to \nsay that those brawls are considerably more threatening to the game\n than what the Braves did Fri. night.\n\nAnyhow, that's my last two cents on the subject, barring\noutrageous postings.  I will try to keep my eyes open\nfor more incidents involving Hirschbeck. I think there will\nbe some with other teams as well.  I hope not.
Dayley's salary was guarenteed...with Wells the Jays were only on the\nhook for 25%(?) of it.\n\nGive Jackson a break...he lost about 10 pounds with that flu he had\nwhen he was traded.\n\n\nI would rather have Molitor than Winfield...Winfield was just hogging\nall the credit, and he was trying to soak the Jays for a 3 year\nguarenteed contract...\n\n\nThe Jays pitching can only get better...Molitor and Alomar haven't hit\nanything yet...and the Jays are still over .500...

Until six or seven years ago I was an enthusiastic fan of NFL football.\nLast year I hardly watched a game.  What turned me off were the\nincessant interruptions to the continuity of the game.  A team scores.\n2.5 minutes of commercials.  Kickoff.  1.5 minutes of commercials.\nThree downs and a punt.  2 minutes of commercials.  AAAAARRRRGH!\n\nEarlier in this thread I commented on LaRussa and the A's, whom I\nbelieve institutionalize slow play.  I don't mind the cat-and-mouse\ngame with Rickey on first;  in fact, I rather enjoy it.  Similarly\nI would enjoy the battle with Listach or Lofton or Polonia on first.  What\nI object to is when such games are played with Karkovice on first,\nor when the game is a blowout.  I don't mind when the pitcher steps off \nthe mound to gather his thoughts in a crucial situation, or when a hitter\nsteps out of the box to regain his concentration.  What I object to\nis when hitters and pitchers take such breaks at every opportunity.\nWhen a game is exciting, these little delays serve as tension builders\nand for me enhance the value of the experience of the game.  When the\ndelays happen with regularity, they become nuisances, just like the\ncommercial breaks in football.  \n\nI understand the NFL imposed a number of rule changes to "speed up"\nthe games, basically putting an onus on the officiating staff to move\nthe markers and the ball to the spots faster.  That did not address\nthe problem of the continuity of the game.  It may have appeased the\nsponsors and the networks, but I would be amazed if it did anything\nto enhance the experience of the fans.\n\nSimilary, while some 3-hour baseball games bore me to tears, those are the\nones where there is no continuity and the players are taking exasperatingly\nlong periods to get ready for each pitch.  I doubt if anyone watching\nthe Braves-Giants game cared about Gant stepping out.  I doubt if anyone\nwatching that game would have found that pause to be anything but an\nopportunity to have their complete attention claimed by the drama that\nwas present.  I would be totally opposed to any effort that would\neliminate that aspect of baseball.\n\nOn the other hand, I wish baseball had a commissioner that was powerful\nenough to sit down with Alderson/LaRussa/Duncan and explain that they\nare actually hurting the product of baseball by dragging their games \nout the way that they do.  I sure wouldn't mind a little arm-twisting\nthere.\n\n\n\n--	The Beastmaster

I don't buy this at all.  I think things are colored to a very large\ndegree of preconceived notions of who the players involved are.  Try\nthis exercise:\n\nXXX is pitching today.  His team scores 4 in the first inning, and 3\nin the fourth.  XXX gives up 0 in the 1st through 4th.  In the fifth,\nhe gives up 3 runs.  In the 6th, he gives up 2 more.  The score is now\n7-5, with XXX's team still on top.\n\nI contend that if XXX were Jack Morris, the assessment would be "he is\na gutty veteran who pitches only as well as he has to to win."\n\nIf XXX were Mike Trmbley, the assessment would be "he is an\ninexperienced rookie who doesn't know how to pitch.  Needs more\nseasoning.  Send him to AAA.  Or to the spice rack."
Don't worry.  This is a perfectly normal state of affairs.  Had they\nactually been using him, you should be worried.\n\n\n	He's recovered totally from his injury.  That's why he's not\npitching...so he can rest his arm enough that he can get injured again\npitching on 38 days rest and then have fun dining in the Diamond Club in\nShea Stadium while AY struggles every day out there...\n\n\n	I've be quite happy to drop John Franco, just the same.\n	Bring back Randy Myers!\n	No, better make that...Bring Back Neil Allen!

I sent a version of this post out a while ago, but it was swallowed by\nthe void.  My apologies if anyone ends up receiving it.\n\n\n\nOh no, I wasn't confused -- I understood that it was your personal\nopinion.  But I thought we were discussing the need to shorten\ngames.

If it\nhasn't, then there *isn't* a problem, and there's no need to monkey\nwith things as they are.
If there is a "USA Today ftp site" could someone please post it to the \n   newsgroup so everyone will stop posting the "send it to me too" articles.\n   I'm sure many people woulds like to know so why not just post it to the net\n   rather than mailing hundreds of people. \n\n   Just a thought. \n\n\n    Thanks,    Ryan Robin.
Can't we just stick this guy in the FAQ and stop responding to him,\nguys?

Close, but there's a number 3 also:\n\n3. have entered the game with no more than a 3 run lead and pitched\n   at least one inning.\n\nIf a pitcher finishes a game which his team has won, does not get the win,\nand satisfies at least one of the three requirements, he gets a save.\n\n-Rusty\n--
I was at that game, behind home plate next to a scout who was manning the \nradar gun.  The 1991 season was winding down and Roger didn't have his \nbest fastball, topping out at 88-90 (in contrast to Frank Tanana, who went \nas low as 50 with one lollipop in the process of striking out Phil \nPlantier *five* times on the night).  Inky's shot would have gone further\nthan any I've ever seen if it hadn't crashed *into* the lights (not the \nlightstand) as you say over 100 feet high, Roy Hobbs-like, and bounced \nback onto the field.  That had to have been a 525-footer if unobstructed,\nedging out Bo Jackson's drive off Oil Can Boyd to the top of the\ncenterfield bleacher back wall in 1988 for the best I've seen personally \n(I was sitting under that one). \n\n---\nGlenn Waugaman\nDigital Equipment Corporation\nLittleton, MA\ng_waugaman@nac.enet.dec.com
The *real* way to speed up ballgames is for each home park owner to offer the\nfollowing schedule of bonuses to players on *both* teams:\n\n   For all players who participated in the game, offer $500 for each 10\n   minutes less than 3 hours the game took (i.e. if the game only took 2.5\n   hours, each player gets a bonus of $1500).\n\n   For all pitchers throwing 3 or more full innings in the game, extrapolate\n   the number of pitches or attempted pickoffs to the number they would have\n   thrown in a full 9 innings, and offer $500 for each number less than 120.\n   (If the pitcher throws a complete game with 100 pitches and 5 throws to\n   first he would get $7500).\n\nI suspect you could finance this the same way Presidential campaigns are\npaid for. Offer each fan a checkoff on his or her ticket that says "I want\n5% of the price of this ticket to go towards fast game bonuses"...
[...]\n\nActually, according to the DA information posted by Sherri, Boggs is superior\ndefensively to have.

To put it another way, compared to an average third baseman last year:\n\nBoggs converted 11 more grounders into outs, turned 2 more double plays, and\nprevented 11 doubles.\n\nHayes let 12 more grounders go by for hits, turned 6 more double plays, and\nprevented 4 doubles.\n-- \nDale J.

I am curious to known if there are any professional sports teams whose\ngames are regularly broadcast on an FM station.  The only one I am\naware of is WYSP in Philadelphia who carries the Eagles' games.\n\nIf you respond to me I will summarize for the list.
Cool.  And thank you for an intelligent response devoid of the silly\nname-calling of others.  :)\n\n\n One of the basic things you need to \n\nOK.\n\n\nActually, I think the large-scale sample size is part of the problem.\nIt seems to me that if we were to plot all the players in baseball\nin regard to BA vs. Clutch BA deviation we would get some kind of\nbell curve.  (The X-axis being the +/- deviation in clutch hitting\nvs. non-clutch;  the Y-axis being the number of players.)  Certainly\nthere would be *some* players on the extreme ends of the bell.  My\n*supposition* is that if we were to find the SAME players consistently\n(year after year) at one end of the bell or the other, then we might\nbe able to make some reasonable conclusions about *those* players\n(as opposed to all baseball players).\n\n  As a counterexample to \n\nYou won't hear those kind of accusations from me.  It is interesting\nthat you selected Maldonado, because he is someone whom I have also \nlooked at.  He has been a very inconsistent hitter (in terms of BA),\nhitting in 1989 - 92  .217, .273, .250, .272    Admittedly, he has\nbeen traded between leagues as well as clubs.  His clutch hitting \nrecord is equally inconsistent.  So, for my purposes in 1993 I would\nnot draw any conclusions about his ability to hit in the clutch based\non his prior performance.  I don't know how I would have felt in 1988,\nbut you may indeed be right.  \n\nWhen I looked at Sabo I found a more consistent record of hitting, and\na more consistent pattern of his clutch hitting being proportionately\nbelow his non-clutch BA.  Ditto for Joe Carter.\n\nThis probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement I am having\nwith others on this topic.  Must any conclusion based on statistical\nhistory be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base before\nit has any validity?  Is it impossible (or irrational) to apply\nstatistical analysis to selected components of the data base?\n\n\n\nI completely accept that reasoning.  Again, what if we were to find\nthe same individuals at each end of the spectrum on a consistent\nbasis? \n\namen.\n\n\n\n--	The Beastmaster
How is that possible?  He was on the Albuquerque Leftturns last year.\nHow could you possibly know what team he would be on if Manny Lee was\non his team last year.  After all, Manny Lee wasn't on his team last year,\nso it's complete, unfounded speculation to state that if he was on the\nsame team as Manny Lee last year, it would have been the team of the\nToronto Blue Jays.  Since he and Lee weren't on the same team, you\ncannot possibly objectively state what team they would have been on\nif they had both been on the same team.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n	As far as I know, a save opportunity is when it is 7th inning or\nbeyond, and the batter on deck can either tie or win the ball game.\n	For example If it is the bottom of the 8th inning and Clemens is\npithching. The Red Sox are leading 4-1 and Clemens has just givin up a hit. So,\nthere is a man on first, the batter, and the batter on deck could tie the game\nwith a homer.  If Jeff Russel came in, (The Red Sox reliever), and finished the\ngame without allowing the tieing or losing run to score, he would get the save\nand Clemens would get the win.                     \n                                                Thats how I beleive it works.
Total Baseball, which also tries to evaluate a player's total offensive\nand defensive contributions, gives Barry Bonds a Total Player rating of\n9.0 for 1992. Only one other player since Ruth attained that mark: Cal\nRipken for his 1984 season. Rounding out the top five offensive players\nin the NL last season: Sheffield, 5.9; Sandberg, 5.8; Van Slyke, 5.3; and\nLarkin, 4.7.\n\nThe top 5 offensive players in the AL in 1992 were: E. Martinez, 4.8;\nVentura, 4.8; Anderson, 4.5; R. Henderson, 4.4; and Thomas, 4.4\n\nIn short, Total Baseball says Bonds enjoyed one of the best seasons\never in the game's history -- better than any year had by Mantle,\nMays, Williams, etc. (If you disagree, don't flame me; flame the\nwriters of Total Baseball.) Also, Martinez and Ventura are neck and\nneck, so given the shortcomings of any statistical analysis, which one\nhad the better year can be considered a toss-up. Thus, Total Baseball\nsupports your choices of Bonds and Ventura as the MVPs of 1992.\n\n\n\n--\n--------------------------\nPhil Brown                |\naka pb6755@csc.albany.edu |

THe bowler is John Burkett, who went to 4-0 last night.  He is\na bargain pickup on my roto team, I got him at a minimum of $5.\n\n     This is not really true.  Excluding last season, the Giants\nhas been a better 2nd half team.  In 1991, they had a hot August\nto pull to within a few games of the Braves and Dodgers before\nfading in September.\n     The Giants may go back to earth, but not as fast as last\nseason for two reasons:\n(1)   Barry Bonds\n(2)   Roger Craig is no longer the manager.  Dusty can manage\n      his pitching staffs much better than Craig.
Now *this* is a legitimate point.  Baseball is entertainment, and I have no\nquarrel with people who find certain styles of play more entertaining than\nothers, regardless of their win-value.  Personally, I'm a huge fan of the\nslug-bunt; I doubt it's a high-percentage play, but I get a big kick out of\nit.  I am willing to live with the bad consequences in exchange for the fun.\n\nOf course, this is *not* the same as claiming (as some do) that Galarraga's\ninability to defer gratification isn't hurting his team because he "isn't\npaid to walk" or "is an RBI guy" or whatever.\n\n\nI'm not sure.  I used to think this was true, but more and more I'm becoming\nconvinced that it's the other way around: among players with the physical\nability to hit the ball real hard, the patient ones are the ones who get the\nchance to do it a lot.\n\nLet's break down the four basic categories of hitter, according to whether\nthey are power threats and whether they walk a lot:\n\n\n			Power			No Power\n\n	Patient		Frank Thomas		Brett Butler\n			Barry Bonds		Ozzie Smith\n			Mark McGwire		Craig Grebeck\n			Babe Ruth		Miller Huggins\n			Ted Williams		Billy Hamilton\n			Rickey Henderson	Eddie Joost\n			Joe Morgan		Mike Hargrove\n			   .			   .\n			   .			   .\n			   .			   .\n\n	Impatient	Ernie Banks		Ozzie Guillen\n			Dave Kingman		Shawon Dunston\n			Joe Carter		Andres Thomas\n			George Bell		Jose Lind\n			Kirby Puckett		Devon White\n	etc.\n\nAs far as I can tell, all the categories are full.  It really looks like the\ntwo are independent.  Nobody could possibly be *afraid* of Craig Grebeck at\nthe plate, and yet he walks quite a lot.  Part of that, undoubtedly, is being\nsmall of stature, but surely major league pitchers can hit that sort of \ntarget at least 3 times out of 6.  Randy Milligan is an even better example;\nhe's only shown noticeable power for one (partial) season, but he walks all\nover the place, despite his huge strike zone.
This is the fifth request to find out about a Cardinals mailing list.\nIt looks like one does not exist.  If anyone has the initiative, \ncreating a list might be a worthwhile activity.
TRIVIA TIME!!!  OK, We all know that Dave "My Batting Average is Down\nin the" Valle caught Chris Bosio's no hitter last night (and is batting over\n.300, BTW).  Here is the question:  Who caught Randy Johnson's no-hitter\nin June of 1990.  (Hint: Not Dave Valle :-))
The garbage started hitting the field well before the Sunday\ngame.  It started on Thursday or Friday (I can't recall which games I\n*didn't* watch on TBS).  Deion was getting pelted with trash the whole\ntime, it seemed.  The announcers talked about the change in the seating\nin the bleachers, and how that made it easier for the events that\ntranspired.  I actually thought at the start of the Sunday slugfest that\nsince it was a Sunday daygame the crowd would be a little different,\nmore refined.  Surprise?
Who holds the record for most career strikeouts while playing for one team?\nWho holds the record for most career strikeouts for the Rangers?\n(Hint: Nolan Ryan isn't either)\n\nWhat two pitchers have over 100 career saves for two different teams?\n\nWho is the only player to hit 300 or more career home runs and steal 300 or \nmore career bases for the same team?\n\nNo fair peeking at your baseball stats....
Well, when you say, without Morris, you have to mention an assumed\nreplacement.  If the alternative to Morris was letting Cito Gaston\nsoft-toss the ball underhand to the opposition every 5 days, then\nof course the Blue Jays wouldn't have won without Morris.  If the\nalternative was replacement level, then I think it would've been very\nclose, and yes, Morris might've made the difference.  If the alternative\nwas Frank Viola, the Blue Jays probably would have won more easily with\nViola.\n\n\nYes.  You can make the argument that the his presence prevented \nthe team from collapsing in August.\n\n\nThose innings were probably helpful.\n\n\nWell, I think is complete bs.  What happened most of the time is that\nMorris fell behind, and the team came back and rescued him.  Mostly,\nthis is because he's a lousy 1st inning pitcher, and much better\nthe rest of the way.  That the team can climb out of 4-0, 5-0 holes\nconsistently and win them 6-5 is not to Morris' credit; it's to the\nteam's credit.\n\nFurthermore, while Morris did exceed the W-L percentage that would\nbe projected from his runs allowed and run support, he hasn't done\nthis in previous years.  In fact, his W-L record in 1991 is a lot\nworse than what it projects to be with run support and runs allowed.\nDo you think he just came up with this ability in 1992.\n\nLook at the 2 postseason games he pitched decently in.  Typical\nMorris games.  Morris gets behind; team rescues him.  He's not\nresponsible for that rescue.  And in both those games, the team\njust didn't rescue him enough.  Jack Morris pitched as well as he did\nduring much of the season in those 2 games; the offense just didn't\nearn him a victory.\n\n\nMorris is one of those guys who will reture when he can't start\nanymore; he's too bad a first inning pitcher to serve in the bullpen.
How about Brooks Robinson's last homerun ever?  #268 came on 4-19-77 at\nMemorial Stadium with one out and two on in the bottom of the 10th inning.\nLarry Harlow was due up, but Brooks pinch-hit a 3-2 pitch from Dave LaRoche\ninto the left field bleachers for a 6-5 win.
However, batters didn't use to go for strolls after bad calls to the degree\nthey do now.  \n\n\nEveryone was told of the new emphasis on speeding up games.  The rule that\nHirschbeck invoked has been in the books a long time.\n\n\nNobody, including Hirschbeck, ever said he was. \n\n\n\nThat's your (perhaps colored by your partisanship of the Braves)\nperception.  Hirschbeck's view was that Gant was heading off for a long\nwalk, and in accordance with his instructions concerning speeding games up,\ndirected him into the batter's box.\n\n\nThe point is, based on the rulebook and the umpires' instructions, it was\n*not* an unreasonable request.\n\nThe Braves were already upset\n\n\nHad Gant done as instructed, you wouldn't have remembered the name of the\numpire.
I hear ya!  Then again, we must remember that we are indeed Cub fans, and\nthat the Cubs will eventually blow it.  After all, the Cubs are the easiest\nteam in the National League to root for.  No Pressure.  You know they will\nlose eventually.  Oh well, I suppose we must have faith.  After all, they\ndo look pretty good, and they don't even have Sandberg back yet.  \n\nCUBS IN '93!!!!!
Matt's problem is really more ability than attitude.  It isn't that he's\ngot it in his mind that he wants to swing away, but rather that he's\n(still) a total sucker for the curve ball.  It looked for a while in\n1990 that he was getting better but it's still his weak point.\n\nAs to whether it does him any good to have Bonds behind him, the \nnet.stat.mavens will probably tell you there's no reason that it\nshould, but if he thinks it will, it might be a self-fulfilling\nprophecy.\n\nAs to whether the Giants' lineup is optimal:  who knows?  Batting Bonds,\nthe team's best hitter, fifth does seem to be odd, but the #1 and #2\nhitters aren't exactly Messrs. OBA, so they aren't giving much up\nthere.  And although Clark isn't the overall offensive force that Bonds\nis, he seems better suited to the #3 spot.  Assuming, of course, that\nhe starts hitting one of these days...

And not the only quality Mariner pitcher.

Umpires are not required to call time out just because a player\nasks for time. Only in extreme cases, like dust in the pitcher's\nor hitter's eyes, should an umpire call time.\n\nThe batter has 20 seconds to get situated in the box and receive\na pitch. I'm against putting a giant clock (or any size clock\nfor that matter) up to count down 20 seconds between pitches and\nthe minute for warm-ups. But I think umpires should tell hitters\nto go to hell if they step out to get the sign or whatever, and\ninstruct the pitcher to pitch. The same goes for pitchers. Umps\nshould tell them to pitch or feint within 20 seconds or a ball\nwill be called. That's the way it should be.\n\n\nRyan Robbins\nPenobscot Hall\nUniversity of Maine

You know that often the best copy for the news is the one that isn't\npre-prepared.  They know Knepper has controversial ideas about women, they\npop some question about Postema.  (An interesting related question would \nbe whether the two ever appeared in the same game.  Off the top of my head,\nI guess "no."  If my guess is right, Knepper popped off about something that\nhad nothing to do with him -- and Postema gets a book for it, and he doesn't.)\n\n\nNow, why didn't *I* think of that?  :-)  :-)  :-)\n\nRG

He  \ndimmagio's.\n\nHenderson's stat's are probably closer to DiMaggio's than you\nthink.
I am just wondering whether the official MLB stats includes \nIntentional Walks in the BB category or not?
I really don't want to get into a DidSo-DidNot debate with you.  But\nthis is somewhat at the heart of our disagreement.  I did not say, \nnor did I imply, that I could predict the future.  You have inferred\nthat my comments meant this, and you have based your rebuttal of my\ncomments on the fact that statistical studies have demonstrated that\nthere is no reasonable basis for predicting future performance in\nregard to clutch hitting.\n\n\nSabo		1539	452	.294		259	59	.228\nSamuel		1564	383	.245		278	83	.299	\n\nThat is *your* opinion that Sabo is "clearly a better hitter" than\nSamuel.  The above data is for a 4-year period ending last season.\nLast season Samuel batted .272 while Sabo hit .244 (not park adjusted).\nThis season they are both hitting below .200, albeit Sabo with more\nat bats.  I will agree that over his career Sabo has been a better\nhitter than Samuel, but I will also remind you that Samuel has been\na better hitter in certain situations than Sabo.\n\nI did not predict that Sabo would choke, nor that Samuel would get a\nhit.  I expressed my opinion that had I been the Reds manager (or\neven a Reds fan) that I would prefer to have Samuel hit in that\nsituation than Sabo.\n\n\n\nAh.  "properly".  Yes.  I see.\n\n\nPlease help me.  What, exactly, is "everything else" that pointed to Sabo?\n\n\n\nI must say, I was not aware of the publication.  Can you email me the\ninformation regarding its availability?\n\nAnd I guess I must apologize to all of those who have done extensive \nstudy on, say, supply side economics.  I didn't mean to insult you.\nBut I never did believe you were on the right path.  I'm sorry for\nmy contrary opinion/position.  I also regret that I don't have the\nability to prove that you are wrong.  But you are.\n \n\n\nIt is what it says it is!\n\n\n\nThe "second" is *your* statement, not mine.\n\nWell, actually, I haven't yet.  But I'm not finished looking.\nThat is, I haven't yet found someone who hit significantly below\nhis overall batting average in clutch situations for the years \n1989 - 91, and then reversed that relationship in 1992.\n\n\n\nNope.  Sorry.  But if you were interested in a reason why I expect\nChris Sabo's ability to hit in the clutch to correlate from one\nyear to the next, I think I could.  If you were interested in a\nreason why I expect Joe Carter's ability to hit in the clutch to\ncorrelate from one year to the next, I think I could.  But you're\nnot interested in that, because you think that those conclusions\ncould only be valid if they could be extrapolated over the entire\nbaseball population.  And they can't be.\n\n\n\nThe problem here is that I *do* believe you.  I accept your work.\nI believe that trying to predict future clutch performance based\non prior clutch history is meaningless.  No better than a coin toss.\nI actually *do* accept your work.\n\nAs it happens, I also have an *opinion* that in certain situations,\nfor certain players, a history of superior or inferior ability to\nhit in the clutch might suggest a reason what such history could be\nvalid in projecting future player performance.  For that player.\nAnd Chris Sabo is one such player.\n\n\n\nWell, since I defer to your statistical wisdom, I think I must have\nan open mind.  Now we have to pose the same question to you.\n\n\n\n\n--	The Beastmaster
As will I, and the Ultimate Lurker.
Yes. It was the strangest series I have ever watched. And the ending\nfit perfectly.
discussing the fact that there were only 16 players who had ever hit 200  \nhomeruns and stolen 200 bases in their career (while HoJo was batting).   \nAnyone have a list?  Not as easy as it sounds to come up with all of them.   \nI couldn't.  Mays, Mantle, Aaron, Henderson, Morgan, Bonds (Dad), ???   \nFrank Robinson?  Molitor?  Yount?  Guessing now.  I'd be interested to see  \nthe whole list.
I don't actually have the answer to this one.\n\nBosio, after walking the first two batters, retired 27-straight for a\n"back-end" perfect game.\n\nHow many other games - including extra inning games - have seen a pitcher\nretire 27 straight, excluding official perfect games?\n\nThe only other instance of this I know about for sure is the famous Ernie\nShore game, which counts as a perfect one according to those goons in\nCooperstown. Shore came into the game when Boston Pitcher Babe Ruth got\nthrown out for arguing over the first-batter walk; Shore picked him off and\nretired 26 straight after that.\n\nMatt Wall * wall@cc.swarthmore.edu * Hey, I gotta job here, OK?
OK, OK, OK. First, my apologies for perhaps being untimely with this subject material and perhaps overly optimistic in my request, but here goes anyhow:\n\nI'm *very* interested in finding out how I might be able to get two tickets for the All Star game in Baltimore this year. My very aged folks live about 50 miles away and I know it would be a great thing for them to attend the game. I went with them, and my grandfather who got me into baseball as a small child, to the All Star game in DC many years ago. Although I'm now in the SF Bay Area, I'd *love* to be able to treat my folks to this game; it's absolutely the last chance they'd ever have to attend this g\n\n\n\n\name locally.\n\nAny info would be greatly appreciated!!!!
Just to add to this vein, consider that range of a first baseman is not\nthe only important thing.  He is IMO the best fielder of bad throws from\nthe other infielders.  I have seen him scoop balls out of the dirt, catch\nballs off a large bounce, take down balls over his head, wide, etc. ad\ninfinitum.  *And* he gets the out, much of the time.  Some of the things\nhe does to save his infielders of errors are amazing.  You have to give\nMattingly credit for being able to do all of that while keeping his foot\nnear the bag (yes, I am sure he gets a few calls because he is Mattingly :-)
Be patient. He has a sore shoulder from crashing into the wall.\nThe Cards will give him all the time he needs to come around.\nHe is their full time centerfielder.\nHe will not however steal as often this year as he is hitting\nclean-up.
Alan "All in all, it's just another" Sepinwall writes...\n\n\n	I agree.  However, I have to object.  Growing up in the early\n1980's and playing 2 years of Mario Mendoza-esque Little League, I was\ntold that since my hitting, well, sucked, I would do best to either\n"Walk, or take one in the face for the team".  I did both.  And, my\nYankee fan father would say, "Bat like Oscar Gamble".  So I did.  And my\ncareer OBP was about .550.\n	Not only was Oscar a fun guy to watch, but he had some pretty \ncool baseball cards and helped me become one of the best little league\nplayers in history.
Hi there,\n\n      I was wondering if anyone knew if John Wetteland was put on the DL again\n      after his first 15-day period was up? I read in the USA Today Sports \n      section that he is on for "surgery to repair broken toe", and was\n      wondering if that was new. I thought he was just letting it heal. \n\n      Another question, Is Derek Lilliquist the main closer for the Indians now\n      that Olin is gone. I need to know cause I need to find a reliever to \n      replace Wetteland and so far Lilliquist is doing ok. Any information on\n      either of the players would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your\n      time. \n\n\n      Ryan Robin.\n\n___________________________________________________________
And it is not Hirschbeck's job to help Gant with any of these difficulties.\nIf Gant can't gather his concentration for whatever reason, that just makes\nhim all the more meat in the batter's box.  The umpire's job is to \nmaintain flow of play.  Gant is not entitled to time to regather his\nfaculties.\n\nNor is anyone else.\n\n\nAbsolutely.  I think it'd be more accurate to say Gant was foolish.\n\n\nIf a disputed strike call is ample reason for a timeout, games would last\nabout nine-fifteen weeks, if Jack Morris or Dave "Whiner" Stieb were\npitching.  A disputed strike call is not sufficient for a time out.\nSuck it up, get back in the box, and never badmouth the blue.  They're\nnot going to change their mind, and you're just going to come across\nas a pinhead, which won't help you with the borderline calls.\n\nFTR - I never speak to umpires when I don't know them personally, nor\ndo I glance at them, or react to calls.  As a result, I think I get more\nthan my fair share of borderline calls at the plate, because I have a\nrep of having a good eye.  (Actually, there are a lot of negative\nconnotations that go with that rep, including copious questions about\nmy masculinity, party affiliation, and sexual preference.)\n\n\nIrrelevant.  He was wasting time THEN.\n\n\n1.  Because it's not his job.\n\n2.  Because setting the precedent of cutting slack THERE can easily \n    extend to those 3 hour games.  (Kind of like the phantom DP.)\n\n\nGant hurt himself, and the Braves disrupted the game.  Your biases are\nexposed, and I'm sitting here defending umpires and the SF Giants,\nwhich is like Phyllis Schlafly defending Gary Segura, Jack Kevorkian,\nand the Swedish Abortion Team.  \n\n\nI believe Terry said the magic word.  There are some truly quick ways\nto get tossed from a ballgame.  For a primer, email me.\n\nGood ways to get tossed from a game:\n\n1.  Ask Ken Kaiser if he got his money back from Nutri-System.\n2.  Kiss Rich Garcia on the lips, and say "Hi, Honey, I'm Home!"\n3.  Goose Eric Gregg.\n4.  Ask Bruce Froemming if his parents had any children that lived.\n5.  Get Naked.\n\n(Source: The Greg Spira Book of Diamond Ettiquette, as told to\n Peter Gammons.  1991, Collier Press.)
When I say "black," I mean US-born black people for the purposes of this\ndiscussion.  Hispanic players were in baseball before 1947, and one \nteam in the 50's signed lots of hispanics because they went over better\nwith the local audience than blacks did.  \n\n\nDon't know.  But remember: this is the country that had special racial\nlaws for one group and one group only: blacks.  Our national history \nincludes huge, long-term, global tensions regarding the black minority; \nthe hispanic minority, while often discriminated against, has never been\nthe object of national obsession.\n\n\nAbsolutely.  As I said before, I expect that this effect is disappearing.\nBut it certainly did exist, and all out talk of TWG's and all that is \nnot without some small reason.\n\n\nWell, there's the list.  Go for it!  I'll cull some more names as I go.\nI expect you're right, btw.

writes...\n\n\n\n\nOh, probably.\n\nMs. Nichols has given the average game times (and average runs scored) for\n1983 and 1992.  (A very nice piece of information, Ms. Nichols.  Who knows?\nShe may be listening, and not have me in her kill file after all.)  Those\nnumbers indicate somewhere in the neighborhood of half-a-run *less* being\nscored per game, and the games taking 15 minutes *longer*.  Something is\nbeing done now that wasn't done ten years ago, which is extending the games\nby 15 minutes.  Ms. Nichols thinks it's more pitches.  Given the increasing\nspecialization of pitchers, it wouldn't surprise me.\n\nIf it's not simply more pitches, though, I don't think it's unreasonable\nto think that something can be done to get ten of those minutes back.  Then\nI get a couple more from shortening the warmup time for a relief pitcher\nafter he comes in, and a couple more still from enforcing existing rules,\nwhich have been stated in other posts in this thread (and other related ones).\n\nThe problem is, who decides whether that time is "wasted?"  You don't seem\nto think it is at all.  Right now, I think it is, although I have heard one\ncase favoring giving the reliever all the warmups he thinks he needs (the\ndifference in mounds between the field and pen) -- but who knows?  If the\nrules get changed, maybe something I didn't foresee will happen to change my\nmind.  But you can bet a lot of minds would fail to foresee the same thing,\nor else nothing will be changed.\n\nRG

Hey folks,\n\nSaw the Giants play ball at the 'Stick Saturday, April 17.  It was the game\nwhere Pendelton broke up the scoreless tie in the ninth with a two-out,\ntwo-run homer to right to win it.  (It wasn't the game where the fans \nthrew the give-away "fotoballs" onto the field in response to the homer --\ntoo bad, huh?)\n\nWell, the 'Stick is still cold.  The Saturday game ended at 5:45pm, and it\nwas cold then.  I can't imagine night games in April at the 'Stick.  The\nwind kicked up a little, too, and I got this idea.\n\nAt most games, there's a pile of hot dog wrappers and cups and trash on\nthe field a lot of the time.  I propose a Kid's Clean-up Corps composed\nmainly of 10-12 year old kids who would love nothing better than to run\nout on the field in the fifth inning (when the guy in the Toro smooths\nthe infield) and grab the trash.\n\nIt might not be glamorous, but at that age I probably would have given\nanything to be on the field with the ballplayers.  Everybody wins here!\n\nWhaddaya think?

Oh, yea, and Chris Bosio pitched a NO-HITTER.  One over the minimum, two\nbases on ball in the first inning, one runner left, 95 pitches.  I listened\nto the game on radio and listening to Dave Niehaus call the game was a\nreal treat (as long as they keep Ron Fairly quite, I doubt if anyone is\nbetter than Niehaus -- but that Fairly guy is really annoying me).\n\nBut, I guess if Clemens or Viola had been pitching, it would have \nbeen a different story :-)\n\nTwo shutouts in two nights against the hottest, best hitting team in\nMajor League baseball ....  Pretty impressive in any league.\n\nMan, if Johnson, Bosio and Hanson keep going the Mariners could be a \nreally interesting team to follow this year.  Also, John Cummings (rookie)\nhas had three solid outings with no support.  If Fleming comes back \nthis may be the best starting staff in the American League this year\n(relief is another story, though - grimace).\n\nToo cool.  The first no-hitter that I have been able to follow from \nstart to end.  And again, I think Niehaus will win some kind of award\nfor the way he called the game.  The guy is truly a joy to listen to --\nhe deserves a pennant race ...
Warren, I agree with your premise... but... The Babe won on\ntwo teams. That's right, he was part of the Red Sox Dynasty of the\n1910s. And everyone knows that the Yankee Dynsaty wouldn't have\nhappened without thier famous bullpen catcher whose name escapes me at\nthe moment.
I stopped going to A's games some years ago while I still lived inthe\nBay Area for exactly this reason.  I believe the length of their games\nhas been institutionalized by LaRussa/Duncan.  They encourage their\npitchers to be overly deliberate, to throw to first often, to study\nthe catchers' signals, and so on.  And almost every A's hitter takes\na step out of the box after every pitch.  This is not, imo, a coincidence.\nThis is planned.  And I hate it.\n\nAs for the Gant situation, I did not see the game or the replays.  But\nI do wonder.  What if Gant had requested a time out?  Would Hirschbeck\nhave been required to give it to him?  Could he have denied the requst?\nFor all he (the ump) knew, Gant could have had dirt in his eye.
So, which one will officially be the end of the world? ;)\n\nI can see the end of the WS now:\n"Well folks, here it is.  Bottom of the ninth; bases loaded; Full count on\nSandberg in this 1-1 game.  Clemens winds, heres the pitch.  Swung on and it is a \nline drive to center.  Zupcic moves to his left. He's there and.....\n*****ZOT******
Okay, I think we all agree that singles hitters should take a\nstrike or two and try to get on base any way they can.\n\nSo the "No Power/Impatient" guys have no excuse.\nThe "No Power/Patient" guys are doing the right thing.\n\nNow the "Impatient/Power" guys (how could you leave out the Big Cat?).\nWould these guys have a better slugging percentage if they took\nmore pitches?   Perhaps, but I doubt it.  If you tell Joe Carter\nto go up there and take a few pitches, he will draw more walks, but\nhe also won't hit as many frozen ropes into the bleachers because\nhe is more likely to hold back on a pitch that he used to drive.\n\nThe "Patient/Power" guys?   Joe Morgan had a small strike zone and\nRickey Henderson has "a strike zone the size of Hitler's heart" \nso they get their walks based on the small zone.\n\nLook at the other 5 guys: Thomas, Bonds, McGwire, Ruth and Williams.  Wow!\nA lot of pitchers would rather nibble at the corners and maybe\nwalk these guys that to throw a clear strike to them.\nThe pitchers would do better (in my opinion) by just coming after\nthem with a good fastball for a strike on the first pitch, but pitchers\nwould rather nibble, go 2-0 or 3-1 and then get hurt.
There is a fine line between "getting players' input" and "knuckling\nunder to players' demands."  A manager, much like a military officer,\nneeds to have his (her) players' complete obedience and respect during\na game.  After the game, it's no big deal, but when there is no time \nto do more than react, players must trust the manager or the team often\nfalls apart (see: Boston Red Sox, ff. :) )  \n\nStrawberry's demeanor as represented by the media, often sounds like\ndemands.  I suspect that a comment like "I enjoy hitting fourth; I'm\nused to it" would get pretty brutally misinterpreted by the media if\nit came from Strawberry.  Russ Porter quoted Strawberry as saying,\n"I feel more comfortable hitting cleanup and I think I perform best\nin that role."  (Paraphrased by my memory and bias.)  That seems like\na fairly non-petulant answer to what was almost certainly a question \nlike, "How do you feel about being moved to the third spot in the order?"\nA more media-sensitive player might answer "The manager knows what he is\ndoing.  If he thinks that batting me third will help the team, then I\nam all for it."  We'd ignore that answer as brown stuff, so it seems a\nlittle bit of an overreaction to brand Darryl's response as petulant.\n\nPersonally, I think his argument is nonsense and that it really doesn't\nmatter much in which order the #2-5 players in the order are batted,\nexcept for personal stats.  If I were Darryl, I'd probably answer that\nquestion, "The number four spot gets a few more RBI opportunities and I get\npaid for RBIs.  I think it is best for me to bat fourth, but I am willing\nto hit third if Tommy thinks it will benefit the team."  or something like\nthat.  It would be helpful at salary time--my RBIs were down because I was\nhitting third--and make him sound like a "team" player.  Since Strawberry\nwill not likely go through arbitration, but use the free agent market for\nhis next contract, maybe that argument is useless, but it would help   \nhis image with the media without appearing to be totally content-free.
Can anyone out there tell me why they call left-handed pitchers\n"Southpaw"?\n\nAlso the story on how the term originated.\n\nThanks!! \n\n\nGo Cubs!
No way -- gotta be Walter Johnson.  All were with Washington.\nCarlton spent too long in St. Louis to collect less than 700 there.\n\n\n	I'd also guess Hough due to his length of tenure though I suspect \nBobby Witt wasn't far behind.  Maybe even Jenkins snuck in close....\n\n\n	Fingers had to have achieved 100 with either MIL or with SD so, yes,\nI'd go with that guess.  Otherwise I was thinking that Reardon has a better\nchance of having 100 with MIN along with (I would think) easily reaching 100 \nwith MON.\n\n\n	Gotta be Willie Mays...I am fairly sure he had over 300 steals in his\ncareer.\n\n\n	Hmmm...Leary is a really good point.  I'd forgotten about him.  Well,\nif nothing else, there are plenty of ex-Met pitchers in the category of\n"could have lost to all teams" -- Koosman, Leary, Torrez, Ryan, Seaver....\nI guess the best three guesses would be Leary, Ryan, and either Seaver or\nKoosman.
BASEBALL.....ALWAYS\nhow he
I agree with Nick.  What's the big deal about long games?  If you want\nto watch baseball, there's that much more baseball to watch.  And yes,\nbaseball includes the space between plays as well as the plays themselves.\n\nI suspect that a lot of the complaining about long games, especially when\nit's coming from TV people, has to something to do with advertising.\nProbably time "wasted" in the middle of an inning, say by a batter\nstepping out of the box to fiddle with his gloves, or by a pitcher\nwalking around behind the mound trying to collect his thoughts, could\notherwise be sold as advertising time.
You haven't been facing major league pitching.      \n\n  Maybe more... you have to be good at the plate, and most\n\nSTATS did a little study in the 1993 Scoreboard book entitled "Can\nyou hit sacrifice flies on purpose?"  A summary of the findings:\n\nOver the 5 year period, sac-fly type fly balls were produced 17.6\npercent of the time in situations where a sac fly was useful, and \n17.7 percent of the time when a sac fly wasn't useful.\n\nThey looked at the leaders in sac flies, and found that the leaders\nin sac flies - in other words, the guys you would expect to be good\nat it it - hit sac fly type fly balls only 3% more often when they\nneeded to - a difference way too small to be the result of a skill.\nEssentially, the players who hit a lot of sac flies seem to do\nso because they hit hit sac fly type flies often, with and without\na runner on third.\n\nSTATS concludes "So it appears conclusive that hitters cannot hit\nsacrifice flies on purpose - even if they practice in the bATTING\ncage."

[stuff about Ron Gant incident deleted] \n\n	I agree that Hirschbeck was just doing what he was instructed to do\nand also that Gant should have listened to him.  However, what is with this\npolicy of trying to speed up the games.  You are the first person \n( non-mediot ) I have seen endorse this policy.  I have no problem with the\nlength of games at all and am tired of the ESPN crowd ( and other announcers )\nbitching about it.  I have never been in a ballpark filled with people looking\nat their watches and shouting "Hurry up!"  If I cough up big bucks for a \nticket, I don't mind a game that last more than 2:10.  I really don't\nunderstand it.  \n\n	Games are longer now for several reasons:  more pitching changes,\nmore basestealing ( and throws to first ), etc...I think a very small factor\nis the increased time it takes Jose Canseco/ Deion Sanders/ [insert fancy\nshowboat ballplayer here] to arrange their jewelry prior to stepping in the\nbatter's box.  My impression is that sportcasters and writers have made this\nan issue because they like shorter games - they get to head back to hotel\nbar, eat steaks, get drunk, tell stupid jokes with their pals and chase\nstewardesses around the bar.  Sure they want the game over with.  Print \njournalists have a slightly more legitimate reason for wanting faster games:\nthey have deadlines.  The ESPN guys on baseball tonight drive me crazy - they\nconstantly harp on this - primarily because they often have to work late \nwhen the game goes longer than 2:30.\n\n	Maybe I am just a ne'er-do-well with nothing better to do, but I \nwould like to hear reasons why the longer games upset you.\n\n	As a parenthetical note, it seems the league is in any case fighting\na losing battle this year.  The increased offense thus far will certainly \nspoil any hopes of getting the games over with more quickly.
The Phillies finished third 2 years ago.\n\n\nThe Phillies' opponents haven't hit much better
Tim Shippert recently posted summaries of last year's Defensive Average\nstats in terms of the Linear Weights estimated run-value of defensive\nperformances, compared to league average.  I've combined those with my\nposition-adjusted MLV numbers to come up with first-approximation total\nrun values for players last year.  We can use these as a springboard for\nreconsideration of the MVP award.\n\nMajor caveats:  these numbers include no defensive park adjustment, so if\nSan Diego really is just a question of odd scoring or gopher holes in the\ninfield, that will cause some inaccuracies.  The offensive numbers are\nposition-adjusted, but not park adjusted, so we have to deflate some and\ninflate others to be fair.  Finally, we still don't know what to do about\ncatchers, and I have no idea how to evaluate the defensive contributions \nof Tony Phillips and Bip Roberts.  \n\nHaving said that, there are still some surprises.  Let's look National\nLeague first.  All numbers in total runs contributed over the season.\n\n	Player		Offense		Defense		Total\n\n	Sandberg	  44		  32		 76\n	Bonds		  67		   3		 70\n	Walker		  26		  26		 52\n	Justice		  14		  33		 47\n	Daulton	 	  44		  ??		 44+?\n	Larkin		  36		   4		 40\n	Grace		  13		  27		 40\n\nAs I see it, these are the legitimate MVP candidates from last season.\nIf you deflate Sandberg's offense a wee bit for playing in Wrigley, you\nget essentially a dead heat.  Had Bonds been his usual defensive self, it\nwouldn't have been close, but that apparently wasn't the case.  Darren\nDaulton needs 22 or more defensive runs to make up the offensive difference,\nand I couldn't tell you whether that's easy or impossible.  A good case \ncould be made for any of Sandberg, Bonds, or Daulton as top dude.\n\nMy personal vote:  Bonds, Sandberg, Daulton, Walker, Justice.\n\n\nIn the American League:\n\n	Player		Offense		Defense		Total\n\n	Ventura		  22		  34		 56\n	Martinez	  47		  -1		 46\n	B. Anderson 	  21		  25		 46\n	Thomas		  47		  -5		 42\n	R. Henderson	  25		  16		 41\n	Raines		  17		  23		 40\n	Tettleton	  33		  ??		 33+?\n\nOK, let's see a show of hands: how many of you picked Robin Ventura as top\nplayer in the AL last year?  I certainly didn't, but I'd have a hard time\narguing against him at this point.  Yes, I know these numbers are only\napproximate, but that's a big gap between him and the #2 guy.  Also, those\nof you who thought Rickey Henderson stank last year are out of your minds.\n\nOnce again, there's a catcher in the ointment.  If calling a game is as\nimportant as it might be, 23 runs is easy to make up (or give away).  TAke\na guess, folks; I don't think we can do any better than that.\n\nMy personal vote (excluding pitchers):\n\n	Ventura, Tettleton, Anderson, Martinez, Henderson.\n\nI'm a big Frank Thomas fan, but I have to admit to a bias in favor of\nbalanced offensive/defensive contribution, which should have a higher\nleverage in W/L record than an equal shift that is lots of offense with\nnegative defense.\n\nFor the record:\n\n	Carlos Baerga		  27		  5		  32\n	Roberto Alomar		  35		 -2		  33\n\nForget it; it's a wash.\n\nLet me also take this opportunity to admit that I was grossly wrong regarding\nDon Mattingly's defense this past season.  Don recovered brilliantly from his\nweak '90 and '91 to end up with\n\n	Mattingly		  -1		  17		  16 runs\n\nwhich is clearly an above-average first baseman.  However, it's still 18 runs\nbehind Mark McGwire, 26 runs behind Frank Thomas, and 7 runs behind John\nOlerud.  On the other hand, it's ahead of Rafael Palmeiro, Cecil Fielder, and\nevery other AL first baseman not yet mentioned.
I know there's been a lot of talk about Jack Morris' horrible start,\nbut what about Dennis Martinez.  Last I checked he's 0-3 with 6+ ERA.\nIs the ageless wonder finally showing his age?  Does he usually start\noff the season so slowly?  I know he plans to start tonight.   I hope\nhe comes around....\n\nI would appreciate any feedback concerning outlook on rest of Dennis\nMartinez's season...\n\nThanks in advance,
Can someone in this net post a Yankee Schedule?\nI need this right away.
Not bad. We had a similar situation. Slowpitch softball, bases loaded,\nweakest hitter at the plate. He hits a line drive over the third\nbaseman's head that hooked and hooked and finally landed ten feet in\nfoul ground, almost hitting the fence down that side of the field.\nBut the umpire called fair ball! I was coaching third, yelling at evrybody \nto move up a base. The ump's position: "it was still fair when it\npassed third base". \nWhy the other team didn't immediately protest I'll never know; we\ncertainly weren't going to argue about it, since every body did manage\nto advance one base safely.\n\nThere was also the time when a batted ball ricocheted off my (runner\nfrom second base) leg, fielded by the SS, steps on second to force the\nrunner from first, and throw to first in time for what the umpire\ncalled a triple play; protest removed when we won the game anyway.

The only person\nleft to bat 4th is Williams.

Nah, let's reserve rec.sports.idiots for people who POST\nobvious flamebait, like yourself.\n\nIf someone posts something as controversial (not to mention\nidiotic) as what Austin posted in a widely accessed newsgroup,\nsomeone should challenge the statement.  There is a school\nof thought that suggests that silence = consent.  Whereas\nthis idea may not apply to everything in life, it certainly\nSHOULD apply to a forum of public discussion, which r.s.b.\nis.\n\nIf you've been reading r.s.b. lately, you'll find\nthat even elementary school children have had access\nto our postings, alibet in an edited form.  It's making me\nthink a little more carefully about some of the things I post.\n\nIn conclusion, if someone like Austin wants to post his drivel\nin some obscure newsgroup that I don't read, fine.  He's got the\nright to rant, rave, and drool all he wants to in the name\nof free speech.  But if he drools in a newsgroup that I read,\nthen I will support the right of anyone to provide rebuttal\nto his drooling.\n\nNow, of course, you don't have to read any of this.\nAnd if you want to cut down on flames, then\n\n\n\n\nDON'T POST FLAMEBAIT!\n(You don't have to respond to flames, either.

writes...\n\n\n\n\nI hesitate to make assumptions about other people when they write, but\nneither of you two *sound* as though you have kids, and you may not have\nspouses either.\n\nConsider a night game starting at 7:05 PM EST.  (It was 7:35 last year,\nbut Cleveland showed what I thought was good sense in pushing it back.)\nI go, and I'm into it until 11 PM minimum.  Extra innings could put me\nwell past midnight.  Even without extra innings, if the score is beyond\n2-1 I can't see my family that night at all.  If the next day is a workday,\nI may have to bag that as well.  Further, the later the game goes, the\ncolder it gets on the shore of Lake Erie.\n\nAll that stuff enters into my consideration of even going to a game.  If\nyou say you don't care about whether the game is sped up, IMPO you are \nsaying you don't care where the time goes, and that the game is for people\nwho don't have families and don't have to get up for work the next day.\n\nRG
^^^^^^\n\n	Sure they might. If an error is recorded on, for example, a\nground ball, ie the batter would otherwise be out, it is officially a\nhitless at bat. If it's some other type of error (Greenwell lets a\nsingle go by), it doesn't effect the OBP. But, most errors are\ncounted.
I don't think that it is "obvious" that "lots" of people are willing\nto pay the price.  I'm sure someone out there in net-land has some\nfacts about trends in attendance regarding percentage of capacity\nsold.  But even if the trends are relatively flat, you have to consider\nwhat is happening on a team-by-team basis.\n\nWhen the TV money dries up, franchises will be seeking to supplant the\nlost revenues from alternative sources.  One of the best sources may\nbe ticket sales.\n\nExample 1:	The Dodgers\n\n	The Dodgers can count on a strong base of season ticket sales\n	and *probably* believe that they have the ability to raise\n	prices without hindering revenues.  I certainly think that is\n	true.\n\nExample 2:	The Padres\n\n	They will be lucky to average 10,000 fans a game this year.\n	If they raise prices, less.  If they want to increase their\n	overall revenue base, the best thing they can do is put a\n	winning team on the field.  But given that won't happen (it\n	won't), they can probably make more money by lowering ticket\n	prices and running frequent promotions.  Will they do that?\n	I have no idea.  But they won't increase prices, because it\n	won't work *for them*.\n\n\n\n\nThe only strange powers at work here are the forces of the market place.\nEach team's market is somewhat different, and each owner is going to\nbe faced with a unique set of circumstances about how to deal with those\nmarket forces.  As a buiness manager, I would never *want* to lower my\nprices, but sometimes that strategy is necessary, and sometimes it works.\nYou have to consider everything if you want continued success.\n\n\n\n\n--	The Beastmaster
I would be veru interested also, if there is one.\nCould someone please send me some info?
I looked up "might" to see why you selected that particular word,\nand discovered the line ". . . to express permission, liberty,\nprobability, possibility . . ."  It also said something about being a\n"polite" alternative to "may."  The presence of "probability, possibility"\ncan certainly be used to partially explain your word selection.  \nSo, I'd say to all extents and purposes, "Yes, you might."  In fact, you did.\n(Not that you were asking *me* specifically.)\n\n	The next question is, why would a mailing list be "more" appropriate?\nWe don't all get mailing lists.  We surely don't all get mailing lists about\nthe teams about which we are most enthused.  So it seems to me r.s.baseball\nis an appropriate place to look for information about teams one doesn't\nnecessarily follow day-to-day.\n\n	This is not intended as flamage, but rather is an attempted answer,\nas you posed your post as a question.
I was in fact going to suggest that Roger take his way of discussion over\nto r.s.football.pro. There this kind of hormone-only reasoning is the\nstandard. Being he canadian, and hockey what it is, I would have suggested\nthat r.s.h would work too. It is important in a thread that everyone\ninvolved use the same body part to produce a post (brain being the organ\nof choice here).
I want All-Star Tickets does anyone know how I can get\nsome?\n\nAre they for public sale or are they sold out?\n\nOr do you just have to work for a company with some\n\nAnyway any answers would be appreciated.\n\nPlease E-mail me.
After a quick start, Pena has been stuck in a rut.  Torre gave Alicea\nthe start to try to get Pena out of whatever funk he is in.  It has\nworked in the past.\n\nBob
Is there any judgement call on the part of the scorer for sac fly RBI's?\nThis is the situation that brought the question up:\n\nThe Red Sox were up in the bottom of the 9th by a score of 5-1.  The Mariners\nhad the bases loaded with 1 out.  The batter hits a fly to center, which the\nfielder catches.  The runner at third tags and scores without a throw.  \n\nNow, without a judgement call (and I don't think there is one), this is an RBI\nfor the batter.  It seems to me that a better name for this would be "defensive\nindifference", since it doesn't really matter whether the guy at third scores\nat that point.  (I know, I can think of several "If the Mariners stole third\nand second, which opening the base would allow, and then the batter hit a\ngrounder which the third baseman gets deep in the hole between himself and\nthird, he wouldn't have a play at home, third, or second for the out, and\nmaybe he therefore can't make the throw to first to get the last out, etc...\nscenarios, too.  But does it _really_ matter if this guy scores this way when\nyou're down by 4?  If the tying run is going to score, so is the guy on third.)\n\nThe point is that the batter (IMO) shouldn't get "credit" (an RBI) for utterly\nfailing to do his job - which at this point is to get a hit or a walk, not\ntrade an out for one run.  What do you guys think?
For an expansion team?  I'm pretty sure I would go with the rings, as long\nas their salaries and ages weren't too high.  I would want the fans to be \nable to identify the players.  I would like a championship attitude in the \nclubhouse.\n\nAs for Larkin and Griffin?  Salaries aside, I would have to consider which\nplayer is likeliest to contribute to a WS victory.  Past performance, age and\nattitude would all be integral to my decision.  I certainly wouldn't just\nhaul out my copy of Gillete and pick Larkin, as many others would.  And,\nunlike many others who post to this group, I hardly consider myself quali-\nfied to make those kinds of decisions.\n\n\nI have never been able to believe it about myself, to tell you the truth.\nIt's like banging your head against a stone wall.\n\n--
There is a correction to the note I posted for today's update:\n\nThis is how it read:\n        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nOf course, last Saturday was April 17th. People who requested those scores\nshould receive them by Friday the 23rd. Thanks.\n\nJoe Hernandez\n-- \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJoseph Hernandez          |    RAMS  | |    /.\  ******* _|_|_  / |   LAKERS\njtchern@ocf.Berkeley.EDU  |   KINGS  | |__ |   | DODGERS _|_|_  | |   RAIDERS\njtcent@soda.Berkeley.EDU  |  ANGELS  |____||_|_| *******  | |  |___|  CLIPPERS
