It wasn't Jesus who changed the rules of the game (see quote above),\nit was Paul.\n\nCheers,\nKent
The killing of the ATF agents is a separate issue.  My point is that many\nchildren died because of Koresh defending himself.  Did he have what you\ncall the "moral right" to keep those children in a dangerous enviroment in\norder to defend himself?
Hello Ceci:\n\n     My name is Tony and I have a few comments on your "rosicrucian"\nadventure. I hereby state that I am not claiming or denying membership in\nany Order, fraternity etc. with or without the word "Rosicrucian" in the \nname of the organization. I only claim having done some "homework" :-)\n\n     This is intended as a friendly article and if at times it seems\ndifferent, it's my lack of writing skills showing, nothing else. Heck,\nEnglish may be my second language! (And then again maybe not by now :-)\n\n     I proceed:\n     Let's start with the name "Rosicrucian". I took me a long time to come\nto the conclusion that there is a difference between a *member* of a\n"rosicrucian" body and BEING *a* ROSICRUCIAN. So when you say that you met\nsome 'rosicrucians' you mean "members of a group that calls themselves\nrosicrucian". At least that is what your observation suggests :-)\n\n     I'd prefer if you would have stated up front that it was the Lectorium\nRosicrucianum, only because they may be confused, by some readers of this\nnewsgroup, with the Rosicrucian Order AMORC based (the USA Jurisdiction) in\nSan Jose, CA; this being the RC org with the most members (last time I\nlooked). Of course, "most members" does not *necessarily* mean "best".\n\n     Anyway, the Lectorium Rosicrucianum claims they\ndescend (at least in part) from what was the "Gold-und-Rosenkreuz" (Golden\nand Rosy Cross), from the 18th century. There were two "Golden and Rosy\nCross", the first (chronologically) more alchemical, the second with\nMasonic tinges, but their history is the subject of a complete chapter :-).\n\n     "You'll have to trust me" when I tell you that if that\nlecture/class/whatever had been presented by AMORC, it is unlikely that you\nwould have had the same impression, i.e., you'd probably have had a\npositive impression more likely than a negative one, IMHO. \n\n     Again, instead of R:s, it should be "Lectorium Rosicrucianum" :-). It\nis curious to know that 3 other RC 'orders' (in the USA) claim to be *non-\nsectarian*.\n\n     The Cathars were a 'heretic' christian sect that directly challenged\nthe 'authority' of the medieval catholic church. They flourished during the\n12th century, century which saw the religious zeal expressed in the\ncrusades and also the growing disillusion with the catholic church and the\nworldly ways of its clerics. It was largely in response to the church's\nunseemly pomp and splendor that Catharism took root, first in northern\nItaly, then throughout the south of France.\n\n\n\n     I don't see nothing *fundamentally* wrong with "us containing\nsomething divine"... And yes I don't like phrases like "eternal bliss"\neither! :-)\n\n     For a moment I thought you were referring to Madison Ave :-)\n(Madison avenue in New York City is where the most influential (read\n$$$) *commercial* advertising is produced here in the USA :-)\n\nPeace,\n\nTony
Then we all live happily ever after. :-)\n\nSeriously, if we all agreed on the circumstances we're in, I suspect we'd all\nagree on the best course of action.  Unfortunately, I have no confidence that\nsuch a situation will ever arise. \n\nSome of us think there's a big God in the sky, some don't.  Some think\nthey've been chosen by God, others disagree.  Some think they are infallible,\nothers think otherwise.  Until those disagreements over circumstances can be\nironed out, there's little hope of everyone agreeing.\n\n\nYes.  I think that, for example, only a vanishingly small number of people\nwould hold that there's a frame of reference in which gassing six million\nJews is good.  So that's probably about as close to an objective moral value\nas I've encountered in my life so far.\n\n\nWell, I think your example's poor.  If the bomb's in Iraq, for example, and\nwas dropped by an American plane, many people would hold that it was a moral\nact.\n\n\nHmm.  So these moral values have a perceptible physical presence?\n\n\nRight, and the chain ends right there.  The buck stops with me.  It's not an\ninfinite regress.\n\n\nRight.  The key point, however, is that there are vanishingly few of these\nmoral issues where we can get 99.9% of people to agree on the outcome for all\nframes of reference (and agree on the frames of reference...)\n\n\nI can't manage either.  Killing Hitler using a car bomb would have been a\nterrorist act, but I have to admit that I couldn't exactly condemn it. \nAlthough there are tricky philosophical issues to do with hindsight...\n\n\nI think that circumstances have already arisen where terrorism would have\nbeen better than peace.  Better in terms of numbers of innocent people\nkilled.  Assuming it was successful terrorism, of course.
The universe, mirrored in a puddle.\nIsn't it amazing how there *always* seems to be *another* bottle of bheer there?\n\nAleph *one* bottles of beer on the wall, Aleph *one* null bottles of beer!\n\n	you, too, are a puddle.\n	As above, so below.
= In article <1993Apr21.231552.24869@organpipe.uug.arizona.edu>,\n= \n= Hmm, it seems that this is the core of Christianity then, you \n= have to feel guilty, and then there's this single personality\n= that will save you from this universal guilt feeling.\n= \n= Brian, I will tell you a secret, I don't feel guilty at all,\n= I do mistakes, and I regret them, however I've never had this\n= huge guilt feeling hanging over my shoulder.\n\nI will tell you another secret.  I get this burning sensation in my\nhand every time I hold it over a candle.  The pain does not fill my entire\nbody, and I'm told the longer I hold it here, the less it'll hurt (it'll\neventually burn up the nerves, or so I'm told).  So I suppose I should just\nignore the pain, because holding my hand over the candle is something I just\nwant to do. I've got the right, don't I?\n\nYour body feels pain to let you know something is wrong.  It's your body's\nalarm system informing you that something needs your attention.\n\nA fever tells you that you are sick, and need some sort of care.\n\nGuilt can be seen as that "emotional or spiritual" alarm, just informing you\nthat there is something that you've done that "requires your attention".\n\nIt doesn't require a "personality type" to become a believer.  It requires\nsomeone who is willing to listen to themselves, their body & soul.  \n\n= All I know is that I don't know everything. And frankly speaking\n= I don't care, life is fun anyway. I recognize that I'm not \n= perfect, but that does not hinder me from have a healthy\n= and inspiring life.\n\nFor several years all I knew is I really liked dropping 'cid (LSD).\nFrankly speaking, I didn't really care.  It was fun anyway.\n\nIt didn't matter that every child my wife and I want to have are at a \n*tremendously* greater risk of serious birth defects.\n\nFor several years all I knew is I really liked having sex with as many women\nas I could convice.  Frankly speaking, I didn't care.  \n\nI didn't care that I was putting each one of them at risk (as well as their\nfuture partners).\n\nIt didn't matter that for the first decade of my marriage, my wife and I\nwill have the worry that possibly that last sneeze meant something *much*\nworse than a cold.\n\n= \n= There are humans that subscribe to the same notion. The nice\n= thing is that when you finally shake off this huge burden,\n= the shoulders feel far more relaxed!\n\nThe nice thing about pain killers, if you take enough, you won't care about \nthe fever, shortness of breath or pain.
I wasn't sure if this was the right newsgroup to post this to, but I guess\nthe misc is there for a reason.  Here goes...  I am getting married in June to \na devout (Wisconsin Synod) Lutheran.  I would classify myself as a strong \nagnostic/weak athiest.  This has been a a subject of many discussions between\nus and is really our only real obstacle.  We don't have any real difficulties \nwith the religious differences yet, but I expect they will pop up when we have \nchildren.  I have agreed to raise the\nchildren "nominally" Lutheran.  That is, Lutheran traditions, but trying to\nkeep an open mind.  I am not sure if this is even possible though.  I feel that\nthat the worst quality of being devoutly religous is the lack of an open mind.\n\n     Anyway, I guess I'll get on with my question.  Is anyone in the same \nsituation and can give some suggestions as to how to deal with this?  We've \ntaken the attitude so far of just talking about it a lot and not letting \nanything get bottled up inside.  Sometimes I get the feeling we're making this \nmuch bigger than it actually is.  Any comments would be greatly appreciated.  \nAlso, please e-mail responses since I don't get a chance to read this group\noften.  :-(
As opposed to Universal or Catholic or "FourSquare Gosple". I think that\n   the Greek Orthodox Church would take high offense at your misuse of the\n   word. Your version of Christianity is neither mainstream nor bible derived\n   you make claims of bible-centricity that are not derivable soley from the\n   Bible.  About six-seven months ago, you claimed that your primary objection\n   to the LDS was that "our" doctrine was not bible-derived, And now this\n   (and other) claims can be shown, are also not bible interpeting bible.\n\n\n \n	Simple truths... oh for example?   \n\n\n\n       "paradise exalted to heaven"\n\n	paradise wasn't equal to heaven and _now_ it is? Yet you claim that\n 	peeple can not be exalted to heaven, nicht wahr?\n\n\n	When I read the story, I found that  "Abraham's Bosom" wasn't so much\n	a place, but somewhere the rich man could see and talk to Abraham?\n\n	Gee this is fairly close to what the LDS call spirit prison, and what\n        you have called false doctrine...\n\n    [ vers deleted reproduced below quoted from the SunSpot Gopher Archive ]\n\n \n\n   This part is _not_ supported from scripture, nor does it support your\n   claim that the "paradise" where Christ descended was exalted.\n\n   Making such claims on this little "evidence" ignores the witness of the\n   scripture\n\n   Using this to argue that paradise or spirit prison, is now changed from\n   a Pre-Easter postion to post-easter by God postion is not supportable.\n \n   Makeing such a claim requires more evidence than you have given here...\n\n\n\n\n  Yes, and your reasons are in general not supported by any direct reading\n  of the scriptures. You have demonstrated that you claims to scriptural \n  "proof" need to be cross-checked. The referencs that you supply often do\n  not support your postion, if they are read in the context of the scripture.\n\n\n\n	How about that those who have been in paradise, and have accepted\n	the gosple will be judged of Jesus Christ, and then return to the\n	presence of God. Is that somehow different from your expressed view\n	that the paradise spoken of (or "Abraham's Bosom")\n	Should we go back and discuss your view on why the Angle of the Lord\n	is the Lord again... ;-)
Well, let me see if I can explain it.  It's similar to collecting coins,\nor stamps, or campaign buttons, or coke bottles, or juke boxes, or model\ntrains, or just about anything else that is collected (and just about\neverything is collected).  In all cases, you might consider it something\nof an aberration; I mean, what purpose does it serve?  Not much really;\nit's just a hobby.  The collector yearns for diversity (not much use in\nhaving TWO of the same thing, except for trading/selling it), historical\nsignificance (this was the thingy used by so-and-so), technical significance\n(this is the only one that does such-and-such like this; this is the first\none to do it this way), rarity, and so on.\n\nSome people use their collections, other people do not.  As you state, you\nuse your collection.  In one sense, this diminishes the value of your\ncollection as the items suffer wear and exposure.  In another sense, it\ncan enhance your own enjoyment of your collection.  Some people collect\nfirearms that they do not use; other people use some or all of the firearms\nthey collect.  It's just personal preference.\n\nOops, 'personal preference' ... I guess we're not supposed to have that any\nmore, are we?
: \n: > Surely you are not equating David Koresh with Christianity? The two are\n: > not comparable.\n: \n: This is always an option: when the sect is causing harm, re-label\n: the cult to something else.\n: \n: Cheers,\n: Kent\n\nGood point.\n\nI would not doubt that DK could have spouted verse and debated with best.\nAccording to reports his extensive Bible knowledge was one way he sucked\nin the fools (followers?).\n\nQuote bible all you want. I too judge what you say be what you do and\neven more by if it makes sense.\n\nSense, common that is.  Doesn't seem so common after all!
I think you have are addressing the wrong issue. The situation\nis more like: we both see some elves. This is established as\nfact since we can both touch them etc. Then one of us says, the\nelves have always been with us. The other says, no no there was\na time before elves were here. Which is the positive argument?
I would label him rather an original Christian, not a Pauline Christian,\nthough. Sad that the original church lost the game.\n\nCheers,\nKent
WOW! Are you serious! So not everyone who calls themself a Christian is\na Christian? WOW! That does make things a bit more complicated doesn't it?\n\n\nThat seems like very good advice, given the above revelation.\n\n\nLike for example Matthew 5:14-19 right?\n\n\nUm, where did Jesus say that he wanted people to worship him?
You have clearly demonstrated that you do not even know\nwhat my religion is in order to make that assumption.\n\n\nHow I can present any argument when you put your hands over your\neyes and devise new irrevelant excuses each time?  The fact remains,\nyou want to argue about something that you do not know anything about.\nDo you not have to learn a topic first before you can reasonably debate\nthe topic?  \n\nWhich brings us about to the start of this thread.  You began\nperverting Bible verses, interpreting them without investigation.\nFor if you desired to investigate, you would have changed your\ntune immediately.   Thus it is clear to me.  You do not believe\nwhat I am saying because "you don't want to" check it out.\n\n\nThen you must have also ignored every other post I have written\nto you.  This would seem to go along with your character.
nelson_p@apollo.hp.com (Peter Nelson) writes...\n\n\nThe rest of the story seems to be that the agreement for the broadcast\nwas for prime-time, and that Koresh never even heard it played. Wasn't\neven tuned in to the radio when it aired -- so no reason to come out.\n\nIf later they had given him a copy of the grossly twisted newswire \ntranscript -- I'm certain Koresh would think he was at the mercy of\nevil itself. \n\nAs to coming out after Passover, wasn't that just one of the lawyer's\nspeculations Peter?

I'm for the moment interested in this notion of the 'leap of faith'\nestablished by Kierkegaard. It clearly points out a possible solution\nto transcendental values. What I don't understand is that it also\nclearly shows the existentialism system where any leap to any\ntranscendental direction is equal. \n\nIn other words I might not jump off the cliff mentioned above,\nbut at the same time I will decide to what direction I will go.\nActually I will do it just now.\n\nCheers,\nKent
To you, it shouldn't matter if you do evil things or good things.  It is\n   all meaningless in the end anyway.  So go rob a bank.  Go tell someone\n   you dislike that he is a dirty rotten slime bag.  What's restraining you?
...\n\nI had an ehum, interesting experience with the Rosicrucians, or at\nleast Rosicrucians of some sort last Sunday. They had advertised that\nthey were holding a lecture titled The Graal of the King -- the room\nof the heart (which rhymes in Swedish). Out of curiosity, I went to\nthe lecture.\n\nThere were four people there apart from the two Rosicrucians, one\nwoman and two men apart from me. The Rosicrucians were male, both of\nthem. First one of them told us about the Rosicrucians and Lectorium\nRosicrucianum, which was founded in Harlem, NL in 1925. He read\nstraight from a piece of paper, which I at that point was because he\nlacked experience in talking in front of people, but the other guy\nread, too, and he was used to holding speeches, I could tell. The\nfirst guy also said that the R:s are a mystical Christian order, and\nthat they base their teachings on the teachings of the Kathars\n(English?) from the thirteenth century.\n\nThe other guy took over, reading from his piece of paper in a\nfairy-tale teller's voice. What he said sounded like a load of crap to\nme. Of course that might be because I am unenlightened or something.\nWhat made me a bit suspicious, was the way they first said that we all\ncontained something divine, and could find our way back to divinity,\nthen that we couldn't become divine as the persons we are currently,\nbut if we worked really hard we would reach eternal bliss. Maybe I've\nread too much RAW, but it sounded very much like the things he talks\nabout in the chapter _How to robotize people and brainwash your\nfriends_ in _Prometheus rising_. \n\nIt was very interesting to watch the two Rosicrucians. The one holding\nthe actual lecture, obviously was top dog, and the other one seemed to\nbe a true believer. I got the impression that the top dog had more\ndistance to the faith than the true believer, that he used it to gain\npower and admiration. He spoke like a fairy-tale teller, whenever he\nremembered. ;)\n\nThe information brochure is at home. Should you want their address,\nplease e-mail me.\n--Ceci
It seems faith is the only tool available for emotional purposes\ndue to the tragedy. As such it maybe fills a need, however I'm\ngetting tired to see children dying in pain in Sudan due to lack\nof food, and assuming that God takes these sufferers to heaven\nafter a painful death.\n\nCheers,\nKent
Then delete the "unfortunately".   Now tell me that the two statement\nsay effectively the same thing.\n\nAnd to save everyone a couple of trips round this loop, please notice\nthat we are only obliged to use force to preserve self.   We can choose\n*not* to preserve self, which is the point of pacifism.\n\n\nAnd in this case they don't prescribe the same things, so.....\n\n\nIf you don't think the use of force is immoral, why minimise its use?
just a point, i suppose, if open mind means believing anything can be true\nor we can't for sure know what is definitely true, i'm happy to not be open\nminded.  if, however, open mindedness means being respectful and tolerant\ntowards other beliefs, respecting the rights and intelligence and wisdom\nof people of other beliefs and giving equal time to alternative ideas, i\ntry my very best to be open minded.  just a thot in passing.... :)\n\n\n  not being married, i cannot say too much to you, but from my perspective\nhaving mutually exclusive faiths would be a big enough roadblock for me in\nconsidering marrying someone.  making it much bigger than it is?  i suppose\nthat depends on how serious each of you is in your beliefs.  lukewarm atheists\nand christians for whom religion is of nominal importance probly would feel\nthe issue isn't very big.  i suppose the more important your beliefs are to\neach of you, the more important the issue is.
Yeah.  In a fire that reportedly burned hotter than 1000 degrees-- hot\nenough to make the bodies still unidentifiable-- the authorities found\na gun that was recognizably fully-automatic and state of the art.\nIsn't that CONVEEEENIENT?

For false Christs and \n    false prophets will appear and perform great signs and miracles\n    to deceive even the elect - if that were possible.  See, I have\n    told you ahead of time."\n\nDo we listen?  Sadly, not all of us do.\n\nPeace be with you, and condolences to the families of those lost at\nWaco.\n\nMalcolm Lee
And maybe they do.  But without somebody to set the time that doesn't\ndo them any good.\n\n\nHumph.  Deleted there was my list of non-religious reasons one might\nwant a moment of silence for a dead classmate.\n\nMaybe everyone doesn't want to be silent for teachers to give their\npompous non-religious speeches in assembly.  I know I didn't.  So?\n\n\n\nPlease provide documentation that opposing only things that are\nactively religious (e.g. actual prayer, "Amen" after a moment of\nsilence, mandatory classes in religion) and not things that have\npossible but uncertain religious implications (e.g. moments of\nsilence, having the Bible on the shelves during reading period) is not\na way to prevent a state religion.

isaackuo@skippy.berkeley.edu (Isaac Kuo) states in reply to deleted\narticle about no-knock searches, arrests\n\n\n\nIn general no-knock raids are to preserve evidence, like drugs,\nwhich can be flushed down the toilet.  They are not the standard way\nto arrest a violent felon like a bank robber.  If there is no need to\nsearch or preserve evidence they will just surround the dwelling and\norder the suspect to come out with her hands up.  If the suspect does\nnot come out tear gas will be used.\n\n\ncomment on the BD omitted\n\n\n\nIt is not a method to apprehend criminals.\n\n\nIt is a very dangerous method to obtain evidence that might be\ndestroyed if a warrant is served in the normal way.  It is the most\ndangerous way to arrest anyone.  The cops are charging into a room\nand they don't know what is in it.  It is much safer to surround the\nplace and announce yourself.\n\n\n\nCops are not cops _until_ they identify themselves as police officers.\n\n\nMost drug dealers and professional criminals are aware of the\nlikelihood of arrest but they also know how the system works.  If they\nare arrested they call their lawyer, post bail and hope for a plea\nbargain.  If they pull a gun and shoot a cop during a raid they will\nbe charged with first degree murder if they survive the raid.  Drug\ndealers have guns for protection from their customers and other\ncriminals, not to shoot cops.  Cops are shot on no-knock drug raids\nbecause the criminals aren't aware that they are cops.\n\nNo-knock raids on homes occupied by non-criminals are more likely to\nend in disaster.  Mom and Pop citizen _KNOW_ that they have not\ncommitted any crime, they KNOW that anyone breaking into their house\ncannot be a cop because they have done nothing wrong.  If they have\nthe means to defend themselves they may because they KNOW that the\nhousebreakers are criminals not cops.  Cops and homeowners may die.\n\nThe first reports from Waco stated that the ATF had a warrant to\nsearch for illegal weapons and also an arrest warrant if the illegal\nweapons were found.  In this case the no-knock warrant was not called\nfor.  It is difficult to flush a gun down the toilet.  The ATF could\nhave surrounded the compound.  A marked police car could have driven\nup to the entrance and uniformed officers could have knocked and\nserved the warrant usual way.  It this had happened and and Koresh\nrefused the warrant or drove the cops off at gun point then most of\nthe t.p.g folks would have kept quiet.
That's not "showing the signs of his innate sin", that's testing the\nlimits of his newfound independence.

Wrong about what?   I think they are correct in thinking that a \nwell-placed bomb or six would get headlines, but I think they are \nwrong if they think that you can set off bombs and still be a \nBuddhist.\n\nMaybe what we are seeing here is that Chinese cultural genocide\nagainst the Tibetans has worked well enough that some Tibetans \nare now no longer Buddhist and are instead willing to behave like\nthe Chinese occupiers.   Every action is its own reward.\n\n\nOn the other hand, people who are aware of the occupation are mostly\nfull of admiration for the peaceful way that Tibetans have put up\nwith it.   And what does it cost us to admire them?   Zip.\n\n\nYes they are, and whether this serves them well or not depends on \nwhether they want Buddhist principles or political independence.\nAnd without political independence can they preserve their cultural\nand religious traditions?\n\n\nThe Chinese would certainly refer to them as terrorists, just as\nthe Hitler regime used to refer to European resistance movements\nas terrorists.\n\n\nBetter off in what way?   As proponents of pacifism or as \nproponents of political autonomy?\n\nAnd better off in what time-scale?   The Soviet Empire practised\ncultural genocide against something like a hundred small minorities,\nsome of which resisted violently, and some of which did not, but\nin the end it was the Soviet Empire that collapsed and at least\nsome of the minorities survived.\n\nNow some of the minorities are fighting one another.    Is that\nbecause they have to, or because violent resistance to an oppressive\nEmpire legitimized violence?

I am pleased to announce that a *revised version* of _The Easy-to-Read Book\nof Mormon_ (former title: _Mormon's Book_) by Lynn Matthews Anderson is now\navailable through anonymous ftp (see information below). In addition to the\nchange in title, the revised ETR BOM has been shortened by several pages\n(eliminating many extraneous "that's" and "of's"), and many (minor) errors\nhave been corrected. This release includes a simplified Joseph Smith Story,\ntestimonies of the three and eight witnesses, and a "Words-to-Know"\nglossary.\n\nAs with the previous announcement, readers are reminded that this is a\nnot-for-profit endeavor. This is a copyrighted work, but people are welcome\nto make *verbatim* copies for personal use. People can recuperate the\nactual costs of printing (paper, copy center charges), but may not charge\nanything for their time in making copies, or in any way realize a profit\nfrom the use of this book. See the permissions notice in the book itself\nfor the precise terms.\n\nNegotiations are currently underway with a Mormon publisher vis-a-vis the\nprinting and distribution of bound books. (Sorry, I'm out of the wire-bound\n"first editions.") I will make another announcement about the availability\nof printed copies once everything has been worked out.\n\nFTP information: connect via anonymous ftp to carnot.itc.cmu.edu, then "cd\npub" (you won't see anything at all until you do).\n\n"The Easy-to-Read Book of Mormon" is currently available in postscript and\nRTF (rich text format). (ASCII, LaTeX, and other versions can be made\navailable; contact dba@andrew.cmu.edu for details.) You should be able to\nprint the postscript file on any postscript printer (such as an Apple\nLaserwriter); let dba know if you have any difficulties.

(st) Stephen Tice \n(km) Ken McVay\n\n\n(st)Seems to me Koresh is yet another messenger that got killed\n(st)for the message he carried. (Which says nothing about the \n\n(km)Seems to be, barring evidence to the contrary, that Koresh was simply\n(km)another deranged fanatic who thought it neccessary to take a whole bunch of\n(km)folks with him, children and all, to satisfy his delusional mania. Jim\n(km)Jones, circa 1993.\n\nI think there's plenty of evidence to the contrary - six "rescued"\nDavidians consistantly recounted that the Federal tank knocked over a barrel\nof propane. These guys haven't exactly been spending time together,\nplotting an elaborate and consistent story. It would be contradictory\nfor Koresh to go for "mass suicide" - remember that Koresh's death was\nthe opening of the sixth seal - the signal that Armageddon had begun.\nHis army (the people in the compound) would then fight the powers of\nevil and win, ending in the Rapture. The fire wiped out his army. I\nread earlier that Koresh was planning to walk out of the compound \nand blow himself up with a grenade - that would jibe better with\nhis teachings.\n\n(st)In the mean time, we sure learned a lot about evil and corruption.\n(st)Are you surprised things have gotten that rotten?\n\n(km)Nope - fruitcakes like Koresh have been demonstrating such evil corruption\n(km)for centuries.\n\nI'd think you'd be the last one to support gassing people and \nburning them to death for their religious beliefs. Corrupt? Evil?\nI don't know. We'll never know. And when you start calling people \nfruitcakes about their religious beliefs, that's dehumanizing people.\nWe saw what happened when many Germans started believing that Jews\nwere subhuman.\n\nIn one neat stroke, they destroyed all the evidence that could have \npointed to wrongdoing. And killed all the witnesses, including 12\nchildren whose last view of life was choking and pain, followed by\nburning them alive.\n\nI am extremely saddened that this tragedy occurred. I'm furious that\nthey used my money to do it.
Ah, so you admit newborns are innocent?  Then you cannot say _everyone_ is a\nsinner.\n\nAbout the only way top get out of this one is to claim that a newborn is a\nsinner despite having not committed any sins, which is rather odd.\n--\n"On the first day after Christmas my truelove served to me...

No, Dave, and as an anthropologist I take great umbrage with this \nmisrepresentation.  I sense that it is you that has made the jump from creation\n(science) to religion (see above).  I have characterized science/*creation \nscience* as rationalism/nonsense, and that it is.  When people promote their \nreligious beliefs as science they become nonsense.  Kept where they belong \nthey are meaningful and useful, as virtually any anthropologists will tell you,\nand as I have said several times in this group.  And it works the other way, \ntoo, and I have repeatedly said so.  Never have I said or meant anything \ndifferent, here or elsewhere, and I don't think my communication skills betray\nme.  Nor do I presume to offend people's spiritual sensibilities, as\nI would hope others would not disparage mine.
Just taking a guess, perhaps it was that Koresh had peaceably been served\nwith warrants before, and he did not shoot anyone but instead went with the\npolice without fighting.\n--\n"On the first day after Christmas my truelove served to me...

Sorry if this is late for the thread, but...\n\nI thought God was supposed to be constant and never-changing.  How do\nyou reconcile this common Christian view with the paragraph above?\n\nAlso, while we're at it:\n\n1. How do you reconcile "A KIND and LOVING God!!" with the\nJudeo-Christian view that sin was at one time "immediately punishable\nby death"?  Was killing people for sinning God's way of showing\nKINDness and LOVE?\n\n2. Is the fact the He no longer does this an admission on His part of\nhaving made a mistake?\n\n3. Now that we are "living in the age of grace", does this mean that\nfor our sins, God now damns us to eternal hell after we die, rather\nthan killing us immediately?  If so, is this eternal damnation an\nexample of "A KIND and LOVING God!!"?\n\nJust curious.
Why should anyone (check: let's restrict this to Christians, why do *we*)\nwant to find "commandments" in the books regarded as scripture?  What's\ngoing on? I will pass on psychologizing answers (whether dismissive or more\nopen) as not the kind of issue to deal with here -- the question is what is\nthe *theological* point involved?  And it has been quoted "at" me often\nenough by those who don't believe I take it seriously, that Jesus (is said\nto have) said, "If you love me, you will obey my commands."  [John 14:15]\n\nI am, like any Christian, the slave of Christ, and it is my will that I\nshould do as He wills me to do.  I am (also, or instead) His younger brother,\nbut still under His direction, though we both call God "Abba."  Christians,\ntherefore, will try to find what it is that their Lord commands them, and\ndiscovering it will feel obligated to do it, or to confess their failure.\nReaders here may set aside the theologizing jargon (such as "slaves of\nChrist") -- the point is that adherents of a religion *will* read the texts\n(whether classified as "inspired" or not) that are held up as models, in an\neffort to find application to their own situations.  This practice ranges\nfrom "devotional" reading of sermons and the like to the exegesis of canon-\nical scripture as "the Word of God."  And at the highest pitch, this leads\nto a question of whether we *can* find in inspired scripture something that\ncan act as "absolute" guidance for our actions.\n\nThe problem is in finding out just *what* it is our Lord commands.  I am\ngoing to set aside for this essay one major direction in which Christians\nhave looked for these commands, namely Christian tradition.  That is not\nbecause *I* reject tradition, but because my primary audience in this essay\nis Protestants, who deny tradition a determinative value, in favor of the\nwitness of Scripture.  The question I want to deal with is, WHAT commandments\ncan we find from our Lord in Scripture?  And that turns out to be a hard\nquestion.  [ If any of my Protestant Inquisitors would *like* to turn the\ndiscussion to the authority of tradition, I can accomodate them :-), unlike\n*most* Protestants, Episcopalians admit claims from a) Scripture b) Reason\nand c) Tradition on roughly equal standing. ]\n\nEarlier in John than my quote above, we read [John 13:34] "I give you a new \ncommandment: love one another."  This is the ONLY place in the NT where\nChristians are given an explicit commandment, with the context commenting\non its imperative mode pronouncement by Jesus.  At the same meal [so we\n*readers* infer, since it is *not* in John, but in the Synoptics] Jesus\nsays, "Take this [bread]; this is my body."  [Mark 14:22, cf. Matthew 26:26,\nLuke 22:19, 1 Corinthians 11:24]  The mode is imperative (Greek _labete_),\nand hence this, too, is a "commandment."\n\nIn *both* cases we have to *infer* that the command is directed to a wider\ncircle than the immediate collocation of disciples -- because we judge the\nevangelist's point in mentioning it (with the disciples by then mostly or\nentirely dead) is that *we* are expected to follow this as a commandment\nfrom our Lord.  In the case of communion, Paul's mention (at least; this\nis probably true of the evangelists also) implies an ongoing ritual liturgy\nin which these words operate to "bind" Christians to the original command\nto his disciples, as a continuing commandment to the Christian community.\n\nI am entirely comfortable with this inference, but I *must* point out that\nit is THERE, between us and the occasion on which Jesus spoke the command.\nI take it as a clear inference, at the very least the EVANGELIST'S notion,\nthat *all* Christians are called to love one another, in Jesus' command\ndirected at the disciples.  But I have to call attention to the inference.\nThe command CANNOT apply to me without the generalization from the specific\ncontext of its statement to my own context as a "disciple" of Christ.\n\nAll reading of scripture has to make such inferences, to get any sense out\nof the text whatsoever.  This is a general problem in reading these texts\n-- we cannot read them at all without our *own* understanding of our native\nlanguages in which we (normally) read the (translated) texts, and without\n*some* appreciation of the original context (and at points, the original\nlanguages, when English misleads us.) I am going to presume, in what follows,\nthat we have the *general* problem of how to read scripture under control\n[ I don't *really* think this is true, but it will suffice for my current\npurposes. ]  I will address ONLY the issues that arise when we have already\ncoped with the understanding of a 2000 year old text from another world\nthan the one we live in.  Questions at THAT level only introduce MORE reser-\nvations about the commandments issue than will be found stipulating that we\ncan read the texts as the original audience might have done.\n\nAmong the reasons we have for seeing John's _agapate allelou_ as a *general*\ncommandment (not merely an instruction by Jesus to this disciples on that\none occasion), and one linking it to the Synoptic "Great Commandment" is\nthat we have criticism, from Jesus, about limiting our love to those whom\nwe congenially associate with.  In Matthew 5:43ff we read, "You have learnt\nsay to you: love your enemies."  In fact, the Leviticus context quoted\ndoes NOT say 'hate your enemy' -- it is merely the common human presumption.\n(And Leviticus is at pains to say that the "love" should extend to strangers\namongst the people of Israel.)  Luke, in expanding on this same Q context,\ngoes on to have Jesus say. "Even sinners love those who love them." [6:27]\nAll of this suggests [quite strongly, I'd say :-)] that *limiting* the\nscope of the "new commandment" is not quite what Jesus has in mind.  In\nshort, inference *leads me* to generalizing the actual text to a command\nthat is "in force" on Christians, and with objects not limited to other\nChristians.\n\nTrickier than the _agapate allelou_ or Institution of communion, there is\nthe case of the "Great Commission" where (Matthew 10, Mark 6) the Twelve\nare sent out to evangelize, "Proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close\nat hand."  The verb is imperative (_ke:russete_), but the context is rather\nspecific to the Twelve, and there are further specifiers (as in "Do not\nturn your steps to pagan territory, and do not enter any Samaritan town"\n-- the Lukan parallels are even more specific to Jesus' final journey to\nJerusalem) which make it harder to see this generalizing to all Christians\nthan the previous examples.  That hasn't prevented Christians from MAKING\nsuch an inference; what I have to call attention to is that such inference\nis NOT justified in the text, nor (unlike the first two cases I cite) by\nthe rhetoric of the evangelist urged on the reader.  Still, Paul seems to\nhave felt obliged to "proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand"\neven (contrary to Jesus' instructions to the 12 :-)) to the gentiles, to\nthe ends of the earth.  So, Christians after him have also taken this as\na "commandment" in the sense of John 14:15.  Do I "accept" this?  I don't\nknow.  It is surely rather speculative.  But you see how the ripples of\ninference spread out from the text that is the pretext -- Christians (may)\ninfer a general commandment, applicable to all, from what is presented in\nthe gospels as a specific occasion.  I do not (necessarily) object to this\nkind of generalization -- but I *insist* that people who make it *must*\nhave an understanding that they are *reasoning* (at some considerable\nlength) from what we actually *have* in scripture.  There are *assumptions*\ninvolved in this reasoning, and *these* are *not* themselves scriptural\n(though people will do their best to "justify" their assumptions by OTHER\nreferences to scripture -- which simply adds MORE inference into the mix!)\n\nLet's move on to the "Great Commandment" -- that we should love God with\nour whole hearts and minds and souls.  This is, perhaps, the Synoptic\n"equivalent" of John's _agapate allelou_.  And yet,  it is not PRESENTED\nas a commandment, in our texts.  Rather, the context is controversy with\nthe Pharisees.  To cite Matthew [22:34ff]\n\n	"But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees\n	they got together and, to disconcert him, one of them put a question,\n	"Master, which is the greatest commandment of the Law?"\n\nIt is by no means obvious here (though I accept it as such) that Jesus'\nanswer is meant to be a commandment *to Christians*.  He is answering a\npolemic from his enemies.  [ Mark's account, in  12:28-34 casts the answer\nin a far more positive light as (so the "scribe" in this version says)\n"far more important than any holocaust (I need to point out that this word\noriginates in the context of animal sacrifice; forget the Nazis for this)\nor sacrifice."  Luke is intermediate -- he has a lawyer posing the question\n"to disconcert" Jesus, and gets the Good Samarian parable for his pains\n[ Luke 10:25-37 ].  The contexts here are so confusingly various that one\ncould be forgiven for drawing *no* inferences :-)  In *no* account is this\nsaid as if it were obviously to be taken as a commandment binding on\nChristians -- though I think it an entirely reasonable conclusion in each\ncase that Jesus thinks it to be so.  The point is that our mental gears\nHAVE to grind a cycle or so to get to any conclusion from all of this about\nwhat WE are commanded to do, by Jesus.  And all of this is contingent on\nour understanding the point of Jesus' use of the Torah in the (all quite\ndifferent) gospel accounts, and the application of such a context to *us*.\n\nThe different contexts among the Synoptics are curious.  It should be noted\nthat ONLY in Luke do we get the "fixing" of this command by the parable of\nthe Good Samaritan.  We may look for an analogous *intent* in Matthew, where\n7:12 gives the "Golden Rule" as "the meaning of the Law and the Prophets"\n(and where we may also hear an echo of Hillel saying the same, a generation\nbefore Jesus.)  If we make these associations (which I think are entirely\nreasonable), we are -- again -- indulging in inference.  The texts do not\n*explicitly* support us; rather, we *read* the texts as having this kind of\ninter-relationship.  Current literary theory calls this "intertextuality."\n\nMy discussion of why the _agapate allelou_ "has" to apply beyond the \ncommunity of the disciples, and beyound the circle of Christian believers,\napplies again here, to buttress a conclusion that this *is* (despite the\npresentation not saying so explicitly) a "commandment" to Christians.\nFew Christians would disagree with my conclusions -- but I *must* point\nout that they *are* conclusions, they *depend* on rather elaborate chains\nof reasoning that are simply NOT present in the texts, themselves.\n\nThe contextual problem keeps coming up, more and more severely as we look at\nthose sayings of Jesus that are NOT so universally taken by Christians as \ncommandments.  And we get some really hard cases.  Take divorce.  Mark is \npretty clear, "The man who divorces his wife and marries another is guilty\nof adultery against her."  [ 10:11, cf. Luke 16:18 ] -- except that Matthew\nhas an escape clause [ "except in the case of fornication", 5:31 ]. This\nseems to be a rather clear "commandment" (whether or not we take Matthew's\nreservation); and some Christians, to this day, take it so.  But some don't,\nat least in practice.  This is rather peculiar; it is not as if Jesus were\nnot explicit about this (whereas He says nothing at all about some of the\nthings people gnash their teeth over.)  How is it possible, if the commands\nof Christ are clear, that Matthew can so disagree with the other evangelists\nof the synoptic tradition?\n\nI'm going to continue this examination, into ever-murkier waters, but this\nis enough to start with.  The theme is: "finding commandments in scripture\nis an exercise in inference; our inferences are informed by OUR assumptions,\nthat is, our own cultural biases."  I have, so far, identified a very few\n"commandments" that are generally accepted by all Christians -- and yet in\nthese, already, some of the difficulties start to surface.  It is these\ndifficulties I want to discuss in my next essay on this topic.  The divorce\ncommandment already strikes at some of the difficulties: I see almost no\nevidence that the people who are so eager to find commandments to condemn\n*me* with, spend any time at all writing nasty screeds to soc.couples or\nmisc.legal about the horrors or viciousness of divorce, or demanding that\nUS law refuse to allow it, or refuse "unrepentant divorcees" places in\ntheir churches.  [ That is not to say that divorce *doesn't* enter into \nconsideration in general -- it is most definitely a matter of concern, in\neven the most "liberal" church circles.  For example, a (wildly) liberal\nEpiscopalian priest of my aqauintence, in a (wildly) liberal diocese, has\nrecommended to a couple who approached him to marry them that they have a\n"private" secular ceremony before a judge, so that the "public" ceremony\nhe celebrated need not go through an agonizing "examination" by officials\nwho would just as soon NOT take on this role of interpreting the commands\nwe are faced with as Christians.  This, in a church that was effectively\nCREATED by a famous divorce! ]

Each time the Peace Torch changes hands, the\nflame of oneness burns a little brighter - until one day it will\nshine in the hearts and minds of every individual on earth.\n\n\n		    ----  Making History  ----\n\nThe three Peace Runs since 1987 have achieved some historic break-\nthroughs: in the Middle East, a landmark run crossed the Egyptian-\nIsraeli border; in Europe, a precedent-setting run linked Eastern\nand Western Europe with Russia; in the United States, Mexico and\nCanada, entire cities were dedicated to the cause of world peace;\nand in Poland, the Peace Torch was blessed by Pope John Paul II.\n\n\n		 ----  Speaking as One: World  ----\n             ----  Leaders, Celebrities - and You  ----\n\nThe Peace Run has won the support of leaders the world over -\nPresidents, Prime Ministers, religious leaders, sports figures and\nentertainment personalities.\n\nIts message has spread to a half billion people though newspaper\nreports, magazine articles and radio and TV broadcasts, including\nspecials on PBS, MTV and NBC's Today Show.\n\nreconciliation.

There, runners from around the world\nwere gathered for the fourth lighting of the Peace Torch.\n\nFrom there, Peace Torches are now being transported to over\nseventy countries for a series of concurrent international or\ncross-country relay runs including the United States, Canada,\nJapan, Australia, Russia and Eastern and Western Europe.

Each year the Team\nputs on hundreds of athletic events, including several world-class\nultramarathons, marathons and triathlons, in dozens of countries.\n\nThe Peace Run itself is inspired by the global peace ambassador\nSri Chinmoy, who has written and lectured extensively on peace,\noffered hundreds of free peace concerts and met with countless\nworld figures to advance the cause of international harmony.\n\nThe Run is managed by Peace Runs International, a non-profit\norganization based in the United States.\n\n\n               ----  Take a Step For Peace  ----\n\nThe Peace Runs in 1987, 1989 and 1991 attracted nearly half a\nmillion participants. We're expecting even more people to join\nPeace Run '93.\n\nYou can also join the Run - carrying the Peace Torch a few steps,\na few blocks or a few miles. Or you can come out and cheer the\nrunners as they carry the Torch through your community.\n\nYou can also join local celebrities and government officials in\none of the thousands of welcoming ceremonies scheduled along the\n70-nation route.\n\nYour inner support is important too. If you're a runner, each time\nyou go out, you can dedicate your run to the cause of world peace.\n\n\n		 ----  The Next Step is Yours  ----\n		 ----  Make It One For Peace  ----\n\n\nFor information contact:\nPeace Runs International\n161-44 Normal Road\nJamaica, NY 11432 USA\ntel. 718/291-6637  Fax: 718/291-6978\n\nPeace Run Canada\n2456 Agricola Street\nHalifax, Nova Scotia  B3K 4C2\ntel. 902/425-1174  Fax: 902/420-0773

The problem is that you imagine him inside this huge wall, unable\nto see reality. While he imagines the same about you. Clearly we\nhave a case where relativity plays a big role concerning looking\nat opposite frames of reality.\n\nCheers,\nKent
Oh, yes he did.  You may not agree with his premises, and what he proved may\nnot apply to "reality" (if such a thing exists), but he certainly proved\nsomething.\n\n\nGot it in one.  Similarly, a moral relativist will not judge one moral system\nto be better than another in every possible circumstance.  This does not,\nhowever, preclude him from judging one moral system to be better than another\nin a specific set of circumstances.  Nor does it preclude a set of moral\nrelativists from collectively judging a moral system, from some set of\ncircumstances which they all agree they are in.\n\n\nEh?  Could you explain this?  Which "that statement" are you talking about?\n\n\nI still don't quite see what you're trying to say.  I assume by "values" you\nmean moral values, yes?  In which case, what do you mean by "real"?  What is\na "real" moral value, as opposed to an unreal one?\n\n\nSorry, but in what way is it an infinite regress?  It looks extremely finite\nto me.\n\n\nSorry, but that's not so.  I can provide a justification for asserting that\nthe moral system of the terrorist is inferior to that of the man of peace.  I\njust can't provide a justification which works in all possible circumstances.\n\nSimilarly, I can provide a justification for asserting that bullets move\nfaster than snails.  That justification won't hold in all possible frames of\nreference, but it will hold in almost all the frames of reference I am ever\nlikely to be in.\n\n\nI don't think I agree with this.  My saying it *does* make it so *from my\npoint of view* and according to *my premises*, unless the argument is invalid.\nIt may indeed not make it so from your point of view, but I never claimed\nthat it did.  In fact, I don't even claim that you exist enough to have a\npoint of view.
-*----\n\nFar from being "tossed out," the gospels are taken, almost\nuniversally, as the primary source of information about Jesus.\nI am curious as to whom Mike Cobb is referring.  Who "tosses out"\nthe New Testament?  Undoubtedly a few *naive* atheists do this,\nbut the phrasing of the question above seems to suggest that Cobb\nascribes this more broadly.\n\nPerhaps the question that gets more to the heart of the matter is\nwhy, except for some *naive* believers (who, unfortunately, far\noutnumber nonbelievers, both naive and critical), are the gospels\n*not* taken as "gospel truth" that faithfully records just what\nhappened two thousand years ago?  This has an easy answer, and\nthe answer has *nothing* to do with miracles: no text is taken\nthis way by a critical reader.\n\nThere is a myth among some naive believers that one takes a text,\nmeasures it by some set of criteria, and then either confirms the\ntext as "historically valid" or "tosses out" the text.  I suspect\nthis myth comes from the way history is presented in primary and\nsecondary school, where certain texts are vested with authority,\nand from writers such as Josh McDowell who pretend to present\nhistorical arguments along these lines for their religious\nprogram.  In fact, most texts used in primary and secondary\nschool history classes ought to be tossed out, even the better\nsuch texts should not be treated as authoritatively as descibed\nabove, and Josh McDowell would not know a historical argument if\nit bit him on the keister twice.\n\nLet me present the barest outlines of a different view of texts\nand their use in studying history.  First, all texts are\nhistorically valid.  ALL texts.  Or to put this another way, I\nhave never seen a notion of "historical validity" that makes any\nsense when applied to a text.  Second, no text should be read as\ntelling the "gospel truth" about historical events, in the way\nthat many students are wont to read history texts in primary and\nsecondary school.  NO text.  (This includes your favorite\nauthor's history of whatever.)\n\nEvery text is a historical fact.  Every text was written by some\nperson (or some group of people) for some purpose.  Hence, every\ntext can serve as historical evidence.  The question is: what can\nwe learn from a text?  Of what interesting things (if any) does\nthe text provide evidence?\n\nThe diaries of the followers of the Maharishi, formerly of\nOregon, are historical evidence.  The gospels are historical\nevidence.  The letters of the officers who participated in the \nvampire inquests in Eastern Europe are historical evidence.  The\nmodern American history textbooks that whitewash "great American\nfigures" are historical evidence.  These are all historical\nevidence of various things.  They are *not* much evidence at all\nthat the Maharishi, formerly of Oregon, could levitate; that\nJesus was resurrected; that vampires exist; or that "great\nAmerican figures" are as squeaky clean as we learned in school.\nThey are better evidence that some people "saw" the Maharishi,\nlate of Oregon, levitate; that some of the early Christians\nthought Jesus was resurrected; that many people in Eastern Europe\n"saw" vampires return from the grave; and that we still have an\neducational system that largely prefers to spread myth rather\nthan teach history.\n\nHow does one draw causal connections and infer what a piece of\nhistorical evidence -- text or otherwise -- evinces?  This is a\nvery complex question that has no easily summarized answer.\nThere are many books on the subject or various parts of the\nsubject.  I enjoy David Hackett Fischer's "Historian's Fallacies"\nas a good antidote to the uncritical way in which it is so easy\nto read texts present history.  It's relatively cheap.  It's easy\nto read.  Give it a try.
I'm curious.  Are you referring to Koresh as "the Man"?  Why the \nupper case M?                           \n                                                         \n                                                          \nI never claimed to be a spokesman for "most people".  It is an assumption\non my part that people with normal values and morality would be more \nconcerned with human life than sermon structure.  \n                                      \n                     \nAre burning children part of this very special event?      \n                                          \n\n                                                \nWhat about those who do not know the Master's voice?  Does the Master\nnot care about them?  Eloquent, but corrupt, preaching may be of little\ndifference to you.  But I suspect it made a big difference to all of\nthose who died in the compound.
Good point.  If you haven't read "The True Believer" by Eric Hoffer, do\nso at your first opportunity.  I don't know why Hoffer is out of style\nnow, but "The True Believer" is still the best explanation of nutball\nbehavior ever written.

Sorry, but yes he does, by your own description.\n\n\nHumorous, this notion of an all-knowing, all-powerful god who must\n"attempt" to "reconcile" with his lowly creations.  I realize that it\nis not possible to penetrate such logic, but is there any chance that\nyou might consider that an omnipotent god need not "attempt" anything,\nand further that an attempt to "reconcile" implies a lack of\nomniscience?\n\nWhat you are doing here is projecting human weaknesses onto your god.\n\n\n\nBut all humans are sinners, thus all pre-Jesus humans should have been\npunished with death.  We aren't punished with sin now, of course,\nbecause God has changed.  He required a brutal, sadistic sacrifice of\nhis own blood in order to allow us to sin without immediate death.  \n\n\nYet he does so now.  He has changed.  The sadistic murder of his own\nson has made him more tolerant of our sins.\n\nBesides, his "midst" is everywhere, so your statement is meaningless.\nHe tolerates sin in Hell, which surely is in his midst as well.  Also,\ngiven that he is all-knowing, he must have eternal knowledge of who\nwill commit which sins, as well as when and where, so what does\ntolerance have to do with anything.  All of this is absolute nonsense,\nunless your god is not indeed all-knowing and all-powerful, or unless\nhe doesn't take the personal interest in everyday affairs that you\nclaim.\n\n\nNot relevant.  The claim of kindness and lovingness was made by you in\nreference to your god.  The nature of his creations/victims is not at\nissue.\n\n\nI see: an all-knowing god who did not know what the ultimate outcome\nwould be, and an all-powerful god who had no choice in the matter.\nMindmush.\n\n\nDid I miss something?  Did you give some indication at to why a KIND\nand LOVING god should require sadistic human sacrifice to allow his\nown botched creations to "achieve salvation"?\n\n\n \nI note that your answer physically follows my question, but I fail to\ndiscern a connection between the two.\n\nBy the way, for what am I being consoled?\n\n\n\nWhy not?  By the way, I note for the record that you didn't answer the\nquestions. \n\n\nDeath and/or eternal damnation is your idea of correctional\npunishment?  I hope you aren't a parent.\n\n\nThis is quite an elaborate fantasy that you've constructed, but sadly\nit lacks a basis in reality.  It also does not address the questions\nthat I raised.\n\n\nThe god that you describe is not a good parent, but a tyrant.\n\n\nSorry, was that the god of the Bible whose rules I am to follow, or\nthe god of the Koran?  The Vedas?  The Book of Koresh?  Oh, yes, it's\nall so clear.
I agree with your points, and I'm glad to hear that you subscribe\nto the notion of secular humanism, humans helping humans instead\nof hoping for a possible deux ex machina solution!\n\nAs for faith, you could always use such constructs to dampen\nyour anger or sorrow.\n\nCheers,\nKent
If you were able to prove that morality is objective, then it would\nbe correct to do so. The problem is, by the very meaning of the\nwords in question, to do so is oxymoronic. Of course you could\nredefine the words, but that would still not lend support to the\nunderlying concept.\n\n\nThis does not parse. How could you hardly be wrong without dragging\nin the o-word?\n\n\nI have no problem with objectivity at all. It is my objectivity that\nhas led me to conclude that morality is subjective.

...\n    ...\n\n    Interesting idea.\n\n    This suggestion has inspired me to post, under the title "Theories \nof Creation", a collection of various "philosophies" of creation that \nI am aware of.  Could you explain which of these theories you would\nwant taught, and which ones you would not?  Or, perhaps, I haven't\nincluded a favorite theory of yours (if so, could you describe it for\nme for inclusion in an updated list)?
The thing is, I know what arms and legs are.  It's therefore generally easy to\ntell whether or not someone has arms and legs.  This "sinful nature", since it\ndoes not require that the baby actually perform any sins, seems to be totally\ninvisible.  As far as I know, maybe half the babies have a sinful nature and\nhalf don't--it'd look exactly the same, since there is no way to tell the\ndifference.\n\n\nSo what's so bad about a sinful nature, then?  I could understand it being\nbad if it always results in people committing sins, but babies can have it,\nnever commit sins, die, and they still have it.  So the bad part about can't\nmerely be that it results in people committing sins--so what _is_ bad about it?\n--\n"On the first day after Christmas my truelove served to me...

Convenient?  It seems very appropriate that this is cross-posted to\nalt.conspiracy.\n\nAssuming the most favorable interpretation of your '1000 degree'\nmeasurement (that the temperature is in Centigrade, rather than the\nmore common -in the US- Fahrenheit), you are still laboring under at\nleast 2 misconceptions:\n\n1.  You seem to believe that steel melts somewhere around 1000 C.\n    Actually, the melting point of most iron alloys (and steels are\n    iron alloys) is in the neighborhood of 1400 C.  Even if the gun\n    were found in area which achieved the 1000 C temperature, the steel\n    parts of the gun would not be deformed, and it would still be\n    trivial to identify the nature of the weapon.\n\n2.  A fire is not an isothermal process.  There are 'hot' spots and\n    'cold' spots, though 'cold' is purely a relative term.   So the\n    weapon was not necessarily situated in a hot spot, as you seem to\n    imply.  And, even if it was, so what?  It would not have melted\n    anyway.
If, if, if....  Anyway, the question was if the gun was identifiable, which\nit is.\n\n-Tim

Jesus did not say that he was the fulfillment of the Law, and, unless\nI'm mistaken, heaven and earth have not yet passed away. Am I mistaken?\nAnd, even assuming that one can just gloss over that portion of the word\nof Jesus, do you really think that "all is accomplished?"\n\n\nThen why didn't Jesus say "Any Jew who annuls ..." in v. 19? Are you\nsaying that all of Jesus' recorded words mean nothing to Gentiles? Are\nyou really saying that Jesus only spoke for and to the Jews? Jesus\ndidn't mention your name, does that mean he wasn't speaking to you? When\nyou read the words of Jesus, do you think he is speaking to someone\nother than you?\n\n\nYou said above that Jesus was the "fulfillment" of the Law. Are you\nsaying that does not mean "doing away with the Law"?\n\n\nGen3:15(JPS) I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between\nyour offspring and hers; they shall strike at your head, and you shall\nstrike at their heel.\n\nGen3:15(NRSV) I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your\noffspring and hers; he will strike your head, and you will strike his\nheel."\n\nGen3:15(KJV) And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and\nbetween thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt\nbruise his heel.\n\nLooks like your translation has taken a few liberties with the Word?\n\n\nOnly "helping the Jewish people?"\n\n\nYou are using your interpretation of Paul as an argument against the\nclear words of Jesus?\n\n\n"Re-expressed?" Care to define that a bit better?\n\n\nWhat? Are heaven and earth gone away? Where did they go? Is all\naccomplished, for example Revelations? Explain please.\n\n\nAgain, your interpretation of Paul versus the clear word of Jesus. Do\nyou see any problems here? When did heaven and earth go away? When was\nall accomplished?
No.  Zeno's paradox is resolved by showing that integration or an infinite\nseries of decreasing terms can sum to a finite result.\n\n\nWell, suppose a probe emitting radiation at a constant frequency was\nsent towards a black hole.  As it got closer to the event horizon, the\nred shift would keep increasing.  The period would get longer and longer,\nbut it would never stop.  An observer would not observe the probe actually\nreaching the event horizon.  The detected energy from the probe would keep\ndecreasing, but it wouldn't vanish.  Exp(-t) never quite reaches zero.\n\nI guess the above probably doesn't make things any more clear, but hopefully\nyou will get the general idea maybe.
Looking at your discussion I would say that you both operate\nfrom your own reference frame. There's no inside and no outside,\nthere are just two polarized views. As for statements inside the\nBible, things are still not that clear, we don't have any indications\nfor instance why Jobs was placed in the Old Testament, one of the \nfew books that actually talks about Satan. Jobs is very much out\nof line with the rest of the OT books, and there's a chance that\nsomeone added this book later into the group of OT scriptures.\n\n\nThis operates the other way around as well. You have to understand\nthe mind of an atheist, agnostic, or as in my case, a radical\nrelativist. If you don't understand the underlying concepts, it is \npretty hard to continue with a dialogue. I'm not a perfect Christian,\nhowever about 20+ years of Christian teaching should have provided\nme with a pretty good picture of the Christian mind frame.\n\nCheers,\nKent
Um, I think you and the Bible are the ones inside the wall.  There's a\nreally wonderful world out here.  You really should peek out at it sometime.\n\nThe silly things you keep saying only reinforce the fact that we *are*\non opposite sides of a very high wall.  I see how incredibly beautiful\nthings are on my side, and I only keep telling you about it because\nI'd like to you come join me here.\n\n\nI never said that.  I said that I would PREFER to cease to exist than\nto be tossed into any god's version of Hell.\n\n\nYou say to me, "Brian, come up here and take a look from this vantage\npoint."  But you're in a valley, looking at a crayon drawing of a sun\nand a tree, and I can't for the life of me figure out why you're so\nimmersed in it.  *I*'m the one trying to get you to come up HERE,\ndon't you see?
I think that if a theist were truly objective and throws out the notion that\nGod definitely exists and starts from scratch to prove to themselves that\nthe scriptures are the whole truth then that person would no longer be a\ntheist. \n\n\nYou're missing something here.  There are people who convert from\nnon-theism to theism after being brought up in a non-theist household.  (I\ndon't have any statistics as to how many though.  That would be an\ninteresting thing to know.)  I think that religion is a crutch.  People are\nnaturally afraid of the unknown and the unexplainable.  People don't want\nto believe that when they die, they are dead, finished.  That there is\nnothing else after that.  And so religion is kind of a nice fantasy.\nReligion also describes things we don't know about the universe (things\nscience has not yet described) and it also gives people a feeling of\nsecurity... that if they just do this one thing and everything will be ok.\nThat they are being watched over by a higher power and its minions.  This\nhas a very high psychological attraction for quite a few people and these\npeople are willing to put up with a few discrepancies and holes in their\nbelief system for what it gains them.  This is why I think it's kind of\nuseless to try too hard to convert theists to atheism.  They are happy with\ntheir fantasy and they feel that other people will be happy with it too\n(they can't accept the fact that there are people who would rather accept\nthe harsh reality that they are running from).\n\nAnyway, I'm getting kind of carried away here.  But my point is that theism\ndoesn't have to be ingrained into a child's mindset for that person to grow\nup as a theist (although this happens far too often).  Theism is designed\nto have its own attractions.
Its just variation within a thread.  The variation at times has been so great\nthat speciation has occurred.  So Albert Sabin is the common ancestor of\nseveral threads, some of which have themselves speciated.  On a separate topic,\nI subscribed to t.o. just recently.  Albert Sabin existed at that time, so I\nhave no clue as to its origins.  Maybe the abiogenesists have an answer.  I\nmight also point out that evolution is aimless.  Thus why Albert \nSabin evolved into a religious discussion is probably unexplainable.
Rick, I think we can safely say, 1) Robert is not the only person\nwho understands the Bible, and 2), the leadership of the LDS church\nhistoricly never has.  Let's consider some "personal interpretations"\nand see how much trust we should put in "Orthodox Mormonism", which\ncould never be confused with Orthodox Christianity.\n\n        In one of his attacks on Christians, the Mormon Apostle Bruce R.\nMcConkie said they "thrash around in...darkness in trying to identify\nElohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the promised\nMessiah." He also said Christians are wrong to believe "that Jehovah is\nthe Supreme Deity [God the Father]," and that Christ "came into\nmortality" as His "Only Begotten" Son. McConkie then stated what Mormons\nbelieve today to be the truth about the matter. He said that "Elohim is\nthe Father" and "Jehovah is the Son."\n\n  "Being thus aware of how far astray the religious intellectualists\n  have gone in defining their three-in-one God, it comes as no surprise\n  to learn that they thrash around in the same darkness in trying to\n  identify Elohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the\n  promised Messiah. Some sectarians even believe that Jehovah is the\n  Supreme Deity whose Son came into mortality as the Only Begotten. As\n  with their concept that God is a Spirit, this misinformation about the\n  Gods of Heaven is untrue. The fact is, and it too is attested by Holy\n  Writ, that Elohim is the Father, and that Jehovah is the Son who was\n  born into mortality as the Lord Jesus Christ, the promised Messiah.\n  (Promised Messiah, p. 100)\n\n        Notice that McConkie said the Christians are as wrong about\ntheir "three-in-one God" and their belief that "God is a Spirit" as they\nare in their understanding of who "Elohim" and "Jehovah" are. Before\nexamining McConkie's attack and its validity, we shall read a few more\nstatements by McConkie and other Mormon sources concerning the words\n"Elohim" and "Jehovah." McConkie stated:\n\n  "...the chief designation of Christ that has been preserved for us in\n  the Old Testament, as that ancient work is now published, is the\n  exalted name-title Jehovah. (Promised Messiah, p. 367)\n\n  "_Elohim_, plural word though it is, is also used as the exalted\n  name-title of God the Eternal Father, a usage that connotes his\n  supremacy and omnipotence, he being God above all Gods. (Mormon\n  Doctrine, p. 224)\n\n        Agreeing with McConkie on the question of who "Elohim" and\n"Jehovah" are, the Apostle James E. Talmage stated:\n\n  "_Elohim_, as understood and used in the restored Church of Jesus\n  Christ, is the name-title of God the Eternal Father, whose firstborn\n  Son in the spirit is _Jehovah_ -- the Only Begotten in the flesh,\n  Jesus Christ. (Jesus the Christ, p. 38)\n\n        "A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and the Twelve"\napostles of the Mormon Church states that "God the Eternal Father...[is]\ndesignate[d] by the exalted name-title 'Elohim'..." (Articles of Faith,\np. 466) "...Christ in His preexistent, antemortal, or unembodied\nstate...was known as Jehovah..." (Articles of Faith, p. 471)\n\n        Today Mormon leaders teach that "Elohim" in the OT refers to God\nthe Father and "Jehovah" refers to Christ. McConkie attacked Christians\nfor saying "Jehovah" can refer to the Father. He stressed that these two\n"name-titles" should not be changed around so that Christ is called\n"Elohim" and the Father is called "Jehovah." "...the Father...is Elohim,\nnot Jehovah.... Jehovah is Christ, and Christ is Jehovah; they are one\nand the same person." (Promised Messiah, p. 111)\n\n        In the OT of the KJV of the Bible, the Hebrew word "Elohim" is\nused to refer to the true God, false gods and goddesses, and the judges\nof Israel. When referring to the true God, "Elohim" is translated with a\ncapital "G." When referring to false gods and goddesses and the judges\nof Israel, it is translated with a small "g." It is translated four\ntimes as "judges" (Exod. 21:6; 22:8-9), once as "judge" (1 Sam. 2:25),\ntwice as "mighty" (Gen. 23:6; Exod. 9:28), once as "angels" (Ps. 8:5),\nonce as "godly" (Mal. 2:15), once as "great" (Gen. 30:8), and once as\n"very great." (1 Sam. 14:15)\n\n        The word "Jehovah" is the traditional pronunciation of the\ntetragrammation YHWH or YHVH with the vowel points taken from the word\n"Adonai."  Many people believe the true pronunciation of the\ntetragrammation was Yahweh or Yahveh. However, since "Jehovah" rather\nthan Yahweh is the word used by Mormonism, this section will also use\n"Jehovah" instead of Yahweh to examine the validity of the claims of\nMormon leaders regarding that name. "Jehovah," unlike "Elohim," is never\nused of false gods. It is the personal name of the triune God of the\nBible. In the KJV, "Jehovah" is rendered primarily "LORD," sometimes\n"GOD," and rarely "Lord."\n\n        Now that we understand something about the words "Elohim" and\n"Jehovah" and their use by Mormon leaders, we shall consider the Apostle\nMcConkie's attack on Christians for believing the Father is "Jehovah."\nIn trying to prove that "Jehovah" refers exclusively to Christ, McConkie\ncited several verses from the Bible. Some of these verses and McConkie's\ninterpretation of them will be examined to see whether he was right.\nRemember, McConkie said the Father is not "Jehovah;" He is only\n"Elohim." The first example we shall consider involves McConkie's\ninterpretation of Ps. 110:1. Of this verse he stated:\n\n  "Of whom spake David when his tongue was touched by the Holy Spirit\n  and he testified, "The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right\n  hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?" (Ps. 110:1.) Two\n  Lords are here involved: one is speaking to the other; one is greater\n  than the other; one is making provision for the triumph and glory of\n  the other. Who are they and what message is contained in this\n  Messianic prophecy?\n  "What think ye of Christ?" our Lord asked certain of his detractors\n  toward the end of his mortal ministry. "Whose son is he?" Is Christ\n  the Son of God or of someone else? Is he to be born of a divine Parent\n  or will he be as other men -- a mortal son of a mortal father? That he\n  was to be a descendant of David was a matter of great pride to all the\n  Jews. And so they answered, "The Son of David."\n  David's son? Truly he was. But he was more, much more. And so our\n  Lord, with irrefutable logic and to their complete discomfiture,\n  asked, "How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying, The Lord\n  said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine\n  enemies thy footstool? If David then call him Lord, how is he his\n  son?" That is, if he is only the Son of David, how is it that the\n  great King, acting under inspiration, calls him Lord and worships him\n  as such? And we might add: _Who is the other Lord, the one who spake\n  unto David's Lord?_ Can there be any question as to how Jesus is\n  interpreting the words of the Psalm? He is saying that it means: '_The\n  Father said unto the Son, Elohim said unto Jehovah_, sit thou on my\n  right hand, until after your mortal ministry; then I will raise you up\n  to eternal glory and exaltation with me, where you will continue to\n  sit on my right hand forever.' (Promised Messiah, pp. 101-102)\n  (emphasis added)\n\n        Agreeing with the above statement by McConkie, the following\nremark in the Mormon pamphlet _What the Mormons Think of Christ, p. 6\nreads: "The Lord [Elohim, the Father] said unto my Lord [Jehovah, the\nSon]..." (brackets in original)\n\n        McConkie clearly stated that it is "Elohim" the Father who is\nspeaking to "Jehovah" the Son in this Psalm. However, when one looks at\nthe Hebrew word translated "LORD," it becomes apparent that either the\nfirst "LORD" is not the Father or else the Father is "Jehovah." Either\nway McConkie is wrong. The Psalm reads:\n\n  "The LORD [Jehovah] said unto my Lord [Adon], Sit thou at my right\n  hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. (Ps. 110:1)\n\n        The first "LORD" in this verse is "Jehovah" who Mormonism says\nis Christ, not the Father. The second "Lord" is the Hebrew word "Adon"\n(singular for "Adonai," meaning master or lord). If the first "LORD" is\nthe Father and the second "Lord" is the Son, then the Father is\n"Jehovah" and the Son is "Adon." However, if the Father is not "Jehovah"\nas McConkie claimed, then the first "LORD" is "Jehovah" the Son, but\nwho, then, is "Adon?" Obviously the Father is "Jehovah" in this Psalm,\nand His Son is "Adon."\n\n        Another example involves Isa. 42:6 about which McConkie stated\nthe following:\n\n  "I the Lord have called thee in righteousness," _Isaiah quoted the\n  Father as saying of Christ_, "and will hold thine hand, and will keep\n  thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the\n  Gentiles." (Isa. 42:6.) (Promised Messiah, p. 81) (emphasis added)\n\n        McConkie said the Father was speaking of Christ in this passage\nwhich reads:\n\n  "I the LORD [Jehovah] have called thee in righteousness, and will hold\n  thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the\n  people, for a light of the Gentiles. (Isa. 42:6)\n\n        According to McConkie, "I the LORD" refers to the Father, and\n"thine" and "thee" refer to Christ. However, the "LORD" who is speaking\nis "Jehovah" which means either McConkie was wrong about who is speaking\nor else the Father is "Jehovah."\n\n        Another example involves Ps. 22:7-8. Of these verses McConkie\nstated:\n\n  shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, He trusted on the Lord\n  that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in\n  him." (Ps. 22:7-8.) _The fulfillment, as Jesus hung on the cross_, is\n  found in these words: "The chief priests mocking him, with the scribes\n  and elders, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be\n  the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will\n  believe him. He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will\n  have him: for he said, I am the Son of God. The thieves also, which\n  were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth." (Matt.\n  27:41-44.) (Promised Messiah, pp. 530-531) (emphasis added)\n\n        Ps. 22:7-8 reads as follows:\n\n  "All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they\n  shake the head, saying, He trusted on the LORD [Jehovah] that he would\n  deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.\n\n        McConkie said these verses had their fulfillment "as Jesus hung\non the cross." That means the person who was scorned in these verses was\nChrist. Who, then, was the "LORD" in whom he trusted? It was "Jehovah"\nthe Father.\n\n        Another example involves Ps. 31:13 and Ps. 41:9. Regarding them,\nMcConkie stated the following:\n\n  "With reference to the conniving and conspiring plots incident to our\n  Lord's arrest and judicial trials the prophecy was: "They took counsel\n  together against me, they devised to take away my life." (Ps. 31:13.)\n  "Mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my\n  bread, hath lifted up his heel against me." (Ps. 41:9.) (Promised\n  Messiah, p. 532)\n\n        Apostle McConkie said these Psalms refer to Christ's "arrest and\njudicial trials." We shall first consider Ps. 31 and then Ps. 41. While\nMcConkie only quoted verse 13 of Ps. 31, verse 14 will also be included\nto give a complete understanding of the matter.\n\n  "For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while\n  they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my\n  life. But I trusted in thee, O LORD [Jehovah]: I said, Thou art my God\n  [Elohim]. (Ps. 31:13-14)\n\n        McConkie said verse 13 referred to Jesus Christ. Verse 14 goes\non to tell that He (Christ) trusted in the "LORD" who is called His\n"God" or "Elohim." Mormonism teaches that the God above Jesus is\n"Elohim" the Father. Verse 14, however, reveals that the "Elohim" of the\nman Jesus is "Jehovah" the Father.\n\n        In Ps. 41, McConkie only quoted one verse; however, two verses\nwill be considered in this examination.\n\n  "Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my\n  bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.\n  But thou, O LORD [Jehovah], be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that\n  I may requite them. (Ps. 41:9-10)\n\n        McConkie stated above that verse 9 referred to Judas' role in\nChrist's death. Since it was Judas who was the "familiar friend" who\n"lifted up his heel," the pronouns "mine," "I," "my," and "me" in verse\n9 must refer to Christ. Notice that at the beginning of verse 10 there\nis a change of pronoun to "thou," which refers to the "LORD" (Jehovah).\nThen the pronouns "me" and "I" which refer to Christ are used again.\nThat means Christ was speaking to "Jehovah" the Father in these verses.\n\n        Another example involves McConkie's following remark about Ps.\n        110:4.\n\n  "One of the great Messianic prophecies, spoken by the mouth of David,\n  ever after the order of Melchizedek." (Ps. 110:4.) (Promised Messiah,\n  p. 450)\n\n        McConkie admitted this is a Messianic prophecy involving Christ.\nThe question is, What in this verse refers to Christ?\n\n  "The LORD [Jehovah] hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest\n  for ever after the order of Melchizedek. (Ps. 110:4)\n\n        Does the "LORD," which is "Jehovah," refer to Christ? If\nMcConkie is right and Jesus is "Jehovah," but the Father is not, then\nthe "LORD" would have to refer to Christ. But who, then, is the one\naddressed as the "priest forever after the order of Melchizedek?" The\nBible reveals that the one referred to is Jesus Christ (Heb. 5:8-10;\n6:20; 7); therefore, the "LORD" (Jehovah) in Ps. 110:4 is the Father.\n\n        Another example involves Isa. 53:4-12. Of these verses McConkie\nstated:\n\n  "Of the atoning sacrifice of the future Messiah, Isaiah said...\n     The _Lord_ has laid on him the iniquities of us all....\n     It pleased the _Lord_ to bruise him... (Promised Messiah, p. 234)\n     (emphasis added)\n\n        McConkie rightly said these verses refer to "the atoning\nsacrifice of the future Messiah." However, what he failed to mention is\nthat they also prove that the Father is "Jehovah." Verse 6 reads: "All\nwe like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way;\nand the LORD [Jehovah] hath laid on him [Christ] the iniquity of us\nall," and verse 10 reads: "Yet it pleased the LORD [Jehovah] to bruise\nhim [Christ]..."\n\n        Obviously the "LORD" who laid on Christ "the iniquity of us all"\nand who bruised Him is God the Father who is called "Jehovah" in these\nverses.\n\n        Remember, McConkie stated that "some sectarians even believe\nthat Jehovah is the Supreme Deity," and that Christ "came into\nmortality" as His "Only Begotten" Son. He called this concept\n"misinformation" that is "untrue." To prove that it is McConkie who is\nmisinformed and believing untruth, two Scriptural references (2 Sam.\n7:14; Ps. 2:7) will be examined. McConkie stated the following regarding\nthese Scriptures:\n\n  "In the midst of a passage that is clearly Messianic, the Lord says of\n  the Seed of David: "I will be his father, and he shall be my son." (2\n  Sam. 7:14.) In the second Psalm, the whole of which is also clearly\n  Messianic, occurs this statement: "Thou art my Son; this day have I\n  begotten thee." (Ps. 2:7.) Paul quotes both of these statements in\n  Hebrews 1:5 and says they are prophecies that Christ would come as the\n  Son of God. (Promised Messiah, p. 143)\n\n        McConkie cited Heb. 1:5 to show that 2 Sam. 7:14 and Ps. 2:7\nrefer to Christ who "would come as the Son of God." Since McConkie first\nreferenced 2 Sam. 7:14, this examination will, too. However, along with\nverse 14, verses 11-13 will also be included.\n\n  "And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people\n  Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the\n  LORD [Jehovah] telleth thee that he will make thee an house.\n  And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers,\n  I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy\n  bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.\n  He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of\n  his kingdom for ever. I will be his father, and he shall be my son. (2\n  Sam. 7:11-14)\n\n        These verses teach that the "LORD" (Jehovah) would have a Son,\nthe Messiah.\n        In the second example McConkie cited Ps. 2:7. This examination\nwill include verse 8. Notice that it is the "LORD" (Jehovah) who says,\n"Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee."\n\n  "I will declare the decree: the LORD [Jehovah] hath said unto me, Thou\n  art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.\n  Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance,\n  and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.\n\n        McConkie said these verses of Scripture are "clearly Messianic,"\nand he acknowledged they teach that "Christ would come as the Son of\nGod." What he is not willing to acknowledge, however, is that these\nScriptures also teach that the Father is "Jehovah" and that the\n"sectarians" who believe "Jehovah is the Supreme Deity whose Son" is\nJesus Christ, "the Only Begotten," are right in their belief.\n\n        Another example involves Mic. 5:4. Of this verse McConkie stated\nthe following:\n\n  "And so, truly, did our Lord act _during his mortal ministry! Truly,\n  this is he of whom it is written_: "He shall stand and feed in the\n  strength of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his\n  God... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth." (Mic.\n  5:4.) (Promised Messiah, p. 182) (emphasis added)\n\n        According to McConkie, the pronoun "He" at the beginning of Mic.\n5:4 refers to Christ "during his mortal ministry." Who, then, is the\n"LORD his God?" Mic. 5:4 reads:\n\n  "And he [Christ] shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD\n  [Jehovah], in the majesty of the name of the LORD [Jehovah] his God\n  [Elohim]... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.\n\n        Obviously the "LORD" of Jesus Christ is "Jehovah" the Father who\nis referred to as "Jehovah his Elohim."\n\n        Another example involves Ps. 2:2 and Isa. 61:1. Of these verses\nMcConkie stated the following:\n\n  "A number of Messianic passages speak of "the Lord, and...his\n  anointed" (Ps. 2:2), signifying that the Chosen One was consecrated\n  and set apart for the ministry and mission that was his. _Jesus\n  applied these passages to himself_ by quoting Isaiah's prophecy. "The\n  Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek" (Isa.\n  61:1), and then saying: "This day is this scripture fulfilled in your\n  ears" (Luke 4:21). (Promised Messiah, pp. 182-183) (emphasis added)\n\n        The first source McConkie quoted -- Ps. 2:2 -- reads as follows:\n\n  "The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel\n  together, against the LORD [Jehovah], and against his anointed.\n\n        McConkie said the "anointed" one was Christ. If that is true,\nwho was "Jehovah?" If "Jehovah" is always Christ, who was the "anointed"\none? Obviously "Jehovah" is referring to God the Father and the\n"anointed" is indeed referring to Christ. The second source McConkie\ncited is Isa. 61:1 which states:\n\n  "The Spirit of the Lord [Adonai] GOD [Jehovah] is upon me; because the\n  LORD [Jehovah] hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek;\n  he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to\n  the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;\n\n        The one who was anointed to preach, bind up, proclaim, and open\nwas Jesus Christ. Who, then, was the one who anointed Him? This verse\nsays the "LORD" (Jehovah) did the anointing. Again, we face the same\nproblem. If "Jehovah" does not refer to the Father, but only to Christ,\nthen Jesus anointed someone, but who? As McConkie pointed out, "Jesus\napplied these passages to himself." Therefore, the "Jehovah" who\nanointed Christ is God the Father.\n\n        Other examples could be cited to show that McConkie and other\nMormon leaders are wrong when they say God the Father is not "Jehovah."\nHowever, these should be enough to expose their error.\n\n        Now, what about Mormonism's claim that Jesus is "Jehovah," but\nHe is not "Elohim?" It is true that Jesus is "Jehovah." The following\nScriptures prove this fact:\n\n  "Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] the King of Israel, and his redeemer\n  the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and\n  beside me there is no God. (Isa. 44:6)\n  [Jesus said] ...I am the first and the last: I am he that liveth, and\n  was dead... (Rev. 1:17-18)\n\n  "...saith the LORD [Jehovah]...they shall look upon me whom they have\n  pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only\n  son... (Zech. 12:1,10)\n  Behold, he [Christ] cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him,\n  and they also which pierced him... (Rev. 1:7)\n\n  "...I am the LORD [Jehovah] thy God, the Holy One of Israel... (Isa.\n  43:3)\n  ...Ye denied the Holy One [Christ] and the Just... (Acts 3:14)\n\n  "And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of\n  the LORD [Jehovah] shall be delivered... (Joel 2:32)\n  "...the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth...there is none other name\n  under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. (Acts 4:10,12)\n\n  "Behold, the Lord GOD [Jehovah] will come with strong hand...his\n  reward is with him... (Isa. 40:10)\n  ...Behold, I [Christ] come quickly; and my reward is with me... (Rev.\n  22:12)\n\n  "...the LORD [Jehovah] my God shall come, and all the saints with\n  thee. (Zech. 14:5)\n  "...at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints. (1\n  Thess. 3:13)\n\n  "The LORD [Jehovah] is my shepherd... (Ps. 23:1)\n  [Jesus said] I am the good shepherd... (John 10:14)\n\n  "...saith the Lord GOD [Jehovah]. I will seek that which was lost...\n  (Ezek. 34:15-16)\n  ...the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.\n  (Luke 19:10)\n\n  "For I am the LORD [Jehovah] thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy\n  Saviour... (Isa. 43:3)\n  Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great\n  God and our Saviour Jesus Christ. (Tit. 2:13. See also Jer. 42:5 and\n  Rev. 1:5; Mal. 3:6 and Heb. 13:8; 1 Kin. 8:28,39 and John 2:24-25;\n  Isa. 25:8 and 2 Tim. 1:10; Ps. 107:24,29 and Matt. 8:26; Prov.3:12 and\n  Rev. 3:19)\n\n        While Mormons are right when they say Jesus is "Jehovah," they\nare wrong when they say He is not "Elohim." The Bible reveals that\n"Jehovah" is the only true "Elohim" there is; all others are false.\nRemember, "Jehovah" is the personal name of the triune God who has\nrevealed Himself in the Bible.\n\n        Before we consider Biblical quotes which show that "Jehovah" and\n"Elohim" are not two separate gods as Mormons claims let us first note\nthat not only are both God the Father and Christ addressed as "Jehovah"\nand "Elohim" but so is the Holy Spirit.\n\n  "Whereof the _Holy Ghost_..._said_...This _is_ the covenant that I\n  will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my\n  laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them; And\n  their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. (Heb. 10:15-17)\n  (emphasis on "Holy Ghost" and "said" added)\n  Behold, the days come, _saith the LORD_ [Jehovah], that I will make a\n  new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah...\n  I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts;\n  and will be their God [Elohim], and they shall be my people.... I will\n  forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more. (Jer.\n  31:31,33-34) (emphasis added)\n\n  "For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy\n  men of God spake as they were moved by the _Holy Ghost_. (2 Pet. 1:21)\n  (emphasis on "Holy Ghost" added)\n  "The Spirit of the LORD [Jehovah] spake by me, and his word was in\n  my tongue. (2 Sam. 23:2. See also Heb. 3:7-11 with Ps. 95:6-11)\n\n        Let us now continue with the Biblical quotes which show that\n"Jehovah" and "Elohim" are not two separate gods as Mormons claim.\n\n  "And when the LORD [Jehovah] saw that he [Moses] turned aside to see,\n  God [Elohim] called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said,\n  Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.... [Bruce R. McConkie\n  acknowledged that "it was" Christ's "voice that spoke to Moses in the\n  burning bush..." Promised Messiah, p. 394]\n  And the LORD [Jehovah] said...\n  And Moses said unto God [Elohim], Behold, when I come unto the\n  children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God [Elohim] of your\n  fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his\n  name? what shall I say unto them?\n  And God [Elohim] said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus\n  shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto\n  you.\n  And God [Elohim] said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto\n  the children of Israel, the LORD [Jehovah] God [Elohim] of your\n  fathers, the God [Elohim] of Abraham, the God [Elohim] of Isaac, and\n  the God [Elohim] of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for\n  ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations. (Exod.\n  3:4,7,13-15)\n\n  "And God [Elohim] spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD\n  [Jehovah]. (Exod. 6:2)\n\n  "I am the LORD [Jehovah], and there is none else, there is no God\n  [Elohim] beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:\n  (Isa. 45:5)\n\n  "But the LORD [Jehovah] is the true God [Elohim], he is the living God\n  [Elohim], and an everlasting king... (Jer. 10:10)\n\n  "Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] the King of Israel, and his redeemer\n  the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and\n  beside me there is no God [Elohim]. (Isa. 44:6)\n\n  "Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus,\n  saith the LORD [Jehovah], whose name is The God [Elohim] of hosts.\n  (Amos 5:27)\n\n  "Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD's\n  [Jehovah's] thy God [Elohim], the earth also, with all that therein\n  is. (Deut. 10:14)\n\n  "Wherefore thou art great, O LORD [Jehovah] God [Elohim]: for there is\n  none like thee, neither is there any God [Elohim] beside thee,\n  according to all that we have heard with our ears. (2 Sam. 7:22)\n\n  "And he said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD [Jehovah],\n  the God [Elohim] of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land.\n  (Jon. 1:9)\n\n  "For who is God [Elohim] save the LORD [Jehovah]? or who is a rock\n  save our God [Elohim]? (Ps. 18:31)\n\n  "Blessed is the nation whose God [Elohim] is the LORD [Jehovah]...\n  (Ps. 33:12. See also Ps. 144:15)\n\n  "Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God\n  [Elohim], the LORD [Jehovah], the Creator of the ends of the earth,\n  fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his\n  understanding. (Isa. 40:28)\n\n  "The mighty God [Elohim], even the LORD [Jehovah], hath spoken, and\n  called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down\n  thereof. (Ps. 50:1)\n\n  "Sing unto God [Elohim], sing praises to his name: estol him that\n  rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him. (Ps.\n  68:4) [Regarding the word "Jah," Bruce R. McConkie stated: "Jah\n  (Hebrew Yah) is a contracted form of Jehovah, Jahveh, or Yahweh -- all\n  of which names have reference to Christ, the God of Israel." Mormon\n  Doctrine, p. 391]\n\n  "And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from\n  Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God [Elohim], whose\n  name is called by the name of the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts that\n  dwelleth between the cherubims. (2 Sam. 6:2)\n\n  "...the Great the Mighty God [Elohim], the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts, is\n  his name. (Jer. 32:18)\n\n  "O my God [Elohim], make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the\n  wind....\n  Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD\n  [Jehovah]....\n  That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most\n  high over all the earth. (Ps. 83:13,16,18)\n\n        The Bible clearly teaches that "Jehovah" is "Elohim." In fact,\nHe is the only "Elohim" there is. He is the "true," the "living," the\n"mighty," the "great," and the "everlasting Elohim." He is the "Elohim"\nof Israel, of all the kingdoms of the earth, and of the heavens. He is\nthe Creator who made the heavens and all their host and the earth and\nall that dwell thereon. "Jehovah's" name is "Elohim of hosts." (Amos\n5:27)\n\n        Not only is "Jehovah," "Elohim," but "Elohim" is "Jehovah." The\nBible reveals that "Elohim's" name is "Jah" (Ps. 68:4), "Jehovah" (Ps.\n83:18), and "Jehovah of hosts." (2 Sam. 6:2; Jer. 32:18)   The nation\nwhose "Elohim" is "Jehovah" is blessed. (Ps. 33:12) Clearly, this is not\nthe "Jehovah" and "Elohim" of the Mormons.\n\n        Another Mormon error regarding "Elohim" and "Jehovah" is the\nbelief that "Elohim," not "Jehovah," is the Father of all the spirits,\nincluding Jesus. In the Articles of Faith by Apostle James E. Talmage,\n"A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and The Twelve" apostles\nstates that "God the Eternal Father...'Elohim,' is the literal Parent\nof...the spirits of the human race." (p. 466) This "Doctrinal\nExposition" also states explicitly that "Jesus Christ is not the Father\nof the spirits who have taken or yet shall take bodies upon this earth,\nfor He is one of them. He is The Son, as they are sons and daughters of\nElohim." (p. 473)\n\n        The Apostle Talmage stated that "_Elohim_...is the name-title of\nGod the Eternal Father, whose firstborn Son in the spirit is\n_Jehovah_--" (Jesus the Christ, p. 38)\n\n        The Apostle Bruce R. McConkie stated the following about this\nmatter: "...Jehovah-Christ...did in fact create the earth and all forms\nof plant and animal life on the face thereof. _But when it came to\nplacing man on earth, there was a change in Creators_. That is, the\nFather himself became personally involved. All things were created by\nthe Son, using the power delegated by the Father, except man. _In the\nspirit and again in the flesh, man was created by the Father_. There was\nno delegation of authority where the crowning creature of creation was\nconcerned." (Promised Messiah, p. 62) (emphasis added)\n\n        Mormon leaders claim that "Jehovah-Christ" did not create either\nman's spirit or his body. They maintain that the Mormon "Elohim," who is\nthe father, created man both in spirit and body. The Bible reveals the\ntruth about who created man.\n\n  "And Moses spake unto the LORD [Jehovah], saying,\n  Let the LORD [Jehovah], the God [Elohim] of the _spirits of all\n  flesh_, set a man over the congregation. (Num. 27:15-16. See also\n  16:20-23) (emphasis added)\n\n  "...the LORD [Jehovah], which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth\n  the foundation of the earth, and _formeth the spirit of man within\n  him_. (Zech. 12:1) (emphasis added)\n\n  "...the LORD [Jehovah]...made us this soul... (Jer. 38:16)\n\n  "For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for\n  the spirit should fail before me, and the _souls which I have\n  made_....\n  ...saith the LORD [Jehovah]... (Isa. 57:16,19) (emphasis on "souls...I\n  have made" added)\n\n  "Behold, I am the LORD [Jehovah], the God [Elohim] _of all flesh_...\n  (Jer. 32:27) (emphasis added)\n\n  "Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], thy redeemer, and he that _formed thee\n  from the womb_.\n  I am the LORD [Jehovah] that maketh all things... (Isa. 44:24)\n  (emphasis added)\n\n  "Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah]...\n  I have made the earth, and _created man_ upon it... (Isa. 45:11-12)\n  (emphasis added)\n\n  "...God [Elohim] created man upon the earth...\n  Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD\n  [Jehovah] he is God [Elohim]; there is none else beside him. (Deut.\n  4:32,35)\n\n  "Thus saith God [El] the LORD [Jehovah]...he that spread forth the\n  earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the\n  people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein. (Isa. 42:5)\n\n  "...Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts, the God [Elohim] of\n  Israel... I have made the earth, _the man_ and the beast that are upon\n  the ground... (Jer. 27:4-5) (most emphasis added)\n\n        The Bible reveals that it is "Jehovah" who is the "Elohim of the\nspirits of all flesh" and "of all flesh" itself, that it was He who\n"formed the spirit of man within him," that He "made us this soul" and\n"formed us from the womb." He did indeed "create man."\n\n        If Mormon leaders are right when they say Jesus is "Jehovah,"\nthen they are wrong when they say he did not create man. If they are\nright when they say the father is the one who created man, then they are\nwrong when they say he is not "Jehovah."\n\n        Although Mormon leaders teach that Jesus did not create man,\nMormon scriptures teach that he did. The BoM states the following:\n\n  "Behold, I am Jesus Christ. I am the Father and the Son....\n  And never have I showed myself unto _man whom I have created_, for\n  never has man believed in me as thou hast....\n  Behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit; and\n  _man have I created_ after the body of my spirit... (Eth. 3:14-16)\n  (emphasis added)\n\n  "For it is I that taketh upon me the sins of the world; for it is _I\n  that hath created them_... (Mos. 26:23) (emphasis added)\n\n  "...the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of\n  Jacob...is that same God who created the heavens and the earth, and\n  all things that in them are.\n  Behold _he created Adam_... (Mor. 9:11-12) (emphasis added)\n\n        D&C, 93:10 states that "the worlds were made by him [Christ];\n_men were made by him_; all things were made by him, and through him,\nand of him." (emphasis added)\n\n        Another error by Bruce R. McConkie involving "Jehovah" and his\ncreation is the belief that "Jehovah" had "many" pre-mortal spirits\nhelping him create. Included in this alleged group was Joseph Smith, Jr.\n\n  "That he [Christ] was aided in the creation of this earth by "many of\n  the noble and great" spirit children of the Father is evident from\n  go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these\n  materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell." (Abra.\n  3:22-24.) Michael or Adam was one of these. Enoch, Noah, Abraham,\n  Moses, Peter, James, and John, Joseph Smith, and many other "noble and\n  great" ones played a part in the great creative enterprise. (Doctrines\n  of Salvation, vol. 1, pp. 74-75.) (Mormon Doctrine, p. 169)\n\n        The Bible reveals the truth about this matter:\n\n  "Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], thy redeemer, and he that formed thee\n  from the womb, I am the LORD [Jehovah] that maketh all things; that\n  stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by\n  myself. (Isa. 44:24)\n\n  "Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of\n  the sea. (Job 9:8)\n\n        "Jehovah," by Himself, created all things. He had no alleged\npreexistent spirit helpers assisting Him.\n\n        Regarding the Mormon 'Elohim," the Apostle McConkie stated:\n"Elohim. plural word though it is, is also used as the exalted\nname-title of God the Eternal Father, a usage that connotes his\nsupremacy and omnipotence, he being God above all Gods." (Mormon\nDoctrine, p. 224) He also stated that "Jesus...is above all save the\nFather only." (Promised Messiah, p. 363)\n\n        The Bible states that the One who is God above all so-called\ngods is the triune God "Jehovah."\n\n  "For the LORD [Jehovah] is a great God [El], and a great King above\n  all gods [Elohim]. (Ps. 95:3)\n\n  "For thou, LORD [Jehovah], art high above all the earth: thou art\n  exalted far above all gods [Elohim]. (Ps. 97:9)\n\n  "Now I know that the LORD [Jehovah] is greater than all gods\n  [Elohim]... (Exod. 18:11. See also Ps. 135:5; Deut. 10:17)\n\n        If Mormon leaders are right when they say "Jehovah" is god the\nson and "Elohim" is god the father, these verses from the Bible would be\nteaching that the Mormon son is above his father. However, as McConkie\nclearly stated, Mormons believe "Elohim" the father, not "Jehovah" the\nson, is the "God above all Gods" -- that Jesus is above all except the\nfather; yet the Bible teaches that "Jehovah" is above all "Elohim."\n\n        At a BYU Dev. on March 2, 1982, Bruce R. McConkie made the\nfollowing remark about praying to Jesus:\n\n  "Another peril is that those so involved often begin to pray directly\n  to Christ because of some special friendship they feel has been\n  developed....\n  This is plain sectarian nonsense. Our prayers are addressed to the\n  Father, and to him only....\n  ...Perfect prayer is addressed to the Father, in the name of the Son;\n  it is uttered by the power of the Holy Ghost... (Our Relationship With\n  the Lord, pp. 19-20)\n\n        McConkie states on p. 335 of his book Promised Messiah that the\nMormons "pray to the Father, not the Son..." On p. 306 of the same book\nMcConkie states that "Christ [the Son] is Jehovah." This is important to\nremember, because although McConkie said prayer is not to be offered to\nthe Mormon Christ who is "Jehovah," the Bible states repeatedly in the\nOT that people prayed to "Jehovah," and He not only heard those prayers,\nbut He accepted them as valid requests. The following is but a small\nsample of the vast number of times people prayed to "Jehovah."\n\n  "In my distress I called upon the LORD [Jehovah], and cried unto my\n  God [Elohim]: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came\n  before him, even into his ears. (Ps. 18:6)\n\n  "And the LORD [Jehovah] said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy\n  supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this\n  house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine\n  eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually. (1 Kin. 9:3)\n\n  "And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our\n  supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the LORD\n  [Jehovah] thy God [Elohim], even for all this remnant... (Jer. 42:2)\n\n  "O LORD [Jehovah], I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to\n  the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who\n  desire to fear thy name... (Neh. 1:11)\n\n  "And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this\n  prayer and supplication unto the LORD [Jehovah], he arose from before\n  the altar of the LORD [Jehovah], from kneeling on his knees with his\n  hands spread up to heaven. (1 Kin. 8:54)\n\n  "He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed\n  unto the LORD [Jehovah]. (2 Kin. 4:33)\n\n  "Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], the God\n  [Elohim] of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy\n  tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years. (Isa. 38:5)\n\n  "I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I\n  said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD [Jehovah]; and\n  thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.\n  For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when\n  thou mayest be found... (Ps. 32:5-6)\n\n        Notice above in Ps. 32:6 that the "godly" pray to "Jehovah."\nAccording to McConkie and other Mormon leaders, that is Christ the very\none to whom McConkie said people should not pray.\n\n        The Bible reveals there is only one true "Elohim," and His name\nis "Jehovah." All other "Elohim" are false. They are idols that cause\ntheir followers to commit adultery against the true "Elohim" and\nidolatry.\n\n  "For the LORD [Jehovah] is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to\n  be feared above all gods [Elohim].\n  For all the gods [Elohim] of the nations are idols: but the LORD\n  [Jehovah] made the heavens. (Ps. 96:4-5)\n\n  "Thou shalt have no other gods [Elohim] before me. (Exod. 20:3)\n\n  "Now I know that the LORD [Jehovah] is greater than all gods\n  [Elohim]... (Exod. 18:11)\n\n  "And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD [Jehovah] thy God\n  [Elohim], and walk after other gods [Elohim], and serve them, and\n  worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely\n  perish. (Deut. 8:19)\n\n  "Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods [Elohim].\n  They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me:\n  for if thou serve their gods [Elohim], it will surely be a snare unto\n  thee. (Exod. 23:32- 33)\n\n  "Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn\n  aside, and serve other gods [Elohim], and worship them. (Deut. 11:16)\n\n  "That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you;\n  neither make mention of the name of their gods [Elohim], nor cause to\n  swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them.\n  (Josh. 23:7)\n\n  "...neither walk after other gods [Elohim] to your hurt. (Jer. 7:6)\n\n  "But the LORD [Jehovah] is the true God [Elohim], he is the living God\n  [Elohim]... (Jer. 10:10)\n\n  "And they forsook the LORD [Jehovah] God [Elohim] of their fathers,\n  which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods\n  [Elohim], of the gods [Elohim] of the people that were round about\n  them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD [Jehovah]\n  to anger. (Jud. 2:12)\n\n  "Shall a man make gods [Elohim] unto himself, and they are no gods\n  [Elohim]? Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I\n  will cause them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know\n  that my name is the LORD [Jehovah]. ( Jer. 16:20-21)\n\n  "And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD [Jehovah], choose you\n  this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods [Elohim] which your\n  fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods\n  [Elohim] of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my\n  house, we will serve the LORD [Jehovah].\n  And the people answered and said, God [Elohim] forbid that we should\n  forsake the LORD [Jehovah], to serve other gods [Elohim]. (Josh.\n  24:15-16)\n\n        These verses teach that the only true, living "Elohim" in heaven\nand on earth is "Jehovah" -- the triune God who made heaven and earth\nand all therein.\n\n        "Jehovah" is greater than any "Elohim," because all other\n"Elohim" are idols. The reality behind them is demonic. (Deut. 32:17)\n"Jehovah Elohim" has given explicit warnings and guidelines regarding\nthese false "Elohim." He told His people not to have any "Elohim" but\nHim. He told the people that if they left Him for the false "Elohim,"\nthose "Elohim" would be a snare to them, and they would be hurt and\nwould perish. He warned the people to "take heed" that their "heart be\nnot deceived" into worshiping, serving, swearing by, and making\ncovenants with false "Elohim." "Jehovah Elohim" told His people He would\neventually judge all false "Elohim" and their followers.\n\n        Despite these warnings and guidelines, "Elohim's" covenant\npeople forsook Him and believed in and worshiped the false "Elohim's" of\nthe people they came in contact with. Ju. 10:6 states that "the children\nof Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD [Jehovah] and served\nBaalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods [Elohim] of Syria, and the gods\n[Elohim] of Zidon, and the gods [Elohim] of Moab, and the gods [Elohim]\nof the children of Ammon, and the gods [Elohim] of the Philistines, and\nforsook the LORD [Jehovah], and served not him."\n\n        This examination has shown that the "Elohim" of Mormonism, like\nthe "Elohim" in Ju. 10:6 is not the true "Jehovah Elohim." Therefore,\nthe people who leave the true "Elohim" for the Mormon "Elohim" will do\n"evil...in the sight of the LORD [Jehovah]."\n\n        Although McConkie attacked Christians for their belief in a\ntriune God who is Spirit and for their belief that God the Father\n[Jehovah] sent His Son into the world, these beliefs are true. God is\ntriune; He is Spirit; He is "Jehovah;" and He did send His Son into the\nworld to redeem mankind.\n\n        It is obvious from this examination that it is not the\nChristians who "thrash around in...darkness" about who "Elohim" and\n"Jehovah" are. One wonders what "Holy Writ" McConkie had in mind when he\nstated that it attests to the fact that "Elohim is the Father, and that\nJehovah is the Son." He certainly did not mean the Bible which teaches\nthat the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are all the one "Jehovah Elohim."\nHe apparently did not mean the D&C either, because chapter 109, verses\n1,4,9-10, 14,19,22,24,29,34,42,47,56,68,77 refer to the Father as\n"Jehovah."\n\nSummary\n\n        Obviously Joseph Fielding Smith's statement that the Mormons\n"have a clear and perfect understanding of the nature of God" (Doctrines\nof Salvation, 1:279) is not accurate. The Mormon gods are not the true\nGod as Mormonism claims, but are idols which cause their followers to\ncommit adultery against God and idolatry.\n\n        In answer to Jesus' question, "But whom say ye that I am,"\nMormons say Jesus is someone different from the Jesus who is revealed in\nthe Bible and whom the apostles preached. Therefore, anyone trusting in\nthe Mormon Jesus is believing in "another Jesus" whom Paul warned about.\n\n        Bernard P. Brockbank, of the First Quorum of the Seventy,\nadmitted in the May 1977 issue of The Ensign, a Mormon publication, that\nthe Mormon Jesus is different from the Christian Jesus. He stated that\n"it is true that many of the Christian churches worship a different\nJesus Christ than is worshipped by the Mormons or The Church of Jesus\nChrist of Latter-day Saints." (p. 26)\n\n        The people who believe in the Mormon Jesus are committing\nadultery against God and idolatry. They do not have the Son; therefore,\nthey do not have the Father, and they do not have eternal life. As the\nApostle Bruce R. McConkie rightly stated: "Salvation comes only by\nworshiping the true God." (Promised Messiah, p. 163) McConkie also\nrightly stated that "the mere worship of a god who has the proper\nscriptural names does not assure one that he is worshiping the true and\nliving God," because the "true names of Deity" can be applied to "false\nconcepts of God." (Mormon Doctrine, p. 270) Remember that the Apostle\nStephen L. Richards admitted that Joseph Smith, Jr., gave "a new\nconception of God and the Godhead." (Contributions of Joseph Smith, p.\n1)\n\n        It is important for the people who have left the true triune God\nrevealed in the Bible to repent and return to Him. They must forsake the\nsins of idolatry and adultery which they are committing in Mormonism.\n\n  "...all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, and they that depart from\n  me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the LORD\n  [Jehovah], the fountain of living waters. (Jer. 17:13)\n\n  "And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD [Jehovah] thy God\n  [Elohim], and walk after other gods [Elohim], and serve them, and\n  worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely\n  perish. (Deut. 8:19)\n\n  "Thou shalt make no covenant with...their gods [Elohim]. (Exod. 23:32)\n\n  "...Put away the strange gods [Elohim] that are among you, and be\n  clean, and change your garments. (Gen. 35:2)\n\n  "...flee from idolatry. (1 Cor. 10:14)\n\n        It is necessary that Christians heed the warnings of the Bible.\nIf they do, they will not fall into the sins of adultery against God and\nidolatry. Remember, to know the "only true God" is eternal life. (John\n17:3)
Didn't expect to find you in the Devil's role, Stephen, but these are\nthe times that try men's souls.\nNine months, as I understand it.  No doubt this accounts for a \nsignificant amount of the time as government efficiency in spending\nour tax dollars would certainly seek its absolute minimum in such\nan event.  But my gut instinct says there is more at hand.  It took\nsome careful preplanning to demonize D.K. to such an extent.  The\nattack meshes well with more restrictive gun control legislation\nthat seems to be the agenda of the day.  It also fits a pattern of\nincreased government interference in personal religious beliefs.\n[Randy Weaver is now on trial].\n\nNo quarrel here.  The BIG BANG theory is always apt at appropriation\ntime.  They just don't have to possess a single motive.\n \n\nI certainly think publication of the warrant undermines the government's\ncase since it makes no claims of illegal action.  Therefore the federal\njudge had reason to seal it.  But I am reminded of Senator Frank Church's\nremark that "secrecy is the trademark of a totalitarian government."\nThere is rarely sufficient motive to seal a warrant in a nation of\nfree people.\n\nHow can I argue with irrefutable logic?  I have long suspected that\nthe government has become a mindless machine and now you go and\nconfirm my worst fears!  Has it become a BEAST that is programmed\nsimply to say "Kiss my toe and you get your piece of the pie?"\nI suspect bugs in the program arise when agents or those who love\nthis critter have independent thoughts.\n \n\nAnd watching Terminator II.\n\nYes, 186 seeds for a new Republic.

Ah, you taking everything as literal quotation.  No wonder you're confused.\n\nFirst, can I ask that we decide on a definition of "objective"?\n\n\nAnd?\n\n\nI'd guess that it might be.\n\n\nIt may be the case that some people are unable to evaluate complex moral\nissues.  Rather than leaving them to behave "immorally", it might be better\nto offer them an abstract (nonexistent objective) system of ethics which they\ncan strive towards, coded into rules which they don't have to derive for\nthemselves.\n\nI tend to feel that this is pretty much what we all have as morality\nanyway...

[ There are actually some talk.abortion related comments below, believe it or\n  not... ]\n\n\nWell, if our observer X is as likely to be in A's position as B's, and if he\nagrees that both A and B are making appropriate observations and inferences\nregarding the situation, then I would expect him to conclude that there is no\nright answer.  Hopefully there would be some other factor which would allow\nhim to make some judgement regarding which answer to accept.\n\nIf, on the other hand, he disagrees with the principles of either A or B, I\nsuspect he would make a decision in favour of the other one.\n\nIt is unfortunately the case that not all moral arguments have answers from\nall perspectives.  For instance, I am completely unable to come to any\nconclusion regarding whether abortion should be allowed or not, from my\nperspective.  In an ideal world, all living things would have a right to\nlife; but in an ideal world, women would have the absolute right to do what\nthey like with their own bodies.  Clearly there is no way to resolve in\nfavour of both these principles.  Therefore I agree with the compromise\nsolution of allowing abortion up to a certain time after conception, and\ndeciding on the time based on various (sometimes ill-defined) criteria.  This\nis also a sensible move, I think, because it lets people make their own\ndecisions (within reason).  And for what it's worth, I am reasonably happy\nwith current UK abortion law.\n\nSimilarly, the situation in what's left of Yugoslavia is a horrible mess, and\nI really can't see my way to any sort of conclusion.  There, I don't even\nknow enough to imagine what sort of compromise one might manage.

Thank you, Steve.  It is refreshing to have someone accuse me of being\na Christian.  I only hope enough evidence can be garnered to get a\nconviction.  I am not certain what you mean by the "fundy" part as the\nterm fundamentalist has a wide variety of uses.  If you refer to\nthose who actually believe Jesus is the Messiah and Son of God and\nwish to follow in his way, then I plead guilty.  But what does it\nmatter what I think.  The Roman circus is over.  The lions have been\nsatisfied -- for now.  The Emperor, after the long and gruelling\nstruggle, sensed the crowd was tiring and gave thumbs down.\n\nWith respect to my previous comments about David Koresh, I urge you\nto re-examine my previous posts.  I believe you mistakenly assume\nthat defense of Koresh' right to his own personal beliefs and his\nright to express them to others implies agreement with Koresh'\ntheology.  Actually I understand little about the details of Branch-\nDavidian teachings and regret so many are hung-up on that aspect\nof the tragic events of the past few days.\n\nNor do I think Koresh' sex life should be of any interest to the\nfederal government.  Of course Hillary says he had been molesting\ninfants so it must be true even though such allegations do not\nfall under the jurisdiction of the federal government; they are\nstate and local matters and have been thoroughly reviewed at the\nlocal level by proper authorities with no successful charge having\never been levied against him.  Under American law, he was innocent\nas Americans are presumed innocent until proven guilty.  At least\nthat's how it is suppposed to be.  But he was demonized and propa-\ngandized against by a powerful machine to have him appear as a\nlustful beast and therefore deserving of every ill the fates might\nbring upon him.  \n\nBut evidence trickles in that the twenty-one children, who left the\nbuilding in the early days of the siege,  were carefully examined\nby qualified authorities for evidence of physical or sexual abuse\nand none was found.  DeGuerin, one of the attorneys who met with\nDavidians several times before the conflagration, reported that\nthe children seemed well adjusted and showed no sign of abuse.\n\nUltimately, Steve, what I think about the heart of David Koresh\nis quite unimportant.  Today he is in the benevolent hands of a\nmost wise and merciful judge who will one day surely judge us all.\nSo I withhold any judgment of David Koresh and defer to the One\nwho has all knowledge.  Meanwhile, let's clean up the mess left\non earth and keep this from happening again by sending a strong\nmessage to the government to respect the inalienable rights of the\npeople it serves.\n\n--Joe Gaut

pmoloney@maths.tcd.ie (Paul Moloney) writes...\n\n\nNever lived out in the country I see. 4 years ago I had a place\nwhere I had to carry in propane every month, hook the bottle up \nto copper line, to supply both the stove, and a type of water-\nheater called a flash-heater. A flash heater has a pilot lamp.\n\nHere's the point. If the Davidians had their propane tanks hooked \nup to copper (or some such) lines, run through the ceiling spaces\n-- when the FBI started wrecking the place, they could easily have\nruptured the lines. Which then would start spreading out through\nthe overhead. And since it was a country home, it wasn't necessarily\nbuilt with non-flamable insulation. \n\nIt's probably more plausible than anything else, that the fire started\nmainly as a result of accident -- or willful negligence on the part of\nthe FBI, which should have known better (ie. manslaughter).\n\nIt's certain that if the tanks hadn't been used that day -- the fire\nwouldn't have started.
I've just spent two solid months arguing that no such thing as an\nobjective moral system exists.
Did you by any chance see the pictures of the agents in flak jackets climbing\nup on the roof and breaking windows.  You call that peaceful?  If you\nbelieved, as these people did, that they would be attacked by evil forces\nfrom the outside, found the scores of agents breaking into your compound\nwhat would you do?  Your beliefs always determine your actions.  The\nbeliefs may be wrong from my point of view but they are yours all the same.\n\nTo make it more practical.  If I attempted to stick you with a needle you\nwould try to stop me because you believe it would hurt, or that I do not\nhave that right.  If you did not you would ignore me.  You certainly would\nit you saw me sticking the needle in a tree.\n\nKoresh may have been misguided, only God knows.  But the Jews at Masada\ndied for what they believed, the three Hebrews preferred to die in the\nfurnace rather than bow down, Daniel preferred to die in a lion's den\nrather than stop praying to his God, and as a Christian I am prepared to\ndie for my faith.\n\nKoresh was not dying for now reason.  He had a cause.  Why should he give\nup the children to forces he was convinced were evil.  The events are\nbizarre but they match his beliefs.

Jim and Andy both have it incorrect I believe:\n\nThe *facts* are what is there, the processes that exist in the\npresent or the physical evidence of the processes having occured\nin the past. These *facts* exist with or without a theory.\n\nThe *theory* tries and explains the *facts* and how they relate\nto the rest of the physical universe in a manner that is both\ncoherent and useful, that it can be used to make predictions.\n\nThe *facts* of gravity, evolution, electromagnetic radiation,\nrelativity, atoms will exist and behave in the way in which they\nbehave regardless of whether we have a theory to try and explain\nhow they interact... or even why.\n\nA theory never really becomes a fact... but a theory can predict\nthe existence of a previously unknown fact, and if we find this\nfact as the theory predicted we say the *theory* is *supported*\nby the *facts*. A theory is a mental construct, a speculation, \na model.  If it is a good model, it may be useful.\n\nIn science a theory is something that is supported by the \nevidence, considerable evidence, sometimes *all* of the evidence.\nA *hypothesis* is a new fledgling theory because there is not\nyet enough evidence to support it.  When a new hypothesis \nis proposed to replace an existing theory, it must explain\n*all* of the facts that the current theory explains and at least\nsome of the facts that the current theory could not and/or\npredict new facts.\n\nIt is so simple.... I'm surprised that this subject gets\nbeat to death about once a month. A quick glance in a dictionary\nwould clear up 99% of the confusion and bandwidth in this\nnewsgroup.  Then we could talk about really important things\nlike, why do men have nipples?\n\n-David Utidjian-\nutidjian@remarque.berkeley.edu

He is God.\n\n\nHe is God.\n\n\nGod granted you the gift of life whether you were sinner or saint.\n \n\nThe scientist creates the living creature to examine it, poke and prod it and\nlearn about its behaviour.  He will kill it if it becomes a threat.  For\nexample, let's say the scientist creates a Tyrannosaurus Rex and it breaks\nfree of its confines and starts devouring the population.  The scientist\nwould not hesitate in killing it.\n\nGod creates us to be His loving companions.  He knows whether we are true in \nour love for Him or not.  And He lets us know the consequences of rejecting Him.\nGod cannot abide by sin.  By rejecting God, a person becomes an enemy of God,\none that must be killed by Him.  Note:  I say that God and God alone is\nworthy to be Judge, Jury and Executioner.  We are not called to carry out\nsuch duties because we are not worthy.\n \n\nGod is God.

Rome was under attack by barbarians, they sent for advice to some Oracle,\nand she said Worship Cybele and you'll be saved. They did, they were.\n\nCybele was the quintessential wiccan goddess, there was Her and her son &\nlover, Attis. Yucky idea if you ask me. OK the book says she was Phrygian,\nfrom the neolithic matriarchal society Catal Huyuk (Turkey). Worshipped 1st\nas Black Stone (that Kaaba in Mecca ring a bell maybe????) Carried to Rome\nin 205BC to save them from Hannibal.\n\nIt gets more interesting. Romans called her Great Mother (Magna Mater),\ncould be the reason why so many of those Mary statues in Europe are black,\nprob. IS connected to that Ka'aba they've got in Mecca, 3rd cent. AD She was\nsupreme Goddess in Lyons, France . . . Attis was castrated and formed into\na pine tree . . . she should be worshiped on 25 Mar . . . in Rome it was\nan ecstatic cult, her priests wore drag, worked themselves up in dance and\ncastrated themselves in order to initiate to her, lived their lives as women.\nThey wore make up and jewelry and the whole bit.\n\nWow.\n\nOnly other such primitive transsexualism I know of goes on in India (where\nelse?) where they do that castration thing under some meditation maybe, I\nforget by now...there's a book on that.)\n\nOf course, that excepts that weird Russian / Romanian 18th cent. Xian cult\nthat did all kinds of self-castration too, I forget their name.
Brian Kendig first states:\n\n\nI ask:\n\n\nBrian Kendig states:\n\n\nMake up your mind. \n\n\nAnd we do not end perfect either.  We are never perfect.  Can you name\none person, young or old, past or present, that you deem perfect? \nGood luck.\n\n\nThen you lie to yourself.  You do not know your shortcomings.  I have clearly\nshown one of your shortcomings, if not two.  That is, ignorance of the Bible\nand the arrogance you demonstrate butchering it without even knowing its \ncontents.\n\n\nBecause you have been too prideful to examine the record of him for yourself.\nAnd to demonstate your lack of support for your conclusion, I bet you do not\neven know what the word "Christ" means.  Or which prophet used "Christ" to \ndescribe the "Son of Man". \n\n\nYes.  I agree with that.  So we must learn first.  Read the Bible.  Come\nup with our own interpretation.   Evaluate what is being said\nand by whom.  Check the history books as well.  Compare someone else's\ninterpretation with your own.  Then make a judgment.  But I tell you the\ntruth, 99% of what is being said in the Bible needs interpretation as \nmuch as a coffee cup needs interpretation.\n\nAnd remember, the Bible isn't a Guru's Esoteric Guide to Metaphysics.  \nIt doesn't take a theologian to understand what is being said.    The \nBible is a bunch of testimonies from people like you and I addressed \nto people like you and I.  These guys wrote down what they saw and heard.  Is it \ntheir open diary--and they want to tell you something.  And because they\nwant you to know something, they make it very clear what they want you to\nknow.   They didn't encouch their ideas in esoteric rhetoric, but in simple\nstraight-forward language.\n\n\nYou have chosen the road that avoids the Bible.  You have chosen the\nroad that avoids a confrontation with the living God because that\nroad doesn't look appealing to you.  You rather build your own road.  One\nthat goes far away from that confrontation.   But be assured of this,\nyou will have to confront him one day willingly or unwillingly. \n\n\nI see what you mean.  I hear what your saying.  I am not degrading your\nlife.  But I have heard the same irrational excuses for years.  There is nothing \nnew in what you are saying.  And by your own words, you are "spouting off" \ncontradictions.   If contradictions give you meaning, then your life must\nbe sad.\n\n\nBingo.  For God so loved the world, he GAVE his only begotton to son\nso that whososever belives in him will have ever lasting life.   I look\nwhat God *did*.  He has given his Son, even to his death, so that I can have \nhope in his resurrection and know that life isn't for nothing, but has\nglorious purpose.\n\n\nBecause you turn your eyes away from testimony and history.  You choose to\nlie to yourself that he doesn't exist, for you ignore what has been said for \nthousands of years.  You sound exactly, almost verbatim, like the Lazarus of \nJesus's story starting in Luke 16:19.  And the conclusion of that story is a \nbleak one.  Lazarus wound up in hell.  The story ends like this:\n\n      "For if Lazarus doesn't even listen to Moses and the Prophets,\n       he won't even believe if a man rose from the dead."\n\n\nArrogance at its best.   The fact is, you are not rational.  Several specific\ncases  have already been cited.   And again with this new statement, you show more irrationality with regards to heaven.  Jesus does tell you something of what to expect\nin heaven.  Jesus expects you to use your brain to believe in him.  Jesus does\nnot expect you to placate either.  Jesus wants you to willingly come to him, but not\nas his grovelling slave, but rather as his brother who will share in his\nglorious riches.  Why do you not pick up the Bible and read it for yourself.  \nYou maintain you have an open mind.  See whether you are lying to yourself for\nyourself.\n\n\n\nI do understand what you said.   But that's is not what I feel went amiss here.\n\nYou missed the point.  Living a "good life" has no eternal consequences.\nOnce they close the amusement park of life, to you that is the end.  To you, it \nis over.  To you, therefore, your time spent in the amusement park is meaningless. \nIt has no eternal consequences to you nor to anyone left on earth. \n\nBut then you contradict yourself.  From a previous post, you said doing evil things \nis bad.  To you, it shouldn't matter if you do evil things or good things.  It is\nall meaningless in the end anyway.  So go rob a bank.  Go tell someone\nyou dislike that he is a dirty rotten slime bag.  What's restraining you?\nLife after all, has no eternal consequences and accountability is irrelevant.\n\n\nAt which time, you are truly not the master of yourself.\n\n\nSo you (and your holy book) say.  By the same token, therefore, Santa\nClaus delivers toys every xmas.  Don't you see?  I have NO REASON to\nbelieve that what you say is true.  Please give me some reason that I\ncan't similarly apply to Santa Claus.\n\nYou have EVERY reason to believe that what Jesus says and the witnesses\nof Jesus say are true.  But you choose to be unreasonable and "ignore" the\nreasons.  By definition, "ignorance". \n\nSanta Claus is said to live at the North Pole and have a squad of elves\nand flying reindeer.   Ever see a flying reindeer?  Has anyone in human\nhistory seen a flying reindeer?  Has anyone seen a reindeer whose nose \nblinks red?    \n\nOn the other hand, are people born in Bethlehem?  Was Nebuchandezzar really\na king?  Was Daniel really one of his court officials?  Were David and Solomon\nreally kings of Israel and Judah?  Was their really a king called Jehoachin?\nDid Sennecherib really attack Jerusalem 600 years before Christ?  Did\nSennacherib really lose his battle--and badly?   Was there really a \nCaiaphas who interrogated Jesus?   Yes, yes, yes . . . history verifies\nit.  It is NONFICTION.\n\nDo you have a problem discerning truth from fiction?  Perhaps you\ncan't evaluate the context of Grimm's Fairy Tales apart from\nthat of the Scientific American.  I suppose you treat both with equal\ntruthfulness or equal falsity.  Is this what you are telling me?  Or\nis it that just do want to read the Scientific American and find out\nthat it's not a fairy tale?\n\n\nGet real.  Have you ever been to Zaire?  Do you have to go there\nto be  assured that there really is such a place?  Given your \nirrationality, I take it you have never used a map in your life.
In the King James Version of the Bible there are three differents words \ntranslated into the word "hell".  These Greek words have totally different \nmeanings.  The words are Hades, Tartaros, and Gehenna.\n\n    In bibical usage, the Greek word Hades is used only 11 times in the \nNew Testament, and is roughly the equivalent to the Old Testament word Sheol...\nmeaning the grave or pit (compare Acts 2:27 with Psalms 16:10).  Hades may be \nlikened to a hole in the ground. (In the Bible it has nothing to do with fire!)\n\n    Most modern bibical translators admit that the use in the English word hell\nto translate Hades and Sheol are an unfortunate and misleading practice.  \n\n    Why?  Because when seeing the word "hell" many readers impute to it the \ntraditional connotation of an ever-burning inferno, when this was never \nremotely intended in the Greek language or in Old English!\n\n    In its true bibical usage Hades does indeed refer to the state or abode of \nthe dead, but not in the sense of spirits walking around in some sort of \n"shadowy realm."  Hades is simply the abode we call the grave.  All dead go to \nthis hell.\n\n    The second "hell" of the Bible, Tartaros, is mentioned only once in \nscripture, 2 Pet.2:4; "For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast \nthem down to hell (TARTAROS), and delivered them into chains of darkness to be \nreserved unto judgment..."\n\n    Following their rebellion to unseat God from His throne (Isa.14:12-14; \nRev.12:4), the archangel Lucifer (now Satan) and a third of the created angels \n(now demons) were ejected from heaven (Luke 10:18).  They were cast down to \nTartaros, a place or condition of restraint that God has imposed on the \nmutinous angels as they await ultimate judgment (Jude 6; 1 Cor.6:3).\n\n    Tartaros, then, is a "hell" that applies only to evil, rebellious angels or\ndemons (It is interesting that the ancient Greeks used this word to describe \nthe place in which Zeus confined the rebellious Titans).  Nowhere in the Bible \nis there any mention of men being put into this particular "hell".\n\n    The the third word that is translated as "hell" in the Bible is Gehenna. It\ncomes from the Hebrew GAI HINNOM, meaning "valley of Hinniom."  Hinnom is a \ndeep, narrow ravine located to the south and southwest of Jerusalem.\n\n    In Old Testament times it was a place of abominable pagan rites, including \ninfant sacrifice (It was there that the apostate kings Ahaz and Manasseh made \ntheir children "pass through the fire" to the god Molech.  The rites were \nspecifically celebrated in Tophet, the "place of abhorrence," one of the chief \ngroves in the valley).\n\n    King Josiah of ancient Judah finally put an end to these abominations.  He \ndefiled the valley, rendering it ceremonially unclean (2 Kings 23:10).  Later \nthe valley became the cesspool and city dump of Jerusalem; a repository for \nsewage, refuse and animal carcasses.  The bodies of dispised criminals were \nalso burned there along with the rubbish.  Fires burned continuously, feeding \nby a constant supply of garbage and refuse.\n\n    Aceldama, the "field of blood", purchased with the money Judas received for\nthe betrayal of Christ (Matt.27:8) was also in part of the valley of Hinnom.\n\n    So what does this valley called Gehenna have to do with hell?  \n\n    In Rev.19:20: the Satan inspired political dictator and a miracle-working \nreligious figure, the False Prophet, working with him will resist the \nre-establishment of the government of God by Jesus Christ at His Second Coming.\nTheir fate is revealed by the apostle John: "And the beast was taken, and with \nhim the false prophet...  These both were cast alive into a lake of fire \nburning with brimstone."\n    \n    Where will this temporary lake of fire (this "hell") be?\n\n    The prophet Isaiah wrote of this lake of fire prepared for the Beast: "For \nTophet (in the valley of Hinnom) is ordained of old, yea for the king it is \nprepared, he hath made it deep and large, the pile thereof is fire and wood, \nthe breath of the Lord, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it" (Isa.30:33).\n\n    One thousand years later, Satan himself will be cast into this rekindled \nfiery lake where the Beast and False Prophet were cast! (Rev.20:10).\n\n    But what of the wicked who have died over the millennia?  Does the Bible \nsay that they are now suffering fiery punishment for their sins in a lake of \nfire?\n\n    In the sequence of Rev.20 the incorrigibly wicked are resurrected to be \nthrown into the lake of fire after Satan is cast there! (Rev.20:15). What will \nbecome of these wicked?  Will they writhe in flames for eternity? \n \n    The wicked will be burned up from the intense heat of the coming Gehenna \nfire on the earth.  They wil be consumed, annihilated, destroyed!  This \npunishment will be everlasting (permanent and final).  The Bible calls it the \n"second death" (Rev.20:14; 21:8), from which there is no possibility of a \nfurther resurrection.\n\n    The Bible does teach eternal punishment, but not eternal punishing.\n                           \n    The prophet Malachi provides a graphic description. "For, behold, the day \ncometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do \nwickedly, shall be stubble, and the day that cometh shall burn them up..."\n(4:1).  To the righteous, God says that the wicked shall be "ashes under the \nsoles of your feet..."(Mal.4:3).\n\n    Gehenna was a place of destruction and death, not a place of living \ntorture!  Jesus was talking to Jews who understood all about this Gehenna or \nvalley of Hinnom.  Utter destruction by fire was complete.  Nothing was left, \nbut ashes!\n \n    Every text in the Bible translated from this Greek word Gehenna means \ncomplete destruction, not living torture (not eternal life in torment)!  The \nBible says, in Romans 6:23, "The wages of sin is death", not eternal life in \ntorture.  The punishment revealed in the Bible is Death... the cessation of \nlife.
Yes, one does.  I examined a critique of the Book of Romans by\nI think, Benjamin Franklin once, a Deist.  I found it amazing that\nBenjamin Franklin missed the whole boat.   I also have the writings\non Thomas Jefferson sitting on my shelf, and it is amazing how\nmuch he missed.  I have studied Plato's Theory of Forms and \nAristotelian Hylomorphesism.  What a pile of junk.  Jesus\nmakes Plato and Aristotle look like kindergardeners.  Psychology,\nthe id, ego, superego by Freud?  Elements of truth, but Jesus\nexplained it far better and gave reasons.\n\nThomas Paine, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson are mere men.  They\ncan screw up the Bible just as well as any man.  I do not put these\nmen on a pedestal.  And if I remember T.J.'s autobiography correctly,\nhe thought Thomas Paine was the most unread man he ever met.\n\nHere's some more circular reasoning to you.  Paul says to the Corinthians\nthat "that the gospel will be foolishness to the world, because it is \nspiritually discerned."  And so, people without the spirit of God haven't a\nclue to what the Bible is saying.   From your point of view, that's\nincredibly circular and convenient.   To me, it is mysteriously and supernaturally\nbizarre.   I can see it, but you can't.  This is not arrogance on\nmy part.  Trust me.  It is as bizarre to you as it is to me.  But nonetheless,\nit is a truth, explainable or not.\n\nAre any of you color blind to red and green?  I am.  Remember those\ndot tests they do at the optomologist's?  They put pictures in front\nof you and you are supposed to identify the pattern in the dots?  If\nyour eyes are perfectly normal, you can see letters or numerals\nembedded in the dots.  They are a slightly different color and stand\nout from the background.  But if you are color blind to red and green,\nyou will not see anything but gray-shaded dots.  That is how a dot\ntest appears to me.  I do not see a pattern at all.\n\nA normal seeing person will see the patterns.  And to him, I seem like a\ntotal anomaly.  To him, I appear as if I am missing the universe or something.\nIt is hard for him to understand why I can't see anything\nthat to him is as plain as day.\n\nThat it what it is like with the Bible, the Word of God, to the believer.\nThe believer can see the meaning in the words.  I can see how the patterns\nfit together.  There is such depth.  Such consistency.   But then, on the\nother hand, I notice the non-believer.   He doesn't see it.  He thinks\nI am weird because he thinks I am seeing things.   I look at him, and\nsay, "No, you are weird.  You do not see."   Then it is time for a sanity\ncheck.  I go to another Christian and say, "Do you see this."  And\nthey go, "Yes.  It is an "X"".  And I say, "Thank God, I see the "X"\ntoo."\n\nIt is truly the strangest thing.   It adds a little extra dimension to\nthe phrase, \n\n         "He will make the blind see, and the deaf hear."
I don't think so.  The assumption is there.  If it turns out that\ntheir software has a virus, then it is up to you to prove that fact\nto a court to get any damages.  You are theoretically suppossed to \nbe able to get damages for that, but you have to give some evidence\nthat the virus came from that software.  But since the computer\ncompany is the defendent, they are uninvolved until proven guilty.\n\nPlease, not Pascal!  NOOOOO!! ;)
I see what you are getting at (or at least I think I do).  Correct me if\nI am mistaken, but I *think* you are asking me if I still believe that we\nshould uphold all of the Laws pertaining to capital punishment for such\nthings as adultery, rape and other heinous crimes.  As you may recall,\nJesus was confronted by this same question in regards to the adultress\nwho was caught in the act and brought before Jesus.  And His reply, "Let\nhe who is without sin cast the first stone."  Jesus does not deny the\nsentence that is to due for this violation of the Law.  What do you think\nof this?\n\n\nAgreed.  :)\n \n\nAgreed also.  If one is to use the Bible as a reference, one must always be\nopen to different interpretations.  As a Christian, I have the Spirit of God\nto verify what I believe in the Word.  If what the Spirit tells me is not\nbacked up in scripture then the spirit I am communicating with is not of\nGod.  After all, Jesus tells us to "test the spirits" to know for sure that\nit is from God.\n\n\nI obey what the Spirit of God tells me to do.  The Spirit will not violate\nanything that is written in the Bible because that is the Word of God.  I do\nnot worship pastors, preachers, my wife, my mother or my father.  What they\ntell me does not carry the weight of what God tells me to do and His commands\nare rienforced in the Bible.\n \n\nEternal damnation is the consequence of the choice one makes in rejecting\nGod.  If you choose to jump off a cliff, you can hardly blame God for you \ngoing *splat* at the bottom.  He knows that if you choose to jump, that \nyou will die but He will not prevent you from making that choice.  In fact,\nHe sent His Son to stand on the edge of the cliff and tell everyone of what\nlies below.  To prove that point, Jesus took that plunge Himself but He being\nGod was able to rise up again.  I have seen the example of Christ and have \nchosen not to jump and I'm trying to tell you not to jump or else you'll \ngo *splat*.\n \nYou don't have to listen to me and I won't stop you if you decide to jump.\nI only ask that you check it out before taking the plunge.  You owe it to\nyourself.  I don't like seeing anyone go *splat*.\n\nGod be with you,
You said everyone in the world.  That means *everyone* in the world, including\nchildren that are not old enough to speak, let alone tell lies.  If Jesus\nsays "everyone", you cannot support that by referring to a group of people\nsomewhat smaller than "everyone".\n--\n"On the first day after Christmas my truelove served to me...

Surely you are not equating David Koresh with Christianity? The two are\n   not comparable.
-*----\n\n\nNo.  It follows from the fact that most Christians' choice of\ninterpretation stems from a mix of beliefs that are influenced by\nthe secular ethics of their culture and that are not fully\ndetermined by scripture.  Whether or not there is some "right"\ninterpretation matters not; few Christians claim the ability to\nread the mind of their god.  Dave Davis should note that it was\nMichael who first stated the importance of secular and cultural\ninfluence in this thread.  I think Michael is right in this, but\nregardless, it should be noted that this has *not* been a point\nof contention between Michael and myself. \n\nI have argued -- beyond Michael's claims -- that the Christian\nscriptures are open to so many interpretations -- including a\nwide divergence within the Christian tradition -- that even their\nmost important themes are vague.  Again, it does not matter that\nthere is some "right" interpretation *unless* there is a way to\ndetermine what that "right" interpretation is.  It is the lack of\nan objective measure, not the presumed lack of an answer, that\nputs the force behind the line I argue.\n\n\nThere are enough Christian glasses, varying over a sufficiently\nbroad range of color, that I can find a few that support my\nexample. \n\n\n\nIn my opinion, what makes Michael radical is that he fully\nacknowledges that Christian scripture and tradition fail to\ndetermine the doctrines that so many branches within Christianity\nhold dear.  He is willing to live and practice his religion\nwithin this indeterminacy, and he is willing to acknowledge that\nmuch of his understanding of things Christian is influenced by\nideas that are not purely Christian.  Those Christians I have\ncalled conservative must also interpret, but they do not\nrecognize -- or at least, are unwilling to admit -- the extent and\nimportance of this.\n\n\nI recognize that Michael is part of the tradition.  But what does\nit tell one about a tradition covering Origen, Aquinas, Jerry\nFallwell, and Jesse Jackson that it also includes Michael Siemon?\nNot very much!\n\n\n\nI think the conclusion does follow.  The purely Christian\nprinciples that Michael has are the ones he shares with others in\nthe Christian tradition or that can be derived from Christian\nscripture.  These, necessarily vague, are not enough to drive his\npolitical stances.  That one should love one's neighbor is a \npurely Christian principle.  That this means showing tolerance \nfor homosexuality is *not*.\n\nAs to these political stances, they are often at odds with what\nis commonly held in most of current Christendom, and so I \nsuspect they could be better pressed outside it.  (On the other\nhand, I can well understand the counterpoint, that these \npolitical stances become most influential when presented to \nthose who need them most.)\n\n-*----\n\nHaving barely survived the effort to finish in computer science, I\ndoubt I will attempt a more difficult field any time soon!

If you would like to understand better the sort of behavior\nthat we saw in connection with the Waco tragedy, I'd strongly\nrecommend reading _When Prophecy Fails_, by Leon Festinger,\nHenry Riecken, and Stanley Schachter (available as a Harper\nTorchbook). It goes a long way towards explaining how a \nbelief system can be so strong as to withstand even overwhelming\ndisconfirmatory evidence. At least, read the first chapter.\nInterestingly, just as the Branch Davidians had roots in the\nSeventh-Day Adventist movement, the SDAs themselves had their\nroots in the Millerite movement of the first half of the 19th\ncentury--a movement that expected the end of the world in 1843,\nwas disappointed when it did not take place, and wound up as\na church.\n\nBill
An extremely good example of "circumstantial evidence!"\nEvery time these right-wing control-freaks start spouting\nabout prayer in schools, I get this nagging commentary\nfrom the Sermon on the Mount [Matt: 6:5-6] "And when you\npray, do not imitate the hypocrites: they love to say their\nprayers standing up in the synagogues and at the street\ncorners for people to see them.  I tell you solemnly, they\nhave had their reward.  But when you pray, go to your\nprivate room and, when you have shut your door, pray to\nyour Father who is in that secret place."\n\nBut no.

Question for those of you who seem to be fundamentalists (Stephen\nTice, the Cotera, Joe Gaut, et al)(apologies if I've mislabelled any\nof you, I've only started reading t.r.m since the BD disaster.  But I\nknow the Cotera is a fundy) and are defending Koresh and his beliefs\nas an example of True Christianity under persecution from the the Big\nBad Secular State: what is your opinion of his reported sexual habits?\nIf the reports are accurate, what IYO does this say about the quality of\nhis Christianity?  Or are the allegations just part of the Big\nCover-Up?\n\n(I remain deliberately neutral on the cause of the fire: I wouldn't\nput it past Koresh to have torched the place himself.  On the other\nhand, if the propane-tank-accident story is correct, I wouldn't put it\npast the FBI to try to cover its ass by claiming Koresh did it.  I\nhope your government does a VERY thorough investigation of the whole\ndebacle, and I'll be disappointed if a few heads don't roll.  The\nauthorities seem to have botched the original raid, and in the matter\nof the fire, are guilty of either serious misjudgement, or reckless\nendangerment.)
Yes, as a philosophy weak atheism is worthless.  This is true in\nexactly the same sense that as a philosophy Christians' disbelief in\nZeus is worthless.  Atheists construct their personal philosophies\nfrom many different sources, building non-god-based ideas in the same\nway as Christians build non-Zeus-based ideas of thunderbolts.\nAtheists no more *base* their philosophy on atheism than Christians\nbase theirs on the nonexistence of Zeus.\n\nThe "weak atheist" position is logically extremely assailable -- any\nlogical demonstration of the existence of a god completely destroys it\nas soon as the demonstration is made in the presence of a given weak\natheist.  Atheists in this newsgroup are barraged regularly with\nattempts to provide such a logical demonstration, and they all fail\nmiserably.  In fact, most of the people around here who claim the\n"strong (as opposed to mathematical) atheist" position do so on this\nbasis: not only do we not believe in a god, but also all the arguments\npresented in favor of particular gods have to date proven unsound;\ntherefore, one can say that those gods as argued by those arguments do\nnot exist.  This doesn't apply to such philosophers' gods as are\ndefined to be logically undemonstrable, but these are not the gods of\npopular religion, and the coherence of such claims is quite\nquestionable.
That's right.  Everyone.  Even infants who cannot speak as yet.  Even\na little child will rebelliously stick his finger in a light socket.\nEven a little child will not want his diaper changed.  Even a little\nchild will fight nap-time.\n\nSo far as Jesus saying "everyone":  \n\n    A certain ruler asked Jesus, "Good teacher, what must I do to\n    inherit eternal life?"\n\n    "Why do you call me good?"  Jesus answered.  "No one is good--\n    except God alone."\n\nKen, the book of Romans states that we are born sinners.  We do\nnot grow into being a sinner.  We sin because we are sinners.  The\ncommon mistake, even in Christian circles, is to think the reverse\ntrue.    So for as surely as you grew to look like you parents,\nyou not only inherited their appearance, but also their sin nature.\nIt goes with being human.

If the children are not being fed, whose fault is that?  You and I\nhave plenty of food on our tables while others starve.  Why is that?\nGod gave us this earth to manage.

The only consolation I have for those suffering\nchildren is that they will be received into the kingdom of Heaven\nwhere they will never thirst and never hunger again.\n\nPeace be with you,\n\nMalcolm Lee  :)

A "moment of silence" doesn't mean much unless *everyone*\nparticipates.  Otherwise it's not silent, now is it?\n\nNon-religious reasons for having a "moment of silence" for a dead\nclassmate: (1) to comfort the friends by showing respect to the\ndeceased , (2) to give the classmates a moment to grieve together, (3)\nto give the friends a moment to remember their classmate *in the\ncontext of the school*, (4) to deal with the fact that the classmate\nis gone so that it's not disruptive later.\n\nBlindly opposing everything with a flavor of religion in it is\nutterly idiotic.
I can certainly see opposing the "Amen" -- but that doesn't require \nopposing a moment of silence.\n\n\nDoes anybody else besides me see a vicious circle here?

That is indeed the present consensus.  Contrary to what Dr. Fox has\nbeen saying, however, present consensus is *not* that the longer\npassage in Josephus about Jesus was inserted, but only that it was\nmodified.\n   There is no question that it was *at least* modified (based on what\nOrigen says--that Josephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah), but\nI don't think the argument that it appears "out of context" is a very\ngood one.  (I haven't looked at the context for a while; perhaps somebody\ncould give some of the sentences which precede and follow the Jesus\npassage.)

.\n        It should be remembered that all of the first reports came from \n       the FBI, and that independent observers, i.e. the press, were not \n       allowed to get close and see things for themselves.  Official \n       communiques tend to be self-serving for the agencies that issue \n       them. \n        People in general tend to believe first reports, as these get \n       the most and the biggest headlines.  Corrections are often \n       overlooked. \n         An example is the FBI report that several of the bodies found \n       in the rubble had bullet wounds.  The local coroner, who is \n       independent of the FBI, has so far found no bullet wounds!
930425\n\n\nLet's start with the name "Rosicrucian". I took me a long time to come\nto the conclusion that there is a difference between a *member* of a\n"rosicrucian" body and BEING *a* ROSICRUCIAN. So when you say that you met\nsome 'rosicrucians' you mean "members of a group that calls themselves\nrosicrucian". At least that is what your observation suggests :-)\n\n\nResponse:\n\nThis makes much sense to me.  This is also true of most religions.\nThere is a difference between being a *member* of a group of people\nwho call themselves 'Hindus' or 'Christians' or 'Pagans' and actually\n*BEING* any of these.  The social groups tend to make very important\nrequirements about not belonging to other 'religions'.  I find that\nthe ideal described by the holy texts of most religions can be\ninterpreted in very similar ways so that one could presume that\n'mysticism' is the core of every religion and Huxley's 'Perennial\nPhilosophy' is the Great Secret Core of all mystical trads. :>\n\n\nTony:\n\nI'd prefer if you would have stated up front that it was the Lectorium\nRosicrucianum, only because they may be confused, by some readers of this\nnewsgroup, with the Rosicrucian Order AMORC based (the USA Jurisdiction) in\nSan Jose, CA; this being the RC org with the most members (last time I\nlooked). Of course, "most members" does not *necessarily* mean "best".\n\n\nResponse:\n\nCertainly true.  I didn't know there WERE any groups which called themselves\n'Rosicrucians' that didn't associate with AMORC.  Sure, I've heard all the\nhubbub about the Golden Dawn and Rosae Crucis in relation to all these\nWestern esoteric groups, but hadn't heard about other 'Rosicrucians'.\nI'll admit my bias.  I live in San Jose. :>\n\n\nTony:\n\n"You'll have to trust me" when I tell you that if that\nlecture/class/whatever had been presented by AMORC, it is unlikely that you\nwould have had the same impression, i.e., you'd probably have had a\npositive impression more likely than a negative one, IMHO. \n\n\nResponse:\n\nThis may be slightly off.  I've met some of these Rosicrucians and have\na couple friends in AMORC.  The stories I've heard and the slight contact\nI've had with them does not give me the hope that I'd be received with\nany kind of warm welcome.  I still like to think that most people who\nare involved with stratified relationships (monogamy, religion, etc.)\nare in DEEP pain and hope to heal it within such a 'cast'.\n\n\nTony:\n\n     \nIt is curious to know that 3 other RC 'orders' (in the USA) claim to be *non-\nsectarian*.\n\n\nResponse:\n\nI'd like to know at least the addresses of the 'other orders' which call \nthemselves 'Rosicrucians' and especially those which are 'nonsectarian'.\nIs this 'nonsectarian' like the Masons, who require that a member 'believe\nin God by his/her definition'?\n\n     \n     \nTony:\n\nI don't see nothing *fundamentally* wrong with "us containing\nsomething divine"... And yes I don't like phrases like "eternal bliss"\neither! :-)\n\n\nResponse:\n\nLet alone us *BEING* something divine. ;>\n\n\nTony:\n\nBTW, I have read the intro letters of the LRC which they will mail you free\nof charge.\n\n\nResponse:\n\nAddresses, phone numbers of groups?  I'm into networking.  Thanks.

Can a theist be truly objective?  Can he be impartial\n     when questioning the truth of his scriptures, or\n     will he assume the superstition of his parents\n     when questioning? \n\nI've often found it to be the case that the theist\n     will stick to some kind of superstition when\n     wondering about God and his scriptures.  I've\n     seen it in the Christian, the Jew, the Muslim,\n     and the other theists alike.  All assume that\n     their mothers and fathers were right in the\n     aspect that a god exists, and with that belief\n     search for their god.\n     \nOccasionally, the theist may switch religions or\n     aspects of the same religion, but overall the\n     majority keep to the belief that some "Creator"\n     was behind the universe's existence.  I've\n     known Muslims who were once Christians and vice\n     versa, I've known Christians who were once\n     Jewish and vice versa, and I've even known\n     Christians who become Hindu.  Yet, throughout\n     their transition from one faith to another,\n     they've kept this belief in some form of higher\n     "being."  Why?\n     \nIt usually all has to do with how the child is\n     brought up.  From the time he is born, the\n     theist is brought up with the notion of the\n     "truth" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,\n     the Torah, the Qur'an, & etc.  He is told\n     of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)\n     the scripture, of the prophets talked about in\n     the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.\n     He is also told that to question this (as\n     children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime\n     against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-\n     ture's truth is to damn one's soul to Hell.\n     Thus, by the time he is able to read the\n     scripture for himself, the belief in its "truth"\n     is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a\n     matter of course.\n     \nBut it doesn't stop there.  Once the child is able\n     to read for himself, there is an endeavor to\n     inculcate the child the "right" readings of\n     scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant\n     readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to\n     explain away the unexplainable with "mystery."\n     Circular arguments, "self-evdent" facts and\n     "truths," unreasoning belief, and fear of\n     hell is the meat of religion the child must eat\n     of every day.  To doubt, of course, means wrath\n     of some sort, and the child must learn to put\n     away his brain when the matter concerns God.\n     All of this has some considerable effect on the\n     child, so that when he becomes an adult, the \n     superstitions he's been taught are nearly\n     impossible to remove.\n     \nAll of this leads me to ask whether the theist can\n     truly be objective when questioning God, Hell,\n     Heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest.\n     Can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that\n     God *does* exist and look at everything from\n     a unbiased point of view?  Obviously, most\n     theists can somewhat, especially when presented\n     with "mythical gods" (Homeric, Roman, Egyptian,\n     & etc.).  But can they put aside the assumption\n     of God's existence and question it impartially?\n     \nStephen\n\n    _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/       _/    * Atheist\n   _/        _/    _/   _/ _/ _/ _/     * Libertarian\n  _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/   _/  _/      * Pro-individuality\n       _/  _/     _/  _/       _/       * Pro-responsibility\n_/_/_/_/  _/      _/ _/       _/ Jr.    * and all that jazz...

We have reached the point in our society when there are certain crimes\nthat are so heinous that to merely be accused with them one is automaticly\nconsidered guilty and deemed not to have any natural rights much less civil \nrights. Among these are drug abuse, sexual perversion, and political \nincorrectness.\nToday Billary accused Koresh of having SEX with infants. He had been accused of\na number of differing crimes (inconsistantly) over the last two months, but \nthis is the first time I have heard that one. I had heard child abuse but\nthis is somewhat stronger.\nIt is fairly obvious that Koresh  was hiding behind the children; and ironicly\nconsidering his apocalyptic dread, believed enough in the American People's\ninherent goodness to believe he was protected.\nIt is truly amazing that all these people who 60 days ago had never heard of \nthe Branch Davidian now believe that he was suicidal, crazy, a child abuser and \na immenant danger to others based solely on what the Government spokespersons\nhad said. Remember that these people have an awful lot to loose if it is found\nthat they have screwed up. \nBut they don't have as much to lose as David Koresh and his followers lost.\nFor in our society as it stands murder is not one of the heinous crimes.
Brian Kendig also declares:\n\n\n"Christ" is Greek for "Messiah".  "Messiah" means "Annointed One".\n"Annoint" means "to rub with oil, i.e. to anoint; by impl. to\nconsecrate"     The major prophet Daniel uses the word "Messiah"\nin Daniel chapter 9.
["it" is Big Bang]\n\nSince you asked... from the Big Bang to the formation of atoms is about\n10E11 seconds. As for the "color": bright. Very very bright. \n\n\nI don't. I believe the current theory of cosmology because it is fairly\nwell supported by observational evidence (not as well supported as, say\nevolution or relativity, but that's another matter). You're the one who\nproposes unquestioningly accepting religious dogma as fact (apologies if\nyou're not actually a creationist).\n\n\nThe line is broader than you think. Theories are supported by evidence.\nMiracles are supported by someone's say-so.
I use it to refer to those Christians who take a more\nconservative-literalist approach to the Bible, as distinct from\n"liberals".\n\n\nI would use the word "Christian" (unqualified) to describe someone to\nwhom the above definition applied.  BTW, it applies to me.\n\n[deletia: Joe Gaut indicates his interest in the BD disaster is from a\ncivil liberties issue, not an attempt to justify Koresh's beliefs\nand/or practices.]\n\nI agree with Joe about this: if some group wants to believe in\nwhatever god or Invisible Pink Unicorns and go off and live together\nand have group sex, or no sex, or sex only for the leaders (but NOT\nwith children), then, as much as I might believe them to be misguided,\nI think they should have the legal right.  And I hope the\ninvestigation will start by determining whether the feds had any\n*legitimate* reason for going after Koresh in the first place (before\nmoving on to consider the wisdom of various tactics used).\n\n[Joe goes on to dispute the child-abuse allegations.  I'll\n(provisionally) accept this, unless someone has evidence to support\nthe allegations?]\n\nActually I wasn't thinking about the (alleged) child abuse, but about\nthe reports that he had sex with, and fathered children by, several\nwomen in the cult.  I agree this is not a legal matter - consenting\nadults and all that - but Stephen Tice seems to be defending Koresh's\nbeliefs and practices from specifically *Christian* perspective, not a\ncivil liberties perspective.  \n\nI think my question is not really aimed at Joe (and possibly not at\nRay Cote either, who seems to also be taking the political angle), but\nat Stephen Tice.
If what was being discussed could be established or disproven by \nexperiment and observation, then I would agree with you, Chris.  \nThe burden of proof would belong to Bill. But the source\ndocument for Christianity, the Bible, simply assumes God exists\nand makes it clear (to us Calvinists, anyway :-)) that when a person\nis in fellowship with God, it is because God has taken the initiative\nin revealing Himself to that person. So from a Christian point of\nview, the burden of proof belongs to God. Bill is being consistent\nwith what the Bible teaches in relating his own experience with God,\nbut it would be an error on his part to assume that there is a direct,\ncausal relationship between his testimony and someone else becoming\nconvinced that God exists and that he needs to be reconciled to God.\n\n\nPlease excuse me if I missed an earlier part of this thread\nin which Bill came across like an egotist. What I saw was simply\nobedience to the scriptural command to "always be ready\nto give a reason for the joy that is in you".
This is always an option: when the sect is causing harm, re-label\nthe cult to something else.\n\nCheers,\nKent
Here is someones "biblical" claim for the characteristics of Satan:\n\n\nAnd separately:\n\n\nWe have here three distinct claims concerning the results of the devil's\ndecision making, a specific desire, and a physical description.  Now, in\nsupport (aside from the minor detail that an author seldom writes an unbiased\naccount of the opposition) we see:\n\n\nISA 14:12  How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the\nmorning!  how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken\nthe nations!\n\nISA 14:13  For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend  into\n                                              --------------------\nheaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit\n-----------------------------------------------------\nalso upon the mount of the congregation,  in  the  sides  of the north:\n\nISA 14:14  I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I  will\nbe like the most High.\n\nISA 14:15  Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to  the  sides\nof the pit.\n\n\nDoesn't say sits on God's throne.

Brian, does all this mean that you have to be well versed in ancient\nGreek, Hebrew and Aramaic in order to understand the core of\nChristianity? I hope you are not Catholic, because my Christian\nupbringing was based on the teachings of Luther, and the one of\nthe core messages was basically that you don't need to know latin\nin order to learn about salvation.\n\nBTW, your statement would also eliminate about 99.5% of all the Christians\nin the world, as well.\n\nCheers,\nKent
Uh oh, Michael; you typed "hell" and capitalized it to boot! Now\nPeter Nyikos will explain that you're not a real Christian!\n\n\n\n\nBZZT!

Hmm.  The police strategy of bursting in with weapons drawn, clearly marked as\nofficers and yelling "Police" repeatedly.  This is used every day to bust drug\nhouses.  The idea is to awe the suspects into submission with surprise and\ndisplay of firepowere in order to avoid a gun fight.  As for not knocking, it's\na sad necessity in many cases since the suspects will attempt to escape or even\nfight.  Usually this strategy works; if it didn't, then it wouldn't be used so\ncommonly, now would it?\n\nWhether or not it was appropriate to use this strategy on the BD is not my\npoint, since I don't think any of us have enough information to make a clear\njudgement on this issue.\n\nI merely point out that it IS a valid strategy which is used every day.\nFurthermore, we don't know of any substitute strategy capable of apprehending\npotentially dangerous and armed suspects.  Do you suggest that the police\nalways knock with guns holstered and never arrest any suspects until they have\nbeen allowed to inspect the officers's badges?  Just what should the police do\nwhen apprehending potentially dangerous and armed suspects?  How far can they\nreasonably go to identiy themselves?  What do you suggest they can do which\ncan't be faked by the "competition"?\n\nEven if you've got deadly enemies who may pretend to be cops, that's not an\nexcuse to murder police.  In the case of the BD's, there was almost definitely\nat most the paranoid delusion of deadly enimies who would pretend to be cops.
The remainder of my article deleted stated why. One would be an egotist to\nbelieve that someone CARED about what Bill R. thought he needed\nto say about God. Whether they did or not is irrelevant.
...in other words faith in a .357 is far stronger than faith in a \nGod providing a miracle for his followers. Interesting. Now, if \nDavid Korresh was God, why couldn't he use lightning instead of \nsemi-automatic rifles? It seems even he didn't trust in himself.\n\nCheers,\nKent

No.\n\n\nNo. The library at Alexandria was perhaps the greatest library ever\nbuilt in the world. The Greeks had a love of wisdom, philo sophos, and\nthis great love was reflected in the Alexandrian library. The Christians \ngot a hold of it and began modifying and purging texts and then the Moslems \ninvaded and either the Christians burned the library to keep it from falling \ninto Moslems hands (far more likely since they were the book burners, not the \nMoslems), or it burned in the sack of the city or the Moslems burned it. \nEither way, a tremendous amount of information was lost. The destruction of the\nlibrary of Alexandria was probably one of the greatest crimes of man\nagainst man.\n\n\nActually, the Hebrew almah, (young woman), was translated as the Hellenistic \nGreek parthenos which may or may not be correctly translated into the\nmodern and technical English term virgin. The Jews did not have the type\nof virginity cult that the Greco-Romans had in Artemis and Diana.\n\n\nThe standard text used by Christians and Jews is the Masoretic Text.\nJews of course use the text in its original Hebrew, without translation.\n\n\nPropaganda.
Hmm, it seems that this is the core of Christianity then, you \nhave to feel guilty, and then there's this single personality\nthat will save you from this universal guilt feeling.\n\nBrian, I will tell you a secret, I don't feel guilty at all,\nI do mistakes, and I regret them, however I've never had this\nhuge guilt feeling hanging over my shoulder.\n\nIf things happen wrong, I will try to learn from the mistakes\nand go on.\n\nThis all is a very clear indication that you need a certain\npersonality type in order to believe and adjust to certain\nreligious doctrines. And if your personality type is \nopposite, then you are not that easily attached to a certain\nworld view system.\n\n\nAll I know is that I don't know everything. And frankly speaking\nI don't care, life is fun anyway. I recognize that I'm not \nperfect, but that does not hinder me from have a healthy\nand inspiring life.\n\nThere are humans that subscribe to the same notion. The nice\nthing is that when you finally shake off this huge burden,\nthe shoulders feel far more relaxed!\n\nCheers,\nKent
First and foremost, I honestly do not believe that Jesus was anything\nmore than a man who lived and died two thousand years ago.  I know\nyour Bible provides wonderful stories of the things he said and did,\nbut I simply do not believe that he still exists as an entity that has\nany bearing on this universe or the lives in it, and I similarly do\nnot believe that the god that you worship exists or has ever existed.\n\nPeriod.\n\nI view religion in general and Christianity in specific as a 'cultural\nvirus' that has been passed down from generation to generation because\npeople are often too afraid to think for themselves and claim\nresponsibility for their own fate, so they brainwash themselves and\ntheir children into believing the popular myths, and it goes on from\nthere.  And eventually Christianity becomes a given -- if so many\nother people believe in it, it must be right, no?\n\nI don't believe in any "life after death".  I believe that when I die,\nI die, so therefore it's up to me to try to bring meaning and purpose\nto my life in the meantime.  I don't believe that it's a good thing to\nhumble myself and view pride as a sin -- pride, in moderation, is a\nconstructive thing.  I see nothing at all wrong with homosexuality and\nnothing inferior about women, and my priests lost a lot of my trust\nwhen they patronizingly tried to explain the 'faults' of these\nopinions to me.  I don't believe in 'loving everyone', especially\npeople I've never met; while I try to show respect to everyone, my\nlove and admiration is something not easily earned, and I do not feel\nguilty about denying my respect and consideration to someone who has\nabused it.\n\nIf you want me to take your religion the least bit seriously, stop\ntrying to show me how the Bible "makes sense".  Start trying to show\nme that this Jesus person is somehow still influencing anyone's life\nhere on Earth.

The whole point is, maybe everyone _doesn't want_ to participate.\n\n[...]\n\nBlindly opposing everything with a flavor of religion in it that is\nsupported by taxpayer money is the only way to keep christianity from\nbecoming the official U.S. religion.\n\nNot noticing that danger is utterly idiotic.
The point about its being real or not is that one does not waste time with\nwhat reality might be when one wants predictions.

930425 \n\n\nRome was under attack by barbarians, they sent for advice to some Oracle,\nand she said Worship Cybele and you'll be saved.

Thanks for the etymology lesson, but I actually know what "orthodox" means.\nYou're avoiding my question, however, which was: From what body of theology\ndoes your version of orthodoxy come?  You seem to simply be saying that\nwhatever *you* understand the Bible to say is "orthodox."\n\n\n  You are obviously mistaken, since many, many people have read the Bible and\nmany do not agree with you on this point.  Once again, Robert, is your\ninterpretation the only "correct" or "orthodox" one?\n\n\n\n   This whole string began as a response to your attacks on Mormonism; no one\nis attacking your personal beliefs, only your tendency to present them as\n"orthodoxy."  I don't much care *what* you believe about the Bible; just don't\npresent you personal understanding as the only "orthodox" one.\n\n\n   I have never attacked your specific beliefs -- that's *your* approach,\nremember?\n    Stating that other people who depend solely on the Bible have other views\nis indeed proof that the Bible can be interpreted many ways, which has been\nmy whole point all along.  The specifics of your belief are your business;\njust don't pretend that they are anything more than your personal\nintepretation, and be careful about crying "heresy" based on your private\nbelief system.
Special creation has not been observed in action. Bill Rawlin's\nassertions that man was created in his present form do not count \nas creation. Put another way, there are an incredible amount of\nspecies of the planet. How many species have we DIRECTLY observed\nbeing created by a god or gods?
God never changes.  He still loves us.  Sending Jesus was one of His\nattempts to reconcile with mankind.  The nature of God has not changed.\n\n\nSinning in the face of God was punishable by immediate death.  There are\nseveral OT passages to back this up.  God is God.  He cannot tolerate\nthe prescence of sin in His midst.  And the Israelites knew this!  And\nstill, some of them chose to disobey and were destroyed.  Were these\npeople KIND and LOVing themselves?  God gave them every break He could\nbut in the end, He really had no choice in the matter.  Seeing as how\nwe were failing to achieve salvation on our own, He sent His Son to die\nfor us - to be the ultimate sin offering.  Now we live in the age of\ngrace.\n\n\n\nHe sent His Son as a consolation to us, out of love.\n \n\nHey, let's be fair for a moment here.  KIND and LOVING does not mean\na free ride.  There is an amount of give and take as in any relationship.\nParents are supposed to be kind and loving but does that mean that \nchildren can do whatever they want?  NOT!  Part of being a parent means\nadministering punishment when the child is at fault.  Part of being a \nparent means giving instruction.  God tests us through the trial of\nlife such that we may grow stronger.  He teaches what is right and \nwhat is wrong.  The consequences of our actions are made clear to us,\nbe it Heaven or be it Hell.  If God did not follow through with what\nHe has warned us about, He would not be a very good parent.\n\nIn parenting, if a parent issues a warning but does not follow through\nwith it, the children will not take that parent's words very seriously.\nGod does the same by telling us who have ears to hear what to do and\nwhat not to do.  By life's trials, we see the folly of doing our own\nwill rather than His.  He warns us about the consequences of rejecting\nHim when it comes time for Judgement.  Do we follow Him?\n\nI will.\n\nPeace be with you,\n\nMalcolm Lee  :)

Forcing\nher to carry a pregnancy to term at a critical time in her life could prevent\nher from being a productive member of society.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOk, look.  It's like this.  We *are* footing the bill.  Maybe they will\ntake choice A.  Maybe they will take choice B.  Maybe they will take choice\nC.  They can't afford any *one* of them.  If they take choice A we'd have\nto pay them, say $5.  If they take choice B it would cost us $20.  If they\ntake choice C it will cost us $20 now and a hell of a lot more for the next\n18 years.  Which one sounds the most realistic for us to be willing to pay\nfor?  Now some people happen not to like choice A.  Other people happen\nnot to like choice C (paying for it, that is).  C has been around and paid\nfor for years.  Even though it means we spend a lot of money, we can't in\nconscience refuse to pay for it.  Now A has been around and is perfectly\nlegal, but it hasn't been funded in the past.  Now A is going to be funded\nbut some people object.  They don't like the idea of their tax money going\nto pay for choice A.  So we could refuse to fund A at all.  Then those\nwomen who can't afford any of those choices will be forced to take choice\nB or C, which will cost *all of us* more money.  Most of us don't see any\nreason at all why *more money* should be spent to the effect of *removing\npersonal choice* from some women.  The alternative is to fund A if that is\nwhat the mother chooses.  We will also still fund B and even C if *that*\nis what the mother chooses.  However, some women will certainly choose A,\nand that will then save us $15 we otherwise would have had to spend.  Your\n"taxes" are not being raised to fund a choice you object, they are being\n*lowered* because we will fund a choice that is *legal*, despite your\nobjections to it.  (Actually, your taxes are not really going to go down,\nas I'm sure you would point out.  But the amount that is saved in that\narea can help out in another--like our massive debt.)\n\n\n\n\n\nThose other procedures you mention only cost money.  There is no savings\nin other procedures that would be required down the road without them.\n(In fact, there could be additional costs down the road *because* of them.)\nThis is quite different from the case of abortion.\n\n\nThis is bullshit.  We are *not* refusing "to make the alternative affordable\ntoo".  If we refused to pay for the more expensive choice of birth, *then*\nyour statement would make sense.  But that is not the case, so it doesn't.\nIf Clinton tried to block funding for pre-natal care and delivery (or left\nit out of his health-care plan), I would certainly object.  I would also be\nquite surprised.\n\n\n\nYes, but probably not your definition of it, or for the reasons you think.\n\n\nYOU STUPID FUCK!  *WE DO* want to fund *all* the choices.  *YOU* are the\none who wants to *NOT* fund all the choices.\n\n\nYour humble opinion is still wrong.  Even with easy adoption, there is still\nthe fact that pregnancy takes several months.  Months in which a young woman\ncould need to be getting an education.  (like finishing High School, entering\ncollege, finishing college, getting a job...things that are much harder to\ndo if you have to "take a break" for a few months...things that have a massive\nimpact on her future productivity.)\n\n\n\n\nYou *can* have a conversation with the "mentally incompetant".  And even\nthough *you* personally may refuse to have a conversation with "people\nyou just don't like", it is still *possible* for others to have a conversation\nwith them.  It is *not* possible for *anyone* to have a conversation with\na fetus.\n\n\n\nHe was still biologically independent.  At least to the same extent you are\nnow.  He consumed nutrients and digested them in the normal manner.  He\nbreathed his own air.  A fetus on the other hand, gets it's nutrients already\ndigested by the mother.  It gets its oxygen from the mother as well.  That\nis not biologically independent.\n\n\n\nAwareness is only *part* of what makes a "member of society".  It is the\nminimal conceivable requirement, yet many people seem to think that something\nwithout awareness could still be important enough to justify the suffereing\nof a true member of society.  I keep asking, but I still haven't seen a real\njustification for why the life of a non-sentient creature should be worth the\nsuffering of a sentient being.  (I haven't read every response on the threads\nI've been asking on, yet, so we'll see if I see one later.)\n\n\n\nAnyone who can program in UNIX has a lot of experiences in the real world.
Yes, that's exactly what I felt.  My heart just felt that what I was\nbeing taught was *wrong* -- a basically good message, but framed in\nerrors.  I could not with a clear conscience accept that women were\nsomehow not equal to men, that homosexuals are "guilty" of their\nlifestyle, that pride in one's work is a bad thing, that Jesus died\nfor me -- I don't want ANYBODY to die for me, especially as an\nimpersonal act where the person can't possibly even *know* me well\nenough to really know if I'm worth dying for or not.\n\nI was never able to accept the bit about Jesus's death being a good\nthing.  If that means that I'm just not comprehending a basic message\nof Christianity, then so be it.  Maybe I'm just not compatible with\nChristianity.  I just refuse to follow rules blindly, and since I\ncan't even convince myself that your god even EXISTS in the way you\ndescribe it, I've got to just follow my own conscience in these matters.\n\n\nDon't think that my morals are shoddy or nonexistent just because I\ndon't believe in your god.  I will not steal, and I will not murder --\nnot because I fear divine repudiation, but because these just *aren't*\nin my character.  You may think there's nothing keeping me from just\nrunning around on a murdering spree, stealing things when I'm able,\ninsulting people for the heck of it, because I'm not answerable to\nanyone; but you'd be wrong.  I'm answerable to myself.  A life like\nthat would be a cheap life; I happen to want to earn respect in myself.\n\n\nMy initial break with Christianity came after a lot of soul-searching\nand a lot of wondering why I could no longer feel the 'presence' of\nGod with me.  I finally decided that I had once "felt" this presence\njust as I had "felt" my mighty teddy bear beside me when I was a\nlittle tyke, protecting me from the monsters under the bed -- that I\nhad believed in God just as I had believed in the teddy bear, as\nsomething of an emotional crutch to protect me from perceived dangers.\n\nSince then, I've never abandoned the possibility that maybe your\nsupernatural trinity does exist.  But there are a few times when, in\nmy darkened room by my bed, I have set aside everything I believe for\na moment and called out to whatever's out there, because I want to\nknow the truth even if it means abandoning everything I know.  And I\nhave not yet received an answer.\n\n\nNope.  It may well be unknowable.  Scientists have suggested that the\nuniverse may be finite and wrap around on itself (the three-dimensional\nuniverse may be mapped onto a four-dimensional supersphere in the same\nway you can map a two-dimensional plane onto a three-dimensional\nsphere; see _Sphereland_, the sequel to _Flatland_, for more thoughts\non this).  Our entire universe might just be an electron in a four-\ndimensional universe, which in turn may only be an insignificant speck\nin a universe above that, and so on and so forth until the variables\nbecome too much for us to even speculate on.\n\nThat is, there's no possible way for us to know exactly how we came to\nbe, so there's no reason at all to believe that your God exists nor\nhad anything to do with it.\n\n\nChristians have provided me with nothing except quotes from your holy\nbook, and all sorts of tactics to try to get me to believe: guilt\ntrips, insinuations that I'm without morals, arguments from disbelief\n("how can you possibly believe that God *doesn't* exist?"), and so\nforth.  All I'm asking is for you to convince me.  I want to be convinced,\nbut it's not going to be easy.\n\n\nHaving had years upon years of contact with your religion from both\nthe inside and the outside, I view it as harmful in many ways.  It\npreys on people who want to find meaning in their lives, and once it's\ngot these people, it teaches them to have pity (and sometimes starkly\nintolerant) of others who do not share these views.  Maybe you'll say\nthat your religion doesn't teach that -- but I've got to judge\nChristianity from the Christians I know.\n\nI feel that it is entirely possible and good to have faith in one's\nself, and to be a positive influence on society for no better reason\nthan that.\n\nSo I hope that my words in this newsgroup will at least make some\npeople think.  I want Christians to realize that there are perfectly\nvalid lifestyles and opinions that have nothing to do with their deity\nwhatsoever, and I want people who are considering Christianity to\nrealize that Christianity does not hold the sole key to a happy,\nfulfilled life.\n\nI have known some very nice Christians who have done some very nice\nthings.  I think what sets these people apart from the general masses\nis that they recognize that their religious beliefs may be wrong, and\nthey know the weaknesses of their religion, yet they still decide to\nbelieve, but they keep their beliefs to themselves and do not think\nany less of people who don't agree with them.\n\n\nPrecisely my point.  You've still not given me a reason to be a\nChristian instead of a Buddhist or a Moslem...\n\n\n... just as the Moslems aren't religious, and the Buddhists aren't\nreligious.  Who *is* religious, then?
You just don't get it, do you?\n\n\nI think the discussion is more like this...\n\nMe: [ happily picking daisies by the side of the road ]\nBC: [ dancing on the double yellow broken line ]\n    "Come on out and play on the highway!"\nMe: "Why?"\nBC: "The highway was put here for people to be on.

You'll get yourself killed!"\nBC: "Better to be killed on the highway than to live an empty life off\n     of it.  Besides, you're just asking pointless questions.  You know\n     you really want to be playing on the highway too; you're just\n     denying it."\nMe: "If you want to get run over, then fine, but I'd much rather enjoy\n     the daisies, if you please."\nBC: "Why do you shun me like this?  The Creator of the Highway will flatten\n     you with a steamroller if you don't see the light and come join me!"\nMe: "Well, if he's gonna be THAT way about it, maybe I want to get as\n     far from the highway as I can..."\nBC: [ incoherent but quite familiar righteous sputtering ]\n\nBrian C., don't you see?  I do not believe that your god is:\n\n	(a) real, or even\n\n	(b) beneficial.\n\nIn fact, I believe your religion is imaginary and, carried to\nextremes, harmful.  I would like to help you see its shortcomings, and\nperhaps someday finally become strong enough to see it for what it is:\nan elaborate lie, kept alive by the elite priesthood to keep the\nmasses properly submissive to their influences.\n\nPlease offer me an argument that's more convincing than "you just\ndon't believe 'cos you don't want to."  Everything you've said so far\ncould apply equally to any religion -- why do you believe yours is the\nreal one?\n\n(Note that saying "it's the only one that promises eternal life" or\nsomething like that isn't an answer to my question, unless you show\nthat (a) no other religion promises eternal life and (b) it is\nunarguably true that eternal life must be a reality.)
i guess i ought not conclude from this, then, that since you didn't ask to\nbe created, you don't care if you go to hell.  :)\n\n\n\n  i don't consider myself an unthinking sheep.  the bible says god created\nus to be in communion and obedience to him.  the first and only rule was\nto not eat of a certain tree, or else the punishment is distance from him\nand physical death.  god's intention in creating us is to have a relationship\nwith us.  the bible documents god's attempts to have that relationship\nculminating in the person of jesus to bear the consequences of all sin so\nthat all who accept him can have a relationship with god again: the purpose\nof creation.
Why don't you tell us, Tony?  I'm sure what you THINK you know adds up to a\nlot more than what Casper has.\n\nDoesn't it frustrate you to consider how many intelligent, thoughtful \npeople you have prepared for the Mormon missionaries with your rant?  The\nmore you talk, the better we look.  Nothing makes the truth look better\nthan a background of falsehood.\n\nSic 'em, Tony!
Russell Turpin, as is his wont, has raised some interesting issues \nin his struggle with the Christian texts and the Christians. \nUnfortunately, he seems to be hoping for simplicity where it is \nnot available. The lukewarm stew he detects may well be an inevitable \nresult of the divine mixing himself up with a bunch of losers such \nas humanity. \n\nAlso unfortunately (perhaps) I have a deadline in two weeks, the \nresponsibility for which prevents me, in good conscience, \nfrom writing a more considered response and fully entering the\nfray, as it were. \n\nLet me then say what I can, briefly.\n\n-----\n\n\nThis point, for the net.browsers who also still read books, is\npursued throughly in Kaufmann, Critique_of_Religion_and_Philosophy.\n\n\nThis is a theological statement worthy of Barth.\nDr Turpin (DD) may wear the black robe of Geneva yet! :-)\n\n\nThis requires the assumption that all interpretations are\nequally valid, that there is no way of reasonably distinguishing\namong them. I wouldn't make that assumption; I don't think it is\na reasonable assumption. \n\n\nMichael, and I, and others, read 'the Bible' with Christian\nglasses. Among the things that this should imply is that the\nNT informs the OT, even to the point of dominanting it. Some\npoints in the OT (ceremonial & dietary laws) are explicitly \nabrogated by the NT texts. To drive Russell Turpin's point with\nadequacy, one needs to begin with NT texts (probably from Matthew,\nand probably about damnation) (Just trying to help :-) )\n\nThis part is, I discover, what most moves me to post:\n\nmls> I am a "radical" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.\n\n\nRussell Turpin's 'No' here is misplaced, not to say inappropriate.\nMichael's self-description much govern.  The equation of radical = liberal, \nwhich seems implied by Russell Turpin  is wrong.  Radical conservatives are \npossible (if sadly lacking in numbers at present). Thomas Merton\nwas a radical, even though conservative in some ways. St Francis\nwas a radical, similarly. How many examples are needed?\n\nmls> ... Why don't I and the (myriads of) other Christians like me\nmls> tell you something about Christianity? ...\n\nMichael's question gets to a heart of the matter (Klingons have\ntwo hearts, so my metaphor is not mixed, just extraterrestrial :-) )\nRussell Turpin (in an earlier post) had said that Michael (Michael's\ntheological positions, actually) didn't tell him much about Christianity;\nDean Simeon responds (this time gently): 'What do you mean?' More\ndirect, perhaps, would have been: 'What could you possibly mean?'\nThe implied rhetorical effort, to separate Michael from the \ntradition, is a failure. Michael is in the tradition. If your idea\nof the tradition doesn't include him, Change your idea of the tradition!\n\n\nHow can one answer this while staying on the more general issue?\nI'm on the other side of the interpretive fence (from Michael)\non this issue, yet '*nothing*' is a hideous overstatement.\n\nOne verse is enough to refute it; I'll offer two, from\nPaul (of all people):\n\n'In Jesus Christ there is neither male nor female...'(Galatians 3:28\n{I don't quote single verses as a rule, and I don't carry \nthem in my head}) and '*Nothing* shall separate us from the glory of God...' \n(roughly, from Romans). [If Russell would promise to convert based\non these or any other verses,  I'd promise to get the full context\nfor any that he requires :-) :-)]\n\n\nThis conclusion does not follow, even in short, from the\nargument that goes before. A surprising logical ellipsis.\n\nDave Davis, ddavis@ma30.bull.com\nThese are my opinions & activities alone\n\nQOTD:
Kent, with regards to the information contained in the Bible (which\nis the original context of this thread), Brian Kendig is inside a huge\nwall.  Brian *IS* inside.  The Bible and the information contained therein\nare outside the wall.   Brian Kendig proves this very sad fact by the\nabsurd things he says.  For example, "If I get through into the firey\npit, I will cease to exist."  The Bible doesn't say that.  He hasn't\na clue even to what Jesus said about hell.  That is but one example.

The idea of an apostacy did not originate with Lucy Smith or Joseph\nSmith or the Mormons.  The idea of a restoration was quite common\nin the early 19th century USA.  Alexander Campbell, founder of the\ngroup that now survives with the name "Disciples of Christ" preached\nthat the primitive church had been lost and was attempting to restore\nit (although not be revelations).  Many Cambellites subsequently became\nMormons, including co-founder Sidney Rigdon.  Actually, you can find\nsuch sentiments in many of the early protestants of the reformation,\nsuch as Martin Luther.\n-- \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGordon Banks  N3JXP      | "Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and\ngeb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon."

The following partial summary of a Theory of the Universe includes a\nlittle-known description of the CREATION of our Solar System:\n\n\n                      LARSONIAN Astronomy and Physics\n\n               Orthodox physicists, astronomers, and astrophysicists \n          CLAIM to be looking for a "Unified Field Theory" in which all \n          of the forces of the universe can be explained with a single \n          set of laws or equations.  But they have been systematically \n          IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years! \n\n               The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson's comprehensive \n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he \n          calls the "Reciprocal System", is built on two fundamental \n          postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of \n          space and time: \n    \n               (1) "The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE \n          component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE \n          UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME." \n    \n               (2) "The physical universe conforms to the relations of \n          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are \n          ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN." \n    \n               From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE \n          Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of \n          translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-\n          rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward \n          SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light \n          (which Larson called "UNIT VELOCITY" and "THE NATURAL \n          DATUM"). \n      \n               At each step in the development, Larson was able to \n          MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the \n          REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles \n          [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star \n          clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white \n          dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET \n          DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY \n          BURSTS). \n          \n               And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom, \n          Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-\n          atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility \n          and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of \n          matter. \n\n               All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy \n          complex mathematics, in his books. \n    \n\n\n          BOOKS of Dewey B. Larson\n          \n               The following is a complete list of the late Physicist \n          Dewey B. Larson's books about his comprehensive GENERAL \n          UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe.

Atkin Ave., Salt Lake City, Utah  84106.  This is the \n          organization that was started to promote Larson's Theory.  \n          They have other related publications, including the quarterly \n          journal "RECIPROCITY". \n\n          \n\n          Physicist Dewey B. Larson's Background\n    \n               Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer \n          (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he \n          died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in \n          Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He \n          developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \n          physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE \n          chemical properties based only on the elements used. \n    \n               Larson's lack of a fancy "PH.D." degree might be one \n          reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is \n          NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider \n          to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same \n          time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX \n          physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer, \n          well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC \n          ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC.. \n     \n               Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally \n          test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.  \n          He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER \n          researchers' experimental and observational data.  And in \n          many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER. \n    \n               A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX \n          physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking \n          for a "unified field theory" that works, but have been \n          IGNORING one for over 30 years now! \n    \n               "Modern physics" does NOT explain the physical universe \n          so well.  Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of \n          quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who \n          agree.  And remember that "epicycles", "crystal spheres", \n          "geocentricity", "flat earth theory", etc., ALSO once SEEMED \n          to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG. \n    \n    \n               Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior, \n          was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory, and was (or \n          still is) President of Larson's organization, "THE \n          INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE", and Editor of \n          their quarterly Journal "RECIPROCITY".  He moved to \n          Minneapolis after retiring. \n    \n\n\n          "Super Collider" BOONDOGGLE!\n          \n               I am AGAINST contruction of the "Superconducting Super \n          Collider", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS \n          WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of "scientific" \n          value. \n    \n               Most physicists don't realize it, but, according to the \n          comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist \n          Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY \n          particles ("mesons", "hyperons", ALLEGED "quarks", etc.) \n          which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab, \n          Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are \n          CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly \n          disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible \n          with their environment. \n    \n               A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a \n          few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not \n          seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE \n          CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW! \n    \n               Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3 \n          BILLION cost?!!  Don't we have much more important uses for \n          this WASTED money?! \n    \n     \n               Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed \n          location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some \n          kind of "fire ants" eating the insulation off underground \n          cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water \n          with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of \n          the "Supercollider"?! \n    \n          \n               Naming the "Super Collider" after Ronald Reagon, as \n          proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be \n          named after a leading particle PHYSICIST. \n      \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Anti-Matter\n          \n               In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \n          physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of \n          opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more \n          to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the \n          photons of which they are made, in relation to the \n          vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light, \n          which Larson calls "Unit Velocity" and the "Natural Datum". \n     \n               In Larson's Theory, a positron is actually a particle of \n          MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet, \n          the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their \n          respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each \n          other. \n      \n               In Larson's Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical \n          universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension \n          of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our \n          MATERIAL half. \n       \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Relativity\n          \n               The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury \n          has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the \n          rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this \n          advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational \n          perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, \n          etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to \n          help "prove" Einstein's "General Theory of Relativity". \n    \n               But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results \n          CLOSER to the 43 seconds than "General Relativity" can, by \n          INSTEAD using "SPECIAL Relativity".  In one or more of his \n          books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH \n          ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury. \n    \n               Larson TOTALLY REJECTED "General Relativity" as another \n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of "Special \n          Relativity", including the parts about "mass increases" near \n          the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on \n          doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than \n          1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT, \n          although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.). \n     \n               In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \n          physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead \n          of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured \n          from our material half of the physical universe.  The one \n          dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low \n          relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are \n          NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and \n          the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR. \n          [Larson often used the term "COORDINATE TIME" when writing \n          about this.] \n    \n     \n               In regard to "mass increases", it has been PROVEN in \n          atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near \n          the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is \n          ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists \n          are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson's Theory, \n          mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is \n          actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS \n          BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.  \n          The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward \n          SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of \n          the so-called "Big Bang" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL \n          FANTASY). \n    \n                                    \n          \n          THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\n\n               I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book "THE UNIVERSE \n          OF MOTION", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific \n          Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456 \n          pages, indexed, hardcover. \n    \n               It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL \n          UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that \n          author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago. \n    \n               It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical \n          mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and \n          multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of \n          the "3-degree" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-\n          ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white \n          dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc.. \n    \n               It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL \n          looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with \n          OPEN MINDS! \n    \n               The following is an example of his Theory's success: \n          In his first book in 1959, "THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL \n          UNIVERSE", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING \n          GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding \n          them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson's \n          comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he \n          had an immediate related explanation for them also. \n    \n\n \n          GAMMA-RAY BURSTS\n\n               Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching \n          their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were \n          originally thought to originate from "neutron stars" in the \n          disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in \n          Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions \n          uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT \n          correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of \n          directional coincidence). \n    \n               Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the \n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by \n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of \n          his book "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION", published in 1984, the \n          gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the \n          ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls \n          the "Cosmic Sector".  Because of the relationship between the \n          anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and \n          the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can \n          pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at \n          random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do \n          not correspond with known objects, and come from all \n          directions uniformly.) \n    \n               I wonder how close to us in space a source location \n          would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most \n          life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to \n          stop it! \n    \n               Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which \n          are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were \n          actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS! \n    \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation\n          \n               About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the \n          vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox \n          astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory \n          theory about how they form or why there are so many of them. \n    \n               But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY \n          CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of \n          the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey \n          B. Larson. \n    \n               I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is \n          detailed in Chapter 7 of his book "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION" \n          and in some of his other books. \n    \n               First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate \n          energy by "fusion".  A small fraction comes from slow \n          gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE \n          ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each \n          element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the \n          element is, the lower is this limit.  A star's internal \n          temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and \n          absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually \n          reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and \n          lighter elements. \n    \n               When the internal temperature of the star reaches the \n          destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I \n          SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron \n          present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms \n          and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some \n          of his books [better than I can]. \n    \n               When the star explodes, the lighter material on the \n          outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less \n          than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center \n          portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to \n          the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The \n          explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and \n          it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN \n          SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while. \n    \n               Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall \n          back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown \n          outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The \n          material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a \n          WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward \n          the "MAIN SEQUENCE" from opposite directions on the H-R \n          Diagram. \n    \n               The chances of the two masses falling back into the \n          exact same location in space, making a single lone star \n          again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY \n          system, orbiting each other. \n     \n               According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE \n          DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the \n          material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown \n          outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to \n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about "degenerate matter", "neutron \n          stars", "black holes", etc.. \n    \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Solar System Formation\n\n               If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the \n          exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single \n          white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL "mini" white dwarf \n          stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably \n          still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected \n          by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS! \n      \n               In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all \n          this information, and other principles of his comprehensive \n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive \n          his own version of Bode's Law. \n          \n\n\n          "Black Hole" FANTASY!\n\n               I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently \n          completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO "black \n          holes" merging together into a SINGLE "black hole", and \n          concluded that the new "black hole" would have MORE MASS than \n          the sum of the two original "black holes". \n    \n               Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED \n          FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of "black \n          holes", etc.! \n    \n               After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson's books about \n          his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \n          universe, especially his book "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION", it is \n          clear to me that "black holes" are NOTHING more than \n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is \n          just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the "black \n          hole" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want \n          to "prove" their theory. \n    \n    \n               By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is \n          being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and \n          astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking's severe physical \n          problem somehow makes him "wiser".  It does NOT! \n    \n               I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist \n          Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread \n          publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson's \n          Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of \n          Unified Science). \n          \n          \n          \n          ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION\n\n               I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection \n          with UFO's and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to \n          find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed. \n    \n               I found a possible clue about why they might work on \n          pages 112-113 of the book "BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER", by \n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of \n          Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \n          universe.  I quote one paragraph: \n    \n               "As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development \n          of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally \n          different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.  \n          The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It \n          was brought out in Volume I [Larson's book "NOTHING BUT \n          MOTION"] that there are physical processes in operation which \n          produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that, \n          although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in \n          many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities \n          for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are \n          limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of \n          free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the \n          universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged \n          state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension \n          space, because they are inherently rotating units of space, \n          and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open \n          space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently \n          in the same location with respect to the natural reference \n          system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the \n          stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron, \n          like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by \n          the progression of the natural reference system.  All \n          material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons \n          similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.  \n          Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later, \n          whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The \n          electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth \n          therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level." \n          \n               Note that in Larson's Theory, UNcharged electrons are \n          also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a \n          particular frequency (above the "unit" frequency) spinning \n          around one axis at a particular rate (below the "unit" rate).  \n          ("Unit velocity" is the speed of light, and there are \n          vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light, \n          according to Larson's Theory.)  [I might have the "above" and \n          "below" labels mixed up.] \n    \n               Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-\n          LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of \n          light! \n    \n               If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION \n          fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these \n          electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a \n          charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to \n          achieve propulsion.

It seems you lived a fairly 'wild life'-- my background is far more\ntraditional, mostly working, working, working.

While my more stable environment didn't and \nstill does not produce the situation where I feel such guilt.\n\nThis is just one possible explanation why you feel this burden,\nwhile I haven't felt it so far.\n\nRegards,\nKent
Zoroaster is far older than Daniel. If anything, one could claim that,\nin a sense, Daniel is a descendant of Zoroaster; as Daniel, though being\nHebrew, has assimilated into Zoroastrianism and has successfully\nintroduced the religion into the Tanakh of Judaism. [However, the majority \nof the book is in Hellenistic Aramaic (not Babylonian Aramaic) and only has\nKethuvim or Writing status.]\n\nRef: Encyclopedia of Religion, Mircea Eliade:\n\nDANIEL, or, in Hebrew, Daniyye'l; hero of the biblical book that bears his name.\nDaniel is presented as a Jew in the Babylonian exile who achieved notoriety in\nthe royal court for his dream interpretations and cryptography and for his\nsalvation from death in a lion's pit. He also appears in the last chapters of\nthe book as the revealer of divine mysteries and of the timetables of Israel's\nrestoration to national-religious autonomy. As a practitioner of oneiromancy in\nthe court, described in Daniel 1-6 (written in the third person), Daniel per-\nforms his interpretations alone, while as a visionary-apocalyptist, in Daniel\n7-12 (written in the first person), he is in need of an angel to help him\ndecode his visions and mysteries of the future. It is likely that the name\nDaniel is pseudonymous, a deliberate allusion to a wise and righteous man known\nfrom Ugaritic legend and earlier biblical tradition. (Ez. 14:4,28:3).\n  The authorship of the book is complicated not only by the diverse narrative\nvoices and content but by its language: Daniel 1:1-2:4a and 8-12 are written in\nHebrew, whereas Daniel 2:4b-7:28 is in Aramaic. The language division parallels\nthe subject division (Daniel 1-6 concerns legends and dream interpretations;\n7-12 concerns apocalyptic visions and interpretations of older prophecies). The\noverall chronological scheme as well as internal thematic balances (Daniel 2-7\nis chiliastically related) suggest an attempt at redactional unity. After the\nprefatory tale emphasizing the life in court and the loyalty of Daniel and some\nyouths to their ancestral religion, a chronological ordering is discernable: a\nsequence from King Nebuchadrezzar to Darius is reported (Dn. 7-12). Much of\nthis royal dating and even some of the tales are problematic: for example,\nDaniel 4 speaks of Nebuchadrezzar's transformation into a beast, a story that\nis reported in the Qumran scrolls of Nabonidus; Belshazzar is portrayed as the\nlast king of Babylon, although he was never king; and Darius is called a Mede\nwho conquered Babylon and is placed before Cyrus II of Persia, although no such\nDarius is known (the Medes followed the Persians, and Darius is the name of\nseveral Persian kings). Presumably the episodes of Daniel 2-6, depicting a\nseries of monarchical reversals, episodes of ritual observances, and reports of\nmiraculous deliverances were collected in the Seleucid period (late fourth to\nmid-second century BCE) in order to reinvigorate waning Jewish hopes in divine\nprovidence and encourage steadfast faith.\n  The visions of Daniel 7-12, reporting events from the reign of Belshazzar to\nthat of Cyrus II (but actually predicting the overthrow of Seleucid rule in\nPalestine), were collected and published during the reign of Antiochus IV prior\nto the Maccabean Revolt, for it was then (beginning in 168 BCE) that the Jews\nwere put to the test concerning their allegiance to Judaism and their ancestral\ntraditions, and many refused to desecrate the statues of Moses and endured a\nmartyr's death for their resolute trust in divine dominion. All of the visions\nof Daniel dramatize this dominion in different ways: for example, via images of\nthe enthronement of a God of judgment, with a "son of man" invested with rule\n(this figure was interpreted by Jews as Michael the archangel and by Christians\nas Christ), in chapter 7; via zodiacal images of cosmic beasts with bizarre\nmanifestations, as in chapter 8; or via complex reinterpretations of ancient\nprophecies, especially those of Jeremiah 25:9-11, as found in Daniel 9-12.\n  The imagery of the four beasts in chapter 7 (paralleled by the image of four\nmetals in chapter 2), representing four kingdoms to be overthrown by a fifth\nmonarchy of divine origin, is one of the enduring images of the book; it sur-\nvived as a prototype of Jewish and Christian historical and apocalyptic schemes\nto the end of the Middle Ages. The role and power of this imagery in the\nfifteenth and sixteenth century work of the exegete Isaac Abravanel, the\nscientist Isaac Newton, and the philosopher Jean Bodin and among the Fifth\nMonarchy Men of seventeenth century England, for example, is abiding testimony\nto the use of this ancient topos in organizing the chiliastic imagination of\ndiverse thinkers and groups. The schema is still used to this day by various\ngroups predicting the apocalyptic advent.\n  The encouragement in the face of religious persecution that is found and\npropagandized in Daniel 11-12 contains a remarkable reinterpretation of Isaiah\n52:13-53:12, regarding the suffering servant of God not as all Israel but as\nthe select faithful. Neither the opening stories about Daniel and the youths nor\nthe final martyrological allusions advocate violence or revolt; they rather\nadvocate a stance of piety, civil disobedience, and trustful resignation.\nVictory for the faithful is in the hands of the archangel Michael, and the\nmartyrs will be resurrected and granted astral immortality. Persumably the\ncircles behind the book were not the same as the Maccabean fighters and may\nreflect some proto-Pharisaic group of hasidim, or pietists. The themes of\nresistance to oppression, freedom of worship, preservation of monotheistic\nintegrity, the overthrow of historical dominions, and the acknowledgement of\nthe God of heaven recur throughout the book and have served as a token of\ntrust for the faithful in their darkest hour.

I recently watched a an episode of "The Old West" a TV show on the \nDiscovery Channel (or perhaps the A&E Network), the one hosted by Kenny\nRogers.  This episode was all about the Mormons and how they settled Utah,\netc.\n\nA large portion of the broadcast was about the "Mountain Meadows Massacre".\nThe program very specifically pointed out that Brigham Young knew nothing\nabout the incident until long after it had happened (before telegraph), and\nit occured as a result of several men inciting a bunch of paronoid Moromn\nsettlers into what amounted to a mob.  All participants in the incident were\nprosecuted and eccomunicated from the LDS Church.\n\nI suggest you watch a rerun of that episode (they play them over and over) \nand see what they (non-Mormons) have to say about it.\n\n\nLance
Recently, I've asked myself a rather interesting question: What RIGHT does\ngod have on our lives (always assuming there is a god, of course...!) ??\n\nIn his infinite wisdom, he made it perfectly clear that if we don't live\naccording to his rules, we will burn in hell. Well, with what RIGHT can god\nmake that desicion? Let's say, for the sake of argument, that god creates every\none of us (directly or indirectly, it doesn't matter.). What then happens, is\nthat he first creates us, and then turns us lose. Well, I didn't ask to be\ncreated. \n\nLet's make an analogue. If a scientist creates a unique living creature (which\nhas happened, it was even patented...!!!), does he then have the right to\nexpect it to behave in a certain matter, or die...?\n\nWho is god to impose its rules on us ? Who can tell if god is REALLY so\nrighteous as god likes us to believe? Are all christians a flock of sheep,\nunable to do otherwise that follow the rest? \n\nHmmmmmmmmmmmm.\n\nI just want to point out that this is not sarcasm, I mean it.\n\n		 	How should one deal with a man who is convinced that\n		 	he is acting according to God's will, and who there-\n     Jokke		fore believes that he is doing you a favour by\n		 	stabbing you in the back?
No, this is far from clear.  We only have the word of the FBI spokepeople that\na survivor made this claim.  We have the contradictory word of the lawyers who\nspoke with the survivors individually that ALL of them agreed that they did\nNOT have a suicide pact and did not intentionally start the fire.  In the absense\nof any more evidence, I don't see how we can decide who to believe.\nFurthermore, its quite possible that there was no general suicide pact and that\nsome small inner circle took it upon themselves to kill everyone else.\nWith the state of the area now, we may never know what happened.\n\n\nAgain, we have only the word of the FBI on this claim.  The lawyers who\nhave also talked to the survors deny that any of them are making that claim.\n\n\nI will agree on your assessment as to the relative probabilities.  Its more likely\nthat the BD's started the fire than did the FBI.  But there is currently NO\nway to decide what actually happened based on the publically available evidence\n(which is nearly none).\n\n\n   D.   The fire was an started accidentally by the BDs.  I am truely amazed that\n        I have heard (or read) of no one suggesting this possibility.\n        With all the tear gas and the lack of electical power in the compound and\n        the adults wearing gas masks, it had to have been chaotic inside.\n        I can easily image someone leaving a lamp too close to something or\n        accidentally dropping a lamp or knocking one over.  With the winds, it\n        would have quickly gotten out of control.\n\n\n   No, I think that D is also quite reasonable.  I personally can't really\nasses any relative probablities to either of these 3 probabilities although if\nforced to bet on the issue, I would probably take an accident (either FBI or\nBD) over intential setting of the fire).\n\n   I would also like to add a comment related to the reports that bodies recovered\nhad gunshot wounds.  The coroner was on the Today Show this morning and categorically\ndenied that they've reach any such conclusions.  He pointed out that under intense\nheat, sufficient pressure builds up in the head that can cause it to explode and\nthat this can look very much like a massive gunshot wound to the head which is\nquite consisted with te reports I've read and heard.\n\n   In short, there's been almost no evidence corroborating any of the many\nscenarios as to what happened on Monday.  We should remain skeptical until\nmore information is available.  \n\n\n--
I am not exactly known as a Flower Child Pacifist, but lets call\ncowpoop cowpoop.\n\n"The peaceful attempt to serve the warrant" consisted of the following\nactions, in order:\n\n1) BATF agents forcing their entry of the "compound" through second\nstory windows.\n\n2) BATF agents loosing some grenades (allegedly "stun" or "flash"\ngrenades) which promptly detonated.\n\n*After* which, according to the tapes I have seen, the B-D\nstarted shooting back.\n\nNow exactly how is it that someone breaking into private property\nand tossing grenades around is considered "peaceful" by\n*anyone*? You *think* on that.\n\n(Which is not to say I do not still hold my previous and\nentirely correct notions about what should be worn and\nwhat arms should be used in assaulting a building.)
Brian Ceccarelli wrote (that's me):\n\n\nKent Sandvik responds:\n\n\nI think I see where you are coming from Kent.  Jesus doesn't view\nguilt like our modern venacular colors it.   \n\n"Feelings" have nothing to do with guilt.  Feelings arise from the state of \nbeing guilty.  Feeling and guilt are mutally exclusive.  Feelings are a \nreaction from guilt.  Jesus is talking about the guilt state, not the \nreaction.   Let me give you an example:\n\nHave you ever made a mistake?  Have you ever lied to someone?  Even a\nlittle white lie?   Have you ever claimed to know something that you really \ndidn't know?  Have you ever hated someone?  Have you ever been selfish?\nAre you guilty of any one of these?   The answer is of course, YES.  You\nare guilty.  Period.  That is it what Jesus is getting at.  No big surprise.  \nFeelings do not even enter the picture.   Consider Jesus's use of the word\n"guilt" as how a court uses it.\n\nJesus is concerned that everyone should admit that they are guilty of being\nimperfect.  The Bible calls it the state that we are all sinners.  We all do\nbad things.  Even the most insignficant thing that we do wrong is proof of our \nguilt that we are all sinners.     It is it in our nature to do bad things. \nWe are sinners, therefore we do bad things.  Being a sinner is fact.  It is\nnot a pleasant fact.  But it is just a fact.  We are not perfect.   Calling us\nsinners should have no more emotional charge to you than calling you a\nhuman being.  Guilty as charged.\n\n\nYou can handle your guilt in one of two ways:  Acknowledge you\nmade a mistake, learn from it, and try to not do it again--in\nthe meantime, not punishing yourself for it:  which is the\nway Jesus wants you to handle or it.  This is the healthy way.\n\nOr two, the destructive way:  put yourself down, slap yourself\nand feel like crap, never forgive yourself, force yourself to\nsay a thousand Hail Marys . . . even to suicide.  This the way \nJesus does NOT want us to deal with it.   All people fall into this \ncategory to some extent in their lives.\n\nJesus is not in the business of saving us from this guilt\nfeeling.  Jesus is in the business of showing us how much he\nloves us despite our guilt.  Jesus knows we are guilty.  That\nisn't new to him.  It is no big deal to him. He just wants you to realize \nthat this sinful nature destroys the relationship between you and him.\nThat is what he wants you to know.  Why, because he wants to \nhave your company.  You are immensely valuable to him.\nJesus wants a relationship with you, however, in our present\nsinful nature, we are incapable of having this relationship.  \n\nGod is perfect.  We are not.  You cannot fit a square peg into\na round hole.  However, God has provided a way for us to\nchange our nature so that we can have a relationship with him.\nGod has provided Jesus, so that whosoever just believes in\nJesus, will have their nature changed.  The Holy Spirit will\nmove it.  And now divine nature is now within lives our very\nbeing--and us and God communicate with each through his\nunifying Holy Spirit.  The benefits of this are endless.  For\nwith the divine nature living within us, we can now see\nour imperfections better.  We can now head them off at the pass.  With\nthe power of the Holy Spirit living in us, we now have his power\nto help us overcome our shortcomings.   Because the divine nature lives \nwithin us, we can now understand profound Bible passages that never before\nwe could understand.  Because the divine nature now lives within us, we now \nhave authority over demonic forces.  And lastly, because the divine \nnature now lives within us, we have eternal life--for the Holy Spirit\nis eternal.\n\nThe relationship with Jesus is of the utmost importance.  Because\nit is not what you do in life that qualifies you to belong to\nheavenly kingdom, it is your relationship to the living God.\nRemember what Jesus said at the tail end of Matthew when he\nseparated the "goats from the sheep".   Many people in the\nlast day will ask him, "Didn't I prophesy in your name and do\nmiracles, and do good things in your name?"   And what did Jesus say?\n"Depart from me, for I never *knew* you."  That is the cornerstone of \nChristianity, Kent.  Jesus must know you as his friend.  It is your \nrelationship to Jesus.  If he is your friend and you are his, you will\nbe counted among those who will share in his inheritance in heaven.  \n\n\nGood.  It shows that you have a strong self-image--that you\nlove yourself.  That is the second greatest commandment Jesus\ntaught.  If only more people could do as you do.   As I said before, \nin the common english venacular, "feeling guilty" has a\ndifferent meaning than the state of guilt.\n\n\nI believe what we all need in our personalities is a lot less ego,\na lot less self-centeredness, and a lot more unconditional love.
}It is so simple.... I'm surprised that this subject gets\n}beat to death about once a month.

Well, the best thing to do is to read the book "Parallel Universes"\nby Dr. Fred Wolf. \n\nIn essence, Dr. Wolf says that one interpretation of the sub-atomic\nparticle/wave duality is that what we perceive as a wave is actually\nan infinate number of parallel universes overlaid, and in each of\nthese universes there is a particle in a different location. When we\ndo something to make a particle "appear," we are actually causing\nall the parallel universes to collapse into one. Apparently this is\none line of thought on the nature of QM, that is going through some\nof the scientific community.\n\nDr. Wolf (and many others) claim that somehow the collapse is caused\nby the mental effort of observing the particle. This implys that\nmind is more than merely a biological phenomenon. He then extrapolates\nthat if mind is an integral part of the universe, then perhaps consciousness\nis the element that gives order and form to the universe(s) it/themself(s).\n\nIt all gets rather interesting, but what I find facinating is that\nthis would explain the phenomenon of "magick" as practiced in my\nreligion. Dr. Wolf speculates that the ordering functionality of mind\ncould be caused by the selection of a future from an infinite number of\npossible futures; he says that this might be done by some sort of\ncommunication between ones current, and possible future selves. \nI have long speculated that if magick is not merely a form of self\ndelusion then perhaps it could be caused by some sort of a selection\nof one of many possible futures.\n\nI realize that this gets pretty bizarre, but it never hurts to keep \nan open mind and at least file it all away as another possibile \nexplaination of the world in which we find ourselves. After all, the\nmore we learn about the universe in which we live, the more we learn\nthat it is truly a very strange place.
So Rick, why not read the Bible for yourself?  It is written in plain\n   english.  Decide for yourself.

Brian, have you checked out what your priests told you in the\nBible to see whether they were telling you the truth?  Did you know\nthat according to the Bible, there shouldn't even be such things as\n"priests" anymore?  Do you know why the preisthood was established in\nthe Old Testament to begin with and the reasons why after Jesus,\nthere were no priests--that is until the Roman Catholic Church \n300 years later devised the doctrine of transubstantiation by ignoring\nthe whole concept beyond the book of Hebrews?\n\nYou said you analyzed the Bible very closely.  I think you are\nlying.  For if you had, I would think you would have at least\ngot the doctrine of hell straight.

^^-- name?\n\nOther than it tells quite a lot about the Man himself. \n\n\nAre you the spokesman for "most people?"\n\n\nThat you don't recognize the Biblical commentary used.  Those in the\nchurch know the language though, and have no such excuse.  \n\n\nYou missed the point -- which is that the Prophets, the Psalms, and \nRevelation, all together, provide a very rich view of a very special\nevent -- a wedding.\n\n\nHow are you able to make such a conclusion?  Please note, that the\nfirst part of Revelation makes it clear that the address is to those\nin the church. That said, it doesn't hurt to try to see what the \nprophecies are ahead of time -- for those outside the church.\n\n\nSo you say. It should be interesting to see what the investigators \nconclude, and what the final judgments are.\n\n\nSo much for war and government eh.\n\n\nVery glad you asked, since I goofed -- it should be Philippian 1:14-19: \n(here from NIV)\n\n	Because of my chains, most of the brothers in the Lord\n	have been encouraged to speak the word of God more\n	courageously and fearlessly.\n\n	It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and \n	rivalry, but others out of good will. The latter do so\n	in love, knowing that I am put here for the gospel. \n	The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not\n	sincerely, supposing that they can stir up trouble for\n	me while I am chains. But what does it matter? \n\n	The important thing is that in every way, whether from\n	false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because\n	of this I rejoice.\n	\nMy comment stems from the realization that we who love the Lord, are\nhuman and imperfect. Whatever we "preach," no matter how eloquent, or\nhow corrupted -- is of little difference. Those who know the Master's\nvoice will recognize Him -- a gem-stone amidst rock. Such is also the \nlesson of the "stumblingblock." For those who have an ear to hear.
Jeremiah:\n25:27 Therefore thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of\nhosts, the God of Israel; Drink ye, and be drunken, and spue, and\nfall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among\nyou.\n25:28 And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to\ndrink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ye\nshall certainly drink.
I'm not sure that you can distinguish between myth and legend so\nneatly, or at all.  A myth is more than a single story.  The thought \nstructure and world-paradigm in which that story is interpreted is as\nimportant a part of the myth as the story itself.  Thus, I can think of\nno story which is meant to be conveyed understandably from one person\nto another within a single culture which won't rest upon that underlying\nthought structure, and thus transmit some of that culture's mythical\n"truths" along with it.
This discussion on "objective" seems to be falling into solipsism (Eg: the\nrecent challenge from Frank Dwyer, for someone to prove that he can actually\nobserve phenomena).  Someones even made the statement that science is\n"subjective" and that even atom are "subjective." This is getting a bit silly\nand the word "objective" is losing all meaning.  Lets start by remembering the\ndefinition of "objective" which has been already presented:\n\n  objective ADJ. 1. Of or having to do with a material object as \n    distinguished from a mental concept. 2. Having actual existence.\n    3.a. Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice. b. Based on\n    observable phenomenon.\n\nThe Objectivity of a thing is not based on whether everyone agrees on that\nthing (eg: the world is objectively round, regardless of the fact that there\nexist flat earthers), but rather whether it is based observable and verifiable\nphenomenon (instead of being based solely on peoples wishes, feeling, mental\nprocesses, etc).  Thus atoms, being based on very observable and repeatable\nphenomenon, are indeed considered to be objective rather than subjective. \nEven weird, high energy physics is based on observable phenomenon (even though\nthat observation can change the outcome).  Nor are those observable phenomenon\naffected by emotion, or personal prejudice (eg: chemical reactions do not\nchange to the whims of different people).  Thus to say that science is not\nobjective (ie: objectively verifiable) is a bit silly, as that is the\npoint of science.  Now I will agree that science is not objectively "good;" I\nwill not thereby conclude though that science is not objective. \n\nNow some examples things which are "objective":  A D-12 tractor is larger\nthan the average breadbox.  Chlorophyll is green.  Seawater contains salt.\nThere exists ozone in the atmosphere (at least presently).  Ozone blocks \nultraviolet light.  Ultraviolet light increases the incidents of skin Cancer.\n\n"Good" on the other hand is a value judgement.  It doesn't seem to have an\nexistence apart from what we give it (unless someone can objectively show the\nexistence of an omnipotent entity which has defined "good").  We cannot\nquantify it, touch it or collect it in any concrete sense (eg: I have a bag\nfull of "good").  Now we do sometimes attempt to give the word "good" an\nobjective meaning, e.g.  "good" has been used to denote strength, resiliency,\nspeed, etc.  That though, is a subjective definition, as some might not see\n"strength" and etc, as necessarily "good" (eg: strength inspired by Naziism \nis not generally viewed as "good"). \n\nAs to a morality, I cannot say that I have ever seen a morality strictly based\non verifiable observable phenomenon.  The closest I have seen is some form of\nthe "Golden Rule," which concludes that it is best not to deliberately piss\npeople off, as they will likely then involve themselves in your life, in a\nmanner you won't like.  This is verifiable; when you "get in someone's face,"\nthey will often retaliate.  Another objective fact about morality is that a\nmore powerful group can enforce their morality on a weaker group, and thus can\nat times, ignore that form of the "Golden Rule" without fear of reprisal.  Now\nas to whether this enforcing of morality is "good" or "bad," is quite\nsubjective.  By the way, remember that subjective does not mean that a thing\ncannot be formally stated, or even commonly agreed upon; it only means that\nthat it is not verifiable from observable phenomena, or has a physical\nexistence unto itself.  Also note that I have not stated that there is no such\nthing as an objective morality, or that I could not accept any such a\nmorality; I have simply stated that I have seen no evidence of any such\nmorality. \n\nOne other thing to notice, "objective" is many times used as synonymous with\n"true" and/or "absolute," and "subjective" sometimes has the connotation of\n"false" and/or "relative." Tain't necessarily so.  For instance, when a\nconclusion is based on objective, but insufficient evidence, then it can be\nboth objective and false.  As to "absolute," it is easy to note that while we\ncan objectively show that TNT is explosive, but that does not absolutely mean\nthat all TNT will explode, and thus objective is not necessarily absolute\neither.  On the other hand, something subjective can also be either\n"absolutist," or "true." For instance, there are some theists who are\nspecifically "absolutist" in their morality, even though they have only\nsubjective evidence to back it up.  Further, many a scientist and detective\nhas been motivated by subjective reasons (eg: a "gut feeling" or "hunch"), to\ninvestigate a phenomena or situation, and gather the objective evidence\nnecessary to support a true hypothesis.  On the whole though, I would have to\nagree that objective evidence is much more trustworthy than subjective\nevidence.\n \n				Later,\n\n				Dave Butler

ra>   Robert, you keep making references to "orthodox" belief, and saying\nra> things like "it is held that..." (cf. "Kermit" thread).  On what\nra> exact body of theology are you drawing for what you call "orthodox?"\n\n     "Orthodox" is a compound word. It comes from 'orthos' (straight, true, \n     right) and from 'doxa' (opinion, doctrine, teaching). I use orthodox to \n     refer to 'right teaching.' Right teaching is derived from letting God \n     speak to us through the Bible. This can be from reading simple truths \n     in the Scriptures and by using the Bible to interpret the Bible.\n\nra> Who is that "holds that" Luke meant what you said he meant?\n\n     I think that it is apparent from reading the Scriptures that are\n     pertinent.\n\n     Luke 23:43 records Christ's promise to the repentant thief who hung on\n     an adjacent cross: "Truly I say to you, today you will be with Me in\n     paradise." But was it not until later that Christ rose from the dead\n     and ascended to heaven? If Christ Himself was not in heaven until\n     Sunday, how could the repentant thief have been there with Him? The\n     answer lies in the location of "paradise" when Jesus died.\n\n     Apparently paradise was not exalted to heaven until Easter Day.\n\n     Jesus refers to it in the middle of the story of the rich man and \n     Lazarus as "Abraham's Bosom," to which the godly beggar Lazarus was\n     carried by the angels after his decease (Luke 16:19-31).  Thus\n     "Abraham's Bosom" referred to the place where the souls of the redeemed\n     waited till the day of Christ's Resurrection.\n\n     It was not yet lifted to heaven but it may well have been a section of \n     hades (Hebrew: Sheol), reserved for believers who had died in the faith\n     but would not be admitted into the glorious presence of God in heaven\n     until the price of redemption had actually been paid on Calvary; or\n     even that none would precede the presence of Jesus back to glory with\n     the Father.\n\n     Doubtless it was the infernal paradise that the souls of Jesus and the\n     repentant thief repaired after they each died on Friday afternoon. But\n     on Sunday, after the risen Christ had first appeared to Mary Magdalene\n     (John 20:17) and her two companions (Matthew 28:9), presumably He then\n     took up with Him to glory all the inhabitants of infernal paradise\n     (including Abraham, Lazarus, and the repentant thief). We read in\n     Ephesians 4:8 concerning Christ: "Ascending on high, He led captivity\n     captive; He gave gifts unto men." Verse 9 continues: "But what does `He\n     ascended' mean but that He also descended to the lowest parts of the\n     earth?" -i.e., to hades. Verse 10 adds: "He who descended is the same\n     as He who ascended above all the heavens." Presumably He led the whole\n     band of liberated captives from hades (i.e., the whole population of\n     preresurrection paradise) up to the glory of heaven.\n\nra> Whenever your personal interpretation of Biblical passages is\nra> challenged, your only response seems to be that one needs merely to\nra> "look at the Bible" in order to see the truth, but what of those who\nra> see Biblical things differently from you?\n\n     I think that this characterization is faulty. Whenever my 'personal \n     interpretation' is questioned, I usually give a reason.\n\n     As for those that see things differently, please, put forward where\n     there is a valid difference, and we can discuss it. \n\n     I seem to be seeing from you the notion that any difference in how one \n     views the Bible is somehow legitimate, except, or course, for the stuff \n     that I glean from it. Put forward a contrary view and perhaps we can \n     have a discussion on that topic. But to decry something that I put \n     forward, without putting forward something else to discuss, and to \n     dismiss what I put forward while giving credence to other alleged views\n     that have yet to be put forward is simply being contentious.\n\nra> Are we to simply assume that you are the only one who really\nra> understands it?\n\n     If you believe that something that I have drawn from Scripture is \n     wrong, then please, show me from Scripture where it is wrong.  Simply \n     stating that there are other views is not a proof. Show it to me from \n     Scripture and then we can go on.

In <1ren9a$94q@morrow.stanford.edu> salem@pangea.Stanford.EDU (Bruce Salem) \n\n\n\nThis brings up another something I have never understood.  I asked this once\nbefore and got a few interesting responses, but somehow didn't seem satisfied.\nWhy would the NT NOT be considered a good source.  This might be a \nliterary/historical question, but when I studied history I always looked for \nfirsthand original sources to write my papers.  If the topic was on Mr. X, I \nlooked to see if Mr. X wrote anything about it.  If the topic was on a group, \nlook for the group, etc.  If the topic is on Mr. X, and Mr. X did not write \nanything about it, (barring the theistic response about the Bible being \ndivinely inspired which I can't adequately argue), wouldn't we look for people\nwho ate, worked, walked, talked, etc. with him?  If someone was at an event \nwouldn't they be a better "reporter" than someone who heard about it second \nhand?  I guess isn't firsthand better than second hand.  I know, there is bias,\nand winners writing history, but doesn't the principle of firsthand being best\nstill apply?\n\nMAC\n--\n****************************************************************\n                                                    Michael A.

Actually if Mr X had something to gain by his claims his\naccount of the events would nmot be the most respected. Case\nand point, the resurrection. By claiming that the resurrection\nactually happened the early preachers were able to convert many\nto Christianity. However, if you read Mathew 27:38 (?) and the\ncase for the resurrected saints who walked around Jerusalem and\nappeared to "many People" you would realize that other\nhistorians (Josephus for one) would have reported on it all if\nit happened. The fact that the Bible speaks of events of such\ngreat magnitude that they would have been noticed taken with\nthe fact that they are not reported on by historians could only\nmean that the bible contains many made up stories.
This all would also implicate that in order for the sinning 2 month\nold baby to get forgivance, he or she has to ask for help from Jesus.\nSomehow I find this a little bit amuzing.\n\nCheers,\nKent

In <1993Apr24.214843.10940@midway.uchicago.edu> eeb1@quads.uchicago.edu\n\n\nI already responded to this on one dimension, but afterthoughts cause\nme to make another, independent reply.  The problem with a "moment of\nsilence" is that it is NOT an even-handed way of "allowing" for religion\namongst students in the public schools.  As I noted before, Muslims need\nmore than a moment of silence in order to perform the prayers they are\nrequired by Muhammad to do.  And (at least Orthodox) Jewish prayer also\nhas requirements that are not addressed by this.\n\nThere is, in fact, a highly selective BIAS towards Christian prayer in\nthis "moment of silence" shit.  And that is especially bizarre in that\nChristian prayer DOESN'T NEED this stuff -- a Christain may pray totally\nincognito AT ANY TIME (to some extent, this is true of Muslims and Jews\nas well -- what I intend in my first paragraph is that there *are* some\ncharacteristic forms of prayer in *these* religions which DO need special\ntimes and/or behavior, which cannot be undertaken without an observer \nbeing able taking note of it.)\n\nA Christian may pray, at ANY time -- silently and without any trace of\nhis activity being evident to others.  That may or may not be true of the\nother religious traditions amongst us: certainly, these tend to have SOME\nforms of prayer that WOULD evidence differences from American/Protestant\n"mainstream" religion.\n\nAll that a "moment of silence" does is to allow THAT ONE tradition which\ndoesn't NEED it, to have a "special" place set aside in the public schools.\nThere is NOTHING in Christian prayer that requires public forms, or rugs,\nor phylacteries, or anything else at all visible to the outside world.  A\nChristian student MAY (and probably does) pray at innumerable times during\nthe day, without anyone else knowing it.  [That may also be true of non-\nChristians -- I am not claimng otherwise].  In the "moment of silence" it\nwould STILL be difficult for the Jews to gather and daven, for the Muslims\nto do their ablutions and find qiblah to Mecca and engage in the prescribed\nforms.  But *of course* Christians can do *their* thing -- and therefore,\nthe provision is nothing but a disguised attempt to encourage just that.\n\nLuckily, there *is* a strong Jewish presence in this country (and I, as\na Christian, revere some of the Jewish teachers I had in public schools),\nand a growing Muslim presence as well.  I can only hope that the political\nforces consequent on this will PREVENT the imposition of Christian forms\non non-Christians.\n\nAs far as I can see (as a Christian) there is NOTHING in this "moment of\nsilence" campaign but an attempt to use PUBLIC social pressure to FORCE\nchildren to adhere to a pattern that is biased towards Christianity.  And\nas a Christian, I *must* protest such coercion.  For what it's worth, I\nsuspect that the coercion is not really targeted at the non-Christians --\nit is yet another case of FAILURE amongst Christian parents in "making"\ntheir children prayerful, so that they want the public schools to teach\nwhat THEY cannot manage to teach, despite having all the opportunity in\nthe world to do so.\n\nIf you have taught your children to pray, they do NOT need a moment of\nsilence in school.  If you have NOT managed to teach them, the moment\nwill only embarrass you.  Give it up.

Galatians 6:7, KJV. \n    \n               "He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity; \n          he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword.  \n          Here is the patience and faith of the saints."  Revelation \n          13:10, KJV. \n    \n               "What goes around comes around."\n\n               This LAW of the Universe is just as real as the physical \n          law that for every action there is an equal and opposite \n          REaction. \n    \n               It is the ENFORCEMENT, the TEETH, behind The "GOLDEN \n          RULE": "Do unto others as you would have others do unto you." \n\n               ALL perpetrators in the present will become VICTIMS in \n          the future, most likely in a FUTURE INCARNATION.  Most \n          victims in the present were PERPETRATORS in the past, usually \n          during a PREVIOUS LIFE. \n          \n               What is needed is a MASSIVE WORLDWIDE PROGRAM of \n          EDUCATION to teach ALL present and potential perpetrators, in \n          a convincing manner (with sufficient supporting evidence), \n          that what they do to others WILL BE DONE TO THEM, in this \n          life or the next. \n          \n               Anyone who doubts the FACT of REINCARNATION, and the \n          related "LAW of Retribution", should read books such as "HERE \n          AND HEREAFTER", by Ruth Montgomery, which describes several \n          kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation, including \n          HYPNOTIC REGRESSION to past lives [about 50% accurate; the \n          subconscious mind can sometimes make things up, especially \n          with a bad hypnotist], SPONTANEOUS RECALL (especially by \n          young children, some of whom can identify their most recent \n          previous relatives, homes, possessions, etc.), DREAM RECALL \n          of past life experiences, DEJA VU (familiarity with a far off \n          land while traveling there for the first time on vacation), \n          the psychic readings of the late EDGAR CAYCE, and EVEN \n          SUPPORTING STATEMENTS FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including \n          Matthew 17:11-13 (John the Baptist was the REINCARNATION of \n          Elias.) and John 9:1-2 (How can a person POSSIBLY sin before \n          he is born, unless he LIVED BEFORE?!). \n          \n               Strong INTERESTS, innate TALENTS, strong PHOBIAS, etc., \n          typically originate from a person's PAST LIVES.  For example, \n          a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually \n          results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE.  \n          And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to \n          another person being met for the first time in their PRESENT \n          life, because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS \n          INCARNATION. \n\n               People would behave much better toward each other if \n          they knew that their actions in the present will SURELY be \n          reaped by them in the future, or in a FUTURE INCARNATION! \n\n \n               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., \n          please consult my CITED SOURCES (books like "HERE AND \n          HEREAFTER", by Ruth Montgomery). \n\n\n               UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this \n          IMPORTANT Information is ENCOURAGED.

Brian Ceccarelli presents us with the fallacy of False Dichotomy in stating\nthat we must accept every thing in the books attributed to Peter, or we must\ndiscount every other book of antiquity:\n\n\nMr Ceccarelli, you seem to be stating that we must accept accept everything\nwritten in every "historical" document.  Somehow I doubt do that yourself\nthat.  Thus since I doubt you accept everything written in every historical\ndocument, I would ask how you can thereby objectively justify complete faith\nin the words of the books attributed to Peter. \n\nI shall now give an example of a document from antiquity, which I am sure you\nreject; it dates from the time of Ramses II (This was first presented here by\nMatthew Wiener).  These inscriptions were carved soon after a battle, and were\ncarved with the Pharoah's specific approval so we have true originals, rather\nthan mere copies.  This account records the the battle of Kadesh (circa 1285\nBC), which occurred on the river Orontes, (about 100 miles south of Aleppo). \nThe Egyptians won this battle with the Hittites, and Ramses had his victory\ninscribed all over the place.  A few of of these inscriptions have survived in\nnear perfect form.  It is a record of how the Pharoah pretty much\nsingle-handedly defeated the Hittites, after being separated from his troops. \n\nNote that the Egyptian wavers back and forth between first and third person. \nThe following is from Miriam Lichtheim`s _Ancient Egyptian Literature_ volume\nII.\n\n	My majesty caused the forces of the foes from Hitti to fall\n	on their faces, one upon the other, as crocodiles fall, into\n	the water of the Orontes.  I was after them like a griffin;\n	I attacked all the countries, I alone.  For my infantry and\n	my chariotry had deserted me; not one of them stood looking\n	back.  As I live, as Ra loves me, as my father Atum favors\n	me, everything that my majesty has told I did it in truth,\n	in the presence of my infantry and my chariotry.\n\n(Note: This paragraph records not only Ramses "divine word," but also that\nthere were thousands of witnesses to the event.  Now from the heart of \nbattle.)\n\n	Then his majesty drove at a gallop and charged the forces\n	of the Foe from Hitti, being alone by himself, none other\n	with him.  His majesty proceeded to look about him and\n	found 2500 chariots ringing him on his way out ...\n\n	No officer was with me, no charioteer,\n	No soldier of the army, no shield-bearer;\n	My infantry, my chariotry yielded before them,\n	Not one of them stood firm to fight with them.\n	His majesty spoke: "What is this, father Amun?\n	Is it right for a father to ignore his son?\n	Are my deeds a matter for you to ignore?\n	Do I not walk and stand at your word?\n	I have not neglected an order you gave.\n	Too great is he, the great lord of Egypt,\n	To allow aliens to step on his path!\n	What are these Asiatics to you, O Amun,\n	The wretches ignorant of god?\n	Have I not made for you many great monuments,\n	...\n	I call to you, my father Amun,\n	I am among a host of strangers;\n	All countries are arrayed against me,\n	I am alone, there's none with me!\n	...\n	The labors of many people are nothing,\n	Amun is more helpful than they;\n	I came here by the command of your mouth,\n	O Amun, I have not transgressed your command!"\n\n	Now though I prayed in a distant land,\n	My voice resounded in Southern Thebes.\n	I found Amun came when I called to him,\n	He gave me his hand and I rejoiced.\n	He called from behind as if near by:\n	"Forward, I am with you,\n	I your father, my hand is with you,\n	I prevail over a hundred thousand men,\n	I am lord of victory, lover of valor!"\n	I found my heart stout, my breast in joy,\n	All I did succeeded, I was like Mont.\n	...\n	I slaughtered among them at my will,\n	Not one looked behind him,\n	Not one turned around,\n	Whoever fell down did not rise.\n	...\n	One called out to the other saying:\n	"No man is he who is among us,\n	It is Seth great-of-strength, Baal in person;\n	Not deeds of man are these his doings,\n	They are of one who is unique,\n	Who fights a hundred thousand without soldiers and chariots,\n	Come quick, flee before him,\n	To seek life and breathe air;\n	For he who attempts to get close to him,\n	His hands, all his limbs grow limp.\n	One cannot hold either bow or spears,\n	When one sees him come racing along!"\n	My majesty hunted them like a griffin,\n	I slaughtered among them unceasingly.\n\nSo you see Brian, we have a few original manuscripts recording the miraculous \nbattle between the Ramses and the Hittites.  Do you reject them as being\n*completely* true? I suspect you do, and if so, then do you also, in your own\nwords: \n\n    "question the existence of Alexander the Great, Tilgrath Pilisar III,\n     Nero, Caligula, Josephus, Cyrus the Great, Artexerxes?"\n\nDo you also thereby question all their documents? That`s the problem with your\n"all or nothing" approach.  Many ancient people used to mix a bit of fancy\nwith their facts.  So for you to say that we must either accept all of Peter\n(and the rest of the New Testament) or accept no records of antiquity at all,\nforces you thereby, to accept the verity of documents you probably do not find\ncompletely credible. \n\nAs to your other argument that so many people have testified to Jesus, that he\nmust be true:\n\n \nI have three points.  \n\nFirst, this is "argumentum ad populum" (ie: appeal to popular opinion); you\ncannot vote on truth.  For instance, do the millions of Hindu's past and\npresent who testify to the reality of Brahma, constitute actual evidence for\nthe existence of Brahma? How would you answer your own question in regards to\nthe testimony of Hindus:\n\n	"With a scoff of your keyboard, with near complete ignorance of \n	 the testimonies, are you going to say that that is all complete \n	 hooey?"\n\nIf you do so "scoff," then how do you objectively justify your own special\npleading?\n\nSecond, it is not at all clear that King Solomon or King David testified to\nJesus.  You can claim it to be clear, but that does not make it true. \n\nThird, it is quite arguable that Abraham Lincoln was not Christian, and that\nhe had both a public and a private view of Christianity.

[Discussion on Josephus inserts]\n\nThanks.  Am I correct, then, in assuming that that Josephus\ndid in fact write about Jesus, but Christian copists embellished it?
[Note the "Followup-To" redirect(s) to alt.conspiracy,talk.politics.misc.]\n\n(Timothy J Brent) said in response to P.VASILION:\n\n\n(1) You have no evidence that David Koresh or his followers were\n"packing" that heavy weaponry with any intent to use for other that\nrecreational and self-defense purposes.\n\n(2) Your statement that "the public also has rights" is correct only is\nparsed as "the individuals who comprise the public also have rights."\nThere is no separate rights-bearing entity known as "the public".\n\n(3) Since the "rights of the public" of which you spoke are in fact only\nrights of individuals, the statement that the rights of the public\nshould be placed above the rights of the individual has no meaning.\n\n(4) You have artificially created an illusionary conflict of\nindividuals' rights when you speak of "my right to rape your daughter."\nNo person has the right to rape another person, therefore there is no\nconflict.\n\n(5) How do you define "society?"  Do you hold that this "society" is a\nrights-bearing entity which is separate from any individual people?  How\ndo you define a "threat to society?"  To what extent do you believe that\na person loses his rights when he is declared (by whom?) to be such a\nthreat?
My theory is that Koresh was seriously wounded in the initial gunbattle\nand died on Day 9 of the siege.  On Day 11 of the siege he rose from the\ndead and periodically appeared to his followers and the FBI over the\nnext 40 days.  Living with someone who's risen from the dead isn't easy,\nas Timmy Baterman's father in *Pet*Sematary* could attest, so after 40\ndays they did what Baterman did--shot themselves and burned the place\nto the ground.\n\nConsistent with the facts, isn't it?  Did anyone actually *see* Koresh\nbetween Day 9 and Day 11?
#Recently, I've asked myself a rather interesting question: What RIGHT does\n#god have on our lives (always assuming there is a god, of course...!) ??\n#\n#In his infinite wisdom, he made it perfectly clear that if we don't live\n#according to his rules, we will burn in hell. Well, with what RIGHT can god\n#make that desicion? Let's say, for the sake of argument, that god creates\n#every one of us (directly or indirectly, it doesn't matter.). What then\n#happens, is that he first creates us, and then turns us lose. Well, I didn't\n#ask to be created.\n#\n#Let's make an analogue. If a scientist creates a unique living creature\n#(which has happened, it was even patented...!!!), does he then have the\n#right to expect it to behave in a certain matter, or die...?\n\nDear Joakim, let me begin by saying that these are excellent questions,\nbut that by asking, you will find as many different explanations as there\nare respondents.  As a Latter-day Saint, I believe that all of us (you,\nme, etc.) lived once as spirit-children of God the Father (Hebrews 12:9)\nin the pre-mortal existance. In order to continue our eternal progression,\nan earthly probationary time was required.  (To live by faith, not by\nsight, to choose good over evil, and to prepare ourselves in all things\nto become worthy of a higher order of existance.)  We believe that all of\nGod's spirit-offspring were once assembled to discuss the specifics of\nthis earthly sojourn.  One-third chose for Lucifer's plan, most followed\nthe Firstborn (the pre-mortal Jesus Christ).  Lucifer's aspirations ("I\nwill exalt my throne above the stars of God . . ." Isaiah 14:12-17, etc.)\nresulted into the rebellion of his followers against the Firstborn and\nthose who followed Him, resulting in the casting out of Lucifer (who\nbecame Satan, the father of lies) and one-third of the hosts of heaven\n("And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast\nthem to the earth . . ." Revelation 12:4) as demons (evil spirits).\n\nTo get back on OUR choice to be born on this earth, and to be subject to\nGod and His plan (for good or bad, based upon our obedience and choices),\nwe made that choice individually.  (God speaking to Job: "Where wast thou\nwhen I laid the foundations of the earth, . . . when the morning stars\nsang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?" Job 38:4-7).  We\nlost the knowledge of our pre-mortal existance (the "Veil of Forgetful-\nness," somewhere in Psalms), in order to live by faith, not by sight.\n\nYou may not accept this scenario, neither do quite a few who rely on the\nBible alone, which offers only fragmentary insights into this particular\naspect of our existence as individuals, as sons and daughters of God.\n\n#Who is god to impose its rules on us ? Who can tell if god is REALLY so\n#righteous as god likes us to believe? Are all christians a flock of sheep,\n#unable to do otherwise that follow the rest?\n#\n#Hmmmmmmmmmmmm.\n\n(All Christians, by definition, ARE a flock of sheep, following the Shepherd\nas they understand Him  ;-)  --But in any event, not all Christians believe\nin the same theology, such as the one Latter-day Saints believe in.  (They\nwill cry "heresy" and other accusations of "perverting" the doctrines of\nthe Bible, while they themselves believe in a myriad of interpretations, as\nfound in their catechisms and various do-it-yourself Bible-study manuals...)\n\nAs for me, I have a personal conviction that the pre-existance scenario as\nexplained above, is most in harmony with Biblical doctrine, some Dead Sea\nScroll books, the pseudographion, other (Jewish) sources, and last but not\nleast, modern-day revelation on the subject.\n\n#I just want to point out that this is not sarcasm, I mean it.\n#\n#                        How should one deal with a man who is convinced that\n#                        he is acting according to God's will, and who there-\n#     Jokke              fore believes that he is doing you a favour by\n#                        stabbing you in the back?\n#\n#                                                        -Voltaire
But neither of them claimed to have experimental evidence that proved \nthem right. In a similar vein, there is as yet no experimental evidence\nfor supersymmetric particles; so some physicists believe in them, and\nsome don't -- but all agree that either there is an objectively true\nanswer to the question.\n\n--\nMark Pundurs
Wow, this is news to me---it started in Tarsus--you know, where Paul\nof NT fame was from.  Not to be nasty, but get a clue, read\n_The Orgins of the Mithraic Mysteries_ by DUlansey!\n \nHey hasn't anyone read Manly P Hall's works?  Perhaps it might be\nworth a try....

When Robert refers to the "orthodox", he is talking about the Historical\nposition of the Christian Faith. Such things are derived from Biblcal\ntexts through the centuries by the apocolic fathers of the faith.\n\nYou are right that people read things differently in the Bible, and this\nis alright in parts like parables and such forth. However, when it comes\nto the essential doctrines of the Historical Orthodox Christan Beliefs,\nthere is only one correct way to read it. For example, either the\ndoctrine of the Trinity is true, or it is false. Yes, people read the\ntexts differently, but only one position is true. They both cannot be.\nAccording to the text, the doctrine is true and has always existed.
