From article <1r19l9$7dv@usenet.INS.CWRU.Edu>, by oldham@ces.cwru.edu (Daniel Oldham):\n\nThey did have the proper equipment.  The problem is that they went about\nthings the wrong way.  The ATF should have served the warrant in a\npeacable manner instead of going in there like a bunch of Rambos with\nguns blazing.  I'm not trying to excuse what David Koresh did.  I'm\njust saying that the ATF (henceforth to be known as the cigarette cops :-)\nwent about the "raid" in an improper manner.\n\n\nLet the FBI, Customs, and local police officers do the ATF's job.  WE\nDON'T NEED THEM ANYMORE!!!  The cigarette cops are just leftovers\nfrom Prohibition days.  They are an anachronism!\n\n\nIncluding you?  What if the cigarette cops kicked down your door and\ncut you in half with a machine gun?  THIS COULD ACTUALLY HAPPEN.\nMaybe they get the wrong address and then raid *your* home, for example.\nIt's happened before and it can happen *again*.  I have heard of more\nthan one instance of a no-knock raid going sour.  Just recently I\nheard about a case in which police raided this guy's home because they\nthought he had dope or something.  The guy blew both of the officers\naway and he didn't go to jail for it.  The judge hearing the case\nruled that the man was acting in self-defense.\n\n\nAre you sure that that would have been the way to go?  Surely the FBI\nand ATF could have handled this fiasco better.  They didn't have to\nmassacre all those people.  As Stimpy said in "Fake Dad", "Shame, shame,\ndouble shame!"  The FBI and ATF should be ashamed of theirselves. \n\n\nScott Kennedy,  Brewer and Patriot
I keep hearing people say this.  It assumes that we, at some point,\n	had a choice at the ballot box: "Vote yes or no I want the FBI\n	and BATF to become latter-day Gestapos".  That just isn't so.\n	The process is far more complex.  We do not have direct control over\n	the bureaucracy.  When we evaluate our representatives we don't often\n	know what their contribution is to the wayward direction of the\n	federal law enforcement bureacracy.  To assert that we got what\n	we wanted is absurd.  \n\n	Oh, good I feel much better now. ;-)
Shit, i'm going to be a lot more carefull filling by income tax!
The Associated Press had an article on Monday March 1, I believe,\nwhich quoted witnesses as describing BATF agents throwing grenades prior\nto any gunfire on the part of the Davidians.\n\n       It was among the first of a crop of different, mutually exclusive\ndescriptions.
And  \n\nAnd Bejing = Peking, who cares about native tongue, as long as we all  \nunderstand each other.\n\n\nOh, not more than a few feet, I wouldn't think.  I'm sorry IF your paternal  \ngrandparents died in Oswiecym or Aushwitz, which is easier to say than prove,  \nbut if so, the lesson they paid thier lives for was wasted on you.\n\n\nYou are the expert.  I often feel compelled to brag about the circumstances of  \nmy grandparent's death.  8-}\n\n\nA BATF offense, if true.\n\n\nA LOCAL offense, if true.  Totally outside the BATF's domain.\n\n\nI didn't know the man.  Just what the TV chose to tell me.\n\n\nI thought there were prejudicial undertones here.  I would trust my daughter's  \njudgement.\n\n\nI don't believe either side blindly.\n\nIF they fired first, without announcing in a beleivable way who they were ( I  \ncan pound on your door and claim to be the police, will you just lay down and  \ntake it if I do?), then he could be justified in firing on the ATF in  \nself-defense.\n\n\n"His background"?  What law has he been convicted of breaking in the past?\n\nJim\n--\njmd@handheld.com
My god, a sane person!  Somebody asking intelligent questions rather\nthan spouting of unsubstantiated drivel and making comparisons to Nazi\nGermany.  I question, along with others, the initial raid by the ATF.\nThere are some definite questions needing answers.\n\n\n	Probably.  Which is why there are so many people angry at the\ninitial confrontation.  Why attack a compound with as many people in that\ncompound who are willing to die for their leader?  Further, they attacked\nin the daylight hours without proper backup, medical support, etc.  That\nwas rather stupid...\n\n\n	This I doubt.  While I question the ATF's initial raid, I believe\nthat the remainder of the standoff was handled fairly well with the single\nexception of the psychological "warfare" by blaring music, etc.  I think\nthat was uncalled for and probably hindered the outcome.\n\n\n	See above...\n\n\n	Agreed.\n\n\n	Which is actually rather refreshing nowadays.  Most of the time, the\nhigher-ups claim "I don't remember..." or "I had no involvement..."  :-)

Did\nanybody catch Rep. Charles Shumer on the news last night holding up\na .50 BMG cartridge and rhetorically asking if anybody should be allowed\nto own one of these.  (I presume he meant the rifle for which it is chambered\nand not the cartridge which you can get for a buck.)\n\n  So what's your guess for the upcoming anti-gun agenda:\n\n1.   A ban on heavy caliber rifles. (read .50 BMG)\n\n2.   A ban on "sniper rifles"\n\n3. A ban on "stockpiling" guns and ammunition.\n\n\nBTW: Shumer is perhaps the most misinformed congressman I have seen on\n     the news.

This was reported in Canadian papers Thursday, 22 April - I _think_ the\nsource was UPI, but don't recall for certain.\n\n\n\nI understand that at least two goverment investigations have been ordered,\nso we may learn more during their hearings. \n\n\nTough call without more investigation, but if the thermal imaging story\nholds up, I think the government will be more credable... of course,\nparanoia fans won't believe their results anyway, will they?\n\n\nHear, hear! I'd also like to see the autopsy reports confirm news reports\nthat multiple victims were found shot (in the head), and in positions\ninconsistent with fire victims. It is simply too early to draw conclusions\neither way about this nasty incident, but I tend to believe the government\nside.
mcsdc1jpb@dct.ac.uk (John Bell) babbles from Scotland, one of England's\nlast remaining colonies:\n\n\n\nPeople who were dumb enough to believe Klinton was a moderate deserve what\nthey get too.  It's a real laugh to hear them try to justify this massacre\nwith bullsh*t about how concerned they were about how our tax money was\nwas being spent.  (Wasting money keeping Texans alive?  Hell no. let's\nspend it to import Haitians with AIDS so we can treat them at taxpayer\nexpense.  %^P  )\n\n\nSo what?  The Feds killed 90+ civilians when they "ran out of patience", to use\ntheir own phrase.  If the Feds hadn't attacked them, they'd all be home eating \ndinner with their families tonight.  Too bad, but they started it.  Maybe\nnext time they'll think twice.  That's worth 4 stormtroopers.\n\n\nNobody says he is.  What he was was a victim of a left-wing government,\nthat violated its pledge to protect and uphold the Constitution, run amok.  \nDon't worry, though dweeb, we're gonna take it back.  (Hey, I'm a white guy,\nbut would it be OK if I quoted Malcolm X here, and said "by any means \nnecessary"?  Nah, never mind.  We can do this legally...\n\n\nNO, you're just a brainless f*cking trogladyte.  Go beat up some soccer\nfans.  Ignorance is bliss, so drool on with that stupid smile on your \nface when people die needlessly. I hope a badger climbs up your kilt.\n\n(Don't expect these UKies to care about this, folks...  these bastards\nnever did like the idea that we Americans had the means to defend ourselves \nand wouldn't stand for tyranical governments, which is why we sent them packing \nback to their dreary little island with their tails between their legs twice.)
When I might possibly be on the receiving end of a violent gesture, \n	then *I* get to decide for myself.  If someone does not like it, too\n	bad.  I would be doing exactly what YOU  or any other living creature\n	would do in terms of evaluation.  What's the big deal?\n\n\n	Sometimes.\n\n\n	I might.\n\n\n	Not in my experience.  And let us not forget that context is often an\n	important factor in evaluating a situation.  Seeing disheveled persons\n	on a hiking trail is not likely to be evaluated equally with meeting\n	a grimey sort, as described above, on a lonely city street at 3 am.\n	Anyone that cannot properly discriminate between these two different\n	situations is legitimate fodder for the old "survival of the fittest" \n	principle.\n\n\n	Sounds like you doubt your own abilities.  You sound pretty\n	typical in this respect.  You also seem to think that you'll\n	be safe or safer if others are unarmed.  This is dangerous \n	fantasy.\n\n\n	Then you are in need of some form of therapy.  Not necessarily that\n	of an analyst, but maybe you should learn about guns.  Your fear is\n	seems to be based in ignorance and false knowledge.  You see a person\n	with a gun and you feel threatened.  Why is this so?  Have you any\n	legitimate basis for this?  Any first-hand experience that lends\n	validity to your fears?  Or are your fears based on mediated experience,\n	i.e. the anecdotes of others such as network news?  I trust you can\n	see the lack of legitimacy in such mediated inputs?\n\n	And why are you afraid of the PEOPLE as mentioned above?  Forgive me,\n	but you sound afraid to the point of paranoia.  Perhaps you should talk\n	to someone about this.  I am not saying this to be rude or fascetious,\n	but I think anyone with fear as deep and baseless as yours *seems* to\n	be needs some sort of help.  Living in fear really sucks, even if it\n	is only when around people with guns in the back country.\n\n	Tell me: would you be as fearful of a park ranger who was right in \n	front of you with their side arm in clear view?  Why or why not?
Not necessarily. If the body had been denatured (cooked) or dehydrated due\nto the heat, a projectile needs only a minimal kinetic force to penetrate.\nIn fire aftermaths, bodies tend to fall apart or loose large chunks of\nmeat with little effort. Medical Examiners tend not to like cleaning up\nsuch scenes. \n\nAs such, if the body had been suitably cooked, a bullet comming from a\nmagazine explosion would more than likely have enough force to enter and\nthus it would be difficult to determine whether a bullet entered at the\ntime of death, or much later, unless you were trained to look for the\nevidence. Texas Rangers are not pathologists.
You can't think of any valid reason to own a gun that can't wait?\n\nEither you have a very limited imagination or a strange definition of\nthe word "valid".\n\nHere are a few reasons you might want a gun *right now*:\n\nYou're a Korean greengrocer in LA and a riot has just started in a\nnearby neighborhood.\n\nYou've received a death threat.\n\nYour SO has just broken your arm and you fear for your life if you\nstay with him and he's said he'll kill you if you leave him.\n\nA psychopath is breaking into people's houses in your neighborhood and\nrobbing and killing people inside.\n\nA violent mugger is operating on the route you have to take to get to\nyour night job.\n\nThere are lots of dangers you might be in that won't wait for the\nwaiting period for you to purchase a gun.
It appears it is time that this article (originally posted by Larry\nCipriani last year, and which I saved) gets posted again.

(Flames to /dev/null)\n\n--------- Begin Enclosed Article -----------\n\n			THE UNABRIDGED SECOND AMENDMENT\n\n			      by J. Neil Schulman\n\nIf you wanted to know all about the Big Bang, you'd ring up Carl Sagan,\nright ?  And if you wanted to know about desert warfare, the man to call\nwould be Norman Schwarzkopf, no question about it.  But who would you call\nif you wanted the top expert on American usage, to tell you the meaning\nof the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ?\n\nThat was the question I asked A.C. Brocki, editorial coordinator of the Los\nAngeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at Houghton\nMifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the\nforemost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system.  Mr.\nBrocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud, a retired professor\njournalism at the University of Southern California and the author of\n"American Usage and Style: The Consensus."\n\nA little research lent support to Brocki's opinion of Professor Copperud's\nexpertise.\n\nRoy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades\nbefore embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at\nUSC.  Since 1952, Copperud has been writing a column dealing with the\nprofessional aspects of journalism for "Editor and Publisher", a weekly\nmagazine focusing on the journalism field.\n\nHe's on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, and Merriam\nWebster's Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert.  Copperud's\nfifth book on usage, "American Usage and Style: The Consensus," has been in\ncontinuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981, and is the winner\nof the Association of American Publisher's Humanities Award.\n\nThat sounds like an expert to me.\n\nAfter a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introduced\nmyself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested, I sent\nthe following letter:\n\n"I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in\nEnglish usage, to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution, and extract the intent from the text.\n\n"The text of the Second Amendment is, 'A well-regulated Militia, being\nnecessary for the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep\nand bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'\n\n"The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the\nsentence, 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a\nfree State', is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause, with respect\nto the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence, 'the\nright of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'\n\n"I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into\nconsideration issues of political impact or public policy, but be restricted\nentirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent.  Further,\nsince your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation\nregarding the consequences of the Second Amendment, I ask that whatever\nanalysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to\nstand behind with your reputation, and even be willing to testify under\noath to support, if necessary."\n\nMy letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment,\nthen concluded:\n\n"I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task\nwith this letter.  I am doing so because, as a citizen, I believe it is\nvitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment.\nWhile I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of\nits results, I ask that you do this because of that importance."\n\nAfter several more letters and phone calls, in which we discussed terms for\nhis doing such an analysis, but in which we never discussed either of our\nopinions regarding the Second Amendment, gun control, or any other political\nsubject, Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which I have\ninserted my questions for the sake of clarity):\n\n[Copperud:] "The words 'A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the\nsecurity of a free state,' contrary to the interpretation cited in your\nletter of July 26, 1991, constitutes a present participle, rather than a\nclause.  It is used as an adjective, modifying 'militia,' which is\nfollowed by the main clause of the sentence (subject 'the right', verb\n'shall').  The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for\nmaintaining a militia.\n\n"In reply to your numbered questions:\n\n[Schulman:] "(1) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep\nand bear arms solely to 'a well-regulated militia'?"\n\n[Copperud:] "(1) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear\narms, nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by\nothers than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respect\nto a right of the people."\n\n[Schulman:] "(2) Is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms' granted\nby the words of the Second Amendment, or does the Second Amendment assume a\npreexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms, and merely state\nthat such right 'shall not be infringed'?"\n\n[Copperud:] "(2) The right is not granted by the amendment; its existence\nis assumed.  The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be\npreserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia."\n\n[Schulman:] "(3) Is the right of the people to keep and bear arms\nconditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia, is, in fact\nnecessary to the security of a free State, and if that condition is not\nexisting, is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,\nshall not be infringed' null and void?"\n\n[Copperud:] "(3) No such condition is expressed or implied.  The right to\nkeep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence\nof a militia.  No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the\nright to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated\nmilitia as a requisite to the security of a free state.  The right to keep\nand bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence."\n\n[Schulman:] "(4) Does the clause 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary\nto the security of a free State,' grant a right to the government to place\nconditions on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms,' or is such\nright deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence?"\n\n[Copperud:] "(4) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional, as\npreviously stated.  It is invoked here specifically for the sake of the\nmilitia."\n\n[Schulman:] "(5) Which of the following does the phrase 'well-regulated\nmilitia' mean: 'well-equipped', 'well-organized,' 'well-drilled,'\n'well-educated,' or 'subject to regulations of a superior authority'?"\n\n[Copperud:] "(5) The phrase means 'subject to regulations of a superior\nauthority;' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian\ncontrol over the military."\n\n[Schulman:] "(6) (If at all possible, I would ask you to take account the\nchanged meanings of words, or usage, since that sentence was written 200\nyears ago, but not take into account historical interpretations of the\nintents of the authors, unless those issues can be clearly separated."\n\n[Copperud:] "To the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in the\nmeaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the\namendment.  If it were written today, it might be put: "Since a\nwell-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state, the\nright of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.'\n\n[Schulman:] "As a 'scientific control' on this analysis, I would also\nappreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the Second\nAmendment to the following sentence,\n\n"A well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the security of a free\nState, the right of the people to keep and read Books, shall not be\ninfringed.'\n\n"My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be,\n\n"(1) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way\nthe words modify each other, identical to the Second Amendment's sentence?;\nand\n\n"(2) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the people\nto keep and read Books' _only_ to 'a well-educated electorate' -- for\nexample, registered voters with a high-school diploma?"\n\n[Copperud:] "(1) Your 'scientific control' sentence precisely parallels the\namendment in grammatical structure.\n\n"(2) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the\npossibility of a restricted interpretation."\n\nProfessor Copperud had only one additional comment, which he placed in his\ncover letter: "With well-known human curiosity, I made some speculative\nefforts to decide how the material might be used, but was unable to reach\nany conclusion."\n\nSo now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage what\nmany knew all along: the Constitution of the United States unconditionally\nprotects the people's right to keep and bear arms, forbidding all\ngovernments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right.\n\nAs I write this, the attempted coup against constitutional government in the\nSoviet Union has failed, apparently because the will of the people in that\npart of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the\nold guard's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power.\n\nAnd here in the United States, elected lawmakers, judges, and appointed\nofficials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States\nignore, marginalize, or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely.\nAmerican citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms, owning\narms of forbidden sorts, or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements\nregarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an\nabridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms,\nguaranteed by the Constitution.\n\nAnd even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), staunch defender of the\nrest of the Bill of Rights, stands by and does nothing.\n\nit seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to\npreserve that right.  no one else will.  No one else can.  Will we beg our\nelected representatives not to take away our rights, and continue regarding\nthem as representing us if they do?  Will we continue obeying judges who\ndecide that the Second Amendment doesn't mean what it says it means but\nmeans whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak ?\n\nOr will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice, as the Constitution\nof the United States promises us we can, and pledge that we will defend\nthat promise with our lives, our fortuned, and our sacred honor ?\n\n(C) 1991 by The New Gun Week and Second Amendment Foundation.\nInformational reproduction of the entire article is hereby authorized\nprovided the author, The New Gun Week and Second Amendment Foundation are\ncredited.

There was at least one blast consistent with petroleum products that I\nsaw, however propane is interesting stuff.  It doesn't explode on contact with\nair.  It is *possible* for a tank to rupture without exploding.  Far more\nlikely, however, is that the compound was equipped with NG outlets running to\nthe tank.  Damage from the CEV's could have ruptured the gas lines, allowing\nthe gas to spread, unnoticed in the CS fumes and general excitement (propane\ntypically has a distinctive odor added to it for just this reason -- to smell\nleaks), until reaching a flame or spark, and then Whooosh!  Fire everywhere,\nand maybe an explosion.  Use of NG is pretty common in Texas, especially\nsemi-rural areas.\n\n\n  This is true, but so far the FBI/BATF track record on this incident is very\nbad.\n\n\n  I think it would have disarmed many people if the FBI followed this same\npolicy.  They have not.  They are making claims without evidence, and what\nevidence we have so far tends to refute their story.\n\nsemper fi,
This is quite corect, but a bullet hitting a burned body with little energy\nwill show virtually no deformation, ie a hollow point probably would not\nexpand, an FMJ would be "pristene".

This is, apparently, what passes for intelligent discourse at Trinity.\nJoe "FBI cultist" Kusmierczak gets angry when its pointed out that\nthe FBI has told him is a LIE, the mounting evidence is that \nthey've lied about almost every detail of 4/19 except that they\nwere there. What can you expect of cultists like him, somebody\noughtta burn him out, and if he's trapped, well, good riddance!\nRight Joe?
Today the Texas ME found two people, a man and a woman shot in the head\ninside the burned compound. But these were not the people that the FBI\ndescribed a few days before. The FBI said that the person found in front of\nthe compound had been shot and several children were also. The two people\nfound today were on top of the main inside concrete bunker that provided\nthe most protection during the fire. So the comment that children were\nshot is still not proved.

Remember me, Tom?  I hope you'll respond, and I seem to\nbe a Voice of Reason or some such (I've been recieving fan mail,\nso naturally my ego is somehwat inflated of late), and hope to\nmake a few points here.\n\n\n	And our argument is that you cannot remove them from the people\nwho need restricting and not remove them from the people who don't.  A\nfairly simple problem, given our size and numbers.  Do you agree?  We\nall believe criminals, particularly violent criminals, should not have\nfirearms.  The problem is making a law that does this without trodding\nupon the rights of the vast majority.  Nobody here seems to be able to\ndo it, and I doubt anybody in Norway can either.  Thus, we are left with\na philosophical difference: does the safety of a few justify restricting\nthe many?  We say "no," while others say "yes."\n\n\n	Can you provide a method that cannot be abused?  I doubt it.\n\n\n	Of course.  This is not in contention.  What is in contention\nis how much one has to pay.\n\n\n	It is this "giving a little" that makes Americans wary...\nWe have seen this argument before.  You might remember how a\nChamberlain "gave a little" to a particular fascist/short asshole,\nand how such "appeasement" worked.  While it might work in some\ninstances, it doesn't work in others, and since we cannot predict\nthe future we must be cautious in using actions that have a\nhistory of failure.\n\n\n	Cars are not essential in Norway any more than they are in\nthe USA.  I'm willing to bet that you have neighbors that would be\nwilling to drive you anywhere you wanted to go for a price.  Thus,\ncars are not essential for your transportation.  However, the\narguments presented show that, since cars are used to kill far more\npeople than guns in the USA, it makes much more sense to restrict\ncars than it does guns.  How one defines "essential" often depends\nupon what one is willing to go through for that service.  When we\nlook at the raw data, such comparisons are not individually weighed.\n\n\n	This depends upon what the populace was willing to do.  As\nDesert Storm proved, even an armed populace won't just revolt even\nwhen given a chance.  Still, would Hitler have done all that he did\nwith an armed populace?  We have to wonder, as some of his first\nacts were to confiscate firearms.  Other points in history show\nthat dictators were overthrown by arms in the hands of the populace.\nThus, we're left wondering if Hitler would have been overthrown\nor if King George was just unlucky in keeping the USA as a colony.\nOne can argue both sides; one also has to live with each action.\n\n\n	It is about #2, but so far all proposals to curtail #2 have\nwound up enforcing #1 as well.  I only wish that "or" was so logical.\n\n\n	That was, on my part, purely in jest.  I merely pointed out\nhow we were from similar backgrounds racially, but of wholly different\nbackgrounds politically.  I thought this would underscore my point on\nhow our cultures were so different despite similar heritage.\n\n\n	BATF can *only* enforce gun/tobaccco/alcohol violations.  Child\nabuse is a matter for the individual states and local authorities.\n\n\n	That hierarchy is a paid-for feed at many sites.  Most people do\nnot get it for this reason, and I suspect money, not censorship, is the\nmain reason.  Do you get alt.sex* at your site?  I can't read it here\nbecause of censorship and legal fears, so again our differences show.\nYou have topless sunbathing, and in the USA we can watch a murder every\nfifteen seconds and yet breasts are forbidden on television.
You are talking about the man who as a federal attorney did so\nmuch to frustrate the proper investigation of the JFK assassination by\nthe House sub-committee on assassinations.  Fox and hen house???
This is my first time on the network, but I am very concerned with this\nincident in Waco.  I will refrain from stating my opinions until after I have\nread the FAQ.

From article <1r492jINN5fo@charnel.ecst.csuchico.edu>, by nomad@ecst.csuchico.edu (Michael Larish):\n\nI take it that when something happens that is wrong it's okay if\na bunch of people say it is?  For instance, if some people go on a\nmurderous rampage and lynch some blacks and then a poll is taken which\nshows that the majority of people think that this is acceptable then\ndoes this mean that what these people have done isn't bad?  This is an\nexample of mob rule not a democracy---a democracy in which people's\nrights are protected.  I hope that I've made myself clear on this.\n\n\nFine...you have the right to hold any opinion that you want to.  But,\nlet me ask you this:  are you outraged over this tragedy?

Here goes:\n\nMore than a few years back (if you were born that year, you can legally drink),\nwe tried it out.  We found an 8 ft. deep cistern that we lined with some 10 ft.\n2X6s.  We put a large can (one of those industrial sized pork'n beans cans)\nstuffed with oily rags and scraps of wood in the bottom.  After lighting the\nfire, we LOWERED a box of .38 Spc. SWCs into the can.  We heard pops, one solid\nbang and several "fizzzz shussss".  After we thought the excitment was over, we\nboldly climbed down to find that NONE of the bullets had left the can, several\nof the shells were lieing around the bottom of the well and the boards had all\ndied of smoke inhalation.  And 5 or 6 of the shells still had live primers!

The lethality in small part, but mostly what I found frightening \nwas the fact that they were wielded by people who believed that they \nate breakfast every morning with Jesus Christ. Now I wasn't there in \nGalilee back in the Roman occupation, so I don't know for certain that \nDavid Koresh was not Jesus Christ, but I strongly suspect that he was \nnot (even aside from the fact of never having seen them in a photograph \ntogether).\n\n\n    I admit I can't cite a specific, but if there isn't a law against \npurchasing grenade components and assembling them into functioning units \nthen perhaps we need one. All second ammendment arguments aside, I'm just \nnot sure that I like the idea of private citizens with hand grenades.

The suggestion that they Davidians committed suicide is\ncompletely without evidence.  Except for the editorials...\n\nPlease re-word.  "propensity for allegedly dousing themselves".\n\nOh, and the survivors claim the the FBI started the burning\nby accidentally igniting kerosene lanterns (remember that they'd\nalready cut the power), and the propane tanks.  This sounds\na lot more likely than committing suicide by setting the place\nafire.\n\n--D
What does this bill do?\n\n\nMcD
This whole thread is rediculous.  Who cares if they had a stove going\nor not.  Does it matter if they had a stove burning, or lanterns\nburning, or candles burning, or someone smoking, etc, etc, etc.  The\npremise is that the FBI was filling the house with napalm so that it\nwould catch fire.  This is crazy.  FBI was NOT PUMPING NAPALM into the\nDavidians home.  You will have to have pretty damn strong evidence to\nconvince me of that.\n\nI can believe mass suicide/murder by Koresh.  I can believe an\naccident by the Davidians.  I can believe an accident by the FBI.  I\ncan easily believe mass stupidity on all sides but I can not believe\nthat the FBI lit this fire intentionally.  No way.
"I have no question that our plan was correct?"  Months to\nget ready, unlimited funds, knowledge of a threatened mass suicide by fire,\nand no fire trucks on hand?   This is "extreme professionalism and care?"\n\n      I can understand the first screwed-up raid by the BATF.  They\nunderestimated the opposition, which happens.  But not this one.  \nThe FBI had their first team in place, massive resources, ample time \nfor planning and bringing up any specialized equipment or people necessary.  \nThey still botched it.\n\n      The FBI Director and the FBI SAC in overall charge should resign,\nor be fired for incompetence.\n\n      I don't blame Reno or Clinton.  They gave the FBI clear orders:\ndon't go in unless you can do it without casualties; if you can't do that,\nwait it out.  Those were reasonable orders.  The FBI said they could\npull off a tactical solution, and they couldn't.
Boston Globe, Wednesday April 21 1993\n\ncol. 4  "Bodies found in ruins as FBI defends raid on cult ranch"\ncol. 5 "Clinton blames Koresh, orders probe of siege"\ncol. 2 "The children: panws in a horrifying game"\n\npg. 18, col. 1, Editorial page  \n	"Judgment at Waco"\n\n	Now the scientific and political scrutiny of the\nhorror show in Waco begins, though nothing can\nundo the tragedy that might have been prevented \nthere.\n	Forensic experts will study the rubble and\nashes of the Branch Davidian compound, where at\nleast 85 people, including 24 children, perished in\nsmoke and fire caused by theapocalyptic visions of\na manipulative madman AND A STUNNING LAPSE IN\nJUDGMENT BY FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS.\n   [emphasis added by me]\n	Investigators will re-create conditions at the\ncompound and identify accelerants and other fac-\ntors fueling the inferno.  That is their strong suit.\n	But the public must question why agents of the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation lacked the oper-\national skill and teh behavioral insight to resolve\nthe 51-day standoff free of flames and fury.\n	The loss of life most clearly reflects the demen-\ntia of cult leader David Koresh, whose personal\ndelusiosn are now seared on the public conscious-\nness.  His assembly of Davidians had stockpiles of\narms--and had used them.  LIttle in the way of\nrationality could be expected from Koresh, a self-\nconfsesed "sinner without equal."\n	What continues to mystify are th eactions of\nfederal agents, who bungled the case from the\nstart.  The misadventure began on Feb. 28 when\n100 agents of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, To-\nbacco and Firearms storemd the compound, intent\non seizing Koresh and a cache of automatic weap-\nons.  Four agents and an estimated  six cult mem-\nbers died inteh ensuing gun battle.  Earlier\noppor-tunities to isolate and arrest Koresh outside the\ncomplex had not been adequately explored.\n	Authorities prepared a siege and resolved that\nthose deaths would be the last.  Fifty-one days into \nthe siege there was no public outcry to storm the\ncompound.\n	It had been correctly perceived that the chil-\ndren inside "Rancho Apocalypse" were essentially \nhostages.  With their lives at stake, there was no\nreason for the government to be impatient.  The\ngovernment's superior firepower, control of water\nand utilities and freedom of movement created the\nconditions for a belated but bloodless resolution.\n	Neither Attorney General Janet Reno nor the\nFBI has provided a sigle compelling reason for\nabandondoning the course of patience.\n	If intelligence was accurate and Koresh was\ngrowing increasingly violent and bizarre, it is diffi-\ncult to see how a tear-gas attack launched by an\nM-60 combat vehicle would clear his mind.  If re-\nports of escalating child abuse were accurate, they\nwould have to be weighted against the potential for\neve ngreated hamr.\n\n\netc etc tec....\n[paragraphs, 2.5 paragraphs deleted]\n\nBut some of the responsibility rests with Clinton,\nand inexperienced president who did not pay\nenough attention to the life-and -death decisions\nbeing made on WAco.\n	If Reno is to be faulted for anything, ti would\nbe for her overreliance on the judgment of law en-\nforcement officers--a common problem among\nprosecutors.\n	Full investigations into th eWaco tragedy must\nbe conducted by both the executive and legislative\nbranches.  The first step is to verify how the blaze \nstarted.  Though apportioning blame will play a \nrole, it is of greater importnace to find strategies\nto elude the fire next time.
I doubt if Koresh had let the BATF have a look inside his place as they \nintended to do, "orchestrated character assassination, noise torture, and\na holocaust" would never have come to pass.\n\nThe BD's killed members of the BATF on the first day. "Orchestrated character\nassassination and noise torture" seem like a small retribution.  The use\nof tanks is quesionable however.\n\n\n\n--Abhijit

If in said situation. I would, reviewing other cases I've seen reported\non in the articles I've read etc.., suggest the safest legal course of action\nis as follows. Warn your assailant loudly and in clear tones that you have a \nweapon(Yes!Even though it's blatantly obvious now that you have it out!)\nand that you will shoot him if he advances/does not cease whatever hostile \naction he is currently involved in.( ie: Drop the knife or I'll shoot!)\nRepeat this process three times,if you can!(not if he's pointing a freaking\ngun at you himself!That's kinda impractical.) (There are variables here and\nI will try to address them in turn) After said warning (considering it's\n ignored) Aim center mass and fire until he drops! This is not sadism, it's\npracticality.If he hasn't gone down he's still a threat!(Why I support .45)\nIF HE TURNS AND RUNS DO NOT PURSUE OR FIRE AT HIS BACK! SHOT'S FIRED IN ANGER\nWILL BURN YOU LATER! (Though in some cases the I can see where that might not\nbother me all that much!) If you do drop him! REMAIN WHERE YOU ARE! Have a\nBystander or witness(Or Create one by yelling at the top of your lungs!)\ncall the police, and wait! Reholster your weapon VISIBLY! Or place it on \nthe ground nearby. Do not attempt to recollect your brass.The police will\nuse it's location to piece together the scene along with your testimony and\nthat of any witnesses. Mentally mark witnesses! If the police say that none\ncame forward let them know who you saw! Attempt to keep your weapon loaded\nwith the minimum required(how the hell can I phrase this?) Try to avoid special\npurpose ammunition. Hollow points and Hydrashock rounds give the opposing\nlawyer the type of loaded phrasing he will need to sawy the jury that you\nfully intended to kill someone! The only special purpose rounds that I can\nthink of that would actually help your case (as it has in several) is the\nGlaser Safety Slug (oh what a lovely name SAFETY SLUG) The stated purpose\nand stated design parameters of the round are life savers in court.\n(ie. Attempting to create a bullet which will not overpenetrate, not \nricochette, and which is designed to STOP (Not Kill (Gee, to bad the two often\ncross, damn I'm real sorry that rapist is dead! NOT!) an assailant with\none shot. This, again, can be a real life saver in a hostile court.\nBe as cooperative with the police as possible! Show them where you were.\nRepeat your information as often as requested. They will often ask you the\nsame questions over and over to verify facts, and ,unfortunately, to see\nif your lying. Fill out all statements and show all required identification\nand weapon permits (BOOO! Down with registered citizens!Register your\n politicians as deadly tax weapons needing to be confiscated!) If they are\nrequired in your state. Contact a lawyer immediately if they decide to\nhold you or that further questioning is needed. If you cannot afford one,\ncontact the NRA.

From article <C5sEGz.Mwr@dscomsa.desy.de>, by hallam@dscomsa.desy.de (Phill Hallam-Baker):\n[stuff about British cult members deleted]\n\nThey were using 50 caliber ammunition not 50mm ammo.  50mm would be 5cm; a\nshell of this size would be larger than a lot of cannon shells.\n\nSnipers could have screened the people trying to put out the fire.  Besides,\nthe ranch house (not "fort apocalypse"; it was just a house despite what\nthe FBI and ATF says) was on *fire*.  The "Gun loonies" couldn't hardly\nhave been shooting at fire men while there house was engulfed in flames.\nThe FBI and ATF don't have any excuse for not having fire engines there\nto put out the blaze.  The bastards waited until the fire was *well*\nunder way before they called the fire department in Waco.  They didn't\neven tell the fire department to be on standby.  I sincerely hope that\nthe FBI, ATF, Attorney General Janet Reno, and all others involved in\nthis fiasco get the just punishment that they so richly deserve.\nSomeone should pay for this needless, tragic waste of human life.\n\nSadly, these evil SOBs will probably never face justice.  The media\nand the government will just whitewash this incident and chalk it\nup as being solely David Koresh's fault.  Sadder still, the American\npeople will probably believe them.\n\n\nThis is not the problem...the problem is that we have a government that\nis becoming more tyrannical every day.  If people decide to own guns\n*and* live in one place together then that is their prerogative.  On\nthe other hand, if the BDs were in posession of explosives and illegal\nguns then the government did have the right to search their compound.\nBut, the allegations that the BDs were in posession of illegal weapons\nhasn't been proven yet, so I'm not going to conclude that the BDs broke\nany laws.  David Koresh was accused of abusing children, but if this\nis his *only* crime then the presence of the ATF can't be justified.\nThe ATF is only supposed to deal with firearms, tobacco, and alcohol\nviolations.  ATF agents are basically cigarette cops...they should\nstay out of other kinds of law-enforcement actions that are out of\ntheir jurisdiction.  Better yet, they should be s**tcanned IMO.\n\n\nSounds like something the SS would do.  Human life---children and adults\nalike---should be treated with respect---even if they are "heavily-armed\nreligious wackos".\n\nDavid Koresh's lawyer seemed to think that everyone *would* come out\npeacefully sooner or later.  The FBI and ATF had NOTHING BUT TIME ON\nTHEIR HANDS!  Why did they have to escalate the situation and cause\nthis senseless tragedy?  Their job is to protect the public and SAVE\nLIVES NOT KILL PEOPLE for crying out loud.\n\n \nDon't be so sure about that.  I read in a newspaper today that one of the\ncult members said that when one of the tanks went through the wall that\nit knocked over a lantern which caused the ranch house to be caught on\nfire.  This cult member also said that David Koresh had *no* intentions\nof committing mass suicide.  David Koresh's lawyer also confirms this.\nTherefore, if this is true then this means that the FBI AND ATF MURDERED\nEVERYONE IN THAT HOUSE!  Even if this is not true, the FBI and ATF still\ndon't get off the hook because they waited a damn long time to call the\nWaco fire department.  Perhaps they wanted all these people to die.\n\n \nYou're wrong on several accounts.  ATF agents were adequately armed.  They\nhad MP5s, AR-15s, and shotguns.  Some agents were armed with automatic\npistols but not all were.  The ATF's initial claim---which they later\nretracted---that agents were underarmed is simply ludicrous.\n\n\nGun control isn't the only issue here.  If the sick little monkeys in\nWashington try to use the Waco incident as a reason to ban guns then\nthey will have demonstrated just how f***ed up they are.  What concerns\nme much more than new gun control legislation is that the government\nseems to be able to get away with s**t like they did in Waco...they are\nbecoming more and more callous about people's rights and the law.  This\ngreatly disturbs me and it should disturb you as well.\n\n\n\nScott Kennedy,  Brewer and Patriot

Post all you want, foreigner.  We'd rather hear from you\nthan those "I'll support the fascist who writes the\nhecks for my salary" .edu site types!\n\nShould you expect the Police to come in and\nassault you, lay siege and refuse to help when they\n(yes, let's give them the benefit of the doubt)\naccidently burn down your ranch home?  Even though\ney have emergency vehicles nearby?\n\nIs this a proper response when you just keep to yourself?\nEven if you DON'T hurt anyone?  And you\n're cooperative with cops when you occasionally come out?
CNN reported tonight that some bodies were found with bullet holes in their\nheads.  However, I have no information on the possible causes.\n\nThis is not to say that Government stories are to be taken at the face value in\nthis case, but to jump to conclusion at this stage may be the source of\nembarrassment in the future.  Let's be paranoic, this may be a ploy to smoke\nout the opposition and decredit them.  :-)\n\nComparison of this incidence to Tienanmen Square is made in soc.culture.china. \nJust in case you need more ammunition to shoot at each other.  :-)\n\nNo matter which side you are on this Waco issue, are you ready to die defending\nyour cause?\n\nPeace be with you.
..\n\nfunny, if Koresh did say that, he was quoting St. Paul. of course, \nthe early Christians were persecuted too. if Koresh is a loony \nbecause he quotes the Bible, how long is it before mainstream \nChristians become the target of the FBI's loving care and attention?\n\njason
If you won't believe anything the government says, and the press\nis not reliable according to the same logic, then what do you base\nyour statements on?  Wild speculation laced with a healthy dose\nof paranoia?
I keep hearing this, but every assertion of this form has come from\ngovernment sources except two.  As far as I am concerned, I am not\nready to stipulate that Koresh EVER promised to come out except for\nhis first promise and his last promise.\n\nThe first promise was conditional on his audio tape being given \nNATIONAL exposure.  Well, it never was -- it was broadcast locally,\nin a chopped-up fashion, and that's all.  And even then, they cleverly \ncut it off when it got to the part where he demanded "national exposure,"\nbut not so cleverly that we didn't hear it.\n\nThe last promise was conditional on the finishing of his manuscript.\nWe'll never know if he would have kept that one.\n\n\nStrangely enough, the previous day they said they were prepared to\n"wait as long as it takes."\n\n\nQuite possible.  But arguments of intent do not mark the dividing \nline between guilt and innocence -- only the line between murder and \nnegligent manslaughter.\n\n\nThis would be an interesting development.\n\n\nIt's too tempting for one or more of the survivors to "go state's\nevidence," parrot the FBI story, hang the whole "suicide" on Koresh, \nclaim they only stayed at gunpoint, etc.  If any of them do this\nin the next few weeks, it doesn't prove much; but if none of them\ndo, it would be a strong indication to me that the FBI story is\ndead wrong.\n--
And just where is the evidence for this? FBI sayso. The Texas Medical\nExaminer refuted 2 of their lies today.\n\n\n\nLet me put you in a building, pump in CS, knock the walls down around\nyou and see how fast you find an exit.\n\nI don't know why either, you're willing to swallow everything fed you.\nGood boy.\n\n\nOh a Clinton apologist, why didn't you *say* so.\n\n\nThe kgBATF was expecting a quick victory while the cameras rolled,\nhowever, they were the only ones with a script.\n\n\nHey, you're the apologist, *you* tell us.
Calm down.  It is not as if I tweaked the fount of the flame wars\nor anything (guns, anything to do with them).

As a matter of fact, I know it.\n\n	There were several shootings recently in which the guns had\nbeen purchased at the Baltimore Gunsmith, on Broadway - a favorite\nplace to get cheap "popular" pieces. By "popular" I am referring to\nthe kinds of guns our local youth gangs like: pistol grip shotguns,\ncheap magnums, and Tec-9s.\n\n	I hate to poke a hole in your bubble, but I was referring\nto a specific gunstore, and specific incidents. Any other questions?
I would agree that a propane explosion is as likely as an\n	ammunition/explosives blast. My question was directed to the\n	person who claimed that the propane tank was likely ruptured\n	by the tank before, or just as, the fire started. If that were \n	true, shouldn't the explosion have happened very soon after \n	the fires started?	\n\n\n\n\n	The FBI has made such a fuss over the videotapes and other\n	evidence that they have to release something sooner or\n	later. It's going to happen, and we'll get to see for\n	ourselves.\n\n	Often law enforcement agencies will withold evidence from\n	public view until the investigation is over.  \n\n                  _____  _____\n                  \\\\\\/ ___/___________________\n  Mitchell S Todd  \\\\/ /                 _____/__________________________\n________________    \\/ / mst4298@zeus._____/.'.'.'.'.'.'.'.'.'.'.'.'_'_'_/\n\_____        \__    / / tamu.edu  _____/.'.'.'.'.'.'.'.'.'.'.'.'.'_'_/\n    \__________\__  / /        _____/_'_'_'_'_'_'_'_'_'_'_'_'_'_'_/\n                \_ / /__________/\n                 \/____/\\\\\\\n 			 \\\\\\
I'm putting together a list of the civil rights violations perpetrated against\nthe Davidians by the FBI/BATF. Here is what I've got so far. Care to add\nany or provide more backup info?\n\nFirst Amendment:\n1) FBI/BATF violated Davidians right to free exercise of religion from the \n	start. We now have a de facto precident against any minority religion.\n2) FBI/BATF violated BD right to free speach by:\n	a> preventing them to speak to media\n	b> preventing them from practicing their beliefs\n3) FBI/BATF violated the freedom of the press by:\n	a> keeping them 2 miles from the Davidians\n	b> preventing the media to cover the FBI/BATF actions close-up\n	c> censoring media reports\n4) FBI/BATF violated the BD's right to peaceable assemble\n	a> proven by initial baseless assault\n\nSecond Amendment:\n1) The BATF went after them because they had too many guns and guns that the\n	FBI/BATF didn't approve of. 'Nuff Said.\n\nFourth Amendment:\n1) The right of the BD's to be "secure in their persons, houses, papers, and\n   effects against unreasonable searches and seizures" was violated by:\n	a> Initial baseless assault\n\nFifth Amendment:\n1) The Davidians were "held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous\n   crime" without a "presentment or indictment by a Grand Jury."\n2) The Davidians were "deprived of life, liberty, and property without due \n   process of law.\n\nSixth Amendment:\n1) The accused were denied the right to "a speedy and public trial by an\n   impartial jury" when the FBI became judge, jury and executioner.\n2) The BD's were never informed of the specific "nature anad cause of the\n   accusation."\n\nEighth Amendment:\n1) The Davidians suffered cruel and unusual punishment when:\n	a> The FBI cut off the water to the ranch\n	b> The FBI used Psy-War (loudspeakers broacasting the screams of\n	   dying rabbits and Tibetian Chants)\n	c> The FBI prevented family members from contacting their family\n	   inside the ranch.\n	d> The FBI used tear-gas against them (especially the children)\n	e> The FBI burned the ranch down.\n	f> Thoes who escaped were imprisoned without bail without a hearing.\n\nAnything I miss?
Hey, joe -- assuming you're old enough to remember it -- how did you feel\nabout presidential responsibility every time Reagan said "I don't recall" \nabout his arms-for-hostages meetings with the Ollie North gang?\n\nHow did you feel about it when Bush said he "was out of the loop on that\ndecision" when he was right there in the thick of it?\n\nOh, right.  "He was responsible in the sense that he was briefed, but so\nwhat -- shit happens!"  Is that what you said?\n\n--
: Oh? Then why did the smoke and flames start from three different places?\n: In particular, three different places where there were no APV's?\n\nThe crushed remains of a PRESSURIZED propane tank were found in the ruins\nof the BD compound.  The key word is PRESSURIZED.  When that baby was \ncrushed, the gas would have gone all over the place.  And when ignited, \nwould look just like the pictures of the explosion we saw on the TV \nnews.  Ammo doesn't go up all at once - kind of like fireworks going off.\nPropane gas goes off in a big fireball.  Gee, that's kind of consistent \nwith what the pictorial history shows.  Hmmmmm...\n\n: And if the government did start the fire, then why weren't people trying\n: to get out of the compound?\n\nRemember, PRESSURIZED gas.  People all over the building.\nConflagration in less than a minute.  Huge explosion.  Gas masks being\nworn by the inhabitants.  Makes a lot of sense that very few of those\non the inside would even know that the tank was damaged.  If they\nthought it was just a normal fire, they would probably be trying to\nput it out.  Then - BOOM - the fireball.  After that explosion and \nconcussion, I doubt anybody on the inside of the building was capable\nof moving.\n\n: And besides... oh, I don't know why I'm even bothering.\n\nGood question.  Take an objective look at what happened, listen to the \nthings that the FBI said ("The BD's started the fire."  "The BD's bodies\nwere found with gunshot wounds.") that are now being refuted by the \nevidence being recovered.  Seems that the FBI is deliberately making\nstatements that have no rational basis in fact, and trying to make\nthem sound like fact.  \n\n: I find it tremendously chilling that so many people seem eager to believe\n: a murderous, heavily-armed religious cult, despite much evidence to the\n: contrary. Thought Experiment: Suppose this exact same thing happened under\n: the Bush administration. What would your answer be then? Would you still\n: prefer to believe the cultists?\n\nYes, I would still believe that the FBI and the BATF were on a non-stop\nstring of lies and half-truths.  This is consistent with their operations\non numerous occasions.\n\nAnd as for the BD's being murderous, they did not cause any problems until\nthey were assaulted by the BATF.  So now a thought experiment for you:  If\nthe BATF had never stormed that farm, would four agents and 90 BD's be\ndead today?  \n\n: (No, I don't really expect a response to that challenge.)\n\n: >But then\n: >again, that is how Mr. Clinton was elected, by people who believe that\n: >his campaign promisses would be respected by him once he got into office.\n\n: Um, isn't that how all politicians are elected?\n\nYes.  That is how politicians are elected.  Kind of scary, isn't it.  Now\nif we as a people actually held Mr. Clinton to his promises instead of\napologizing and denying that he ever made them, and actually expected\naccountability by our government, I doubt that debacles like Waco would\nhappen as often as they do.\n\n: So is there any particular reason the gummint decided to slaughter eighty\n: people? Are they, like, just plain evil, or what? Did they just wake up\n: one day, stretch and yawn, and throw a dart at a map of the United States\n: to figure out who to oppress that day? I'm eager to know.\n\nAcutally, no.  THe BATF has a rather checkered history of staging raids of\nthis sort just prior to the time when their budget comes up for review.  \nOddly enough, their budget was about to be reviewed just two weeks after\nthe initial raid on the BD's.  "Coincidence?  I think not!"\n\nAnd as for the fire, what happened was caused by the act of knocking over\nwalls with an armored vehicle of destruction.  The FBI tried to convince\nthe world it was suicide, but all of the facts that are coming out by\nthe investigation of the Texas rangers and medical examiners point to \na gas explosion and quick fire that decimated all of the occupants of the\nbuilding.  Sounds to me like a law enforcement agency that is trying to \ncover its ass.  \n\n: And does Bill Clinton have cooler theme music than Darth Vader? How is he\n: on diabolical laughter? Does he look good in a cape? These things MUST be\n: investigated. You first.\n\nOh, please.  If you want to argue, argue.  If  you merely want to demean those\nwho see this differently than you, then please go somewhere else.  \n\n: Mark Sachs IS: mbs110@psuvm.psu.edu
Let's discuss Reno's taking full responciblity. Is everyone happy with the \noutcome? Did the FBI pursue the correct course of action? was justice done?\nIf Reno really meant what she said she would resign! She is just grand\nstanding, period. What did those people do wrong in the first place? that is\nwhat i can't figure out. sure they were crazy, no dought about it, but what did \nthey do wrong? someone please help me out on this.
And done in SECRET ... :-)\n\nDid anybody notice it is the TREASURY DEPT (The FBI and BATF, in other words)\nthat Clinton wants to do the investigation?  In other words, investigating\nthemselves?\n\nHe sure didn't seem very enthusiastic about Congress doing the investigation,\nI notice:  "... well, they can do what they want..."  (Probably insert\na pout here...)\n\nDoes anybody smell the attempt for a WHITEWASH?  Betcha the Justice\nDept investigation will, AT MOST say "Possible Poor Judjement.  Too bad..."\n\nGrrr.
In Massachusetts, you will likely be arrested for murder, but\nif you convince the cops/DA that you used lethal force because\nof threat of death or serious bodily harm, then the charges\nwould probably be dropped.  If you run away and are later caught,\nthen you will have a much harder time convincing cops/judge/jury\nof your innocence.  Going "on the lam" is seen as an indication\nof guilt by a lot of people.
Not anymore!  Recent archaeological inspection of the site presents pretty\ncompelling evidence that the "mass suicide" at Masada never occured.  This\nevidence was so compelling tha the Tzahal no long hold their secret ceremony\nat the fortress.
On TV news this morning it was reported that the local Texas authorities\nwho have reviewed the cases of the 21 children who were released\nearlier in the siege have found no evidence of physical or sexual\nabuse of any of the children.  I don't recall if this was on Good\nMorning America or our local Texas TV station.
Apparently needing to clarify his comments from Thursday, Dr. Nizam\nPlawaby (spelling?), the Medical Examiner for Tarrant County, Texas,\nwho has authority in the Waco deaths, stated that since no autopsies\nhad been performed, there is no evidence for bullet wounds, or \nevidence against bullet wounds.\n\nJanet Reno also stated that she had never been told of bullet wounds\nby anyone in the Justice Department.
And you're the guy that doesn't know that illiterate people can't write \ncoherent sentences. Does that make you superior somehow?\n\n                                        Steve\n[]

I'm getting tired of these wimpy Liberals whining about gun control,\ntoo!  Ya know, the Second Amendment says\n\n	A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a\n	free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms,\n	shall not be infringed.\n\nNow, notice, it says *arms*.  Not guns.  Arms.\n\nThe Comsymp ZOG wants you to think that it is the only legitimate\npossessor of nuclear weapons.  Unconstitutional!  You and I have just\nas much right to a kilogram or two of nice weapons grade plutonium as\nany cruddy little pointy headed liberal Los Alamos pinkos.\n\nSupport your right to keep and bear short range nuclear weapons.  It's\na legitimate and challenging sport.\n\nAnd screw the limit.\n\n							spl
Okay, here is the result of my efforts.  I'm just getting started with this\ntype of activity, so please set your flame-thowers on low.\n\nComments, corrections, suggestions, welcomed.\n\n****************************************************************************\n\nEditor, \n\nI would like to ask you and your readers a few questions that are related to\nthe "right to keep and bear arms", and to a greater degree, the many other\n"rights" that we take for granted on a daily basis. \n\n1.	You're sleeping at night, when you hear someone in your house.  You\ncall the police.  How will you defend yourself, should the need arise, while\nyou are waiting for the police to arive? \n\n2.	You are driving your family home when your car breaks down.  A "good\nsamaritan" stops to "help", when you find you and your family at gun-point or\nknife-point.  How will you defend yourself?  And your Family? \n\n3.	You are a woman walking alone to your car or home.  A man appears\nsuddenly with the intent to rape you.  How will you defend yourself?  Are you\nstrong enough to fight off your attacker?  Are you willing to let this man rape\nyou in order to survive the attack? \n\nIf the House and Senate have their way, we will soon not have the right to keep\nand bear arms, as provided by the Second Amendment to the Constitution. A gun\nmay not be the answer to each and every dangerous situation, but are you going\nto let the politicians decide what sort of force or weapon you may use to\ndefend yourself and your family? \n\nMany times a situation may be diffused by just brandishing your handgun.  If\ncertain members of the House and Senate have their way, .25, .32, and 9mm\nammunition will be banned for sale to anyone other than the military and law\nenforcement departments.  Very soon, you may not be able to purchase ammunition\nfor use in your handgun. \n\nThere is already a 15 day waiting period in California.  Do you really feel\nthat any law abiding citizen should be required to wait this amount of time for\nthe purchase of a handgun when his life or family members have been threatened?\n\nOur local police do an excellent job, but they can not be there all the time,\nor in a moments notice.  You should have the right to protect yourself   while\nwaiting for help to arrive. \n\nThere is currently legislation circulating in Washington that would prohibit\nthe sale of certain types of ammuntion, handguns, rifles, and shot-guns.  One\nelected official even wants to repeal the Second Amendment! \n\nI want to ask the readers of this paper what they would do if their elected\nofficials decided that they should only belong to a "certain church", or go to\nchurch on a "partiular day"?  What if you were told that you could only read\ncertain books?  Write about certain subjects?  What if you no longer had the\nright to a jury of your peers?  How about the right to assemble in a peaceful\nmanner?
Compared to the Second Amendment?  I think it's worse.\n\nThe problem is, the devil is in the details.  You know, the Brady Bill\nsounds like a "good idea" too, until you discover that there is NO check,\nand that the police DON'T have to allow your purchase even if you check\nout, and that you have NO recourse if they don't.\n\nAre there any loopholes here?  I'm no lawyer, I can't be sure.  I\nwould have never noticed the second one mentioned above in the Brady\nBill, for example.\n\nThe more words involved, the more details.  What was that saying about\nAbraham Lincoln requiring 200 words to free the slaves, and the modern\nCongress requiring 3,000,000 words to describe price controls on rice?\n\n\nThat only works with bad laws.  Good laws are like good computer programs.  \nQuality has to be written in from the start, not added on later.\n--
So far, there is NO credible evidence that the BD's set the fires\nthemselves. We only have the ATF/FBI's sayso. Law enforcements type\nwould *never* lie to cover their ass, right?\n\n\nNo, not love, just share a surprising similarity of beliefs and\nmethod.\n\n\nFunny, yeah, funny how you didn't wait for the FBI spokesdroid \nlatest reversal of "facts" before proclaiming the BD's burned\nthemselves to death.
Cute word angst.  Conveys volumes.\n \n       I'd be interested in this particular definition of "we."  It's\nsuch a fluid pronoun.\n \n \n       The BD were a paranoid little cult out in the middle of nowhere,\nwhich all of a sudden had their worst paranoid fears reinforced.\n \n       Joy.\n \n \n       Yes, they probably should have, although how many paranoid\nnuts can say they held off the feds for 51 days?\n \n \n        The voting booth is highly over-rated.  People need to get up\noff their lazy butts more than every year or every two years.  Hell,\nmost don't even do that.\n \n \n        No, because "we" have decided that it doesn't make enough\ndifference to "us" to get up and do something.  That's something,\nfor instance, a lot of people who go speak against gun control\nbills at their local government.  Dozens of "pro-gun" speakers\nshow up and few if any antis do, but  they often win anyway.\n \n        Why?  Because it doesn't matter who shows up, it matters\nwho's willing to scream afterwards.  And it isn't that most people\ngive a damn one way of the other, but that they don't.  Nobody\ngives a damn about anybody beyond their own little worlds.\n \n \n       The general public's usually not even read the constitution.\nAnd what they have learned is a distorted picture of the whole thing.
Let's go to the videotape.  Here's exactly what you posted:\n\n\n\nSo if you weren't saying that the deaths of "bastard children of a sacreligious\nzealot" was no big thing (and I know I am not the only one who read it that\nway), just what the hell WERE you saying?\n\n\nSo who brainwashed YOU into believing that whatever the government says it\nthe truth?  Or that Koresh was any actual threat to you and the rest of the \nUS?  Haven't you ever stopped to wonder WHY the government raided this farm?\nThis raid was NOT ABOUT RELIGION, SEX, OR CHILD ABUSE.  To the best available\nevidence at the moment, this raid, psychological torture, and group death was \nabout Koresh's failure to PAY A $200 TAX on ONE grenade launcher that he may \nor may not even have had!  That's why it was the BATF doing the raiding in the\nfirst place.\n\nDo you think a $200 tax evasion justifies an armed assault by the government\nwith 100 armed men in trailers, orchestrated character assassination, noise\ntorture, and a holocaust?\n\n\nThen think before you post.\n--
This is where Freeman's love of accuracy becomes really ridiculous.\n\n[his point was that it is possible under certain circumstances for many people\nto carry concealed in Illinois]\nI did read the law before I commented on it.  Judging from replies I received\nabout my "Semantics on t.p.g" post many (if not most) people here on t.p.g\nassume that when CCW laws are asked about the person is asking about the\npossibility of an ordinary citizen getting one.  It would also follow that said\nperson would get the CCW to carry on his/her person away from their home and/or\nbusiness.\n\n\n\n\nMaybe Freeman did prove his point but his point is not relevant.  The thing\nthat most people seem to care about when they ask questions about carrying\na concealed weapon is whether or not they can carry it concealed on their\nperson when they are out on the street somewhere.  I'm sure that not many\npeople are concerned with whether or not they can carry concealed at home.\nSpeaking as someone who lives in Illinois (the only place where the above\nquoted law is relevant :-)) I know that it is legal to own a handgun here (I\nam not taking into account city ordinances).  I could care less about whether\nor not I can carry concealed at home.         I only care about the fact that\nI can't carry concealed in the place where it really counts- out on the street.\nFreeman loves to be accurate and I can understand that (especially not) but he\nseems to be forgetting that accurate facts don't always replace common sense.\nI am not going to followup to this thread anymore because I believe that it is\nuseless to argue these points anymore.  The only thing that is happening now\nis that Freeman and I are "running around in circles" trying to prove each\nother wrong and I do not have the time to be playing games anymore.  Of course\nnow Freeman will attack me about my use of common sense in some of my earlier\nposts but what can I do.  My only advice for Freeman - quit being so picky\nabout accuracy sometimes and use your common sense; it really does work some-\ntimes.
No.  I see many of the same groups protesting both.  I also know people\nwho feel exactly the opposite (i.e., treat citizens better than Saddam).\n\n\nHey!  Sect changes are still illegal in Texas!\n--
According to an AP report (from Texas, written by Jaime Aron) this morning,\nin addtion to the gas pumped in by hoses from CS generators, canisters of\ntear gas were thrown into the building from armored vehicles, one of the\ncanisters hitting a man inside in the face.\n\nThis was in the part of the article *before* going into differences in\nthe stories told by BD survivors and the gov't.\n\nTear gas canisters *used* to be able to start fires...\n\n\n\n\n\n--
Some of the survivors have been "interviewed" on TV as they were going\nto or returning from court. They basically said, no way was there any\nkind of suicide pact or attempt.
Of course there is.\n\nPerhaps the Vogons will put in a hyperspace bypass so that he can get there.
Lucky they brought the situation to a prompt resolution before they had to \nturn things over to the amateurs.\n\n\nGod help us all.\n--
Though David Sternlight pushes the envelope of credibility by claiming that\ntalk.politics.guns is not the place to discuss guns, or the meaning of the\nSecond Amendment, it seems he would rather post to millions of people out \nof relative ignorance of the subject than to follow the currently active \nthreads discussing EXACTLY this topic which at least explore the fallacies \nof his erroneous claim, and at most explode them.\n\nBasic fact #1, Mr. Sternlight:  The RIGHT described is a "right of the people\nto keep and bear arms;" not a "right of the people to form a militia," a\n"right of a militia to keep and bear arms," or a "right of well-regulated\npeople to keep and bear arms."  This should be apparent from a simple\nreading of the sentence.\n\nFor the other arguments, I suggest you check out the thread, "Some more\nabout gun control," playing now in an alt.politics.usa.constitution\nnear you.\n--
James, it could be that they were determined to stay together in the compound\nno matter what happened. Perhaps the fire was accidental, and the DB simply\nrefused to leave the compod. Perhap they died fighting the fire? who knows.\nwe will have to wait and see. i persaonlly find it hard to believe that they \nwould all agree to burn themselves up! what a horrible way to go.
Whoa.  Think twice, now, unless you want the same standards applied to\nhollowpoints...\n--
I saw this nifty drawn out posting and I thought I might give the two of you\n   a little help with your problem. As you both know what you posted,(and this \n   foolish thing gave me so much shit last time I tried to post) I took the \n   liberty of deleting all but the header and a single quote.

For those of you still unsure whether this is satire, the jury is still out:\n\n    "Also yesterday, even though the compound no longer exists, the\n     US attorney's office here released formerly sealed documents,\n     including a search warrant and related affidavits, that authorities\n     planned to use when the siege was over.\n\n    "These documents did not include the original warrants the Bureau of\n     Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms had in late February, which to this\n     day have never been released.\n\n    "...one of the documents indicated the agency planned to seek\n     samples of Koresh's handwriting not only to verify that he had\n     signed for some gun purchases, but also that he espoused\n     'certain doctrines hostile to law enforcement and particularly\n     the ATF.'"\n\nSo, one of the charges against Koresh seems to be Contempt of Cop -- he\nexpressed hostility to the BATF.

Since it has been shown in other countries that\nsuicide rates are pretty much independent of the means available for\ndoing oneself in (studies include some done/published in Japan, Canada,\nAustria, Norway), suicides ought not be included in the count.\n\nIf this is done, the number of vehicle-related deaths greatly exceeds that\nof firearms-related deaths in Texas.\n\n\nCertainly not.\n\n\nWhy?

This is the AP story from Fri morning.\n\nAs the walls came tumbling down and tear gas filled the air, cult leader\nDavid Koresh sprang into action. He left his third-floor bedroom and began\nlooking around the house, making sure women and children were secure and \nchecking that everyone had their gas masks on properly. Within hours, the    \ncompound became an inferno. Nine Branch Davidians excaped.\n   This is their story, gleaned from lawyers who spoke with six of them\nwho are jailed on charges that include conspiracy and murder. That day the \nsix said a portable radio offered the only contact with the outside world    \nsince Koresh's right-hand man, Steve Schneider, ripped out the compounds's \nphone line after FBI agents called before dawn Monday saying this was the\ncults last chance: Come out or prepare to get forced out.\n    They kept their word. By dawn, tanks were battering the Mount Carmel\ncompound, punching for hours to creat holes for tear gas to enter. The BD\nmeanwhile proceeded with their daily routines. Strapped into gas masks, the\nwomen did laundry. Others read Bibles in their rooms. The 17 children, all\nunder 10, remained by their mothers' sides. Still, it was hard to ignore what    \nwas happening around them. Each time a tank rammed the poorly-constructed building\nit shook violently. Cult members dodges falling gypsum wallboard and doors.\nHundreds of gas canisters hurled in from the armored vehicles were filling\nthe air with noxious fumes. The flying canisters were more frightening than\nthe tanks. At least one man was hit in the face. The gas began filling the air,\ndriven by heavy gusts of wind coming through windows and the holes the tanks\nmade. Scattered throughout the house, the cult members made no efforts to\ngather. Then the FBI sent in its biggest weapon -- a massive armored vehicle\nheaded for a chamber, lined with cinder blocks, where authorities hoped to \nfind Koresh and Schneider and fire tear gas directly at them.\n  Here the cult members' story diverges from the government's version. The\nFBI says cult members set fires in three places. But each of the six cult\nmembers, in separate discussions with lawyers, consistently gave versions\nat odds with the FBI's account. They say the tank flattened a barrel of \npropane, spilling its contents. And as the tank thundered through the house,\nit tipped over lit lanterns, spitting flames that ignited the propane and\nother flammables. The home of used lumber, plywood, and wallboard tacked \ntogether with tar paper was vulnerable. The building erupted. Nine BD's\nescaped jumping through windows and dashing through other openings. Others\ndied groping in the blackness.
Then by your logic, the Jews in Europe in the 1930's were the cause for\nthe Holocaust.  Hitler told them to leave and because they didn't they\nbrought the whole thing on themselves.  Because as you say, they could\nhave COME OUT of Germany.\n\n\n\n\nSame for the Jews in Europe 1930's.\n\n\nYou don't see any evidence of the abuse -- therefore it must be taking place?\nAs you point out everwhere but here, it is irrelevant to this case.  The\nATF is not in charge of investigating child abuse.\n\n\n\nIn obvious contradiction to the statements made by the F. B. I.\n\n\nAnd just what are those actions that you are judging them by?\nTheir refusal to let the government control their lives? Their refusal\nto submit to unconstitutional laws?  Their refusal to behave like\ncowards?  Some of Texas' heros could have taken the cowardly way\nout too and surrendered the Alamo.  After all, all they had to do was\nCOME OUT.  They stayed as you say by their "OWN CHOICE".  Problem\nis not everyone chooses to act like a groveling dog in the face of\ninsurmountable odds.  But as you point out, they certainly do have\nthat right.  \n\n\nBull.  They did, in fact, live a quiet, religious life -- as they claimed.\nThe warrant was not issued because they "stockpiled weapons".  It is\nnot against the law to own as many guns as you want -- yet (Except in \nVirginia).The warrant was issued for some "gun parts" that are about the size \nof a half-dollar.  Certainly worth the lives of so many people, don't you \nthink?\n\n\nYou can forget that WE business.  I certainly do blame them.

I guess you need to be reminded of some things!  Have you ever heard of the\nFirst Amendment?  I guess not.

I don't know about the paranoia and irrationality, but the rest is\npretty close, all though you left out the inability to breath.  Of\ncourse you can make a claim that people will do some fairly deranged\nthings to get away from it.  I've seen teenagers flatten 200lb. drill\nsergeants to get out of tents full of it.  Which raises another\nissue....\n\n\nWhat they didn't mention is that IN THE OPEN, it probably wouldn't do\nTOO MUCH harm to children, although I wouldn't use it in close proximity\nto infants.  On the other hand, IN CONFINED spaces, the effects are\nGREATLY intensified, to the point of LETHALITY, since a sufficient\nquantity of CS will displace OXYGEN.  When running a CS chamber CAREFUL\nattention is paid to ventilation.  I wonder if they checked to see if\nany of the BDs were asthmatics or suffered from other respiratory\ndiseases.  I doubt it.
I have NEVER spoken for a ban against guns in America !\nWhat I've said is that there seems to be to MANY of them, and especially\nto many in wrong hands....\n\nNow IF you would like to reduce the number, how would you do it without affecting\ngood/responcible gun owners ??\n\n\nI DO believe in a persons freedom.\nWhat I don't believe is that you can have it all and don't pay for it.\n\nMOST europeans believe in a society of individuals, and that you HAVE\nto give 'a little' to make that society work.\n\nCars and guns should really not be mixed, I just tried to make a point.\nLike America, Norway has some spaces you have to cross to get from a to b,\nso a car is essential in most parts....\n\nGuns on the other hand are not essential in Norway, so we don't \nargue that IF we 'banned' guns we HAVE to ban cars.....\n\n\nEVERYONE who believe that Hitler and WW2 could be avoided if there were\nmore guns in Germany in the 30's: PLEASE read some HISTORY!\n\n\nIs this discussion about\n\n1.

Making it harder for criminals to get one ??\n\n\n\nChange of name.......\nWrote that one after reading the first postings about the Waco 'incident'.\nI still think there are 'some' posters should move their post to alt.conspiracy\nor make a new newsgroup.\n(If you read the first postings after the Waco fire you should see who I mean......)\n\nDid the BATF get the warrant for a gun search only or was there other reasons.\n(Child abuse for instance)\n\nDoesn't the people reading this newsgroup have access to the clari.news.* hierarcy ??\n(Some seems rather mis/unInformed)\n\n(Or is the clari.news.* hierarcy ruled and censored by the corrupt facist goverment??)
Relay of coverage seen:\n----------------------\nThere was a press conference by authorities at the compound on CNN earlier \ntoday (Wednesday).  It was explained that two news photographers were found \non the compound earlier this morning without permission.  It was explained \nto the press corps. that this is dangerous and that an unknown photographer \nturning around with a long lens camera could be mistaken for someone dangerous \nby a Texas Ranger surveying the site. (!)  \n\nThe two photographers were said to be currently in jail and \nthe press were warned to follow the authorities' guidelines.  \nIt was also emphasized that the survey of the "crime" scene at this \npoint was crucial and that the press could not be allowed to interfere.\nThe press will not be allowed in until the bodies are removed and the \nsite has been completely surveyed for evidence for a court case.  \n\nThat is the gist of the beginning of the conference to the best of my \nmemory.  I bring this up because I haven't seen anyone else note it \nand I haven't seen the regular newscasts mention it.  It will \nprobably be mentioned in the papers tomorrow.\n\nMy opinions:\n-----------\nI find this disturbing.  While I believe that Koresh is largely \nresponsible for not ending this standoff in a peacable manner during the \nlast 51 days of patient opportunity, I find the secrecy surrounding the \naftermath more damaging to the authorities' position than they realize.\n\nSince the vast majority of potential defendents in a court case are \nalready dead, the emphasis on the importance of building the court \ncase seems overblown to me.\n\nIt will be interesting to see the hearings on this affair.  I have also \nheard congressional calls for a review and possible overhaul of government \nenforcement agencies which you will recall I have stated would be a good \nidea in previous months.\n\nPlease also note that I by no means endorse  or agree with the many \nconspiracy-type theories I have read here and in other groups.  As usual, \nI am basing my opinions on info gathered from various media and filtered \nby my own common sense and consideration of plausibility, IMHO.  As such, \nmy opinion is subject to change as more information is made available.\n\n\nScott Roby                                                Standard Disclaimer

A really sad op-ed appeared in my school's newpaper today.  It\nclaimed that full-auto weapons are illegal in the U.S.\nI understand that full-auto weapons made and registered before\nMay 19, 1986 are still legal in 40 of the 50 states.  Is\nTexas one of those states?\n\nCan anyone point me to a source for info on how many people have been \nkilled by legal full-auto weapons in the U.S.?\n\nAnd finally, I think it would be great if anyone was keeping a digest\nof facts on the Waco incident.  In particular, I would like a source\nfor the FBI/BATF mentioning the supposed methamphetamine lab, and\ninformation on the beginning of the raid, specifically BATF\nlies.\n\nI am also interested in past BATF no-knock warrents which have lead\nto personal and property damage against innocent citizens.\n\nI intend to put together a reply to this op-ed very soon.  The author\nof the piece states he wants to work for the BATF.  gack!
What if.......\n\nWhat if the FBI thought that tear gas would force the Davidians out;\nat least the mothers and the children, so they (the FBI) did not\nbother to think about the effect of tear gas on young children......\n\nWhat if the FBI knew they killed several of the children by using\ntear gas......(let`s assume the FBI knew via their listening devices)\n\nWhat if the FBI saw fire accidently break out at one end of the\nbuilding, e.g. by an upset oil lamp.......\n\nWhat if the FBI thought they could finally force the rest of the\nDavidians out AND also destroy the evidence that they (the FBI) had\nkilled the children by starting a fire at the other end......\n\nWhat if the FBI miscalculated and not many of the rest of the Davidians\nmade it out.......?????

Attention please!\n\nAccording to the rules of usenet flame wars, once a discussion degenerates\nto the point where Hitler is mentioned, that flame war may be declared\nended.  I would like to take this opportunity to do that now.  Clearly\nfurther discussion is not useful with the current set of facts, and the\ncurrent name calling and invocation of Hitler's name is not productive even\nby the standards of usenet talk groups.\n\nIf you must continue, please don't discuss this in misc.legal.  It's not\nabout the law.  If you would like to discuss the law as it applies to the\nWaco incident, please ask questions of the form: "if the FBI started the\nfire accidentally, who would be legally responsible for the deaths".\n\nNote that followups are set not to include misc.legal.
Not when the power has been cut off for weeks on end.  Any generators are\nno doubt out of fuel, too.  So all they would have is wood stoves and\nkerosene lanters (maybe).  It is alleged that the tanks pushing in the\nwalls knocked over the lanters, starting the fire.  Remember, the FBI\nhad bugs which they even used (illegally) to eavesdrop on private\nconversations with the lawyers.  If a suicide order were given they\nWOULD HAVE KNOWN IT IN TIME.  If the Feds had been concerned they would\nhave had emergency equipment ready.  Not an hour or so later, not\nleaving the water THEY TURNED OFF, off.  They could have turned it back\non.

Perhaps you've been under a rock since, say, the turn of the century. How\nin the #$^& is one man supposed to review every single freaking\ngovernmental action, every day? That's why we have an executive branch. HE\nreviewed the plan and said "go," but he wasn't the architect and he wasn't\nthere, bullhorn in hand, implementing it. Yes, he was responsible in the\nsense that he was briefed. So what! Shit happens. That sounds like a\ncallous way to dismiss the deaths of 90+ people, but I can't understand why\npeople get so bent about the accidental death/suicide (which is it? could\ntake months...) of some total fucking sociopath/child molester and his\ncrazed followers while opposing U.S. intervention in Bosnia.

<forgot to leave in his quote source>\n: >What happened in Waco is not the fault of the BATF. If they would of\n: >had the proper equipment and personal then they could of captured the\n: >compound on the initial assault and none of this would of happened.\nThe BATF is a part of the dept. of treasury, not justice.  If they needed\nto assault a place they could just do like the IRS does...call in the\nfederal marshalls service, their fugitive collection teams do similar type\nassaults all the time.  And they are very, very good about it, in both the\ntactical and legal parts of it.  But I suspect that the marshalls would\nnot have touched it, because the search warrant (which is still sealed I\nbelieve) was so bogus.  \n\nBesides the BATF also could have gotton SWAT teams from: federal marshalls\nservice; FBI; secret service; national park service; texas rangers; nearby\nlarge city police forces; the military.  But they had to use their own\nguys, nobody elses SWAT team was good enough for the holy cause of gun\ncontrol.   \n\n	I also find the timing of the raid to be extremely interesting. \nInitial raid: two days before the NJ senate was going to overturn their\n"assault weapon" confiscation law; a couple weeks before the BATF's budget\nwas going to come up in congress for review;  shortly after Reno got\nconfirmed as AG (I don't need to remind you about her anti-gun line);\nright around the presidents 100th day in office.

The best reason to abolishing the ATF is that they don't have enough\nto do.  If the organization were disbanded and its duties assigned to\nthe FBI (firearms) and IRS (tobacco and alcohol).  Both of these\norganizations have enough to do.  The FBI is probably not going to try\nto get a criminal charge of illegal machine gun for having a broken\ngun.\n \nThere have been postings stating that law enforcement should be\ndivided and and weak.  But there is nothing more dangerous to\nliberties than a law enforcement agency without enough criminals to\nchase.  The ATF is one and look at the trouble it started in\nWaco.

------------------------- Original Article -------------------------\n\nThe Colorado Daily recently reprinted the Wall Street Journal's article\non Paxton Quigley, including the nefarious little paragraph the Journal\ntacked onto the end.  After recieving much assistance from various T.P.G.\ntype folks, I wrote a letter to the editor criticizing this last paragraph,\nand surprise, surprise, surprise, they published it.  The text follows.\nThe Colorado Daily, btw, is the University of Colorado (Boulder) student\n(I think) newspaper... not exactly a big coup, but every little bit, i guess...\n\n(The title was the only thing they changed/added)\n\n"Gun Stats"\n\nThe Daily recently reprinted an article from the\nWall Street Journal, primarily concerned with Paxton\nQuigley, author of "Armed and Female."  The article,\nin turn, cites a misleading statistic that was originally\nreported in the New England Journal of Medicine.  The\narticle states, "A study... found that a gun in the home\nwas 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner,\nspouse, a friend, or child than to kill an intruder."  This\nis an often-quoted statistic, and it is misleading for sev-\neral reasons, outlined below:\n\nThe study gives the impression that, if you own a\ngun, the likelihood that you will successfully use it to\ndefend yourself is less than that of the gun being turned\nagainst you.  The study, however, fails to take into\naccount cases where a law-abiding citizen uses a gun\nto thwart a crime, without actually killing the perpe-\ntrator.\n\nThe study actually refers to 'acquaintances' rather\nthan 'friend'.  This would include the friendly neigh-\nborhood thug who shows up like clockwork, every\nmonth, the second your grandmother cashes her social\nsecurity check.  Possibly an acquaintance, but hardly a\nfriend.\n\nThe NEJM study is based on the immediate dis-\nposition of cases and fails to take into account cases\noriginally filed as homicides that were later ruled to be\nself-defense.  Especially considering the small sample\nsize (396), taking these events into account has a sub-\nstantial effect on the 43:1 ratio quoted.\n\nCriminologist Gary Kleck gives us a slightly dif-\nerent statistic: a gun is 33 times more likely to be\nused, successfully, by a private citizen against an\naggressor than it is to kill anyone at all.  Further, per-\nsons defending themselves from aggression by using a\ngun fare better than those who resist vicimization by\nsome other means, or who offer no resistance at all.\nStatistics available from the FBI and other agencies\nalso show that a gun is 245 times more likely to be\nused by a non-criminal to defend against criminal threat\nthan to be used to commit criminal homicide, 535 times\nmore likely to be used to defend against a criminal\nthreat than to accidentally kill anybody, and 50 times\nmore likely to defend against criminal threat than to be\nused to commit suicide.\n\nIt is well to keep in mind that nearly anything can\nbe proved by uncritical quotation of statistics.

Posted for L. Neil Smith by Cathy Smith\n\n\n                         THE LIES OF TEXAS\n\nOkay, what have we learned?\n\nFor reasons still being kept secret, a federal agency already known \n-- well enough to be examined and rebuked by several legislative \ncommittees over the years -- for a longstanding, violent disregard\nof the law, invades the home of a man whose religious beliefs and \npersonal habits they abominate, violating his rights under the \nFirst, Second, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to \nthe Constitution. \n\nThe man and his followers fight back, killing four of the outlaw \nagency's minions, wounding many more, and suffering their own \nlosses in the process. The agency responds by cutting off his \nelectricity, water, and especially his contact with the outside \nworld. They are then free to say anything at all about him -- in \npronouncements that contradict one another daily as the agency \nfinds itself locked in a bitter power struggle with another outfit \neager to gain credit for "straightening out the mess" -- and, more \nimportantly, to script his side of the subsequent "negotiations" \nany way they please. \n\nThe impasse lasts almost two months, ironically, at the same time \nfour L.A. cops are being given a second trial for brutalizing a \nsingle individual, sparking one of the ugliest riots in history. \nArmored vehicles surround the house, already ringed with snipers \nusing scoped, high-powered rifles. Loudspeakers playing obnoxious \nrecords at the highest possible volume, and searchlights, deprive \nthose in the house of sleep (in the aftermath, nobody in authority \nwill mention the effect this technique, originated by North Korean \nCommunists as a battle tactic, may have had on their judgment). \n\nFinally -- another irony -- on the 50th anniversary of the rising \nof the Warsaw Ghetto, some of the armor punches holes in the house \nand gas of some kind is injected. The house bursts into flame and \nis reduced to ashes in less than an hour. At least 80 lives, \nincluding those of more than a dozen children, are snuffed out. \n\nSpokesmen for the outlaw agencies, the Attorney General, and the \nPresident all hold press conferences to articulate a common theme: \nblame the victim. \n\nHe had illegal weapons -- as soon as they can be prepared in a \nsecret government workshop and planted among the cinders being \n"examined" by the agency that created them. He was abusing children \n-- the tapes will be stored with the data on the JFK assassination. \nHe set the fire -- our snipers saw him doing it. Film at 11 -- in \n3000 A.D. He shot his followers who tried to escape -- or was that \nJim Jones? Best of all, he's dead -- he can't say a damn thing to \nembarrass us, any more than when his contact with the world was \nsevered at the start of the whole travesty. \n\nA leading national paper claims 93% of the American people believe \nthat a man who resisted a savage attack on his home is somehow \nresponsible for everything that resulted. But when did you ever \nknow 93% of Americans to agree on anything -- doesn't this sound \nmore like the outcome of a Soviet election than an opinion poll? \n\nVery well, what can we infer from the above? For starters, never \nforget that, although Democratic careers are on the line (and \nrightfully so) over this fiasco, by the outlaw agency's admission, \nit was planned and rehearsed by a Republican administration. Which \nmay explain why Paul Harvey, who evidently used up all his courage \nand integrity changing his mind (at about the same time I did) \nabout the war in Viet Nam -- has been acting as little more than a \nmouthpiece for a state that has no regard for the Bill of Rights. \n\nMore importantly, when Rush Limbaugh, who's been a quivering tower \nof Jello during the whole thing, takes essentially the same stance \nas Bill Clinton, it's time for fundamental changes, if not in the \nsystem, then at least within yourself. \n\nOn March 5, back at the beginning, Mary Gingell, national chair of \nthe Libertarian Party, issued a press release condemning the outlaw \nagency and calling for its abolition. In fact, the LP has promised \nin its platform since 1977, for at least 16 years, to abolish both \nagencies involved in Waco. I'm proud to say I was there and helped \nto write that plank. \n\nTrue, the LP is tiny and insignificant (although less so than in \n1977 -- ask the Democrats in Georgia if you doubt it). But, alone \nin a howling wilderness of fascists scrambling now to cover their \nbehinds with phony polls and Big Lies, the LP is right about what \nhappened in Waco. And if their advice had been followed in 1977, \nWaco never would have happened. \n\nThink about it. And think about the fact that, if you've had enough \nof political parties more interested in collecting and holding \npower -- at whatever cost to the Bill of Rights, let alone human \nlife -- than in defending and expanding individual liberty, maybe \nthe change it's time for within yourself is to make the LP less \ntiny and insignificant by a single voice and a single vote.\n\nThink about it.\n\nL.

"Freed om of Religion" has absolutely nothing to do with building a small\narsenal and grooming 10-year old children to be your wife. "I'll come out\nas soon as I finish my manuscript on the Seven Seals." Oh, OK, David.\n\nI agree that Koresh was as much of a victim as a perpetrator; this because\nhe grew up inside the cult, and engaged in a power struggle where his\nsupporters helped inflate his ego.\n\nThat doesn't change the fact that he was a loose fucking cannon with a\nshitload of serious weapons. Or that he was banging thirteen year olds and\ntwisting their impressionable little minds.\n\nThis was no MOVE fuck-up. A helicoptor was thermal-imaging the compound\nthat afternoon and detected three fires erupting almost simultaneously.\nThere were no CS CANISTERS... a specially modified Abrams was pupming the\nstuff in. No chance of starting a fire there. Kerosene lamps? Maybe one,\nbut not three fires. No way. Koresh wasn't just talking out of his ass. I\nexpected this to happen.\n\nMaybe they WANTED it to look like murder. He had 50+ days. I think this was\ncoming the whole time. He didn't even put the children in the buried bus or\nthe underground bunker during the CS seige. He put them up into the tower\nto die. Fuck all of you "Big Brother" paranoid freaks. The only good thing\nto come of any of this is that there will be one less group of crazoids to\nattract some of the more rootless members of our society.
or so days.\nincident\nYou seem to make two points.  No one ultimately oversees the federal agencies  \nyou mention, and since Koresh "apparently" has a different view point from your  \nBaptist upbringing, then he is not worthy of protection from religious  \npersecution.  As to being the Messiah, is not Christ within us all?\n\nMust be comforting to belong to a government approved religion.\n\nBaptists are a cult, two, BTW, under most of the definitions in the dictionary  \nof "cult".\n\nJim\n--\njmd@handheld.com

[many lines deleted]\n\nAh, here Freeman is being prejudiced (look it up and see what I mean Freeman).\nHere Freeman is pre-judging someone before he knows all of the facts.  Guess\nit can happen to the best (and in his case the worst) of us.\n\nFreeman thinks I am behind when actually I am quite on top of things.  The\npoint he seems to be missing now is that after a certain point accuracy can be\nvery tedious and ridiculous.  See Freeman's next post for an explanation.
Very narrow.  Very, very narrow.  If you'll recall, I was the\nnut that advocated the possibility of tactical nukes being militia\nweapons in certain situations.  How can you possibly define what is a\nweapon and what isn't is only the start of this.\n\n\n\n	And you've just described any civilian reactor because your\ndefinition fails to note what energy is being considered.  Reactors\nblow with a steam explosion, but the majority of energy still comes\nfrom fission or fusion because that is what heated the coolant.  See\nwhat a can of worms this is?  Last I heard, Ft. Calhoun station just\nnorth of Omaha, Nebraska wasn't considered a weapon.  Given the\nsodium-cooled breeder designs on the blocks now, I can easily envision\nreactors being household appliances in under twenty years.  With the\nPRISM design, there is *no* operator input needed on the reactor\nitself, and it is not unreasonable to assume the secondary side can\nbe made equally as automatic in the future.  So your definition is\nflawed in a few respects already.\n\n\n	Typhoid Mary would likely fit this bill if she sneezed.  If\nyou don't mind extrapolation, any HIV-positive person also fits this\nbill if they interact with others in a way that stands any chance of\nspreading the virus.  Finally, that manure pile I mention below fits\nthis definition, as does, say, releasing a pet rattlesnake to the wild.\n\n\n	And I can show where any such gas has other uses.  For example,\nperhaps we would like to rid the hay field of gophers.  Calcium Carbide\nis a rock that dissolves in water to produce aceteylne gas.  It can\nbe used for welding, in miners lamps, for gassing gophers, or for\nmaking carbide bombs and doing some illicit fishing.  Toss some in a\ntoilet and leave a lighted cigarette on the seat and you'll see that\nit can also be a weapon, just like any other flammable substance.\nSo, now my miners lamps won't work, I can't do any welding, and I\nstill have those pesky gophers.\n\n\n	The basis for, but I'm sure you see that the problem is not\nin writing a law, it is in writing a law that cannot be abused and\nextended beyond the point where it does any good.\n\n\n\n	It is under your proposed law.  So is a silage pit if there\nis run-off.  So are underground fuel tanks.\n\n\n\n	It meets all the criterion of a weapon.  It is an instrument that\ncan be used for fighting, even though that is not its intended purpose,\nand despite there being better weapons around.  Given that the aquifers\nsupply a significant part of the country with drinking water, mass\ndestruction is rather a given.\n\n	It's not that certain weapons aren't something I'd rather not\nsee a lot of people having.  The problem is that it is nearly\nimpossible to write a law such that it cannot be abused upon some\npretext or another.  The looser your definition, the more ripe for\nabuse that law is.  Furthermore, if you get specific then the old\nstandby is to insert a clause allowing the list of banned things to\nbe added to, generally without going through the hassles of another\nvote and public reading of the law.  Again, ripe for abuse.
Well, I don't normally like to quote myself, but I just got some\nadditional information.  I called my state rep (to express my support),\nand the person there informed me that it's actually just a second\nreading of the bill (three are required) for further consideration.\nI'm not 100% sure what *that* means, and I'm also not sure why\nthere's a discrepancy between what the two offices are telling me.\n\nStill researching....\n\nDaryl
Interesting that Janet Reno has publically announced that\n        we need steal ourselves for more Wacos.  I wonder if I can\n        get the gasoline concession.\n\n\n\n\n     Yup.  Kill that bastard!\n\n\n\n\n     Ah, yes.  The ILLEGAL helicopter, searchign for the non-existent\n     PCP lab.  I remember it well, even if the media ( and y'all ) tell\n     me I don't.  Call me Winston.\n\n\n\n      Ahhh, yes.  The "non-existent" canisters.  Call me Winston again.\n\n\n\n     I did too, but for different reasons.  The FBI has a habit of burning\n     up people in fortified areas.\n\n\n\n\n      Yup.  Good.  Dead.  YEAH!   Maybe Janet will do some more, just\n      like she's promis, er, WARNED us about.\n\n      Like I told y'all before.  I would SERIOUSLY consider the following:
The Colorado Daily recently reprinted the Wall Street Journal's article\non Paxton Quigley, including the nefarious little paragraph the Journal\ntacked onto the end.  After recieving much assistance from various T.P.G.\ntype folks, I wrote a letter to the editor criticizing this last paragraph,\nand surprise, surprise, surprise, they published it.  The text follows.\nThe Colorado Daily, btw, is the University of Colorado (Boulder) student\n(I think) newspaper... not exactly a big coup, but every little bit, i guess...\n\n(The title was the only thing they changed/added)\n\n"Gun Stats"\n\nThe Daily recently reprinted an article from the\nWall Street Journal, primarily concerned with Paxton\nQuigley, author of "Armed and Female."  The article,\nin turn, cites a misleading statistic that was originally\nreported in the New England Journal of Medicine.  The\narticle states, "A study... found that a gun in the home\nwas 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner,\nspouse, a friend, or child than to kill an intruder."  This\nis an often-quoted statistic, and it is misleading for sev-\neral reasons, outlined below:\n\nThe study gives the impression that, if you own a \ngun, the likelihood that you will successfully use it to \ndefend yourself is less than that of the gun being turned\nagainst you.  The study, however, fails to take into\naccount cases where a law-abiding citizen uses a gun \nto thwart a crime, without actually killing the perpe-\ntrator.\n\nThe study actually refers to 'acquaintances' rather\nthan 'friend'.  This would include the friendly neigh-\nborhood thug who shows up like clockwork, every\nmonth, the second your grandmother cashes her social\nsecurity check.  Possibly an acquaintance, but hardly a\nfriend.\n\nThe NEJM study is based on the immediate dis-\nposition of cases and fails to take into account cases\noriginally filed as homicides that were later ruled to be\nself-defense.  Especially considering the small sample \nsize (396), taking these events into account has a sub-\nstantial effect on the 43:1 ratio quoted.\n\nCriminologist Gary Kleck gives us a slightly dif-\nerent statistic: a gun is 33 times more likely to be \nused, successfully, by a private citizen against an \naggressor than it is to kill anyone at all.  Further, per-\nsons defending themselves from aggression by using a \ngun fare better than those who resist vicimization by\nsome other means, or who offer no resistance at all.\nStatistics available from the FBI and other agencies \nalso show that a gun is 245 times more likely to be\nused by a non-criminal to defend against criminal threat\nthan to be used to commit criminal homicide, 535 times\nmore likely to be used to defend against a criminal\nthreat than to accidentally kill anybody, and 50 times\nmore likely to defend against criminal threat than to be\nused to commit suicide.\n\nIt is well to keep in mind that nearly anything can \nbe proved by uncritical quotation of statistics.  One has\nto consider carefully what questions were asked by\nthose gathering the data before one can draw an accu-\nrate conclusion from them.\n\nD.F.

[...]\n\nThe House Document Room can be reached at +1 202 225 3456.  You need to \nhave the number of the document you want (e.g. HR1036) and they'll be happy\nto send it to you.  Tell them if it's going to be a big stack, because the\nsurly sounding guy who answers is scrawling in a really awful hand on the\nback of the envelope that will come and will run out of room quickly if\nyou don't tell him.\n\nThe Senate document room is too important to deal with the likes of you\nand I, and will answer requests from off the hill only by mail.
A great deal of documentation exists on exactly that phenomenon. Especially\nregarding Vietnam and the Mai Lai (sp?) massacre\n\nNot that I'm suggesting that they started it on purpose but even if they\nnow know that they accidentally started (or contributed to it) you can\nbe sure the initial reaction is to lie. Remember the Iranian airliner\nwhich the US navy mistook for a fighter and shot down?
* The news statement was that there was $200,000 worth of "firearms\n	  and ammunition (no mention of "assault weapons")" on the premises,\n	  not that Koresh had purchased them (what would his crime be if he\n	  had?).  This averages to about $2000 per person, not an astronomical\n	  number.\n\n	* We don't know that there is a thigh-deep pile of a million rounds...\n	  we know that the FBI SAYS there is a pile of a million rounds.
started!".\nnot \n\nIt's also what you say when you're waiting for the end to come in a \n"fiery apocalypse"...just a thought.\n\nPersonally, if the fire was set (by either side), I wonder about the\ntiming.  If Koresh & Co. set the fires, why wait through six hours of\nwall-bashing and tear-gassing before starting; was there anything "new"\nthat happened just around that point?  Similarly, if the FBI were going\nto torch the place (and fake it, of course), why wait so long, wouldn't\nit be more "reasonable" to believe the BD's would set the fire early\nafter the assault began?  \n\nThe most plausible (to me) explaination is that of an accidental starting\nof the fire by the tanks.  Among other things, I say that because I\nwas listening to the radio when the fire started and the reporter\n(watching from a distance, of course) said that it looked like at least\none of the tanks had penetrated farther into the building than previously.\nSpecifically, he said that one tank apparently was halfway (half of\nthe tank's lenght) into the building where it previously had only been \npenetrating a few feet.
Murderous, huh?  Yeah, there was all sorts of carnage going on there in\nthe 60 YEARS they were there -- BEFORE the government assaulted them.\nOh, I forgot -- you probably consider self-defense as murder.\n\n\nDamn right.  This is not a partisan thing; it's about individual \nliberties -- the right of a citizen to be left the hell alone.\n\n\nThat's another indication that you don't understand the issue.\n\n\n\n"Our appropriations are coming up soon.  We need a good PR boost.  Let's\nfind a socially unpopular group who happen to have a lot of guns, go in\nlike gangbusters, be heros, and have the local media get it all on video \ntape.  Then we won't have to worry about our budget until next year."\n\n\nWhy don't you knit one to match his jogging outfit?\n--
hello,\n\nI just want to make 2 points:\n\n1) The FBI is not stupid. These people are chosen for their intelligence,\neducation, loyalty to the government, etc. They are given much intensive\ntraining. So, to all of you who refuse to believe there could be any\nconspiracy here, and say that the FBI was just stupid, I say I don't\nbelieve it.\n\n2) The FBI has acces to the latest in audio and video technology -- the\nlatest digital systems. The FBI can manufacture evidence. Need a tape of\nKoresh saying, "light the fire", and you can have one. Need a thermal\nimaging video of three people lighting fires, and through the magic of\ncomputer graphics, you can have one. The thing is, manufacturing these\npieces of evidence takes time. So it may be a few more days before we\nget to see them. Or maybe we just haven't heard any tapes or seen any\nFBI video is because it is:\n	1) classified\n	2) too gruesome for our eyes\n	3) lost/got coffee spilled on it\n\nDwayne Jacques Fontenot
My sig has generated more mail than any of my posts.\n\nRobin Hood is a school financing plan wherein property rich school districts\nwill have a portion of their tax revenue taken from them and given to property\npoor districts.  The laudable plan is to equalize the per student spending. \nIMHO, however, it is a disaster waiting to happen.  Taxes will go up in 50% of\nthe districts and we will lose control of how OUR tax money is spent.  It\npenalizes districts that have excelled.\n\nAnd the election is Saturday. Along with city council, school board and the\nunfinished Senate term.  And after I exercise one right, I'm going to exercise\nanother!
This claim hasn't been retracted or contradicted yet, as many earlier\ngovernment claims have?  At least one clip showed a fire erupting\nafter a tank busted in a wall.  We have unsubstantiated claims by\nthe government about the FLIRs spotting "simultaneous" fires.\n\n\nThat's easy.  Six hours of CS gas, heavy smoke from a rapidly spreading\nfire, confusion, panic.  Only 10% got out.  The building was collapsing\nall around them and finding the way out was a matter of luck.\n\n\nThe Davidians may have committed suicide, or some few zealots among\nthem might have started the fires -- that is possible.  But, given\nthe government's earlier inability to tell a straight story, I find\nmy above scenario equally possible.  I wait for some independent\ninvestigation to look into the whole thing.\n\nIt would be one thing if the government spokespeople had been\nconsistent and forthright throughout.  Keeping the press far away\nand ghettoized in "pools" was not conducive to building up trust.\nSealing the warrants was non-optimal, as well.  This operation\nwas out of control from the git-go.\n\n\n\nSpeaking only for myself, I think Bush and Reagan should have been\nimpeached over Iran-Contra.\n\nIn 1979, I would probably have given the benefit of the doubt to\nthe government.  No more.  Like I said, I'll wait to see the\nresults of an independent investigation -- if there is one --\nbefore I choose whom to believe.\n\n\nBut you got one, anyway.\n\n\n\nI generally vote for the lesser of two evils.  This last time, it\nwas the least of three evils.\n\n\n\nIt was a bureaucratic execution.  Out of control bureaucracies driven\nby percieved self-interest and gross stupidity.\n\n\nClinton is just another statist.  My only problem with Clinton on this\nis that he is apparently willing to blindly back the ATF and FBI.\n\n-- \npaul hager		hagerp@moose.cs.indiana.edu

CNN just reported the ATF and the FBI have begun killing everyone in the\nUnited States. A press release stated this action was required because\nbugs had revealed that many people were doing something illegal in their\nhomes, and statistical data indicated that those who weren't might someday\ndo something illegal. An ATF spokesperson, just before he shot himself, stated\nthat "this would clean up things once and for all".\n\nIf the citizens can be gathered into groups of more than 100, the FBI has\nindicated they will "burn them, just like we did those kooks in Waco". \nIt hasn't been decided how the new proposed "energy tax" will enter into\nthis, an IRS representative stated "We're looking at the tax code to determine\nif taxes really end at death. With this many dead Americans, we don't want\nto overlook anything". An ATF agent ran into the room, and shot her.
Ditto. Great post.
In the videos of the original BATF attack on the BD church, did anyone\nhappen to see BATF agents on the highest structure, where Koresh's\nroom was? I don't recall seeing BATF agents higher than the roof of the\nlowest structures, so I made an assumption that BATF helos did the\nfiring down into the tower. Any other info on how the rounds came\nthrough the roof?
Saying "hopefully the effect of policy X will be Y" is *much* different\nfrom saying "hopefully if there is any effect of policy X it will be Y."\nHere you've made both statements.\nIf the former describes a reasonably-likely outcome of policy X, then\nperhaps policy X is worthy of consideration - but the latter statement\nis not something to base policy decisions on!\n\n\nAccording to groups like the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence (formerly\nthe National Coalition to Ban Handguns - interesting name change, don't you\nthink?) who include murder and suicide by firearms in the "leading causes of\nunintentional death) figures but *don't* include murder and suicide by other\nmeans as causes of unintentional death.  Can't you see past the bullshit?\n\n\nCertainly accidental deaths by any cause are serious things - but the\nanti-gun groups insist over and over again that accidental death by\nfirearms is a *stastically serious problem*, and even if you don't use\nthese deaths as a justification for gun control, these groups do.  I'm\nsorry if I jumped to conclusions about your reason for mentioning\naccidental deaths due to firearms being something that warranted concern,\nbut in light of your statement that you are a staunch supporter of gun\ncontrol measures, I think the conclusion was a reasonable one.\nThe fact remains that tragic though individual accidental gun deaths may\nbe, they are *not* a serious problem statistically speaking.\n\n\nSorry if it wasn't clear to me.  I thought you were waffling on your view\nof buyback programs with the talk of symbolic offerings and hopefully\npreventing accidents and heat-of-passion shootings.  I have to disagree on\nall these counts; I can't understand how a buying guns from people who\naren't intending to misuse them (obviously those who want to use guns to\ncommit crimes aren't going to turn them in) could be construed as a\npositive way for police to respond to "interpersonal violence."\n\n\nWhat, the people who publish figures saying that as many children commit\nsuicide by HANDGUNS ALONE each year as the FBI says commit suicide by ALL\nMETHODS per year?  Who do you think I should believe?  The people who call\neveryone up to age 24 "children" when they're screaming about the "carnage\nof our nation's children" being caused by handguns?\n\n\nAh, yes, the agency that considers accidental shootings of children to be\nsuch a statistical problem that a stated objective in the Healthy People\n2000 document is to "enact laws in 50 states requiring manufacturers of\nhandguns to make the handguns more difficult to fire, minimizing the\nlikelihood of accidental or intentional dscharge by children?"  The\nagency that funded the "study" of DC which pronounced that the DC gun ban\nhad saved X lives (yes, they actually gave us a number) on the basis of\na look at the *number* of shootings rather than the *rate* of shootings?\nIt wasn't their fault that the population of DC dropped in their "post law"\nperiod...\n\n\n\nOkay, I'll concede I no longer have the numbers I once read on these.  I'll\nretract my dispute of your numbers.  However, I would be greatly interested\nin seeing how CPHV and CDC came up with these numbers.\n\n\nWhat's this got to do with anything?  Hell, when *I* was in elementary\nschool I came home to an empty house with guns in it.  Why is this a\nproblem?  I didn't touch the guns - I had been taught not to.  I had also\nbeen taught not to mess with the gasoline in the garage, the fuse box, the\ncar, the knives, the oven, and the tools.  The problem is not the guns,\nit's the parents!!!\n\n\nAnd what are these states doing with the kids they find with guns?\nNOTHING.  No criminal prosecution, no expulsion, in most cases not even\nsuspension.  They take the gun, slap the kids on the wrist, say "ain't it\nawful," and go on as if everything's back to normal.  What's wrong with\nthis picture?\n\n\nI don't think Koresh was the Messiah, either... but isn't it obvious that\nif he believed the forces of evil were come to destroy him, then he\nbelieved the children were much safer inside the compound?  I didn't say\nhe was sane... just that he behaved in a pretty rational manner given what\nhe thought was going on.  He thought he had them in the one place where\nharm *wouldn't* come to them.\n\n\nLet's see *you* try to find the exits, unbarricade them, and flee a fire\nwhen you've been kept awake for most of 50 days by loudspeakers and subjected\nto six hours of tanks knocking in your walls and tear gas assault.
In this case, it was unimportant as to who set the fire.  The Davidians\nwould have burned no matter what, ESPECIALLY if the BATF/FBI set the\nfire as this would make the beseiged martyrs to Vernon Howell and\ntherefore rocket to heaven.  A few comments from the remaining\nDavidians scattered throughout the country seemed to confirm this\ntheory (One cult member said that she wished that she had been there,\nand that now she would have to wait for Vernon to Return for them.  She\nactually seemed upset that she did not burn with them).\n\nWhile I think that Vernon started the fire (his followers anyway), \nit is incidental to their reaction.
The Brady Bill passed the House in 1992, but failed to reach a\nvote in the Senate.  As such, it never reached Bush.  (Sarah Brady's\ncondemnation not-withstanding).\n \n       It'll probably pass the House again, and will probably pass the\nSenate if they can get it to a vote.  Whether of not they'll be busy\nwith other things will be the question.  I don't expect gung-ho opposition\non the part of Senate Republicans, since they won't want to over-use their\nfillibuster trump card.
(Whatever the above comment has to do with the hazards of fighting a\nfire in the midst of ammo cooking off...)\nMaybe the fire department was loudly complaining the whole time about\nbeing diverted from their other duties, and the FBI said "FIne. Go home\nand we'll call you if we need you."  A million things could have happened,\nwe don't know.\n\nBTW, this is the first time I have heard that the Waco FD was on scene\nfor all but the last 2 days...  what's the source (out of curiosity)?
Editorial - A10, Saturday, April 24, 1993\n\n    CRIMESTRIKE HITS TOWN\n\n    With the chilling reality of crime at the hands of urban terrorists\n    that were noted above (a high school student and gang article in the\n    same column), we welcome into the ranks of those dedicated to re-\n    moving criminals from the streets the National Rifle Association's\n    new CrimeStrike project, engineered by Arizona's former chief assist-\n    ant attorney general Steven J. Twist.\n\n    CrimeStrike is working to reverse the disturbing trend of daily\n    crime.  It is promoting solutions that can be applied nationally,\n    including tough and honest sentencing of the sort that Arizona is\n    applying with its Truth in Sentencing law; funding construction and\n    staffing of appropriate prison space; ensuring that the system is\n    primed to punish serious youthful offenders; strict attention to the\n    rights of victims; and citizen and community involvement.\n\n    Phoenix will be the home for this national organization.\n\n    The Gazette has vigorously opposed many NRA policies on issues of gun\n    control, and will be resolute in promoting prudent laws that seek\n    reasonable regulation of firearms.\n\n    But CrimeStrike is an appropriate creation, a response to a clear\n    need for more robust vigilance in holding legislators and judges ac-\n    countable when it comes to swiftly and surely punishing criminals.\n\n    When an organization has an issue, it has an issue, and Crime-\n    Strike has it - especially when it is willing to direct its dollars\n    to getting criminals off the street.
[massive dan blather mercifully deleted.]\n\n\n\n\nLast time I checked, "amassing an arsenal" and practicing any kind of\nreligion were mentioned in passing in the Bill of Rights.  Guess it's\nOK with you if we just brush 'em aside in order to justify killing\na bunch of religious nutcakes, eh?\n\nOf all the idiots I run into in daily life, Dan, your type scare me the\nmost.  You'll accept expediency and a coward's safety over any belief\njust as long as the government tells you to.  You assume that anyone who\ndoesn't comform to your beliefs and ways of thinking are wrong and\ntherefore bad.  Worse, you seem to accept without question what the\ngovernment says is wrong to be wrong.\n\nDavid Koresh's religion was not mine but then again, neither are the baptists,\nmethodists, catholics or any of the rest of the corporate religions.  BUT\neven though Koresh's, the Baptists, the methodists, etc, don't believe\nthe same way I do, I recognize that their religions are equally valid\nto mine and more importantly are equally protected under the 1st Amendment.\nYou see, I'm not that much different than Koresh and I suspect many others\nfit the same catagory.  I read the Bible many times and as I learned \nfrom it, I discovered that a lot of what corporate religions practice\njust isn't justified by MY interpretation of the Bible.  Therefore I go\nmy own way.  So did Koresh.  And neither you nor I nor anyone else,\neither individually or collectively as the great socialist "we" has ANY \nRIGHT WHATSOEVER to tell me or you or Koresh that our religions are wrong.\n\nYou seem to think that it would have been oh so easy for the Davidians to\njust forsake everything they believed in and walk out of their compound\nin order to "save themselves".  Think (if you're capable) for a moment\nabout some belief you hold dearest.  Would you abandon that belief if\nsuddenly told to do so by the government?  If you would do so you are\nbeneath contempt.  Let's assume you have a belief that you hold dear\nenough to commit your life to.  Do you think it would be the correct\ncourse of action for your government to initiate actions specifically\ndesigned to force you to make that "forsake or die" decision?\n\nThe "forsake or die" option is exactly what the government forced on the\nDavidians the day the first wave of black-clad stormtroopers fired that\nfirst shot and tossed that first grenade.  The FBI clenched it on Day 51\nwhen they sent in heavy armor against 80-some-odd men, women and\nchildren holed up in a rickety old building and armed with small arms.  The\npeople who stayed, who held to their beliefs over personal safety, whose\nindividual personal honors demanded they die rather than submit, who\nbelieved that the Bill of Rights meant exactly what it says, to those\npeople go my deepest respect, regardless of their religion.  People like\nyou who blithely blow off the murder of 80 people with "well they could\nhave come out" get my most scornful contempt.  I'd spit in your face\nwere there not a network between us.  You're not worth the ashes of\nthose people who burned.\n\nJohn
Only because you are apparently easy to fool.  In other words, your\nremark is obviously from someone who wouldn't know the difference.\n\n-- \n"Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live\n in the real world."   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden
I see that I misphrased my question.  I should have asked WHICH\nfull-autos Kratz can accurately distinguish from semi-auto\nlook-alikes.  I should have also included some semi-auto only guns in\nmy list to see if he'd ask how to distinguish them from their\nnon-existent full-auto "relatives".\n\nLet's do the former now.  Kratz has claimed that he can visually\ndistinguish full-autos from semi-autos.  For which full-autos is he\nmaking that claim?  How does he do it?  Let's get specific, and as\nexhaustive as possible.\n\n\nMaybe?  Why is Kratz asking about what he told us that he knows?\n\nIs Kratz certain that he can distinguish a three position switch from\na two position switch via TV inspection?  (Does he even get to see the\nswitch in the typical police display of guns?)  Note that one might\nwell be able to see this sort of thing in a hands on visual inspection\neven though it won't be seen on TV.  And to think that Kratz was\ntelling us that seeing it on TV was just as accurate as being\nthere....\n\n\nWhy all the questions?  Kratz assured us that he could make this distinction\nand now he's asking us how he did it....\n\n\nWhat about it?  It only demonstrates that, as I predicted, Kratz\nwas blowing smoke on this.\n\n\n-andy wonders what Kratz is learning from this
I think this is a little extreme, i am concerned about a couple of things\ni've seen lately. It seems to me that the government is *beginning* to \nenforce political correctness. the first King verdict was polically incorrect\nso the hell with constutitional protection from double jeopardy, try the cops\nagain. the BD's are far as i can tell didn't do anything wrong. nothing that\nwould justify the horrable end they were subjected too. they were simply\npolically incorrect in the extream. i can't help but wonder "who's next"
The Branch Davidians were not violent and were not planning to start\nviolence.\n \nWhen the BD compound was assaulted by the ATF the BD did fire back.\nBut they agreed to a cease fire and they allowed the ATF to care for\ntheir wounded.  The BD even released the ATF agents they captured.  It\nis clear from the release of the agents and allowing the ATF medical\nattention that the BD were not looking for trouble.\n \nIf the BD were violent they would have held the ATF agents as\nhostages.  They would not have released them like they did.  If they\nhad kept the agents hostage they could have used them as bargening\nchips for medical attention etc.\n \nA big thing is being made of the BD collection of weapons but no one\nhas shown that they had any plans to use them.  It is also apparent\nthat the BD did not have any military training.  If they had, they\ncould have dug bunkers and trenches and increased their\nfortifications.  They could have shot out the lights and speakers.  It\nappears that the BD were not violent, they shot back at the attacking\nATF agents out of panic.  There were shots fired on the last day but\nthey were in response to the FBI attack on the compound with armor.\n \nAll the violence in Waco was initiated by the federal agents, not the\nBD.
......\n\nWhen did Koresh go on a rampage?\n\nWhat I saw was an unnecessary, unprovoked massive attack on Feb. 28th.\n\nProbably even an illegal action by ATF, certainly way out of proportion\nto anything reasonable.\n\nAnd yet, according to a pole taken yesterday, 95% of the people poled\nbelieve the government forces acted appropriately.  They don`t believe\nReno or the President have any guilt in ordering/allowing the attack.\n\nI suppose they also believed things like:\n"I would present a 5-year plan to balance the budget."\n"We don`t need to lead with a tax increase...."\n"It starts with a middle-class tax cut..."\n"I`ll have the bills ready the day after I am inaugurated and we`ll\nhave a 100 day period....It will be the most productive in modern history."\n"I will ask congress for a line item veto.."\n"I will lift the social security earnings test.."\n\nI personally prefer to disbelieve the government until they prove themselves\nright, rather than the other way around.  That way I have a better than\n50% chance of being right about my first guess!\n\nRead the constitution sometime, it is supposed to protect the citizens\nand their rights.  I am sick of the abuse of government power.

In the wake of the Waco denouement, I had email discussions with\npeople from this group.  In particular, we discussed how cults\noperate, why the FBI might be motivated to black out news or behave\nthe way it did, and what kinds of problems are involved in dealing\nwith cults and similar organizations.\n\nI include an edited account of what I wrote.  The identity of my\ncorrespondents have (I hope) been erased.  The editing process makes\nthe text choppy - sorry about that.  I've tried to retain the\ninformation content.\n\nEllipses (...) indicate where text was removed.  A few of the comments\nin parentheses are new, intended to make it easier for outsiders to\nunderstand.\n\nThese notes are preliminary - feel free to criticize.\n\nCheers(?),\nOded\n\n------------------------ (begin included text) -----------------------\n\nI took a course called the MADNESS OF CROWDS, ...  The course included\ncults and briefly mentioned/analyzed Jonestown.  (Did some external\nreading too).\n\nWilliam Adorno ... edited a series of books on the psychology of\n"evil" mass movements...  starting with THE AUTHORITARIAN PERSONALITY,\nUniversity of Chicago Press, 1948 ... an attempt to figure out what\nwould motivate people to support fascism or be the bad guys in WWII,\nand by extension in other wars, in racial lynchings ...  I don't think\nthe books are perfect, and the study of psychopathology has advanced\n..., but you can elicit Koresh types from even the first volume.  So I\nthink they're onto something.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n		How cult psychology works...\n	[I'm an amateur.  Hope I'm not hopelessly naive.]\n\nSo long as Koresh could "own" his people, he made sure they didn't\nbelieve there was any life out there for them, away from him.\nOtherwise, he'd (Koresh) be nothing.  During the siege, ex-Davidians\nrecounted how he convinced the people in the compound they survived\nonly through his intercession with God to spare their worthless souls.\nAbsolutely classic brainwashing technique. ...  As long as they\nbelieved him, they'd ignore BATF/FBI/Child Protective Services or even\nthe Red Cross asking them to come out.  After all, if they ever left\nhim, God would catapult them straight to Hell, and the combined forces\nof the US gummint, with all the goodwill in the world (doubtful)\ncouldn't save them for a second.  If I believed it, I'd stay and die\ntoo, like the folks in Jonestown.\n\nFor a prosaic analogy, replace a cult leader with an estranged wife\n(or husband), and notice how many folks show up, kill the ex and then\nthemselves.  That's the consequence of shattered "cultism."  It really\ndoes happen all the time.  [By the way, the treasured ideal in such\ncases, without which life is meaningless, is the relationship, no\nmatter how abusive, rather than the individual's partner.]\n\n...\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n    [Why No News, Don't The Feds Owe The World An Explanation?]\n\nI agree that official explanations are in order.  I can also see good\n(?)  reasons for news blackouts.\n\n\n ... that no matter what, those people would have died, because Koresh\nmade sure they believed they had no lives outside his influence.\nHence it would make little difference when or how the FBI acted.  He\nheld them hostage, as his trump against going to jail, but nothing\nwould really stop him from offing them.  Even if the FBI went away!\n\nLook at history.  Rep Leo Ryan (and some staffers) visited Jonestown,\nat the request of constituents who had relatives there.  Once\nJonestown was discovered, and even though they killed Ryan and his\nentourage ... they all killed themselves, because Jim Jones knew he'd\nbe busted.  Internal arguments asking to spare the children, brought\nup by some of the women in the cult, were shouted down.  There are\ntapes...  The "logic" of saying that no matter how bad the gummint is, it\nwouldn't kill the kids, was shouted down as blasphemy, and the people\nwho brought it up were threatened with ostracism by people who by\nTHEIR OWN AVOWAL would be dead within the hour.  I suspect it's the\nsame with the Branch Davidians.\n(There's a book on Jonestown by James Reston Jr., titled OUR FATHER\nWHO ART IN HELL.  I don't know whether it's good - never read it.)\n\n...\nThe only way to prevent such a problem would be never to investigate\nreports of child abuse or sexual mistreatment, or organizations buying\nfull-auto conversion kits or shipping hand grenades via UPS, on the\noff chance of stumbling across cults that would kill themselves. ...\n\nSo, the only way the BATF/FBI could "save" those people, and future\ncults, is by ignoring such signs.\n\nI suppose there's another way - outsmarting Koresh and tricking him\ninto letting them go, or somehow influencing "his" people to abandon\nhim while he owns most of their means of communication with the world.\n... a mighty tough row to hoe. ...  I suspect the FBI tried to do that\nwith blackouts, noise and other sensory insults.  However, maybe\nthey're not very sophisticated, or maybe the job is impossible.  It's\ncertainly possible the guy running the show was a jerk.\n\n...\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n	[Why the FBI might want to blackout during and coverup after]\n\n    ... - if they were doing a poor job of weaning the BD's from\nKoresh, they'd want to keep it quiet so they wouldn't be embarrassed.\n\n    ... - if they were trying to wean the BD's from Koresh, they'd\nwant to keep it quiet so he couldn't outflank them, or well-meaning\nboneheads from ANY point of view wouldn't screw it up. ...  I _hate_\nplaying chess when the world screams in my face, especially if at\ncheckmate time people really die, and I could be blamed.\n\n...\n\nI don't think ignoring such incidents is a workable policy, unless you\ndeny the FBI, BATF, Child Protective Services (of whatever stripe) and\nthe rest of the gummint should exist at all. \n\n		(the end)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------
(sic) Oh, you're really bright. As if nobody would have understood it was a\ntypo.\n\nSeveral parents with children who either had at one time or currently were\ninside the compound made the aforementioned charges. One parent actually\nspoke about said charges (in reference to his 13-year old daughter) WITH\nKoresh on the phone.\n\nYou missed my point entirely.\n\n\nSince you're unable to formulate a cogent response, you make a lame joke.\n\n\nAnti-social. Normally meaning a response against societal norms. Stealing\nis sociopathic behavior. It's not an oxymoron to have a GROUP of\nSOCIOPATHS. I guess you're NOT a psychologist.

I think it was - he went into town fairly often, and was known to go\njogging.  This was even during the 9 month period when he was being\nwatched.  One wonders why the BATF went ahead, when they had been warned\naccording to an interview with a BATF agent, that the BD were expecting\nthem, and why they had the media in tow.  Almost looks like they wanted\nto have a romp and a nice show for the media, and it all went to hell...\n\nHe was also never known to act violently.  He has always surrendered\npeacefully before (but of course, the warrants were served peacefully).\nHe has been tried on the allegations before and found NOT GUILTY.\n\nThe justification for this mess was he was alleged to have purchased\n$200,000.00 worth of guns and stuff (over an undetermined time period).\nLast I heard this is not a crime, or indication of one.  I know of an\nINDIVIDUAL with that much value in guns.  SHould he get a fly-thru-the-door\nshoot-first-talk-later raid?  (grenades are shooting first, nobody I\nknow of can say 'oh, thats only a stun grenade, thats OK...').  Can you?\nI sure cannot.  Also, one cannot be sure that 200K figure is not calculated\nlike the Feds calculate the value of a drug siezure...  Even so, it\nis a 'so what' issue...  He wasn't bothering anyone (besides the\nBATF who doesn't like folks other than themselves or other govt\npeople having any effective guns)... and having an unapproved\nreligeous group.  Are we required to not offend the BATF these\ndays?  I sure hope it hasn't come to THAT...\n\nMY point is, it DOES NOT ADD UP.  We need an independent investigation,\nand NOW.  Assuming other than FBI/BATF are preserving the evidence.\n\n\nThey had the premisis bugged.  I am inclined to think a further wait\nwould have saved lives.  One wonders why they didn't have emergency\ngear on hand when they moved, and why they didn't turn on the water\nwhen a fire was observed, instead of saying "aw, gee, there is no water".\n\nWhy so long before the fire gear even SHOWED UP - like after the building\nhad pretty much finished burning?  Fireman safety?  Isn't that a decision\nthe firefighters should be allowed to make?  No water?  Why didn't\nthe Feds TURN IT BACK ON?  They sure could cut it off quickly enough...\n\nOne does wonder about the possibility of 'settling scores'...\n\n\nWhat does 'taking responsibility' mean?  You think she is going to be\nfacing jail time if the acts were found to be criminal?  You think\nshe is going to face ANY repercussions if the FBI/BATF are found to\nhave acted wrongly?  I don't.  It is a nice PR gimmick, though.\n\nI am not assured there will even be a serious independent investigation\nfor possible wrongdoing or criminal acts on the part of the BATF or FBI.\nI expect to hear "they are our best law enforcement.  They wouldn't do\nanything like that - NO WAY.  OUT of the QUESTION.  End of issue".\n\nI want to see an INDEPENDENT investigation, with full prosecuting and\nsubpoena powers.  With felony prosecution where felony acts are found.\nFat chance, I bet.  I bet the Justice Dept will have an internal\ninvestigation which will turn up at most 'poor judgement'.\n\nI hope I am wrong, that this is gone over with a fine tooth comb.
STOP IT!!!! ENOUGH!!! I'm out of there!  I mean, I'm a relatively sane person. \nGod knows I'm weak and will forgive me.  But I'm not stupid enough to stay in\nthis place any longer.  I WANT OUT!!!\n\n\nYeah, and at least one person ran back in. SOunds like a personal choice to me.\nReligious fanaticsm, and a beleive that dying in the 'defense' of your beliefs,\nis probably at the core of what happened in Waco. We in the west tend to\ndisregard fanaticsm of the type displayed by many Moslem fundamentalist groups\nwho see nothing wrong with dying for their beliefs/convictions. I suspect that\nthis same type of fanaticsm was displayed by the BDs. BUt we'll probably never\nknow...

Look, I don't want to bore everybody here with the physics of woodstoves,\nbut they're not anything like your Caloric gas range.  It takes about\nthree hours for a woodstove to get hot enough to cook on, and afterwards \nyou can't just "shut it off" -- it will contain hot embers for over 24 \nhours even after you choke it COMPLETELY.\n\nSo it ain't exactly "light up the stove and cook me a batch of them \npancakes, Aunt J..."  If you use a woodstove for cooking, or even for\nheating your house at night, you will have it lit to SOME extent all \nthe time.  Trust me on this one, I speak from experience.\n--
It wasn't "invented", but was supposed by the writers of the Constitution\nto be a universal, pre-existing right. Howsomever...\n\n\nHmmm.  You need to spend some time in a library, son.\n\nWhen the Bill of Rights was written, in addition to the (muzzleloading)\nshotgun and pistol you mention we had:\n\n - rifles in calibers ranging from around .30 to .69 caliber and up.\n - cannon with various different projectiles to choose from (and owned\n   by civilians).\n - breech-loading rifles\n\nIn addition, semiautomatic and full-automatic firearms had been patented\nand/or demonstrated by several people in various places during the preceding\ncentury or so.\n\n\nSounds good.  Any refererences to this actually happening, or is it\njust exaggeration for effect following one or more incidents of someone\nfiring a handful of shots from something that may or may not be an\nUzi, semi- or full-auto?\n\n\nUntil the root conditions that justified it go away (criminal behavior,\neither private or government, which should be defended against), there's\nno reason it should go away.\n\n--
Which statement is dead wrong, because our local posters have confirmed that \nit was quite chilly that morning.\n\n\nNo, we argue that it was not entirely unreasonable for a woodstove to be \noperational.\n\n\nObviously you missed my earlier posting about the physica of woodstoves.\nIn brief, you can't turn your woodstove on and off like your gas range.\nIt stays on all the time.  It even stays "on" for over 24 hours AFTER you\nshut it off (which is why most working woodstoves aren't ever "shut off"\nuntil spring).\n--

NO SURRENDER!\nDelivered by Lenda Jackson at the RKBA Rally in Denver, April 18, 1993\n\nIt is a fact of modern life that urban residents, particularly women, feel\nthreatened. A certain number of them actually are threatened. There are\nimmediate threats, the things that women will tell you they're afraid\nof. The noise downstairs at night. The lonely walk to the car. The\nstranger at the door. The abusive husband, finally kicked out of the\nhouse as he threatens to hurt her and their children. The burglar... The\nmugger...the rapist. \n\nAnd what are we told is the solution? Move. Get a dog. Keep the door\nlocked. Call the police. as a next-to-last resort, learn martial arts. and\nalways, there's the implied question "what's a pretty little thing like\nyou doing without a husband around to protect you?\n\nBut what if you don't like dogs? Like living alone? Don't have 10\nyears to devote learning judo?\n\nWhat if, after examining the facts, a woman learns that "rape victims\nusing armed resistance were less likely to have the rape completed -\nand were less likely to be injured(Kleck,124) than those using any\nother form of resistance (Kleck,126) (also true for\nrobbery/assault)(Kleck,123) \n\nWhat if, to our horror and despair, we find that citizens cannot depend\non the police for effective protection - they usually respond after a\ncrime has been committed. In truth, the Supreme Court has held that\nthe police are not responsible for protecting any individual, only the\nwhole community.\n\nAs a society, are we going to ask women, once again, to sacrifice\nthemselves? Are we going to continue to deny women the ability to\nhelp themselves?\n\nHere's a thought. Neil Smith, in his book The Probability Broach, says\n"no 220 pound thug can threaten the well being or dignity of a 110-\npound woman who has two pounds of iron to even things out." But if\na woman decides to protect herself, with the easiest, most efficient\nmeans possible, people - especially other women - are horrified.\n"Eughh, how could you? I'd be terrified!" they ask. How could you\nhurt someone? They'll repeat the lie: it'll just get taken away from\nyou. In truth, 1% of "defensive gun uses" result in the offender taking\nthe gun away from the victim.(122,Kleck)\n\nWell, despite the lies, and the social pressure, some of us have already\nmade that hard choice. We've decided that we are not going to be\nvictimized by the muggers, burglars or rapists. We're buying more\nguns than every before. We're learning how to use them - and teaching\nothers, women and men, how to use them. Most importantly, we are\npreparing ourselves mentally to use our firearms for our own defense.\nWe're taking our own security, literally, into our own hands. We're\ngoing to stop begging and pleading and marching and WHAT WE\nINTEND IS TO REALLY TAKE BACK THE NIGHT.\n\nBut there's another threat, more insatiable than any mugger, more\nsecretive than any burglar, more soul-destroying than any rapist.\n\nThat menace is government, and it threatens us all. We know that\ngovernments, throughout time, have suppressed rights and oppressed\npeople. It's the way they survive.\n\nIn our names and with our money, it interferes with innocent people\nboth at home and abroad. It lies to us, cheats us, steals from us and\nthreatens us with violence. No one knows exactly what it'll do next -\nwhat freedom we will lose because some government goon decides\n"it's for your own safety" or "we know best". Any person who acted\nlike government does would be psychoanalyzed within an inch of his\nlife and locked up as a habitual offender.\n\nBut this monster called government persists, and grows. And we, who\nshould be its masters, have become its unwilling slaves. Do you doubt\nme? Then why did you file your income tax? \n\nLike any reasonable person, I believe that being afraid of something\nthat can hurt you is smart, and that paranoia isn't crazy if someone's\nreally after you. And make no mistake, they're after you and they're\nafter me. Their names are familiar: Brady and Reynolds, Groff,\nMetzenbahm, Moynihan, and Clinton. If we're lucky, they'll settle for\nour assault rifles, our shotguns, our handguns and our ammunition. \n\nAs citizens, we have only two choices. They are the same two choices\ngiven to women: to surrender or to fight. \n\nSurrender leads to the gulag, to the genocide of Pol Pot, to the\ndisappearances, to Dachau. I do not intend to surrender. \n\nA battle can be philosophical or political: in the main, the people keep\nthe government honest by threatening to vote it out of office. But if\nthey have to, they will keep in mind the words of Thomas Jefferson:\n"the tree of liberty must be well watered with the blood of patriots."\n\nAs a patriot, I will point out the error in the government's ways. I will\ndo my best to vote the villains out of office. I will protest, and write,\nand speak, and teach our children justice, honor and truth. And always\nremember that Rebellion can lead to Bunker Hill and Saratoga......or it\ncan lead to Tiananmen Square. \n\nWhen the time comes to stand up, if I have to give my life to keep\nthem from going too far, if there is a Tiananmen Square in our future,\nI intend to be there. And no matter what lies they tell and no matter\nwhat laws they pass, I intend to meet them with something more\nsubstantial in my hand than a brick.
Did anyone else notice how the question of what federal\nlaws were violated was brushed aside? I'd like to know\nwhat laws were violated, and on what evidence the orignial\nBATF warrants were based.

The number bounces between 2% and 18%, depending on the study quoted and\nthe type of gun being studied.\n\nSome cites:\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nA recent BATF study (titled "Protecting America, Yes") surveyed 471 career \ncriminals and found that only 7% of guns used in violent crimes were\npurchased from retail dealers.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nNational Institute of Justice\nResearch in Brief\n\nNovember 1986\n\n                        The Armed Criminal in America\n                              by James D. Wright\n\n(1) Legitimate firearms retailers play only a minor role as direct\n    sources of handguns for adult felony offenders.\n\nOnly about one-sixth of the gun-owning felons obtained their most\nrecent handguns through a customary retail transaction involving a\nlicensed firearms dealer.  The remainder -- five out of six --\nobtained them via informal, off-the-record transactions involving\nfriends and associates, family members, and various black market\noutlets.  The means of acquisition from these informal sources\nincluded cash purchase, swaps and trades, borrowing and renting, and\noften theft.  The criminal handgun market is overwhelmingly dominated\nby informal transactions and theft as mechanisms of supply.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nINDEPENDENCE ISSUE PAPER No. 4- 91\nIndependence Institute\n14142 Denver West Parkway #101\nGolden, CO 80401 \n(303) 279-6536\n\n              WHY GUN WAITING PERIODS THREATEN PUBLIC SAFETY\n                             By David B. Kopel\n\n     The basic problem with waiting periods is shown by a Bureau of Alcohol,\nTobacco and Firearms study of gun dealer sales in Des Moines and Greenville.\nThe study found that about one to two percent of sales were to dangerous\ncriminals.[51]  In short, waiting periods have no statistically noticeable\nimpact on any type of crime because only a tiny fraction of crime guns\nare purchased at retail by ineligible buyers.\n\n51. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Assistant Director of Criminal\nEnforcement, Memorandum to Director, July 10, 1975 (Greenville survey; of\n20,047 names submitted to FBI for record checks, 68 had felony convictions;\nof those, 41 had not been represented by counsel at their conviction or who\ncommitted crimes in the distant past; twenty-seven buyers were prosecuted)\n(of the 1.3% of buyers selected for prosecution, .9% had non-violent felony\nconvictions, and .4% had violent convictions). Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and\nFirearms, Assistant Director for Criminal Enforcement, memorandum to\nDirector, May 8, 1975 (of 374 records checked, 39 were purchasers with felony\nrecords who were not appropriate for prosecution because of age or\nnon-violent nature of felony; six purchasers were prosecuted).\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nINDEPENDENCE ISSUE PAPER No. 12-91\n\n                          THE ASSAULT WEAPON PANIC:\n                      POLITICAL CORRECTNESS" TAKES AIM\n                            AT THE CONSTITUTION\n\n                      By Eric Morgan and David Kopel\n\n     Testimony before Congress revealed that most "assault weapons" in the\nhands of criminals were obtained through illegal channels.{97}  The testimony\nis consistent with the National Institute of Justice's research findings\nbased on studies of felons in state prisons. The NU study, authored by\nsociologists James D. Wright and Peter Rossi found that only sixteen percent\nof criminals had obtained their most recent handgun from a gun store. (The\nfigures included purchases by legal surrogates, rather than directly by the\ncriminal.) Wright and Rossi, who had begun their research as firm proponents\nof gun control, concluded that no set of controls on retail purchases, and\nprobably not even full scale gun prohibition, would reduce criminal use of\nguns. Wright and Rossi suggested that lawmakers concerned about gun crime\ndirectly target the black market in criminal guns, and\nleave the legitimate retail market alone.{98}   Not surprisingly, Wright\nbelieves that the consequences of current "assault weapon" legislation on\nstreet violence are likely to be ineffective.{99}   He warns that gun\ncontrols aimed at ordinary citizens are less likely to reduce the pool of\ncriminal guns than to provide organized crime with lucrative new\nbusiness.{100}\n\n6.   _See, _e.g., The Anti-drug, Assault Weapons Limitation Act of 1989.

The paucity of this line of argument is that it is provably false.\n\nTexas state officials COULD and DID investigate child abuse charges.\nThey COULD and DID apprehend Koresh peaceably.  The COULD and DID\nimpound his weapons for the duration.  And Koresh was NOT CONVICTED.\n\nNote that child abuse and similar accusations are STATE matters, not\nfederal.  The state COULD and DID handle them properly and peaceably,\nand furthermore violating no one's constitutional rights in the process.\n\nSo maybe the best way for BATF/FBI to save people is to mind their \nown fucking business.\n--

Those of us who questioned the mass suicide line may still have \nwondered, "If it wasn't suicide, why did so few get out?"

==========================================================================\n  Yes, we do have a beautiful country. And I enjoy it.  Most of all, I\n  enjoy the thought that I have the means and can exercise my rights\n  to defend me and mine. \n \n  And I want to thank all of you good folks, like Prescod, who remind me\n  of what I have.  Along this line, I watched a documentary on one of the\n  Nazi concentration camps.  Stacks and stacks of bodies.  There were scenes\n  of Hitler speechifying, and what struck me, was the reverence and adoration\n  on the faces of the people in the crowds.  I guess they were happy that\n  Hitler had implemented full gun control and was taking care of the Jewish\n  problem all at the same time.

True.\n\n\nNo more risk than smaller stashes unless the stash is somehow confined so\nthe heat from early ignitions could somehow bulk-heat the remainder.\n\nTwo  years ago this month my house and office burned.  In my office was my\nreloading bench.  On the top shelf next to the wooden ceiling was \nabout 100 lbs of smokeless powder, 5 lbs of black powder, several thousand\nprimers and a couple thousand loaded rounds, primarily in .45ACP, .30-20\nand .308.  The fire was extinguished before the area containing the \nreloading supplies were fully involved.  There was about 1/2" of char on\nthe joists, subsequently removed by sandblasting.  Lots of heat in other\nwords.\n\nNone of the powder kegs ignited.  One 1lb can of pistol powder ignited.\nNo explosion, as the can opened at the seam as it was designed to do.\nThe black powder cans were charred and got so hot the plastic lids\ncompletely melted and ran down inside.  The smokless powder was\ncontained mostly in 8 lb cardboard or metal kegs.  The kegs were charred\nbadly enough that the paper labels burned completely off and in the case\nof the metal cans, the plastic lids melted completely away.\n\nMany of the rounds cooked off.  They were in close proximity to wood\non all sides so the effects were easy to observe.  In most cases with the\nrifle ammo, the cartridge cases ruptured in the middle.  Many bullets were\nfound still in the neck.  Small shards of brass were lightly stuck into \nthe wood.  Lightly enough that brushing them with a fingertip would usually\ndislodge them.  Primers generally popped out of the primer pockets.\nThe .45ACP rounds that cooked off left empty cases and bullets laying around.\nNo dents were observed above the storage area, indicating the bullets\nleft the cases slowly enough not to be a hazard.\n\nOrdinary small arms ammo is NOT a hazard when cooking off regardless\nof what the FBI says.  \n\nJohn

Why sell them at a low price to poor people immediately?  The NRA\nis an educational organization too, after all, and it would be a shame\nto pay all that money for new guns when these cheap guns would allow a\nlot of money thus saved to be used in opening more classes.

I'd bet cash 90% of the people couldn't find the window after six\nminutes!  Ask anybody who's taken basic training in the military.

Funny, Brent, but so far we have heard two versions of the "facts:"\n\n1) What the government says.  This includes what the government says that\n   two survivors have said.\n\n2) What Koresh's lawyer (who was actually inside the compound) says,\n   including what he says that most of the survivors have said.\n\nStrange, but they seem to disagree in most important particulars.\n\nIf anyone has actually seen news reports of any of the survivors\nspeaking first-hand, feel free ot pitch in.

While it may mean that in 1993, the relevant meaning comes from 1789.\nMoreover, "controlled" doesn't tell you WHO's doing the controllling.\n\nFletcher's Political Works, pub'd in 1749, defines a "well-regulated\nmilitia", that being the relevant phrase, as being an armed people NOT\nunder the control of govt.  The wigged gents who argued about the\nconstituion used it in that way.\n\nFeel free to provide a 1790s-era reference showing a usage other than\n"individual right, not to be interfered with by govt".\n\nNote that the first clause has a meaning - it is a restriction on\ngovt military power.  See Scarry's University of Penn law review\narticle for an extended discussion.  The existence of a well-regulated\nmilitia is a necessary part of that restriction, but it is not sufficient.\n\n-andy

Apologies to those who were confused.\n\nThe substance makes little sense unless one reads the prior messages.\n\nHowever, I don't wish to enter into this discussion here, as it will be yet\nanother rehearsal of a long-tired set of arguments. Suffice it to say that I\ndisagree both with the interpretation of "well-regulated" in the Second\nAmendment offered by gun lovers, and what I think to be their distortion of\nthe same phrase in the associated Federalist papers. My Webster and my\nreading of the language convinces me that the word meant both under control,\nand disciplined, and not 'of good marksmanship'. I think the latter a\nspecial interest pleading. No one has yet shown a contemporateous reference\nin which "well regulated" unambiguously meant 'of good marksmanship', and\nnot under control/disciplined, etc.\n\nThus I continue to believe the Second Amendment is a militia clause and not\nan 'arming everyone' clause. Others are welcome to disagree (as I know many\ndo) and little would be served by rehashing this topic in this particular\nforum.\n\nTo avoid flames, or unproductive rehashings, I note that I've come in here\nto post this one message, just to clarify the one below. I'm now outta here\nagain though I'm available via e-mail.\n\nDavid
Folks,\n\nIt's time to start building some precise questions to send to our\nfederal elected officials and to investigative reporters in our\nlocal TV, radio and newprint media.  Ideally, these questions could be\nasked at any investigation into the BATF's and FBI's participation\nat the WACO fiasco in hopes of being resolved and, hopefully, wake\nup the local news media that they are not getting the entire truth\nfrom the BATF and FBI.  My list is up to 13 that are really nagging \nat my gut.  The list will probably grow. \n\n1.   What were the contents of the original warrant, now sealed, that\n     the BATF obtained?\n\n2.   It is reasonable to believe that illegal firearms and/or ammunition\n     could not be flushed down the toilet.  Therefore, a "no-knock"\n     raid could be ruled out.  Prior to the initial assault on the \n     complex, did a single BATF agent and accompanying witness (without \n     a contingent of assault and news media personnel) attempt to knock \n     on the door of the Branch Davidian's complex and serve the warrant \n     in a manner prescribed by law?\n\n3.   On the day of the initial assault on the complex, BATF agents\n     were aware that several small children were inside the buildings.\n     In the ensueing gun battle, BATF agents fired into a building\n     known to contain children, killing at least one two-year old child.\n     Knowing children were present, why didn't the BATF have an\n     alternate plan and immediately retreat from the area close to\n     the complex and implement the alternate plan rather than opening\n     fire and jeopardizing the lives of the children in the building? \n\n4.   The FBI spokesman states that paper evidence indicates that\n     David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians possessed over\n     $200,000 in firearms and ammunition.  Did David Koresh and the\n     members of the Branch Davidians have a valid Federal Firearms\n     License, were they actively participating in the legal business\n     of selling/buying firearms and ammunition, and were any of the\n     weapons they had illegally possessed?  Does this paper evidence\n     consist only of weapons purchased or does it include legally\n     dispossessed weapons.\n\n5.   After the original assault on the compound tragically failed,\n     a BATF spokeswoman stated "We were outgunned!".  Yet, TV newscasts\n     of video tape filmed at the time of the incident show BATF agents\n     armed with MP-5 and AR-15/M16 rifles.  Although unclear on the\n     video tape because of obstruction from full view by agent's\n     bodies, they also may have had AK-47 and SKS rifles.  What type(s)\n     of firearms did the BATF agents have immediate access to at the \n     scene of the original assault on the complex?\n\n6.   Since there is no evidence to confirm anyone was inside the\n     complex involuntarily, why did the FBI treat it as a "hostage"\n     situation? \n\n7.   Along the same lines, why did the FBI use "psychological warfare"\n     techniques, including sensory overload, sleep deprivation, and\n     other disruptive techniques that would test the sanity of any \n     normal person rather than using techniques aimed at placing the \n     complex occupants into a calmer frame of mind?\n\n8.   Reports indicate several of the children inside the complex\n     were accompanied by their mothers.  Since it is reasonable\n     to expect these mothers would have their children taken away\n     from them if they came out, why did the FBI expect the mothers\n     to just walk out and surrender themselves to the authorities?\n\n9.   Agents at the scene claim to have seen members of the Branch\n     Davidians setting fire to the complex.  Branch Davidian members\n     who survived the inferno claim the fire was started when an \n     armored vehicle punched through the wall and knocked over a \n     lantern which was setting on a table.  Video tape of the incident \n     does show an armored vehicle punching a hole in the wall and the \n     fire erupted almost immediately from the same general location.  \n     Was the source of the fire the same room where the armored vehicle \n     penetrated?\n\n10.  FBI spokesmen are voicing the opinion that the David Koresh and\n     the members of the Branch Davidians committed mass suicide.  Yet,\n     bodies are being discovered throughout the house and other areas\n     within the building complex.  This seems to be counter to any\n     known mass suicides through history.  What evidence does the FBI\n     have that a mass suicide pact existed?\n\n11.  FBI Director Sessions stated that the massive fireball shown on\n     the video tape was caused by the Branch Davidian's ammunition\n     and/or powder cache exploding.  Yet, the fireball seems to be\n     more characteristic of the type created when compressed gas\n     or other highly volatile fuel source explodes.  Was any evidence \n     found which would indicate the Branch Davidians had an ammunition \n     and/or powder cache which exploded to create this fireball?  If so,\n     and if David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians were \n     engaged in the legal business of selling/buying firearms, was the\n     amount determined to be excessively greater than one would expect\n     for someone engaged in such a legal business?\n\n12.  It is rumored that one FBI agent was extremely upset about critical\n     news media coverage and intentionally used an armored vehicle to\n     crush a reporter's car which had been left at the compound.  Is \n     there any factual basis to this rumor and, if so, what charges will \n     be brought against the FBI agent who performed the act?\n\n13.  FBI Director Sessions states that, during the final assault on the\n     complex, "over 80 shots were fired at the vehicles."  On the video\n     tape of the incident, you can hear the drone of the armored vehicles\n     engines.  Yet, there is no sound of the sharp reports that one\n     would expect to hear if shots were fired.  Also, there are no \n     indications of smoke and/or muzzle flashes appearing from the windows,\n     buildings or other structures in the video.  Surely, these should be \n     evident if the Branch Davidians had fired on the armored vehicles.  \n     Finally, the video tape does not show any indication of paint splatter, \n     sparks or other characteristic spray of material which should be \n     apparent if the Branch Davidians had fired upon the vehicles.  Do \n     any of the armored vehicles which were brought in to pump tear gas \n     into the compound show evidence of fresh damage due to being hit by \n     shots from high-power rifles?\n\n14.  CS gas is considered to be a chemical warfare agent.  The United\n     States has signed international treaties which prevent the use\n     of CS gas in warfare.  If the United States could not morally use\n     CS gas against Saddam Hussein and his troops, why is it morally\n     acceptable to use the same agent against citizens of our own land?\n\n15.  On April 21, FBI spokesmen state that at least 3 bodies discovered\n     in the complex had bullet wounds to the head indicating they had\n     been murdered or had committed suicide.  On April 22, the county\n     coroner claims he knows nothing about any bodies found with bullet\n     wounds to the head.  Were any of the victims bodies found within\n     the burned out complex have bullet wounds to the head?

Just saw a new commercial(?) by the NRA. It starts out with a \nbunch of politicians talking about how to get rid of crime.\nThey finally realize that they need to put criminals away\nlonger but there isn't enough jail space so they decide on another gun\nlaw.( During this whole seen there quoteing various statistics on how\neasy criminals get off ) \nIn the next seen the politician is announceing on tv how this gun law \nwill get rid of crime and there is this grungy looking guy (criminal)\nwatching him on tv just laughing his ass off.\nClassic.
After seeing William Sessions on television, explaining the great lengths\nto which the FBI went to determine the suicidal tendancies of David Koresh, \nI got the very unpleasent feeling that Koresh had manipulated the FBI's \nperceptions much the way he manipulated his own followers.\n\nMaybe I was manipulated by the news story.
Mark 'Mark' Sachs <MBS110@psuvm.psu.edu>, representing the Students for \n\n\n\n\nWell, I only saw it start in one place.  A tank punched a hole in a wall,\nand as it withdrew flames came out and spread quickly in the direction that\na 30+ mph wind was blowing.  I saw a diagram in USA Today yesterday, and\nfires started at 2 of the 3 holes that the tanks made.  A terrible, negligent\naccident.\n\n\n\n\nMaybe they couldn't.  I've often marvelled at how people could get burned alive\nin the upstairs of a 2 story house on fire, but it happens all the time.\nWhat if they were in sealed rooms, trying to avoid the gas, and didn't know\nabout the fire until it surrounded them?  Remember the Israelis hiding in\nsealed rooms during Desert Storm to avoid gas-bearing Scuds?\n\nCripes, Mark, are you REALLY a college student?  Maybe you ought to stop\nworrying about increased beverage access and start clearing your head.\nEver heard of questioning authority? \n\n\n\nOK, I'll buy that.  You _do_ seem totally clueless...\n\n\ncontrary. \n\nWellllll....  They weren't murderous.  They'd never harmed or even threatened \nanybody until they were attacked by a paramilitary force using military weapons\nand hardware.  And as far as "evidence", what are you talking about?  \nEverything the Feds have said they've retracted practically as soon as they get\nquestioned in detail about it.  Maybe you and your Increased Beverage\nAccess buddies, sitting around the bar slurring stuff like "they shoulda\nkilled 'em all 51 days ago" don't feel that way, but then you're probably\none of those people still saying about Klinton "Give the guy a chance, we don't\neven know what he's gonna do! (Burp)\n\n\n\n\nNo problem, you don't have any questions that scare any of us.  Most of our\nminds are apparently more developed than yours.  \n\nThe answer is:  *YES!*  In a f*cking heartbeat!  \n\nThought Experiment:  Would you be mindlessly down on your knees with your mouth \nopen, blissfully sucking up anything the Feds said if Bush were the president?\nWhat, no comeback?  (OK, go ahead, say it.  "Read my lips, no new taxes" %^P   )\n\n\n\n\nNot in such a great degree.  Bush broke one promise, maybe two (taxes/guns)\nand we held him accountable for it.  Of course, it took him the better part of\n4 years to do it;  Slick's only been in office 101 days and he's broken lots\nof them.  Anddd...  I imagine he'll also be held accountable for that.\n\n(I can just see the campaign buttons now:   "ABC - Anybody But Clinton")\n\n\nHmmm.... Apparently you just got here.  Nobody's claiming that it was anything\nbut a stupid mistake by a bunch of incompetent public employees who normally\ndon't get this kind of scrutiny when the mess up.  And as far as how they picked\nthe Davidians, who knows?  Maybe they figured that nobody'd care about such\na politically incorrect group as a bunch of fundies out on the Texas prairie.\nMaybe they figured they'd just go in there and run roughshod over the BDs\nduring their religious services (which was the reason the Feds gave for the\ntiming of the raid) rather than running into resistance.  Maybe they KNEW\nthat the BDs weren't ANYWHERE NEAR as violent as the Feds' spin doctors are\ntrying to tell the public.  Maybe they were AFRAID to try this kind of thing\non the Crips and Bloods.  Maybe it was because the ATF's budget is up for\napproval and they seem to favor doing something dramatic whenever that is\nthe case.  Of course, their reasoning doesn't matter, only what they did,\nand this time, people are just paying more attention to it.\n\n\n\nNot if you mean that stupid "don't stop thinking about tomorrow"...\n\n\nAll I've ever heard is Hillary's diabolical giggle.  Waffle Man seems to have\nlost his sense of humor...\n\n\nDon't know, never seen him in one.  He probably looks fat and puffy faced,\njust like in a suit.  I saw him in the Rose Garden the other day, and I\ncouldn't get over how much he is starting to look like Teddy Kennedy.\n\n\n\n\nDon't worry, these things WILL be investigated.  Now go back to your beer,\nyou dimwit....
Drop three billiard balls on a ramp, and they all roll in the same\ndirection.  Pour some blood into the sea, and sharks will converge\nfrom miles around.  Throw a pebble at one starling, and all 200 will\ndepart.\n\nNatural processes can mimic the outward results of conspiracy when no\nactual conspiracy is required.\n\nPut a government functionary in an embarrassing situation, and he\nquickly covers his ass.\n\nThis, too, is completely natural.\n\n\nIt looks that way to me, too.  But you have to understand that it's NOT \nthe first time they have instigated raids like these.  The most recent\none ALSO ended up in a long standoff, but it wasn't quite as public\nas this one, and they didn't kill quite as many people.  Maybe this \nscrewup will make them think long and hard about raiding any more \nresidences in this manner.  But probably not.\n\n\nI assume you're talking about Philadelphia.\n\n\nIf you're a fan of conspiracies, the time to make that batch of\npopcorn is AFTER the screwup, when it's time for the coverup.\n--
In the interest of accuracy (seems a liitle late to start\nthat, I know) the medical examiner has *not* contradicted\nthe FBI.\n\nThe FBI said they found some folks who had been shot in\nthe head, and the medical examiner said "we have not seen\nevidence of this".\n\nAt the time the medical examiner said that, they were dealing\nwith charred bodies in the compound - this sounds like\ntypical medical examiner not releasing details until\na thorough investigation.  The medical examiner saying\nhe hasn't seen something is *not* the same thing as saying\nthat it isn't there.
The Houston Chronicle last Thursday (maybe Wednesday) said that\nthe interior of walls had been covered with hay bales to help\nprotect against bullets.  Many of you know how fast dry hay\nburns.\n\n\nIn addition, the gas is specifically designed to force eyes\nclosed and the victim to vomit.  How fast could you leave your\nburning office or home if your eyes were closed and you were\nretching violently?\n\n\n\n--

However, the injustice implied in letting\nthose involved escape without investigation and/or prosecution is also\nhorrible to contemplate.\n--
The BATF got sat on pretty early on.  After the initial shooting\nwas over, it pretty much become the FBI's show.  (Even that BATF guy\nstopped showing up next to the speaker at the daily press conferences).
Firearm?  Let's not even consider long knives (swords), which were also\ncommon militia weapons in the 18th century, and which, if anything, are\noften restricted more heavily than firearms.  Whatever sense gun control\nmakes, knife control makes even less.\n--
No joke.  Here's another copy for you to save.  NPR, hmmm?  Did they\nmention the part about "The fact of law enforcement access to the\nescrowed keys will not be concealed from the American public." ...?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here are a few ideas:\n\n1) a free library card so they can look up the FBI\n   Uniform Crime Report which shows how good HCI is\n   at lying through their teeth,\n\n2) a free RTD Transit Pass which will allow anti-gunners\n   to tour South Central Los Angeles and convince\n   people living there that they don't need guns to protect\n   themselves because the police will do it for them \n   (don't lose the pass, you'll need it to get out),\n\n3) a free bus ride to Vermont, which has almost no gun\n   control and, curiously enough, almost no crime either,\n\n4) a free calculator, since anti-gunners have heretofore\n   been unable to figure out what a small percentage of\n   the guns owned in America are used to commit violent crime.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nLee Gaucher    NRA                  |  My opinions.\ngaucher@sam.cchem.berkeley.edu      |  No one else's.
*sigh*\n\nIt is standard procedure to suspend law enforcement officers, or re-assign\nthem to administrative (non enforcement) duties, while an investigation\ninto possible misconduct is going on. The Administration has given no\nindication that such suspensions will occur in this case. And given that\nthe president, attorney general and governor were all involved in the\ndecisions that led to the Waco Massacre, they should also suspend all\nactivities regarding law enforcement. Given their positions, that equates\nto an enforced vacation.

I tend to agree, but I would like a better explanation of why the FBI stopped  \nthe firetrucks at the gate.  I saw this in realtime.  It concerns me that the  \nFBI "appeared" to not be too interested in stopping the fire after it started,  \nand actually started flying hueys around the compound, which had to add in some  \nsmall part to the winds driving the fire.\n\nJim\n--\njmd@handheld.com

I believe that this is not quite correct. My understanding is that LDS is\nengaged on a project to "convert" the souls of deceased persons of other\nreligions, in order to spare them from damnation and gain them entrance into\nheaven. To this end, the Church has compiled extensive genaeological records, so\nthat they will know the names of people to convert. A long article in the New\nYorker a few years ago described the LDS research methods in some detail (for\nexample, some researchers pay visits to local native storytellers to learn the\nnames of people long dead). This sounds like just the sort of lie that would be\nmade up about any unusual religion, but the New Yorker story convinced me that\nthere is some truth to it (the New Yorker used to do extensive fact-checking, and\nthe story was quite detailed).
Jason - I've heard the people who are talking about this dismissed as\nconspiracy nuts, but nobody seems to be talking about a conspiracy, at\nleast at the beginning.  There were a lot of bad decisions that went into\nthis tragedy, and some people may now be taking some serious evasive\naction to avoid being held responsible for the unexpected results of\nthose bad decisions.  Actually, the only ones I see that are tied into\na conspiracy theory are the ones raving about deranged cultists with\nstockpiles of weapons and suicide pacts.\n\n\n\nI think there are a lot of us that have been following this pretty closely\nfrom the beginning, and we woud probably agree that this tragedy was more\nthe result of stupidity than malice.
I'm not sure were this thread has been before i popped in, but I've never\nthought of waiting periods as having anything to do with training or\ncompetence. I just can't imagin any valid reason for having a gun that\ncan't wait a few days. I can think of plenty of bad reasons for not\nwanting a waiting period: I want to buy a gun and kill so-and-so right\nnow, I've crossed the state line to buy a gun illegally and I can't\nafford to spend the night here, etc.\n\nI'm not a big fan of guns, but I feel that it is important to guard\nAmerican's rights to own them. On the other hand, we license and regulate\nmany things without seriously impeding anyones constitutional rights.
You are correct WRT the idea of some heating being nice that morning.  But \npart of that line was also for the guy who said "minutes later, the fires\nstarted".

Their neighbours thought they were a little\nstrange but all in all the kind of people you would want to live\nnext door to.\n\nOne version has the BATF serving a *search* warrant by jumping out\nof a horse trailer with guns and tossing concussion grenades.  If\nthis is the true order of events then the 'cult' could not know\nthat a search warrant was being served and since there was no proof\nthat these guys were police,  the 'cult' had every right to defend\nthemselves.\n\n: Torching themselves shows briliant tactics, and convinces me\n: they *realy* belong in society ...\n\nIf you watch actual footage of the fire from start to finish it\nis not at all clear that fire wasn't started by the tanks.  The\npeople who survived are claiming that the fire was started by\nthe tanks knocking over some kerosene lanterns.  The FBI is\nclaiming that the 'cult' started the fire.\n\n'they *realy* belong in society' is a catchy phrase but\nI'm personally waiting to see what the Texas Rangers have to say\nabout it all before I pass judgment.   Why don't you do the same.\n\nSome more interesting facts about the Waco incident:\n\n1)  The original assault was conducted by BATF officers wearing\n    an assorted types of camouflage.  I saw, on CNN, at least\n    three different types.   I would be hard pressed to identify\n    a bunch of guys in 'bring-your-own' battle fatigues as\n    uniformed officers of the law even if they were claiming to\n    be police.\n    \n2)  The BATF has been lying from the beginning:\n    + "We only had handguns" - the original footage showed 4 BATF\n      officers on a roof top getting shot at,  one had an MP-5\n      assault sub-machine gun.\n    + "We were out gunned" - sub-machine guns and shotguns are the\n      BEST in quarters weapon,  you can't be out gunned when you\n      have the best guns available for the job.\n    + "We didn't know they had guns that would shoot through doors!" -\n      this one is the best,  there are very few guns that won't shoot\n      through a household door,  or through a house WALL for that\n      matter.  Since officers from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and\n      *Firearms* should know that,  they are either lying or incredibly\n      incompetent.  Not to mention criminally negligent if they are\n      shooting bullets that they think will stop when the encounter\n      plywood.\n    + "We had a search warrant.  Actually, we had an arrest warrant.\n       No, wait,  we had both.  Yeah, that's the ticket.\n       Oh, and they're child molesters too.  And they make *drugs*.\n       Did we mention we think they have rocket launchers."\n      - The story from BATF and FBI spokespeople has changed daily\n      and their claims were getting increasingly outrageous.\n      \n3)  Throughout the siege the FBI and BATF have be claiming that one\n    of their biggest concerns was that Koresh and his followers would\n    mass suicide.   Now they are claiming that that's what he did\n    AND that they are surprised that he did.  Huh?\n\nAll in all I think that anything the FBI and BATF say should be\ntaken with a grain or two of salt.\n\nRob.
Once again, Koresh closed the door on an agent with a search warrant,\nand the door was then perforated by a rain of bullets from the\ninside.\n\nThey shot first.
That doesn't count as getting rid of the press.  Getting rid of the press\nwould mean getting them far enough away so that they wouldn't be able to\nsee what is going on.
I am not a paranoid, nor a government toady, nor even am I the guy you were\ntalking to originally, but I think you are simply NOT PAYING ATTENTION.\n\n  A bunch of people living off by themselves with a lot of guns nearby is not\nthat wierd in Texas.  My own family, very quiet taxpayers with extremely con-\nventional views, has something like 10 rifles and shotguns in a two-person\nhome.  Some of them were mine, but I don't live there anymore.  I now have\nmy own shotgun in my apartment.\n\n  Texas Child Protective Services (which loves to find child abuse) found no,\nI repeat NO, evidence of abuse when they first looked at the BD, and is saying\nthat they see none in any of the kids who were released.  There is no evidence\nthat Koresh was banging anyone but his wives.\n\n  It is not against the law to stockpile (most) weapons or campbell's soup.  \nNor is there any hard evidence in the form of actual hardware (as I write this)\nto prove the BD really had any *proscribed* weapons.\n\n  I feel they were all loonies, but there is no indication that they ever \nbothered anyone.  They were gone after in the wrong ways for the wrong reasons,\nand the BATF and FBI who are so busy trumpeting this child abuse angle hasn't\ngot a leg to stand on or any right to be involved in such abuse cases anyway. \nIf there was any real danger of the BD's going out on a rampage, then that\nis up to the officers of the state of Texas, who are probably getting a per-\nverse bit of pleasure at getting to torque the Feds for fucking up something\nin their state.\n\nsemper fi,
From article <1r0mhtINNa59@cronkite.Central.Sun.COM>, by dbernard@clesun.Central.Sun.COM (Dave Bernard):\n\nI noticed that too.  Special agent (asshole actually) Ricks stated that\nDavid Koresh had "explosives that could blow up an armored vehicle 40\nfeet into the air."  It looked like to me that the BDs had plenty of\nopportunity to use these explosives---provided that they had them in the\nfirst place.  For example, when one of the tanks was injecting CS gas\ninto the ranch house (yes ranch house; the BDs weren't living in a\nfortress) they could have easily destroyed or disabled that tank because\nit was idling there for a considerable length of time.  So, why didn't\nthey do this?  Could it be that they didn't have any explosives or\nsimilar munitions?  I just don't buy what the ATF and FBI have been\nsaying.  Hopefully, the truth will come out.\n\nHere's something noteworthy:  after the fire had been burning for some\ntime an explosion occurred---just *one* explosion.  The media said that\nthis was some of the explosives that the BDs posessed going off.  I\ndon't think this was the case.  My brother and I noticed that this\nso-called "explosion" resembled a plume of propane gas being ignited.\nWe figure that this is what it was because of how the "explosion"\nlooked and sounded.  Obviously, it wasn't due to something like TNT,\ndynamite, or C4.  I have seen a propane explosion before...the explosion\nin the ranch house greatly resembled this.  Also, I noticed something\nthat looked like a propane tank in the charred ruble the next day.\n\nIsn't it curious that the ATF wasn't very forthcoming about how the four\nofficers got killed?  Many weeks had gone by before they stated that\nsome of the officers had been killed and/or wounded by grenades thrown\nby the BDs.  Earlier, when someone asked one of the spokespersons about\nwhether or not an autopsy had been performed on the slain agents, they\nsaid that an autopsy had been done but THEY WEREN'T READY TO RELEASE\nTHE FINDINGS.  Now why is this?  Does the ATF have something to hide?\nPerhaps those four agents were killed by friendly fire.  What is the\ncause of death exactly?  NO ONE HAS EVER SAID WHAT IT IS.\n\nWhat is certain is this:  ATF agents *did* throw grenades into the\ncompound.  As a matter of fact, Mr. Koresh handed his lawyer a grenade\nbody during one of the lawyer's visits to the compound.  Later on\nthe lawyer gave the grenade body (I don't know if it was a dud or a\nspent one btw) to the ATF.  How much do you want to bet that this\ngrenade will mysteriously disappear?  At this point in time the only\npeople we know who had grenades was the ATF agents.  Wouldn't it be\na shocker if the no one ever found any evidence of grenades, rockets,\nor explosives in the rubble?  The ATF would sure have egg on their\nface then.  Note that the ATF is doing the *initial* sweep of the\nrubble.  The FBI and the Texas Rangers won't investigate until the\nATF is done.  This looks like a perfect opportunity for the ATF to\nmake sure that others "find" what they want for them to "find" if\nyou know what I mean.  I'm probably being a little paranoid here\nbut if I am I have could reason to be.  Recall that several weeks\nhad gone by before anyone said that the BDs had used grenades.\nAlso recall that early on the ATF had *denied* that their agents\nused grenades on the BDs.  Someone is lying here.\n\n\nScott Kennedy,  Brewer and Patriot
Neither.  \n\n\nYou don't have to pay attention to any one source, neither do you\nhave to abandon your critical thinking, but to disregard all sources\nof information as 'lies' and 'distortions' and substitute your own\npet theories is more likely to get you wild untruths than by basing\nyour theories on the 'facts' as they are reported by the media and\nthe government.\n\n\nActually there was evidence of the fire being set deliberately -\nboth testamony by the survivors and IR tape showing the fire\nbeing set in 3 places AND the petrochemical soot that the fire \nwas giving off (indications of kerosine or gasoline feeding the\nfire).  \n\nYou might not believe 1 or 2 if you are totally paranoid or very\nskeptical, but my 3rd point is visible to anyone who watches the\ntapes of the fire and has started a BBQ grill.\n\n\nHo ho ho.  I listen to NPR, watch CNN, NBC.  I also read the\npapers.   Where do you get YOURS?
As quoted from <nate.1504.735838830@psygate.psych.indiana.edu> by nate@psygate.psych.indiana.edu (Nathan Engle):\n\nWhat laws did they circumvent?  Being "frightening" isn't a crime.  Some people\nare afraid of young Black males.  That doesn't make the mere status of being a\nyoung Black male a crime.\n\nThe BATF itself admitted leading off by throwing handgrenades.  There is no\nevidence that they properly identified themselves as law enforcement \npersonnel.  Under those circumstances, other persons have been found to be\nacting within their legal rights to exercise self defense against unidentified\narmed intruders.\n\nThe charges are irrlevant anyway, since the BATF has absolutely no jurisdiction\nin such matters anyway.  Of course that hasn't stopped them from making other\nsuch spurious charges, such as the existence of mythical "meth labs".  Of\ncourse they whole "cult" thing indicates the level of contempt that they have\nfor the 1st amendment.\n\nThat armed resistance, at least initially, may well have been LEGAL.
No firearms were ever ever shot at the National Guard at Kent State.\n\nAt the time of the shooting, no rocks were being thrown at all.  The squad was\nslowly proceeding up a knoll, away from the body of students.  Some students\nwere taunting them, and photographs of the incident show at most one or two\nstudents who were following and taunting.\n\nThe series of photographs show the squad slowly proceeding up the hill, while\noccasionally their NCO, .45 in hand turned back to look at where they came from.\nAll at once, as if on command, the entire squad turned and fired their M1\nGarands, firing 30.06 rounds into the crowd (the NCO can be shown with this\n45 at full recoil).  At least two of the students shot had nothing to do with\nthe taunters... they were only passing through, and were not participants in\nthe confrontation.\n\nThere is some dispute whether the Guard was even legally on Campus... apparently\nthey had not been invited onto the state school by the president, who had\nconveniently flown the coop, so as not to be around.  The governor of Ohio,\nJames Rhodes, had just embarked on a senate campaign, and wanted it to be known\nthat he was tough on peaceniks, so had ordered the guard in.\n\nThe matter was quickly covered up.  Some years later, wounded survivors launched\na civil lawsuit against those responsible... a settlement was made, and under the\nterms, the plaintiffs could not discuss much, and guilty individuals were not\nidentified (in fact, those shooters in the squad have been identified).
A friend recorded CNN news during the gassing and incineration of\nthe BD's.  I went through it carefully today, and found something\nvery interesting.  A tank is pulling out of the house, and there\nis a fireball, maybe 24" across that lasts for about 1 second.\nExactly ten minutes and thirty nine seconds later, the smoke starts\nbillowing out of that area of the building.\nNow, I'm no govt. spokestwinkie, so it might really have been a\nweather balloon or something.  Perhaps someone would check it out\nand comment.
No crime here.\n\n\nNo crime here.\n\n\nNo crime here.\nAlso no substantiation of your claim that Koresh said this.  I for one have\nnever heard this mentioned before.  Where did you hear it?\n\n\nUp to which moment?  The one where you decided that anyone who claims to be\nGod no longer has the protection of the Constitution?\nWhat happened to the separation of church and state?\n\n\nI have yet to see any evidence of *this*, either.  From what I hear the\n*original* warrant (the reason for the Feb. raid) is still sealed.  What are\n"unsealed" seem to be warrants taken out after the initial raid.\n\n\nFunny, I haven't seen any of these "interviews."\nInteresting that when the social services agencies investigated Koresh on\nthese previous charges, they found absolutely no evidence of abuse.\n\n\nFunny, I don't remember hearing anything about childrens' statements,\neither.  Where did you say you heard all this?\n\nWhat *I* heard was that none of the children who left the compound early in\nthe seige exhibited any signs typical of abuse, physical or mental.  This\nfrom the newspaper and national TV news.\n\nDid you also hear that it's the job of the BATF and the FBI to lay siege to\nhomes where child abuse is suspected?  I thought you did.\n\n\n"Clearly?"  Please tell us what Koresh was doing that can be construed as\nother than "minding his own business" before the BATF raided the place.\n\n\nYour logic just amazes me.  I think your grandparents who died in\nAuschwitz would be turning over in their graves if they could hear how\ncavalierly you throw away people's protection of law because you think\nthey're "scary" and "not the sort of person you'd want your daughter to\ndate."  What sort of people do you suppose the Nazis thought your\ngrandparents were?  Probably not the sort they'd want their little\nfrauleins dating...\n\n\nAnd next I suppose you'll tell us exactly WHO these "well-trained killers"\nhave killed?\n\n\nBecause you said so, right?  Right.\n\n\nSo someone with a different background, say someone who didn't claim to be\nthe Messiah, in your book COULD shoot and kill Federal Law Enforcement\nofficials WOULD be a good citizen whose crusade enjoys our support?\n\n\nWorth the paper it's printed on.\n\nYou're amazing, simply amazing.

Funny, the medical examiner today stated that there was no\nevidence ONE WAY or ANOTHER that there were bullet wounds --\nnot a single autopsy has been performed, so all reports are\ndeemed speculative.  INCLUDING reports that there were NO\nbullet wounds.\n\n\nBefore long, I think all the kneejerk conspiracy theorists\nare going to start getting pretty pissed off at how easily\nthey mislead themselves.  Also, pretty disappointed at\nbeing ignored by the coutnry.
I'd have to agree with you there Joe.
Shooting those .44 cal. blanks, I suspect.  Them movie guys is dangerous.\n\n\nPractice with them, I hope.\n--
Just want to make a comment on this.  If you live in this country long\nenough, you should realize the media is no friend of the govt.  I am\nonly concerned about fact that the media like to jump to conclusion\nbefore the facts.  But I am sure they are good in digging dirt as\nwell; afterall, they like the controversial events, which of course\nmake news.

While dedicating the Holocaust Memorial Museum, President \nClinton remarked:\n\n	``The evil represented in this museum is incontestable, \nbut as we are its witness, so must we remain its adversary in the \nworld in which we live, so we must stop the fabricators of history \nand the bullies as well."\n\n	Clinton made this comment shortly after giving Janet Reno \nthe go-ahead to hastily construct a gas chamber and crematorium\nin Waco... on the fiftieth anniversary of the Warsaw uprising.\n\n	Say, wasn't Monday also the anniversary of Paul Revere's ride?\nIs that a clue?
Of course not. There's more than a little difference between formulating\nforeign policy and overseeing the ATF's handling of a scenario involving a\ngroup of religious fanatics. Why do people compare apples and oranges?
Unlikely.  Ammunition is not as dangerous when simply burned as it\nis when fired from a gun.  The brass case is not capable of holding\nthe pressure generated by burning powder, and will (unless supported\nby the walls of a gun barrel or chamber) simply split open.  While\nthis may cause small pieces of brass to fly around, it will not\npropel the bullet with any significant velocity.\n\nIn fact, it was not uncommon in years past to dispose of old loaded\ncartridges by burning them.  As long as you were not close enough\nto take a piece of flying brass in the eye, you were reasonably safe.\n\nThus, the detonation of loaded magazines or loose rounds might cause\nslight injury but would be unlikely to cause fatal bullet wounds.
Feel free to patronize me all you like; I need the tips. :-)\nSeriously, if you were insulted, I apologize.\n\n\nPeople are sucking up to the government when they decide that ONLY the\nthings the government says are plausible.  Especially if they refuse to\nconsider reasonable alternatives.\n\nHowever, from what I saw plastered all over the TV news last night, it's\nno longer necessary to be an "independent thinker" to depart from the\ngovernment's party line.  It looks like our "independent press" may \nactually be starting to be earn its clothes allowance.  This, to me, is\na good sign.  I hope it continues.\n\n\nIndependent thinkers question authority.  In a situation where only one\nset of facts are being presented, "coming to a conclusion" is not the \nhallmark of an independent thinker unless it's coupled with the ability\nto challenge those "facts" critically.  The scientific method consists\nof more than choosing the popular hypothesis; it's even more than choosing\nbetween two hypotheses that other people have proposed.\n--

Um, I sortof hesitate to bring this up, but owning even a single share\nentitles you to attend the annual shareholders meeting, and under most\ncorporate charters to introduce topics to be discussed.

[snip]....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n	Excellent point, Mark.  We should all remember that if Nixon\n	hadn't tried to cover up the misguided actions of some of his\n	subordinates in the Watergate burglary, the scandal would\n	never have brought down his presidency.  So far, Klinton seems\n	to be stonewalling this the same way Tricky Dick did.  His whole\n	case seems to be "we didn't do anything wrong".  However, if\n	in the course of the investigation it turns out that the\n	gov't DID do something wrong, and he tried to cover it up,\n	then that's an impeachable crime, I believe...  \n\n	Perhaps he is inadvertently cooking up his own scandal...

The Waco Quiz\n\nWhat would you do in the following hypothetical situations?\n\nYou have committed no crime.  The BATF conducts a "no-knock" raid.\na) Hands in air. Say "Do you have a warrant?" Think of hefty suit settlement.\nb) Say "You have 1 second to identify yourself as a cop or I shoot."\nc) Shoot.  Heck, at least in federal prison you might get to have sex.\n\nYou have killed federal agents. They blast strange music at you.\na) Come out with hands up. "I wish to turn state's evidence." Hope deal's good.\nb) Wait, figuring other federal agents will get bored and go on vacation.\nc) Wait. If they come after you there will be a chance to kill MORE g-men.\n\nThe FBI has you surrounded, asks you to come out immediately.\na) Come out, figuring long prison term is chance to catch up on some writing.\nb) Stall. You just can't concentrate when you're on trial for some reason.\nc) Decide to write novel-length prophecy now while ideas are fresh in mind.\n\nFBI calls and says they will use tear gas if you don't come out.\na) Come out with hands up. Your radical bro-in-law hated getting gassed at UC.\nb) Get out your gas mask. Really, these feds will have to give up eventually.\nc) Shoot at vehicles delivering tear gas. It's rude to break down a man's door!\n\nFBI calls and says they will use tanks to break down your walls.\na) Come out with your hands up. Flimsy cardboard construction won't last long.\nb) With presence of mind, move flammable devices away from tinder-dry haybales.\nc) Spread some kerosene around and hit a match.

With one exception, that's a pretty good description of many of the\nBaptists I know.  The exception is that they know the difference\nbetween an M-16 and an AR-15.  Heck - they even know that "it looks\nlike Richard Petty's stock car" doesn't mean "it's a racing stock\ncar".  They may be uncouth, but they've figured out that appearance\nisn't function.\n\n-andy
Just from experience, seeing a couple of houses burn down, one doesn't\nneed any accelerant to get a lot of black soot.  There's plenty of\nstuff in a house that will burn 'dirty'.  Even the asphalt shingles\nwould make a really sooty smoke.
Yes, the local sheriff stated that anytime he wanted to talk to Koresh, all\nhe had to do was call him and Koresh would come down.\n\n\n\nFull agree with you here.  I think its ridiculous that he did not even talk\nto Janet Reno until sometime Tuesday, however, he did talk with Wendell\nHubbel(?).  So who really is the Attorney General????\n\n\nHopefully the investigation will answer some of these bizarre questions.
tha\n\nAny death is serious.  Wanna discuss match control?  Firearms related  \nunintentional deaths among children ages 14 and under are the fault of one or  \nmore negligent persons, not the gun.\n\n\nProviding false hope, then, is the intent?\n\n\n200% increase in California schools, eh?  Gun control is working fine, there!\nSo your religion is different.  Does that make it his wrong?  Even assuming  \nKoresh actually made that decision, and the verdict is still out on that.\n\n \n\nJim\n--\njmd@handheld.com
But this is all gun control laws end up doing.  Politicians can never\nmanage to get a handle on those who obtain arms illegally, so all their\nlaws can ever do is further restrict people who obtain them legally.\n\nKaren McNutt, a local attorney, states that there are about two MILLION\nlicensed gun owners in Massachusetts.  In the past year, the number of\nlicensed gun owners involved in gun crimes was something like SIX.\nYet, there were a large number of gun crimes in the state last year.\n\nDoes passing laws that will further restricting only those people ALREADY\nobeying laws pay any dividents?\n\n\nSo far, I've seen them treated with the least respect by legislators.\n\n\nSee, this is what I call the "argument from religion:" "I believe."  Don't\nbelieve -- it's not NECESSARY to take this on faith.  Go look at the history\nof countries that passed gun restrictions.  Pay particular attention to\nwhether or not violent crime was HIGHER before the restrictions and LOWER\nafter.  (Don't look at "violent gun crimes," that's begging the question.)\nYou may be very surprised.\n\n\nYou have this absolutely backwards.  If crime stopped in the presence of\nstrict gun control, there is NO WAY I would consider lifting any of it.\nHowever, if gun control made absolutely NO IMPROVEMENT in the violent \ncrime rate, THAT'S when I would have it lifted.  Think about it.\n\nSo far, none of the stats show any improvement...\n\n\nDo you really think driver's tests are any indication of your propensity\nfor having accidents?  \n\nI've never known anybody stupid enough to take a driving test while \ndrunk; after having been up all night; with two fighting kids in the \nback seat; with a hot cup of coffee on their lap; or while putting on \nmakeup, reading the newspaper, or talking on their cellular phone.  \nBut that's what they're doing when they have those accidents.\n\n\nHow can anything that has no positive effect at all ever be "necessary?"\n\n\nAnd it didn't help, any of it.\n\n\nI'm sorry, I don't remember any story where Winnie the Pooh was\noffered weapons.\n--
It was filmed the day of the first assault.  The BDs clearly allowed the\nBATF agents who were shot and wounded to leave the compound.  The\nlesson, I suppose is that you should keep shooting untill ALL the pigs\nare dead and then get the fuck outa dodge. Never give a pig an even\nbreak.
[Joe, why don't you put your username on your account?]\n\n\n\nOr claims to have discovered so...  It would hardly be the first time\nthey raided someone based on incorrect evidence.\n\n\nIt was a "no-knock", according to the Associated Press report.\nHere's something I found in my collection:\n\n    Excerpts from an article in the Knoxville News-Sentinel Final\n    Edition Monday, March 1, 1993 (the byline is associated press):\n\n    WACO, Texas - Fierce gun battles erupted Sunday as more than 100\n    law officers tried to arrest the leader of a heavily armed\n    religious cult.  At least four federal agents and two cult members\n    were reported killed.  [...]\n\n    The gun battles began when federal agents hidden in livestock\n    trailers stormed the sect's head-quarters Sunday morning,\n             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n    witnesses said.  The agents had warrants to search for guns and\n    explosives and to arrest Howell, said Les Stanford of the ATF in\n    Washington.  [...]\n\n    Witnesses said the law officers stormed the compound's main home,\n    throwing concussion grenades and screaming "Come out," while three\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n    National Guard helicopters approached.  For a moment, there was no\n    response.  Then the shooting began. \n\nI think "storming the sect's head-quaters" and "throwing concussion\ngrenades" qualifies as a no-knock (or perhaps an illegal assault).\n\n                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nProbably not.  But then again, neither are you.\n\n                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nAnd just what is "his background"?  What prior crimes had he been\nCONVICTED of?\n\n  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nSorry, BATF are "Federal TAX Enforcement officials".  They're not\npolice, nor do they have police powers.\n\n--\nCharles Scripter   *   cescript@phy.mtu.edu\nDept of Physics, Michigan Tech, Houghton, MI 49931
What is "doing it right the first time"?  Murdered them all?  Used tanks? \nMaybe they should have had enough evidence to indict.  From the list presented\nto date, I haven't seen ANYTHING illegal.  They claim that the BD's bought\ncomponents to convert their weapons to Class III devices, but no evidence that\nthey had done so.  In fact, with a Class III FFL living with them, this may\nhave been legal (given recent court rulings).\n\nWhat you really meant to say was that the ATF should have done the right and\nlwaful thing.  Or did you just want the BD's dead?
I agree, I saw no reason they could not have had "close in" pool\ncameras manned by volunteers and protected by sandbags or whatever.\n\n[Points made by Dick DeGueran, Koresh's lawyer]\n\nOkay, their word against the FBI's at this point.  See ya in court!\n\n\nDear, dear. They could have COME OUT.\n\n\nOkay, they were living in a fire hazard. That they built.\n\n\nNo crime, irrelevant either way.\n\n\nAh yes, that is exactly what I would do.  Hold Bible study. Take a nap.\nAlways a wise course of action when you're being gassed.\n\n\nI don't believe there was a "suicide pact".  I believe that Koresh\nwanted a fiery conflagration ... which he may not have told his followers.\nIn fact, this hypothesis is CONFIRMED by the survivors' stories.\n\n\nYes, that's right.  And once the whole compound was demolished, where\ndid they expect to go?\n\n\nThe building is being RAMMED and they are going UPSTAIRS?  That's almost\nas bad as running into a fire.\n\n\nHm, an interesting notion.  We'll see.\n\n\nMore Bible study, no doubt.  Hey, it's a *priority*.\n\n\nActually, on Friday he stated that there was no evidence either way and\nhe could not flatly contradict the federal agents' claims.  We'll know\nmore later.  In any event, it's irrelevant.\n\n\nFor six hours they were trapped?  The building was not "destroyed" \nimmediately.  They COULD HAVE LEFT AT ANY TIME.\n\n\nSix hours to move it away.  Or COME OUT.\n\n\nIrrelevant, anyway.  PR one way or the other, but no crime or innocence\nindicated.\n\n\nNo word on whether they were being fired back at, which is an operative\nquestion here.\n\n\nRight.  For six hours you know that a tank could come thru the wall at \nany point, and you leave a COLEMAN LANTERN BURNING.  Near BALES OF HAY.\n\n\nIt's ultimately irrelevant who "lit" the fire.  They had ample opportunity\nto LEAVE.\n\n\nMost charismatic leaders are extremely intelligent, actually.  They tend\nto be excellent actors and skilled manipulators.  (Ex.: Ted Bundy.)\n\n\nMedical assistance was jsut a phone call away.  Gee, all he had to do\nwas COME OUT.\n\n\nNot relevant to any crimes.\n\n\nWhile he was there.  Anyway, outsiders RARELY see abuse.  It's a secretive\nthing.  All we have to go on are the court documents in the Jewell case\nand the mistrial in California.\n\n\nEXACTLY.  By their OWN CHOICE.\n\n\nLooks like there will be several investigations, starting with Congressional\ncommittee hearings next week....\n\n\nI have NEVER judged them by their religion, but by their ACTIONS.\n\nIf they had lived a quiet, religious life as they claimed, there would\nhave been no raid, no siege, and no deaths.  Instead, they chose courses\nof action at every turn that were at the very least STUPID, if not\nIRRATIONAL.  The first was to stockpile weapons.  The second was to\nshoot federal agents.  The third was to stay inside.\n\nJust as we don't blame a cop who shoots a kid who had pointed a toy\nweapon at him, I don't think the FBI deserves blame in this case.
[...]\n\nThe President is not competent to plan or judge the planning of such a\nraid, nor does he need to be.  His job is to set basic policies and\nmanage the people under him.  If Clinton instructed Reno to preserve\nlives, and if she confirmed that the plan for the raid was a safe as\ncould be, then he did his job.  The President should not involve\nhimself in the minor details of these kinds of operations.  This sort\nof micromanagement only leads to disaster, as was demonstrated so well\nin Vietnam.\n\nBut the raid went bad:  Over 80 civilians have been killed in a\ncontrontation with U.S. authorities.\n\nNOW Clinton enters the picture in a big way.  Will Clinton start an\ninvestigation?  Or will he try to squash any attempt to investigate?\nIs he a responsible leader?  Or is he only interested in protecting\nthe image of his administration?\n\nWe'll all find out as this unfolds.\n--
I wrote a letter the other day to Empower America - the organization\nwhich claims to be championing conservative issues, esp. in the wake \nof the Republican defeat last fall. \n\nSome might consider them just a an organization to create a network of \nsupport among conservatives for some individuals in prep. for '96 run.\n\nYou'd be close to the truth.\n\nTheir two leading spokesmen are Bill Bennett, former 'Drug Czar' who heartily\nsupported Bush's semi-auto import ban, and wondered if it went far enough - \nwho helped put the big lie about 'sporting use' into the public's eye - and\nJack Kemp - who recently came out in support of semi-auto bans. \n\nThese are conservatives ? \n\nAnyway I thought it interesting that when I ran Word Perfect's spell check\nagainst my letter - it came up with the following corrections for 'Bennett' :\n\n1. Banned\n2.

Imagine, you have been under seige for almost two months by an enemy which you\nbelieve wants to kill you.  Suddenly, they pump tear gas into your building and\npunch holes in it with tanks.  Then a fire breaks out.  Do you run outside to\nbe slaughtered, or stay and face your fate.\n\nCheck Ethiopia vs. Italy in WWII for some answers to that question.
I seem to recall graphic news file of buddhist monks setting themselves on fire\nin the streets of Saigon. Yes, its a horrible way to go, but apparently not\nso horrible that someone with enough religious conviction might not be able to \ncarry it through. And, since they've discovered bullet wounds in a couple of \nthe bodies from the compound, there is the possiblity that those with the will power to self immolate also had the will power to take out the ones who had\nless constitutional fortitude. Then again, maybe the FBI ran in while the fire\nwas raging, executed those two, and ran out again.

As David Veal points out, this sort of "promotion" would be used\nagainst gun owners by the mass media.\n\nHowever, here is my proposal: offer gun safety classes in your area,\nfree, as a community service.  Such a class would normally cost $40\nor $50, so offering it free is a good promotion.\n\nOur Gun Club has organized several of these (we just finished\nteaching another one last night, in fact) and they have been\nvery well received.  We get a lot of people who are novices\ninterested in guns.  We even get a few who are anti-gun, but\nfeel they should know something about "gun safety" since members\nof their family keep guns at home.\n\nTeaching such a course gives us many desirable benefits:\n\n(1) We have the chance to teach gun safety rules; this increases\n    firearm awareness and may help to reduce gun accident stats.\n\n(2) A "gun safety" class is Politically Correct, and likely to\n    be viewed positively by the public and the media.\n\n(3) Most of the students are 'normal people' (not gun enthusiasts)\n    and this kind of class gives us the chance to give them a\n    gentle introduction to firearms.\n\n(4) Some of the students are enthusiastic, and will purchase a gun\n    and become more involved in shooting or personal defense.\n\n(5) It improves the public perception of our club and gun owners\n    in general.  Our students see that we are all reasonable,\n    non-aggressive, soft-spoken people, which helps to mitigate\n    the standard image of a hardcore gun owner.  Even anti-gun\n    students sometimes tell us they have "something new to think\n    about" with regards to personal gun ownership.\n\n(6) Sharing our experience with others is a lot of fun.\n\nOur course is the standard NRA-certified "Home Firearm Safety"\nclass, and our students pay only $5 for materials.  We also\nteach the NRA's "Personal Protection" class, although the cost\nis higher for that one since we have to purchase range time.\n\nI think firearms safety classes are an excellent response to\ngun buy-backs.
:\n\nI'm responding at the risk of misreading your response, but I do have to tell \nmy fellow conservatives to give it up, attacking Reno/Clinton/ATF/FBI.\n\nThey may have botched an operation, but they didn't kill anybody who never shot\nat them first.  David Koresh was a frigging lunatic.  His followers had the \ncombined I.Q of a Geraldo audience.  The kids probably would have been those\nfucked up social rejects who go to Freshman dances in high school, never to be\nseen again (except maybe in the band) until prom, when they show up like \nanimals boarding the ark.  Then it's bowling till 3 in the morning..... \n(WHY....WHY?? did it happen to me??!!)\n\nAnyway, the point is Janet Reno/Bill Clinton were only following the advice of \ntrained, law enforcement officials who were experts in their fields.  I'd \nrather have our leaders do that then micro-manage every crisis that comes \nalong.  Then you'd really see trouble no matter what party or ideology the \nPresident and her (er.. I mean his) Attorney General is.\n-- \nRyan C. Scharfy
This was posted by Lyn Bates to the firearms-politics mailing list:\n\nI recently learned that Don Kates was going to be in Boston to give a talk\nat the Harbard Law School about the Waco situation.  (Of course, this was\nall set up after the incident started but long before its unhappy\nconclusion.)  So, yesterday I went to hear him.  What follows is a rough\nsummary of what I think I heard him say, which should not be taken as\nexactly what he actually said...\n\nKates started by saying that since he didn't know any more about the fire\nthan the audience did (it had just happened the day before), he would not\ndiscuss that, but would concentrate on the original raid.\n\nKoresh definitely was not playing with a full deck.  But so what?  This\nisn't the first time that the leader of a new, small religious group has\nbeen ridiculed by the public.  Extreme religious views nearly always fuel\nhatred and mistrust.  The first amendment applies, maybe especially, to\npeople like Koresh.\n\nLengthy digression into the history of police organizations in the US.\nThere were none until about 1830, when they began in metropolitan areas.\nPolice originally were not armed; if they found a crime in progress, they\ncalled local armed citizens to help.  Many began to carry arms for\nprotection despite regulations against them, eventually the laws were\nchanged to allow them to carry guns.  The original intent was to have many\nsmall police departments, jealous of one another and competitive, but not\nlarge enough to be a threat to liberty, hence the plethora of\norganizations ranging from postal inspectors to the coast guard.  When the\nFBI was started, agents did not have the authority oto carry guns (they\nwere to be, after all, a bureau of investigation, not a police force).\n"All police agencies will be misused by anyone in power to maintain that\npower."\n\nThe BATF started as a tax collection agency, whose primary job was to raid\nillegal stills.  When the price of sugar went up so high that moonshiners\nno longer found their trade no longer profitable, many illegal stills\ndisappeared, and the BATF needed something else to do to justify its\nexistence, so it turned to activities like phony raids on gun stores.\nAround the time when the BATF's annual budget is under review, the media\nis alerted by the BATF to come to such-and-such a place, where at a\npre-arranged time, a bunch of cars full of BATF agents roar up to the door\nand the media get great pictures of the agents entering the premises of a\ngun dealer suspected of not keeping books properly.  The media isn't\ninvited in for the boring hours of agents leafing through paperwork, but\nif any irregularities are found, the media gets to cover the agents\nremoving armfuls of guns from the premises, and the luckless FFL in\nchains.\n\nThe Waco incident happened a few weeks before BATF's budget was up for\nreview.\n\nKates' opinion is that it was a staged publicity stunt that went bad, and\nthat the BATF never thought for a moment that they would actually be shot\nat, or they would have planned the raid differently (not sending 100\nagents over open ground with no cover, for example), and would have had\nsome medical personnel on hand.\n\nHe confirmed that some years ago there was a warrant for Koresh's arrest\nin connection with a murder charge, and the local sheriff called him on\nthe phone and explained about it.  Koresh sais, ok, come pick me up, and\nthe sheriff did, temporarily confiscating all the guns so that they could\nbe tested.  Koresh was later cleared, release, and presumably got his guns\nback.  At least at that time, he was rational enough to be approached\nrationally, and behaved in a reasonable manner.\n\nThe BATF didn't take into account that, unlike most of the FFL's they\naudit, Koresh was actually paranoid, and fostered paranoia in his\nfollowers.  Thus the pubicity stunt looked like a real attack to them, and\nthey reacted accordingly.\n\nWith respect to the original warrant, it had not been unsealed when Kates\nwas giving his talk, so he could not comment on it, except to mention that\nthe BATF has been known to not double-check the veractiy of their\ninformants, if they can manage to get a judge to issue a warrant.  He had\nmore to say about the way the warrant was served, which may have been\ncompletely illegal.  Apparently the proper way to serve a warrant is to\nknock on the door and announce that you're an officer with a warrant for\nthus-and-so; if they don't open the door and the evidence is flushable,\nthen it is ok to break in the door.  But since it is hard to flush guns\ndown the toilet, there may have been no justification for the BATF\nbreaking in the way they did.  If the constitutional rights of the\nDavidians were violated by an invalid warrant, or by an improperly served\nwarrant, then the Davidians may have been justified in their actons.  A\nclose look at one of the original films shows that one BATF agent _may_\nhave shot himself by accident when entering the building; if so, this was\nthe first shot fired!\n\nThe role of the media could have been a whole lot worse.  After an initial\nposition on the side of the BATF, the media began to come around to the\nview that this might be a situation in which legally armed citizens held\noff a bad, possibly illegal attack.  A real cynic might say that the FBI\nwent in when they did because it was clear that public opinion was\nbeginning to change sides, and the FBI wanted to act before they lost the\npublic's sympathy.\n\nShould the BATF be abolished?  No.  Police agencies _should_ be numerous,\ndiverse, inefficient, decentralized, etc.  Better a few inept accidents\nlike this, than a move toward a single, large, well-organized,\nwell-trained, powerful, domestic police force, which would eventually have\neven more tragic results.\n\n   - Lyn Bates\n     (bates@bbn.com)\n\nPS Don Kates will be giving a shorter version of this talk at Boston\nCollege Law School next Tuesday, April 27.  I don't know the exact time or\nplace, but presumably a phone call to the BC law school could elicit that\ninformation.
Hey dude you are making me paranoid! What an argument!!!\n\n\n\nNo, Frank Crary's arguments are based on the assumption that most people\nare sane, normal people. tpg disproves this of gun owners. USEnet as a whole\ndisproves it of humanity as a whole.\n\nWe now have proof positive that guns don't make you safer. Buy a lot of\nguns and you either get shot in the no knock raid or get the FBI to burn\ndown your house. See even in the paranoid mindset of tpg there are good reasons\nto support gun control.\n\n\nCuddles 'n kisses
Look, folks, I don't know what happened in Waco.  I do not claim the BDs are  \nangels, I never did.  Koresh may very well be the devil incarnate.  I just  \ndon't know.  But I do know that I must question any single source of  \ninformation, such as we have here.  And I must question even harder given that  \nit is single source at the insistance of that very government.  What ever else  \nhappened at WACO, that is perhaps the biggest evil done.  And even more so in  \nlight of the discrepencies turning up between the federal officials and the  \nstate officials.\n\nBut what I really don't understand is the hoards of devoted government  \nworshipers who believe the government could not possibly do any wrong.  They  \nare fanatic to the point of making things up, such as Brent's microwave oven  \ndisclaim of the BD's using fire for food heating.  \n\nI am hard pressed to see any real difference between the claimed power Koresh  \nheld over the BDs, and the demonstrated power the government holds over those  \nrapid apologists.\n\n\nJim\n--\njmd@handheld.com
And you shouldn't, as the matches kill more kids.  So why are you bleating\nabout guns?\n\n\nIt may be tired, but it is true.\n\n\nNo, that's not right either.  People who have both easy access and the\ndesire to kill, kill people.  Considering that people who have the\ndesire to kill turn that into easy access ....  (Haven't you folks\nlearned anything from either Prohibition or the war on drugs?)\n\nIf you don't affect the desire, you're wasting your time, not to\nmention the other costs incurred.\n\n\nGood for them.  I note that the TM folks make the same argument.  If\nyou'll pay their expesnses ($21 million for a reasonable size city),\nthey promise to meditate away all crime, disease, etc.  At least\nthey're not promising to jail me if I don't go along with their little\nplan - they're going to just sit in a room and fly, leaving me alone.\n\n\nAh, but we have evaluated gun control using before-after and it\ndoesn't work to reduce crime.  What is the point?  We can't claim that\nit is symbolic, as people do get jailed.\n\n\nNo, they're essentially saying "we hope this will keep you from\nnoticing that we're not doing anything useful".  Pissing away\nresources isn't "caring".\n\n\nNope, you'll merely be ignored, as Wright, Rossi, and Daly were after\nfinishing "Under the Gun".  They were supposed to prove that gun\ncontrol worked, so ....\n\n\nSo, who gassed them?  Given their previous experience with thugs who\nthrew grenades before yelling "we're from the govt and we're here to\nhelp you", would a rational person think that the feds had their best\ninterests at heart?  Would you "know" that the gas was "non-lethal"?\n\n-andy
From what I saw of the videotape, there was an explosion which looked\nmore like one due to propane rather than (official version)\nammunition.\n\n\nIf only we could be certain that the hard evidence will be released.
Everyone is complaining about the debacle in Waco. It is hard to \nunderstand all this angst. What happend there is nothing less than\nwhat we wanted to happen. Why all the sour grapes ?\n\nBATF was looking for a propaganda event to counteract their impending\nbudget cuts ... the attendance of the press at the initial big\ncommando raid is proof. It would have been ever so easier to grab\nKoresh and his central followers as they shopped in Waco. Alas, no\npropaganda value there. \n\nThe FBI screwed-up big time, all the time. They should have never allowed\nthe situation to drag out like that. A quick second assault, before the\nBDs could decide on a strategy, would have been the better plan. \n\nThe BDs themselves were the biggest screw-ups though. They imagined\nthat US law and US law-enforcement had no jurisdiction within their\nlittle 'country'. WRONG ! They had no right whatsoever to fire on\nthe BATF, and if they mistook their identity initially, they should\nhave surrendered at once when they did realize who they were. If the\nBDs had a problem with the warrants, they take it to court, just like\nthe rest of us. If they wanted full-auto weapons, they could have\nobtained the proper permits, just like the rest of us would need to\ndo. What they may NOT do is decide for themselves what US law applies\nto themselves and which does not. They get their chance like the rest\nof us - at the voting booth. \n\nIf the BATF and FBI have become latter-day Gestapo, then they have\nbecome that way because WE have desired them to be so. We get to\nvote on laws, and on the lawmakers. By our choices over the years,\nwe have approved the creation and form of the BATF and FBI. When\nthe FBI was out chasing 'pinkos', the general public didn't seem\nto mind a bit of extra-constitutional activity. When the BATF is\nraiding militant black organizations, we don't mind the heavy hand.\nWhen the FBI is dicking around with the rights of potheads, the\npublic doesn't mind. Suddenly, when we see a bit of ourselves in\nthe current 'enemy' choosen by these agencies, we get all bent out\nof shape. SUPRISE ! You reap what you sow.\n\nWaco was an encapsulation of the All-American experience - religious\nfanaticism, militaristic thinking and overwhelming violence. Don't\nblame it on 'them', the FBI and BATF. They were just acting within\nthe parameters we have set over the years. We made 'them'. We ARE 'them'.

there is NO evidence of effect of gun buyback programs but hopefully if\nthere is any effect it may prevent injuries or deaths in one of these types\nof common incidents.\n \n Firearms are the fifth-leading cause of unintentional deaths among children\nages 14 and under.  I don't understand how the ratio to other accidental\ndeaths is important.  So guns don't kill as many children as car accidents.\nWhat is the difference in severity between 1,000 deaths and 10,000 deaths?\nI am not trying to use accidental gun-related deaths among children as a\njustification for gun control.  Who needs to be convinced that accidental\ngun deaths of children is a serious problem?  I assumed that any humane\nperson would be concerned when any 10 year old got hold of their parents\ngun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends.\n \n My point was, gun buyback programs which are almost always run by police\ndepartments MIGHT (I stress might) do a LITTLE (I stress little) good by\ngiving people the impression that the police are attempting to respond\nto interpersonal gun violence in a unique way.  Overall, I thought that I\nhad made it clear that I did not think that gun buyback programs were\nuseful.\n \n \n Well Joe, I suggest that you talk to the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence\nor the Centers for Disease Control.  If YOU look carefully you will see\nthat YOU greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths.\nThe CPHV reports that 135,000 youth bring GUNS to school DAILY and that\n400,000 bring GUNS to school at least once a year.  The CDC estimates\nthat 1 out 0f 25 high school students carried a gun to school at least once\nin 1990.  The CDC also says that 1.2 million elementary-aged, latch-key\nchildren (kids who come home from school to an empty house), have access\nto guns in their home.  California schools reported a 200% increase in\nstudent gun confiscations between 1986 and 1990, and a 40% increase between\n1988 and 1990.  Florida reported a 61% percent increase in gun incidents in\nschools between 1986/87 amd 1987/88.  These are the "statistics".\n \n \n \n Okay, maybe I worded it wrong...DAD.  I meant that to put children in a\nsituation (fortified compound) where harm could come to them is not the\nact of a Messiah in my opinion.  I'm not saying that Koresh had control over\nthese children directly, but I would hope that whatever Messiah there is\nwould not let innocent children die.\nIf as he claimed he was the Messiah and people followed him as such, why\ndid he not tell their parents to free the children instead of letting them\nburn alive?  Thanks for the reality check Joe, its been real.
Did I say that a child who unintentionally shoots someone is not negligent?\n NO.  I hate to repeat myself Jim, but like I told Joe, I was not attempting\nin any way to justify gun control.  You're right, any death is serious.\nTHAT was my point to Joe who said that "anti-gunners" try to convinve\nthe country that accidental gun deaths related to children are a serious\nproblem.  I guess I assumed everyone thought that it was a problem.\nNo, I don't want to discuss match control.  I don't equate a book of matches\nto a loaded 9 millimeter either.  Don't confuse the issue.  And please don't\nsay that tired old NRA line "Guns don't kill people, people kill people".\nSure, people can kill people without guns.  But easy access to guns makes it\na lot more convenient.  "Guns don't kill people, People with easy access to\nguns kill people".\n \n    Jim, I'm just saying how it is.  I'm not saying if that is a good thing\nor not. From the police who I have talked with who run some of these gun\nbuyback programs, I get the impression that they really think they are\nhaving an impact on the community.  When I ask them if they have an evaluatory\ncomponent to the program, they say "well no..."  So, in answer to your\nquestion, no, false hope is not the intent.  I think the intent is to\nshow folks that police are attempting to do something to curb interpersonal\ngun violence whether its effective or not.  Look, if you can't measure\nthe impact of these programs using some sort of pre-test and post-test\nevaluation, what is the point?  It must be symbolic in nature.  The police are\nessentially saying "look, if you have a gun lying around and you don't\nwant it, we'll give you $50 for it...because we care about the community".\nIf you, I and Joe could think of a way to measure the effectiveness or\nineffectiveness of these programs we could become rich and famous.

Hell, I can think of a person right now that probably\nhas that much for ONE INDIVIDUAL, mostly machineguns!!!  Sure, he is\nan avid collector, but unless a new law has been passed, it is NOT illegal,\nnor an indication of anything illegal, to have a lot of guns.  Also note\nthat the warrant had NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT MACHINE GUNS.  So, what\nis the justification of this cowboy raid, other than a romp gone bad\nfor some anti-gun media hype, to support Clinton's push for disarming\nthe unconnected citizen of any and all effective defensive weapons?\nThis administration has only one thing in mind.  CONTROL.  PEOPLE CONTROL.\nWhether it is gun control, Clinton Cripple Chip, National smart ID cards,\nit all boils down to PEOPLE CONTROL.  Can you say 1984, only 10 years late?\nI knew you could...  :-)\n\n<laws, they would have been released as they had been before.  If this\n<had happened and it turned out that the BATF had used too much force,\n<then the BDs would have grounds for a law suit and for federal charges\n<of civil rights violations (Sounds a lot like LA, huh?  Don't take that\n<wrong, I'm not commenting one way or the other about the Rodney King\n<case).  But that's not what they wanted.  They got tipped off that the\n<BATF was on the way in, and rather than adopting a non-violent,\n<non-threatening posture to greet the BATF, they decided to fight.\n\nAnd BATF knew the BDs were expecting them (via 60 minutes report).  But\nthey decided they were so big, so bad, they would have a cakewalk at\nthe BDs expense, for a nice media show anyway.  But it all turned to\nshit, and the FBI taking over to manage things, we see it all turned to\nshit, too.  Clinton says 'I am taking full responsibility'...  BAH.\nResponsibility means to take the repercussions if it goes wrong.  Bet\nyou NOBODY pays any serious repercussions.  'Responsibility' only has\nmeaning as media PR, or as a means to corner the average Joe Schmoe.\nFigure it out... Clinton, Reno, the FBI and BATF, will all be IMMUNE.\nCan you say WHITEWASH?\n\n<I've said enough of this issue.  I'm probably not going to convince any\n<of you folks and you're certainly not going to convince me.  I've got\n<work to do.\n<\n<				++Don\n\nBe VERY afraid of our government.

Much of the dispute about the origin of the fire that destroyed the\nBD compound could be settled by examining the propane tank supposedly\ncrushed by one of the army tanks when they breached the walls of the\ncompound. If the the propane tank is flattened and has tread marks on it,\nthen the BD's version of the cause of the fire would seem to be\nverified.\n\n-- \nDave Feustel N9MYI <feustel@netcom.com>

I understand fire trucks had been at the site for several weeks but were\nsent home three or four days before the assault.  Can anyone confirm this?
And you'd be wrong about that too.\n\nNote that Texas isn't unique in this "more with-gun deaths than\nwith-car deaths", but some of the other states where it happens have\nextremely strict gun laws.  Oops - so much for the "meaning".\n\nIt isn't clear that the comparision means anything anyway as car\naccidents are unintentional while gun deaths aren't, but if we're\ngoing to make it, let's at least be honest.\n\n\nGive it up for what?  Gun control doesn't have any benefits, so\nit fails by this standard.\n\n\nNote that insurance gives me something in return - gun control doesn't.\n\n\nThat's half the question - the rest is "and what do you get for your\nsacrifice".  If the answer to the second question is "nothing", as it\nis for gun control, then we don't have to ask the first question\nbecause getting nothing means that no sacrifice is justified.\n\n-andy
...\n\nIf we are indeed talking about CS, then this is not quite accurate. CS is\n"just" tear gas--albeit the worst kind. It isn't a nausea gas, and doesn't\nhave direct CNS effects. However, it's quite bad--much worse than CN gas. I\nwas briefly exposed to it once (during an engagement in Berkeley circa 1968\n8^) and it's not the kind of thing you forget. It seems to be\nmoisture-activated--it not only made my eyes sting and water, but attacked\nmy breathing passages and lungs. Breathing was painful, and my entire face\nfelt as if it was on fire. These effects persisted for hours after\nexposure, and I was coughing for days afterwards.  If I was exposed to a\ndense concentration of this stuff in a closed space for several hours, I\ndoubt whether I could find the exit. Indeed, I can't imagine living through\nit.

Well, the question of why fire equipment took so long to reach the \ncompound has been answered. ABC aired a report including the 911 tapes \nfrom Monday. The FBI called 911 within 4 minutes of the fire's breakout. \nUnfortunately, dispatch of vehicles outside the Waco city limits \nrequired approval of a deputy chief, who was not available (literally \nout to lunch?); the 911 operator desperately called around to local \ncommunity volunteer fire departments to get something out there. By \nthe time trucks arrived 27 minutes later, the whole complex was aflame \nand it was clearly too little, too late; there were just two pumpers \nand no water supply. The FBI made another call requesting a tank truck, \nbut the Waco department apparently depended on hydrants and did not \nhave one. Though clearly unwilling to risk firemen's lives in the \nline of fire, it seems they might have done so had there been sufficient \nequipment and water to make a difference.\n\nThey even aired a tape of a woman who called Waco 911 from Georgia \nasking if anything was being done. Civic-minded, but probably \nirresponsible; if everyone watching television did that, no local \ncalls could get through.\n\nABC also aired the comments of an independent fire investigator who \nviewed tapes from more than one side of the compound (not just the \nstandard "pool shot"), and agreed that the fire a) must have been \nstarted in at least 3 places, and b) must have had an accelerant \nto spread so fast.\n\nNeither of these is conclusive proof that the Koresh crowd offed \nthemselves more than the FBI offed them, but it's a heck of a lot \nstronger proof than some of the "theories" floating around the net.\n\nScore 2 FBI, 0 Branch Davidians. Or is that -89 Branch Davidians?
In other words, "Nice camera you got dere.  It would be a shame if somet'in\nwuz ta happen to it..."\n\n\n\n\nGood.  Keep thinking critically.\n\n\nWhat if the secrecy is actually LESS damaging than the alternative?\n\n\n\nMake your own bite-size pieces.  We'll wait.\n--
So far, the medical examiner (according to the news) has found NO EVIDENCE\nof gunshot wounds in bodies so far examined.  If this continues to be\nthe case, it will sort of shoot holes (pun intended) in the FBI story,\nwouldn't it?  And cartridges going off outside a firearm do not launch\na bullet like they do when fired from a gun.  The bullet hardly moves,\nit is the brass casing that goes flying, and then with less than lethal\nforce.  It will hurt, yes, but not KILL you - I doubt if it wil penetrate\na coat, for example.\n\nHow about an INDEPENDENT investigation, with full subpoena powers, and\npowers to prosecute on felony charges, to investigate for any possible\nillegal/criminal activity on the part of both the BATF and FBI?  I\ncannot see any reason why not - to use the phrase they like to use\nso often, "if they have nothing to hide..." they should welcome it,\nand vigorously support it.  Note that an internal investigation by the\nDept of Justice is NOT an independent investigation...
Or perhaps David Koresh didn't listen too well??  Just because mistakes\nwere made does not mean the President *lied*.
On the news from radio station KANU (Lawrence, KS) about 6:15 this Monday\nmorning, I heard someone with a nasal-sounding voice (supposedly the Waco\ncoroner?) claim that he had found TWO persons killed with a single shot\nto the forehead.\n--Myron.
OK... quick scenario... you're at home, not bothering anybody... next thing you\nknow, somebody comes crashing in the upstairs window and you hear an explosion.\nYou see that this individual has a submachinegun, and that more similarly armed\nindividuals are rushing your front door.  Will you a) defend yourself and family\nagainst this attack b) realize "oh, only the BATF would enter like that, so I \nbetter surrender" or c) roll over and let whoever is attacking your home do\nwhat they would like?  You have chosen a), and discover that the people you \ndefended yourself against are federal agents, who now are camped outside your\ndoor waiting for you to surrender.  You have learned that they intend to \ncharge you with murder, and are further defaming your name, while claiming that\nyou can safely surrender at any time.  Then they start using psychological \nwarfare techniques against you, while still claiming that you can safely give up\nand will receive a fair trial.  Some weeks into this standoff, you are still\nholding out, when they begin a new ploy to induce your surrender, namely using\ntear gas to annoy you, and ramming your home with tanks.  Yet they claim that\nyou can safely surrender at any time.  While you patiently wait out this latest\nround of attacks, your house catches fire and the bales of hay you were using as\ncover spread the fire rapidly through the house, and you try to escape through\nthe fortifications you had raised for your own defense and the rubble created\nby the tanks.  Only 9 of your followers make it.\n\nI am not claiming that the above scenario is accurate.  I am disagreeing with\nthe notion that it is their own fault for dying because they refused to \nsurrender to agents of the Federal government after another federal agency\ncommitted an armed assault of their home on the basis of a flimsily concocted\nsearch warrant.  \n\nLook at how the Texas Rangers view the BATF.  Look at the FBI statements\nregarding the BATF actions.  From all apparent sources, the FBI blundered\ntrying to clean up the mess made by the BATF, resulting in an accidental fire\nwhich killed most of the BD's who were still in the compound, and are now \nplaying CYA.  The BATF committed an illegal assault, obtained the use of \nTexas NG resources with fabricated allegations, and compounded their abuses\nby accusing the BD's of crimes outside their jurisdiction once they had been\nheld off in their assault.
Well, we're not.  Which goes to prove you still don't understand what\nwe're saying here.\n\n\nI've lived through the bombing of Cambodia; My Lai; inflated body counts\nin VietNam; the funding of Noreiga; Watergate; Contragate; Chappaquiddick;\nKent State; domestic spying by the CIA; Edwin Meese's Pornography \nCommission; the War on Drugs; civil seizure; the MOVE disaster; the LA \ndisaster; and now Waco.\n\nDo you really believe that government always does what is right?\n\n\nWatch the news for the next couple of months.  Watch how this whole\ngovernment-initiated debacle turns into shouting for "more gun control."\nIt's already started.\n--

Speaking of ME's. The FBI said the fire victims were found face-up\n<fire victims, apparently, are usually found face down> \nsuggesting they died prior to the fire. The ME says, in a word,\nBULLSHIT, the victims WERE face down. The FBI says they sent a body\nof a victim that was shot, supposedly by BD guards, the ME\nsays, in a word, BULLSHIT, the body showed NO evidence of gunshot\nwounds. Can the ATF/FBI tell the difference between CYA and truth?
As far as I know, there is no FAQ for tpg.  Somebody was working\non one, but I think it "died in committee."
What a load of crap ! The BDs had absolutely NO RIGHT to fire\n	upon the BATF agents. If they didn't know who they were at\n	first, then they should have surrendered immediately when they\n	did realize who they were dealing with. Little groups of loonies\n	do not get to decide just what laws they will obey or disobey\n	or what sorts of warrants are justified. Like the rest of us,\n	they get their say at the voting booth and if their personal\n	wants are not backed by the majority of voters, then too bad.\n	If they wanted to keep automatic weapons, then they could apply\n	for the proper permits. If they had a problem with the warrant\n	then they get to argue that in court. In no event do they get\n	to establish their own little nation inside our own and pretend\n	that our laws and law-enforcement personel have no jurisdiction\n	within their borders. You live on US territory, you live by\n	US laws - period. (unless you are a congressman)\n\n	Sure, the situation was handled badly by both the BATF and\n	the FBI. It would have been all so easy to detain Koresh and\n	his core members while they were out in the streets of Waco.\n	The BATF, threatened with budget cuts, was trying for a\n	propaganda coup ... and dragging the press along for the big\n	commando-style assault is proof of that. They should be\n	roasted for both their imcompetance and their mindset. On the\n	other hand, they DID have the legal right to do what they did.\n	Once the attack was begun, they should have pressed on and\n	finished it rather than let an interminable situation like that\n	take root.
While I wouldn't be too terribly impressed with anybody who got\nto be paranoid based on either Usenet in general or Phill Hallam-Baker's\ncomments in general, you'd be surprised.\n \n       For most people, if you accuse them of something long enough and\nloud enough, to enough people, they start to ask why they're bothering\nto fight it.\n \n       If nothing you do will be considered right, why bother to do right?\nIt's pretty basic human nature.\n \n \n       What an amazing thing.  I didn't realize that over a hundred million\ngun owners all posted to tpg.\n \n       Even if *all* the posts in talk.politics.guns illustrated what\nyou say they illustrate, it would still only reflect the written\npersonas (which is often different from face-to-face) of a very, very\nsmall and select group.\n \n       Anybody who seriously generalizes any attitudes or positions on\nUsenet to the general population of any country either doesn't care\nabout accuracy or needs to have a few realities explained to them.\n \n \n        Speaking of which...\n \n      Most of the "readership" posts I've seen put the most read\nnewsgroups at about 160,000 readers, a number I have a feeling is\nfairly inflated.  The posters, rare and regular, are themseleves a\nvery tiny minority of that group.  And the whole of Usenet readers\nare themselves a very distorted sample of humanity.\n \n       If anything, the only real thing you can get out of the relative\nsample of Usenet readers is that we've got too much equipment and too\nmuch time available to us.\n \n \n        Proof that guns don't make you safer is that if you buy one the\ngovernment will show up and kill you?\n \n        Tell me, if the government took away the voting rights of\neverybody who exercised their free speech, would that then be proof\nthat free speech squelches political activity?\n \n        You are equating two things with each other that don't.\n \n \n        Phill, if you really believe that the various posts on\ncomputer nets represents *either* most of the poster's in person\npersonalities *or* the general public's general opinions, then\nI have some serious reservations about your grasp on reality.\n \n        But don't expect you really do believe that.  It's simply\na convenient way to make your point, and hopefully make those\npeople you don't like look bad.\n \n \n        Have a nice day, Phill.
Hmm... all reports from Texas authorities indicate that none of the children\nwhich the group released showed any signs of child abuse.. given that the same\nresults were found the last time the group was investigated for such allegations,\nI can pretty much state that I strongly suspect the government of disinformation\n/deception on this issue.  And about stockpiling weapons/food, many recognized\nreligous groups practice maintaining a one years supply of food, and some even\nmaintain a supply of weapons and ammunition, why are those two facts grounds \nfor an armed assault?  And from the dollar value of the weapons purchased, \nif they bought decent firearms it comes out to about one handgun, rifle, and\nshotgun for each adult, with a few extras...  Going by that rule, the BATF\nbest get ready for the fight of their life when they assault Alabama...
To Rob and all others that have been debating about the wood stove.\n   The original post claimed that the ATF/FBI was pumping napalm into the \nbuilding with the hopes that the wood stove inside would ignite it.  I responed\nwith why would the wood stove be lit in the first place?  It wouldn't be lit \nfor heating purposes because of the weather in Texas.  Everyone now claims \nthat it was for cooking.  Stop and think about this.  CS gas was being pumped\ninto the building and I presume that everyone was wearing gas masks (either\nbought or some type of makeshift type) and this had been going on for 6 hours.\nI don't know if you have ever been around CS, but I have.  Being exposed to CS\ngas was part of my Army training, so I know that without a mask it VERY \nuncomfortable and makes your eyes water, nose run, and makes you sick in \nthe stomach.  And with the mask it is very difficult to drink water much less \neat.  So my question now is "why were they cooking food?"\n   I will buy that a lantern could have been knocked over and caused the fire.\nBut that stove was not being used for cooking (unless they were even more\ncrazy than the ATF/FBI claim).
I leave the anti-semitism to anti-gun types like Holly Silva.  I have in\nfact been calling for the disbanding of the BATF for quite some time.\nIt is an outlaw agency run by incompetants who only have contempt for\nthe laws which they supposedly enforce.\n\nI attribute the acts of the FBI to stupidity.  I attribute the acts of\nthe BATF to malice.  So did Senator Dennis DeConcini when he held\nhearings about their misconduct.
Sorry Charles...According to the National Safety Council, ACCIDENT FACTS,1991\n"In 1990, gun accidents were the fifth-leading cause of accidental death\nfor children ages 14 and under."\n \n That thinking is so screwed up, I don't even know how to respond to it.\nA rational person would concentrate on motor vehicle deaths, and not attempt\nto affect childhood falls, drownings, gunshot injuries, etc.????????????????\nSo this so called rational person, (using your definition), if he or she\nwere attempting to affect the leading causes of deaths for adults aged 25\nthrough 64 would only worry about cancer, and would not try to decrease\nLESSER CAUSES such as heart disease, injuries, stroke, suicide, liver disease,\nchronic lung disease, homicide, HIV infection, or diabetes.  Oh, okay Charles,\nthat makes a lot of sense.  I tell you what Charles, I'll call the Heart\nFoundation and suicide hotlines and tell them that they are not acting rational\nand that they can all go home because they are addressing the LESSER CAUSES\nof death.  And you call your local police homicide department, liver foundation\nand diabetes foundation and tell them to stop addressing these lesser causes.\nPlease, quit wasting my time with this silly shit Charles.\n \nI've got an idea Charles, why don't you start a talk.politics.caraccidents\ngroup or talk.politics.fall group?  This is talk.politics.guns.  Don't\nconfuse the issue.  Just because a social problem may not claim as many\nvictims as another, we should not try to address it?  I don't agree.\nI'm not posting to t.p.g to debate the supposed severity of causes of\nchildhood deaths. I am really getting frigging sick of having to respond\nto the irrational statements of people who assume that someone who\nwants to discuss youth gun violence or unintentional youth gun deaths\nis trying to make a political issue out of it.\n \n \n Again Charles, you tend to confuse the issue and take things out of context\nfor your own purposes.  The statement that you responded to above is actually\nin reference to a previous post by another person who, like you, expressed\nconcern over making youth gun violence a priority.  I guess, maybe Humane\nperson and Rational person could be interchangeable huh? Both would be defined\nas "a person who only addresses the social problem that causes the greatest\nnumber of childhood deaths."  If that is the case, I'm extremely glad that I\nam inhumane and irrational.\n \nSorry Charles, the FBI Uniform Crime Report is WELL known for misrepresenting\nthe facts.  But if you insist, according to the 1990 UCR, "Firearm murders\nof youngsters 19 and under increased 125 percent between 1984 and 1990"\n \nIs the National Center for Health Statistics good enough for you?  They state\nthat "Every day, 12 American children ages 19 and under are killed in gun\naccidents, suicides, and homicides.  Many more are wounded".\n \nOr how about the National Pediatric Trauma Registry?  They say "Gunshot\nwounds to children ages 16 and under nearly doubled in major urban areas\nbetween 1987 and 1990."\n \nDo you also doubt the American Academy of Pediatrics Charles???  They state\nthat "Gunshot wounds among children in urban areas increased 300% from\n1986 to 1988."\n \nCharles, I hope you don't need to be convinced that youth are increasingly\nvictims of gun injuries and that they have easy access to guns.  If you don't\nrealize this fact, (I don't care if you go by CDC or FBI data, or if you go\ninto the homes, schools, and streets where these kids are and take a poll\nby yourself), I'm not going to bother to try to convince you.  Its obvious\nthat you have ruled out any idea of discussing this issue in a sane fashion\nand that you are so focused on trying to make this a gun control and political\ndiscussion.  I really don't want to do that.\n \n Charles, it's obvious that you know nothing about the CDC.\nThey don't just study cancer and heart disease.  I've got news for you,\ninterpersonal gun violence IS an epidemic.  In 1984, Surgeon General\nC. Everett Koop declared that gun violence is as much a public health\nproblem as cancer, heart disease, or auto accidents.\n \n \nWHO THE F**K SAID ANYTHING ABOUT TEACHING CHILDREN TO SAFELY HANDLE\nFIREARM CHARLES??? In the future, if you are going to post to t.p.g and jump\ninto a previous discussion, please read the entire posting, not just 1\nsentence that you decide to respond to. What the hell are you saying here???\nYou're wasting time and space trying to make a political and gun control\nissue out of a discussion that isn't.\nCharles buddy, I'm getting really tired of this.  Do you live on the planet\nMars???  As a physicist, I realize that you probably don't come into contact\nwith many youth, but I REALLY think you need to make a trip to your local\nurban high school and discover the joy of guns in schools.  In addition\nspend a few minutes talking to these kids.  Ask them if they have ever heard\ngunshots in their neighborhoods, whether they know anyone who has been shot,\nwhether they know anyone who has a gun, whether they have ever held a gun, and\nwhether they themselves have ever been shot.\n \nBelieve me Charles, THAT will be your *INDEPENDENT* VERIFICATION.
Flash over is a frequent occurrence with indoor fires.  A fire will\nstart small and in one location and heat the air.  The temperature in\nthe room builds up and then everything inflammable in the room catches\nfire at once.\n \nThis may have occurred in the BD compound, I have heard reports that\nthe windows were covered which would permit a fire to start unnoticed\nby those outside the compound.  When the fire got big enough, and\nbroke through the walls, it appeared to be started in two places but\nwas really one big fire.\n \nBecause of the large quantities of tear gas inserted into the building\nit is possible that many of the women and children were in a room free\nof tear gas they would try to seal the door to keep out the tear gas.\nWhen they learned that a fire had broken out it was too late for them\nto escape.  They were trapped by the flames in their safe room.\n \nI find it hard to believe that the FBI was not recording the final\nassault.  I think that they would have wanted to have tapes to show\ntheir agents of the the FBI overcoming the "forces of evil", aka\nthe Branch Davidians.  The tapes would also allow the FBI to prove\nthat they were not using excessive force.

From psc@sei.cmu.edu (Peter Capell) on rec.martial-arts...\n   >I'm sure such weapons have been developed.

I suppose I didn't\nmake myself clear, cause you seem to have gotten exactly the\nopposite impression from what I intended.  I suppose "the authorities"\nmight have been a better term than "society".  Carry and use a firearm\nin many parts of the country (certainly the parts I live in), and expect,\nat the very least, to have an awful lot of explaining to do.\nAnd there is also appears to be  a trend in society at large that\nactively opposes what many see as their right to defend themselves.\n\n   In a few other parts of our society, handguns are banned or\n   so restricted as to be practically unavailable to the law-\n   abiding citizen for self-defense outside the home.  Funny, \n   though, how the criminals in such places continue to have a \n   lush supply of guns and no compunctions about using them.  \n   IMHO, you don't need to be either a political philosopher or \n   a crime victim to realize that there's a flaw in the gun-\n   grabbers' logic.  \n\nAgreed.\n\n   You're welcome to your HO, too, the First Amendment being as \n   important as the Second, but please don't let your obvious \n   good intentions be subverted by insupportable generalities \n   about something as big and diverse as US society.\n\nMy only intention was to comment that the existence of suitable\nweapons of self defense doesn't mean you'll escape a whole shitload\nof trouble should you be forced to use them.\n\n   Or by the\n   naive hope that making gun possession a crime will give pause \n   to someone who would be a criminal anyway.\n\nI made no such statements, nor do I have such a naive hope or outlook.  \n   \n   Wishing you peace and the wherewithal to defend yourself\n   if others' thoughts are not that kindly,\n\nThat's all I want: the opportunity to leave in peace, or to \nhave the means to defend myself when that in not possible.\n\nI *think* we agree on this issue.

First the FBI said they saw two members of the cult start the fire-and the \nFBI never lies.  Second, the first started in opposite ends of the compound \nat the same time and thirdly, the fire spread too quickly for it not to be \nhelp without an accelerate.
Generally the ship sinks (sorry, there's a picture of the\nUSS Iowa next to my desk).\n\n\n	First, unless that round is chambered there is little threat of\npenetration by the bullet, or the brass for that matter.  Unless that\nexpanding gas is held in an enclosed space you get a nice "pop" and not\nenough threat for even firefighters to worry about.  Finally, it's\nrather simple to tell if a person was shot prior to being burned to\na crisp.  See, by the time the ammunition went up those people were\nquite dead.  Look for blood around the wound, particularly bruising.\n\n	However, it's my contention that it makes little difference\nwhether they died from exploding ammunition or fire; the Feds seem\nto have shared responsibility for both.
pete zakel is right, we don't need to worry about capitalization\nrules. after all, the punctuation gives all the necessary information\nabout the sentence structure. why should anyone worry about whether the\ntext is as close to the original as possible. (sarcasm intended). \n\n\nThen you didn't understand my grumble...  Again, I said to get a\nCORRECT version of the Constitution.  The first indicator that\nsomething is wrong (i.e. the copy has been modernized) is the modern\ncapitalization rules.  The next thing to go is the spelling, and then\nI've even seen versions where the GRAMMAR was modernized (oh, but\ndon't worry, modernizing the grammar won't change the meaning of the\ntext, right?... ;-)  [p.s.  I have found about 10 *different* versions\nof the Constitution on the network; And accuracy DOES matter...]\n\n--\nCharles Scripter   *   cescript@phy.mtu.edu\nDept of Physics, Michigan Tech, Houghton, MI 49931
Good. Another liberal converted by Waco!  If Dave had had something\n     realistic, there would have been none of this "Bradley" vehicle\n     crap.
I just read a clari article about how, among the other weapons\nthe BD had purched, they had two "Barrett 50-caliber armor-piercing\nrifles."  How the hell do you use an armor-piercing rifle?  Run\nup to a tank and try to stab it?\n\nOnce again, ignorance prevails amongst the media . . .
Indeed.  Larry King had the two attorneys (whose clients are now\ndead) of Koresh and another Davidian on his show last night.  Their\ndiscussions with the survivors differ from the FBI account.  The\nattorneys say that they were told that the tanks knocked over lanterns\nin the compound which started the fires.\n\nGovernment spokespeople have lied and contradicted each other \nthroughout this whole affair.  I'll wait for some better evidence before\nI form an opinion.\n-- \npaul hager		hagerp@moose.cs.indiana.edu
I've yet to meet a group of Baptists who were stockpiling Cambell's soup\nand M-16's/AR-15's and banging/marrying thirteen yuear olds. You're a sorry\nson of a bitch if you can't draw a distinction between these two things.\nPeople like you cheapen our constitution by using it to defend sociopaths\nwho aren't deserved of it. Get a life and chill on the paranoia.
Since neither side would be particularly interested in telling the truth,\nyou have to weigh the 'facts' given by each yourself, and weigh it with\nthe newsreporting if you care.\n\nMany cult members will probably side with the attorney, and if he\nis lying, change their stories to match his.  And if the Feds also\nlie, the cult members who become disillusioned will change their\nstories to match the Feds.  \n\nNeither sides are interested in the truth.  The Media is more interested,\nbut usually either don't have the time to get it straight or tie themselves\nto the ratings and deliberately distort.  \n\nFor me, though, the black soot billowing outside the compound added with\nhow fast the fire spread ponted to *someone* dousing large parts of the\ncompound with some sort of gasoline or fire-starter.  I doubt the Feds\ndid that as they were more interested in arresting Vernon.  The real\nunbalanced one (at least the one that lost his cool) was Vernon, so\nI figured that he was more likely to do it (after all he was Jesus \nbeing persecuted by the authorities, and had followers to hold onto,\nso made the decision.  He and his followers also probably felt that they\nwere rocketing to heaven by doing this stuff).  Thsi conclusion, I came\nto after umpteen million hours of listening to NPR and other radio\nshows (I always have the radio going when I am in my office on some\ninnocuous talk-show or news program as background noise).
But of course it does.   It's certainly a legal matter.  If it's not a\nlegal matter that interest *you* you may simply put it in your kill\nfile.
Two notes of interest from Texas:\n\nThe Tarrant Couonty ME (who is doing the autopsies) is well known for rendering\njudgements that are contrary to the police view.  He presented evidence a few\nyears ago that a man who police said was pointing a gun at them actually had\nhis hands in the air.  This does not bode well for the boys in black.\n\nThe Texas Dept. of Public Saftey and the Texas Rangers have no great love for\nthe ATF.  I have heard them referred to as "those fucking cowboys".  The DPS\nwas totally squeezed out of the BD operation and resented being left as\n"traffic cops".  ATF now has two strikes against them.\n\nFinally (I guess that makes three notes), rumour from Waco is that four ATF\nagents were stopped by four Waco police cars and a DPS trooper after one of the\nflashed "an automatic weapon" at a cop.  Lots of pissed of cops.  And you\nwonder why there were so few cops really cheering on the ATF.
>Some< of?\n\n\n  Yes, I think so and it has been reported as such.  Seems like a cowboy\nmovie-style attack was needed for some reason....\n\n\n  The answer is probably YES. But consider; what was the WORST thing that\ncould have happened if they waited?  Hint: whatever it was it could not have\nbeen any worse that what DID happen.  \n\n\n  But that statement of taking full responsibility is totally meaningless.\nWhat are the consequences for being fully responsible for this disaster?\nA note in your personnell file??  Slick already called these people a bunch\nof crazy people and dismissed the idea she should resign.  Doesn't take \nANY balls at all to take the responsibility.  Hell, at that rate >I< will\ntake full responsibility for it.  No skin off my nose....\n-- \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------
>politicians as deadly tax weapons needing to be confiscated!) If they are
Assuming the fire was caused by lanterns and stoves being knocked about\nby the tanks pushing on the walls (would shake a building pretty good)\nperhaps they didn't flee because fleeing would have meant ENTERING the\nfire from the other side?  Like they were surrounded by the fire, and\nrubble, which finally (combined with teargas, and combustion gasses)\novercame and enveloped them?\n\nIn other words they were TRAPPED by the flames, heat, fumes and rubble?\n\nDoes that sound plausable?  Not as dramatic as Korash forcing them to\nstay, or shooting them (no shot victims found yet), but plausable...
Ironic, since it's pretty much what was used to blow up the World Trade\nCenter...\n--
Few simple points:  Leadership: You are responsible for all that your \n                      subordinates do or fail to do.\n\n                    Law: Any deaths that occur as a result or during the\n                       commision of a crime are a felony against whoever dies\n                       during the incident, and whoever committed the crime\n                       establishing the incident is chargable for MURDER ONE.\n                       This is how criminals are charged with murder for the\n                       deaths of bystanders from police stray rounds and such.\n                       Someone dying of a heart attack is also considered a\n                       murder one, if it is in a situation caused by a crime.
I suppose it's too late now, but the repeated use of the word\n"release" is peculiar.  Let's say you and your family are besieged\nin your home by some people with tanks, helicopters, and automatic\nweapons.  They give you a break from the amplified sounds of dying\nrabbits to blare, "You in there!  Release the children, and they'll\nbe perfectly all right."  Stipulate on top of that that you may not\nhave your epistemology entirely in order.  Is it entirely surprising\nthat the Branch Davidians were reluctant to "release" their children\ninto FBI custody?
