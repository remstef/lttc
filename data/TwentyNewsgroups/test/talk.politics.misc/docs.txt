A few questions for Janet Reno:\n\n	Why don't you think generals have any place in law enforcement?\n\n	If the ATF/FBI had proof that Koresh was:\n\n		A child molester\n		A child abuser\n		A wife abuser\n		Bigamist\n		Sexual Deviant (not a crime in all 50 states, yet)\n	As well as\n		Illegally modify weapons\n\n	Why wasn't he simply arrested during one of his morning jogs?  Why did\nthe allegations of child/wife/sex crimes only come out after the Branch\nDavidians repelled the initial assualt?\n\n	Was it because it became necessary to demonize David Koresh?  Do you\nfeel responsible for the deaths of over 80 people?  How many would be alive to\nday if Koresh had been arrested outside the compound?\n\n\n	Inquiring minds want to know.\n\n	[Although Janet was installed after the siege began, her purge of the\njustice dept. leaves only her people in charge.]

How about letting in the press?\n\nHow about letting Koresh out to talk to the press?\n\nMaybe if he had been allowed to talk with the press/TV for a couple of\ndays he would have surrendered peacefully.\n\n\nHow about letting the relatives of Koresh`s followers talk?\n\n\nSeems to me when you isolate someone, try to send them crazy by playing\nloudspeakers through the night of Tibetan chants, etc., you don`t have\nmuch to stand on when they behave as if they are crazy.  (I`m not too\nsure of their sanity to start with.)\n\nI am VERY suspicious when the government controls all communication,\nand sends the press 2 miles away. \nI have a gut feeling that no-knock warrant, which is sealed, would not\nstand up to scrutiny.
The private insurance industry skims the cream off the milk...simple.
<more tripe deleted>\n\nPhill, are you trying to convince everyone on the net that\nyou are in fact an abject moron for some reason? Repeating\nthe same rubbish over and over again may make something a \n"fact" in whatever backwater you are posting from, but it doesn't\nwash here, so save it.
## Don't forget that 25% had 20 or more partners....\n#\n#Not surprising.  Remember, that study includes homosexuals as well.\n\nErr, earth to Clayton, you posted this to show that 2% were\nhomosexual. So if we assume EVERY homosexual was promiscious, that\nleads us to conclude that 23 percent of heterosexuals are promiscious.\nAnd that first assumtion is a bad one.\n\nClayton, it *IS* suprising from the claims you are making.
What crap, Phil. 50mm? Wrong. To give you a clue as to how big 50mm is, the\n F-16 fighter aircraft have 20mm gattling guns used to shoot down other \n aircraft.

Sorry, but I'd have to differ.  The Canadian-bashing wrt to the health \ninsurance system is largely with little evidence or prompting.  Having\nkept up with this debate on the net for some months, just about all the\ncriticism of the Canadian system has misquoted or misinterpreted even\nthe anti-Canadian propaganda put out by the American insurance industry\nand the AMA.  \n\nIn a few cases, such as Mr. Case, the critiques are well-reasoned and\nworthy of response.  Most others are misinformed, illogical,\nor just plain dumb.  I don't think the same can be said of the "American\nproponents" of the Canadian system, much less of the Canadian proponents.\n\njsh
NOT an accurate analogy. David Koresh did not take a bunch of\nhostages and then call the BATF with a ransom note. You make\nit sound as if the BATF showed up to save those children in the\nfirst place. I have some interesting news for youBATF\nhas absolutely NO jurisdiction in child abuse cases. \n\nIt seems to me that the BATF showed up, took the Davidians hostage. \nThen the FBI showed up, negotiated to have a few of the hostages \nreleased, but were unable to keep the BATF from killing the rest \nof the poor people trapped inside the compound.\n\n        Steve Martin\n        Steve_Martin@msmgate.mrg.uswest.com
I wouldn't worry too much about it, though.  We are starting to find\nout how politically impotent homosexuals really are.  The Colorado\nboycott has fizzled, Slick Willie was effectively prevented from\nimplementing his military policy wrt homosexuals by members of his\n_OWN_ party, this new study casts a large shadow of doubt on their\nclaims of large numbers, and coming this Saturday they are going to\nwind up with _TREMENDOUS_ egg on their face when, I submit, no more\nthan perhaps 35,000 queers will show up in Washington while they are\npromising crowds in the millions.  And most of the ones who will be\nthere will look like ACT-UP and Queer Nation, not the guy working in\nthe next cubicle.  As if that's really going to play in middle\nAmerica.\n\nPretty soon they will find themselves retreating back into the closet\nwhere they belong.
What I saw on TV and what you claim are two different things. The\nDavidians did not start shooting until after the BATF lobbed a couple\ngenades in the windows and started shooting themselves.\n\n\n	EASY! If you see federal agents in body armor with sub machine guns\ngoing in throught windows, that is a No-Knock warrant. Also since the \nvideotape shows the BATF throwing grenades before the BD's etunred fire, \nyou can safely assume that they didn't ring the doorbell.\n\n\nP.Vasilion,
dead? I saw David Koresh at a local 7-11......
Doesn't seem like those responsible for the assault were very concerned\nabout the welfare of the children inside.  Seems like they were more\ninterested in flexing their muscle before the media.  My reasoning?\nJust ask yourself this one question:\n\nSuppose the scenario was slightly different and we had Chelsea Clinton\nbeing kidnapped by terrorists, holed up in a compound for 51 days.\nDo you think Clinton, Reno, the FBI, and the ATF would be so eager\nto use a show of force?\n\nNuff said.\n\n\n-- \nRichard Mulac                                       ck347@cleveland.freenet.edu
Sure ... because it's a non-market phenomenom and the free market\ncan't solve it.  Even our private insurance says that ....\n\n\n.... and wants no part of it.\n\n\nCanada is saturated by American media.  While pundits come on cable\nand talk about how awful our health care is supposed to be, what\npeople experience up north ends up not differing from what they see\nportrayed on American television in movies (i.e., same infrastructure,\ndifferent insurance make-up).  Yet they know not of any insurance\nproblems, and have no idea of what an HMO is ... but having lots of\nBritish TV as well, they know that they don't like NHS.\n\n\nThe polls that you refer to, for the Canadian data, are from the\nannual July 1st polls conducted for Macleans (our major English\nnewsmagazine) by Decima Research ... Decima president Allen Gregg is\nconsidered one of the world's top poll researchers, and Mulroney's\nConservatives have relied on him to keep in power in the face of\nimpossible election situations.  The American polls are Harris polls,\nand have been reposted on USENET a few times and probably will again.\nI'm sorta suspicious myself, 'cos maybe Americans want universal\ncoverage like Canada --- I honestly doubt that most Americans realize\nthat we have private doctors and public and private hospitals (i.e.,\nsimiliar health care infrastructure) and our "system" is basically\npure insurance without HMO's.\n\n\nUntil the idea of managed competition arose, there was no direct\nthreat to stand-alone private practice.  In the 1960's, the AMA\nfought HMO's as corporatized socialist medicine ... part of the\nreason why we have only insurance, and no HMO's in Canada 'cos\nthat was part of the deal cut with the CMA.\n\n\nBut each site is probably compact, and the clientele are creamed.\nAnd don't forget that HMO's place caps on your coverage, and often\nwon't tell you about additional procedures you could get otherwise\n(despite that you might be willing to pay for it).\n\ngld
Hehehe!  Dontcha just love these carefully constructed arguements?\n\nClayton, babe, please define the word `molest`.  Are you using a legal\nterm or a proper dictionary term?  Molest, as far as I can remember, means\n`to do damage to person(s)`.  My mate, Mike, was lured into a woman's parlour\nwhen he was 14.  Is that molestation?  A number of my friends (straight) lost\ntheir virginity before that.  Were they 'molested'?  They told me that they\nthoroughly enjoyed the experience.  I see no damage.  \n\nPlease stop pushing your objective morality on others.  If you push, people won't\nfall over and say 'Ye gads, you're right!', they'll just push back.\n\nHave you signed up for that logic course yet?

Give ME a break, chum.  Are you telling me that Clinton and\n      Reno DID NOT KNOW that the BATF actions were ILLEGAL, adn\n      in VIOLATION of their warrant?
Sorry, but this is a red herring.\n\nAre you contending that the "mountain of forms" are processed by Blue\nCross?  Having had Blue Cross insurance both as a government employee\nand as an employee of a private corporation, I saw no difference between\nthe two sets of forms.  \n\nMoreover, the administrative costs associated with Medicare/Medicaid,\nthe two primary forms of "government" insurance are considerably lower than\nthe average for private insurance companies.   (5% versus 14%-16%).\n\nIf you have any evidence that Blue Cross bears a heavier burden in insuring\ngovernment employees than private employees, post it.  Otherwise, try\nto stick to factual assertions.\n\n\nWell now, that's an interesting defense of the "free enterprise" system.\nAre you contending that it is government intervention that prevents \nprivate insurance companies from "standardizing?"\n\nIn fact, it is true that some of the red-tape burden stems from the \nlack of standardization among the 1500 or so private insurers in the US,\nbut it's a little difficult to understand how this is anything other than\n"free enterprise" at work.  \n\nBy the way, Barron's, the bible of Wall Street, this week admitted that\nadministrative costs were significantly lower in Canada because "....a\nsingle-payer system is always cheaper...".  Guess even the "free enterprise\nadvocates" are beginning to see the light.\n\nSorry, but you seem to be confusing proposals with health care\nreform with the Bush administration's gag order on federally funded family\nplanning clinics.  There are no proposals that would control what your\n"doctor...can and cannot say about medical procedures."\n\nTry again.\n\njsh
That probably is not true.  But today it may not be much better for\nthe gay population in general.\n\n\nWhere are all of these studies?  You have cited a few, and my research\nshows that there are not that many.  Do Not Confuse a survey as a\nstudy, there is a big difference.  Asking people outside of a polling\nbooth and adding up numbers is NOT a study.\n\n\nBut this is what you base most of your conclusion upon. Warm\nfuzzy feelings.\n\nMaybe he has stated an educated opinion based upon the studies\nthat involve genetics and psychological influence.  There are a\nlot of those types of studies, aren't there?  Try reading some.\n\nThis is a crap statement and comparison.  Many people use this sad\nand stupid argument.  There is not relationship between alcoholics\nand people's sexual orientation- except that some may find what it\nreally is when they are drunk (repressed inhibition released).\n\nNonsense- this simply is not true.  I suppose it is a waste of time\nto try and tell you to understand what a study presents.  Most of\nwhat you cite does not extrapolate anything, you do.\n\n\nIf people in general would stop using irrational position to oppress\nother's and leave our private lives to ourselves, I would have no\nsupport for laws and rules to protect people form this.  But we need\nonly look at post such as yours to see that they lack rational\nthought and intelligent outlooks.

The following statement was released\non February 27,1992 by the Science &\nEnvironmental Policy Project\n\nAs independent scientists researching atmosphere and climate problems, we are \nconcerned by the agenda for UNCED, the United Nations Conference on \nEnvironment and Development, being developed by environmental and  activists \ngroups and certain political leaders. This so called "Earth Summit" is \nscheduled to convene in  Brazil in June 1992 and aims to impose a system of \nglobal envionmental regulations, including onerous taxes on energy fuels, on \nthe population of the United States and other industrialized nations.\nSuch policy initiatives derive from highly uncetain scientific theories. They \nare based on the unsupported assumption that catastrophic global warming \nfollows from the burning of fossill fuels and requires immediate action. We \ndo not agree. \nA survey of U.S. Atmospheric scientists, conducted in the summer of 1991, \nconfirms that there is  no consesensus about the cause of the slight warming \nobserved during the past century. A recently published research paper even \nsuggests sunspot variability (which is directly proportional to solar \nactivity),  rather  than a rise in greenhouse gases is responsible for the \nglobal temperature increases and decreases recoded since about 1880.\nFuthermore, the majority of scientific participants in the survey agreed that \nthe theoretical climate climate models used to predict a future warming \ncannot be relied upon and are not validated by the existing climate record. \nYet all predictions are based on such theoretical models.\nFinally, agriculturalits generally agree that any increase in carbon dioxide \nlevels from fossil fuels burning has beneficial effects on most crops and on \nworld food supply.\nWe are disturbed that activists, anxious to stop energy and economic growth, \nare pushing ahead with drastic policies without taking notice of recent \nchanges in the underlying science. We fear that the rush to impose global \nregulations will have catastrophic impacts on the world economy, on jobs, \nstandards of living, and health care, with the most severe consequences \nfalling on developing countries and the  poor.\nDavid B.

My \nthoughts and prayers are with the families of David Koresh's \nvictims.\n\nThe law enforcement agencies involved in the Waco siege \nrecommended the course of action pursued today.  The Attorney \nGeneral informed me of their analysis and judgment and \nrecommended that we proceed with today's action given the risks \nof maintaining the previous policy indefinitely.  I told the \nAttorney General to do what she thought was right, and I stand by \nthat decision.
I haven't recognized any names from previous discussions, but I do\nnotice that there are a few who blame Clinton for the actions of the\nBATF in Waco.  Unless you felt the same way about what we did under\nBush's *direct* command in Panama, it's just partisan whining.  Which is\nwhat I expect most of it to be.  I can see no way to condemn one and not\nthe other.  \n\nBut I'm sure some Limbot will tell me how killing thousands of\nPanamanian civilians to serve an arrest warrant is much better than\nallowing 80 religious fanatics to commit suicide following a botched\nattempt by the BATF to serve a search warrant.

Gosh, I have to associate with heterosexuals against my will every day! \nThat means you've imposed your moral codes on me, now doesn't it? \nFortunately, I have taken the time to get to know some members\nof the het community and discovered that, hey!  They really AREN'T all evil\nelitists with no concept of reality!\n\nI've got a few clues for you.  (a) I'm not working to pass any laws.  (b)\nOur morals are YOUR morals: I imagine you value freedom.  So do we.  If you\nvalue your own freedom, you must necessarily accept that these laws are\nimportant to protect it.  After all, discriminate in one area and you're\nopen to discriminate in the rest.  (c) I suggest learning a bit more about\ngays, lesbians, and bis before you post the kind of drivel you have been. \nIt's obvious that you haven't a clue who you're talking about.\n\n\nBut not between members of the same sex, right?

Oh, do please try not to be ludicrous.  SO=Significant Other, a term I employed to avoid the awkward construction "girlfriend or wife".\n\n\n\nA "deviant" is someone who does not fit an "accepted norm."  By that definition, I would certainly be a deviant, as bisexuality is not an accepted norm in American society so far.  This term, of course, really has no negative aspects inherent in its denotation.  I presume you intended it as a term of abuse.  It's a great pity you feel such tactics to be necessary, but hardly surprising since you have no factual basis for your absurd beliefs.\n\n\n\nMay I attempt to emulate your style of discourse with a term of abuse?  Ahem...You addle-pated jellyfish!  The post to which I responded was a highly amusing one in which you belittled homosexuals for having no political clout.  I would be further amused if you would explain to me why having no political clout and constituting a political minority are different.\n\n\n\nAnd yet you call them "girls!"  The feminists would be up in arms.\n\n\nCough, cough.  Well, well, you certainly are a fine, upstanding fellow, you are, sir.  And like many "fine, upstanding fellows," you have the reading comprehension of a dyslexic anteater.  Perhaps I should have been more explicit in pointing out that females constitute a political minority in this country when last I checked, and that your obvious lack of respect for these minorities equates to a lack of respect for women.  That is, of course, a conceptual stretch of logic, but given your slow uptake as de\n\n\n\n\nmonstrated so far, I figure we should start simple and work up.  Don't worry, you'll get it\n     \n!\n\n\n\nThis is very true, this bit about nature asserting itself.  Homosexuality has always been a part of human society, and always will be, for that is the natural order.  If you're naive enough to believe otherwise, go right ahead; we'll try not to snicker too loudly behind your back.\n\n"Inevitable."  Chortle.  Anyone would think you had some idea what you were talking about.  I haven't seen fact one from you, and until I do you can just dispense with the bullshit, and tell us what we already know, that you're a clueless little slime mold with no concept of reality beyond The Donna Reed Show.  Live a little, and then come back and tell us all about the "natural order of things."  You're in a bubble, and it's really going to rock your world when you come out.\n\n\n\n"Foolish and misguided."  Oh, this is too much.  So which religious figure do YOU believe you are?  And how do you know so much about the nature of man?  You're almost too amusing to be worth the effort of crushing your pealike brain.      \n\nGee, you sound awfully sure of yourself.  "Methinks the bigot doth protest too much."  Admit it: you're scared shitless that what you've been spoonfed all your sorry little life was wrong, and you're trying to escape that fear by a blind faith that you know, deep down, is based in nothing, nothing at all.  Go ahead, clutch your unfounded declaratives to your empty breast; ignore the myriad of societies that have accepted homosexuality as equally valid or even mystical.  Ignore the solid, inescapable fact t\n\n\n\n\nhat we've existed as long as humans have.  Fear us.  Go ahead.  Laugh at us if it makes you feel better.  We both know you're just whistling in the dark.  There's one group that's stamped out whenever it appears, in any form, and that's the group of boneheads who fancy themselves morally superior.  You're in that group, and you're slowly and steadily being stamped out.  Preach while you can, little man...it won't be long.\n\n\nThat's the first truth you've told so far.  I don't hate hets, sir.  I'm bisexual, and I embrace man- and womankind alike.  I have nothing against those who don't understand my love.  But you deny its potency and validity.  You would crush us all, human beings to a one, in your imagined divinity.  It's fools like you that stir my ire...idiots with the small minds, who can't think for themselves, who know nothing about how the real world operates, and who hate because they are told what to do and do it like\n\n\n\n\n sheep, who hate everyone who refuses to be a sheep.  You're not part of the norm.  You're part of a minority--YES, a minority!--with supreme, o'erweening arrogance.  Your hubris will topple, because it always has, because those with intelligence know it to be a clown's costume.\n\nWow, that was pretentious!  I sometimes wonder why I waste my talents on zeroes like you.  I really have no interest in continuing this effortless discussion; after all, this is for me the proverbial battle of wits with an unarmed opponent.  Come back with some swords--i.e. facts--and we shall do battle.  Till then, begone from my sight.\n\nDrewcifer
There is something terribly wrong, however, with a culture which\ncondemns, attacks, and all too often kills any of its members who\nattempt to get an education.  My mother is an elementary school\nteacher, and she tells me that she and her african american collegues\nare frustrated to tears by the fact that any african american child who\nattempts to do well in school and get an education is accused by\nhis/her peers of "trying to be white", and is beaten, bullied, and\ntormented by them.  It goes beyond each passing grade on a test earning\na beating.  In my mother's school, one of the most promising young\nstudents, who happened to be african american, had her throat cut by\none of these young thugs.\n\nNobody who buys into such a culture has any hope of being anything but\npoor and/or a thug and/or dead, regardless of their color.\n\nWhat has to be changed is the culture.  If that culture can't be\nchanged, then those african-american kids who are willing to separate\nfrom it *must* be separated from it and the murderous thugs of whatever\ncolor.  Otherwise, future bright young african american girls who\nwanted to be doctors will end up dead on the school bus.
This is getting sad.  All you can do is make this ridiculous statements,\nbased upon some old information and a Press Democrat article that was\npoorly written.\n\nPlease show the numbers for your use of "MUCH more".  I have not seen\nthem.  And I want them to be true and accurate, or at least show a \ntrend within the everyday gay population.\n\nThere are all kinds of 'damaged and screwed up' people, and most of\nthem are not gay.

THE WHITE HOUSE\n\n                    Office of the Press Secretary\n______________________________________________________________\nFor Immediate Release                             April 20, 1993     \n\n	     \n                       REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT\n            IN QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION WITH THE PRESS \n\n\n                           The Rose Garden\n\n\n1:36 P.M. EDT\n	     \n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  On February the 28th, four federal \nagents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law \nagainst the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled \nweaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk.  \nBecause the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day \nstandoff ensued.  \n	     \n	     The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every \nreasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without \nbloodshed and further loss of life.  The Bureau's efforts were \nultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were \ndealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably \ninsane.      \n\n	     He engaged in numerous activities which violated both \nfederal law and common standards of decency.  He was, moreover, \nresponsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the \naction against the compound in February.  Given his inclination \ntowards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no \nprovocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal \nagents against the compound.  \n	     \n	     This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on \nan operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure on \nKoresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully.  \nThe plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even \nin the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause \npermanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people \nin the compound to come outside and to surrender.\n	     \n	     I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  I \ndiscussed it with Attorney General Reno.  I asked the questions I \nthought it was appropriate for me to ask.  I then told her to do what \nshe thought was right, and I take full responsibility for the \nimplementation of the decision.  \n	     \n	     Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy.  \nMr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal \nagents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his \ncaptives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not \nsurvive.  He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate \nresponsibility for the carnage that ensued.\n	     \n	     Now we must review the past with an eye towards the \nfuture.  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and \nTreasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to \nuncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been \ndone differently.  I have told the departments to involve independent \nprofessional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  I \nexpect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required \nto complete the review.  Finally, I have directed the departments to \ncooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can \ncontinue to be fully accountable to the American people.\n	     \n	     I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney \nGeneral, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on the \nfront lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult \ncircumstances.  \n	     \n	     Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorry \nfor the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end \nof this tragedy in Waco.  I hope very much that others who will be \ntempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David \nKoresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over \nthe last seven weeks.  And I hope very much that the difficult \nsituations which federal agents confronted there and which they will \nbe doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future \nwill be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what \nhas been learned now.\n	     \n	     Q	  Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why, \nafter 51 days, you decided --\n	     \n	     Q	  Mr. President, can you describe for us what it is \nthat Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation \nwith --\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  I can't hear you both.  If one will go \nfirst and then the other.\n	     \n	     Q	  Sorry.  Can you describe what Janet Reno --\n	     \n	     Q	  Mr. President --\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll answer both your questions, but I \ncan't do it at once.\n	     \n	     Q	  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about \nthe nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was told by the Attorney General \nthat the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another \nstep in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And she \ndescribed generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted \nto go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause \npermanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it \nvery difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it was \nhoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.  \n	     \n	     I was further told that under no circumstances would our \npeople fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going to \nshoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and \nthere would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awful \nlot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials.  \nThere were no shots coming back from the government side.\n	     \n	     I asked a number of questions.  The first question I \nasked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasons \nI was given were the following:\n	     \n	     Number one, that there was a limit to how long the \nfederal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the \nquality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be \nneeded in other parts of the country.\n	     \n	     Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had \nnever seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced \nthat no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to \nbe made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult \nmembers to come out.  \n	     \n	     Number three, that the danger of their doing something \nto themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with \nthe passage of time.\n	     \n	     And number four, that they had reason to believe that \nthe children who were still inside the compound were being abused \nsignificantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and \nunsafe conditions.\n	     \n	     So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time.  \nThe second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had \ngiven consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and \nevaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said \nthat the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were \nconvinced that the chances of bad things happening would only \nincrease with the passage of time.\n	     \n	     The third question I asked was, has the military been \nconsulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco, \nthat's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious \nthat this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military \npeople were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some \nof the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the \nmilitary had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they \nhad, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one \nminor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military \n-- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming \nsignificance.\n	     \n	     Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I \nsaid that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she \nshould proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by that \ntoday.\n	     \n	     Q	  Mr. President --\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead.\n	     \n	     Q	  Can you address the widespread perception --\nreported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were \ntrying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.  The only \nreason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only \nreason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to \nadd to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather \nlate in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who \nhad been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into \ncustody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events \nto unfold.  \n	     \n	     There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people \nspeculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General \non the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday.  \nI called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry \nKing Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- it \nis not possible for a President to distance himself from things that \nhappen when the federal government is in control.\n	     \n	     I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprised \nwould be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the \nAttorney General should resign because some religious fanatics \nmurdered themselves.  (Applause.)  \n	     \n	     I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this \nlife to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  These \npeople killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They were \nheavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly, \nand they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could to \navoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolate \nthemselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the \nchildren.  \n	     \n	     But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno, \nis when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you \nto tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why \nyou believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And she \nsaid, it's because of the children.  They have evidence that those \nchildren are still being abused and that they're in increasingly \nunsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier \nwith time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word for \nthat.  So that is where I think things stand.\n	     \n	     Q	  Can we assume then that you don't think this was \nmishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of \npatience?  And if you had it to do over again, would you really \ndecide that way?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assume \nis just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI has \ndone a lot of things right for this country over a long period of \ntime.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the \nWorld Trade Center in lickety-split, record time.  We want an inquiry \nto analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else we \nshould have known?  Is there some other question they should have \nasked?  Is there some other question I should have asked?  Can I say \nfor sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make \nthe outcome come different?  I don't know that.  That's why I want \nthe inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have \nsome independent law enforcement people, not political people, but \ntotally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best \nevidence we have.  \n	     \n	     There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of \nfanaticism all across the world.  And we may have to confront it \nagain.  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do, \nparticularly when there are children involved.  But I do think it is \nimportant to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the \npeople who killed others and then killed themselves.\n	     \n	     Q	  Mr. President, were there any other options \npresented to you for resolving this situation at any point from \nFebruary 28th until yesterday?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, yes, I got regular reports all \nalong the way.  There were lots of other options pursued.  If you go \nback -- you all covered it very well.  The FBI -- you did a very good \njob of it.  I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursued \nany number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them \nearly on seemed to be working.  Some of the children got out, some of \nthe other people left.  There was a -- at one point, there seemed to \nbe some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the \nauthorities.  And then he would say things and not do them and things \njust began to spin downward.  \n	     \n	     Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened \nyesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not \ninvolve other options except whether we should take more time with \nthe present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they \nwanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get \npeople out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves.  \nThat's what they thought.\n	     \n	     Q	  Did the government know that the children did not \nhave gas masks?\n	     \n	     Q	     congressional hearings once the situation -- are \nyou in agreement with that?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  That's up to the Congress.  They can do \nwhatever they want.  But I think it's very important that the \nTreasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring \nin some outside experts.  And as I said in my statement, if any \ncongressional committees want to look into it, we will fully \ncooperate.  There is nothing to hide here.  This was probably the \nmost well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the \ncountry.\n	     \n	     Go ahead, Sarah.\n	     \n	     Q	  There are two questions I want to ask you.  The \nfirst is, I think that they knew very well that the children did not \nhave gas masks while the adults did, so the children had no chance \nbecause this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal, but it was \nvery dangerous to the children and they could not have survived \nwithout gas masks.  And on February 28th -- let's go back -- didn't \nthose people have a right to practice their religion?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  They were not just practicing their \nreligion, they were -- the Treasury Department believed that they had \nviolated federal laws, any number of them.\n	     \n	     Q	  What federal laws --\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me go back and answer -- I can't \nanswer the question about the gas masks, except to tell you that the \nwhole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; they \nwere convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult but \nit would force anybody that breathed it to run outside.  And one of \nthe things that I've heard -- I don't want to get into the details of \nthis because I don't know -- but one of the things that they were \nspeculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that \nthe windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have \nescaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect.  \n	     \n	     They also knew, Sarah, that there was an underground \ncompound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be \nsent.  And they were -- I think they were hoping very much that if \nthe children were not released immediately outside that the humane \nthing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace \nwhere they could be protected.  \n	     \n	     In terms of the gas masks themselves, I learned \nyesterday -- I did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas \nwas supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks \nthemselves were to work.  So that it was thought that even if they \nall had gas masks, that eventually the gas would force them out in a \nnonviolent, nonshooting circumstance.\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Last question.\n	     \n	     Q	  Mr. President, why are you still saying that --\n	     \n	     Q	  Could you tell us whether or not you ever asked \nJanet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide?  And when you \nlearned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your \nmind during those horrendous moments?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  What I asked Janet Reno is if they had \nconsidered all the worse things that could happen.  And she said --\nand, of course, the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the \npublic -- he had -- that had been debated anyway.  And she said that \nthe people who were most knowledgeable  about these kinds of issues \nconcluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would \nbe tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in \nthe future.  That was the judgment they made.  Whether they were \nright or wrong, of course, we will never know. \n	     \n	     What happened when I saw the fire, when I saw the \nbuilding burning?  I was sick.  I felt terrible.  And my immediate \nconcern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were \nescaping or whether they were inside, trying to burn themselves up.  \nThat's the first thing I wanted to know.  \n	     \n	     Thank you.\n	     \n	     Q	  Mr. President, why are you still saying it was a \nJanet Reno decision?  Isn't it, in the end, your decision?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I'm saying is that I didn't \nhave a four- or five-hour, detailed briefing from the FBI.  I didn't \ngo over every strategic part of it.  It is a decision for which I \ntake responsibility.  I'm the President of the United States and I \nsigned off on the general decision and giving her the authority to \nmake the last call.  When I talked to her on Sunday, some time had \nelapsed.  She might have made a decision to change her mind.  I said, \nif you decide to go forward with this tomorrow, I will support you. \nAnd I do support her.  \n	     \n	     She is not ultimately responsible to the American \npeople; I am.  But I think she has conducted her duties in an \nappropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation I think as \nwell as she could have.  \n	     \n	     Thank you.  (Applause.)
The FBI says that some of the survivors claim to have seen the leaders\nof the cult talking about setting a fire, and to have smelt kerosene.\nI assume this will come out at any trial that occurs as a result\nof these events.
Because the Gun loonies were firing on vehicles with 50mm amunition that\nhas a range of 3000 meters.\n\nNext question.\n\n\nThe problem is of course the laws that allow a bunch of raving nutters\nto collect a huge stack of arms in the first place.\n\nThe sequence of events meant that there really was no option but to\nattempt some sort of breakthrough via an intervention. If the FBI had\nhad the stomach for it they could have mounted a commando type\nraid and attempted to save the children by shooting all the adults.\nIt really was a no win situation. Koresh had plenty of opportunity \nto give up and stand trial for the murder of the 4 ATF officers. Instead\nhe ordered the murder of the children.\n\n\nIn order to reject the word of the FBI and BATF it is neccessary to beleive\nthe words of a man who has just murdered 17 children and ordered the \nsuicide/murder of his other 80 followers. According to the account given\nthe BATF attempted to serve a warrant upon Koresh at the ranch and were met\nby gunfire in a deliberate attempt to murder them. The Koresh/gun supporter\nclaim that the BATF started shooting simply does not stand up. If the \nAFT had gone there to start shooting they would have gone with heavier\ngrade weaponry than standard issue handguns. For all practical purposes\nthey were unarmed, the B-D followers had automatic weapons.\n\n\nThe B-D seige could not be allowed to go on indefinitely. The B-D were\nquite capable of commiting mass suicide and murdering the children at any\ntime. A commando assault was the only other likely action that could have\nachieved that objective, that would have been very risky, orders of \nmagintude harder than Antebbe or the Iranian Embassy Seige. Airplanes\nand Embassies are not designed for defense against attack ranch \napocalypse was. 6 terrorists are far easier to disloge without casualties\nthan 80.\n\nAllowing the siege to go on was not an option either, besides the serious\nrisk that Koresh would proclaim armageddon at any moment there was the \nquestion of the difficulties of keeping the emmergency team on standby over\na prolonged period. The longer the siege went on the more mentally prepared\nKoresh and his followers would be for a prolonged siege. Rather than go\nin prematurely the mistake was probably to go in too soon.\n\n\nCan you think of a better way of getting the children out?\n\nA 100% certain way?\n\n\nThe people who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire\ngovernment story. This is simply rationalisation. It is not enough for \nthem to simply dismiss the government as incompetent. That would require\nthem to come up with a solution themselves. Instead they have to come\nup with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decided to\nset out to murder 80 people just to set up some sort of scare to alow them\nto get gun control legislation through.\n\nThis conspiracy theory assumes that the BATF deliberately got 4 of its\nagents killed and that the FBI etc actually enjoy sitting out in the\nmiddle of Texas being shot at by religious nutters.\n\nStill the conspiracy theory is comforting, it allows them to pretend that\nWACO proves nothing except about how incompetent the government is in \nresolving a hostage crisis. No govt in the world has ever faced a \ncomparable situation, quite probably there was no manner in which it\ncould be peacefully resolved. The blame does not rest on the FBI, it\nrests on the fact that Koresh was allowed to get so far, in particular\nthe person who tipped the B-D off in advance has the murder of 4 ATF\nagents and 17 children on his or her conscience.\n\n\nThere are a large number of people in the US who predict the end of society\npreach salvation through armed security. The fact is that these are the\nvery people who pose the threat to society in the first place. The next WACO\nmay not be religious nutters but a political movement. A splinter group\nof the Klu Klux Klan taking over a schoolhouse in a black area for example\nand holding several hundred children hostage.\n\nThe only possible solution to such situations that can work is to prevent\nthem arising. No other government in the world has faced such a situation. \nthis is because no other government has so carelessly allowed high power\nweaponry to become avaliable to any little Hitler or would be Messiah\nto set themselves up as dictator in their own little empire.
Mr. Cramer, when are you going to stop indulging in such blatant lies?\nThis is not only not true, you know damned well that it's not true.  None\nof your research supports this; no mental health expert has taken this\nposition.  This is *your own* opinion which is not backed up by any\nresearch or any knowledge.\n\nAccording to one survey, done in San Francisco, the number of heterosexual\nmen who were molested as children was on the order of 5%.  The number of\nhomosexual men who were molested as children was on the order of 8%.\nSource:  a book on sexual abuse of children by David Finkelhor (sorry,\nthe title escapes me).\n\nConclusions that can be drawn from this:  none.\n\n\nOh, you definitely have a choice.  You realize, of course, that you\nare approaching the two-year anniversary of your crusade.  How are\nyou planning on celebrating two years of lies?\n\nIncidentally, we are still waiting your crusade against African-Americans,\nwomen, and other minorities who also want to "impose their morality on\nothers".  After all, they also want the government to "tell peaceful\npeople how to live."  Therefore, you really "have no choice", but to\ncontinue to point out that being a woman or an African-American is not\na lifestyle, but a sickness.\n\nIt's bullshit, Mr. Cramer.  It was bullshit when you began this crusade\nand it's still bullshit.  I am continually amazed at the depths to which\nyou'll stoop to carry on this deliberate attack.
Can people please stop the 'I think/know the BATF/FBI are completely\nresponsible but they'll cover it up so that the investigation will\nshow that Koresch is responsible' bs. In an investigation of this\nsize with the feds, state, and civilians involved in the\ninvestigation it would be practially impossible to cover up.\nAnd with Republicans like Arlen Spector calling for investigations,\nthis isn't going to be handled with kid gloves.
WOW!  Another Clayton wannabe.  Typical response: lack of logic.\n\nDefine 'deviant':  someone who deviates from the normal.  Ok, so far.\nDefine 'normal':   erm, umm.  If you define yourself as normal then it is for\nyou to prove that you are (within limits, which then brings in the question,\nwhat are the limits?  For you we may have to broaden them to other's intolerance\n;-) ) 'normal'.  Difficult to prove.  From what you have posted it must follow\nthat `normal` to you means someone without compassion and a sense of justice.\nBut it does look as if you went to the Clayton school of logic, doesn't it?\n\n\nAgain an astounding lack of logic!  Wow!\n\nYou must define what you say such that everyone agrees.  Here you have used\nthe phrase "sexual deviant".  How in the hell do you define that?  As someone\nwho does something sexually that _you_ don't?  By this definition you most\nprobably mean the majority of the planet.  How do you know that your next\ndoor neighbour doesn't like custard to be spread over his genetalia then\nhave it licked off by his wife?  Is this sexual deviancy?  How do we know\nthat you don't like something sexually which others may find repulsive?  Is \nhaving sex doggy fashion a sexual deviancy?  Please be more specific, and\nwhere you do, back up your claims.  Or I may have to go to hospital due to\nlaughing too much at yours and Clayton's postings.\n\nSecondly, if we assume for the moment that the phrase 'sexual deviant' means\nsuch people as homosexuals, bisexuals &c. (basically everyone you don't like),\nI think that your phrase "do not comprise a `political minorit[y]`" (why the\nbrackets?) is a non-sequiteur.  Gay groups exist which lobby their governments.\nThat is a fact.  Prove it false.  Hence they are a politial group.  You \nstate that they are not a political minority.  Are they therefore a\npolitical majority?  I think you boobed really big on this one.  Try thinking\nabout your arguments.\n\n\nProve the first statement please.   Dates, phone numbers, &c.\n\nAgain your logic fails.  Again you make statements which you cannot\n(and most probably will not) maintain.\n\nYou state that a person (girl, in this context) who considers equal rights\nfor all humans to be an airhead?  As Clayton (your best mate?) would say:\nit just shows how screwed up you are.\n\n \n\nProof please.  Proof that homosexuality is not part of the natural order.\nProof that nature has always asserted itself.  Are you saying that nature\nis a conciousness?  Are you pretending that you have the ability to see the\nfuture?  Are you god(tm)?  In fact, by your arguement, are you waiting for \nthe black people to become slaves again?  Because they were reviled as\nsub-human (nb: *not* my view) at one time?  Again your arguement falls\non its ass.\n\n\n\nTouchy touchy touchy!\n\nRight.  I have shot holes in each and every one of your arguements.  You are\nmost probably going to put me in your kill file because you have no answers\nto my questions and challenges.  Since you cannot support your arguments it\nmerely goes to show that what you write is based upon your personal prejudices,\nand cannot be taken to be fact of any kind.\n\nI await an intelligent response.....
Well, for one thing most, if not all the Dividians (depending on whether\nthey could show they acted in self-defense and there were no illegal\nweapons), could have gone on with their life as they were living it.\nNo one was forcing them to give up their religion or even their\nlegal weapons. The Dividians had survived a change in leadership\nbefore so even if Koresch himself would have been convicted and\nsent to jail, they still could have carried on.\n \nI don't think the Dividians were insane, but I don't see a reason\nfor mass suicide (if the fire was intentional set by some of the\nDividians.) We also don't know that, if the fire was intentionally\nset from inside, was it a generally know plan or was this something\nonly an inner circle knew about, or was it something two or three\nfelt they had to do with or without Koresch's knowledge/blessing, etc.?\nI don't know much about Masada. Were some people throwing others over?\nDid mothers jump over with their babies in their arms?
Janet Reno, the FBI, et al were nothing but pawns in Koresh's game.\nHe was a madman who was going to hurt the children, and everyone\nelse in the compound no matter what the FBI did.\n \n \nSuch a hostage situation has taken place on numerous occasions\nwith the result of the police trying to take the place by\nforce and the result being the death of the hostages and the\ngunmen. However, this is the first time I've heard of\nthe blame landing squarely on the police.\n \nIn this country we have a policy of not negotiating a back down\nfrom terrorists and hostage takers since that only encourages\nother terrorists and hostage takers.
For starters, they could have gone on waiting and negotiating.  The Davidians\nweren't going anywhere, and their supplies had to be limited.  Large, perhaps,\nbut limited.  If they had simply fired the compound by themselves without\ngov't tanks smashing down their walls, then at least the gov't would not be\nguilty of having _again_ used an inappropriate level of force, and would have\nbeen able to use the meantime to continue to pressure and negotiate.  No, they\nwould not have looked good on the news in six months or a year.  But they sure\nas hell don't look very good now.\n\nLarry Smith (smith@ctron.com)  No, I don't speak for Cabletron.  Need you ask?
As you're no doubt aware, Phill, there are probably five or six\ndifferent, mutually contradictory versions of the events in Waco on\nFeb. 28 all of which are from reputable news sources, ranging the the \nAssociated Press to TIME to Newsweek.\n\n        Some of the earliest reports issued by the AP were not at all\nflattering the to BATF, and produced some question as to who fired first.\n\n        Now, for all I know, you were there to witness it.  But\nI kind of doubt that.\n\n\n        The BATF, in a letter they've been sending out to people,\nsays both that they were ambushed because they lost the element of\nsurprise, and that they went up and knocked on the door and had it\nslammed in their faces.\n\n        It strikes *me* as kind of strange to rely on surprise to\nserve a warrant by knocking on the door.\n\n        There are at least questions that need to be answered.\n\n\n        This paranoid assertation was made by witnesses to the original\nassault who stated that the BATF initiated hostilities by throwing\nconcussion grenades and reported by the Associated Press.\n\n\n        Phill, the BATF were in a firefight with the BD for *forty-five*\nminutes.  I find it hard to believe that if they were expecting peaceful\ncitizens they *wouldn't* have shown up in live-stock trailers and would\nhave retreated immediately.\n\n        If they *were* expecting peacful citizens, why show up with over\na hundred officers, some of which clearly visible on video to be carrying \nsub-machineguns, and *3* National Guard Helicopters?\n\n        I don't know who did what, but, as I said, there are questions that \nneed to be answered.
Anybody for carpeting in Bosnia/Serbia?  I mean like, carpet bombing\n         of Serbian positions?

Or ask Phil if he still claims that\nthe Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the 14th amendment\napply to the federal government.  The responses should be as\nenlightening as the recent name-calling, and about as relevant.\n\n-- \nThey told me you had gone totally insane, and that your methods were unsound.
Let's try that again:  Why was the BATF concerned about surprise\nwhen they intended to serve the warrant by knocking on the door?  The\nBATF appears to be inconsistant in their own description of events.\n\n       And in any case, how does one mount an ambush if one isn't\n"on alert?"\n\n\n       So, were the BATF fired on before or after they left the trailers\nto knock on the door to serve the warrant?  Every description I've\nheard indicates the BATF did not hang around in the trailers once\nthey decided to open them up.\n\n       For that matter, if they expect peaceful citizens, why come in live-\nstock trailers to being with?\n\n\n       Ok, just to make sure we've got this straight:  You consider\narmed troops in disguised vehicles and multiple helicopters to be\nused to serve search warrants on peaceful citizens.  (And just so\nwe don't have one of those entertaining shifts, *you* described them\nas the BATF expecting them to be, peaceful.)\n\n\n       I don't see how past abuses excuse present ones.  Hell, you're\nnot even discussing the same government.
Of course they did, otherwise they wouldn't have staged the\nraid in the first place.\n\n\n\n\n\nNapalming seems a bit redundant.\n\nThe Stupidity was in the BATF mindset 'We're from Washington\nWe Know Better"  Execute Plan A: Storm the compound in a No-Knock\n- the locals are gullible rubes, who cares that they served\nwarrents by knocking on the door.  Such an old fashioned, out dated\nmethod of Law Enforcement anyway.

Hey don't confuse these guys with facts dude!

Atomic Energy Commision - Hmm, they would say this.\n\nThe Earth may spew alot of substances into the atmosphere, but the quality \nof your toxic output can easily make up for the lack of quantity.

Also, two wrongs do not make a right, \nso continuing our practices despite overwhelming data is just ignorance in (non)action.\n\n\nEducated and open minded environmentalists do not.
[...]\n\n\n\nMr. Kuo: I don't recall seeing your byline around much before (at least\non t.p.m). Let me clue you in on this newsgroup. t.p.m is populated\nlargely by people whose hatred for the U.S. government, especially\nthe government of Mr. Clinton, is literally boundless. To these\npeople, the suggestion that agents of the U.S. government would carry\nout a spectacular massacre of its own citizens, in full view of TV\ncameras, is not an 'extraordinary claim'. It's just another day in\nthe life of these United States.\n\nThey don't have to suggest any reason why the FBI would want to\npublicly massacre citizens. Have you seen 'The Crying Game'? \n\n	"It's in their nature".\n\n\nDon Pajerek

Certainly many religious beliefs seem to be positive principles for\neveryday living.  Indeed, I believe it is the Islamic religion which\navoids alcohol (I apologize if I name the wrong religion) and that\nis certainly a physical positive in many respects.  However, this\nproves nothing.  Just because something is a "basic, pragmatic\nprinciple of day-to-day living" TODAY doesn't mean it evolved from\nthe same.  Especially those beliefs and (mostly) positions held based\non interpretations of the religion.\n\nReligious beliefs come from many places but most will be backed up\n(after many levels of arguments) to "Because that's how it is written."\nor "God says..."  Now I'm not faulting that but that is not a basic,\npragmatic principle as you mean it in this context.  It is a belief\nbased on faith, which by definition is not necessarily backed up by\nlogic.  Faith is a given.  God is a absolute truth when arguing from\nreligion.  Also, many religions would reject your thesis that their\nbeliefs simply come from these day-to-day principles.\n\nIn summation, if you wish to use religious arguments be prepared to\nback them up with "It says in the [fill in religious document here],"\nbecause most religions (things which at least I denote as religions)\nare based on the writings of or teachings of [fill in religious\nfigure here].\n\nNOTE: Religion is a charged topic and if I offended anyone regarding\n	  my references to God, I apologize.  Please insert your own\n	  sensible references, the argument should apply to nearly all\n	  religions.
FURY OF MOTHER NATURE\n\nMan's contribution to environmental "pollution" are paltry compared to those \nof nature. In her exceptional book TRASHING THE PLANET, former Atomic Energy \nCommision Chairman Dr. Dixie Lee Ray notes based on the available data, "all \nof the air polluting materials produced by man since the beginning of the \nindustrial revolution do not begin to equal  the quantities of toxic \nmaterials, aerosols, and particulates spewed into the air from just three \nvolcanoes: Krakatoa in Indonesia in 1883, Mount Katmai in Alaska in 1912, and \nHekla in Iceland in 1947." To which could be added Mount St. Helens in \nWashington State in 1980 (which pumped out 910,000 metric tons of carbon \ndioxide alone). El Chicon in Mexico in 1982 (which sent more than 100 million \ntons of sulfur gases into the stratosphere), and Mount Pinatubo in the \nPhilippines (which in 1991 hurled upwards of 30 million tons of material into \nthe stratosphere).\nLOS NINOS\nMany environmentalists attributed the 1988 drought in the U.S. to global \nwarming, but researchers with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in \nBoulder Colorado reported that the freakish weather was actually due to a \nnatural phenomenon, the interaction of El Nino and El Nina, two massive \ncurrents in the tropical Pacific. El Nino is a huge strip of warm water that \nperiodically appears off the coast of South America and disrupts the world's \nweather patterns. Now and then, it alternates with El Nina, a mass of cold \nwater that comes from the ocean depths along the equator and drifts for \nthousands of miles.\nCHICAGO TRIBUNE'S  Peter Gorner summarized the phenomenon: "Cold water along \nthe equator clashed with warmer than normal water southeast of Hawaii. The \nresult was both the U.S. drought and the devastating floods that swamped \nBangladesh...... Nina's cooler water disrupted tropical weather patterns and \ndistorted the path of the Jet Stream across North America. Then the Jet \nStream shoved rain-producing weather systems away from the interior of the \nU.S. resulting in drought."\nTERMITE TERROR\n\nSundry animals and insects also contribute their share to environmental \n"degradation. TIME for April 20,1992 noted that in "the Netherlands... manure \nfrom pigs poses a major ecological threat, defiling water supplies with \nexcessive nitrites and acidifying local soils. Sheep have permanently scarred \nthe landscape in Spain and Portugal, while in India ... bovines [cows] are \nravenous wraiths whose constant quest  for food drives them to ravage \nstanding forrests."\nThe February 1983 issue  of SCIENCE DIGEST reported that "an international \nteam of researchers has discovered that termites generate more than twice the \nCarbon Dioxide  that fuel burning does." According to a study reported in \nSCIENCE for November 5, 1982, the "estimated gross amount of Carbon Dioxide \nproduced [by termites] was more than twice the net global input from fossil \nfuel combustion." In addition, "Termites are a potentially important source \nof atmospheric methane: they could account for a large fraction of global \nemmisions." The wood-eating pests have a bacteria that enables them too \ndigest carbon so efficiently that some 90 pe is converted too Carbon Dioxide, \nmethane, and other gases they belch into the atmosphere.\nAnts are another natural source of "pollution." In 1987, an atmospheric \nchemist with Bell Laboratories, and zoologists from Cornell University, \nreported that ants of the subfamily FORMICINAE make and store huge quantities \nof the formic acid that contributes most of the acidity of rain that falls in \nremote areas and is found in atmosphere gas and precepitation around the \nglobe. It is abundant, for instance, in the fog and mists that hang over the \nrain forests of Central Africa. According to the July 6, 1987 INSIGHT \nmagazine, the "ants release the acid when defending themselves and \ncommunicating with each other and upon dying. Since  30 percent of the world \nant population belongs to this subfamily, there is significant concern about  \nthe acid the ants release," an amount estimated at "600,000 metric tons \nannually." which is equal to the combined formic acid contributions of \nautomobiles, refuse combustion and vegetation."\nClearly, man has a long way to go to match nature as a "despoiler" of the \nenvironment.\nBy Robert W. Lee.

Cited as part of the National Institute of Mental\nHealth Task Force on Homosexuality.\n\n   Pomery concluded, "The Kinsey statistic of 37% is probably higher\nthan is realistic.  According to these estimates, 33% is a more\nrealistic figure."\n\n   (I went out and bought LOTS of Bell & Weinberg this weekend... can\nyou tell?)\n\n   Also, The Janus Report on Sexual Behavior (Samuel S. Janus, Ph.D.\nand Cynthia L. Janus, M.D., John Wiley & Sons (pub), 1992) has the\nfollowing:\n\nTable 3.14\nHave you ever had a homosexual experience?\n          Men.

This number is consistent with Kinsey, Pomery,\nGebard (1953), Bell & Weinberg (1967, 1974), and Rice (1987) in the\nfinding that 9% of the male population is actively homosexual, with\nan further breakdown (Bell & Wienberg, 1978) of 4% exclusively so and\n5% self-identifying themselves as "bisexuals."\n\n   (pp 69, 70)\n\n   As for debunking Kinsey, the following article is an important\nlesson for everyone to read:\n\nWas Kinsey a Fake and a Pervert?\nby Philip Nobile\n\n     Far out on the grassy knoll of sexology, there is a cult of\nprochastity researchers who claim that the late Alfred Kinsey was a\nsecret sex criminal, a Hoosier Dr. Mengele, who bent his numbers\ntoward the bisexual and the bizarre in a grand conspiracy to queer the\nnation and usher in an era of free sex with kids.  \n\n     But what really riles these critics is Kinsey's towerin~ cultural\ninfluence.  His bestselling surveys-- Sexual Behavior in the Human Male\n(1948) and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female (1953)-- tore the\nsheets off the country's erogenous zones and undermined midcentury\nmorals.  His charts and graphs, based on detailed histories of 12,000\nmen and women, demonstrated that practices generally considered rare\nand/or 'abnormal'-- masturbation, extramarital relations,\nhomosexuality, and even barnyard bestiality, were as American as\nstrawberry shortcake.  \n\n     Yet for a hard core of these heterosexual supremacists, aided and\nabetted by Pat Buchanan and the religious right, the zoology professor\nfrom Indiana University remains the evil genius behind the sex\nrevolution and a target for character assassination.  \n\n     Judith Reisman, the prosecution's expert witness at the\nMapplethorpe trial in Cincinnati, is the leader of the anti- Kinsey\nrevisionists as well as his Inspector Javert.  In 1983, during a radio\ninterview with Pat Buchanan in Washington, Reisman accused Kinsey of\nhaving been inolved in "the vicious genital torture of hundreds of\nchildren."  She speculated that he kidnapped and drugged ghetto boys in\norder to carry out clandestine orgasm tests.  \n\n     Now, seven years later, Reisman has revived her charges in a\ndifferent book, titled Kinsey, Sex and Fraud, just released by the\nsmall and religiously oriented Huntington House in Lafayette,\nLouisiana.  Her coauthor is Ed Eichel, a Manhattan psychotherapist who\nhas invented a new style of intromission ("the coital alignment\ntechnique") that supposedly triggers simultaneous orgasm with\nconsiderable regularity and thereby increases compatibilty between the\nsexes.  In the book Eichel contends that "Kinsey deliberately cooked\nthe gay stats because, being an oddball himself, he wanted to advance\nthe 'denormalization' of heterosexuality."  \n\n     If the authors are right, then the world- famous Kinsey Reports\nare, as the introduction boldly asserts, "the most egregious example\nof scientific deception in this century."  And if they are wrong,\nKinsey, Sex and Fraud is a shameful smear.\n\n     Despite the less- than- stellar credentials of Kinsey's\ndetractors, legends are not what they used to be.  Martin Luther King\nmay have committed plagiarism.  Bruno Bettelheim slapped young mental\npatients around.  Father Bruce Ritter, the founder of Covenant House,\npreyed on runaway boys.  Closer to Kinsey, Masters and Johnson have\nbeen disgraced for faking it in one way or another.  \n\n     So it should not surprise anybody that Kinsey, who filmed strange\npeople having sex in his attic, may have had skeletons in the closet.\nThe problem is that Reisman does not seem to have the intellectual\nprowess to pull off the job.  \n\n     As a thinker, the woman is no Madame Curie.  The 55-year-old\nformer songwriter for Captain Kangaroo has little professional\nstanding, no current university position, and no peer-review\npublications, though her creative 1983 resume was padded with phantom\naccomplishments.  For instance, it listed a book as her own-- Take Back\nthe Night: Women on Pornography-- that was actually written and edited\nby others.  Then there is her Ph.D. in Speech Communication from\nCleveland's Case Western Reserve University.  Although Reisman has no\nbachelor's degree, Case granted her a master's in 1976 and a doctorate\nin 1979.  Her dissertation was on the commentaries of a local\noctagenarian TV commentator.  But on the resume, Reisman gave this\npiece of scholarship a fancy Hautes Etudes moniker-- to wit: "The\nApplication of Aristotelian and Systems Analytic Theory to Mass Media\nEffects."\n\n     When Reisman burst into prominence on Buchanan's program, it was\nlove at first sight for Al Regnery, the outwardly anti- \nporn head of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention in Ed Meese's\nJustice Department.  Regnery was a young law-and-order conservative and\namateur social philosopher who wanted to help change the sexual\nclimate of the United States.  \n\n     After Reisman's sensational radio session, the sexual equivalent\nof Joe McCarthy's Wheeling speech, Regnery summoned \nher to meetings to discuss mutual interests.  First he tried to shovel\nher $800,000 for a quasi-Frankenstein study that was going to measure\nthe brain chemicals of men and boys who looked at arousing\nphotographs.  Guffaws on Capitol Hill killed the original proposal, but\n$734,000 in govemment money went to Reisman anyway for plan B- a probe\nof child images in the cartoons Playboy, Penthouse, and Hust\nler.  (Incredibly, this grant surpassed the entire budget of the\nattorney general's pornography commission.) \n\n     When the overpriced and oversold project was completed in 1986,\nit was immediately shelved by an embarrassed Justice Department.  That\nspring, Regnery resigned from his post only days before the New\nRepublic carried this admission that he had kept porno magazines\naround the house.  \n\n     Notwithstanding the six-figure humiliation, Reisman went on to\nscratch out a niche on the ioony right.  As the darling of the sex\ncranks, she deplores subversive phenomena like shaved genitalia in\nmen's magazines and blames AIDS on gays.  Kinsey, Sex and Fraud is\nReisman's latest grasp for respectability.  Pat Buchanan, of course, is\nputting his Krugerrands on Reisman's ultimate vindication.  "This book\nis social dynamite," he says in a blurb an the front cover.  He\nespecially liked the antigay parts.  Smacking his lips in his\nsyndicated column, he declared, "It may just blow the sewer cap off\nKinsey's monumental reputation, reestablish homosexuality as a 1-in-50\naberration, expose the Gay Rights movement as a paper tiger, and even\nput at risk the enormous sex industry built upon Dr. Kinsey's\n'research.'"\n\n     The blockbuster charge at the heart of the cluttered and\nrepetilive j'Accuse is that Kinsey was a sex-mad pedophile who\nmolested little boys in Nazi-type experiments and recorded their\norgasms in his male volume/ A similar charge was first recited at the\nFifth World Conference on Sexology in Jerusalem in 1981 to no effect\nbefore being recycled by Reisman for Buchanan in Washington in 1983.\n\n     Here is how Reisman and Eichel repackaged the Mengele business in\nKinsey, Sex and Fraud:\n\n     Mengele-like 'scientific' experiments on infants and children\nwere the basis for Kinsey's conclusions...  on childhood sexuality.\n\n     Somewhere and sometime in the course of the project, Kinsey\nappears to have directed experimental sex research on several hundred\nchildren aged from two months to almost 15 years.\n\n     This, of course, would implicate Kinsey and his team in\npromoting, and perhaps participating in, the criminal activity.\n\n     In the opinion of this book's authors, that is exactly how part\nof Kinsey's child sexuality research took place.\n\n\n     Donning his psychohistorian's cap and citing an FBI manual on\nchild molesters as a guide, Eichel casually diagnoses Kinsey as a\nhomosexual pedophile with the perfect motive for doing exactly as\n \n\n     [Kinsey] placed himself in professional and nonprofessional\npositions where he had access to young boys, such as Y.M.C.A.  camp\ncounselor, boys' club leader, and Boy Scout leader-- activities he\nkept up 'during his college and graduate yeaers, and even after his\nmarriage."\n \n\n     As crude as his analysis seems, Eichel was more than happy to\nelaborate even further in a recent phone interview.  "If you've ever\nbeen around boy- lovers, pedophiles, they are absolutely compulsive,"\nhe averred.  "Everything in his life is directed at getting children.  I\ndidn't mention this in our book but the caption under Kinsey's high\nschool picture was a quote from Hamlet: 'Man delights me not, no,\n[sic] nor woman neither.' What do you think they were picking up on?" \n\n     Before weighing what Reisman and Eichel pass off as proof of\nKinsey's sex crimes, something must be said about Kinsey's scientific\nmodus operandi.  He was a fiendish collector.  As a young zoologist with\na D.Sc.  from Harvard, he collected 4 million gall wasps and 1.5\nmillion related insects.  When he switched to sex exploration after\nagreeing to teach a marriage Course at Indiana University in 1938, he\nwas no less curious or acquisitive.  Nothing that mammals did in the\nrealm of reproduction was foreign to him.  He compiled masses of erotic\nmaterials including toilet wall inscriptions from male and female\njohns that highlighted differences in sexual psychology and flms of\nmating in 14 species of animals that showed an amazing similarity in\noral eroticism.  \n\n     Naturally, the sexual response of children, the genesis of eros,\nfascinated him.  It was impossible to understand the sexual behaviors\nof adults without examining their origins.  And so with the fervor of\nhis bughunting days, Kinsey collected information about kids, though\neven his worst enemies-- until Reisman and Eichel-- refrained from\nlinking him personally to his data on preadolescent sex.  \n\n     Kinsey said plainly in the male volume that he got information on\nthe sex life of young boys from people who had sex with them: "Some of\nthese adults are technically trained persons who have kept diaries or\nother records which have been put at our disposal."  Although he\ngathered much boyhood data from the memories of his subjects and the\nobservations of parents and nursery school teachers, he treated the\ndocumentary materia! of the pedophiles as pure gold.  There was nothing\nlike it in the literature.  \n\n     Kinsey's main source, a 63-year-old govemment worker, was also\nthe most unforgettable character he had ever met.  This man, whose\nhistory took 17 hours to log, had sex with over 600 boys and 200 girls\nas well as 17 of 33 family members including his father and\ngrandmother.  A sexual hobbyist and passionate record-keeper, he gave\nKinsey detailed accounts of orgasms that he observed in preadolescent\nboys.  Relying on the man's meticulous research, which involved\nfollowing some boys for as long as 16 years, Kinsey was able to\nidentify for the first time six distinct types of male orgasm-- some\nof which involved violent contortions at the peak of release-- as well\nas the speed and the capacity of climax.  \n\n     What Freud had only imagined about childhood sexuality, Kinsey\nhad reported as fact.  Children were indeed erotic beings from the\ncradle.  "These data on the sexual activities of younger male provide\nan important substantiation of the Freudian view of sexuality as a\ncomponent that is present in the human animal from earliest infancy,"\nhe concluded without raising eyebrows in 1948.  \n\n     Then along came Judith Reisman.  Ignorng the legitimacy of\nKinsey's inquiry, she beheld the ghost of Mengele in Bloomington.  She\nwas appalled by the thought of infant ecstasy and read torture in the\nportrayals of prepubertal orgasm rendered by the government worker.\nAnd she dared to say that Kinsey was a sex criminal.  \n\n     Well, was he or wasn't he? Let's go to the text.  There is no\nevidence in Kinsey, Sex and Fraud-- no witnesses, no paper, noteven a\ntrace of hearsay-- that implicates Kinsey in either planning or\npartaking in child sex experiments.  After 12 years on the trail,\nReisman has uncovered just two sources to back up her original charge-\n- amazingly enough, Kinsey himself and Wardell Pomeroy, Kinsey's\ncoauthor on both reports, to whom Reisman has never spoken.  It turns\nout that her whole case rests on a few passages in the male volume\niand in Pomeroy's 1972 biography titled Dr. Kinsey and the Institute\nfor Sex Research.\n\n     After frisking every "the" and "and" in both books, Reisman came\nup with what she believes are "smoking" sentences.  To establish\nKinsey's alleged role in the planning, she says that "there is a hint"\nin the fifth chapter of the male volume that Kinsey "directed" the\norgasm studies on kids.  She cites his tell-tale quote from a critic of\narmchair psychoanalysis demanding that "writers...test their\ntheories...by empirical study and statistical procedures."  Then she\ncombines this quote with Kinsey's statement that some of the\nobservations of his pedophile sources "were continued over periods of\nmonths or years until the individuals were old enough to make it\ncertain that true orgasm was involved."  \n\n     Putting two and two together-- Kinsey's empiricism and lengthy\nexperimentation-- she arrives at her hint.  But realizing this dog\nwould not hunt, she devoted but a single paragraph to Kinsey's\nsupposed planning before shifting to the issue of his personal\ninvolvement.  As for the alleged participation, after poring over\nPomeroy's biography, Reisman found several hidden clues suggesting\nKinsey's likely hands-on approach to kiddie sex.  Here the chain of\nreasoning is more complex.  She points out that Kinsey was interested\nin clitoral measurements, collecting sperm and filming sex in his\nattic.  Since Kinsey did indeed mislead Indiana University about the\npurpose of his cinematography-- he said that he was filming "animal\nsex"-- Reisman asserts that a "similar misrepresentation may yet apply\nto Kinsey's child sex experiments."  Catch the "may"!\n\n     Reisman was also struck by Kinsey's doubting Thomas attitude\ntoward the never before recorded climax of female rabbits: "Kinsey,\naccording to Pomeroy, was the type of person who needed to see things\nfor himself.  Pomeroy gave the example of orgasm in the female rabbit.\nBecause he had not personally witnessed this event, Kinsey had\ndifficulty in accepting its reality, even on the strength of testimony\nfrom a distinguished scientist.  How then did Kinsey testify to the\nactuality of orgasm in a 5-month-old infant from the mere 'history' of\na sex offender?" (But, of course, he did not: he depended on their\nrecords.) \n\n     From this fantastic alchemy of conjecture mixed with clitorides,\nsperm, attic cumshots, and climax-in-cottontail has Reisman defamed\nthe legendary Kinsey.\n\n     Paul Gebhard succeeded Kinsey as the director of the Kinsey\nInstitute and now lives in retirement outside Bloomington.  Reached by\ntelephone, Gebhard defended the pedophile connection and denied\nReisman's nasty imputations.  "I don't understand the resistance of\npeople like Reisman to studying the sexuality of children," Gebhard\nsaid more in exasperation than anger.  "That is where sex begins.  We\nwere happy to take data wherever we found it.  Even though pedophiles\ncommit criminal acts, they are usually not violent folks.  They\nwouldn't be very successful if they were.  One of our best sources was\na headmaster of a boys' school who maintained a kind of alumni club\nand sometimes went to the weddings of his former students.  As for\ndirecting experiments, that's absurd.  We never told any of our\nsubjects what to do.  lt was against our principles.  Almost all of the\npedophile material was retrospective anyway.  Nor did we ever conduct\nsex experiments with children ourselves.  That would have been highly\ninappropriate."  \n\n     I asked Gebhard if Kinsey had ever seen a child in a sexual\nsituation.  "I think a mother once brought in a little girl who humped\nher teddy bear and Kinsey watched it."  \n\n     As for Kinsey's sex life, it is still shrouded in\nconfidentiality.  He was married to the same woman for 35 years and\nfathered four children.  Apparently, there are no huge sexual\nrevelations, although rumors of homosexuality have persisted without\nconfirmation through the years.  Gebhard took his boss's history back\nin the '40s, but he refuses to discuss what he knows.  "We never\ndivulge anything about anybody's history, whether dead or alive," he\nsays.  \n\n     Reisman said no to an interview for this article on the grounds\nthat I had once worked for Penthouse-- not to mention the fact that we\nhave been debating each other in various forums for the past five\nyears.  In keeping with our contentious history, she took a swipe at me\nin her book for continuing "the Kinsey practice of euphemizing\nincest."  My offense was using the biblical variant "lying with a near\nrelative" in a 1977 article on the subject of incest.  As a synonym for\nintercourse, "lying with" appears eight times in Genesis.  \n\n     Ed Eichel is a different story.  Though seemingly obsessed by\nKinsey like his coauthor, he was friendly in long conversations.  He\ntold me that he began to smell a big baised agenda in sexology when he\nwas a student in New York University's Human Sexuality program in the\nearly '80s.  "It was literally a gay studies program for heterosexuals,"\nhe says.\n\n     Around 1985, Eichel came upon Reisman's critique of Kinsey and\nthe conspiracy theory started to sink in: the sex establishment was\nruled by a Kinseyan bisexual bund advocating the overthrow of the\nheterosexual norm.  No wonder he was having such a rough time promoting\nthe joy of simultaneous orgasm-- anything that enhanced sexual\ncompatibility between men and women inevitably raised objections.\n\n     Eventually, Eichel exchanged philosophical fluids with Reisman,\nand from this union Kinsey, Sex and Fraud was born.  Eichel's main\ncontribution to the book is discovery and analysis of a Kinsey\nconspiracy that supposedly seeks "the establishment of bisexuality as\nthe balanced sexual orientation for normal, uninhibited people" which,\nby destroying the traditional family structure and normal sexual\nbehavior, "would open the way for the second and more difficult step--\nthe ultimate goal of cross-generational sex (sex with children)."  \n\n     When I pressed him for specific references to back up his\noutrageous contentions, he said weakly, "You don't think Kinsey is\ngoing to come right out and say that everybody is basically bisexual\nand should have sex with kids, but this is implicit in the Kinsey\nreports."  \n\n     Meanwhile, Eichel is demanding a congressional investigation of\nKinsey and his data.  Perfect.  That's just what the country needs-- a\nHouse Un-American Sexual Activities Committee, looking under beds and\nasking people if they are now or have everbeen a reader, a sympathizer\nor-- God forbid-- a subject of Dr. Alfred Kinsey.\n\n\n         Elf !!!\n--\nelf@halcyon.com  (Elf Sternberg)
There are two things at work here ... the public insurance is very\nwide in what it will cover, as the amortization is also universal.\nNo private plan can boast of a plan that fits a Gaussian curve ...\nand as our private sector has discovered, they're better off not\noffering insurance coverage that their customers are going to use.\n(-;\n\n\nThe alternative to the system is no system at all (patients opted out,\ndoctors opted out, or both).  But that only for insurance ... and you\ncan't force a private insurance company to sell you a plan that they\nwill not offer.  And remember that the actual health care is delivered\nby private entities who collect from the public insurance voluntarily.\nAgain, they can't force a private entity to spring to life to pay them.\n\nPlus, there is the matter of culture and values ... I'm basically\nanti-tax and anti-government, by Canadian standards ... yet I can't\nbring myself to make the same arguments as you do, despite that I\nunderstand where you're coming from.  Up north, you're so much more\nlikely to find someone protesting taxes going to defence than health\ninsurance premiums to only one fund for basic coverage ...\n\n\nYes, primarily in Quebec and in Alberta.  Sorry, I musta lost you in\nthat verbose blurb ...\n\n\nIn Canada and Germany, it's not mandatory.  However, it is negative\noption in that you must request the exemption.  That the private\nsector will not provide private basic coverage if offered the option\n(as in the Quebec case) tells me something about what they know ...\n\n\nYes, but part of the reason is that our most of our markets are\ntoo small to sustain many specialists, sometimes not even one, so\nyou pretty well have to be a GP to get paid.  And if you do get\nthe training, the doctors monopoly might block your getting of a\nlicence because there is already someone in the business and who\ncannot fill his/her appointment book.  That we have a CMA doctors\nmonopoly is something that the American AMA-oriented medical lobby\nNEVER tells you down here ...\n\n\nNo, I respect people who do specialties (okay, all of my MD friends\nare (-;) but there's the question of our small market dynamics up\nnorth ... if anything, that our private doctors and hospitals sell\ntheir services to Americans to generate more business will inflate\ntheir effective population served, and thus make some specialties\nfinally viable (i.e., there will be enough customers).  We just do\nnot have enough sick Canadians in absolute numbers otherwise.\n\n\nUh ... Germany basically uses our method, with their many sickness\nfunds.  The competition is fake if it exists at all, because they're\nall interlinked.  Look in Der Spiegel or Stern (my girlfriend is in\nour German department  and her uncle is a private practicioner in\nSaarbrucken) ... no ads for health insurance.  While Canada organizes\nby province, Germany organizes the paperwork around big corporations\nand regional offices.   But remember that we have provinces that have\nthe same population as some major German corporations.  Germans have\npublic health insurance, just that it is brokered by smaller entities\n(actually, brokerage of basic by private firms who'll sell extra\ninsurance to fill out their policies, sort of a voucher system,\nwas one of the first ideas floated in Canada, too).\n\nRemember, the Germans don't have HMO's ... a telling sign, 'cos\nRochester does and they're also a company town.\n\n\nI'll have to let a Canadian MD jump in to verify that claim, but\nI've come to learn to suspect anything in the American press about\nour "system".  If much or some of it were true, you'd have to take\nus for idiots for tolerating it.  And given that our insurance was\ninstalled during a period when there were only Liberal and Tory\ngovernments federally and provincially, and the socialists are still\nchafing, they would've pressed for real socialized medicine to fix\nthings ... think about it.  After all, we are using the U.S. as a\nmetric to make comparison ... both for keeping-up-with-the-Joneses\nas for confirming that we did something right.\n\ngld
Watch the videotape carefully, the CNN coverage was fairly decisive.\n\nThe first fire starts in the Tower, this is three storeys high and there\nis a flag to the right of it on the picture. The second fire starts \nin another tower which is similar to the first only two storeys high.\nThe flag is on the left in the camera picture that shows this fire\nstarting.\n\nThus the camera pictures cleraly show the fire starting at two separate\nlocations. The FBI report a third. I was not able to verify it from the\nvideotape however someone else identified a fire shown to be starting behind\nthe small tower in the second (flag on left) camera angle.\n\n\nThe flames coming out of the building are yellow/orange. This is the\nnormal colour for carbon compounds burning. The flames were those of a \nsolid or confined liquid burning, not of a gas exploding. \n\n\nThe explosion that occurs mid way along the building is certainly not an\nexplosive though. The cloud itself is on fire. This would seem to\nbe most likely to be some sort of fuel oil store exploding rather than\nthe explosion of a magazine.\n\n\n\nDepends entirely on how they were distributed. You would not be able\nto identify ammunition rounds going off from video camera coverage\nfrom a mile away. If and when the FBI release pictures from cmeras\non the armoured vehicles (which presumably exist) it might be possible to \nget a clearer picture. \n\nIf anyone expects to see explosions hollywood style aka Rambo movies then\nremember that in real life cars do not burst into flames when going over cliffs.\n\nJust about the most you could expect would be to see the grenades\ngoing off. Since the building was designed to be blast proof to some\nextent it would be difficult to distinguish the grenades going off from\nthe collapse of the building due to the fire.\n\n\n\nParanoia.\n\n\nYou wouldn't beleive the FBI if they showed you a picture of Koresh himself\nsetting light to the place. Your mindset is such that you are simply\nunable to accept as true anything that might suggest that a group of\nheavily armed weapons fanatics might indeed be in the wrong.\n\nThe gun lobby can't accept that the B-D set light to the place because\nthat would mean that Koreh had murdered 17 children, that would mean that\ntheir taking his account of the murder of 4 BATF agents would be even\nless credible than it was to start with.\n\nKoresh had 51 days to come out with his hands up and face a fair trial. \nInstead he ordered the murder of everyone in the place.

But at the same time, the University of Denver study points \n:   out, quite dramatically, that 60% of all self-identifying gay men have \n: > had some form of heterosexual contact in the past year. \n: \n: I think the big mistake in that study must be that if one had had no sexual \n: contact of any kind in the previous year, they are counted as heterosexual.\n: Even if they didn't intend it that way, that's how the figures are being used.\n\nCould someone please post some date such as what questonnares where used\nand how they were distributed and returned.\n\n--

In a debate about the student government here at our university, a\nquestion was raised by one student senator:  \n\n"Why should I represent people who didn't vote?"\n\nand by implication, this raises a different question:\n\n"Why should I represent people who didn't vote for me?"\n\nI feel that there are many good reasons that anyone elected to public\noffice (in student government or any other government) should strive\nto represent ALL the people in their constituency (class of '95 or a\ngeographical area, or whatever).  \n\nI would like some help from others in phrasing a reasonable argument\non this topic.  Thanks.\n\nFollowups are directed to talk.politics.misc, but email is preferred.
The arrest of Noriega did not have any major adverse effect on the\ndrug trade going through Panama. Money laundering continues to be\nPanama's main industry. In fact, it is bigger now than before Noriega\nwas arrested [1]. Panama's current administration also has ties with\nthe Colombian cocaine cartels [2]. And large amounts cocaine still\nflow through Panama on a regular basis [3].\n\nOh well...\n\nSources (from the book _Drugs in America_ by Vincent Bugliosi):\n[1] IRS Criminal Investigations Divison\n[2] _New York Times_\n[3] U.S. State Department

Good point, Brett.  It might merely be proof that basic health care\nmarkets operate differently, with certain nonmarket phenomenom that\nthe private sector can't handle well (like armies vs. warlords). In\nthat respect, the effects on American society vs. Canadian/European\nsociety might also be different.\n\n\nGood point again.  Blue Cross in the U.S. is quite convoluted compared\nto the Canadian and German insurance funds, which have a minimal\norganization to coordinate it.  If anything, bureaucracy now needs to\nbe built up in Canada to combat fraud, such as Americans crossing the\nborder individually to use insurance cards borrowed from friends and\nrelatives or using phony domestic addresses, or fraud rings stealing\nthem in blocks.  Our private practices are now recording insurance\naccount numbers, both public insurance and private insurance, which\nmost have never bothered to do before on assumption of an honour \nsystem.\n\ngld
From article <C5n90x.EsJ@murdoch.acc.Virginia.EDU>, by gsh7w@fermi.clas.Virginia.EDU (Greg Hennessy):\n\n\n\nReally?  I thought that insurance companies hired all of\ntheir actuarial staffs to determine the risks correlated\nwith all groups of people, and that gays are more likely\nto have AIDS than are those of other sexual orientations.\nIf I am wrong about this correlation, please correct me.\n\nMy auto insurance company charges me up the wazoo because\nI am a young male with a very high performance car.  I\nalways thought that this was based on NHTSA and other\nstatistical data, rather than bigotry and hatred for young\nmen with fast cars.  Of course, with the proper government\nintervention, we could force the insurance companies to\npretend that young men with fast cars are just the same\nas everyone else...
THE WHITE HOUSE\n\n                    Office of the Press Secretary\n_____________________________________________________________________\nFor Immediate Release                                  April 20, 1993\n\n\n                            PRESS BRIEFING\n                           BY DEE DEE MYERS\n\n                          The Briefing Room\n\n\n9:47 A.M. EDT\n	     \n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Okay, today's schedule.  As you know, the \nPresident jogged this morning with Senator Wofford.  \n	     \n	     At 1:15 p.m., he will have a photo opportunity in the \nRose Garden to present the Teacher of the Year Award.  At 1:30 p.m., \nhe will meet with his principal advisors on Bosnia.  And at 5:00 \np.m., he'll meet with President Vaclav Havel.  There will be a photo \nop at the top of that meeting; no formal press conference afterwards.\n	     \n	     Any questions?\n	     \n	     Q	  Is he moving towards some major decision this week \non Bosnia?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  As we've said, he's continuing to discuss \nhis options.  He's been talking extensively with his foreign policy \nadvisors, his Bosnia advisors, as well as with other world leaders.  \nHe'll try to contact President Mitterrand again today, and he'll \ncontinue to discuss it.  We don't have any specific timetable, but \nobviously the situation there is very serious.\n	     \n	     Q	  Has he called Janet Reno today or yesterday?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe he's spoken to her today.\n	     \n	     Q	  Why does he have nothing to say about this publicly \nexcept on the piece of paper that was put out last night at 6:40 \np.m.?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  He did.  He answered a question about it \nyesterday.\n	     \n	     Q	  Before anything had happened.\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Before anything happened.  He put out --\n	     \n	     Q	  Since something has happened he's had nothing to \nsay.\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  He's put out a statement on it last night.  \nAnd we'll have more to say about it later today.\n	     \n	     Q	  In what forum is that going to be?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  It will be at the photo in the Rose Garden.\n	     \n	     Q	  He will talk about Waco at that?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Yes, he'll have something to say.\n	     \n	     Q	  Is that something we can take live?\n	     \n\n	     MS. MYERS:  I think it will be brief.  We can talk a \nlittle later about the exact structure as we work it out.  But I \ndon't know if it's something you'd want to take live.\n	     \n	     Q	  Will he take questions on Waco at that time as \nwell?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  He'll probably take a few.\n	     \n	     Q	  Is there any reason why he hasn't talked to the \nAttorney General?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I'll have to double-check.  I don't know \nthat he hasn't talked to her this morning.\n	     \n	     Q	  And she didn't come here this morning to see him or \nanyone else?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  No.\n	     \n	     Q	  And he didn't talk yesterday?\n	     \n	     Q	  What's the reaction to her resignation statement \nthat she made last night?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  She was asked a question about it, and she \nanswered the question.  The President has absolutely no intention of \nasking for the Attorney General's resignation.  He stands behind her \n100 percent.  As you know, he was informed about the decision.  He \ntakes full responsibility for that, and stands 100 percent behind \nAttorney General Reno.\n	     \n	     Q	  The question now arises -- yesterday we were told \nthat he was briefed on this, but we never got a firm idea of how much \nhe knew of what the plan was and the justification for the plan and \nthe justification of the timing.  Was he fully informed on all of \nthat, all of this about the increasing levels of violence inside the \ncompound that made them want to go now, the feeling that nothing else \nwas going to succeed, et cetera?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  He talked with the Attorney General about \nthe decision, about -- she talked to him about the factors that led \nto her decision.  He raised no objections.  He supports her decision \nto go forward with it.  He was fully briefed.\n	     \n	     Q	  Of course, hindsight is 20-20, but looking back \nnow, does the President, does the White House feel that the decision \nhe signed off on proved to be the right way to go when you look at \nwhat actually happened?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I think everybody feels bad when life is \nlost.  But I don't think that that is reason to second-guess the \ndecision.  He stands behind the decision that was made.  He was \ninformed about it.  He was fully briefed about it and he stands 100 \npercent behind the Attorney General, the Justice Department and the \nFBI.  It's a difficult operation and there's -- it had already gone \non for more than seven weeks.  Four federal agents had lost their \nlives in the line of duty -- let's not forget that.  \n	     \n	     This was a very difficult situation and all the \ndecisions involved were very difficult.  But all the agents on the \nground, the FBI, the Justice Department all recommended moving \nforward with this.  They thought, given the circumstances, it was the \nbest possible course of action.  There's just no point in second-\nguessing those decisions.  Now, I think that there's a reason --\n	     \n	     Q	  Why not?  They have to --\n	     \n\n	     MS. MYERS:  No, not to second-guess the decisions.  I \nthink it's important to take a look at it, to have an investigation.  \nI think the President will talk some about that later today.  But at \nthis -- from this vantage point, to second-guess those decisions, \nit's not useful.\n	     \n	     Q	  You sound like he's going to order an investigation \nof what happened and whether --\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I think he'll have more to say about that \nlater, yes.\n	     \n	     Q	  He will order an investigation?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  He'll have more -- yes -- he'll have more to \nsay about an investigation.\n	     \n	     Q	  What kind of investigation?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  He'll have more to say about it later.\n	     \n	     Q	  But in the Monday morning quarterbacking, surely \nthere is some soul-searching now as to whether it was the right \ndecision.  You can't say that we did the best we could when it turned \nout to be a rather -- a debacle.\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:   I think we'll -- obviously, we'll review \nthe situation and all the factors that lead to a very tragic outcome.  \nI don't think anybody disputes that the outcome was tragic.  But, \nagain, the President stands behind the decisions that were made and \nwe'll take a look at the factors that contributed to that.\n	     \n	     Q	  What was the FBI Director's role in this?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Well, he was obviously involved in setting \nup the operation.  He signed off on it, as did the agents that were \non the ground that were working with him.  I don't believe he spoke \nto the President, but I'll double-check that.\n	     \n	     Q	  But he was very closely involved in every aspect of \nplanning and so forth?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I would refer you to the FBI on exactly what \naspects he was involved with.\n	     \n	     Q	  Will Janet Reno be coming over to the White House \ntoday?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  There's no planned meeting.  I don't believe \nthat she'll be here.\n	     \n	     Q	  She won't be at this event at 1:15 p.m.?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  No, no plans to be.\n	     \n	     Q	  Do you think that there's going to be a jumping on \non the part of political opposition to make something out of this in \nterms of -- to the President's detriment politically?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Well, I would certainly hope that people \nwouldn't try to use this tragedy for political reasons.  Obviously, I \nthink, again, that it's useful to look at the facts, to reevaluate \nthe facts, and I think the President will move forward with that.  \nBut I think people understand that this was a difficult series of \ndecisions; that it was a very difficult situation; that it was caused \nby a man who was a cult leader who was involved in the death of four \nfederal agents.   And I think it's most tragic that a lot of innocent \n\nchildren lost their lives in this.  I don't think anybody disputes \nthe tragedy of the outcome.\n	     \n	     Q	  Dee Dee, what was the White House role in handling \nthe, I guess, public relations aspect  in the aftermath?  Who was \ntalking -- who here at the White House was talking with people at \nJustice to set up Reno's news conference, to do all that sort of \nthing?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I think the Attorney General handled her end \nof the situation herself and made the decision to go ahead with the \nnews conference once there was a point at which there was enough \ninformation, I think, to talk with some accuracy about what had \ntranspired during the day.  Obviously, people here at a number of \nlevels were keeping in touch with people at the Justice Department \nand at the FBI to try to keep informed about what was happening \nthere.\n	     \n	     Q	  But Reno said that she didn't talk to the \nPresident, and there seemed to be an indication she hadn't talked to \nanybody at the White House.  So who --\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  There were people talking on a staff-to-\nstaff level.\n	     \n	     Q	  I understand.  But who at the Justice Department \nwas handling that for Reno?  Who was talking to the White House?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  There were a number of people.  As you know, \nWebb Hubbell is the liaison to the White House, and I know he talked \nto a number of people here.  There were a number of people at a \nnumber of different levels involved.  I don't want to get into \nexactly who had what conversations with whom, but there were a number \nof conversations.  Obviously, the Justice Department was working to \nkeep the White House informed, the press informed to the best of its \nability as events unfolded throughout the day.\n	     \n	     Q	  Did Webb Hubbell talk to the President?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.  I don't know if he \ntalked -- he may have at one point.\n	     \n	     Q	  And was the White House role just to seek \ninformation about what happened, or was it to direct the public \ninformation campaign that followed?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  It was both to keep abreast of the situation \nso the President could be on top of it, but I think the Justice \nDepartment managed its press relations on it.  We were obviously very \ninterested in what was happening there throughout the day, and the \nPresident was following it very closely throughout the day.\n	     \n	     Q	  Dee Dee, on that, though, if the President was \nfollowing it so closely and he had talked the night before with Janet \nReno, why wouldn't he talk to her at all since then?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Again, I don't know if he's talked to her \nthis morning.  Again, he's kept fully aware of what has been going on \nthroughout the day.  He stands 100 percent behind her decisions.  \nHe's been fully supportive of her, as he said yesterday morning \nbefore events transpired and yesterday afternoon in a written \nstatement.\n	     \n	     Q	  But wouldn't he want to convey those thoughts to \nher personally yesterday?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  One more time, I don't know if they've \nspoken this morning.\n\n	     \n	     Q	  No, yesterday.\n	     \n	     Q	  Clearly there's a perception that she was left hung \nout to dry all day yesterday.\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  That's just not true.  I think we said \nthroughout the day that the President takes full responsibility, that \nhe stands -- I don't know how much clearer we can be.  The President \nstands foursquare behind the Attorney General on this.  He accepts \nfull responsibility for the events that transpired.  He believes that \nJanet Reno, the Justice Department, and the FBI acted as best they \ncould, given the circumstances and the facts that were evident at the \ntime.  I don't know what else he can say to show that he supports her \n1,000 percent.\n	     \n	     Q	  One of the best indications of that is to pick up \nthe phone and tell her.\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Again, I don't know whether they've spoken \nthis morning.\n	     \n	     Q	  Why can't we find out?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Well, we can.  I can't do it standing here \nright now.\n	     \n	     Q	  You've got six people here.  All they've got to do \nis pick up the phone.\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Helen, we'll get back to you.\n	     \n	     Q	  Dee Dee, when the President spoke with the Attorney \nGeneral on Sunday, is it safe to assume that either she volunteered \nor he inquired about whether there was a possible downside to \nincreasing pressure on the Davidians?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I think that they discussed the situation.  \nAgain, I'm not going to get into the specific details of what exactly \nshe told him, but I think that he was aware of the risks involved.\n	     \n	     Q	  Dee Dee, the President yesterday morning said it \nwas entirely her decision.  She then said that she told him what was \nhappening and he said, okay.  Does the President regard it that he \ngave the go-ahead or that she gave the go-ahead?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I think what they both said yesterday was \nthat she made a decision based on all the available facts.  She \ninformed him about that and he raised no objections.  Again, I don't \nknow how much clearer we can be about that.\n	     \n	     Q	  And he said, okay.  The issue is over the \nresponsibility.\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  He said, okay.\n	     \n	     Q	   Does okay mean --\n\n	     MS. MYERS:  The President accepts ultimate \nresponsibility.\n	     \n	     Q	  Dee Dee, the President's investigation that he's \ngoing to announce -- would that be conducted by someone outside the \nadministration?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  No.\n	     \n\n	     Q	  It would be internal -- is it meant to preclude any \ncongressional investigation?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  No, it's meant simply to follow up on the \nincidents that occurred yesterday.\n	     \n	     Q	  And you would, I assume, therefore, cooperate fully \nwith any congressional hearings that would be held?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  To the best of our ability.\n	     \n	     Q	  Dee Dee, there are two reports out this morning.  \nOne that the Justice Department, or FBI, or whomever, apparently had \na bug planted inside the complex.  And the other is that the children \nmay have been injected with some kind of poison that may have either \nleft them unconscious or maybe even killed them before the fire.  \nWhat do you know about those two --\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Nothing more than I've seen in news accounts \nthis morning.  We may get more on it later, but at this point, I know \n-- I'm not sure anybody knows any more than what was reported by \npeople who came out of the compound.\n	     \n	     Q	  Has the President received any report today in \nterms of fatalities and actually what was going on -- what they've \nbeen able to find out on in the compound now?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  He's been briefed.  I don't think that \nthey've gotten into the compound yet.  They were still waiting for it \nto cool off.  I don't think there's much beyond what's been reported \nin the news accounts.  But he has been kept up-to-date on it.\n	     \n	     Q	  Dee Dee, the President stands behind Attorney \nGeneral Reno, but does he feel that she perhaps got bad advice from \nthe so-called experts?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  He believes that she made -- he stands \nbehind the decision that she made.  It was the unanimous decision of \nher advisors, of the FBI, of the agents on the ground, and he \nsupports that.\n	     \n	     Q	  What about the validity of the decisions made on \nthe ground?  Does he back those --\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  He's not going to second-guess decisions \nmade.\n	     \n	     Q	  Dee Dee, you just said, he stands behind the \ndecision which she made.  Normally, in a situation like this, the \nPresident says, I  made the decision.  But you're saying she made the \ndecision?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I'm saying that the President was briefed \nabout the decision.  He okayed it and he accepts full responsibility \nfor it.\n	     \n	     Q	  But then why do you keep using the terminology, the \ndecision that she made, rather than the decision that he made --\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Because, as he said yesterday, she evaluated \nthe facts based on evidence presented to her by Justice Department \nand FBI, which is part of the Justice Department, and made a decision \nand then briefed the President on that decision.  That is how the \nchain of command works.  She briefed him.  He signed off on it.  The \noperation went forward, and the President accepts full \nresponsibility.\n	     \n\n	     Q	  In that chain of command analogy there, I want to \ngo back to Sessions a moment.  Do you know if this was a plan that \ncame through him to Reno, or was it presented to her around him or \nwith his involvement?  What was his involvement?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Again, you'd have to go to the Justice \nDepartment for the specific interaction between the Attorney General \nand the Director.\n	     \n	     Q	  Does the President stand behind Director Sessions?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  He supports -- again, I don't know how many \ndifferent ways I can say this -- he supports the decisions made by \nthe Justice Department and the FBI.  He fully supports the Attorney \nGeneral in this.  I'm not stepping away from the Director of the FBI, \nI want to -- but Janet Reno is the one who briefed him, the one who \nmade the decisions as the head of the Justice Department.  As you \nknow, the Director of the FBI reports to the Attorney General.  The \nAttorney General made the decision.  She informed the President about \nthose decisions.  He okayed it.  He didn't raise any objections to \nit, and he accepts full responsibility.\n	     \n	     Q	  Do you have, based on what you know here at the \nWhite House, any concerns about William Sessions' performance during \nthis --\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Nothing to suggest that, no.\n	     \n	     Q	  Along those same lines, just in your initial review \nof the situation, how much do you think the problems might have come \nfrom not having a Justice Department that's fully staffed and having \nan FBI Director who is still quite uncertain about his status?    \n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I just don't think that had anything to do \nwith it.  I think the agents on the ground -- the operation went \nforward.  I'm not going to speculate on that.\n	     \n	     Q	  Did the White House express any alarm that Janet \nReno chose to speak to the live network media before she chose to \nspeak to Clinton?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:   No.  She was carrying forward her \nresponsibility to inform the public about the events of yesterday.  I \nthink she did a very admirable job.  The President agrees with that.\n	     \n	     Q	  Before Sunday, how often was the President briefed \non the situation in Waco?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  He was kept updated on a regular basis, on a \ndaily basis.\n	     \n	     Q	  Who briefed the President?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Well, I'm not going to get into exactly who, \nwhat conversations he had with whom, but he was kept up-to-date on \nthe events in Waco.  He has daily briefings on a number of issues.\n	     \n	     Q	  No, no, was this a regular briefing conducted by a \nWhite House staff person, or was it by a Justice Department person?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  He's briefed regularly by a White House \nstaff on a number of issues.  Again, I'm not going to get into \nexactly who briefs him on what subjects.\n	     \n	     Q	  Another subject?\n	     \n	     Q	  On another subject.\n	     \n\n	     \n	     Q	  Now we're going to do gays in the military.  \n(Laughter.)\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I welcome it.\n	     \n	     Q	  How close are you to signing the biodiversity \ntreaty?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  As you know, the President's giving a speech \non Earth Day tomorrow.  We'll have more to say about it then.\n	     \n	     Q	  Any details on where or when that speech is yet?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  It's at 11:30 a.m. and I don't know where \nyet.\n	     \n	     Q	  Dee Dee, is this a major policy address?  How would \nyou characterize the speech tomorrow?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I would characterize it as a Earth Day \nspeech.  I wouldn't look for any major departures from his past \npositions on these things.  But, again, I don't want to get too much \ninto what he's going to talk about tomorrow.\n	     \n	     Q	  On or off campus?\n	     \n	     Q	  Is this at a location outside the White House?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  It will be somewhere in Washington.  We \ndon't know exactly where yet.\n	     \n	     Q	  Dee Dee, what foreign leaders has the President \ntalked to since Friday on the situation in Bosnia? \n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Only Prime Minister Major.  And again, he'll \ntry to reach President Mitterrand again this morning.\n	     \n	     Q	  David Owen said yesterday and Joe Biden said today \n-- both of them agree that the peace process is not going to work, \nthat the Serbs are not going to sign on.  Does the administration \nstill believe that it can work and that they will sign on?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Obviously, the ultimate goal is some sort of \npeaceful resolution to the conflict in Bosnia.  As you know, the \nadministration is considering a wide variety of options at this \npoint.  The situation there in and around Srebrenica and the rest of \nEastern Bosnia is quite serious.  And the President will meet with \nhis Bosnian advisors today and continue to press forward on this.\n	     \n	     Q	  Is that a question they're going to try to be \ndeciding whether or not the peace plan remains viable?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Again, they'll be reviewing a number of \noptions, including the peace plan.\n	     \n	     Q	  Does the group that he's meeting with today include \nReg Bartholomew?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe he's here.  But it will be \namong the usual -- Secretary Christopher, Secretary Aspin, General \nPowell.\n	     \n	     Q	  Dee Dee, do you have anything on the apparent \nencounter by U.S. F-15s over Bosnia today -- some aircraft violating \nthe no-fly zone?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  No, I don't.  I'll get back to you on that.\n\n	     \n	     Q	  Will the President be meeting with every one of the \nleaders coming to town for the Holocaust Museum?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  He will.  He'll be meeting, as you know, \nwith Vaclav Havel today and with Lech Walesa tomorrow, and then with \nthe rest of the group tomorrow afternoon.\n	     \n	     Q	  As a group, or one by one?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I believe it's as a group.  Now, Havel and \nWalesa asked for meetings early and these have been on the agenda for \nquite some time.  But he will meet with all of the foreign heads of \nstate that are here.\n	     \n	     Q	  Dee Dee, has the President decided whether he \nsupports the gay and lesbian civil rights act?  And has anything been \nworked out for him to address the march on Sunday?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I think he'll probably have a letter or some \nkind of a statement to the march.  We haven't worked out the exact \ndetails of that.\n	     \n	     Q	  Not a live phone hook-up?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Probably not, given the logistics of getting \nto Boston.  The speech, as you know, is at 4:00 p.m.  The answer to \nthe other part of your question is, no, he hasn't taken a position on \nit.\n	     \n	     Q	  You said that speech in Boston was at 4:00 p.m.?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I believe so, yes.\n	     \n	     Q	  Do you know what it's on?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  We'll still working out --\n	     \n	     Q	  General Vessey's coming back tonight from Vietnam.  \nWhen will he be meeting with the President?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  No specific meeting is scheduled.  We'll \ntalk to him at some point and see.  We look forward to his report, \nbut exactly how he'll make that report is unclear.\n	     \n	     Q	  So he's not going to come immediately to the White \nHouse?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  No.\n	     \n	     Q	  The AIDS czar -- how close are you?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Still working on it.\n	     \n	     Q	  Drug czar?\n	     \n	     Q	  Do you expect it before the march?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I don't have a time line on it.\n	     \n	     Q	  Did the President ask Senator Mitchell to try the \nLloyd Cutler ploy to break the filibuster?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.\n	     \n	     Q	  Why not?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  He's just not going to.\n\n	     \n	     Q	  Are Senate Democrats here at this hour?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  No, that's tomorrow -- tomorrow at 9:30 a.m.\n	     \n	     Q	  Update on the stimulus, possible scaling down --\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  As you know, the Senate will vote on \namendments today.  We'll continue to talk.  The President is \ncommitted to some kind of a jobs package; we'd like to see it passed.  \nAnd we'll continue in conversations throughout the day and see where \nwe end up.\n	     \n	     Q	  When this briefing is over can you give us word \nthrough the speaker or whatever whether the President's talked to \nJanet Reno?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  We'll be happy to.\n	     \n	     Q	  It's become a pressing question for the last \nseveral hours.\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  No, just this minute that I've been here, \nand I haven't had a chance to follow up on it, Helen.\n	     \n	     Q	  Does he have an opinion on Hatfield?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I mean, obviously, he prefers -- he offered \na compromise package of $12.2 billion.  He believes that that's the \nbest alternative, believes that he's obviously willing to take a \nsecond look at the package.  And I think the Senate will vote on that \ntoday, and we're hopeful that the President's bill, which will be the \nMitchell amendment, will be the one that will be approved.\n	     \n	     Q	  Dee Dee, is there any White House official that \nwill be at the march on Sunday?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Somebody will be there representing the \nPresident.  I don't know who yet.\n	     \n	     Q	  Well, has it been decided how he's going to \naddress?  Is it going to be a videotape or a phone call?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I think it will probably be a letter, but \nthere hasn't been a final decision on that yet.\n	     \n	     Q	  The official will read the letter, is that what it \nsounds like?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\n	     \n	     Q	  Lloyd Bentsen came in here this morning.  Do you \nknow what was that about?  Was that about this Waco thing?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  No, actually it wasn't.  It may have come \nup, but it was about economic issues.\n	     \n	     Q	  On health care -- is the 17th of May still the \ntarget?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  That's still the target.\n	     \n	     Q	  And there's talk about a Joint Session of Congress \nspeech at the end of May --\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  We haven't resolved exactly how the \nPresident will present the health care plan to the people.  I \nwouldn't rule that out as an option, but no decisions have been made.
A person sees the front of their home is strewn with garbage. That\nperson removes the trash, and sweeps the sidewalk. His next door neigh-\nbors have not. The person then approaches his two neighbors and talks\nto them about cleaning the front of their homes, and why it would be\ngood for their own living conditions, and that of the neighborhood.\n   There's nothing wrong with holding your neighbors accountable for\ntheir actions. That is the basis for a viable, safe community.\n\nRegards,
No Cramer it does not.  In this instance you are telling porkies to\n*yourself* as well as everyone else.  Haven't you ever been to a\ncafe or restaurant and been absalutely stuffed full of goodies and yet\nwhen one more item, just a little different, with a new texture and\na new taste, was presented you *somehow* found the space for it.\n\nMaybe you haven't, so what?  It is a widely reported phenomina and\nI reckon the same applies to sex.
If true, and if gays were the same as straights except\nfor sexual preference, I would imagine that gays would\nhave much less sex than straights because the available\npool for dates is less than one-tenth what it is for\nstraights.  Somebody correct (flame) me please!
"Personal gain": for his own monetary advantage.  I don't think\nanyone would dispute that he both violated his oath of office, and\nabused his powers.  But that's not for personal gain.
Wait a second, you're ignoring major facts here.\n\nThere was NO attempt to simply serve a warrant. The BATF had a\nno-knock warrant. The initial firefight began when the BATF threw\nconcussion grenades at the building. (BATF admits this!)\n\n\nLet's be realistic here, shall we?\n\nYou're a member of a rather paranoid religious organization. Someone\ncomes to your building, dressed in black suits, carrying firearms.\nThey throw a concussion grenade at the place, and try to break in.\nWhat, exactly, are you going to do?\n\nI would not allow anyone to enter my home without first identifying\nthemselves. If someone attacks my home by firing weapons or throwing\nexplosive, I think I'd be entirely justified in defending myself.\n\nRegardless of what I think of the BDs, and regardless of whether or\nnot they were guilty of firearms violations, this is NOT the way you\ntreat people in a supposedly free society.\n\n	<MC>
+>Can people please stop the 'I think/know the BATF/FBI are completely\n+>responsible but they'll cover it up so that the investigation will\n+>show that Koresch is responsible' bs. In an investigation of this\n+>size with the feds, state, and civilians involved in the\n+>investigation it would be practially impossible to cover up.\n\n	The place has burned to the ground.  The FBI and company\nhave the whole area cordoned off and have already arrested \nreporters for being at the site and taking pictures.\n\n	All your going to get in terms of a story is what the FBI, ATF\nand the Texas Rangers decide to release.  \n\n\n\n+>And with Republicans like Arlen Spector calling for investigations,\n+>this isn't going to be handled with kid gloves.\n \n	When the Philadephia cops dropped their bomb on MOVE and\nmanaged to burn down an entire neighborhood many people said \nthe same thing.  Dead men and rubble tell no tales that the\npolice dont want them to tell.
What's despicable is that this sordid incident is being glommed onto by all\nsorts of people desperately trying to "get a revolution." It makes\n"ambulance chasing" by lawyers seem like a harmless pastime.\n\nFor the last few months, benighted souls have been calling C-SPAN on issues\nas mundane as budget resolutions, saying that "I don't know, I just have\nthe feeling there is going to be a revolution in this country," and so on.\n\nGet real! For a real case study in revolution, go to Blockbuster Video\nand check out "Underground," a film made about the Weather Underground in\nthe 70's. Even with all the strife back then, the "revolution" never did\ncome. And Waco is supposed to be the spark of the end times?\n\nIn the tape, it is interesting to see the way the Weatherpersons dance\naround the issue of one of their defining moments, which was when a few\nof their comrades managed to blow themselves up manufacturing bombs in\na Greenwich village townhouse. The problem, one of them said, was that\nthey were so caught up in their armed struggle that they *forgot* about\ntheir own personal safety and weren't "careful." But of course that was\n*society's* fault, a society that didn't instill a sense of worth in\nthe people, so they neglect their own safety.\n\nCurrent apologists for Koresh may pick up some important rationalization\ntips from this tape!
How wrong you will be.  I participated in the last National March on  \nWashington (MOW) for LesGayBi rights (Oct 11, 1987) - with a turnout of  \nabout 750,000 people - and we didn't have alot pissing us off at the time.   \nThe big issue was the AIDS crisis, but we weren't being slapped around  \nquite as bad as we are now.  This time its AIDS, and Equal Rights,  and  \nthe Military Squabble.  And this MOW has been in the planning for YEARS  \nwhereas the last one was pulled together in a relatively short time.  The  \nlast MOW was the largest ever on D.C. and you can bet we are going to  \nexceed that by a long shot.  I truly believe we will exceed the 1.0  \nmillion goal the MOW committee has always had set for this event.
Local media hasn't said much, if anything, about the MOW.  Also, when\nI called a straight friend in Arlington to tell him I would be on his\ndoorstep this weekend, he didn't know anything at all about the march.\nThis is a gay-sympathetic person who notices things like this.  I\nthought it was strange that he was unaware of what was happening.  It\nmade me wonder just how much coverage is getting to "mainstream" America.
Is anyone out there knowledgeable on drug issues in Japan?  I'm interested\nin knowing if Japan has or has ever had a problem with drugs, and how they\ndealt with it.  I've heard, undocumented, that Japan years ago used heavy\nlegal penalties to end a serious heroin problem.  I'd like to know both\nsides of the story.  Does anyone recall such a problem?  What were laws\nat the time relating to drug use, drug dealing, and drug trafficking?  What\nare the laws now?  What other anti-drug measures, like education and treatment\nhas Japan used?  How are drugs regarded by the Japanese people?  How effective\nhave anti-drug measures been in Japan?  Thanks for your help.
After the initial gun battle was over, they had 50 days to come out\npeacefully. They had their high priced lawyer, and judging by the\nposts here they had some public support. Can anyone come up\nwith a rational explanation why the didn't come out (even after\nthey negotiated coming out after the radio sermon) that doesn't\ninclude the Davidians wanting to commit suicide/murder/general mayhem?
Say WHAT?  Surrounding the compound with armed men and throwing\ngrenades isn't a provocation?\n\n\nYou're smoking something not legal in the US.  They never rang the\ndoorbell.  Not even the BATF has claimed that they have. This was a\nno-knock search.\n\nAs to the good reason the BATF has-- the warrant and supporting\naffadavit have not been made public.
That has not been demonstrated.  Had he come to trial, there was a very real\npossibility that Koresh would have gotten an acquittal on grounds of self-\ndefense.  All survivors of the debacle have sworn that the BATF shot first.\n\n\nThey "rang the doorbell" using a concussion grenade!  And if the bloody\nwarrants were "legal" then why were they _sealed_ after the fight started?\nAnd if Koresh had declared himself a "private state" and was just daring the\ngov't to go in, then why did he surrender last year to a local sheriff who\nserved a warrant _for_his_arrest_ (as opposed to the BATF search warrant,\nwhich did not include arrest unless violations were found) by just calling\nhim up to tell him and then going out to collect him with his squad car?\nThat doesn't sound like a dictator to me, it sounds like someone who knows\nhe has a court battle.  Things might have gone very differently if the BATF\n_had_ "rung the doorbell".\n\n\nThis is stupid.  That is no paranoid assertion, it is testamony from surviving\nwitnesses, and the BATF _has_ no tanks, nor am I aware of either the BATF _or_\nthe FBI using any until yesterday.  When they use maximum force they do just\nwhat they did that first day that got four officers killed.\n\n\n"Underarmed"?  You flabberghast me, they were loaded for bear and every\npicture shows them wearing bullet-proof vests!  They were using concussion\ngrenades and full-auto weapons, what was missing low-yield tac-nukes?  This\nis a transparent attempt to retcon a justification for the ridiculous amount\nof force used, both initially and yesterday.  You should be ashamed.\n\n\nThey _had_ a sure-fire method: keep them bottled up and talk them to death or\nsurrender without giving him justification for some looney-tune religious\nstunt.\n\nPhil, I've been reading your postings for months and I'm convinced that you\nwill back anything, no matter how damaging it may be to yours or anyone\nelse's rights if you think it will hurt people you don't like.  It's people\nwith that attitude that set up the preconditions for the Holocaust, a process\nthat is in place _now_ in this country, even if the tattered, pitiful remains\nof the Constitution is slowing its progress.  This isn't a Libertarian issue,\nothers may argue that line, but from a strictly Constitutional view of a\ndemocratic gov't, what the FBI and BATF did was wrong, wrong, wrong, even if\ntheir _reasons_ for trying to arrest Koresh were 100% right.  _Anything_ that\nleads to the deaths of 17 children, if nothing else touches your stoney\nheart, is _wrong_ no matter who pushed the button.  For God's sake, man, get\nyour morality back.\n\nLarry Smith (smith@ctron.com)  No, I don't speak for Cabletron.  Need you ask?

But the "values and systems that make the rich rich" all basically\n  amount to freedom of choice. \n\n  In New England in 1800 the entire economy was based on the small family\n  farm.   Farm economy households were economically diversified, producing\n  not only agricultural goods but also "manufactured" goods, especially \n  cloth.  Many farm women carded, spun, and/or wove, producing not only\n  cloth for their own family but also to sell, generating extra income.\n\n  But about this time the Industrial Revolution was underway in England\n  and by the 1820's it had moved to the US, in both cases in the form \n  of textile mills.  These mills could produce cloth far more efficiently\n  and cheaply than people at home.  \n\n  The result was that an important source of home income was wiped out\n  and many of these women were compelled by economic circumstance to \n  go to work in these same mills in Lowell, Mass, or Nashua, NH, where\n  they worked 73 hour weeks in deafening, dangerous conditions, living \n  regimented lives and being exposed to cotton-dust and infectious dis-\n  eases due to the work.\n\n  Now people didn't *HAVE* to buy the cheaper factory-made cloth. \n  They were free to keep buying the home-made variety and support\n  their local economy . . . \n\n\n  . . . but (sorry for the cliche), "it takes two to tango".   The big\n  rich corporations achieved that wealth because we buy their stuff.\n  It used to be the case that the business center of a town was also \n  its social center.  You KNEW the merchants you did business with \n  or even local kids working behind the counter.   You would see\n  people on the street whom you knew and you could stop for a chat.\n\n  Nowadays local merchants are going out of business and people shop \n  at huge anonymous malls serving regional populations of hundreds of\n  thousands or millions.  You have no particular relationship with the\n  companies you do business with, and feel no particular commitment\n  to them, nor they to you.   Major components of what defines a "com-\n  munity" have been destroyed.   On the other hand the products we buy\n  at these malls are a lot cheaper due to economies of scale and foreign\n  manufacture, and they are probably of better, or at least more consistent,\n  quality.\n\n\n\n  Don't blame the conservatives for this.  Everyone makes their own\n  individual choice and the liberals and the fence-sitters are just\n  as guilty of pretending there are no social and cultural consequences\n  to economic choices.
The above statement ignores reality. The BD WERE provoked.\n\n\n\n\n Damn, Phil. You must have seen a different tape of the initial raid than\nI did. Your `doorbell' happened to include lobbing percussion grenades and\nattempting to storm the compound through the windows. I can honestly say\nI have never seen a `doorbell' that works like that.\n\n\n\n\n\n  THINK, man. The BATF are serving a warrant on someone who they feel might\n have illegal automatic weapons. If they expected, as you state, that `the B-D\n to be anything other than peaceful citizens' they could have sent one, maybe \n two agents up to the front door, knock, and attempt to serve the warrant on\n the person answering the door. Scenario one, that person lets them in to \n perform the search and no one gets hurt. Scenario two, the person answering\n the door pulls a weapon aand kills both officers. Now you have two dead BATF\n agents instead of four, the BATF knows exactly where they stand with regards\n to the BD and began to formulate a plan of action to arrest those responsible\n without harm to the innocent people/children within the compound.\n\n\n\n\n No, the stupidity was the attempt to serve the warrant SWAT style.\n\n\n\n\n Sure, do it within the law. The BATF is there to uphold the law, not\n circumvent it to fit their needs.....\n\n\n<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>\n\n Paul R.

THE WHITE HOUSE\n\n                    Office of the Press Secretary\n______________________________________________________________\nFor Immediate Release                             April 23, 1993     \n\n	     \n                  PRESS CONFERENCE BY THE PRESIDENT\n	     \n	     \n                            The East Room \n\n\n1:00 P.M. EDT\n	     \n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  Terry, do you have a question?\n	     \n	     Q	  Mr. President, there's a growing feeling that the \nWestern response to bloodshed in Bosnia has been woefully inadequate.  \nHolocaust survivor Elie Wiesel asked you yesterday to do something, \nanything to stop the fighting.  Is the United States considering \ntaking unilateral action such as air strikes against Serb artillery \nsites?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first let me say, as you know, for \nmore than a week now we have been seriously reviewing our options for \nfurther action.  And I want to say, too, let's look at the last three \nmonths.  Since I became President I have worked with our allies and \nwe have tried to move forward, first on the no-fly zone, on \nenforcement of it, on the humanitarian airdrops, on the war crimes \ninvestigation, on getting the Bosnian Muslims involved in the peace \nprocess.  We have made some progress.  And now we have a very much \ntougher sanctions resolution.  And Leon Fuerth, who is the National \nSecurity Advisor to the Vice President, is in Europe now working on \nimplementing that.  That is going to make a big difference to Serbia.\n	     \n	     And we are reviewing other options.  I think we should \nact.  We should lead -- the United States should lead.  We have led \nfor the last three months.  We have moved the coalition.  And to be \nfair, our allies in Europe have been willing to do their part.  And \nthey have troops on the ground there.\n	     \n	     But I do not think we should act alone, unilaterally, \nnor do I think we will have to.  And in the next several days I think \nwe will finalize the extensive review which has been going on and \nwhich has taken a lot of my time, as well as the time of the \nadministration, as it should have, over the last 10 days or so.  I \nthink we'll finish that in the near future and then we'll have a \npolicy and we'll announce it and everybody can evaluate it.\n	     \n	     Q	  Can I follow up?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  Sure.\n	     \n	     Q	  Do you see any parallel between the ethnic \ncleansing in Bosnia and the Holocaust?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  I think the Holocaust is on a whole \ndifferent level.  I think it is without precedent or peer in human \nhistory.  On the other hand, ethnic cleansing is the kind of \ninhumanity that the Holocaust took to the nth degree.  The idea of \nmoving people around and abusing them and often killing them solely \nbecause of their ethnicity is an abhorrent thing.  And it is \nespecially troublesome in that area where people of different ethnic \ngroups live side by side for so long together.  And I think you have \nto stand up against it.  I think it's wrong.\n	     \n	     We were talking today about all of the other troubles in \nthat region.  I was happy to see the violence between the Croats and \nthe Muslims in Bosnia subside this morning, and I think we're making \nprogress on that front.  But what's going on with the Serbians and \nthe ethnic cleansing is qualitatively different than the other \nconflicts, both within the former Yugoslavia and in other parts of \nthe region.\n	     \n	     Q	  Mr. President, by any count, you have not had a \ngood week in your presidency.  The tragedy in Waco, the defeat of \nyour stimulus bill, the standoff in Bosnia.  What did you do wrong \nand what are you going to do differently?  How do you look at things?  \nAre you reassessing?  (Laughter.)\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  I don't really believe that the \nsituation in Bosnia -- it's not been a good week for the world, but I \ndon't know that the administration could have made it different.\n	     \n	     On the stimulus package, I'd like to put it into the \nlarger context and remind you that in this 100 days we have already \nfundamentally changed the direction of an American government.  We \nhave abandoned trickle-down economics.  We've abandoned the policies \nthat brought the debt of this country from $1 trillion to $4 trillion \nin only a decade.  \n	     \n	     The budget plan, which passed the Congress, which will \nreduce the deficit and increase investment, has led to a 20-year low \nin mortgage rates, dramatically lower interest rates.  There are \nprobably people in this room who have refinanced their home mortgages \nin the last three months, or who have had access to cheaper credit.  \nThat's going to put tens of billion dollars coursing throughout this \neconomy in ways that are very, very good for the country.  And so we \nare moving in the right direction economically.\n	     \n	     I regret that the stimulus did not pass, and I have \nbegun to ask -- and will continue to ask not only people in the \nadministration, but people in the Congress whether there is something \nI could have done differently to pass that.  Part of the reason it \ndidn't pass was politics; part of it was a difference in ideas.  \nThere are really people still who believe that it's not needed.  I \njust disagree with that.  \n	     \n	     I think the recovery -- the economists say it's been \nunderway for about two years, and we've still had 16 months of seven-\npercent unemployment, and all the wealthy countries are having \ntrouble creating jobs.  So I think there was an idea base -- an \nargument there, that while we're waiting for the lower interest rates \nand the deficit reduction and the investments of the next four years \nto take effect, this sort of supplemental appropriation should go \nforward.\n	     \n	     Now, I have to tell you, I did misgauge that because a \nmajority of the Republican senators now sitting in the Senate voted \nfor a similar stimulus when Ronald Reagan was President in 1983, and \nvoted 28 times for regular supplemental appropriations like this.  I \njust misgauged it.  And I hope that I can learn something.  I've just \nbeen here 90 days.  And, you know, I was a Governor working with a \ncontentious legislature for 12 years, and it took me a decade to get \npolitical reform there.  So it takes time  to change things.  But I \nbasically feel very good about what's happened in the first 100 days \nwith regard to the Congress.\n	     \n	     Q	  Waco --\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, with regard to Waco I don't have \nmuch to add to what I've already said.  I think it is a -- I want the \nsituation looked into.  I want us to bring in people who have any \ninsights to bear on that.  I think it's very important that the whole \nthing be thoroughly gone over.  But I still maintain what I said from \nthe beginning, that the offender there was David Koresh.  And I do \nnot think the United States government is responsible for the fact \nthat a bunch of fanatics decided to kill themselves.  And I'm sorry \nthat they killed their children.\n	     \n	     Q	  Mr. President, to follow up partly on Helen on your \nstimulus package and on your political approach to Capitol Hill, Ross \nPerot said today that you're playing games with the American people \nin your tax policy.  He was strongly critical of your stimulus \npackage.  He said he's going to launch an advertising campaign \nagainst the North American Free Trade Agreement.  How are you going \nto handle his political criticism?  Will it complicate your efforts \non the Hill with your economic plan?  And do you plan to repackage \nsome of the things that have been in your stimulus program and try to \nresubmit them to the Hill?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me answer that question first.  \nWe're going to revisit all of that over the next few days.  I'm going \nto be talking to members of Congress and to others to see what we can \ndo about that.  With regard to the economic plan, I must say I found \nthat rather amazing.  I don't want to get into an argument with Mr. \nPerot.  I'll be interested to hear what his specifics are, but I \nwould -- go back and read his book and his plan.  There's a \nremarkable convergence except that we have more specific budget cuts, \nwe raise taxes less on the middle class and more on the wealthy.  \nBut, otherwise, the plans are remarkably similar.  \n	     \n	     So I think it would be -- I'll be interested to see if \nmaybe perhaps he's changed his position from his book last year and \nhe has some new ideas to bring to bear.  I'll be glad to hear them.\n	     \n	     Q	  To follow up, sir, how do you plan to handle his \npolitical criticism?  He's launched a campaign against you.  Do you \nthink you can sit back and just --\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I will ask you to \napply the same level of scrutiny to him as you do to me.  And if he's \nchanged his position from the positions he took in the campaign last \nyear, then we need to know why and what his ideas are.  Maybe he's \ngot some constructive ideas.  \n	     \n	     I think the American people have shown that they're very \nimpatient with people who don't want to produce results.  And the one \nthing I think that everybody has figured out about me in the last -- \neven if they don't agree with what I do -- is that I want to get \nsomething done.  I just came here to try to change things.  I want to \ndo things.  And I want to do things that help people's lives.  So my \njudgment is that if he makes a suggestion that is good, that is \nconstructive, that takes us beyond some idea I've proposed that will \nchange people's lives for the better, fine.  But I think that that \nought to be the test that we apply to everyone who weighs into this \ndebate and not just to the President.\n\n	     Q	  Mr. President, to go back to Bosnia for a minute.  \nYou continue to insist that this has to be multilateral action, a \ncriteria that seems to have hamstrung us when it comes to many \noptions thus far and makes it look as if this is a state of \nparalysis.  The United States is the last remaining superpower.  Why \nis it not appropriate in this situation for the United States to act \nunilaterally?\n\n	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, the United States -- surely you \nwould agree, that the United States, even as the last remaining \nsuperpower, has to act consistent with international law under some \nmandate of the United Nations.\n\n	     Q	  But you have a mandate and --\n\n	     THE PRESIDENT:  They do, and that is one of the things \nthat we have under review.  I haven't ruled out any option for \naction.  I would remind all of you, I have not ruled out any option, \nexcept that we have not discussed and we are not considering the \nintroduction of American forces into continuing hostilities there.  \nWe are not.  \n\n	     So we are reviewing other options.  But I also would \nremind you that, to be fair, our allies have had -- the French, the \nBritish and the Canadians -- have had troops on the ground there.  \nThey have been justifiably worried about those.  But they have \nsupported the airdrops, the toughening of the sanctions.  They \nwelcomed the American delegation now in Europe, working on how to \nmake these sanctions really work and really bite against Serbia.  And \nI can tell you that the other nations involved are also genuinely \nreassessing their position, and I would not rule out the fact that we \ncan reach an agreement for a concerted action that goes beyond where \nwe have been.  I don't have any criticism of the British, the French \nand others about that.\n	     \n	     Q	  Would that be military action?\n	     \n	     Q	  Mr. President, several of the leading lights in \nyour administration, ranging from your FBI Director to your U.N. \nAmbassador, to your Deputy Budget Director to your Health Services \nSecretary, have issued statements in the last couple of weeks which \nare absolutely contradictory to some of the positions you've taken in \nyour administration.  Why is that?  Are you losing your political \ngrip?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  Give me an example. \n	     \n	     Q	  Example?  Judge Sessions said that there was no \nchild abuse in Waco.  Madeleine Albright has said in this morning's \nnewspapers, at least, that she favors air strikes in Bosnia.  All of \nthese are things you said that you didn't support.\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  First of all, I don't know what -- we \nknow that David Koresh had sex with children.  I think that is \nundisputed, is it not?  Is it not?  Does anybody dispute that?  Where \nI come from that qualifies as child abuse.  And we know that he had \npeople teaching these kids how to kill themselves.  I think that \nqualifies as abuse.  And I'm not criticizing Judge Sessions because I \ndon't know exactly what he said.\n	     \n	     In terms of Madeleine Albright, Madeleine Albright has \nmade no public statement at all about air strikes.  There is a press \nreport that she wrote me a confidential letter in which she expressed \nher -- or memo -- in which she expressed her views about the new \ndirection we should take in response to my request to all the senior \nmembers of my administration to let me know what they thought we \nought to do next.  And I have heard from her and from others about \nwhat they think we ought to do next.  And I'm not going to discuss \nthe recommendations they made to me, but in the next few days when I \nmake a decision about what to do, then I will announce what I'm going \nto do.  So I wouldn't say that either one of those examples qualifies \nspeaking out of school.\n	     \n	     Q	  How about the Value Added Tax, Mr. President?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  What was that?\n	     \n	     Q	  The Value Added Tax -- Mrs. Rivlin and Miss Shalala \nboth said that they thought that that was a good idea.\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  I don't mind them saying they think it's \na good idea.  There are all kinds of arguments for it on policy \ngrounds.  That does not mean that we have decided to incorporate it \nin the health care debate.  No decision has been made on that.  And I \nhave no objection to their expressing their views on that.  We've had \na lot of people from business and labor come to us saying that they \nthought that tax would help make their particular industries more \ncompetitive in the global economy.  I took no -- that wasn't taking a \nline against an administration policy.\n	     \n	     Q	  Mr. President, a week ago a group of gay and \nlesbian representatives came out of a meeting with you and expressed \nin the most ringing terms, their confidence in your understanding of \nthem and their political aspirations, and their belief that you would \nfulfill those aspirations.  Do you feel now that you will be able to \nmeet their now enhanced expectations?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I don't know about that.  And I \ndon't know what their -- it depends on what the expectations are.  \nBut I'll tell you this:  I believe that this country's policies \nshould be heavily biased in favor of nondiscrimination.  I believe \nwhen you tell people they can't do certain things in this country \nthat other people can do, there ought to be an overwhelming and \ncompelling reason for it.  I believe we need the services of all of \nour people, and I have said that consistently.  And not as a \npolitical proposition.  The first time this issue came up was in 1991 \nwhen I was in Boston.  I was just asked the question about it.\n	     \n	     And I might add -- it's interesting that I have been \nattacked -- obviously, those who disagree with me here are primarily \ncoming from the political right in America.  When I was Governor, I \nwas attacked from the other direction for sticking up for the rights \nof religious fundamentalists to run their child care centers and to \npractice home schooling under appropriate safeguards.  I just have \nalways had an almost libertarian view that we should try to protect \nthe rights of American individual citizens to live up to the fullest \nof their capacities, and I'm going to stick right with that.\n	     \n	     Q	  Are you concerned, sir, that you may have generated \nexpectations on their end and criticism among others that has \nhamstrung your administration in the sense of far too great emphasis \non this issue?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, but I have not placed a great deal \nof emphasis on it.  It's gotten a lot of emphasis in other quarters \nand in the press.  I've just simply taken my position and tried to \nsee it through.  And that's what I do.  It doesn't take a lot of my \ntime as President to say what I believe in and what I intend to do, \nand that's what I'll continue to do.\n	     \n	     Q	  Mr. President, getting back to the situation in \nBosnia -- and we understand you haven't made any final decisions on \nnew options previously considered unacceptable.  But the two most \ncommonly heard options would be lifting the arms embargo to enable \nthe Bosnian Muslims to defend themselves and to initiate some limited \nair strikes, perhaps, to cut off supply lines.  Without telling us \nyour decision -- presumably, you haven't made any final decisions on \nthose two options -- what are the pros and cons that are going \nthrough your mind right now and will weigh heavily on your final \ndecision?  \n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  I'm reluctant to get into this.  There \nare -- those are two of the options.  There are some other options \nthat have been considered.  All have pluses and minuses; all have \nsupporters and opponents within the administration and in the \nCongress, where, I would remind you, heavy consultations will be \nrequired to embark on any new policy.\n	     \n	     I do believe that on the air strike issue, the \npronouncements that General Powell has made generally about military \naction, apply there.  If you take action, if the United States takes \naction, we must have a clearly-defined objective that can be met.  We \nmust be able to understand it and its limitations must be clear.  The \nUnited States is not, should not, become involved as a partisan in a \nwar.  \n	     \n	     With regard to the lifting of the arms embargo, the \nquestion obviously there is if you widen the capacity of people to \nfight will that help to get a settlement and bring about peace?  Will \nit lead to more bloodshed?  What kind of reaction can others have \nthat would undermine the effectiveness of the policy?\n	     \n	     But I think both of them deserve some serious \nconsideration, along with some other options we have.\n	     \n	     Q	  Do you think that these people who are trying to \nget us into war in Bosnia are really remembering that we haven't \ntaken care of hundreds of thousands of veterans from the last war and \nwe couldn't take care of our prisoners and get them all home from \nVietnam?   And now many of them are coming up with bills for \ntreatment of Agent Orange.  How can we afford to go to any more of \nthese wars?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that's a good argument \nagainst the United States itself becoming involved as a belligerent \nin a war there.  But we are, after all, the world's only super power.  \nWe do have to lead the world  and there is a very serious problem of \nsystematic ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia, which could \nhave not only enormous further humanitarian consequences -- and \ngoodness knows there have been many -- but also could have other \npractical consequences in other nearby regions where the same sorts \nof ethnic tensions exist.\n\n	     Q	  Did you make any kind of agreement with Boris \nYeltsin to hold off either on air strikes or any kind of aggressive \naction against the Serbs until after Sunday?  And in general, how has \nhis political situation affected your deliberation on Bosnia?\n\n	     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I have not made any agreement, and \nhe did not ask for that.  We never even discussed that, interestingly \nenough.  The Russians, I would remind you, in the middle of President \nYeltsin's campaign, abstained from our attempt to get tougher \nsanctions through the United Nations in what I thought was the proper \ndecision for them and one that the United States and, I'm sure, the \nrest of the free world very much appreciated. \n\n	     Q	  Do you wish, Mr. President, that you'd become more \ninvolved in the planning of the Waco operation?  And how would you \nhandle that situation differently now?\n\n	     THE PRESIDENT:  I don't think as a practical matter that \nthe President should become involved in the planning of those kinds \nof things at that detail.  One of the things that I'm sure will come \nout when we look into this is -- the questions will be asked and \nanswered, did all of us who up the line of command ask the questions \nwe should have asked and get the answers we should have gotten?  And \nI look forward to that.  But at the time, I have to say, as I did \nbefore, the first thing I did after the ATF agents were killed, once \nwe knew that the FBI was going to go in, was to ask that the military \nbe consulted because of the quasi, as least, military nature of the \nconflict given the resources that Koresh had in his compound and \ntheir obvious willingness to use them.  And then on the day before \nthe action, I asked the questions of the Attorney General which I \nhave reported to you previously, and which at the time I thought were \nsufficient.  I have -- as I said, I'm sure -- I leave it to others to \nmake the suggestions about whether there are other questions I should \nhave asked.\n	     \n	     Q	  Mr. President, what is your assessment of Director \nSessions' role in the Waco affair?  And have you made a decision on \nhis future?  And if you haven't, will you give him a personal hearing \nbefore you do decide?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I have no assessment \nof his role since I had no direct contact with him.  And I mean no \nnegative or positive inference.  I have no assessment there.  I stand \nby what I said before about my general high regard for the FBI.  And \nI'm waiting for a recommendation from the Attorney General about what \nto do with the direction of the FBI.\n	     \n	     Q	  Mr. President, since you said that one side in \nBosnia conflict represents inhumanity that the Holocaust carried to \nthe nth degree, why do you then tell us that the United States cannot \ntake a partisan view in this war?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I said that the principle of \nethnic cleansing is something we ought to stand up against.  That \ndoes not mean that the United States or the United Nations can enter \na war, in effect, to redraw the lines, geographical lines of \nrepublics within what was Yugoslavia, or that that would ultimately \nbe successful.\n	     \n	     I think what the United States has to do is to try to \nfigure out whether there is some way consistent with forcing the \npeople to resolve their own difficulties we can stand up to and stop \nethnic cleansing.  And that is obviously the difficulty we are \nwrestling with.  This is clearly the most difficult foreign policy \nproblem we face, and that all of our allies face.  And if it were \neasy, I suppose it would have been solved before.  We have tried to \ndo more in the last 90 days than was previously done.  It has clearly \nnot been enough to stop the Serbian aggression, and  we are now \nlooking at what else we can do.\n	     \n	     Q	  Yesterday you specifically criticized the Roosevelt \nadministration for not having bombed the railroads to the \nconcentration camps and things that were near military targets.  \nAren't there steps like that that would not involve conflict --direct \nconflict or partisan belligerence that you might consider?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  There may be.  I would remind you that \nthe circumstances were somewhat different.  We were then at war with \nGermany at the time and that's what made that whole incident so --\nseries of incidents -- so perplexing.  But we have -- as I say, we've \ngot all of our options under review.\n	     \n	     Q	  The diplomatic initiative on Haiti is on the verge \nof collapse.  What can you do to salvage it short of a full-scale \nmilitary operation?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you may know something I don't.  \nThat's not what our people tell me.  I think Mr. Caputo and \nAmbassador Pezzullo have done together a good job.  The thing keeps \ngoing back and forth because of the people who are involved with the \nde facto government there.  It's obvious what their concerns are.  \nThey were the same concerns that led to the ouster of Aristide in the \nfirst place, and President Aristide, we feel, should be restored to \npower.  We're working toward that.  I get a report on that -- we \ndiscuss it at least three times a week, and I'm convinced that we're \ngoing to prevail there and be successful.  \n	     \n	     I do believe that there's every reason to think that \nthere will have to be some sort of multilateral presence to try to \nguarantee the security and the freedom from violence of people on \nboth sides of the ledger while we try to establish the conditions of \nongoing civilized society.  But I believe we're going to prevail \nthere.\n	     \n	     Q	  Mr. President, would you care to make your \nassessment of the first 100 days before we make one for you?  \n(Laughter.)\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I'll say if -- I believe, first of \nall, we passed the budget resolution in record time.  That was the \nbiggest issue.  That confirmed the direction of the administration \nand confirmed the commitments of the campaign that we could both \nbring the deficit down and increase investment, and that we could do \nit by specific spending cuts and by raising taxes, almost all of \nwhich come from the highest income people in this society --reversing \na 12-year trend in which most of the tax burdens were borne by the \nmiddle class, whose incomes were going down when their taxes were \ngoing up, while the deficit went from $1 trillion to $4 trillion, the \ntotal national debt, and the deficit continued to go up.\n	     \n	     We have a 20-year low in interest rates from mortgages. \nWe have lower interest rates across the board.  We have tens of \nbillions of dollars flooding back into this economy as people \nrefinance their debt.  \n	     \n	     We have established a new environmental policy, which is \ndramatically different.  The Secretary of Education has worked with \nme and with others and with the governors to establish a new approach \nin education that focuses on tough standards, as well as increasing \nopportunity.  We have done an enormous amount of work on political \nreform, on campaign finance and lobbying reform.  And I have imposed \ntough ethics requirements on my own administration's officials.  \nThese things are consistent with not only what I said I'd do in the \ncampaign, but with turning the country around.  The Vice President is \nheading a task force which will literally change the way the federal \ngovernment operates and make it much more responsive to the citizens \nof this country.  \n	     \n	     We are working on a whole range of other things.  The \nwelfare reform initiative, to move people from welfare to work.  And, \nof course, a massive amount of work has been done on the health care \nissue, which is a huge economic and personal security problem for \nmillions of Americans.  \n	     \n	     So I think it is amazing how much has been done.  More \nwill be done.  We also passed the Family Leave bill.  A version of \nthe motor voter bill -- that has not come out of conference back to \nme yet.  And everything has been passed except the stimulus program.  \nSo I think we're doing fine and we're moving in the right direction.  \nI feel good about it.\n	     \n	     Q	  Sir, a follow-up.  Wouldn't you say, though, that \none of your biggest initiatives, aid to Soviet Russia, is now \npractically finished -- if we can't pass a stimulus bill in our own \ncountry, how can we do it for them?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me recast the question a little bit.  \nIt's a good question -- (laughter) -- it's a good question, but to be \nfair we've got to recast it.  We have already -- the first round of \naid to the Soviet -- to non-Soviet Russia, to a democratic Russia, is \nplainly going to go through, the first $1.6 billion.  The aid that we \nagreed with our partners in the G-7 to provide through the \ninternational financial institutions, which is a big dollar item, is \nplainly going to go through.  The question is, can we get any more \naid for Russia that requires a new appropriation by the United States \nCongress?  And that is a question I think, Mary, that will be \nresolved in the weeks ahead, in part by what happens to the American \nworkers and their jobs and their future.  I think the two things will \nbe tied by many members of Congress.\n\n	     Q	  The tailhook report came out this morning, \ndocumenting horrendous and nearly-criminal conduct on the part of the \nNavy.  How much did you discuss the incident and what might be done \nabout it with your nominee to be the Secretary of the Navy?\n\n	     THE PRESIDENT:  First, let me comment a little on that.  \nThe Inspector General's report details conduct which is wrong and \nwhich has no place in the armed services.  And I expect the report to \nbe acted on in the appropriate way.  I also want to say to the \nAmerican people and to all of you that the report should be taken for \nwhat it is, a very disturbing list of allegations which will have to \nbe thoroughly examined.  It should not be taken as a general \nindictment of the United States Navy or of all the fine people who \nserve there.  It is very specific in its allegations, and it will be \npursued.  \n\n	     The only thing I said to the Secretary-Designate of the \nNavy and the only thing I should have said to him, I think, is that I \nexpected him to take the report and to do his duty.  And I believe he \nwill do that.\n\n	     Q	  Mr. President, to back to Russia for just a minute.  \nThe latest poll show that Mr. Yeltsin will probably win his vote of \nconfidence.  But there seems to be a real toss-up on whether or not \nvoters are going to endorse his economic reforms.  \n\n	     THE PRESIDENT:  I understand that.  \n\n	     Q	  Can you live with a split -- (laughter) -- can you \nlive with a split decision, though, or do you need both passed in \norder to then build support for Russian aid?\n\n	     THE PRESIDENT:  I believe -- the answer to your question \nis, for the United States, the key question should be that which is \nposed to any democracy, which is who wins the election.  If he wins \nthe election, if he is ratified by the Russian people to continue as \ntheir President, then I think we should do our best to work with him \ntoward reform.\n	     \n	     You know, we had a lot of other countries here for the \nHolocaust Museum dedication -- their leaders were here.  Leaders from \nEastern Europe, leaders from at least one republic of the former \nSoviet Union; all of them having terrible economic challenges as they \nconvert from a communist command and control economy to a market \neconomy in a world where there's economic slowdown everywhere.  And \nin a world in which there's economic slowdown and difficulty, all \nleaders will have trouble having their policies be popular in a poll \nbecause they haven't produced the results that the people so \nearnestly yearn for.  You can understand that.  \n	     \n	     But if they have confidence in the leadership, I think \nthat's all we can ask.  And the United States will -- if the Russian \npeople ratify him as their President and stick with him then the \nUnited States will continue to work with him.  I think he is a \ngenuine democrat -- small d -- and genuinely committed to reform.  I \nthink that we should support that.\n\n	     Q	  Mr. President, Mr. Perot has come out strongly in \nwhat is perceived behind the line against a free trade agreement --\nNAFTA.  How hard are you going to fight for this free trade agreement \nand when do you expect to see it accomplished?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  I think we'll have the agreement ready \nin the fairly near future.  You know, our people are still working \nwith the Mexican government and with the Canadians on the side \nagreements.  We're trying to work out what the environmental \nagreement will say, what the labor agreement will say, and then what \nthe fairest way to deal with enforcement is.  \n	     \n	     The Mexicans say, and there is some merit to their \nposition, that they're worried about transferring their sovereignty \nin enforcement to a multilateral commission.  Even in the United \nStates, to be fair, we have some folks who are worried about that --\nabout giving that up.  On the other hand, if we're going to have an \nenvironmental agreement and a labor standards agreement that means \nsomething, then there has to be ultimately some consequences for \nviolating them.  So what we're trying to do is to agree on an \napproach which would say that if there is a pattern of violations --\nif you keep on violating it past a certain point -- maybe not an \nisolated incident, but a pattern of violation -- there is going to be \nsome enforcement.  There must be consequences.  And we're working out \nthe details of that.\n	     \n	     But I still feel quite good about it.  And this is just \nan area where I disagree with Mr. Perot and with others.  I think \nthat we will win big if we have a fair agreement that integrates more \nclosely the Mexican economy and the American economy and leads us \nfrom there to Chile to other market economies in Latin America, and \ngives us a bigger world in which to trade.  I think that's the only \nway a rich country can grow richer.  If you look at what Japan and \nother countries in the Pacific are doing to reach out in their own \nregion, it's a pretty good lesson to us that we had better worry \nabout how to build those bridges in our own area.  \n	     \n	     So this is an idea battle.  You know, you've got a lot \nof questions and I want to answer them all, but let me say not every \none of these things can be distilled simply into politics -- you \nknow, who's for this and who's for that, and if this person is for \nthis, somebody else has got to be for that.  A lot of these things \nhonestly involved real debates over ideas, over who's right and wrong \nabout the world toward which we're moving.  And the answers are not \nself-evident.  And one of the reasons that I wanted to run for \nPresident is I wanted to sort of open the floodgates for debating \nthese ideas so that we could try to change in the appropriate way.  \nSo I just have a difference of opinion.  I believe that the concept \nof NAFTA is sound, even though, as you know, I thought that the \ndetails needed to be improved.\n	     \n	     Q	  Mr. President, there was a tremendous flurry of \ninterest earlier this month in the Russian document that purported to \nshow that the Vietnamese had held back American prisoners.  General \nVessey has now said publicly that while the document itself was \nauthentic, he believes that it was incorrect.  Do you have a personal \nview at this point about that issue?  And more broadly, do you \nbelieve that, in fact, the Vietnamese did return all the American \nprisoners at the time of the Paris Peace Accord?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  First let me say, I saw General Vessey \nbefore he went to Vietnam and after he returned.  And I have a high \nregard for him and I appreciate his willingness to serve his country \nin this way.  As to whether the document had any basis in fact, let \nme say that the government of Vietnam was more forthcoming than it \nhad been in the past and gave us some documents that would tend to \nundermine the validity of the Russian documents claim.\n	     \n	     I do not know whether that is right or wrong.  We are \nhaving it basically evaluated at this time, and when we complete the \nevaluation, we'll tell you.  And, of course, we want to tell the \nfamilies of those who were missing in action or who were POWs.  I \nthink that we'll be able to make some progress in eliminating some of \nthe questions about the outstanding cases as a result of this last \ninterchange, but I cannot say that I'm fully satisfied that we know \nall that we need to know.  There are still some cases that we don't \nknow the answer to.  But I do believe we're making some progress.  I \nwas encouraged by the last trip.\n	     \n	     Q	  I'd like to follow up on that.  Before the U.S. \nnormalizes relations, allows trade to go forward, do you have to be \npersonally sure that every case has been resolved or would you be \nwilling to go forward on the basis that while it may take years to \nresolve these cases, the Vietnamese have made sufficient offerings to \nus to confirm good faith?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  A lot of experts say you can never \nresolve every case, every one, that we couldn't resolve all the cases \nfor them and that there are still some cases that have not been \nfactually resolved, going back to the Second World War.  But what I \nwould have to be convinced of is that we had gone a long way toward \nresolving every case that could be resolved at this moment in time, \nand that there was a complete, open and unrestricted commitment to \ncontinue to do everything that could be done always to keep resolving \nthose cases.  And we're not there yet.  \n	     \n	     Again, I have to be guided a little bit by people who \nknow a lot about this.  And I confess to being much more heavily \ninfluenced by the families of the people whose lives were lost there, \nor whose lives remain in question than by the commercial interest and \nthe other things which seem so compelling in this moment.  I just am \nvery influenced by how the families feel.\n	     \n	     Q	     your economic stimulus package, are you doing \nsome kind of reality check now and scaling back some of your plans, \nyour legislative plans for the coming year, including the crime bill, \nthe health care initiative and other things?  Are there any plans to \ndo that?  And also, did you underestimate the power of Senator Bob \nDole?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  No, what I underestimated was the extent \nto which what I thought was a fairly self-evident case, particularly \nafter we stayed below the spending caps approved by this Congress, \nincluding the Republicans who were in this Congress last year -- when \nwe had already passed a budget resolution which called for over $500 \nbillion in deficit reduction.  When they had voted repeatedly for \nsupplemental appropriations to help foreign governments, I thought at \nleast four of them would vote to break cloture, and I underestimated \nthat.  I did not have an adequate strategy of dealing with that.  \n	     \n	     I also thought that if I made a good-faith effort to \nnegotiate and to compromise, that it would not be rebuffed.  Instead, \nevery time I offered something they reduced the offer that they had \npreviously been talking to the Majority Leader about.  So it was a \nstrange set of events.  But I think what happened was what was a \nsignificant part of our plan, but not the major part of it, acquired \na political connotation that got out of proportion to the merits, so \nthat a lot of Republicans were saying to me privately, "Mr. \nPresident, I'd like to be for this, but I can't now.  And we're all \nstrung out and we're divided."  \n	     \n	     And I think we need to do a reality check.  As I said, \nwhat I want to know -- let me go back to what I said -- what I want \nto know from our folks and from our friends in the Senate on -- and \nRepublicans or Democrats -- is what could I have done differently to \nmake it come out differently.  Because the real losers here were not \nthe President and the administration.  The real losers were the \nhundreds of thousands of people who won't have jobs now.  We could \nhave put another 700,000 kids to work this summer.  I mean, we could \nhave done a lot of good things with that money.  And I think that is \nvery, very sad.  And it became more political than it should have.  \nBut the underlying rationale I don't think holds a lot of water --\nthat it was deficit spending.  That just won't wash.\n	     \n	     Q	     and redo --\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  No.  I mean, you know, for example --you \nmentioned the crime bill.  I think it would be a real mistake not to \npass the crime bill.  I mean, the crime bill was almost on the point \nof passage last year.  And they were all fighting over the Brady \nBill.  Surely, surely after what we have been through in this country \njust in the last three months, with the kind of mindless violence we \nhave seen, we can pass a bill requiring people to go through a \nwaiting period before they buy a handgun.  And surely we can see that \nwe need more police officers on the street.  \n	     \n	     That's another thing that -- I really believe that once \nwe move some of that money -- not all, but some of it up into this \njobs package to make some of the jobs rehiring police officers on the \nstreet who'd been laid off, that would be a compelling case.  I mean \npeople are scared in this country and I think we need to go forward. \nI feel very strongly that we need to go forward on the crime bill.\n	     \n	     Q	  Mr. President, back to the tailhook report for a \nsecond.  That report contained very strong criticism of the Navy's \nsenior leadership in general, but did not name any of the senior \nofficers.  Do you believe that the senior officers who are implicated \nin this, including Admiral Kelso who was there one night in Las \nVegas, should they be disciplined and do you believe the public has a \nright to know the names of the senior officers?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  You should know that under the rules of \nlaw which apply to this, I am in the chain of command.  There is now \nan Inspector General's report and the law must take its course.  If I \nwere to answer that question I might prejudice any decisions which \nmight be later made in this case.  I don't really think -- I think \nall I can tell you is what I have already said.  I was very disturbed \nby the specific allegations in the Inspector General's report, and I \nwant appropriate action to be taken.  \n	     \n	     Until the proper procedures have a chance to kick in and \nappropriate action is taken, I have been advised that because I am \nthe Commander-in-Chief I have to be very careful about what I say so \nas not to prejudice the rights of anybody against whom any action \nmight proceed or to prejudice the case in any other way either pro or \ncon.  So I can't say any more except to say that I want this thing \nhandled in an appropriate and thorough way.\n	     \n	     Q	  Mr. President, could I ask you for a clarification \non Bosnia?  You said that you were not considering introduction of \nAmerican forces.  Does that include any air forces as well as ground \nforces, sir?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  I said ground forces.\n	     \n	     Q	  You said ground forces.  Could I ask you, sir, if \nyou fear that using U.S. air strikes might  draw the United States \ninto a ground war there?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  I just don't want to discuss our \nevaluation of the options anymore.  I've told you that there's never \nbeen a serious discussion in this country about the introduction of \nground forces into an ongoing conflict there.\n	     \n	     Q	  With hundreds of thousands of gays in Washington \nthis weekend for the march, did you ever reconsider your decision to \nleave town for this weekend?  Did you ever consider in any way \nparticipating in some of the activities? \n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  No.\n	     \n	     Q	  Why not?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  Because I -- and, basically, I wouldn't \nparticipate in other marches.  I think once you become President, on \nbalance, except under unusual circumstances, that is not what should \nbe done.  But more importantly, I'm going to the American Society of \nNewspaper Editors, a trip that presumably most of you would want me \nto make, to try to focus anew on what I think are the fundamental \nissues at stake for our country right now.  And I expect that I will \nsay something about the fact that a lot of Americans have come here, \nasking for a climate that is free of discrimination; asking, \nbasically, to be able to work hard and live by the rules and be \ntreated like other American citizens if they do that, and just that.  \nAnd that's always been my position -- not only for the gays who will \nbe here, but for others as well.  \n	     \n	     Thank you very much.

So, you approve of the BATF launching a 100-person raid, complete\nwith flack jackets, men hidden in horse trailers, stun grenades,\nsemi-auto weapons on peaceful citizens?  who would also accept\na search authoried by a court?\n\nThere is still no proof that the Branch Davidians had illegal weapons.\nNothing else was in the jurisdiction of the BATF, unless they were\nthought to have a still, or be smoking untaxed cigarettes.\n\nThe automatic firearms violation is a TAX matter !

Then you can come home to something \nlike this:\n\n    "Well, it's been a rough month," begins Johnnie Lawmaster.  "I\n just get laid off, and my divorce became final.  But I just wasn't\n ready for what happened this particular Monday."\n\n    That particular Monday was was December 16, the first day of the\n Bill of Rights' third century, the day when federal agents and local\n law enforcement officer broke into the house in Tulsa that always flew\n the U.S. flag.  When Lawmaster drove into the driveway that bleak\n afternoon, one of his neighbors had some news.\n\n    "'Ohmigod, John, you are in big trouble!' my neighbor tells me.\n 'Sixty police, federal agents and the bomb squad busted in you house,\n kicked down the door, cut locks off your gun safe.'  I couldn't\n believe it.  Then I walked inside.  What a nightmare."\n\n    It was no nightmare; it was horribly real life.  Apparently acting\n on information the Lawmaster possessed an illegal firearm, some thirty\n agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) teamed up\n with state and Tulsa police authorities, search warrant in hand, to\n search for a "Colt, AR-15, .223 caliber machine gun, unknown serial\n number."  The warrant, issued by U.S. Magistrate John Leo Wagner, also\n authorized agents to seize "any tools used in the alteration or\n modification of firearms, such as files or drills; documents, papers,\n books, records, and other tangible properties which identify occupants\n or owners of the property to be searched...."\n\n    Reports vary, but according to neighbors, the joint task force\n operation aimed at the unemployed warehouseman from a nearby hospital\n involved some 60 agents and local law enforcement personnel against\n Lawmaster.  They cordoned off the street; took station with weapons\n drawn in the back yard; used a battering ram to break through the\n front door; kicked in the back door; broke into his gun safe; threw\n personal papers around the house; spilled boxes of ammunition on the\n floor; broke into a small, locked box that contained precious coins;\n stood on a table to peer through the ceiling tiles, breaking the table\n in the process.  Then, they left.  The doors were closed but not\n latched, much less locked.  The ammo and guns were left unsecured.\n\n    "My front and back doors were pulled shut, but they were busted\n through and couldn't latch.  Anybody could have waltzed in there and\n stolen everything I own.  A child could have taken a gun.  The guns,\n the safe -- everything was open and laying around.  I keep all my\n magazines empty, but someone had loaded them.  While I was looking\n around in amazement, the gas, electric and water companies show up to\n turn the power off.  They said they were told to shut things down.\n Then I found the note.  "Nothing Found - ATF."\n\n    "They didn't make any attempt to notify me.  I've lived in Tulsa\n all my life and never got more than a traffic ticket.  How come they\n can't look that up, realize I've been law-abiding my whole life, then\n come to the door when I'm home?  They didn't leave someone here to\n watch over my private property.  They didn't even come by to explain\n what happened.  They just raided my home, ransaked it, left it wide\n open and left."\n\n    Lawmaster placed a phone call to the local BATF agent.  "I asked,\n 'Are you gonna' arrest me?' and he said, 'No.'  I asken him, "Who is\n going to repair and clean up my house?'  And he said, "If you're going\n to talk to me, come down to my office.'\n\n    "'I can't come down!' I said.  'My doors are broken!'  If I had\n been on vacation and I didn't have friendly neighbors, I would have\n lost everything I own.  Here I am a competent, responsible firearms\n owner, and the government leaves them open, unlocked, with ammo strewn\n around."\n\n    Lawmaster said the agent advised him, "If you want your door to\n lock and your gun safe to lock, you're gonna' have to pay for it\n yourself."\n\n    "'Oh, I'll come right down, alright,' I told him.  'I'll come\n down, but I'll bring my attorney.'  And he said, 'Well, you bring\n your attorney, and we won't talk to you.'"\n\n\nSo if you don't want your tea party to be held in awkward silence, make\nsure your lawyer isn't there, there's a good chap.\n\n\n\nWhat a repulsive outlook on society.

Janet Reno killed the Waco children.  She is responsible for\ntheir deaths.  She should resign immediately.  She should have \nunderstood that David Koresh was a madman who would do anything\nagainst the children if he became provoked.  All the warning \nsigns were there and she ignored them.  She provoked Koresh\ninto killing the children.\n\nThe situation in Waco was similar to a hostage situation with \na madman holding a gun against the head of an innocent person.\nIn such a situation, a person who provokes the madman and causes \nhim to pull the gun's trigger is responsible for the death of the\nhostage.  Janet Reno blindly stumbled in there and basically\nthrew a tear gas container at the madman hoping that he would\nrelease the hostage.  It's no surprise that the madman would\npull the trigger in response to that kind of provocation.

t\n\n\nThe original poster never said they were afraid of King because he was\nblack.  In fact the officers were afraid of King because of WHAT HE DID,\nnot because OF THE COLOR OF HIS SKIN.  It is you, Mr. Frank that read the\nphrase "large black man" and cried racism in a typical knee-jerk fashion.\nWhen you (and others, I suspect) can get past this problem maybe the real\nproblems in this issue can be discussed.

Bzzzzt.  THANK you for playing, but obviously you are not reading the \n  material as it is presented.  According to the report I've got in my \n  hands, the Newsweek article (which reported that "2 to 3 percent" of the \n  population is gay) used the criteria of "No heterosexual contact in the \n  past year."  But at the same time, the University of Denver study points \n  out, quite dramatically, that 60% of all self-identifying gay men have
Do we know yet who will be holding the hearings? And, if so, do\nwe know who is on the committee of question askers? I'm sure\nmany of us have potential questions we'd like to send to them.
The BATF warrant was unsealed yesterday.\n\n         The entire operation was illegal from day ONE.\n\n\n       No authority for a "no-knock" raid.\n       No authority to use the Texas helicopters.\n       No authority to search for a "drug lab".  More ATF lies.
But aren't you imposing your moral standards against gay people because\nyou do not want to rent to, or hire, or as you put associate with, (\nand I do not know of a law that requires you to associate with gay\npeople)?  It works both ways.
True.  Today's Boston Globe interviewed a former Unification Church\n  leader who is now a consultant on cults.  He said the FBI's approach\n  was totally wrong.  He said they should have tried to break down the \n  BD's loyalty to Koresh through psychological means.   Koresh's whole\n  theology was based on an approaching confrontation with the forces \n  of evil in the world and a seige mentality based on this.  The Feds\n  played into his hands **PERFECTLY**.   By surrounding the compound\n  with tanks and playing loud rock music and glaring lights at them \n  they strongly reinforced Koresh's message that the outside world was\n  evil and threatening.    He said instead they should have set up \n  a picnic atmosphere, and acted inviting and friendly.  If they\n  broadcast anything over PA systems it should have been loving \n  relatives reflecting on pleasant events from the cult members'\n  childhoods.   The idea is to make the outside world and surrender\n  seem like a pleasant, desirable alternative.   Interesting comments.
Peter Nelson posted a very eloquent response to this point in \ntalk.politics.misc, so I need not consume more bandwidth here.\n\n\n\nWhat I meant, if it was not clear, was the intersection set of liberal\nand libertarian philosophies of "natural rights" and how the government\n(and Constitutional interpretation in particular) fits into that \nphilosophy.  This philosophy engages in the very serious practical \nerror of endowing the nine lawyers on the Supreme Court with an almost \ntotalitarian authority, completely outside of the consent or consensus \nof The People.  This is why Supreme Court nominations are such amazing\npolitical fist-fights these days, because He who Controls the Court\nRules the Country.  The people on the Court may well be trying to do\nthe best job they can, but they are at best a benevolent oligarch, even\nif you approve of every Supreme Court decision ever.  Eventually, an\noligarch will arise that will decimate that which you hold dear.  Try \nSupreme Court cases by Jury, and the problem would be mitigated a great \ndeal.\n\nThose who would create broad, non-enumerated government powers at any \nlevel (as in European Parlamentary Democracies and the current de-facto\nstandard in the U.S.) have essentially engaged in the same fundamental \nmistake, except that it is some different body that has the totalitarian, \nvirtually unchecked (except by plurality election, death, or retirement), \ngovernment power. \n\n\n\nThis is like asking why the wind blows, unless you can prove that\nthe fact of your engaging in certain activities has absolutely no \neffect whatsoever on any other human being who has not consented to\nyour engagement in those activities.  Very few human activities indeed\nfit into this category.  \n\nEven for those few that do, who would you empower to make the judgement \nof what is and is not a fully autonomous activity?  Who defines "picking \nmy pocket" and "defrauding"?  Are economic assets a person's only assets,\nor are peace of mind, stability, confidence in a child's emotional \nenvironment, security, and many other things not also a part of a person's\nassets?  What gives you the right to create a moral environment that a\nparent strongly objects to?  What gives you the right to create an \nenvironment of social unrest and instability?  If you say that what you\ndo does not have those effects, by what authority do you say that?  Who\nis empowered to make these value judgements?\n\n\n\nIf the Federal Constitution explicitly prohibited you from doing so, the \nfederal government would prevent you from doing so.  If it did not, and\nyou could muster enough local support to pass an amendment to the local\nConstitution (by, say, a 3/4 majority) empowering the local government \nto do so, then I would have to vote with my feet and move to a neighborhood\nmore friendly to my own system of values.  This is not an ideal situation,\nbut it is far better than the mess we are mired in right now.\n\n\n\nWhen you define "rights" very broadly, there is no practical choice about \nwhether people will or will not infringe upon your rights since these\n"rights" overlap.  Even when rights are defined very narrowly, the government \nhas been empowered to prevent others from infringing on your rights.  The \nfundamental question is, by whose authority is that power created.  If you \nsupport the current situation with a "natural rights" Supreme Court (rather\nthan an "original understanding" Supreme Court or, even better, Supreme\nCourt by Jury), you are consenting to having nine lawyers in Washington, \nD.C. create those powers out of the air.  In my "Fractal Federalism" scenario, \nit is a broad consensus of The People (i.e. the amendment process) that \ncreates those powers.\n\n\n\nNo, I mean the federal government that comes trucking in with guns to\ntell the locals how to run their neighborhood.  Waco, TX is a nice example.\n\n\n\nIf you create a community where public masturbation is permitted in the \ncause of "personal autonomy", have you done anything different?  What\nprecisely are these autonomous activities you are referring to?  If you\nlist them, perhaps we can get enough people to agree that they are truly\nautonomous and pass a constitutional amendment protecting them.\n\n\n\n\nThe Koresh Incident appears to be a horrendous abuse of government power,\npower possibly illegitimately obtained through a means I would abolish. \nThe constitutionality of "no-knock" warrants seems very dubious to me, not\nto mention the mere existence of BATF and the government's propensity to \nignore the word "infringe" in the Second Amendment.  This power is upheld \nby the same body, with its incredible concentration of power in the hands \nof nine people, that has upheld much so-called "Civil Rights" (read- affirmative \naction) legislation despite the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n\n\nMoney is certainly not the only asset I have in this world.  If it were,\nthis would be a bleak existence indeed.\n\n\n\n\nMatt Freivald\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLiBORGalism:\n             THINKING IS IRRELEVANT.

My hope is that people disposed to doing so would simply overdose\n: quickly, and be done with it, before making a mess of thisgs.\n\nIt's actually quite simple. We sell Drug Use Licenses to anybody over age\n18 who wants one.  Costs $100 and you're required to attend a week of\nnight classes on the effects of drugs on the human body.

In doing so,\nyou giver up ANY right to state-paid medical care for whatever might\nhappen to you as a result of doing drugs, or any right to collect welfare\nor unemployment should you lose your job as a result of using drugs.

Steve I'm glad to see that you abandoned the preamble thing.  What; did\nyou do a word search to find Welfare somewhere else in the constitution?\n\n[my comments and paraphrases in brackets]\n\nArticle I Section 8:  [in some ways the guts of the constitution]\n\nThe Congress shall have the Power:\n\n1. To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, \n       to pay the Debts [indebtedness as defined in the document]\n       and provide for the common Defence [Defence as precisely defined]\n       and general Welfare [as defined through the document, mostly in ways\n                           [that limit the government.]\n         of the United States; [but the above taxes shall be uniform through-\n                               [out the U.S.]\n\n    [so far the congress has been given the power to collect taxes uniformly]\n\n    [ then ... ]\n\n2.  To borrow Money [...]\n3.  To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, [interstate and Indian tribes]\n4.  To [do uniform Naturalization and Bankruptcies]\n5.  To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and [etc.]\n6.  To [punish counterfeiters]\n7.  To establish Post Offices and post Roads\n8.  To [provide patents and copyrights]\n9.  To constitute Tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court;\n10. To define and punish Piracies and [etc.]\n11. To declare War, [and etc.]\n12. To raise and support Armies,[but for no longer than two years at a stretch]\n13. To provide and maintain a Navy, [notice no time limit on this one]\n14. To [make the rules for the army and navy]\n15.

Looking to other nations for precedents\nthat support an expansive liberal agenda is much easier than looking to the\nslim pickins found in the constitution.
mwilson@ncratl.AtlantaGA.NCR.COM (Mark Wilson) writes,\n(missing the entire point of my post):\n\n\nNo joke.\n\n\nNo,_you_jumped to_that_conclusion.  It's actually an argument as\nto how to accomplish the societal good of discouraging drug use\nwithout violating individual rights.\n\n\nNo. _You_missed the point.  The point is, the "War On Drugs"\nis a failure, and is counterproductive.\n\n\nBut, they are not free to be stupid and injure other people.\nAdmittedly, the fetal right-to-life is outside the scope of\nthis discussion.  However, it's ridiculous to assert, as you\napparently do, that cocaine has_no effect_on the developing\nfetal nervous system.  Caffiene and nicotine have fetal effects\ntoo, why should cocaine be any exception?\n\n\nIf you had read my article before writing your knee-jerk response\nyou would have seen that this is exactly what I advocated.\n\n\nNo shit, Sherlock.\n\n[...]\n\nThank you.  How could you have missed the point so utterly?\nWhat_have_you been smoking?\n\n\nObviously, importers will not be buying drugs in the U.S., under\nU.S. jurisdiction.  Use your remaining brain cells.\n\n\nO.K., I'll spell it out for you.  "Barter economy" means that\ndrug users will be permitted to grow or synthesize chemically\nanything they choose, or to buy it outside the U.S. and bring\nit in, if it won't grow here.  They will also be permitted to\ntrade with other drug users for drugs other than the ones they\nthemselves grow or manufacture.  They will not, however be able\nto legally sell their drugs for money.  Both manufacture and\nimportation of noncommercial drugs will be taxed, to discourage\ntheir use. "This is your brain on drugs. Any questions?"\n\n\nPardon me, but possession/use of these drugs is still a crime!\nYou cannot analogize the rates at which drug users would seek\ntreatment, and the comparative ease with which it could be\nmade available today, when these drugs are illegal to possess/use,\nwith what it would be were they_not_illegal to possess/use.\nDecriminalizing possession and use makes treatment_much_easier.\nDrug dealers are exploiting the weaknesses of those persons who\nare prone to addiction, and as such, the drug users should be\nleft alone, not thrown in prison along with their victimizers.\nDrug_dealers_are the criminals, and should be treated as such.\nDrug addiction does not absolve you of responsiblity for your\ncriminal actions, however.\n\n\nThe drug test of an arrested suspect is voluntary, not coerced,\nand does not therefore constitute violation of Amendment V.\nThose convicted who are drug users, as evidenced by the test,\nare in need of treatment for their problem.  Institutionalization\nof these adddicted criminals is, I would argue, the best way to\nhelp them straighten out.  If they refuse the test and are convicted,\ntheir sentence can be appropriately harsher, since they, unlike the\naddict, have no "excuse" for their crimes.\n\n\nWhy not?  My objective is to discourage drug use_and_criminal\nbehavior.  If fewer criminals do drugs out of fear of getting a\nharsher sentence if they are convicted, why is that not a good\nthing?  If fewer drug dealers (who are still criminals, BTW)\ncan find victims, why is that not a good thing?  If fewer drug\nusers, such as drunks, 'potheads,' etc., commit crimes out of\nfear of being cut off from their sources of supply, why is that\nnot a good thing?\n\nI'm certainly willing to debate my position.\nYou have to read it carefully though.
Do we want to 'create jobs'? or do we want jobs created that are productive\n  in our supply/demand economy? If your answer is the former then we can\n  just round up all jobless people and pay them to build sandcastles in\n  the desert. If you answer the latter then I fail to see how another\n  bureaucracy produces anything.

: The median of a distribution is that variate-value which divides the\n: distribution halfway, i.e. 1/2 of the distribution (population) have\n: lower and half have higher variate-values.\n\n: So for Males 20-39 the median=7.3, this means that half of these men\n: are higher than this and half are lower than this.  Now if the population\n: sample size is 3300, and 1% of them are gay, 33 males are gay.  If we\n: say they are distributed equally then only 16.5 are greater than 7.3\n: sexual partners, of course, this means that 49.5% heterosexual men are\n: greater than 7.3.\n\nNot quite.  First, the median does not imply that half of the men are\nabove and half below 7.3: it simply means that 7.3 is the mid-point\nbetween the maximum number of partners and the minimum (which is most\nlikely zero).  However, assuming your implication to be more-or-less\ncorrect, your final result is still invalid.  If 50% of *all* males\nhave had more than 7.3 partners, and you deduct the assumed 1% of \nhomosexual males, what remains is not 49.5%, but still *50%* of all\n*heterosexual* males.  Which is to say: hey, we're all human.
Which number is that?  Zero?\n\nPlease present "a number" of authoritative works which "suggest"\nthat "homosexuality is a form of mental disorder, caused by\nchildhood sexual abuse."\n\nDon't present your own biased conclusions, based on a collage\nof tidbits you've extracted from a few hours' research, as the\nconclusions of people who study mental disease and sexual abuse\nprofessionally.

Proving once again that Brett has a major thinking problem...\n\nTwo groups that the government insure are the elderly and the "medically an\nneedy" (those who have impoverished themselves through spending for medical\ncare).  The typical elderly person spends 3.5 times what a person under age\n65.  The typical medically needy person spends about 10 times what the\naverage person does.\n\nYou've got to adjust those data, Brett.
Well, they never should have gotten into this situation.\n\nLook at the history of this group. David Koresh has been arrested\n?twice?  by local police. Both times, he accepted the arrest warrant\nand went peacefully. So, the feds decide to arrest him. How do they\nchoose to arrest a person with a record of peaceful obedience under\narrest? They throw a concussion grenades at his building. \n\nIn addition, we KNOW that we've been lied to. Initially, we were told\nthat they suspected him of molesting children and having several\nwives. But these are NOT ATF offenses, were they? So they changed\ntheir story, several times. And the original warrant is STILL sealed.\nAnd we were told about the rockets and ammunition they had... but did\nanyone notice any ammo exploding in the fire? They claimed that Koresh\nhadn't left the compound in months... but people in town report seeing\nhim just a week before the raid.\n\nHow would I have handled it differently? \n\nWell, first, I haven't seen any evidence that the BDs did anything\nwrong. There's a sealed warrant, and a collection of stories which\nkeep changing about what they did. So I might not have done ANYTHING.\n\nOK. Now, supposing that I know what the BDs are being arrested for.\nWell, they've got a history of accepting arrests... so, I send\nofficers to the door with a warrant. Wearing bulletproof vests.\nCovered from a distance by sharpshooters. Now, there's no good reason\nto suspect that these people will do anything, right? Why didn't\nanyone TRY serving a warrant?\n\nOK. Going further. They refuse the warrant. It becomes necessary to\nraid. You plan a raid. You hear an hour before that there was a leak,\nand they know your coming. SO what do you do?  Well, change your\nplans, right? Nope... they go ahead with it anyone... including\nsending in unprotected men to break into the place. It was idiotic. I\ndon't know what I would have ended up doing. But that original raid\nshould NEVER have happened.\n\nThe shit that came later should NEVER have happened.\n\nThe full record of the raid should be released to the public to let us\nknow what the hell really happened there.\n\nThe lies should NEVER have been told.\n\n	<MC>
You miss the point.  A lot more negotiation is needed to convince women\nto have sex because there is a big taboo about women being free with \ntheir sex.  Many of the women I know would do almost anything rather\nthan be known as a slag, slut or whore.\n\nWith men however there is *status* attached to being able to fuck \nconstantly.  And with gay men, where both partners can prove status\nthrough their constant verility then you are going to get a situation\nwhere there is a lot of sex.\n\nThe difference is between het sex being rationed as a valuable commodity\nand gay sex being virtually unlimited due to the *appetites* of men.\n\nStraights suffer a bottle neck where women are concerned, gay men who\ndo not experience this bottle neck go to excess.
I'd like to conduct a small survey relating to Americans' views on economics and on Japan.\nThe survey consists of just two questions.

Please respond by email to\n"borden@m5.harvard.edu".  Here are the questions:\n\n1) As an American, would you prefer that in a given year, a) our economy grows by one\n   percent, and Japan's economy also grows by one percent, or b) our economy grows by\n   two percent while Japan's economy grows by three percent?\n\n2) On what newsgroup did you read this survey?\n\nThank you for your participation.
:\n\n\n\nWhen McManus says, "We have the world's best medical care," I can hardly\nbelieve he's referring to a system:\n\n1.  That costs us 14 percent of our GDP, while there isn't a\n    single other country in the industrialized world that spends more than\n    10 percent.\n\n2.  That leaves 37 million of us with no coverage, even though all\n    the other systems in the industrialized world cover virtually everyone.\n\n3.  Yet, Americans rank near the bottom of the list in terms of life\n    expectancy, childhood immunization rate, infant mortality, and many\n    preventable diseases.\n\n4.  We pay, on average, about $1000 each for MRIs.  (To put that in\n    perspective, they cost $177 in Japan.)\n\n5.  The average US company spends over 2500 dollars a year per employee on\n    health benefits.  Seven hundred to 1500 is the range just about everywhere\n    else.\n\n\nHow can anyone say that such a system is the best in the world?  The only\nthing the USA health care system is good at is showering well-insured patients\nwith a champagne treatment of care and outrageously overcharging for it.  And\nthe "private" system of insurers and paperwork is so bloated and inefficient\nthat it itself sucks up over 100 billion dollars a year in money from every\nother sector of society - individuals, government, and industry.\n\nOf the < 800 billion dollars Americans threw into the bottomless pit of health\ncare costs last year, the Consumer's Union estimated that at least 200 billion\nwas thrown away on overpriced, useless, and even downright harmful tests and\nprocedures, and the most bureaucratic, regulated insurance system in the world.\n\nThere are more than 1200 different private insurers in the USA.  But did the\n"private competition" stimulate more efficient paperwork?  Ask any doctor\nwho's had to hire a full-time clerk to deal with it all!\n\nThe competition among hospitals is driving costs UP, not down.  The\ncompetition among hospitals for both doctors and patients has encouraged the\nhospitals to traffic in expensive superfluous equipment.  Spending millions on\nexpensive machines of dubious value that spend 80 percent of the day idle\nisn't my idea of the world's best health care system.\n\nCompetition among specialists is driving them to perform dangerous and\nexpensive procedures where they are very marginally helpful.  I'm especially\nthinking of heart surgery and some women's surgeries like hysterectomy and\nCesarean section.  Sound like the world's best health care system?\n\n\n\nEver notice how, every time someone tries to bring about some real change in\nhealth care, the Libbies start bashing Canada's system?  First of all, Hillary\nClinton is not advocating another Canadian system.  I think that's been made\nabundantly clear in the news for the last couple of months.  Where did John F.\nMcManus get that idea, anyway?\n\nLet's say you're a Canadian living in a small town near the USA border.  Your\nchild needs a complicated procedure only available in city hospitals.  The\nnearest Canadian cities are 6 hours west and 20 hours east, and there's an\nAmerican city one hour south.  Which way are you going to go?  Is it because\nthe American system is the "best" in the world, or just for convenience?\n\nIt still amazes me that people can't seem to see more than just black and\nwhite on health care reform.  There are a million different ways we ould\nrestructure the system.  It's not just a choice between total government\ncontrol and total private control.  I wish the people screaming "socialized\nmedicine" every time soemone wants to change the current syste would INFORM\nTHEMSELVES on health care issues.\n\n\n\nThe current system sucks.  I want to keep providers private but that doesn't\nchange the fact that we will never be able to deal with the deficit if we\ndon't REFORM THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM.  Purely private health care without any\ngovernment intervention doesn't work.  Hillary Clinton is not thinking of\nnationalizing providers or evern insurers.  How can you scream "socialized\nmedicine" at her programs?  Don't you even know what you're talking about?\n\n\n\nEver see Clinton's graphs of projected deficit versus year for the rest of the\ndecade?  Notice how the line falls, then starts increasing?  Why?  I'll give\nyou one wild guess as to which component of spending will overwhelm us if we\ndon't do something about it.\n\n\n\nPEOPE JUST DOESN'T GET IT.  The current health care system is a cancer which is\nkilling our economic well-being.  Costs are still rising 10 percent a year\neven as Americans by the tens of millions go without, or are forced into\nmanaged-care programs, which are certainly pretty socialized already if you\nask me.\n\nA couple of months ago I posted a message asking any Hillary-bashers to please\ncome forward and present (no gimmicks, straight talk) just how THEY would set\nabout keeping costs down.  I didn't get a single answer.\n\nThe only thing I keep hearing from Libbie organizations are press releases\nfilled with evasive platitudes like "give health care back to the people."\nJust do you expect to do that without serious reforms?  What is it about the\ncurrent system that you would change and how would that help?\n\n\nHow can anyone read the news, live under our system, and NOT see these faults?\nHow can we deal with the deficit, our cities, our educational system, our\ninfrastrucure, AIDS, modernizing our industry, etc. if we don't quit throwing\naway money which could be used to SOLVE those problems?\n\n\nAmerica needs health care reform NOW.  Don't just sit there and Hillary-bash,\ninform yourself!\n\nJim Reynolds
Since 1979, the members of the European Parliament (the parliamentary assemby\nof the European Community) have been elected directly by the citizens of the\nMember States. Before, the Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) were just\nMembers of National Parliaments (MNPs) elected by and from among their peers.\n\nIn the European Parliament, every Member State has a fixed number of seats,\nwhich increases less than proportionally with the population. Once in five\nyears, a general European election is being held, in which the citizens of all\nMember States choose their representatives to the European Parliament. Next\nelections are due in 1994.\n\nNow the voting system for these European elections still differs from one\ncountry to another. Although the European Treaty enabling the direct election\nof the MEPs requires a uniform voting system, up to now every country has just\nused its own system, more or less the same one used for national elections.\nBritish MEPs are elected in a first-past-the-post system with one MEP per\ndistrict; nearly all other States have chosen a system with proportional\nrepresentation. But then in some countries (France, Italy) MEPs are allowed to\nbe a MNP as well, whilst in others they are not (Belgium, Netherlands).\n\nThe European Parliament is now working on a uniform election system for its\nown members, so that every candidate should have the same regulations to\ncomply with, regardless of the Member State (s)he wants to be elected for. I\nwould like to know what you people out there think of the following questions:\n\n1. Do you think it is necessary to have uniform regulations or should every\nMember State continue to use its own regulations (for European elections that\nis)?\n\n2. Do you think a system of majority voting should be implemented, with one or\nmore MEPs per district, or would you prefer a system with proportional\nrepresentation (for the whole of the Community or per state, per region, per\ndistrict?).\n\n3. Do you think the European Commission (or just its president) should be\ndirectly elected too, or should it be appointed by the European Parliament, or\nby the joint Member State governments as it is now?\n\n4. The Maastricht Treaty allows subjects of Member States to stand for\nelection in another Member State they are residing in. Do you think you would\nor could vote for a foreigner if his/her ideas appeal to you?\n\n5. Do you think MEPs should be allowed to be a member of a national parliament\nor a regional parliament too? Or a member of a national or regional government\nbody?\n\n6. The European Parliament now has meetings in both Strasbourg and Brussels.\nMEPs themselves are for a complete move to Brussels in great majority, but\npolitical compromises between the governments of the Member States stick to\nthe status quo. Do you approve of this or do you think the European Parliament\nshould meet in one city only, and if yes, which?\n\nPlease post your answers to eunet.politics, to which all followups are\nautomatically directed. If you do not have access to that group, please mail\nyour answer directly to me and I will post it for you.\n\nI hope many of you will take the time to post their views on this matter.
Perhaps I failed to make myself clear:  Minorities in the U.S.\n*correlate* with poverty.  This isn't good and we should address it,\nbut we shouldnt' ignore that minorities and poverty *do* tend to go\ntogether.\n\n      *Does* Vancouver have a consistantly poor population drawn along\nracial lines?  If it doesn't, then assumptions of being able to compare\nminority vs. majority in both cities is questionable at best.\n\n\n       If the *rate* of increase over a period of several years remains\nunchanged, or increases, I think it's not a far jump to say that the laws\nare not effective.  No, you can't sit down and say that things wouldn't\nhave been worse.  I don't have a crystal ball and neither do you.  However,\nthat road leads us to a place where it is impossible to critique *any*\naction.  If it gets down to be, "It might have been worse without them,"\nthen there *is* no valid objection, which I'm sure would amuse certain\npeople to no end.\n\n\n       So we've got a situation where we have several options:\n\n	1)  The crime rate decreased:  Obviously gun control worked.\n\n	2)  The crime rate remained the same:  It would have been worse\n	without gun control.\n\n	3)  The crime rate increased:  Perhaps the laws prevented an\n	even bigger increase.\n\n       Cute testing ground we've got.  All responses support the proposition\nthat gun control works.\n\n       The question is this:  Did Washington D.C. experiance an increase\nin its violent and/or gun crime rate which was greater than the pattern\nindicated prior to the implemented gun control laws.  If it did, then\nthe suggestion that the problem the gun control laws were designed to\n"control" did not exist in their entirety prior to the gun control laws.
Excuse me a moment when I laugh my head off...  I defy you to prove\nyour statement "damaged and screwed up".  You can't?  Oh dear.  Your\nargument, once again, Mr Logic(NOT!), falls flat on its face.\n\nTake a course in civil behaviour and logic.  Then come back and defend\nyour arguments.
Wrong.\n\n\nQuite true. And evolution made "decided" that homosexuality had a place,\notherwise it would have disappeared quite quickly. There are very few\nanimals which do not exhibit homosexual behavior.\nIt has been here before humans existed, and will be here after the\nhuman race has gone.\n\n\nQuite true. 2000 years of religious idiocy have not changed the nature\nof man.

No, what it means is that I, like a majority of environmental scientists/researchers,\nagree that El Nino/La Nina and the Southern Oscillations are the systems\ninvoloved in that climatic phenomena categorized by humans as a drought(1988).\n\nFurthermore, in response to an earlier message, the 1992 U.S. est. output of\nsulfur dioxide (20 mill. tons) was equivalent to the entire output by the recent\neruption of Mt. Pinautubo(Sp.).  Currently world carbon dioxide levels set at approx.\n360 ppm, in the past 120,000 years it has never gone above 280 (this info\nwas found using ice core samples from the joint French/Russian/U.S. Vostok\nproject).  Furthermore,  the background emmisions of chlorine compounds into\nthe atmoshpere is about 0.6 ppb annually, it now sits at 3.5.  This OVERWHELMING\ndata/info is found in the World Resources doc. published by Oxford University.\n\nThe ozone hole in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres keeps getting bigger\nand stickin' around longer whilst skeptics ponder how wrong or corrupt all this\ndata from government and international scientific institutions is.  It is a pity, that,\nif the skeptics are wrong and we base our complacency on their Limbaugh\npsycho babble, then we will find ourselves strapped by limited options with\nwhich to rectify the primal engineering of our industrial age.

Why are you all playing these pathetic number games?  The number of people\nshowing up at the MOW hardly constitutes the entire queer populace.  I doubt\nthat it constitutes more than a handful of us.  I'm queer, and I won't be\nthere, simply because I don't have the time or the transportation.  What the\nhell makes you think the participants in the MOW embody more than a minimum\nnumber?\n\nFace it, people, we're everywhere.  There are always more of us than you\nthink.  Our numbers are constantly GROWING, not diminishing...some of your\nchildren will grow up to join us.  Hell, some of MY children may grow up to\njoin us.  The best way to deal with this phenomenon is not to fear it and\nblind yourself to it, but to realize that you have nothing to fear.  We're\nnot perverts, we're not dangerous, we're just here, and we're human just\nlike you--er, most of you.\n\nIdiots like Cramer and Kaldis can rant all they like.  It won't do them one\niota of good.\n\nDrewcifer\n\nP.S.  I still can't get over the fact that some people actually believe that\nevery queer in the U.S. would show up at the MOW, and that these numbers are\nmeaningful.  And, come to think of it, what about those of us in OTHER\ncountries?  Tree.
I'm going to be mixing together here stuff from two of Ted Frank's\narticles, <1993Apr15.143623.25813@midway.uchicago.edu> (which was a\nresponse to me) and <1993Apr16.011455.20518@midway.uchicago.edu> (a\nresponse to Tim Smith)...\n\n\nEminent domain is a state-mandated transaction in which one party is\nrequired to sell a piece of property which it owns to another party,\nregardless of whether the first party wishes to sell at all, at a price\nwhich is set by the state.  I fail to see how this doctrine can be found\nin tort, bankruptcy or contract cases in general.  Well, okay, sort of\nin bankruptcy...\n\n*  *  *  *  *\n\n\nBang.  Here's one of the places where we widely diverge.  You believe\nthat the courts, in deciding a civil dispute between two parties, should\nconsider as a factor -- perhaps as an overriding factor -- issues which\nI believe the court should ignore as being irrelevant to the dispute.\n_Boomer v.  Atlantic Cement Co._ was an action brought by one party,\nBoomer, whose property rights were being violated on an ongoing basis by\nanother party, the Atlantic Cement Company.  The facts supported\nBoomer's contention that Atlantic Cement was wrongfully damaging his\nproperty, and Boomer asked the court to order Atlantic Cement to stop\ndoing so.  End of story.  There was no reason for the court to consider\nsuch issues as what a capitalistic society would want Atlantic Cement to\ndo or whether the cost of compliance was disproportionate to the damage\nfaced by the plaintiffs.  Those issues had nothing to do with the case\nbefore the court.\n\n\nI'd be up in arms?  Why do you assume that?  Quite the contrary, I'd\nprobably support the action, since it would be based on the same general\ndoctrine as the decision that I believe would have been correct in\n_Boomer_: the idea that people's property rights should not be violated\nfor reasons of economic efficiency.  In _Boomer_ it was Boomer's\nproperty rights which I believe the court should have protected; in the\nhypothetical EPA ruling you've presented, it's the American people's\ncollective property rights in a healthy physical environment.  What\ngood is cost-benefit ratio of 15+:1 if you wind up with cement dust in\nyour air?\n\n*  *  *  *  *\n\n\nYes.  So what?  The courts are supposed to protect the specific rights\nof individuals, not the general interests of some nebulous society.  If\nsociety can have its cement plant without violating anyone's rights,\nfine.  Otherwise society will somehow have to limp along with one less\ncement plant.  (See, Ted, I really _am_ a libertarian after all! :-)\n\n\n"One wants the legal regime to approximate the end result to begin with,\nin order to minimize the transactions costs."???  Which "one" are you\nspeaking of?  _I_ want the legal regime to protect people's rights.\nBesides, Coase's Theorem only has real application in the never-never\nland of perfectly rational actors.  In the real world (1) some people\nare going to be stubborn, ornery, spiteful or otherwise "irrational"\nfrom a economic point of view and (2) the purpose of the courts is to\nprotect their right to be so.  I don't care if you can show me logically\nthat your cattle are only doing $100 of damage to my property per head,\nso I should rationally sell you grazing rights to my land for, say, $150\nper head -- I still retain the right to tell you that I just plain don't\nwant any damned cattle on my property, not at any price.\n\n*   *   *   *   *\n\n\nLast question first: For the same reason as in contract law -- because\nto do so would come dangerously close to treading on the Thirteenth\nAmendment.\n\nAs to your "Then, by your argument, no tort plaintiff is ever made\nwhole, because the award of damages in involuntary" claim, you're at\nleast partially right.  Faced with situations in which the wrong has\nalready been done and the damage to the victim has already taken place\nand cannot be reversed or undone, courts will try to set an equitable\nprice tag on the loss suffered by the victim and require the wrongdoer\nto pay this price (rather than an inflated price which the victim might\nprefer).  In these cases, the "sale" has already taken place and is\nirreversible, and the court simply tries to ensure that a fair price is\npaid, under the doctrines that (a) only in certain circumstances should\neven a civil wrongdoer be forced to pay punitive or excessive prices and\n(b) even a genuine victim should not profit in an unjustified or\ninequitable manner from his victimhood.  Both of these doctrines may be\nworth discussing or debating elsewhere, but neither is relevant to cases\nlike _Boomer_ in which the wrongful act and the loss stemming from it\nare still in the future and _can_ be reversed/undone (i.e., prevented\nfrom happening at all) by order of the court.\n\nIn these types of cases, all the court has to do is require that the\npotential victim's property rights are protected until and unless he\nagrees to sell them at a mutually-acceptable price.  There is no need\nfor the court to guess at the equitable value of the loss and force both\nsides to accept its finding.  It can leave that operation up to the\nparties themselves.\n\n\nIn cases like _Boomer_, they're simply a cost of doing business.  The\nfact that the proprietors of the Atlantic Cement Co. got themselves into\na position in which they found themselves over this barrel is simply a\nresult of their own poor business decision to start up a cement plant\nwithout _first_ trying to negotiate with Boomer and everyone else whose\nproperty rights they'd be violating via the operation of their plant.\nThere's nothing punitive or unjust about it.\n\n\nAnybody who wants to commit a wrongful act in the future should be\nrequired to buy the right to do so from the victim, in advance.  And the\nseller should be allowed to set his or her price for the privilege.  No\ninjustice, no punitive damages.\n\n*   *   *   *   *\n\n\nDoesn't sound very much like a libertarian to me.  Libertarians tend to\nbelieve in the rights of individual people, not societies.\n\n*   *   *   *   *\n\n\nAs stated above, the tort was _ongoing_.  Atlantic Cement wanted to be\nable to _continue_ to violate Boomer's rights.  While the court may have\nbeen justified in setting an equitable price tag on the damage already\ncommitted, it had no reason and no need to set a price tag on the\n_future_ violations of Boomer's rights and to then force Boomer to sell\nat that price.
The word some sums it up, alot of scientist have concluded that without a\ndoubt Global Climate will/is occur(ring) and should be dealt with by source\nreductions.  This includes making sure that the "price" of fossil fuels\nreflects their "true costs".
First of all, I wouldn't have gone after the Davidians for a firearms\nviolation which I object to in the first place.

Having watched most of the televised trial, I can answer that\nwhen such statements were made by the defense atty, the prosecutor did\nobject, and the judge tended to sustain the ones that were obviously\nfalling under the "self-incrimination" type of objection.  There was\nquite a bit of meta-discussion during the trial over the use of graphic\nlanguage, with most folks asking the judge if she wanted to hear the\nexact language.  Practically every time the defense tried to get the\nplaintiffs to "self-incriminate" by asking them such questions, there\nwere objections and sustains.\n\n	At one point the defense managed to get in a quip about\n"solicitation for a felony" and the judge herself said "sustained"\nbefore the prosecutor could get the objection stated.

A very well put together post. I disagree with several key points, but the\npost is an excellent one with which to "engage in discourse":\n\n    >There has been much discussion recently about the right to\n    >freedom of association. Mr. Cramer and Mr. Ronzone appear to\n    >take an absolutist position on this right--that it is a\n    >fundamental human right, perhaps the fundamental human right,\n    >and that it supersedes other rights, such as the right to an\n    >equal opportunity.

But no, it can end, with once and for all\nrecognition of these rights.

Says who? Why can mon & pop have FOA, but IBM be forced, and force is\nthe correct word here, to have REO?

And on what\nbasis does the FOA of the landlord "disappear"?\n\nIt seems that vague terms like "no contact with tenants" suffice.\n\nWell, I think FOA is one our most important rightts (in the top 2-3), and by\ngolly, if the State is going to make it suffer, I sure would like to see the\nheinous crime that justifies the removal of this right.\n\nI don't think "no contact" with the tenats is even a crime, much less something\nthat should cause severe interference with important rights.\n\n    >I suspect that the majority of the people in this country\n    >agree with my position on these extreme cases, particularly\n    >if they are presented in this manner.

I assume that when you say "publicly owned", you are talking about those\nquasi-State companys that do NOT have shareholders.\n\nThe companies on the Fortune 500, for example, are all privately owned. They\ncan give you a list of all of their owners.

And that is self-destructive of the whole argument, because it\nis based only on might makes right. Sort of like saying, "nobody has a right\nto live", whereupon I whip out a gun and shoot you dead -- end of argument.\n\n\n-- \nThere are actually people that STILL believe Love Canal was some kind of\nenvironmental disaster.

I think a nice large group of skinheads\nin a locked basement for 12 hours will wonderfully educate you.\n\nAfter all, as you don't believe in Freedom Of Asscoiation, you can't\ncomplain can you.\n\nBloody turdlet ...\n\n\n-- \nThere are actually people that STILL believe Love Canal was some kind of\nenvironmental disaster. Weird, eh?
When you buy insurance where you live, it is based on the local rates.\nTourists coming from, say, Utah will find that there is a difference\nin what their insurance will cover FOB Provo and what they get stuck\nwith at Lenox Hill or Mount Sinai if they fall ill in the Big Apple.\n\n\nIt would depend on where you live, downtown Toronto or Mile 101,\nBritish Columbia (just like Cheyenne, WY vs. Boston, MA).  Again,\ngeography rears its ugly head.\n\nSince our health care providers are private, they depend on an\nadequate market size in order to sustain enough business.  Since\nour health care professionals have equivalent take-home pay to \ntheir American cousins, it's not that they're being paid too\nlittle to provide services.\n\n\nI have only hear Americans say that it's illegal ... but I could be\nwrong, just have never heard it from a Canadian source.  our private\ninsurance has recently balked in Quebec when the Liberals proposed\nprivatizing some aspects of routine care ... also, our insurance was\nput in place when no NDP (Labour) governments were in power in any\nprovince to derail the effort 'cos they wanted real socialized\nmedicine.\n\n\nNo, it is optional ... as it is optional for doctors to accept it.\nThere are isolated religeous communities in particular that ask for\nexemptions (and one e-mail from a Christian Scientist in Edmonton\nverified for me that it is indeed negative option).  I guess that you\ncan argue that there is a right to having a particular insurance, but\nso far I've not come across that up north ... and I take pains to keep\ntabs with news from home.\n\n\nBelieve me, they probably had orgasms when they figured that out.  And\naccording to my sister the yuppie, they pat themselves on the back to\nthe point of ungraciousness at Chamber of Commerce luncheons.\n\n\nI actually have doubts that any new ones have emerged since WW I ...\nno, scratch that ... there are a few in Western Canada, and *quite* \na few in Quebec as part of the post-1980 Quebec Miracle (out with the\nnationalism, in with the French capitalism).  La Groupe des Cooper-\nantes built a new tower by the Eaton('s) store at Les Terraces, and if\nyou were able to catch Urban Angel on CBS's Crimetime you'd see it as\nthe well-lit one with double-turrets at the top.  As for Ontario,\nwhich still dominates and anchors business up north ...\n\nCanada is a very old-money kind of place, and the 1989 Free Trade\nAgreement saw a lot of odd alliances: labour unions and establishment\nold money who wanted to preserve their traditional monopolies on one\nside, and entrepreneurs and internationally oriented businesses and\nprofessionals on the other.  The final Trudeau administration and\nthe first Mulroney government had a high percentage of nouveaux\nriches who knew what it was like to make your own money, and that\nmotivated the McDonald Commission under Trudeau which set up Brian's\ninitiative (Macaroni was against free trade 'til he did a head count\nof his caucus after the 1984 election).\n\n\nWell, you have to realize that in our society that's like saying\nthat "it's not really national defence" because you can't hire\nyour own Rambo squad instead or even opting out as a pacifist.\n(BTW, there are always pacifists in the news arguing about their\nportion of taxes, but never people arguing over health insurance\nalternatives ... and we're talking about a press that is hostile\nto whomever is in government, regardless of party; one of their\nfew redeeming characteristics, it seems (-;).\n\n\nThe only way to hit at the Canadian system is transient periods of\nhigh demand, which is more a function of the doctors monopoly's tight\nfist on the licencing.  An obvious difference is that in such a\ntransient period, the rationing is of the nature of a mob battling\nover Cabbage Patch Dolls^TM as we've seen recently as opposed by\nrationing by ability to pay ... but the former is a *transient*\nsituation and if a large body of insured patients were to deluge the\nCalifornia health infrastructure, the same would result --- rationing\namong the insured population.  With smaller markets, there is much\nless flexibility when dealing with our insured population than\nCalifornia (which by the way, has 1/3rd more people than Canada in a\nMUCH more dense area).  So he is correct in that the resources are\nfixed (for a particular time window, or as a function of the doctors\nmonopoly licencing according to the market steady state) in either\ncase.  As for being "refused treatment" the government of the day\nwould be shredded to tatters if something like that were to happen;\nCanadians can be geographically bad, too, not realizing that their\nhealth care is private while only their insurance isn't ... too many\npeople have bought into socialist trype that we have socialized\nmedicine.\n\n\nRight, as I've pointed out above ...\n\n\nEither way, the transient situations are hard to deal with since the\nchanges in the private medical care resource take place at a slower\nrate than the ability of people to fall sick esp. in the light of\ndisasters (e.g., Chernobyl) or bad luck (a sudden wave of heart\ndisease). A doctor needs 4-6 years of training, plus internship \nand specialty training.\n\n\nThat's why I've argued for deductible and copayments rather than\neducation, which is what most Canadian fiscal conservatives are\narguing for (the leftists?  "Ah, just let 'em spend!" --- yeah,\nright!).  Also, note that only a few provinces cover prescriptions\nunder some high dollar threshold ... in most, it's your private\ninsurance that covers it just like in the U.S.  Still, it all\nadds up in the OECD measures.\n\n\nWe get the Sabres' feed as a replacement game on ESPN tonight (the\nDevils' local metro NY coverage supplants the main ESPN game).\n\n\nYeah, it's a sad story and Saskatchewan Tory leader Grant Devine\nhas been on a nonstop PR campaign to save his sorry butt.  The\nSask NDP have taken a neo-conservative turn like Hawke, Gonzalez\nand Mitterand did.\n\n\nThe medical IRA would have limited use, as you'd need a lower\ncatastrophic threshold else there'd still be a drain on the public\npurse if someone exhausts their IRA.  Also, Singapore has a much\nmore autocratic mentality which has seaped down into its masses\n(if Singaporeans that I've met are any indication ... I don't\nmean any disprespect here) where they'd let you just die.\n\n\nThat's true ... the question is how much leeway is there between\nthe U.S. approach and the second-most capitalist approaches of\nCanada, France and Germany.\n\n\nYes, many ... and pretty close to a lot of smaller towns or not too\nfar from a bigger town.  Just take a look at a detailed atlas ...\nor better, take a flight from Pittsburgh or Rochester to Toronto.\nMy first time across Lake Ontario to NYC, I was amazed by the\nincrease in density ... and the Toronto region is the densest \nin all of Canada.\n\n\nIt's about time!  I've ragged on my own doctor friends as to why they\ndon't invest in their own private practices ... in the end, it's their\nmoney.  But they choose to spend it on America's Cup pipedreams, and\nthat's none of my business.  As for "provincially owned" ... for sure\nit's against the law in Canada for governments to be directly involved\nin the provision of health care except in the military or native reser-\nvations.  What that term actually means is that the facility gets by\non public grants to meet shortfall from *lack of use* ... no kidding.\nMedical practice itself is much more conservative up north.  My own\nbest friend did two clerkships at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN,\nand is no stranger to high tech medicine ... but his boat comes first.\n\n\nNo, it's probably socialist whiners who are offended that we have\nprivate practices ... and always have.  They can all take cash\nanyways ... so why not have a particular facility?  The Canadian\nbig government mentality often imagines government where it does\nnot even exist ...\n\nSince the French and Germans have become more entrepreneurial and less\nlaidback without sacrificing their culture and values, then Canadians\ncan do the same.  As I've pointed out above, the law states that it is\nillegal for the *government* to provide any health services except for\nthe military and natives.\n\nLook, nobody stopped the clinic when they planned on the MRI ...\nnobody stopped them when they bought it.  Nobody seems to be stopping\nthem from using it, either.  Much ado about nothing.  Thank goodness\nthat hockey playoffs have started ...\n\n\nI'm certain there is exaggeration somewhere, because the GAO study\nof Canada cited often on USENET did not find access to MRI to be a\nproblem.  I'll bet the doctor is relying on people having listened \nto American trash talk on cable so that he can puff his chest a bit.\nThere are already a few treatment regimens for knee injuries without\nrelying on MRI ... unfortunately, I've had a few. )-;  And I'm not\na banker.

No, this is not true. the CNN pictures show two sites clearly and a third is\nbarely distinguished. \n\nIf you have a tape you should note that there are two towers at either end\nof the building, a big one and a little one. What appears to be merely a \nlong shot of the big tower with the tank in front is in fact the little\ntower. You can tell beacuse the flag in the foreground switches sides from the\nright of the picture to the left.\n\nThe third site is visible as the flames clearly come from a point obscured by\nthe small tower. You need a tape and a good slow motion video to see this.
From article <1qvampINNmhf@darkstar.UCSC.EDU>, by stephen@orchid.UCSC.EDU:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI believe that this is not contradictory on the basis that\nthe quality of media reporting varies greatly based on the\nsubject at hand.  The media has proven itself very accurate\nis the areas of presenting raw, undisputed data.  One good\nexample would be the weather page in which high and low\ntemperatures of the previous day for a large number of\nlocations are posting.  There is little evidence to show\nthat they are in error.\n\nThe American media has failed us in its analysis of complex\nevents, however.  I'm sure that we can come up with many\nnews stories that have left us angry because so many facts\nhave been ommitted.  Cases that come to mind are the\ninvasion of Panama, the war with Iraq, the disaster in Waco,\nthe issues surrounding the acceptance of gays into the\nmilitary, the war on drugs, and many others.\n\nThe story that you bring to light was regarding the new\nsex survey.  While I'm sure that due to lazyness some of\nthe data was ommitted from the article, I would venture to\nguess that the data that was presented did not deviate\nfrom the survey.  I do, however, think that it would be\nfolly to have blind faith in a single newswriter's\nanalysis of this data.  In this particular case, there was\nlittle analysis, and the reader was left to draw his/her\nown convictions.\n\nMany netters, Mr. Cramer included, often forget that the\nAmerican media are merely a number of businesses, who's\npurpose in life is to make money for their owners and\nstockholders.  Revenues come largely from advertisers\nwho merely want maximum useful exposure per dollar.  The\nmedia is like fast food; the quality of the food (or of\nthe reporting) will improve only if the customers demand\nas such.  Otherwise, it is business as usual.

Frankly, I'm sick of being lied to.  It was bad before Clinton,\n      and now it's worse.

"\n\n      Now, I hear Ricks ( and REno ) claiming that this was just \n      "another incremental step in pressure".  More bullshit.\n\n      Why did they pick 6 AM  Monday morning?

And so, to protect the\n         the fireman, we didn't allow the engines to enter until\n         it was safe "\n\n     WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?   " YES, WE HAVE NO BANANAS?

From article <pdb059-220493112512@kilimanjaro.jpl.nasa.gov>, by pdb059@ipl.jpl.nasa.gov (Paul Bartholomew):\n\n#> A very well put together post.

Paul, you have handled this so well,\nI think that you could write ballot materials.\n\n\nNo, don't stop!\n\n#> Right to Equal Opportunity (lets call it REO) involves coercion in all cases\n#> (by definition).\n\n\nGood question.  It just depends.  How's that for an answer?  :-)\nSeriously, I believe that it depends on wether or not you are\ntalking about a governmental employer or not.  In this case, I\nbelieve that there should be absolutely no discrimination,\ndirect or indirect, period.  I feel this way not because it would\noffend my moral sensibilities (which it of course would), but\nbecause the government is a coercive entity which we cannot\nescape.  It boggles my mind that in my lifetime, there were\n"whites only" drinking fountains in some parks, but no fountains\nfor others, yet the taxes garnished to support those fountains\ncertainly were not applied to "whites only."  In essence, we\ncannot escape the coercive state.  Even Randy Weavers have to pay\nproperty tax.  On the other hand, private employers are not a\nmonopoly, and their businesses should be run by them, and not by\nthe government, unless they elect to turn their affairs over to\nthat government.\n\n#> Why?

Should the government intervene?

This is not a "studies", but a study.  Other studies, including the\njust-published "Janus Report", give very different figures.

Why not try to eliminate discrimination from existing laws instead of\ntrying to add discrimination that favors your group.
Who said it was dead. It seems to be alive and well here on the net.
A search for illegally held weapons (IF there were any, no evidence yet\nproduced to this effect) does not justify firing into a house with\nwomen and children, either. It also does not justify shooting first\nwithout identifying oneself (the ATF and FBI have done this before, so\ndon't say they haven't, please) or producing a warrant.\n\nGuess it depends on whose story one believes, huh?\n\n\nWhich "others" are we talking about here?\n\n\n"Sub lethal"? Excuse me, but those people are dead!!!\n\n\nEvidence? So far the FBI has produced none. Don't hold your breath.\n\n\nOnly a few of those being held in chains and s(hackles are wanted . \nThe rest are being held for the crime of being "material witnesses".\n\n\nIt was not the Feds decision to make, but the firefighters.\n\n\nThis is true of ANY answer to a call for help from a fire department by\nANY citizen. Since fire departments do answer calls that "deprive \nresources that might be needed elsewhere" it is not a valid reason for\nnot calling them.\n\nFurther, since the Davidians had not been found guilty of any crime in\na court of law, they are subject to the same protection as any other\ncitizen. And las far as I know, even criminals in prison are not left to \nburn to death in a fire.\n\n\nI guess this is a matter of religious faith with you? The government\nsays it, so it must be so? Or haven't you been reading this thread well \nenough to notice that some of us here don't beleive their story?\n\n\nPatients in psychiatric hospitals are not left to die in fires, either.\nBesides, as I explained, some of us here believe their distress might\nhave been genuine. Are you SO certain it wasn't?\n\n\nThere is no evidence that the Davidians committed human sacrifice \neither before of after the initial raid. And self-defense is not\nmurder.\n\n\nHe did not say it was deliberate. Accidents do not require conspiracy\ntheories, only wanton disregard for human life. The initial raid alone\n(agents firing blind into walls against all standards of law enforce-\nment procedure) proves they did not mind killing people.\n\n\nNo one here is "supporting Koresh". We are opposing the illegal use of\nexcessive violence by our government against our citizens. That is all.\n\n\nA society that believes it is OK to terrorize people for their religious\nviews will destroy itself in due time. It is the feds who disrupted the\n"fabric of society" in Waco, not Koresh. It is the feds who forced a\nnightmare onto the people of Mount Carmel.\n\n\nOn what basis do you assume we haven't? Don't you really mean\n"It would be a good thing if people drew the same conclusions from\nhistory that I do?" :-)\n\n\n"Militant" implies acts of aggression against one's neighbors. The\nDavidians left their neighbors alone.\n\n.religious heretics who left to set up such a community\n\nSo what? The Mormons were considered a "cult" for years, and were chased\nout of one place after another on much the same thinking as you are\nadvocating. When they finally got to "set up a community" they left\npeople alone. So far Americans haven't been put to the sword by Mormon\nhordes crying to avenge Joseph Smith. :-)\n\n\nIt doesn't mean they won't either. Anyway, the whole purpose of a \nsystem of laws is to punish people for what they DO, not what they\nMIGHT do. \n\n\n"Telling" is not the same as "forcing". When the police knock at my\ndoor, I cannot make them go away by changing the channeI. As for Pat\nand friends, I don't even WATCH their channel, since I am an atheist.\nSo far, not watching them tell me what to do hasn't gotten me killed :-)\n\n\nRight now, the only people sticking guns in anyone's faces is the \ngovernment. And they are trying very hard to run my life. Or \nhaven't you noticed?\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Oh..\njust a note, my usually poor typing is made even more dificult by the \nsmall keyboard and mutiple connections I am piped through in order\nto access news while here in DC.\n\nI'm really not trying to irritate the spelling mavens :-)\n\nLUX ./. owen
That study which was in the NEJM, I think, noted that the frequency\nof heart surgery on patients over seventy increase with income in\nCalifornia (I guess richer people have more heart disease in \nCalifornia -) ) whereas the frequency of surgery on patients over\nseventy in Canada was relatively uniform across income distribution.\nHeart surgery was more frequent in California, but mortality and\noutcomes were essentially the same.\n\n\nThe only potential problem I see with the private MRI facilty in Calgary is the\nself-referral problem to the facility for the doctors who have a financial\ninterest in it, which is basically unethical...but in Canada because\nof our small population, there is likely only to be a few private\nfacilities involving only a small number of doctors,\nand thus I don't think the self-referral problem, which is an epidemic in the\nUS, could ever get out of hand here.\n\n\nIt is an experiment that will be certainly be watched carefully.\n\n\nWhat likely happened is the sponsors of the private MRI which include\ndoctors anticipated that Alberta would need more MRI's, and instead\nof waiting for the health planners to realize they needed another\none or two, saw a business opportunity...where they would have a\nsecure business from the public insurance side of things, and they\ncould supplement people and businesses who want to pay cash.
Not this again.
Good grief!  I do believe that for once you may have an argument which may\nbe discussed intelligently!\n\nI guess that you are a person who dislikes contact with people of ethnic\nminority.  However, your argument again falls flat on its face.  You state\nthat you, under an anti-discrimination bill, would be forced to associate\nwith others [homosexuals, I assume] against your will.  How do you know that\nyou do not associate with them now, except they may be closeted?   Would you\nlike to change your argument to read "forced to associate with truthfully\nhomosexual people against my will"?  You have no proof that anyone you\nnow know may not be homosexual and this punches a large hole in your\nargument.  Is it your belief that a homosexual comes in only one flavour (sic)\nand that is the camp mincing type?  Prove it.  You cannot.\n\nI must admit though, that it looks as if you actually thought about your response\nthis time instead of just raving.
THE WHITE HOUSE\n\n                    Office of the Press Secretary\n\n______________________________________________________________\nFor Immediate Release                             April 20, 1993     \n\n                       REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT\n           DURING PRESENTATION OF TEACHER OF THE YEAR AWARD\n	     \n                           The Rose Garden \n\n\n1:25 P.M. EDT\n\n\n	     THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Please be seated.  I \nwant to say, first, how delighted I am to be here with Secretary \nRiley and with Senator Graham.  The three of us served as governors \ntogether during the 1980s when we worked constantly on strategies to \nimprove our schools, when we led often difficult and long efforts to \nupgrade the standards in American education and to improve the \nquality of instruction our children were receiving.  \n	     \n	     There were no two governors whom I admired more during \nthat period than the two who now stand on this stage with the Teacher \nof the Year.  And I think both of them would join me in saying that, \nafter all the testimony has been heard and all the bills have been \npassed and the funds have been raised and allocated, it all comes \ndown to what happens between the teacher and the students in the \nclassroom.\n	     \n	     That's why today's ceremony honoring the National \nTeacher of the Year is so important.  Tracey Leon Bailey is one \nrecognition all across our country for highly advanced and innovative \nscience programs.  He's developed and introduced into Florida's \nclassrooms cutting-edge programs in molecular biology and DNA \nfingerprinting -- subjects usually taught only in college and, I \nmight add, probably only dimly understood here in the Nation's \nCapital.  (Laughter.)\n	     \n	     Within three years of being hired by a satellite high \nschool, Mr. Bailey's institution had one of the strongest science \nprograms in the entire state of Florida, and it won numerous national \nand international awards.  These advanced programs aren't just for a \nfavored few.  Tracey Bailey has inspired all kinds of students, \nincluding those previously known as low-achieving or at-risk to reach \nfor excellence and to attain it.  This is what our students need and \nwhat our country needs. \n	     \n	     Today, we know that a good future with high wages and \nrich opportunities rests on the foundation of quality education for a \nlifetime.  The basics aren't enough anymore.  All our kids need \ncompetence in math and science and advanced problem-solving.  That's \nwhy Tracey Bailey's accomplishments are so important and why I am so \npleased and proud to participate in recognizing and honoring these \naccomplishments. \n	     \n	     Tracey, you represent the best in the United States.  \nI'm glad to recognize you today and to formally present you with this \nApple Award as the Teacher of the Year for 1993.  (Applause.)  \n	     \n	     MR. BAILEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.  It is indeed a \ngreat honor and a tremendous responsibility to represent the nation's \n2.5 million teachers.  And we appreciate the support that you have \nshown for education, and we're looking forward to working with you to \nhelp redesign and improve our nation's schools.  \n	     \n	     We know that the quality of our children's education \nwill directly impact the future of our economic and social landscape \nin the years to come.  And we thank you so much for your continued \nsupport and commitment to our children's education.  Thank you again.  \n(Applause.)\n\n	     THE PRESIDENT:  In closing, I would like to also welcome \nthe education leaders in Florida who are here, those representing the \nnational education groups who have also come.  I'd like to recognize \nTracey's congressman, Representative Jim Bacchus in the back, himself \na great advocate of education.  And I'd like to remind all of you \nthat the ultimate purpose of the National Teacher of the Year Award \nis to find a way for the rest of us to express our appreciation to \npeople all across this country who give their lives to our children, \nall of the teachers of this country who get up every day and do their \nbest to try to advance the cause of learning for all the children of \nAmerica.  They are, in so many ways, our most important public \nservants.\n	     \n	     Thank you very much.  (Applause.)
never heard of arguement by absurdity, eh no?  Also called\nsarcasm.  The usual procedure is to accept some part of the\n'oppositions' arguement and run with it until one goes\nbeyond 'rational thought' and then ring the changes.\n\nz.B. The idea of a minimum wage is considered a good one.\nAnd in these times of economic difficulty, the Washington\nlegislature is propossing to raise the State MinWage from\n$4.25 (the federal level) to $4.90 (fifteen cents over\nOregon's).\n	It would seem to me that this increase does not\nkeep pace with inflation, that the minimum wage should be\nto $6.08 by my figures, so it is proposed that we raise\nthe minimum wage to $6.50 per hour by 1 July and then give\na 10% cost of living increase every 4 July.\n\nand anyone who doesn't like it is obviously a country club\nrepublican getting rich off the exploitation of poor people.\n\nchus\npyotr
[Note: This is a repost of my earlier response to Mr. Starr,\nwhich was not properly formatted.  Apologies to those who've\nseen the following before:]\n\nTo explain my position on the "War On Drugs," I offer this:\n\nDrugs And Crime: A New Approach\n\nby Ken Barnes\n\n\nGiven that:\n\n1. The trade in illegal drugs is responsible for \nmuch of the crime which afflicts our nation.\n\n2. People who want drugs (particularly people who \nare predisposed to addiction) will find a way to get \nthem, whether or not they are legally available.\n\n3. Despite current law enforcement efforts, drugs \nare readily available to those who want them.\n\n4. Addiction to drugs, both legal and illegal, is \nresponsible for a significant drain on the productive \nresources of our country, and this occurs in a variety \nof ways, from the cocaine-addicted babies who are \nunable to learn, to the spread of disease among \naddicts, to the tragic consequences of alcohol abuse \nand tobacco smoking.\n\n5. A general economic principle of government is \nthat whatever is subsidized you get more of, and \nwhatever is taxed you get less of.  To be most \neffective in confronting the nation's drug problem, \nsome way must be found to utilize these additional \npowers of government to make drug dealing and drug use \nless attractive.\n\nWhile this country's current efforts to combat \nlegal drugs have succeeded in some respects, (there is \na greater awareness of the health consequences of \nsmoking, and designated-driver programs have helped \nreduce drunk driving, for example), the same cannot be \nsaid for the "war" on illegal drugs.  There remains a \ncore group of illegal drug users which support \ninternational networks of smugglers, pushers, growers, \nprocessors, kingpins, and gangsters.  These networks \nand their "marketing activities," which include drive-\nby shootings, corrupting law enforcement authorities, \nand smuggling weapons, are directly or indirectly \nresponsible for a large proportion of the crimes \ncommitted in our country every day.\n\nClearly, illegal drugs and rising crime are \nlinked.  It takes only a moment's reflection to \nrecognize how they are linked.  The link is money.  As \nwith this country's failed effort to prohibit alcohol \nconsumption, a black market has been created, in which \ngreedy local monopolies, like the gangsters of a \nbygone era, have profited enormously from their \nillegal trade.  The victims of this trade include not \nonly the innocent people unfortunate enough to be \ncaught in the crossfire, but, I would argue, the drug \nusers themselves.\n\nWere it not for the black market, and the violent \nmonopoly of the drug lords, drug users might not be \nthe thieves, robbers, prostitutes and murderers they \nhave become in order to pay the high prices the drug \nlords demand.  In the absence of the drug lords, most  \nwould be, I believe, simply people with a problem, \neither a moral problem_or_a medical problem, but_not_a \ncriminal problem.\n\nLet me be clear however, I am_not_advocating that \nwe let the criminals who have been preying on our \nsociety for these many years of Prohibition off the \nhook.  On the contrary, the new approach I advocate is \none which would not result in either the government or \nprivate industry getting into the business of \npromoting crack cocaine, or any other presently \nillegal drug for that matter.  Neither is it an \napproach which sees law abiding citizens handing over \nmore and more of their freedom and privacy in an \neffort to track down illegal drug users, until "the \nland of the free and the home of the brave" looks like \na police state.\n\nHere then is my proposal:\n\n1. Possession and use of all presently illegal \ndrugs is decriminalized, but buying and selling them \nremains illegal.  'Potheads' can grow their own \nmarijuana (as many already do today), other drug users \ncan legally import their poison of choice as long as \nthey pay the tariffs, and a barter economy of drug \nexperimenters develops.\n\n2. Because of the barter economy which supplies \nthe drug users, the black market profits that have so \nenriched the drug lords dwindle.  If these drugs can \nbe obtained for 'free' or next to nothing, why buy \nthem?  Nevertheless, there will be those who will seek \nto sell these "noncommercial" drugs even at relatively \nlow prices.  Therefore,\n\n3. Law enforcement activity is concentrated on \nthose individuals who continue to buy and sell, and \nalso on the crimes committed by drug users too poor to \nafford even low prices.  But here is where the \nstrategy begins to differentiate between the drug \ndealers, the victimizers, and the drug users, their \nvictims.\n\n4. Upon arrest for_any_crime,_suspects are \npermitted to choose whether or not they will undergo a \ndrug test.  Those who choose to cooperate are informed \nthat upon conviction for the crime they are accused \nof, if they are found to be a drug user, they will be \ninstitutionalized until they are clean, and only then \nwill they begin to serve their sentence.  If they \nchoose to cooperate and are already drug-free, they \ncan begin to serve their sentence right away.  Those \nwho choose not to undergo the drug test and are \nconvicted face stiffer fines and serve longer \nsentences.\n\n5. Institutionalization of drug using criminals \nserves several purposes:\n\nDrug using criminals (and this includes drunk \nand/or 'stoned' drivers) are separated from their \nsources of supply, thus reducing the total number of \ndrug users in society at large, and consequently \ndecreasing the demand for drugs on the street, putting \nmore of the remaining drug dealers out of business.\n\nInstitutionalization provides an incentive for \ndrug using criminals to straighten themselves out, \nbefore becoming part of the general prison population.\n\nWhile helping protect society from crime, \ninstitutionalization could also serve to deter drug \nusers from becoming criminals, since drug using \ncriminals, unlike other criminals, would be delayed \nprior to serving their sentences by the additional \ntime it takes for them to sober up.\n\nInstitutionalization of drug using criminals \nseparate from the general prison population would also \nprovide a closely monitored pool of addicts who could \nvolunteer for research studies of new techniques and \ntreatments for addictive disease, with the potential \nto benefit both themselves and others.\n\n6. Dealers in illegal drugs are generally not \ndrug users themselves, and this is particularly true \nof the drug bosses or kingpins running large illicit \norganizations.  Under this proposal, dealers would be \nmore readily identifiable, since upon arrest they \nwould presumably pass the drug test, or else decline \nto take it in order to avoid having to explain why \nthey are in possession of drugs when it is apparent \nthey do not use them.  Declining to take the test, \nthey would of course face stiffer penalties.  While \neach case of attempted sale of a noncommercial drug \nwould have to stand on own its merits, the outcome of \na suspect's drug test could provide additional \nevidence for the prosecution.\n\n7. Just as cigarette taxes have contributed to \nthe decline of smoking in our country by making \ncigarettes more costly while at the same time \nproviding revenue for anti-smoking campaigns, \nnoncommercial drugs should be taxed, and the money \ngenerated should be used to combat their use.  \nEnforcement of this tax should be on a voluntary basis \nhowever, and should not be used as an excuse to \ninfringe on the rights and privacy of noncommercial \ndrug users, since to do so would have the effect of \nreintroducing Prohibition.\n\nInstead, drug users will be encouraged to pay the \ntax by reminding them that if untaxed drugs are ever \nfound in their possession during the course of routine \npolice operations, they will be required to pay the \ntax immediately or else forfeit their untaxed drugs to \nbe destroyed.  If drug dealers are found to be selling \nnoncommercial drugs on which taxes have not been paid, \nthey will face additional prosecution for evading the \ntax.  The strategy of adding tax evasion to drug \ndealing charges is already in use in some \njurisdictions, but its effectiveness is currently \nlimited by the illegality of drug possession.\n\nRevenue from drug possession taxes and import \ntariffs would be used to fund anti-drug advertising \ncampaigns, and provide support to private sector drug \ntreatment programs for those unable to afford \ntreatment.\n\n8. Taxpayer subsidies to all drug producers must \nbe ended.  Federal support of tobacco farming is both \nimmoral and wasteful in this era of tight budgets, and \nthe marijuana crops grown illicitly on federal lands \nin many states must likewise be eliminated.\n\nWhile my proposal would have the effect of \npermitting the use of what are now illegal drugs, it \nwould hold the users of all drugs responsible for \ntheir actions, and I believe, would reduce the harm \ndrugs have on our society, particularly the crime \ncaused by the illegal drug trade.  So long as we \nremain a free nation, with relatively porous borders, \nand freedom for our citizens to travel, we will always \nhave a drug problem.  Whether it takes the form of \nheroin addicts dying in abandoned buildings, drunk \ndrivers killing and maiming others on our streets, or \nemphysema patients struggling for breath after a \nlifetime of smoking, the results are the same: \nneedless suffering and death.  As a society we must \nrecognize that while our society permits us to harm \nourselves with drugs, as we are already doing \n(regardless of the drug laws), we must take a stand \nagainst the harm that drugs and drug users cause to \nothers.  We must particularly oppose the vicious and \nviolent cartels which prey on the weakness of drug \nusers.  By taking the profits out of their deadly \ntrade, my proposal goes a long way towards shutting \ndown these powerful criminal organizations.\n\nThe question of whether drug use is a moral or \nmedical problem depends on which group of drug users \nyou're talking about.  Different drugs have different \neffects, and some are more addictive than others.  The \naddictiveness of a drug also often varies between \nindividuals, and so we have some people who can drink \nalcohol in moderation, while others find they cannot \nresist the bottle.  Nicotine, which former Surgeon \nGeneral C. Everett Koop declared to be as addicting as \nheroin, is a legal drug with known harmful effects, \nand while some people can stop smoking by willpower \nalone, others continue to smoke even after treatment \nfor lung cancer.\n\nFor those individuals who can stop taking drugs \non their own, we may argue that because they have \nchosen to use them, this represents a moral failure on \ntheir part, or an unwillingness to face the \ndifficulties of life.  But for the addicts, while they \nmay have chosen to use drugs the first time, by the \ntime they discover their addiction it is too late.  We \ncannot hold them responsible for their disease, any \nmore than we would blame someone who is drowning for \nan inability to swim.  Perhaps they should have known \nnot to go near the water, or perhaps someone should \nhave warned them of the danger, but in their present \ncircumstances warnings will not help.  Neither does it \nhelp for the drug dealers on the shore to be tossing \nthem weights.

CHEERS Brandon.  That's the best suggestion I have seen that.  !!!
:      Here's a hypothetical question...  If Clayton said something like "all\n: those niggers are really stupid."  (Please don't be offended, I'm not racist\n: but merely using an example of Clayton's malign logic).  And then said he\n: read a report that a lot of blacks in inner cities dropped out of school, I\n: bet he wouldn't have your support.  Yet he can claim that all homosexuals are\n: dishonest, evil, lying child molesters without *PERSONALLY* having a single\n: homosexual friend or acquaintance and you'll sit there and support him.\n\n:      God created a place for bigots.  It's called Hell and Clayton is going\n: to burn there for a long time.  I pray for him to find in his heart the\n: Christian values he espouses so that he can learn to love his gay brothers\n: and sisters, because anyone with so much hatred in his soul coulld never\n: be righteous.\n\nThere is a difference between supporting Claytons opinions and supporting\nhis right to speak.  I want you to know that you cannot educate and/or\nelevate ones understanding by calling him names.  Clayton has an opinion\nwhich in his mind is as valid as any opinion anyone else on the net has.\nIf you were to walk up to black person to talk about blacks in the inner\ncity and began the conversation with "Those niggers in th.......".  You\nwould lose the attention of that black person by the time you spoke your\nsecond word.  All name calling and derisive remarks do is turn off the\naudience you are trying to address.  Clayton is guilty of that and as\nsuch has distracted attention away from his message to bits and pieces\nof his conversation.  I don't understand why people want to repeat his\nmistakes!
But it IS made false by your ridiculous leap of logic from "monogamous\nhomosexual male sex is so rare" (which is a load of horseshit--as\nproportionately many queers are monogamous as hets, and the ones who aren't\nuse condoms, for the most part) to "for practical purposes, homosexuality\nspreads AIDS."  No.  Unprotected sex with an infected partner spreads AIDS. \nThese "practical purposes" you speak of are obviously the purposes of\nspreading homophobia, which leads me to an interesting truth: "Cramer\nspreads hate."  Isn't that nice?\n\n\n\nYou mean, "Typical homosexual response to Clayton E. Cramer."  I think any\nhuman being would react that way to someone as contemptibly hateful as you,\nactually.  I seem to hear the same sort of thing coming from your posts, you\nknow....\n\n ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nPlanning to make this a complete sentence anytime soon?\n\nDrewcifer
You know, you have a point here, but don't stop with African Americans...\nWhen I was in high school in the early 1980s, on various occasions I had\nknives pulled on me, had friends who were stabbed, and I was beaten up\nrepeatedly by those that couldn't accept me as different.  And don't\nlet the teachers off the hook either.  On many many occasions, there\nwere teachers that either resented me or were too scared out of their\nwits by the bullies to even stop the people who attacked me and they\nwould just watch quietly...  All of this was in a nice white middle\nclass high school.  In fact, we were so nice and white that we made\nsure that the one black kid in my class was unable to go to the prom\nwith his white girlfriend...  This isn't a race thing, it's the\nway public schools seem to be run...\n\nI'd hate to be in high school right now...  At least I didn't have\nto deal with guns, just the roving psycho-drug-dorks and the jocks-\nwithout-a-future-but-with-plenty-of-testosterone...\n\nI'd separate everyone who wants to learn from these assholes...  But hey,\nthe valuelessness of learning and glorification of jocks is an American\ntradition, you think anything is going to change?  If you have kids,\ntake 'em out of the public school system and educate them yourself...\nThat's what I'll do if I ever have them...  I wouldn't wish what I went\nthrough upon any kid...  Maybe on some of their parents though...
No we don't.  They might be zealous, and maybe the bureau shouldn't\nexist by some people, but they ARE NOT NAZIS.\n\nWhy do people toss around the Nazi label so easily?
Is this an arguement against or for?  Or simply a statement of agreeance/\ndisagreeance.  The fact that there are more homosexuals in prison does not\nmean that homosexuals are immoral and more liable to commit crime.  And one\nmust remember that prison is not necessarily a reflection of the type of\npeople who are criminals.  What are the statistics for unsolved crime?
What is the penalty if convicted of murdering 4 Federal agents\nin Texas?  The death penalty.\n\n\nYup.
Even if Rodney King had come out of that car waving a gun and they \nmanaged to disarm him, the police still had no right right to beat\nhim senseless the way they did once he was on the ground.  If they \ncan't handle their jobs, they should be relieved of them.\n\nAdditionally, Anna Quindlan of the New York Times said it best (paraphrase):\nMany people bring up what happened before what is shown on the tape.  Here's\nwhat came before:  the 80's, Ronald Reagan, George Bush, racism,...
It is also interesting to note that Powell (and maybe Koons) were found\nguilty of aiding and abetting the deprival of King's civil rights...but,\ntwo others who also beat King and all the others who watched were not.\nGo figure?  Can you say sacraficial lambs?  Can you say appeal?
I wonder where you have been getting your mis-information from. Straight\nfrom the BATF itself?\n\nKoresh and his followers did not -capture- the compound a few years ago, it\nhas always been theirs. A few years ago their was an argument over who should\nlead the group, a gunfight erupted *one* person died. Koresh was charged\nwith the murder. When the sheriff came to arrest him, the sheriff knocked\non the dorr and showed Koresh the warrant (a tactic that the BATF might try\nlearning). Koresh and the others charged peacibly surrendered to the sherrif.\nA trial ensued, the others were found innocent, and the jury hung on Koresh's\ncharge.
...\n\nThat people are at risk and that some die during a hostage situation might\nbe considered an acceptable scenario in storming a compound. \n\nWhen EVERYONE dies (save for nine people), including twenty children, the \noutcome must be considered a failure.\n\nNow was the failure due to unforseeable circumstances, incompetence, or\nnegligence?  From the double talk and multiple stories I've seen on the news\ncoming from the FBI and Reno I find "it was an honest mistake" hard to swallow\n\nLet's hope they get their stories straight for the second round of questions.
The above conveniently ignores the murder of four BATF agents by the\nBranch Davidians in an unprovoked ambush.\n\nAny government that allows tinpot dictators to set up shop and declare\na private state has drifted into anarchy. There are laws to control\nthe ownership of guns and the BATF had good reason to beleive that\nthey were being violated. They set out to obtain a legal warrant and \nattempted to serve it only to be met with gunfire when they rang\nthe doorbell.\n\nThe paranoid assertion that the BATF fired first in an unprovoked\nassault assumes that the BATF were on a death wish. Had they\nexpected the B-D to be anything other than peacefull citizens who\nwould accept a search authorized by a court they would have turned up\nin a tank and broken the door down on day one.\n\nThe stupidity was the attempt to serve a warant on the place by\nludicrously underarmed and unprotected police. \n\n\nIf anyone on the net cares to suggest a sure fire method of bringing\nthe murderes of four police officers to justice perhaps we could\nhear it.
This is the first I hear that Koresh refused to release\n    someone.  In fact, a lot of people, including children, came out\n    during the stand-off.\n\n    How do you know Koresh killed his followers?  The FBI said\n    he had had no such plans (and they had the place bugged), Koresh's \n    attorney said the same thing, and the survivors claimed that the \n    fire was started by goverment agents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed are mine, not my employer's.
Of course, then there's the other side. An article in yesterday's Atlanta\nJournal stated that there are many scientists who have misgivings that the \ndata being used to determine whether or not global warming is occuring is\nfaulty. The point that the article made is that all long term temperature\ndataa collected has been in urban areas, and that any heat rise can be\nattributed to the growth and urbanization of the area. They called it\nthe "asphalt temperature trend". We have no real long term data on remote\nareas, such as the middle of the Amazon rain forest, or the top of Mt. Everest\nor the Gobi desert, for that matter. An accompanying article mentioned that\na group of scientists at NASA had developed a method for using a satellite\nto collect temperature data globally, and that preliminary results showed\na slight downward trend attributed to the Mt Pinatubo eruption.

: \n: >You might -- except that gay men are MUCH more promiscuous than\n: >straight men -- which shows how damaged and screwed up gay men are.\n: \n: Okay Claytoon, let us say that hypothetically I agree with you that\n: gay men are much more promiscuous than straight men.  Why does\n: this indicate they are screwed up people?\n: \n: BTW - It occurs to me that since, in my experience, men are much more\n:       interested in sex than women and want to have sex much earlier\n:       in a relationship than women do, that homosexuals would have \n:       sex more often simply becuase their partner is of a like mind.\n:       i.e. heterosexual men would be more promiscuous if they could.\n\nIt's my observation that women are more likely to me more strongly\nindoctronated into now wanting sex that are men.\nAlso there are definite double standards for men and women who are\npromiscuous.\n\nCould there also be a factor of communication being more direct in \nhomosexual relationships and culture.\n\n--
Wow, I hadn't realized how VENOMOUS this was getting!  Be careful here...the\nproblem isn't the rich but the values and the systems that make the rich\nrich.  Things are designed in such a way that in order to go with the system\nand make money, everything ELSE we care about goes to shit.  I have to\nconstantly remind myself that the goal of human society is not to make\nmoney.  Money doesn't make us happy; it just prevents certain things making\nus more unhappy.\n\nTherefore, don't shoot the rich.  Shoot the conservatives!\n\nDrewcifer
Presumably the B-D did not mount a continuous state of alert with gunmen\nready to fire on people who casually walked up to ring the doorbell.\n\nOnce inside the building the BATF would have been in control. Trained\npolice officers are a match to any bunch of Bozos playing at soldiers.\n\n\n\nNot a smart move. Unless meant to be part of the surprize cover. Even so\nthe narrow opening of the trucks simply was not a good idea. A side opening\ntruck would have been much better, more like a covered waggon.\n\n\n\nSounds just about right to me. Its the minimum amount of force that I\nwould consider necessary to serve a warrant on the talk.politics.guns\nannual dinner.\n\nMichael Hesseltine ordered the use of over 5000 crack troops including\nmembers of the parachute regiment to remove approx 250 hippy peace\nprotestors on a site where they wanted to install cruise missiles. He\neven turned up in a flack jacket to monitor the proceedings. Just about the\nmost dangerous tool the women possesed was a tin opener. That single\naction probably cost him the position as Prime Minister. One of the elders\nof my church got arrested in that heroic action by the forces of Toryism.\nHesseltine ever after was something of a national joke.
I *cannot* *believe* I am posting in this thread, but what\nthe hell, he asked for it.\n\nI had sort of the same reaction myself when I was first realizing\nI was bi.  "So what, >90% of everyone else is straight, I'd never\nend up with a guy anyway."  As several people on soc.bi pointed\nout to me, this is true only if you find partners (for relationships\nor just for sex) in primarily straight circles.  Nowadays with gay\nculture quite visible in major cities and such, you can easily\nfind yourself in an overwhelmingly queer social circle if you so\nchoose.  (About half my friends are bi, and that's just from\nhanging out in the science fiction club and going to UCBU once a\nweek, it's not as if I have to go out of my way and hang out in\nbars or something.)\n\nSo the available pool for dates can be the same size.  Unless of\ncourse you're trying to date a random sample of the US population.\n\nAs for promiscuity, I've traded email with Clayton on the topic,\nand he still doesn't seem to want to admit that yes, gay males\nare sometimes forced to resort to anonymous sex because they're\ncloseted and can't afford to be seen in a permanent relationship.\nOr that part of the promiscuity is because of the messed-up gender\nroles in our society, and when males are dating males and they've\n*all* been trained to be the aggressor in sex, there's going to\nbe more sex.  Or that what's "dysfunctional", what's "screwed up"\nis societal attitudes, not gay sexuality, and that's what \nencourages deviant behavior in gay males.\n\n(also note that just because someone's had 200 sex partners \ndoesn't mean they're promiscuous.  yes, it sounds ridiculous,\nbut it's quite possible for someone to go through a heavily\ncloseted phase in which they have lots of anonymous sex with\nstrangers, and then come out, start forming real relationships,\nand be monogamous or nearly so...)
>They used a tank to knock a hole in the wall, and they released\n   >non-toxic, non-flammable tear gas into the building.\n\n       Non-toxic tear gas?!?  Do you know what tear gas is?\n\n       I do: once upon a time I happened to be in a room when someone threw \n       a tear-gas grenade in (that was supposed to be a joke:).  The sensation \n       was incredible: I felt my eyes and nostrils were being torn apart.\n       I remember us - a bunch of young men in our early 20's - running out\n       like a herd of wild animals, knocking down the door and jumping\n       out of the windows (thank G-d we were on the first floor).\n\n       I can't imagine this kind of stuff being used against children.\n\nFor them, the worst effect might not be the physical effects so much\nas the psychological effect of being incapacitated without fully\nunderstanding the cause.  Many years ago, I was accidentally exposed\nto a tiny dose of tear gas.  (It was in Athens, on the street leading\nto the American Embassy; there'd been a march that had been broken up\nwith tear-gas; I must have stumbled into a remaining patch of gas the\nnext day.)  Aside from the tears, feeling sick to my stomach, etc.,\nthe really horrible psychological effect was that of suddenly falling\nto pieces and not knowing why it had happened---I was horrified and\nwondered what disease or other health problem I had.  (I didn't find\nout about the march and the tear-gas till hours later.)  I can imagine\nhow horribly disorienting this might be to very young children:\nsuddenly crying uncontrollably and feeling sick, weak, and out of\ncontrol of your body---and not knowing the cause.\n\n``This gives us a chance to try the Gas of Peace.''  Yeah, right.
You might as well have.  You certainly would not have been in error if\nyou would have.

The terms of the\nsearch warrent are secret and the BATF has yet to even reveal\nwhat they were.\n\n\n\n\n+>The stupidity was the attempt to serve a warant on the place by\n+>ludicrously underarmed and unprotected police. \n\n	They did not serve a warrent, they basically attacked the\ncompound and expected a surrender.

THE WHITE HOUSE\n\n                    Office of the Press Secretary\n___________________________________________________________________\nFor Immediate Release                                  April 23, 1993\n\n\n\n                            PRESS BRIEFING\n                           BY DEE DEE MYERS\n\n\n                          The Briefing Room\n\n\n10:35 A.M. EDT\n	     \n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  At 1:00 p.m., we're having a press \nconference, Bill, in the East Room.  And then Saturday the President \nwill leave here at roughly 8:00 a.m. and fly down to Jamestown.  He \nwill spend the day there, overnight at Camp David. \n	     \n	     On Sunday, it's unclear exactly what time he'll leave \nCamp David and fly to Boston.  He'll leave from Hagerstown. The press \nplane will leave from Washington. \n	     \n	     He will meet with some --\n	     \n	     Q	  What kind of a plane is that he's taking?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  That he's taking?  He'll probably take a C-\n20.\n	     \n	     Q	  From Hagerstown?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  From Hagerstown.  Air Force One doesn't fly \nout of Hagerstown, apparently.\n	     \n	     Q	  How will the pool travel?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  The pool will have to meet him ahead of \ntime.  So I guess the pool will travel with the press plane and wait \nfor him at the airport.  There is currently no provision -- and I'll \ndouble-check, because there's currently no provision -- I think \nthat's standard operating practice.\n	     \n	     Q	  The pool is not going to meet him and watch him get \non the plane at Hagerstown?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.\n	     \n	     Q	  What time does he have to be in Boston?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  He's going to meet there with a group of \ncitizens, mostly people who supported us during the campaign, at \naround 1:30 p.m.  We're still working out the final times.\n	     \n	     Q	  At the airport?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  No, it will be at the Boston Harbor Hotel.  \n	     And then he will also meet with some -- a youth group \nthat authored something called Project 21.  The speech to the \npublishers is actually at 3:15 p.m.  It will be followed by Q&A.  And \nthen after the speech and Q&A, he'll attend a reception with the \npublishers, and then return to Washington from Boston.  And that's it \nfor the weekend.\n	     \n	     Q	  Has the President seen the report from -- or the \nletter, communication from the foreign service officers; also, \nobviously, the communication from Madeleine Albright?  And what is \nhis reaction to their call on him?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Well, obviously, the letter was written to \nSecretary Christopher.  I believe Secretary Christopher received the \nletter on Saturday.  He reviewed it and met with the authors on \nMonday to discuss their views.  He believes it's an important part of \nthe policy-making process and is taking their views into account as \nwe go forward in the development of the Bosnia policy.\n	     \n	     Q	  What is the President's reaction?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  The President hasn't seen the letter.  It \nwas something that was directed towards Secretary Christopher.  In \nterms of -- he hasn't seen specifically the letter, but in terms of \ntheir concerns generally, what the President has said is that there \nare a lot of options on the table now, including ones that weren't \nthere before.  And I think he's, as is everybody, gravely concerned \nabout the situation in Bosnia.\n	     \n	     Q	  Is he influenced by that?  I mean, how does he feel \nabout the fact that all of the specialists in that area -- those desk \nofficers --\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Many of the specialists in that area -- I \nthink that that is clearly part of the process.  It's something -- \ntheir views will clearly be considered.  I think Secretary \nChristopher met with the group immediately to discuss their views.  I \nthink he believes that there ought to be room for opinions and that \nthose opinions ought to be considered, particularly from people who \nwork closely on the issues.\n	     \n	     Q	  What do you mean, there are options on the table \nthat weren't there before?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I think the President said last week that \nthere were options, such as lifting the arms embargo to the Bosnian \nMuslims, that had been previously off the table that are now being \nconsidered.\n	     \n	     Q	  Dee Dee, in terms of those options, Madeleine \nAlbright is saying that potentially there could be unilateral action \nby the U.S. if the Europeans did not go along.  Is that on the table?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Well, I can't discuss anything that would -- \nany conversations that would have happened between Ambassador \nAlbright and the President.  But I think the President has said he \nwould certainly -- is working with our European allies.  He's had a \nnumber of conversations with European leaders and is trying to build \nsome consensus there.  \n	     \n	     Q	  Will he reach a decision -- will he have anything \nspecific to say today?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  No.  I mean, in term of there will be no new \nannouncement of policy today.\n	     \n	     Q	  Does your statement mean he has ruled out \nunilateral action?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  He's continuing to consult with our allies \nat this point.  He has said -- I think he's been fairly clear about \nit, that the he believes that the U.S. needs to act in concert with \nits allies on this.\n	     \n	     Q	  On that point, does he believe that the U.S., \nthough, does have built-in authority from the United Nations already \nto take unilateral action?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Well, I think the U.N. Resolution 770 makes \nit clear that you can act unilaterally in support of any humanitarian \nrelief effort.  I think the broader point is that anything we do, any \noptions that we decide to pursue we will make sure that it is \nconsistent with U.N. authority, and if it's not, we'll work with our \nallies to make sure that we get it.\n	     \n	     Q	  Dee Dee, then how does the White House someone as \ndistinguished as Elie Wiesel, who says that not enough is being done \nto stop the atrocities going on in Bosnia?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I think that that's why we're considering \nadditional options.  I think that Mr. Wiesel's comments yesterday \nwere quite compelling.  The situation in Bosnia is tragic.  The \nPresident is very concerned about it.  He has -- I think President \nClinton has worked very hard  to take further actions to continue to \nisolate Serbia in the world community.  Clearly, we're considering \nother options because the President is concerned that perhaps it's \nnot enough.\n	     \n	     Q	  In terms of what you were just talking about, it \nsounds like Resolution 770 justifies unilateral action by the U.S. to \nprotect humanitarian --\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I don't think it -- I wouldn't use the word \njustify.  It permits unilateral action by any country in protecting \nthe delivery of humanitarian relief.  But I think that's just an \nexplanation of the resolution.  I think any action that we take will \nbe consistent with U.N. resolutions or we'll work with our allies to \nmake sure that it is permissible or we'll get further action.\n	     \n	     Q	  The President and other officials have ruled out \nunilateral U.S. action in Bosnia in the past.  You're declining to do \nthat this morning.\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  No, I said the President has said repeatedly \nthat he wants to act in concert with our allies on this.\n	     \n	     Q	  That doesn't mean that he won't act alone, which \nhas been said before explicitly.\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I don't mean to imply a change in policy.  \nThe President has said all along that he wants to act in concert with \nour allies on this.\n	     \n	     Q	  One other little question.  Did he know about this \nletter from the foreign service officers before it hit the papers?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.  Secretary Christopher \n-- they may have had a private conversation about it.  The President \nhas not seen it.\n	     \n	     Q	  They met on Monday, right?  Christopher met --\nsurely, he must have brought that up --\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Again, they may have talked privately about \nit, but --\n	     \n	     Q	  Dee Dee, what you're saying is that the Albright \nrecommendation has been rejected, is that correct?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  No, I didn't say that at all.  I said I \nwon't -- I said I wouldn't comment on any conversations or \ncommunications.\n	     \n	     Q	  She's advocating unilateral action and you're \nsaying, in effect, that we will not take unilateral action.\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I am not confirming anything that Madeleine \nAlbright may or may not have recommended.\n	     \n	     Q	  Given the sometimes delicate, complicated and \nfrustrating nature of negotiations with the allies on this issue, \ndoes the President find this kind of letter from 12 foreign service \nofficers of the State Department helpful to that process, hurtful to \nthat?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I think that their views are obviously being \nconsidered.  The Secretary received that memo on Saturday and two \ndays later he met with them in order to have a more thorough airing \nof their views, of the basis for their views, to discuss in greater \ndetail the options that they had presented in the letter.\n	     \n	     Q	  Doesn't it put some kind of pressure on --\nadditional pressure on him now from within his own administration to \nact regardless of what the allies may or may not do?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I think clearly there's a broad policy \nreview underway now.  And the President and his advisors are \nconsidering a number of options, including some of those outlined in \nthe letter from the folks over at the State Department.  Now, no \ndecisions have been made on that yet, but I think that there is a \nthrough review underway, and that their opinions are being very \nseriously considered.\n	     \n	     Q	  If I can just follow up, I guess what I'm looking \nfor is what was his reaction to this letter?  Did he say, good, this \nbolsters my position?  Or did he say, damn, this is just what I don't \nneed right now?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I think he said this helps contribute \nsubstantively to the debate.  It's important that all views be \nconsidered and aired thoroughly, that before he makes a decision he \nwants to have the best possible advice and information possible, and \nthis, I think in many ways, furthers that goal.\n	     \n	     Q	  So internal advice to a Cabinet official or the \nPresident -- it's all open now, and you wouldn't take any umbrage or \nsay that they were out of line?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I think that the fact that Secretary \nChristopher met with them to discuss their views and make sure they \nhad an opportunity to have a more complete conversation about it is \nconclusive evidence that their views are welcome.\n	     \n	     Q	  Does the policy review include what Madeleine \nAlbright has suggested, and what Joe Biden and others have suggested, \nwhich is that the previous U.N. resolutions authorize unilateral \naction -- military action -- for the delivery of humanitarian --\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I think all options are on the table.\n	     \n	     Q	  The unilateral option is on the table?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I think all options are on the table.\n	     \n	     Q	  We've had two different --\n	     \n	     Q	  Isn't that a change, Dee Dee?\n	     \n	     Q	  That would be a change of policy.\n	     \n	     Q	  Particularly if it includes ground troops, which \nhas been specifically ruled out.\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I think the President has been -- well, no.  \nI don't -- that is not --\n	     \n	     Q	  Are you talking about all options?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  All options -- I think the President has \nbeen fairly clear about that.  So let me just review again what he \nhas said.  He has said that -- the President has said all options are \non the table, with the exception of the introduction of ground \ntroops, which he has never suggested.  He has ruled that out from the \nbeginning.\n	     \n	     Q	  Hasn't he ruled out unilateral action of any sort?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  He has said that he doesn't believe the U.S. \ncan solve the problems in the former Yugoslavia by itself.  I think \nthat there are a number of very complicated options on the table \nright now.  I don't think that -- again, I don't want to comment on \nspecific options that are being considered other than in the broad \ncategories that we've already said -- things like lifting the arms \nembargo against the Bosnian Muslims, things that I think we've talked \nabout in broad terms.  This is a very complicated situation.  The \noptions being presented and considered are very complicated.\n	     \n	     Q	  Air strikes on the table?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Again, I think that's been fairly clearly \npointed out that that's something that's being discussed.\n	     \n	     Q	  Dee Dee, are ground troops on the -- \n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  No, ground troops are not being considered.\n	     \n	     Q	  You said there was not going to be -- you said you \nwere not announcing a change of policy.  Then you said everything is \non the table.  We're confused.  Are unilateral actions on the table?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  All I can tell you is what the President has \nsaid -- that he doesn't believe -- that he wants to act in concert \nwith the allies on this.\n	     \n	     Q	  Wants to, but he's willing to -- I mean, if they \ndon't go along --\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  He's continuing to consult with our allies \non this.  He's continuing to have discussions.  He's continuing to \npress them for further action.  And I think that's clear.  The \nconversation is ongoing.  We're going to continue to work with them \nto find the best possible solution and next step on this.\n	     \n	     Q	  Dee Dee, the allies have taken the position that to \nconduct any kind of air strikes in Bosnia would have the opposite \neffect of ensuring the delivery of humanitarian aid; that they feel \nthat their troops on the ground monitoring the delivery of that aid \nwould become vulnerable and the Bosnians --\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I'm not sure that's the consistent -- I \nmean, I'm not sure who you're referring to.\n	     \n	     Q	  The British and the French.\n	     \n	     Q	  Yes, the British and French.  They've taken the \nposition that the delivery of humanitarian aid would be jeopardized \nby any kind of air strikes against the Bosnian military.  Does the \nU.S. believe differently from that?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  The President has had conversations with \nboth Mitterrand and Major, as you know.  I think that there is a \nthorough review of policy going on in those countries as well.  And I \ndon't want to comment on the nature of the President's discussions \nother than to say that he's continuing to consult with our allies as \nwe move forward and he's continuing to press them for further action.  \nAnd I think that process is ongoing.\n	     \n	     Q	     the other day voted against any military \nintervention yesterday.  Does the President regard that as the end of \nthe line or does he does still hold out some possibility of \nunilateral action?  The allies have been very, very plain that they \ndo not want to do anything.\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  The consultations are ongoing.  That's all I \ncan tell you at this point.\n	     \n	     Q	  Are you saying that there won't be any announcement \non Bosnia today in the press conference?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  No, that is not the intention of the press \nconference.\n	     \n	     Q	  What is the intention?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  It's an opportunity to take questions.  He \nmay have a brief -- I'm sure he'll have a brief opening statement, \nbut it is not an opportunity to outline a new policy on Bosnia.  That \nwill not happen.\n	     \n	     Q	  Can you tell us what the subject of the opening \nstatement is?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  It's sort of a general statement of where we \nare.\n	     \n	     Q	  After the first hundred days, you mean?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  It's not a long statement.  I mean, this is \njust generally.  Don't look for any major policy pronouncements.\n	     \n	     Q	  Do you know what the opening statement is?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  But it's -- perhaps later today I'll be able \nto tell you with more certainty -- I think that's still under review.  \nBut the overriding purpose of this -- it's not a mystery; it's not \nmeant to be.  It's just to take questions.\n	     \n	     Q	  It would be helpful to know whether -- what the \nopening statement is on.\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Since the major purpose here is just to take \nquestions, it's not completely resolved yet.\n	     \n	     Q	  Dee Dee, one policy that was expected last week and \nthat the White House, you and George seemed to indicate we might get, \nwould be an AIDS czar.  Will he announce that today?  And what's the \ndelay on that?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I don't think we meant to imply -- I think \nwe said it would happen soon.  I don't think we meant to imply with \nany certainty that it would be this week.  It is coming soon.  I \ndon't anticipate that happening today.\n	     \n	     Q	  What's the delay?  Isn't this the perfect time to \nannounce an AIDS czar?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I don't know that it's a delay.  I think the \nprocess is ongoing to find the best possible person and to go through \nthe necessary background checks, and to make sure that we've crossed \nthe t's and dotted the i's before we make an announcement.\n	     \n	     Q	  Dee Dee, what are Zoe Baird's qualifications for \nthe Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board?  And why wasn't her \nappointment announced here?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  The qualifications -- I don't know if \nthere's a specific list; I'll have to check and see.  I think there \nare a number of people there on the board with different backgrounds.  \nMany of them have long histories in intelligence or other government \nservice.  I think there's a broad variety of views across political \nspectrum and across backgrounds that are represented there.  We never \nmade a formal announcement other than the Chairman of the Board, \nwhich is Admiral William Crowe.\n	     \n	     Q	  Why would he appoint her, though, if the American \npeople and many in the Senate rejected her for another government \njob?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe that the American people \never had -- voted on her.  And I certainly -- she was never rejected \nin the Senate.  She never went up there for a hearing.  But the \nPresident believes she's a very competent person.  He's said that -- \nZoe Baird -- do you understand what the question is?  Zoe Baird is on \nthe President's Foreign Intelligence --\n	     \n	     Q	  You said she never went up there for a hearing?\n	     \n	     Q	  Her nomination was withdrawn after public outrage \nover violating federal laws?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Right, she never -- she was never -- but you \nsaid she was rejected by the Senate.  I was just simply trying to \npoint out that she was never voted on by the Senate.\n	     \n	     Q	  So you don't think that is any problem?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I don't think there's any problem.\n	     \n	     Q	  She has been appointed to this board, is that a \nfact?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Yes.\n	     \n	     Q	  Does she need confirmation for this?  Does she need \nconfirmation to be a member of the --\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  No.  It's a presidential appointment.\n	     \n	     Q	  Usually, announcements are made here at the White \nHouse.  Was there a decision not to announce her publicly?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  We didn't make an announcement.  People who \nasked were told who  the members of the board were.  We didn't make \nan official announcement.  If anybody's interested in that we can \ncertainly put out the list of names.\n	     \n	     Q	  I'd like to know.\n	     \n	     Q	  Don't such board members -- don't you normally as a  \nmatter of -- routinely put out releases on all these boards and \npresidential appointment regardless of their dimension?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Not always.  But, again, I'm happy to put \nthis out.\n	     \n	     Q	  Isn't that the standard practice?\n	     \n	     Q	  That was past practice.\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Again, I'm happy to put it out.  We'll put \nout a list of the members of the board today.\n	     \n	     Q	  Dee Dee, I don't want to try to fail to let you get \nout of this swamp but -- (laughter) -- all I really want to know is \nhasn't it been the practice in this administration for such \nannouncements to be made routinely?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I think generally but not always.  And we're \nhappy to put that out today.\n	     \n	     Q	  What is the board, what is her title, what is the \nsize of the board?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  There is roughly a dozen members on the \nboard.  It is a civilian board, although their are some, obviously, \nretired military personnel on the board that provide input into \nintelligence policy for the President.  Again, the chairman of that \nboard is Admiral William Crowe.\n	     \n	     Q	  And did he recommend Baird?\n	     \n	     Q	  What's the name of the board?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  It's the President's Foreign Intelligence \nAdvisory Board, PFIAB.\n	     \n	     Q	  What's her qualification -- that she had employed \nan illegal alien?  Is that -- (laughter) -- \n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Do you want an answer to the question or you \njust want to make a joke?\n	     \n	     Q	  Let me phrase it another way.  Why shouldn't this \nappointment be viewed as a pay-back for the difficulty she had a \ncouple of months ago?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Because it's not.  \n	     \n	     Q	  What's her experience in foreign intelligence?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  She's an experienced attorney, someone who \nthe President believes is very competent and qualified.  And I think \npart of the mission of this board is to provide civilian input.  Not \neverybody on the board is supposed to be an intelligence expert; that \nis not the board's mission.  It is to provide civilian input for the \nPresident as he makes decisions regarding intelligence matters.  He \nbelieves she's very qualified, very competent person, enormously \ntalented and has said that throughout.\n	     \n	     Q	  Is this just a figment of my overactive \nimagination, or was there discussion early on about abolishing the \nPresident's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I don't think so.  On December 24th, when he \nannounced all of his foreign policy advisors he announced that he \nwould -- had appointed Admiral Crowe as the head of the board.  So I \ndon't believe there's ever been any --\n	     \n	     Q	  Earlier than that, during the transition.\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  No, I don't believe so.  It was announced, \nagain, on December 24th.  Admiral Crowe couldn't be there, but it was \nannounced. \n	     \n	     Q	  Are members paid?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so, but I'll double-check.\n	     \n	     Q	  On another subject, on Waco, how do you explain the \ndiscrepancy between the federal reports of the autopsies of the \nbodies that are coming out of Waco and the state?  I guess it's the \nTexas Ranger reports.  \n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Most of the information is coming -- the \nfederal information is coming from the site.  Clearly, there's been \nsome discrepancies and the Justice Department is looking into it.  \nOfficials in the Justice Department were told, I believe the day \nbefore yesterday, that there were several bodies found with bullet \nholes.  I think there's some discrepancy about that, and the Justice \nDepartment is looking into it.\n	     \n	     Q	  Is the President going to get involved in trying to \nsort out what seems to be becoming a jurisdictional morass down \nthere, with some people withdrawing, others saying they're in charge, \nbut others -- Justice, FBI, Texas Rangers -- all grabbing a piece of \nthis?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I don't know that he's going to try to \nmediate the dispute.  I mean, I'll let you know if there's anything \nhe intends to do about it.  But as you know, there are several levels \nof investigation ongoing, and we're hopeful that they can work \ntogether. \n	     \n	     Q	  Is there any one agency or official down there in \ncharge of everything?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I don't know.  I'll have to get back to you \non that.\n	     \n	     Q	  What is the subject matter of Sunday's speech?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  It's going to be fairly general.  I don't \nthink it's going to be any specific announcements.  I think it's \ngoing to be sort of a --\n	     \n	     Q	  Does he have a topic that he's going to talk about?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  We're still working on it.  But I wouldn't \nlook for any announcements of, like, the drug czar or something like \nthat.\n	     \n	     Q	  Is it sort of a 100 days speech, sort of "my \nexcellent adventure for 100 days"?  (Laughter.)\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Not exactly, but I think he'll take a little \nbit broader look about what's happened in the last --\n	     \n	     Q	  Foreign, domestic?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  A little bit of both, but I think a lot of \ndomestic.\n	     \n	     Q	  And overview. \n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Yes, more of an overview than a specific \npolicy announcement.  \n	     	  \n	     Q	  Has there been an agreement yet on a forum by which \nthe President will address the gay rights march on Sunday?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  It will be a letter read to the crowd by \nCongresswoman Nancy Pelosi.\n	     \n	     Q	  Is that available?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Not yet, but it will be.  Sure.\n	     \n	     Q	  Are you going to put it out here or --\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  We'll probably put it out here on Sunday.\n	     \n	     Q	  Travel next week?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Unclear.\n	     \n	     Q	  What was the question?\n	     \n	     Q	  Likely?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I don't --\n	     \n	     Q	  Likely?  Possible?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Possible.\n	     \n	     Q	  What's possible?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Travel.\n	     \n	     Q	  George mentioned yesterday campaign finance reform \nand national service legislative proposals next week.  Do you have \ndays yet for them?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Not yet.\n	     \n	     Q	  Can you tell us which order?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Campaign finance reform first; national \nservice later in the week.\n	     \n	     Q	  Is there any coverage tomorrow in Williamsburg?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  No.\n	     \n	     Q	  And any report in the aftermath of the day?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Any readout from the day?\n	     \n	     Q	  Readout.\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  It's possible.  Jeff Eller will be down \nthere.  I think he can go through what the President did during the \nday.  We don't expect any photo op or anything, other than departure \nhere in the morning.\n	     \n	     Q	   Dee Dee, the President has not made a regular \npractice, as some of his predecessors have, of going to Camp David.  \nIn fact, he's been there -- what -- once or twice?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Twice.\n	     \n	     Q	  Why this weekend?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  He went two weekends ago, as you know, on \nthe way home from his father-in-law's funeral.  I think that they \nfound it to be a good experience and a nice way for them to spend \nsome time together as a family.  And this is just an opportunity to \ndo the same.\n	     \n	     Q	  There's no march there.\n	     \n	     Q	  It has nothing to do with the march here?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  No.\n	     \n	     Q	  Since he's going to be in town Sunday morning now \ninstead of in Jamestown, have you thought about him making a quick \npass-by, fly-over -- (laughter) --\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  He'll fly straight to Boston.\n	     \n	     Q	  Flying straight did you say?  (Laughter.)\n	     \n	     Q	  George took a question yesterday on Waco.  The \nPresident had said on Tuesday in the Rose Garden that there was a \nminor disagreement on tactics between the military advisors and the \nFBI.  And the question was whether you knew exactly what that was and \nwhether it related to the use of the particular kind of tear gas.  Do \nyou have an answer on that?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I don't.  I'll check.\n	     \n	     THE PRESS:  Thank you.

It is interesting, sometimes, to listen to U.S. news as seen through\nthe eyes of another country.......\n\nB.B.C. world news service, on short-wave, originating out of London,\nreports that a survivor of the Waco massacre states that a tank, when\nmaking a hole in the wall of the building, knocked over a kerosene\nlamp and that is how the fire started.  Attempts were made by the\npeople inside to put out the fire, but it spread too quickly.\n\nHas anyone in U.S. heard anything similar or are U.S. government\nspin-doctors censoring such information?

The sort of tear gas they are using was described as some\n	sort of powdery material that sticks to things.

Really now.  Why is this the pot calling the kettle black?  I am stating\nthat a person who shows a continually biased opinion is close-minded and that\nhis opinion should be ignored.  Clayton is stating that a group of at least\ntwo million (1%) American citizens are evil vicious malicious child-molesters.\n\n     Here's a hypothetical question...  If Clayton said something like "all\nthose niggers are really stupid."  (Please don't be offended, I'm not racist\nbut merely using an example of Clayton's malign logic).  And then said he\nread a report that a lot of blacks in inner cities dropped out of school, I\nbet he wouldn't have your support.  Yet he can claim that all homosexuals are\ndishonest, evil, lying child molesters without *PERSONALLY* having a single\nhomosexual friend or acquaintance and you'll sit there and support him.
Yes, so?  You still haven't explained why they \n    can't be used to enforce Civil Law.  They certainly\n    would have done a better job of Koresh.  Just call\n    in an air strike.
Yesterday, the FBI was saying that at least three of the bodies had\ngunshot wounds, indicating that they were shot trying to escape the\nfire.  Today's paper quotes the medical examiner as saying that there\nis no evidence of gunshot wounds in any of the recovered bodies.\n\nAt the beginning of this siege, it was reported that while Koresh\nhad a class III (machine gun) license, today's paper quotes the\ngovernment as saying, no, they didn't have a license.\n\nToday's paper reports that a number of the bodies were found with\nshoulder weapons next to them, as if they had been using them while\ndying -- which doesn't sound like the sort of action I would expect\nfrom a suicide.\n\nOur government lies, as it tries to cover over its incompetence\nand negligence.  Why should I believe the FBI's claims about\nanything else, when we can see that they are LYING?\n\nThis system of government is beyond reform.

Put up or shut up. Where is your evidence?\nShow a study indicating a link between liking >>GROWN UPS<< of the same\nsex and liking children.

(Point aside that they were really defending\nabolishing or modifying the age of consent laws, or the right to be ATTRACTED\nbut don't act upon desires for children).\n\nso 12 out of thousands is an "overwhelming majority".\n\nYou never cease to amaze me.\n\nAnd you still haven't told me why my relationship with my partner is immoral.\n\nBrian D.

Out and out lie.  Not substantiated. I do not understand statments\nlike these. Please stop making such ridiculous claims.  Maybe you\nshould consider working for or getting your information from the\nNational Inquirer for now on.\n\n\nAhh!  Rabbit from a hat.  Here is another desperate step to discount\nany activity of the Washington Gay March.

I thumbed through the Janus Report in a bookstore recently looking\n  for a clue about their methodology.   They were very unclear about\n  it, but as far as I could tell they relied on their professional\n  associates in the psychotherapy profession to provide the subjects,\n  interviews, and numbers.    If so, this would hardly represent an\n  average cross-section.    I posted to Usenet at the time asking for\n  more data about their methodology but answer came there none.  (I\n  must have been out of my mind for even asking for factual information\n  on Usenet!)\n\n\n\n  This is the problem.  People have to have a lot of confidence in \n  the anonymity of a study before they can counted on to speak \n  freely about stuff like that.    But I agree that if someone's \n  going to lie it will be in the direction of a gay person claiming\n  to be straight rather than the other way around.\n\n\n\n  I don't see why there's any more evidence for this figure than any\n  other.    It seems totally arbitrary.

People will start coming out.\n\n	2. They will commit suicide in mass at some point.\n\n\nThe thing to remember about (2) is that hysterical situations and "assults"\nplay into the hands of a "leader" who has picked this course.   Its\nmuch easier to stampede people into something like suicide if there\nis gas coming in and bullets in the air.  Let them be hungry and miserable\nfor longer and longer and it will probably be more effective.\n\n	The "possiblity" that they would all kill themselves at some\npoint would not bother me in the least or alter tactics.  If people\nare going to take their own lives, the best you can probably do is\nprevent yourself from giving them the opportunity or an excuse to\ndo it.

# # 	Actually, I was rather surprised to see an article on this subject\n# # (i.e. the "new, inproved" survey saying that roughly 1% of men are gay)\n# # on the front page of The New York _Times_ recently (I think it was\n# # on Thurs, 15 April).  The headline was something to the effect of \n# # "New Survey Finds 1% of Men Are Gay"\n# \n# Does anyone else see the difference between "1% of Men Are Gay" and 1%\n# of Men surveyed *say* they are gay?  Does the NY Times think that\n# there is no one "in the closet"?\n\nI see.  When survey after survey show 1-4%, we are supposed to believe\nONE survey, done with very poor assumptions, with a very atypical\npopulation, 40 years ago when the society was FAR more repressed about\nhomosexuality than it is now.  Yeah, right.\n\n# Russ Anderson    |  Disclaimer: Any statements are my own and do not reflect
On the other hand, Rush made an interesting point: The Democrats ran\n   one of their best campaigns in years against a pathetic Republican and\n   a paranoiac and still only pulled 43% of the vote, lost 10 seats in\n   the House, and gained 0 seats in the Senate.  1994 might be pretty\n   interesting.\n\nClueless of the world, take heart!  57% of the electorate is willing\nto vote for "a pathetic Republican and a paranoiac"!!
What is your proof that they "did the best they could"?   Unless\n  they had strong evidence that the children were in IMMEDIATE danger\n  then "the best they could" have done was to SHOW RESTRAINT.\n\n  Some of us DID predict this outcome, or at least suggested a\n  strong possibility of it.  I, for one, said that in the event of\n  an assault against the building the CHILDREN were the ones in danger\n  either from the assault itself or from a "Jonestown" (my phrase\n  a week after the seige started) style suicide.  And as I pointed\n  out then, and repeatedly over the objections of people on the net \n  who disagreed with me, an adult may freely choose suicide but they\n  have no right to impose this choice on their children.\n\n  Now, while I don't expect the FBI to pay any attention to what I \n  have to say on this, I *DO* expect them to figure it out on their\n  own or to take the advice of experts.  The cult specialist inter-\n  viewed in yesterday's Boston Globe said he was repeatedly "stonewalled"\n  by the FBI when he pointed out to them that their confrontational\n  tactics played perfectly into Koresh's mad view of the world and so \n  increased the chance of a tragic outcome.\n\n\n  Give *US* a break!   Pumping teargas for 45 minutes into a compound \n  filled with CHILDREN?!!   This doesn't seem to show much regard for \n  their lives or safety.   "Nontoxic teargas" is an oxymoron.  Children\n  have tiny respiratory passages which are easily blocked by the secretions\n  induced by teargas; moreover teargas can easily cause fatalities in anyone\n  subject to laryngospasms, asthma, or heart disease.\n\n  If a madman is holding a gun to a hostage, someone who provokes the \n  madman by attacking him bears nearly as much repsonsibility for the\n  death of the hostage as the madman himself.  These kinds of situations\n  have to be handled *delicately* - not by surrounding a place with\n  tanks and heavily armed personnel and blaring rock music from loud-\n  speakers at all hours.   That approach is idiotic.  \n\n\n\n  The solution is to greatly reduce the authority of the "the authorities".\n  The Feds showed themselves here, as they have so many times in the\n  past, to be a gang of trigger-happy, impulsive, yahoos who cause more\n  trouble than they prevent.    Their confrontational approach reinforced\n  every single message Koresh was giving his followers, virtually guarantee-\n  ing that whatever crazy solution Koresh proposed would be followed\n  willingly.   This was pointed out here, on Compuserve, in the press,\n  just about every place except in the Justice Department where it seems\n  a n.i.h. philosophy prevails.
: \n: It would seem that a society with a "failed" government would be an ideal\n: setting for libertarian ideals to be implemented.  Now why do you suppose\n: that never seems to occur?...\n \nAdvances in freedom have been made in the past.  The "divine right of\nking" concept was questioned at one time and may have used the same\nargument, that it hadn't come about before.  But our ancestors had the\ncourage to throw off the old system that said that one man ruling many\nwas necessary to have a decent, wholesome society.  In the 1800s the \nconcept of slavery was questioned.  Our ancestors had the courage to\nquestion a practice that had existed for thousands of years.  Was\nthe idea that one man owning another necessary to have a decent, \nwholesome society?  Now libertarians question the necessity of\nmajoritarianism.  Is it necessary that many people rule over many\nothers to have a decent, wholesome society?

I have indeed heard of Pythagoras, but I don't know that he was ever\ndisparaged as a "bean eater".  In the American Southwest and West\n(e.g., Texas, California, Colorado), the term "bean eater" is\nsometimes used as a slur against those of Hispanic heritage (generally\nMexicans, in those parts) -- much like how the Irish in the Northeast\nare perceived (by some) as voracious beer guzzlers.

Who needs such an airhead?\n\n\n\nOh, I can't do anything _BUT_ count on it.  After all, it is\ninevitable, for it is part of the natural order of things.

If you have something reasoned and intelligent to say then you should\npost. If all you can do is rant and rave- save it.\n\n	True conservatism is cutting spending and taxes.

I suggest you take a look at your post. I see\nnothing but unfair and unsubstantiated generalizations. It suggests that the\nauthor is anything but open-minded.\n	Next time you feel like posting something like this- save it for \nsomebody who cares.

What *exactly* does the American Constitution say about "the right \nto association" ? \n   Homosexuals, whether Clayton likes it or not, are as much members\nof society as he is. As such they have the right to participate and\nhave an equal opportunity to pursue their goals.\n   No-one is saying that Clayton should be forced to associate with\nqueerfolk in his private life (one suspects the gays in question would\nobject also 8-) ), but by proclaiming the general right not to associate\nwith them in the *public* sphere (which includes housing, hiring, etc),\nhe's giving his right to non-association priority over their rights to\nequal access to opportunity.\n   Historically, people can associate publically with disliked groups\nwith very little ill-effect, however cutting a group off from normal\ncommerce has a severe impact on their lives.\n   Clayton, why exactly should your "right" to non-association in the\npublic sphere take priority over homosexual's rights to equal opportunity ?
Hey, Clayton, it's me again!  I just love your arguments.  They completely\nclinch each and _every_ one of your points!\n\nBut then again, that, I suppose, says a lot about how screwed up your are.\n\nHehe.  I haven't had so much fun since I started blasting christians in alt.atheism!

-------------------------------------------\nIt's already in the hands of a monopoly of the rich because of capitalism\nof land. Other than government land, saved for posterity and the eco-system\nas well as government function, the remaining land is owned by a smaller\npercentage of the people than ever before. The game of capitalism is almost\nwon. The game has only to be declared over and we will have to take matters\ninto our own hands and redistribute it again fairly, or else be enslaved in\nreturn for a place to live. Here in central California, already, fewer than\n30% own all the property and 5% of them own 90% of it. That's twice what it\nwas twenty years ago. Rents are so high that you pay 60% of your income for\nrent. If you just have a McJob, all you can afford is one room, if that.\nSome 30% of minimum wage workers are homeless. Unless you both have degrees\nin technical fields and are working in them, (in the midst of 30%\nunemployment in high tech jobs!), you will never own anything but a used\ncar if you choose to have more than one child!!! And everywhere else you\ncould afford there are no jobs. The only way to get there is to save and\nnot consume any more than you have to, clothing used, food poor. No movies,\nno entertainment,, ect. for about five to seven years, and then, if you've\nsaved $20,000, if you can get together that much, and that's ignoring your\nkids and working two jobs, then you can buy a home in Arkansas or Missouri\noutright and live somewhere where they flood every other year! That's an\nexaggeration if you pay close attention to the flood lines on other\npeople's houses and find a sturdy hill, then you can buy one up there! Also\nbuy a rowboat. Missouri's not so bad, if you like the sensation of sleeping\nin a sweatbox in summer and your car freezing solid in winter. They really\ndo put those heaters into the dipstick hole to keep them warm enough to\nstart with ether!:) Shit, kill the rich and redistribute the livable\nproperty. Kill all of them!\n-RSW\n\n---------------------------------------------\nThe land is simply granted to people who live on it now. Extra is kept for\nthe future. You get to stay where you are without paying rent. Land that\nsupports others becomes property of the state. Farmers are welcome to plant\ncrops that people need according to demand and ability and soil quality. If\nyou want to grow sourgum because you always did, and you aren't doing a\ngood job, then we let another farmer grow sorghum, and you grow something\nelse. When people die the land they were entitled to use goes into the\npublic holdings. No one can sell land, but they can trade places with\nanybody. No one can lease land. The government will locally distribute the\nuse of the land not used for residences. Residences that are insufficient\nto the families living there can be traded to the public for a larger house\nand yard according to need and availability. The local land council who vow\nto live on their land till death to avoid profit ties will decide fairness\nsubject to review by the state and federal land councils. It will cost no\nmore than any fucking thing costs now with fucking assed rent going down a\ndeep dark hole to the owners! Anyone can submit a request for a larger\nhouse or land to start a business on, depending on a valid business plan\nand community needs. Heavy equipment is subject to seizure for the public\ngood or as needed. Heavy equipment operators are encouraged to keep and\nmaintain their own machine and to operate it at a reasonable salary in\nservice to the community. Companies who own many machines are to be divided\namong the appropriate equipment operators and the rest to be let to valid\noperators on a need basis. Cost of upkeep is charged. A guild of heavy\nmachine operators is recognized for safety and training's sake. Their\ncouncil is a subcouncil to the community council. Etc. Etc. Etc. It isn't\nso hard to think of a better system than we have. All you have to do is\nrealize that the system we have now is not sacrosanct, in fact it's a\nrigged game that steals you blind and is the most unfair any system could\nbe already!!!!!!!! The trick is to realize that the old rich have been\nmaking the rules behind your back and that it's time to kick them off the\nmerry-go-round. Tax the rich to death. They are the ones that converted\nyour 60's school lunch program into the joke it is today. They are the ones\nwho always cut education. They are the ones who always raise the rent when\nyou get a raise. They are the ones who should be not just dislodged but\nkilled for their abuse. I have trouble justifying the death penalty for a\npoor kid who killed and didn't know why not. I have no trouble justifying\nthe death penalty for the rich who steal countless human lives to feed\ntheir greed! Have you paid rent most of your life? Then you have been\nenslaved, percentage wise, most of your life. We used to be serfs. Now we\nare called renters, and we are still enslaved to somebody who claims to own\nland they don't use and make us pay them for it when they did nothing to\nown it. Most rents in California are enough to buy the apartment house,\npaynthe taxes and the insurance and have a little left over to travel with!\nI have seen the books! I know what my landlord pays and to whom! I know\nwhat I pay her. I am being forced to buy her a building and then I will be\nlet out at the other end with nothing, when I had as much right as her to\nlive on this planet! And her child will have the money to likewise\nenslave my child. I hope I find out when I am going to die. I can make\nthings just a little happier form me to be able to destroy her life as she\ndestroyed mine. And maybe I can take a few other landlords with me, and\ntheir heirs. That would be worth it. Then to be able to die before they can\ndo anything to me. That's a poor man's dream. Sleep tight, bastard\nlandlords. You don't know the trouble you are buying yourself as you sleep\non my heirs money in your mattress!\n-RSW
Excuse me? Quality? As in grade A CO2 and grade B CO2? I may not have\nthis quite right but I was under the impression that CO2 was CO2.\n\n Furthermore, \n\n	A) There is no reason to believe this system is inherently stable- \nThe Ice ages occured without any help from humans.\n\n	B) The point was that the human contribution of CO2 and other \ngreenhouse gasses is insignificant and it won't really make a difference if\nwe make more or less.\n\n	C) What overwhelming data? I see lots of 'projections' of the future,\nwhich is fascinating, considering they can't predict the weather two weeks\nin advance.
[Motor-Voter stuff]\n\n       Well, there does have to be a line.  And to be honest, extending\nvoter registration to DMVs is hardly analogous to having only one\nplace for registration in Alaska and opening a new one in Atlanta.  More is \nnot always better once you've passed a certain point.\n\n\n       I thought the Motor Voter bill passed.\n\n       In any case, my experiance with Tennessee's voter registration\nsystem (which you can register with by mail, by the way) is that nobody\nwho is interested in voting is being denied access to registration.\nAll it requires is just the tiniest bit of interest on the registrant's\npart and thinking about the election once in the eleven months prior to\nit.  (Once you register it's good unless you miss for years worth of\nelections of move.)\n\n       It's easy to register now.  I simply don't see the value in going\nout and trying to get people registered who don't have enough gumption to\neven write and have the proper forms sent to them.   How can we expect\nresponsible decisions out of these people?
I'm no defender of the AEC, but it is worth noting that it is unfair to tar\nthat organization with the decidedly minority scientific views of its\nformer chairperson and one term Washington governor, Dr. Dixie Lee Ray.\nDr. Ray's political agenda is well-known and documented.  Likewise, her\nlack of objectivity in analysing scientific data is well-known.\n\njsh

It will be ironic in the extreme if Spector manages to uncover a\ngovernment conspiracy and cover-up in this case. Maybe he'll posit a\nMagic Grenade that lit fires in three wings of the building at once.

Fante} \endauthor\n\date {April 20, 1993} \enddate\n\endtopmatter\n\npull back the heavens and show you my anger?! ... fear me.''  The 51 day\nstandoff between federal agents and the Branch Davidians ended on April 19\nin what appeared to be a mass suicide by fire.  Now that the multi-million\ndollar standoff is over, a few things remain: cleaning up the mess, and\nassigning blame.\n\n\\n\nFrom the onset of the April 19 tear gas attacks by federal agents, President\nClinton already started passing the buck by saying ``Talk to the attorney\ngeneral or the FBI... I knew it was going to be done, but the decision was\n{\it entirely theirs}.  {\it They} made the tactical decision.'' Enter\nAttorney General Janet Reno.  After most of the Branch Davidians died,\nReno said she took ``full responsibility'' for the decision.  ``I approved\nthe plan'' she said adding that she ``did not advise him [Clinton] as to the\ndetails.''  In fact, she told Clinton that it was ``the best way to go.''\nAs the fire was roaring through the Branch Davidian's compound Clinton said\nthat he was ``deeply sadened by the loss of life'' and in the same breath that\n``the law enforcement agencies involved in the Waco siege recommended the\ncourse of action pursued today.''  Later he went on to say ``I stand by that\n[Reno's] decision.''\n\n\\n\nHow did this all begin?  At 0930 on February 28 agents of the Bureau of\nAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) launched a full-scale, high-profile\nassault on the Branch Davidian's compound.  This raid was much\nmore than an assault on a group suspected of possessing illegal weapons.  The\nassault was a planned media circus used as a propaganda device of the BATF\nto show their might and just purpose.\n\n\\n\nAt the onset of the ``no-knock'' raid, gaggles of heavily armed BATF agents\nmade their way inside the compound without identifying themselves or state\nthat they had a warrant until long after the shooting began.\nSilently, the agents made their way to the compound's buildings and started\ntheir ``search'' by charging at the buildings and throwing concussion grenades\nand ordering the cult members to come out of the buildings.\n\n\\n\nIf unknown persons dressed in black ninja costumes and combat fatigues\nwere to attack you, throwing grenades and brandishing firearms, would you not\nassume that these people are criminals and attempt to defend yourself?  The\ntactics employed by the BATF provoked the battle.\n\n\\n\nThe initial assualt by the BATF was not successful.  Unfortunately, lives\nwere lost on both sides.  But, had the assault been a success, the liberal\nmedia would have praised the BATF by showing the footage of BATF agents\ncarting away a bunch of gun-wielding religious nuts.  Of course, any\nviolation of the cult's rights would have been overlooked and the media\nwould proclaim America's fortune in having super-cop organizations like the\nBATF that can systematically ``take out'' terroristic groups such as the\nBranch Davidians.\n\n\\n\nAs far as I can see, the BATF and the FBI dropped the ball - just like\nPhiladelphia did in the 1985 MOVE crisis which left 11 dead, 250 homeless,\nand a city block razed.\nIt appears that the BATF has adopted the shoot-first tactic of no-knock\nraids to execute search warrants.  Don't let the BATF convince you that\nthe no-knock raid was justified.  No-knock assaults make sense when looking\nfor, say, drugs that can easily be hidden or disposed of in a few seconds.\nThe BATF was looking for illegal weapons, not drugs that could be hidden or\nflushed down the toilet in a matter of a few seconds.  What ever happened to\n``This is the police!  You are surrounded...''?  {\it This policy of no-knock\nraids, by federal and local agencies, should be restricted}.  Further, the use\nof military firepower against presumed innocent citizens is a very scary idea,\nand is why the Davidians were justified in using lethal force to ensure that\ntheir fourth ammendment rights [``the right of the people to be secure in\ntheir persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches\nand seizures''] are not denied.\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\noindent Matthew L.

On 23 Apr 93 00:18:59 GMT, Clayton Cramer observed:\n: # Can someone tell me why when Mr. Cramer spouts on about homosexuals,\n: # he only addresses homosexual men, and never, in any post I've read,\n: # addressed lesbians?  Granted, I stopped reading all his posts long, long\n: # ago, so perhaps I missed something. \n\n: Because women very, very seldom molest children.\n\nUn-hunh.  Yeah.  Right.  Sure.\n\nYou know that list of things that are stereotypically American -- Mom,\napple pie, etc.?  You don't hear too many stories about Mom being\na child molester, because such stories would simply be unAmerican.\n\nBut that doesn't say that it doesn't happen.
And this search procedure must also follow the rule of law.\n\n\nIt may, if necessary, when the search is executed in an illegal and\nviolent fashion.\n\n\nThese "criminals" were threatening the lives of NO ONE -- they were fired \non FIRST, according to a number of accounts.\n\n\nWrong.  Firing a gun at someone is lethal force, even if no one is hit.\nOf course, they DID hit AND kill people.\n\n\nYou are silly.  There are no such warrants in existence, Phill.\n\n\n\nThanks, Phill, for another example of that great socialist sensitivity.\n"Obey the government or die."\n\n*PLONK*\n--
Saw it in t.p.m., thanks.\n\n\n\n\nYes, and the individual is not omitted; I just didn't fully articulate the \nprinciples of Fractal Federalism.  All government powers derive from the\nPeople; each level can receive a new power from the level below through \nthe amendment process, where a true consensus (say a 3/4 majority) writes \nthat power into the Constitution of the level above (in the case of the \nlowest level, an amendement is passed by a 3/4 majority vote; in the case \nof higher levels, it must be passed by 3/4 of the legislatures.  We can\nof course haggle about the specifics of "true consensus" when we hold our \nConstitutional Convention :-).  Once a power has been granted, it may be \nexercised by the legislature.  Powers not in the original Constitutions must \npercolate upward, starting from the individual.  The ratification process \nfor the original Constitutions should involve consensus and not simply a \nplurality or majority.\n\nGranting a "right" in a constitution is of course the same as empowering\nthe government at that level to restrict the activities of the governments\nat the lower levels, so it operates in the same way as the amendment process \n(again, that crazy resemblance to the supposed-but-not-actual U.S. government \nstructure).\n\nThis government structure is a very frustrating one for those people (read-\n"liberals") who would like to have concentrated power to use the government\nto force people to do "good" (a difficult-to-define word, and one that it \nis difficult to reach a consensus on).  It is also a frustrating structure \nfor those who want to use the government to dictate personal behavior (read- \n"big-government conservatives").  I personally would rather see those types\nof people frustrated than the incredible erosion of liberty (both civil and \neconomic) that is going on now.\n\nThis is IMHO a "good" government stucture for those who see the role of\ngovernment as the protection of individual liberties, while still recognizing\nthat individuals need to have some influence in the type of community that\nthey live in.\n\n\n\n\nOne which maintains peace, liberty, and the opportunity for happiness for its\npeople, while working within the realities of human nature.  You do bring\nup the point (intentional or not) that a "lasting" idea is by no means\nnecessarily a "successful" idea.  I believe that Fractal Federalism would\nat least bring many ideas to light, and The People would have the opportunity\nto democratically choose between "good" ideas and "bad" ideas.  If the\nDocialists, er, I mean Democrats are right and government activism fosters a\nprosperous People, they will have a plethora of local opportunities to  \ncheck their thesis.  If Libertopia is possible, it will arise.  If a balanced\nConservative Republic is democratically received as the best level of\ngovernment activity, it will become clear to The People that it is best.\n\n\n\n\n\nRight, and people would not rescind any freedoms (read- "empower the\ngovernment") except through the amendment process.  That is how the Federal \nGovernment is supposed to work now, but the Supreme Soviet, er, I mean the \nSupreme Court put a stop to that "republican government" nonsense.\n\nIn my hypothetical government, if there were a constitutional provision\nempowering the government to regulate churches the government (whatever\nlevel we are talking about) could indeed ban churches.  The constitutional\nprovision would be invalid if a higher level had a constitutional provision\nprotecting free exercise of religion.  The uppermost Constitution is still\nthe Supreme Law of the Land.\n\n\n\n\nIt is a matter of individuals being able to control their own associations\nand environment, not a matter of suppression of ideas.\n\nOne dilemma of the human condition is that individuals need liberty, and\nthey also need to have some control over their environment.  In my\n"Fractal Federalism" government, certain "rights" are protected by the \nconstitutions.  Other "rights" are protected simply because the government \nhas not been empowered to infringe upon them.  When a consensus is reached\nthat the government should have a certain power, then freedom is infringed\nupon.  This cannot be avoided -- murder statutes infringe upon freedom,\nbut I think that the consensus of the American people is that murder statutes\nare a good idea.\n\nI am sure that many parents believe that they have a "right" to control\nthe environment that their children live in.  People feel that they have\na "right" to sleep peacefully at night; thus, there are noise ordinances.\nThere are zoning laws that keep businesses from overrunning residential\nneighborhoods.  I do not view these as bad things (certainly some individual\ninstances are bad, but the concept is not necessarily bad), I view them\nas the people in a community having some control over the type of community\nthat they live in.  I see the alternative as near anarchy.\n\nLike I said in another post, if you can come up with a scenario where an \nindividual can do something truly autonomously -- with absolutely zero\neffect on anyone else -- then no individual or government has the right\nto restrict that activity.  There are simply not very many behaviors that\nfit into the category of the truly autonomous, so the whole thing becomes\nan issue of one individual or group having power over another individual\nor group.  I think that the "Fractal Federalism" approach is a sound, if\nnot ideal, approach to limiting this restrictive power.  The libertarian \nscenario degenerates to "might makes right," and the system we have right\nnow is one of "lawyers abusing natural rights philosophy to decide what \npowers the government should have by subverting the democratic process \nthough the Supreme Court."\n\n\n\n\n\nI think I answered this above already, but let me expand a little more\nwith an example.  If I stand naked in front of your house and masturbate \nin front of your children while they play, in your libertarian (small 'l')\nscenario the only recourse you have is to yell at me.  "Autonomous" is\na value judgement 99.99% of the time, it is not a scientific reality with\na clear definition.  Exactly who would you empower to make that value\njudgement?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLots of people are long on complaints and short on practical solutions.\nAlthough I am pessimistic that my idea will ever bear fruit, I am at least\ntrying to be long on solutions also.  I am truly interested if you have\nany improvements to make on my ideas (I call them "my ideas", but they\nall come from an "average guy" reading of the U.S. Constitution without\nbenefit of the indoctrination of Constitutional Law academia).\n\n\n\n\nSorry, the confusion was my fault.  When I said that "Fractal Federalism" \nresembles the U.S. constitution, I meant it and thought it was pretty clear.  \nI should have more clearly explained that the ultimate derivation of government\npower is from the CONSENSUS of the people (although not the CONSENT of every\nindividual; a practical observation, not a moral judgement).  It is certainly \nbetter than having all government power derive from nine lawyers, which is the\nsituation we have now.  That is why I think the Supreme Court should be\na jury court, with a different jury for each case.  \n\nIt is certainly not perfect (no philosophy of government is), but do you still \nfind it a repugnant idea?  If so, what is your solution?\n\n\n\n\n\nI think that you misunderstood the structure of the form of government I\nadvocate, and it was my fault for not being more clear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe majority does not make the rules.  The majority (or possibly a \nplurality) simply elects representatives to exercise limited government \npowers; those limited government powers derive from a large consensus, \nnot a simple majority.  And the Federal Government, in my scenario, still\nhas the power to protect freedoms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt Freivald\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLiBORGalism:\n             THINKING IS IRRELEVANT.

The White House\n\n\n                  Office of the Press Secretary\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nFor Immediate Release                             April 23, 1993\n\n\n\n                     Background Information:\n\n                    Advancing U.S. Relations \n        with Russia and the other New Independent States \n\n                         April 23, 1993\n\n\nAt the Vancouver summit, President Clinton and President Yeltsin \nagreed to pursue a number of measures designed to implement an \neconomic and strategic partnership between the U.S. and Russia.  \nSince then, President Clinton has directed that a number of steps \nbe taken to move this process forward.  The Administration is \nannouncing a number of steps today in order to underscore its \ndeep commitment to a new and closer partnership with Russia based \non its government's commitment to reform.\n\n\nExecutive Review of Cold War Laws\n\nPresident Clinton and President Yeltsin discussed the \ndesirability of reviewing and updating U.S. laws and regulations \nto reflect the end of the Cold War.  Congress has already acted \nto revise many laws to reflect the fact that a communist Soviet \nUnion has been replaced by a democratic Russia and other \nindependent states.  However, many laws and regulations remain \nthat contain language and restrictions that fail to reflect the \nend of the Cold War and that unnecessarily undermine relations \nwith Russia and the other new independent states.\n\nThe President today has ordered an Executive review of laws and \nregulations so that, where appropriate and consistent with U.S. \nsecurity and other national interests, such provisions can be \nrevised or removed.  He has asked Ambassador-at-large Strobe \nTalbott to coordinate this review on an expedited basis.  The \nPresident has indicated that he will welcome congressional \nefforts to help this review proceed as quickly as possible.\n\nThis review will weigh all considerations that pertain to \nrevision of such provisions, and the initiation of the review may \nhelp to remedy some of the circumstances that have justified such \nprovisions in the past.  For example, because the Russians are \neager to have their status changed under the Jackson-Vanik \nlegislation, President Yeltsin personally assured President \nClinton in Vancouver that he would look into individual cases \ninvolving continuing restrictions on emigration from Russia.  By \naddressing such issues, this review can help strengthen the bonds \nof trust and partnership between the U.S. and Russia, and between\nthe U.S. and the other new independent states.\n\n\nReview of COCOM\n\nIt is also time to consider expeditiously with America's allies \nthe future of another Cold War institution -- the Coordinating \nCommittee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM).  The United \nStates has begun a thorough review of how to reorient export \ncontrols to the post-Cold War world, in which Russia is no longer \nviewed as a potential adversary, but as a potential ally in \ncombatting the proliferation of sensitive technology.\n\nSteps to Improve the Security Relationship\n\nThe President also has taken steps to move ahead on a range of \nefforts discussed in Vancouver that can strengthen U.S. security \nand improve our security relationship with the Russians and the \nother states.\n\n\nAccelerated Deactivation of Nuclear Weapons\n\nIn Vancouver, the two Presidents discussed accelerating the \nprocess of deactivating nuclear strategic systems scheduled for \nelimination under the START I Treaty.  President Clinton has \ndirected the Department of Defense to complete this process well \nin advance of the seven year reduction period outlined in START \nI.  In addition, the United States, together with Russia and the \nother relevant states of the former Soviet Union, will be \nexploring programs under Nunn-Lugar to help them to accelerate \nthis process.\n\n\nMultilateral Test Ban\n\nThe two Presidents agreed at Vancouver that negotiations on a \nmultilateral nuclear test ban should commence at an early date, \nand that the two governments would consult with each other \naccordingly.  The United States looks forward to beginning \nconsultations with Russia, our allies, and other states, on the \nspecific issues related to this negotiation.  The United States \nexpects to start this consultative process within the next two \nmonths.    \n\n\nDetargeting\n\nThe two Presidents also began a dialogue on the issue of nuclear \ntargeting at Vancouver.  As the United States and Russia move \ninto a new relationship of strategic partnership, there is a need \nto reexamine many of the assumptions and means employed in the \npast to safeguard U.S. security against a nuclear adversary.  The \nAdministration is beginning a comprehensive review of measures \nthat could enhance strategic stability, including recent \nproposals for detargeting nuclear missiles.   \n\nOther Measures to Create a New Security Relationship\n\nIn response to the incident involving a collision between US and \nRussian submarines last month, Secretary Aspin will be ready to \ndiscuss ways to avoid such incidents in the future with Russian \nDefense Minister Grachev during his visit to the United States in \nlate May.\n\nSecretary Aspin will also be prepared to move forward with \nDefense Minister Grachev in May to develop a combined training \nprogram between our two military forces and to prepare for joint \nexercises in peacekeeping, such as that authorized by the UN \nSecurity Council.  The United States looks forward to broadening \nsuch training and exercises to include other peacekeeping \ncontributors, in order to improve inter-operability, readiness, \nand planning for multilateral peacekeeping operations.  The US \nand Russia are working together to convene a May Ministerial \nMeeting of the UN Security Council to discuss proposals for \nenhancing the UN's peacekeeping capability and to move \nconsideration of the Secretary-General's Agenda for Peace from \nthe discussion to the implementation phase.  The U.S. is also \nworking with the Russians to focus specifically on improvements \nin the financing and management of UN operations.  The purpose of \nthese initiatives will be to cooperate on peacekeeping for our \nparticipation in UN or CSCE sponsored actions.\n\n\nMultilateral and Bilateral Partnership with Reform\n\nFinally, the Administration continues to move ahead on a range of \ninitiatives aimed at striking a partnership with economic and \npolitical reformers throughout Russia and the other states.  The \nAdministration is continuing work with our G-7 partners to \nassemble the package of multilateral assistance that Secretaries \nBentsen and Christopher recently negotiated in Tokyo.  And the \nAdministration is continuing consultation with Congress over the \nfurther efforts the U.S. will take to assist the process of \nreform in Russia and the other states.\n\n                           *    *    *\n\nThe Administration believes these steps can increase American \nsecurity while improving the relationship between the U.S. and \nRussia, and between the U.S. and the other new independent \nstates.
I don't want to attack anyone's personal opinions and thus have not\nincluded any articles - but it seems to me incredibly ridiculous\nand pompous for someone to sit back with the benefit of hindsight\nand point fingers at Clinton, Reno, the FBI, or whomever.\n\nFirst of all, it is a knee-jerk judgement.  The facts are quite\nmuddled at this point and will likely be for quite a while.\n\nSecondly, things do not improve by pointing blame and accusatory\nfingers.  Pointing fingers is a destructive action.  If everyone\nsat around pointing fingers all the time, nothing would get done\nand nothing would ever get any better.  And despite the tragedy,\nwe can learn something from this - if it is approached in a \nconstructive manner.  Doesn't it seem that working together is\nmore productive than working against one another?\n\nThirdly, it seems incredibly hypocritical to place blame given\nthe benefit of hindsight - something that those who made the\ndecisions did not have the benefit of.  Why not give them the courtesy\nof acknowledging that they did the best they could with the\ndata they had - in a very, very difficult situation.  Some\nresponses have gone so far to suggest that the actions were done\nwithout regard for the lives of the people in the compound - give\nme a break.\n\nBe part of the solution - not the problem.\n\nAnd that's MY opinion -
Do you mean besides the National Guard?\n\n	Outside of military reservations?\n\n	Besides national emergencies?
Oh are we Jill?  Let me tell you a story then...\n\nOne evening not long in this country a man, a parolee, a convicted KNOWN \nviolent crimminal lead police on high speed chase after breaking another law.\nHe decided that police had no right to do their jobs and enforce the law\nand assualted two of while attempting to resist arrest.  When police use\nmetal sticks to force him into submission we heard all the reason why certain\npeople in this country have and excuse when they refuse to obey the law, \nhow this was a perfect example of police oppression, how all the police\nhad to do was behave a certain way and all would have been finei, how nothing\nthe victim did could have possibly warranted the response - some blows with\na few sticks - he got from the authorities.\n\nFunny, how when it's Bloodbath Billy or his hitwench calling the shots,\na group of people who were bothering no one, were not know to have broken \nany law, who asked only that they be left alone to practice their religion\nas they fit, how it is now that the government is justified in assualting\nthose people with 100 heavily armed commandos simply because the gun \ngrabbers in DC thought these people had more guns thay they thought they\nshould have.  Now when it's the Clinton administration that has the blood\nof dozens on its hand AAAALL of a sudden it's the people who refused to\nhave their civil rights violated, it's their fault, those evil fanatics\nprovoked it...\n\nHow is it in the mind of the liberal Democrat-Clinton supporter that a\ncrimminal puke, scum bag, piece of garbage like Rodney King could not have\npossibly provoked the beating he got, but this bunch of wierdos could cause \na fifty one day stand off that ended with the burning deaths of all of them\nand their children, all by themselves with no help from the the police.  \nAnd to here people say they deserved what they got, to hear Clinton say\nthe blame rest solely with Koresch, what a cowardly piece of work that\nman has shown, again, himself to be.\n\nWE'RE blaming the right people.  It is you and others that defend ANY of the\nactions of the BATF, FBI or Justice Department in this matter, that with \neach word prove again and again the depth of the hypocrisy, the double\nstandard that people like the Clintons would hold certain Americans to. \nWhile at the same time allowing others to do as they please with only \nexcuses to offer their victims.  It's all to clear these days, from the\ncomments of the "president" and the rationalizations of his supporters\nin these groups, that in a liberal Democratic vision of America only\na certain select few people can expect to have civil rights enforced, \nand this administration intends to enforce laws, apply the Constitution\nand obey the laws only when it suits them to do so. \n\nThe Rooster\n\n				WARNING!\n\n                   By order of Heir Clinton and for your own\n                personal safety: Remember to maintain membership\n                 in ONLY BATF approved religious organizations.\n	 	   BATF approved religious services.
Now which is it?  Are you going to comdemn national media, then turn around\n and use it to support some position you present?  Seems somewhat contradictory\n doesn't it.\n\nI believe this true when we speak of physical data, in the\nsense of pure science.  But when we speak of data that revolve\naround social sciences then we have to be careful.\n\n\nI quite agree.  But these are cases or 'news events' that contain\npolitics, social science information, sociology, etc.  and at\nbest are reflections of the group that reports them.\n\nAs you have pointed out, it is difficult to report that the\ntemperature was 98 degrees when it was 60 degrees and have\npeople believe you.\n\n\nYes and no.  The survey presented, according to Mr. Cramer,\na value called the median- which one used this makes us \nbelieve that 1/2 of the males had 7.3 plus sex partners and\n1/2 of the males had 7.3 or less sex partners.  Homosexuals\nare purported to make up only 1%.  In this case, the majority\nof people with 7.3 plus sex partners are heterosexual.\n\nIt is my feeling that median was not the intended word usage.\nBut if it is then we have little evidence to support Mr. Cramer\nclaims about gay promiscuity > hetero promiscuity.\n\n Very good- this is a point that I have tried to bring out,\nand as any network news program will show you, it is true.\n\nThe News Media is a business and as such becomes skewed because\nof where its loyalties lie.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n Which is a helluva lot more than any Republican attorney general ever did!\n\n BTW, why all the crocodile tears over wasting a few religious nuts, who\n wanted to be wasted anyway?  We just got back from wasting a few hundred\n thousand religious nuts over in the Middle East, and everybody cheered!!
The fact that Reno is actually taking responsibility (gee--that's a new\none for a politician) is a new thing for a member of Clinton's administration.\nI actually respect her for having a backbone ( I never thought I'd say\nthat about someone from that bunch).\n\nThe way I understand what happened is that she discussed with Clinton\nwhat was being planned for Waco.  Clinton didn't say no, so gave de\nfacto approval for the operation.  Things got messed up, and a lot of\npeople died horrible deaths.  (if I am incorrect about this, please \nfeel free to correct it.  This is just what I've been able to pick \nup.)\n\nI've just got a couple of questions about this whole thing.\n(1)  Why did the government feel they needed to assault that compound?\n(2)  Why didn't they try to flush them out in the first week of\n     this fiasco instead of waiting 50 days.\n(3)  Janet Reno jumped up to take responsibilty to take heat away\n     from the President.  Does this sound anything like what a couple\n     of Reagan's aides did?
I find it very interesting that you say there will be 2.5 million\nqueers in the march on Washington.  The largest figure I've seen in\nthe press is 1 million and we all know how liberal the press is with\ntheir numbers. :)\n\nFor another thing, 1% of 250 million is 2.5 million not 6.  Maybe\nthat's where you got the 2.5 million number.  Also, the number cited\nin the actual report is 1.5% so that would be about 3.75 million.\n\nAs for this march on Washington, I wonder how much the media is\ngoing to inflate the numbers this time.  Last time, for the\npro-abortion rally, they more than doubled the actual number of\npeople who showed up.  That and all the stories coming out of how\nthe press "slants" the news really makes one wonder who's watching\nthe watchers.\n\nBCNU.
Yes the govt handled it in the Rambo Hollywood type style\nwith extreeme Machismo. Perhaps thats not the way to handle\nit. \n\nIt is a completely different thing to start asserting as many\nhave done that the government is primarily to blame. The comparisons\nwith the NAZIs in particular are purely gratuitous.\n\nSince you have provided a constructive opinion on the issue your\npost desreves to be taken seriously. Peter Nelson also made some\nvery good points about how a low key approach might have been \nmore effective.\n\nThe point is though that you learn through mistakes. The govt\nplayed the wrong card and lost. Thats not a big deal. They\nhad had four guys murdered at the begining and maybee they \njust were not prepared for wuite this situation. Who could be?\n\nIf the same thing were to happen all over again we might perhaps\nbe able to castigate the Govt if they used the same tactics and failed\nin the same way. As it is I can't say that I would not have made the\nsame mistake. Maybee I wouldn't because I don't as a rule go in\nfor a confrontational situation if I can avoid it. Maybee I would\nbecause with all those press about its very difficult not to try\nthe macho stuff.\n\n\nThe FBI had information from within the compound we had no access\nto. They may have calculated that the B-D followers resolve was\ncracking based on their listening devices within the compound. They\nknew that Koresh had chickened out of one suicide attempt. This\nmay have been the reason why they considered that fear might have \nbeen a weapon for breaking his resolve. Again in Panama they had used\nthe heavy rock music to great effect during Bush's invasion. Funny that\nfew of the Koresh supporters and appologists complain much about the\ndeath of several thousand Pananmanian civilians while the US govt attempted\nto arrest their former ally.\n\n\n\nKoresh negated his civil rights the minute his followers fired\non the police helicopter. No matter whether the warrant was or\nwas not technically valid the guys who were carrying it out \nthought that it was. Thus the assault on them was completely\ninexcusable no matter what rationalisation people might wish to\nemploy.\n\nOf course we have to consider the guns issue. That is the whole\ncore of the question. Everything else is a diversion.
THE WHITE HOUSE\n\n                    Office of the Press Secretary\n_____________________________________________________________________\nFor Immediate Release                                  April 20, 1993\n\n\n                            PRESS BRIEFING\n                       BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS\n\n	     \n                          The Briefing Room\n\n\n12:36 P.M. EDT\n	     \n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know, the President is going \nto come out at 1:15 p.m.  With your indulgence, I think what we'd \nlike to do is have the President award the National Teacher's Award \nfirst and then have the teacher leave, or whatever, and then he'll \nmake a statement on Waco and take a couple questions.  So if we can \njust hold off going live and all that until that's done, it probably \nwill work out a lot better. \n	     \n	     Q	  If you'll give us the time.  That's the problem.\n	     \n	     Q	  We've got a two-minute warning problem.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, it is a problem.  It's about \n1:15 p.m.\n	     \n	     Q	  The teacher would walk off and then --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's -- I'm just trying \nto work this out here.  I think that's the best way to handle it.\n	     \n	     Q	  Can I ask you a series of questions about the way \nthe President handled the notifications yesterday? \n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure.\n	     \n	     Q	  Did you, for instance, talk to the Justice \nDepartment about who would come out and discuss what had happened in \nWaco and whether it should be the Attorney General or the President?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Why don't we just take a step even \nfarther back from that and look at the whole sequence of events on \nthe contact between the Justice Department and the White House.  As \nyou know and as we've said, the President spoke with the Attorney \nGeneral on Sunday, Sunday afternoon.  They had a good discussion, \nabout 15 minutes.  The Attorney General informed the President of \nwhat she wanted to do.  He raised no objections.  Obviously, she had \nthe implicit authority from the President to go forward.  He raised \nno objections.  She went forward.  They had a discussion of a general \nnature about the incident.\n	     \n	     Again, yesterday morning around 11:00 a.m., the \nPresident spoke with the Attorney General again.  They had a brief \ndiscussion over what was happening in Waco.  As you know, this was \nbefore the fire broke out at the compound.  And I think that was why \nthere was some -- just some confusion.  I think that she was \nconfusing in her minds before and after the fire, not the actual day \nwhen they spoke.  \n	     \n	     Then there was a number of contacts at a number of \ndifferent levels in the White House yesterday afternoon between the \nJustice Department and the White House.  They were informing us of \n\ntheir decisions, what they would like to do.  There was an FBI \nbriefing in Waco.  The Attorney General had her press conference.  \nThe President then issued a statement after that.\n	     \n	     Frankly, yesterday afternoon, you know, there was a fair \namount of confusion over exactly what was happening on the ground in \nWaco, and I think that we wanted to be very careful not to have the \nPresident say anything until we had a much better sense of what was \nactually happening on the ground.  Once we were fairly clear on what \nwas happening on the ground in Waco, the President issued a \nstatement.  He spoke with the Attorney General again yesterday \nevening.\n	     \n	     Q	  At what hour was that?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It was quite late.  I believe it \nwas after he returned from the Holocaust Museum.  He took a tour of \nthe Holocaust Museum last night.\n	     \n	     Q	  And he went out to dinner.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe briefly.  Yes, he went to \ndinner and then he spoke with the Attorney General last night.  I \ndon't know the exact time; I think it was relatively late.  And he \njust said, I think as Dee Dee has reported, that he just wanted to \ntell her that he thought she handled a difficult situation very well, \nthat she did a good job in a tough situation, and that she should try \nand get some sleep.  He then, again, spoke with her this morning \nabout the follow-up in Waco, and about what they're going to do this \nafternoon.  As you know, the President will have an announcement to \nmake at 1:15.\n	     \n	     Q	  Did he ever talk with Webb Hubbell yesterday, last \nnight, or this morning?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, no.\n	     \n	     Q	  Was Webb Hubbell the point man for the White House?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Webb Hubbell is the general White \nHouse Liaison and several people talked to Webb.  The Attorney \nGeneral was running the operation.\n	     \n	     Q	  Did he tell her that she should sleep well, that \nshe had done a good job?  Or he just tell her that she should get \nsome sleep?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think sleep well -- done a good \njob -- I don't know the exact words.  I think that sounds right.\n	     \n	     Q	  I mean, sleep well has implications as to \nconscience and whether she should feel badly about it or not.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean, I think everybody \nfeels badly when you have a situation when --\n	     \n	     Q	  I understand that, but whether the issue of blame \nis brought up in that phraseology.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's the spirit -- no, it \nhas nothing to do with that.  The spirit with which it was offered \nwas that the entire administration and certainly the Attorney General \nhad to face a very difficult decision, a very difficult situation \nyesterday.  And that he thought that she had handled it well, as best \nas she could and --\n	     \n	     Q	  Well, does he think it was mishandled?\n\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- it was just speaking of warm \nwords to a friend.\n	     \n	     Q	  Does he think the situation was mishandled?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President --\n	     \n	     Q	  In retrospect?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President stands  by the \ndecisions of the law enforcement agencies, the decisions of the \nAttorney General.  He accepts full responsibility.  At the same time, \nI think that we all want to look to the future and figure out what \nexactly happened, do a full review, and make sure we do what we can \nto make sure this doesn't happen -- this kind of thing doesn't happen \nagain, or at least we know how to handle it.\n	     \n	     Q	  How much did he know about what she was going to go \nahead with?  I know that she made the case to him -- explained --\noutlined the case for action.  Did she say to him on Sunday precisely \nwhat action?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think it was specific \noperational detail as to what was going to happen.  I think that they \nhad a general discussion about the action, about the advisability of \naction.  I think, as she noted, he asked a few general questions just \ntrying to get a sense of how things were considered.  But it wasn't \nminute-by-minute detail of how the operation --\n	     \n	     Q	  Well, was it, "we are going in."  Is it, "we're \ngoing to use tear gas"?  I mean, what?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe it was that we want to go \nin and take some action that would increase the pressure on those in \nthe compound, and hopefully spur them towards some sort of movement \nout.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, was there ever a conscious political \ndecision made, or even a discussion about distancing the President \nfrom --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  I mean, we were in \nclose contact with the Justice Department.  The President accepts \nresponsibility for this.  At the same time -- I mean, we just wanted \nto be very, very clear about how this happened and be as factual as \nwe could be on how the decisions were made.  It is the responsibility \nof those on the ground to make recommendations.  The Attorney General \nhas operational control over this.  The President obviously accepts \nresponsibility for all of this, and he stands by the Attorney \nGeneral.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, there was a report on the television today \n-- and I don't know more than that -- one of the members of the cult \nhad said going into a courthouse that the FBI had started the fire \nand not themselves.  There was also a picture yesterday on the TV of \na smashing into the building  where the fire broke out.  And my \nquestion is, is the White House absolutely certain that this fire was \n--\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  All the evidence we have is that \nthis fire was started by David Koresh and those inside the compound \n-- every bit of evidence we have.\n	     \n	     Q	  Did the President ask the Attorney General why do \nthis now, why this particular date, and did he ask about possible \nconsequences of either death or injury?\n\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know the specific \nquestions.  He had general questions about how the decision was going \nabout being made.\n	     \n	     Q	  Those are general questions and did he ask \ngenerally, why now?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he asked, have you \nconsidered all of the consequences; have you considered the \nrecommendations?  I don't know if he asked the question, "why now?  "  \nI don't know if he asked that specific question.\n	     \n	     Q	  Did she tell him why now in terms of the stuff \nthat's come out since then about the information provided by the \nlistening device about Koresh getting increasingly more violent?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I'm not certain how much \nspecific detail they got into.  I know that she generally said that \nthis is the recommendation she's prepared to make, I mean, the \ndecision she's prepared to make.  It's based on the recommendations \nshe was receiving from the field and after intensive questioning of \nthose involved.  Again, I do not know how precisely detailed it was \nbeyond that.\n	     \n	     Q	  What is the President's understanding why \nyesterday?  One of the people who went into the compound a couple \nweeks ago came out over the weekend with some speculation that he may \nhave told law enforcement people something that precipitated this \naction.  Why yesterday?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  This is the first I've heard.  I \nthink what we can go to is what the FBI and the Attorney General has \nsaid.  There were indications that those inside the compound were at \nsome danger.  It was clear that the negotiations had broken down and \nit was the judgment of the experts involved in the negotiations that \nthe situation was not going to get any better at all.  \n	     \n	     There was also some concern over the vulnerability of \nthe agents themselves who had been working long beyond the time that \nthese teams normally have to work.  And as the Attorney General has \nsaid, there was some concern over the fact that they did not have \nreplacements in place who could stand in for them, and there was a \nconcern over the safety.  \n	     \n	     All of these factors came into play.  They also \nconsidered the advice of a number of psychologists and other experts \non David Koresh and those in the compound.  I would just go back to \nwhat the Attorney General has said.  You have to make the best \njudgment you can, given the information you have at the time.  They \ndid.  Obviously, we all regret the loss of life.  It's a terribly \nunfortunate situation.  We all wish it could have turned out \ndifferently, but that doesn't take away from the judgments that were \nmade at the time.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, when did the President know that they were \ngoing to use tear gas?  Was it before the assault on the compound?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I just don't know.  I don't believe \nhe was given a lot of detail on exactly how the operation would go.  \nI just don't know.\n	     \n	     Q	  Along that point, George, can you say whether the \nplan was presented to the President by the Attorney General as a way \nto end the standoff one way or the other yesterday?\n	     \n\n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was presented as a way \nto increase the pressure on those in the compound and, we all hoped, \nas a way to move some of those out and bring it in -- it wasn't \npresented as tomorrow is D-Day, this is it.\n	     \n	     Q	  Is the President satisfied that, A, he had all this \nrelevant information necessary to make a decision, and B, that Janet \nReno had all the relevant information necessary to make a decision?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, I think he's satisfied that \nthey were acting on the best advice and the best information they \nhad, and he's not second-guessing it in any way whatsoever.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, was there a 12-hour gap between \nconversations between the President and the Attorney General?  In \nother words, they spoke at 11:00 a.m. and they didn't speak again \nuntil Clinton got back from dinner at --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's likely, yes.\n	     \n	     Q	  Did he call her?  What time did she call?  Was \nthere a gap between when she called him?  I mean, was he at dinner \nwhen she called and --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no, no.  I think he called her \nlast night.  I couldn't swear to it, but I believe he called her last \nnight.  He just wanted to talk to her.\n	     \n	     Q	     what was going on?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not that I know of, no.\n	     \n	     Q	  What do you know about the situation now?  Everyone \nhas perished who -- except eight or nine?  And do you know any of the \nother details?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know any more details than \nthe FBI reported in Waco.\n	     \n	     Q	     watching CNN or how was he keeping track of what \nis going on?  If he wasn't talking to his Attorney General, how was \nhe keeping track of what was going on here?  I mean, with all due \nrespect to CNN, is that how he was doing it?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  There was also -- as I said, \nseveral people in the White House were in constant contact with their \ncounterparts at Justice to have the full and complete information.\n	     \n	     Q	  Who were those contacts?  I mean, was it Mack \nMcLarty, Webb Hubbell?  How was the President being kept informed?  \nThat's not a --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe Mack was in contact with \nWebb.  I spoke with several people at the Justice Department.  I \nbelieve Bruce Lindsey spoke with people at the Justice Department.  \nEither Bernie or Vince was also in contact at different times during \nthe day with people at the Justice Department.  We were fully briefed \nand fully informed.\n	     \n	     Q	  We were told this morning that the President may \nhave spoken -- a chance that he may have spoken with Webb.  Do you \nknow if that's true or not?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there's a chance he may \nhave.  I don't believe he did, but I think there's certainly a chance \nthat he may have at some point.  I don't believe he did.  I think \nthat the last contact he had during the day yesterday directly with \n\nthe Justice Department was the 11:00 a.m. phone call with the \nAttorney General.  But the White House was fully informed on a \nminute-to-minute basis of what was happening in Waco and what was \nhappening at the Justice Department.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, who decided that the briefing would be done \nby the Attorney General?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The Attorney General.\n	     \n	     Q	  Did you or did the White House communications staff \n-- were you ever involved with that decision?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  We were told about it.\n	     \n	     Q	  Did you ask her to go on Nightline and MacNeil-\nLehrer and all that stuff?  Was that part of --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.\n	     \n	     Q	     there was no advice from the White House at all \nabout her -- she was on all night, all day.  (Laughter.)\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, and she did a very good job. \n	     \n	     Q	  Why did you decide to have the President's reaction \nto the situation be only a written statement, which is traditionally \nthe White House's way of distancing the President from the issue, not \nhaving him appear as personally saying anything?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, that wasn't the intent at \nall.  As I said, we had to -- we wanted to wait until we had all of \nthe information at hand.  The President is also making a statement \ntoday.  The President made a statement yesterday morning.  The \nPresident has been fully involved --\n	     \n	     Q	  After this turned into less than a successful \noperation, the only statement from the President was what was on \npaper after the Attorney General had already given what amounted to \nthe major facts in this.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it was the first statement \nfrom the President, not the only statement from the President, number \none.  \n	     \n	     Q	  After the --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Number two -- well, the first.  \nNumber two, the Attorney General --\n	     \n	     Q	  He gave a statement early in the morning when the \nthing was starting to move --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.  And he gave one yesterday \nand he's giving one today.  Now, the second point --\n	     \n	     Q	  It just happens this was a written statement with \nno sort of communications policy or thought process involved?  It was \nthe President wants to put out a written statement?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Knowing what we knew at the time, \nwe thought it was appropriate for the President and he thought it was \nappropriate to put out a written statement expressing his regret and \nexpressing his support for the Attorney General's --\n	     \n	     Q	  Why was it not appropriate for him to personally do \nsomething?\n\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, he did personally do so.  \nThat is his statement.  It's a statement under his name.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, yesterday during the briefing you didn't \nsay the President took full responsibility for what happened --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I certainly did.\n	     \n	     Q	  No, what you said was --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's just not right, Susan.\n	     \n	     Q	  Well, I think you can go back to the transcript, I \nmean, unless I miss something --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'd love to.\n	     \n	     Q	     Janet Reno said that she took full \nresponsibility and you said that she made the decision, that the FBI \n--\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And the President takes \nresponsibility.  Absolutely.\n	     \n	     Q	  Took responsibility -- all right.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Check the transcript.\n	     \n	     Q	  Considering how little was known about what was \ngoing on inside the compound and, even now, how little is known, why \nis Washington calling this a mass suicide?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I think that knowing what we \nknow now and given all of the actions of David Koresh before and \nduring, it is painfully clear that those there were under his \ncontrol.\n	     \n	     Q	  It's stretching it a little bit where the kids are \nconcerned, though, isn't it, George?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that that is an entirely \ndifferent matter.  I mean, I think that David Koresh must bear \nresponsibility for the deaths of those children, absolutely.  But he \nclearly was intent on creating some kind of an apocalyptic incident, \nand that's what he did.\n	     \n	     Q	  You're still operating completely on assumption, \nright?  I mean, you have no evidence, or you know of no evidence that \nthis was mass suicide.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We have evidence that those inside \nthe compound set fire to the compound, which led to the deaths of \nthose inside.\n	     \n	     Q	  I didn't quite hear it.  This might be Ann's \nquestion, I didn't quite hear it.  But at what time did Clinton \nhimself put out a statement on this?  I know Dee Dee said some stuff \non this at 6:00 p.m., but the President put out --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  At 6:35 p.m., 6:40 p.m.\n	     \n	     Q	  Right after the evening news went on the air?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, right when we had all the \ninformation.  We were working on it.\n	     \n\n	     Q 	  Dee Dee confirmed this morning that the \ninvestigation the President is going to announce is going to be an \nadministration-run investigation.  Why not have someone from the \noutside to make sure that it's not colored by those who would have a \npolitical stake, particularly those at the ATF whose actions have \nalready been --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that clearly the ATF and \nthe Justice Department will bear responsibility for the \ninvestigation.  That's not to rule out, as is often in investigations \nlike this, having some sort of independent involvement as well.  But \nit will be run by the Treasury and Justice. \n	     \n	     Q	  Are you confident that you will not have any \nproblem getting --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, did the President reach out to anybody else \nto get advice after the meeting with Janet Reno?  And who else in the \nWhite House sat in on that meeting?  Anyone else from Justice?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't believe anybody else was \nthere at the time.  It was a phone call on Monday, it wasn't a \nmeeting.\n	     \n	     Q	  Sunday.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sunday.  It was a phone call, it \nwasn't a meeting.  I believe he might have been there with Bruce, but \nbeyond that, I think he just talked to the Attorney General.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, you said that in that phone call, she said \nthat we want to go in and take action, as you said, that will force \nhim out.  What did he think she was talking about?  If he didn't know \nabout tear gas, what exactly was his idea of what he was approving?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he was approving an action \nto increase the pressure on --\n	     \n	     qQ	   It didn't matter how she did that?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no.  I mean --\n	     \n	     Q	  What information did he have in terms of how this \nwould proceed?  Presumably he would have wanted to know, not minute-\nby-minute, but in a general sense --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he knew that this was the \nrecommendation of those on the ground and the recommendation of the \nlaw enforcement agencies.  I just don't know --\n	     \n	     Q	  What is "this" -- when you say that "this" was the \nrecommendation --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The action to increase pressure.  I \ndon't know exactly what he was told -- whether he was going to be \ntold that the tank was going to go up to the left wall and punch a \nhole in the window, or whether he was just told generally that they \nwere moving forward in a way that would increase the pressure.  I \njust don't know.\n	     \n	     Q	  It's hard to imagine him not asking, though.\n	     \n	     Q	     that Janet Reno presented him with as her best \nadvice about what they should go forward with, he would have agreed?\n	     \n\n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He was -- he did ask some general \nquestions about the advice and recommendation he gave.  At the same \ntime -- and I would repeat -- that this was based on the unanimous \nrecommendation of the law enforcement agencies involved.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, it would seem that this question about just \nexactly in what detail the President was informed about the nature of \nthe operation is going to come up again here and elsewhere.  Can you \ntake that question and --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  Yes.\n	     \n	     Q	     get the answer and come back to us with all of \nit?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n	     \n	     Q	  Can you tell us that there was never a meeting -- a \nstrategy session -- where you and others decided, we will put out a \nwritten statement from the President and we will have Janet Reno be \non all of these television broadcasts?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Never.  Never.\n	     \n	     Q	  And you never called the Justice Department and \nsaid to anyone or Janet Reno, "you're the one who needs to be out \nfront explaining this"?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not once.\n	     \n	     Q	  It just happened that way that she was the \nspokesman, that no one ever saw Bill Sessions until --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  She made a decision as Attorney \nGeneral that it was important for her as the operational officer in \ncharge, as the person who made the decision, to go out and take the \nquestions on this tragic incident.\n	     \n	     Q	  She had no guidance from the White House at all?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We certainly didn't object.\n	     \n	     Q	  But did you -- (laughter) -- no, I'm sure you \ndidn't object, but did you suggest it?  Was this a plan --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No. Absolutely not.\n	     \n	     Q	     a strategy?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.\n	     \n	     Q	  Did she clear it?  \n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.\n	     \n	     Q	  Did she notify you?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We certainly knew about it.\n	     \n	     Q	  What happened to this great detailed process you \nhave for clearing and talking to every public information officer and \nevery -- under every rock and every place in government that \nsomething as major as this could have occurred without a discussion \nbetween you and the public information people at least at the Justice \nDepartment?\n	     \n\n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The Attorney General made the \ndecision and the Attorney General wanted to go forward.  It seemed \nlike a good decision.  It was a good decision.  She did a good job.\n	     \n	     Q	  Let me ask it this way, George, if in hindsight how \nyou would handle it?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was handled very well.\n	     \n	     Q	  You wouldn't change a thing if --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Change what?\n	     \n	     Q	  The way the White House handled any part of it -- \nfrom start to finish.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I think that's an awful broad \nquestion and we're certainly going to have a review.  One of the \nreasons for the investigation is to look for ways in the future that \nsomething like this -- see what we can learn from an incident like \nthis and see what we can learn about how to handle them.  If you're \ntalking specifically about the issue of the press conferences, no, \nthere -- wouldn't make any change at all.\n	     \n	     Q	  Two questions:  First of all, on her going on TV, \nno White House people or outside media consultants came up with this \nidea?  It's just very reminiscent of what you guys did during the \ncampaign.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  How so?\n	     \n	     Q	  I'm thinking of like watching Clinton on Nightline \nafter the draft story; watching Clinton on --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There's absolutely no comparison.  \nYesterday there was a law enforcement incident.  The incident ended \nin tragic deaths of many, many people.  The Attorney General was \ninvolved in that decision.  The Attorney General made the decision to \ndo that.  She felt it was her responsibility in the interest of \npublic information to go out and take the questions of the press in \norder to make sure that all of the questions were answered, and she \ndid a fantastic job.\n	     \n	     Q	  The second question is, did -- as someone who knows \nClinton as well as you do, can you understand why it's sort of hard \nto believe that he might not have asked some detailed questions about \nwhat she intended to do?  In other words, she came and she said, I'm \ngoing to put pressure on them.  It's hard not to see Clinton, who's \nfairly intelligent and inquisitive, asking how.\n	     \n	     Q	  What kind?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Both the Attorney General said that \nhe did ask questions, he did ask general questions.  I don't have a \nminute-by-minute account of the conversation.\n	     \n	     Q	  How long a conversation?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was about 15 minutes.\n	     \n	     Q	  Telephone conversation?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, was the federal cost of this standoff ever \na consideration in terms of stepping up the pressure --\n	     \n\n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't believe so, no.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, you keep saying that the President takes \nfull responsibility, but then you refer to it as her decision.  Does \nthe President not accept the fact that as Commander-In-Chief, it is \nultimately his decision?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know what this has to do \nwith Commander-In-Chief.  This was a law enforcement action, not a \nmilitary action.  And he clearly takes responsibility for the \ndecisions of the law enforcement agencies involved taken in his \ngovernment.  I mean, I think there's just no ambiguity about that.\n	     \n	     Q	  But is he accepting it as his decision as well as \nhers, or is he saying it's her decision?  There's a difference.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As a matter of fact, it was her \ndecision.  He did not object to that decision.  He clearly takes full \nresponsibility. \n	     \n	     Q	  George, this briefing has gone on just a little \nover 15 minutes, and as you can see a lot of things can be exchanged.  \nWhat exactly did they spend 15 minutes talking about if it was just \nvery general?  That's a long period of time in a phone conversation.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It is an awful long phone \nconversation.  It was a very important phone conversation.  I think \nBrit has asked that we take the question, and I've said that I would.\n	     \n	     Q	  One of the things Reno said last night is that the \nbuck stops here.  I think that was her direct quotation.  Does the \nPresident agree with that in this case?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President says he accepts full \nresponsibility.  I think what the Attorney General was saying is that \nshe made a decision, that she's going to accept all the \nresponsibility that comes to her.  And she's not shrinking from that \nat all, but neither is the President. \n	     \n	     Q	  At any point in the conversation last night between \nthe President and the Attorney General or this morning, did she ever \noffer her a resignation?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge. \n	     \n	     Q	  Even before the fire was out yesterday, there were \nsome Republicans on Capitol Hill calling for an investigation.  Is \nthe White House at all concerned about the timing of those requests \ntrying to make political hay out of this situation?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  And I don't want to cast any \nquestions about the motives of those who are requesting \ninvestigation.  We want an investigation, and we'll have a full and \ncomplete investigation.\n	     \n	     Q	  In what forum will you answer Brit's question?  \nWill you put out a written statement?  Will you -- the wires?  How \nwill you answer the question that you've taken?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, can you remind us what the President was \ndoing all yesterday afternoon, where he was, and what meetings he was \ninvolved in?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'll have to try and remember.  He \nhad a series of meetings with different members of the staff during \n\nthe afternoon.  He was certainly monitoring the situation in Waco and \ngetting periodic reports on that as well.  He did see some on CNN as \nwell.  I believe he saw a fair amount of the FBI press briefing as \nwell.\n	     \n	     Q	  And those reports would have come to him from Mack \nMcLarty, would they -- do you think?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Mack talked to him, Bruce talked to \nhim, I talked to him.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, to follow Helen's question, in their \nconversation this morning did they discuss at all her statement last \nnight in response to the question about whether she would resign?  \nDid he say, I don't know why you felt the need to say that?  I'm here \nto reassure you that you don't have to do this?  Did that come up at \nall?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if it even came up \nthat specifically.  I know that the bulk of the conversation was \ndiscussing where do we go from here and what form the investigation \n--\n	     \n	     Q	   The didn't talk at all about her kind of \nremarkable comment last night about --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I believe she was asked a \nquestion.\n	     \n	     Q	  And her response was, if the President wants me to, \nI will.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Which would be, I think, the \nstandard response that most Cabinet members would give.  I mean, it's \na conditional statement.\n	     \n	     Q	     have a need to talk about whether -- personally \nabout whether the President wanted her --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they talked about \nit.  I mean, what I learned about the conversation was that it was \nlargely about the investigation itself.  And this just didn't come \nup.  I did not ask the question if they talked about --\n	     \n	     Q	  Will you take that with the Brit package?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Certainly.  (Laughter.)\n	     \n	     Q	  George, for the record, does the President want her \nto resign?  I know Dee Dee answered this morning --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely not.  He supports Janet \nReno.  She's a good Attorney General.  She's done a good job.  She \nhandled a difficult situation extremely well.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, does the President feel that he and Janet \nReno were let down by the unanimous professional advice from the law \nenforcement experts on the ground?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  And the President is not \nsecond-guessing that decision and those recommendations in any way.  \nThat is not to say that he doesn't regret the loss of life.  \nEverybody regrets the loss of life in this situation.  But the best \njudgments were made in a difficult situation based on the best \ninformation we had.\n	     \n\n	     Q	  George, the 15-minute conversation was the one on \nSunday, is that correct?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n	     \n	     Q	  How long was the one at 11:00 a.m. yesterday \nmorning?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  I'll take that \nquestion, too.\n	     \n	     Q	  Were these outside experts that they were \nconsulting with, or experts within the ATF and the FBI?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You'd have to ask them.  I'm just \nnot sure.  I know that there were several experts.\n	     \n	     Q	  And also, why weren't there replacements for these \npeople?  Is the unit that small?  \n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I think it is a very small \nhighly-specialized unit.  But I think it's one of the kinds of things \nthat the investigation will examine.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, isn't there a factor here involving the FBI \nDirector?  Normally, a president, when he wants to get information, \ndoesn't only asks the Attorney General.  I know the chain of command.  \nBut presidents talk to their FBI directors.  In this case, throughout \nthis entire siege, he has not felt that he could pick up the phone \nand talk to Bill Sessions, who is from Waco, and get expertise from \nhim on what to do and what not to do?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he talked to the FBI \nDirector well in the beginning of the situation when it first broke \nout in Waco.  At the same time, the Attorney General bears the \nultimate responsibility and he was getting fully briefed from the \nAttorney General.\n	     \n	     Q	  Don't you think the ambiguous situation that \nDirector Sessions is in has some impact on the way the President is \nbriefed and on the way that all of this evolved?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  I mean, it's perfectly \nappropriate that he be briefed by the Attorney General and that the \nAttorney General has supervisory authority over the FBI Director, and \nthat's following the chain of command.\n	     \n	     THE PRESS:  Thank you .\n\n                                 END                    1:03 P.M. EDT
I agree with the body of your post, but please reconsider your phrasing\nhere.  I think these ideas are selfish AND rational, which\nis commendable.\n\nDon't give selfishness a bad rap.  If we were all selfless there would\nbe no moral reason NOT to have a draft.  It [the draft] is the ultimate \nin mindlessly serving your fellow man with no thought to the importance\nof the self.
The first thing I would do would be to disband Medicare and Medicade!  They\nare a primary reason why health care costs are going up.  To cover the people\nthat are currently on these programs, I would sell their coverage in blocks\nto insurance companies.  The private companies would bid to get these large\nblocks of people, and prices would go down.\n\n    To get away from strong federal control on health care, I would pass off\nmore control to the states.  Everyone is always spewing forth about how \nwonderful Hawaii is doing.  Well, how about giving some other STATES incentive\nto try their own plans\n\n    What I would NOT do is try to implement some far reaching federal program\nprogram to cover all Americans, because this is the surest way to fail!\n\n\n\n   One sure way to stop throwing money away is to stop giving so much to the\nfederal government.  Our FEDERAL taxes should be slashed, and our STATE taxes\nincreased.  A strong central government always fails.  Give power back to the\nstates/counties/cities, where it belongs.
Our doctors' monopoly is exactly the same as in the U.S., if not\nmore powerful now that they can dictate insurance payment rates,\nbut I don't know an answer to this one.  Anecdotally, my friends\nwho are MD's (including my main buds from high school) talk about\nhow hard it is to turn "state's witness" against someone else ...\nno direct experience there, though.\n\n\nWell, what American private insurance plans cover travel expenses???\n\nSince our public insurance plans are publicly accountable, one can\nraise a stink in the media to try and extort benefits beyond which\none is entitled (hey, not Alberta's fault that he lives there) ... \nIf he lived in Cheyenne, WY his private insurance would've told him\nto go to hell for the travel expenses and that's that.  An HMO would\nhave just kept quiet and let him go blind.\n\n\nI don't think that this has been shown with the DMC ...\n\n\nIt's regular practice in a hospital to figure out who needs to get\nat what facilities.  Don't Americans have to arrange in advance for\noperations too?  I think that there are two standards being applied\nhere, and that Canada can't give Beverly Hills-style treatment to\neverybody.  It's not a big brother list ... it's more like calling\naround town for a table for dinner ...\n\n\nYes, and the Tories in Ottawa are trying to make them do that rather\nthan hope for a bigger grant from the feds and their province the \nnext time around.  Whether it's using mop a couple of weeks longer\nor even selling services to Americans (remember, our system is cash\nbased and since our health care infrastructure is overbuilt except\nin specialties that require larger populations to generate business,\nwhy not?  The alternative is closing unused wards ... business.).\n\n\nYou answered the question yourself ... "private nonprofit foundations\nhave to make money somehow", and I think that it's about time that\nthey acted like the private hospitals that they are.  Personally,\nI'm fed up with Canadian socialists trying to tell everyone that\ntheir health care is free when we are actually buying insurance\n(that's one at you, Bob Rae!!).\n\n\nSince we have always been evaluated in an OECD style, I don't see\nhow ... remember, OECD counts both private and public funds, and\nin Canada like France and Germany, 30% of health care spending is\nprivate funds (i.e., not the basic health insurance money).\n\n\nMinor copayments can flush out abusers.  Remember that our "system"\nis only an insurance policy.  But our costs aren't rising fast\nenough to ensure adequate copayments/deductibles ... last year,\nQuebec's user-fee proposal came out with the number of "$5" as\nthe necessary hike that could be done through a copayment rather\nthan give the QMA a raise.  And it's not contract time yet, as\nfar as I can tell from UPI Clarinet ...\n\nEven the new Reform Party, a breakoff of traditionalists from the\nConservatives with a mildly "libertarian" faction, holds our public\nhealth insurance as an untouchable but that just a few people have to\nbe reminded that it's not free (the average Canadian/European is more\nfiscally naive than their American counterparts on issues like these).\nBut no mention of copayments anywhere to be seen ... but cutting public\nspending all over the place, and bringing back the death penalty, with\nlittle haste if elected.\n\n\nSorry! (-;  It's just that I even run into people from Buffalo\nand from Michigan who don't know ...\n\n\nYeah, but there'd be a lot of lead-time and a health-care crisis that\nwould preclude it.  If provincial governments (as bad as some of them\nare; heck, we have the NDP cleaning up a spending mess made by the\nConservatives in Saskatchewan - embarassing!) can be so irresponsible,\nthere is still reallocation --- health insurance is so important that\nit's about the only thing that can inspire open rebellion and violent\ninsurrection outside of the hockey rink.  Right now, attempts to get\nthe system and its users to learn good habits are being treated like\ncod-liver oil ...\n\n\nMost Americans are fearful of a single-tier system ... (-;\n\nSeriously, there are few areas that have sufficient population for a\ntwo/more-tiered system like what the French have ... a health policy\nprof, D.G. Shea, has cited studies in the NEJM that indicate having\na population of 500,000 is necessary for adequate competition ...\nand in Canada, there are only four cities west of the Great Lakes\nwith that population or larger.\n\nAnyways, the numbers show that costs have held steadier than those\nin the U.S. and barring any future Chernobyl-like crisis, sudden\ntransients in spending are unlikely.  In fact, the health allocation\nis one of the most well-behaved sectors of spending up north so any\ntalk of bankruptcy is talk-radio fodder far away from the border.\n\n\nThis won't be overnight, and something like this would force Canada\nto have a system more like the French one ... but that's not a bad\nthing, and the change will be minimal (i.e., add copayments and\nfrustrate the socialists chanting "Hey, it's *free*!").\n\ngld
Back your statments with proof, or shut up.\n\n\nAgain, back your statements or shut up.\n\n\nHmm...  Tell me, did you go to the Mickey Mouse school of logic?  You have\njust stated that there are not many homosexuals as Kinsey reported in his\nsurvey (and the surveys of the Kinsey Institute since).  Then you say that\nthe reason many young people are promiscuous is because homosexuals form\na large part of that group, or there are some homosexuals whose lives \nconsist of having sex, with no gaps for eating &c.  Using *your* logic\nit would seem to suggest that on average gay men have about 2000 partners each\na week!  Try to think through your arguments carefully.  Or then again, not,\nbecause I like to laugh every now and then.\n\n\nHence the argument cannot be resolved using this data.  Next point, please.\n\n\nThis depends on the premise that there are only three types of behaviour: gay, bi\nand hetero.  This has yet to be proved.  See an earlier post about the Kinsey\nInstitute of grading.  This, although rough, seems more logical.  Also you use\n"this would show", defining a fact and not an assumption.  Again, back your \nstatements or shut up.
...\n\nI must object to the characterization of those opposed to the\ngovernment's handling of the Waco situation as "gun supporters".\nYour argument tries to paint the BATF critics as right-wing\ngun nuts, and just mixes up two issues.\n\nI am one of the BATF/FBI critics, and yet I am a liberal\nand just as anti-gun as you are.  I just happen to believe\nthat everyone has civil rights, even religious crazies.\nThey're all human beings, not some nest of wasps that\nyou're trying to exterminate.\n\nThe BATF created the crisis situation by the way they handled\nthe original raid.  It was well known that Koresh regularly\nwent jogging outside his property.  He could have been served\nwith a search warrant then.  He could have been arrested if\nhe had refused to comply.  Instead officers armed with grenades\ninvaded the property.  This escalated into a shooting war\nwith tragic deaths on both sides.\n\nThose were the first two mistakes:  the bad judgment of\nasking for a no-knock warrant, and the bad and probably\nillegal way the already-unwise warrant was served.\n\nAt this point, the situation escalated to where it was\ndescribed as an armed standoff and a hostage crisis.\nThat's when the government started covering their traces,\nsealing the warrant, revising their reported history of\nthe incident, etc.\n\nThings were already building up to disaster.  Now the\ngovernment could have simply closed the supply routes\nand waited.  But according to Janet Reno, that option\nhad "never been seriously considered".  So, supposedly\nbecause the agents were "frustrated and fatigued", and\nbecause there supposedly were no backups, they felt\nthey had to go in.\n\nNow it's entirely possible that Koresh was responsible\nfor the fire.  If that's so, he deserves the blame\nfor the deaths of the people in his compound.\n\nBut the government's hands are far from clean.\nTheir first raid demonstrated bad judgment plus\ncontempt for the 4th amendment.  The motivations\nfor the second raid are just too unbelievable.\nAnd their coverup of the events of the first\nraid undermines their credibility in anything\nthey do thereafter.  We have only some very\nbiased FBI agents' word for what happened.\n\nAnd please let's not turn this into a pro-gun vs. anti-gun\ndiscussion.  Anti-gun people do not believe that gun-owners\ndeserve to get frontally assaulted by armed government\nagents.  And Koresh's civil rights exist whether his\nguns were legal, illegal, illegal-but-should-have-been-legal,\nor whatever!
But you stated that this study was presented in a very accurate and\ndependable way.  This is confusing to the issue.\n\nAnd if you read this title it implies that; gay sex (homosexual sex)\nactivities are low compared to the general population that they surveyed.\n\n\n        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nWell let us quibble- look at the above statement that you posted, I have marked\nit with '^^^^^^', IT STATES THAT 1% ARE EXCLUSIVELY HOMOSEXUAL- IT STATES 2% ARE\nOR HAVE ENGAGED IN HOMOSEXUAL SEX.\n\nAnd please not the use of adjective here "HOMOSEXUAL SEX".\n\nNow I stated that if we take 1% as homosexal this is a valid viewpoint.
Sorry, but I just wanted to be the first hypocrite to say it. I hope\nI'm not too late. Has everyone been watching their local/national\npoliticians?\n\nRick
# Recent studies have shown that the number of men who have\n# engaged in homosexual activities in the last decade is 2.3%\n# and the number of men who are exclusively homosexual is 1.1%.\n# These figures are much less than those that came from earlier\n# studies that showed that homosexuality among men is a lot\n# higher.\n# \n# So, what can we deduce from these figures?  Are there a lot\n# less male homosexuals than there used to be or are men\n# (perhaps women too) not as honest as they used to be about\n# there sexuality?  Presumably, the people that were polled in\n\nYou mean, in the 1940s, men and women were much more open about\ntheir homosexuality than today?  Want to try that one again?\n\n# this survey were assured of their anonymnity so they should\n# have answered the questions honestly I suppose.  However, it\n# could be that gays feel so repressed and denigrated by society\n# that they didn't feel that they could be forthcoming about there\n# sexuality in something like a survey.  If this true then is it\n# possible that there is a lot more gays out there than we are led\n# to believe?\n# \n# Perhaps if Americans were more open about there sexuality---I think\n# most Americans aren't---then we might discover that there are really\n# quite a few more people out there who are orientated toward the same\n# sex---men and women included.  I'd venture a guess that there is a\n# lot of people out there who have considered having a relationship\n# with someone of the same sex at some point in there life.  Maybe they\n# didn't take their longings seriously, but this doesn't make these\n# longings any less valid.  Therefore, if Americans weren't so\n# repressed about their sexuality in general---as I believe they may be\n# ---then we'd see a lot more people "coming out of the closet".\n\nYou mean, ignore study after study, so that we can continue to \naccept a study (Kinsey's) that is obviously wrong?  \n\n# As for myself, I'm a heterosexual and I've never considered having\n# sex with another man.  That's just the way I am...I could have just\n# as easily of been gay I suppose.  One of the big debates about\n# homosexuality is whether or not it's a type of behavior that is\n# learned or if one is just born that way.  IMHO, the more likely\n# explanation is that it's some combination of the two.\n\nBased on what, besides your own warm fuzzy feelings?\n\n# Here's something to ponder upon:  have any of you gay-bashers out\n# there ever considered that homosexuals probably deem their sexual\n# orientation as being a state of affairs that is just as much an\n# intrinsic and "natural" part of their life as heterosexuals do\n# about their own sexuality?  In other words, someone who is *truly*\n\nAlcoholics share that feeling, until they hit bottom.\n\n# gay may not be able to live any other way.  Even if they date someone\n# of the opposite sex or get married, in their *heart* they are still a\n# homosexual.  Likewise, if someone who is *truly* heterosexual forms\n# a relationship with someone of the same sex, then they are *still*\n# a heterosexual even though outward appearances may suggest otherwise.\n# \n# Scott Kennedy,  Brewer and Patriot\n\nUnless, of course, the problem is that homosexuality is a form\nof mental disorder, caused by childhood sexual abuse, as a number of\nrecent works suggest.\n\nIf homosexuals would stop using the government to impose their\nmorality on others (antidiscrimination laws) and leave our children\nalone, I wouldn't care in the least what they did in private.  But\nuntil they get over the liberal notion that the proper role of \ngovernment is to tell peaceful people how to live, I have no choice\nbut to continue to point out that homosexuality is not an "alternative\nlifestyle," but a sickness.\n\n# Before:  "David Koresh is a cheap thug who interprets\n#           the Bible through the barrel of a gun..."  --ATF spokesman\n# After:   "[The ATF] is a cheap thug who interprets\n#           [the Constitution] through the barrel of a gun..."  --Me\n\n\nGood signature!

You don't know much about the fall of Diem's government in Vietnam.\n	Or the traditional Indian practice of Suttee. People have been\n	burning themselves to death (or willing to go through such and end)\n	for political and religious reasons since the beginning of time.\n	Also, death from smoke inhalation is little better than dying from\n	the flames themselves.

THE WHITE HOUSE\n\n                    Office of the Press Secretary\n______________________________________________________________\nFor Immediate Release                             April 20, 1993     \n\n	     \n                       REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT\n                IN PHOTO OPPORTUNITY WITH VACLAV HAVEL\n	     \n	     \n                           The Oval Office \n	     \n\n5:00 P.M. EDT\n\n\n	     Q	  Mr. President, President Havel is here for the \nHolocaust Museum opening, and you toured the museum last night.  All \nthis focus on the Holocaust, how does that weigh on your decision-\nmaking process as far as Bosnia is concerned?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think the Holocaust is the most \nextreme example the world has ever known of ethnic cleansing.  And I \nthink that even in its more limited manifestations, it's an idea that \nshould be opposed.  You couldn't help thinking about that.  That's \nnot to compare the two examples.  They're not identical; everyone \nknows that.  But I think that the United States should always seek an \nopportunity to stand up against -- at least to speak out against \ninhumanity.\n	     \n	     Q	  Sir, how close are you to a decision on more \nsanctions on Bosnia?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, of course, we've got the U.N. \nvote.  Ambassador Albright was instrumental in the U.N. vote to \nstrengthen the sanctions and they are quite tough.  And we now are \nputting our heads at the business of implementing them and looking at \nwhat other options we ought to consider.  And I don't have anything \nelse to say, except to tell you that I spent quite a bit of time on \nit and will continue to over the next several days.\n	     \n	     Q	  Following your meeting today, sir, are you any \ncloser to some sort of U.S. military presence there?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  I have not made any decisions.\n	     \n                                 * * *                               \n	     \n	     \n	     Q	  President Clinton, why have you decided to meet \nwith Mr. Havel?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I'm just honored that he would \ncome and see me.  I'm glad he's here in the United States for the \ndedication of the Holocaust Museum.  He is a figure widely admired in \nour country and around the world, and a very important person in \nEurope, and a very important person to the United States.  So I'm \nhoping that we'll have a chance to talk about the new Czech republic \nand what kinds of things we can do together to support the causes we \nbelieve in.
]Furthermore, in response to an earlier message, the 1992 U.S. est. output of\n]sulfur dioxide (20 mill. tons) was equivalent to the entire output by the recent\n]eruption of Mt. Pinautubo(Sp.).  Currently world carbon dioxide levels set at approx.\n]360 ppm, in the past 120,000 years it has never gone above 280 (this info\n]was found using ice core samples from the joint French/Russian/U.S. Vostok\n]project).  Furthermore,  the background emmisions of chlorine compounds into\n]the atmoshpere is about 0.6 ppb annually, it now sits at 3.5.  This OVERWHELMING\n]data/info is found in the World Resources doc. published by Oxford University.\n\nGood evidence.\n\n]The ozone hole in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres keeps getting bigger\n]and stickin' around longer whilst skeptics ponder how wrong or corrupt all this\n]data from government and international scientific institutions is.  It is a pity, that,\n]if the skeptics are wrong and we base our complacency on their Limbaugh\n]psycho babble, then we will find ourselves strapped by limited options with\n]which to rectify the primal engineering of our industrial age.\n\nWhat ozone hole in the northern hemisphere?\n\nWhat exactly will happen if we get an ozone hole in the upper atmosphere?\nAccording to the senior chicken-little at NASA, as much more UV radiation\nas if one moved 100 miles south.  Certainly not the calamity that is being\nimagined by eco-lunatics.  \n\nCO2 is going up.  So what.  There's no evidence that the increase is\ndue to burning fossil fuels, no evidence that increasing CO2 will increase\ntemperatures, and no evidience that raising temperatures will do anything\nbut good--ie make millions of acres of tundra into productive life-bearing\nland.
Do all those who are saying the government is responsible for the death\nof those in the compound also say that the Isrealis are responsible\nfor the death of the Isreali athletes at the Olympics? Hey, the\nPalestinians and the Dividians COULD have given up peacefully ('yeah,\nand monkey could fly out my butt' - Wayne).
These surviving witnesses being members of which cult pray tell ??\n\n\n\nWe were having a discussion about whether Bush would have done anything\ndifferently. On the basis of Panama, Grenada, Tripoli, Kewait etc we \ndecided that Bush would have asked for a surgical airstrike  or used a \ncruise missile, some people suggested that he would have used the nuke\nwarhead cruise, others pointed out that he would be too cheap to use 'em.\n\nWhat was missing? Armoured vehicles! \n\n\n\nThe person who murdered 17 children was Koresh. He kept them there and \nbrought about their deaths deliberately.\n\nYou may consider that I am a complete bastard and a not very nice chap.\nThats quite true. I don't pretend to be. Being nice is what amateurs\ntry to do. If you want to talk politics you are talking hard decisions\nsuch as whether the lives of the troops should be risked attempting\nto rescue the children. Anyone who has held the office of President\nof the United States since FDR has held the threat that if the USA\nor its allies were to be threatened then the USA would risk nuclear \nHolocaust in order to protect freedom. Beleive it or not, that is not\nthe sort of threat that nice chaps make. Do they have a gun nutters\nsection of the US version of CND by any chance?\n\n\nThere are cases where society has to be protected from\nmadmen such as Koresh or Hitler. If it were not for the consideration\nof the 17 children in there the question of the tactics to be used would\nnot be a matter of anything but academic significance. It is not for\nthe govt to prevent people from commiting mass suicide.\n\nThe latest reports are that cult members were shot attempting to\nleave the compound by Koresh loyalists during the fire. If proven\nthat would entail the final nail in the coffin of those who want to\npromote Koresh as some sort of role model or hero.\n\n\nI need hardly add that it is Koresh that has created the Holocaust in\nthis case by the deliberate arson of the ranch appocalypse.
:So we try to ensure that the process of deciding whether to introduce\n:third parties isn't random.  As Steve said above, there are examples\n:where third parties *are* less ignorant or corrupt than the two\n:primary parties; should this knowledge not be able to help?\n\nOf course it helps,  but only if the decision to involve third parties\nis the primary partis' to make.  A corrupt and ignorant third party\nisn't going to say,  "we're corrupt and ignorant,  we'll stay out of this".\nPointing out that they are corrupt and ignorant won't help,  they either\nwon't believe you or won't care.\n\n\n:>  It's impossible (or at least beyond my abilities) to formulate a rule\n:>that will always tell whether the involvement of a third party would be\n:>good or bad,  but there's one that seems better than any other I've ever\n:>heard suggested:  voluntary good,  mandatory bad.  That is,  a third\n:>party should involve itself in a transaction ONLY at the request of\n:>the primary participants.\n:So we *don't* formulate a rule that will always tell; we try to use\n:knowledge about other properties of situations.  To some of us, it\n:appears that trying always to apply "voluntary good, mandatory bad"\n:is not only less than optimal, it is in some circumstances seriously\n:damaging.  The interesting question is to characterize those\n:circumstances as best we can.\n\nLook,  somebody has to have the power to decide whether a third party\nwill regulate your transactions or not.  That somebody is going to\nbe either you or the third party.  You can argue until you are\nblue in the face that regulators shouldn't get involved (in fact,  people\nhave tried this),  they won't listen.    The fundamental question you\nhave to ask is,  whose decision is it whether or not to involve regulators,\nours or theirs?  After you've answered thed first question,  you can\ntry to move on to such questions as "should regulators be involved" and,  if\nso,  "what regulations are appropriate?"  Although with your answer to\nthe first question,  the second and third are taken out of your hands.
Larry King Live was both telling and sickening.  Every other word\n    out of Janet REno's mouth  was "the little children" ,etc.  Sounded\n    like Clinton talking.  She made claims that the children were \n    beaten, etc, DESPITE the pronouncements of social workers that none\n    of the children who left the compound were abused.  But the REAL\n    crime:\n\n\n      Larry King, and his censored show.  NOT ONE FUCKING QUESTION\n      about Reno's possible error.  Just two calls about how she\n      had made a "good decision".  Now, it doesn't take a rocket\n      scientist to figure out that SOME people are going to be upset.
Koresh & some of his followers were tried and found *innocent* of\nall charges following that shootout.  Were you unaware of this or\ndid you purposly leave out this fact?
You should be aware that the US Army was called to "fight"\n(and did) WW I veterans (bonus marchers) who marched on\nDC demanding bonuses they were promised for service.\nBecaues of the depression, they wanted them early.
: # #The median number of sexual partners for all men 20-39 was 7.3.\n: # Don't forget that 25% had 20 or more partners....\n: Not surprising.  Remember, that study includes homosexuals as well.\n\nImplying, no so tacitly, that homosexual men are more promiscuous than\nheterosexual men.  Interesting, especially in the wake of a news report\nlast week about a group of high school seniors (heterosexual, I might\nadd) who boasted monthly conquests of up to *67* girls *each*.  It\nseems that promiscuity is not limited to homosexuals.\n\nThis is a sad fact of life: no matter what you look for -- whether it \nbe homosexual promiscuity, racial discrimination, or sexual harassment\n-- you *will* find it.  Whether or not it actually exists where you're\nlooking.
1. You haven't shown any disproportionate involvement.\n\n2. The Janus Report, which came out recently, gives 9% as the percentage\nof exclusively or predominantly gay men.\n\n3. No one is presumably going to say they're gay if they're not. But\nsome no doubt are going to hide their homosexuality in surveys. Thus\nthe 1-2% is a lower limit.\n\nI still say that weighing all the evidence gives a most likely percentage\nbetween 5 and 7%.\n\nBrian
