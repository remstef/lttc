Hello. I am the David Sternlight keeper of the FAQ. Unfortuantely I cannot\nfind it at the present time.\n\nFrom the original FAQ:\n\nQuestion: Does anyone take David Sternlight serious?\n\nFact: No one takes David Sternlight serious. They review his opinions and\nin most cases immediately discard them or jerk them over to\nalt.fan.david-sternlight which actually should be alt.flame.david-sternlight.\n\nA photograph of David Sternlight for the curious:\n\n\n\n                         |\/\/\/\|\n                         |       |\n                         |  (o)(o)\n                         C       _)           David Sternlight\n                          |  ,___|            Net.Police\n                          |    /              a.k.a.

Oh? What about the precedent in which nuclear weapons information was\npublished in "The Progressive"? I was under the impression that the\ncourt held that prior restraint could NOT be used. Any lawyers out\nthere?\n\n--\nPerry Metzger		pmetzger@shearson.com
I cannot believe you can make these claims given hard evidence of\nabuse.  Do you ignore stories about survellience of Martin Luther\nKing, have you blocked from your mind McCarthy's crusade in the 50's?\n\n\nAnd how many illegal wiretaps are performed?  Funny, but I'll be that\nthe FBI doesn't keep statistics on these!\n\n"confidential informer" = illegal wiretap\n\n/-----------------------------------\\n\-----------------------------------/
I suppose after Waco, it's only prudent to leave the "to the death" part out.
Does anyone know where I can get a hold of some secure encrypting chips\nor devices before they are banned completely?!?\n\nSteve
Yes there is, the patent can be classified as secret.  I recently\n	saw a patent from 1947 (dealing with nuclear weapons technology)\n	that was only declassified in the last couple of years.  There\n	is of course the problem of enforcing the patent.\n\n\n	This is absolutely right.
Y'all got the first two reversed.
Right.  People here believe the government is listening in on\neverything.  Sure.  If you can't provide an answer, change the\nassumptions to something you can deal with.\n\nIt's not a matter of the government listening on on everything, it's a\nmatter of the government listening on anyone they take an interest in.\nSay, if you do something heinous like attend a computer meeting at a\nmall, the Secret Service decides to go for a warrantless search, and\nacquires your name.  It's a matter of any number of possible wiretap\nabuses that cryptology makes far less likely, and this chip can\nsabotage. \n\nPar for the course, though.  I predicted that you'd be jumping in in\nfavor of this.  The reply was that you'd justify anything up to and\nincluding death camps as long as the government backed them and had a\nwritten policy statement.  Perhaps a little extreme, but not much.
Steve>   Hmmm... given the error corrections in modern audio CDs, is\nSteve> it sufficient to simply instruct your agent to decrypt using\nSteve> the bit stream from the second cut of the latest Garth Brooks\nSteve> CD, or are the usual number of bit errors found acceptable in\nSteve> commercial CDs because of that error correction enough to\nSteve> garble the message if such a method is used?\n\nOne unreliable data point: while looking over the shoulder of a\nrecording engineer, I decided that he was seeing a raw error rate of\nabout 1 in 1e6 on a CD ``master.''  Both the extrapolation to\nmass-market CDs and my state of mind while doing the arithmetic (I was\nwaiting for him to finish so we could go get something to eat) are\nquestionable.
My interpretation of Denning's description is that S1 and S2 are chosen\nrandomly by agents of the key escrow companies at the start of each 300-\nchip programming session.  I imagine that the chips are in a carrier which\nwill allow them all to be programmed fairly quickly - there would not be\na need to transfer chips one at a time into a little PLA programmer as some\npeople have envisioned.\n\nMy guess as to why this procedure is used is that basing the keys on the\nS1 and S2 using a specified algorithm provides an (in-principle) checkable\nway to verify that no back doors exist in the choice of the random numbers\nused to generate the keys.  Since we have to trust the escrow companies\nanyway, it does not weaken the system to have the keys be generated from\nrandom seeds entered by the escrow agents.  And since the algorithm for\nkey-generation is public (modulo Skipjack secrecy) then in principle an\nagent could challenge the procedure, ask for S1 and S2 to be exposed, and\nrun his own independent calculation of U1 and U2 to verify that that is\nwhat is actually being put onto the floppies.\n\nAnd yes, there are many ways in which failures to follow this scheme could\nbe hard to check.  The laptop probably will not really be destroyed each\ntime.  Hidden cameras in the ceiling could see the S1 and S2 entered by\nthe trusted escrow agents.  Back doors in the chip could allow U to be\nrecovered.  Heck, each chip could be recorded with the same U, ignoring\nwhat was on the floppy.
Pat Myrto says if law enforcement wants keys, let them get a court order and\nthen ask him for them.\n\nMost use of probably cause wiretapping warrants isn't to decrypt historical\ntraffic, but for prospective listening once probably cause is established.\nPat's approach would tip off the crooks.\n\nDavid
Why don't we move down even further toward the masses by setting this\nup on an IBM PC clone(probably needs to be a 386 or a 486) with a \nsound blaster and a V.32bis modem.  Those components are very widely\navailable.  I don't know if the PC has enough horsepower to encrypt the data\nat realtime, but the sound blaster has 4 to 1 hardware compression and will\nwork at any sampling rate from 4KHz to 23 KHz.\n\nDoug Holland
In what way David?  Our government is totally out of control,\n	whether you realize it or not.  I know you find it painful to\n	think of your old buddy Uncle Sam as evil but it's true.  Other\n	democracies have fallen before.  Ours is on its way and knee-jerk\n	sheep that instinctively trust government are helping it slide.\n	Power corrupts David, why is that so hard to understand?
I have been scanning and trying to read the articles in the sci.crypt area,\nbut what do I get?   SURPRISINGLY, the blurb comes upon the screen " file xxx\nhas either been cancelled or expired.       Now I ask you, If it expired,\nwouldn't it be out of the available file cache?\nI am 32 and not a paranoid, but the older I get, the greater my cynicism of\nboth federal and state governments becomes.    \nThe censorship  of this Internet (and it is no less than censorship [stupid me, it's the GOVT.])\nis ridiculous.  The Japanese have far outstripped our ciphertechnology,  and \nour government is now, before your very observant eyes, trying to force the\n"crypto standard" onto a framefork where the "standard" is now an ancient\nrelic in terms of modern Japanese security techniques.\n\n\nNow, I pose the question: Why censor folks on the net and send the warning\nshown above ("cancelled or expired") when it would be wiser to not let people\nsee the post at all??\n\n\nWhich Article of the Constitution gives me the right of revolution if things\nseem to be going cockeyed??\n\n\nHmmm...
I'd use a secret (nope, obscure) cryptographic encoding to expand the \n30 bit serial number to a 64 bit block. The redundancy hereby introduced \ncan be used to detect tampered Clipper signals where some public enemy \nreplaced the L.E. block by random data. \n\nAnd of course the L.E. block would be used to initialise the encryption \nof the user data so that at the receiving end the correct L.E. block must \nbe processed in order to have any chance of getting the plaintext back. \n\nFor those of you who might want to mangle the L.E. block (e.g. by xor-ing \na constant pattern) on the transmission line and restore it before feeding \nit into the receiving Crippler Chip I would add further encrypted copies \nof this block (perhaps created by repeated application of the encryption \nalgorithm or so) at regular intervals during the transmission. If the \nreceiving chip detects a mismatch it must assume that the line is bad and \nit will cease to work; in your own interest you are protected from getting \nfaulty plaintext, you know -- it's just like a checksum for your own \nsafety ;-(. \n\nThe `monitoring agencies' won't have the famous black box which is needed \nfor actual decryption and will be kept by the FBI; but nothing prevents \nthem from using special boxes which will do the redundancy check for the \nserial number block and consistency checks on the embedded L.E. blocks \nwithin the transmission. These boxes will turn a red light on as soon as \nthey detect a bitstream that violates the correct protocol.\n\nSo don't anyone think that you can use the chip and fool L.E. about the \ntapping key -- I bet the developpers have provided much better checks \nthan those suggested above. Of course it's absolutely crucial that the \nalgorithms (and protocols) remain secret. Personally I doubt they will.

I'm not sure it has been established that the government can\n	prevent you from sending an algorithm abroad.  The NSA seems\n	to have won by intimidation so far.  Why don't you try it? ;-)\n	Of course you could just distribute your algorithm widely for\n	free and screw them up big time.  (That would be my approach ;-))

Again we have the trust in government problem here. Members of \nMr. Sternlight's generation trust the government to a degree which\nmembers of my generation find ridiculous. I would suggest that Mr. Sternlight\nread about the COINTELPRO program, or about J. Edgar Hoover, or about\nthe wire-tapping of Martin Luther King, then, after he has digested this\ninformation he can ponder the fact that while the government does not\ntap every conversation that they have a record of tapping many conversations\nthat they have no right to, even under their own laws. Given the long\nhistory of members of the US government ignoring the laws that apply\nto them, it is no wonder that so many people in here sound so paranoid, and\ngiven the fact that it is often difficult or impossible to punish these\nindividuals once they are discovered, it is no wonder that so many people\nin here have so little faith in the escrow proposal for Clipper.
This doesn't work, due to the near-field far-field effect. You may stop\nsomeone five yards away from listening in, but someone fifty yards away will\nbe relatively unaffected - unless you pump out hundreds of watts and jam all \nthe neighbourhood TV's as well. In that case the government will stomp on you -\nask any radio ham! Democratic governments care even more about their voters' \nright to watch soap operas than they do about national security, and dictators \nconsider their propaganda to be an integral part of their national security.\n\n\n\nI'm afraid this doesn't work either. We can pick up laptop screens without any\nproblem.\n\nMost of the so-called `low radiation' monitors are also useless. The description\nturns out to a marketing assertion rather than an engineering one.\n\nWe thought there might be a market for a monitor which was not as hugely\nexpensive as the military Tempest kit, but which was well enough shielded to\nstop eavesdropping using available receivers. We built a prototype, it works,\nand it's still sitting on my lab bench. Commercial interest was exactly zero.\n\nIn the absence of open standards, a monitor which really is `low radiation'\n(and costs 500 dollars more) can't compete against a monitor which just\nclaims to be `low radiation' (and whose only extra cost of production is the\npretty blue sticker on the box).
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\n\nGasp!\n\nI've just spent 3 hours catching up on sci.crypt here (slow reader I\nguess) and I really have to put out a few comments too.  First, let me\nflame the famous Dave S. : He's obviously only 10 years old.  Cut him\nsome slack. :^}\n\nThe joke about Clinton/crypto/drugs slammed me thru the roof.  Nice job\nguys!  I've been working on marijuana legalization for over 5 years\nnow, Clinton's actions so far have really helped.  But because of\ngovernment action taken against various other groups, I have developed\na 64 bit DES based on public literature to protect my mailing list.\nThe S-boxes are the critical component, and since I chose 32 out of 57\nbased on the key, cracking this DES is going to tough.  (The reason it\nslows you down a touch is that for each key you try you need to use a\ndifferent set of s-boxes, I know it's only a vector, but it sure makes\nrandom search a pain).  Several marijuana legalization groups have had\ntheir mailing lists confiscated when people were charged with drug\nuse/sales.  It's not a crime to be a member of a legalization org,\n*but* you will be watched.\n\nIt really is important to write a letter to every official you\npersonally vote for to explain *why* your privacy is being destroyed by\nthe "cripple chip".  Amazingly enough they do listen when they get\n*enough* mail.  The Doonsbery jokes about NRA postcards are real, and\nthe IMI (Illinois Marijuana Initiative) has grown to the point where we\n*are* seeing some changes.\n\nIt's pretty clear that all the hullabaloo is really about the\nimplimentation decision being made behind our backs.  As Vesselin\npoints out, this was common practice in communist regimes (and may be\nagain depending on how the vote goes).  But just as criminals have guns\nand "law abiding" citizens don't, and criminals like me have marijuana\nand "law abiding" subjects don't, criminals like me will have secure\ncrypto while "law abiding" robots don't.  PGP is nice, but as time goes\non we all can do better.  And to save our hides we will.\n\nSomeone posted an excerpt from Machiavelli.  He's my favorite dude.\n500 years ago he saw clearly how people *are*, and tried to explain\nthat to "princes" who wanted people to *obey*.  One section not quoted\n(I've got "The Prince" at home, so I'll just paraphrase :) ) had to do\nwith conquring a free city.  The only way is to *completly destroy*\nit.  Failing that, you must appoint locals to high positions and accept\nthe people's customs.  Even after 100 years of oppression, a people\nwill remember their heratige and rise up to overthrow the oppresive\ngovernment.  And he gave an example.  And that was 300 years *before*\nThomas Jefferson.\n\nThere were questions about watching traffic.  Only *interesting* traffic\nis watched: stuff that goes overseas and comes back; stuff with keywords\nlike marijauana, cryptography, NSA;  certain individuals who are known\nsubversives, etc.  It is easy enough to store all that traffic.  So if\nyou know how to be *subversive* i.e. how to be unseen, it's pretty easy\nto go unnoticed for a long time.  The stronger your crypto system and the\nless you're noticed, the better your chances of developing an organization\nwhich can diseminate truth to the masses.\n\nWhich gets me to the thread about a "public encrypted conference".\nThat's just silly.  The first thing the feds do is send in an\ninfiltrator (like Dave S.) and they know what you're doing.  It will be\nfun for teenagers and college students, but for the real world it's\npretty pointless.  Crypto is useful for more things than hiding where\nyou get your marijuana.\n\nGuns, drugs and crypto do have some commonality: there are people in\ngovernment who want you to *obey* their rules.  As Lundquist says in\nalt.drugs "Live free or don't".  Machiavelli pointed out that's just\nhow most people actually live, inspite of appearences to the contrary.\nIt's true that the decision to shove the clipper (not the same thing as\nIntergraph's!!!) down our throats violates the principles of what the\nU.S. was founded on, but the government is full of idiotic robots\ncalled bureaucrats and there's less to worry about than one might\nthink.  Only really innocent (read naive) subjects of the U.S. will be\nhurt by this, the rest of us *criminals* will live in secure freedom.\nde Toqueville pointed out 150+ years ago that the tyranny of the\nmajority will be mitigated by the mediocrity of the government.\n\nAnd given what I see government officials doing where I work (Argonne\nNational Lab.) the level of stupidity makes Dave S. look smart.\n\nPatience, persistence, truth,		work: dvader@hemp-imi.hep.anl.gov\nDr. mike				home: mrosing@igc.org\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: 2.2
a\nfollow-on\n\nGlenn,\n\nThanks for posting that.  I was surprised to notice, however, that one\nquestion I might have expected to be asked was not:  "Are all forms of\nstrong encryption other than the Clipper to be made illegal?"  Speaking\nof which, is anyone aware of whether that question *has* been asked of\nany knowledgeable or official spokesperson for the government?  I have\nnot yet seen it mentioned in any of a dozen places it might have been\nreported, but I could have easily missed it.
Great slogan!  I'm ready to sign up with a crypto-lobbying effort (though\nI wouldn't want to do it through an NRA offshoot).  Shall we also push\nfor the CRA  -- Cryptographic Rights Amendment ??

Since the FBI's account of what happened is being contradicted on an\nincreasingly frequent basis by other officials investigating the\nfire, the most pernicious idea of all is believing that Big Brother\nis going to be well-behaved with respect to cryptographic keys.\n\nIn light of the very serious allegations with respect to the DOJ\nselling software to various other intelligence services, what do\nyou suppose the chances are of some future DOJ selling escrowed\nkeys to business firms?\n\nTrusting the government to be honest and fair is putting the \nfox in charge of protecting the chickens.

In the article "At last! Now you can talk to your computer." in the May\nissue of FORTUNE magazine, it was mentioned that phoneme prediction\nused Hidden Markov Modeling.  This was the statistical method that Markov\ndeveloped to predict letter sequences in Pushkin's novel, _Eugene Onegin_.\nIt was then said that this technique worked so well that the NSA used\nit to crack codes.\nDoes anyone have any references for HMM and how the NSA used it?\nOr is this just an extension of the letter frequency tables that we\nare all using anyway?
There is one point I'd like to make, that most people seem to have forgotten.\nThat is that one of the underlining principles in the Constitution is a DISTRUST\nof governmental authority and control. All those "checks & balances" is because\nthey realize that you should distrust those in power. What everyone seems to have\nforgotten as well is the original reason that the Bill of Rights guaranteed the\nright to bear arms. It's inclusion was not to allow you to protect yourself\nagainst other citizens, but to prevent the government from taking away your only\nmeans of protecting yourself from an armed and aggressive government. Its hard to\noppress your citizenry when its armed against you.\n\nI am not a fanatic, I'm a retired Naval officer. Because I have spent so much\ntime defending it, perhaps I understand its "purpose" as well as its "plan".
>Remember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see\n   >the cryptosystem design.\n\n   I hope there are some silicon jocks on the committee who can follow\n   the algorithm through to hardware.  While I doubt the NSA would pull\n   any monkey business on this point -- they have to expect that the\n   chip will be reverse-engineered sooner or later -- it's an obvious\n   opportunity to introduce additional holes.\n\nThe chip isn't the place to pull the monkey business - you do it in\nthe key generation, either by having a mathematical backdoor,\nor by having the program on the laptop that supposedly generates the\nkeys also save a copy of S1 and S2 and leak it out somehow,\nor by having the program that supposedly puts the official keys\non the chip actually put a *different* key there (VERY hard to detect,\nsince the escrow agents have to either trust the NSA laptop or\ngive each other the S* keys, and they still don't know the algorithm.)\nOr have the chip-burner at the factory make copies of the keys.\nOr whatever.
There are chips which perform the voice compression/expansion.  They can't\nbe expensive, because they exist in many phones connected to PBXs or on the\nPBX line cards, as well as in a lot of equipment which compresses\nvoice-grade circuits to save the cost of long-distance, leased T1s or\nsatellite circuits.\n\nI can't remember the generic term for these chips.  My impression is that\nthis was a big deal 10 years ago, but circuits have gotten so cheap that\nit isn't done much now.\n\nLew

Following is a short note commenting on den Boer and Bosselaers'\nrecent work on the MD5 message-digest algorithm. Feel free to email\nquestions or further comments.\n\n-- Burt Kaliski\nRSA Laboratories\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\documentstyle[12pt]{article}\n\begin{document}\n\n\title{On ``Pseudocollisions'' in the MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm}\n\author{Burton S. Kaliski Jr. \\\n{\tt burt@rsa.com} \and\nMatthew J.B. Robshaw \\\n{\tt matt@rsa.com} \and\nRSA Laboratories \\\n100 Marine Parkway \\\nRedwood City, CA  94065}\n\date{April 23, 1993}\n\n\maketitle\n\nA message-digest algorithm maps a message of arbitrary length to a\n``digest'' of fixed length, and has three properties: Computing the\ndigest is easy, finding a message with a given\ndigest---``inversion''---is hard, and finding two messages with the\nsame digest---``collision''---is also hard. Message-digest algorithms\nhave many applications, including digital signatures and message\nauthentication.\n\nRSA Data Security's MD5 message-digest algorithm, developed by Ron\nRivest \cite{rfc-md5}, maps a message to a 128-bit message digest.\nComputing the digest of a one-megabyte message takes as little as a\nsecond.  While no message-digest algorithm can yet be {\em proved}\nsecure, MD5 is believed to be at least as good as any other that maps\nto a 128-bit digest.  Inversion should take about $2^{128}$\noperations, and collision should take about $2^{64}$ operations.  No\none has found a faster approach to inversion or collision.\n\nRecent work by den Boer and Bosselaers \cite{den-boer-md5} presents\na special kind of ``pseudocollision'' in MD5's\ninternal compression function, which maps\na 512-bit message block $x$ and a\n128-bit input state $s$ to a 128-bit output\nstate. They show how to find a message block $x$\nand two related input states $s_1$ and $s_2$ that yield the same\noutput state: $f(x,s_1)$ = $f(x,s_2)$. Their well-thought approach\nexploits structural properties of the collision function to find \na pseudocollision in about $2^{16}$ operations, much less than one\nwould expect.\n\nPractical implications of this pseudocollision work to the security of\nMD5 are not evident. While a real collision in MD5 implies a\npseudocollision (or a ``pseudo-inversion''), a\npseudocollision need not imply a real collision. Indeed, a real\ncollision, since it involves two different messages, would almost\nalways involve {\em different} message blocks $x_1$ and $x_2$ such that\n$f(x_1,s_1) = f(x_2,s_2)$, but the pseudocollisions have the same\nmessage blocks. Moreover, the input states $s_1$ and $s_2$ would\ngenerally be unrelated, but the pseudocollisions' input states are\nthe same except for four bits.  There does not seem to be any way to\nextend den Boer and Bosselaers' approach to anything beyond the\nspecial pseudocollisions, a limitation they readily admit.\n\nIt is reasonable, therefore, to believe that MD5 remains secure. While den\nBoer and Bosselaers have found interesting structural properties in\nMD5, the properties seem only to lead to special pseudocollisions\nand not anything approaching real collisions. Further research, of\ncourse, will give a better understanding of the strengths of MD5 and\nother message-digest algorithms, with the eventual hope that\nsuch algorithms can, in some sense, be proved secure.\n\n\bibliographystyle{plain}\n\begin{thebibliography}{1}\n\n\bibitem{den-boer-md5}\nBert den~Boer and Antoon Bosselaers.\n\newblock Collisions for the compression function of {MD5}.\n\newblock In {\it Advances in Cryptology --- Eurocrypt '93}, 1993.\n\newblock Preprint.\n\n\bibitem{rfc-md5}\nR.L.

You're reading far too much into this (aside from the obvious fact\nthat you shouldn't hold anybody to what they wrote in a 10 year old\nbook in a rapidly changing field like this.)\n\n\nQuite simply she says that the security should not DEPEND on the\nsecrecy of the algorithm.  A secret algorithm can still be secure,\nafter all, we just don't know it.  Only our level of trust is\naffected, not the security of the system.\n\nThe algorithm *could* be RSA for all we know, which we believe to\nbe secure.\n\nThey have a much better reason to classify the algorithm than to\nprotect its security.  They want to protect its market share.\n\nIf they publish the algorithm, then shortly manufacturers would\nmake chips that implement the algorithm and standard but do not\nuse a key stored in escrow.  And of course, everybody would buy them.\n\n\nThe whole push of this chip is that by establishing a standard that\nyou can only use if you follow their rules, they get us to follow\ntheir rules without enacting new laws that we would fight tooth and\nnail.\n\nQuite simply, with Clipper established, it would be much harder for\nanother encryption maker to define a new standard, to make phones that\ncan't talk to the leading phone companies.   The result is tappable\ncryptography without laws forbidding other kinds, for 99% of the\npopulace.\n\n\nTo get untappable crypto, you would have to build a special phone that\nruns on top of this system, and everybody you talk to would have to\nhave an indentical one.\n\nThat's the chicken and egg of crypto.  The government is using its\nvery special ability to solve chicken and egg problems of new\ntechnologies to control this one in a way they like.\n\n\nIt's almost admirably clever.  When the EFF started, I posed the question here\n"What are the police going to do when they wake up and discover they\ncan't wiretap?" and nobody here had an answer (or even thought it was\nmuch of a question)\n\nThen came the backdoor and Digital Telephony bills, which we fought.\n\nNow we have their real answer, the cleverest of all.
Please post to news, too.
I heard somewhere (can't name the source) that TEMPEST does not necessarily\npick-up just CRTs, but it can pick up emissions from almost any chip.  If\nthat is true, the kind monitor would not make any difference becuase everything\non the screen can be picked-up from the video controller.  Can anybody verify\nor refute this?
Is the U used in the law enforcement field from the phone which placed the\ncall, from the unit whose 'start secure session' button was pressed first,\nor does each phone transmit its own law enforcement field?  Even assuming\none of the first two choices, the FBI is going to get a fresh N,U for its\nown database about every other phone call, eventually accumulating keys for\nall the phones used to connect to the line they are monitoring, not just\nthe 'suspects' key.  (Assuming the ever-thrifty FBI doesn't forget each key\nafter its wiretap permission has expired.)  Not quite a pyramid, but not\nbad, either.
About 50 people so far have asked, "Once the FBI gets your Clipper keys,\nwon't they be able to read all your future and past traffic?"\n\nThere has been no response from NIST, NSA, Ms. Denning, Mr. Hellman, or\nanyone else who might be able to give us an authoritative answer.\nThis is troubling.\n\nDidn't NSA think about this?  Or is it a feature, and they thought we\nwouldn't notice?\n\nI would have thought that by now they would have responded with something\nof the form, "Well, that won't be a problem because ...."\n\nVery curious.
I don't think that this should be worked on just in the context\nof cryptography. That's sure to pose all sorts of problems for all sorts\nof people.\n\n	What's needed is for someone to develop a portable telephone\nquality speech<->RS232 converter. Imagine, if you will, a little box that\ntakes data on its serial port and puts out sound, and takes sound and codes\nit to signals on its serial port. Full duplex. Now, this device is not a\ncryptographic device. It's a portable poor man's sound blaster or whatever\nyou want to call it. It's got loads of perfectly legitimate applications\nfor:\n	a) speech synthesis (with a few nifty libraries and some samples)\n	b) speech recording for electronic messaging\n	c) building voicemail systems\n	d) internet talk radio\n	e) internet relay chat\n\n	Of course, some of the electronic messaging in item b might be\nencrypted, possibly realtime, but that's the user's decision. One would\nneed 2 of these talky boxes and a pair of modems and some kind of cutout\nto switch over, and some code on, say, a 486 laptop.\n\n	I'd really like to see such a thing developed so that interactive\ninternet talk radio could be done. Ideally, though, it should be a general\npurpose device. It should be a general purpose enough device that nobody\nshould be able to balk at its widespread use. Obviously, to make it easy\nfor homebrewers, it should use pretty common hardware.\n\n	It's interesting to note that I'd already talked with a couple\nof folks about building such a thing, before this whole clipper thing\nstarted. I even went so far as to track down a couple of folks who are\nable to make sample units, given incentive and some time. I'd envisioned\nfinding a couple of folks interested in such a project and helping fund\ndevelopment of a public domain board layout and parts set, that could\nbe published in the form of CAD drawings for a couple of major CAD\npackages, and in PostScript.\n\n	Anyone interested? I'll start a provisional mailing list. Let\nme know if you want on.
To paraphrase, I may not agree with what you're encrypting, but I defend\nyour right to encrypt it.
How about half a friend?  The Motorola Codex preliminary V.Fast modem\n(which you can by right now) does 24.4 kbps (raw) over standard phone\nlines.  28.8 kbps is what is usually claimed for the "final" v.fast,\nbut you can't go out and buy that right now, the standard isn't done yet.\n\nAgain, voice can be compressed quite well down to 4000 or 8000 bps\ndepending on how good you want it to be, but that requires a DSP or a\nspecial ASIC to do in real-time.

I've got an idea that would remove most of the political complaints\nI have about the Clipper chip.  Pass a law stating that if, within a\nyear of performaing a wiretap on someone, a police agency hasn't\nmanaged to convict the suspect of the crime the warrant/wiretap was for,\nthen that agency owes the suspect $1 million to repay him/her for\nlost privacy.\n   Of course, there are *still* problems with the technical aspects of\nClipper, and with the one-size-fits-all mentality that would be behind\nan attempt to enforce it as a standard.  But this would be a way for\nthose in favor of allowing continued wiretaps to assure us that it will\nonly be used in cases where the crime is important and the police are\nall but certain that there really will be a conviction....

I think it very unlikely there are back doors in clipper, for two reasons:\n\n1. The government doesn't need them if it can get the key (and yes, I assume\nthat the "official" government obeys court orders, etc.--and that the design\nof the chip and its approval were "official");\n\n2. It would defeat the whole purpose of providing secure crypto for American\nbusiness that couldn't be read by our economic adversaries. If this were not\na legitimate and genuine purpose, and as many think, the NSA can read DES,\nwhy bother otherwise?\n\nRational responses preferred to conspiracy theories, thanks.\n\nDavid
brings up the issue of how the escrow agent will be paid, and the fact\nthat the government had financial leverage if they don't cooperate.\nIt's an important issue, especially if one of the escrow agents\ndecides they'd rather stop offering the service. \nI assume that if the escrow agent isn't the government,\nthen the contract for providing escrow service would include some\ntermination clause like returning the keys.\n\n\nBut who's the user paying the fees here, and what's the service?  \nIf the user is the government, then the funding's not separate from the government.\n\nIf the user is the buyer, what's the service?  \nKeeping the key for me?  No thanks - I don't need, and won't buy their service!\nNot telling everybody my key?  Sounds like blackmail!\n\nIf the user is the manufacturer, does the user have a choice about buying?\nThe alternative is to just generate the key and not escrow it, which is fine -\nI'd certainly pay more for this kind of key than an escrowed key!\n\nFace it, the escrow provider is providing a service the users don't want.\nThe only people who want it are the government, not the users.\nWhat you're really talking about is either the government paying for\nthe service, up front or per-year, either from general taxes,\nor from a special direct tax on wiretap chips, or on an indirect tax\n(forcing the manufacturer to pay the fee to the escrow agent.)\n\nI hope the escrow people have no way of finding out your name from\nyour serial number, especially if the escrow is a government agency.\n\nHere in New Jersey, we have lots of people willing to provide that\nsort of services for user fees.  There are people willing to keep your\nstore from burning down for a small monthly fee, though sometimes people\nrefuse to pay and discover that the service really was effective.\nIf you go to a baseball game at Yankee Stadium, there are people who\nwill watch your car in the parking lot for a small user fee.\nSomething could scratch the paint, after all.\nAnd what a shame if your Clipper key got out!

It depends on the mode you're using.  For a single 64-bit input block, a\none-bit error will have a 50 percent chance of corrupting each of the 64\noutput bits - in other words, it essentially turns the output block into\na random number.  If you're encrypting data in CBC mode, however, only the\none 64-bit block will be affected.  The next block, and all that follow it\nwill be decrypted properly.\n\nIt's a good idea to have some kind of error correction in your system if\ncorrupted bits are likely.
Hmmm.... CELP takes up about 12.6 MIPS for full duplex, and has been\nimplemented on about a million DSP chips... the 56001 card in my PC only cost\nabout $700, and I'm sure once demand goes up the prices would drop. The Analog\nDevices 21020 board that we're looking at now cost about $500 (academic price).\nI don't think hardware is something to worry about... if you get it working,\npeople will snap up internet phone cards like there was no tomorrow.\nWhat we need here is a good implementation of CELP (the government code is\nabsolute crap, I got a 30% speedup after looking at it for a couple of hours),\nand modifications to pgp to allow it to compress/decompress 144 bit frames\nevery 30msec... I think the AD21020 should have enough juice for this (50MIPS).\nAs part of the project I'm working on now, we're trying to get CELP up and\nrunning in realtime full duplex mode... I gotta find the source to pgp and\nsee how tough it would be to integrate the en/decryption parts into the code.\nI'll play with it.

You should probably use numbers much larger than 64-bits.  Also, you\nmay want to include some randomly-generated bitstrings in your protocol.\nThis way, if someone should find the shared key you and another person\nuse on one day, they won't be able to guess it for the next day....\n \n   Ie A sends G**A mod P and random string R0\n      B sends G**B mod P and random string R1\n \n      Both find (G**A mod P)** B mod P = Shared Key, then both calculate\n \n      Session Key = Hash(R0,Shared Key, R1)\n \n   Also, you will want to make sure that you're getting the right public\nkey value G**A mod P.  Someone with the power to intercept and change messages\ncan oterwise spoof you by sending both of you *his* public key, and then\nacquiring a session key with each of you....

The classic comment on new encryption algorithms comes from\nFriedman:\n\n	"No new cypher is worth considering unless it comes \n	from someone who has already broken a very hard one."\n\nHistorically, Friedman has been right.  It's really hard to develop\na good cypher.  IBM's Lucifer, the precursor to DES, turns out to have\nbeen fatally flawed.  Most of the DES-like systems other than DES seem\nto be vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis.  The first two tries at\npublic key encryption (remember knapsack cyphers?) were broken.  Most\nif not all of the machine cyphers of the electromechanical era were\nbroken eventually.  Attempts in the computer era to home-brew encryption\nhave been disappointing; the classic "A survey of data insecurity packages"\nin Cryptologia contains analyses and breaking techniques for a few of the\npopular "security packages" of the late 1980s.\n\n        A new, proprietary algorithm?  No way.\n\n        If the US is permitting general export of this thing, it has\nto be weak; that's how the current regulations work.  Currently there's\na willingness to allow systems with short keys (32 bits appears to be\nno problem; the 56 bits of DES are too many) or weak algorithms\n(I think Word Perfect qualifies under that rule) to be exported.\nI can't believe these guys shepherded their technique through the \nPTO and the State Department's Arms Control Division without finding that out.\n\n					John Nagle
I wouldn't think so.  Asking people to trust a secret algorithm seems\nunsound to me.
Now, almost 100 years later, we have the right words for the problem here.\n\nPhone calls are "virtual visits".  Those experienced in virtual reality\nwould know from that title that phone calls need to have all the properties\nof a walk in the park with your friend -- security from casual overhearing\nand easy verification to see if anyone is listening secretively.

The problem is that this will also cause  "a certain amount of interference"\nin *all* systems within the range of the device.  A long time ago I built a\nsmall jammer to dissuade my brother from using his radio alarm clock at \nsomething like 4am, which had just enough range to cover my room and his.\nHowever something powerful enough to mask all (or at least most) emissions from\nyour computer equipment is also going to knock out half your neighbourhoods\nradio and TV reception.  This isn't going to make you many friends.\n\nIncidentally, an older-model TRS80 makes a fine wideband jammer <grin>\n\nPeter.
Nonsense.\n\nMike, in Heinlein's "Moon is a Harsh Mistress" decides that a weapon is some\nmechanism which allows you to deliver energy at a distance.  (I don't\nhave the book handy or I'd find the exact quote).\n\nGuns do that.\n\nCryptosystems do not.

Doesn't\n   take a lot to check to see if that is correct.\n\nDepends on whether the filler is a constant (makes checking easy,\nbut susceptible to replay), or variable (e.g. timer, counter, random),\nwhich makes replay harder and can also make it easier for the\ninquisitors to know if they've missed messages, or gotten them out of\nsequence, or other interesting things that sort of person might care about.\n\nIt is still easy to conceal super-encryption, at least until the\ninquisitors get ahold of the K key, which can take a while,\npresumably not in near-real-time.  (Worst-case, in which the escrow agencies\nprovide the U key to the local cops, still only gets one side of the\nconversation per warrant, unless the same key is used for both directions,\nwhich I suppose the CAPSTONE version of the chip will probably insist on.)
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\n\nMeeting of the UK Cryptoprivacy Association\n- -------------------------------------------\n\nSaturday, 8 May 1993, 1500\n\nTo be held at the offices of:\n\n  FOREST\n  4th floor\n  2 Grosvenor Gardens\n  London  SW1W 0DH\n\nThis is located at the corner of Hobart Place, a couple of\nblocks west of Victoria Station, and almost directly across from\nthe dark green cabbie shelter.\n\nIf you have trouble finding the place, please call the office on\n071-823-6550.  Or, call me (Russell Whitaker) on my pager,\n081-812-2661, and leave an informative message with the\ntelephone number where you can be reached; I will return the\ncall almost immediately.\n\nDiscussion will range from the usual general topics, such as the\nuse of secure public key cryptosystems to protect message data, to\nspecific topics, such as recent moves by the U.S. government\nto restrict choice in data privacy (reference recent discussion\non Usenet groups, e.g. sci.crypt and alt.security.pgp).\n\nAll are invited.  Particularly welcome are members of the\nnewly-formed UK CommUnity group ... the local\nEFF-in-spirit-if-not-in-name folks.\n\nThose who plan to attend should email me and let me know.\nPlease.\n\nAll attendees are requested to bring diskettes - preferably\nMS-DOS - with their PGP 2.+ public keys.  As is usual at these\ngatherings, several of us will bring our laptops, and will sign\npublic keys, subject to the usual caveats (reference the\ndocumentation for PGP 2.2, specifically files PGPDOC1.DOC and\nPGPDOC2.DOC).\n\nIf you do not already have a copy of PGP 2.2 (MS-DOS), and would\nlike to have a copy of this public domain program, please bring\na formatted, medium or high density 3.5 inch floppy PC diskette;\nyou will be provided a copy of the program.\n\nOf course, you might prefer to ftp a version of the program from\none of the various archive sites.  I suggest trying Demon\nInternet Systems, which carries the full range of PGP (Phil\nZimmerman's "Pretty Good Privacy") implementations: directory\n/pub/pgp at gate.demon.co.uk.\n\nMeetings are of indeterminate time.  Those who are interested\nare invited to join the rest of us at a pseudorandomly\ndetermined pub afterwards.\n\nPlease note:\n- ------------\nIn the past few months, interested people have emailed me,\nrequesting FAQs and special information mailings.  I regret\nthat, except in very unusual cases (e.g. working press), I\ncannot, in a timely manner, respond to these requests.  I will,\nhowever - and for the first time - do a writeup of this meeting,\nwhich I will post in various places.\n\nWhat I *am* willing to supply is general information on our\nactivities for the maintainers of existing FAQs, such as that\nfor alt.privacy.

We would like to keep it that way. Thats the point. By reacting\nstrongly and forcefully now, we will assure that we continue to remain\nfree. You cannot overreact to a threat like this. The worst that\nhappens if we overreact is that we waste time and effort. The worst that\nhappens if we underreact is tyranny. I prefer overreaction myself.\n\n\nDoesn't that tell you how precious and hard to maintain freedom is?\n\nOnly through centuries of overreaction have we managed to maintain\nourselves in this state of even moderate freedom. I suggest that\noverreacting now and in the future is a good thing.\n\n--\nPerry Metzger		pmetzger@shearson.com

:               WOULD WIRETAP CHIP BE COST-EFFECTIVE?\n\n:   SUMMARY: Compared to an average monthly phone bill of sixty dollars,\n:   wiretaps are only worth two cents a month to police.  So the\n:   proposed wiretap chip must raise phone costs by less than one part \n:   in three thousand to be cost-effective. \n\nRobin's calculation is interesting and important, even if it's off by\nan order of magnitude (for example).\n\nEven if hardware costs for the Clipper Chip phones were ZERO, the\nprotocol overhead in transmitting the escrow field would be much\nhigher than the 1 part in 3 thousand...it depends on the exact details\nof the phone call length, protocol, etc. (shorter calls get a\nproportionately greater hit).\n\nHowever, I suspect most Americans will not find this line of reasoning\nas persuasive as the analogies about escrowing keys to one's house\nare.\n\n-Tim May

The *security* of the system does depend only on the secrecy of the keys.\n\nThe ability to tap is an inherent *insecurity* which depends fundamentally on\nthe secrecy of the algorithm.  To spell it out, because so many people seem to\nmiss the point, if the algorithm were published, anyone could create a chip\nwhich would work correctly with the Skipjack chips but which would not have\nits key registered.\n\nI believe there is no technical means of ensuring key escrow without the\ngovernment maintaining a secret of some kind.  For example, the secret could be\nthe private keys of the escrow agencies; their digital signatures would be\nrequired before a key could be used.  In this case, the NSA/NIST/whoever has\ndecided that protecting the entire algorithm is easier/cheaper/more secure than\nother possible protocols.
As I've noted, you can likely get around that with a directional\nsensor. Phased array systems could completely defeat this scheme.\n\n--\nPerry Metzger		pmetzger@shearson.com
I did.  You're mistaken.  NSA's communications intelligence mission is\nstrictly against foreign governments.  Here's an excerpt from the enabling\ncharter (24 Oct 52, Truman) that should clarify this.  The charter was\ndeclassified in about Feb 1990 when an FOIA request made it public.  Mind\nyou, I don't know that they never collect anything they're not supposed\nto... but spying on US citizens isn't in their charter.\n\n    b. The COMINT  mission of the National  Security Agency\n	(NSA) shall be to provide an effective,  unified organization\n	and control of the communications  intelligence activities of\n	the United States  conducted against foreign  governments, to\n	provide for  integrated operational  policies and  procedures\n	pertaining thereto.   As  used in  this directive,  the terms\n	"communications intelligence"  or "COMINT" shall be construed\n	to mean all  procedures and methods used in  the interception\n	of communications  other  than foreign  press and  propaganda\n	broadcasts  and  the  obtaining  of   information  from  such\n	communications by other  than intended recipients,  but shall\n	exclude censorship  and the  production and dissemination  of\n	finished intelligence.\n\nThey're also tasked with protecting the US's communications, but I haven't\nseen the specific enabling memo on that.  I assume that's the role under\nwhich Skipjack was developed.\n\nNSA is not in the standard-setting business, though -- that's why this\nClipper stuff came from NIST, which I believe is tasked with coming up\nwith standards based on their best inputs from other government agencies,\nwhich would include NSA.
Thank you Andrew.  Not only for the firm rebuttal, but for understanding the \ndifference between communism and socialism (even though this is off topic).\nWhy do people just not understand that just because all those pretty songs about\nthe land of the free and so on sound nice, that they may not be true?\nTake off those rose colored glasses and get a clue (to use two of the better \ncliches around)\nthanks you again\njamie
That is not true, with chosen plaintext attacks DES keys can be determined\nwithout the full search.\n\n\nI am not willing to take that bet.\n\n\nYou can obviously shove arbitrary data through your chip......\nAs for the key, it is stated that the sesion key exchange is external to\nthe chip, so I can pick my keys too.\n\n\nBING BING BING BING BING, THAT EXACTLY MY POINT, SINCE WE CANT KNOW THAT\nTHEY DO NOT HAVE THIS CAPABILITY, THE ONLY SAFE ASSUMPTION IS THAT THEY\nDO... i admit that most of my cryptographic complaints are probably\nunfounded, but since we cant know one way or the other, im not gonig to\ntake their word for it....\n\n\nOh come on, thats like saying you could evaluate DES without the S-box\nconstants.....
(alt.security.clipper added, to keep them informed of this issue)\n\n\n....\n: The proposal could be modified so that if they get a court order to tap you\n: and don't charge you with a crime within, say, 90 days, they have to buy you\n: a new phone.\n: \n: If they do charge you, and you are found innocent, they have to buy you a\n: new phone.\n: \n: :-)\n\nYes, but will they buy you a ticket on a time machine to allow you to\ngo back and use the phone with the new key instead of the phone whose\nkey they obtained?\n\nIt is unclear whether obtaining the key at time 0 also unlocks\nmessages recorded (by whomever) at earlier times. The announcement was\nsilent on this. The betting seems to be that once your key has been\nobtained (by the authorities, by divorce lawyers, by the Mafia, by the\nFBI, by lost or stolen backup tapes, by the NSA, etc.). all previous\nconversations are unsecure. (Session keys are negotiated, but knowing\nthe private key is believed by many commentators here to break the\nsecurity. No doubt more details will emerge.)\n\nSo, the loss of a key, whether one is guilty or innocent, may mean a lot\nmore than merely replacing the phone.\n\nSort of like saying to someone, "Oh, I copied your diary. But I'll buy\nyou a new one."\n\n\nAnd the system, if made mandatory (as I expect), will make such\nstoring of conversations much easier, I fear. For one thing, the\ntransmission of the escrow key field acts as a clear signal to anyone\nlistening, a kind of "Caller ID" and "Callee ID" on a grand scale.\nAlso, the phone companies may not care as much about protecting the\nprivacy of the calls, as they perceive them all to be useless\nencrypted junk. (This is a bit of a reach, I know, suggesting that the\nClipper will make security more lax...).\n\nAnyway, still lots of issues unresolved.\n\n\n-Tim May

Just a couple of days ago, I heard on the radio news that a Neo-Nazi\norganization had set up a BBS to keep its members informed.  According\nto the radio man, the Nazis were using encryption to reduce their risk\nif they were prosecuted.  No, I do not have any more information.\n\nHave fun.
Not when your talking about cryptography.\n\n\nThink again.  You won't see me using apple's new signature from the\nfinder feature.\n\n\nThis analogy fails in its assumption that the government gives two\nsquirts about credibility.\n\n\nIn addition, Apple's proclaimed purpose in releasing the Macintosh wasn't\nsurvellience.\n\nQuite the opposite:\n"On January 24, Apple will introduce.... Macintosh, and you'll see why\n1984 won't be, like '1984'"\n\nSo don't give me any bullshit analogies about how we trust coke not to\nput mind control drugs in every can to get us to buy more.\n\n\n\nOne of the reasons we should be all the more suspicious.  When was the\nlast time the president wasted his time to comfort americans?\nJust another reason to look closely at exactally what's going on.\n\n\nuni@acs.bu.edu
They also have a lot of the other voters really irritated at them.\n\n\nOkay, folks, I know I'm in the minority on this issue, but I can't\nlet this assertion go unchallenged yet again.  I'm going to say this\nONLY ONCE, in the hopes of NOT starting a flame war off of the main\ntopic.\n\nGuns are offensive.  Cryptography is defensive.  See the difference?\nThe only way you can use a gun is to hurt somebody else.  Crypto-\ngraphy helps prevent other people from hurting you.
Will someone please post the David Sternlight FAQ to alt.privacy.clipper before\nsomeone unfamiliar with him takes him seriously and starts yet another\nflame fest?
May I suggest that any any proposed cipher system\nhaving less entropy than the user's key and message can have\nan embedded subliminal channel as big as the\ndifference in entropies between the entropy of the user\ninput (message) and the entropy of the output?\n\nFor example, take plain DES.  The unsuspecting\nuser inputs a string "PLAINTEXT" to be enciphered.\n\nHe cranks the algorithm which has been hacked\nby George Quisling and comes out with j*3H4902d.\n\nNine char in and nine chars out.  Right?\n\nThe unsepecting user ships the ciphertext\nto be decrpyted and the message "PLAINTEXT"\nis produced.  Everything fine, right?  Nope.\n\n\nImagine the algorithm did a LZ compression\non PLAINTEXT before DESing. (Compressing is\ndown to four characters with more entropy:\n\n9#wj\n\nThe opponent now pads the message with his\nown message, also compressed\n\n*3dk@\n\nbefore applying DES to the concatenated\ncompressed pairs.  When decrpyted, the\nfirst compressed message is stripped off\nand declared sent.  Unbeknowst to the\nreceiver, the opponents accomplice collects\nthe remaining message in the bit bucket and\nuncompresses to KILL NOW.\n\nAnd to prevent all such subliminal or covert\nstorage channels you would need to have \nmaximal entropy all the time -- which is\na priori impossible because (for example)\na stereotypical message might be\nreplaced by one bit in the output reserving\nthe rest of the output bits for the long\ncovert message.\n\nIn other words, if you opponent get to muck\nwith the algorithm -- you either have got to\nmuck with it LAST or concede his possible \nembedding of covert channels.\n\nIn other words, if you present a message\nto an opponet with less than maximal entropy\nthen you have given him free bits of storage.

If it's forbidden to inform someone of a police wiretap on their phone, then\nis it legal to work privtely as a "sweeper," and report to the person you\nwork for whether you found a bug?
: What if clipper is fairly secure but leaves a distinct clipper signature...\n: that is, what if it's not too difficult to tell that a msg. was clipper\n: encrypted, even if you can't tell the contents?  In that case, anyone \n: who is trying to hide behind anther encryption scheme will stand out\n: from all of the other traffic and raise a red flag to the NSA, etc.\n\nI think the obvious answer (which may have been posted, but I haven't\nseen it) is to encrypt your data with some other scheme, then run it\nthrough clipper.  The only way the police will be able to detect the\nother encryption is through a wiretap, so even if they do notice with\nan illegal wiretap, I have a hard time seeing a judge issuing a\nwarrant for a search to "confiscate" the illegal scheme (assuming that\nat one day, it comes to this; a worse case) based on an illegal\nwiretap.

It also goes like this:\n\nFED1: We need to listen into <mafia head/druglord/terrorist/BBS sysop>'s\n      conversations but don't have probable cause for a tap.\n\nFED2: Who do we have a tap on?\n\nFED1: <some other enemy of the state>.\n\nFED2: So get the keys - we can always claim that phone's being used on the\n      tapped line.\n\nThere's got to be some way to associate an instrument with an individual or\nthe state effectively has a tap, possibly not admissible (given the War on\nDrugs exceptions to the 4/5 ammendments, who knows) but none the less\nlistenable tap on any phone.
There is a description of something called a "fair crypto system" in the\nMay 1993 issue of BYTE, p. 134, attributed to MIT professor Silvio Micali.\n\n  The way it works is as follows:\n\n  You generate your private key S, and break it up into pieces s1, s2, s3,\ns4, and s5, such that (s1 + s2 + ... + s5) mod p = S.\n  You give each piece s1, s2, etc. to a different escrow agency.\n  The agencies each compute g^sn mod p, and forward the result to the public\nkey telephone book keeper.\n  The public key telephone book keeper multiplies all the g^sn mod p, reduces\nthe result to mod p, and this will be the user's public key.\n\n  Now, if there were several hundered recognized escrow agencies, and the user\ncould give a piece of the key to each of the ones he trusted, the result would\nbe something of an improvement over the proposed Clipper system.
Hopefully, he doesnt take it personal...

The following program is a very quick hack I created a few months\nago to determine whether a Sun Sparcstation IPC could perform\nreal-time, full-duplex encrypted audio with resulting data rates\nsustainable by today's modems.\n\nThis test program reads linearly-encoded audio from the audio device,\ncompresses it with GSM 06.10 (compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples\nrecorded at 8kHz into 260 bits resulting in a 50 Hz frame rate), encrypts\nit with DES, then reverses the process and sends the reconstructed audio\nback to the audio device.  The compressed, encrypted audio stream\nis 13 kbits/s (!).\n\nMy Sparcstation IPC (not exactly a very fast machine these days,\ncertainly slower than an ELC) would just barely sustain this activity\n(audio underruns would occcur but the speech was very intelligible).  I\nran it as a real-time process to get the best results.

You should realize that form letters are the *worst* way to influence\nyour congresscritters; exact copies are routinely placed on the lowest\nrung of the opinion ladder.\n\nIf you want to write (and I think you should!), take the time to really\n*write* a letter.  Things to emphasize:\n\n	- It's been said that Usenet is available to the 'technical\n	  elite', i.e. the techies at corporate sites and universi-\n	  ties.  Emphasize that you are part of the group that will\n	  be making/developing/using Clinton's 'data superhighway.'\n\n	- Explain how you are intimately familiar with both computing\n	  and data communications. (if this is the case; don't call your-\n	  self an 'expert' after wiring in a 1200 bps modem.)   This\n	  will distinguish your letter from the random flamers.  Don't\n	  turn it into braggadocio; just tell them that you know the\n	  technical sides of the issue.\n\n	- Don't overdo jargon and gobbledygook.  Remember, your letter\n	  will be first read (in all likelihood) by a staffer who may\n	  even be a college student; if they don't understand it, your\n	  views won't even make the 'running total' sheets.\n\n	- Be concise; don't ramble.  Rants are *definitely* out of place.\n	  Cite references, if necessary, but only use "accepted" references\n	  like academic journals.  "My neighbor Jim" is *not* a real refer-\n	  ence.  8)\n\n	- Unfortunately, very few Congresscritters *really* understand\n	  electronic communications.  Encourage them to pick up access\n	  to Compuserve, America Online, or one of the Free-Nets.  Offer\n	  to send them samples.  If you are in a position to do so, offer\n	  them (or their staffers back in the home state) access to your\n	  systems.  Offer to give a demonstration the next time they're in\n	  town.  Your offer to get *personally* involved in helping them\n	  *will* give your opinions more credence.\n\n	- In addition to sending mail to your representatives, send mail\n	  to the members of the committee (or subcommittee) that is dealing\n	  with the issue.  If your Congresscritter isn't on the committee,\n	  they can't be of much help until the matter comes to the floor.\n\n--Wes\n\nps> I'd suggest drawing analogies between digital communication and the\n    more traditional media, but Usenet doesn't have a decent track record\n    in the analogy department.  8)

You are correct (several times). TEMPEST is a codeword for a standard, shared between the NATO governments, to limit the inadvertent emission of information by either electromagnetic radiation or conduction. The limits set in the \nstandard are classified but there is open source information to the effect \nthat either the electrical or magnetic components of electromagnetism can be \nexploited. It is a basic rule of physics that there is an electromagnetic \nfield associated with any path that conducts a flow of electrons.\n\nAmong other things, I drive a 1987 Korean built AT clone and an associated 24 pin dotmatrix printer. The major source of unintentional emission is the CRT. To that can be added the video driver card, the RS232 parallel cable and the \nprinter head. The emissions from these are gross can be detected with the \ncrudest of equipment. Were I to apply good test equipment and some \nintelligence to measuring emission levels, I would find many other potential \nsources of leaked information.\n\nWhere cryptography is used for serious purposes, poor TEMPEST protection \nbecomes an important security hazard.\n\nIn the early eighties, the need to allow some commercial concerns, \nparticularly financial institutions, a level of protection against TEMPEST \nthreat led to a series of briefings to invited corporations and to the \n'release' of a cut-down TEMPEST stansard for commercial use. I say 'release' \nfor while equipment to meet the standard is available (at a price and to \napproved customers) AFAIK even the commercial standard remains classified. If\nyou think about it, it would really have to wouldn't it? \n   \n--

If I give you my Clipper phone, you do not need to\nre-register it (mainly because it was never 'registered' to me in the\nfirst place).\n\nThere are a lot of things that bother me about Clipper, but this is\nnot one of them.

The Attorney General publishes the number of court-ordered taps each year.\nIt isn't enough (around a thousand) for the average non-crook, non-spy to\nworry about. In fact, considering any reasonable guess about the number of\nbig-time crooks and spies around, it may not be enough even for most crooks\nand spies to worry about.\n\nThere's no reason to believe that it will go up with Clipper, since the\nnumber of taps now includes many targets too stupid to use encryption (based\non the playbacks we've heard in court cases).\n\nDavid

This is stupid.  Won't it cost more to those companies hoping to \nserve the gov't and private markets if they DON'T use the same\ntechnology?
I don't think they can do that without changing the law.  The chip itself\nisn't classified, and reverse engineering is allowed by law (possibly)\nunless prohibited by a valid contract.  The algorithm may be classified,\nbut there are many court cases ruling that information identical to\nclassfied information, but obtained from unclassified sources, is freely\npublishable (with the possible exception of nuclear weapon information.)
I am aware of the restrictions imposed by the munitions act\non the export of cryptographic technology, however, is it illegal to\ntransmit encrypted data from the U.S. to another country?  If so,\nthen which laws apply to this situation?
I've been thinking about how difficult it would be to make PGP available\nin some form on EBCDIC machines.  The message authentication would be ugly,\nbut I think at least the IDEA encryption could work, if PGP had a switch\nto tell it to use IDEA in OFB-mode or ECB-mode.  In OFB-mode, errors in\ntranslating EBCDIC-->ASCII-->EBCDIC would only affect their byte, not the\n16 bytes that would be affected under CBC.\n   Is PGP set up to use different IDEA modes?  I don't recall notincing it\nin the executable, but I haven't gone through it as carefully as I probably\nshould....
Qualcomm had spare cycles in the DSPs for their new CDMA digital\ncellular phones. They wanted to put strong crypto into them since they\nhad the capacity. The government decided to "discourage" them.\n\nReally, none of this stuff is especially hard. All you need for a true\nprivate phone is an ISDN codec, a vocoder (either a chip or\nsoftware), an encryptor (a chip is fine, but software is more than\nfast enough), a V.32 or V.32bis modem module, and maybe a\nmicrocontroller to run the whole thing. Its easy to do, its cheap. And\nany "normal" company trying to put one out will likely get a visit\nfrom the boys in the dark suits from Washington, just like Qualcomm\ndid. I suspect that companies like Cylink are tolerated because their\nproducts are too expensive.\n\nHowever, no law yet stops one from building really private phones, in\nspite of the hints the administration has made when discussing the new\n"crime bill" and in connection with the Clipper/Skipjack Big Brother\nchip. Someone out there WILL build a unit to do all this. Better yet,\nprehaps someone will produce a package that turns any 486 box with a\nsound card into a secure phone.\n\n--\nPerry Metzger		pmetzger@shearson.com

If I want to, I CAN go look at Apple's\ncopyrighted ROMs in a Mac, so they're not keeping any secrets.  \nYou don't even have to pry the top off the chip and use an electron microscope,\nyou just have to read the data in memory and see if you can figure out what it means.\n(Motorola object code isn't all *that* obscure!)  \nYes, it's copyrighted, so I can't go selling copies, or using the copy myself,\nbut I CAN see it, and disassemble it.\n\n4) They're not asking me to trust their honesty.  They're asking me to\ntrust the quality of their assembly language programming :-),\nbut I can see for myself what the performance, price, and crashes/day are.\nNSA, an organization not known for its honesty or openness, \nis asking me to trust them with my privacy, but they won't trust me.  Feh!
[some deleted]\n\nOne thing that seems ambiguous is whether a signal being echoed down from\ngeosynchronous orbit is "...from outside the United States."\n\nAlso, being able to assess whether NSA is playing by the rules requires\nknowing what the rules are. We only know a subset. For those even more\nsuspicious, there could be other surveillance organizations "blacker"\nthan the NSA.

Only guessing, but from his address I'd say that Jerry, like\n        me, lives in Canada. Unlike me, he thinks that our friends in\n        the US enjoy the same freedom that we do, and he has not seen\n        the slow but steady erosion to the south of us.\n\n        We have the benefit of relatively slow politicians and\n        ineffective law enforcement. Our rednecks tend to be the\n        objects of derision rather than elected officials. It's\n        everything LE can do to keep up with the real criminals. Any\n        time they actually go after somebody just because they don't\n        like his or her attitude, it's national news (It also often\n        blows up in their faces: eg. the well-intentioned but flawed\n        Zundel case, which resulted in a scolding from the Supreme\n        Court, not only to LE for prosecuting the case but to\n        Parliament for passing the law it was prosecuted under).\n\n        Our friends south of the border don't have as easy a time of\n        it. Among other things they have as many LE agencies as we\n        have agencies, and some of them have teeth. They also have the\n        War on Drugs which gives law-enforcement agencies exceptional\n        powers to ignore individuals' rights (the DEA has more\n        arbitrary power than that given to Canadian agencies under the\n        War Measures Act). We have the RCMP and CSIS who can't stop\n        fighting each other long enough to do any really effective\n        suppression of private citizens' rights. Not only that, our\n        Police Commissions have teeth, as I learned when I had to fend\n        off a bent cop.\n\n        It may be ironic that the nation founded on Life, Liberty and\n        the Pursuit of Happiness is getting government-imposed order,\n        while the nation founded on Peace, Order and Good Government\n        is getting in-your-face liberty.\n\n        That's not to say our time won't come.

It is said that CELP vocoders can run on the highest speed 486s with\nsome room to spare -- they turn 64kbit (8 bit samples, 8k samples/sec)\ninto 4800 baud.

I have heard fairly\nreliable rumors to the effect that a famous internetworking guru has a\nCELP implementation that runs on Sparcstation 1+'s with some room to\nspare, but I have not succeeded thus far in getting my hands on a copy\n-- the guru in question has a reputation for not releasing code\nwithout having beaten on it for a very very long time first. \n\nDSP experts are heavily encouraged to try their own hand at this\nproblem.\n\n--\nPerry Metzger		pmetzger@shearson.com

The paper was distributed (against the wishes of the NSA - I have a copy\nwith a few 'illicit distribution' footnotes scribbled on it :-), and eventually\npublished at one of the crypto conferences.  Things were looking good.\n\nThen Xerox patented the algorithms.  <Plonk!>\n\nI don't know of anything which uses them.  Also, Khafre was broken at a\nlater conference and from work on a related algorithm I don't think the\nexisting Khufu would hold up too well against a converted differential\ncryptanalysis attack, although it can probably be changed to resist this\ntype of attack....\n\nPeter.
Khufu and Khafre are both patented (#5003597).  Biham and Shamir showed\nthat differential cryptanalysis can break 16-round Khafre with a chosen-\nplaintext attack using 1500 different encryptions.  Khafre with 24 rounds\ncan be broken with the same attack using 2^53 different encryptions.\n(There are probably more efficient differential cryptanalytic attacks, if\nsomeone wants to take the time to look.)\n\nKhufu has key-dependent S-boxes, and is immune to differential cryptanalysis.\nSource code for this algorithm (and Khafre) are in the patent.\n\nSnefru is a public-domain one-way hash function.  The version of Snefru\nthat produces a 128-bit hash is vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis\n(vulnerable means that the attack is more efficient that brute force) for\nfour passes or less.  Given that, SHA and MD5 are much more efficient.\n\nOh yes, anyone interested in licensing the patent should contact Dave Petre,\nDirector of Patent Licencing for Xerox, (203) 986-3231.

I don't wish to rehash the PGP patent issue at all, but I do feel\nthat some potential misconceptions in interpretting intellectual property\nlaws need to be raised.\n\n\nYou are correct that executing PGP would be a violation (unless the patent\nwere declared invalid by the courts), but...  there is a question as\nto when, how, or if distributing PGP would be a violation.  If the person\nor company distributing PGP receives money for doing so, then it is\nclearly a sale (for example, if it were on Compuserve, they charge you\nfor access so they would be selling PGP).  When there is no charge for\nPGP things get less clear, but there would still be a reasonable view\nthat it is inducing an infringement.\n\n\nThis is a common misconception.  The patent laws do not mention any valid\npurpose for infringing a patent.  Although it is clear that in order to\ncreate a new invention either based on a prior patent or to avoid infringing\na prior patent, one must perform research on an existing patent.  To\njust say that you infringed a patent (assume we're not talking the RSA\npatent) only for research purposes (wink wink, nudge nudge) and then never\ndevelop any related invention (ie. only use it), would be a clear\ninfringement.

I believe it's legal to send DES code or equipment from the US to Canada\nwith no export license.  I think this is the only place you can do this - all\nother countries require a license.\n\nAs an aside, I've always thought it should be legal to send DES software\nanywhere, if you follow these rules:\n\n   1.  Encrypt your DES software with DES.\n   2.  Send the encrypted software to the recipient.\n   3.  Send the key to the recipient.\n\nThe only way the person on the other end can use your DES software is if\nhe/she already *has* DES available - otherwise, they can't decrypt your\nprogram, and it is useless.  If you've guaranteed they already have DES,\nhave you really violated any law by sending it to them in the form of\nyour program??  I'm sure it's still illegal, but it seems like a good idea...

If you're encrypting data in CBC mode, however, only the\none 64-bit block will be affected.  The next block, and all that follow it\nwill be decrypted properly.\n\nIt's a good idea to have some kind of error correction in your system if\ncorrupted bits are likely.\n\n   - Todd\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom: pausch@saaf.se (Paul Schlyter)\n\n\nAt least 8 bytes of data will be destroyed if one bit encrypted data is\nin error.\n\nIf you use CBC (Cihper Block Chaining), then the remainder of the data\nwill be destroyed as well.\n\nDES is VERY seisitive for single bit errors.

With other modes, once one block is bad,\nall later blocks will be bad too.\n\nThere's also the framing problem.  If you have a bit change,\nthe block that it's in changes, and maybe later blocks also change.\nBut if you have bits lost or bits added (64 bits in, 63 or 65 bits out),\neverything is confused after that.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom: Marcus J Ranum <mjr@TIS.COM>\n\n	depends on the mode you're using. cfb, for example, synchronises\npretty fast. figure a bit error will destroy the current block and the\nnext one.\n\nmjr.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n---\nExperience is what you get if you don't get what you want...
OK, I heard a lot of talk about the NSA's infamous control over encryption\n   export through the ITAR.  Here's a question.  Say I develop this great new\n   encryption system, and I want to sell my software worldwide.  The thought\n   police then come in and say "This algorithm is a threat to national security.\n   You will not be permitted to export it."  At this point, what kind of trouble\n   could I get into if I ignored the ITAR and sold my program to international\n   customers anyway?\n\nFirst of all, it's not the thought police, it's the export police.\nIf you move overseas with your great thoughts in your head, write the software there,\nand then sell it, the US Thought Police probably can't do too much about it,\nthough you might want to check with your lawyer first.\n\nHowever, if you write the program here, and sell it to furriners,\nyou are now an international arms dealer and can get thrown in the\nclink for *many* years, especially if they decide you'd be a good example,\nand Cuban Drug Dealers and Fanatic Middle Eastern Terrorists buy your stuff.\n\n(Definitions of "public domain" are different for ITAR purposes, so if\nyou've got a good enough lawyer who'll do your case for free after\nthey've confiscated everything you own as evidence, you might win.\nBut nobody wants to go first, since the stakes are _quite_ high.)
That's one way to put it.  Keeping the algorithm classified means that \ndisclosure of it falls under the rubric of "national security."  Nothing like \nfederal marshalls to guard a monopoly...\n\n\nAgreed, although this is still somewhat better than the status quo :).\n\n\nSounds like a job for the Free Software Foundation :)/2...

Well, they can't listen in on much of mine, since I already use\ncryptography for much of my electronic mail, and will start using it\nfor my telephony as soon as practical.\n\nHowever, allow me to tell a parable.\n\nThere was once a far away land called Ruritania, and in Ruritania\nthere was a strange phenonmenon -- all the trees that grew in\nRuritainia were transparent. Now, in the days when people had lived in\nmud huts, this had not been a problem, but now high-tech wood\ntechnology had been developed, and in the new age of wood, everyone in\nRuritania found that their homes were all 100% see through. Now, until\nthis point, no one ever thought of allowing the police to spy on\nsomeone's home, but the new technology made this tempting. This being\na civilized country, however, warrants were required to use binoculars\nand watch someone in their home. The police, taking advantage of this,\nwould get warrants to use binoculars and peer in to see what was going\non. Occassionally, they would use binoculars without a warrant, but\neveryone pretended that this didn't happen.\n\nOne day, a smart man invented paint -- and if you painted your house,\nsuddenly the police couldn't watch all your actions at will. Things\nwould go back to the way they were in the old age -- completely\nprivate.\n\nIndignant, the state decided to try to require that all homes have\nvideo cameras installed in every nook and cranny. "After all", they\nsaid, "with this new development crime could run rampant. Installing\nvideo cameras doesn't mean that the police get any new capability --\nthey are just keeping the old one."\n\nA wise man pointed out that citizens were not obligated to make the\nlives of the police easy, that the police had survived all through the\nmud hut age without being able to watch the citizens at will, and that\nRuritania was a civilized country where not everything that was\nexpedient was permitted. For instance, in a neighboring country, it\nhad been discovered that torture was an extremely effective way to\nsolve crimes. Ruritania had banned this practice in spite of its\nexpedience. Indeed, "why have warrants at all", he asked, "if we are\ninterested only in expedience?"\n\nA famous paint technologist, Dorothy Quisling, intervened however. She\nnoted that people might take photographs of children masturbating\nshould the new paint technology be widely deployed without safeguards,\nand the law was passed.\n\nSoon it was discovered that some citizens would cover their mouths\nwhile speaking to each other, thus preventing the police from reading\ntheir lips through the video cameras. This had to be prevented, the\npolice said. After all, it was preventing them from conducting their\nlawful surveilance. The wise man pointed out that the police had never\nbefore been allowed to listen in on people's homes, but Dorothy\nQuisling pointed out that people might use this new invention of\ncovering their mouths with veils to discuss the kidnapping and\nmutilation of children. No one in the legislature wanted to be accused\nof being in favor of mutilating children, but then again, no one\nwanted to interfere in people's rights to wear what they liked, so a\ncompromise was reached whereby all homes were installed with\nmicrophones in each room to accompany the video cameras. The wise man\nlamented few if any child mutilations had ever been solved by the old\nlip reading technology, but it was too late -- the microphones were\ninstalled everwhere.\n\nHowever, it was discovered that this was insufficient to prevent\ncitizens from hiding information from the authorities, because some of\nthem would cleverly speak in languages that the police could not\nunderstand. A new law was proposed to force all citizens to speak at\nall times only in Ruritanian, and, for good measure, to require that\nthey speak clearly and distinctly near the microphones. "After all",\nDorothy Quisling pointed out, "they might be using the opportunity to\nspeak in private to mask terrorist activities!"  Terrorism struck\nterror into everyone's hearts, and they rejoiced at the brulliance of\nthis new law.\n\nMeanwhile, the wise man talked one evening to his friends on how all\nof this was making a sham of the constitution of Ruritania, of which\nall Ruritanians were proud. "Why", he asked, "are we obligated to\nsacrifice all our freedom and privacy to make the lives of the police\neasier? There isn't any real evidence that this makes any big dent in\ncrime anyway! All it does is make our privacy forfeit to the state!"\n\nHowever, the wise man made the mistake of saying this, as the law\nrequired, in Ruritanian, clearly and distinctly, and near a\nmicrophone.  Soon, the newly formed Ruritanian Secret Police arrived\nand took him off, and got him to confess by torturing him. Torture\nwas, after all, far more efficient than the old methods, and had been\nrecently instituted to stop the recent wave of people thinking obscene\nthoughts about tomatoes, which Dorothy Quisling noted was one of the\nmajor problems of the new age of plenty and joy.\n\n--\nPerry Metzger		pmetzger@shearson.com
The NSA's charter forbids them from doing any purely domestic\nintelligence work, I would think that even providing assistance in\ndevelopment of the Skipjack algorithom is a violation of that charter. \nBut as with any intrenched government agency, they will do what they\nthink is expedent.

My original post was:\n\n\nThis article will just scratch the surface of a few security\nconsiderations, comments are requested. (email: fw@world.std.com)\nMy thanks to the people who responded, both on usenet and from\nOracle Corp.\n\nThe most common response was to suggest use of oracle audit \nfeatures or OPS$ passwords to control access (opinion on OPS$\nincluded suggestions to use and not use). I was also advised to \nuse table views to refine the granularity of access control.\n\nOne important security consideration in networked installations\nis that OPS$ accounts presume that the client host provides user\nauthentication. Os/2 server OPS$ users are only as secure as the \n_least_ secure machine on the network. Hence you should probably \nnot define any OPS$ accounts on systems with PC's, or limit access \nof OPS$ accounts to data with no security concerns. Unix oracle \nservers provide for disabling OPS$ access over the network (orasrv\noption), while relying on host security for local processes. \n\nInternally Oracle provides powerful and well documented (sic) \naudit mechanisms which the DBA will use to monitor system and\ndata access. These tools can be used to track the primary security\nrisks from within the Oracle environment.\n\nOracle password security is based on a proprietary usage of DES\nencryption. Oracle Corp. states that the algorithm is not prone\nto cleartext attack. This is a difficult claim to substantiate \nsince the algorithm is unknown. The concern here is that if users \nchoose easily guessed passwords. _If_ a cracker can gain access \nto your oracle database files through the host operating system, \ns/he could extract the 'cyphertext' password data and apply \ncryptanalysis techniques to learn the users passwords.\n\nAs security risks go, the above scenario is pretty low severity.\nCertainly once an intruder has access to the raw database files,\ns/he can access to the data in them. If a cracker _could_ break \nthe passwords, however, s/he could do substantial damage without\nalerting the auditing mechanism's, and leaving and audit trail\nwhich would point to valid users. At present Oracle (like Unix)\nprovides no native means of ensuring that passwords are not \nguessable. \n\nAs with all computer security, the most important defense is to \neducate users in the safe choice of passwords. These techniques\nare well discussed in internet rfc#1281 and the Crack manual, \n(both available from ftp archive servers) and, UNIX(R) System \nSecurity (Curry, David A. - Addison-Welsey 1992)
So, who is Mykotronx, Inc.?  It would be nice to know that they were\nnot a front company used by an intelligence or other agency of the \nU.S. government.  Trusting the fox to guard the chickens, and all that.\nSeems suspicious when the rest of the sources are foxes.\n\nWhile we are at it, the chip design(s) should be examined and verified\nagainst silicon to insure no trap doors or hidden protocols exist in silicon,\nregardless of the security level of the encryption algorithm.  It would be a \nshame if some three letter agency had the ability to interrogate my chip, when\nall I'd know is that someone rang, and when I attempted to go off hook the\nline went dead.  Could be even worse if the chip were intended to connect\ndirectly to a modem.\n\nThe design examination should be done to the gate level.  Does anyone have\na good idea how to tell if there is a piggyback design on silicon?  The model\nwould be extra logic sharing pins with the advertised function.  Tip offs\nwould be circuitry that would ignore incoming data if formats or sequence\nis not right.  I can think of only two ways an output pin could be used,\nand its possible that might be noticed, but could be edited from the netlist.\nI think the silicon itself needs to be investigated.  Imagine a design\ndone in two layer metalization, yet finding a third layer under the\nmicroscope.
How fast do the fastest modems go?\n\nV.FAST is targeted for about 28kbps; 14.4kbps is ~$500, and 19.2 may\nbe here soon too.  (Remember to ignore compression figures which make\nyour modem go faster on compressible data, because voice gets\ncompressed better than that, and encryption makes further compression impossible.)\n\n   How far can voice be compressed?\n\nThe STU-III phones on the market from AT&T, Motorola, and (I forget who else),\ngive you a choice of 9600, 4800, and 2400 baud.  The 9600 and 4800 are CELP,\nand I think the 2400 is some earlier military vocoder stuff.\n9600 is decent, 2400 is pretty artificial, anything less is Speak&Spell.\n16000 can produce quite adequate sound.  There's also some 8 kbps CELP around.\nDSPs have made it possible to do all this in real time for cheap.\n\nOld-hand government crypto have trouble adjusting to systems faster\nthan 9600 baud, because if the voice on the other end sounds good,\nyou assume the crypto hasn't been turned on yet :-)
I was annoyed to find that this guy posted my private e-mail response to\nhim, but since I believe what I said, I'll defend it anyway.\n\n\n\nBy "almost" I mean the differential cryptanalysis attack.  The chosen\nplaintext attack requires a detailed analysis of about 2^36 chosen plaintexts\ndrawn from a total of about 2^47 that need to be run, if I understand the\nsituation correctly.  This is certainly a "break" under the meaning of the\nAct, but does not constitute much less work than the brute force keysearch.\n\nThe rest of his article assumes that we can figure out the Skipjack\nencryption algorithm E by choosing the correct data to send through it and\nobserve the results.  I wish him joy of it, and choose not to try that attack.\n\nI am not defending the system, and in fact am offended by the ideas of\nescrowed keys or a secret algorithm becoming a de facto industry standard.\nHowever, I also object to opposing it for the wrong reasons, since that\nweakens the case against it.\n\nI said (in my private e-mail):\n\nNo, it's quite different.  The government would have no percentage in\nchoosing F to be a weak key, since it's not to their advantage to have\nanybody else know it.  The "experts" could thus assume that F is no worse\nthan anything else during their analysis.  Totally different situation\nfrom unknown S-boxes.  Again, I'm not saying it would be good or\nsatisfactory for the experts to just be given the raw algorithm without\nthe rest of the surrounding details regarding the chip and protocols and\nso on -- simply that I doubt that they <would> be given all the\ninformation.
I suspect the government feels it is enough to prevent companies from\noffering secure encryption services.  Big companies don't take that\nkind of risk.  They're too visible and have too much to lose.\n\nThe US government may not have to make encryption illegal to prevent its\nuse.  If they could credibly say to IBM or MIT: you will receive no US\ngovernment money next year unless you follow these voluntary guidelines on\nuse of encryption, I doubt either organization would delay making use of\nencryption a violation of local policies.  The US government gets much of\nits power by making it impractical to operate without getting money from the\ngovernment while putting restrictions on use of such money that would be\nillegal if they were enacted as laws.
. . . . .\n\n\nPlease don't be insulted, but based on this I would say that your\nencryption algorithm is very likely not worth the paper it's printed\non.  If the NSA gave export approval, that means they felt confident\nthat they could crack it -- that's their JOB, mandated by LAW, and\nI'm sure they believe in what they do.  If they gave export approval\nto an encryption algorithm which they weren't confident of being able\nto crack, they would be derelict in their sworn duty to monitor foreign\ncommunications for US national security related material.\n\nJust because many (most?) of us think that the government and the spooks\nare pugnacious slimeballs is no reason to lose sight of the fact that\nthey do their jobs to the best of their ability, and further that said\nability is rather high.  I hope that one day we can make them all\nobsolete....... but until then, we have to cope with their existence.\nExport approvals are one thing they do that we can learn a lot from,\nfor example.
I recently saw a message here (posted by Bob Silverman, I think) which \nreferred to a "birthday" attack on a cryptosystem. I'm looking for \nreferences on, and explanations of, this type of attack.
It has also apparently been excised from the second edition.
I do not think they can use the eavesdropping as evidence at all. However,\nusing the info they gather while listening, they can go searching THE right\nplace and find good, strong evidence, which they can use in court. \n\nQuestion : currently, it is easy to wire-tap, from the technical point of\nview, at least. Anybody using the appropriate radio receiver can listen\nto communications between a car-telephone and the ground station. The police\nalso, obviously. The clipper chip will make it much more difficult for the\nnon-authorized person to eavesdrop (note that I DO NOT write << impossible>> ).\nThe privacy will thus improve from the current situation. Poeple who REALLY\nhave something to hide already DO NOT use the phone to speak of these things.\nIf an illegal operation is really worth, one can afford having critical data\ncarried by a person rather than sending it electronically. \nThe clipper chip will not change this. \n\nThe problem is more politic. Foreign countries will never accept the clipper\nchip is the access to the escrow cannot be directly granted to their own\npolice following their OWN law, not the US law. i.e. each country will have\nits own escrow. How then will it be possible to monitor the international\ntraffic? or, will encrypted international traffic be possible ? or will there\nbe an international escrow, some kind of U.N. thing ?\n\nForbidding crypted communication is impractical: how is it possible to spot\na crypted communication in the thousands of megabytes of data which circulate\non the various existing networks. What about private networks ? And this will\nbe more and more impossible as the volume of electronic traffic will increrase\nin the next years.\n\nI think that the clipper chip can only be an interesting device to limit the\nrisk of , for instance, one's girlfriend's husband listening to his wife's\ncommunications. It will bring no more as regards to security. Is it worth ?\nI think so if its cost is limited, I think that many privacy invasions are done\nnot only by official services, but also by private entities. The clipper can\nhelp reducing these. Provided we do not hope too much of it, it is not a real\ndanger and it can be helpful.

OK, Andrew, I'll provide some evidence. A friend of mine worked for an\nelectronics manufacturer on with a west-coast office. They routinely sold\nequipment to the Japanese. One day, the Japanese started showing up with\ndiscount demands that were amazingly close to the cost to manufacture the\nproducts.\n\nThis company routinely sent most of the manufacturing data to the field \noffices. The Japanese had simply intercepted it. So my friend, the computer\nsystems admin, came up with a solution. He started sending the data out\ndouble-block-encrypted with DES. \n\nTwo days after this new distribution plan was implemented, the president of\nthe company got a visit from a pair of government agents. They told him to\n"knock it off". The president gave in, since his company did a considerable\nbusiness with the federal government.\n\nNow, if the government wasn't monitoring the communications, how would they\neven know that the encryption system was installed? Further, since encryp-\ntion isn't illegal, and DES certainly isn't, what is the basis of the\ngovernment's cease-and-desist demand?\n\nThe spooks do whatever they think is necessary, with or without the blessings\nof the law. I'll say "no thanks" to Clipper, or anything else the government\nproduces. For the moment, double or triple DES is probably adequate. And when\nthe line is idle, send random garbage, just to keep 'em busy.
Have the feds shut down the people making Sound Blaster? What\nabout Apple and NeXT? Apple, NeXT, Sun, and others make systems that\ncan handle CD-quality audio in and out, and can perform arbitrary\ntransformation on it in the process of transmitting it across a network\nor modem.\n\n	Perhaps there's a market for a portable vocoder. Not a crypto\ndevice, simply an RS232<->voice converter. Make it capable of recording\nspeech and playing it back simultaneously. It has applications for\nmultimedia, computing for the handicapped, Internet Talk Radio, IRC,\netc, etc, etc.  It wouldn't be a cryptographic device at all - but I\nsuppose someone could have it hooked to a 486 laptop with a V.32bis\nmodem and some crypto software. I'd market the thing with an API for\ntext-to-speech using simple phonemes and the ability to use speech\nsamples. And, of course, I'd publish the interface to it so other\nfolks could write any applications they wanted to talk to the thing.
Big deal. If you are a legitimate law enforcement agent and have a\nlegitimate wiretap order, you just listen in on the line for 10\nminutes, get the serial number, and then take the order and go to the\nescrow agencies. If you notice the criminal is now using a different\nphone instrument, take your still-valid wiretap order to the escrow\nagency with the new serial number. (This provides opportunities for\nabuse by law enforcement, but thats not what we are discussing right\nnow.) I oppose Clipper, but the mechanics here are simple and easy to\nunderstand. The whole rest of your article is based on a large series\nof false premises, all predicated on the notion that this simple act\nis somehow impossible.\n\nI feel free to presume to tell you that you do not seem to understand\nthe mechanics of the proposal.

Wouldn't this method be vulnerable against a "birthday" attack?\nCurrently a cracker needs to find the _only_ (*1) key that produces\nthe given ciphertext.  He has to try about 2^63 keys on the average.\nIn the proposed method the cracker only needs _any pair_ of key halves.\nIf he can store about 2^32 guesses for one half, he is likely to find\na mathching pair in about 2^32 guesses.  (Here I have assumed that the\nDES-encryption is reversable, if the key is guessed.  Is this so or do\nthe modifications of the S-boxes by the salt bits make it non-reversable?)

That wasn't my point. My point is that your implied position about the "Waco\nMassacre" is an assertion cum political position. According to a CNN poll,\nabout 86% of Americans think the FBI acted properly, and a majority think\nthey should have done it (the tear gas) a lot sooner. A large majority also\nbelieve the FBI was not at all responsible for the death of the victims,\nKoresh was. (Let's avoid the kind of fruitless argument of the sort If A\nhadn't X'd, then B might not have Y'd....)\n\nWhat you call the "Big Brother Chip" is right now a proposal under\ndiscussion, and it is not yet clear that strong crypto is going to be\nbanned.\n\nTherefore neither justifies "any tactic is fair." Thus the statement is\nnonsense. It is pernicious, because "any tactic" can lead to damaging\nothers.\n\nAs I see you know from the tone of your reply, there's nothing personal\nintended.\n\nDavid
Do not presume to tell me what I have and have not read.  The system may\nnot rely upon registering people as owning particular phone units, but\nit is necessary to know which phone units are likely to be used for some\nsuspected criminal communication before you can obtain their unit keys\nfrom escrow.  This necessity raises the stakes in favor of a criminal's\ncoercing or colluding use of some other person's Clipper phone.\n\nI will restate my assumptions more explicitly and amplify my argument.\nThe original title perhaps should have been "Distinction between legal\nand illegal cipher systems considered harmful", but "Clipper considered\nharmful" is not inaccurate, and is more eye-catching in the current context.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n  1.  Clipper is made available.\n\n  2.  Laws are passed to make use of cipher systems other than Clipper illegal\n      (either on radio systems, or on any common carrier system).  These laws\n      also include enforcement authority to listen across the relevant radio\n      spectrum (or other medium), characterize signals, validate Clipper\n      wrappers, detect probable use of non-Clipper ciphers, and make such\n      detection a cause for further action.\n\n  3.  For escrowed keys to be useful, some specific Clipper chip must be\n      associated with a suspected criminal.  This means that at a minimum\n      some association between the common carrier's unique phone ID (ESN) and\n      the Clipper chip serial number N will be stored in a government database.\n      An observed pairing of N and ESN other than the one recorded raises a\n      red flag.\n\n  4.  To reduce ordinary fraud, the cellphone system which offers Clipper\n      will also be constructed with an ESN mechanism much more tamper-proof\n      and much less spoofable than today's cellphones.\n\n  5.  Criminals want inscrutable communications.  Some criminals are not\n      entirely stupid or ignorant, and will figure out both that Clipper\n      cellphones offer excellent security in normal circumstances, and that\n      they offer no security against law enforcement once a (presumably\n      legitimate) wiretap order exists.  They will also figure out that the\n      wiretap order must necessarily be against a specific cellphone, because\n      each one has a unique unit key.\n\n  6.  Criminals do not want to call attention to themselves.  Because they\n      are not stupid or ignorant (or because they read netnews), and because\n      they know that their open use of a non-Clipper cipher is likely to be\n      detected, they will generally avoid using non-Clipper ciphers directly\n      on some monitorable/tappable channel.  They know that do so would raise\n      a red flag, putting a given cellphone (if not a given person) under\n      immediate suspicion.\n\n  7.  It is impractical to reverse engineer Skipjack, discover family key F,\n      and construct a functional clone of a Clipper chip.\n\nBy #2, #3, #4, and #7 it will be very difficult to spoof a given Clipper\nphone without immediate detection.  Because it is difficult to obscure one's\nassociation to a specific phone by reprogramming or changing chips\naround, the criminal will be motivated to find an intact phone which is\nassociated with someone else.\n\nA non-stupid criminal will conclude that they can have Clipper-secure\ncommunications, at least for some limited time T, if they buy, beg, borrow,\nor steal use of someone's phone in a way that prevents that person from\nreporting compromise of the phone for at least time T.  The encrypted\ncommunications might have been recorded, and thus be retrievable later,\nbut the criminal can delay, and quite likely evade, discovery by destroying\nor abandoning the phone before T elapses.\n\nIt would be unusual for an innocent person to volunteer use of their Clipper\nphone to someone else.  The honest subscriber doesn't want to pay someone\nelse's bill, and he doesn't want to fall under suspicion.\n\nThis leaves two sources of Clipper phones for criminal use: coercion\nand collusion.\n\nCoercion first.  Theft bears a relatively low risk, but also sometimes\na low time until detection (a few minutes if a phone is stolen from\na car parked in front of a store, a couple of weeks if a phone is stolen\nfrom someone who is away on vacation).  Criminal commerce is likely to\narise in stolen Clipper phones, with phones coming from risk-inured poor\ncriminals, and cash coming from risk-averse wealthy criminals.  Someone\nwho is extraordinarily motivated to gain a day or two of undetected\ncommunication (like a terrorist) could kill a person or hold them hostage.\nThe limited time (before detection) that a coerced phone is useful means\nthat continuing criminal enterprises require a continuing supply of\nfreshly coerced phones.\n\nThere would also be created a collusive commerce between relatively\nwealthy criminals, and ignorant or don't-care patsies who need money,\nand who will submit to being paid in return for subscribing to Clipper\nphone service for someone else's use.\n\nCriminals will learn that it is more to their advantage to coerce use of a\nClipper cellphone than it is to apply a non-Clipper cipher to a normal\ncellphone.  They will call much less attention to themselves (or at least to\ntheir stolen phone) this way.  The fact of a phone's use being coerced must\nfirst be reported before it can be identified as an interesting phone, and\nhave its keys obtained from escrow.\n\nClipper also allows an extraordinary opportunity for the criminal to\nconceal use of super-encryption.  An automated full-system surveillance\nmechanism (quite feasible across radio bandwidth) which knows family key F,\ncan validate Clipper wrappers and N:ESN associations, but it cannot reveal\nin realtime the use of super-encryption, unless it knows all unit keys,\nwhich we are being assured are only to be made available in two separate\npieces, upon specific wiretap-like order.\n\nWhereas a criminal's use of any cipher within a normally cleartext medium\nwould stand out, a criminal's use of a non-Clipper cipher within a Clipper\nmedium would be very difficult to detect, even ex post facto in bulk\nrecordings, as long as the association between criminal and specific Clipper\nchip is fractured.\n\nIf you make use of this other cipher illegal per se, then you can charge\nthe criminal with this (if you can identify the true criminal - he'll be\nusing someone else's phone), but you'll have no evidence to help you against\nwhatever traditional crime he might have been planning.  You will not even be\nable to detect that unusual (encrypted) communications are occurring until you\nidentify specific phones and obtain their keys from escrow.\n\nThe gangster and terrorist are thus arguably more, not less, secure than\nthey were before Clipper came along.\n\nI therefore consider Clipper harmful because:\n\n  1.  It does not provide absolute privacy to the honest public against\n      aggressive or dishonest government.\n\n  2.  If other ciphers are proscribed, it engenders new types of direct\n      criminal threat to the honest public.\n\n  3.  It provides an extraordinarily effective mechanism for criminals to\n      hide their use of some other cipher, making it more difficult than\n      ever even to gain notice that unusual communications are occurring\n      and that plans for some criminal act might be in progress.\n\n  4.  If other ciphers are proscribed, lazy investigators and prosecutors\n      are more likely to pursue the easily quantifiable cipher-use crime\n      than they are the traditional and directly harmful crimes which key\n      escrow is claimed to help against.\n\n  5.  If other ciphers are proscribed, the stage is set for witch hunting\n      of "illegal" cipher use.  Because any computer can be used as a cipher\n      machine...

Do you think I will ever live in a soceity that seeks to meddle\n<in the affairs of its' citizenry without recourse of any kind?  I'm tired\n<of it.

Hell, most haven't even heard of Clipper, and\nwhen they do, it will be in soothing language telling everyone how\nnice the government is at 'letting them have' privacy.\n\nHow come the media is not telling about the provisions of the Clipper\ndecision?  The provisions of the Crime Bill?  The abuses of Civil Forfeiture?\nThe government uses polls to support 75 percent of the people want\ngun bans, etc., yet the same pollsters have determined (according to\nthe media) that 30 percent of the people are unaware of what the Holocaust\nis...\n\nThe people cannot be expected to give decent decisions when they are\ndenied the information that all these abuses and whittling away of\nrights are going on quietly.  When they find out (when it hits them),\nit will be too late.  One cannot expect each citizen to spend all their\ntime probing, searching, researching, etc.   For example, how big a\npercentage of the average population even has access to USENET?  Way\nless than 1 percent, I bet.   How many outside of Internet/USENET\nare even AWARE of what Big Brother is doing, or have been exposed to\narguments of both sides of the issue?\n\nWhat the public will get is only ONE side:  The Government's side.\n\nTHAT is scary.\n\n<\n<This saddens and frightens me.\n<\n<I am a conserveative believe it or not.

Some of the messages here seem to reflect the view that the government is\nlistening in on everything and one will have to hide one's clipper messages\nsomehow if non-escrowed crypto goes away.\n\nA little perspective might be in order.\n\nThe number of court ordered wire taps is pretty low. Law enforcement has to\npresent pretty good evidence to get even that limited number of\nauthorizations.\n\nThus the overwhelming majority of conversations are neither tapped nor\nrecorded by the government, and for that to happen they have to:\na) Have a pretty good reason, with evidence;\nb) Use this sparingly on highest priority "pretty good reasons."\n\nThough the system may be imperfect, it is a long way from the horror stories\nsome here seem to believe or anticipate.
Because much of the public aren't even aware of the NAMES of informative\npublications.  Look at the 'wealth' of material on the typical newsstand.\nUnless the person is working in some kind of technical environment, with\nthe usual trade journals, all they ever see is the media (note: media\nin this context is the popular media - TV, radio, daily newspapers, and\nsuch publications as Time, Newsweek, and all that).  And they all say\npretty much the same thing.  I see most of them being in the range of\ncenter-left to far Left, and generally supportive of pie-in-sky\nwe-will-take- care-of-you-think-for-you-cradle-to-grave.  There seems\nto be an air of arrogance that the individual is not capable of\nunderstanding major issues so the media doesn't bother to inform them\n(as with Clipper, for example) or tells the people how to interpret\nevents in others.  What is lost sight of is that the people are not good\nat understanding things because they are not TOLD accurate information\nabout them.  It is a lot to expect of the people for them to be\nclarirvoyant.  For example, I would have been unaware of Clipper had\nI not picked it up on USENET.  How much of the population has USENET,\nlet alone Internet access?\n\nFor access to better publications, the person has to spend time digging.\nMany folks, especially who work long hours, have families, etc., do not\nhave TIME to go digging, and many are not (yet) aware things are wrong,\nso are not motivated to dig.  Not saying its right, just saying that is\nthe way things are.  People aren't upset about things when they aren't\nTOLD.  And the less than objective media is a major contributer to the\nproblem.\n\nAnd then compound that with an attitude of arrogance in the civil service\n(bureaucrats, politicians) that act as if the person without political\nconnections, or deep pockets (potential contributer) should have few if\nany rights, being a resource to be used by those in control for their\npolticial or financial gain.  Some Law Enforcement agencies act as if\nthey regard the common person with a rather intense degree of contempt,\npeons that are supposed to do what they are TOLD, and get very nasty\nwhen someone questions them.  The media pundits/editors, etc tend to\nfall into those with privilege, and tend to not be upset by the current\nstate of affairs.  The fellow in DC, who shot the swimmer in his Jacuzzi\nfor daring to swim in it, with an ILLEGALLY owned gun (violating the law\nhe pushed to be foisted on everyone else), ends up walking where a less\nwell-connected person would have been crucified.  A typical example of\none standard for 'us', a much more restrictive standard for 'other folk'.\n\nPerhaps I am not real eloquent in expressing this, but the solution\nsure as hell is NOT to make it HARDER for people to find out what is\ngoing on, or dismiss their concerns because one happens to be in a position\nwhere one feels they are exempt or insulated.  Such as that hypocrite of\na journalist in DC described above.  One notices that these less-than\ncomplimentary points about that double-standard was NOT covered in the\nmedia.  I feel the reason was it dovetailed with their political views\non the subject, and it involved a 'brother' journalist.\n\nIsn't it time for our 'objective' media, the MAIN SOURCE of info for the\naverage person, to start being what they claim to be, instead of spin\ndoctors for the Statist elements?

In order to have formulate a rational position on what cryptography\npolicies are acceptable, we must set forth a list of basic requirements.\nI would propose the following as a starting point:\n\n  1. The algorithm must be publicly known, and must have a record of\n       surviving attempts by outside experts to find weaknesses.\n\n  2. The system implementation must make it possible to verify that the\n       advertised algorithm is, in fact, the one that is being used.\n\n  3. The key must be quickly changeable by the user, and must be of a\n       sufficient length and complexity to defeat any brute-force search\n       possible now or in the reasonably near future.

Motorola certainly makes them, but I don't know how you\nwould go about buying one.  You'd probably have to buy one\nof our secure radios.  \n\nYou could also bring in encryption chips from outside the country.

You are correct, it is illegal to send cryptographic\ncode (and lots of other things) out of the country without a license.\nHOWEVER, every US citizen has a general export license, allowing\nexport of lots of things, including constitutionally protected speech.\nThis has the effect that it is legal for US citizens to export some\nthings which it is illegal for a US corporation to export without\nfirst obtaining a license.\n\n   > Dunno if you'd get one for the particular code you have; the only\n   > way to find out is to apply for a license.\n\n   Nope, talk to a good lawyer in the area of export law.  But, in\ngeneral, the government has to have a very good national security case\nto try prevent the export of anything you personally might wish to\npublish.  (Yes, I worded that the way I did intentionally.  It is a\nlot easier for the government to TRY to prevent the export of\ninformation than to charge someone with a crime after the fact.\nEspionage is probably the only exception.)\n\n   > Note that you need to distinguish between what is legal to send\n   > to Canada if YOU have such a license, and what is legal to send\n   > if you don't.\n\n    If you are a US citizen, you have a general license.  (I am not a\nlawyer, so take some of this with a grain of salt.  However, I have\nalso had to swim through both ITAR and export regs in a few cases.)\n\n--\n\n					Robert I. Eachus
Hmmmmmm.  $30 seems a bit expensive.  How big is the chip?  What kind\nof packages will be used?  3 volt or 5 volt technology?  How much\ncurrent will it draw?  I think there are many practical questions\nthat haven't been answered, especially since this chip already exists!\n\n\nOK, I've got a big problem with all of this.  How in the world do you\nexpect to sell these chips for even $30 after all the overhead involved\nin this programming procedure?  2-4 people, a laptop, only 300 chips at \na time:  give me a break.  And how long does all of this take?  Even if\nit is a minute per chip, it will take the greater part of a day to \nturn out 300 of these things.  How long do you suppose it will take to\nprogram those 10,000 chips mentioned above?  This is highly impractical!\n\n\nSo where can I find info on this AT&T device?  What kind of vocoder\ndoes it use?  Does it require ISDN phone lines?  If not, is it full\nduplex?  How does it sound?  What kind of synchronization scheme is\nused?  Will all other little black boxes have to conform to AT&Ts choices\nof protocol, etc.?  Will anybody else be allowed to build boxes that\nconform to these specifications?

Two safeguards:\n\n1. The FBI could be asked to produce the law enforcement block to the escrow\nagencies, and associate it with a particular court order;\n\n2.

If the government chooses to go\nahead and sell those cryptosystems to the masses, so be it.\n\n	This sounds a lot like slamming the competition, not a cry\nfor justice. These guys are way out on a limb, if I read that right.\nThey've commited their new algorithm to silicon before it's been\nmade public. What are they gonna do if Shamir writes a paper showing\nhow to crack the entire class of algorithms in 5 minutes with a slide\nrule and a pencil?\n\n	If they weren't busy throwing muck to smear their competitors,\nI'd feel kinda sorry for 'em. Still do, a little.
...\n\n        There's a better way. Doesn't Qualcom have a secure design\n        that it decided not to market?  Since they aren't going to\n        use it, wouldn't the patriotic thing be to put the design in\n        the public domain? How about selling a "Cryptography\n        Educational Kit" with the critical parts? Something that could\n        end up as a PC option board with two phone jacks?\n\n        Cheers,\n                Marc\n\n---\n Marc Thibault                             | marc@tanda.isis.org\n Automation Architect                      | CIS:71441,2226\n R.R.1, Oxford Mills, Ontario, Canada      | NC FreeNet: aa185
Brad Yearwood posts a long response to the issue of registering a\nphone-clipper relationship.\n\nIt doesn't wash.\n\nRecall that law enforcement gets a court order to tap a suspect's phone\ncalls. They do what they do now--figure out which lines to tap. They then\nrecord the stuff. If it's Clipper, they read the law enforcement block,\nextract the serial number, and get the keys using the court order.\n\nNo new difficulties (such as using someone else's phone instrument or phone\nline) are introduced that wouldn't have existed absent clipper. If the\ncrooks were going to use a pay phone (say), they could have done so without\nclipper. If the government figures out they're so doing, they listen in, and\nif it's a clipper conversation they get the serial number and then the keys.\n\nIf the crooks use an innocent person's clipper phone on the tapped line\nthere's no problem. The Feds don't care whose phone instrument is used, just\nthat the conversation is by the suspect on the tapped line. They get the\nserial number, get the keys, and they are in business.\n\nNo clipper chip to person association is ever needed.\n\nDavid
Arthur Melnick posts an interesting first-hand message about his NEA\nalgorithm. Though I have no reason to disbelieve anything he says, I want to\nclarify one point:\n\nHe says he has no connection with the NSA. If he was part of an "NSA plot",\nof course he'd say that.\n\nNow I don't think he is. But the level of some discussion here is of that\nsort, and very quickly we reach the point where it's impossible to continue\nrationally discussing some issues.\n\n"I am not a crook"\n\n"Well, if you were, of course you'd say that"\n\n\nor the ever popular favorite:\n\n"Please prove the following negative."\n\nI don't know what to do with such messages, so I have taken to ignoring\nthem.\n\nComments?\n\nDavid
This one is easy, they 'tape' the conversation, call the FBI or\nSecret Service.  You see "activities against the Satan Clinton" could be\nconstrued as a threat against the President of the United States.  I am\nsure they(NSA,FBI,SS,...,...) have enough judges in their collective\npockets to have a warrent before the call is over.....
I just joined this group recently and really do not know much about\ncryptography, but a couple things came to mind while reading through\nthe posts.\n\n1.  Is the Clipper chip going to be exported?  If not, how will\npeople communicate with other countries?  Will they have to do\nthat in un-crypt-mode.  Will other encryption techniques be\nlegal (assuming the government cracks down on using others) when\ngoing overseas, but not within the states?\n\n2.  I've read about authentication systems that use an electronic  \nsecurity card that looks like a calculator to create an encrypted\nPIN based on the time/date.  The host system has the algorithm\nbuilt into it as well so that it can authenticate a user.\nIs there some form of encryption technology that would create\nkeys that are only valid at a certain instant in time?  The \nsystems would then allow a "window" of time around this instant\nwhere the key would work.\nI realize that this technique would increase the amount of information\nneeding to be stored because you would need entire algorithms rather\nthan just keys.  But for smaller scale things it might work.\nCould some similar method be used to make the two 80-bit keys that\nare issued to police/FBI/etc to tap a phone only usable for one-week\n(for instance).  If further surveilance was needed, they would have\nto go back to the escrow service to get another key.  This would\nmake it useless for local police to database keys they have used.\n\nI assume this is not possible because the receiving phone would need\nto be able to decypher the message.  But any thoughts on the subject?\n\nThanks,\nTauren Mills
This has to be a dictionary attack.  No other attack makes sense.\n\n\nThis means that whoever encrypted the file just typed some password\nwhich was a single dictionary word, and then Russell tried all the\nwords in the dictionary.  This isn't too implausible, especially if he\nwas smart and clipped the first plaintext block off the ciphertext (if\nthe first block doesn't decrypt then obviously the others won't\neither).\n\nAssuming one attempt a second, it takes seven hours to try all the\nwords in /usr/dict/words.   Not real tough.\n\nIf you want DES to be secure, you have to use RANDOM KEYS.  You can't\njust type your wife's name and think "aha they'll never guess that\none!"\n\n\n\n-- \nDaniel F.

Yes, you can use a stream cipher chip to hash data with only slight \nmodification. See:\n\n`A fast cryptographic checksum algorithm based on stream ciphers', X Lai,\nRA Rueppel, J Woolven, Auscrypt 92 pp 8-7 to 8-11.

A while ago there was a reference to a paper on a crypto file\nsystem (CFS) given by someone at at AT&T (?).   How can I\nget a copy?   Is it available on the net?   Was it published?\nWho was the author?\n\n   Thanks
A person I know, belonging to a research lab of a rivate\ncompany, claimed to me during a priavte conversation that, given the\nequipment in his lab, he could crack a Kerberos ticket in 15 minutes to\nan hour. He had access to rather powerful DES hardware, but not of an\nextraordinare kind, I believe. The attack was possible because of the\namount of known plaintext in the ticket, which itself constitutes a small\nmessage. This was two years ago.\nDES is no longer usable for encryption of really sensitive data. For a\nlot of purposes, however, it is still very adequate.
Hello all,\nI thought you all might like to see this. It's a letter from Jerry\nBerman to David Chaum from November of 1985, in response to\ninformation that Mr. Chaum sent to Mr. Berman.\n\nWhile I have to congratulate EFF for its prompt response to the\nClipper Chip announcement from the White House, I think it's important\nto recognize the philosophy of their Executive Director, as explained\nbelow.\n\nI agree that legal remedies are important, but when pressed, I'd\nprefer to retain the ability to use purely technical solutions to\npreserve my privacy, because they'll hold up under fire.\n\nMr. Chaum has consented to the publication of this letter on the Net. \n\nI don't work for, nor am I a member of EFF, ACLU, or any similar\norganizations, but I do agree with them on a great many things. \n\n					--Aristophanes\n\n----------\n\n\n                     AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION\n\n\n                       WASHINGTON OFFICE        \n                                                               \n                                                    122 Maryland Avenue, NE\n November 1, 1985                                   Washington, DC 20002\n                                                    --------------------\n                                                    National Headquarters\nMr. David Chaum                                     132 West 43rd Street    \nCentre for Mathematics and Computer Science         New York.

A\nsociety of  individuals  and  organizations  that  would  expend  the\ntime and resources to use a  series  of  'digital  pseudonyms' to\navoid data linkage does not in my opinion make big brother\nobsolete but  acts  on  the  assumption  that  big  brother  is  ever\npresent.  I  view  your  system  as  a  form  of  societal  paranoia.\n\n	As a matter of  principle,  we  are  working  to  enact  formal\nlegal protections for  individual  privacy  rather  than  relying  on\ntechnical solutions.   We want to  assume  a  society  of  law  which\nrespects legal limits rather than  a  society  that  will  disobey  the\nlaw, requiring  citizens  to  depend  on  technical  solutions.  e.g.\nrequire  a  judical  warrant  for  government  interception  of  data\ncommunications rather than  encrypt  all  messages  on  the  assumption\nthat regardless of the lawt  the  government  will  abuse  its  power\nand invade privacy.\n\n	As a  matter  of  practicality,  I  do  not  think  your  system\noffers much hope for privacy.    First, the trend toward universal\nidentifiers  is  as  much.-a  movement  generated  by  government  or\nindustry's desire to keep track of all citizens as it is by\ncitizens seeking simplicity and convenience in all transactions.\nAt best,  your  system  would  benefit  the  sophisticated  and  most\nwould opt for  simplicity.  The  poor  and  the  undereducated  would\nnever use or benefit from it.\n\n	Finally where there's a  will, there's  a  way. If  government\nwants to link data bases, it  will,  by  law, require  the  disclosure\nof various individual pseudonyms used by citizens or prohibit it\nfor data bases which the government wants to link.      Since\ncorporations  make  money  by  trading  commercial  lists  with   one\nanother, they will never adopt  the  system  or  if  it  is  adopted,\nwill use "fine printn  contracts  to  permit  selling  various   codes\nused by their customers to other firms.\n\n	The solution remains law, policy, and consensus about limits\non government or corporate intrusion into areas of individual\nautonomy.  Technique can be used to enforce that consensus or to\noverride it. It cannot be used as a substitute for such\nconsensus.\n\n\n\n                                            Sincerely Yours,\n\n                                             /Sig/\n\n                                            Jerry J.

There are companies (one in Canada, as I recall) which specialize in\nanalyzing chips to understand process technology, design rules,\n... to understand the probable yield of the assembly line making them,\nand therefore the probable current cost and possible future cost curves,\ngiven design shrinks, statistical quality control -> better yields, etc.\n\nTaiwanese, Japanese and especially Korean semiconductor manufacturers\nhave all (korea continues) reverse-engineered foreign chips and\nproduced the chip.  Taiwan and Japan have signed intellectual\nproperty treaties, and now at least extract the gate/transitor level\ndesign before laying the chip out again.  The koreans still\nuse mask-level copying, I believe.  At least, they are under a lot\nof pressure to pass laws to meet international intellectual property\nstandards.\n\nAll this despite lots of attempts to hide the designs.  There are lots\nof techniques to do so in both hardware and software design.\n\nFor a complex chip, there will be real intellectual effort extracting\nthe gate design from the transistor design, and the algorithm from\nthe gate design.  But it won't take two smart guys even 6 months, working\n40 hour weeks.  Koreans work 60 or more 8)\n\nLew
I came. I lurked. I read the FAQ.\n\nNow having purchased the recommended books, and having taken to heart the advice that\none knows nothing about crypto without having done a stint as a cryptanalyst, I would like\nto correspond with people interested in cryptology.\n\nI am working on implementing the cryptanalyst's workbench example in Booch's OOD with\nApplications. I hope to start sending ciphers back and forth so each of us can practice cracking\nthem.  I would like to start with simple Ceaser's ciphers and progress roughly according to\nDavid Kahn's book. Of course I would be interested in general discussions and math also.\n\nI hope to have some foriegn correspondants so that we can test the response time of the\n"men in the suits" I've been hearing so much about.

Is this "White House e-mail address" really working yet? Someone\nposted such an address on CompuServe a few months ago, but apparently\nthe White House wasn't really set up to recive hundreds (thousands?)\nof messages a day to that account and didn't want people to use it\nyet. So is this MCI address something the people at the White House\nactually read, or is it another Craig Shergold story? I don't know --\nI'm just asking.\n\nUnless the people at the White House print and distribute this mail\nevery day, you may have better luck printing out a letter (on paper,\nthat flat white stuff all over my desk) and Snail-Mailing it to the\nWhite House.

Evil and good walk hand in hand.  It is also important to note that\nthe good in the tools lies in the wielder of the tools.\n\n\nI cannot accept this ridiculous leap in logic.  Technology is neutral\nto good or evil.  When technology is used by "evil" men, it is called\nevil technology.  When it is used by "good" men, it is called good\ntechnology.  Really, it is just technology that allows action to be\nrealized more efficently and on a larger scale.\n\n\nTry not to confused the development of technology with its use.\nCertainly, "bright" people will be better at creating technology, but\neven young children know how to program VCR machines.  Are VCR\nmachines not extremely complex to create?\n\n\nAdaptibility and flexibility is always better at enduring than the\nstiff and stubborn.  A young child is soft and supple; an old man is\nstiff and inflexible.  A dripping of water can cut through stone.\nThis has nothing to do with technology, rather technology just\nallows us to magnify action.\n\n\nI have no objection to this!  :)

I have a couple reasons why I would be more likely to trust this algorithm:\n	1. The algorithm will be made totally public, once it is patented.\n	2. The keys will NOT be escrowed.\nOf course if either of these is not true, I will not use this new algorithm.\nSince I have never seen this new algorithm, I have no idea how secure it is\nyet.\n\nI can't make any judgements about the algorithm itself yet, but I do notice\nthat the creators of this algorithm are being more open about how the\nthing works, and is willing to make it public, showing that after a bit\nof scrutiny, any weaknesses will probably be revealed, while we don't know\nabout Clipper.\n\nDoug Holland

Steve Bellovin writes a well-thought-out and nearly persuasive article about\nwhy the Clipper (are we still calling it Clipper today, or have they figured\nout a non-infringing word yet?) protocol is almost as good as one can do\ngiven their marching ordes.\n\n\nI'll accept the second assumption only for the sake of argument.  In my\nview the primary remaining flaw is that the encryption algorithm is\nsecret, leading to suspicion that there is a back door.  Without complete\ndisclosure this suspicion cannot be dispelled, no matter how many trusted\nexperts are allowed to look at it in isolation.\n\nIs it possible to do this whole thing with a public algorithm?  The only\nconcern I've seen with making Skipjack public is that someone could build\nClipperphones without registering the keys.  Assume F can really be kept\nsecret as the Government assumes.  Then as part of the initial connection,\na Clipperphone executes a protocol with the Pseudophone to demonstrate\nthat they both know F.  For example, the initiating phone picks a number Q\nand sends E[Q; F].  The receiver sends back E[Q+1; F], and the initiator\nsends back E[Q+2; F] to demonstrate that her first packet wasn't just a\nrandom 64-bit block.  Repeat in the opposite direction with another Q so\nit can't be defeated by somebody building up a library of sequential\nnumbers by remembering responses and using those responses as the initial\nnumbers of subsequent challenges.  This way Clipperphones will talk only\nto other Clipperphones.  Of course the Pseudo Company can build their own\nproprietary Skipjack phone, but the Presidential Fact Sheet implies that\nthey won't get approval for it without equivalent key escrow.\n\nWhat's wrong with this picture?  It depends of F staying secret and on\nSkipjack being resistant to cryptanalysis, but the Government appears to\nbelieve in both of these.  Even if the particular Q&A I suggest has some\nflaw, I imagine there's a zero-knowledge-proof protocol that doesn't.\n\n\nAgreed.  My view, and you can quote me: if it's not worth doing, it's\nnot worth doing well.
Actually, David, I don't think it's any more intellectually honest to\nsay there are no backdoors than to say there are backdoors, unless you've\nhad a chance to examine the algorithm and the silicon closely.  For all\nwe know, skipjack could be easily broken, or impossible to break.  And\nclearly, if skipjack is not secure, then the clipper chip is not worth much.
I seem to recall Rush saying that he has a CompuServe account.

I don't think mr. Clinton can even understand the technical details of\nthe clipper encryption scheme.

> Just curious, how would the Clipper Chip system handle\n   > conference calls?\n\n   It's not Clipper, it's any encryption system.  I've seen a number of\n   designs; they generally involve a multi-line cleartext bridge.\n\nDepending on the encryption system, so long as everyone has the same\nkey, it can be done.  For example, I was using "vat", which is an\nInternet Audio tool, for a conference call, and we were encrypting the\nsession.  (Unfortunately, one site was doing more work, and didn't\nhave the CPU for it, so it didn't sound all that good at a different\nsite)\n\nSo, you don't neccessarily have to have a clear-text bridge.  But if\nyou do, its totally internal to one of the sites involved in the\nconversation....\n\n-derek
Given that certain archival methods have certain key(cleartext) in a file I\nused a programatic dictionary attack.  I used the DES library provided with the\nsystem that I was using.  What is to keep anyone from being lucky with a key?\n \n\nMy previous employment has nothing to do with my current address, other than\nthe fact that the fastest machine in the office was an IBM RISC System/6000 \nmodel 530, with 16 meg of memory.(not a super-computer)\n \n\nI really think this more of a statement of the limitations placed on the key\nby the interface(ascii char/no padding), and most programs don't bother to\nclear off the archival front and backend ID's.\n\n\nYes any moderatly bright programmer with a little idle machine time, can\ncrack most of todays real world encryption.  I sure that you or I could\nselect a key, and prepare the data inorder that the decryption will become a \nworst case.  but that is not the real world, and I'm sure that is how any \nagency would start an attack on a message, as you pointed out, there are some \nvery good recognition algorithms availible, I'm just not familiar with them.\n\nA.G.
There are several things in ITAR which have never been tested in court. \nThe concensus appears to be:\n\nYou could be arrested as an international arms trafficker.  (You could,\nregardless of the state of the law, but there are some paragraphs which\nsuggest you would be violating the law.)\n\nIf it goes to court, the ITARs could be thrown out is incompatible with the\nFirst amendment; or the court could rule that "software" is "technical\ndata" not subject to the ITARs; or the court could rule that the\nphrase "publicly available" as defined in the ITARs would apply,\nmaking it only subject to requiring a general export license; or, you could\nbe prosecuted successfully for arms trafficing or espionage.  General\nconcensus among lawyers who have read the ITARs, is that one of the first\ntwo would occur.
Sounds great.  But how would something like this be done?  Start up a\nnews group for discussions of things like lobbying tecniques and how to\nget non-computer geeks as pissed-off as we are?
I don't think mr. Clinton can even understand the technical details of\n	the clipper encryption scheme.

No-one is going to tell him\nit has a back door.  The NSA will assume he has the sense to work it out\nfor himself or they wouldn't be pushing it.  Clinton might even *believe*\nthe NSA when they tell him, for the record, it doesn't have a back door.\n\nAnd no FOIA request in the world will ever find it.  These guys don't\nplay by that set of rules.  They have their own rule book, and no, you're\nnot allowed to see that either.
This is an interesting point.  As a VERY COARSE rule of thumb, you can\nfigure that the final price of a product is 3 to 5 times the Cost Of Goods.\n(The exact multiplier depends largely on economies of scale: Products that\nsell tens of millions of units/year will be at the low end, those that sell\nthousands of units/year will be at the high end.  I suspect cellular phones\nare in the middle).  This implies that adding a $25 chip would increase the\ncost of the phone by approx $100, or about 25% - 30%.\n\nI don't think you'll get a lot of consumer support for this.\n\n\n-tony

There are other laws and directives which bear upon the subject.  For\nexample, the National Computer Security Act of 1987 specifically directs\nNBS [sic] to work with NSA on developing security standards for civilian\nFederal computers.  (Pick up the bill from cpsr.org; it also includes\na report describing it, and some of the legislative history, including\nconcerns about NSA's involvement.)  Note also that NSA is specifically\ncharged with running the National Computer Security Center,  -- to\nquote the aforementioned report -- ``NSA also will work with industries at\nthe DOD Computer Security Center to develop security standards for private\nsector use.''

Mr. Sternlight, your naivete and historical ignorance is appalling.\n\n[ History lesson detailing 1968-74 deleted. ]
Has anyone ported RIPEM to the Amiga yet or is anyone working on it?\n\nEmailed responses are fine.
Firstly, an aside:\n\nI agree that the weakness exists, but I have a lot of trouble\nbelieving that it represents a difficulty in real life. Given:\n\n1. the purpose of the one-time pad is to give unbreakable security,\nand the expense of key distribution etc., imply that the clients\nreally do want that level of security\n\n2. These same people want to keep P a secret\n\nI find it hard to believe that Eve might happen to have a copy of P\nlying around.\n\n(I am aware that the same argument applies to Eve knowing even a small\npart of the message, but Eve must know EXACTLY where (which bytes) in\nC her known susequence starts, or the result will be garbled. I find\nthis at least as surprising.)\n\nBack to the question:\n\nIf I had the resources to use a one-time-pad for such transmissions, I\nwould also append a Message Authentication Code to the message, using up\nthe next bits of the one-time-pad as the key perhaps. Your original\nquestion basically asked whether there was any way to authenticate the\nmessage with the same degree of security as the Pad itself provided,\nand I don't know the answer. However, I would propose the following\nfor discussion.\n\nAlice and Bob have an arbitrary number of secret, random bits to\nshare, which Eve doesn't know. She finds them out (effectively) by\nknowing some P and the corresponding C. It is the fact that they\nCORRESPOND that causes the problem. If a message authentication code was to\nbe created using some one-time-pad operation such that Eve could not\nknow which parts of the MAC were affected by which parts of the input,\nshe would be unable to forge a MAC to correspond.\n\nWhat is required is a non-linear combiner of parts of the message.\n(Non-linear so that simply xoring or subtracting or whatever doesn't\nhave exactly the same effect).\n\nNow, at the end of the encrypted message C, Alice appends a n-bit MAC\ncomputed as follows (S2 means the next full chunk of the one time pad):\n  1. compute C2 = P xor S2, and pad to an n-bit boundary with more of S\n  2. break C2 into n-bit chunks\n  3. set MAC to 0 (initialisation vector)\n  4. for i in each chunk sequentially\n       set MAC = MAC NLOP C2[i]\n\nAt the end of this process MAC is the Message Authentication Code.\n\n(Bob verifies the MAC in the obvious manner; he recovers the\nplaintext P, then uses some more of his pad to reproduce the MAC in\nthe same manner.)\n\nNLOP is the non-linear operator, and there is the rub. The simplest\nnon-linear operator I can think of is an S-box; that is, have a fixed\n(even published) permutation of the n-bit integers, an indexable table\ncalled Sbox, and use:\n  x NLOP y = x xor Sbox[y].\n\nPractically speaking, I think this solves your problem, as Eve never\nsees the intermediate output C2, and hence can't deduce S2 or perform any valid\nsubstitution on it.\n\nAlso practically speaking, you want the MAC to be fairly large, say 32\nbits, but you might not want a 4 gigabyte (say) S-box, so you might\nwork on 4 byte-sized S-boxes, but I think that is an irrelevant detail\nfor the discussion at hand.\n\nWho will be first to point out my errors, or give me a pointer to some\nliterature?

[...]\n[...]\n\nAgain -- I'm extremely sorry about this..  I got this message several \nmonths ago (quite a bit before the clipper chip proposal) when it was posted\nto a different newsgroup.  It was very startling to me as well, and I guess\nI should of verified the source at least to some extent before reposting..\n\nAaack..
I did.  You're mistaken.  NSA's communications intelligence mission is\n   strictly against foreign governments.  Here's an excerpt from the enabling\n   charter (24 Oct 52, Truman) that should clarify this.  The charter was\n   declassified in about Feb 1990 when an FOIA request made it public.\nInteresting!  Where can I get the whole thing?\n\n   NSA is not in the standard-setting business, though -- that's why this\n   Clipper stuff came from NIST, which I believe is tasked with coming up\n   with standards based on their best inputs from other government agencies,\n   which would include NSA.\n\nSeveral of the newspaper reports have made it fairly clear that the\nNSA did all the real work.  You can't believe everything you read in\nthe papers :-), but the package of information the NIST is faxing out\nhas so little information beyond what's widely known that it sounds\nlike it's true.
I have been looking over the postings about the Clipper Chip and noticed\nan interesting omission from the discussion.\n\nYou all mention that the algorithm is classified and have expressed \nconcerns and ideas of how to figure out the algorithm using software.\n\nThe question that I have is why cant someone take one of these chips\nand reverse engineer it? I mean, take the thing to a chip testing/\nanalysis facility, one with a decent electron microscope. Just pry\noff the top of the chip and start scanning it with the electron\nmicrocope and figure out the circuitry. I remembered a place that I use\nto work for had one of these facilities that they used to analyze chips\nthat we accidently blew out while running tests. They could actually find\nthe area that was fried and show us where in the circuit it was. \n\nI am sure that many companies and universities must have these facilities\nand that the potential is there, especially at a university where the\nsecurity at such a facility is looser, for someone to take a clipper\napart and analyze it?\n\nWhat can the government do to prevent this? Start taking away all \nmicrochip analysis facilities and electron microscopes??
The points raised about checking what is actually -in- the chip, as\nopposed to what is allegedly programmed therein, raise yet another trust\nissue.  Even if we assume that these "trusted agents" are really entering\na wide range of S1 and S2 seeds (rather than using the same one all the\ntime to reduce the key search space to 30 bits), I assume they are not\ndoing so by picking up an iron filing and poking it into the circuitry\nat carefully selected points to encode data.  They would presumably be\npunching numbers into a computer, which for all they know could program\nthe chips in a manner completely independent of the S1 and S2 values they\nare feeding into the system.
So, who is Mykotronx, Inc.?  It would be nice to know that they are\nnot a front company used by an intelligence or other agency of the \nU.S. government.\n\nWhile we are at it, the chip design(s) should be examined and verified\nagainst silicon to insure no trap doors or hidden protocols exist in silicon,\nregardless of the security level of the encryption algorithm.  There is\nno proof that the chip won't squeel and role over for someone with the\nproper knowledge to interrogate it via the communications link.\n\nThe design examination should be done to the gate level.  Also, how does one\nverify that what you are looking at is reflected in tapeout, or masks?\n\nThe silicon should be examined as well, the design in hand (a clean room\npublicly defined clipper chip) can be merged with another design later, or\nchanged between completion and mask out.  There is little proof that what\nyou are told is in the chip is all that is in the chip.\n\nPut the (verified) masks in escrow, and use them for chip production,\nuse a third escrow party for programming the chips.
I've recently been reading a paper of Merkle's (publixhed only on the\nnet, I think) discussing three potential replacements for DES.  Was\nanyting ever done with these?  Are Khufu, Khafre, and/or Snefru still\nbeing discussed anywhere?  (I know Snefru is referenced in the RSA\nFAQ, and I think it may also be in the sci.crypt FAQ.)\n   On a related topic, can anyone point me toward good sites to find\npapers/articles/discussions of cryptology?

The easiest way is a user fee for each clipper chip manufactured. This makes\nthe funding separate from government.\n\nIt also has the neat side property that if the chip doesn't catch on, the\nscheme breaks down, and the government is back to the drawing boards,\nassuming that they haven't prohibited alternatives in the meantime.\n\nIn fact, maybe this should be part of the "official" system. Before the\ngovernment is allowed to move this past the "experimental" stage, they\nshould have to demonstrate economic viability by mass adoption. The\ngovernment is very fond of demonstration projects proving feasibility in the\nuse of government funds for social programs--they should have to make a\nsimilar feasibility demonstration (on economic viability cum acceptance\nterms) for this baby as well.

Can you tell us more?
Interesting.  Tell us, what happens if I were to say OK, I want to have\nsomething else.  If the law enforcement wants my traffic, they can record\nit, then get a search warrant, and get the keys FROM ME, just like they\nwould the keys to a stout private safe, etc. (Lets say I suspect that\nthere is a way to trivially crack this at the Fed level, with no warrant,\nsay for NSA scanning for keywords, etc., and the government has abused\ngreat power in the past...).\n\nSo I say "Mr Vendor, I want something different, independent.  I am\na paranoid sort, ya understand...".\n\nWill the result be "Sorry, without Government permission, we cannot sell\nyou anything secure", or would it be "Sorry, we know which side our\nbread is buttered on, we cannot sell except to government people, law\nenforcement, and 'special' people...".\n\nWhat, in your opinion, would be the chances of "sure, we will sell you\nthis secure system ... be happy to..."\n\nAlso, please be so kind as to tell us what the plans are for private\nencryption of, say files transferred by modem, or FTP, or data stored\non disk?  SURELY you have a feel for what the administration is planning\nfor us people on that....  With your rather intimate relationship with\nthe FBI, NSA, etc. you must CERTAINLY have an idea.  You are surely\nnot going to say "the people are not to know, until it is too late..."\nThis IS supposed to be government of the people by the PEOPLE, isn't\nit?  That is, the people ARE the government's BOSSES?  The BOSSES\nwant to know what the *@()#*&(@ is going on here...\n\nYou see, I am kind of nervous, because in the last month or so, I have\nseen a non-stop stream of ideas coming out of Wash DC that at least\nappear VERY STRONGLY to have a common trait to limit privacy (freedom\nfrom Govt eavesdropping), and the ability to defend ourselves against\nviolent attack (no, 911 is *NOT* good enough for 'common folk', they\narrive only in time to clean up the mess: I would be DEAD if I had to\ndepend on 911...).   You see, with all that talk about National smart\nID cards, limiting of encryption to 'government approved', denial of\nmeans to effective personal defense (EIGHT bills in congress right now),\nit looks an AWFULLY lot like the whole thing is to be able to trace\nEVERY ACTIVITY of an individual from cradle to grave.  All it would take\nis requiring that National ID card to be used in all transactions...\nand with no effective data protection, and with the people suitably\ndisarmed, there would not be a helluva lot they could do about it, now\nwould there?  All in the name of the War on the Constitu ... er ...\ndrugs, and of course that catch word 'terrorists'.  What is wrong with\ngood OLD-FASHIONED POLICE WORK to build a case?  They don't want to\nhave to be burdened to leave the office, it seems...\n\nPlease read the Bill of Rights (first ten amendments to the US\nConstitution) and tell us how you can reconcile this Big Brother-ish\npolicy of the Administration (always for a 'crisis' of some kind, isn't\nit?) with that Bill of Rights in the context of the people who wrote\nit?\n\nReassure us - please... (or is that no longer regarded as necessary,\nseeing as apparantly the people have NO input on this agenda, the\nAdministration preferring to make all the DECISIONS in secret, then\nspringing it on us...).  Doesn't sound much like ... by the PEOPLE\nto me.  I cannot help notice that the congress people involved were\nNOT mentioned on the press release.  I find that more than a little\nbit curious, don't you?  I sure would like to know who to not vote\nfor come election time...\n\nYes, I am upset.  I feel you are a part of this, because I recall it\nwas you that was posting HEAVILY in favor of a very similar idea (could\nhave been the SAME thing, it was so close) a few months ago...  I\nalso recall it was not well received.  Apparantly powers-that-be\nreally didn't care (or were not told, or both).\n\nFrom what I see, Clipper will ONLY be useful for conversations I don't\nwant the neighborhood kid listening in on.  Any SERIOUS security I don't\nthink I would want to trust it a bit.  Might as well use cleartext.\nCertainly corporations would be rather dumb to depend on this for serious\ntrade-secret data, especially if millions depended on that security.\nGiven enough money, one could BUY any keys they wanted.  Buy a crooked\njudge, and a crooked cop.   Given a few hundred thou, they wouldn't be\nhard to find.  So, we end up with only criminals, terrorists, and the\nGovernment with real security, and the ability to eavesdrop.  You know\nthe first two, if they are serious, ain't going to use this thing for\nTHEIR communications.  I bet the government won't, either (except perhaps\nto order a pizza).\n\nTell us, will that be prima face evidence of criminal activity,\nsomeone not using the 'government approved' methods?  That just a desire\nto have PRIVACY is no longer regarded as a legitimate right of an\nunconnected citizen?  Will that be grounds for a fly-through-the-door\nraid, and confiscation of all one's equipment, as 'terrorist tools',\nusing civil forfeiture, so there will be no inconvenient need to\nPROVE any wrongdoing on the part of the citizen?\n\nI have yet another question, are we going to see articles in all the\npublic magazines, consisting of soothing text telling us how great\nthis is, how nice the government is by LETTING us have this illusion\nof privacy?

You have a warrant to tap his line?\n\n  FEDS: Well, no, but we have a warrant to tap Carlos "Slime-Devil" Gonzales'\n     line, and our tap shows that Mr. Gonzales is using Mr. Blow's phone.

I speculate, from the MykoTronx data sheet on the MYK-78, that the algorithm \nis a classified cryptosystem, similar in application to DES but cleared by \nthe NSA for classified traffic, that has been in use for a number of years.  \nMyktotronx refers to it as "Government Type II encryption", which matches the \ndesignation of one of the types of encryption available on STU-III phones, \nand may be the same as a cryptosystem I have heard called "CIPHER2".\n\nThis would make sense, since this is evidently a field-proven cryptosystem \nwhich can act as a "pin-compatible" substitute for DES.  Combined with a \ntappable key exchange protocol, this would offer exactly what is claimed for \nClipper: secure encryption with access via a key escrow.  If this is fact the \ncase, it would make me quite confident of the encipherment algorithm itself.\n\nNow, I do not know if these are in fact the same cryptosystem; my knowledge \nof classified cryptography isn't even fuzzy :), it's nonexistent.  However, \nit would certainly have been the least-effort approach on the part of the \ngovernment: take an old military cipher that people can drop in place of DES \n(and which is at least as secure), set up a key escrow scheme for law \nenforcement, and promote it for public use.  This also fits with Mykotronx, \nwho's been around but almost invisible for years.\n\nHas anyone else made this sort of connection, or am I just hallucinating pink \nelephants here? :).  My curiousity has been piqued...
something that no one has discussed yet (or I missed it):\n\nThe FBI sets up a wiretap AFTER the court order was handed. \nOnly at this point they can access the line and detect \nthe serial number N.\n\nWhat happens next, does the FBI simply asks for the keys\nfor N, and, since a warrant was issued for the line, the FBI \nsimply gets it? What if multiple phones are used from the\nsame house, the FBI just asks for N1, N2, etc.?\n\nExactly who is to prevent the FBI from claiming some\nother serial number, X, was also used over the wirtapped \nline and get the keys for X? \n\nEither a second court order (for the specific serial/key)\nis required (and I have seen no indication of this), or\nthe FBI can effectively ask for any pair of keys at any\ntime, so the escrow key holders are a total fake.\n\nAn unrelated issue: if and when all phones always use\nthe clipper chip, how are call-transfers going to take \nplace?!

We had a senior NSA scientist in Cambridge at one of our workshops recently\n(in fact he was here when the Clipper announcement was made, but we didn't\nlearn of it till after he'd gone). He said on this point that he was forbidden\nby law to monitor conversations between US nationals (and he is a chap who is \nvery precise about his choice of words). So I don't expect he'd have any qualms\nabout monitoring a domestic US conversation if one of the parties was an alien.\n\nHowever it got me thinking of the Navajo code talkers.

Sorry, my news reader doesn't seem to know how to copy a subject header.\nThis tracks the thread "why people don't need strong crypto....."\n\nThe Atomic Energy Act of 1954 expressly forbids *thinking* about building\nnuclear devices.  While I was in grad school, a friend of mine got a \nsecurity clearance to work on the defense for the Progressive magazine.\nHe found lots of articles which were public domain *removed* from the\nlocal engineering library (Madison Wisconsin).  So the lawyers sent him\nall over the states to other libraries to show that the information in\nthe article was already public.  What pissed everyone off was a local\nunderground paper went and published the article anyway (it had been\nprecensored by the feds, that's what this was all about) so the judge\ndeclared the case moot.\n\nThe Atomic Energy Act of 1954 has never been tested in court.  From my\ndiscussions with several people familiar with the case, only 2 other\ntimes has this preemptive clause been used.  In every case the people\nsimply did what they felt like and courts tossed the cases out.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, the government *does* have precidence for\ndeclaring things classified *after* it has been published.  While I was\nworking on Star Wars this happened to me: my clearance was in the works\nand I developed a method for tracking particle beams.  It was good enough\nto classify, so I was no longer allowed to work on it.  A friend from\nCanada was in the same boat: he developed a method to compute stripping\ncross sections, but because the subject was classified *he was not allowed\nto present his own paper at a conference!*.  He later published it in an\nopen journal without problems.\n\nWhen the going gets wierd, the wierd turn pro.  The feds can do whatever\nthey want whenever they feel like it, and they will make up rules to let\nthemselves get away with it.  Since the mass media can't tell the difference\nbetween a joke and the real thing (like "ranch appocolypse" for the Waco\nmassacre) don't count on them to help spread the word about their loss\nof freedom.  The government *can* make strong crypto illegal.  SO WHAT?\nSince the government does not obey any of its own rules, why should we?

I can't answer all our questions in detail, but I can take a stab at\nthem.\n\nThe form the operations that compute R1, R2, and R3 is, of course, the\nfamous ``triple encryption'' suggested for use with DES.  It's much\nstronger than a single encryption, and has an effective key length of\n160 bits.  For reasons that were discussed when DES was first\nstandardized, a simple double encryption would not have the same\nstrength.  Triple encryption has been used by IBM since more or less\nthe beginning to encrypt other keys.  It's recommended for anything of\nvery high value.  And I think we can agree that the R_i and S_i fit\nthat description.\n\nWhy n_1, n_2, and n_3?  Well, you need different plaintext values.  I\nhave no idea if they'll be disclosed or not.  At a guess, they're\nconstructed so that they differ in as many bit positions as possible.\nA goo cryptosystem will scramble things a lot with even a 1-bit change\n-- but the values of N in a series will have fairly similar bit\npatterns, and there might, conceivably, be a weakness.  So the n_i\nvalues are -- and I'm guessing -- chosen to increase the Hamming\ndistance.\n\nIn any event, I'm quite convinced that one cannot go back to the S_i\nfrom the U_i, let alone U.  (Observe:  if the NSA has U, they don't\nneed to find S_i.  But even if they do, they can't get U_1 and U_2.  In\ntheory, they should never even see those values, even with a warrant.)\n\nThe real question, I think, is why use this scheme at all, as opposed\nto a hardware random number generator.  My answer is that this is\n*much* more verifiable.  Look -- suppose that NSA, NIST, the ACLU, the\nEFF, and the NRA combined to build a *really* good random number\ngenerator, and that it passed every test you could think of.  When you\ncome back next week to program some more chips, does it still work that\nwell?  Have any components changed in value?  Have the components been\nchanged out from under you?  Does it still work well the in the\npresence of a focused microwave beam that tends to bias it towards\nselecting 1 bits?  Yes, you can run detailed statistical tests on it\nagain, but that's hard.\n\nConsider, on the other hand, a software solution.  You bring your own\nfloppies with you, you can run cryptographic checksums, etc.  It's a\nlot easier to verify that the software is unchanged, in other words.\n(Yes, I can think of ways to cheat software, too.  I think that they're\na lot harder.)\n\nThere are three issues with Clipper.  The first is whether or not the\narchitecture of the whole scheme is capable of working.  My answer,\nwith one significant exception, is yes.  I really do think that NSA and\nNIST have designed this scheme about as well as can be, assuming that\ntheir real objectives are as stated: to permit wiretapping, under\ncertain carefully-controlled circumstances, with a minimum risk of\nabuse.  (The exception is that U exists outside of the chip, on a\nprogramming diskette.  That's seriously wrong.  U_1 and U_2 should be\nloaded onto the chip separately.)  To those who disagree (and I don't\nclaim my answer is obvious, though I found my own reasoning\nsufficiently persuasive that I was forced to rewrite the Conclusions\nsection of my technical analysis paper -- I had originally blasted the\nscheme), I issue this invitation:  assume that you were charged with\nimplementing such a system, with complete regard for civil rights and\ndue process.  What would you do differently?  In answering this\nquestion, please accept NSA's fundamental assumptions:  that both\nstrong cryptography against outsiders, and the ability to wiretap\n*some* domestic users, is necessary.  (If you feel it necessary to\nchallenge those assumptions, do it in the context of the last issue I\npresent below.  Right here, I'm discussing *just* the technical\naspects.  And no, I don't by any means claim that just because\nsomething can be done, it should be.)\n\nThe second issue is whether or not this whole architecture is actually\ngoing to be used.  Just because Clipper chips are made this way doesn't\nmean that that's the only way they'll be made.  Maybe the NSA will\nsubstitute its own chips between the programming facility and the\nshipping dock.  And they'll generate bogus warrant requests, so that\nthe escrow agents don't wonder why they've never called.  (``Sorry,\nguys; all them terrorists and drug dealers and pedophiles seem to have\nbought triple-DES phones instead.  Who'd 'a' thunk it?'')  I have no\nanswer to this question, and at the moment, I don't see a way of\nanswering it.  Those concerns are part of my reasoning in my answer\nto the final question, below.\n\nThe third, and most serious issue, is whether or not Clipper is a good\nidea even if carried out strictly according to the letter of the law.\nI think that the answer is no, but it's not a no-brainer.  I'm a civil\nlibertarian, not a libertarian, for reasons that I explained at great\nlength on the net in the Elder Days, and that I don't have the energy\nto repeat now.  But that means that I'm willing to accept that some\nlaws are necessary, so long as they respect the essential rights of\nindividuals.  The government already has the ability and -- in our\nsystem -- the right to issue search warrants, and while that power has\ncertainly been abused, it's also been used quite properly and fairly in\nother cases.  Is key escrow sufficiently different?  I think so -- but\nagain, it's not an easy question for me.  (It is easy for libertarians\nto answer, of course, since Clipper is completely alien to much of the\nrest of their (oft-admirable) philosophy.  And it's also easy for those\nwho give their unreserved trust to government, a group I'm much more\ndistant from.)

The government told them "don't do encryption\n   if you ever hope to export this technology".  The reason that CDMA doesn't\n   have encryption is NOT because the G-men came a'knocking at Qualcomm's door.\n   It's because Qualcomm doesn't think that the US market for digital cellular\n   is big enough for them.

Qualcomm isn't.  So Cylink makes\n   money--that's capitalism, comrade.\n\nWell, some people like capitalism, and others prefer free enterprise;\nthey're different!

If you think it's so easy, why are\n   you whining on the net instead of getting your butt in gear and writing it?\n\nWriting good crypto code is something most good programmers can do;\nwriting good new crypto algorithms is a very specialized skill.\nDeveloping new voice coding algorithms is also pretty specialized,\nbut finding ways to implement the more complex ones when you don't\nhave enough horsepower is still fairly hairy stuff.\nOnce the 586/Pentium becomes widespread, or the next generation of\nsound boards has DSPs on it, I suspect we'll see it happen.\nMaybe the vanilla 486+Soundblaster is enough.
Gentlefolk,\n\n        It seems to me that the "Step 1" of taking a warrant to the\n        telco to get a wiretap is so much stinky red herring (don't\n        you love animal metaphors).\n\n        With each phone broadcasting the serial number of its chip\n        ("E(N;F)" is not syntactically different than "N"), all they\n        have to do is aim a reciever in the general direction of\n        today's target and use the serial number to identify the\n        session they want, and get the chip number of the other end of\n        the conversation. Even without the key, this is great for\n        traffic analysis. I can think of several ways to learn the\n        right serial number.\n\n        It looks like one intended effect of the Clipper is to\n        eliminate the awkward business of getting the telco to\n        cooperate (or risking getting caught in the act with your\n        alligator clips erect).

Something similar has happened to me - ages ago when we were working on PGP\nwe used to send short messages about development issues or simply to test \nnew features around.  Now at this time PGP (and certainly the newer version)\nwas unknown over here.  Suddenly the admin at the site I was using received\na request that I stop sending encrypted email.  Now there is almost no way\nthat some automatic scanner could have found this, since they wouldn't have\nknown about PGP - they *must* have checked for unknown data types in the\nmessage, tried to unscramble it, found they couldn't get past the PEM\narmour part, and then contacted the sysadmin and asked me to stop.  Luckily\nthe current email carriers are less picky about what goes over their\nnetworks :-).\n\nIn case people think email scanning doesn't take place, I can assure you\nthat it is done regularly by many sites - usually not by government\nagencies (or at least not that I know of), but by local administrators who,\nfor reasons of their own, have decided to monitor all communications\n(I'm sure you can all think of a whole mess of reasons - stop hackers/\nterrorists/child pornographers/drug dealers/evil commies/whatever).  There\nhave been several occasions when I've got people into trouble simply by\nincluding the traditional NSA bait in a message (I don't try it any more\nnow :-).  A friend of mine was once picked up for mentioning the name of\nthe UK town of Scunthorpe (hint: look for words embedded in it).  I'm sure\nthere are many more examples of this happening (in fact if anyone has any\nexamples I'd appreciate hearing from them - I could use them as\nammunition during talks on privacy issues).\n\nPeter.
This sounds an awful lot like a password-guesser, not a weakness in\nDES.  Merritt and I pointed out this weakness in Kerberos in a paper\nthat came out about 2.5 years ago, in both Computer Communications\nReview and Usenix.  For that matter, it was loudly discussed on the\nKerberos mailing list even earlier.\n\nThe problem has nothing whatsoever to do with DES, and everything to do\nwith bad password selection.
WOULD WIRETAP CHIP BE COST-EFFECTIVE?\n\n                        by Robin Hanson\n                     Draft, April 21, 1993\n\n  SUMMARY: Compared to an average monthly phone bill of sixty dollars,\n  wiretaps are only worth two cents a month to police.  So the\n  proposed wiretap chip must raise phone costs by less than one part \n  in three thousand to be cost-effective. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nUntil now, phones have happened to allow the existence of "wiretaps",\ndetectors which could pick up conversations on a phone line.  And over\ntime, law enforcement agencies have come to rely on this capability to\naid in criminal investigations.  However, powerful new encryption\ntechnologies threaten this status quo, by making possible truly\nprivate communication.  A small chip in each phone could soon make it\nliterally impossible to overhear a conversation without physical\nmicrophones at either end.\n\nIn order to preserve the ability of law enforcement agencies to tap\nphone conversations, the U.S. government announced on April 16, 1993\nthat it had developed and begun manufacturing a special "wiretap" chip\nto be placed in future phones, instead of the total privacy chips\nwhich have been under private development.  The same day, AT&T\nannounced it would use these chips "in all its secure telephone\nproducts".\n\nEach chip would be created under government supervision, when it would\nbe given a fixed indentifier and encryption key.  Periodically during\neach conversation, the chip would broadcast its identifier and other\ninfo in a special "law enforcement block".  Law enforcement officers\nwith a court order could then obtain the key corresponding to the\nindentifier from special trust agencies, and could thereby listen in\non any future or previously recorded conversations on that phone.\n\nTo date, most concerns voiced about this plan have been about its\nsecurity.  The government won't disclose the encryption algorithm, and\nmany suspect the government will not limit its access in the way it\nhas claimed.  The track record of previous governments does not\ninspire confidence on this point [1].\n\nHowever, this paper will neglect these concerns, and ask instead\nwhether this new wiretap chip is a cost-effective tool for police\ninvestigation.  That is, which is a cheaper way for society to\ninvestigate crime: force phone communications to support wiretaps, or\ngive police agencies more money to investigate crimes in other ways?\nOr to put it another way, would police agencies be willing to pay for\neach wiretap, if they had to pay their share of the full social cost\nof forcing phones to support wiretaps?\n\nTo start to answer this question, we might compare the current\nbenefits wiretaps provide to law enforcement agencies with projected\ncosts of implementing the new wiretap chip plan.  And since current\nbenefits are easier to estimate, we begin there.\n\nWIRETAP BENEFITS\n\n1990 is the latest year for which wiretap statistics are available\n[2].  In that year, 872 wiretap installations were requested, and no\nrequests were denied.  (This figure does not include wiretaps obtained\nwith the consent of a party to the conversation.)  2057 arrests\nresulted from wiretaps started the same year, 1486 arrests came from\nwiretaps in previous years, and 55% of arrests led to convictions.\n76% of the wiretaps were for phones (vs pagers, email, etc.), 60% were\nregarding drug offenses, and 40% were requested by federal\nauthorities.  Each wiretap installation heard an average of 1487\ncalls, 22% of them incriminating, among 131 people, and cost an\naverage of $45,125 (extrapolating from the 794 installations\nreporting costs), mostly for labor.\n\nThus a total of about $40 Million was spent on wiretaps, to obtain\nabout 4000 arrests, at $10,000 per arrest.  Thus these arrests are at\nleast four times more expensive than the $2500 per arrest figure one\ngets by dividing the $28 Billion spent by all police nationally by the\ntotal 11 Million non-traffic arrests [3].  Thus the $30 Million per\nyear spent on phone taps is only one thousanth of the total police\nexpenditures.  And if we divide this by the 138 Million phone "access"\nlines in the country [3], we get about 23 cents spent per year per\nphone line, or about two cents a month.\n\nIn general, we deter a given class of criminals through a combination\nof a perceived probability of being caught and convicted, and some\nexpected punishment level if convicted.  So the social value of having\nwiretaps is no more than the amount that we would have to pay to get\nthe same criminal deterrence through other means.  If unable to\nwiretap a particular suspect's phone, police might instead use hidden\nmicrophones, or investigate that suspect in other ways.  Or police\nmight focus on suspects more easily investigated without wiretaps.  Or\nwe might raise the fine or prison time for certain types of crime.\n\nIf we generously assume that these substitutes for wiretaps would be\non average twice as expensive as wiretaps, then the annual social\nbenefit of phone wiretaps is about equal to the current spending level\nof two cents a month per phone line.\n\nWIRETAP COSTS\n\nLet us for the moment optimistically assume that the US government\nencryption scheme is as secure as whatever private enterprise would\nhave offered instead, protecting our conversations from the spying\nears of neighbors, corporations, and governments, both foreign and\ndomestic.  Even so, the need to support wiretaps would add many\nadditional costs to build and maintain our communication system.\n\nExtra law enforcement blocks would be added to phone transmissions,\nincreasing traffic by some unknown percentage.  A special process must\nbe used to add encryption keys to chips, while securely distributing\nthese keys to special agencies, which must be funded and monitored.\nThe chips themselves are designed by a military contractor, whose\ndesign is to remain secret, and are manufactured through a special\nprocess so that the chip becomes nearly impossible to take apart.\n(Chips are now offered at the relatively high price of $30 a peice in\nlots of 10,000 [4].)  Private encryption systems not supporting\nwiretaps would require none of these extra costs.\n\nPerhaps most important, government degree would at least partially\nreplace private marketplace evolution of standards for how voice is to\nbe represented, encrypted, and exchanged in our future phones.  It is\nwidely believed that governments are less efficient than private\nenterprise in procuring products and standards, though they may perhaps\nperform a useful brokering role when we choose between competing private\nstandards.  How much less efficient is a matter of debate, some say\nthey pay twice as much, while others might say only 10% more.    \n\nCurrently, a total of $96 Billion is spent as operating expenses of\nU.S. phone companies [3], which comes out to about $60 per month per\naccess line.  If we compare this to the wiretap value of two cents per\nmonth, we see that if wiretaps raise average operating costs by even\nas much as one part in 3000, then wiretaps are not cost effective!\nAnd this doesn't even include extra costs phone owners pay because\ntheir encryption chips are more expensive.  Of course most phones\nwouldn't have encryption chips for a while, but the wiretap benefit\nper phone is still the same, so this argument still applies.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nGiven this dramatic difference between the total cost of running the\nphone system and the value of wiretaps, we can justify only the\nslightest modification of the phone system to accommodate wiretaps.\nWhen the only modification required was to allow investigators in to\nattach clips to phone wires, wiretap support may have been reasonable.\nBut when we consider substantial modification, the burden of proof is\nclearly on those proposing such modification to show that the costs\nwould really be less than the benefits.  \n\nIf consensus cannot be obtain on this cost/benefit estimate, a\ncompromise might be to tax phones which do not support wiretaps at a\nrate of say five cents per month, a tax payable to police agencies\nnationwide to compensate them for their loss of wiretap abilities.\n\n[1] The Invisible Weapon, Oxford Press, ISBN 0-19-506273-6\n\n[2] Report on Applications for Orders Authorizing or Approving the\n    Interception of Wire, Oral, or Electronic Communications, 1990,\n    Administrative Office of U.S. Courts, Washington, DC 20544.\n\n[3] U.S. Statistical Abstracts, 1992.  \n\n[4] Dorothy Denning, "The Clipper Chip: A Technical Summary",\n    distributed to sci.crypt newsgroup April 21, 1993.
It is completely clear. You have to assume that each byte that was encrypted\nby this 'Clipper Chip' has been compromised. \nSome people wondered, why Denning, Hellman and others did not respond,\nwhen asked what would be done about such compromised phones, or if\ncompromise could not be restricted in time. (I did too) Let us just assume\nthat a) They do not know and b) Those who know don't tell and c)\nThey do not care. It seem's to be an 'Other Person's Problem' ...\n\n gec
At the risk of getting lost in the clipper chip discussion I give a  \nsummary on my recent question:\n\n\nUnfortunately the answer is no - concealing the initialisation vector  \nessentially doesn't give any additional security. I got 3 answers (from  \ngrady@netcom.com, Mark.Lomas@cl.cam.ac.uk, smb@research.att.com) that  \nopened my eyes. It's pretty simple:\n\nSay E is encryption (and D decryption) with key K on 64-bit blocks.\n\nLet c[0] be the initialisation vector,\nm[1], m[2], ... the message blocks,\nc[1], c[2], ... the cipher text blocks.\n\nThen encryption in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode works by the formula\n\n   c[i] = E(m[i] XOR c[i-1]),\n\nand decryption by\n\n   m[i] = c[i-1] XOR D(c[i]).\n\nSo if the attacker doesn't have c[0] this only affects the first message  \nblock m[1]. But she can do her key search attack on m[2], m[3], ...\n\nThe situation in cipher feedback (CFB) mode is a bit more complicated but  \nsimilar and left as an exercise for the reader :-)\n\nFinally there is the modified output feedback mode (OFB) where DES (or  \nwhatever block cipher you use) simply acts as random generator by\n\n   s[i] = E(s[i-1]) with initialisation vector (= seed) s[0],\n\nand encryption is given by\n\n   c[i] = m[i] XOR s[i].\n\nHere the usual `known plaintext' attack against XOR-bitstream ciphers  \nreduces the cracking to key search for K.
I would guess that they won't use Clipper at all.  What they will\ndo is use their STU-IIIs amoung themselves and the governmental agencies\nthey need to talk to, and ignore Clipper.  After all, if it's not secure\nenough for the agency/department they are communicating with why should\nthe coprations trust it?
Yow! Am I ENCRYPTING yet?\n\nDidn't we go over this guns'n'crypto discussion a few months ago? Must\nwe go over it again?
Well, regardless of what policy liabilities anyone in Washington may think\nEFF has, it is going ahead aggressively attacking the assumptions that are\nbehind the Administrations Clipper Chip initiative.  For all the reasons\nstated here.  In Washington, you have to work under the assumption that \neveryone has some liabilities.  Government and non-governmental \norganizations alike all share the same glass house.  EFF is variously\nidentified as the Hacker Defense Fund, the First Amendment Absolutists,\nthe New Communists, etc, but it is also an acknowledged leader in the\ncivil liberties arena and is respected as a serious player in the \npolicy circles.  So unless there is another organization with the\ncredibility and clout and right policy stance that you know of in\nWashington, please don't count EFF out as a valid representative of\nyour views in the Clipper Chip matter.
Please let us know if you get a solid answer to the question of legality\nof other strong cryptosystems.   So far any references I have seen\nhave been weasel-words ("more plans in the future, etc"), but nothing\nthat could be taken as a "NO (strong crypto will NOT be outlawed)".  I\nhave heard (not verified) that the Crime Bill before Congress has\nlanguage that either requires escrow of keys, or that will regard\nall systems 'unapproved' for public use, like strong cryptosystems\nnot trivially broken by the Govt, or without escrowed keys\nwhich one cannot readily change (read: use being only permitted by\nfolks with 'special' connections, or government agencies) as either\n'terrorist tools' or 'drug dealers tools'.  Not outlawed SPECIFICALLY\nbut by added Civil Forfeiture powers, and clever wording, EFFECTIVELY\noutlawed for all intents and purposes.\n\nNow, for some idle speculation ... for those who don't care, hit 'n' now.\n\nCrypto being EFFECTIVELY outlawed could be done without SPECIFICALLY\noutlawing ANY class of crypto systems.  For example, a crowbar, hammers,\nscrewdrivers, and such can be regarded as 'burglar tools' pretty much\nat the whim of the authorities, based primarily on the individual\npossessing them in the car, etc. not being in a trade that makes routine\nuse of these tools.  In a like manner, one who has no 'legitimate need'\n(gov't definition) for strong crypto software or systems, and is caught\nusing them, might find themselves in possession of 'terrorist tools'.\nIn other words, if one is not working for a corporation with extremely\nsensitive commercial data that warrants (in the Fed's opinion) strong\nsecurity, or a government agency, and securing only work-related data,\nnot personal data, one will most likely be nailed on this if discoverd.\nA personal desire for 'privacy' most certainly will not be regarded as\na 'legitimate NEED': \n"Why do you want such strong security, especially from 'legitimate law\nenforcement'? An individual with 'legitimate' endeavors would not be so\nconcerned - government is not in the business of revealing your personal\nsecrets to the public... so you must be trying to conceal or planning\nto conceal some unlawful or criminal activity...  DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING\nTO HIDE, HMMMM?"\nI expect that initially there will be some people selected either at\nrandom, or who happen to have been 'troublemakers' for the purposes of\n'making an example' for those who think the Feds are not SERIOUS about\nthis... (mega ':-('s)\n\nOne asking about a 'right' to privacy will probably get a response that\nthere is no constitutional right for privacy spelled out AS SUCH (an\nargument used in the abortion debate):  "You do NOT have a right to have\nsecurity that 'Legitimate Law Enforcement cannot break'" (as suggested\nin the Clipper Press Release).\n\nThis, in a nutshell, is what I find so extremely frightening.  Not only\nfor crypto systems, as in this case, but for the precident it will set,\nlaying the groundwork for future erosions of privacy (escrow of both\nsafe-deposit box keys - 'master' keys or combinations for privately\nowned safes, and so on.  WHY NOT?)...\n\nI cannot think of a better way to make an 'end-run' around those\n'inconvenient' parts of the US Constitution.  A law cannot be easily\ndeclared unconstitutional, if it there IS NO SPECIFIC LAW.  It would\nsimply be a minor extension of the RICO statutes or WoD policies. A\nsimple policy decision, just like so many of the gun regulations are\nmainly BATF policy decisions...  The Conversation of the Fed agents\nwould go something like:\n\n"We are gonna seize your home, your computers, your car, your bank\naccount, (you don't have to undress and give us yer clothes, unless you\nhave a floppy in yer pocket) because they are all connected with your\nacquisition, transport, and use of 'terrorist tools' and/or 'drug dealers\ntools' - part of the WoD or against terrorism, ya unnerstand... no\ndecent American Subject would be against these noble causes...".\n\n"Note we are not accusing YOU of any wrong-doing ... we are only saying\nyour HOME, COMPUTERS, CAR, BANK ASSETS are connected with wrong-doing\nSOMEHOW - they housed, transported, and funded these 'terrorist tools'.\nOnly a civil matter ...  <heh-heh> ... We had this 'tip'...<grin>".\n\n"Therefore, the Constitutional Protection on Individual rights do NOT\napply - we are 'arresting' the tainted PROPERTY... not YOU...<evil grin>".\n\n"If you wish to deposit a BOND, hire some attorneys, and go to court to\nPROVE the innocence of this property (that they are not 'terrorist tools'\nand again to prove they are not also 'drug dealers tools'), go ahead,\nwe have no problem with that!  'Course, with your bank assets seized,\nno car, computer, or home, (probably no job, too) and your\nless-than-limitless resources, you might run into some minor practical\ndifficulties <grin>...".\n\nTHAT is what has me going so damned ballistic...  It is EXACTLY how\nthe logic goes when someone gives a 'tip' that your home has been\nused to store DRUGS...  Note no trace of drugs need to be found on\nthe property... only some bozo who will say 'yup.  I stored stuff in\nthat dude's house...' (probably to get out of a 10 year sentence for\ndealing).  Much more cost effective to let him walk, to bust another\nday, and hit the jackpot with YOUR assets...\n\nOb Disclaimer (of course)...\n\nOk, note that I am not a lawyer, and can only base these speculations\non what I have read/heard/been told regarding past Civil Forfeiture\ncases, and how they are used to augment the budgets of assorted agencies,\nor to get 'cooperation' of folks who just want to be left alone, or who\ndo not wish to be put in a risky situation (especially in areas where\nthey are denied either meaningful police protection, AND the means to be\nable to even pretend to defend themselves, as is quite common back East,\nlike NJ, MA, NYC, Wa DC, or out West in CA).  These people have the\nchoice of cowering under the government boot, or cowering under threats\nof pissed off drug dealing gang-bangers... helpless in either case...\nAll behind some dude who drops a dime on you for his gain, or behind\nthe Feds wanting to 'make an example'...  Civil Forfeiture being the 'hook'.\n\nPoint is, are these speculations way out of line, or are they all too\ntypical, and if so, does the extension to crypto and just about anything\nthat the Feds regard as 'inconvenient' seem reasonable?  And if not\nwhy not (what are our guarantees, besides the government promises)?\n\nNONE?
Let's put it this way, they have a charter and several executive orders\nto obey, among other things which *explicitly* prohibit sharing this\ninformation (unless things have changed withing the last little while).\nI suppose they could ignore it, if they choose.  But I doubt they would.\nFor an authoritative look at the NSA, get Bamford's "The Puzzle Palace".\nThat's all I can say.
I believe it is illegal to send any cryptographic code out of the country\nwithout an export license. (Others will correct me if this is inaccurate.)\n\nDunno if you'd get one for the particular code you have; the only way to\nfind out is to apply for a license.\n\nNote that you need to distinguish between what is legal to send to Canada if\nYOU have such a license, and what is legal to send if you don't.

There is an article in Communications Week (April 12's issue) which\nstates definitively that not only is the justice department trying to revive\nthe "wiretapping bill", but they are ALSO trying to find a way to force key\nregistration.

Read it and get peeved folks.\nThen ACT NOW or lose your fundamental right to privacy.\n\nClinton has shown us that his only interest in this has to do with abortion,\nand not the right of all citizens to be secure in their papers and effects.
I don't believe you, and I don't believe your friend.\n\nWhy? \n\nBecause DES is not known to have any known plaintext attacks readily\navailble. Unless your friend knows something and is keeping it secret,\nhe was bullshitting you.\n\nNow, it IS possible that he noted a weakness in the *implementation* of\nthe Kerberos protocol. For instance, using a weak RNG to generate keys\nmight cut down on the keyspace (not for the user keys -- for the other\nkind who's name I can't remember). However, this is not what was\nclaimed. You are claiming a general weakness in DES, which is not\nknown to exist in the open literature.\n\nDon't get me wrong -- DES is weaker than it should be. However,\ncracking it in 15 minutes requires more money be spent on the cracking\nmachine than ANY organization I know of has available.\n\n--\nPerry Metzger		pmetzger@shearson.com

Don Alvarez posted a good partial solution to this problem to\ncomp.risks.  I'll present my variant on it instead, since I feel it's a\nbit stronger against some likely attempts to cheat.  depends on the\nprotocol that's followed for reading traffic.  Briefly, the cops get a\nwiretap warrant, and record the call.  They then notice the encryption\nand the disclosure header.  It, along with a copy of their warrant, is\nsent to the FBI, or whoever it is who holds the family key.  The\nF-holder decrypts the header, and sends the serial number N and the\nencrypted session key U[K] to the escrow agents.  They, in turn, use U1\nand U2 to recover K, and send that to the local police.\n\nNote how this solves the problem of wiretapping forever.  Neither the\ncops nor the FBI ever see U, so they can't read other traffic.  Every\nrequest must be validated by both the FBI and the escrow agents.  The\ncops and the FBI together can't cheat, since they don't have U.  (I\nregard that as a likely pairing of folks who might try to beat the\nsystem.  It's to prevent this that I modified Alvarez's scheme.)  The\nescrow agents can't read the conversation, since they don't have it;\nall they have is N and U[K].  And the police don't even see N.
Why not?  It hasn't been released, so there's no way for you to evaluate it \nyet.  After all, Apple could have been smart and had AOCE use an MD5 hash \nencrypted with RSA, just like PKCS signatures.  They could even be actually \nPKCS compliant, for all you know; why not wait until it is released, and hard \ninformation is available, before passing judgement on it?\n\nAOCE's algorithm's aren't secret because Apple's being fascistic--AOCE itself \nremains secret (except for Apple demos at MacWorld :)), simply because it's \nnot done yet.\n\nIt may be flawed, and it may not.  However, you can't tell which until you \nactually see it.  I, at least, am quite impressed with what I have seen so \nfar, and have no expectation of being disappointed.
I've already written a 5000 char commentary (from my MCI MAIL account, so I\ncan't be accused of being a "hacker".)
You can find what you're looking for on hundreds of sites worldwide.  Try\n\n	anonymous ftp to nic.funet.fi (Finland)\n\n	/pub/unix/4.3bsd/net2/lib/libc/gen/crypt.c.Z\n\nThis includes source code for fully-functional DES encryption and decryption.\n\nThere are some who believe that public domain code is exportable, some\nwho don't.  Make your own judgements, but it seems obvious to me.
Better, I think, is our right peacably to assemble.  I have a right to meet\nyou in a park and talk privately.  I have a right to see if anyone is\nnearby, listening.\n\nIn cyberspace, cryptography gives us a right to assemble with control over\nwho overhears us.
A circut court judge in Illinois once said "When dealing with a government\nthat seeks continually new and more creative ways to spy on its' citizenry,\none cannot discourage the move to empower the common citizen with the means\nto parry this attack on personal privacy."\n\n(Unfortunately the comment was with regard to the banning of radar\ndetectors....)\n\nThe point remains.  More and more I see the government slowly washing\naway privacy.  Even unwittingly.  Do you think I will ever live in a\nsoceity that issues smart cards to citizens at birth?  Do you think I\nwill live in a soceity that insists I register my crypto keys so they\ncan keep track of what I'm saying?  Even if there is no evidence of my\nguilt?  Do you think I will ever live in a soceity that seeks to meddle\nin the affairs of its' citizenry without recourse of any kind?  I'm tired\nof it.  There is (IMHO) no compromise with an administration that seeks\nto implement these proposals under the guise of enhancing privacy.\n\nMore than the proposals themselves, I read the language of the press\nreleases, the obvious deception involved in presenting these pieces to\nthe public, and I am sickened.  I am revolted.  I am repulsed.\n\n90%, perhaps even 95% of this country could care less about the\nclipper chip, the wiretap bill, the smart card, because they are so\nentrapped in the rhetoric of the Clinton Administration.\n\nThis saddens and frightens me.\n\nI am a conserveative believe it or not.  A law and order conserveative.\nBut the move to a centralized authoratarian regime really scares me,\nmostly because I know you cant go far wrong underestimating the\nintelligence of the American people.  Tell them it's going to keep\nthem safe from drug dealers and terrorists, and they will let you\nput cameras in their home.\n\nEven in the wake of Waco, you find those who support the increasingly\ntotalatarian moves.\n\n\nTo be quite honest, the way things are going, I'd call it self defense.\n\n\n\nAnd I dont want mine growning up in the eyes of a security camera\n24 hours a day.\n\nuni
[ ... ]\n\n\n\n[ ... ]\n\n\nOne very interesting thing I notice about this is that the only use of\nthe chip key is to encode the session key for the law enforcement field.\nIt is not used at all by the encryption algorithm.\n\nIt seems like it would be possible to create a device that would be\notherwise compatible, but would send out a bogus law enforcement field.\nThis might render the device unusable with "normal" devices if there's\nsome sort of validation involving the law enforcement field, but it\ncould certainly be used with other such modified devices.\n\nOf course, this is irrelevant if the NSA has a backdoor in the\nalgorithm, but it does make it possible to defeat the key escrow system.

Exactly what would that show, ?! the "law enforcement block" is easy to\ncreate, given the Government key and any serial number. \n\n\n*IF* it comes to trail about the wiretap.... ya, some safegaurd that is.\nWhat if they just harass people as a result, or learn things they shouldn't\nhave learned, etc? \n\n\nThe whole point of the Escrow system is to prevent the FBI from making \nillegal wiretaps. Why not have the FBI holds the\nkeys and that's it? Why do we need the escrow system at all?\n\nUnless a 3rd party (a judge) verifies that the requested serial number\nis "right", and the FBI can get any key they like at anytime, the escrow\nsystem is useless.

I just posted this reply to comp.risks (answering RISKS DIGEST 14.53).\nSummary: Re: [14.53 Mark Seecof] "key escrow"\n\n\n\nIt is tempting (albeit chauvinistic) to believe that we have a new situation\nhere, thanks to our pet computers.  This is not true.  David Kahn's "The\nCodebreakers", a history of cryptography, makes two things obvious:\n\n1.	Cryptography is a spontaneous invention of private human individuals\n	and has been going on for thousands of years.  [Teen-age slang and\n	cipher inventions provide a modern example of this spontaneous\n	creation.]\n\n2.	The systems people created on their own were roughly as secure as (and\n	sometimes more secure than) those used by military and diplomatic\n	users *of that time* (although they seem very simple and insecure\n	today). [e.g., In places, the Bible used a more complex simple\n	substitution than Caesar did for his military dispatches, but before\n	Caesar.]\n\nI commend Kahn's book to all who might be interested.
Dear Senator/Congressman/President {fill in the blank}\n\nI am writing you to voice my strong opposition to President Clinton's Clipper \nChip initiative. This proposal to establish a secret government designed\ncryptography chip with government key registration as the standard for voice\nencryption is very disturbing. The idea that citizens must register their \nsecrets with the government just in case they are trying to keep them secret \nis patently unAmerican. Additionally, the press release for this program\nstrongly implied that other forms of cryptography would be banned after the \nClipper Chip standard is in place. This latest attack on our civil rights is \ndeeply disturbing and is frankly a voting issue for me. \n\nThe presidents press release stated that the plan strikes a balance between the\nlegitimate needs of law enforcement and a citizens right to privacy but this \nis not the case. The fact is that since other strong cryptographic equipment \nis avalible the criminals, drug dealers and terrorists mentioned in the press \nrelease will simply use non clipper cryptography. Meanwhile the average citizen\nmay gain no protection against warentless wiretaps by the government since the \ngovernment escrowed key is derived deterministicly from the unit serial number\nwhich is broadcast by the chip durring its opperation. This seems like an \nobvious back door for the NSA and law enforcement. If you still do nott \nunderstand my objection to key registration, consider the way J. Edgar Hoover \nblackmailed government officials like yourself; would you now use a phone to \ntransmit personal details of your life that the NSA and FBI have the keys to?\n\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\nWell heres a letter, I didnt spell check it since I dont know how in EMACS\nso you might want to do that.
[excellent and helpful list deleted] \n\n\n  Wes's list is of "do"s and "don't"s for writing your Congressional\nrepresentatives is a fine one but I'd like to encourage people to pay\nextra attention to the point above.  As cliched as the saying may be\nit's nevertheless true that you can catch more flies with honey than\nwith vinegar.\n\n  While the writing styles prevalent on the net possess a certain charm\nplease remember that the person reading your letter is likely to be\nuninfluenced or negatively influenced if you express your concerns in\na way that makes you sound like a flake or a paranoid crackpot.  Wild\nand unsupported accusations about the menace from the NSA will not\ncarry much weight, nor are overblown conclusions about the inevitable\nconsequences of the proposal likely to convince (especially not ones\nthat attempt strained analogies to the rise of the Nazi party.  Please\nsave the Niemoller quote for another letter..)\n\n  If you want your opinions to be taken seriously it is *very* important\nthat you state those opinions in a manner that is understandable and \nseems reasonable to a layman.  Don't overburden your reader with technical\ndetails or expect them to know the history of various encryption \ntechnologies.  Before you mail it, hand your letter to a non-technical\nfriend and ask them to sanity-check it.\n\n  Above all, realize that legislators are often motivated as much by\nself-interest as by anything else.  Try to point out risks in terms that\nwill be meaningful and motivating to them such as the loss of individual\nprivacy rights or the damage restrictive export regulations do to American\nbusinesses' ability to compete in the global marketplace.  Pull the \nstrings that you think will work with your legislator -- if your\nlegislator is unlikely to be swayed by civil-rights concerns then point out\nhow a government-granted monopoly for Mycotronx damages the competitiveness\nof businesses in your district that manufacture or market phone or crypto\ntechnology.
Argh. This is what I get for acknowledging David Sternlight's existence.\n\n\nOkay, it looks like I am going to have to do the history lesson after all.\n\nDuring the Vietnam war, there were a great many citizens opposed to it\nwho considered themselves perfectly law abiding, although Mr. Nixon and\nhis lackeys thought otherwise.\n\nThe Federal government had no compunction about adding "people who\nare otherwise decent, law abiding and upstanding, but disagree with\nus" to your nice little list. Do you think this could never happen\nagain?\n\nNote that I am not speculating about what the government could do,\nbut discussing the sort of "observation" - including but not limited\nto phone tapping - that the government put its citizens under during\na time of national tension.\n\nYour naivete is still appalling, BTW. I mean, read what you posted again.\nHow are we to differentiate between Good People and Bad People? Answer:\nA priori, we can't; we have to assume. Now, which way do we assume?

One of the things that's\nsupposedly great about America is the freedoms enjoyed by citizens who\nare presumed to be law-abiding until proven otherwise.\n--
nobody@alumni.cco.caltech.edu correctly states Jerry Berman's 1985 view on\nprivacy, but he mistakenly assumes that this represents Berman's 1993 view as\nEFF Executive Director.\n\nAs one of the people who convinced Jerry that legal protections for privacy\nare insufficient, and that technical measures, especially public key\ncryptography, are also vitally necessary, I can tell you that Jerry and EFF\nare fully committed to this position.\n\nThe previous poster is apparently unaware of a long series of EFF positions in\nsupport of this view.  I suggest those interested read EFF's position on\nClipper or our other work in digital privacy.

For purposes of this\nmessage, how do we know "psionic" isn't?\n\nI don't suggest that, but post this to point out that there is a class of\nspeculation that has no more truth value, without lots of hard evidence,\nthan the contrary one.\n\nBy the way, if "psionic" had said, in lower case letters, that the firm\nCLAIMS there was no back door, I'd have no problem with that phrasing.\n\nDavid
True, but the basic idea behind any communications security system is not\nto absolutely deny access, but to make access more expensive (in time,\nmoney, manpower) than it is worth.

It's not a question just of who is holding the phone.  It's a question of\nwhat circuit to wiretap in the first place.  If two drug dealers are both\nusing stolen cellular phones, the FBI doesn't know which lines to tap\n-- unless of course they're tapping *all* phones (maybe *all* cellular\nphones).  If they haven't tapped the connection (ie., at least one end of\nthe connection) then they don't know what key to request.

I am both new to this news group and to the net.\n        \n        I am facinated by the things I have heard about the PGP\nencryption program.  Does anybody out there know where I might get a\nversion of this program that runs under Windows 3.1, MS-Dos, Unix\nw/source?  As of this writting I have no UNIX access and am running on a\nnifty windows implamentation of uucico.\n        Thanks in advance!
Yes -- great chapter.  Elizabeth Friedman (sp?) comes shining through.\n\nHowever, the chapter also notes that these rum runners invented their own\ncrypto -- hired ex-military folks, in fact.  (How's that for a revolving\ndoor?)\n\nNow, given that today's rum runners (coke runners, actually) have even more\nmoney than yesterday's, it's reasonable to expect them to have even better\ncryptography.  I doubt they have a chip foundry of their own yet, but ....\n\nSo, my question of the FBI/NIST/NSA is: "How are you going to make the rum\nrunners use the Clipper Chip?"\n\nAnswer:  	you're not.\n\nQuestion:	OK -- in that case, your justification for taking away our\n		rights has evaporated.  How do you justify our loss of rights\n		if you can't use the drug dealers and terrorists?

That was probably me.\nI meant only that nobody has overreacted yet.  It seemed to me that\nJerry was suggesting that people are currently overreacting, and I \nvehemently disagree.  I see a lot of talk, but not much action.\nI see now that I misunderstood Jerry's position.\n\n\nNot this bunch.  They'll just bitch on the Net for a while, and \nthen go back to lurking.\n\n\nActually, it's not quite that bad, but it's close.\n\nLook, we (collectively) have the power to throw the bums out, but we\ndon't use it.  We clearly don't need to go burning things down, but we\nclearly do need to throw at least some of the bums out.\nUnfortunately, the bums have learned to target only small groups of\npeople at a single time, so the masses won't react and throw them out.\nEventually, the masses will react, unless the bums cease their\nrelentless encroachment on liberty and despoilment of the economy.\nThe sooner it happens, the less the damages will be.  I don't want to\nlive in a war zone, either -- I want to see the bums thrown out before\nthey do some *real* damage.
I just signed up for this group, so I hope I'm not missing something\nin a FAQ, but I'm looking for a good introduction to the mathematics\nof encryption -- particularly DES and Public-Key, though others would\nbe interesting also.  Probably a good library could help me out, but I\nthought it might be even easier if I could obtain a nice article\nentirely electronically (besides, I have this rather *rational* phobia\nof libraries for reasons stemming from this "dissertation" thing\nhanging over my head :-)).  \n	I have a basic knowledge of mathematics... number-theory is a\nbit unfamiliar to me, but I've had a few graduate-level math courses\nin some other areas; anyway, I'm not a complete novice to the field.\nSo probably something aimed at a basic graduate introductory level\nwould be about right.  Something, anyway, which is more specific than\n"a really big prime number is generated to code the message".\n	If someone knows of a good text available by ftp (or gopher),\nor would like to email me one... please let me know.  I'll probably keep\nreading this group; but it would be nice if you would email me at the\nsame time, so I don't miss it.\n\nThanx, Lulu...
Taking this at face value (though it seems quite dissonant with much else\nthat has been published here about brute force DES cracking, unless Russell\nwas lucky with respect to the key), I'd be very interested in whether the\nprogram Russell used is available? In whether he used a cleartext\nrecognition algorithm in the program or whether he had to examine each\ndecryption by hand? In whether he used a known plaintext attack?\n\nHe probably should also tell us, given his address, what machine he used--a\ndesktop, workstation, or super-computer.\n\nDepending on his answer, this could be an appalling development calling into\nquestion both DES and RSA/DES. Dunno about RSA/IDEA.\n\nIf any bright programmer with a little idle machine time can crack a single\nDES message in a couple of days (assuming no tricks that are\nmessage-specific), then here's my Clipper key, NSA; give me the chip at\nonce.  :-)\n\nDavid
Now THAT makes sense.  But the other half must be in a non-government\nescrow.  (I still like EFF, but I admin their security has not been\ntested.)
I can think of a couple of ways of guaranteeing authenticity in a one-time\npad encrytped scheme, though I'm not sure how to prove that what kind of\nauthenicity they provide.\n \n   An obvious first-attempt might be to prepend a truly random (unpredictable\nfor Eve) block to the message, and then calculate a CRC which included the\nrandom starting block and all of the message.  This could be encrypted after\nthe message.  The problem is, I'm not sure it's impossible to come up with\na message that will hash to the same CRC regardless of the random starting\nblock.  (It intuitively seems like it ought to be hard, but I'm not *that*\nsure....)  Clearly, a crypto-strength hash like MD5 or the SHA would be\nstronger, but again, I'm not sure I'm comfortable claiming that it's\nunbreakable.\n \n   A scheme to use up some of the pad bits to decide how many bits of 0's\nto include in the plaintext stream before going on wouldn't be too bad,\neither.  At the cost of increasing the speed with which you use up your\npad, this could be used to give you arbitrarily low probability that your\nopponent could spoof a valid-looking message, since any deciphered plaintext\nin a spot that should be carrying 0's will show that something funny's going\non.\n \n   If, for each message bit M_i, we used up one random bit, R_i, to decide\nwhether to insert a 0 into the plaintext stream, we'd get a total pad use\nof 2.5 times the message length.  (We'd expand the message size by about\nhalf.)  Each 0 that should appear in the plaintext stream that doesn't is a\nguess for our would-be spoofer.  At each bit, she has to guess.  I'm trying\nto see how to quantify her chances of making it all the way through the\nspoofed message, but it gets a little complicated, because she can get un-\nsynched, and still happen to have a 0 in that place in the spoofed message.\n \n   Now, I can see a simple way of doing this that's got to be as secure\nas a one-time pad, at a cost of using 4 times the message length in pad bits.\n \n   For each message bit, M_i, use one random bit, R_i, and xor them together\nto get X_i.  Now, encrypt the three bits with the one-time pad.  The enemy\nhas no way of guessing what R_i is, so he/she can't guess what X_i is, either.\nAny change she makes in the ciphertext stream will have to involve a guess\nof what R_i was.  Is there any way to do this without using so many pad bits?\n \n   Spoofing the message is equivalent to correctly guessing as many random\nbits as there are bits in the message.  Clearly, this makes spoofing messages\njust as hard if you know the whole message text as if you know none of it.\nIn fact, it looks to me like this makes it just as hard to generate a spoofed\nmessage with the ciphertext as without it, but I'm not entirely sure about\nthat.\n \n   Is there an easier way of doing this that's provably as secure as the\none-time pad?
O.K.- if you've read this group for a while, you know all about the\none-time-pad, but here's a question I haven't seen.\n\nThe one-time-pad yeilds ideal security, but has a well-known flaw in\nauthentication.  Suppose you use a random bit stream as the pad, and\nexclusive-or as the encryption operation.  If an adversary knows the \nplaintext of a message, he can change it into any other message.  \nHere's how it works.\n\nAlice is sending Bob a plaintext P, under a key stream S\nAlice computes the ciphertext C = S xor P,  and sends it to Bob.\n\nEve knows the plainext P, but wants the message to appear as P'.\nEve intercepts C, and computes  C' = C xor P xor P' = S xor P'.\nEve sends C' to Bob.\n\nBob decrypts C' by computing  C'xor S = P',  thus receiving the \nfalse message which was substituted by Eve.\n\n\nNow the question is how can this attack be defeated with information\ntheoretic security, not just computational security.\nCan we define something like "ideal authentication" which is the\nanalog of ideal security.  Can we obtain ideal authentication ?\n\nIf not, how much can we limit Eve's control over the message ?\n\nIf we can achieve ideal authentication, does the solution use more\nkey bits or expand the message ?  Can we show the solution to be\noptimal in one or more parameters ?\n\nDoes anyone know if these questions have been aswered before ?
Yeah, but who wants to start a pool on the first person arrested\nmistakenly and has their life turned upside-down because some law\nenforcement agency *does* make a chip::person association?\n\nI wonder if there are any plans to keep these records (e.g. encode the\nserial number into the UPC scanned at K-Mart along with the credit\ncard info, voila.)\n\nAt least your phone number tends to only locate to your house or\nwhatever (i.e. to be coming from your telephone number the person\nlikely is in your house etc.), plus or minus some shenanigans of\ncourse.\n\nBut I'd hate to think of these guys getting the clipper id, recording\nthe conversation, then doing a quick cross-lookup and your name comes\nup as owner of that id (mistakenly, maybe you sold the phone at a\ngarage sale or the phone was stolen from your car or whatever.) They\nmight only know who one side of the conversation is, for example.\n\nAnyone who thinks the govt is forbidden by law to cross-correlate such\ndatabases loses two points. First, law enforcement agencies can of\ncourse do this. Second, they're only forbidden from BUDGETING any\nmoney for it. The IRS, for example, does do this anyhow. They just\ndon't spend any money on it so it's (technically) legal I guess.\n\nInstead they probably trade little favors with companies like\nmastercard (if you're the IRS I'll bet you have a *lot* of\nopportunities to trade favors with major corps for their databases.)\n\nI know, an IRS guy read an amazing list off to me (from his screen, I\ncould hear him typing to pull up each screen) once on the phone during\na dispute I had with them (to intimidate me, actually, not much of a\ndispute, I didn't particularly disagree, but for some reason this\nfellow wanted to play tough guy with me, I hope he's better now.)\n\nAmazing stuff he had at his finger tips. Be afraid.\n\n-- \n        -Barry Shein

>> conference calls?\n   >It's not Clipper, it's any encryption system.  I've seen a number of\n   >designs; they generally involve a multi-line cleartext bridge.\n\n	   A 'multi-line cleartext bridge?"\n			 ^^^^^^^^^\n	   And just were would you put that bridge?  If it isn't at one of\n   the receiptants location, forget encryption at all.  You have blown any\n   security you thought you might have had. \n\nMost of the people using encrypted conference bridges these days are\nmilitary (or equivalent, like CIA and other embassy personnel),\nso putting bridges on the recipient's location is normal -\nit's in a vault on a military base or Ft. Meade, and the\nsecure phones are in sound-proof rooms with big locks on the doors\nbecause they're talking about Classified Stuff (or Golf with Other Generals.)\n\nThat paradigm will change as we start using encrypted phones in our\noffices or homes to carry on normal conversations about dinner plans\nand stock purchases and meeting schedules and technical info\nand the good batch of illegal frop that we got last weekend from Bob;\nmost people don't use sound-proof vaults, and may use bridges in their\nPBX or from the local phone company (3-way calls) or Long Distance\nor value-added phone company (e.g. Alliance conference bridges).\n\nIf Clipjack is mainly used for the radio portion of cellular phones,\nthe conferencing aspects don't change.  But there may be a market niche for\ntrusted conference-bridge providers, though I suppose the inquisitors\nwould try to get a blanket wiretap authorization for many bridges,\njust in case a Bad Guy might use the service.
The Shannon limit for voice lines is likely somewhere around 25kbps.\nWe are rapidly approaching it. The fastest affordable full-duplex\nmodems currently on the market are V32bis, which is 14400bps.\n\n\nCELP manages to sound decent at 4800 bps.\n\nIn theory, if you built a speech recognition system that turned voice\ninto ASCII, and a perfect synthesis system on the other end that\nsounded just like the person you were speaking to, you could get it\ndown to the information content of the speech.\n\nWith various kinds of LPC, you can get it down to 2400 bps or prehaps\neven less, at which point it sounds horrible.\n\n4800 bps is more than adequite for our purposes.\n\n--\nPerry Metzger		pmetzger@shearson.com

I posted an informational request about any electronically available\narticles on cryptographic algorithms a couple of days ago.  As I\nmentioned, I was interested, in particular, in DES and Public-Key --\nbut also wouldn't mind learning about others.  As I said, I can read\nan intro-graduate level text book, having had some mathematics, though\nnot much number-theory per se.  I'd like to see the technical details\nof the mathematics of cryptography, as oppossed to the popularizations\nof things like _scientific am_ which just say, "then you find a\n*really* big prime number....".\n\nFollowing my request, several people were so kind as to suggest\nreading-lists, which I hope to get around to.  Two other people were\nso *very* kind as to send large documents, which I presume were actual\narticles (about 1000 lines each); but I've stupidly deleted them\naccidentally before having a chance even to skim them.  If they can\nforgive me for my careless use of file-commands, would the original\nsenders be so kind as to resend? Or anyone else who has good\ncrypto-articles at a fairly technical mathematical level? Also,\nftp-able or gopher-able docs would be nice to know about.\n\nYours, Lulu...

But the NSA will not be doing any wiretapping.  The actual wiretapping will,\npresumably, be conducted by the FBI.  Of course, the capability for this was\nprovided by the NSA, but I think that they are still within the limitations\nof their charter.\n\nI realize this is a fine point, and some may differ, but this is my opinion.\nAlthough I don't care for Clipper and won't support or use it, I don't see\nthe NSA as having overstepped their bounds.\n\nDavid R.

I want to add link encryption to a module that multiplexes upper\nlevel routines into a single data link. The upper levels won't know\nabout this, and thus key exchange shall only need to occur once (at\nthe initial link establishment). I figure that I can do this with\nDES and a Diffie-Hellman key exchange.\n\nIs using a Diffie-Hellman exchange to establish a 64 bit DES key\nacceptable, in other words, what are the pro's and con's of such a \nsetup? Are there any important issues to watch out for (aside from\nfiltering out unacceptable keys)?\n\nAnd in order to achieve this, I guess I will need to use 64bit math\nroutines (for probable prime number calculation, exponentiation etc),\nso could someone point me towards a good package (this is strictly\nnon-commercial).\n\nMatthew.
I am aware of the restrictions imposed by the munitions act\n   on the export of cryptographic technology, however, is it illegal to\n   transmit encrypted data from the U.S. to another country?  If so,\n   then which laws apply to this situation?\n\nFrom the US law perspective, unless you're engaging in illegal speech,\nit's not illegal to use encryption.  Yet.  The NSA is allowed to try\nto listen, but you're not obligated to make it easy for them.  Yet.\nThe other country may have more repressive laws about that;\nI gather France's bureaucracy wants to know what you're saying, \nand in the old Soviet Union, they didn't need laws to make things illegal :-(\n\n(paranoia follows, for those of you who want to play it safe :-)\nThe fact that the NSA is listening may affect your willingness to use\nwimpy crypto technologies, but it may also affect your willingness to\nuse technologies that violate RSA's patents, e.g. if you use PGP, the\nNSA may tell RSA that you're doing so, and if the Secret Service catches on,\nthey may decide that the mere fact that RSA hasn't filed a lawsuit\nagainst you doesn't mean that you don't deserve to have your computer\nconfiscated for possible patent violation, munitions law violation,\nespionage, money laundering, drug importation, and creatin' a disturbance,\nand then not give it back because you *did* violate the patent even\nthough they had to drop all the other charges, unlike that nasty Steve\nJackson who had the gall not to be guilty of *anything*.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\n\n\n[...]\n[...]\n\n\n\nAs far as I can see, no matter how the session keys are generated (be it\nDiffie-Hellman or whatever), any Cripple conversation which travels in\nwhole or in part over a land-line is vulnerable to this scheme.  Law-\nenforcement agencies can do it legally at the telco, or illegally by finding\nsome part of the phone line that they can cut into.  The degree of risk\ndepends very much on location - not good in the middle of a busy street,\nbut not bad on a line in open country (leading to a drug lord's ranch).  The\nonly way to defeat it would be if your phone had the equivalent of a public\nkey indexed against phone number for every phone you might want to call (all\nof them) - totally impractical, even if some part of the Cripple algorithm\ncould be used as a kind of public key (I don't understand enough about these\nthings to know).\n\nThis sort of encryption scheme is only really workable over a radio link,\nand even then you could probably interevene without causing problems for\nother phones nearby if you were physically close to the target phone.\n\nGosh, yet another way to get round Cripple encryption.

This is a real address.

celular phones...........
You're blowing smoke.  Qualcomm wants to sell to nice, lucrative overseas\nmarkets like Japan and the EC.  The government told them "don't do encryption\nif you ever hope to export this technology".  The reason that CDMA doesn't\nhave encryption is NOT because the G-men came a'knocking at Qualcomm's door.\nIt's because Qualcomm doesn't think that the US market for digital cellular\nis big enough for them.  This is just the International Traffic in Arms\nRegulations all over again.\n\nIf you don't believe me, call Qualcomm and ASK THEM.  Don't just throw\nout conspicracy theories.  At least, don't do it on sci.crypt--there are\nwhole other newsgroups devoted to this kind of uninformed claptrap.\n\n\nHah.  They're not that much more expensive.  Besides, if a drug dealer\ncan afford a Rolex and a Mercedes, he can darn well afford Cylink phones.\nNo, Cylink sells their phones because they're willing to make different\nstuff for domestic use vs. export.  Qualcomm isn't.  So Cylink makes\nmoney--that's capitalism, comrade.\n\n\n"Someone" this and "someone" that.  If you think it's so easy, why are\nyou whining on the net instead of getting your butt in gear and writing\nit?  Your name would become known and loved by dozens!

...\n\nWell, lets for a hypothetical put our selves in the place of the US end\nof the drug rings. What do we do about the Cripple chip? First off, we\nwould express disaproval to our congress critters, and remind them of the\nlarge sums of money our legitimate co.s provide to their campain coffers. We\nwould also let them know via the 'other' channels that a) their income is about\nto take a hit, and b) their health may not be too good either.\n\nBut just in case, the next obvious step to take is to BUY Mycotoxic and VLSI!\nYeah, free enterprise at work. :-) Now they have the Cripple in their pockets,\nliteraly as well as figurativly.

I tried this code yesterday.  On my Sparcstation ELC it takes over\n300 seconds to compress 22 seconds' worth of speech.  This means that it\nneeds to be "optimized" by over a factor of 10 before it will be usable\nin even a half-duplex mode.\n\nI question whether CELP is the best approach for this application.  It produces\ngreat compression but at the expense of tremendous CPU loads.  We want\nsomething that can be run on ordinary workstations or even high-end PC's\nwithout DSP cards.  My guess is that some other algorithm is going to be\na better starting point.
From article <67@cyberia.win.net>, by johnston@cyberia.win.net (Robert Johnston):\n\nHmmm... I wouldn't consider encryption to be a weapon.  How would the\ngovernment classify encryption?  Seems to me that encryption ought to\nbe covered by the first amendment.   Using this line of reasoning, the\ngovernment shouldn't be able to restrict what data people encrypt and\nwhat encryption algorithms they use because this would be restricting\none's freedom of speech.  In other words, encrypted data---text,\ngraphics, or other information---is just another form of free speech.\nFor this reason the government shouldn't be able to regulate the use\nof encryption algorithms and encrypted data.  The only time the\ngovernment should be able to 'force' someone to reveal his or her\nencryption keys for some encrypted data is when the encrypted data\nin question may be something that isn't protected by the first\namendment such as kiddy porn.  Even in a case like this the\ngovernment should be required to get a search warrant before coercing\nsomeone into revealing the keys.\n\nBTW, what encryption methods are considered to be state-of-the-art\nnowdays.  Have the feds relaxed export restrictions on DES yet?\nAlso, is DES still regarded as a good form of encryption?\n\n\n\nScott Kennedy,  Brewer and Patriot\n\nBefore:  "David Koresh is a cheap thug who interprets\n          the Bible through the barrel of a gun..."  --ATF spokesman\nAfter:   "[The ATF] is a cheap thug who interprets\n          [the Constitution] through the barrel of a gun..."  --Me
Ever since Craig Rowland posted his piece "New Encryption"\nto sci.crypt there has been some discussion of our company,\nSecured Communications Technologies, Inc, and on encryption\nalgorithm, NEA.\n     I spoke to Craig at length on 4/21/93 and we covered a lot\nof ground.  Some of the information in the posting requires some\nclarification, and I would like to answer some of the questions\nraised on sci.crypt.\n     SCT is a small company based in Silver Spring Maryland.  Our\ntwo main products at this time are a PC based secure\ncommunications program called SECOM and a general purpose\nencryption chip which uses the NEA algorithm developed for SECOM.\n     SECOM provides an encrypted secure communication link\nbetween two PC's connected over dial up telephone lines.  It\nsupports simultaneous bi-directional file transfer and keyboard\nto screen "chat".  It has its own proprietary communications\nprotocol which is tightly integrated to the encryption.  All\nthough it is a packetized link, the data stream appears to be\ncontinuous because the packet boundaries are hidden.\n     When SECOM was initially developed, it was implemented to\nuse DES encryption.  A business decision was made to seek export\napproval for the product because it was perceived that the\noverseas market was a large one and provided a good marketing\nopportunity.\n     We soon found out that we would NEVER be granted general\nexport approval for anything using DES.  All though the reason\nfor this was never explicitly stated, it seems to have something\nto do with secret government to government agreements which are\nstill in effect.\n     In any event, the decision was made to develop a new and\ndifferent algorithm which would take the place of DES.  This was\nthe reason NEA (New Encryption Algorithm) was born.\n     At this time NEA is being held as a trade secret.  The\npreliminary work of patenting it has begun, and the plan is to\nmake it public once the patent process is complete.  All though\none can make certain legal arguments for keeping it an ongoing\nsecret, I think in the case of an encryption algorithm it is\nnecessary to let people "shoot at it" over an extended period of\ntime to prove its worth.\n     In order to get export approval for SECOM/NEA, it was\nnecessary to go through NSA and to reveal to them the details of\nthe program and algorithm.  This was done only AFTER we had a\nfinished product to submit.\n     Let me state unequivocally that there is NO "back door" to\nthe program or the algorithm.  Secured Communications\nTechnologies is a closely held private company and\nNSA/FBI/CIA/NIST/WHATEVER has NO financial interest in any way\nwhatsoever with the company or any of the people involved.\n     From a practical business standpoint, we are interested in\nselling chips and software (hopefully in large quantities) and a\nback door to the encryption, if found out, could destroy our\ncredibility and our business.\n     With the encryption algorithm approved for export, we set\nout to talk to a number of potential customers for encryption\nproducts and systems.  We were able to identify several common\nthreads of functionality requirements.  This led to the design of\na chip with the encryption algorithm "cast in silicon" and\ncertain other capabilities added so that the chip could fulfill\nthe broad range of requirements that we identified.\n     We are strongly opposed to the clipper/capstone chips.  In a\npress release today, our president, Dr. Stephen Bryen stated:\n\n          "It seems as if the government has an unlimited source\n     of funds to use to push its new bugged chips on the American\n     Public.  But do we not understand how the National Security\n     Agency, which is not supposed to be involved in domestic\n     spying, can fund the development of a commercial chip\n     intended to accommodate U.S. government domestic spying\n     activities."
Hello,\n\nhow sensible is DES encrypted data towards bit errors? How much data per\nbit will be lost in average (I assume you still have the correct key)?\n\nThanx for hints,\nAxel\n\n---\nExperience is what you get if you don't get what you want...
This is factually incorrect. There was at least one message that said that\nWaco and Clipper justified "anything" in response.\n\nDavid
Thanks. Got that from two other sources as well. The full quote is as\nfollows:\n\nFrom Dorothy Denning, CRYPTOGRAPHY AND DATA SECURITY, Addison-Wesley\n1982,1983, page 8:\n\n"Cryptosystems must satisfy three general requirements:\n\n"1. The enciphering and deciphering transformations must be efficient for\nall keys.\n\n"2. The system must be easy to use.\n\n"3. The security of the system should depend only on the secrecy of the\nkeys and not on the secrecy of algorithms E [enciphering] or D\n[deciphering]."\n\n\n\n--Mike

Because everyone but you expects that making alternative methods of \n	encryption illegal is the next step.  Otherwise the Cripple chip is \n	utterly worthless.  It should be obvious that \n		a) the Cripple Chip is aimed at spying on ordinary citizens\n				OR\n		b) that other forms of encryption will soon be illegal.
I've been reading this board passively for a while now and find the\nsubject absolutely fascinating, especially from the point of view of\na civil rights nut like myself.  My problem is that I'm new to the field\nand paragraphs like the above keep popping up.  I'm sure what Mr. \nBellovin is writing about is both fascinating and important, but I have \nNO IDEA what it means.  :-)   \n  \n  Anyway I'm keen to learn and will read anything I can get my hands on\nthat explains this stuff in lay terms (I have a decent CS background, but\nnot a huge amount of hyper-advanced math).  Can anyone point me to a FAQ\nor a decent source of information about the guts of current cryptography and\nmaybe a little history as well?  I read the piece in this month's WIRED, can\nanyone tell me how much I should trust the references they suggest?\n\n  Thanks in advance,\n   Steve.

Since the law requires that wiretaps be requested by the Executive\nBranch and approved by the Judicial Branch, it seems clear that one\nof the key registering bodies should be under the control of the\nJudicial Branch.  I suggest the Supreme Court, or, regionally, the\nCourts of Appeal.  More specifically, the offices of their Clerks.\n\n       Courts already operate substantial record-keeping operations.  Some\nof these records are confidential.  So the concept of a court holding\ninformation in confidence in accordance with law has longstanding legal \nprecedents.  The judiciary is more immune to pressure from the executive\nbranch than any executive branch agency or contractor can be.  So judicial\ncontrol of keys is appropriate.\n\n       For the other half of the key, I suggest a unit of Congress, the\nGeneral Accounting Office.  The GAO is Congress's staff unit for keeping\ntabs on the Executive Branch, and has an excellent reputation.  It's\ncontrolled strictly by Congress; the Executive Branch has no authority\nover it.\n\n       With keys split between the Legislative and Judicial branches,\nwe might have a chance of this system working honestly.  If, of course,\na way can be found to keep the keys from being siphoned off before\nthey reach the repositories.\n\n       This should not be construed as an endorsement by me of the\nwhole Clipper concept.  But if we have to have it, splitting control\nacross all three branches of government might make it work.
You forget the obvious! If it is an *authorised* tap then it can be done at\nthe exchange. If the exchange is *digital* then I suspect that you can\nauto-monitor a line and pickup the full link. Therefore syncing a piggyback\nmodem on the line would not be impossible - I suspect.\n--
>I'm afraid this doesn't work either. We can pick up laptop screens without any\n   >problem. [...]\n\n   I heard somewhere (can't name the source) that TEMPEST does not necessarily\n   pick-up just CRTs, but it can pick up emissions from almost any chip.  If\n   that is true, the kind monitor would not make any difference becuase everything\n   on the screen can be picked-up from the video controller.  Can anybody verify\n   or refute this?\n\nYes, that's true.  TEMPEST is nothing magic, it's just listening to any\navailable electromagnetic emissions and using all the analysis techniques  \nyou know to separate out the interesting stuff. \n\nThe nice thing about old CRTs is that they used to put out LOTS of\nsignal, so they're easy to detect, and if you do your sync carefully,\nyou can watch the output on the monitor in your deceptively-marked\nChevy Step-Van.  Some brands of electric typewriters were even worse.\nIn both cases, it's especially nice because it gets you the data the\nuser is looking at, rather than whatever stuff the paging algorithm is\npaging out to disk, etc.\n\nWith newer, quieter equipment, there isn't as much signal, and it's harder to\nisolate the fun parts.  TEMPEST-rated equipment has much lower signal levels.\nBut "Everything has vibrations", as Master Chuan said.

I may be misreading you here.  Are you saying the American Revolution \nwasn't a good idea because it was bad odds?\n\nI kind of doubt that any revolution, armed or otherwise, was ever started \nwithout vast amounts of failed "working within a system".  A good sign of \na system being not worth preserving would probably be that very inability \nto work within it productively.

If someone were to seize\na safe containing your (paper) records, and demand that you produce\nthe combination, the applicable defense would be on grounds of\nunreasonable search and seizure.

[story deleted]\n\nLet me give you another story that actually happened to ME.  We sell\ncommunications boards that use a 68000.  They used to be high tech. Our\nagent in the UK sold a system to a company in CH which packaged it in a\nproduct for CZ (London-Bern-Prague).  I telexed the Brits and told them\nthe Swiss need to pass export paperwork through the US as, at the time,\nyou needed an export lisence for these systems.\n\nNow I knew the NSA was watching this traffic (just like they are watching\nTHIS traffic.)\n\nAnd what do you know... two weeks later an agent of the US government shows\nup in my office to remind me if we or our agents sold systems into the Evil\nEmpire, we had better make sure the export lisences were handled properly.\n\nHe was part of a FIVE man office in COLUMBUS OHIO!! who did this stuff\nbased on sources he could not reveal. (I assume most of the time these\nguys sat around the office with their thumbs up their ass as there isn't\nthat much stuff coming out of Columbus :)\n\nWow, the electric utility in Prague sure is a big worry for these folks :)\n\nThe point is, we have created a giant bureaucracy (NSA) with a budget\nbigger than the CIA's who, like all bureaucracies, fill their time looking\nfor things to do.  The Evil Empire is gone.  The NSA is not.  They will do\nsomething to fill their time and justify their budgets.  (I just wish they\ntoo would sit around with their thumbs up their ass... but that is too\nmuch to hope for... they will spy on us and do things like skipjack and\nsubvert people like Dorothy Denning.)  Sigh...
David,\n\n   Neither (1) or (2) apply with the government, though. The feds, unlike\nApple, have repeatedly demonstrated that trust is an unsafe thread on which\nto hang your freedom. Why?  Because unlike Apple in (2), the govt has no\ncredibility to lose. I'm serious about this. One can name just about any\nagency -- the IRS, RTC, FCC, FAA, FBI, NSA, CIA -- and find numerous examples\nof the public trust run roughshod over. Worse, one can rarely find in such \nexamples any serious consequences to the offending agency. Even supposing\nwe could get a reign on trust somehow, there's always the matter of competence\nin govt agencies. Can they even trust themselves?\n\n  -mel\n\n  P.S. I was amused when you mentioned the USDA as an example of an agency\ncapable of managing the an escrow. I'm a consultant to the USDA, and while those\n*I* work with are wonderful <grin>, the agency itself is ranked in industry\npublications such as Govt Computer News as one of the worst caretakers of\nits computer resources. Recently, Prime Time Live did a long segment on\nthe USDA's computer troubles. They are making a concerted effort to change,\nbut intentions don't make a track record.
The clipper chip's User key is formed by:\n \n           R1 = E[D[E[N1;S1];S2];S1]\n           R2 = E[D[E[N2;S1];S2];S1]\n           R3 = E[D[E[N3;S1];S2];S1]\n \n   Why is the triple-encrytion used?  Is it just to gain an effective\nincrease in keyspace to defeat a potential keysearch?  (If so, why use\n80 bit keys?)  Not knowing anything about the Skipjack algorithm, it's\nnot really possible to guess whether this makes it harder or easier to\nguess S1,S2.\n \n   Why are N1, N2, and N3 formed as they are?  It would be facinating to\nsee the Skipjack algorithm, to look for ways of attacking it that require\nthree ciphertext blocks formed in that odd way.\n \n   Where do the 34-bit constant values that are concatenated with the\nserial number to form N1,N2,N3 come from?  Are they changed from chip to\nchip, or session to session?  (Even if they're published in the NY Times,\nif SkipJack is resistant to known-plaintext attacks, when using triple-\nencryption, then there's no break in security.  But why allow that kind\nof weird format?  If those three 34-bit values are truly-random bits, then\nmaybe it's used to ensure that a known-plaintext attack on SkipJack, if\nit exists, can't be easily used to derive S1 and S2 for a whole production\nrun of these chips....)\n \n   Does Dorothy Denning read this group?  If not, is someone on the group\nforwarding questions like these to her, or Martin Hellman, or anyone else\nwho's seen more details about the chip?

Since \nencryption and the Clipper chip are raised in this letter, I felt it would be\nof interest.  I understand that on 29 April, Mr. Markey will be holding a\nhearing on the questions raised in this letter.  There may also be a follow-on\nhearing dedicated to the clipper chip, but that's not definite.\n\nI've typed in the letter, which follows.  Any errors in transcription are \nmine...\n\n---\nGlenn Tenney\ntenney@netcom.com            Amateur radio: AA6ER\nVoice: (415) 574-3420        Fax: (415) 574-0546\n\n------------------ letter of interest follows ----------------\n\nApril 19, 1993\n\nThe Honorable Ronald H. Brown\nSecretary\nDepartment of Commerce\n14th and Pennsylvania Ave., NW\nWashington, DC 20236\n\nDear Secretary Brown:\n\n   As you know, I have long been interested in the privacy \nand security of telecommunications transmissions and data in \na networked environment.  Recent reports concerning the \nAdministration's endorsement of an electronic encryption \nstandard, based upon "clipper chip" technology, have raised a \nnumber of related issues.  The international competitiveness \nof U.S. high tech manufacturers and the software industry is \na key factor that the government should consider when \naddressing issues of encryption and data security.  As the \nnation moves forward in developing the national \ncommunications and information infrastructure, security of \ntelecommunications transmissions and network data will be an \nincreasingly important factor for protecting the privacy of \nusers.\n\n   The "hacker" community can compromise the integrity of \ntelecommunications transmissions and databases linked by the \nnetwork.  The people and businesses that use the nation's \ntelecommunications network and the personal computers linked \nthrough it increasingly are demanding that information be \nprotected against unauthorized access, alteration, and theft.\n\n   I am concerned that the Administration's plan may mean \nthat to remain competitive internationally, U.S. companies \nwould be compelled to develop two products -- one for U.S. \ngovernment customers, and another for private, commercial \nusers who may want a higher encryption standard.  This may \ninadvertently increase costs to those U.S. companies hoping \nto serve both markets.  To assist the Subcommittee's analysis \nof this issue, please respond to the following questions:\n\n1. Has the encryption algorithm or standard endorsed by the \nAdministration been tested by any entity other than NSA, NIST \nor the vendor?  If so, please identify such entities and the \nnature of testing performed.  If not, please describe any \nplans to have the algorithm tested by outside experts and how \nsuch experts will be chosen.\n\n2. Under the Administration's plan, what entities will be the \nholders of the "keys" to decrypt scrambled data?  What \nprocedures or criteria will the Administration utilize to \ndesignate such key holders?\n\n3. Does the encryption algorithm endorsed by the \nAdministration contain a "trap door" or "back door," which \ncould allow an agency or entity of the Federal government to \ncrack the code?\n\n4. It is clear that over time, changes in technologies used \nfor communications will require new techniques and additional \nequipment.  How will encryption devices adapt to the rapid \nadvancement of telecommunications technology?\n\n5. What additional costs would the proposed encryption place \non the Federal government?  What is the estimated cost to \nconsumers and businesses which opt for the federal standard \nin their equipment?\n\n6. What is the Commerce Department's assessment of the \ncompetitive impact of the Administration's endorsement of the \n"clipper chip" technology on U.S. exports of computer and \ntelecommunications hardware and software products?\n\n   I would appreciate your response by no later than close-\nof-business, Wednesday, April 28, 1993.  If you have any \nquestions, please have your staff contact Colin Crowell or \nKaren Colannino of the Subcommittee staff at (202) 226-2424.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEdward J. Markey\nChairman\n\n###
The patents don't apply in Canada.  I think the free trade agreement may\nprovide for recognition of new patents, but not old ones.
It was implied in the first technical posting by Dorothy Denning that the\nFBI would do the decryption *for* the law enforcement agencies.  It wasn't\nclear to me from the post whether this would be done in realtime or not, or\nwhether the FBI would just decrypt the session keys for the locals, or would\ndo the whole message.\n \n   One thing I'm a bit puzzled by:  Why aren't they doing this with a public\nkey scheme of some sort?  You could generate two uniqe public/private pairsor\nfor each chip.  Then, escrow the private keys with the escrow agencies.  Set\nthe protocol up to encrypt the session key with both public keys.  To decrypt\na message, both escrow agencies (in the right order, for most PK schemes)\nhave to decrypt with the escrowed private key.  This way, there wouldn't be\nthecconcern that, once the police had asked fo  a warrant/wiretap, they\nwould have your key forver.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\n\nPlease note that the following speech was made by Chuck Hammill\nin 1987.  Address all letters to his address, given at the end\nof this document.\n     -- Russell\n\n  FROM CROSSBOWS TO CRYPTOGRAPHY:  THWARTING THE STATE VIA\n                     TECHNOLOGY\n\n  Given at the Future of Freedom Conference, November 1987\n\n\n     You   know,   technology--and   particularly   computer\ntechnology--has often gotten a bad rap in  Libertarian  cir-\ncles.  We tend to think of Orwell's 1984, or Terry Gilliam's\nBrazil,  or  the  proximity  detectors keeping East Berlin's\nslave/citizens on their own side of the border, or  the  so-\nphisticated  bugging  devices  Nixon used to harass those on\nhis "enemies list."  Or, we recognize that for the price  of\na  ticket  on  the Concorde we can fly at twice the speed of\nsound, but only if we first walk thru a magnetometer run  by\na  government  policeman, and permit him to paw thru our be-\nlongings if it beeps.\n\n     But I think that mind-set is a mistake.   Before  there\nwere cattle prods, governments tortured their prisoners with\nclubs  and  rubber  hoses.    Before  there  were lasers for\neavesdropping, governments used binoculars and  lip-readers.\nThough  government certainly uses technology to oppress, the\nevil lies not in the tools but in the wielder of the tools.\n\n     In fact, technology represents one of the most  promis-\ning  avenues  available  for  re-capturing our freedoms from\nthose who have stolen them.  By its very nature,  it  favors\nthe  bright  (who can put it to use) over the dull (who can-\nnot).  It favors the adaptable (who are  quick  to  see  the\nmerit  of  the  new  (over  the sluggish (who cling to time-\ntested ways).  And what two better words are  there  to  de-\nscribe government bureaucracy than "dull" and "sluggish"?\n\n     One  of  the  clearest,  classic triumphs of technology\nover tyranny I see is  the  invention  of  the  man-portable\ncrossbow.   With it, an untrained peasant could now reliably\nand lethally engage a target out to  fifty  meters--even  if\nthat  target  were  a mounted, chain-mailed knight.  (Unlike\nthe longbow, which, admittedly was more powerful, and  could\nget  off  more shots per unit time, the crossbow required no\nformal training to utilize.   Whereas the  longbow  required\nelaborate  visual,  tactile  and kinesthetic coordination to\nachieve any degree of accuracy, the wielder  of  a  crossbow\ncould simply put the weapon to his shoulder, sight along the\narrow  itself, and be reasonably assured of hitting his tar-\nget.)\n\n     Moreover, since just about  the  only  mounted  knights\nlikely  to  visit  your  average peasant would be government\nsoldiers and tax collectors, the utility of the  device  was\nplain:    With it, the common rabble could defend themselves\nnot only against one another, but against their governmental\nmasters.   It was the  medieval  equivalent  of  the  armor-\npiercing  bullet,  and, consequently, kings and priests (the\nmedieval equivalent of a  Bureau  of  Alcohol,  Tobacco  and\nCrossbows)  threatened  death  and  excommunication, respec-\ntively, for its unlawful possession.\n\n     Looking at later developments, we  see  how  technology\nlike  the  firearm--particularly the repeating rifle and the\nhandgun, later followed by the Gatling gun and more advanced\nmachine guns--radically altered the balance of interpersonal\nand inter-group power.  Not without reason was the Colt  .45\ncalled "the equalizer."  A frail dance-hall hostess with one\nin  her  possession  was  now  fully able to protect herself\nagainst the brawniest roughneck in any saloon.    Advertise-\nments  for  the period also reflect the merchandising of the\nrepeating cartridge  rifle  by  declaring  that  "a  man  on\nhorseback,  armed with one of these rifles, simply cannot be\ncaptured."  And, as long as his captors  were  relying  upon\nflintlocks  or  single-shot rifles, the quote is doubtless a\ntrue one.\n\n     Updating now to  the  present,  the  public-key  cipher\n(with  a  personal  computer to run it) represents an equiv-\nalent quantum leap--in a defensive weapon.    Not  only  can\nsuch  a technique be used to protect sensitive data in one's\nown possession, but it can also permit two strangers to  ex-\nchange   information   over   an   insecure   communications\nchannel--a  wiretapped   phone   line,   for   example,   or\nskywriting, for that matter)--without ever having previously\nmet  to  exchange cipher keys.   With a thousand-dollar com-\nputer, you can create a cipher that  a  multi-megabuck  CRAY\nX-MP  can't  crack in a year.  Within a few years, it should\nbe economically feasible to similarly encrypt voice communi-\ncations; soon after that, full-color digitized video images.\nTechnology will not only have made wiretapping obsolete,  it\nwill  have  totally demolished government's control over in-\nformation transfer.\n\n     I'd like to take just a moment to sketch the  mathemat-\nics  which makes this principle possible.  This algorithm is\ncalled the RSA algorithm, after Rivest, Shamir, and  Adleman\nwho  jointly created it.  Its security derives from the fact\nthat, if a very large number is  the  product  of  two  very\nlarge  primes,  then it is extremely difficult to obtain the\ntwo prime factors from analysis  of  their  product.    "Ex-\ntremely"  in  the  sense that if primes  p  and  q  have 100\ndigits apiece, then their 200-digit product cannot  in  gen-\neral be factored in less than 100 years by the most powerful\ncomputer now in existence.\n\n     The  "public" part of the key consists of (1) the prod-\nuct  pq  of the two large primes p and q, and (2)  one  fac-\ntor,  call it  x  , of the product  xy  where  xy = {(p-1) *\n(q-1) + 1}.  The "private" part of the key consists  of  the\nother factor  y.\n\n     Each  block of the text to be encrypted is first turned\ninto an integer--either by using ASCII,  or  even  a  simple\nA=01,  B=02,  C=03, ... , Z=26 representation.  This integer\nis then raised to the power  x (modulo pq) and the resulting\ninteger is then sent as the encrypted message.  The receiver\ndecrypts by taking this integer to the  (secret)  power    y\n(modulo  pq).  It can be shown that this process will always\nyield the original number started with.\n\n     What makes this a groundbreaking development,  and  why\nit  is  called  "public-key"  cryptography,"  is  that I can\nopenly publish the product  pq and the number   x   ,  while\nkeeping  secret  the number  y  --so that anyone can send me\nan encrypted message, namely\n                       x\n                     a    (mod pq)  ,\nbut only I can recover the original message  a  , by  taking\nwhat  they  send, raising it to the power  y  and taking the\nresult (mod pq).  The risky step (meeting to exchange cipher\nkeys) has been eliminated.  So people who may not even trust\neach other enough to want to meet, may  still  reliably  ex-\nchange  encrypted  messages--each  party having selected and\ndisseminated his own  pq  and his  x  ,   while  maintaining\nthe secrecy of his own  y.\n\n     Another benefit of this scheme is the notion of a "dig-\nital signature," to enable one to authenticate the source of\na given message.  Normally, if I want to send you a message,\nI raise my plaintext  a  to your x and take the result  (mod\nyour pq)  and send that.\n\n    However,  if in my message, I take the plaintext  a and\nraise it to my (secret) power  y  , take the result  (mod my\npq), then raise that result to your x   (mod  your  pq)  and\nsend this, then even after you have normally "decrypted" the\nmessage,  it  will still look like garbage.  However, if you\nthen raise it to my public power x   , and take  the  result\n(mod  my public pq  ), so you will not only recover the ori-\nginal plaintext message, but you will know that no one but I\ncould have sent it to you (since no one else knows my secret\ny).\n\n     And these are the very concerns by the way that are to-\nday tormenting the Soviet Union about the whole question  of\npersonal  computers.    On the one hand, they recognize that\nAmerican schoolchildren are right now growing up  with  com-\nputers  as commonplace as sliderules used to be--more so, in\nfact, because there are things computers can do  which  will\ninterest  (and instruct) 3- and 4-year-olds.  And it is pre-\ncisely these students who one generation hence will be going\nhead-to-head against their Soviet  counterparts.    For  the\nSoviets  to  hold  back might be a suicidal as continuing to\nteach swordsmanship  while  your  adversaries  are  learning\nballistics.    On  the  other hand, whatever else a personal\ncomputer may be, it is also an exquisitely efficient copying\nmachine--a floppy disk will hold upwards of 50,000 words  of\ntext,  and  can  be  copied in a couple of minutes.  If this\nweren't threatening enough, the computer that  performs  the\ncopy  can also encrypt the data in a fashion that is all but\nunbreakable.  Remember that in Soviet society  publicly  ac-\ncessible  Xerox  machines are unknown.   (The relatively few\ncopying machines in existence  are  controlled  more  inten-\nsively than machine guns are in the United States.)\n\n     Now  the  "conservative" position is that we should not\nsell these computers to the Soviets, because they could  use\nthem  in weapons systems.  The "liberal" position is that we\nshould sell them, in  the  interests  of  mutual  trade  and\ncooperation--and  anyway,  if  we don't make the sale, there\nwill certainly be some other nation willing to.\n\n     For my part, I'm ready to suggest that the  Libertarian\nposition should be to give them to the Soviets for free, and\nif  necessary, make them take them . . . and if that doesn't\nwork load up an SR-71  Blackbird  and  air  drop  them  over\nMoscow in the middle of the night.  Paid for by private sub-\nscription, of course, not taxation . . . I confess that this\nis not a position that has gained much support among members\nof  the conventional left-right political spectrum, but, af-\nter all, in the words of one of Illuminatus's characters, we\nare political non-Euclideans:   The shortest distance  to  a\nparticular  goal may not look anything like what most people\nwould consider a "straight line."    Taking  a  long  enough\nworld-view,  it is arguable that breaking the Soviet govern-\nment monopoly on information transfer could better  lead  to\nthe enfeeblement and, indeed, to the ultimate dissolution of\nthe Soviet empire than would the production of another dozen\nmissiles aimed at Moscow.\n\n     But  there's  the rub:  A "long enough" world view does\nsuggest that the evil, the oppressive, the coercive and  the\nsimply  stupid  will "get what they deserve," but what's not\nimmediately clear is how the rest of  us  can  escape  being\nkilled, enslaved, or pauperized in the process.\n\n    When  the  liberals and other collectivists began to at-\ntack freedom, they possessed a reasonably  stable,  healthy,\nfunctioning economy, and almost unlimited time to proceed to\nhamstring   and   dismantle  it.    A  policy  of  political\ngradualism was at least  conceivable.    But  now,  we  have\npatchwork  crazy-quilt  economy held together by baling wire\nand spit.  The state not only taxes us to  "feed  the  poor"\nwhile also inducing farmers to slaughter milk cows and drive\nup food prices--it then simultaneously turns around and sub-\nsidizes research into agricultural chemicals designed to in-\ncrease  yields of milk from the cows left alive.  Or witness\nthe fact that a decline in the price of oil is considered as\npotentially frightening as a comparable increase a few years\nago.  When the price went up,  we  were  told,  the  economy\nrisked  collapse for for want of energy.  The price increase\nwas called the "moral equivalent of war" and the Feds  swung\ninto  action.    For the first time in American history, the\nspeed at which you drive your car to work in the morning be-\ncame an issue of Federal concern.   Now, when the  price  of\noil  drops, again we risk problems, this time because Ameri-\ncan oil companies and Third World  basket-case  nations  who\nsell  oil  may  not  be  able to ever pay their debts to our\ngrossly over-extended banks.  The suggested panacea is  that\ngovernment  should now re-raise the oil prices that OPEC has\nlowered, via a new oil tax.  Since the government is seeking\nto raise oil prices to about the same extent  as  OPEC  did,\nwhat  can we call this except the "moral equivalent of civil\nwar--the government against its own people?"\n\n     And, classically, in international trade, can you imag-\nine any entity in the world except  a  government  going  to\ncourt  claiming  that  a  vendor  was  selling  it goods too\ncheaply and demanding not only that that naughty  vendor  be\ncompelled by the court to raise its prices, but also that it\nbe punished for the act of lowering them in the first place?\n\n     So  while the statists could afford to take a couple of\nhundred years to trash our  economy  and  our  liberties--we\ncertainly  cannot  count  on  having an equivalent period of\nstability in which to reclaim them.   I contend  that  there\nexists  almost  a  "black  hole"  effect in the evolution of\nnation-states just as in the evolution of stars.  Once free-\ndom contracts beyond a certain  minimum  extent,  the  state\nwarps  the fabric of the political continuum about itself to\nthe degree that subsequent re-emergence of  freedom  becomes\nall but impossible.  A good illustration of this can be seen\nin the area of so-called "welfare" payments.  When those who\nsup  at the public trough outnumber (and thus outvote) those\nwhose taxes must replenish the trough,  then  what  possible\nchoice has a democracy but to perpetuate and expand the tak-\ning  from  the few for the unearned benefit of the many?  Go\ndown to the nearest "welfare" office, find just  two  people\non  the dole . . . and recognize that between them they form\na voting bloc that can forever outvote you on  the  question\nof who owns your life--and the fruits of your life's labor.\n\n     So essentially those who love liberty need an "edge" of\nsome  sort  if  we're ultimately going to prevail.  We obvi-\nously  can't  use  the  altruists'  "other-directedness"  of\n"work,  slave, suffer, sacrifice, so that next generation of\na billion random strangers can  live  in  a  better  world."\nRecognize  that, however immoral such an appeal might be, it\nis nonetheless an extremely powerful one in today's culture.\nIf you can convince  people  to  work  energetically  for  a\n"cause," caring only enough for their personal welfare so as\nto  remain  alive  enough  and  healthy  enough  to continue\nworking--then you have a truly massive reservoir  of  energy\nto draw from.  Equally clearly, this is just the sort of ap-\npeal which tautologically cannot be utilized for egoistic or\nlibertarian goals.  If I were to stand up before you tonight\nand say something like, "Listen, follow me as I enunciate my\nnoble "cause," contribute your money to support the "cause,"\ngive  up  your  free  time  to  work for the "cause," strive\nselflessly to bring it about, and then (after you  and  your\nchildren are dead) maybe your children's children will actu-\nally  live under egoism"--you'd all think I'd gone mad.  And\nof course you'd be right.  Because the point I'm  trying  to\nmake is that libertarianism and/or egoism will be spread if,\nwhen, and as, individual libertarians and/or egoists find it\nprofitable and/or enjoyable to do so.    And  probably  only\nthen.\n\n     While I certainly do not disparage the concept of poli-\ntical  action, I don't believe that it is the only, nor even\nnecessarily the most cost-effective path  toward  increasing\nfreedom  in  our time.  Consider that, for a fraction of the\ninvestment in time, money and effort I might expend in  try-\ning  to  convince  the  state to abolish wiretapping and all\nforms of censorship--I can teach every libertarian who's in-\nterested  how  to   use   cryptography   to   abolish   them\nunilaterally.\n\n     There  is  a  maxim--a proverb--generally attributed to\nthe Eskimoes, which very likely most Libertarians  have  al-\nready  heard.    And while you likely would not quarrel with\nthe saying, you might well feel that you've heard  it  often\nenough already, and that it has nothing further to teach us,\nand moreover, that maybe you're even tired of hearing it.  I\nshall therefore repeat it now:\n\n     If you give a man a fish, the saying runs, you feed him\nfor a day.  But if you teach a man how to fish, you feed him\nfor a lifetime.\n\n     Your exposure to the quote was probably in some sort of\na  "workfare"  vs.  "welfare"  context;  namely, that if you\ngenuinely wish to help someone in need, you should teach him\nhow to earn his sustenance, not simply how to  beg  for  it.\nAnd of course this is true, if only because the next time he\nis hungry, there might not be anybody around willing or even\nable to give him a fish, whereas with the information on how\nto fish, he is completely self sufficient.\n\n     But  I  submit  that this exhausts only the first order\ncontent of the quote, and if there were nothing  further  to\nglean  from  it,  I would have wasted your time by citing it\nagain.  After all, it seems to have almost a crypto-altruist\nslant, as though to imply that we should structure  our  ac-\ntivities  so  as  to  maximize  the  benefits to such hungry\nbeggars as we may encounter.\n\n     But consider:\n\n     Suppose this Eskimo doesn't know how to  fish,  but  he\ndoes  know  how  to hunt walruses.   You, on the other hand,\nhave often gone hungry while traveling thru  walrus  country\nbecause  you  had  no idea how to catch the damn things, and\nthey ate most of the fish you could catch.  And now  suppose\nthe  two  of  you  decide to exchange information, bartering\nfishing knowledge for hunting knowledge.   Well,  the  first\nthing  to  observe  is  that  a  transaction  of  this  type\ncategorically and unambiguously refutes the Marxist  premise\nthat  every  trade  must  have a "winner" and a "loser;" the\nidea that if one person gains, it must necessarily be at the\n"expense" of another person who loses.  Clearly, under  this\nscenario, such is not the case.  Each party has gained some-\nthing  he  did  not have before, and neither has been dimin-\nished in any way.  When it comes to exchange of  information\n(rather  than material objects) life is no longer a zero-sum\ngame.  This is an extremely powerful notion.   The  "law  of\ndiminishing   returns,"   the  "first  and  second  laws  of\nthermodynamics"--all those "laws" which constrain our possi-\nbilities in other contexts--no longer bind us!   Now  that's\nanarchy!\n\n     Or  consider  another possibility:  Suppose this hungry\nEskimo never learned  to  fish  because  the  ruler  of  his\nnation-state    had  decreed fishing illegal.   Because fish\ncontain dangerous tiny bones, and sometimes sharp spines, he\ntells us, the state has decreed that their  consumption--and\neven  their  possession--are  too  hazardous to the people's\nhealth to be permitted . . . even by knowledgeable,  willing\nadults.   Perhaps it is because citizens' bodies are thought\nto be government property, and therefore it is the  function\nof the state to punish those who improperly care for govern-\nment  property.    Or perhaps it is because the state gener-\nously extends to competent adults the "benefits" it provides\nto children and to the mentally ill:  namely,  a  full-time,\nall-pervasive supervisory conservatorship--so that they need\nnot  trouble  themselves  with making choices about behavior\nthought physically risky or morally "naughty."  But, in  any\ncase,  you  stare stupefied, while your Eskimo informant re-\nlates how this law is taken so seriously that  a  friend  of\nhis was recently imprisoned for years for the crime of "pos-\nsession of nine ounces of trout with intent to distribute."\n\n     Now  you  may  conclude  that  a society so grotesquely\noppressive as to enforce a law of this  type  is  simply  an\naffront to the dignity of all human beings.  You may go far-\nther  and  decide to commit some portion of your discretion-\nary, recreational time specifically to the task of thwarting\nthis tyrant's goal.  (Your rationale may be "altruistic"  in\nthe   sense   of  wanting  to  liberate  the  oppressed,  or\n"egoistic" in the sense of  proving  you  can  outsmart  the\noppressor--or  very likely some combination of these or per-\nhaps even other motives.)\n\n     But, since you have zero desire to become a  martyr  to\nyour "cause," you're not about to mount a military campaign,\nor  even try to run a boatload of fish through the blockade.\nHowever, it is here that technology--and in  particular  in-\nformation technology--can multiply your efficacy literally a\nhundredfold.    I say "literally," because for a fraction of\nthe effort (and virtually none of  the  risk)  attendant  to\nsmuggling in a hundred fish, you can quite readily produce a\nhundred  Xerox copies of fishing instructions.  (If the tar-\ngeted government, like present-day America, at least permits\nopen  discussion  of  topics  whose  implementation  is  re-\nstricted,  then that should suffice.  But, if the government\nattempts to suppress the flow of information as  well,  then\nyou will have to take a little more effort and perhaps write\nyour  fishing manual on a floppy disk encrypted according to\nyour mythical Eskimo's public-key parameters.  But as far as\nincreasing real-world access to fish you have  made  genuine\nnonzero  headway--which  may  continue to snowball as others\nre-disseminate the information you have provided.   And  you\nhave not had to waste any of your time trying to convert id-\neological  adversaries, or even trying to win over the unde-\ncided.  Recall Harry Browne's dictum  from  "Freedom  in  an\nUnfree World" that the success of any endeavor is in general\ninversely proportional to the number of people whose persua-\nsion is necessary to its fulfilment.\n\n     If  you  look  at  history, you cannot deny that it has\nbeen dramatically shaped by men with names like  Washington,\nLincoln,  .  .  .  Nixon  .  . . Marcos . . . Duvalier . . .\nKhadaffi . . .  and their ilk.  But it has also been  shaped\nby  people with names like Edison, Curie, Marconi, Tesla and\nWozniak.  And this latter shaping has been at least as  per-\nvasive, and not nearly so bloody.\n\n     And  that's  where  I'm  trying  to  take The LiberTech\nProject.  Rather than beseeching the state to please not en-\nslave, plunder or constrain us, I propose a libertarian net-\nwork spreading  the  technologies  by  which  we  may  seize\nfreedom for ourselves.\n\n     But here we must be a bit careful.  While it is not (at\npresent)  illegal  to  encrypt  information  when government\nwants to spy on you, there is no guarantee of what  the  fu-\nture  may hold.  There have been bills introduced, for exam-\nple, which would have made it a crime  to  wear  body  armor\nwhen government wants to shoot you.  That is, if you were to\ncommit certain crimes while wearing a Kevlar vest, then that\nfact  would  constitute a separate federal crime of its own.\nThis law to my knowledge has not passed . . . yet . . .  but\nit does indicate how government thinks.\n\n     Other  technological  applications,  however, do indeed\npose legal risks.  We recognize, for  example,  that  anyone\nwho  helped a pre-Civil War slave escape on the "underground\nrailroad" was making a clearly illegal use of technology--as\nthe sovereign government of the United States of America  at\nthat time found the buying and selling of human beings quite\nas  acceptable  as  the buying and selling of cattle.  Simi-\nlarly, during Prohibition, anyone who used  his  bathtub  to\nferment  yeast and sugar into the illegal psychoactive drug,\nalcohol--the controlled substance, wine--was using  technol-\nogy  in a way that could get him shot dead by federal agents\nfor his "crime"--unfortunately not to be  restored  to  life\nwhen  Congress  reversed itself and re-permitted use of this\ndrug.\n\n     So . . . to quote a former President,  un-indicted  co-\nconspirator  and pardoned felon . . . "Let me make one thing\nperfectly clear:"  The LiberTech Project does not  advocate,\nparticipate  in, or conspire in the violation of any law--no\nmatter how oppressive,  unconstitutional  or  simply  stupid\nsuch  law may be.  It does engage in description (for educa-\ntional and informational  purposes  only)  of  technological\nprocesses,  and some of these processes (like flying a plane\nor manufacturing a firearm) may well require appropriate li-\ncensing to perform legally.    Fortunately,  no  license  is\nneeded  for  the  distribution or receipt of information it-\nself.\n\n     So, the next time you look at the political  scene  and\ndespair,  thinking,  "Well,  if 51% of the nation and 51% of\nthis State, and 51% of this city have  to  turn  Libertarian\nbefore  I'll  be  free,  then  somebody might as well cut my\ngoddamn throat now, and put me out of my  misery"--recognize\nthat  such  is not the case.  There exist ways to make your-\nself free.\n\n     If you wish to explore such techniques via the Project,\nyou are welcome to give me your name and address--or a  fake\nname  and  mail  drop, for that matter--and you'll go on the\nmailing list for my erratically-published newsletter.    Any\nfriends  or acquaintances whom you think would be interested\nare welcome as well.  I'm not even asking for stamped  self-\naddressed envelopes, since my printer can handle mailing la-\nbels and actual postage costs are down in the noise compared\nwith  the  other  efforts  in getting an issue out.   If you\nshould have an idea to share, or even a  useful  product  to\nplug,  I'll be glad to have you write it up for publication.\nEven if you want to be the proverbial "free rider" and  just\nbenefit  from  what others contribute--you're still welcome:\nEverything will be public domain; feel free to  copy  it  or\ngive it away (or sell it, for that matter, 'cause if you can\nget  money  for  it while I'm taking full-page ads trying to\ngive it away, you're certainly entitled to  your  capitalist\nprofit . . .)  Anyway, every application of these principles\nshould make the world just a little freer, and I'm certainly\nwilling to underwrite that, at least for the forseeable  fu-\nture.\n\n     I  will leave you with one final thought:  If you don't\nlearn how to beat your plowshares into  swords  before  they\noutlaw  swords,  then you sure as HELL ought to learn before\nthey outlaw plowshares too.\n\n                                       --Chuck Hammill\n\n                                 THE LIBERTECH PROJECT\n                                 3194 Queensbury Drive\n                               Los Angeles, California\n                                                 90064\n                                          310-836-4157\n\n                                    hammill@netcom.com\n\n[The above LiberTech address was updated December 1992, with the\n permission of Chuck Hammill, by Russell Whitaker]\n\nThose interested in the issues raised in this piece should participate\nin at least these newsgroups:\n\n                alt.privacy\n                alt.security.pgp\n                comp.org.eff.talk\n                sci.crypt\n\nA copy of the RSA-based public key encryption program, PGP 2.1 (Pretty\nGood Privacy), can be obtained at various ftp sites around the world.\nOne such site is gate.demon.co.uk, where an MS-DOS version can be had by\nanonymous ftp as pgp22.zip in /pub/pgp.\n\nVersions for other operating systems, including UNIX variants\nand Macintosh, are also available.

Tom Clancy omitted these key steps to try to prevent groups of people from\nbuilding a nuclear bomb.  However, he asserts that you can find these key\nsteps in any university library.  The main point of _Five Minutes To Midnight_\nis that it is impossible to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons,\nsince it has become easy to acquire the knowledge to build one, and fissible\nmaterials are nearly impossible to control.

My point is that your implied position about the "Waco\n: Massacre" is an assertion cum political position. According to a CNN poll,\n....\n: What you call the "Big Brother Chip" is right now a proposal under\n: discussion, and it is not yet clear that strong crypto is going to be\n: banned.\n\nJust to set the record straight, Steve Gardner was not the author of\nthe bit you quoted--I was. Steve just took issue with David's\ncharacterization of my words as "pernicious nonsense."\n\nI won't further comment on my own views...folks either support 'em or\nthey don't, and the lines in question were neither central to the\npoints I was making in my original post nor to the important debate\nhere in sci.crypt and elsewhere.\n\n\n-Tim May, who continues to hold the same views but doesn't feel like\ndebating politics

Suppose further that 3 or 4 of the chips\nprogrammed in each session never find their way into commercial\nproducts, but instead end up "elsewhere".\n\nSuppose the folks at "elsewhere" can determine a unit key, given\nphysical access to one of these chips.  Then those same folks can\ndetermine S1 and S2 for the whole batch...\n\nToo many suppositions?  Yeah, probably.

What is the reason for the push on clipper?\n\nTwo days after the lead story here in the Mercury Times (murky news)\nthere was another article on industrial espionage by the french.\n\nSomeone had said what can it hurt to allow the government to have\ncontinued access to our communications, they already have it.  The\nproblem is that, yes the do have access, and probably more than\nwe realize.  The government wants exclusive access to communications\nintercept here in the united states, cutting out other access detrimental\nto the national security (tm).\n\nI also doubt that a certain3 letter agency, that originated the encryption\nalgorithm and the chip designs needs to have anything to do with the \nescrow system to continue their intercept effort.
OK, I heard a lot of talk about the NSA's infamous control over encryption\nexport through the ITAR.  Here's a question.  Say I develop this great new\nencryption system, and I want to sell my software worldwide.  The thought\npolice then come in and say "This algorithm is a threat to national security.\nYou will not be permitted to export it."  At this point, what kind of trouble\ncould I get into if I ignored the ITAR and sold my program to international\ncustomers anyway?\n\nDoug Holland
could someone repost or send to me via email the original posting of the\nClipper Chip press release.\n\nthanks\n\nandrew kriger\nhampshire college\nagk@neural.hampshire.edu
It is my intent to cut the government off at the knees with the pen\n(and keyboard).  True, the lawyer and the lawbook only go so far, but\nI agree that it is best to use those resources to the maximum extent\nbefore seriously contemplating anything more... disruptive.
As I read the current wiretap law, it would not be legal now.  On the\nother hand, assuming a legislative change, recording but not decrypting\nClipper conversations would probably be found constitutional by the Supreme\nCourt, using the same reasoning (or the lack thereof...) by which they\npermit random roadblocks to check for drunk drivers.\n\nIncidentally, if we use that as our model, the Court will likely not\nuphold selective recording.  (On the other hand, I don't think they've\nthrown out ``drug courier profiles'' yet.  Must be that exception to\nthe Fourth Amendment that I can never find in my copy of the Bill of\nRights.)\n\nA lot -- and I mean a *lot* -- will depend on exactly how Clippertaps\n(or Tipperclaps, for encrypted music?) are used.  Don Alvarez showed in\nthe latest RISKS digest that it's possible to prevent the cops from\nreading traffic after their warrant expires.
Yeah, right, and if the ATF trashes your place on a bad tip they have\nto pay to repair it, sure.  And if your computer equipment is\nconfisticated in a raid they have to charge you with a crime within,\nsay, 90 days.  You're stretching the naivete bit on this one.
:       Since the law requires that wiretaps be requested by the Executive\n:Branch and approved by the Judicial Branch, it seems clear that one\n:of the key registering bodies should be under the control of the\n:Judicial Branch.  I suggest the Supreme Court, or, regionally, the\n:Courts of Appeal.  More specifically, the offices of their Clerks.\n\nI've got a better idea.  We give one set to the KGB c/o Washington embassy,\nand the other set to the Red chinese.
I never advocated not saying what you believe in.  I'm advocating second\nthought, and calm.  \n\n"A smart warrior defeats the enemy in ambush on the battlefield"\n"A smarter warrior defeats the enemy in open warfare on the battlefield"\n"The smartest warrior defeats the enemy without using the battlefield"\n\nThink about it.
:I tried this code yesterday.  On my Sparcstation ELC it takes over\n:300 seconds to compress 22 seconds' worth of speech.  This means that it\n:needs to be "optimized" by over a factor of 10 before it will be usable\n:in even a half-duplex mode.\n\nOuch!  Thanks for trying it.\n\n:I question whether CELP is the best approach for this application.  It produces\n:great compression but at the expense of tremendous CPU loads.  We want\n:something that can be run on ordinary workstations or even high-end PC's\n:without DSP cards.  My guess is that some other algorithm is going to be\n:a better starting point.\n\nYes.  I'm not sure if my xposting to comp.speech made it to here too, but\nI've found that a low sample rate (3300 samples/sec at 8 bits per sample)\nplus the pd 'shorten' lossless sound compression code actually does get\nspeech into 14.4K with a simdgen left over.  This is *definitely* worth\nworking on, folks.  And shorten works in well under real-time.
: \n: As a private citizen, I would feel much more "secure in my person and\n: papers" knowing that an organization committed to individual civil\n: liberties- the ACLU and the NRA come to mind- was safeguarding half of\n: my key. Both the ACLU and the NRA are resistent to government pressure\n: by the simple expedient fact that they are not supported, funded, or\n: overtly controlled by the government.\n: --------------------------\nThats one problem that has so far been overlooked. These two escrow\nagencies will have to create a secure database and service the\ninput and output of Keys. Who pays for this? If they refuse an\nillegal request from some congressman to deliver a key can their\nbudget by cut to punish them? Will congress be forced to fund\nthem forever?\n\nThe problem is that laws can change. Congress may pass a law setting\nup an escrow agency with instructions that keys are private. Some\nfuture congress may change that law. Suppose pre-nazi Germany had\na clipper system. Do you think the escrow agencies would have\ntold Hitler that he could not have the keys without a valid \ncourt order?\n\nIn effect you must set up escrow agencies as a fourth branch of\nthe goverment and isolate them from any outside interferance. \nThey will be able to directly tap into Federal funds with no\naccountability to anyone except through a court challenge.
