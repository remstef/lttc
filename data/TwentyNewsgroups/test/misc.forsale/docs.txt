Recently I got a case of Hot Shots '93 cards.  Unfortunately I had\nnot planned on keeping all of them.  I sort of got stuck with the\ncase.  (I'm not going to mention any names, though.)\n\nSo, I am trying to sell off most or all (minus a set for myself).\n\nIf you have any interest in a set, a box, or any singles, please let\nme know.\n\nThe set has 250 cards.  Each card features a great looking woman in\nvarious stages of dress.  Some nude, semi-nude, lingerie, dressed.\n99 percent are gorgeous, I feel.\n\nThere are 4 subsets:\n\nGirl, Girl, Girls   1 through 9\nPromo cards   251 through 259 (also numbered 1 of 9 through 9 of 9)\nEmperor's All-Stars   269 through 277\nStripping Empress   260 through 268\n\nAlso, I am supposed to be getting some holograms soon as well.\n\nOh, and lastly, I have a very few error cards and a few cards\nthat were originally intended to be used as card #1, but the\ncompany changed their mind.  None of these cards are easy to get.\n\nAnyway, if you have some interest in any of these cards, please\ndrop me a line, as I am most eager to sell a bunch off.\n\nOh, and if you are interested, I also have 1 set of Hot Shots '92\nleft, and about 2 sets of California Dreaming cards as well.\n\nAnd lastly, I have promo cards for all of the cards I have\nmentioned, and holograms as well.  Not a lot, though.\n\n\nJohn Heiden\nal166@cleveland.freenet.edu

Hi All\n\nI have a Korg DVP-1 for sale for $300.00 + shipping.  For those who've not\nhad the pleasure:\n\nIt is a MIDI controlled (no keyboard of it's own) rackmountable digital voice\nprocessor.  What can it do with your voice?  It can pitch-shift it (change the\nnotes you sing).  It can add harmonies to your singing (up to 5 parts at one\ntime).  It can change your voice into a synthesizer's voice but leave what\nyou say alone and intelligible.  This works well for a "computerized" sounding\nsinger, or robot voice.  For those of you who just thought about that, yes -\nyou can do the voices from Robo-Cop, and the old ELO lead-ins with it, and yes -\nI'm a little red-faced to say that I tried those specifically.  For an input,\nit takes both: XLR (3-prong mic) and 1/4" cables.  For output, you can have\na combination of the original-input-only, and your choice of mix between the\noriginal signal and the effect (can be effect only if desired).  It has preset\nsetups, which you can edit and save for your own preferences.  It has a couple\nof light scratches, but does not look bad, and works flawlessly.  Even when we\ndon't use it in my music, it's been good for after-hours fun in the studio.\nThe manual is included.  I never got around to getting rack-ears for it, but\nit has only gotten studio use from me - no roading, so it's not beaten.

I just received a music software WinSong for Windows and found that it needs\na MIDI/sound card (Sound Blaster Pro is preferred) to have its fantastic\nfeatures show up. As I don't have the plan to add a sound card now, I am \nputting it here for sale. It's listed $79.95 on April issue of WINDOWS \nmagazine and I paid $84.95 as the total. I am asking around $70 with shipping\nincluded.\n\nWinSong for Windows:\n\nComposer, sequencer (tape deck), and Juke Box all in one.\n\nIt's a word processor for music - you can write and edit (cut, paste, move\nand copy, etc) notes and symbols, play and print your composition.\n\nIt's graphical user interface works like a multi-track tape recorder.\nUp to 64 musical tracks can be arranged for play, record, rewind, fast-forward\nand stop.\n\nIt plays music on any MIDI compatible instrument - piano, guitar, drum set,\nsaxophone, clarinet, organ, and many.\n\nYou do not need to be a musician to use this software. The on-line manual\nis handy. For musicians, it's great as writing music is not a tedious and\nstifling aspect.

Does it\nin\nthe\nI have had a Nikon L35AW since 1988. Unfortunately it is no longer\nmade. It is a P & S sealed to resist water to a depth of 12 feet. It\nis not really an underwater camera but it has been great in wet and\ndusty conditions. It takes AA batteries (hooray). It has the solid,\nheavy feel of old-style Nikons and has taken all the abuse I have\nbeen able to give it. This includes a lot of water (rain, river and\nsea), desert and beach sand as well as being used as a weapon\nagainst a mugger. Shouting and swinging the camera by the strap\ndidn't scare the mugger away, hitting him with the flying camera\ndid. This is my, "never be without a camera" camera. The current\nwater-resistant (Sport Touch I think is the name) model is nothing\nlike as solid or well sealed.

Pioneer CT-W601R Double Cassette Deck\n\n-Auto BLE Tuning\n-CD Deck Syncro Recording\n-music search, high speed dubbing, other standard features.\n\nLess than one year old. Excellent condition. $200 firm.
I'm looking for an old album or cassette tape. The group is Sanford/Townsend\nthe name of the album is 'Smoke from a Distant Fire' (I think). This album\ncame out somewhere around  1975-76, and I believe was the first album produced\nby Kenny Loggins after he and Jim Messina broke up.\n\nIf you happen to have this album and are willing to part with it, great. If\nyou don't want to part with it, but are willing to copy it onto cassette I'd\nlove that too.\n\nThanks\n\nJK

...\n\nUpdate:\n\n	No, I or my friends with me now have not delt with him, but we\ndid try to call him, and there's no answer at his phone.\n\n	The call was made at midnight EST; God knows what time that is\nin Arizona.\n\n	We'll try again later.\n\n	Anybody want to saturate his mail box?
It's basement cleaning time.  This stuff has got to go.\n\nI have two boxes of 9 track 2400' tapes, around 20 tapes/box.  They are\nfree to anyone who wants to come by and pick them up.  They've seen\nvery little use.  If anyone wants these bad enough to ship, they're yours\nfor the cost of shipping, the cod charge and a $10 nusiance fee.\n\nI have a lot of serial cables.  I have all kinds, ribbon, shielded, long,\nshort M-M, M-F whatever you want.  Most appear to work well with PC serial\nports, but I will not gaurantee that.  Tell me what you want and I'll do\nthe best I can to match.  1.50 ea or 10/$10.  Shipping included.  No CODs\nunder $20.  (You want to pay a $5 COD charge for a $1.50 cable?  Go buy\nthe cable at your local computer store instead, it'll be cheaper.)  I believe\nthese cables were removed from service at a computer center.  They appear\nto be in good condition and the ones I have used have worked well.\n\nI also have a 15 KVA Exide UPS with batteries that needs minor repair, probably\na logic board.  It weighs about 280 pounds and is 36 inches high.  I think\nthey used to run a Prime system off of it.  Best offer over $75, but you \nneed to come pick it up.  Use this to run your house from your solar panels.\n\nI will consider reasonable offers on any of this stuff.

I'm selling a bunch of my older 12" records off.  They are\nsitting around collecting dust and I never use them.

Please email me with the records you would want and what\nyou think a fair price is.  I will probably give deals, the more\nrecords you buy.  Kinda capatalist isn't it.  Well give me a yell at \npagorm@iastate.edu with any comments.  \n						See ya \n						Paul\n	I have recieved a few questions as to what 12" are.  I guess I\nshould elaborate.  (???!!!! am I that old?)  They are just\nmaxi-singles on wax.  If I am correct most beat mixers still use this\nform of record.  This is probably the kind of person interested in\nthis colllect or parts of it. Any questions call (515) 294-3737.\nThanks and see ya.	\nArtist			Song

I'm selling an Adaptec 1640 SCSI controller card.  I works with Microchannel\nmachines only.  The data transfer rate is very fast (I get about 3meg/sec with\nmy SCSI hard drive), and that's with relatively slow 100ns RAM on a card.  It's\na SCSI-2 true bus mastering/DMA device, and goes for around $329 bought new. \nI'm including the new EZ-SCSI software for speedy Win 3.1 performance and easy\nconfiguration.\nI'm selling it for $225, and I'll pay the COD shipping.
I am selling a Western Digital 212 meg IDE HD, the Caviar 2200 model.  The \naccess time is <15 ms, and it has a built in cache.  It is BRAND NEW, still\nin the original static bag.  Asking $275, obo.
The title says all.\n\n(not IBM brand)
I have for sale the following:\n\n	Hewlett Packard 500 Deskjet\n	4 Additional Deskjet Ink Cartridges\n	8 ft. Parallel Printer Cable\n\nThe printer is approx. 2 years old (7 months of use, and then a year\nin storage during my relocation from Illinois to Columbus) and\nin excellent condition. All original manuals, and boxes are included.\nThe selling price is $325.00 for the entire package. Unwilling to \nbreak it up because what good would cartridges do me without a printer.\n\nIf interested call either (614) 860-2144 or (614) 771-8861. You can also\nrespond via e-mail.

Ensoniq SQ-80 Cross-Wave Synthesizer:\nI have an SQ-80 for sale.  The SQ-80 is a powerful performance\noriented synth with a limited on-board sequencer.  I bought it because\nit has a very large timbral repertoire;  it seems to do meaty analog\nsynth sounds as well as sounds that are considerably more "digital".\nBelow are a list of features extracted from the owner's manual:\n  o Eight-voice polyphonic poly-timbral synthesizer, capable of\n    playing eight different sounds at once, with dynamic stereo\n    panning for each voice\n  o Voice section employing Cross-Wave synthesis;  combine different\n    attack and sustain wave segments to create complex, dynamic sounds\n  o 75 sampled waves (includes a drumset) serve as the sound source\n  o Dynamic voice allocation:  each sequencer track/MIDI channel has\n    access to all eight voices\n  o A full-featured MIDI controller keyboard capable of sending eight\n    MIDI program and volume changes at once.  Keyboard is velocity\n    sensitive, and transmits/receives velocity and polyphonic aftertouch.\n  o Powerful matrix modulation scheme allows a very wide range of \n    modulation sources and routings.\n  o A 3.5" floppy disk drive which writes/reads ordinary DS/DD disks\n    allows fast and reliable storage of up to 600 sequences and up to\n    1728 sound patches on a single floppy disk.  Also has a RAM-cart slot\n    for patches that is compatible with ESQ-1 RAM-carts.\n  o Does sysex dumps to its floppy disk for any sysex capable MIDI device\n  o 80 character fluorescent display and user-friendly "page-driven"\n    programming scheme provides a fairly humane user interface\n  o Stereo line-outs, and stereo headphone jack for private listening\n  o Sound programs and sequences are upwardly compatible with the ESQ-1\n    so that sounds and sequences created for the ESQ-1 can be played on\n    the SQ-80.\n\nThis SQ-80 has been the main MIDI controller in my studio for quite a while\nnow.  It has performed ably in that role, and has also been a heavily\nused sound source at the same time.  The SQ-80 seems to have been designed\nwith this role in mind, and it works very well with my software sequencer\n(WinCake) in its multitimbral mode.\n\nshort samples (there are 75 of them) as sources, then these waves\nare processed with a sophisticated DCF-DCA arrangement.  The SQ-80\nis capable of great things because of its 4-pole analog lowpass filter.\nSimply put, it makes fabulous analog synth sounds.  But unlike most\ngood analog synths, it has a very thorough MIDI implementation so that it\nworks very well with a MIDI sequencer.  What I really like most about this\nthing is that it is capable of making a very wide range of sounds.\nThis SQ-80 is about 5 years old (mfg. date 1/21/88).  It does have\nan 8-track sequencer, but like most on-board sequencers, it is a pain\nto use so I have avoided it.\n\nREASON FOR SALE:\nI am selling my SQ-80 because I recently joined forces with another individual\nhere in Boston, and we have more keyboards than space to put them.  I\nrecommend it for someone who is getting started in sequencing and needs a\npowerful but economical master keyboard.\n\nPRICING AND TERMS:\nI paid $1300.00 for this synth a few years ago.  I am willing to accept\n$650.00 (average r.m.m.s asking price is $733.00).  I will include a bunch of \npatches on SQ-80 floppy disks for the buyer of this synth, as well as the \noriginal Ensoniq SQ-80 owner's manual.\n\nPrice:    Asking $650.00 (everything)\nShipping: split shipping (UPS Surface COD) anywhere in the lower 48 states\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCraig Vanderborgh                                         Verbex Voice Systems\ne-mail:  craigv@rad.verbex.com                            119 Russell Street\nphone: (508) 486-8886                                     Littleton, MA 01460

<><><><> L O O K I N G       F O R      D A N A      W E I C K <><><><>\nHE IS A CROOK.  DON'T DEAL WITH HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nPlease Help:\n\nI am looking for Dana Weick.  A month ago I made a deal with him over the\nnet.  I was to sell him some memory, in exchang for $100 and a 486-66 cpu.\nI thought the deal was great, so I went on with it.  \n\nI sent him the memory COD FOR $100.  He was then suppose to send me the cpu.\nI receive his COD payment on 4/8/93.  He send me a message the he sent the\ncpu out 4/16/93.  It has been two weeks, and I didn't receive the CPU.\n\nI send him numerous message asking for confirmation that the cpu was ship, or\nwhat address he send it to (to make sure it didn't get lost in the mail.)\nHe never reply my mail.  \n\nI finally resorted to calling him in Arizona.  The first call didn't get\nthrought, I got  an answering machine.  I left him my number.  He didn't reply.\nI call again the next day and he pick up the phone.  I asked him if he had\nsend out the cpu.  He said yes, but he doesn't know what address he sent it\nto.  \n\nHe said that you would check his record at home and call me back the next day.\nTo my suprise, He never called.  I then send him some more email messages, he\nnever reply again. (strang, when the deal was being made, he reply to every\nof my message, now that He got my memory, He won't even reply to me.)\n\nNow:  I am still calling him, but he won't pick up the phone.  I am also still\n      emailing him, but he won't reply my mail.\n\nSo if any one know this DANA WEICK, please contact him.\nhe can be reach at:\n			Dana Weick\n			4238 W Las Palmaritas\n			Phoenix, AZ 85051\n    (602)925-6123 in the day time this is his business number.\n    (602)842-2145 in the evenings this is his home number.\n\n\nhis email address is:\n			weick@master.lds-az.loral.com\n*******This is our deal\n\nFrom weick@master.lds-az.loral.com Wed Mar 17 20:09:20 1993\n\n[my address]\n\nGreat, you can send the SIMMS to me at:\nDana Weick\n4238 W Las Palmaritas\nPhoenix, AZ  85051\n(602) 925-6123 (days) (602) 842-2145 (evenings)\n\nI would prefer US Mail, 2nd Day Priority (it only costs $2.90)\n\nThe CPU is brand new, install it correctly (meaning don't plug it in\nbackwards or bend any pins) and I'll warranty it for 6 months.\nThanks\n\n****ON 4/8 I SEND HIM AND SAID...\nthat I got the cod payment.\nand asked if the cpu is sent out yet\n****HE REPLIED.....ON 4/9\n\nGlad the COD payment got to you OK, the CPU has been sent so keep your eyes out\nfor it.  Be *very* careful when you install it, be careful of static discharge,\nbending pins during insertion and above all make absolutely certain you\nplug the chip in the proper orientation.  The chip was checked out prior to\nshipping and if you cook it by plugging it in backwards I won't be real\nsympathetic! \n \nIf you don't know how to tell what orientation the chip should be installed, \nDON'T GUESS!\n\n\n********************************DANA WEICK UPDATE:****************************\n\nI call him sunday, his wife Debbie picked up the phone.  She said that he was \nbusy with his kids, and he would call me back in 10 minuets.  Half an house\nwent by, Weick didn't called.  I called him again, and his phone was discon-\nnected.\n\nSince this post,  I have numberous people who mail me saying that this DANA\nWEICK have ripped them off.  We got do something about this guy.  He has\nappearrently been doing this for a few years now.  And he is getting away\nwith it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--

OK.  Instead of holding an auction, I have decided to compute prices for each comic (after many suggestions).  These are the most reasonable prices I can give (not negotiable).  If you would like to purchase a comic (or group), simply email me with the title and issue #'s you want.  The price for each issue is shown beside each comic.  First come, first served!!!  There is no more bidding.  Meet my price and it is yours.  I can be reached at this email address:\n\n02106@chopin.udel.edu or\n02106@ravel.udel.edu or\n02106@bach.udel.edu or\n02106@brahms.udel.edu\n\nNO MORE HAGGLING ABOUT THE PRICE!!!!!!!!\nLOTS OF COMICS FOR $1, $2, or $3 LOOK AT LIST!!!!!\n\nShipping is $2 for 1-3 comics.  For more than 3, the price will be determined by the volume of the purchase (I may have to use a big heavy box for large orders which costs more to mail).\n\nFor all those who have bought comics from me, thanks!!!\n\nAll comics are near mint unless otherwise noted (my books were graded by\nmile high comics and other comic professional collectors, not me!)\n\nHere is the list:\n\n*reserved* means that I have made a deal with a person and I am waiting for the check to arrive.\n*reserved* comics are as good as sold (sorry!)\n\nIncredible Hulk\n156 (vs another Hulk) $3\n195 $2\n196 $2\n246 (vs Captain Marvel) $1\n248 $1\n249 $1\n250 (Double size issue vs Silver Surfer) $5\n255 (vs Thor) $1\n279 $1\n300 $2\n312 $2\n313 $1\n316 (vs Bi Coastal Avengers) $1\n347 $1 *reserved*\n348 $1\n350 (vs Thing) $2\n354 $1\n358 $1\n360 $1\n362 (vs Werewolf By Night) $2\n364 $1\n365 $1\n366 $1 *reserved*\n379 (1 copy) $5\n\n\nPunisher\n50 $1\n57 $2\n\nPunisher War Journal\n29 (Ghost Rider) $2\n30 (Ghost Rider) $2\n\nPunisher Armory\n1 $4\n2 $2\n\nOriginal Ghost Rider Rides Again (Reprint)\n1 $1\n\nGhost Rider (old series)\n37 $3 *reserved*\n43 (vs Johnny Blaze) $3 *reserved*\n77 (2 copies, origin of GR dream) $4 each\n\nGhost Rider (new series)\n15 (1st print, Green glow in dark cover, 1 copy) $5\n15 (2nd print, gold cover w/ glow cover) $3\n\nWeb of Spiderman\n56 (2 copies) $2 each\n60 $3\n69 (vs Hulk, 1 copy left!!!)  $2\n70 (SpiderHulk, 1 copy left!!!)  $2\n71 $1\n72 $1\n78 $1\n\nDeadly Foes of Spiderman\n1 (2 copies) $2 each\n2 $2\n3 $2\n\nAmazing Spiderman vs Dr. Octopus (special NACME issue) $2\n\nAmazing Spiderman \n350 (vs Dr. Doom, 1 copy LEFT!!!) $2\n\nSpiderman (1990)\n1 (silver, not bagged) $4\n6 $3\n7 $3\n8 (2 copies) $2 each\n9 (w/ Wolverine, 1 COPY LEFT!!!) $2\n10 $2\n11 $1\n13 $5\n16 $1\n\nEnemy Ace Special #1 $2\n\nNew Warriors\n1 (gold cover) $2\n8 $4\n\nSuperman Man of Steel #1 $2\n\nSuperman (new)\n53 (2 copies) $1 each\n55 $1\n56 $1\n\nAdventures of Superman \n479 $1\nAnnual #3 $1\n\nSuperman Annual #3 (Armegedon 2001 tie in) $1\n\nAction Comics #666 $1\n\nAvengers West Coast #69 (Hawkeye vs US Agent) $1\n\nBatman\n465 (Robin returns) $2\n466 $1\n467 $1\nAnnual #15 (Armegedon 2001 tie in) $3\n\nCaptain America \n230 (vs Hulk) $2\n257 (vs Hulk) $1\n\n\nArmegedon 2001 \n1 $4\n2 $2\n\n\nFoolkiller #1 $2\n\n\nInfinity Gauntlet \n1 $6\n4 $3\n5 $3\n\nDouble Dragon #1 $1\n\nDeathlok (series) \n2 $1\n\nTransformers #80 (last issue) $2 \n\nWonder Man\n1 $1\n2 $1\n\nFlaming Carrot #25 (w/ Ninja Turtles) $2\n\nThe Comet #1 $1\n\nLegend of the Shield #1 $1\n\nJustice Society of America\n1 $1\n2 $1\n3 $1\n4 $1\n\nOfficial movie mag from Turtles II movie (sealed w/ Jelloman comic) $5\n\nRobin \n1 (1 copies w/ poster) $3\n1 (3rd print) $1\n5 (6 copies) $1 each\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy \n1 $6\n2 $3\n3 $2\n4 $2\n5 $2\n6 $2\n7 $2\n8 $2\n9 (2 copies) $3 each\n10 $2\n11 $2\n12 $1\n13 $3\n14 $3\n15 $1\n16 $1\n17 $1\n18 (2 copies) $2 each\n\nSuperman vs Amazing Spiderman (oversized issue from 70's) $7 *reserved*\n\nDarkHawk\n1 (3 copies) $8 each\n2 (2 copies) $6 each\n3 $5\n4 $4\n5 $4\n6 $3\n7 $2\n8 $2\n9 $3\n10 $1\n\nThor\n246 $1\n428 $1\n429 (vs Juggernaut) $2\n430 (w/ Ghost Rider) $1\n431 $1\n432 (Thor vs Loki, 2 copies) $3 each\n433 (new Thor) $2\nAnnual #16 $1\n\nWhat if....\n13 $1\n23 $1\n25 $2\n26 $1\n\nAlpha Flight\n29 $1\n51 $6\n53 $6\n94 (vs Fant. 4) $1\n\nNew Mutants\n22 $2\n100 (last issue, 1st look at X-Force, 1st print, 2 copies) $5 each\n100 (2nd print, gold cover) $4\n\nFlash (new)\n43 $1\n48 $1\n49 $1\n50 $2\n51 $1\nAnnual #4 $1\n\n\n\nUncanny X-Men\n191 $3\n215 $2\n255 (2 copies) $2 each\n258 $6\n275 (1 COPY LEFT 1st print) $6\n275 (gold 2nd print) $3\n276 $3\n277 $3\n278 $2\n279 $2\n280 $2\n281 $3\n282 $4\n283 $6\n\nDefenders\n52 (Hulk vs Sub Mariner) $2\n\n\nFantastic Four\n347 $4\n348 $2\n349 (3 copies) $2 each\n\nWolverine\n11 $3 *reserved*\n20 $2\n41 (w/ Cable, 2 copies) $6 each\n42 $4\n43 $3\n\nSilver Surfer (1987)\n1 $6\n2 $3\n3 $3\n4 $3\n5 $2\n6 $2\n8 $2\n22 $2\n24 $2\n32 $2\n49 $2\n50 (Foil cover, only 1 copy left!!) $6\n51 $2\n52 $2\n53 $1\n54 $1\n55 $1\n56 $1\n58 $2\n59 $2\n\nAvengers\n326 $3\n328 (origin of Rage) $3\n\nX-Factor\n40 $6\n67 $3\n68 $6\n71 $3\n73 $1\n\nGreen Lantern (1990)\n3 $2\n9 (2 copies) $1 each\n10 $1\n11 $1\n12 $1\n\nToxic Avenger\n1 (3 copies) $1 each\n2 $1\n\nSleepwalker\n1 (3 copies) $2 each\n3 $1\n7 $1\n\nKool Aid Man #1 (sealed in white bag, 2 copies) $2 each\n\nX-Force\n1 (bagged w/ Cable Card) $4\n1 (bagged w/ Shatterstar Card) $3\n2 $2\n3 $1\n4 $1\n\nNFL Superpro\n1  $1\n\nDr. Strange #31 $1\n\nHawkworld Annual #2 (2nd print, Armegedon 2001 tie in) $1\n\nHawk & Dove Annual #2 (Armegedon 2001 tie in) $1\n\nJustice League of America Annual #5 (Armegedon 2001 tie in) $1\n\n\n\nSend all comments to\n\n02106@chopin.udel.edu\n\nThanks\nSam (the "ex"  comic book collector)

I have an Altos 2000 System V.3 Unix system for sale (I actually have two,\nbut one's for me). Several years ago these well-known machines sold for\n$30,000 for the base configuration. This particular one has much more than the\nbase configuration, depending on what you want:\n\n- 386 16 MHZ CPU.\n- 8 meg of ram.\n- Fifteen (15) serial ports (or more if you want)!\n- A multidrop port for up to 256 more serial ports!\n- Ethernet.\n- 5.25" floppy drive.\n- QIC 24 cartridge tape drive.\n- 170 meg ESDI hard drive (either Micropolis or CDC, or both if you want).\n- Unix System V.3 installation.\n- Networking software package (TCP/IP).\n- Development system software package (C compiler and libraries).\n\nI am asking only $700 (firm) for the system! If you want another Ethernet or\nserial card, add $50. Additional disks are $100 each (I can install a total of\nthree ESDI drives). I would consider a trade for a SCSI DAT tape drive.\n\nThis box would make a great BBS system or terminal server. It was originally\ndesigned to service 40 active users, and up to 70 moderately active users.\nThis is NOT a PC! It was designed to be a Unix box from the start, and it's\nvery fast and exceptionally reliable.\n\nIt's dimensions are approximately 2.5' high (tower), 8" wide and 2" deep.\n\nI am only interested in dealing with someone local enough to come pick it up.\nShipping is way too much hassle.

I am not a company, thus this is not a commercial sale.  \n\nI purchased 256 T-shirts last fall for a fund raiser that fell through. \nWe didn't have the time to sell the shirts.  I have about 175 shirts\nleft and I am willing to sell them to you for $5.25 a piece (more than a\ndollar discount of what you would have paid the supplier for the shirts,\neven in bulk)  (That's $918.75 for 175 shirts)  These shirts are Jim\nMorris T-shirts.  They are all 100% cotton and most have more than 4\ncolors.  (They are clean and neatly folded in a box.  If any happen to\nbe damaged I will refund your money for each damaged shirt or replace\nit, your option.)  You could sell them for at least $8 to $15 a piece\n(the higher number is for the nicer shirts) to raise money for a school\nevent or a organization.  I realize it is a big investment, but it could\npay off big.\n\nI would be willing to sell the shirts in lots of 50 but only at $5.50 a\nshirt.  I will pay shipping, but prefer local buyers and will give them\nmore bargaining power.\n\nPlease help me.  I do not have the time to sell these shirts and I need\nthe money.  I am taking a big loss by selling this cheap.  I will give\nyou Jim Morris' phone number so that you can varify the prices.\n\nAll prices are negotiable.\n\n--Truman

/* posted for a friend -- please reply to him */\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++ CAR AMPLIFIERS FOR SALE +++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nI have 3 high-end car amplifiers for sale:\n\n(2) Old-Style Rockford Fosgate 150's.  These are great amps, and I've never\n    had a minute's trouble with either of them.  I've been running them on\n    high end for quite some time (front/rear) and have been very pleased\n    with them in that setup, but I've also run them on low end before, and\n    they perform quite well in that situation as well.  I'm trying to sell\n    them because I'm considering upgrading to a Rockford 650.  I already\n    own a Power 300, and I've always liked the way the 650/300 combo worked\n    in cars.\n\n    I'm asking $200.00 a piece, and list on them when I bought them was\n    $375.00.  If you're interested in both of them, I'd be willing to come\n    down on the price a little bit.\n\n\n(1) Precision Power 2150.  This great utility amplifier is rated at 2x150,\n    and looks brand new.  The shroud is unscratched, and it works great.\n    This is a great low-end amp because of it's high-power rating into\n    2 channels, however, I've also had it running front or back high end\n    before where it did very well.\n\n    I'm asking $425.00 for this amp, but feel free to make me an offer on\n    it.\n\n\n**** Please direct questions/replies to hacker@krusty.gtri.gatech.edu ****\n\n==============================================================================\n== Chase Hacker                          "Fortune presents gifts not        ==\n== chase@cc.gatech.edu                    according to the book.

[ ... Useful info about the Maxtor drive deleted ... ]\n\n\n	However, Thad, you should note that he said that he would like to\nuse it on a 'PC', not 'UNIX-PC'.  Also note the strange cross-posting (as he\nprobably did not), so it is not sure exactly what sort of machine he intends\nto mount it on.  If it *is* a PC (or clone), then the "2C" jumper would be\nthe correct choice.\n\n	I've left the cross-posting in effect, since I'm not sure which\nnewsgroup he would really be reading this in. :-)\n\n	DoN.

Computer Equipment Garage Sale:\n\nI've finally decided to clean out my closets and get rid of some of the stuff\nthat is broken or not being used by me.  I've put together a list and\nindicated what I think each item is worth.  This is just my estimate, and I\nam very open to any offers, including trades.  I'm currently looking for\nsome CD-ROMs that will work with a Mac CD ROM player CD Caddies, HD floppy \ndisks, any used Macintosh software, a 387-33Mhz Co-Processor, or basically \nanything you have lying around (cans of soup, the neighbor's cat, etc...)  \nMake me an offer, no offer will be overlooked... \nI really want to get rid of this stuff...\n\nOk, Here's the list:\n\n52 Meg 3.5" SCSI Hard Drive.  Conner Model #CP-3150.  I bought this from a guy\n	at a swap meet to use with my Macintosh.  Unfortunately, I can't seem \n	to get it to work with the SCSI controller in my computer.  The\n	guy tested it with his PC, and printed out a copy of the Norton Disk \n	Doctor report which says it has no bad sectors. (I'll send you a copy) \n	I was dumb enough not to get his phone number, so I can't return it to \n	him. The drive has many jumpers on it, (which I don't know how to set) \n	so maybe that's the problem.  I was quite disappointed that it didn't\n	work so I'm trying to minimize my losses.	~$45\n\n52 Meg 3.5" SCSI Hard Drive. Conner Model #CP-3150.  Same situation as above.\n	I bought both of these drives from the same guy.  Despite the different\n	model numbers they are the same exact drive.  Same report from NDD\n	(I have one for each drive) will be included.	~$45\n\n40 Meg SONY 3.5" SCSI Hard Drive.  SONY Model #SRD2040A.  The drive mechanism \n	is completely trashed.  This hard drive was in my computer (Mac SE) and\n	had a stiction problem.  Well, repeated banging on the side of the\n	computer resulted in a head crash (yes, metal scraping metal) which\n	was not too pleasant to listen to.  Still the SCSI controller\n	card is in good working order, and can be used for parts, or a \n	project.	~$20\n\n65 Meg Seagate 5.25" HH SCSI Hard Drive.  Model #ST-277N.  I originally bought\n	this drive, because it had a small stiction problem, and I though that\n	I could fix it.  Well I determined that the drive mechanism was fine,\n	and that it was a controller problem.  (motor controller wasn't sending\n	proper signals.)  Well, after taking the controller off the drive, \n	looking at it, and putting it back together, I realized that I\n	accidentally severed one of the small flat cables that connect the \n	drive to the controller.  I tried to solder it, but I'm not that good\n	at soldering so I couldn't do it.  Worked perfectly before I messed\n	up.  I used it as a temporary drive when the SONY (above) crashed on\n	me.  Also loaded the drive with about twenty Mac applications,\n	worth well over $1000.  (Claris CAD, MS Word 5.0, Think C,\n	Excel, and many others) \n	I think all it needs is a resoldering of that cable.  You also get all\n	the software on the drive. (if you can accept being a pirate)  I only \n	ask that you delete my data files from the drive.  I was really angry\n	when I broke that connection, and then couldn't fix it.  I just don't \n	have time to play with it any more.	~$65\n\nAT&T ISDN 7500 Modem.  This is for use on digital phone systems.  If you know\n	what this is or would like technical information on it, let me know.  I\n	have some tech documents on it.  Is supposed to be the same thing as an\n	AT&T digital phone, but without the phone part.  It seems to be in  \n	working order (passes self test perfectly OK).  I have no idea how \n	this is worth...   Let me know if you're interested.\n\nMotorola 68881 CoProcessor.  I haven't tested this one out yet, but if anyone \n	is interested I will get it tested out, to make sure that it works.  I\n	had trouble using it with my accelerator board, but then I spoke to the\n	manufacturer of the board and found out it couldn't be used without \n	another controller chip.  When I was looking around to buy one new, the\n	prices were around $100.  I will guarantee this to work.	~$65\n\nCGA Card.  Half-Length. 8-bit.  Wasn't working last time I checked (although\n	I think I was using a bad monitor)	~$5\n\n5.25"	360K Floppy Drive.  IBM Drive Type 1355.  Guaranteed to work, \n	because when I took it out of the PC, it was working!		~$25\n\n5.25" 360K Floppy Drive.  Toshiba Model Number ND-08DE-A.  Guaranteed to \n	work.  Came out of same PC as above.	~$25\n\n5.25"	Floppy Drives.  Can't guarantee that these will work.  I don't\n	even know if they are low or high density drives.  I don't have\n	any method of testing them.\n		Panasonic Model number: JU-455-5 ACG.  There's another\n			number on it: 2626-361723.\n		Panasonic Model number: JU-475-2 AGG.  There's also\n			another number on it: H3649-101457\n		Toshiba Model Number ND-08DE.  Virtually identical to the one \n			above.\n	Each Drive ~$10\n\n3.5" PS/2 Drive.  These things are proprietary, so I can't test it, but I\n	think it works.  Not sure if it's high density or low density, but I\n	suppose someone who is looking for one would know.  Model Number\n	DFL413C04A.  I think these things are expensive to replace.  ~$35\n\nMFM Hard Drive Controller Cards.  I've got three of these, and I have no way\n	of testing them.  Two of them are 8-bit cards, and one is a sixteen bit\n	card with a floppy controller built in.	~$10 for the 8-bits ~$15 for\n	the 16-bit card w/floppy.\n\nInteresting cable.  Seems to convert from a VGA plug to an EGA plug.  That is,\n	standard nine-pin to VGA 15 pin. Made by Hewlett Packard.  Part No.\n	D1181-80020		~$10\n\n\n\nI've sold stuff like this before, and it was a huge success, with many \nsatisfied people trading or bartering stuff they didn't need anymore.  I \nusually ship through the U.S. Postal Service (haven't had any problems yet) \nand the shipping costs will be split or negotiated.\n\nWell, that's all folks.  As I said before, no offer will be refused.  If you \ncan convince me to give OCit to you instead of throwing it out, TRY!  I hate\nto throw away stuff...\n\n\n-Wayne

I recently purchased an IBM monochrome vga monitor from Mike Damico. The\nmonitor arrived but it was missing it's power cable. Mike's address is\napparently not a proper address because mail can't reach it. If anyone\nknows how to contact Mike and could help me find him I would appreciate it.\nI am sure he just set aside the power cord as he was packing the monitor\nbut it would be a lot more useful to me if I had the cord as well.
