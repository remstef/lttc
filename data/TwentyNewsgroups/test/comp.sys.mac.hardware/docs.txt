I purchased 2x8 MB 72-pin (60 ns) SIMMs for my Quadra 800 from Chip\nMerchant (I've been very satisfied with them in the past).  Either one\nalone works, but both together fail.  I called Apple for advice and was\ntold that there was a problem with "Composite" SIMMs.  Only non-composite\nSIMMs should be used with the Q-800.  Chip Merchant confirmed that they\npresently sell only composite 72-pin SIMMs.  So, Q-800 SIMMs need to be\nboth 60 ns and non-composite.\n\nMarty Sachs\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nUSDA/ARS & Agronomy/UIUC    msachs@ux1.cso.uiuc.edu [internet]\nS108 Turner Hall            msachs@UIUCVMD [bitnet] \n1102 S.

I have a PLP II laser printer make by GCC Technologies.  I have problem\nwith a dirty first page.  The top portion of the first is always smeared\nwith black toner across the page.  If I print more than one page at the \nsame time, the problem does not occur on other pages.  I cleaned the\nprinter but still does not help.  Can anyone offer any solutions?\nor know the phone # to GCC Technologies?\n\nThanks in advance\n\nCharles,

I have the Logitech hand scanner for the Mac.  It uses a SCSI\ninterface box that the standard scanner unit plugs into.  I\nhave tried my friend's IBM hand scanner with the scsi box and\nit works.  See if you can get Logitech to sell you the scsi\nbox by itself.  Warning:  most of the cost of Mac handscanners\nis contained in the scsi interface box, so it could run up\nto around $200.  When I upgraded my old style scanner to\nthe new gray scale model, it cost $75; they just gave me a new\nscan head and software; the box was the same.  The gray scale\nscanner + interface runs about $300; making it around $200 for\nthe interface.

I was wondering if what many of you did to accelerate your IIsi's from\n20 MHz to 25 Mhz (and beyond) can be done to a IIci (ie. from 25 MHz to\n32-33 Mhz)?
The general consensus seems to be that an extended keyboard (or the new\nergonomic keyboard) with mouse is ok. The PB160 is rated for 200mA which is\napparently identical to the LC and the LC works fine with said attachments.\n\nThanks very much to those who replied...I am now on my way to order a Battleship\nand a mouse....    :)
Actually, the Quadra 900 and 950 both have the same SCSI controller,            (running at different speed).  They are not SCSI 2, but can support\ncertain SCSI commands that take advantage of faster drives.  The\nI/O processors are present on both machines.  The Q950 runs its\nI/O bus at 25MHz, while the 900's I/O bus is 16MHz.\n\nThe Quadra 950 supports 16bit color on all monitor sizes, as well\nas 24bit up to 832 x 624 resolution.  It also supports 1024 x768\nresolution.  The 900 supports supports 8bit at 1152 x 870, and\ndoes not support 1024 x 768 at all.\n\nVRAM on the 950 is 80ns or faster, and 100ns or faster on the 900.

Hello,\n\nwe need the code for decompression of Quicktime JPEG Pict files, as they\ndon't conform to usual jpeg compressors, which are available in source.\nThe code should be in C Pascal or Modula. The code will be used on several\nplatforms to view pictures over ISDN.

We just received an AppleOne Color Scanner for our lab.  However,\nI am having trouble getting reasonable scanned output when printing \na scanned photo on a LaserWriter IIg. I have tried scanning at a \nhigher resolution and the display on the screen appears very nice.  \nHowever, the printed version is coming out ugly!  \n\nIs this due to the resolution capabilities of the printer?  Or are \nthere tricks involved to get better quality?   Or should we be \ngetting something (like PhotoShop) to "pretty up" the image?\nI will appreciate any suggestions.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\n-Kris
It used to live in a 1990 SE, and is marked 344-0062, and the ROMs\nthat go with it are 341-0701 & 2. Is this the solution to the person\nwho wants to upgrade to FDHD ?\ncheers\nMike.
The first problem was the sound.  I tried the M0, but then even the logon was\nmuted.  I don't want that.  Any other suggestions for that hissing?\n\nThe second is really strange.  First, I kept mentioning that FC slowed down\nall the time and took too long.  Well I just logged on with extensions off and\nI didn't have any slowdown.  Also, last time I was online I quit (which\nusually disconnects and quits).  It disconnected but it wouldn't quit.  I had\nto force quit, and then when I launched FC again it said the modem port was in\nuse.  This is really strange.  I thought it might have to do with fax\nsoftware.  Or the restart could have reset the modem port (a more likely\nexplanation).  So, any suggestions?\n\n-David
Mostly. The Q950 does have a SCSI2 controller chip as it's SCSI\nchip, but it does not have the chips to use the Wide or Fast SCSI-2\nmodes and therefore doesn't offer much more in the way of SCSI\nperformance over the Q900. It does, howrever, have a faster I/O\ncontroller than the Q900; this is where the real speed boost comes from.
yet another twist ...\n\nI'm expiriencing the same kind of problem with my SE (2.5/40), although not\nas frequent.\n\nAny suggestions?

We are having problems with a bunch of SE/30's in one of our Labs. The\nfault is that the machines either bomb or freeze when attempting to write to\ntheir internal floppies.

FWB distributes HDT Personal Edition (HDT = Hard Drive Toolkit), which\nis what I own. This is less fancy than the "full" version, but good\nenough for what you and I want to do.

I *think* that both Drive7 and HDT PE\ncan be had for around US$50.\n\nI've used Silverlinging at work (v 5.42??), and I like HDT PE much\nbetter. IMHO it has a better interface, and easier to understand.\n\nAny Drive7 users?
The problem with turing your computer on and off constantly is not due to\nthe power surge at start up.  It is due to thermal fatigue.  You turn on\nyour computer, it heats up, and everything expands.  You turn it off, it\ncools off, and everything contracts.  There is a limited number of cycles\nof this that any component can take before it fails.  Modern electronics\nare much more robust in this respect than their predeccesors.  In fact\nportable computers are designed with this in mind since the sleep function\nthat extends battery life also greatly increaces the number of thermal\ncycles that occur.  As a rule of thumb, if I am not going to use my\ncomputer (and this includes the monitor) in the next 4-6 hours, I turn it\noff (I always dim the monitor when not in use to prolong the life of the\nphosphor).  I tend to think that with the pace of technical innovation in\nthe computer industry you should be much less concerned with the fatigue\nlife of your equipment and more concerned with how long your particular\narchitecture will be supported by hardware and software vendors. :")

[... other info deleted ...]\n\n\nAre you sure it's not a problem caused by software?  I've seen this sort \nof effect when a runaway program (which could be caused by an INIT \nconflict, for instance) accidentally wacks on a register in the video \nhardware.  Have you tried booting with no extensions and then letting the \nQ950 just sit there in the Finder?  You might also want to try changing to \n24-bit addressing (yes, I know you can't access your full 64 MB of RAM - \nit's just an experiment) as the video hardware registers can't be accessed \nthen.\n\nAnother thing to try as a 'recovery' measure is to use something like \nQuickKeys to change the pixel depth of the display.  This reprograms (some \nof) the video hardware registers and may allow sync to be restored.
Here's something to add to the discussion:\n\nNewsgroups: misc.activism.progressive\nFrom: "James P. Reynolds" <jpr1@lehigh.edu>\nSubject: When you're not using it, turn it off!\nDate: Mon, 22 Mar 1993 06:50:14 GMT\nLines: 53\n\nResearch has shown that the majority of the time that the United\nStates' 30 to 35 million personal computers are on, they are not\nactively being used.  In addition, 30 to 40 percent are left running\nat night and on weekends.\n\nComputer equipment is now the fastest growing private-sector use\nof electricity.  Computers alone are believed to account for five\npercent of commercial electricity consumption, and may account for\nten percent by the year 2000.\n\nIf you are one of those who leave them on after you're done, it\nwould be a big environmental benefit if you would just TURN IT OFF\nwhen you're not using it.  It only takes a second or two to do.\n\nAlso, the majority of the power your computer uses is not consumed\nby the computer itself, but by the monitor.  If you can't turn the\ncomputer off, then please just TURN OFF THE MONITOR.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has formed an alliance\nwith computer manufacturers to promote the introduction of energy-\nefficient PCs that "power down" automatically when not being used\nand thus reduce the air pollution caused by power generation.  These\nnew computers will save enough electricity to power both Vermont and\nNew Hampshire and save up to 1 billion U.S. dollars in annual\nelectricity bills.  Look for the special EPA "Energy Star" logo when\nyou buy computers.  They should be available in one to two years.\n\nAccording to the EPA studies, the energy saved will prevent CO2\nemissions of 20 million tons annually, the equivalent of five million\nautomobiles.  Also, 140,000 tons of SO2 and 75,000 tons of nitrogen\noxide emissions will be saved; these are the major pollutants\nresponsible for acid rain.\n\nPlease do your part ... be responsible.

My 610 is working like a charm.. In fact, if 610's are flaky, I would consider it a great computer even if I had to return a couple to Apple to get a good one.
Yes, the IIci has 32-bit clean ROMs.
I wish I caught the original post, but anyway ...\n\n\nThe problem is that the Plus's poor old power supply (sometimes referred to as\nthe analog sweep board) is on its way out.

A copy of Larry Pina's "Macntosh Repair & Upgrade Secrets" is a\nworthwhile investment for the serious do-it-yaself-er.

A rep at the dealer (actually it's a university order center, so\nthey don't have any immediate financial interest), told me that\nthey have been having lots of problems with their Centris 610.\nHe didn't go into details, but mentioned problems with the\nfloppy drive and intermittent problems with printing files.\nIt sounded to me like they were having both hardware problems\nand software compatibility problems with the machine.\n\nHe's not recommending the Centris 610 to anybody; he says to\nconsider a Centris 650 or a IIvx. (Why he would recommend a\nIIvx over an LCIII I don't know, but that's what he said.)\n\nSo, what does the net think? Did the dealer just get one flaky\nmachine, or did Apple send the C610 out the door too early?\nIs your C610 working just great, or is it buggy too?

completed\n\nWhy would you dispose a channel if you are going to play more\nsounds soon? If you are trying to write a game, you shouldn't\nbe using SndPlay. Instead, make a channel and use BufferCmds\nto play sounds on it. It works great. You can add CallBacks to\nthe channel also to let you know when the channel is getting\nempty. Before it gets empty.\n\n7.1,\n\nCallbacks are very reliable, I found them 100% reliable, even\nunder System 4.1. I was doing continuous background sound with\ninterrupting sound effects on System 6.0 with the IM-V\ndocumentation.\n\nYou probably were cancelling your callback commands out of\nyour channels, of course you didn't get called. In general, if\nyou have problems with sounds working when you play one per\nchannel and then close the channel (with the related\nslowdown), but then when you play more than one you don't\nwork, then you are adding more than one synthesizer to a\nchannel, possibly the same one multiple times. This might be\nbecause you are calling SndPlay on a preexisting channel with\na sound resource which adds the sampled sound synthesizer to\nthe channel first thing before it plays. Most sampled sounds\nhave this command at the start of them. You need to resedit\nthe sound and remove that command, then when you create your\nchannel, specify the sampled sound synthesizer to be the\nchannel's synth. Then you can use asynch sndplay's all you\nwant. You'll probably want to switch to BufferCmd's, since you\nare going to have to use SndDoCommand anyway to add callbacks.\n\nNow before you go ahead and tell me I am full of it, and the\nsound manager doesn't work for games, remember, Spectre uses\nit. And it works great. If Spectre can spare the CPU time, you\ncan too.\n\nOne little disclaimer: There are some out there who say the\nSound Manager in the IIsi can't be made to work right. I'm not\nsure either way, but I know for sure that you can make your\nsounds work 100% correctly on every other machine using the\nSound Manager.
The article was probably referring to changing the clock oscillator in a manner similar to that done on Quadra 700's and IIsi's. I haven't read a report of this actually being done on a Centris 610 but supposedly this also works on Q900,\nQ950 and centris 650 machines.
Hi, I just test installed kanjitalk 6.07 on my IIci \nand got a black screen, a way sick looking mac icon, and when hitting the\nprogrammers reset, a tone sequence that I guess is the infamous "tones of\ndeath." \nI was able to reboot off a floppy, removed the japanese system, and\nset up the system folder on the hard drive to get system 7.01 back.\nNow have no overt problems with the mac.\nAny idea what caused the tones?

Here's the story:\n\n(1)  The IIsi *cannot* supply a VGA output.  However...\n\n(2) Some VGA-type monitors can adequately deal with the video signal\nthe Mac uses to drive the Apple 13 or 14 inch "high resolution color\ndisplay"---i.e., Apple's own 640x480 mode.\n\nSo, if you wish to hook one of these monitors up to your IIsi, you\nneed (a) an adapter that converts from the Mac DB-15 connector to the\nVGA-style high density DB-15 connector, *but* tells the Mac to use\nit's own 640x480 mode, not the VGA 640x480 mode, and (b) a VGA monitor\nthat can deal with the higher bandwidth of the Mac 640x480 mode over\nthe VGA 640x480 mode (which as I stated in (1) above, the IIsi cannot\nproduce).\n\nAs far as (a) above is concerned, contact\n\n James Engineering, Inc.\n 6329 Fairmount Ave.\n El Cerrito, CA  94530\n 510-525-7350\n FAX: 510-525-5740\n\nThey can probably get you the right adapter.  Remember: you do *not*\nwant the run-of-the-mill Mac-to-VGA adapter, because it will try to\nhave your IIsi produce the VGA mode, which it cannot (the computer\nwill just fail to produce any video signal at all).  Instead, you want\nan adapter that connects between the Mac-style and VGA-style\nconnectors, but tells the Mac to use the Apple 640x480 mode.  Sorry\nfor the poor terminology available for describing this distinction.\n\nAs far as (b) is concerned, make sure to get a monitor that can deal\nwith a horizontal bandwidth of 35 KHz and a vertical retrace rate of\n67 Hz.  These are the spec's of Apple's 640x480 mode.  For comparison,\nthe VGA-standard 640x480 mode uses a 31.5 KHz horizontal bandwidth and\na 60 Hz. vertical retrace rate.\n\nThe monitor will probably need to have auto-synch'ing capability, as\nthe Apple mode you'll be using isn't one of the set of standard modes\nin the PC compatible world.\n\nGood luck!\n\n	-Fred Martin
Close, but no cigar.  The LISA was introduced in January, 1983 (at the\nsame time as the Apple //e).  I'll have to check to see if the Hard\nDrive came bundled for the $10K.  The floppy drives were 5.25"\ninitially (the infamous "twiggy" drives)
I guess the real question is:\n\nWho asked the original questions, and why was it so _broad_.\nAre we talking pure processing power (what kind of processing BTW)\nisolated from every other factor and influence in the system?  \nOr are we shopping for a home computer based on the CPU specs (yuck)!\n\nI just finished a project that involves real-time processing of serial\ndata and discovered that the programming interface (assembly) has\n_a lot_ to do with the "power" of a CPU in a particular application.\nIf what you want to do is easy to code with the instruction set given,\nthen not only is it easy, but it's cheap and quick.  If you have to\nfake things (like resolving indirection without a LEA instruction), then\nyour cycle count goes through the roof!\n\nwell, let's _NOT_ start a flame war about whose computer is better than whose.\nThe orginal question was about classifying micro-processors...\nhaving re-read the entire thread, I don't think much more can be said without\ngetting down into specific proposed systems with important details given.\n\n\nThat's it for another $0.02.\n\nCheers everyone.\n\n\n~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=\n  Peter Pundy\n\n  Email: 2545500@jeff-lab.queensu.ca

Several weeks ago, I described a problem with my Apple High-Resolution\nmonitor and promised to summarize replies received by e-mail. To\nrecapitulate: Occasionally, every two or three hours or so, my monitor\nmomentarily loses sync. The entire raster image bounces down about an\neighth of an inch or so, then rights itself. This usually happens right\nafter I close a large window, highlight a large area, or do something that\nradically alters the image on the screen. Sometimes, though, it happens\nwith no provocation whatsoever.\n\nI have received a bewildering range of replies. At one extreme was\na man, clearly quite knowledgable about monitors, who said that the\nproblem was that the 13" monitor's power supply simply couldn't always\nkeep up with sudden changes of the raster image; the rapid change from\na largely light screen to a largely dark one overtaxed the monitor's\npower supply. There was no fix available, he said, because nothing was\nreally wrong. (I guess he meant that the flaw was so fundamental that\nit had to be endured.)\n\nThis seemed quite persuasive and I would have been tempted to\nadopt an attitude of stoicism, except for a reply from a 13" monitor\nowner who discovered that this very problem is documented in the \nApple Service Technical Procedures, Volume 3, under the heading\nJitter Correction. The section describes a fix involving the replacement\nof a capacitor, the adjustment of a potentiometer, or, failing that,\nthe swap of a circuit board.

I hooked up an old 40meg external mac hardrive to a Powerbook 230.  I \nreformatted the drive, copied all the files from the powerbook except the\nsystemfolder, deleted the files from the powerbook (my biggest error, sigh)\nand then rebooted the whole set up and... chimes of death.\nI get the following sad mac error, \n00000F\n000003\nI ran Norton and it claims its a bad SCSI driver and suggests replaceing it.\nI used Apples Disk Tools but I couldn't update the hardrives SCSI driver\nas it claimed it was in use, but I couldn't even mount the thing (though\nI could see it when checking the SCSI bus, after turning it on after booting\nmy machine first).\n\nWhat does that error above refer to?  Am I on the right track?  Is there\nanything I can do short of intialising the drive, since I need the data\non there!

Ah... Ok. I didn't realize that you were talking about an Apple\ndivision other than AppleUS. AppleUS, being the main division, is the\none that contains what most people feel are the correct names and\nconfigurations for the majority of Apple customers, and it is generally\nassumed that you are talking about AppleUS when you just say Apple. At\nleast that's how it has always been in this newsgroup. All other Apple\ndivisions are, apparantly, free to change names and configurations if\nthey feel like it. I know that Apple Canada does this kind of stuff all\nthe time. It's not a mistake, it's Apple Sweden giving a different name\nto an Apple product other than what AppleUS calls it.

We are having a problem with a Quadra 950 that has stumped a couple of\ntechs sent to us by the vendor, as well as us :-)\nThis Quadra is 'stuffed' with 64Mb RAM, 2Mb VRAM and some large disk (400Mb\nI think). What happens is that after a certain variable interval of time\nthe video circuitry 'loses' vertical sync. It is quite apparent that the\nMac CPU is still ok, and the problem really seems to lie with the video\ncircuitry, since you can still save your documents, quit your aplpications,\neven pull down menus etc. (only the display is scrolling lik crazy, so it's\npretty hard to hit menu items ;-)\nWe had the original logic board replaced twice now, and the same problem\nhas been occurring on all boards although the inteval between occurrences has\nvaried. The first board had this problem every about 1hr, more often if the\ncache was turned OFF (yes OFF).  This is the only symptom that is not\nobviously related to the video circuitry (after all the cache is on the CPU\nright?). The second board had the problem every about 10 minutes (we did\nnot keep it, rather we put the original back), the current board we have\nhas this problem a lot less often (has gone about a week without doing it,\nbut did it twice within an hour yesterday).\nThe technicians that have come out to try to figure it out seemed pretty\nsharp and tried a number of sensible things (most of which we had\npreviously tried ourselves anyway). These included:\n-swapping the RAM\n-swapping the VRAM\n-swapping monitors (3 different 13" Apple RGB and 2 16" Apple RGB)\n-swapping cables\n-disconnecting HD and booting from floppy\n-sacrificing various small mammals\nHere are some other facts:\n-when we put a RasterOps ProColor 32 on the NuBus, the problem is fixed\n (it does not occur with the internal video or the ProColor video out)\n-the vendor cannot reproduce the problem back in their shop on the boards\n that exhibit it in our lab\n-Apple is said to be getting a little bit pissed off at shipping us boards\n that they cannot find anything wrong with, and getting them shipped back as\n faulty according to us.\nHere are some speculations:\n-I bet that neither Apple nor the vendor has tested these boards with that\n much RAM and VRAM on them simultaneaously, which may have something to do\n with their finding it hard to reproduce the problem (though we can\n reproduce it with just 4Mb of RAM, so this is probably a red herring).\n-the vendor's representative blames 'metal in your walls' - claims that our\n walls have metal in them which interferes with the Mac's operation. We\n have another 950 in the lab which works like a charm (though it's not in\n the exact same spot....) Please don't tell me this is probably it, I do\n not want to believe it.\n-it's probably not poltergeists, since they do not have badges to get past\n security at the entrance to our site.\n\nHas anyone any ideas? Please? Please email as well as posting cause I seem\nto be spending a lot of time rebooting my mac lately and have a lot less\ntime available to read news! :-)\nThank you in advance.\nCarlo Tiana\nNASA Ames Research Center\ncarlo@vision.arc.nasa.gov
A friend of mine who owns a pc said that he recently got a program that can\nformat a disk that can exceed the normal capacity of a HD disk. Apparently it\nrewrites the driver or takes or the driver or _something_ that allows it get\nmore space out of a normal HD floppy disk.  It supposedly gets upto 1.6 Megs\n(so something like 1640K?). I don't have the program - since I can't use it\nand its supposed to be called something like "FORM16" or something like that.\n\nMy question is whether its possible to do this on the Mac and if its not\npossible is it due to hardware limitations. A developer friend of mine said\nthat it might be possible but he doesn't deal with this aspect of the field\nmuch.\n\nThanks for any information contributed.

Hi-\nDoes anyone out there know how I would get started on writing a\ndevice driver for the Apple CD300 CD-ROM drive, which *can*\nread audio CD formats out through the SCSI bus?
A lot of the time, when you're dealing with someone who has no financial  \ninterest in selling you the machine, you get a lot of opinion (as opposed  \nto factual information, etc.).  What it sounds like to me is that this guy  \nhas had an experience with one flaky Centris 610 and formed an  \nall-encompassing opinion on the rest of the 610's.  I've seen lots of  \npeople who frustrated me to no end because they refused to believe any  \nother Mac Xyz would be any good, since their experience (with >one<  \nmachine) with a Mac Xyz had been bad.  Their loss, eh?
What is the real story here? Can I hook up any PC SVGA Montitor to the\nCentris internal video? Do I need to make my own cable if it doesn't not\ncome with one? Has apple released a Tech note with the pinouts for doing\nsuch? The reasoj I ask is that it seems the prices for SVGA are lower than\nthat of their mac counterparts...\n--mike

I have also moved on to a 66.6 mhz clock. Thus far not problems. I'm not totallysurprised as I've had Q700 run at 35.4 mhz (CPU clock speed) using a VSO.

The combination is faster than a Q950.
Hello\n	I recently accelerated my Mac Plus (MicroMac 25MHz accelerator) \nand now I can't get my Mac to boot off of the hard disk.  It boots fine \nfrom a floppy, and I can mount the hard disk using SCSI probe, but I \ncannot get it to boot from the hard drive.  I installed a new driver, so I \ndon't think that is the problem.  \n	This poses a rather large problem.  I only have 4 Meg of RAM, and \nI need to run Mathematica, which requires 5 Meg.  I was hoping to use \nsystem 7 virtual memory so that I could run Mathematica.  However, I can't \nrun system 7 from a floppy, so I can't get enough RAM.  \n	Any suggestions?

OK, if I post where this comes from, will people stop sending email \nasking where I negotiated the deal? ;-)\n\nThe deal is from "International Computer and Networking" in CA.\n(I saw the ad int he back of MacWorld and MacUser)...\nphone number is 310-441-9181 and the deal may have changed since\na few weeks ago, since they change prices about every ten minutes ;-)\n\nAlas, this is a funny system, it SOUNDS like a good deal, but this is a \nCentris 650, 4MB (on the motherboard) 4MB SIMM, 80MB HD, NO ETHERNET\nand NO COPROCESSOR (well, actually it's a 68LC040 instead of a 68RC040,\n'just had to say that to keep people from saying "there is no such thing\nas an '040 without a coprocessor, since the FPU is built into the chip")\n\nOK, there ya have it, but if I were you, I would wait untill the cyclones\ncome out and buy a Quadra 800 ;-)\n\n-nate

Don't be silly.\n\nUsing the Sound Manager on a Quadra is very well, but using SM on\nany of the low-end machines doesn't simply work for a decent action\ngame since it just steals too much time from the CPU. This is\na fact. By writing directly to the hardware on an SE, it is\npossible to have 4 simultaneous channels of sampled sound (11kHz) for\na cost of approx. 8000 cycles. Exactly how would you do that using\nthe SM, pray tell?\n\nThe correct thing to do is to use the SM on the machines that can\ncarry that extra load using the SM means, and to write directly\nto the sound hardware on the machines that can't. It's not the\npolitically correct thing, but from the developers' point of\nview it is.

This is completely false.\n\n\nThis is also false. What you need for multisession capability is\nmultisession capability -- which is based on the firmware and\nelectronics, not the drive speed. I'll admit, though, that I have\nnot seen a multisession capable drive that isn't double speed.\n\n\nThe above (1 & 2), proves 3 to be false.\n\nThe Apple CD300 is an excellent double-speed multi-session PhotoCD\ncapable drive. So are drives based on the slightly-faster Toshiba\nXM3401. Some companies selling such drives are: Spin Peripherals (a\nbargain at $499) and PLI (a company I hate) and Relax Technologies\n(a company I know little about other than that they are  a longtime\nplayer in Mac mailorder, which is usually a good sign). The NEC\nCDR74 is also a good choice (NEC's own mechanism, I think). ClubMac\nsells it for around $619.\n\n\nYour welcome, ooh but now I see your from Germany. Most of the\nmailorder info does you little good, I guess. If not:\nSpin Peripherals -- 800-466-1200\nClub Mac         -- 800-258-2622\nRelax Tech       -- 510-471-6112\n\nNothing wrong with the Apple, though, which is based on a Sony\nmechanism and speed-identical to the NEC. The Toshiba's speed\nadvantage is very slight: 20% in average access time (a minor plus)\nand 10% in data transfer rate (a slightly more important plus).

I have a Logitech 256grays hand scanner from a PC.  I'm wondering if anyone\nhas been successful in connecting the scanner to a mac?  It has the same\nconnector and is a serial device on the pc.  I can imagine the pins coniguration would need to changeed, but I'm not sure if the signal levels would be correct,\nand if the mac s/w would work with it.  \n\nOf course the manuals say nothing about the interface, connector layout or\nanything H/W-ish!\n\nAny ideas??\n\n\nthanx,
You may have been emailed this, but the IIsi's power supply is not rated to\nhandle the GC board.  Remember when the si came out and everyone complained\nabout it's power supply.  This is one result of apple providing a low-cost\ncomputer and I think they got a lot of flack for having a relatively high end\ncomputer (at the time anyways) that couldn't even support their own video\nboard.  Even if this isn't what is causing your problems, you might develop\none later.
Well the monitor is consistently the largest power drain on your\nelectric bill when you are looking at your computer set-up, especially\nif you have a large (16" or greater) color monitor. Generally what I do\nis leave my Mac on all the time, except for the occasional resart or\nsyetem crash, but I turn my monitor off each night before I leave my\noffice. I also turn off After Dark when I do this, since there is no\nreason to have the screen saver running when there is no picture being\ndisplyed on the monitor's tube.\n\n\n    Really? What makes you think this? The Q700 file server in my office\nhas been on for the last 2 months, straight, and it hasn't had any\nproblems. (Note: I also keep the monitor for the file server turned off\nwhen I'm not actually working on the server itself.)
OK...here is my question.  I want to hook up my PowerBook 160 to\na SVGA monitor but I do not want to buy the PowerBook/DOS Companion.  Can\nanyone tell me the EXACT cable I need to connect them?

I recently bought a PLI 21mgbyte floptical drive, and I was very happy \nwith it until I tried to use it to format a 1.4 HD diskette. I put the\nHD floppy in my Superdrive to check that the floptical had formatted it\ncorrectly, and now my Superdrive refuses to recognize ANY floppy (it says\n"this disk is unreadable" and asks if I want to format it) even original\nsystems floppies from Apple. Nor will it format the disks if I try to\n("initialization failed!")  Strangely enough the floptical still reads\nboth the 21 MB and 1.4 HD disks, but I cant look at my 800k floppies, and\nif I have a crash I'm screwed because the Floptical can't be used as a\nstart-up disk.

Hi,\n\nI have been told by a local sales that Asante has come out with this\nLCIII PDS Ethernet adapter with an optional 68882 socket on the board.\nMy question is will the FPU performance degrade will I put the 68882\non the PDS card socket instead of on the motherboard itself? Intuitively,\nthe math co-processor should always be placed close to the CPU, but\nI am not sure how good Apple's so-called processor-direct slot is when\nit comes to throughout. Does anyone know the answer to this or have\nany experience with the Asante LCIII Ethernet adapter? Thanks in advance.\n\nAndy
Um... they've sold the Cray. They realised that spending two years on\nnumbercrunching the finite stress analysis figures for the complex\ninjection-molded cases was not the way to go, and was holding up\ndevelopment work.\nEspecially when the first FEA model for the portable left out the battery\ncover, and it had to be redone. That's why the portable was about three\nyears late.\n\nDesigning metal cases is easier - they're managing with the Calculator DA,\nnow it can compute 45/100-0.45 correctly.\n\nAny other suggestions?

Wrong, the CD300 (external) is just a plain ol' SCSI device.\n\n\nNo, multisession capability and double speed are two different thing.  Its just  \nthat the newer CD ROM drives have both capability.  Multisession means that  \nwhen you put more pictures on a photo CD after the first session, the drive can  \nread and display them.  Double speeds just transfer ANY type of data (excluding  \nsound) at around double the speed.\n\n \nCD150 is not multisession capable.  This means that you lose the ability to add  \nany more pictures after the first time (must buy a new CD).  Finally, since the  \nCD150 is not a double speed drive, it will require twice as long to transfer  \ndata (excluding sound).

A local dealer is offering Mac II vi machines equipped with Kodak multi-\nsession compatible CD-ROM drives for what seems like an attractive price:\n$1500. I've used many other models up to a II ci, but this would be the\nfirst I could have my own Mac. Is it safe to buy an about-to-be discontinued\nmodel such as this. I'd like to yank the CD-ROM drive out, put it in a\nhousing and share it with my PC. Is this feasible?

The most likely explanation may have something to do with the fact that a\ngreater density of information exists on the larger capacity disk drive than\nthe smaller one. If your running the drive on a Mac I would recommend a\nshareware utility called Timedrive which tests seek, SCSI throughput and\nrotational speed.

Sounds to me like your dealer really wants to get rid of the IIvx's he has in\nstock.  I can imaging that they are getting hard to sell, given that \n 1. a C610 is way faster, and is comparable in price.\n 2. an LCIII is about the same speed, and is way cheaper.\nSo your dealer may well be trying as hard as he can to convince people\nthat IIvx's are a much better buy than a C610 just so he can get rid of all\nhis old stock!\n\nNo disrespect to dealers or the IIvx intended!
Well,\n\n    You can always try and find a PC dealer who sells guaranteed memory.\nI work at a company growing at 40% a year, we have on order hundreds\nof computers per year.  It never fails, machines come in with BAD SIMMS.\nNow for those of you who are wondering just WHY your PC or MAC just crashed\nI can tell you I always thought it was the incompetent ass who wrote or\ndesigned the software.\n    Well, I don't think that way anymore, especially with the results I\nhave gotten with replacing BAD SIMMS in my own machine and others at work.\nThe moral to this story is to MAKE SURE your memory is good.  I would\nbe willing to bet lots of you out there have SIMMS with either soft\nor hard errors on them and you don't even know about it, but every once\nin awhile those bad SIMMS just makes your life hell.\n   \nI just got plain SICK of dealing with peoples complaints that thier machine\njust crashed and they lost thier work.  In case your wondering, or if you\nhaven't already guessed I work in an IS department.  Service is a do or die\nperogative in this line of work, so the MORAL IS:  HAVE YOUR MEMORY TESTED\nwith a SIMM hardware tester...and NO I don't mean the simple little software\nprograms that you can run in your machine.  SIMMS are complicated little\nbeasts and they needs special hardware to test them effectively.\n\nIf any of you are interested in getting one of these nifty little devices\nwhich are not cheap, write me back.  They make life a little bit easier, and\nbesides they pay for themselves in a short time from the loss of productivity\npeople would have to deal with when thier machine commits suicide.

I posted on here about a problem with a Datadesk 101e keyboard that\nfailed to rebuild the desktop with the command-option keys pressed\nor to shut off inits when pressing the shift key.  After absolutely\nno help from Datadesk I called MacConnection tech support.  They tried it out\non their Centris 610 and had the same problem.  They immediately offered\nto get a new keyboard, try it on their Centris and ship it to me\novernight if it worked.  I could send them my keyboard back after I\ngot the one that worked.  This is from a guy in Tech support named Dave.\nIt turns out that the keyboard will wrok if you wait for the smiley face\nbefore pressing the shift key to disable inits and wait for the inits to start appearing to rebuild the desktop by pressing command-option.  I really like\nthis keyboard so I was glad to be able to keep it.  On the other hand,\nDatadesks tech support sucks while MacConnection's is great!\n-Terry

I can produce similar artifacts.\n\nI am using a Centris 610 with an Apple 16" monitor.  I got the 8/230/CD\nconfiguration, so there is on-board ethernet and 1 Megabyte of video ram.\nThe effect only occurs in 256 color and 256 grey modes.  Any vertical scrolling operation, whether with a scrollbar or, say, using vi and inserting lines,\nwill produce a scattering of horizontal flickering lines on the screen.\nThey do not persist -- each is visible for perhaps one refresh, and then\nthat part of the screen is back as usual.\n\nThey seem to always start at or about the 64th pixel from the left,\nand are maybe 512 pixels wide.  This is certainly not preventing me from\nusing my Macintosh ;-), but it does seem to be a sign of something\nperhaps grounded incorrectly in the video circuitry...\n\n\nI went ahead and called the Apple Customer Assistance Center, at:\n  1-800-776-2333, or 1-800-767-2775 (more direct?)\n\nThe person who answered was polite :-).  I also took the chance to complain\nabout my mouse button sticking, and about the mac hanging on boot after a\n(hard - killed MacsBug) crash which left a CD in the drive.  (I had to play\nwith a paperclip for about 5 minutes to get thing to eject, after which the\nmac booted fine.)

I just thought I would pass along my experience with APS. I recently ordered\n an external Quantum 240. The salesperson was friendly and knowledgeable, the\n order came when promised, and the invoice was at the price quoted. \n\n Installing the drive was simple; I didn't even have to read the manual. The\n SCSI address is set by a pushbutton arrangement. I daisy-chained the drive\n from my Syquest (also from APS) and booted up with no problems. \n\n I'm still going through all the shareware that comes on the drive. It's a\n pretty good assortment.\n\n The drive/fan is a bit noisier than I would like, but I think it'll be OK.\n The speed seems very good, although I haven't run any objective tests. It\n also seems to spin up pretty quickly; I can hit the power switch for it, and\n almost immediately power the Mac without any problems booting from the drive.\n\n Some observations: the case is plastic (good quality, though) while my older\n Syquest case is metal. There is one LED, which is normally green, and\n flickers red as the drive is accessed.\n\n Just a data point,\n Rich

I ordered an external floppy drive from them 2 years ago.  When I placed\nthe order, they said it was in stock and would ship the next day.  A week\npassed and no drive.  I called them up and they said they were out of stock\nand my drive should ship in 2 weeks or so.  Since I needed the drive right\naway (both my internal hard drive and floppy were dead) I cancelled my\norder and haven't dealt with them since.
I'm currently trying to select which magneto-optical drive to purchase.  I'm\nprimarily looking at 128MB drives, although I might consider 256MB ones.\n\nWhen looking through MacWorld and MacUser ads, the prices for the 128MB drives\nseem to range from just under $1000 (for the DGR 128REM Portable, Magic 128MB\nPortable Fujitsu, or NuDesign 128MB from MacDirect) to about $1600 (for the\nFWB HammerDisk 130 and Mass Microsystems DataPak MO/128).  Different drives\nuse different mechanisms - MOST, Fujitsu, Sony, Epson, probably some others.\n\nMy problem is that after reading the Nov 92 MacWorld and Apr 93 MacUser\nreviews of these drives, I'm still not sure what to get.  So, I'm asking\nif anyone has had good/bad experiences with any 128MB M-O drive or can shed\nsome light on the wide range of prices (is spending more really buying me\nmuch?), reliability of different drives, compatibility between them, or \nanything else I should probably know.\n\nThanks.
I'm not an expert, but having spent much too much of my life looking for\nthe power switch, or the brightness control, or the de-gauss, etc., etc.,\netc. it is my firm belief that the only reason any\ncontrols/switches/knobs/whatever in places where they are hard to reach is\nbecause the designers put them there deliberately.\n\nThe real question is weather this is because of stupidity, or\nmaliciousness.\n\n--
So is there any problems putting a drive formatted vertically on\nits side horizontally?\n\nI got a drive a few years ago with the rubber feet on the side,\netc. and have used it like that since (obviously designed for that\norientation).

So is my old, 70 meg\ndrive as fragile (or not) as a new 200 meg drive?\n\nJust curious.....

I've been playing with a centris 610 (8/230) for the last couple weeks.  The only\nproblem that I have seen is that a couple of the applications I run are\nincompatible with the 040's processor cache, so I have to run with it turned off.\nActually, the main thing I don't like it is that it doesn't have a software\npowerup/powerdown, and the power switch is DIRECTLY UNDER THE FLOPPY DRIVE!  (I\nhaven't hit it thinking it would eject the disk, but some tired night I'm going\nto be really upset with that design decision.....)\n\nIn all, no problems with it. floppy and printing have been just fine.  (printing\nis done across a localtalk net, not a directly connected printer)
What is the real story here? Can I hook up any PC SVGA Montitor to the\nCentris internal video? Do I need to make my own cable if it doesn't not\ncome with one?

I think the\n800x600 requires 56Khz horizontal sync.  I use this on my sony 1604. \n(gives a slightly wider screen than the 832x624 adaptor.
I have some questions about this subject.  I like to leave my\ncomputer on if I think I'm going to be using it withing the next 2 or\n3 hours, but I get sick of my Dad constantly coming up to me and\nasking "Why is the computer on if you're not using it?"  I also\nwonder about my computer being harmed by fluctuations in voltage from\nother things (garbage disposal, etc.)  Here are my questions:\n \nHow much harm do voltage fluctuations cause?  My computer does not\nshare a circuit with anything big but our my light dims when a\nrefrigerator comes on or the garbage disposal is turned on (whose\ndoesn't?), and also when the washing machine does anything.  All\nthese things cause a drop in voltage which is harmful to a computer,\nright?  I also notice the fan in my System Saver turning at different\nspeeds.  Is it safer to turn it off and back on when I want to use it\nor to leave it on?\n \nHow much electricity does my computer use?  I have an Apple IIgs (ne\nflames), with a Kensington System saver GS (1 electric fan inside),\nan AppleColor RGB monitor, and an EXTERNAL 3.5" HD (1 fan and its own\nP/S).  How do I translate this into Kilowatt-Hours?  Also, how much\nof this is used by the monitor?\n \nDoes the monitor use considerably less juice when the screen is\ntotally black but still on?\n \nMany computers spin the HD up and down constantly to save power.  I\nalways thought this was harmful to the HD and defeats the purpose of\nleaving the computer on in the first place (except portables).  Is\nthis true?\n \nThanks for the Info.  I think this will help lots of people.

It will be even more\nso in the future.\n       If your interested in cutting edge type of stuff and you\nchoose CS as I did, I suggest checking out the emerging field\nof Software Engineering.  The difficulties for example of designing\nscaleable design environments for individuals so that a single person\ncan handle 100,000 to 1,000,000 million lines of code all by himself\nin a reasonable manner and then incorporate that into a teamwork enviroment\nis truly a gigantic problem...not going to be solved any time soon\nunfortunately...but hey you could be the person that provides\nthe missing key for some good groundwork!\n\n\nWell, if your like the poor slobs in the world..like me, you are\nin no financial position to continue Graduate work right out\nof a Top 10 comp sci school.\n\nThe trick is, to find some generous INC you work for to PAY for the\nrest of your education...TRUST ME its the best way to go..even\nif you don't get a TOP salary.  Which I have always been a poor\nslob throughout school but if you follow this rule: BOOK=SALARY=FOOD&SHELTER\nyou should always have a computer and you won't go hungry.\n\nWhat else could a man want?!

Thank you very much. These computers behave exactly like what \nyou're describing. Now, my question. I am running on the lowest of all \nbudgets, public education. How can I analyze this?

Thanks for the enlightening post.  Is there a Technical Note on this?\n\nThe desktop machine I was referring to was actually not a Mac,\nbut rather, any of various workstations that use the\n68030@25MHz, such as old Suns or old NeXTs.  I used to own a NeXT\n68030 cube.   \n\nBut I will try rebooting without extensions to see what kind of\na speed difference I get with my powerbook Duo. I did notice an\nextreme slowdown to unusability with a Mac Plus after\ninstalling system 7 on it.  Why does the OS suck up so much CPU\npower? \n\nAlso, you're right--software does make a HUGE difference.  I\nhave the misfortune of using MS-Works on my Duo.  When editing\nrelatively small (40K) files, cut or copy takes several\nseconds, often more than 6 seconds!!  This happens with power\ncycling turned off.  As usual, MS software is maggot-infested\nfeces. \nI'm getting Nisus to replace it for my text editing.

Last week's MacWEEK article by Ric Ford indicated that David Ramsey's\nMac IIx has been running nicely with a Mac IIci ROM in it, offering\nclean 32-bit ROM code (liberating his IIx from the virtual memory\nnightmare caused by Apple's 32-bit System Enabler).\n\nDoes anyone know of a source for these ROMs?  Is it okay for a\nremanufacturer to resell only ROM chips from used machines?  I know that\ncopies cannot be made, but it seems to me that it would be okay to\nresell the original used ROM.  (After all, reselling a used computer\ninvolves the sale of the ROM anyway, so what's the difference?).\n\nNeedless to say, I'm interested in purchasing such a ROM.  What would\nbe a reasonably price to offer?

I bought a StyleWriter II a couple months ago, and lately, when I print\nsomething, I notice white lines or "gaps" running through the line being\nprinted.  It's almost like the paper is advancing a smidge too far when\nadvancing lines.  \n\nI replaced the ink cartridge thinking it might be the problem, but the lines\nare still there.  Has anyone else noticed this problem?  What's the best way to\nget rid of it?
From article <1993Apr22.165659.8890@desire.wright.edu>, by demon@desire.wright.edu (Not a Boomer):\n\nHmmm... that's not quite right.  The Performa 600 is Real Darn Close\nto the IIvx (but a better buy IMO).  I also don't think they are so\nmuch a 'low-cost business solution', but a low-cost _home_ solution.\nWhy else bundle at ease (among other things)?  Hardly a business\napplication. \n\nWhat do you mean by 'no "retail price"'.  Quite the contrary, I think.\nThe price is darn near the same all across the country.  That (again,\nIMO) was one of the selling points of the performas -- ie: no haggling\nrequired.  Kinda like the Saturn (car) of the computer set.  One\nprice, medium performance, ready to go.\n\nWhen I shopped for my Performa (600CD), the difference between Sears\n(*sigh), Montgomery Wards, Silo (*sigh), Circuit City (*sigh*) and\nBizmart (*sigh*) couldn't have been $100.00.  Why I chose one over the\nother was based solely on availability and a friendly salesman who\nwent the extra mile (when did you last hear that about someone who\nsells Apples?).  Admittedly, except for Montgomery Wards (and I\nsuspect I was just lucky) all of the salesfolk I spoke to didn't know\ndidly about the computers, peecee or mac.  But then, neither did any\nof the  Apple dealers I spoke with...\n\nIf you would've told me a year ago that I would buy a Macintosh from\nMontgomery Wards I woulda laughed for a long, long time.  Go figure.\nI'm *real* happy with my Performa.  Oh, and I bought the Apple\nPerforma Plus monitor (vs. buying 3rd party).  Happy with that\ndecision as well.  I walked in, plopped down some cash, and walked out\nwith a spankin' new computer the day before Christmas.  \n-- \n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nInstrument Approach Procedures Automation             DOT/FAA/AMI-230
Hello. I have a question (or two) about the serial ports for the\npowerbooks (specifically the 145 with system 7.0.1). Is there a\ndifference between the serial ports on the powerbooks versus\nany other mac, say plus or ii?? I have heard, though not confirmed\nby apple that the serial ports have problems at high speeds.\n\nI also heard that sys 7.1's new power manager 'fixes' this problem\nallowing speeds just as any other serial port.\n\nMy particular use is that I have a 6811 EVB board that I need to\ninterface with my powerbook via the modem port at 9600 baud. \nCurrently, we are interfacing using mac pluses.  I set everything\nup just as in lab and nothing.  In fact, the powerbook locks up.\n\nCan anyone help, inform, advise? I would appreciate it.  \nI would prefer email since I don't read the news at all.\nI will post a summary if enough response is generated.\n\nThanks. \n\nFaisal M. Bhamani\nfaceman@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu
I have an Ethernet card that i took out off an old LC. The card\n	is manufactured by Asante. On it i can read:\n	"Asante Tech, inc. Copyright 1991.

It provides thin Ethernet connector\n	and there's another connector on it which resembels to phone connectors.\n\n	My questions are:\n	- Will this card work on any other model than LC-serie ?, given that\n	it's a PDS card, will it work with the IIsi PDS slot ?. I think there\n	may be a probleme because the LC has 16 bit wide slots.\n\n	- What's that other conncetor on the card ?.\n\n	_ Is anyone interested in it ?. I can ship it to any CEE country.

Hi, there!\nI have a MAC LC and consider buying CD300. I've been told,\nhowever, that:\n1. The double speed of CD300 is achievable only on machines\n   with SCSI-2.\n2. The double speed is a prerequisite for PhotoCD multisession\n   capability, which I need.\n3. Which means I seem to gain nothing compared with, say CD150.\n\nAny comments?\nThanx.
No.  I recently bought an LC II with a 14" monitor.  The monitor comes with\nthe type of power cable that plugs into the switched outlet on the back of\nmost larger Macs.  Since the LC II doesn't have one of these outlets, there\nwas an extra standard power cable included with the computer for use with\nthe monitor.  But it was in the computer box, not the monitor box.  It's\nnot as if the cables are particularly expensive, though.  $10-$15 at the\nmost.
It probably won't work with any other LC.  The ones I have for the LC II\nare Rev. D.  No, it won't work in the IIsi's PDS slot since it's a 68030\nPDS, while the LC has the 68020 PDS.  The IIsi and SE/30 share the same\nkind of card.\n\nThat's the 10BaseT ethernet connector.

I have a question for y'all:\n\nI'm looking at an ad for the new 3.5" FAST SCSI-2 drives from Micropolis\nin the June, 1993, MacWorld. (I have seen similar ads for the IDE versions\nin IBM PC magazines)\n\nWell, the ad says that all three drives have a FAST SCSI-2 interface,\nbut then it says that the DTR rate for each drive is 5 megabytes/second,\n*max*.\n\nHow can this be?  I thought that if a drive was to be FAST SCSI-2 it\nhad to have a DTR of 10megs a second?\n\n(I am assuming the 5megs/sec claim by Micropolis is from the 512k cache.\nI admit that I would be very impressed if the drive can *read/write* data\nat 5megs a second!)

Has anyone heard of a SCSI device that can capture video? \n\nWe need some sort of device that can capture about 10 frames or so per\nsecond, and work off the SCSI bus. The idea is to use it for some sort of\nvideo\nconferencing application.
Huh?  Where did you get this idea from?  I think you got this\nbackwards.  The Duo's memory is faster than its equivalent desktop\nmachine by 5-10% (and the rest of the powerboks). I think the\nexplanation for this was that it can refresh faster (in 2 instead of 5\ncycles I believe).  Things that could affect performance would be\nfactors such as use of functions enhanced in the FPU (which the Duo\ndoesn't have undocked).  Extensions and background applications can\nslow your computer down too.  Real life differences in speed are likely\nto be influence by the software you are running, what kind of screen\ndepth you are running etc.\n\nEspen
Yes, and one thing to think about is the pricing on the 160M harddrive \nconfiguration.  When I got my lowly classic II, the options were 40 or 80M\nharddrives, and it was clear that buying another 40M of harddrive space \nwould cost *much* more than the difference in price between the two config-\nuartions.  There is an analogous break in the LCIII/80 and 160 prices, and \nyou will not regret spending the extra money for a larger harddrive.  \n\nParticularly if you ever wind up wanting to use SoftPC, which sets up a\nseveral-MB (up to 30!) partition, or if you are generating large files \nwith DTP software, or if you might ever want to check out a mac unix-like \nos, like MachTen, having the extra space will be helpful.  when you are \npricing used IIci's, look at the harddrive size they come with, and how much\nit would cost you to add more storage down the road... (Might be a \nuseful bargaining strategy even if you see no reason to go over 80M, though\nI must admit that I am such a packrat that within 6 months of getting my \ncomputer, I was backing up a lot of stuff to floppies that I rarely use to \nbecause I was running out of space, without having started using DTP stuff, \nsoftPC or trying any unix os!)
I think the subject title says it all. Anybody that relies on a SCSI dick\nfor stoarage is a pain in the ass!!

Larger drives tend to have multipule platters which can allow adjacent\nbits to be read in parallel resulting in higher throughput.  They also\nhave higher spindle speeds which leads to both increased throughput and\nreduced seek times (due to reduction of rotational latency.)
My recently modified Quadra 700 with a socket for clock oscillators has now\ncompleted nearly 40 hours of error free operation at 32 mhz (with a 64 mhz\nclock oscillator). I have also tried a 55 mhz CMOS clock and that works as well.\nOn the more stupid side, I've discovered you can use a 40 mhz clock and make\nyour Q700 as slow as a Centris 610. However, a 25 mhz clock which would have\nyielded a 12.5 mhz Quadra 700 (Who'd want one?) didn't work at all.
THe origional bit is missing but long/short follows:\n\n    The origional poster asked if he/she could use any old vga/svga\nmonitor with a centris (hence title).  \n\n    The answer ot this question is an unqualified yes.  You can use any\nold vga/svga monitor with a centris.  You do need an adaptor (I use a\nMac vga-q from james engineering (510) 525-7350) to run between the two\nmachines.  THe adaptor I have mentioned will convert a centris to a\nthree row vga/svga 25(?) pin adaptor for your monitor.\n\n    NOW, the special interest disclaimer.\n The above answer is correct for using a vga monitor at 600x400\nresolution.  IF your monitor will sync to 56Khz horizontal the above\nadaptor will allow you to choose 800x600 resolution (I prefer this on my\n1604s).\n\nTHen You have the question of matching adaptors and sync rates.  I would\nadvocate calling James engineering because they seem to have a clue.  As\nto the comment by the person who said don't bother calling Apple because\nthey will treat you like an idiot this is totally untrue.\n    APPLE WILL TREAT YOU LIKE A F**KING ASSANINE IDIOT FOR EVEN\nCONSIDERING GOING THIRD PARTY AND IF YOU WANT THIS TREATMENT WANTS YOU\nTO PAY FOR THEIR THECH SUPPORT LINE (the supposedly compitantly one) AND\nTHEN STILL HAS NO FU***** CLUE.\n\npersonal experience.  also the tech suppport for the vga monitor makers\ndoesn't see to extend to Macs (Sony, Magnavox).  In addition to this to\nfind out the info you will have to call dealers unless you can find the\nsync rates elsewhere as ads like Hardware that fits\n(*&^%&%^%$$(&**&^(%&%^$!) that rate monitor resolutions give the most\nfavorable rating (which usually means you can get this if you use a\nspecialized application video card).(i.e. "well you can get a resolution\n1168x832 on this $5,  9" "super smelly sock" monitor that will let you\ndisplay TWO FULL PAGES side by side.  All you need is our reasonably\npriced "oder eater" video board for $27,000 and it will give you an\nultra fast horizontal sync rate of SIX fast kilohertz and three Khz\nvertical.")\n\n\n\nNote:  with the sony 1604 at least on the centris 610 built in video\nboard using an 832x624 adaptor, there is a boarder of an inch + to the\nsides of the image after adjusting the horizontal width as favorably as\npossible.  Using a 800x600 adaptor this can be reduced to about half an\ninch.
I recently made the mistake of purchasing a SONY CPD-1320 monitor for my\nMac IIci.  The monitor is very good, however it seems that the IIci does not\nsupport VGA (then why did you buy it you ask?  I am stupid I reply).  What I\nam looking for is a video card, preferably 8 bit, which supports VGA.  I am\ninterested in any information I can get.  Offers for the sale of applicable\ncards will also be considered.  \n\nThanks in advance.
Hi!!\nI have a question:\n   Which is the diference between Performa 450 and LCIII?\n   I want to know which is better.\n   If you know the specifications and the prices of this computers, can\nyou tell me by email to ----> rcvillab@isluga.puc.cl\n   I'd like to know the diference between the apple monitor('14) and the \nperforma monitor too.
Hi,\n\nCould some kind soul please e-mail me a copy of the pinout for the serial\nconnector on an ImageWriter II printer?  We have one that we'd like to hook\nup to a PC, and it seems that nobody sells the proper cables anymore.  No\nproblem -- I can make one, but I need to know the pinout first.\n\nThanks in advance.
I believe the FPU on the LCIII is always supposed to go on the logic\nboard, not in the PDS board. I have heard of crashing problems with\nPDS-based FPUs on the LCIII. Asante may have fixed them but why\nbother. Why bother building an LCIII card with an FPU anyway? The\nextra circuitry gives the card one more chance to fail. I say FPU on\nmain logic board, in socket, Ethernet alone on PDS card, in slot.
I have done several of these upgrades (about 6 IIsi's, and 1 Quadra 700), and\nthe best thing to use would be some sort of "heat sink compound". If possible,\nyou should look for the silicon-free stuff. There's a comany who makes the stuff\ncalled Tech Spray, their address is: P.O. Box 949, Amarillo, TX 79105.\n\nYou should be wary in using most kinds of tape; and definately don't use duct\ntape  that stuff is for ducts...\n\nWhen using the heat sink glue or compound, only use enough to fill the small\nspace between the heat sink and the CPU.\n\nMario Murphy
We are having problems with our Laserwriter print drivers going bad on\nvarious people's machines on our Appletalk network.

than\n\nFirst of all, I wouldn't advise wasting your time with Apple.  They'll\ntreat you like an idiot and you won't get any answers (a personal\nopinion).\n\nThe safest thing to do is match the SVGA monitor's scanning rates with\nApple's rates.  I don't know Apple's video scanning rates, but I use the\nMicron Xceed 30's rates, as they're a good approximation.\n\nAbout cables: you just have to go out to someplace like Fry's and get a\nfew Mac-VGA cables and try them out.  I have a ViewSonic 5E (14") and I\nuse an NEC adaptor.  Other monitors may use other adaptors.  I also have\na Mac->832x624 adaptor that tricks System into thinking the monitor is an\nApple 16".  I need to readjust the vertical and horizontal sizes but it\nworks fairly well.\n\n	"Just like everything else in life, the right lane ends in half a mile."
I have a few questions that I would like answers to \n(or opinions on) since I'm thinking about buying a LC-III:\n\nQ1) When the PowerPC-based Macs are announced, what will\nhappen to the 680X0-based Macs?  \n\nQ2) Is System 7 the 'last word' for 680X0-based Macs? \nWill we ever get REAL multi-tasking for the Mac?\n\nQ3) Will there be a way for NuBUS/PDS-equipped Macs to add \na PowerPC-on-a-board to their systems?\n\nI'd hate to think that I'm going to put my $$ down\non a machine that in 6 months is now part of a\ndead-end product line!\n\nThanks in advance,
Yup, I bought the darn thing cause it was sturdy. I carry it around in\nan unpadded (unless you consider all the papers and files and folders)\nbookbag (shoulder strap little job from Eddie Bauer). I've travelled\ncross country several times with Walkman, DiscMan and tapes, books and\ncomputer all piled in their. My PB100 works happily, and I'm typing on\nit right now... It has a Global Village Teleport 9600 V.32 internal\nsend/receive fax-modem, and I just love it.\n\nUnfortunately, I have seen a new Duo 230 that a friend bought as a\nprimary computer (I have a Mac IIsi and SE30 as primary home\ncomputers, and Quadra and IIci at work in the lab). And while amazed\nat the lightness of it, I was kinda shocked at the flimsiness of the\nscreen. I'm sure it'd break real easy....\nGeez, we are a Sony familly. Our neighbor works for Zeinth and hates\nit (always asks why we didn't buy Zeinth products). Nice guy\nnevertheless. We still have two working Sony Color Trinitrons from\n1972 and 1974. Older one is on it's second picture tube, but both\nwork. Now they're relegated to the old 8-bit atari computer and atari\n2600 game machinces, as well as our not-that-old younger sister's\nNintendo game machine. Sony doesn't make TV's like they used to\nthough, the newer Mexican assembly-line TV's are not that reliable or\nsharp anymore... Dad also just got a 35" direct-view Sony (god, the\nthing weighs a ton!). :)  Still, where would we be without Trinitrons,\nCD players, or the veritable Walkman????
There are two approaches:\n\n1. If your power cord is the kind that detaches from the back of the\nmonitor (most common) you can get a *replacement* power cord that will go\nfrom the monitor to the back of the computer.\n\n2. You can get an adpater that connects to the plug end of the existing\npower cord and provides the proper end that plugs into the back of the\ncomputer.
I guess he is right. Early versions of the RasterOps cards did not either,\nbut they fixed it, and people with problems can get a free ROM upgrade\nfrom RasterOps.\n\n\n\nVery easy. If you boot without the MODE32 control panel, then it will\ndisable (or rather not reinstall) the 32-bit clean patches. So when\nyou run OK you must be in 24-bit adressing mode. Check About this Macintosh\nand see if you havce a 12+MB system.\n\n\nsent seperately.
Hello out there!\n\nMy Mac IIsi runs a Radius Pivot LE monitor, with the PDS card.\n\nAs I wanted to try to switch to 32 bit adressing, i couldn't startup my Mac\nanymore.\n\n1.	What is the trick to zap the PRAM (so I won't have to take out the\nbattery next time)\n\n2.	Is there any trick that could allow me to switch to 32bit?\n\n3.	What does 32bit adressing bring to me as an user? faster work?\n\n4.	Any chance to have more than 8Mb of adressable memory with 24bit\nadressing?\n\nThank you a lot for your answers (via mail or reply)
Does anyone know how to zap the PRAM on the Duo 230. Inaddition I have recently\nnoticed that checking the ram left in the finder on the duo 230 4/80 \nreveals the normal 1800K for the system file but only about 1/10 to 1/5 of the\nbar is actually highlighted implying that only 2-300K is being used for the\nsystem. What gives? I have had no crashes yet or other software problem...
I believe that that would be the same as a system error #64. Since there is no\nerror #64, then I would guess that it would be a -64 error. Which is a font\nmanager error of "error during font declairation".\n\nI would assume that the system that's on the floppy that you are trying start\nup on has a corrupted font in it, or something like that.\n\nMario Murphy
The 486 at the same CLOCK is NOT as fast as the 040 at the same\nclock speed.  The '040 also has much better floating point unit.\nNow the DX2-66 is faster than the '040 at 33Mhz.  But for your\nreference the 486 at 33 mhz gets ~14MIPS while the '040 at\n33mhz gets ~20MIPS.
[ This would make me a bit suspect of Mr. Ramsey's qualifications\nas a self-styled "expert", in fact, when I read about anybody\nusing virtual memory regularly I kind of wonder ... ;-) ]\n\nYes, one can sometimes get away with running a newer ROM (of the \ncorrect size, obviously) in an older machine, but one should be \nprepared for problems if running software that checks for machine \ntype rather than ROM trap availability and then draws incorrect \nconclusions when special-casing - especially timing-dependent\nand driver-related stuff.\n\nIn this particular case I see no reason to go to the trouble \nof ROM-swapping.  The Apple 32-bit enabler has problems, but\nMODE32 works just fine with 7.0, 7.0.1, and 7.1.\n\n\nSure.  Buy a used IIci motherboard.  Call Pre-Owned Electronics,\nShreve, or other parts dealers (see the back of Computer Shopper\nor one of the Mac trades for phone numbers) and ask for a price\non a IIci ROM.  Everything has a price.  If you happen to find\nsomebody who salvaged a IIci with a dead motherboard, you might\nget a decent price.  There is probably a market for used mother-\nboards as well, so they might sell a ROM anyway.\n\n\nAsk for a quote and then try offering less?  Pre-Owned and\nShreve have been known to dicker.  Their ads in various trade\nmagazines often list considerably different prices for the \nsame items, and their phone quotes tend to vary as well.\n\nStill, I'm not aware of any technical reason for upgrading \nthe ROM in a IIx.
I have a Northern Telecom disk array dated 1987 that has two 253MB drives\nunits in it and I cannot get it formatted.  I set the SCSI ID on 1 and my\nsoftware recognizes the unit, but I cannot mount it or anything - do I have\nto use BOTH drives in the array? \n\n	Any help with these drives or possibly newer software than what I'm using\n(FWB HDT1.0 and 1.1) will be greatly appreciated!\n\n-grey
Here's another question by a hesitant Powerbook purchaser.\nI want to be able to run Mathematica and would like to hear some comments  \nfrom the gallery about this. How much slower does the program run on a  \nmachine without an FPU (namely a PB160) versus a machine with an FPU  \n(namely a PB170).  What types of calculations get bogged down the most. I  \nprimarily due moderately simple algebra, integrals which can be dealt with  \nanalytically and plotting including 3-d plots. I don't do a lot of  \nnumerical work. Would a PB160 with a lot of memory ( and the very nice  \nvideo port ) be sufficient or should I really try to get an FPU for this  \ntype of work? Is a PB170 with 8Mb faster than a PB160 with 12 or 16Mb.\nAll comments appreciated.
According to MacWeek of 2-22-93:\n\nThe Cyclone will come in the same metal minitower case as the Quadra\n800, while the Tempest will share the low-slung case of the Centris\n610. Apple will offer a miniature video camera that can be mounted\nabove the user's monitor or moved about on the end of its cable to take\npictures of objects or documents. Taking advantage of the 32-bit\ndigital signal processor (DSP) built into the systems' logic boards,\nthe camera will be able to put an image measuring 360 by 288 pixels,\nwith 256 gray levels, on the screen.\n\nUsers will be able to install supplementary lenses that can record\ndetail as fine as the wire bonds on an integrated circuit. The camera\nis expected to cost between $150 and $250.\n\nThe systems will ship with all the software needed to put Apple's\nCasper voice-recognition technology to work; users apparently will have\nto purchase an operational high-fidelity microphone.\n\nThe two models will talk as well as listen. A new system facility\ncalled the Speech Manager will convert text strings sent by\napplications to phonemes and then pass them to a speech synthesizer.\n\nThe Cyclone will include a 40MHz '040, three NuBus slots and support\nfor up to 128MB of RAM. The Tempest will use a 25MHz LC040, lacking an\nFPU, and hold up to 68MB of RAM; it will have a single slot that will\nrequire a NuBus adapter and have room for only 7-inch NuBus cards.\nUsers will be able to update the Tempest's process but not the\nCyclone's.
Performa 200 == Classic II\n	Performa 400 == LC II\n	Performa 4xx == LC III\n	Performa 600 == well, nothing :)\n\n	The Performas are made to be low-cost business solutions.  The 4xx have\nbundled software, modems, etc.\n	Because they have no "retail price" you might be able to get a steeper\ndiscount on them.  Shop around.\n\n	As far as the monitors go, buy 3rd party.  Much cheaper.
Has anyone dealt with First Tech based in Austin Tx?  \nIf so, what has your experince been?
Somebody in comp.multimedia was also having trouble using a Spigot in his\nLC III. It turned out he needed the latest version of ScreenPlay (1.1.1),\nwhich fixed things.

Hi,\nI'm having problems tying to get a Sony DAT drive to work.  I'm using\nRetrospect 1.3Ci,\nand my only luck with getting the drive to work has been with a Mac IIci,\nwhich has\nnow unfortunately gone to another department.\n  Ideally, we want to attach it to our Quadra 950 setup.  I can't seem to\nget the\nRetrospect software to recognize the media at all.  When in the "Devices"\ndialog,\nit can see the DAT device, but comes up with, firstly, 'Running', secondly\n'Media Failure' and then immediately 'Contents Unknown'.  This does not\nhappen with the\nMac IIci setup, which simply says 'Ready'.\n  I'm hoping someone else will have had similar problems but found some\nsolution... I \nknow some others who have had problems with DAT devices and their Quadra,\nbut they have\na Mac IIci which they can use!\n  \nTHE SYMPTOMS\nSystem software is 7.1, also didn't\nwork with 7.0.1\n  I have tried the following:\n  Turn off all extensions, except Retrospect SCSI (required)\n  Tested on a variety of machines:  Quadra, IIsi, and LC (at least).\n  Connected no other SCSI devices\n  Tested all varieties of SCSI termination etc.\n  Replaced the DAT unit with a new one (Yes!  we got that desperate!)\n  Read the Retrospect manual (EVEN MORE DESPERATE :))\n\nReplies via email would be greatly appreciated... thanks in advance. \nI'll post any\nsolutions to this group.\n\nCheers,\nMatt.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Here's the scoop:\n\nFor the past two years, I have been using an SE/30 with a Sony 1304s and\na Lapis video card.  This past month, I bought a Quadra 800 and am now \nusing the Sony on it.  My SE/30 has been shipped home to my father who\nis planning on getting an Apple 14" monitor (The Trinitron one).  My\nquestion is this:  What kind of power cord will he get with the Apple\nmonitor.  Does it come with two types?  As I recall, one can hook up the\npower cord of an apple monitor to the back of a machine such as my \nQuadra 800.  However, for my father's SE/30, there is no extra plug which\nallows use of the SE/30's power supply.  He needs to plug it into the\nsocket separately.  So...does the monitor come with a cable that will allow\nhim to do this?  Will have to buy a different cable?  IF yes, where can he\npurchase such a cable? or apple kind enough to provide both types of cables?\n\nThanks in advance,\nDerek\n\n\n\n\n******************************************************************************\n  DEREK FONG                           *   EMAIL: thewho@plume.mit.edu\n  Dept. of Physical Oceanography       *          thewho@darla.whoi.edu
(formerly Maya computer) advertised a DayStar 33 MHz PowerCache WITH\n68882 for $295!  Can you believe it?  I know prices would be falling,\nbut geeze!\n\nThought you might be interested...\n\nChuck\n\n\n-- \nChuck Williams ==> CS Intern ==> Pacific Northwest Laboratories
Actually, the 295 is for the 33 MHz PowerCard, not the Universal Powercache.\nThe 33 MHz Universal Powercache with FPU and adaptor can be had for about\n$500 (still not a bad deal).  I believe the Powercard is one generation \nolder than the Universal Powercache, and the one primary difference is that\nthe Powercard is machine specific while the Powercache can fit into many\nMacs with the proper adaptor.  Both cards are 68030 based.\n\nI'm not sure if the hardware or software with the Powercard is otherwise \ndifferent from the Powercache (perhaps someone could enlighten me?).\n\nI would also add that I called River Computer the other night and these\nPowercards were going very fast.
There seems to be a P\nPDS slot in the above printers. What is it ?
Cam,\n\nSeveral months ago I bought a 4/40 PB100 with external floppy, AppleTalk\nRemote Access, a Kensington case and AC adapter with complete documentation\nand in almost new condition, used for US$900. I considered it a very good\nbuy and am very *cosy* with my little baby now... :-)\n\nMurray
Gee, nice of them to tell us.  Like, how about a Gestalt response bit for\nthe\nGestaltPowerManagerAttributesFoodSpreadProduct selector?  Well, at least\nnow I know why it doesn't work (I assume; I 'm using a PB 145).
What paper is that? It's been on the price list here at Dartmouth\nsince they released it and it has never been called the "DuoDock Plus."
I'm planning on getting a StyleWriter II for my Mac SE (2.5 MB ram, HD, two\n800k floppy drives).  Do any of you out there have any recommendations as\nto whether running System 6.0.8 is better or worse than switching to 7.1.\nI don't do much real work on this machine any more, but would like to keep\nit for word processing (Using Word 4 and don't see much advantage to going\nto Word 5, since it is slower).\n\nAny help or comments would be appreciated.  Thanks in advance.
I read in MacWeek that some developers are getting NuBUS cards from apple\nwith pre-release PowerPC chips on them.  Does this mean that when the\nchip is released, those of us with old apples will be able to take\nadvantage of the PowerPC RISC technology just by inserting a card?\n\nI don't know anything about hardware, so can someone tell me how much of\na cludge this would be?

Put me down for a PB100 4/20 with ext. floppy, AppleTalk Remote Acces,\nAC adapter, and fresh out of box (was used, but buyer switched to 140\non arrival and sold unopened box. Purchased last October for $925.\nLater I bought a used PowerPort V.32 9600 bps internal fax-modem for\nsomething like $225, I'm using right now! Works great!  :)\n\nNo real complaints. I love my portable system (got a color home setup\nalso. Mac II). Reasoning was that MATLAB programs at school and other\nsimulations of dynamic control systems sometimes took hours (or\novernight) to run, tying up my Mac II. I got the PB100 with fast modem\nto do light work and on-the-run stuff. I figured I'd give it to my\nlittle sister next year when she goes to college. It's running System\n7.1 now without any problems. Also I sometimes do DEC4015 terminal\nemulations with MATLAB on our university's VAX_VMS (nice thing that it\nbenchmarks itself as an average of 230 times faster than a mac IIfx).\nSo, the PB100 just does graphical output and terminal emulation (not\ntoo hard at all for it). It was a FABULOUS setup !!!!  :)  Weeee!!!\n\n(By the Way, all MATLAB software was on class accounts. I was also the\nTA for a class that used SIMULAB/SIMULINK. We had site-license and\ntake-home, then-destroy later site-release licenses... No pirating\nthere, incase you're wondering.... Great Program!!! )\n\nJust like to add, whatever future system you get, you can almost never\nget enuff memory.... Buy it while it's cheap - that is buy it when you\nget the computer since it's usually cheaper than upgrading... I ALWAYS\nrun out of disk space... But I have a syquest on the Mac IIsi, so I\nnever worried about space before... Got several carts).
Hi,\n\n   I have been told by a local sales that Asante has come out with this\n   LCIII PDS Ethernet adapter with an optional 68882 socket on the board.\n   My question is will the FPU performance degrade will I put the 68882\n   on the PDS card socket instead of on the motherboard itself? Intuitively,\n   the math co-processor should always be placed close to the CPU, but\n   I am not sure how good Apple's so-called processor-direct slot is when\n   it comes to throughout. Does anyone know the answer to this or have\n   any experience with the Asante LCIII Ethernet adapter? Thanks in advance.\n\nFrom what I've heard the PDS slot clock is only 16MHz, to be\ncompatible with the old LC style boards, while the FPU socket close to\nthe CPU is clocked at 25MHz.\n\nI guess a board designed for the LCIII can get a 25MHz clock from the\nextended PDS socket...
Anyone know if there is an updated driver for Sony DAT drives?  I can't\nget mine to work with our 950 (see "Sony DAT / Retrospect Problems"\nposted in this group) but I'm also having problems with other new macs...\n\nCheers, Matt.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Has anybody heard about a thing called a MacWatch? I saw it on TV a\ncouple of years ago, it is a watch with a reviever and a transmitter for\nyour mac. The practical upshot is that your Mac can page your watch and\ndisplay a small message. My flatmate is off to the states for a week or\ntwo soon and I am interested in getting one. Any info would be\nappreciated.
I am using a NEC 4FG with my Centris 610. The cable adapter was provided by\nNEC (you have to call to get this free adapter). I am also sharing it with my\n486 (using a switch box and extra cables).\n\nMy questions: \n\n	How do you tell if it is 600x400 or 800x600 that was displayed?\n	Or how do you change the mode(resolution)? \n	Is there SW for this or something I have to do with the HW?\n\nI am assuming I am getting 800x600 since I have 1M VRAM and the 4FG can display\n1028x768(?) with my 486.
+ I am looking at a new LC III and a used IIci.  Prices\n\n+ The IIci has much greater potential for expansion, a la NuBus and\n+ greater memory capacity.\n\nHow important is this? How many NuBus cards do you have/plan to\nacquire? How much memory do you really need? I've got a ci, and\n20mb of ram. That's plenty. I also have a 24bit graphics card\non the NuBus - I'm a sucker for pretty pictures...I think the\nLCIII can have a bootable ramdisk in memory, which a ci can\nnot have. At least, not out of the box.\n\n+ The LC III would be new, under warranty, newer ROMs (is the IIci\n+ "32-bit clean"?), and would have sound input.  I also like the\n+ "pizza-box" case.\n\nThe ci is 32-bit clean. I solved the sound input problem with\na MacRecorder. But that's gotten to be a fairly expensive\nsolution now that Macromind owns MacRecorder.\n\n+ Performance-wise, I have read that they are almost identical, the\n+ LC III being a little slower.\n\nThe actual difference is probably not worth worrying over.\n \n+ So, which should I get?\n\nDepends on the price you can get the ci for. Educationally speaking,\nthe 4/80 [?] LCIII here at FSU can be had at just under $1300. Add\nin roughly $500 for a monitor. Last I'd heard, an 8mb LCIII simm\nwent for ~$250. \n\nI think you're in a win-win situation. No matter what you decide,\nyou'll most likely be happy with it.
My Centris 610 is working perfectly.  There is one problem that I have\nnoticed.  FastBack II backup utility does not work!!!  The strange thing\nis that it works with my friend's 610 most of the time, however, it never\nworks with my machine.  I assume it is some sort of software problem and\nnot hardware related.
I am boring my sister HP DeskJet 500C for the weekend and I was wondering\nin their was any drivers for it available some where that would allow\nme to use it with my Mac SE/30.  I have a copy of MacPrint but I do think\nthat I have a driver for the 500C.  I would be happy to get it working\nin black & white, but if there is away to get the color working that would\nbe better.  Any ideas someone?\n\nRegards,
From article <C5wDMK.Jrn@hawk.cs.ukans.edu>, by 3s737abg@hawk.cs.ukans.edu (Unknown Class User):\nSaying things like that incline one to believe that you can't get it (SCSI)\nto work for your setup (too bad). I've daisy-chained 4 SCSI devices off my\nmac without a problem (limit is 7 SCSI devices in the daisy-chain). If it\nisn't working for you, it's really better to state the problem (unless all\nyou really intend to do is try to get nasty e-mail, in that case perhaps you\nwould be better off posting to alt.masochistic type of newsgroup).\n  /`-_                   callan@csd4.csd.uwm.edu\n {     }/ Joel E Callan             Hey, why do you think I have the answer?\n  \   ./  2909 N. 44th Street         May you sit on the tack of success\n   |___|  Milwaukee, WI  53210        and rise to the occasion!
I had a similar problem with my StyleWriter I (the original!).\nHave you tried cleaning the print heads? With the SWII driver, it's\nand option in the Print dialog box. Sometimes I had to do it several\ntimes to get the crud out. Yes it wastes ink, but it beats those\nwhite annoying lines.\n  Another idea is to print a couple of pages with just a big\nblack box. It can help to get the ink flowing.\n  Good luck!\n\n  Beth Corbo
Hi,\n\n	I own a IIsi and I'm considering buying a Powerbook.  Can\nanyone give me a listing of all the models and tell me what I'm looking for,\ni.e. passive matrix vs. active, memory sizes, upgradeability, internal modems,\ndisk size.  If you could provide some prices too that would help.  I'm not\ninformed enough on Powerbooks to know how well they operate.  \n	I have been following the posts on some of the problems that have been\nencountered such as the trackball not working in the horizontal.\n	I would appreciate the list as well as any advice you may have.
I heard that the magic date for price drop in a number of Apple products\nwill\nbe \nJune 30th.  Can anyone second this rumour?\n-- \nA motion picture major at the Brooks Institute of Photography, CA\nSanta Barbara and a foreign student from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
Is this true?  I thought that this was disputed...\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \n-Peter
Ok, I have a question... why?  Why do people copy the article, and the \nonly new thing they add to the post is there name?  I'm not picking on \nthis person, I've seen a few of these.  Is it just a mistake?  Am I \nmissing something?  Is it some unknown net-equette I missed somewhere?\nI skip over all the quoted material, since I've already read it, and look \nfor the non-quoted material, and all I get is the name addition.  Is this \nsupposed to me "I agree", or "I second this" or what?\n\nSorry...
The computer itself uses far less electricity than a TV. \nMonitor--depends on the size :).\n\n	But one thing NOT to do is use a self-shutdown or power-shutdown \niron/appliance on the same electric line.\n\n	After a new monitor and power supply and modem, my wife *still* doesn't\nthink her iron is at fault :(.	(She should know better, being a Bio-med\nengineer :)
In light of the 100 letter over "What was the LISA" I thought I'd start a\nnew one.  What was the IIvx?  I hear it was some machine that predated the\nmain 040 line by about 6 mos, but used obsolete tech.  Rumor has it that\nseveral were sold....

The second part is \n  posted to comp.sys.mac.system and features many questions about\n  system  software.  The third part is posted every two weeks in\n  comp.sys.mac.misc.  Tables of contents for those two pieces are\n  included above. Please familiarize  yourself with all three\n  sections of this document  before posting. \n  \n         All pieces  are available for anonymous ftp from\n  rtfm.mit.edu (18.172.1.27) in the directory \n  pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh.  Except for this introductory\n  FAQ which appears in multiple newsgroups and is stored as\n  general-faq.Z, the name of each file has the format of the last\n  part of the group name followed by "-faq.Z", e.g the FAQ for\n  comp.sys.mac.system is stored as system-faq.Z and the FAQ for\n  comp.sys.mac.misc is stored as misc-faq.Z.  RTFM stores files as \n  compressed (.Z) BINARY files.  If you leave off the .Z at the end\n  of  the file name when "getting" the file, rtfm will automatically \n  decompress the file before sending it to you.  You can also have \n  these files mailed to you by sending an E-mail message to \n  mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with the line:  send\n  pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh/"name"  in the body text where\n  "name" is the name of the file you want as  specified above (e.g.\n  general-faq).  You can also send this server a message with the\n  subject "help" for more detailed instructions.   \n\n    \n\n ==================== \n I HAVE A QUESTION...  (1.0)\n ====================\n  \n       Congratulations!  You've come to the right place.  Usenet is \n  a wonderful resource for information ranging from basic questions\n  (How do I lock a floppy disk?) to queries that would make Steve\n  Jobs himself run screaming from the room in terror.  (I used\n  ResEdit to remove resources Init #11, WDEF 34, and nVIR 17 from my\n  system file and used the Hex Editor to add code string #A67B45 as a\n  patch to the SFGetFile routine so the Standard File Dialog Box\n  would be a nice shade of mauve.  Everything worked fine until I\n  installed SuperCDevBlaster, and now when I use the Aldus driver to\n  print from PageMaker 5.0d4 to a Linotronic 6000 my system hangs. \n  P.S.  I'm running System 6.0.2 on a PowerBook 170.) \n  \n       Since the Macintosh newsgroups are medium to high volume, we\n  ask that you first peruse this FAQ list including at least the\n  table of contents for the other pieces of it, check any other\n  relevant on-line resources listed below in question 1.2, especially\n  the FAQ lists for the other Macintosh newsgroups, and RTFM (Read\n  the Friendly Manual) before posting your question.  We realize that\n  you are personally incensed that the System is taking up fourteen\n  of your newly-installed twenty megs of RAM, but this question has\n  already made its way around the world three hundred times before,\n  and it's developing tired feet.  Finally, before posting to any\n  newsgroup (Macintosh or otherwise), please familiarize yourself\n  with the basic etiquette of Usenet as described in the newsgroup\n  news.announce.newusers.\n\n\n HOW DO I USE THIS DOCUMENT?  WHERE CAN I GET IT?  (1.1) \n     \n         comp.sys.mac.faq is currently divided into multiple pieces,\n  a general introduction which you're reading now, and specific lists\n  for the newsgroups comp.sys.mac.system and comp.sys.mac.misc.  FAQ\n  lists for comp.sys.mac.wanted, comp.sys.mac.apps and\n  comp.sys.mac.hardware are in development.  When ready each part\n  will be available in its respective newsgroup.  All pieces are\n  available via anonymous ftp from rtfm.mit.edu in the\n  pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh directory. Except for this\n  document itself which is named general-faq.Z the pieces are named\n  as per the last part of the newsgroup they cover  followed by\n  "-faq", e.g. system-faq.Z, misc-faq.Z.  The .Z means the  file is\n  stored compressed so you'll need to ftp it in binary mode and use\n  either MacCompress, StuffIt Deluxe, or the UNIX uncompress command \n  to decompress it.  However if you leave off the ".Z" extension when\n   you "get" the file, rtfm will automatically decompress the file\n  before sending it to you. \n  \n         This introductory document is posted to all of the concerned\n  newsgroups.  The tables of contents for each of the specific FAQ\n  lists are at the beginning of this file so you should be able to\n  get  at least some idea whether your question is answered anywhere\n  else in the FAQ even if you don't have the other parts at hand. \n  It's not always obvious, especially to newcomers, where a\n  particular question or comment should be posted.  Please\n  familiarize yourself with the FAQ lists in all the major Macintosh\n  newsgroups before posting in any of them.  Which questions appear\n  in which FAQs can serve as a basic guide to what posts belong\n  where. \n  \n         To jump to a particular question search for\n  section-number.question-number enclosed in parentheses.  For\n  example to find "Where can I FTP Macintosh software?" search for\n  the string  "(2.1)".  To jump to a section instead of a question\n  use a zero for  the question number.\n\n\n WHAT OTHER INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE?  (1.2)\n\n      comp.sys.mac.faq provides short answers to a number of \n  frequently asked questions appropriate for the Usenet newsgroup\n  comp.sys.mac.misc and comp.sys.mac.system.  Four other files are\n  worthy of particular note: Daryl Spitzer maintains a FAQ list\n  covering Macintosh programming for the newsgroup\n  comp.sys.mac.programmer.  It's posted to that group weekly and \n  available for anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.uoregon (128.223.8.8) in \n  /pub/mac.  Eric Rosen maintains a frequently asked questions list \n  for comp.sys.mac.comm available in that newsgroup and from\n  rascal.ics.utexas.edu in mac/faq (where the file you're reading now\n  is also irregularly archived).  This list answers many frequently\n  asked questions about networking, UNIX and the Mac,\n  telecommunications, and foreign file formats.  Norm Walsh has\n  compiled an excellent FAQ for comp.fonts that answers a lot of\n  questions about the various kinds of fonts and cross-platform\n  conversion and printing.  It's available in comp.fonts or by ftp\n  from ibis.cs.umass.edu in /pub/norm/comp.fonts/FAQ*.  Finally Jim\n  Jagielski maintains a FAQ for comp.unix.aux covering Apple's UNIX\n  environment, A/UX.  It's posted every 2 to 3 weeks in comp.unix.aux\n  and news.answers. It's available for anonymous ftp at\n  jagubox.gsfc.nasa.gov.\n\n\n WHICH NEWSGROUP SHOULD I POST TO?  (1.3)\n  \n      There are no stupid questions, but there are misplaced ones. \n  You wouldn't ask your English teacher how to do the definite\n  integral  of ln x between zero and one, would you?  So don't ask\n  the programmer newsgroup why your system is so slow when Microsoft\n  Word is in the background.  Ignorance of basic netiquette is not an\n  excuse. If you want people to help you, you need to learn their\n  ways of  communicating.  \n  \n      Posting questions to the proper newsgroup will fill your\n  mailbox with pearls of wisdom (and maybe a few rotten oysters too\n  :-) ).  Posting to the wrong newsgroup often engenders a thundering\n  silence.  For instance the most common and glaring mispost, one\n  that seems as incongruous to dwellers in the Macintosh regions of\n  Usenet as would a purple elephant to Aleuts in the Arctic, asking a\n  question about networking anywhere except comp.sys.mac.comm,\n  normally produces no useful responses.  Posting the same question\n  to comp.sys.mac.comm ensures that your post is read and considered\n  by dozens of experienced network administrators and not a few\n  network software designers.\n  \n         Please post to exactly ONE newsgroup.  Do not cross-post. \n  If a question isn't important enough for you to take the extra\n  minute to figure out where it properly belongs, it's not important\n  enough for several thousand people to spend their time reading. \n  For the same reason comp.sys.mac.misc should not be used as a\n  catch-all newsgroup.\n  \n         The breakdown of questions between different newsgroups in\n  this document can also serve as a reasonable guide to what belongs\n  where.  Specifically questions about productivity applications\n  (software you bought your Macintosh to run, not software you bought\n  to make your Macintosh run better) should go to comp.sys.mac.apps\n  unless the application is covered in a more specific newsgroup. \n  Communications programs, games, HyperCard, compilers and databases\n  all have more topical comp.sys.mac.* newsgroups.  Post questions\n  about non-communications hardware including questions about what\n  software is necessary to make particular hardware work to\n  comp.sys.mac.hardware.  Questions about MacOS system software\n  belong in comp.sys.mac.system.  Questions about utilities and\n  extensions normally belong in comp.sys.mac.misc.  Questions about\n  A/UX go to comp.unix.aux.  Detailed questions about Appletalk\n  belong in comp.protocols.appletalk.\n  \n         Direct questions about HyperCard to comp.sys.mac.hypercard. \n  Non-HyperCard programming questions and questions about development\n  environments should go to comp.sys.mac.programmer.  ResEdit\n  questions may be posted either to comp.sys.mac.misc,\n  comp.sys.mac.system, or comp.sys.mac.programmer; but generally the\n  netters who inhabit the darker recesses of comp.sys.mac.programmer\n  are considerably more practiced at the art of resource hacking. \n  \n         A general exception to the above rules is that any VERY\n  technical question about an application that actually begins to\n  delve into the how's of a program as well as the what's (Recent\n  example: How does WriteNow which is written entirely in assembly\n  compare to other word processors written in high level languages?)\n  might be better addressed to the programmer newsgroup.\n    \n         For Sale and Want to Buy posts should go to\n  comp.sys.mac.wanted and misc.forsale.computers.mac ONLY.  We\n  understand that you're desperate to sell your upgraded 128K Mac to\n  get the $$ for a PowerBook 180; but trust me, anyone who wants to\n  buy it will be reading comp.sys.mac.wanted.  Political and\n  religious questions (The Mac is better than Windows! Is not! Is\n  too! Is not! Is too! Hey! How 'bout the Amiga! What about it? Is\n  Not! Is too!) belong in comp.sys.mac.advocacy.  Anything not\n  specifically mentioned above probably belongs in comp.sys.mac.misc.\n  \n         Finally don't be so provincial as to consider only the\n  comp.sys.mac newsgroups the appropriate forums for your questions. \n  Many questions about modems in comp.sys.mac.comm are much more\n  thoroughly discussed in comp.dcom.modems.  Questions about Mac MIDI\n  are often better handled in comp.music even though it's not a\n  Macintosh specific newsgroup.  Shop around.  Usenet's a big place\n  and not everything relevant to the Macintosh happens in\n  comp.sys.mac.\n\n\n 4. SOMEONE JUST ASKED WHY THE SYSTEM WAS TAKING UP SIXTEEN OF\n THEIR  TWENTY MEGABYTES OF RAM.  SHOULDN'T I PUT MY BRILLIANCE AND\n WIT ON  DISPLAY FOR THE WORLD BY POSTING THE SEVENTEENTH RESPONSE?\n\n      No.  Frequent answers are just as boring and uninteresting as\n  frequent questions.  Unless you really have something new to add to\n  the traditional answers (such as the recent discovery that fonts in\n  System 7.1 could eat memory) private E-mail is a much better medium\n  for answering common questions like this one.\n   \n         You might want to add a mention of this FAQ in your E-mail\n  response and a polite suggestion that your correspondent read it\n  before posting future questions.  I do read all the newsgroups\n  covered here and have written a small script in MicroPhone II that\n  lets me send PWFAQ's (people with frequently asked questions) the\n  section of this document that answers their question with just the\n  click of a button so please don't feel obligated to respond to\n  someone who cares so little about the answer to their question they\n  can't be troubled to read the FAQ list to get it.\n\n    \n\n === \n FTP  (2.0) \n ===\n\n WHERE CAN I FTP MAC SOFTWARE?  (2.1)\n\n      The three major North American Internet archives of shareware,\n  freeware, and demo software are sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6),\n  mac.archive.umich.edu (141.211.165.41), and wuarchive.wustl.edu\n  (128.252.135.4) which mirrors the other two sites and several\n  others. Wuarchive often holds on to files after other sites remove\n  them for space concerns, and still has files that were deleted from\n  the formerly important site, rascal.ics.utexas.edu.  Rascal was\n  notable for storing its files in MacBinary format rather than the\n  less efficient BinHex format common at the other archives.  Unless\n  otherwise noted shareware and freeware mentioned in this document\n  should be available at the above sites.\n  \n       To keep traffic on the Internet manageable, Scandinavians \n  should try connecting to ftp.funet.fi (128.214.6.100), ftp.lth.se\n  (130.235.20.3), or sics.se (192.16.123.90) instead.  Those in \n  the U.K. should look first at src.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.2.1). \n  Continental Europeans can try nic.switch.ch (130.59.1.40),  \n  ezinfo.ethz.ch (129.132.2.72), and anl.anl.fr(192.54.179.1). \n  Australian users should try to find what they want at archie.au\n  (139.130.4.6) which mirrors info-mac and mac.archive.  Japanese\n  users will find sumex mirrored at ftp.u-tokyo.ac.jp\n  (130.69.254.254). \n\n         A fourth very important site is ftp.apple.com (130.43.2.3). \n  This is Apple's semi-official repository for system software,\n  developer tools, source code, technical notes, and other things\n  that come more or less straight from Apple's mouth.  Some material\n  at this site may not be distributed outside the U.S. or by other\n  sites that don't have an official license to distribute Apple\n  system software.  Please read the various README documents\n  available at ftp.apple.com for the detailed info if you're\n  connecting from outside the U.S. or if you wish to redistribute\n  material you find here.\n\n\n CAN I GET SHAREWARE BY E-MAIL?  (2.2)\n\n      The info-mac archives at sumex-aim are available by E-mail from\n  LISTSERV@RICEVM1.bitnet (alternately listserv@ricevm1.rice.edu). \n  The listserver responds to the commands $MACARCH HELP, $MACARCH\n  INDEX, and $MACARCH GET filename.  Mac archive files are available\n  from mac@mac.archive.umich.edu.  Send it a message containing the\n  words "help" and "index" (no quotes) on the first two lines of your\n  message for instructions on getting started and a list of the files\n  you may request.  You can retrieve files from other sites by using\n  the server at ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com.  For details send it a\n  message with just the text "help" (no quotes).\n\n\n WHERE CAN I FIND APPLICATION X?  (2.3)\n\n      If you can't find what you're looking for at one of the above\n  sites, try telnetting to your nearest archie server or sending it\n  an E-mail message addressed to archie with the subject "help." \n  Archie servers are located at archie.rutgers.edu (128.6.18.15,\n  America), archie.mcgill.ca (132.206.2.3, the original archie server\n  in Canada), archie.au (139.130.4.6, Australia), archie.funet.fi\n  (128.214.6.100, Scandinavia), and archie.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.3.7,\n  the U.K. and the continent).  These sites index the tens of\n  thousands of files available for anonymous ftp.  Login as "archie"\n  (no password is needed) and type "prog filename" to find what\n  you're looking for or type "help" for more detailed instructions. \n  For instance you would type "prog Disinfectant" to search for a\n  convenient ftp site for Disinfectant.  If the initial search fails\n  to turn up the file you want, try variations on and substrings of\n  the name.  For instance if you didn't find Disinfectant with "prog\n  Disinfectant", you might try "prog disi" instead.  Substring\n  searches often hide the gold in a pile of dross.  To avoid many\n  erroneous matches add a ".*\.hqx" to the end of the substring, e.g.\n  "prog disi.*\.hqx"  Most Mac software available on the net ends in\n  .hqx but almost no UNIX or PC software does. \n\n         Please check the above archives and ARCHIE personally BEFORE\n  asking where you can find a particular piece of shareware.  If you\n  follow the above advice, you should almost never have to ask the\n  net where to find a particular piece of software.\n\n\n CAN SOMEONE MAIL ME APPLICATION X?  (2.4)\n\n      No.  Nor will anyone mail you a part of a file from\n  comp.binaries.mac that was corrupt or missed at your site.  Please\n  refer to the first questions in this section to find out about\n  anonymous FTP, archie, and automatic E-mail servers.\n\n\n WHAT IS .BIN? .HQX? .CPT? .ETC?  (2.5)\n\n      Most files available by FTP are modified twice to allow them to\n  more easily pass through foreign computer systems.  First they're\n  compressed to make them faster to download, and then they're\n  translated to either a binhex (.hqx) or MacBinary (.bin) format\n  that other computers can digest.  (The Macintosh uses a special\n  two-fork filing system that chokes most other computers.)  BinHex\n  files are 7-bit ASCII text files, while MacBinary files are pure\n  8-bit binary data that must always be transferred using a binary\n  protocol.\n  \n         How a file has been translated and compressed for\n  transmission is indicated by its suffix.  Normally a file will have\n  a name something like filename.xxx.yyy.  .xxx indicates how it was\n  compressed and .yyy indicates how it was translated.  To use a file\n  you've FTP'd and downloaded to your Mac you'll need to reverse the\n  process.  Most files you get from the net require a two-step\n  decoding process.  First change the binhex (.hqx) or MacBinary\n  (.bin) file to a double-clickable Macintosh file; then decompress\n  it.  Which programs decode which file types is covered in the table\n  below.  Also note that most Macintosh telecommunications programs\n  will  automatically convert MacBinary files to regular Macintosh\n  files as they are downloaded.\n\n***************************************************************************\nSuffix:      .sit  .cpt  .hqx  .bin  .pit  .Z  .image  .dd  .zip .uu  .tar \nExtractors\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nStuffIt 3.0|   X     X     X     X     X                  \nCompact Pro|         X     X \nPackit     |                           X\nUUTool     |                                                      X \nMacCompress|                                X \nSunTar     |               X     X     X                                X \nBinHex 5.0 |                     X \nBinHex 4.0 |               X \nDiskDoubler|                           X                X \nUnZip      |                                                   X \nDiskCopy   |                                     X \nmacutil    |         X     X           X                X\n***************************************************************************\n\n     A few notes on the decompressors:\n\n      StuffIt is a family of products that use several different\n  compression schemes.  The freeware StuffIt Expander will unstuff\n  all of them.  Versions of StuffIt earlier than 3.0 (StuffIt 1.5.1,\n  StuffIt Classic, UnStuffIt, and StuffIt Deluxe 2.0 and 1.0) will\n  not unstuff the increasing number of files stuffed by StuffIt 3.0. \n  You need to get a more recent version of StuffIt or StuffIt\n  Expander. \n    \n         StuffIt 3.0.5 (Lite and Deluxe) consistently makes smaller\n  archives than any other Macintosh compression utility.  To allow\n  maximum space for files on the various ftp sites and to keep\n  net-bandwidth down, please compress all files you send to anonymous\n  ftp sites with StuffIt 3.0.5.\n   \n         UUTool, MacCompress, and SunTar handle the popular UNIX\n  formats of  uuencode (.uu), compress (.Z), and tar (.tar)\n  respectively.  The UNIX versions are often more robust than the Mac\n  products, so use them instead when that's an  option.  Translators\n  that allow StuffIt Lite to expand uuencoded and tar files are also\n  available by anonymous ftp. \n  \n         Macutil is dik winter's package of UNIX utilities to\n  decompress and debinhex files on a workstation before downloading\n  them to a Mac. Since UNIX stores files differently than does the\n  Mac, macutil creates MacBinary (.bin) files which should be\n  automatically converted on download.  It can't decompress\n  everything. In particular it can't decompress the new StuffIt 3.0\n  archives. :-(  However, if you need only one or two files out of an\n  archive--for instance if you want to read the README to find out if\n  a program does what you need it to do before you download all of\n  it--macutil is indispensable.  It can be found at sumex-aim in the\n  info-mac/unix directory.\n\n     A few notes on the compression formats:\n\n      .bin:  These are MacBinary files.  Always use a binary file\n  transfer protocol when transferring them, never ASCII or text. \n  Most files on the net are stored as .hqx instead.  Only rascal\n  stores most of its files in .bin format.  Most communications\n  programs such as ZTerm and MacKermit are capable of translating\n  MacBinary files on the fly as they download if they know in advance\n  they'll be downloading MacBinary files.\n  \n      .image: This format is normally used only for system software,\n  so that on-line users can download files that can easily be\n  converted into exact copies of the installer floppies.  Instead of\n  using DiskCopy to restore the images to floppies, you can use Steve\n  Christensen's freeware utility  MountImage to treat the images on\n  your hard disk as actual floppies inserted in a floppy drive. \n  MountImage has a reputation for being buggy, so you should have\n  some blank floppies and a copy of DiskCopy handy just in case.\n  \n      .sea (.x, .X):  .sea files don't merit a position in the above\n  table because they're self-extracting.  They may have been created\n  with Compact Pro, StuffIt, or even DiskDoubler; but all should be\n  capable of decompressing themselves when double-clicked.  For some\n  unknown reason Alysis has chosen not to use this industry standard\n  designation for self-extracting archives created with their \n  payware products SuperDisk! and More Disk Space.  Instead they \n  append either .x or .X to self-extracting archives.\n\n\n HOW CAN I GET BINHEX?  STUFFIT?  ETC.?  (2.6)\n\n      By far the easiest way to get these programs is to ask a human\n  being to copy them onto a floppy for you.  If you're at a\n  university there's absolutely no excuse for not finding someone to\n  give you a copy; and if you're anywhere less remote than McMurdo\n  Sound, chances are very good that someone at a computer center,\n  dealership, or user group can provide you with a copy of StuffIt. \n  Once you have StuffIt (any version) you don't need BinHex.\n    \n         If you're such a computer geek that the thought of actually\n  asking a living, breathing human being instead of a computer \n  terminal for something turns you into a quivering mass of \n  protoplasmic jelly, you can probably download a working copy  of\n  StuffIt from a local bulletin board system. \n  \n         If you have religious objections to software gotten by any \n  means other than anonymous ftp, then I suppose I'll mention that \n  you can in fact ftp a working copy of StuffIt though this is by \n  far the hardest way to get it.  Ftp to wuarchive.wustl.edu and \n  login.  Type the word "binary."  Hit return.  Type "cd\n  mirrors/rascal.ics.utexas.edu/compression" and hit return.  Then\n  "get StuffIt_Expander_1.0.1_SEA_bin"  and hit return.  Of course\n  it's always possible that by the time you read this StuffIt\n  Expander will have been updated and the name changed so if this\n  fails look for something similar.  If you've ftp'd straight onto\n  your Mac you should now have a self-extracting archive which will\n  produce a working copy of StuffIt Expander when double-clicked.  If\n  you've ftp'd to your mainframe or UNIX account first, you still\n  need to use a modem program to download it to your Mac.  Just make\n  sure that the Mac is receiving in MacBinary mode and the mainframe\n  is sending in binary mode.  If you need more details on the last\n  step, consult the FAQ list for comp.sys.mac.comm and the manuals\n  for both your mainframe and Macintosh telecommunications software.\n  \n  \n  HOW CAN I GET BINHEX, STUFFIT, ETC. FROM A PC?  (2.7)\n\n       You can't.  There is absolutely NO way to get an executable\n  Macintosh file from an ftp site onto a PC and then onto your Mac\n  without some software obtained by means other than anonymous ftp.\n  You MUST beg, borrow, or steal the necessary software such as\n  Binhex or StuffIt Lite from another person.  I realize this may \n  terrify those among you who haven't left your parents' basement \n  since you got an  Apple II+ in 1980, but eventually you're going \n  to need to link up with some human being other than your mother.  \n  (though I suppose if you're this much of  a nerd you could send \n  your mother out to get it for you.)  While you're gathering\n  your nerves for a venture into the strange and terrifying world \n  of daylight, please don't bother the net by asking this question\n  again.  There simply is no way to move executable Macintosh\n  programs from a PC or other non-Macintosh computer onto a \n  Mac without software that is not bundled with most Macs.\n\n\n\n=================================================================\nTROUBLESHOOTING: WHAT TO DO (BEFORE POSTING) WHEN THINGS GO WRONG (3.0)\n================================================================= \n\n         While the various FAQ lists cover a lot of specific\n  problems, there are far more problems that aren't covered here. \n  These are a few basic techniques you should follow before asking\n  for help.  You should probably also perform the ten-step\n  preventative maintenance routine described in section four,\n  especially rebuilding the desktop (4.3) and resizing the system\n  heap (4.5).  Following these steps may  or may not solve your\n  problem, but it will at least make it easier  for others to\n  recommend solutions to you.\n\n IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM.  (3.1)\n\n      "Microsoft Word is crashing" doesn't say much.  What were you\n  doing when it crashed?  Can you repeat the actions that lead to the\n  crash?  The more information you provide about the actions\n  preceding the crash the more likely it is someone can help you. \n  The more precisely you've identified the problem and the actions\n  preceding it (Step 1) the easier it will be to tell if the\n  following steps fix the problem.  For example, "Sometimes\n  QuarkXPress 3.0 crashes with a coprocessor not installed error." is\n  not nearly as helpful as "QuarkXPress 3.0 crashes when I link two\n  text boxes on a master page when copies of those text boxes already\n  contain text."  The former will leave you wondering whether the bug\n  remains after a given step.  The latter lets you go right to the\n  problem and see if it's still there or not.\n\n\n READ THE READ ME FILE.  (3.2)\n\n      Many companies include a list of known incompatibilities and\n  bugs in their READ ME files.  Often these aren't documented in the\n  manual. Read any READ ME files to see if any of the problems sound\n  familiar.\n\n\n CHECK FOR VIRUSES.  (3.3)\n\n      Run Disinfectant or another anti-viral across your disk.  Virus\n  infections are rarer than most people think, but they do occur and\n  they do cause all sorts of weird problems when they do.\n\n\n REINSTALL THE APPLICATION AND ALL ITS SUPPORT FILES.  (3.4)  \n   \n       For half a dozen reasons (external magnetic fields,\n  improperly written software, the alignment of the planets) a file\n  on a disk may not contain the data it's supposed to contain.  This\n  can cause all types of unexplained, unusual behavior.  Restoring\n  from original masters will normally fix this.\n\n\n REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE.  (3.5)  \n\n      Bits are even more likely to get twiddled in the system file\n  than in the application and the effects can be just as disastrous. \n  See question 4.6 for a detailed procedure for performing a  clean\n  reinstall. \n  \n         If the problem continues to occur after you've taken these\n  steps, chances are you've found either a conflict between your\n  application and some other software or a genuine bug in the\n  program.  So it's time to\n\n\n ISOLATE THE PROBLEM.  (3.6)  \n \n         You need to find the minimal system on which the problem\n  will assert itself.  Here are the basic steps of isolating the\n  cause of a system or application crash:\n  \n     a.	Run only one application at a time. Occasionally applications do\n     conflict with each other.  If the problem does not manifest itself\n     without other applications running simultaneously, you can begin\n     launching other applications until you find the one that causes \n     the crash.\n     \n     b.	If you're running System 6, turn off MultiFinder.  If you're\n     running System 7, allot as much memory to the application as you \n     can afford.  Sometimes programs just need more memory, especially \n     when performing complicated operations.\n     \n     c. If you're running System 7, turn off virtual memory and 32-bit\n     addressing.  There's still an awful lot of System 7 hostile\n     software out there including some from companies that really \n     have no excuse.  (Can you say Microsoft Word 5.1, boys and girls?  \n     I knew you could.)  Some of this software only expresses its \n     incompatibilities when certain uncommon actions are taken.\n     \n     d.	Boot from a virgin system floppy.  If the problem disappears\n     you likely have an init conflict.  You need to progressively remove\n     extensions until the problem vanishes.  Use a little common sense\n     when choosing the first extensions to remove.  If the problem occurs\n     when you try to open a file, remove any inits that mess with the\n     Standard File Open procedure such as Super Boomerang first.  If the\n     problem remains after the obvious candidates have been eliminated,\n     either remove the remaining extensions one at a time or, if you have\n     a lot of them, perform a binary search by removing half of the\n     extensions at a time.  Once the problem disappears add half of the\n     most recently removed set back.  Continue until you've narrowed the\n     conflict down to one extension.  When you think you've found the\n     offending init restart with only that init enabled just to make \n     sure that it and it alone is indeed causing the problem.\n\n\n CONTACT TECHNICAL SUPPORT.  (3.7)\n\n      By now you should have a very good idea of when, where, and why\n  the conflict occurs.  If a tech support number is available for the\n  software, call it.  If you're lucky the company will have a work\n  around or fix available.  If not, perhaps they'll at least add the\n  bug to their database of problems to be fixed in the next release.\n\n    \n\n ====================== \n PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE  (4.0)\n ======================\n\n      You wouldn't drive your car 100,000 miles without giving it a\n  tune-up.  A computer is no different.  Regular tune-ups avoid a lot\n  of problems.  Although there are Mac mechanics who'll be happy to\n  charge you $75 or more for the equivalent of an oil change, there's\n  no reason you can't change it yourself.  The following nine-step\n  program should be performed about every three months. \n\n\n TRASH UNNEEDED FILES  (4.1)\n\n      Many of the operations that follow will run faster and more\n  smoothly the more free disk space there is to work with so spend a\n  little time cleaning up your hard disk.  If you're at all like me,\n  you'll find several megabytes worth of preferences files for\n  applications you no longer have, archives of software you've\n  dearchived, shareware you tried out and didn't like, announcements\n  for events that have come and gone and many other files you no\n  longer need.  If you're running System 7 you may also have several\n  more megabytes in your trash can alone.  Throw them away and empty \n  the trash.\n\n\n RETHINK YOUR EXTENSIONS  (4.2)\n\n      Some Macintoshes attract inits like a new suit attracts rain. \n  Seriously consider whether you actually need every extension \n  in your collection.  If you don't use the functionality of an\n  extension at least every fifth time you boot up, you're probably\n  better off not storing it in your System Folder where it only takes\n  up memory, destabilizes your system, and slows down every startup. \n  For instance if you only read PC disks once a month, there's no\n  need to keep AccessPC loaded all the time.  Cutting back on your\n  extension habit can really help avoid crashes. \n\n\n REBUILD THE DESKTOP  (4.3)\n\n      The Desktop file/database holds all the information necessary\n  to associate each file with the application that created it.  It\n  lets the system know what application should be launched when you\n  open a given file and what icons it should display where. \n  Depending on its size each application has one or more\n  representatives in the desktop file.  As applications and files\n  move on and off your hard disk, the Desktop file can be become\n  bloated and corrupt.  Think of it as a Congress for your Mac. \n  Every so often it's necessary to throw the bums out and start with\n  a clean slate.  Fortunately it's easier to rebuild the desktop than\n  to defeat an incumbent. \n  \n         One warning: rebuilding the desktop will erase all comments\n  you've stored in the Get Info boxes.  Under System 7 Maurice\n  Volaski's freeware init CommentKeeper will retain those comments\n  across a rebuild.  CommentKeeper also works with System 6 but only \n  if Apple's Desktop Manager extension is also installed. \n  \n         To rebuild the desktop restart your Mac and, as your\n  extensions finish loading, depress the Command and Option keys. \n  You'll be presented with a dialog box asking if you want to rebuild\n  the desktop and warning you that "This could take a few minutes." \n  Click OK. It will take more than a few minutes. The more files you\n  have the longer it will take.  If you're running System 6 you may\n  want to turn off MultiFinder before trying to rebuild the desktop.\n   \n          If you're experiencing definite problems and not just doing\n  preventive maintenance, you may want to use Fifth Generation's\n  freeware init Desktop Reset.  Desktop Reset completely deletes the\n  Desktop file before rebuilding it, thus eliminating possibly\n  corrupt data structures.    \n\n\n ZAP THE PRAM AND RESET THE CLOCK  (4.4)\n\n      All Macs from the original 128K Thin Mac to the Quadra 950\n  contain a small amount of battery powered RAM to hold certain\n  settings that properly move with the CPU rather than with the disk\n  such as which disk to boot from.  Unfortunately this "parameter\n  RAM" can become corrupted and cause unexplained crashes.  To reset\n  it under System 7 hold down the Command, Option, P, and R keys\n  while restarting your Mac.  Under System 6 hold down the Command,\n  Option, and Shift keys while selecting the Control Panel from the\n  Apple menu. Click Yes when asked if you want to zap the parameter\n  RAM.  Since you've erased almost all the settings in the General\n  Control Panel, you should now reset them to whatever you want.\n   \n         The one setting that zapping the PRAM does not erase is the \n  date and time; but since the internal clock in the Macintosh is\n  notoriously inaccurate you'll probably want to take this\n  opportunity to reset it anyway.\n\n\n RESIZE THE SYSTEM HEAP  (4.5) \n\n      Even after rethinking their extensions as per step two most\n  people still have at least half a row of icons march across the\n  bottom of their screen every time they restart.  All these\n  extensions (and most applications too) need space in a section of\n  memory called the System Heap.  If the System Heap isn't big enough\n  to comfortably accommodate all the programs that want a piece of\n  it, they all start playing King of the Mountain on the system heap,\n  knocking each other off to get bigger pieces for themselves and\n  trying to climb back on after they get knocked off.  All this\n  fighting amongst the programs severely degrades system performance\n  and almost inevitably crashes the Mac.\n  \n         If you're using System 7, your Macintosh will automatically\n  resize the system heap as necessary; but if you're running System 6\n  it's important to set your system heap size large enough to manage\n  all your extensions and applications.  By default this size is set\n  to 128K, way too small for most Macs with any extensions at all. \n  The system heap size is stored in the normally non-editable boot\n  blocks of every system disk.  Bill Steinberg's freeware utility\n  BootMan not only lets you resize your system heap but even checks\n  how much memory your heap is already using so it can tell how much\n  needs to be allocated.  If you're running System 6, get BootMan,\n  use it, and be amazed at how infrequently your Macintosh crashes.\n\n\n REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE  (4.6)\n\n      System files can become corrupt and fragmented, especially if\n  you've stored lots of fonts and desk accessories inside them. \n  Merely updating the System software will often not fix system file\n  corruption.  I recommend doing a clean reinstall.  Here's how:\n\n    1.  Boot from the installer floppy of your System disks.  \n    2.  Copy any non-standard fonts and desk accessories out \n        of your System file into a temporary suitcase.\n    3.  Trash the System file on your hard disk.  Also trash the \n        Finder, MultiFinder, DA Handler, and all other standard Apple \n        extensions like Control Panel and Chooser.  These will all be \n        replaced in the new installation.  If you're running or \n        installing System 7, move everything in the Extensions, \n        Control Panels, and Preferences folders into the top level \n        of the System Folder.\n    4.  Rename the System Folder.  Any name other than System Folder \n        is  fine.\n    5.  Double-click the installer script on your System disk.  Then \n        choose Customize...  Select the appropriate software for your \n        model Mac and printer.  You could do an Easy Install instead, \n        but that will only add a lot of extensions and code you don't \n        need that waste your memory and disk space.\n    6.  Once installation is finished, move everything from the \n        temporary folder you created in step 4 into the new System \n        folder.  If you're asked if you want to replace anything, you \n        forgot to take something out in step 3.  You'll need to replace \n        things individually until you find the duplicate piece. \n    7.  Reinstall any fonts or DA's you removed in step 2.\n    8.  Reboot.  You should now have a clean, defragmented System file \n        that takes up less memory and disk space and a much more stable \n        system overall.\n\n\n     DISK UTILITIES  (4.7)\n\n      Much like system files hard disks have data structures that\n  occasionally become corrupted affecting performance and even\n  causing data loss.  Apple includes Disk First Aid, a simple utility\n  for detecting and repairing hard disk problems, with its System\n  disks. It's also available for anonymous ftp from ftp.apple.com in\n  the  directory dts/mac/sys.soft/hdsc.  Even if you have an earlier \n  version, you should get the latest version (7.1) from ftp.apple.com\n  and run it on all your hard disks.\n     \n         Several companies have released payware disk utilities that\n  detect and repair considerably more problems than Disk First Aid\n  though, interestingly, none of them detect and repair everything\n  that Disk First Aid does.  The three most effective for general\n  work are Central Point's MacTools Deluxe 2.0, Fifth Generation's\n  Public Utilites, and Symantec's Norton Utilities for the Macintosh\n  2.0.  A department or work group should have all of these as well\n  as Disk First Aid since none of them fix everything the others do. \n  For individuals MacTools ($48 street) is about half the price of\n  Norton ($94 street) or Public Utilities ($98 street) so, features\n  and ease of use being roughly equal, I recommend MacTools.\n   \n         All of these products occasionally encounter problems they\n  can't fix.  When that happens it's time to backup (4.7) and\n  reformat (4.9).\n\n\n     BACKING UP  (4.8)\n\n      This is one part of preventative maintenance that should be\n  done a LOT more often than every three months.  The simplest back\n  up is to merely copy all the files on your hard disk onto floppies\n  or other removable media.  If you keep your data files separate\n  from your application and support files then it's easy to only back\n  up those folders which change frequently.  Nonetheless every three\n  months you  should do a complete backup of your hard disk. \n  \n         A number of programs are available to make backing up\n  easier.  Apple included a very basic full backup application with\n  System 6.  With the Performas Apple ships a new Apple Backup\n  utility that can backup the entire disk or just the System folder\n  onto floppies.  The previously mentioned Norton Utilities for the\n  Mac and MacTools Deluxe 2.0 include more powerful floppy backup\n  utilities that incorporate compression and incremental backups.\n  \n         Finally if you're lucky enough to have a Tape Drive, network\n  server, or removable media device to use for backups, you should\n  check out the more powerful payware utilities Redux ($49 street,\n  doesn't support tape drives) and Diskfit Pro ($74 street).  There\n  are NO freely available backup utilities other than the old HD\n  Backup from System 6.  \n\n\n DISK DEFRAGMENTATION  (4.9)\n\n      As disks fill up it gets harder and harder to find enough free\n  space in the same place to write large files.  Therefore the\n  operating system will often split larger files into pieces to be\n  stored in different places on your hard disk.  As files become more\n  and more fragmented performance can degrade.  There are several\n  ways to defragment a hard disk.\n  \n         The most tedious but cheapest method is to backup all your\n  files, erase the hard disk (and you might as well reformat while\n  you're at it.  See question 4.10.), and restore all the files.\n   \n         A number of payware utilities including Norton Utilities for\n  the Mac and Mac Tools Deluxe can defragment a disk in place, i.e.\n  without erasing it.  Although the ads for all these products brag\n  about their safety, once you've bought the software and opened the\n  shrink-wrap they all warn you to back up your disk before\n  defragmenting it in case something does go wrong.  There are NO\n  freeware or shareware disk defragmenters so please don't annoy the\n  net by asking for one. \n\n\n REFORMAT YOUR HARD DISK  (4.10)\n\n      Just as a floppy disk needs to be initialized before use, so a\n  hard disk must be formatted before it can hold data.  You don't\n  need to reformat every three months; but when your system is\n  crashing no matter what you try, reformatting is the ultimate means\n  of wiping the slate clean.  Reformatting your hard disk may even\n  gain you a few extra megabytes of space.  Not all hard disks are\n  created equal.  Some can hold more data than others.  To facilitate\n  mass production and advertising without a lot of asterisks (* 81.3\n  megabytes is the average formatted capacity.  Your mileage may\n  vary.)  Apple often formats drives to the lowest common denominator\n  of drive capacity.  When you reformat there's no reason at all not\n  to reclaim whatever unused space Apple's left on your disk.\n     \n         Unlike floppies hard disks need a special program to\n  initialize them. Most hard disks come with formatting software. \n  Apple's disks and System software ship with HD SC setup, a minimal\n  disk formatter which will format Apple brand hard drives ONLY. \n  Most other manufacturers ship appropriate formatting software with\n  their hard drives.  Normally this will be all you need to reformat\n  your hard disk.\n  \n         A number of general-purpose formatters are also available\n  which go beyond the bundled software to include features like\n  encryption, password protection, multiple partitioning, faster disk\n  access, System 7 compatibility, and even compression.  Two of the\n  best are the payware Drive7 and Hard Disk Toolkit Personal Edition\n  ($49 street for either).  While there are one or two freeware\n  formatters available, none are likely to be superior to the ones\n  bundled with your hard disk. \n  \n         PowerBook users should be sure to turn off Sleep and\n  processor cycling before reformatting their hard drives no matter\n  what software they use.  Otherwise disk corruption, crashes, and\n  data losses are a very good possibility.
My friend has a Macintosh IIfx on which he is running System 6.0.7 (not enough\nmemory yet to run Sys7 adequately), and he noticed that when he tries to use\nMultifinder on this machine, the machine will beep every few seconds\nincessantly, nonstop.\n\nNow, this friend has a tendency to "install" things on his machine rather\nhaphazardly, but he *did* rebuild his System from scratch and it still occurs. \nDoes this problem sound familiar at all to anyone?  For all I know the problem\nis caused by something really obscure but if this is a known simple thing\n(yeah, right...) that someone is familiar with (like "System 6.0.7 Multifinder\ndoesn't run on a Mac IIfx"), or if someone here knows what he should be looking\nfor, please send e-mail either to me or to him (smh@vaxf.acdnj.itt.com).\nThanx in advance.
I vote for turning them off at night.  THe stress of off/on is a little \nharmful, so don't turn it off, then back on an hour later, etc, but\nturning them off for 4-5 hours or overnight is a good idea.\n\nThe electricy consumption will go down if you turn them off overnight, along\nwith heat.
Hello\n\n	I am the proud new owner of a MAC 512K.  Upon power-up and insertion\n	of the sytem disk, I get SAD MAC code 0F0064.  Can anyone give me a \n	clue to what this means?\n\n	Thanks.
I was reading a review of the Centris 610 in this \nmonths MacWorld and the reviewer said that for \n$4 you could make an adjustment on the clock speed\nof the chip and change it from 20mhz to 25mhz.  I \nhaven't heard of this before, and I don't think that\nthis is the 040 chip replacement (with fpu) that I have\nseen so much talk about.  Anyone have any ideas?\ncwera@du.edu

Hi,\n\nDoes anyone know where I can get the developer notes for the new Mac models\n(like IIvx, LC III, Centris)?\n\nThank's for any information.  Please reply by email.
So I finally decided to risk this upgrade, FAQ in hand I've gathered the\npieces together.  The only problem is that I haven't been able to find\nanyone who's even heard of thermal tape/glue (which is what the FAQ\nrecommends for attaching the heat sink)  I am just tempted to use duct\ntape here.... anyone hae any ideas for me for attaching the heat sink to\nthe processor??  much thanks.
Does anybody know where I can get a copy of System 6.0.8L.  It is a modified\nversion of System 6 that will work on the newer Mac models.
I have replaced the osz to 66 MHz yesterday and no truble at all. My Quadra now works at 33 MHz stable for more than 14 hours. I have also tried a 70 MHz osz, but after 1/2 hour my Quadra 700 died. I am not sure what was the reason for that,\nbut it is to risky to run it to fast. Most of your Quadras 700 should work at 33 MHz without any problems. \n\nBut a safety tip do a backup from your harddisk befor you start to upgrade. During my 35 MHz test I damaged my harddisk and had a hardtime to get it working again. So once again do a backup befor you start!!!!!!!!!\n\nNow the speedometer results after replacing the osz.\n\nSpeedometer Report for menes rainer.

Two points which my cause problems are the 4 MByte Ram solder on the board. The are only 80ns Rams and run at the upperlimit with 33 MHz. The next part which may cause trouble are the Video Rams. I have the orignal 100ns VRAMs from Apple in my Quadra, here you are also at the upperlimit where most of the chips running but it isn't garantied to run. Most of the other parts on the Quadra board running on there o\n\n\n\n\nwn clockspeed so they wont make truble.\n\nThe most importaned question is do I neat a new heat sink. I would say NO. After running my Quadra for more than 14 hours the heat sink is really cool. A 33 MHz 486 with heat sink is mutch warmer than the 68040 in the Quadra, so I didn't see any problems. The room temperatur was 22 Celsius (72 F). If you living in a area were it is hot 100 F (45 C) and your room temperatur is not mutch below I would suggest a new heat sink with a ventilator to stay on the safe side.\n\n\nHope you will have the same success than I had,\n\nRainer

this is a bad idea. my machine is on 24 hours a day, but it's actually \n_doing_ things 24 hours a day. i use it as an all purpose alarm clock, \nscheduler, i've got routines that run in the middle of the night, phone \ncalls it makes during the day when i'm out. if your machine is _on_ 24 hours \na day, then you can count on it to be _working_ 24 hours a day. i could call \nit from work and download a file that i might need, i could call it from \nwork and have it turn the lights on if i'm going to be late (oops, more \nwasted electricity -- but conversely, i could have it turn the lights \n_off_). heck, i suppose i could even connect the microwave and have dinner \nready when i get there.

I read in a recent Tidbits(171-2?) about the possibility of putting\na 68030 in a PB100. I am interested in doing so, but would like\nto know more about it. Does it involve just replacing the 68000 that\nis on the daughterboard, or does it involve getting a new daughter-\nboard. Also, would the 68030 be able to run QT with the PB100's\nscreen(not pretty I know, but possible?) And of course, what would\nthe damage be ($). Any info would be appreciated.\nThanks in advance.

At work we have a small appletalk network with 3 macs and  couple of printers.\nWe also have a PC that has some specialized accounting software that we would \nlike to operate from any of the macs. We have Soft PC, and I have found that the\nsoftware works just fine under it, but I would like to have all of the data\nfor the program reside at one place (the PC hard disk). So my question for you\nis(actually questions)\n\n 1) is there a board for the PC that will allow you to hook into an appletalk\n    network?\n\n 2) if #1 is possible, is there any software/hardware combination that will \n    allow me to mount the PC hard disk as a networked disk on the macs so I\n    can use Soft PC to run the application?\n\n 3) if #1 or #2 is impossible, is there any other way to accomplish what I am\n    after?
I am currently managing, among many other labs, a lab with three \nLC IIs, a Mac Plus with 45 MB external HD, and a LaserWriter II NTX. My \nproblem? The LC IIs seem to intermittently slow to a snail's pace.\n        These LC IIs have 4 MB RAM, 256K VRAM, and a Quantum LP105S HD \ninstalled. I have reformatted the drive with Hard Disk Toolkit 1.3, and \nit gives a very respectable 2.9 overall rating to this drive, so it's not \nthe drive. I have reinstalled System 7.1, MS-Word 5.1a, MS-Works 3.0, and \nso on, all from the master disks. In short, I have done everything I can \nthink of in software. I am *not* a hardware hacker, though I pop cases \nfairly often. But nothing works.\n        The problem is intermittent and unpredictable. The mouse always \nmoves smoothly, floppies always run at the same speed, but occasionally, \nfor about 1-2 hours at a time, a machine will run like it was running on \na 4 MHz 68000, not a 16 MHz 68030. It is VERY frustrating and makes it \nnearly unusable. It does seem to worsen with increasing disk activity.\n        Has anyone encountered this problem before? Has anyone got any \nideas? They would be much appreciated.\n\n                                    -- Andrew Geweke

What are the technical details of the re-work?  (I'm looking for\n	things such as the purpose of the chips with the new wires connected,\n	and the pin-outs for those chips.)\n3.	Is a board with the re-work any different functionally from one without?\n4.	Could the re-worked boards be incompatible with future releases of\n	the operating system?\n\n	and, finally,\n\n5.

Hi-\nDo any of you hardware gurus out there know what kind of memory architecture  \nApple uses in the powerbook Duos?  Or in the powerbook in general?\n\nWhat are the factors that make the Duo 210 so slow compared to a desktop  \nmachine running the same processor at the same speed (25MHz 68030)?  How many  \nwait states are in the memory system, etc?  What kind of a data bus does it  \nuse?  32-bit or 16-bit?  \n\nIt's still slow when plugged into a DuoDock.\n\nAnyone know in general what kind of shortcuts notebook manufacturers take when  \nmaking notebooks?  I heard of a 486DX2/66 notebook getting a "whopping" 10  \nMIPS rating.  A similar desktop machine should be getting about 3 times that,  \nI guess.

stem\n  I\n\n\nI've had the same experience actually. I love the Mac interface and any number\nof the features, but am sorely dissapointed with the speed. I use macs daily\nand am a Moc consultant for OSU Statistics department; I'm familiar with almost\nevery model out there, and my experience is that both the Amiga and the Atari\nST simply "blow the Mac out of the water" in terms of performance. At this time\nI would in general say that the other advantages of the Mac outweigh the\nadvantages of the Amiga or the ST (and Falcon), but I really wish Apple would\nget their heads together on speed... :-((((( They could take a real lesson in\nmuli-tasking from the Amiga OS or the MultiTOS in the Atari Falcons too :-(((\n\n > I'm still happy with my ci, but I don't understand why the performance is\n\nI just hope that someone comes out with a machine that does *everything* well\nsomeday. If I had my choice, I would go with Mac in most aspects, but add the\nspeed and superior Multi-Tasking of the other platforms.\n\nAs for the original topic; Trying to compare *just the chip* in a machine seems\nalmost worthless. A fast 386 with a wiz-bang graphics accelerator will be\nfaster in productivity for many applications than a even a stock Quadra. Add a\ngraphics accelerator to a 486 and you *really fly*. Of course, add one the the\nQuadra and then you're blowing the 486 away... etc...\n\n\nI think mine was only worth $0.01.......\n---------------------------------------------------------------------->

I believe that Apple, Sun and a number of other desktop machine\nmanufacturers have agreed with the government to incorporate\npower-saving techniques;  this is also something that governments in\nother countries are likely to require in the future, so expect to see\nit.  This may include the ability for the system to fully power down\nthe monitor, via a controllable power outlet, and power it back on\nautomatically.  (Is this a "sell" on screen saver software companies?)\n\nGoals for "idle" power consumption have been set at something like 30\nwatts for the system, not including the monitor (? don't quote me on\nthis).\n\nNote that in many businesses, the savings will be substantial,\nespecially if you factor in reduced load on air conditioning systems.\nSun did a study that indicated that simply powering off monitors for\nthe night would save the company (Sun itself) on the order of $1M per\nyear.  Putting other (and automatic) power-saving features in would\nprobably have greater than double that value.\n\nGiven that we are seeing more and more reason to leave our work and\nhome computers on (getting faxes, automatically getting email, ...),\nbuilding power consumption control into all machines has a potential to\ncut ~2% off the national power consumption, based on data I heard.
Nope.  I keep my Mac running all the time since it also acts as a\nusenet node and exchanges mail and news every half hour (I run uAccess)\nand receives all my faxes.\n\nI do turn off the monitors hooked up to it.  They produce more heat\nthan I want - it can be warm in my garage office in the summer.  I've\ngot one of those handy power control centers ($25 at Fry's) to I just\nflip the switch in front when I start or stop working.\n\nBy the way, this strategy seems to be somewhat endorsed by Apple since\ntheir new Color Classic will turn off its own monitor after a certain\nlength of idle time.
It happened to my classic ii once.  At startup, after the usual powerup\ntone, there were chimes (kinda like do(1st)-mi(1st)-sol(1st)-do(2nd) or\n1st C - 1st E - 1st G - 2nd C on the music scale), and it hanged before\ngiving the happy mac.  I had to re-powerup.\n\nThis was asked before but I can't remember the answer.  I've tried to\nfind the answer from the faqs and other ftp sites but to no avail.\n\nCan anyone tell me what those unusual chimes mean?  A spurious memory\ncheck error?

The Duo's can drive Apple's 16" monitor at 832x624 resolution and\n256 colors, I think. What non-Apple 16-17" monitors can also be\nused? Would a multisync NEC-5FG work as well at the same resolution?\nWhat are the outstanding points of the Apple monitor when compared\nwith these other monitors?
I too had a very unpleasant experience with "Hardware That's Shi*". It\nfeatured repeated lies about when things had shipped, a salesperson who\nwas totally ignorant about what he was selling, a charge for duties I\nhad specifically been assured were not payable and then a monitor (their\nhouse brand 2-page monochrome) that was the most unadulterated piece of\njunk it has ever been my misfortune to experience in the world of\nelectronics.\n\nI shipped it back and they refunded my money, but it still cost me\nsomething over $200 for long distance charges, non-refundable taxes\nand duties and lost time.
: \n: Hey,\n: \n: I'm about to purchase a DAT drive.  Does anyone know which mail order vendors\n: offer DAT drives with HP's mechanism?  What other mechanism is available out\n: there?  Good, bad points?\n\n	We bought one from Relax technologies.  BIG mistake.  The drive\nhad some jumpers set incorrectly so it didn't work at first, and the\nsoftware they shipped with it was incompatable with the drive (it was the\nnew compression model), and worst of all, when I opened the drive up to\nfiddle with the jumpers, I found the inside of the case COVERED WITH METAL\nFILINGS!!! Sorry to shout.  Apparently when they drilled the mounting holes\nin the case they forgot to clean it before putting the drive in.  This was\na HP drive, by the way, and is now working fine (knock on wood), no thanks\nto Relax technologies.\n\nHey, your mileage may vary, but let me suggest that you NOT buy from Relax\nTechnologies, even though their prices are usually about the lowest.\n\n--Dave\n==============================================================================\nDave Schwarze \n(schwarze@delphi.nosc.mil or NeXT mail schwarze@isenext2.saic.com)
By then it might be already 200$ cheaper :-))\n\nSame here at the U of MN, 1599$ for that bundle.\n\nPeter
I wonder how hard it would be (i.e. what it would add to the cost)\nto design desktop machines with a power saver feature built in which would\nreduce power consumption automatically if the machine is idle for more than\nsome amount of time.  This is pretty standard in portable machines, and the\nsame kinds of tricks could be played; spinning down disks, turning off\nscreens, reducing clock speed, etc.  The advantage of this over just turning\nthe thing off would be 1) you don't have to remember to do anything and 2)\nthe machine is still available over the network.\n\n	The tricky part might be in defining what constitutes inactivity.\nCertainly, you don't want to wake up from sleep mode just because somebody\npinged you, but you do want to wake up (at least the CPU) if somebody\nlogs in via a telnet connection.\n\n	I wouldn't worry too much about wasting electricity in the winter\nmonths; that energy is just getting turned into heat.  It may not be as\nefficient a way to heat a building as the central heating plant, but it's\nnot too bad.  In the summer though, it's a disaster.  Not only are you\nwasting that power, but you're probably also running the air conditioning to\nget rid of the waste heat.
Is it possible to rip an external SyQuest removable drive out of its\nexternal casing and install it into the 5 1/4" empty bay slot on a\nCentris 650? I know a special bracket would need to be purchased, but\nis there any power hookup/SCSI constraints that would prevent it? If\nanyone has done it, could they mail me some instructions. It doesn't\nseem to be that overwhelming an undertaking.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah, but they probably included industries and educational institutions\nthat uses mostly work stations (SUNs, DEC, IBM RS600... etc etc)  Which turns\nmonitor off if left untouched for 5 min.  \n\n- Chung Yang
...\n\n\nYes, that is what it sounds like to me, too. But before I spend\nda bucks, I want to make sure I'm right. I do have e-mail from\na (self-confessed :-) Apple-hater listing a few common problems\nwith the C610, but nothing I can't get fixed under warranty.\n\nSo, anybody else? Great or lousy?
As a side note, in that same ad (MacWorld 6/93), they are selling the 50MHz\nPowercache for the IIsi with FPU for $575. For those thinking of upgrading\nto the 040 33 MHz Turbo (an upgrade costs $600 direct from Daystar), this comes\nout to $1175, about $200 cheaper than what most mail-order companies charge.
Can anyone tell me the procedure for hooking a Personal Laserwriter NTR\nserially to a mac?  The documentation says it can be done, but I'm not sure of\nthe correct switch setting to use out of the given non-appletalk switch\noptions.  Also, will I need to install a new driver so that the Chooser knows\nthe printer is hooked up directly (not networked)?
Does anyone know if there is a carrying case for the Centris 610?  \n\nThanks for any info.
This poll was conducted to help users decide whether or not to alter their\nIIsi clock oscillator. I have attempted to gather as many case histories as\npossible to find some estimate of success and risk. The number of replies\nprobably shows how rare this modification is but give the impression that\nsuccess rates may be higher than the previous 80% estimate. 24 of 24\nmachines were able to run at 25 mhz when no add on boards were present.\nThis is not a scientific survey but it is the best we have to work with.\n\nThanks to all who contributed to this poll. \n\n\nIssues:\n\n	Speed) 25 mhz to 27.5 mhz appears to be the norm for machines without\n		add on cards. All reported machines were able to use\n		25 mhz as long as no add on cards were present. Several Apple\n		Nubus cards were in use. No machine with the Nubus adapter\n		was able to go faster than 25 mhz. One wasn't even able to\n		achieve 25 mhz with the Nubus adapter in place\n	\n		At speeds of 32 and 33 mhz, the startup sound is distorted and\n		hi density floppy disk problems have been reported.\n		\n		Note: Unless specifically listed below, machines were not\n			tested with a higher speed clock to failure. Hence,\n			the 25 mhz operational machines may well work at\n			higher speeds.\n			\n	Damage) One user reported pulling out the plating of one pad. This was\n		repaired and the machine is operational. One other\n		reported pulling the pin out of the original clock oscillator\n		during desoldering. There is one second hand report of a user\n		putting a gash in the motherboard with a slipped soldering iron.\n		\n		No reports of static discharge damage.\n		\n		No reports of high speed operation causing damage.\n		\n		Then again, I also don't have any reports from users of\n		defective parachutes.\n		\n	Add on boards) Compatibility appears to be a problem with Apple Nubus\n		Adapters. Several other add on boards have been used with\n		success. See case histories\n		\n	Heat Sinks) Virtually all modified machines had a heat sink installed.\n		These were often the TO-220 style power transistor type. Some\n		used epoxy. Some used a dab of heat sink compound with a dab\n		of cyanoacrylate glue. There was also use of a clamp with a\n		bolt through the hole in the motherboard.\n		\n		\n		\nCase Histories:	\n\nAll speeds are the effective CPU speed (1/2 of clock oscillator). All reported\nCPU versions were 20 mhz.\n\n1)  27.5 mhz operational.

Interesting delema for all those out there.\nMy school is discussing installing a Mac lab of 10 to 15 stations for our Bio\n100 to 103 classes to do a study with pig disections.  (no joke)  Here is the\ndeal. We can get this grant to do a study on if it is more feasible to do a\ndisection via the computer or via the real thing.  My problem is I was somehow\ndrawn into this project (being done by students who want to go Mac but know\nNADA about them, being the man mac man on campus, guess who they came to?) so I\nwnt to know what would probably be the best hardware to fill the follwoing\nlist?  Right now we are looking at the C650 8/80 and the 2vx 5/80 platforms.\nOk here it goes:\n\n	We are using cd-rom, so ought we go with the internal Apple Cd-roms\noffered as options in the 650 and vx or go external. It is a matter of price\nand reliability, the second being VERY important.\n	How much RAM?  I was thinking 5-8 more leaning towards 8?  What do you\nthink?\n	Ok, called apple educational discounts and they said their keyboard\n(extended) is 160.30. Is it better to go with the Apple and their long time\ngreat wear and tear record, or is there a 3rd party extended keyboard that is\njust a reliable?  Price?\n	Printers:  One color printer we are presently leaning towrds the\nThermal Wax Tektronic 200e or 200i (Probably the e as we are going to limit\naccess so we don't needed the i's networkability)  So, what do you think in\nterms of color printers?  Different brand?  Kind (Dye Sublimation?  Ink Jet?) \nPrice? Companies?  1800 #s?  Also, we are looking to get a laser printer or\nsuch to network into the whole lab for noraml printing.  The fornt runner is\nthe Apple Pro650 (is that right don't have my notes here?) at 1650. \nSuggestions?  We have kids using these things all day if this lab goes through\nand they know nothing about it for the most part. It has to be reliable, easy\nto maintain, and economical (ie, not high priced paper cartidges, etc).\n	Finally, and this is my little dig into the Project. What about netting\nthese things?  We have ether nearby and I would like to slap the macs on the\nnet, but, server?  Individual ether?  Forget about it it is going to be\nastronomically priced and the school is going to laugh at you when you ask\nthem?\n	Little more info, I am a Poli Sci major who just happens to know alot\nabout macs but this is a bit out of my league, not to mention I don't have the\ntime to go and look for all of this stuff.

Hi, Terry. Its me again. I couldn't agree with you more.\nI finally received my Datadesk keyboard a month after sendng it to\nDatadesk to have it checked.  They didn't tell me over the phone that\nyou had to wait before pressing the shift key to disable extensions.\nActually, they did, but not until a day before my keyboard\narrived. But a month earlier, they were of no help at all.\nI really think they need to put a disclaimer on their keyboard\nmanual.

hello out in networld,\n\n       We have a lab of old macs(SEs and Pluses).

For what it's worth, my experience has been that the educational\ndiscount (which my S.O. has taken advantage of, as a teacher) is roughly\nequivalent to the corporate discounts that I'm able to get as an employee of\na fairly large multi-state corporation, which is usually at least as good as\nwhat one can get at one of the "discount" computer chains (e.g. CompUSA).\n	For purposes of budget estimation around here, we usually just knock\naround 20% off SRP. \n	************************************************************\n	*  	The_Doge of South St. Louis			   *\n	*		Dobbs-Approved Media Conspirator(tm)	   *\n	*	"One Step Beyond"  -- Sundays, 3 to 5 pm	   *\n	*		88.1 FM		St. Louis Community Radio  *\n	*  "You'll pay to know what you *really* think!"           *\n	*			-- J.R.

Not without replacing most of the chips on the motherboard. The C610\nisn't like the IIsi was, meaning that the motherboard of the C610 is \nactually designeds to run at the speed of the CPU, and not designed to\nrun at a higher speed (like 25MHz) but be forced to run at the speed of\na slower CPU (20MHz).\n\n\n    There is more than one oscillator. If you are talking about the CPU\noscillator chip, I think that it is located under the socket for the\n'040. At least this is what I have read in some other posts in this\ngroup.

You shouldn't have ignored the ZyXEL.  It can be purchased with a "Mac\nbundle", which includes a hardware-handshaking cable and FaxSTF software.\nThe bundle adds between $35 and $60 to the price of the modem, depending\non the supplier.  It is true that the modem has no Mac-specific docs,\nbut it doesn't require much 'tweaking' (aside from setting &D0 in the\ninit string, to enable hardware handshaking).\n\nFor more information on the ZyXEL, including sources, look at various files \non sumex-aim.stanford.edu, in info-mac/report.
There has been no empirical evidence to support the first statement.  True,\nthere is a power surge at startup that has the potential to do damage, but\nthe internal power supply is well-protected. (I've turned my Mac on and off \nsix or seven times a day for three years without problem).  The monitor is\nthe same.  To leave it on is to waste a lot of electricity -- twice as much\nas a television, possibly more.\n\nTurn it off when you're not using it.  It'll save you money and the world\na few more resources.\n\n-Kelley-\n-- \n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nThomas Kelley Boylan, PowerPC, IBM Austin, kelleyb@austin.ibm.com

Hello,\n\nI saw this question posted a week or so ago, but as far as I could tell no\nanswer appeared on the net. What is the good oil on connecting the Apple\nExtended Keyboard to a PowerBook? The earlier questioner wonderd if this would\nbe too much of a load for the PB and as I want to connect just such a beast I\nam curious.\n\nI haven't got a PB yet so I can't RTFM but I assume that a standard keyboard\nwith a mouse would be ok as the spec sheet I read mentioned connecting an\nexternal keyboard. But is the Extended plus mouse pushing it?\n\nAny help gratefully recieved. I will summarise to the net if necessary.\n\nThanks, John Collins.
In the last two weeks I have the following problem on two 160's\n\n1 has a 8Mb Simm and the other a 6 Mb simm\nBoth are about 2 -3 months old, bought from different vendors and installed\nby different people. \n\nBoth computers begin crashing frequently, locking up and ultimately the\nMemory Chimes.  Crashes would almost always occur if you moved the screen\nand sometimes would occur when you weren't even touching the computer.  In\nboth cases, taking the machine apart, taking the memory out and putting it\nback in solved the problem for awhile but then it would comeback,  my\nmarginally educated guess as to what's happening is that larger SIMMS are\n"lopsided" in that the insertion point is sort of a pivot point and after\ntime they begin to move about - possible because of pressure on the\nkeyboard or something?  \n\nAnyway, has anyone else had such a problem or solution - If somehow you\ncould support the other end of the simm to prevent it from moving.\n\nI've had no problem for the past 3 weeks by replacing my 8Mb simm with a\n2Mbsimm -although this is NOT desireble solution.\n\nPlease email any resp - and/or post if usefull to the rest of the world.\n\nTed
None of the SUNs, DECs, or RS6000s I've used have turned off the\nmonitor automatically.
Here is how I modified my Quadra 700 for higher speed. Previously I\nhad been using a Variable Speed Overdrive for accelerating my CPU\nbut this modification is testing out as more stable at higher speeds.\n\nYour mileage may vary. The top speed you achieve cannot be predicted\nbefore hand. My personal Q700 has tested fine up to 32 mhz thus far.\nI didn't have higher speed clock oscillators on hand to test higher\nspeeds.\n\nParts\n\n	Clock Oscillators (4 pin TTL variety) You will need a selection of\n	speeds beginning at 50 mhz on up. The CPU will run at 1/2 the\n	oscillator speed. The original one is a 50 mhz unit. I recommend\n	getting a 50 mhz clock in case you damage the existing one.\n\n	   I obtained my clock oscillators from DigiKey 1-800-344-4539 for\n	   less than $5.00 each. Some of their part numbers are:\n\n		   50 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # X121)\n		   62 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # X136)\n		   66 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # CTX137)\n\n	   Don't get the half size clock oscillators. They won't fit.\n\n	   There are also CMOS clock oscillators. I haven't tried one in a\n	   Quadra. (They work fine in IIsi's)\n	   \n	Socket: Obtain a 4 pin socket which is in the same form factor as\n	   a 14 pin DIP package. Alternatively, use 4 machined socket pins\n	   from an Augat style socket. Just cut them out of the socket.\n\n	Cooling Fan: A very small 12 volt fan to keep the CPU cool is a \n	   must. My VSO came with a specially modified heatsink which had\n	   a fan built onto it. It had a pass-through connector which\n	   tapped into the hard drive power cable. You should rig up \n	   something similar or risk frying your CPU.\n	   \nProcedure\n\n1)  Insert usual disclaimer and antistatic warnings here.\n\n2)  Remove the top lid of the machine. You will see the floppy disk and\n    hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static\n    precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do\n    this. Unplug ALL cables, wall and monitor power supply cords from\n	the back of the mac.\n \n3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the\n    tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.\n    The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the\n    tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may\n    also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power\n    supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you\n    need release.\n \n4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon\n    SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable\n    leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.\n    The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed\n    to release it.\n                                            \n5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount\n\n6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A\n    phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop\n    it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful\n    here.\n\n7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the\n    right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding\n	posteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then\n	lift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.\n\n8)  Remove the interrupt switch assembly. It is a strangely shaped plastic\n    device at the left, front edge of the motherboard. Pull the middle,\n	rear plastic prong up and forward. The entire device will release.\n	\n9)  Unplug the speaker cable. Squeeze the plastic tab on the speaker to\n    free it then swing it backwards to free it from the case.\n	\n10) Remove the motherboard form the case. Lift the front right corner of\n    the motherboard about 1 mm. This allows it to clear the clear plastic\n	Power light guide. Slide the motherboard forward about 1 cm. The\n	motherboard then comes directly out.\n	\n11) Locate the 50 mhz clock crystal. It is a small metal box near the\n    CPU chip. Note and remember its orientation. The new clock oscillators\n	must be aligned with pin 1 in the same orientation.\n	\n	Very carefully desolder and remove the old clock oscillator. Some of\n	the pins may be bent over. Simply desolder then unbend them. Be sure\n	your desoldering iron is hot enough before heating the board.\n	\n	I used a suction desoldering iron to accomplish this task. This is\n	NOT appropriate for a first soldering experience. The motherboard is\n	a multi-layer design with very fine traces - easily damaged without\n	proper care.\n	\n12) Install your socket or socket pins where the old oscillator once was.\n\n13) Put a 50 mhz clock oscillator into the new socket. You could use the\n	old clock but it has solder on its pins. This may come of inside the\n	socket and cause corrosion problems later. I suggest using a new\n	50 mhz clock.\n	\n14) Install your cooling fan system to complete the modification.\n	\n14) Reinsert the motherboard and slide it into place.\n\n15) Snap in the interrupt switch assembly and speaker to lock the mother\n    board firmly. Plug the speaker wire back into the motherboard.\n	\n16) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the\n    tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about\n	1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into\n	place while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.\n    Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks\n    into place.\n	\n17) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY\n    DRIVE CABLE.\n\n18) Replace the phillips head screw\n\n19) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.\n\n20) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount.\n\n21) Reattach your cables and power cords. Cross your fingers and turn \n    on the Mac. It should make the usual power on chord. If it doesn't,\n	something is amiss. Immediately turn of the power and recheck your\n	handiwork. If all is not well, you have my sincere condolences.\n	\n	Hopefully, all will work normally. Turn the machine back off and\n	replace the 50 mhz clock oscillator with a faster one. Reboot and\n	be astounded. \n	\n	You will need to fully test the machine for many hours before deciding\n	a particular speed is truly usable. With my VSO, a machine lock-up\n	might take 8 hours of operation to occur. In the brief time since\n	modifying my clock oscillator (36 hours) I have not had a single\n	problem.\n	\nGood Luck to all who attempt this modification. There is a small but real\nrisk, but you could well reach Quadra 950 speeds or higher with less than\n$50 in parts.
A friend is heavily into MIDI and is using a Quadra 900 (maybe 950) with \nall but one NuBus slot populated with arcane music hardware and a video\ncard.  He reports 8 bit video is too slow for good real-time display of\nwhat he needs to see.  He also reports that the built-in video is even\nworse.  He's not a Mac guru, and I haven't seen the system, so this is\nabout all I know.\n\nI suspect that his NuBus is heavily loaded, and think improvements might\ncome from a switch to an accelerated PDS slot video card.  Does this\nsound right?  Who makes a PDS accelerated video card for the Quadra thats\nworth looking at?  Any other suggestions?  Thanks in advance!

REPOST - DUE TO NET PROBLEMS\n\nHi,\n   I have problems with the FDHD on a IICX that EKG reports is ROM\nrevision 376. I had reports that this Mac was having trouble \nformatting disks and by the time I got to it, the FDHD just would\nnot respond although all other functions were fine.\n\nI checked the voltages on the DB19 external drive connector and pin\n6 showed no volts with 7 and 8 giving 25volts unloaded. The power \nsupply is an Astec and I sent it away for repair.\n\nWith the power supply reinstalled, I now get the following error:\n\nWith the internal FDHD connected, the Mac boots fine but on completion\nof boot cycle an alert displays "The disk is unreadable - do you\nwant to eject it?". For every combination of response, the alert \nreappears within approx 2 seconds and this error is continuous. The\nFDHD does spin but there is no head seeking and the FDHD is incapable\nof ejecting the disk. This error sequence occurs regardless of whether\nthere is a floppy in the drive or not. Pin 6 on the DB19 external \nconnector shows 1.2V, pins 7 and 8 show 10.75V.\n\nWith the internal FDHD disconnected, the Mac boots fine and works great \n(MacEKG reports no errors). The DB19 external connector now shows\nno voltage on pin 6 but pins 7 and 8 show 10.75V.\n\nNow, the internal FDHD may be fubar, but I have an apple 800K external\ndrive that gives exactly the same symptoms as the internal drive when\nconnected to either the external DB19 or the internal connector at J16\n(after suitable surgery to the external drive). The voltages at J16 \n(with the internal FDHD disconnected) are as follows:\n\n	PIN	Volts	PIN	Volts\n	1	-	2	5\n	3	-	4	5\n	5	-	6	5\n	7	-	8	-\n	9	-	10	5\n	11	-	12	-\n	13	10.75	14	5\n	15	10.75	16	5\n	17	10.75	18	-\n	19	10.75	20	5\n\nThis machine has a SWIM which I don't think EKG tests. I have tested all\ndiodes and pica fuses and can find no problems. Does anybody have any\nideas ?\n\n                        Best wishes,\n                          Woody.\n\n                               Paul Woodman

PSI makes an internal fax modem for the map portable (1-800-622-1722) but \nasks too much for it (retail $450). I'd buy an external and save about \n$350. \n\nthere is a manufacturer that still makes INTERNAL HD's for the portable, \nthey're listed in some of the catalog "magazines" for apple stuff you can \nfind at bookstores. If I see it again I'll post it. But, again, you might \nwant to just add a small lightweight external HD built for the \npowerbooks. You'd be able to use it with a new computer some day.

About as hard as it was to design the Color Classic, since it's\nmonitor behaves in just this manner.
This is something I asked before, but I don't think I got an answer, or\nmaybe I lost the answer, or maybe it's just an obvious question (:->). Will \nthe GX stuff (on-line docs etc.) be available on the DEVELOP CDs, or will it \nonly go out to people in the Developer's program and such? Just curious.
I don't know the answer to your direct question, but if the Mac Superdrive can  \nread MS-DOS disks (can it??) then you can transfer files between the NeXT and  \na Mac by using MS-DOS formatted disks since the NeXT *can* read/write that  \nformat.  And if you're interested in transferring files, you can also do it  \nover the serial port using kermit.
What is the maximum rate of the 6882 FPU that Apple sells directly (Apple\nPart No. M6775 LL/A)?  The Apple literature labels the FPU for Classics and\nLC III's so I assume it will do at least 25MHz.  My question is can I put\nit in a Performa 600 (68030 @ 32MHz)?  The Apple price is cheap at $78\ncompared to ~$135 from mail order houses.  Any one know the answer to this\none?
I thought I'd share a good experience, too.  I bought the APS Quantum 240 zero\nfootprint drive in May '92 (back when they still used two separate LEDs on the\nfront panel and the case was metal).  While traveling with it (it was in my\nSE/30 Mac bag, on top of the Mac) this past winter, one of the plastic tabs\nholding the front panel on broke, so that the right side of the front panel\nwas coming forward away from the rest of the drive.  I lived with this situation\nuntil it became completely intolerable (which more or less coincided with a\nnetwork shutdown at school and a trip out of town I had to take, which gave me\nsome dead time during which to have the drive sent out).\n\nI called APS for an RMA # and got one, with no questions asked about how the\ntab got broken (it was handled a little roughly by airline baggage handlers --\nthough nothing else was damaged [well, except for the internal speaker in my\nmodem, which wasn't that well glued down to begin with] -- yeah, yeah, I'm\nnever flying with my SE/30 again).  And when I called back to ask whether I\ncould send it in a little later rather than right away, they had no problem\nwith that -- even when I exceeded the normal valid period for an RMA # by a\nday (they're usually good for 10 days).  The front panel was replaced under\nwarranty, and the drive was shipped back quickly (I mailed it first class\ninsured on a Saturday by noon from L.A. to Missouri, and it came back by Fed\nEx by Friday [I don't know exactly what day it came back because I was\ntraveling that week from Wednesday afternoon to Sunday afternoon]).\n\nThe only thing that could've been bad was that the first service rep I talked\nto, in an attempt to prevent jeopardizing my data, suggested that I take the\ndrive mechanism out and send just the case.  Unfortunately, I discovered the\nday I was mailing the thing, that would necessitate breaking the little\nseal and thus voiding the warranty!  Oh, well.
Hi, \n\nI posted that article. Unfortunately I haven't seen any further notice of\nit. They advertize cheaper Duo's at the U here for next wek. According\nto the articel though, the price cut had to be effective the same day.\n\nnewsbyte is a group of news like clarinet.
[deleted]\n\n This is a pet peeve of mine. I wish companies would put power switches on the\n front of the equipment! If my Apple monitor had the switch on the front, I\n would happily power it off at night.

8 MB SIMMs do not have to be composite SIMMs, although many (most?) 16 MB \nSIMMs are.  72-pin SIMMs allow two memory banks per SIMM, thus permitting \nthe use of 4 Mb DRAM devices (the same ones used on 4 MB SIMMs) to be used \nfor two 4 MB banks on one SIMM.  I can't imagine that it would be cheaper \nto build an 8 MB SIMM using 1 Mb DRAMs as the 4 Mb parts reached (and \nexceeded) bit for bit price parity with the 1 Mb parts some time ago.  \nIt's probably possible to build a single-bank 8 MB SIMM using 4 Mb parts - \nthis could cause problems in a Q800.  I'm not sure why you'd want to do \nthis, though, as a dual-bank 8 MB SIMM would be cheaper to build than a \nsingle-bank composite one.

Your source is wrong.  The double speed CD300 is still slow compared to a\ntypical hard disk.  The LC can easily handle the SCSI transfer rate of the\nCD300.  None of the current Macs, even the Quadras, support SCSI-2 unless\nyou get a SCSI-2 Nubus Card.\n\n  You don't have to have double speed to use PhotoCD.  It's just faster\nreading images off of a disk.  I think that the CD150 can handle PhotoCD,\nbut only single session.  The CD300 can do multisession PhotoCD.

I am, at long last, going to replace my beloved 512ke.\nI am looking at a new LC III and a used IIci.  Prices\nhave yet to be worked out, so I'm just thinking right now\nabout their merits and drawbacks.\n\nHere's what I've thought of:\n\nThe IIci has much greater potential for expansion, a la NuBus and\ngreater memory capacity.\n\nThe LC III would be new, under warranty, newer ROMs (is the IIci\n"32-bit clean"?), and would have sound input.  I also like the\n"pizza-box" case.\n\nPerformance-wise, I have read that they are almost identical, the\nLC III being a little slower.\n\nSo, which should I get?

Hey All-\n\nWe have an old (1990) external HD attached to the Plus in our lab.  It had  \ngiven us flawless service until last week.  The problem: Someone in our lab  \nhas an old 512 that was upgraded a couple years ago to a Plus with an  \naftermarket SIMM/SCSI setup (Digigraphics "SIMMer").  the DB25 SCSI plug runs  \nthrough the back of the machine and attaches to the board with a 26-pin  \nrectangular connector.  Well, this guy had removed the back from the machine,  \nto put more memory in, and had disconnected the the SCSI plug.  Since the  \n26-pin connector is symmetrical (not keyed) he may have reinstalled it upside  \ndown, essentially reversing the pins on the DB25.  He came in and asked if he  \ncould try out our HD on his SCSI port (it had never been used).  Naive fools  \nthat we are, we said o.k..  His computer failed to recognize the drive.  Now,  \nnone of the computers in our lab will recognize it.  We tried Disk Doctor, and  \nit doesn't recognize anything on the SCSI chain.  Could installing the SCSI  \nupside down have wrecked the HD's driver board?  The drive seems to spin up  \nall right and unpark itself upon powerup.  The events are too coincidental to  \nattribute the problem to stiction.\n\nAny help greatly appreciated-

Hi everyone,\n      I'm experiencing a very annoying problem with background printing\non the HP Deskwriter (Sys 7.1, Deskwriter driver 3.1, PowerBook 170).\nWhen I print from, say, MS Word, I see the message "Spooling to disk,"\nbut sometimes nothing prints. Checking my memory map thanks to Now Menus,\nI see that HP Backgrounder has not loaded. Restarting fixes this. It\nseems to me that HP Backgrounder is quitting unexpectedly, and that its\nstatus as "Multifinder NOT aware" allows it to do this without my being\ninformed by a message such as "HP Backgrounder quit unexpectedly." Have\nyou ever seen this problem before.\n        There may or may not be a related problem. I have experienced\nproblems in putting my computer to sleep. Choosing "sleep" from the\nFinder menu sometimes does nothing. Today on a whim I checked the memory\nmap, and I discovered that HP backgrounder was not loaded. Restarted\nreloaded HP backgrounder, and I was able to put my machine to sleep as\nusual. Just a mere coincidence or is the HP backgrounder crash preventing\nmy machine from going to sleep?\n	Has anyone seen this problem? I'm seriously considering the purchase of\na StylewriterII because of the poor quality of the HP software.
We were told that the resolution on the 5FGe could only go to 1024x768.\n\nAnd that the 5 FG could go to 1152x870.\n\nHas anybody tried running these higher resolutions??\n\nSomewhere I thought I read that the 1152x870 on a 17" monitor may make the\ntype too small to read.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\nSteve
