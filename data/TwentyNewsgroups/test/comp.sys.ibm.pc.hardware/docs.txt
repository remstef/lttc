Wondering if somebody could tell me if we can change the cluster size of\nmy IDE drive.  Normally I can do it with Norton's Calibrat on MFM/RLL drives\nbut dunno if I can on IDE too.
As an earlier post noted - through DMA.\n\n\n\nAny one time means IMHO a single byte xfer. If I have four sources of\nDMA requests ready, the DMA would service the one after the other. If\nthe bandwidth for the four together is lower than the ISA/DMA\nbandwidth, this will work.\n\nNote that the bus mastering here is the priority mechanism in the DMA\ncontroller.\n\n--\nPenio Penev  x7423 (212)327-7423 (w) Internet: penev@venezia.rockefeller.edu
: Hello\n\n: I've got an old Trident 8800CS SVGA card, but lacking suitable drivers\n: for windows 3.1. The drivers for the 8900 series seem to be incompatible.\n: Does anyone have an idea of where to get these drivers? Address for an\n: ftp-site would be nice. \n\n: Thanks in advance\n\n: Jouni\n\n: _______________________________________________________________________________\n: Jouni Marttila - Yo-kyl{ 11 B 25,  20540 Turku,  FINLAND - +358 21 374624____\n: jmarttila@abo.fi - jmarttila@finabo - abovax::jmarttila - jjmartti@utu.fi__\n: PGP-key available via finger jmarttila@abo.fi ___________________________\n\nYou can find the drivers at wuarchive.wustl.edu in the /msdos/windows3 sub-\ndirectory.  I think the files are called "tvgawin31a.zip" and "tvgawin31b.zip."\nThose are the latest drivers available as far as I know.
Make sure that the hard disk you want to boot from is set as active (using the\nFDISK program that comes with DOS).
I've posted a couple of notes about encountering this problem. Based on some \nsuggestions from:\n\nMark Aitchison, University of Canterbury, New Zealand.\n	and\nChris A. Larrieu @cs.wm.edu\n\nI think that my problem is a screen saver that also outputs sound (to my \nPC speaker). I'm still looking at some of the other screen savers that I \nuse (with a randomizer), but this one definately caused the loss of several \nminutes over night (but not the date this time).
This is normally the case, but make sure you get a board with a plug in oscillator\nas you will screw up your warranty if you start to solder the board.
OK, here's my results so far....\n\n1: You have to define the monitor as LCD - it doesn't really support\n   Analogue video input (It works, but isn't very linear...)\n\n2: The incoming sync pulses need inverting. This is best achieved\n   with either a cmos XOR package or a transistor inverter.\n   If you don't know how to do it, don't even contemplate it.. :-)\n\n3: It'll only work in standard VGA mode.\n\nOK, having said that, I'm trying to either find a circuit or IC\nwhich will act as a universal sync decoder.\n\nI want somethikng which basically only detects the leading sync\npulse edge, and doesn't care about the polarity, outputting\nthe -ve going pulses that the atari monitor requires.\n\nThere are 2 reasons for doing this\n\n1: VGA cards change their sync polarity depending which mode they're\n   in - herc emulation is +,- while MVGA is +,+ for example.\n\n2: It means I don't have to put a toggle switch on the back of the\n   monitor in order to be able to run it off both the atari and my\n   IBM. Currently I have 3 (Yes, 3!) monitors sitting on my desk,\n   and I want to get that number down as much as possible.\n   Being able to use the atari monitor as a paper-white VGA\n   will cut things down to 2. If I forget about Atari colour,\n   I can get down to 1.\n\nUltimately, the best course of action is to get a multisync monitor,\nbut I'm as pressed for cash as anyone else, so it'll have to wait...
I'm writing a driver that needs to remap some I/O ports.  This means\nvirtual mode.  Unfortunately virtual mode means it won't get along\nwith expanded memory managers, so I need make it an EMM driver too.\n\nDoes anyone out there have EMM code.  Can any point me to an EMM code source?\n\n-Thanks, Morgan
I am DESPERATELY trying to find a PC based e-mail wide area network service\nor the necessary network software to establish one myself. While I am aware\nthere are various BBS's and other similar services avalible (like Compuserve,\nCanada Remote Systems etc.) I require fairly specific criteria. In \napproximate order of importance they are:\n\n1) The mail/files/news are read/written locally and batched to the network\n   server. (ie. no continuous on-line connection)(NOTE: all users are remote\n   and will use modems over conventional phone lines.)\n\n2) Simple. The users I have for the system have very little computer knowledge\n   have never heard of Unix, and have very little interest in learning. It is\n   essential that the client software is completely pain-free.\n\n3) Cheap. We would prefer not paying high connect fees to an established\n   commercial network, just so we can send large files between members of the\n   group - hence (1). In addition I would like the network server to be\n   something small, simple and inexpensive like a 486. (There are only about\n   40 people in the group, so it is not a huge network.)\n\n4) The capability for Internet access (for news/mail).\n\n5) Internet style id's (eg. pwood@math.uwaterloo.ca)\n\n\n   If anyone knows of a system similar to what I am describing, even if it\ndoesn't sastisfy all my criteria, and I don't care where it is, PLEASE PLEASE\ne-mail me and tell me about it. We are not adverse to making alterations to\nan existing system if necessary.

Hmm your CD-Rom program must be using some oddball VGA modes.\n\n  I think they are trying to get it out by the end of this month, when\nit is released though it'll be in limited quantities, I think they\nhave quite a back order right now (the 2 megs version will come out\na bit later).\n\n  Since you have a Viewsonic 17 (I think it has a 78khz horizontal\nfrequency right?), you're gonna love the 2 megs version.  It can\ndo 1280x1024x256 at 75Hz, 1152x900x256 at 80Hz, 1024x768x256 at 90Hz(!),\n1024x768x65536 at 75Hz.  It can also do 640x480x16 mil. and\n800x600x16 bit at 90Hz, too bad I don't have such a high bandwidth \nmonitor like yours ;) ;) (most of those modes need a 78khz monitor,\notherwise you'll have to use a lower refresh rate)\n\n  If you want more info. about the coming Graphite VL, you should\ngo to the IBM hardware section on Compuserve (IBMHW), in the\nvideo sig.  There're several Hercules reps there that are very\nhelpful.
I'm in need of a videotaped copy of a pc (pd) program.  Please let me know if\nyou can do this.
[ First of all, please edit your postings.  Wading through 50 lines of\n  quoted crud, which people have already read, makes people much less\n  likely to help you.  Of course, if you don't want to be helped, that's\n  your problem.  ;-) ]\n\n\n     No, it's not true.  You can get SCSI and IDE to work together, but\nthere are restrictions (at least with the Adaptec 1542):\n\n* You MUST boot from the IDE drive.  There is no way to boot from the\n  SCSI drive if you have both IDE and SCSI drives.\n\n* You MUST disable the SCSI ROM BIOS (I'm not sure about this, though),\n  and so you must also use some special drivers to access the SCSI\n  drive.  (Hmm.  I know that you have to disable something related to\n  the SCSI BIOS, but I'm not sure if it is the ROM itself.)\n\n     Back in February, someone asked about IDE and SCSI (this question\ngets asked again and again).  At the end of this message, I've included\nan edited copy of my reply.  You might find it interesting.\n\n     -- Darryl Okahata\n	Internet: darrylo@sr.hp.com\n\nDISCLAIMER: this message is the author's personal opinion and does not\nconstitute the support, opinion or policy of Hewlett-Packard or of the\nlittle green men that have been following him all day.\n\n===============================================================================\n\n     For MSDOS applications, ISA-based SCSI and IDE controllers\ngenerally have comparable throughput.  You might get slightly higher\nthroughput with a SCSI disk, but you'll also pay more for the disk\n($30-$100 and up, in some cases).  You'll also pay much, much more for a\ngood SCSI controller.\n\n     Note that good SCSI controllers really show their power if they're\nused with a good multitasking operating system (like a PC Unix).\nUnfortunately, neither MSDOS nor Windows 3.1 is a good multitasking\noperating system.  The performance advantage of SCSI controllers is\nmostly wasted with these, which leaves the advantage of being able to\nconnect multiple devices to the SCSI bus as the only advantage.\nHowever, note that you can expect to pay a premium for SCSI devices.\n\n     If you're only going to be using MSDOS, stick with IDE.  It's\ncheaper, and you'll have less headaches.\n\n\n[ Note: the following is true for MSDOS/Windows only.  Who knows what\n  the future holds for Windows NT and Unix??? ]\n\n     No.  Generally, you have to find drivers for each SCSI device,\nwhich probably don't exist unless you're using one of the "better"/"high\nperformance" SCSI controllers.  These are typically bus-mastering SCSI\ncontrollers that cost around $180-$400 (street prices) and up, and\ndrivers that allow you to connect these controllers to popular\nname-brand SCSI devices either come with the card, or can be purchased\n(for under $100 list price).  Examples of such driver kits are:\n\n* Adaptec's EZ SCSI kit (list: $75).  This works only with Adaptec SCSI\n  controllers.\n\n* CorelSCSI! (from the same people who make CorelDRAW!) (list: $99 (?)).\n  This driver kit will supposedly work with any SCSI controller card\n  that has an ASPI driver, like the Adaptec.\n\n     Central Point's PC Tools for DOS 8.0 supports a number of SCSI tape\ndrives (the documentation lists 40 tape drives).  Unfortunately, it\nworks only with Adaptec controllers.\n\n\n     Yes, you will run into problems, if you're using a\nhigh-performance, bus-mastering SCSI controller.  This doesn't sound\nright, doesn't it?  It's true, though.  With one of these controllers,\nyou'll probably have to tweak your system to get it to work with sound\ncards, floppy-controller-based tape drives (like the CMS Jumbo 250), and\nWindows 3.1.  I know.  I've been to h*ll and back getting my SCSI\ncontroller to work with various hardware/software (thank God for tape\nbackups).  If you want a copy of my "Adaptec 1542 hints and tips" file,\nsend email.\n\n     These problems aren't really the fault of the SCSI controller card;\nthe problems are really with the general hardware and software design of\nthe PC (e.g., no standards).  However, adding a bus-mastering SCSI card\nis what brings these problems to the surface and makes them visible.
I have two SCSI hard drives, each has 512KB of 'cache'.\n\nThere several reasons for this :-\n\nWhen the drive has read requested data from the disk the SCSI bus may be\nbusy. This data needs to be stored some where until the bus is free and\nthe data can be transmitted.\n\nWhen the drive receives data to be written, the data can come down the bus\nfaster than the drive can write it to the disk. It needs to be stored\nsomewhere while the disk is writing it out.\n\nIn these situations the memory is being used as a buffer NOT a cache!\n\nMay be the drive does some read-adead caching as well...\n\n\nGuy
Depends on the FDC but generally No.  The drive at the end after the twist \nshould be set as Drive 0\nSince you're using the 5.25 as drive A: it should be at the end after the \ntwist with the resistor pack fitted.\nYes\n\nHope this helps.  I had exactly the same problems.  Unfortunately when\nI changed to different machine the problems started again because\nof a different FDC.  Seems (don't flame me, this is mainly guess work\nfrom practicle experience) that some FDC's do different things with the \nselect.
I just bought a new AMIECU EISA motherboard and an Adaptec 1742A fast-SCSI \ncontroller. I wanted to install the AHA-1742A and did as written in the\nAMIECU manual.

: Just curious why floptical drives never seemed to catch on. Remember\n: those 21 Mb disks that look and feel like 3.5" floppies? These drives\n: are SCSI devices and can read and write both 720 Kb and 1.44/21 Mb\n: disks. Sounds to me to be one great product for the PC market. Are the\n: prices really that unaffordable compared to CD-ROMs which are currently\n: not rewritable? I know about the new rewritable CDs and expect SONY to\n: develop the first MDs for the computer. My question is: why isn't there\n: any substantial interest in developing the flopticals?\n\nCertainly in the UK the 21Mb flopticals are about the same price as a\ncheap CD-ROM now (you seem to be able to get them for around GBP\n200-250). However the bigger optical drives (e.g. 128Mb) are much more\nexpensive - around the GBP 1000 mark.\n\nA couple of questions that someone may be able to answer - the 21Mb\nflopticals - are they direct drop in replacements for a floppy or do\nthey need driver software etc. I.e. do you just rip out the floppy\ndrive, plug the same cables into the floptical, stick in a flopti-disk\nand hey presto you have a 21Mb floppy. This sounds far too easy.\n\nOn the subject of Sony developing MDs for computers, I have reread a\nPCW article on this subject and there it says that Sony have been doing\noptical drives for other people for some time and may be about to do a\nproduct themselves. From the article it seems that the audio MD format\nis a byproduct of their computer storage work - the MD  mechanism is\nidentical to their MO computer optical drives. A Sony spokesman was\nquoted as saying that a 2.5" MD disk would hold about 100Mb of data\nthough he refused to comment on any possibility of this being\nproductized.\n\nThe article said that one of the problems holding back development in\nthis area was lack of sensible standards plus there are at least 2\ndistinct optical storage mechanisms around at present. Given that it\nprobably needs MDs being used as a distribution medium to get it\ninto the market and since this has already been cornered by CDs it\nprobably needs someone to come in with a very strong marketting lead\nto get MDs accepted.\n\n--

Below is the list of large (at least 18 inches diagonal) monochrome\nmonitors which Computer Shopper lists as PC compatible.  I've omitted\nRadius because Radius states that they no longer support the PC.\n\nYou will notice that Nanao is the only one which supports a 31.5Khz\nhorizontal frequency, which is the frequency normally used by VGA cards\nat boot up.  My guess is that all the other monitors come with their\nown graphics cards.  I've left voice mail with Nanao asking them to\nsend me some literature, and will report back to the net after I've\nstudied it.\n\nThe prices given appear to be list prices and have little relationship\nto reality.\n					Kenneth Almquist\n\n\n\n--------------------------------- cut here ---------------------------------\n\nCornerstone Technology\n1990 Concourse Dr.\nSan Jose, CA 95131\n408-435-8900\n\n  DualPage 120:\n    Diagonal:        19 inches\n    Max Resolution:  1600x1280\n    Frequencies:     105Khz horizontal, 76Hz vertical\n    Dimensions:      19x18x17 inches\n    Price:           $1495\n    Compatible with: PC;PS/2\n\n  DualPage 150:\n    Diagonal:        19 inches\n    Max Resolution:  2048x1538\n    Frequencies:     105Khz horizontal, 67Hz vertical\n    Dimensions:      19x18x17 inches\n    Price:           $1595\n    Compatible with: PC;PS/2\n\n\nIkegami Electronics (U.S.A.), Inc.\n37 Brook Ave.\nMaywood, NJ 07670\n201-368-9171\n\n  DM-2010AD:\n    Diagonal:        20 inches\n    Max Resolution:  1280x1024\n    Frequencies:     48-64Khz horizontal, 59-80Hz vertical\n    Price:           $995\n    Compatible with: PC\n\n\nImage Systems Corp.\n11595 K-Tel\nHopkins, NM 55343\n800-462-4370 or 612-935-1171\n\n  M21LMAX:\n    Diagonal:        21 inches\n    Max Resolution:  2048x1536\n    Frequencies:     48-108Khz horizontal, 60-80Hz vertical\n    Dimensions:      17x20x19 inches\n    Price:           $1995\n    Compatible with: PC;PS/2;Mac\n\n  M21LV-65MAX:\n    Diagonal:        21 inches\n    Max Resolution:  1280x1024\n    Frequencies:     15-65Khz horizontal, 55-90Hz vertical\n    Price:           $4695\n    Compatible with: PC;PS/2;Mac\n\n  M21PMAX :\n    Diagonal:        21 inches\n    Max Resolution:  1280x1664\n    Frequencies:     48-108Khz horizontal, 60-80Hz vertical\n    Dimensions:      19x15x17 inches\n    Price:           $2500\n    Compatible with: PC;PS/2;Mac\n\n  M24PMAX :\n    Diagonal:        24 inches\n    Max Resolution:  1280x1664\n    Frequencies:     48-108Khz horizontal, 60-80Hz vertical\n    Dimensions:      22x18x18 inches\n    Price:           $2600\n    Compatible with: PC;PS/2;Mac\n\n\nNanao USA Corp.\n23535 Telo Ave.\nTorrence, CA 90505\n310-325-5202\n\n  FlexScan 6500:\n    Diagonal:        21 inches\n    Max Resolution:  1664x1200\n    Frequencies:     31.5;56-80Khz horizontal, 55-90Hz vertical\n    Dimensions:      18x20x17 inches\n    Price:           $1989\n    Compatible with: PC;PS/2;Mac\n\n\nRan-Ger Technologies, Inc.\n[Address unknown]\n\n  The Genuis Model 1920M:\n    Diagonal:        19 inches\n    Max Resolution:  1280x1024\n    Frequencies:     64Khz horizontal, 60Hz vertical\n    Dimensions:      17x19x17 inches\n    Price:           $950\n    Compatible with: PC\n\n\nSampo Corp. of America\nP.

The problem is: what letter will the CMOS\ngive the new drive? If it's D:, what will happen when Stacker creates\nD: and swap? Can I tell CMOS to make it E:? So that if I Stack it, I\nwill have C, D, E and F?\n    I know this could be an FAQ or in a readme somewhere, but I want\nto hear from somebody who've actually done it. Thanks!\n							     Romy

Are there anyone who wants to sell used 386dx-33 motherboard?\nIf you have one please let me know the price and the specification\n\nI am also interested in buying Trident VGA card  (1Meg)
My PC is a 486-33DX (ISA) with AMI BIOS and OPTI chipset. I am thinking of replacing the AMI BIOS chip (dated 6-91) with an up-to-date one (not for any reason, just messing around). My questions are:\n\n1. Do I just take out the old one and plug in a new?\n\n2. Anything else I have to take care of? What precautions should I take?\n\n3. Where can I get the new BIOS chip, CompUSA, mailorder or what? (I live in Orange County California).\n\n4. What is the most up-to-date version?\n\n5. Very important. How much would it be?\n\nThank you for your help.

Hello, I've been following discussions on 17" monitors in \ncomp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware and noted that the Nanao seems to get very good\nreviews.  I'm interested in getting more information about Nanao's products\nas well as some others that may fit the bill.   \n\nI would like a monitor that can handle high resolutions like 1024x1024 NI.\nI'm envisioning using this monitor on an Amiga 4000 or Amiga 2000 w/a graphics\nboard like the Retina, and/or on a Sun like the SPARCstation LX.  Basically\nI want a high resolution versital monitor.  This monitor need not be large\n(=>17") if it meets the brief requirements as outlined above.  I've been\nvery happy with a 16" on Suns and could probably cope with smaller at home.\n\nI'm interested if anyone has more details on high quality Sony and Hitatchi\nmonitors since they seem to be used on Sun's fairly often and look pretty\ngood (to me at least).  I haven't seem them brought up in c.s.i.p.h very\noften as are Mag and Viewsonic.\n\nOk, stuff I'd like to find out:  How can I get ahold of Nanao?  What are\nthe products in their line?  What are the technical specs?  Esp. what\nscan freq and max resolutions can they handle?  What's list and street\ncost - if avail. from a third party, and where can I get ahold of them? \nSame info for Sony and Hitatchi.\n\nThank you very much!!
Hello,\n\n   I have a Diamond Stealth VRAM card (the older version\nwith the DIP switches on the back).  I have two problems:\n\n1 ) I've lost the manual!!!\n\n2 ) I have it in a machine with a network card, and\n    everything works fine until I run windows, when\n    the network connection dies.\n\n    (In case it's important, the network card is an\n     SMC ArcNet 8-Bit compatable card.  It's I/O\n     address is 02E0 and it's RAM base address is\n     D000.  It's also using IRQ 2)\n\n\n    I believe there is a file on the Diamond Bboard that\nexplains how to sort this out, but with no manual, I don't\nknow the Bboard number.\n\n    If you can, please help me with as many of the following\nas possible:\n\na ) Send me the Diamond BBS number\nb ) E-mail (or post) the DIP switch settings for the card\n    (or fax them to me at (412) 521-8668)\nc ) Tell me what I'm doing wrong, so I can magicly get\n    everything working.\n\n    Any help at all would be much appreciated.\n\n                Thanks in advance,
Interesting.  Would you care to explain to me then, how my SoundBlaster\nPro card and my printer card are sharing IRQ 7 successfully?  I assure\nyou that they are both set to IRQ 7 and that I have no problem.  My\ncomputer is a DTK 286-12 IBM clone.
I have been using both IDE (or MFM) and SCSI drives for years.  I have 2\nIDE and 1 SCSI on one system and the other with 2 IDE, 2 SCSI disk, and \n1 SCSI CDROM.  I currently using ALWAYS IN2000 SCSI card, but I also have\na Future Domain, a Western Digital SCSI card, and I work with an ADAPTIC \nbefore.  As I recall, all these cards can support boot and floppy drive.\nHowever, to use with other controller (IDE, MFM...) the boot drive has to\nbe the IDE (or MFM).  You CAN NOT boot from the SCSI if you have other \ncontroller in the system.  If you guys only have 2 drives (1 IDE, 1 SCSI).\njust set up the IDE in your CMOS setup.  Make sure you can boot from it.\nThen, set up the SCSI controller (IRQ, DMA, etc). Set the SCSI drive to \nID 0.  Just plug and play for all the cards I seen so far.  Only if you \nhave more than 2 drives then you need driver for the third drive and so\non.  If you have more question, email me, I will try to answer it.\nGood Luck!

I don't see this as a problem with the chip-set (a mistake), I see this\nas something that was designed-in intentionally.\n\nSo it would seem that to enhance the design (from 24 to 32-bit EISA DMA)\nwould require an update to the chipset.  An update to the chipset may \nbegat an update to the motherboard board design.\n\nWhat I'm saing is:  The motherboard manufacturer seems to be passing this\noff as a simple fix.  In my mind the fix is a updated chipset from HINT \nalong with a possible motherboard layout update.  This is not simple.\nIf I were you I would be cautious about this.\n\nYou might look into the Advanced Integration Research (AIR) VL/EISA\nmotherboard.  All slots are EISA/ISA capable.  2 (or 3) of the slots are\nVL-bus capable.  The AIR people confirmed this board supports 'real'\n32-bit EISA DMA (I called them).  Pentium/P5 (?) capable.  Less expensive\nthan equivalent AMI or Micronics VL/EISA board.\n\nLook in Computer Shopper (April '93).  The ZENON ads show the AIR mother-\nboard.  A associate bought the AIR board and is pleased with it.  I'm\nattempting to get the local dealer to trade out the HAWK board for the\nAIR board.\n\nModel number of AIR board (with 486-33DX) is B433EI2.

: \n: Hello\n: \n: I have problems combining two IDE hard disks\n: (Seagate ST3283A and Quantum LPS105A). As single hard disk both\n: are working fine, but connecting them together to my \n: controller doesn't work.\n: \n: My questions are:\n: \n: - Has anybody out there ever been succesful using such hard disks\n:   together and if so what jumper settings and BIOS settting did he/she\n:   use?\n: \n: - Is it possible that my controller is the reason for my troubles ?\n:   The only thing I know about it is that it is an \n:   IDE-harddisk-controller. How many harddisks can such a controller\n:   control? In my case only one ?\n: \n: \n: Thanks in advance\n: \n: 	Volker\n: \nIDE drives have jumpers on them to indicate if it is a master or a slave.\nIf it is a master, then a second jumper indicates if a slave is present.\nThese must be set correctly according to each drive's manufacturers spec-\nification.  The CMOS setup is almost positively NOT the problem.  It is\nprobably not the controller - IDE controllers all support exactly two\ndrives maximum.  Check those jumpers.
Most likely reason is that your backup battery is failing - this battery \nmaintains the contents of the CMOS memory when AC power is turned off, and\nif the battery is flakey then the contents of the CMOS will be lost and \nthe checksum will be wrong (along with most other of the CMOS data). Try \nreplacing the battery.\n\nIf, however, your PC doesn't use a battery but a large capacitor to power\nthe CMOS, you should check to see if you can replace the capacitor with a \nmore normal lithium battery. If this isn't possible, make sure you leave\nyour PC on for a half hour or hour each day; this will keep the capacitor \ncharged. I'd opt for the battery change, though.

Build 59 causes 2 exceptions when I exit Windows. In fact, I have had\nthis happen on all builds after 44, which shipped with my Gateway\nsystem.  Am I doing something wrong, or is this problem commonly\noverlooked?
Since there is no BIOS support for ST-506 interface hard disks in an XT,\nthat support must come from a BIOS extension ROM on the (MFM/RLL) hard disk\ncontroller. Usually the controller has a ROM-based low level format\nprogram (a common jump address is C800:0005 ... you can type G=C800:5 from\ndebug to see) and a small table of drive geometries it "knows" about.\nSometimes these are selectable using jumpers on the card, sometimes you\ncan enter them manually in the LLF menu. Failing that, you must use a\nthird-party HD prep program like SpeedStor, Disk Manager, or the like.\n\nIDE drives come formatted already, and since the is controller part of the\ndrive mechanism itself, concerns about geometry are irrelevant. Plug\nit in and go to FDISK.
What are peoples opinions on the above make of hard drives, I seem to have \nfound a really good bargain on a 170meg drive but I thought I'd check if\nanyone had any comments to say on this make?\n\nAlso I'm a bit of a novice with PC's (but an experienced computer user), when\nconnecting and fitting this drive into one of my spare 5 1/4 bays what extras\nwill I need, a cable for starters (I guess :-) , but what about brackets etc...\n\nAlso I think I might have to change some jumpers on the drive and my original\nConnar 211meg one. I'll be attaching the second drive to a seperate IDE socket\non my controler card. What will I need to change ????\n\nYet again many thanks to all that have answered me in the past and to any that\nanswer me in the future :-)
Which would YOU choose, and why?\n\nLike lots of people, I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from\nthe hard drive.  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), and\na standard IDE controller card on my ISA 486-50.\n\nI'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range.\nAnd I'm thinking hard about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).\nI believe I'm getting something like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according\nto NU).\n\nHow would this number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for\nmy ISA PC, and the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the best system I could\nhope for)?\n\nObviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would\nYOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost?\n\nAlong those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I\nwere to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD?\nAnd how much would it cost?\n\nThanks for any comments.

==== BEGIN REPOST ====\n\nIBM, Apple, Motorola Ready to Unwrap PowerPC 601 Processor\n\n\nThe wraps will come off the PowerPC 601 processor this week, as Motorola\nCorp., IBM, and Apple Computer Inc. detail the results of their yearlong\neffort. This first in a series of PowerPC processors will be a 32-bit\nprocessor with a 64-bit memory interface, much like Intel Corp.'s\nPentium, with the capability of performing as many as three instructions\nper clock cycle, according to sources familiar with the chip. Motorola\nis expected to release the chip in volume by year end in two\nconfigurations, running at 50 and 66 MHz with performance of 40 and 50\nSPECint89 marks, respectively, sources said. Floating-point performance\nfor the 3.6-volt processors will be even better, as their SPECfp89\nperformance will be 60 and 80, respectively. The 601, a scaled-down\nversion of the Power 220 chip developed by IBM for its RS/6000\nworkstations, will also include a 32K single buffered cache on the chip\nwith protocols to support Motorola's 64-bit multiprocessor 88110 bus\nbuilt in. The chip, which is being designed initially to support the\nMicro Channel Architecture, is bus independent, so vendors could develop\nPowerPC- based systems using a number of different architectures,\nincluding ISA, EISA, or Sun Microsystems Inc.'s S-bus design, one source\nnoted.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the development effort, Motorola has\nbeen extremely successful in developing the PowerPC as an inexpensive\narchitecture, despite a complex design made up of more than 2.8 million\ntransistors using a 0.6-micron technology. Initial chips are expected to\nbe priced from $300 to $400 -- only slightly higher than Intel Corp.'s\n486 processors -- but could be sold profitably for less than $100, one\nsource said.
I have a 486DX-33 ISA pc-compatible (Insight) with an Infotel internal\n14.4FAX/14.4data modem with QuickLinkII for Windows.  When I first put the\nmodem in, I pulled a phone out of the jack in another room, and ran a phone\nline extension to my surge protector and then my computer.  The modem\nworked fine.  Then I split the line from the jack in the other room, ran\nthe line into my room into the surge protector and up to my computer.  Then\nI got a regular phone and plugged that into the phone jack in the modem.\nNow when I try to use the modem, QuickLinkII says "No dialtone".  The phone\nplugged into the back of the computer works fine.  I tried unplugging the\nphone, but still no dice.  Is it that the phone line was split too many\ntimes?  (I don't understand how this could be a problem, since the phone\nworked fine.)  Please note: none of the software or hardware parameters\nwere changed, only the phone line itself.  Is my new modem faulty?  What\ncan I do?

: Hi!\n: 	\n: Is it possible through either pin configuration or through software\n: programming to change the IP numbers on an ethernet card?\n: 	\n: Thanks in Advance!\n: \n: -- \n: =-Dave   *Tigger!*\n: \n: djohnson@moose.uvm.edu        'Tiggers are wonderful things!'\n: Dave C Johnson\n\nI think you mean the ethernet numbers.  The 8 byte ethernet id is the unique\nElectronic Serial Number (ESN) assigned to each ethernet board in existence.\nThis is a "physical layer" concept.  The IP address is a higher layer protocol.\nThe analogy to telephone service is the IP address is your phone number, while\nthe particular wire pair in the cable on the pole has some (unknown to you or\nI) physical identification scheme (number).\n\nBut to answer your question (assuming you indeed meant the Ethernet number)\nit is not supposed to be possible to change the number.  Of course the\nmanufacturer can always retro-fit a board, but there could hardly be a\nreason to ever do that.\n\nIf your question is actually referring to the IP address, it is most definetly\nchangable.  But it is strictly software.

Hi,\n\nI have the following problem: I have to use a computer for special purposes\nthat doesn't have a monitor and keyboard connected. No monitor isn't a \nprogram - but no keyboard.\nI can't disable the keyboard from BIOS setup (in fact, there is no setup).\nI spoke to someone who said that he had fooled the BIOS with simply\nusing a self-made connector that connects two pins via a resistor.\nPity, pity... I lost contact to the person before getting more detail.\nSo does anyone of you experts can help?\n\nThanks for any hints, even vague ones :-)\n\nThomas
Actually there is an S3-based card on the market that supports\n	multiple adapters in one system. Unfortunately, It is VL-Bus\n	only (They may have an ISA version by now...?) from a company\n	called Metheus. The address and phone number is:\n\n			Metheus Corp\n			OGC Science Park\n			1600 NW Compton Dr.\n			Beaverton, OR  97006-6905\n			(503)-690-1550\n	Be aware, this is a very high-end card, capable of 4MB of VRAM,\n	so it does not come CHEAP. But, I have personally seen TWO of\n	these boards running a dual screen Windows 3.1.

I've got a 386DX-40, 4MB and I'm using Windows 3.1. Sometimes I wondered why \nWindows worked endlessly on my HD when I was doing nothing (execpt having lunch\nor something like that).

: \n: 	I am interrested in the extrodinarily simple concept of the null modem\n: cable. (Actually I have NO idea, so don't count that last statement.)  What I'm\n: asking is what pins does it use (or what are it's specifications?)  I just want\n: to solder one myself instead of buying one.  I don't even know what port is\n: used.\n: \n: Help me please (at ke_kimmell@vax.cns.muskingum.edu)\n: \n: Kevin\n: \n: p.s.  I'm intending to use the cable for PC-to-PC transfers (via Lap-Link or\n: Telix.  Ideas and info gladly accepted.)\n\nI do not have specific knowledge of Lap-Link or Telix, but my recommendation\nfor ANY package is to follow each one's instructions for making the null-\nmodem cable.  The reason is that each one may be different since there isn't\nreally a standard for PC to PC communications.  The following is a tutorial\nI wrote up that will give you an understanding about RS-232 and null modems,\nbut you should still check your software!\n\nI will eplain a couple of details of RS-232.  RS-232 is\na commumications specification for communicating between a computer and a\nmodem.  Actually it can be between any end system and any communications\nhardware.  The terminology used is Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) and DATA\nCommunications Equipment (DCE).  RS-232 spells out the voltage levels, the\nconnector type, the pinouts, and the signal protocols.  The connector is\na "DB-25" but IBM has set an alternative "standard" of DB-9.  The primary\nsignals are Transmit Data (TD), Recieve Data (RD), and Signal Ground (SG).\nThere are other signals that provide control between the DTE and the DCE.\nFor example, the DTE announces that it is powered up and ready to participate\nin communications via the Data Terminal Ready (DTR) signal.  DTR is an\noutput on the DTE and an input on the DCE.  Similarly, the DCE announces that\nit is ready to participate in communications via the Data Set Ready (DSR)\nsignal.  DSR is an input on the DTE and an output on the DCE.  Ok that's\nfive signals; there are only four more of interest.  The Request To Send (RTS)\nsignal is an output from the DTE (and an input to the DCE) that is used\nto ask the DCE permission to send data.  If the DCE agrees, it sends an ok\nvia the Clear To Send (CTS) signal.  (For completeness, the CTS is an input\nto the DTE and an output from the DCE).  The other two signals (of interest)\nare Ring Indicator (RI) and Data Carrier Detect (DCD).  These are both inputs\nto the DTE and outputs from the DCE.  RI is just what you would expect -\na signal to the DTE saying that someone is attempting to establish a connection\nto the DCE.  This is rather specific to the modem / telephone line setup.\nDCD is a way for the DCE to announce that the "connection" has been established\ni.e. the local DCE is talking to some remote DCE.  There - that's it.  Oh\nthere are many other RS-232 signals defined, but they are obsolete.  I have\nexplained the nine signals that are on a PC.  The pinouts are as follows:\n\nName    DB-9     DB-25\n SG       5        7\n TD       3        2\n RD       2        3\nDTR       4       20\nDSR       6        6\nDCD       1        8\nRTS       7        4\nCTS       8        5\n RI       9       22\n\nNow to address your problem at hand.  When you connect a PC to a PC (a DTE\nto a DTE), there is no DCE pair in the middle and therefore the RS-232\nsignal definitions don't work out quite right.  There is no DCE to assert\nthe CTS, DSR, DCD, or RI.  So the common thing to do is to not use these\nsignals at all - and also forget about the DTR and RTS outputs as well.  If\nthis is done you simply make a null modem (a cable) that passes through SG,\nand crosses TD and RD (i.e. pin 2 of one end connects to pin 3 at the other\nend, etc).  The problem with this solution is that a PC that wants to send\ndata has no way of knowing if the other PC is ready.  It would have to just\nsend the data and hope it got through.  Therefore a better null modem would\ninclude the DTR/DSR pair crossed.  A particular point a confusion is in the\nsoftware area.  Just because you run the wires does not mean that the soft-\nware will use them.  If you are using the built-in BIOS to control the\nserial port, then the BIOS dictates what wires you need and how they are to\nbe used.  But if you have a comm. package such as Brooklyn Bridge, or Lap-\nLink or Telix, then those packages dictate the cabling requirements.  The\nonly thing you can guess reliably is the SG, TD, and RD.  The DTR/DSR is also\nfairly common.  There is one more issue that needs to be addressed here.  And\nthat is flow control.  In the RS-232 scenerio, the DCE's are responsible for\nflow control and it is assumed that the DCE couldn't possible over-run the\nDTE.  By this I mean that as long as the DTE has its DTR line asserted, the\nDCE will send data - without requesting permission first.  Note the contrast\nto the other direction of data flow: the DTE must request permission by\nasserting the RTS line and it must wait for the CTS signal before it can\nsend.  And now in the DTE to DTE scenerio, the question is do you need flow\ncontrol?  The answser is usually.  But how?  For non-binary communications,\none common technique is XON - XOFF which is implemented in software - no\nwires are dedicated to flow control; the TD and RD carry the XON and XOFF\ncommands.  This type of flow control can be used in addition to hardware\nflow control, but the problem is that you can't send binary data because\nyour data might include the XON or XOFF codes and cause erroneous conrol\nsignals.  (A work around is to have the software insert and extract "escape"\ncodes, but the hardware flow control is prefered).  The problem with hard-\nware flow control is that there is no standard.  There are lots of ways to\ndo it and I bet they have all been tried.  One cornerstone of all the methods\nis to use the RTS/CTS for one direction.  But beyond that anything is fair\ngame.  Again, you must look to you comm package for cabling requirements.\nBut I bet you'll find that one cable (if wired properly) could work with\nall of the packages as long as they are of the same vintage.  By the way,\nI am familiar with one package that uses RTS/CTS and DTR/DSR for flow control\nthe RTS is request to send and the DTR is ready to recieve, the CTS is the\nclear to send and the DSR is the request to recieve.  This does not mean a\ndiffernt cable - it is just software.  The clincher to all of this cabling\nstuff is that it is common to have the UART directly controlled by the CTS\nsignal which means that the CTS must be present even if you are not support-\ning it in software.  For these cases you will find cables that short the\nRTS to the CTS at the same end (or perhaps the DTR to the CTS).  Other\npossible shorting might be done just because the software expects certain\nsignals that you don't have (or don't feel like providing because it would\nmean additional wires).  Specifically I am talking about the DSR.  Shorting\nthe DTR to the DSR is not a good idea in general but you may find cables like\nthis.  It is a bad idea because it defeats the whole purpose.  One more\n"gotcha" signal is the DCD.  Some software (including the PC BIOS) expects to\nsee the DCD before it will work.  This signal sometimes gets shorted with the\nDTR.  But my favorite null modem has the RTS and CTS shorted at each end, but\nthe RTS is also connected through to the other end and connected to DCD.  And\nof course the DTR/DSR are crossed as are the TD/RD and of course the SG must\npass through.  This null modem works with most software.  The flow control,\nif any, can use the RTS/DCD with the DTR/DSR.  If your comm. package does not\nspecify the cable required for PC to PC connection, then I suggest you use\nthis one.\n\n    TD  ------  RD\n    RD  ------  TD\n    DTR ------ DSR\n    DSR ------ DTR\n    DCD ------ RTS-\\n  /-RTS ------ DCD |\n  \-CTS        CTS-/

Can any body tell me where the most significant bit of the total horizontal\nwidth hides out on the Tseng Labs ET4000 with a 15/16/24 bit dac?\nI am trying to use the 640x480x16M mode under unix (so i cant just call int 10h)I have a program which dumps the contents of the card registers under dos, but I\nam not sure I trust it for the extended registers of the et4000.\nAnyway, the problem is that in this mode, the Horizontal Total Register\n(3d4h index0) is apparently set to 0x27, but 3d4h index 1 (the displayed clocks)\nis set to 0xEF, so 0x27 is nonsense. A resonable value would be 0x0127 - so is\nthere a high bit, and if so, where is it?\nAlso, how does one set the video dot clock to the appropriate frequency ( and\nwhat would be an appropriate frequency?).

I have both!\n\nI have IDE only on my DROS box and IDE and SCSI on my Unix box.\n\nIDE on the DROS box 'cos it only has a hard disk, SCSI on my Unix box 'cos it\nhas a SCSI hard disk, CD-ROM and tape.\n\nI bought SCSI as it makes adding many devices easier. For the price of one\nirq and dma I have three different types of device connected up.\n\nFaster drives are also available for SCSI - I have a DEC DSP3085s that realy\ndoes have a 9ms average seek time. I.E it finds data 25% faster than my 12ms\nToshiba drive.\n\n\nI don't think that SCSI will increase your data transfer much on an ISA bus :-(\n\n\n890KB/s is pretty good...\n\n\nMany state of the art SCSI disks use the *SAME* mechanicals as many state of the\nart IDE drives. Only the interface electronis differ - look at the 520MB Fijitsu\ndrive for an example!\n\n\nI use an Adaptec 1542B on my Unix box and no-name IDE cards on both.\n\n\nCaching controller! Why? What does it give you that smartdrive ( for DOS ) does \nnot? About 30KB extra lower memory! That's about it.\n\nA properly configured main memory cache will produce better results than a caching\ncontroller! My Unix reads reads data from its main memory cache at 8.5MB/s! That's\nfaster than the standards ISA bus can ever sustain!\n\n\n\nGuy
No.  The simple $25 style IDE controller does not use DMA.  The CPU performs\nthe data transfer with a string move instruction.  This requires that the\nCPU stop what it had been doing and transfer the data.  Only the smart drive\ncontrollers, be they IDE or SCSI, can transfer via DMA.  These controllers\ntend to cost the same wether they are IDE or SCSI.  To get the DMA benefits,\nIDE must sacrifice it's price advantage *on the controller*.\n\n\n\nFloppies aren't on the IDE bus, your arguement makes no sense, this isn't\nan IDE issue.  The floppys have their own processor on their controller\nboard which handles all of these commands.\n\nThe difference between IDE and SCSI is that all SCSI peripherials are\nintelligent.  They each have their own controller.  They depend on the\nCPU to do fewer things for them, i.e. IDE drives needing a processor\nto transfer their data.\n\n\n\n\nThe dettach/callback mechanism alows the CPU to make requests of the \ndevices on the SCSI bus and then dettach and go about its business.\nLater, when the device is done, it issues a callback to say that the\ndata has arrived or the function has completed.  Most SCSI cards will\nalso DMA the data into memory without the interupting the CPU, therefore\nallowing it to continue working uninterupted.  IDE supports no such concept\nas dettach/callback.  \n\nCan you see how this would be a win in any multitasking system?\n\n--David Willmore\n\n-- \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nwillmore@iastate.edu | "Death before dishonor" | "Better dead than greek" | \nDavid Willmore  | "Ever noticed how much they look like orchids?

Serial cables:\n\nThere are only three output signals: TD, DTR, and RTS.\nThere are five inputs signals: RD, DSR, DCD, CTS, and RI.\n\nThere are many differnt null modem requiremts as dictated by the software.\nThe IBM BIOS requires asserts DTR and RTS and then waits for both DSR and\nCTS before sending.  When a BIOS recieve call is made, it asserts DTR and\nwaits for DSR to become true (times out after a while and returns with an\nerror if DSR never becomes true).  It requires CTS to be true for sending\nAND recieving.  Most communications packages bypass this and replace it\nwith their own protocol.  The key is that each comm. package could very\nwell have different requirements.\n\nMy favorite cable works in many cases: short RTS to CTS at each end, but\nalso run RTS through to DCD at the opposite end.  TD runs through to RD\nand DTR runs through to DSR from both DTE's and of course SG goes through\nto SG.\n\nI have never had trouble with this null modem even though I have used it\nwith a comm. package that was expecting RTS to go to CTS instead of DCD.\nThe advantage of this cable is that it also works with the IBM BIOS.

The IRQ and interface-select jumpers are pretty straightforward, but I\n    don't grok the settings of W10-W18 (also labelled A15 through A18).\n    Could somebody tell me which settings of these four jumpers correspond\n    to what I/O addresses?\n    \nThe U-B PCNIC (also OEMed by IBM for a while) is the only Ethernet card I\nknow of that doesn't use I/O addresses.  It only has interrupts and shared\nmemory.  The jumpers you see control bits 15-18 in the base address of the\nshared memory.  I can't recall which is 1 and which 0, but that's easy\nto determine with DEBUG.
Hello All!\n\nI recently acquired a CD-ROM drive, a Mitsumi (mfg. Feb/93)   [Hey, it\nwas free :-)   ]    I'm quite pleased with the performance, but it seems\nto crash a lot when I use PLAYCD.EXE that came with it a DESQview 2.31 -\nThoughts?  This mainly happens when my BBS is running in the background and\nI load the program up.. If I load the program, it doesn't crash, and I start\nthe disk, stop the program and start the BBS its OK, but otherwise I have\nbig problems.. (IE, they can only be solved with a cold boot).\n\nIf -anybody- can mail me to help me, I would be eternally grateful \n(unfortunately, my feed to this group is a little unreliable so I would appreciate\n if you could mail, but by all means, post it too because I'm sure somebody else \n would like to know...)\n\nCheers,\nWes
I am servicing a machine (HP-286) and whenever the thing starts up I get\n4 beeps on powerup.  Does anyone know what error message that signifies?  I \ndon't seem to have any problem with the machine but the lady who is using it\nis "very concerned" about it.  \n\nDon't you just love HP computers???\n\nPreferr responses by E-mail but I read the net so you can post it here.
1) It fixes some problems with MicroProse games.  After leaving F-15 III it\nwould, in vain, try to find a floppy in drive A:.  This has been fixed.  I\ndon't know what other corrections were made.\n\n2) It comes with an image of the original, in case things don't work.\n\n3) Download glb05.exe.  Format a bootable floppy disk, and don't put a\nconfig.sys or autoexec.bat.  Run the self extracting archive so all the files\nexplode to the disk.  Run the file fsh.exe.  It should be self-explanatory from\nthere.\n\nDan\n\nP.S.:  I was feeling extraordinarily generous once again, so I uploaded the\nfile to ftp.cica.indiana too..
I have a 486 DX 33 motherboard in my pc that i'd like to speed up. \nI'd rather not replace the whole motherboard, instead i'd like to know\nif i can use a DX/2 66Mhz cpu. The BIOS is late model AMI, circa 1991,\nand the system crystal is approx 66.3Mhz. \n\nMy question is, can i just replace the original 33MHz cpu with the new\nDX/2 cpu? If its possible, will there be a need for extra cooling\ndevices such as heatsinks and / or muffin fans??
Build 59 still has a number of problems--sheared fonts, for \n	instance, if you have Crystal Fonts enabled.  Some other problems--	\n	"color darkening" and some others.  I don't use the drivers in \n	any mode other than 1024x768x256, so if there are bugs in the\n	other modes I can't say.\n\n\n\n\n	To be honest, up until now, I have only found one bug in the \n	Diamond Viper drivers, and it seems innocuous.\n\n	That is, under Microsoft Word, select Format Border, click\n	shading and take a look at the patterns.  The 5% pattern\n	has been swapped with the 90%, and so on.  The whole list\n	is _completely_ reversed--looks right onscreen, but take\n	it to another machine (i.e., a GUP or ss24x machine) or\n	print it and iy shows--badly!  \n\n	Keep in mind that I use mainly 1024x768x65k mode, so I can't\n	speak for the others, but otherwise these drivers seem pretty \n	solid.\n\n-- \n	"What's big, noisy and has an IQ of 8?"

[discussing the use of IRQ 7]\n\n\n\nTo put it a little differently:\n\n - IRQ 7 is the de facto standard interrupt assigned to be used by the\n   printer adapter to announce its completion of some activity.\n\n - DOS doesn't monitor IRQ 7; it uses other means to determine when it's\n   time to send out another byte to the printer.\n\n - Most (all?) (hardware) printer adapters have the ability to disable\n   the use of IRQ 7, usually by merely breaking the connection between\n   the ISA pin and the associated driver.  Other adapters control the\n   IRQ line by a tri-state driver, and by programming just leave it\n   in the high-impedence mode.\n\n - Unfortunately, there are a lot of adapter cards which use bistate\n   drivers (i.e., either assert high or assert low) for the IRQ lines\n   rather than tristate drivers (assert high, assert low, or don't\n   assert anything).  The presence of such a card on an IRQ line precludes\n   the use of that IRQ by any other adapter unless it is physically \n   disconnected by a jumper.\n\n   (Incidentally, note that there's no requirement that a card hold\n   the IRQ line low when no interrupt is desired.  If that were true\n   you would have to somehow tie down all unconnected IRQ lines, and\n   that certainly isn't a requirement.)\n\n - Non-DOS operating systems (OS/2, NT (?), various Unices or whatever the\n   proper plural of Unix might be) require the use of IRQ 7 for performance\n   reasons.  \n\nAnd the SB16, alas, is one of the cards which uses bistate drivers.
I have an 8-bit serial card with two ports.  Each port has the option of\nusing IRQ 2,3,4 or 5.  I also have two serial ports on a multi-I/O card,\nand the ports can be set to IRQ 3,4,5,7 or 9.  From other posts I've read,\nI get the impression that IRQ2 on the 8-bit card is the same as IRQ9 on\nthe multi-I/O card.  Am I right?
The VL-IDE Adapter can be much faster then the normal IDE, it depends on the\ndrive you use and the board you use. I am using a NoName VL-IDE I/O Contr.\nit is tested under coretest with 2.000 kb/s using a cheap Seagate 3196 and nearly\n4000 kb/s using a WD-Caviar 2340, you have figure out the jumper setting on the\ncontroller to get reliable diskaccess, fastest setting gets 4600 kb/s under Coretest\nbut does not work reliable. You have to shadow the adapter BIOS to get the fast\nspeed. I haven´t used a VL-IDE-Cache controller yet, but it might speed up twice.\n\n						dieter
It seems that there are a lot of questions regarding the Cyrix 386 compatible\n486DLC and 486DRU2.  My info comes directly from Cyrix's Fast Fax service:\nAnd also from installing one of these chips in an IBM Model 80.\n\nThe 486DLC is a 486 instruction set compatible CPU which fits into a 386DX\nsocket (Pin Grid Array, or PGA).  The DLC currently is available in 3 speeds.\nthe 25, the 33, and the 40.  They do not have a coprocessor on board, but any\nsoftware query will return coproc as present.  I guess they emulate the\ncoproc instructions.  Math functions are on the 386DX level without the\nactual coprocessor.\n\nThe internal cache on the 486DLC is 1K.  Cyrix literature claims a 85% hit\nrate.  My informal tests show that the cache accounts for a 10% performance\nboost when it is enabled by software.  Overall performance boost from a\n386DX-25 to a 486DLC-25 is about 60%.  The benchmarks I used were NU SI and\nQAPlus Dhrystones and Whetstones.  The performance, with the cache enabled,\nis about on a par with my 386DX-40 with 256K external CPU cache, which is\naround the performance for a 486SX-25.  The computer runs noticebly faster,\nand DOS 6 with Dblspace is not complaining.  The company claims OS/2\ncompatibility, but I didn't test it.\n\nThe 486DRU2 is not a chip, as commonly thought.  The 486DRU2 is actually\na small daughterboard slightly larger than the 386DX, which contains\nthe logic to manage the clock doubler.  This board plugs into the 386DX\nPGA, and the 486DLC-33 or 40 plugs into this board.  I guess the board\ndoubles the frequency apparent to the CPU, and insert wait states when \naccess to the rest of the system is required.  There are no info available\nfrom Cyrix there.  Anyway, the DRU2 is available for 386DX-16, and 386DX-20\nonly.  Double these clock rates, and you get the 32MHZ and the 40MHZ DLCs.\nIf Cyrix is planning to do the same thing for the DRU2-50, then they need\nto put out the 50MHz DLC2 first...\n\nI also tested a DLC33 motherboard, along with a Cyrix Coprocessor.  With 64K\nexternal cache, performance were about 30% faster than the 25, but still\nsignificantly (25%?) slower than an actual Intel 486DX.\n\nIMHO, the DLC is a great, low price upgrade for people who can't afford, or\ncan't install, a new motherboard.  It is definitely worth what I paid for it,\nbut if you need 486DX-33 performance, the DLC33 won't cut it.  I'm not sure\nabout the DLC-40, but I think even if it matches the performance, it won't\nbeat it in any significant way.\n\nThe last time I posted info about the DLC, people sent quite a bit of mail,\nasking where I got it.  So here is where I got mine:\n\nTreasure Chest peripherals, they advertise in the Computer Shopper.\n1-800-677-9781\nThe 486DLC-25 kit was $179.00\n\nBut....\n\nI liked the chip so much that I found the supplier, and became a dealer.\nIf you are interested in the chip, e-mail me, and I can fax or mail you\nmore info.   I'm well aware of the net's policy against commercial use,\nSo I can;t post anymore info here.  However, if there are more questions\nregarding the 486DLC itself, I'll post what I can.\n\njamesc\n909-396-0408
BusLogic just announced the BT445 FAST SCSI-2 VLB Interface as of\nApril 20.  This always happens to me!\n\nI have a one week old BT545S which is the ISA version.

yes\n\n\nyes, seen glue-on, tape-on, clip-on, one-inch square and larger.\nmy favorite is the 3.5 inch plastic U.S.Toyo fan I use just plopped\ndown on top of the chip during open-case service.\n\n\ndepends on the mounting\n\n\nonly if the manufacturer was smart\n\n\nonly if it goes out - got that "blanket" effect which doesn't help chip life\n\n\nlonger system life makes good economic sense to me\n\n\nyes - well, not the melted cheese\n\n\nlets you touch the surface - the "rule of thumb" for cooling solid-state\n\n\nthe "attached" fans look slick and work well but I'm bothered by the potential\nloss of cooling if the fan goes out. at least with the power supply fan you\ncan reach back there every few days and feel the fan blowing.\n\nI prefer to put a stock fan off the drive brackets or front panel\nto blow air across the cpu - depends a lot on case and board layout, though.\n\non-chip fans from Fry's Electronics in the SF Bay Area are about 30.00. I\nget the stock power supply fans for about 11.00.
Don't even get hyped up.  They are still accepting submissions from the\nmembers for various proposals of how to implement the standard.\n\nYou don't seem to realize that while v32bis was just an extension of\nv32 (which took years to pass, implement, and finally sell at a reasonable\nprice), v.fast requires all new technology (not just faster DSP chips, etc.)\nto achieve its performance.\n\nWait until next spring for the final ratification and modems coming shortly\nafter that.
All,\n\nDuring my attempts to find out how the AT harddisk controller\nworks I stumbled across I/O port 376h.

I have uploaded the most recent Windows drivers for the Cirrus GD5426 \nchip based display cards to the uploads directory at ftp.cica.indiana.edu\n (file is 5426dr13.zip). They're very recent, I downloaded them from the \nCirrus BBS (570-226-2365) last night. If you are unable to get them there, \nemail me and maybe I can upload them to some other sites as well.  \nI have a local bus based card (VL24 Bitblaster from Micron) but I think \nthe drivers work with ISA cards (or at least includes drivers for them).\n\nI found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 1.2 version, \nimproving my graphic winmarks (v3.11) by about 2 million (7.77 to 9.88) \nalthough this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on \nCirrus's part but I don't think so.\n\nFrom Steve Gibson's (columnist for Info World) graphic card comparisons \n(also found at the cica ftp site under the name winadv.zip) I extracted the \nfollowing for the sake of comparison:\n\n							Wintach\n             		Winbn3.11	Word	Sprsht	Cad	Paint	Overall\nSteve's system:\n486/33 VLB:\nATI Graphics Ultra Pro	  9.33		10.34	 20.78	8.28	14.90	 13.58\n\nmy system -\n486sx/33 VLB:\nVL24 Bitblaster		  9.88		 8.65	 11.71	18.84	15.40	 13.65\n\n\nIts no Viper, but I think its a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of \nthe ATI card and when compared to the other cards included in Gibson's review.\n\nMicron system owner's, I would be interested to hear your opinions on the \nDTC 2270VL local bus disk controller. My system came with a Maxtor 7120 \ndrive (120 MB) and at first was only giving me disk winmarks of about 16 Kb/s, \nI am now at 22 Kb/s. Is this about as good as it gets? I can't get a Norton's\nsysinfo disk reading because the contoller intercepts the calls, at \nleast that was what the program said.

{deletions}\nYes, this is a valid concern IMHO.  With the directly attached fan units I've\nseen, it looks like if the fan were to stop the chip cooling would be \na good bit worse than no heat sink at all.  In other words, if the fan stops\nthe unit turns into an insulator and the chip might get hot enough to\nsuffer permanent damage, not just stop working temporarily.\n\nMy Zeos 486DX2/66 (tower case) has a passive heat sink on the cpu, and it's\nlocated so the front fan, which sucks air into the case, blows right on the\nheat sink.  If that fan stops the heat sink is still cooled by convection air\nflow so should not see too dramatic a temperature rise.  Essentially the \narrangement you're talking about and a good idea IMHO.

You unfortunately failed to mention if the error occurs with the Parity Error\nChecking enabled or disabled.  I assume you mean it gives you a parity error\nwhen it's enabled, and not when it's disabled.  How high will the count go on\nthe memory check at boot-up before this error occurs?  Does the system beep\nat all; if so what's the pattern of beeps?  The error could be occuring in\nCache memory (not so likely) or video memory, as well as the simms.\n\nThe fact that you have AMI bios is not conclusive in determining the board\nmanufacturer either.  Boards are made by thousands of small Taiwanese companies\n(among others) that buy the name brand chips and put them together with some\nsimm sockets to make your board.  I tend to doubt your problem is with your\nIDE controller, also.\n\nAnyway, perhaps if you answer those questions someone can help you out better.

The price is about the same, \nbut the Gateway has significantly better performance (200MB vs. 120MB \nhard drive, 50Mhz 486DX2 vs.  25Mhz 486SL) and much cheaper accessories \n(extra batteries, modem...)\n\nThe concern I have about Gateway is the durability and reliability.\nDoes anyone out there have any experience with the Gateway Nomad?\n\nThanks,
This is pure bull.  I've had the 24 bit mode (640x480 and 800x600)\n	working since the version before 59 (??55??).  Bld 59 added \n	the 24 bit option to Flexpanel.  Try getting the drivers from \n	ftp.cica.indiana.edu or wuarchive.\nMine is:\nGateway 486 DX2/50 LB\n8 Megs ram\nIDE HD\nATI GUP w/ 2MB (installed upgrade myself)\nBLD 59 drivers.
The fan in my power supply, like most, is distractingly LOUD. Has anyone found \na solution to running a pc with peace and quiet? Short of buying a notebook \nPC, I don't know what to do. Oh yeah, I did hear about a power supply called a \n"Silencer" - which is supposed to be more quiet. Has anyone had experience with\nthis? I was quoted a price of $225 (!) for a 270Watt Silencer.\n\nI've even considered stuffing my PC case in one of those acoustic "printer \nenclosures", but that wouldn't be the most elegant solution. Also, I'm \nguessing that would also cut the ventilation.\n\nAny other ideas?\n\nThanks in advance for ANY suggestions! Please E-mail whatever you post...
Hi,\n\n  I have bought a new harddisk and want to use it with my old\n  TEAC SD3105 , 100Mb harddisk. Unfortunataly I do not have any \n  documentation with this harddisk.

I am thinking about buying a new motherboard and a cyrix 486dlc 40 or 33 Mh\nz.  It will be an upgrade from a 386sx 25.  I was wondering if anybody has any\nFACTS they can fill me in on.  If anybody has one what do you think about it?\nI will also get a cyrix math co with it.  I have benchmarks for the two chips a\nnd they look very good for the price.  If anybody responds please send me email\n because I usually don't check the mail very often but I check my reader daily.\n    Thanks for your info, and remember only respond if you have legitimate comp\nlaints or praise, not just to Cyrix/AMD bash.  I know about what Byte, computer\n shopper, pc computing and etc... have said and that is why I am considering\nthe Cyrix chip.  Thanks.........
I ran into this about six months ago.  My system is a GW2000 486DX/66V,\n8 megs RAM, 1Meg ATI GUP VLB. It seems the problem is that the ATI\nGraphics Ultra Pro card consumes the COM4 port for some reason, so only\nCOM1-3 are available.  I believe this is documented somewhere in the\nsystem manuals, but I can't recall where.
Due to the large amount of request for 3dbench of ET4000/W32,\nI finally can get a 3dbench v1.0 from a ftp site.\n\nThe 3dbench of ET4000/W32 in my Cardex W32 card with 1MB DRAM\nhas superscape benchmark of 26.3 frames/sec.\n\nHope it will satisfy people curiosity of this ET4000/W32 performance.\nWhat other benchmark program result you would want to know? 8-)

I posted almost the same bad experience with  Midwest Micro but our\n%^*^&*^&* news program only sent one paragraph out of the middle. In\naddition to the facts that:\n(a) the modems (I had ordered two) wouldn't work as documented\nand\n(b) the tech person had NO CLUE as to how it should work,\nit also turned out that:\n(c) one of the two modems they sent was clearly USED but the techs\nthought that was standard practice and\n(d) the modems made all three of my floppy drives quit working and\nmy CMS250 tape drive start running away.\n\nThat they are incompetent is one thing, but that they sell used stuff\nas new and won't even apologize for it is another. Stay away from\nthese crooks!
The 50 MHz external bus speed provides a hell for cache designs. Most\nof the DX-50 boards have too slow caches that make them effectively\nDX2-50:s. Also as someone else pointed out, local bus boards are\nbetter off at 33 MHz bus speed. The 8k internal cache allows the\nDX2-66 to be generally faster anyway.
...\n\nThis is a common misconception, shared my many manufacturers, programmers,\nand users alike.  COM3, for example, is simply the third equipped COMM\nport, not necessarily the one with I/O address 3E8.  The BIOS just\nsearches sequentially through a set of potential COMM port addresses.  The\nfirst equipped port it finds will become COM1, etc.  If you're playing by\nthe rules, you can't have a COM4 unless you have a COM3 equipped.  The set\nof "standard" (whatever that means) port addresses merely reflects the\norder in which the BIOS searches the I/O address space in its search for\nserial ports.\n\nSo, what you have is indeed COM3 at the non-standard address 2E8.  Were\nthis address in the 4th table slot instead, programs which query the BIOS\nto determine the number of installed COMM ports would not find it, as the\nfield in the BIOS data area which contains this number would indicate that\nthere are but 3 COMM ports installed.  (Frankly, I don't know of a simgle\nprogram that would actually have a problem with this.)
Well, I tried this method based on responses from several people.  Either\nI am a klutz(probable) or they have changed the connector.  I ended up having\nto destroy the connector, put heat shrink tubing on the individual pins and \nthen plug them into the SB connector in the correct order.  It works great \nthis way so this turned out just fine.  It certainly sounded easy based on\nother people's experiences but my attempts did not go too well...\n\nJohn\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<clip clip>\n\n\nRunning MS-DOS or a derivative OS, obviously. Please take note that the\nfollowing is not what exactly happens, but a slightly simplified\nexplanation.\n\nTechnically, the IRQ line is only a means for the device (printer\nadapter, SoundBlaster, modem, hard disk, ...) to signal the CPU that\n"Something's happening here, please take note." How the CPU is\nprogrammed to handle this signal is usually up to the operating system.\nIn MS-DOS, the "interrupt vector" is used to store the address of the\nfunction that handles each interrupt.\n\nNow, basic DOS doesn't care whether the printer reports that it's ready\nto print some more stuff or not - it simply ignores the interrupt.  When\nDOS prints, it looks at the LPT buffer.  If there's a character there,\nwait a while and check again.  If there's not, copy a new character to\nthe LPT port.  Since the IRQ 7 is ignored as a printer interrupt, it's\nfree for use for any other adapters - in this case, the SB. \n\nWith any multitasking or otherwise advanced OS, this kind of printing\napproach just doesn't work (or more precisely, it wastes a lot of CPU\ncycles.) Hence, you can't "share" the IRQ 7 with LPT1 and SB if you're\nrunning Unix or OS/2 or whatnot.\n\nAnother issue with the SB is that only the digitized sound uses\ninterrupts. When the SB plays plain music, the CPU simply tells it what\nto play until told otherwise. With digitized sound the interrupt is\nrequired to notify the CPU when the output ends and new data is\nneeded.\n\nYou can, however, hook two (or more) COM ports to one interrupt, but use\nthem only one at a time.  This is because the interrupt handling routine\nis same for both ports, and it can see from which port the data came\nfrom. This, of course, applies for some other devices (like LPT) as well.\n\nRemember, this was greatly simplified in parts, but I think gives the\ngeneral picture correctly enough.\n\nCheers,
Hi:\n\nI need some advice (opinions?) regarding which PC would best suit my needs!\nI want to use this (proposed) beast for basically four things:  \n\n     -	Editing documents using WordPerfect 5.1 (under dos)\n\n     -	Creating graphs/analyzing data using Sigmaplot V5.0 (under dos)\n\n     -	Editing/playing with images using Aldus PhotoStyler, running under \n	Windows 3.1 - these images can be large, say 2k x 2k, 24bits/pixel\n\n     -	Using the PC as an Xterminal, running DesqView/X 1.1 and Sun PC-NFS, \n	talking to our network of Sparcstation's - this is where a lot of\n	the images/data come from, and is the most demanding of these tasks.\n\nI've read, read, read PC magazines, performed benchmarks, read this newsgroup,\nand decided that a "nice" system (price/performance) would be:\n\n	486DX-50 256k cache, ISA, VLB, 16meg ram\n	ATI Graphics Ultra Pro, 2 meg ram, local bus\n	15" monitor, 1280x1024 NI\n	3Com Etherlink III 16bit\n	Maxtor 240MB IDE hard drive\n\nHowever, the parts don't fit!  Our local retailer apparently put one of these\ntogether, only to discover that the ATI card wouldn't run at 50MHz - surprise\nsurprise.  Actually, after reading this group, I'm surprised that they even\nhave a 50MHz local bus running...\n\nI have a choice now between basically the above system but with a\n486DX2-66 with ISA and VLB,  or,   a 486DX-50 with EISA and no VLB (and thus\nthe non-local bus version of the ATI card).  Which is better, keeping in mind\nthat I'm primarily interested in the last two tasks?  \n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!  (I need to decide quickly, so any \nspeedy help would be appreciated even more!!)\n\n\n\nBTW: We have a system now to perform these tasks, it has the following \nconfiguration:\n\n	486DX-33 64k cache, ISA, 8 meg ram\n	ATI Graphics Ultra+, 2 meg ram\n	14" monitor, 1024x768 NI\n	SMC Ethercard 8 bit\n	Maxtor 120MB IDE hard drive\n\nWe're quite happy with the ATI card - very fast, ONCE the data gets to it!!\n~Slow~ repainting images under PhotoStyler that have moved off screen, or\nbeen uncovered!  \n\nThere doesn't seem to be enough raw cpu when running DesqView/X!  Its sluggish\nrunning the local window manager.  Also, many functions under PhotoStyler take\na long time (even when the images fit entirely in ram).\n\nThere's not enough memory in the system - DesqView/X and a 1 meg SmartDrive\ndon't leave much room for other apps.  Photostyler will page to disk with\nmedium size images.\n\nI have performed a number of benchmarks on the ethernet transfer rates.  This\nmachine sustains only 120k/sec over ethernet while our Sparcs sustain 600k/sec \non the same network.  Going to the 16 bit version of the SMC card increases\ntransfer rates to 160k/sec - still very slow (especially when moving large \nimages).  Is there such a thing as a local-bus ethernet card coming??  Will it\nmake a difference?  I'm hoping so, and leaning towards the 486DX2-66 choice \n(above), for that reason.\n\nAlso, are there DX2-100's on the horizon?  What about DX3-99's?  DX3-150's ???!\n\nAny information is greatly appreciated.
Has anyone tried this HP LaserJet FAX.\nIt receives faxes and prints them on your HP III.\nAlso, from your word processor, you can print straight to the fax.
I had one and on three different motherboards it didn't work with NT and\nin some cases DOS. I sent mine back, but it is my understanding that\non some systems such as Micronics motherboards it is necessary to\nshut off the internal cache on the 486 to have it work.\n\nI've yet to hear from someone running a 34F on any motherboard with\nNT without shutting off the cache.\n\nIf you get one my advise it to be very sure you can return it first.
I've noticed a recent proliferation of 1 gig SCSI-2 3.5" drives, in\nparticular, the Fujitsu 2694 and the Micropolis 2112. There is also the\nMaxtor LXT1240s (6100 rpm, 1.2 gig) drive.

As far as I know, there is no way to get around the BIOS password except by \nshorting out the power supply to the CMOS memory, thereby erasing it. This \nwill remove the password, but it will also destroy all the previous BIOS \nsettings, so then you'll have to go and set them all up again. On my 386, \nthere is a jumper on the motherboard which is provided for the purpose of \nshorting the battery. You just short this jumper briefly, and it interrupts \npower to the CMOS long enough to erase it. I would imagine there is \nsomething like this on your board too. \n\nIn the future, I would suggest that YOU set the password, and leave it on \n"Setup" only. That way, no-one else can go and reset it or set it to "\nAlways" unless they know what password you used. They had to do this over \nhere too when they got a bunch of new 386's, for just the same reason.\n\n-Dale
FOR SALE:\n\nAT&T Dataport Internal 14.4K Fax/Modem\n\nThe modem is an internal AT/(E)ISA 8-bit card (just a little longer\nthan a half-card).  It has v.32bis for 14.4Kbps data / 9600 bps fax,\nv.42, v.42bis, and MNP5 for error-correction and data compression, so\nyou can get error-free links up to 57,600 bps on a conventional phone\nline.  They will "fall back" to any speed (down to 1200bps) and even\ndisable compression and error-correction if necessary in order to\nconnect with slower and older modems.\n\nIt has a 16550 buffered UART for better compatibility with\nmulti-tasking operating systems (Windows, OS/2, Unix, etc).\n\nThey use a patented technology called Optical Line Interface (OLI)\nwhich reduces noise generated by the modem to assure the fastest and\ncleanest connection possible.\n\nThese modems come with a lifetime warranty and free lifetime tech\nsupport (and the call is free, too) from AT&T.\n\nThey also include the lovely and talented QuickLink II for DOS and the\nNEW QuickLink II for Windows communications and fax software which\nwill let you conveniently sent faxes from any DOS or Windows\napplication just by printing.  The Windows version will send faxes of\nany font and can include graphics, etc.  The DOS version can fax\ngraphics and a limited set of fonts (I believe that there are 5 or so,\nas well as any HP Laser II resident fonts).\n\nI'm asking $210.00 for this modem (plus Utah tax).  This is at or\nbelow the prices of any other (reputable) manufacturer of an\nequivalent modem (including Zoom, US Robotics, etc).  And, it is\nbacked by a company that will never go away.\n\nThis price will include delivery if you live within 20 miles of\ndowntown SLC.  I can also arrange shipping, or you can stop by my home\nto pick it up.  (If you're concerned about installing an internal\nmodem, let me know and we can discuss an arrangement for including\ninstallation.)\n\nIf you're interested, please let me know.  This is an excellent modem\nat an excellent price (they normally list for ~$500 and retail for\nabout ~$300).  I installed one of these last week and it is very nice.\n\nIf you have questions about this, AT&T has an info number at \n(800) 554-4996, or you can email me and I will attemp to answer them.\n\nThe modem will go to the highest bidder I get within the next week.

Organization: Compact Solutions, Canberra ACT Australia\n\nI have a floppy drive which has developed "General failure" errors. (It's a Teac 1.44Mb 3.5" drive).\n\nI took it out of the machine and noticed it was very dusty. I used a high powered air can to blow all this dust out and it's quite clean now.\n\nHowever, it didn't help the problem.  I've also identified that when the machine boots (and the drive seeks for a boot disk), the head movement during this process is now approximately half the length of the original time.  What I mean is the period when the drive light comes on and the heads move from their retracted position out to the track containing the boot sector.\n\nIs there anything more I can do to try and save this drive?

Think!\n\nIt's the SCSI card doing the DMA transfers NOT the disks...\n\nThe SCSI card can do DMA transfers containing data from any of the SCSI devices\nit is attached when it wants to.\n\nAn important feature of SCSI is the ability to detach a device. This frees the\nSCSI bus for other devices. This is typically used in a multi-tasking OS to\nstart transfers on several devices. While each device is seeking the data the\nbus is free for other commands and data transfers. When the devices are\nready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data.\n\nOn an IDE bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seeked\nthe data and transfered it. This is typically a 10-20ms second lock out for other\nprocesses wanting the bus irrespective of transfer time.
hello,\n\nfor 2 months I've unsuccessfully attempted to get either\na 3rd or 4th serial port working on my system.\n\nvarious systems diagnostics (e.g., MSD, Norton) tell me\nit's there, but anything I hook up to it can't use it\n\nI have two serial ports on the motherboard\n\nif I set my internal FAX/modem for com4 the utility\nprograms report a COM3\n\nI've checked to make sure all the IRQs and addresses are\ncorrectly (as listed in most manuals) set\n\nam I missing something very basic?\n\nwhere should I go from here?\n\nany help, even a point in the right direction, would be\nmost appreciated.
I have a Headland Technologies Video Seven VRAMII board that only\ncame with 512K, at the time this was ok but...\n\nI need info or help with upgrading this board to 1 Mbyte.  There are\n2 rows of pins over the VRAM chips, I think for a piggyback board\nof VRAM.  I would like to hear from anyone that may be able to help\nme upgrade this board.  Maybe someone from Headland who maybe read-\ning this has one of these piggyback boards just laying around, please\nplease please!\n\nDoes anyone know of where I could maybe buy the upgrade for this?  I\nwould sure love to use this in 800X600-256 color mode but for the time\nbeing, I can only get 3/4 of the screen with the bottom part a white\nstrip, obviously because of the missing VRAM, actually I'm surprised\nit even works to this degree at all!
Give the new Viewsonic 17 a good look.  I have seen it side by side with\nan old Viewsonic 7, a MAG 17, a Nanao 17" (not the Trinitron one), and\na Sony OEM 17" (which does have a Trinitron tube).  The new Viewsonic\nbeat all of them easily in terms of picture quality, and I think it is\nfar superior to the 16" Sun that I am staring at now.  The place asks\n$1178 for it; I would have bought it if I had not just bought a 15"\nNanao F340iw a week earlier :(
I currently have a AD-lib card, it can play .mid files in windows\nbut it cannot play the startup .wav files.. \ni called microsoft... no help.\ni cannot call ad-lib since they went belly up.\n\ndoes anyone know if there are special drivers that i need for this?\nif so, where are they?\n\nThanx in ad-libvance!! :-)
I have a DFI Handy Scanner Model HS-3000Plus and a little bit of\nsoftware running under dos to use it. I'd like to make more extensive\nuse of this device (in particular, write a driver for it on unix).\n\nSo, can anyone give me a description of how to talk to this device. It\nconnects to the system via it's own interface card.\n\nAny info would help, it can't be too difficult to talk to :-)
C A L L   F O R   V O T E\n-------------------------\n \nThis is the official Call For a Vote on the creation of 3 newsgroups\nfor those engaged or interested in all areas relating to the\nPUBLISHING OF ANY SORT OF CDROM MATERIAL. Please repost this CFV to any\nnewsgroup, listserver or reflector that you think might have a\ngroup interested in this subject in order to reach as broad an\naudience as possible. Every vote counts, so make sure you register\nyours if you want these groups to be created.\n\n \nProposed Groups\n---------------\ncomp.publish.cdrom.hardware\ncomp.publish.cdrom.software\ncomp.publish.cdrom.multimedia\n \nStatus\n------\nUnmoderated.\n \n\nVoting Period\n-------------\nFrom: The appearance of this posting\nTo:   23:59 EST, 21 May 1993\n\nHow To Vote\n-----------\nAll votes must be emailed to: manaster@yu1.yu.edu\nor sent as a reply to the originator of this CFV (manaster@yu1.yu.edu). \n\n-To vote, simply copy the example below and delete either the "Yes"\nor the "No" before each group to register your vote for or against\nthe creation of that group. A line containing "Yes/No" as in the\nexample below, will be considered an abstention with respect to\nthat particular group. Note that each group will have its own\nseparate vote count and that you may split your vote for the groups\nor abstain as you will. Please provide your Name and E-mail address\nas shown in the example below.\n\n		Email your  vote following this\n		example.....\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: Re: Vote on comp.publish.cdrom.*\n	\nI  vote "Yes/No" for the creation of "comp.publish.cdrom.software"\nI  vote "Yes/No" for the creation of "comp.publish.cdrom.hardware"\nI  vote "Yes/No" for the creation of "comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia"\n\n	[Last Name], [First Name] [(E-mail Address)]\n	.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVoting Rules\n------------\n-Only one vote per user (Two different people cannot vote under the\n same user name).\n-Any votes which are received before or after the voting period\n will be discarded.\n-Anyone who wants to change their previous vote may do so by voting\n again.  They must indicate that they have previously voted and are\n changing their mind in a footnote.  A changed vote will discard your\n previous vote.\n-Email messages sent to the above addresses must constitute unambiguous\n and unconditional votes for/against newsgroup creation as proposed.\n Conditional votes will not be accepted.\n-Only votes emailed to the above addresses will be counted; mailed\n replies to this posting will be discarded.\n-In the event that more than one vote is placed by an individual, only\n the first vote will be counted unless it was changed as above.\n-No information will be supplied as to how people are voting until the\n final acknowledgment is made at the end, at which time the full vote\n will be made public.\n\nAmbiguous Votes\n---------------\nAmbiguous votes -- those who do not follow the specified format, or \ndo not make clear the voter's intent, will, where possible,  be \nreturned to their senders for clarification.  Ambiguous votes which \ncannot be returned to their senders or for which no clarification is \nprovided will be identified in the final vote tally.\n\nEvery Vote Counts........Feel free to Flood my mail!!!\n\n\nRationale\n---------\nThe rationale for this proposal is a need for those interested or\ninvolved in the publishing of cdrom materials to have a forum for\nthe discussion relating to their needs. At the moment the main fora\nfor such discussion are in alt.cd-rom and comp.multimedia neither\nof which have publishing as their focus. Some lists serve the\ngeneral cdrom community with focuses on library, government and\nnetwork usage, and until several weeks ago none were devoted \nto publishing (CDPub has just been setup). In any case a list is not,\nand ought not, be a replacement for regular usenet newsgroups.\n \nThe reason for the division into three groups is a natural\npartition of interest between the hardware and software topics,\nand between the two main focal points of software, i.e. fulltext\nand multimedia publishing. Topics such as CDROM XA, CDI, CD-R, \nPhoto CD and other related formats would be included as well. \nTopics related to cdrom publishing that are neither clearly\nhardware or software related such as books, copyright issues and\nother legal matters, packaging, distribution, could be included in\nthe purvue of comp.publish.cdrom.software, as would any other\nnonhardware or multimedia topic that relates in some way to cdrom\npublishing, in any format, and is appropriate to the Internet.\n \nThe main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.software would be topics such as\nindex and retrieval software, premastering software, cdrom\nsimulation software, hypertext, sgml, scanning and imaging\nsoftware, data capture software, data clean up, compression,\nencryption etc as relates to publishing cdroms.\n \nThe main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia would be software that\naids in the multimedia authoring and publishing process - audio and\nvideo.\n \nThe main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.hardware would be hardware that\nrelates to cdrom publishing, as well as hardware for data capture,\nsuch as all sorts of scanners and data capture hardware, as well as\ninformation that publishers need to know about the hardware that\nthe intended enduser will utilize (the hardware that will\neventually play the published cdrom) including networks for cdrom.\n \nNotes\n-----\nThese groups are not to be used for topics such as reviews or\nquestions relating to already published cdroms or reviews or\nquestions relating to general purpose cdrom drives and the like.\nRequests for help in installing a cdrom drive and other general\ntopics should be directed to other fora. Questions about cdroms\nmounted on LANs should be directed to bit.listserv.cdromlan.\n \nCharter\n-------\n \nProposed Charter -- COMP.PUBLISH.CDROM.SOFTWARE\n \nThe USENET newsgroup, comp.publish.cdrom.software, will be a newsgroup for \ndiscussion of the following example topics, but not limited to them:\n \n	Index and retrieval software\n \n	Authoring software\n \n	Scanning and imaging software\n \n	OCR and OCR cleanup\n \n	Hypertext\n \n	SGML\n \n	Premastering and Simulation (cdrom) software\n \n	Copyright and legal issues related to publishing cdroms\n \n	Other nonhardware topics related to cdrom publishing\n \nProposed Charter -- COMP.PUBLISH.CDROM.HARDWARE\n \nThe USENET newsgroup, comp.publish.cdrom.hardware, will be a newsgroup for \ndiscussion of the following example topics, but not limited to them:\n \n	CD-R equipment\n \n	Data capture hardware\n \n	Scanners\n \n	Video and audio capture hardware\n \n	Networking hardware\n \n	Midi hardware\n \n	Photo CD hardware\n \n	Publishing systems\n \n	CDI and DVI hardware\n \n	Compression and encryption hardware\n \n	Keyboarding\n \n	Other hardware publishing topics\n \nProposed Charter -- COMP.PUBLISH.CDROM.MULTIMEDIA\n \nThe USENET newsgroup, comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia will be a newsgroup for \ndiscussion of the following example topics, but not limited to them:\n \n	Multimedia authoring software\n \n	Imaging software\n \n	Audio and Midi software\n \n	Color control software\n \n	Video editing software\n \n	Audio editing software\n \n	Multimedia utilities useful for publishers\n \n	Integration of text, image, audio and video\n \n	Compression and encryption of multimedia\n \n	Multimedia copyright and related legal issues\n \n	Multimedia databases and hypertext\n \n	Other multimedia publishing topics
My 3.5" floppy drive stopped recognizing low density (720K) floppies.\n\nThe controller and drive works fine in another system. I was told it\ncould be the DMA chip.

I'm using Norton Cache 5.0, which is really nice but horrible incompatible.\nSome games won't work it, my streamer software won't work with it and Windows\ndoesn't like it at all. But when copying or deleting lots of small files, only\nNCACHE is really fast. You see, to write a file the FAT must be changed. But to\nwrite 1000 files the FAT must be changed only once. Is there any cache program\nout there which is smart enough to do the same and good enough to run with all my\napplications? Any help is really appreciated.
I used to have a lot of line noise problems with my 1200 baud modem.\nWhat was sudgested to me was to put a toriod transformer on the line.\nThis is easily done by getting a large toroid core from your local\nelectronics shop, a toroid core is a ceramic/metal "donut", and wind the\ntelephone line in through the center of the core and out around the\nouTside five or six times. This is a easy and cheap fix that does not\nhave the hassels of having to use sofware to fix a hardware problem.
hi,\n  just a quick question reguarding pc tape backup. I own a 386 dos box\nand have an Archive VP402 interface card connected to a QIC-02 tape\ndrive. Now the simple question is, does anybody in netland know were I\ncan get some software for msdos (ver 5.0) to run this setup, freeware\nor shareware preferred .\n\nThanks in advance,\n                   Darryl
Diamond Video cards (stealth, viper, speedstar, etc...) \nmay have excellent specifications, and the windows drivers that\ncome with them might make windows BLINDINGLY fast, BUT:\n\nIf you're considering buying a system, with a view to using\nit to run Unix (Linux, bsd, etc...) or some other special software,\nthere is a good chance that it WILL NOT WORK with the Diamond cards.\nThis is due to Diamond's propriety attitude to it's hardware:\nit's impossible to get free information from them about their chips \n(specifically their dot-clocks) without paying, and signing non-disclosure\nagreements.\n\nThis made it impossible for the Free Software Foundation to provide\nX-Windows compatibility with these cards, as diamond didn't want to \ndivulge programming neccessities.\n\nAs far as I know only Diamond has this propriety on it's info.
Hi peeps,\n\nHere's another of those "any ideas" type queries.\n\nI've been given an oldish Phillips TeleVideo terminal type thingy, without\na keyboard.  But no problem so far.\n\nWhen I dismantled it, I discovered that it is really just a standard\nRGB monitor with built in modem/ROM software etc.\n\nPhillips kindly labelled the circuit board with the RGB inputs, so I\nconnected it up as a monitor and he presto it worked - sort of.\n\nThe problem is that I have no idea where to connect the Sync lines.\nThe display rolls continuously, but does change modes (OK only to\nCGA - but useful for my laptop).\n\nAny of you wonderful people any knowledge of Phillips monitors?\n\nI've tried Phillips in the UK and a very helpful guy told me that\nhe has had several enquiries of this sort, but Phillips Computer\nis now under the auspices of DEC (at least in the UK).  DEC said\nsorry Phillips don't make it any more. What is it anyway?\nA UK support dealer said "Circuit diagrams? Sync?"\n\nSo any ideas.\n\nJohn.

In case anyone was wondering about upgrading their 386 or 486 class machine\nwithout spending a lot of money, I looked into replacing the processor\non those machines and here are the facts (as I understand them).\n\nIf you have a PS/2 Model 70 or Model 80, you can replace the i386 chip with\neither 1) a Cyrix 486DLC chip for $130 which will increase your processing\npower by about 60% for normal fuctions, and not at all for math functions.\nThis chip will only run at your original clock speed, ie. if you have a 16MHz\nmachine the Cyrix 486DLC will run at 16MHz.\nnote: Windows does not use the math functions, so it is a good upgrade if\nyou are running Windows.\nOr, 2) you can get a Kingston 486/NOW platform for $450 with a 25MHz i486SX\non it which will increase your normal processing power by about 100%, if you\nwere running at 25MHz originally. But again it will not increase the speed\nof your math fuctions.  I think that it will continue to run at 25MHz even\nif your original processor runs at a slower speed.\nThere is also 3) the Kingston 486/NOW platform for $750 with a 33MHz i486DX\non it.  This might speed up your math functions as well, but I am not sure.\n\nIf you have a PS/2 Model 70 B21 or other PS/2 machine with either an i486SX\nor a non-clock doubling i486DX (ie. it runs at either 25 or 33MHz) in it,\nthen you can get an Intel Overdrive chip (which is really an i486DX2 chip) and\nreplace your chip with it.  You should get about 95% better preformance for\nboth normal and math functions.  The 25/50 Mhz version of the Overdrive chip\ncosts $450 and the 33/66MHz version costs $700.  The replacement for the\n25MHz 486SX chip is an espeacially good deal as it provides the math\ncoprocessor which the 486SX does not have.  Note that the speed ratings on the\nOverdrive chips are the maximum speed at which they can run.  If you have a\n20MHz 486SX, then the Overdrive chip will run at 20/40MHz, ie. 20MHz externally\nand 40MHz internally.  There is no reason to buy an Overdrive chip which is\nrated at faster then your machine, you will not get faster performance.\n\nYou should be able to buy these chips from any of the microchip merchants that\nadvertise at the back of PC Magazine or PC Week.  You might want to shop\naround as prices do vary.  If you need a name/phone number for a source for\na particular chip, e-mail me, and I will respond with a couple of sources.\n\nLawrence Khoo
HI,\n that might look like a dull request, but I have been following this newgroup\nfor a couple of weeks and It didn't help me make my mind.\n\n  I bought a new 486 machine not long ago after being disconnected from the\npc world for a while (I have been running on an xt 5MHz till last january!!).\nThe machine I bought came equipped with a ATI VGA XL 24 graphic card. It\ngives a very nice picture and the  Windows drivers are pretty stable. The only\nproblem is that it is quite slow.\n\nI would like to go for a faster card (not in the 400$ range). I saw a lot\nof comments on many products over the last weeks, but didn't get an overall\npicture clear enough to make a choice. My question is : Could somebody\ndirect me to a source of information which would help me in my quest.\nI would like to get information about :\n     - the refresh rates the various cards provide;\n     - quality of windows drivers;\n     - standard vga performance (non-Windows stuff).\n\nDirect me to a magazine article or something like that (I got winvid.zip \ninfo, but it is not enough). If you have an ISA card you are really satisfied\nwith it,  let me know.\n	If this information is of any use, here is my system configuration:\n	- Fujikama 486 33MHz ISA system (Contaq motherboard)\n	- monitor DARIUS 14" non-interlaced multisync (up to 1024X768) \n                               (can reach 70kHz horizontally)  \n\nI would also like to know if it is a standard for video drivers to allow\nscreen dimensioning and screen positioning by writing on the EPROM of the\ngraphic card. This is the case with my ATI card and it is very convenient\nwhen changing graphics mode since my monitor is not intelligent \nenough to record settings.\n\nMerci a l'avance for any information you would be kind enough to provide me,
hi folks\ni have a 386 25 mhz and now i'm buying a new 486\nfirst question) which is the best way to share hard disks\nand printer\np.s. my two pc will be far about 10 meter and i like to use\na parallel port or ethernet card and i like to share resource\nunder dos linux os2.1 and windows 3.1 & nt\n\n2) which 486? i think to buy 486 dx2 50mzh local bus\n  but i heard that some board coulnd't work properly \n  cause some incompatibilites is that true?\n\n  should a 486 dx 50 mhz a better solution\n\n  in case i buy local bus it's better to buy an accelerated\n  svga card with a normal local bus ide controller\n  or it is better to buy a local bus svga card non accelerated\n  with a normal ide controller?\n\n  3)  is there any accelerated local bus and possibly true color \n      svga card? at which price?   \n  4) i need to buy a cd which is the cheapest that is able to read\n     musical photo kodak and computer cd rom\n     i have heard about a sony and a mitsumi which is best?\n     and which controller work with its?
Well, I have a different story to recount.  I attempted to low-level format a\nWD 43MB disk about a year ago.  When I understood my error, I contacted WD.\nThey told me that I hadn't hurt the drive and that I should just run FDISK and\nFORMAT/S on it.  It was fine.  Also, I understand that Western Digital's BBS\nmay have some low-level formatting routines specifically available for IDE\ndrives.  You probably need to talk to them and get the straight scoop.

I must say that I have been a customer of Midwest Micro for over 4\nyears now, and have been well taken care of on each purchase.\nI have had many friends that have bought that same modem and (THEY)\ndo have some experience with setting up modems, so there have been\nno problems in 6 of them that I know of. The fact that your time\nto valuable for you to spend on the modem is where you went wrong.\nWHY you say because I must tell you of the 12 yes I say 12 PPI modems\nthat I have had in the past that I was trying to use on my bbs. They\nall were junk and were replace 3 times each, to ther point that\nI just said forget it and I wanted my money back. PPI's teck even\nsaid that they didn't even repair them. That they just strip the\nparts that are good and junk thr rest of the modem.\nI think it was more your fault than Midwest Mirco's faulkt...Sam

: I just bought a new IDE hard drive for my system to go with the one\n: I already had.  My problem is this.  My system only had a IDE cable\n: for one drive, so I had to buy cable with two drive connectors\n: on it, and consequently have to switch cables.  The problem is, \n: the new hard drive's manual refers to matching pin 1 on the cable\n: with both pin 1 on the drive itself and pin 1 on the IDE card.  But\n: for the life of me I cannot figure out how to tell which way to plug\n: in the cable to align these.  \n\nMost IDE drives that I have dealt with have had pin 2 labeled on the printed\ncircuit board (this is sufficient to determine which side is which).  If your\nIDE drive does not have a label, then you can look for a polarization notch in\nthe receptacle (the connector on the drive with the pins).  If the receptacle\nis center polarized, that is it has one rectangular notch about 4 mm wide\npositioned in the center of one side, then you can identify pin 1 as follows:\nlook into the pins with the notch at the top, pin 1 is at the top right.  On\nall drives I have seen this is toward the power connector.  As for which pin\nis pin 1 on the controller, well you can use the same criteria but look hard\nfor the labelling of any pin.  Once you know which end pin 1&2 are on or pins\n39 & 40 (the oposite end), then you are all set.  All you need to do is keep\nthe pin 1 end connected to the pin 1 end.  You don't even have to look at the\ncable itself.  Just trace the pin 1 side of the cable through.  Usually the\npin 1 of the cable is identified by a different color (red usually).  But\nbeware - many cable makers are not very careful about this - I have seen cables\nwith pin 40 being the one marked red.  Of course with non-polarized connectors\nthis doesn't matter - you can plug the cable in either way and YOU decide\nwhich side is pin 1.\n\n: Secondly, the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them.\n: I figure one end goes in the controler and then the other two go into\n: the drives.  Does it matter which I plug into the "master" drive\n: and which into the "Slave"?  any help appreciated.  thanks...\n\nIt doesn't matter what gets plugged where.  But it does matter how the drives\nare jumpered.  There will be (amongst other options) two jumpers that you\nshould be concerned with on BOTH drives.  One jumper will select whether the\ndrive is the slave or the master.  If it is the master, then a second jumper\nselects whether or not a slave is present.  You will have to consult the \ndocuementation that came with you drives.  If you do not have docuementation,\nthen just call the manufacturers hotline number or fax number if they have\none.  This kind of information is routinely needed by people just like\nyourself.  They will fax you complete info about the jumpers.  If you don't\nhave convenient access to a fax machine, then you can usually get voice\nhelp.  Or post the specific question to this group.  (I probably won't be\nable to help you).\n\nGood Luck
Is it possible through either pin configuration or through software\n   programming to change the IP numbers on an ethernet card?\n\nThe Ethernet card doesn't use the IP number (32-bits, usually\n#.#.#.#); it uses the Ethernet address (48-bits, usually\n#:#:#:#:#:#). I have never run across an Ethernet controller that\ncannot be programmed to use an address that is not assigned to it.\nDECNET requires this feature.\n\nHowever, that said, there is no reason to ever change the Ethernet\naddress.  They are globally unique, the first three bytes being\nassigned to the manufacturer by the IEEE, and the last three by the\nmanufacturer.

I totally agree with your friend, since when the CPU is apparently idle\nit is still in fact churning away millions of instructions per second\n(checking for keyboard input for instance).  \n\nThe exception to this is for CPU's used in laptops, where the CPU can\nenter an idle state where it is just preserving its current status but\ndoing absolutely nothing.  In this case it needs a hardware interrupt\nto get it going again.\n\n\n--\n_____________________________________________________________________\n\nVictor Buttigieg					e-mail:	victor@uk.ac.man.ee.comms\n\nCommunications Research Group\n\nUniversity of Manchester

A couple of months ago I tried out a Hercules Graphite card.  A pretty nice\nboard.  Fairly fast, and seemed quite compatible -- even seemed to handle the\nSVGA modes I have whined about here on occasion.  At the time I was just\nbuying a VLB system, so after checking out the card I sent it back.  I wanted\na VLB card, and purchased a Fahrenheit VLB card.  This card is fairly fast,\nwill do 70 Hz refresh at 1024x768, but is not compatible with my CD-ROMS\n(the SVGA thing -- I think; I have merely conjectured that is the cause of\nan old graphics board being able to run in a higher resolution with those\nprograms than the modern boards I have tried.  I have not gotten a straight\nanswer out of anybody...).  The monitor I am using it with is a 17" Magnavox,\nwhich also tops out at 1024x768x70 Hz so its really a pretty good match.\n\nBut...\n\nThat is for my wife.  I just purchased a Viewsonic 17 for myself, and am\nlooking for a graphics card to drive it.  I want > 70Hz refresh,\nand would really like it to handle my CD-Roms.  I tried the Orchid P9000,\nwhich did neither of those things (though Robert at Wietek did say that the\nto Hercules.  They were supposed to be coming out with a VLB version of the\nGraphite around the end of March.  I have heard precisely ZERO about it since\nthen.  Does anyone know if the card was actually released, and what capabilities\n(and price) it has?\n\nAny info would be most appreciated.
Would someone be willing to explain to me the 486DX 50MHz is not more\npopular than it is?  I would think it would be just as fast, if not \nfaster than the 486DX 66MHz for certian applications.  Plus, a 50MHz \nmotherboard would seem better if you had any plans on upgrading the\nchip in the future.  I must be missing something, since everyone is \nbuying the DX2 66...  Many adds don't even mention the DX 50.
One of the things going for the DX2-66 (over the 50) is that it's\nclock speed complies with the VESA local bus spec.\n\nLance Hartmann (lance%hartmann.austin.ibm.com@ibmpa.awdpa.ibm.com)\n               Yes, that IS a '%' (percent sign) in my network address.
Yep.  I've done this, too.  The trick is to use a tiny screwdriver and push\ndown on the "latch" of each pin and then pull it out of the connector.  Label\neach one first with tape so you don't get them confused after you've pulled\nthem out.  Compare the pinout tables in the Mitsumi and Soundblaster manuals\nto get the correct orientation.

a 286 upgrade would probably cost about $50, 386 about $150 or so.  \nCoprocessors or accelerator cards would cost at least that much.
Having in mind the size of the images, my opinion is to go with VLB.\nIt has _much_ more bandwith that EISA, which in fact can be utilized\nby the craphics card. (I have not made measures, so someone else may\nshare experience on that.)\n\nAlso, the DX2/66 is faster in the operations, that run off internal\ncache, slightly slower off the external and about the same off memory.\nSo my advice is the 66/VLB.\n\n\n\n\nHave You tried running Photostyler without the cache? No need to have\npaging and cache both. (Well, you might argue, that the paging is\ncached). My belief (no measurements) is that apps left with more\nmemory will manage it better than smartdrv.exe(sys).\n\n\nThe bandwidth (theoretical) of ISA is over 5MB/s, which is far from\n0.15MB/s. I tried my ISA IDE hard drive (Maxtor 213MB) and got the\nsame results - 0.65MB/s - regardless of the ISA bus speed\n(5.5-8.25MHz). So I guess, that just the card/drivers combination is\nlousy.\n\n\nThe rumors are that DX3-99 (if any) is the most likely chip to come\nout. But note, that IBM is closest to the technology an it will only\nsell whole motherboards, so you'll have to upgrade the MB.\n\n\nJust some view, not much figures.\n\n--\nPenio Penev  x7423 (212)327-7423 (w) Internet: penev@venezia.rockefeller.edu

Tech)\nadvertisements, the US Army used a bunch of these to keep their PCs running\n(w/o a/c) in Desert Storm.  I can't vouch for that.  However, I am a satisfied\ncustomer.  And I have no other connection with the maker or the mail-order\nhouse (Lyben  (313) 268-8100).\n\nHope this helps,
I have a 486/33 IBM clone with two serial ports (com1, com2) and mouse port.\nBoth the serial ports are directly sitting on the mother board.  I tried to\ninstall a 2400 buad Hayes internal modem, but it doesnt work.  Once I dial any\nnumber the system locks.  I do not hear any click or ring before it the system\nhangs.  The modem has a 2 pin dip switch to select the appropriate port.  Once \nI change the settings on the dip switch, the system starts working again.\n\nThen I bought a 2400 baud Hayes external modem and checked the system.  It\nworks fine with both the serial ports.  The internal modem has been checked on\nanother machine and it works fine, but does not work on my machine.\n\nCan anyone please help me to find the problem.
This isn't at all too high of a price.  Keep in mind that you get *8* meg of \nram, a *local bus* IDE *and* SVGA card,  a *250* mb hd, and a *15"* \nmonitor.  The local bus IDE and SVGA really kick butt in Windows.  I have \nused a couple of machines with VLB in the past, and all I can do is praise \nGateway.

Thinking of buying from MidWest Micro of Ohio? Think *very* carefully.\nUnless you are absolutely sure you won't have any problems, you may want\nto trade elsewhere.\n\nDespite the fact that they answer the phone, "Hi! I'm <whoever> and we're\nhaving a GREAT Day!", they weren't quite so happy when I wanted to return\na modem that didn't work as I expected it to.\n\nThe details:\n\nI ordered one of their house brand "Infotel" 14.4/DF internal FAX modems.\nIn reality, it was a Twincom Lightning FAX that had a paper sticker over\nthe name. Given the poor reports on the net about this modem, I would not\nhave ordered it, had I known this in advance.\n\nIt arrived on time. The documentation stated that it would work (and was\npreconfigured) as COM4, providing that COM2 was not in use at the same time.\n\nFor several reasons, I have a serial card configured for COM1/COM2. At the\ntime I installed the modem, nothing was connected to COM2.\n\nAlthough the modem appeared to work, during every connection at 9600 or\n14.4, it would randomly break the connection and hang up the phone. After\nspending some time on the phone with MidWest's tech support, they suggested\ndisabling the COM2 port.\n\nThis appeared to solve the disconnect problem, but was an unacceptable long\nterm solution. I had to have COM1 and 2 available, even though they both\nwould not be in use at the same time as the modem.\n\nI called back 20 minutes prior to their closing and waited in Voicemail \nhell, listening to repeated advertisements for MidWest Micro products. I \nwas then promptly disconnected. Apparently it was quiting time and they \ndidn't want to be bothered with callers that had been waiting on the line.\n\nI called the next day and asked the Customer Diservice agent for an RMA\nnumber. She promptly switched me to a "Tech Support" rep that implied that\nit was my equipment at fault and that he wasn't going to give me an RMA\nnumber. He suggested I use some nonstandard IRQ settings, a solution I\nwas not happy with. The modem should work as originally configured.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI'm not sure the modem would work ok in a basic system, but it clearly does\nnot work in a multi port system like mine. Since my time is worth more \nthan the aggravation or the cost of the modem, I gave it to a local\ncharitable organization (with a description of my problem) and ordered\na Practical Peripherals 14.4MT from PC Connection.

I'd \nleave my name and phone #, but I didn't even get called back *ONCE*.  I AM \nONE PISSED OFF T.C.

david@c-cat.UUCP (Dave) write:\nwe are talking about a SCSI-1 device (e.g. HD) on a SCSI-2 Controller.\n\nHere is a rewrite of my Mac & Info sheet SCSI section:\nSCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.\n Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card \n expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  Normal {asynchronous}\n SCSI is 5 Mhz;  fast {synchronous} SCSI is 10 Mhz.  Difference between these\n modes is mainly in the software drivers.\n Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal \n terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port \n {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and end. \n Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. \nSCSI-1:  8-bit; 7 devices per SCSI controller.  asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}\n and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  8-bit SCSI-2 is often mistaken for\n a fast version of SCSI-1 {see SCSI-2 for details}.\nSCSI-2: fully SCSI-1 compliant. SCSI-2 mode - 10 devices per SCSI controller.\n 8-bit SCSI-2 is implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it can run using\n SCSI-1 hardware and software drivers which limits it to 7 devices, which\n results in it sometimes being mistakenly consitered part of SCSI-1.  16-bit\n and 32-bit SCSI-2 require different ports, electronics, and SCSI software\n drivers from SCSI-1 {Which makes them more expensive than other SCSI\n interfaces}.  32-bit SCSI seems to run only in synchronous mode, hence term\n 'wide and fast SCSI' Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit},\n 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst\n {32-bit}.\n\n8-bit SCSI-2 is the BIGGEST headache due to the fact that it is the ONLY SCSI-2 \nthat I know of that can pump SCSI-2 speeds through SCSI-1 devices and software\ncontrolers.  Its MAIN implimentation is on the Mac though you do see adds\nfor SCSI-2 at 10MB/s maximum throughput for PCs.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 does NOT\nNEED all the hardware {including electonics} and software of 16-bit and 32-bit\nSCSI-2 it is the CHEEPEST of the SCSI-2 interfaces.  Just pop out the SCSI-1\nelectornics and pop in 8-bit SCSI-2 electronics.  Some people consider\n16-bit where SCSI-2 REALLY starts {I USED to be one of them} but\n4-6MB/s average though put with a theoretical burst of 10MB/s is NOT SCSI-1\nbut is 8-bit SCSI-2.\nRule of thumb: if it is SCSIn and OVER 5MB/s then it is SOME type of SCSI-2.

I have a friend with an original HP LaserJet.  The nameplate does not \nspecify a number, but since the LJ II followed later, one assumes that he \nhas a LJ I.   His problem is a tax program which requires a 17 cpi font to \nprint the forms properly.\n\nThis unit came to market in 2 versions.  The plus version supported \ndowloadable fonts.  You can guess which one my friend has - the plain, not \nthe plus.  The printer does though have a slot and he has a small selction \nof cartridges including a 16.6 cpi - but none with a 17 cpi font.\n\nCan anyone suggest a source for a cartridge with a 17 (or 18?) cpi font?  \nAlternatively, is an upgrade to the plus version available at reasonable \ncost?\n\nAny suggestions would be welcome.\n\nThanks\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n * WinQwk 2.0b#943 * Seattle Rain Festival - Jan. 1 to Dec. 31

Try this: attach the serial\nport of the printer to a serial port on the PC.  Use the mode command to set\nthe COM port settings.  Try\n\nC>MODE COM1,9600,N,8,1\n\nto set the port parameters.  Then use the MODE command to redirect the\nprinter port LPT1 like this:\n\nC>MODE LPT1=COM1\n\nThis should work.  Good luck!\n\n... Time flies like an arrow.

No. All that I've seen have also an on-board BIOS which enables you to\nuse up to 2 hard drives directly under DOS (2 drives is a DOS\nlimitation and you have the same problem with IDE and all other\nstandards for that matter). Software drivers often allow for better\nperformance, though. You have to use them if you want to use other\ndevices besides hard disks or have more than 2 disks.\n\n\nObviously these are not able to use the 16-bit real mode BIOSes that\nare written for DOS, so you need software drivers. That's not a big\ndeal (as long as the drivers are available), because you won't have to\nfight with any low memory problems either.
Yes, it's easy to use. It's just like an ordinary controller.\nYou don't have to change the bios config.\n\nIt's transparent. It works with any drive. If you change the\ndrive you only need to change the bios config. as usual.\n\nYes, no problem.\n\nThat depends. You will get a little better performance\nif you use smartdrive and buffers in addition. That's\nbecause access to the card through the ISA bus is slower\nthan access to system RAM. I don't use smartdrive myself,\nbut I have a few buffers.
Why is it going to take a year for V.fast to become a standard? Are there\ntechnical problems to work out, or is it just bureaucratic slowdown? THANKS!
Many (all?) XT drive controllers have their own BIOS on board to handle low-\nlevel formatting.  The BIOS also allows you to set up the drive properly\n(# of cylinders/heads/etc).
Then again, maybe $2445 for the gateway system isn't too cheap.\n\nI have a system from Micron computers:
NO! I'm running both at home. Ok, to the cumpter is turned off right now but I\ndid boot BSD/386 from an IDE drive, most of the system is on a SCSI drive...\n\nI'm using an Adaptec 1542B and a no-name el-cheapo IDE card.\n\n\nGuy
He's right ya know.  I've helped to install Dos 6 on about 4 computers now,\nmine included.  On one, he bought the Stacker to Doublespace converter,\nand it worked fine (rather, he sent in the coupon for the converter).\n\nIn other cases, I've run the doublespace installation without a problem\nwhen compressing a new drive, compressing free space, or whatever else.\nSeems to work for me.\n\n\nWell, I ran the normal SETUP thing and it worked fine for whatever that's\nworth.\n\n\nCouldn't agree more.  On my 486-50 I don't miss the speed.  It's still\nfaster than a normal disk read would be.  As for the less compression,\nI've sacrificed that in favor of the convenience of having the dblspace.bin\nload before anything else.  With Stacker, any changes to your config.sys\nor autoexec.bat meant rebooting twice so it could update those.\n\nPersonally, I'm waiting for Stacker 4.0 to come out and implement those\nhooks and stuff.  Plus, the DEFRAG that comes with DOS is okay, but I\nmuch prefer COMPRESS from PC-TOOLS for sheer bells and whistles.  Plus,\ndefrag is sooooo sloooow on a dblspace drive.\n\n\nDitto.
I have uploaded the most recent Windows drivers for the Cirrus GD5426 \nchip based display cards to the uploads directory at ftp.cica.indiana.edu\n (file is 5426dr13.zip). They're very recent, I downloaded them from the \nCirrus BBS (570-226-2365) last night. If you are unable to get them there, \nemail me and maybe I can upload them to some other sites as well.  \nI have a local bus based card (VL24 Bitblaster from Micron) but I think \nthe drivers work with ISA cards (or at least includes drivers for them).\n\nI found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 1.2 version, \nimproving my graphic winmarks (v3.11) by about 2 million (7.77 to 9.88) \nalthough this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on \nCirrus's part but I don't think so.\n\nFrom Steve Gibson's (columnist for Info World) graphic card comparisons \n(also found at the cica ftp site under the name winadv.zip) I extracted the \nfollowing for the sake of comparison:\n\n							Wintach\n             		Winbn3.11	Word	Sprsht	Cad	Paint	Overall\nSteve's system:\n486/33 VLB:\nATI Graphics Ultra Pro	  9.33		10.34	 20.78	8.28	14.90	 13.58\n\nmy system -\n486sx/33 VLB:\nVL24 Bitblaster		  9.88		 8.65	 11.71	18.84	15.40	 13.65\n\n\nIts no Viper, but I think its a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of \nthe ATI card and when compared to the other cards included in Gibson's review.\n\nMicron system owner's, I would be interested to hear your opinions on the \nDTC 2270VL local bus disk controller. My system came with a Maxtor 7120 \ndrive (120 MB) and at first was only giving me disk winmarks of about 16 Kb/s, \nI am now at 22 Kb/s. Is this about as good as it gets? I can't get a Norton's\nsysinfo disk reading because the contoller intercepts the calls, at \nleast that was what the program said.

[REMAINDER DELETED]\n\nI don't have my copy of the manual with me right now, but I can offer the\nfollowing in the interim:\n\n   1)  The card uses port addresses 0x2E0 and 0x2E8 (which are NOT\n       configurable).  These addresses, incidentally, were inadvertantly\n       omitted from my version of the manual.\n\n   2)  I believe there is a dip that controls whether or not to enable\n       IRQ 2 (for CGA or EGA support??!?).\n\nLance Hartmann (lance%hartmann.austin.ibm.com@ibmpa.awdpa.ibm.com)\n               Yes, that IS a '%' (percent sign) in my network address.
I have a 286 with a Western Digital WD-93044A hard drive. This drive is \n782 cylinders with 4 read write heads PHYSICALLY, but LOGICALLY it is\n977 cylinders with 5 read write heads (??!!).

This is normal behavior for these drives (and many other models). The drive\nis doing a recalibration -- adjusting for temperature changes. If you leave\nthe machine on the frequency of the recalibrations goes way down.
I have one of these monitors. It appears to function OK, but is unhookable\nto anything standard (CGA,EGA,VGA) - it will plug in but gives fuzzy\ndiagonal noise. \nI also have a graphics board that is apparently a 3270 graphic board\n(double card with 2 8-bit bus connectors, and a 9-pin female connector\nwith a picture of monitor). I tried plugging these two into a standard AT\nto no avail. How can one connect these to (the monitor seems to\nbe of relatively high quality, so I'm curious)? Any special drivers and/or\nsetup needed - I can't locate any jumpers on the card.
Simple.  First, Andrew is correct, although I can see where there might be\nsome confusion.  It is indeed possible to have two cards *configured* to use\nthe same interrupt.  They can not *share* the interrupt in the sense that it\nis not possible to have both cards active at the same time.\n\nHere is an example.  For some time, I was short of "free interrupts."  I had a\ntape controller (not a "floppy tape") that needed one of IRQ0-IRQ7.  (It's an\n*old* tape drive.)  My solution was to use IRQ3 (also used for COM2, where my\nmodem is).  I did this because I reasoned I would never be using the modem and\nthe tape simultaneously.  When kermit runs, it installs its own interrupt\nhandler for IRQ3 and uses the serial port.  If the tape drive were to generate\nan interrupt, kermit would not have a clue what to do with/for the tape\ncontroller.  (And since the tape controller would not be serviced, it would\nmost likely "hang.")  Likewise, when the tape backup software runs, it\ninstalls an interrupt handler for IRQ3.  That handler won't do anything for\nthe serial port.\n\nUnder DOS, printing is NOT interrupt-driven.  Instead, the BIOS polls the\nstatus of the parallel port to determine when another byte may be sent.\nThat's why you can have your sound card and LPT1 both configured to use IRQ7.\nTry that on NT and see how far you'll get. :-)\n-- \nKenneth R.

That is, if the special software is free, like Xfree86.  There are\nvendors that sells Diamond X drivers for commercial Unices.  But\nthen, they charge $$$$.\n\n\nI think they only need a signing (i.e. no paying).  This still\nviolates the FSF's policy of publically available code.\n\n\nWhile this is true, there are fixes for those who have already\nbought Diamond cards.  In Linux, for example, there are utilities\nthat will put the card in VESA mode before invoking X.  Of course,\nthis means no fine tuning of Diamond cards, but at least this\nwill allow those who're stuck with them to use Linux+X.\n\nI agree with Mark's suggestion:  If you are buying a video card\nfor specialized free software, avoid Diamond.

I have a 386DX clone, with a DTC ESDI controller and Toshiba 660\nmbyte\ndrive. Since installing DOS 6.0, when I tried to re-install software\nfrom\n5 1/4 or 3 1/2 disks, when I mount the second..third..fourth disks, DOS\n6\ndoesn't recognize that I have changed floppies. If I do a "DIR", I see\nthe\ncontents of the previous diskette. The only way to get DOS to recognize\nthat\ndiskettes have changed, is to do a "label", and then to not label them.\n\n   Buying DOS 6.0 has been a colossal mistake. DOS 5.0 was stable, and\nworked\nwell with my equipment. I have Superstor Pro, and DESQVIEW/X ( with\nQEMM, \nManifest, etc), so there aren't any features of DOS 6 that I am using. I\nguess\nI should roll back to DOS 5.0 but I am wary of what will happen when I\ndo it.\n\n   Besides, like a fool, I don't have a DOS 5. bootable disk anymore.\nI've\nmade the same mistakes I caution my users not to make. Like sheep, I\njoined \nthe crowd flocking to DOS 6. Baaa Baaad system administrator.

They will continue to service interrupts, etc.,\netc.  The clock will always be running at n Mhz no matter\nwhat it's doing.\n\nI suppose depending on the instruction, the CPU may use\ncircuitry which has more transistors than other\ninstructions, but if you consider the additional heat\ngenerated by only a handful of additional, tiny resistors\nand then spread that heat dissipation over the CPU's\npackaging, the change in temperature to the immediate\nenvironment (ie. the surface of the package) will be\nnegligible.\n\nCheers, Ben\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBen J.

I've done some ASIC and digital design, but not any CPU design.\nIt would seem to me that on a 486, the FPU is not being used, most of\nthe cache is not being accessed, the off chip buffers/drivers are idle,\nthe multiplier isn't multiplying, the barrel shifters aren't shifting,\nmicrocode isn't microcoding, etc.  This means transistors aren't\nswitching which means less power dissipated (in CMOS), which means\nless heat.\\n\nFrom what I understand, the Pentium shuts down those sections of the\nCPU which aren't being used in order to cut down on heat/power.
Doesn't anybody actually read the licence agreement of WinBench\nbefore blindly running it?

Howdy,\n\nI recently upgraded the original BIOS in a Compaq Deskpro 286/12\nwith a Phoenix replacement BIOS, in order to support an IDE hard drive,\nand a high-density 3.5" floppy.\n\nI assumed that this would be a plug-and-play procedure, but I have\nencountered a problem that Phoenix and Compaq are unwilling to admit\nresponsibilty for, and I was wondering if anyone else had seen it.\n\nEverything is hunky-dory except the 3.5" floppy, which will read, but NOT\nWRITE diskettes.

They can put you on line with replacement BIOS chips.  I had\nto do this when I upgraded a Emerson 386/20 to an IDE drive.\n\nAlso, if you are installing an IDE drive, and there is a BIOS setting that\nhas a total volume the same as the IDE drive's volume, try using it.

I ran out of time on my last reply to this string and I don't\nknow if it was sent or not but.

They may of thought that you didn't\nknow what you were doing and suggested how to correct the problem.\nBut it sounded as you didn't give them much of a chance to correct\nthings at all. The fact that the PPI worked okay for you is because\nit is setup more for the no nothing user that can't understand the\ninstruction and the commands to configure it to his/her system.\nWhen you find out things like the fact the the EC led that looks like\nyou have connected to another EC modem, doesn't realy say that.\nBut that it only tells you that you have EC turned on, on your modem.\nI think that these LED are nothing more that just light to hype up\nthe product. Just like I bet someone took home a few extra $$$\nin the last year for giving the PPI modems the PC-Magazine award\nof the year. Not so for the stash (12) of them that I saw on my test\nbench.

I ran mine at 1280x1024x75 which was as\nfast as the Orchid P9000 could drive it.  Also, the 17 does claim to be able\nto support 1600x1280, but I have no experience with that.\n\nSince I have the spec sheet in front of me I'll type some in:\n\nCRT:	17", 0.28 mm dot pitch, 90 deg deflection, RGB mediou short\n	persisance, Tint (TM=52%), anti-static, anti-glare, anti-reflection\n\nInput Signal:  RGB Analog 0.7Vp-p, 75 ohms (also has setting for 1Vp-p)\n	Sync: H/V Separate(ttl), composite (+/-), sync on green (+/-)\n	horizontal freq: 30-82Khz, vertical freq: 50-90Hz\ncompatibility: PC from VGA to 1600x1280 non-interlaced, mac IIci and above\ncontrols: contrast, brightness, position, size, degauss, p-p voltage, color\n	temp, sync select, color tuning, moire on/off.\nvideo band witdth: 135 MHz\nMax brightness: 120 cd/m2 at white flat field\nmisconvergence: .35mm (max) at center, .45mm (max) at corner\ndimensions: 16.3"x16.22"x17.64", weight 42.6 lbs\n\nI don't know what some of those mean and don't verify their accuracy, I just \ntyped them in.  Other things they hype on the sheet are a 'double quaduple\ndynamic astigmatism focus'.  Right.  They mean they use two lenses.  Advanced\nInvar shadow mask.  ViewMatch color control which they claim is and easy-to-use\nsystem that adjusts colors to closely match printer output.  As near as I have\nbeen able to figure out, this translates to separate controls for red, green,\nand blue.  How this makes it easy to match for printer output is beyond me.\n\nBut beyond the hype, the monitor is very pleasant to look at.  Sharp, clear,\nand isn't nearly as bad as the NEC's for reflections.

The card is a VL-BUS card which\ncan display 16.7 million colours in 640x480 mode with 1MB DRAM.\n\nIt comes with ET4000/W32 window drivers and a normal Et4000 drivers.\nThe ET4000/W32 drivers handles, 640x480, 800x600, 1024x786 in 256 colours.\nAlso, in 640x480 and 800x600, it supports hicolor, 32K and 64K colours.\n\nHere is my winmark result running on a 16MB 486DX33 EISA/VL-BUS system using\nHint chipsets.\n\nWinmark 3.11 from ZD lab.\n\nUsing ET4000/W32 drivers\n640x480 256       10.63 megapixel/sec.\n        32k        7.34 \n        64k        7.30\n800x600 256       10.07\n        32k        6.38\n        64k        6.35\n1kx786  256        8.17\n\nUsing ET4000 drivers.\n640x480 16M        1.78\n800x600  16colours 4.01     \n1kx786   16        4.22\n\nFrom the result, the ET4000/W32 drivers are specialized to use the\nhardware feature of the Et4000/W32 chip whereas the ET4000 drivers are\njust normal driver for ET4000 based graphics card.\n\nThe price of this graphics card that I got is $185 from a local dealer.\nIt may be less from mail order. It has OS/2 2.0 drivers comes with it\nwhich supports 256 colors on all resolution.\n\nFrom these results, it has double the performance of a Et4000AX based card\nin 256 colours mode.
My disk that had my joystick code that some of you were kind enough to mail\nme puked....specifically, I am looking for C code to read the position\nof joystick WITHOUT using int15h, i.e. accessing port 0x200/0x201 directly.\n\nI need it in C becaues of memory model considerations.\n\nI only need to be able to read the X and Y position also.
Hi,\n\nI recently got a tower-case for my Gateway 486/33 file server, mostly because\nwe needed the extra drive bays and better power supply.  This case has LED's\nfor the processor speed, i.e. 33.  Is there a place to plug this in on the\nmotherboard?  If not, is there anyway to hack something to make it work?\n\nTIA!\n\n-Eric
I would like to know as well, since I just bought a 200MB Seagate IDE\ndrive and want to add it to my computer (a four-year-old Gateway\n386/20), which currently has an 80MB Seagate SCSI drive.  The SCSI\ncontroller is such that the docs told me not to specify it in the CMOS\nsetup, i.e. both hard drive settings are listed as "Not installed,"\nand apparently the SCSI controller works its wonders.  I wondering if\nthis is a problem.  Also, I remember how, when I helped my cousin\ninstall his second IDE drive, we had to define a master/slave\nrelationship for them; do I need to do something similar here?\n\n\nSame here.\n\nAny help would be appreciated, since I intend to install this drive\nASAP; I'd like to know what to do (and what not to do) before I start.\nThanks!\n--
To all netters,\n\n  In my last post that concerning about the CYRIX 486DLC CPU, I said the\nbenchmark program COMPTEST stated there is a bug in CYRIX CPUs. This is NOT\ntrue and I must apologize to the author of COMPTEST. The actual program\nthat gives this report is F-PROT 2.07, a virus detection and removal\nprogram. The report stated there is a bug in the Cx486SLC but not DLC.\nSorry, sorry, sorry...
The original poster, John Navitsky, said that he might use the monitor on\na SparcStation LX. The LX is able to generate a picture at 1280*1024 at\n76 Hz. Not officially, but I tried to set this resolution and refresh rate\nand the LX came up with a non-syncing screen. Our tube obviously couldn't\nhandle this speed. At 67 Hz, it worked perfectly.\n\nWhen buying a third party monitor that's going to be used on a SparcStation\nLX, you might consider a monitor that's fast enough to do 1280*1024 at 76Hz.\nI don't know for sure whether the LX supports this (Sun certainly won't tell\nyou) so you'll have to check.
After reading many postings concerning hard drives I'm still unclear\nabout one thing.  These new "cached hard drives" - is the cache on the\ndrive itself or is it separate, like on the controller or something?\nThanks to anyone who can clear this up.\n\n--
hartzman@kilroy.Jpl.Nasa.Gov (Les Hartzman) writes...\n\n\nLes,\n\n	I am right now working on an MPR-II certified (Swedish standards for\nlow emissions) Hitachi Superscan 15 monitor.  It's 1024x768, up to 72hz at\nthat res, and it got a good write-up for image quality in a recent (Feb.?)\nissue of PC Magazine.  As far as I know, very little fully matches a NEC in\nimage quality (at least according to the mags -- I can't tell any\ndifference between the two!), but I think NEC is low emissions on only one\nof the two types.  There's VLF (Very Low Frequency) and ELF (I think that's\nExtremely Low Frequency).  The MPR-II standards set strict limits on both.\nBut many comapnies, NEC included according to one article I read (I get a\nbunch of mags so it's hard for me to remember which!), which claim "low\nemissions" but not specifically "MPR-II Compliant" or "MPR-II Certified"\nonly control for one, usually VLF, and ignore the other.\n	So, the NEC probably has higher overall image quality (I consis-\ntently hear it rated as the best or close to the best), but not as low\nemissions as the Hitachi.  I like my image quality, but for all I know you\nmay be more discerning.  Good luck!\n\n					- Mitch\n 					v063kcbp@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu
I went out and bought the PAS16 yesterday, and installed it into my Gateway\nDX2-66V. I followed the instructions and set the SB side with DMA 1 and IRQ5\n(the default) and then the PAS side with DMA 5 and IRQ 10. My question is how\nshould I configure for MPU-401 compatibility. The manual and installation\nprogram recommended IRQ2, but on my machine it is configured to [cascade] to\nIRQ8-15. So can I still use IRQ2, or should I choose a different one? Right now\nI have the MPU-401 emulation mode turned off. Actually what is this "cascade to\nIRQ8-15" business?  \n\nA related questions (to other GW or VL-bus machine owners) I was told that \nonly DMA 5, 6, 7 are 16 bit DMAs, and 0-4 are 8 bit DMAs. Now what about\n32-bit VL-bus mastering DMAs?? Which DMA channel(s) is used by the VL-bus\nextension to do 32-bit DMA?\n\nYet another question, after installing PAS16, my Links (golf game) will hang\nthe machine when I select SB mode and run, but works with Adlib mode??\nCivilization however works fine ( at least so far). Any body knows what I might\nhave done wrong?
Hello,\n\nI'am almost ashame to ask this question. It really looks like a FAQ, but couldn't\nfind the answer. Anyway...\n\nThe original IBM-PC/XT 83 or 84 key keyboard is, in my opinion, still the best\nkeyboard around. Function keys on the right place (eh.. left place), firm click,\netc. Is there any chance to connect one of these to a modern 386 AT clone?\n\nI do understand that the new AT keyboard has more functionality. I.e. the\ntypematic repeat rate is programmable etc. It seams to me that the pins &\nelectrical specs. of the old and the new keyboard are, however, the same. \nMaybe the communication protocol is different? \n\nPlease answer by e-mail. Also if you can tell me that is absolutely impossible.\nIn that case, i will bring the keyboard the museum of obsolete technology.\n\nThanks,\n\nDuco\n\n--
Yes, but what if my monitor only has 3 BNC's on it, and is expecting\nto get a composite sync signal on the "green"?  There ought to be a\nlittle black box that takes the VGA signalling (which has horiz, vert,\nand composite sync on different pins, plus the R, G, and B pairs) and\nmerges the green and composite sync together in the output.  It's all\n1V analog, as far as I know.  I can build this with op-amps but I don't\nthink I can get the shielding done well enough to handle the frequencies\ninvolved without lots of shadows and junk on the screen.\n\nDoes anyone know of a VGA->RGB(composite sync on green) converter?
NOTE:  followups to comp.dcom.modems (for obvious reasons)\n\n\n\n\nthe Courier is their top-of-the-line product, thus the higher price.  I've\nnever taken a real look at the Sportster line (only Couriers), but from what\nI've gathered, it's basically more of an entry-level modem.  probably\ndoesn't meet the same specifications that the Courier does.  I'm not sure\nif the Sportster line is fully DSP driven like the (more recent) Courier\nmodems are, so upgrades in the future may be an issue.\n\nagain, take all of the above with a grain of salt...I've never evaluated\nthe Sportster, so I'm going by bits and pieces that I've heard.  if you\nwant a real answer, post the question in comp.dcom.modems and you'll find\npeople who HAVE worked with the Sportster.\n\npersonally, though, if I were going to look at the Courier modems, I'd\nbuy the Dual Standard...then I'd get both HST and V.32bis.  in fact, this\nis exactly what I did.  :-)  I'm sitting here looking at my USR DS right\nnow.\n\nand now, to correct a few VERY incorrect statements....  folks, if you want\nto get reliable answers to modem and/or UART questions, post them to\ncomp.dcom.modems.  if you post in other groups, you never know what you'll\nget in the way of an answer (you may very well get a good answer...or you\nmay get something like the one below).  at least in cdm, if someone posts\ncomplete and utter bs, you'll see a flurry of folks correcting them (to\navoid spreading faulty info).\n\n\njust as it does at lower speeds, too.  there is absolutely nothing in\neither CCITT Recommendation V.42 or V.42bis that says that they can only\noperate on modems that are running V.32bis.  V.42bis, of course, is\ncurrently only *STANDARDIZED* for operation on top of V.42 (in its primary\nmode of operation, LAPM), but that's about as far as that goes.\n\nand just in case there's some confusion on this, V.42/V.42bis are also\nsupported by the Courier line (unless you have a really ancient one).\n\n\ntake a second look at the original question:\n\n                                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nsee the V.32bis up there?  the question was not about the Courier HST\nmodem, or about the Courier Dual Standard...it was about the Courier\nV.32bis modem.  the modem in question does not support HST, period.  it\ntherefore does not support the 16.8 kb HST.\n\nalso, not all Courier HST / Courier Dual Standard modems support the 16.8 kb\nversion of HST.  my Dual Standard only supports HST at 14.4 kb.  there are\neven older models that only run HST at 9.6 kb.\n\n\nHST is USR's proprietary modulation scheme....  but we're not talking about\nHST, we're talking about V.32bis.  V.32bis is most definitely *NOT* a\nproprietary modulation scheme.\n\n\nI do hope you didn't mean for these two sentences to be related in some\nway.....\n\nfirst off, V.32 and V.32bis are both synchronous and asynchronous.  this is\npart of the CCITT Recommendation (i.e., part of the standard).  it isn't a\nfeature unique to the Sportster (I just looked at the appropriate chapter\nin the Courier DS manual).\n\nsecond, HST is not ``one way only.''  more correctly put, it is an\nasymmetrical modulation scheme, meaning it doesn't work at the same speed\nin both directions.  HST operates at [9.6 / 14.4 / 16.8] in one direction,\nand has a low-speed back-channel in the other direction.  the high-speed\nchannel goes in the direction of the higher data flow.  this is fine if\nyou're logged on to say, a BBS, and type one letter and get screens of\ninfo back, transfer files (not using bimodem), etc....  there is, of course,\na penalty for turnaround time when the high-speed channel needs to reverse\ndirections.\n\nV.32 and V.32bis are both symmetrical, meaning they do transfer the full\ndata rate in both directions at the same time.\n\nthird, synchronous vs asynchronous has absolutely nothing to do with\nsymmetrical vs asymmetrical...they are two completely different topics.\n\n\nagain, more correctly put, *SOME* of the Courier line will be upgradeable\nto whatever ``V.fast'' is called when it's complete.  if you have the large\nfootprint Courier modems (like I do), you're S.O.L.....  there was an\nupgrade plan a while back to upgrade to a small footprint variety, which\ncould eventually be upgraded to support V.fast, but the cost of the two\nupgrades together pretty much put it higher than just buying a new modem.\n\nlater.....\n   --jim\n\n--\n#include <std_disclaimer.h>                                 73 DE N5IAL (/4)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nINTERNET: jim@n5ial.mythical.com  |  j.graham@ieee.org     ICBM: 30.23N 86.32W\nAMATEUR RADIO: n5ial@w4zbb (Ft.

Gateway service has confirmed my suspicion, echoed by a couple of people\nwho responded to the original request for help.  The ATI VLB video board\nuses the addresses for COM 4.  They could suggest no work around.\nI will be returning the DF IO card they supplied for COM 4 (even though it\ncould not possibly work) for credit against a bus mouse.  This will free\nup the COM port I need - too bad the original salesman who suggested either\nthe DF IO card or the bus mouse would solve my need for a port didn't know\nenough about the hardware.\n\nOtherwise I must say that the 486DX2/66 system has worked very well - no\nproblems with any other hardware or software.

It's not true.  IDE bus uses signals which has similar name and same\nmeaning to the counterpart of ISA bus but its (IDE bus) signal timing\ndoesn't have to be same to ISA signal timing.  My VL-IDE bus card has\na set of jumpers to set its transfer rate from 3.3MB/sec up to 8.3MB/\nsec (the manufacturer might have to correct these numbers as 3.3\n*milion* byte/sec and 8.3 *milion* byte/sec respectively).   You\ncannot transfer data at a rate of 8.3MB/sec on the ISA bus.\n\n\nKen Nakata
You can configure devices for the same IRQ as long as you don't use them\n*simultaneously*, under Dos at least. Both LPT1: and SB just sit there until\nyou tell them to do something. You can't configure a SoundBlaster for IRQ7\nif you got an Ethernet Card which hits that IRQ a thousand times or so per \nsecond.
Stupid question from a new IBM PC user:\n\nI'm going to be selling my Mac and getting a Gateway 2000.\n\nWhat is the difference between IDE HD and SCSI HD?\n\nThe GW 486DX-33V comes with a 250MB Western Digital IDE drive.\nI asked how much more for the Seagate 500MB SCSI drive.\n\nThe guy asked me "Why are you going with SCSI?".  I was lost for an answer.\nI just said "I know Seagate better as a company, from a satisfaction point\nof view".\n\nAre SCSI drives faster than IDE?  I'm not buying my GW for another 4 months\nor so, but this is a question that has bugged me for a while.
es:\n\nA couple other problems with the 486DX/50:\n\n1.)  System manufacturers had MAJOR problems solving the electromagnetic \ninterference problems with 486DX/50 systems.  Getting an FCC-B (home use) \ncertification required additional shielding in the system.\n\n2.)  HEAT...a lot of people seem to be installing heat sinks and/or cooling \nfans on their 486DX2/66 chips.  I would guess that the 486DX/50 ran \ntemperatures inside the case even hotter.  And heat is the enemy of system \nreliability.\n\nEd
I have a 105MB IDE drive and am having a few problems! I get \n'Data error on drive C' messages when reading some files. The problem is\nalso steadily getting worse.\n\nI have run some diagnostic software (PCTools V7.1) and it says that the\ndrive is OK - but it does have to retry some sectors and it briefly \nflashes up an error message (which is too quick to read).\n\nDoes anybody know of any cheap or free software which could mark these\nsectors as bad (DOS doesn't) or preferably perform a low level format.\nI have heard that the latter is possible on an IDE. Technical answers\nwould be appreciated. It would be nice to be able to use the disk again!!!
Hi,\n\nDoes anyone have a source for 386DX/25 Motherboards?  I've\nbeen calling around the local stores and everyone appears\nto be only stocking the 386DX/33/40 or 386SX/25/33 motherboards.\n\nHow difficult is it to modify a 386DX/40 motherboard to run at\n25 MHz?  Is it as simple as replacing the system clock with a\nslower part?\n\nThanks!
First you need to connect them with a null modem cable.\n\nAtleast thats what I've heard.
I have a 5FG and think it is great. I haven't seen the Nanao's so I\ncan't compare, but the 5FG image is very sharp and the color contrast is\n*extremely* good. I've used other Trinitron monitors (e.g. a Sun SS2 color\nmonitors, which is a 19" Trinitron), and think the 5FG is at least as good,\nperhaps brighter, and has *none* of these silly horizontal lines running across.\n	BTW, I could be wrong, but I thought that the 5FGe is slower as well\nas missing ACCUCOLOR. It may not be able to handle 1280x1024 the way the 5FG\ncan.
