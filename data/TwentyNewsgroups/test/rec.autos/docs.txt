Carrying in the glove box is not covered...I'm not sure what I was \nthinking there. It _is_ legal in Oklahoma. \n\nOn inter-state travel, as long as it is legal for you to own\nat your point of origination and destination, the gun is carried\nin a locked compartment/box (glove box specifically excluded) separate\nfrom the ammo, it is legal under Title 19, Chapter 44, Section 94(9? I\nforget, and my copy of the regs is at home) of the US Code. This,\nunfortunately, has not prevented the theft by state troopers of a\ncertain state (which shall remain nameless to protect the hopelessly\nstupid) under that state's law.\n\nGee, and I thought Federal Law overrode state law...\n\n				James

Hi all,\nI have available to me a set of Metric wheels (came off a Mustang or T-Bird)\nwhich are wearing nearly-bald Michelin TRX 220-55R390 tires.  The only place\nI have found these tires is the Tire Rack mailorder place for $121 a pop.\nIs there a cheaper source, or another manufacturer of this size tire?  Thanks\nfor any info...please E-Mail responses and I will post a summary if there is\nany interest.\n \n     JAS\n \nJIM STRUGLIA   C465353@MIZZOU1.MISSOURI.EDU
Especially the '68 Shelby-American GT-500KR (King of the Road, so named\nto steal GM's planned Camaro King of the Road's thunder :-)\n\n\nSome GT-40s are street legal, some aren't.\n\n\nI found my Shelby-American guide. There were a grand total 126 GT-40s\nbuilt:\n		GT-40 Coupes		55\n		GT-40 Road Cars		31\n		GT-40 Mk II		13\n		GT-40 Mk IIIs		 7\n		GT-40 Roadsters		 5\n		Mirages			 3\n		GT-40 Mk IVs		12\n		   	TOTAL:	       126\n		Additional uncompleted Mk IIIs	6-12\n\nTwelve of these cars were prototypes; 48 racing coupes; 31 road coupes;\neight Mk II coupes; 4 LHD Mk IIIs; and 3 RHD Mk IIIs. The other \nbreakdowns follow the above list (eg, 12 were Mk IVs). The LHD/RHD\nbreakdown is only given on the Mk IIIs.\n\nThe prices (for those which can be bought) are around the $1 Million\nmark, last I heard, with a projection of some $3.5 Million (or\nthereabouts) in 2000. It was second only to some penny-ante Ferarri ;-).\n\nShelby won the FIA World Manufacturer's Cup with his Cobras in '65; that\nwas also the year that he retired them from the Shelby-American racing\nteam (in favor of the Ford GT program the next year). That victory\nbroke a 13(?) year Ferarri winning streak.\n\nWell, there's lotsa info I could spout, but I'll refrain. Much of\nthis information comes from "Hot Rod" magazine's "Shelby American\nCobra/Mustang Guide," which has more info on the Shelby-American \nFords than you could _ever_ want to know.\n\n				James

Derek....\n\nThere is a tool available to reset the service indicator on BMWs but the lights\nwill come back on after 2-3 weeks. The tool is in fact illegal (in Europe \natleast). It is often the case that the unsuspecting punter trots off to buy a \nused BMW and a few weeks later, all the lights come on! Other than that, I know \nof no other tool.... anyone else? \n\nAbout changing oil every 15,000 miles.... thats ok.... on newer Audis, they \nonly require it after every 12,000 miles (I am talking about an oil change)\nJust a query: do you drive your car VERY VERY carefully? Like no sudden \nacceleration etc? If yeah, then the 15,000 M oil change seems quite reasonable.\nBut if you drive kinda fast... I'd get a bit up tight abot that 15,000 thingy\n\n(a point to note: just because the first light came on at 3k, doesn't mean\nall the others will come on every 3k too)
Stay away from GEICO.\n\n A recent CAR & DRIVER issue has an article about GEICO giving free\n laser guns to police departments to increase they're speed limit\n enforcement.  The article also said that if you get a speeding ticket\n your premium will increase dramatically based on how much "over the\n limit" you were.  If I remember correctly, at "more than 20 over",\n you'll get something like a 65% increase. \n\n If you have a radar detector, you will be denied coverage or dropped\n immediately. \n\n One accident claim and you will be dropped.\n After many years with GEICO, my father who had 0 tickets and had made\n 0 claims, had an accident and filed an $800 claim.  He was dropped \n immediately.  Since then he has been with State Farm for years with\n no complaints.\n\n I have been with State Farm for about 20 years - no complaints.
i have no experience with State Farm, but i think it's important to\ndifferentiate your experience from a typical "accident."
In the past few years I have owned 3 Mustang GTs and now own a 91 T-Bird SC. \nThey all have had this problem. There was a recall on the T-bird for the brake \nproblem. The Ford dealer replaced the rotors and pads but the rotors warp \nafter about 10K miles. Between this problem and the fit and finish problems on \nthe T-Bird I'll never buy a Ford again.
Talking about car alarms, there are certain cars in this country that are \nonly insurable if they are fitted with a Vecta alarm. We're talking Coswoths\nand Porsches and stuff. Just before they (the insurance companies) decided to \nmake this move, they insisted that the car be fitted with a Scorpion alarm (\nnow they've changed to the Vecta)... so everyone who's spent $$$ on fitting \nthe Scorpion alarm have founbd themselves having to upgrade to the Vecta system.
On the other hand, remember the old adage that a verbal agreement isn't worth\nthe paper it's printed on.  Once you sign, you are going to have one hell of a\ntime proving fraud based on a comparison to what you thought you were going to\nsign ...\n\nBeing in the right is one thing, proving it is another.
All gimmicks!  Stick with plain 'ol carnauba wax that's non-abrasive.\nEagle 1, Meguiars, Turtle Wax, and a few others are good examples.\nThe colored waxes just color in the scratches so they're not so \napparent.  The better approach is to buff minor scratches completely\noff with a cleaner/mild abrasive.\n\nNever tried Liquid Glass, although I still have this sample they sent\nme a few years back.
Just a quick note on the nwe shape MR2s in the UK.... \n\nWhen they first came out here, there were 3 models. The base model had an \nauto box and engine from the CAMRY 2.0 !!! Well I recentyl found out that this \nmodel is no longer profitable for Toyota and have since scraped it. I've also\nnoticed that auto MR2s have depreciated a lot more than the next model up...
I tried the AutoFom stuff on my 1991 Saturn SC, and was so disappointed with it\nthat I returned it for a refund.  I polished the car for 2 hours and couldn't\nremove the swirl marks/thin film that was all over the finish.  It also\nattracted more dirt than without the stuff.

Which Western states have laws that charge sales tax on the difference between\na new car's price and the trade-in's value?  I know California charges you on \nthe full value of the new vehicle regardless of trade-in.\n\nIf you are a California resident, is it legal to buy a car in a state other than\nCalifornia without also paying California sales tax?

In the EC, the Corrado VR6 is rated as 'best handling car this side of a \n968'. As it goes, I just read an article in 'Autocar & Motor' comparing the \nVR6 to a Ford Probe (later to be launched in the UK).... The VR6 is more powerful (even more so coz its 2.9 instead of 2.8 in the EC) and more fun to drive\netc etc... but the Probe has a slightly smoother engine (thanx Mazda MX6!)...
Either I've just fallen for this, or you guys\nare _really_ paranoid!\n\nYou're actually worried about somebody stealing \nyour oil?\n\nC'mon, you think a vandal'll do that?!\n\nThat's absolutely ridiculous!\n\nBesides, how hard is it to get under the car to \nchange the oil?\n\nI can say from experience on the cars that I've driven and\nchanged the oil on, my Mazda 323 is pretty much a pain, but\nonce you've done it once, you don't forget how, and it\ngets easier.\n\nI can't imagine any other cars are much worse than mine.
[i agree wholeheartedly!!]\n\n\nnot sure about there in CA, but here in US, the manuals are quite often the\nstandard equipment.  Of course, FINDING a car with one might be hard, but\nif you read the sticker on the window, there is usally an additional 2k or\nso tacked on for that lousy  tranny.  So you actually ARE paying more, just\nthat it's sometimes hard to find one that is equipped "standard".  (this\napplies to MOST cars, but not to the luxoyachts..eg caddilac, licolns, etc..)
Yup.  Radar detectors that detect Ka band will pick up photo radar\nas it's reflected from some poor slob ahead of you that just got nailed.\n\n	BTW, many photo radar installations in the southern U.S. became\ntargets for high-powered rifles, or had their lenses "decorated" with cow\nflop, etc.  Not that I'm advocating destruction of public property, but you\nget the picture....\n\nLater,

Not alone at all. My old 83 Accord (now in the hands of a sibling) has a much\nbetter engagement of the clutch. Even the old 84 Civic we keep as a beater \nfeels better in this aspect. Note that these are cars with 250,000 kms and\n140,000 kms respectively. My 90 Prelude blows both of them away in every \nrespect except smooth clutch engagement. Of course the Kawasaki is the best\nof the bunch but I need more than 2 wheels most of the time.\n\nThe Prelude has had a dud clutch from day 1, and after three years and 67,000\nkms is no better. Best of luck and feel free to add this to your collection.

I hadn't heard of the Valentine-1 before. Car&Driver and other auto\nmagazines\nrecommend BEL detectors.  I was considering their latest - the 966STi -\nwhich picks up Super Wideband Ka and Laser as well.  It also avoids \nradar detector detectors (although I really don't care about this since I\ndoubt I'll be driving in Virginia anytime soon - or have any other states\nalso made detectors iilegal?)\n\nHow does the Valentine-1 compare with the BEL products?
I have tested both vehicles (identically\nequipped), both for week-long periods.\nCuriously (and consider these are test\nvehicles), I found the Mercury higher\nin build quality than the Nissan.\n\nEither choice is good, but beware that\nI did not experience reasonable mileage\nwith the V6.  Average city driving was\n<15mpg, with about 21 avg. on the highway.\n\nBoth were optioned to the hilt (the Nissan\nhad leather!).  The Villager was in the\n$24K range and the Nissan was over $26K.

[Much discussion about economics of safety deleted]\n\n\nThis is a very simplistic view of safety. Assuming that you are in a collision\n(less likely with a more agile smaller car), then the important factor\nis how well does the car sacrifice itself to save you. This is why a thousand\npound F1 car can hit a wall at 200 and the driver walks out and why\neverybody dies when a Suburban hits a wall at 35 (as I recall for the last\ngeneration Suburban HIC numbers). \n\nAs an aside, just what is the point of an airbag? It seems to me that\nseatbelts with pretensioners (Audi et al), or a good tight 5 point belt \nwill prevent you every moving far enough to hit the airbag. You might be\n\nsaved from some flyign glass? Or is an airbag just a lowest common denominator\nsafety device that is of some use in a head on collision when you are\nwearing no seat belt?
It's pretty complex, and Cd isn't the whole story either.  Cd for cars is\nusually calculated based on the frontal area of the car.  So a large car\nwith a good Cd could get the same drag force as a smaller car with a\npoorer Cd. \n\nTo calculate drag use this formula:\n\nD = 1/2 * rho * v^2 * Cd * S\n\nWhere D is the drag force (lbs), rho is the local air density (slugs/ft^3),\nV is the velocity (ft/s), and S is the frontal area (ft^2).  Note that the\npieces called 1/2 * rho * v^2 are sometimes called qbar or dynamic pressure\n(a fancy aero term for air pressure or force). \n\nNote that power is:\n\nP = F * v\n\nWhere P is power (lbf-ft/s), F is the force, drag in this case (lbf) and v\nis velocity (ft/s). \n\nNote that if you put the whole equation into one (by substituting D for\nforce) you get a velocity _cubed_ term.  That's why huge increases in power\nresult in little increases in speed.  Ditto for decreases in Cd. \n\nSo if you have a 100 mph car and reduce Cd from .34 to .33, your new top\nspeed is:  (sound of trumpet fanfare)\n\n101 mph\n\nSorry to dissappoint.
And here's my two cents:\n\nThe best convertible for the money, IMO, is the Miata. Yes, it's small, but\nyou're buying it as a second car, I hope, so you don't need the cargo room\nof a big car. It's got enough power for fun, it's RWD like a sports car\nought to be (I'm gonna regret that :-{) and the top, while manual, operates\nlike a dream. 30 seconds and one hand to lower, and not much longer to raise.\n\nThe targa-type cars are nice, but they're not real convertibles.\n\n--
I am the original owner of the seats and the original poster. \nI take VERY serious offence in your statement. \nI see a lot of computers advertized on the net, and my friend just had been\nreleived of his machine = all the net-computer ads are for stolen computers?\nWhere did you learn logic?\n\nAs for the seats, they were replaced by a much harder (literally) Celica GTS\nseats due to my back problem. That is why I had to reuse the MR2 brackets\nand that's why the MR2 seats I sell are attached to Celica brackets.
I had a similar experience.  We had a written quote which had been mailed\nto us from the salesman at one of these "no-haggle" Toyota dealers for\na Camry XLE w/ABS, leather, etc.  The price seemed fair, but when we\nwent in to take them up on their offer, they "discovered" that certain\nextra cost items hadn't been included in their original written quote.\nIt would have totaled an extra $1100 and, in spite of the fact that we\nhad a written quote, they said there was nothing they could do.\n\nBottom line, quotes from salemen are worthless and it appears to me that\nthe Toyota dealers think they've got such a superior auto that they\ndon't have to deal.  We walked, went out and bought a new LH car\n(Eagle Vision TSI) and I don't regret it one bit!
When do the new M.benz "C" class cars come out?\nThe new nomenclature that MB has adopted will it only apply to the "c"\nclass cars or will it also apply to the current "s" class cars.\nDoes any one know what will replace the current 300 class since the "c"\nclass will be smaller and more in line with the current 190. \nAnother question, Is BMW realising a new body style on the current 7\nseries and 5 series. They seem to be a bit dated to me.
I think the Blue Book is the NADA handbook for used car prices, no?\n	Is the Blue Book value given the retail or wholesale value???  The \n	Blue Book value isn't set in stone, though.  Low milage, extra addons\n	and stuff like that there can increase the resale price of the car, you\n	may want to head on over to the local library or borrow your friends\n	Blue Book and read up on that sort of stuff.  I paid ~$400 under BB\n	(retail) for my '87 Civic in 1990, and it was in perfect condition and\n	had only ~14.5K miles on it.  The guy was desparate to sell, new kid on\n	the way, etc., but it was a good price.  Remeber, both you and the \n	buyer, if he has any sort of brains at all, are using the Blue Book, so\n	you should pick a fair price.  \n\n\n				Chintan Amin\n				llama@uiuc.edu
Hi! This is my first time to post on this news group. Now a days , I have stucked at a certain problem. I have '88 mazda mx-6, non  turbo fuel injection.\n   There is a engine warning signal on the dash board. While driving, this signal turns on, but not always. What does this mean? In the manual, they say "Go to authorized mazda dealer.". It is really good idea. Don't you think so? \n  I wanna know how the engine warning signal comes. Is anybody out there who can give me same advice as "authorized mazda dealer" can give ?\n\nYoujip Won
That would be the Opel GT, sold in this country from '69 to '73.  It originally\nhad a 1100 cc engine, which was later replaced by the 1900 cc.  It was based\non the old Kadett drive train and suspension, with leaf springs in the rear\nand a single transverse leaf spring in the front.  It looked good, but was\nlimited as a performer.\n\nThere has also been some discussion in this thread about the Manta and other\nmodels.  In 1971 Opel introduced a new line of models, the 1900 series, that\nwere also known as model numbers 51, 57, etc.  These cars had the newer\n1900cc engine and were available as two and four-door coupes, a station wagon,\nand a "sport coupe", known in Europe as the Manta.  At the same time, there\nwere two 30-series cars, which sold very few numbers, that also had the 1900\nengine but the Kadett suspension.  The sport coupe, (model 57) was also\navailable as the Rallye, (57R), with a blacked out hood, tach, and fog lights,\nbut was mechanically the same except for a numerically higher rear end ratio.\n\nIn 1973 the sport coupe was also named the Manta in the US.  1973 was the last\nyear for the GT in any country, both because of the US bumper height regulations\nand the fact that FIAT exercised an option on the factory that Opel was leasing\nto build the GTs.\n\nThe 1900 series continued in 1974 with minor body differences.  In 1975, the\nManta, 1900 sedan (also called the Ascona) and the wagon were available with\nBosch electronic fuel injection.  These cars also had larger brakes and\nwider wheels.  These cars were starting to compete with the 1975 Buick Century\nlow price leader of the time, and were the last Opels imported into the US.\n\nFrom 1976 to 1979, cars that sported Buick/Opel badges were still sold by\nthe Buick dealers, but were rebadged Isuzu I-marks.  The idea was to call them\nOpels instead of changing the dealers' neon signs.\n\nVarious models of the 50-series cars dominated the Showroom Stock racing of the\n70's in their class, and were known as serious 2002-competition.\n\nParts are still available from a number of sources.\n\n(I still have a '73 manta and two '75 sedans and all the trick parts I could\ncollect in 20 years).

Hi,\nI need your help with a problem I have with a 1989 Mitsubishi\nGalant GS transmission.  The car has a 5 speed manual tranmission.\nSince the car was bought new, while shifting from 2nd to 3rd,  unless \nI do it SLOWLY and carefully, it makes a "popping" or "hitting" sound.\nThe dealer and Mitsubishi customer service (reached by an 800 #) say \nthis is NORMAL for the car.  IS IT?\nAnd about a year ago, at 35Kmiles, the stick shift handle got STUCK\nwhile attempting to put it in reverse:\n   1- The shifter would not budge.  The clutch had no effect.\n   2- The front tires would not budge, even when the clutch is\n      fully depressed.\n   3- If the clutch is released the engine would die.\n   4- Assuming that some gear was engaged while the shifter was\n      stuck, I could not make the car move.  It acted as if\n      it were in Neutral(except for dying when clutch is released.)\n   5- I finally was able to release the shifter by having \n      someone rock the car back and forth (less than an inch),\n      while I depressed the clutch and jiggled the shifter.\n   6- The shifter acted normally after that.\n\nWhen this happened, I took it to the dealer, they checked the \nclutch, it was o.k. They checked the transmission, it was o.k.\n\nI had the exact problem a couple of months ago, and again last\nweek.  The dealer says there is nothing they can do because \nMitsubishi (the 800 #) says they have never heard of the\nproblem, and the dealer could not reproduce the problem while\nthey had the car.  \nIn all three occurances, the car was parked head first in a garage,\nand since the front wheels were stuck, the car could not be towed\nto the dealer before releasing the shifter (hence temporarily\nsolving the problem).  And the dealer, and Mitsubishi, refused to\nsend someone to check the car while it was stuck. \nI KNOW there is smething wrong with the transmission (shifting \nfrom 2nd to 3rd), and getting stuck at random, but I can't get \nthe dealer to fix it. I need your help with the mechanical problems, \nand with how to handle Mitsubishi.  \nAll hints and suggestions are greatly appreciated, and sorry to\nbore you with the long post.
Does anyone know how to reset the service indicator of a BMW after changing\nthe oil yourself?\n\nAlso, I have about 3,000 miles on my 525i and so far only one of the five\nyellow service indicators went out. That means I don't need oil service until\nit reach approximatly 15,000 miles which doesn't make sense to me. Any idea?\n\nPS of cause I did my first oil change at 1,200 miles

Usually it works to *your* advantage if \nthey are lower.

Diesels fall into the same emissions mythology as alcohol fuels.  The main reason\nthey are considered "cleaner" is because they are better at the emissions we\nactually measure and regulate.  But they also contribute additional emissions\nwhich have long been determined to be as harmful, but no suitable control or\nlimits have been defined.  \n\nCurrent evidence is pointing to most visible smog actually being diesel emissions\nand suspended particles and less of a photo-chemical reaction.  Diesel particulates\nare now becoming a major concern in decreased lung capacity.  And alcohols emit\nsignifcantly more aldehydes (a known carcinigen) than gasoline.  The evidence\nis mounting that while we have been beating the gasoline engine to death, we may\nhave been ignoring the effects of the alternatives.\n\nAnd anyone who thinks diesels are so great, should go and spend a few hours in\nrush hour traffic in some cities in Europe.  There the stench of the diesels is\nawful and it can even burn the eyes.  \n\nDiesels being clean is only relative to our current standards.
From: nataraja@rtsg.mot.com (Kumaravel Natarajan)\n\n\nThe technology Cummins is applying to diesels to comply with\nthe newer Ca. emissions laws involves three things I know of:\n\n1. All compliant diesels are turbocharged.\n2. All use an "aftercooler", which cools the air which was heated\n   by compression by the turbocharger (up to about 25 PSI).\n3. A gismo on the injector pump which senses the pressurized air\n   intake, and limits full delivery of fuel while the pressure is\n   low.\n\nNo scrubbers, catalytic converters, etc, are used.  The path from\nthe turbocharger to the exhaust outlet is kept very free.\n\nInterestingly, except for the low-pressure fuel limitation, power output \nand mileage are enhanced by these measures.  One can buy aftermarket\nturbos and aftercoolers which generate more power, lots more power,\nand these are approved by the CARB.

Thanx Craig.... in addition to Craigs coments - and to clear up any \nfurther confusion.... the 200SX (of USA) was reffered to as a Silvia Turbo\nin the UK.... performance figures of UK 200SX are:
"traction control" as far as the optional feature that one buys with\ncars is not the same thing at all as a torque sensing differential.\n\na torque sensing differential is a type of LSD, but not all LSD's\nare torque sensing.  viscous coupled differentials (as opposed to\nviscous couplings) are rotational sensing, not torque sensing.\nfor that matter, so are "traction control" systems that use ABS\nsensors and pulse braking.\n\nthen there are the older posi-tracs and whatever which i am not\nfamiliar with the workings.
The last V8 in Mad Max is based on a Holden (Australia). Holden is\nlinked with GM (Vauxhall GB) and so they're quite unlikely to use \nFord parts.
You are sure that what you call a 200SX we call a 240?  Just curious..\nWe also have a nissan predacessor (sp) to the 240 called a 200, which\ncame in turbo and nonturbo.  But i don't think we've ever had a 240\nturbo...just curious...(BTW, I'm in the US, if that matters..)

You guys are correct.  The Bricklin was produced in Canada.\nThe National Museum of Science and Technology here in Ottawa\nhas one, and sometimes they put it on display.  Most of the time,\nit stays in storage because the museum doesn't have much room.\nIt's a big deal for a car to be Canadian and that's why they \nhave it.  If anybody's a fan, they also have a nice green '73\nRiviera that looks like it just came out of the showroom.
just out of curiosity, how is this "dog clutch" any different from a synchro\ntransmission.  What you described SOUNDS the same to me.  In fact, what little\ni've studied on trannies, the instructor referred to the synchros as "dogs"\nand said they were synonymous.  The gears are always meshed in a synchronized\ngearbox, and you slip the synchro gears back and forth by shifting. Or at least,\nthat is what i was taught.  Explain, por favour?
Eve'.\n\nI am looking to buy 4 new p195-50r15 tires.. (R or HR). I don't\nhave much to spend, but I would like a tire that will LAST. Does\nanyone have any experience with the following brands?\n\n	Riken\n	Falken	\n	BFG	\n	General	\n\nThere are others, but these I can find here for under $70.. Like\nI said, I am mostly interested in threadwear then speed, since I\nhardly get to drive them over 80 or 90 mph. Also, is it true that\n"noone will give you warranty on such tires", according to\na tire dealer?\n\nFinally, do HR tires last longer than R tires (threadwear again),\nor is that strictly a speed factor?\n\nThanks for any replies..
I know this is the wrong place to post this, but I couldn't find any\nrelevant newsgroups in my area.\n\nFor those of you who are from PA, where is VASCAR (where the cops\nmeasure your speed from the time it takes you to cross the distance\nbetween two white lines on the road, right?) most commonly used?  I'm\nespecially interested in the Pittsburgh area (specific locations, prior\nexperiences, if possible).  For those PA and non-PA, if they use VASCAR\nin your state, is it most common in rural, city, highway areas, etc. \nWhat I'm interested in mainly is where I can speed with the least risk\nof being caught.  You can always detect radar, but there's no way to\nfight VASCAR unless you know where all the white lines are.\n\nThanks a lot,

Mail bounced, so...\n\n\nTraditional wisdom says you are almost certainly better off selling it \nyourself if you don't mind that extra hassle.  Having a trade-in on a purchase\njust makes getting the best price from a dealership more confusing.\n\n\nI assume this is _retail_ bluebook.  There are two bluebook prices, one for\nretail and one for wholesale.  You really want the retail price if you can \nget it.  The blue books also have adjustments you can make for low mileage\nand extras on your particular car.  You should look all this stuff up yourself.\nAlso keep in mind that the blue book prices are averages over the country\nthat may not apply in your area.  For example, blue book prices are low for\nCalifornia.  A better way of finding out how much your car might be worth is\nto call around and see what it's selling for (if any used lots have one) or\nlooking in local papers for similar cars and checking out the prices.  It \nmight be more time efficient to take a small loss (rather than hold out for\n6 months for the best price).\n\n\nI don't know what you mean by "an acquaintance" but I would make darn sure\nthat I was paid, that is, cashier's check in full before delivery.  There's\na real temptation when selling to a pseudo-friend to be more accomodating\nthan you should.  Make sure you get the money and if they hedge about paying\nin full at the start (with a cashier's check or cash) then I would go\nelsewhere.  Rememeber that you can probably sell your car to a used car lot\nor wholesaler and get wholesale bluebook.  That's probably a safer approach\nthan selling to a private party.\n--
I bought a set of ARE's a few months back and decided to add locks\nso that I could keep my new rims.

Actually the company, and the product was ROVAC - which stood for\nROTary Air Conditioning..it used a rotary compressor with what\nwas effectively an air/air heat exchanger, and worked pretty well.\nThe negatives were mostly that it was about 5-10% less efficient than\nusing freon, and noise problems from the high velocity/pressure air,\nall of which were solved by the time the company went bankrupt.  It\nis still a legal entity in Florida, but I believe completely "dead"..\nand there's a heck of an opurtunity to buy up it's patents and restart\nthe operation...
Hi fellow auto enthusiasts!\n\nDoes anyone have any info on the new 4 valve per cylinder diesels Mercedes\nis working on?

This is kind of interesting.  I always assumed that the 240SX was named\nbecause of the 2.4 liter engine which it uses.  Likewise for the 200SX\nwhich uses a 2.0 liter engine.  Isn't this true?
VW and Mercedes have tinkered with particulate traps.  Also, VW\nuses a kind of turbocharger on their Jetta ECOdiesel that helps\nreduce particulates as well, although I don't know the\nmechanics of it.\n\nMany diesel cars,busses, and trucks in Europe are now being\nequipped with catalysts and traps in an effort to clean up\ndiesel emissions, already well below legal limits anyway.\n\nIt's a shame GM had to soil the diesel's reputation in\npassenger cars and prevent further resource devotion to\nresearch into making this outstandingly efficient engine even\nfurther ahead of gas engines in emissions.
I'd like to hear stories on experiences with the Hyundai Sonata.  I\nknow Consumer Reports has trashed them but the people I know that\nhave them swear by them.  They also haven't had the problems with\nthem that Consumer Reports claims.  I haven't driven one yet.  I\nhave driven a '93 Hyundai Elantra (which Consumer Reports also\ntrashed) and was very impressed with it.  The local Hyundai\ndealership ("no-haggle" policy) is offering an Elantra GLS w/ power\nmoonroof for $13163.  They also have a Sonata base, w/ Sunroof for\n$13997.  I know my preference is for a Sonata GLS w/ sunroof and\n4-spd automatic.  I'll decide which engine I prefer after test\ndriving both the 4-cyl and the V6.  The Sonata is also offering a\n$1500 rebate.  Hmmm, that's another question.  Is the following\nscenario the appropriate manner to handle "negotiation"?\n\n1.  make offer\n2.  subtract rebate from offer\n3.  talk trade\n4.  subtract trade from offer to get final price

I want to thank all the people that responded to my post\na few weeks ago about buying an '86 Chev Nova with over\n100,000 mi.\n\nI decided to buy the car and have had it for about a month.\nI replaced the front brake pads and changed the oil.  So far\nno problems have surfaced.\n\nI received many suggestions and encouragement on this\npurchase and figured a late "thank you" was better than none.\n\nThanks to all!
I agree with Jeff's reply.  I've never changed the brake fluid except when\nhaving a brake job, which is usually at around 80,000 miles (alot of\nfreeway driving).  However, I will start to do this as preventative\nmaintenance on my new car.  Also, there are brake system flushing agents\nthat can be used but the problem is that if any of the agent is left in the\nsystem, it can cause problems, so it's been recommended NOT to use them unless\nyou are 100% certain that you can remove all of the flushing agent.  Just for\nyour info, I was quoted a price of: labor=$29.95 and fluid=$9.95 for\nflushing the brake system; this in conjunction with a break job so I don't\nknow if it was more without the brake job. This is in the S.F Bay Area.
Oh, really. When?\n\n\nThe '93 Mustang Cobra can. Check it out.\n\n\nEhhhh, maybe.

Or the price tag of the RX7 vs. a Mustang? Part of the definition of\na Mustang is that it should be affordable by the masses. Of course\nFord knows youre argument, THEY OWN A BIG PIECE OF MAZDA!

Hello everyone,\n   I have an insurance question.\n\nAllstate insurance\n\nSITUATION: Person wrecks car. Car is drivable to dealer. Person \nreports accident (no other cars involved). Driver estimates damage cost \nexceedes cost of car. Insurance people claim car is "totalled" because of \nexceeding repair costs.\nPerson says "WWHHHAATTTT!!!! But I drove the car here!" and takes it to \nanother place. Other place estimates 2,101.00 in damage. 2,000 less than the \ndealer.\nOne more hitch... The car is registered in Florida but the accident occurred \nin Pennsyvania.\n\nQUESTION: Should the insurance recognize and pay for the damages of this, \nnow fixable, car even though they prematurly declared totalled?\n\nPlease respond via E-Mail if you think you know anything about this sort of \nthing. \n\nchris@camp.wpic.pitt.edu
I don't know about where you are, but here in California false\nrepresentation\nof odometer readings is a criminal felony. If you can substantiate this,\nyou need to report that dealer to the local authorities. You should consult\nwith a lawyer to tell you what civil action you can take as well. Keep in\nmind that you will have to prove that the dealer was aware of the change in\nthe dashboard.
I went to a place called American Car Care Centers to check my car for A/C\nleak.  After "checking", I was told that there is a leak in the compressor\nseal.  At the end, in addition to the labor for the check, I was charged 12\ndollars for a pound of freon, although they evacuated my A/C afterwards\nbecause of the leak.  First, is it fair for him to charge me for a pound of\nfreon ($12 plus tax) ?  Second, what can I do about this if this is unfair ?
gee.... is it 1999 already?\n\nYes, it will still be on the fox program chasis, anything that will be different\non the new car as far as mechanical's is unknown. The suspension will most\nlikely be changed, as well as the drive drain. From what has been printed on\nit, there is no clear idea of what will be done, as some say it will have\nthe modular V8 and others the current small block... just have to wait and see\nAlso is far as styling goes from what I seen is good, a return to tradition.\nC scoop on the sides and roof line much like a '65 or '66 fastback.
Wouldn't you rather have some type of standard "electrical" plug instead of \nthat "fire hazard waiting to happen" adaptor? I know I would, and I would \nalso prefer to have sensibly placed cup holders instead of an ashtray. (my \ncar came with coin holders already built in)
I've found mine ('93 Probe GT) to do quite well.  \n\n[window problem deleted, artical has been trimmed]\n\n\nI've not had any of the air or leakage problems that have been reported but\ndo get the squeal that Bill describes.  I live in Seattle so the wet weather\nmay be a factor.\n\n\nIf I recall correctly I got two keys.\n\n\n\nThis is true.  I'm wondering if this may be a safety concern.  IE, if people\npound on the place where the airbag lives...\n\n\nNo opinion.\n\n\n\nThe 5 speed is much more fun.  We opted for the automatic for a number of\nreasons but it's still fun, and in some ways more practical.\n\n\nDitto.\n\n\nI too would suspect that this may be true.\n\n\n\nYes!\n\n\n\nDitto.\n\n\nAgree. Check it out.  I don't mind it but would say that if it was much \nstiffer it might be a problem.  (How about the '93 R1 RX-7 for suspension?!) \n\n\nTrue.  \n\n\n\nI've had this problem and read about it.  (or at least I assume the one\nI had was the one I read about :-).  In any case what happened was the\nweld between the muffler and the pipe feeding it (ok, so I'm not a mechanic)\nbroke.  In my case the dealer welded it, ordered replacement parts and\nput them on when they got them.  I suspect this is some sort of 1) design\nflaw, or 2) production flaw.  In any case I have an earlier model and would\nexpect it to be worked out on newer ones.  In any case it is a warrantee\nrepair.  (or they get the keys back!)\n\n\n\nI second this.  There seems to be some things that slipped through but the\ncar seems very sound.  While not perfection (what is) you get an awful\nlot for your money.\n\n\nBTW, Bill has a Probe mailing list.  You might want to subscribe to it if \nyou are interested in more detail.  Try request-ford-probe@world.std.com\n(did I get that right?  never can remember if the request goes on the\nfront or the back :-)
I've been in two _major_ auto accidents, both were multiple car.  The worst\nwas a head-on three car collision (T intersection and one person ran a stop\nsign).  In both cases I was stopped and had no place to go (and I saw it\ncoming both times). \n\n\nIf you _really_ want to add safety to _any_ car, simply add a cage to the\ncar.  They are available and cheap (about $500 in the USA).  Add to that\nfour or five or six point belts and you will walk away from collisions that\nwere otherwise not survivable.  but instead of people spending a little\nextra money, we get legislation that says the gov't must mandate a minimal\nlevel of protection for everyone. \n\nOne other significant factor in improving one's own safety is to get some\ntraining.  This will improve your safety more than any other single\ninvestment will.  Drive/ride defensively (and that does not mean you have\nto be a doddering old stick in the mud).  People here tend to enthuse about\nautos more than the average (probably in the top 15th percentile in driving\nability), but still we sometimes overlook the obvious.  I've been to two\ndriving schools, and three riding schools for my motorcycle.  A very\nworthwhile investment (and besides, it was a lot of fun too ;-). \n\nSafety is what you make of it, just because a carmaker doesn't provide you\nwith an adequate level of protection doesn't mean you have to leave it go at\nthat.
if you want to annoy geico, call them up...give fake name...but real car \nspecs..get a quote and then tell them they are more expensive than your \ncurrent state farm/allstate insurance.  they will still send you quote etc.\nthen you can tear up their quote and stuff it in the prepaid return \nenvelope and mail it back to them.  actually they were $12 more than my current\nstate farm rates.
Limited Tort Option will lower your rates. If you choose it, you can't\nsue others for pain & suffering, but you still can sue for economic loss.\nSo you can sue for your wrecked car and for medical bills, but you can't\nsue for $1000000 for pain and suffering.\n\nAt least, that's how I understand it.
Save youself the cash.  Take it from a BMW mechanic.  Idiot lights are for just that.  Buy yourself a ballpoint pen and write it down yourself.  Change your oil every 3000 mi. and you will be just fine.
re: extended Ka bands.\n\nI recently bought a 2 band detector.  You guys must all think I'm\nnuts, right?  Well, I did a little research into Ka usage in this\narea and found out that Ka is not currently being used in this state\nas well as surrounding states.  Here's how I found out:\n\n- A cop friend who did spend time nailing speeders doesn't even know \n  what Ka is.  He's heard of K, which is what they use here and I\n  explained that Ka is used for photo radar etc.. He then said, yeah,\n  "Ka stands for K automatic"... duuhh.  He then went on to say that\n  plans were being made for getting laser guns as far as going high\n  tech were concerned, but he didn't know too much.\n\n- My 8 year old 2 band whistler was consistently going off at speed traps,\n  even the real sneaky ones.\n\n- When I called the Escort Shop, they confirmed that Ka is not used here\n  or in surrounding states.  They did claim that Laser was being used\n  a lot here, which I was quite skeptical of.\n\nSo in the end, instead of spending a lot of money and/or waiting\nmonths for a state of the art detector, I got a low priced, high\nperformance 2 band Escort 2200.  Incidentally its performance is equal\nto their top of the line model in X and K band detection.  I know that\nEscort has been surpassed by other brands lately, but I've never fully\nrelied on a detector and I was convinced that the Escorts would be at\nleast quite good, which was good enough for me and my wallet.
R. Goldstein (rdg@world.std.com) sez:\n: As the subject says, I am moving from Mass. to Calif. and will be driving\n: mostly on Interstate 80.\n: Any advice from folks who have done it before?\n\n- Plan your gas stops in major-city areas to avoid the 25 cent-per-gallon\n"only gas station for 50 miles and you're an out-of-towner" surcharge.\n\n- Prepare your car.  Don't forget things like your fuel & air filters.  If\nyou're loading your car up, consider putting your spare on TOP of your stuff\njust in case of a flat.  In my x-country trip, a tire disintegrated in the\nCalifornia desert & it took me 20 minutes to unload all my stuff to get to\nthe tire.\n\n- If you have a hatchback, cover all your stuff with a white bedsheet to help\nkeep the stuff and your car cool, as well as *possibly* avoiding theft.\n\n- McDonalds have good, clean bathrooms.\n\n- invest in a $30 CB & magnetic roof antenna.  It may help if you're stranded,\nand you can always ask people for places to stop for food, etc.\n\n- Many times police like to hang out in the 1st 10 miles after you enter a\nnew state, to catch all the speeders who have "escaped" the previous state.\n\n- Same as above; when you enter a 55mph city zone after hours and hours of\n65mph rural interstate\n\n-=$>Dave<$=-

Well, an LT1 Blazer wouldn't come close to a GMC Typhoon in speed, I think its\ntoo heavy.  As it is right now, the normal 210HP 5.7 engine has plenty of \npower for a full size Blazer.  Of course, I'm not saying GM shouldn't put the\nLT1 in it :).  It seems like they have a real winner with that engine.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nAgreed!  I own a Mercury Villager and I'm very impressed with the V6 and\nthe AT.  In the past, I've been biased towards manual/standard transmissions(I owned\nan Aerostar with a 5-speed, it was awesome!), but settled with the AT in the\nVillager and have been pleasantly surprised with it's performance.\n \nBTW, Consumers Report in their report on the Villager, alluded to some\nfunny noises from the AT, I've been listening for them but haven't noticed anything\nunusual.\n \n-Chris\n\n\nChristopher J.

The Bricklin was a car manufactured by a company started by Malcolm\nBricklin, who, I believe, was Canadian.  He was the first one to import\nSubarus, and later was responsible for importing Yugos, I believe. \nAnyway, he had this idea that what would really sell would be a sports\ncar, but one incorporating a bunch of innovative safety features.  The\nBricklin was built to be that queerest of beasts, the safety sports car.\n If any of you remember the early 70s movement among car makers to\ndesign "experimental" safety cars, you will recognize the general\nappearance of the Bricklin - big 'ol bumpers, etc.  Anyone recall other\nsafety features?  The engine was an american v-8, Ford I think is right.\n\nPersonally, I kinda like the way they look, and if I remember from the\nold magazine articles, the performance was only half-bad.  The choice of\ncolors, though, tended towards the 1970s lime green - yech - but highly\nvisible, I suppose.  \n\nThe Delorean, on the other hand, was a dog - nice looking (IMO) but no\nmotor at all.  \nDan\ndh3q@andrew.cmu.edu\nCarnegie Mellon University\nApplied History
I believe the interstates were origionally funded as part of a national \ndefense plan etc.  The  requirements were to move heavy army trucks at \n70mph.\n\nStill its amazing in Germany you can have cars traveling 155 mph and 65 mph \non the same 3 to 4 lane road.  Around Washington DC they can't keep traffic \nflowing at 55.

Just a quick, simple question really...\n\n	How many wheels are affected by the emergency brake on an '86 Nissan\nMaxima. I've heard that all four are affected, but this would seem unusual\nto me.

QUESTION: what's your experience with car wash wax?\n\nThis is the liquid type of wax in bottles that you pour it in\nwater, sponge it on you car, hose it off, and dry it with cloth.\nMany people have used it.

Does it have any negative effects to car\npaint?\n\nCan you forward your reply directly to my email id? Thanks.
I have had my Probe looked at twice by my local dealer (where I purchased\nthe car) ... the first time, they made this problem worse.  The second time,\nafter advising them of the service bulletin mentioned on my ford-probe mailing\nlist (they said they didn't know of the bulletin), they adjusted the window and\nmade it *much* better.  However it now makes a "scritch scritch" noise on rough\nroads, and *still* squeals when I open/close the window in wet weather (anyone\nelses's do this?)\n\n\nI got two keys with my car, but only ONE remote-entry push-button thingie!\nBut then, I bought my 93 with 2500 miles, and  I think it may have been a\nrepossession ... so I'm not surprised something was missing :-(\n\n\nI am seriously considering following the advice in the owners manual where\nit describes the procedure to follow if "you discover something on your Ford\nthat could ... cause ... serious injury ... threaten lives ... etc).  Something\nabout notifying the National Traffic Safety group as well as Ford.  Those little\n"you've-got-to-position-the-fingers-perfectly-to-make-it-beep" buttons are\nTERRIBLE.\n\nWell, I guess that's good in a way, but in a way it's bad.  When someone\nhears that kind of horn, they expect to see a big American car.  They may\nnot associate the sound with a small "jap car" style car (like the Probe is).\n\n\nThe mudflaps help a lot.\n\n\nI have always been a 5-speed guy.  Almost every car I've ever owned has been\na 5-speed.  Because I got a good deal on this car with the 2500 miles, I\n(knowingly) overlooked the fact that it has an automatic.  But it is a pretty\nhigh-tech automatic.  It is a fully electronicaly controlled 4-speed with\ntorque converter lockup.  Even with the automatic, I'm getting 35 mpg on the\nhighway, driving 65-70!.    (but of course driving > 65 is illegal, so I \nprobably made that sentence up).  :-)     Around town the mileage has been\naround 25-27, not bad for an automatic.   Of course it doesn't have the\n"control" of a 5-speed, but since I do a lot of city driving, it turns out\nto be very convenient.  It's nice to be able to drink a cup of coffee and\ndrive at the same time (although that, too, is illegal here in \n"we-like-to-control-your-life Massachusetts" :-)\n\n\n\nShakes and rattles has been my main gripe.  I've gotten them to fix the\nworst of them, but I fear that with the rather harsh ride, the car will\nbe a virtual potpouri of rattles when it gets older.\n\n\nOn my 89 Probe GL, I got about 40K out of the original Goodyears,\nand had driven the replacement tires (Bridgestone) 50K miles when\nI tradeed the car.  The 195/65(60?)VR14 Firestones on my 93 Probe\nlook like they're designed for performance (ie rather wide, shallow\ntread, etc), so they probably won't last as long.  But the car handles\nvery very very well.  It sticks to the road like glue, even on a rough\nsurface.\n\n\nDefinitely.  Ford/Mazda did a very very nice job on this one.  The\ncar has a "much more expensive than it actually is" look and feel to it.\n\n\nHaving driven an 89 Probe for 4 years, I find the 93 suspension "interesting".\nThe car actually drives much better than the 89 ... it is a very firm\nride, and you definitely know about each and every bump in the road.  Yet\nthe car remains very civilized on even the bumpiest roads.  You Hear and\nfeel the bumps, yet the car retains its posture very well.\n\n\nWell I wouldn't encourage passenger-carrying in the Probe unless the\nperson in the front seat likes to sit with his knees to the dash.  As\nmentioned in the Consumer Reports write-ups, "consider the back seat\nas a parcel shelf".  No biggie to me though (if it had been, I'd not\nhave bought the car!  (but it's definitely not a family car)).\n\n\nA/C is a MUST on any Probe from 89 - 93.  The 93 in particular sends out\na REAL BLAST of cool air when the AC is on MAX.  That "lots of glass" you\nmentioned is what gives the car the "very good visibility" reports you\nsee in all the write-ups.  Most "sports/sporty" cars don't have that\ngood visibility.\n\n\nThe complaints I've heard re: exhaust system (on 93's) have been on \nthe GT.  Of course being a different engine, that is a differeent \nexhaust system.\n\nI was one of those with an 89 who qualified for the free replacement.\nSince I had already replaced the muffler when I received the notice, \nI was/am due a refund from Ford.  I applied in February and am Still\nwaiting.   :-(\n\n\nYes.  I was pretty amazed when I had my car in for some touch-up\nadjustments this past week, and they had to keep it overnight (too busy\nfor them to get to it) and they offered to pay for a rental).  They \ndid make me pay for taxes and insurance though :-(\n\n\nI have to agree that they seem to have some QC problesm.  But I seriously\nfeel the car design is sound, and expect it to do very well.
I still can't understand all the hype about the Impalla SS, it STILL has\nthe ugly Caprice body (Orca on wheels).  The Caprice was the worst new\nbody style to come out of Detroit EVER! Now just because the LT1 engine\nand a few suspension tweeks are being added.\n\nIts STILL UGLY, its STILL a BARGE.  GM's answer to everything is "throw in\na V8 and someone will buy it."  Or "add some plastic ground affects\nand a few stickers and call it a GT, GTZ or SS, and someone will buy it."\n\nIMHO GM needs to scrap the Caprice body COMPLETELY and start over with a\nBLANK sheet of paper.  No minor modification (wheel well treatments, tail\namp modification, or nose re-design or even the LT1 engine) will help\nthe existing Caprice.

Because some people like them (and some people actually need them).\n\n\nYeah, right. Real muscle cars had a manual transmission, and their\nclutches aren't that heavy. Shelby-American used plenty of\nhigh-powered, high-torque engines, and Carroll only put autos in\nhis cars because people wanted them. (Blasphemers! Heretics!\nBurn them, burn them for defiling a Shelby with an auto! ;-)\nReal Cobras (and they were the ultimate sports car at the\ntime) had big-block Fords which turned out prodigious amounts\nof power and torque, and _none_ of them had automatics. \n\n\nYeah, if you call a gear shift in the middle of a curve "fun." :-)\n\nI personally would _love_ to have a '66 Galaxie 500 7-Liter Coupe,\nwith a fire-breathing 427 and four-onna-floor (to go along side\nmy '66 Galaxie 500 pillarless hardtop with a fire-breathing 390\nwith three-onna-tree; I love the sound of dual exhaust in the\nmorning! :-). There's no comparison between a REAL American\nMuscle Car and a car with a big engine and an automatic, IMHO. \n\n				James

What you described SOUNDS the same to me.  In fact, what little\n& i've studied on trannies, the instructor referred to the synchros as "dogs"\n& and said they were synonymous.  The gears are always meshed in a synchronized\n& gearbox, and you slip the synchro gears back and forth by shifting. Or at least,\n& that is what i was taught.  Explain, por favour?\n\nMotorcycle transmissions don't have synchros.  The engagment dogs are very\ncorse and sloppy.  There are maybe 6-10 teeth (dogs) on the side of the\ngears that engage the next gear over as the forks slide the gears back\nand forth.  To shift:  start to apply pressure at the same time the\nclutch is pulled (the clutch is a hand lever) and shift quickly.  If \nyou try a slow lazy shift it will grind, you just have to pop it into\nthe next gear before it has a chance to grind.  There isn't a neutral\nbetween gears (obviously there is, but you can't select it with the\nshifter) so double clutching is not a possibility.  "speed shifting"\n(which is what I have always heard "clutchless shifting" called) works\npretty well for upshifts with some practice, but I usually use the\nclutch-especially for the lower gears.\n\nI think auto (as in automobile) trannys are similar, except that the\nengagment dogs are very fine, with no slop.  And the addition of\nsyncho rings.  The gear teeth are always engaged in auto transmissions\nthat are synchronized, but may not be in non-synchro gears (reverse\nand sometimes first).
I purchased a used 1988 Nissan 300ZX (non-turbo) last year.  I had a \nquestion on gear/rpm ratios.  Right now in 5th @65mph I'm at \n2600-2700 rpms.  @70mph I'm at about 2900rpms.  Is this about the\nnorm?  I'm an auto neophyte so I'm just wondering if these are\nthe proper ranges?  Somehow the rpm figures seem high.  A friend of mine\njust told me he can hit 60mph in 3rd on his 88 Chevy Beretta (2.8l V6.)\nAlso, anyone know the top speed attainable (@redline???) for this model Z?\n(Not that I would try it but it would be an interesting factoid. :)\n \n				Thanx!\n					Derek
Having driven both, and having owned an SC300 for 14 months now, all I can\nsay is "it depends".  They're both great cars.  In fact, my wife and I\nare saving our pennies so we can get her the 300ZX convertible in a year.\nThe 300ZX handles like a dream, while the SC300 rides like a dream.\nFit and finish on both are excellent, but the Lexus gets the nod in\ncustomer satisfaction.  They're both very attractive, and hideously\nexpensive.  The resale value of the SC is better than the ZX.  The\n300ZX isn't available with traction control, which makes it a handful\non slippery surfaces.

I've had a Valentine for about 9 months now and I agree that it is the best det\nector available. The point here is trust and reliability. I've been able to "tr\nust" the Valentine more than any other detector I've owend. If the Valentine sa\nys that there is a moderate to strong radar source in front of me, then it's mo\nre than likely to be a speed trap. With my other detectors, I've gotten so many\n falses that I've begun to ignore someo of the warnings because I didn't want t\no drive like I had one foot on the brake and one on the gas pedal.\n\nThat directional indicator really, really helps. Plus, more info is almost alwa\nys better than less info. No matter how smart radar detectors get, the human br\nain is usually smarter. So, if I'm going to make a decisio based on information\n at hand, I want all the info I can get. Plus, if you divide the overall streng\nth of the radar signal by the number of bogeys reported, you'll find that each\nbogey is pretty weak and therefore not a radar threat. With other detectors, yo\nu'll just get one strong warning. My logic may be faulty on this, but I think i\nt works okay.\n\nAlthough, I must admit that I haven't really noticed the reflection problem of\none radar souce.
who cares about typos of these meaningless, synthetic names?  if the\ncars were named after a person, e.g. honda, i'd be more respectful.\n\n\nwrong!  the GS300 and SC300 use straight sixes, while the ES300 uses a\nV6.  only a giant like toyota can afford to have both a V6 and inline\n6 in its lineup, but that won't last for long.
s:\n\n\nAhhh yes, Andrew, we meet again...\n\n...no, not 'stealing' the oil, just draining it as to leave me stranded.\n\n\nLet me guess, you're from Hudson Ohio??\n\n\nGet out and see the world.\n\n\n"IF" I were the vandal, and I really hated someone, maybe someone who knew\nsomething about cars, of course I would look for ANY types of valves I could\nundo.  Especially, special oil drain plugs, and radiator petcocks.\n\nAs well as putting bad things in the gas...\n\nWhile I would never vandalize someone's car, IF I were to, it would probably\nbe the 'time bomb' approach, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks\nthat way...
This really bugs me.  The emissions of diesels are the cleanest of any vechicle,\nbut they are considered so polluting that they are banned in passenger cars\nin California.  What a bunch of crap.  Diesel is the fuel of choice for \nenviromental benefit in Europe while here it's illegal for the same reason.\n\nThe particulates are nothing but carbon.  They are just an annoyance at worst.\nNothing beats the diesel cycle for efficiency and emissions, torque or engine\ndurability.  It's also cheaper.
I'm certainly no engineer and really have no scientific basis\non which to make this argument, but don't you answer your own\nquestion?  Is the reflected signal "shifted" at all from the\nact of being reflected?  If so, wouldn't it then be easy for\nthe detector to discriminate between reflections and direct\nsources?
Just to clear things up (as to why I posted the question that way)...\nI was debating with a co-worker about diesels.  I claimed they were\ncleaner-burning than gas engines.  He said the extra "junk" put out by them\nwas offset by the savings in greenhouse gasses.   I made all the SAME claims\nyou did.  But, one question of his was what about the carbon?  I said it\nwas harmless, but he wanted to know how to get rid of it.  I suggested\nscrubbers.  (I figured it would be no harder or more expensive to install\nthan "cats".)  Does there exist any designs for a scrubber?  (I'd like\nto know just to answer his final question.)  I convinced him that diesels\nare cleaner otherwise.\n\nBTW, (I named my subject "Dirty Diesels" because I knew it would get a reaction\nout of people who knew they were cleaner than gas engines and that they'd\nread it...)\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-- Vel Natarajan  nataraja@rtsg.mot.com  Motorola Cellular, Arlington Hts IL  --

My son is considering the purchase of a 71 MGB, which has been substantially\nrestored.  The odometer has rolled over, but we can't be sure of the actual\nmileage.  The engine and drive train apparently weren't touched in the\nrestoration, except for a new carb and a few hoses.  He plans to do vacuum and\ncompression checks to see what they might tell us about the engine.  The body\nand undercarriage have no visible rust, the interior is new, as are tires,\nfront brakes (not sure about the back), battery, bumpers and other misc parts.\nThe paint is checked in a few places, and scuffed here and there, allegedly by\na wind-blown car cover.  It seemed to handle OK, except for soft front shocks.\nQuestions:\n\nAre there problem areas common to MGBs we should check out?\n\nThe brakes seem soft and rather ineffective; what should we expect in the way\nof braking action?\n\nIt seemed to be "doggy" when accelerating from a stop.  What should we expect\nit to do, given the 4-cylinder engine?\n\nThe top is in place, but will not reach a number of the snaps.  The weather\nwas cold.  Should the vinyl stretch and fit when it warms up, or is it forever\nshrunk?\n\nIs it normal for the wire wheels to be painted, or are they usually chromed?\n\nGiven this rather limited description, what would be a reasonable price?\n\nGee, this turned out to be a little long--sorry.

In my opinion, the limited tort option is the best thing Casey has ever\ndone. Basically, limited tort means that you give up your right to sue\nfor pain and suffering, unless one of the following conditions is met:\n1. Your medical bills resulting from the accident exceed $X (where X is\nsome number like 50,000 -- I'm not sure of the exact number)\n\n2. The accident was caused by a drunk driver (I mean, the OTHER driver\nwas drunk)\n\n3. You get a good lawyer and have a good case (basically, you can appeal\nto regain your right to sue, but there's almost no chance of this ever\nhappening).\n\nYou are only giving up your right to sue for pain and suffering; you can\nstill sue for medical costs, actual damages, etc. By agreeing to limited\ntort, you are essentially giving up your right to be an asshole who\ntreats every accident as an entry into the litigation lottery. In\nexchange, you get a substantial reduction in your rates. I save\n$150/year.

folks,\n\ni am going to be purchasing a new vehicle in the next few months.  i\nam trying to hold out until the fall since i have heard that i can\nbe in a better negotiating position to purchase a '93 right when the\n'94s are coming out.  i need something that can comfortably carry\n2 adults, 2 kids in car seats, and 2 60-pound dogs.  i can probably\nafford something in the 14k-16k range.  i am interested in the SUV's\nbut am not sure there are any that are decent which i can afford.\ni think the ford explorer got good reviews from consumer reports but\nis above my $$$ range.  the isuzu rodeo is probably in my price range\nbut i think consumer reports gave it a big thumbs down.  can anyone\noffer any suggestions?  i am hoping for something a little more hip\nthan the traditional wagon, and the SUVs look like fun (we do a lot of\ncamping too).

I don't have any written data but I know what I have experienced.  I use  \nS-50 in everything including my lawnmowers.  In my car it smoothed the idle\nand reduced the operating temp by 5 degrees.  I havent used it long enough \nto test for wear, but some people I know have.   \n A farmer that lives near by used to have to overhaul his big deisel tractors\nat least every other year if not every year.  Since he has been using S-50\nhe has went 5 years without an overhaul.\n\nAlso a friend at a machine shop has in the past rebuilt engines with 200K\nmiles on them because the coustomer thought it was time.  These coustomers\nhad ran S-50 since almost new.  It was found when measuring the internals\nof the engine that they showed only about the amount of wear that would be\nexpected of 30K miles not 200K.
I'll pick up that PM and have a look -- maybe the picture in there is not\nthe actual car, but a prototype?\n\nI saw the Mach III and was not all that impressed -- it looked WAY too\nJapanese for me... the tear drop headlights reminded me of a Nissan NX...\n\nGlad I didn't hold out for the '94 and bought a '93.  Maybe they'll work on\nthe design a little bit, listen to consumers and come out with nice-looking\n'95 or '96.  It always takes a while to work out the kinks in a new design,\ne.g. the F-body Camaro/Firebirds (btw, the new Camaros look like shit too).\n-- \nKeath Milligan, Software Engineer, VideoTelecom Corporation, Austin, Texas\njkm@vtel.com, reaper@wixer.bga.com
Hey all,\n\n\nI'm looking at buying a new car, but I'm confused about the insurance\ncoverage.  This also applies to my existing car insurance policy.  Does\nanyone understand what the "Limited Tort Option" means.  Will it lower\nmy rates if I opt to have it, or will it be more expensive if I opt\nto have it?  What does it do for me (in layman's terms please)?  Is\nit a good deal or should I ignore it?  I'm not the type to sue anyone\nat a drop of the hat nor am I the type to report every little ding to\nthe insurance company as a vandalism claim.  Please help.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance.
Seems to me that I heard that some early Saabs were 2 cycle V4's.\n   Then again, who could possibly care ?>
i think those with 1.6 MR2's would describe the engine as sweet if a\nlittle loud, those with 2.2 MR2's i can't imagine any unbiased person\npaying it any compliments.  sounded like my ex-dormmate's rusty chevy\nchevette.  with the 1.6 i would want to redline it just for the music,\nwith the 2.2 i would short shift so that it would shut up..  the new\ncamry 2.2 features balance shafts.  i guess since the mr2 is getting\nthe axe, it is too late for them to do anything about this..\n\nit is no mystery that the turbo mr2 is "only" 2 liters.. the engineers\nhad enough integrity to prevent any further abuses.  also, in europe\nthe MR2 Mk2 non-turbo was also "only" 2 liters.. as usual, the\nundiscriminating american market (if it is japanese it *must* be good)\ngets the dogs.. to be fair, we also got the turbo, which the europeans\ndid not.
Not only the Sonett (correct spelling), but the 95 wagon and 96 sedan\nused a 1500 cc or 1700 cc V-4 from Ford of Germany.  This particular\nmotor had a 60 degree vee angle, a balance shaft and siamesed exhaust\nports.  This motor was later stretched into the V-6 commonly seen in the\nCapri.\n\nThe V-4 could make pretty reasonable power for its size.  But in the\nSaab, it made too much torque for the transmission, which had been\ndesigned for a 3-cylinder 2-stroke.\n\n -- Chuck Fry, former Sonett III owner
If a manual transmission is a "must have", then the M-B 300TE is not in\nthe running.  You cannot get a manual transmission in that car in North\nAmerica.  It seems that buyers here (or, maybe more accurately, the\ndistributors) are not interested in manual trannies.\n\nThe '93 300 line comes with a 217 hp engine.  All earlier years are 177 hp.\nI have an '87 300E, with a "mere" 177 hp and auto tranny, and I find that\nit has sufficient power for any normal driving situation.  More is always\nnice, but I can't complain.\n\nI test drove a Saab 900 CSE last fall.  Here are my impressions:\n\n1) Awesome power, especially over 3500rpm, when the turbo really comes on.\n2) If you get on the power really hard in a tight corner, the front-wheel\n   drive causes it to understeer heavily, and then viciously "hook" into\n   the corner.  Not a desirable handling trait, but common in powerful\n   front drive cars.  (The CSE is 200hp.  Mercedes is rear-drive, so it\n   does not have this problem.)\n3) Huge interior and cargo space.\n4) The most "rubbery" shifter I have ever encountered.  I drove a 5spd.  It\n   was absolutely numb.  You might be able to get used to it - I don't know.\n   I also didn't like its location, which was too far down, and too far right.\n   From the shifter's position, I got the impression that Saab really designed\n   the car for an automatic.\n5) It was rather noisy:  Engine buzz, rattles, and creaks.  (Mercedes does\n   not exhibit these characteristics.)\n\nYou should also check out the new BMW 525 "touring".  This is a wagon version\nof the 525i.  It fits into the class with the 300TE and Saabs.
Whoa!  Watch your terminology.  "Dealer invoice" is *not* "dealer cost".\nYou'll hear lots of ads screaming "two dollars over dealer invoice!!!"\nSounds like a real deal, huh?  No.  You know what the "dealer invoice"\n(also called factory invoice) is?  It's a piece of paper with numbers\non it that the factory sends the dealer.  What do the numbers\nsignify?  Absolutely nothing.  It's a marketing gimmick that the\nsalesman can wave in your face to impress you.  Note that nowhere\non the "invoice" does it claim to be the real price of the car, and\nmost ads which mention dealer invoice will end with a very fast,\nlow voice saying something like "invoice may not reflect actual\ndealer cost".  Actually, I *guarantee* it does not reflect actual\ndealer cost.
A mileage chart should be available in the book.  It usually goes by\nthe class of car you own and year.  Usually you will end up adding a few\nhundred dollars to the retail price or subtracting it...  Consumer\nReports also has a number you can call and get a quote for your area.\nA friend of mine used it, and was quite happy with the service.  I\nbelieve it cost about $10.00.
Review of 1989 Ford Taurus SHO -- By Gene Kim\n=============================================\n\nBackground:\n\n    Last week, I bought a 1989 Ford Taurus SHO, moving up from driving\na 1987 Toyota Celica ST and a 1975 Oldsmobile Cutlass.  I have been\ninterested in buying a SHO for about five months and have been combing\nthe classifieds in Denver and Chicago every week.  I bought a\nremarkably clean maroon/red SHO with 92K miles on it for $6800.\nAs far as I can tell, this is about $2000 under Blue Book and I still\nhave another 8000 miles before the Extended Service Plan runs out.\n\n    As one should with any pre-1991 SHOs, I made sure that the car was\nalready refit with the upgraded clutch and pressure plate, as well as\nhaving been recalled for upgraded rotors and seatbelt attachments.\nHowever, my SHO does not have the newer rod shifter -- I understand I\ncan get this for $230 from any Ford service center.  In addition, the\ncar received the full tune-up at 60K miles, receiving new platinum\nplugs and valve adjustment.\n\n    For a car with 92K miles on it, the car was virtually immaculate.\nThe clearcoat paint job was devoid of any large chips or dents,\nalthough the front air-dam/molding was covered with lots of small\nscratches -- not surprising since most of the miles were spent on the\nhighway.\n\n    Having driven a smaller two-door coupe for so long, I was a bit\nconcerned about whether I could get used to driving a larger car.  To\nmy surprise, the size of the car doesn't bother me at all -- it seems\njust as nimble as my Celica!  (No comparisons with my Oldsmobile.  :-)\nVisibility from the driver's seat is excellent, helped mostly by of\nthe small the quarter-windows, aft of the back-seat door windows and\nin front of the C-pillar and rear window.  Parallel parking is a bit\nmore difficult, but other than that, I love the size.\n\n    In fact, I'm starting to appreciate the large trunk as I pack up\nfor a 14-hour drive to Washington, DC for the summer.  More on the\nride later in this review.\n\n\nEngine:\n    \n    As with anyone even slightly interested in SHOs, I was very\ninterested in the 24-valve 3.0L Yamaha "Shogun" engine.  I was not\ndisappointed.  Base performance of the engine under 4000 rpms is\ngood.  You can even do reasonable launches from second gear, although\nI don't make a practice of this.  The engine revs smoothly and eagerly\n-- tooling around town does not require many shifts.  This is good\nsince the shifter is definitely one of the weakest points of the car.\n(More on this later.)\n\n    While the performance of the engine under 4000 rpms may be\nunremarkable, it undergoes a Jekyll/Hyde transformation once you hit\nhigher revs.  At 4500 rpms, a butterfly valve opens and you can\nliterally hear and feel the geometry of the engine changing as twelve\nmore valves open up.  The engine soars to its 7000 rpm redline, and\nyou are treated to, in my opinion, the sweetest sounding V6 around.\nThe engine inexplicably sounds OVERJOYED to be at 6500 rpm!\n\n    I've noticed that when I drive around town, I constantly watch the\ntach to see how far below 4000 rpm I am.  To go from 2000 rpm to 4000,\nyou may have to punch the accelerator -- while torque is more than\nadequate, it doesn't come fully online until those other 12 valves\nare used.\n\n\nTransmission:\n\n    When _Car and Driver_ first reviewed the car in 1988, they\nmarvelled at how Ford had put such a wimpy clutch and balky shifter\ninto the car.  I remember driving a friend's parent's SHO in 1990, and\nremember thinking about whether I had the leg strength to drive the\ncar in traffic -- the clutch was that stiff.  That was back then.\n\n    The entire clutch assembly on my SHO has been replaced under a\nFord recall in 1991.  The clutch on the SHO feels no stiffer than the\none on my Toyota Celica.  In fact, the friction point seems a bit\nlarger and more forgiving.\n\n    When playing with the shifter with the car parked, the shifter\nfelt very reasonable.  The 1-2 and 3-4 gates were where you'd expect\nit to be, and the shifting action was smooth.  On the road, it's\nmuch the same -- but you have to shift SLOWLY!  Make no mistake, it's\na clumsy shifter.\n\n    When hurrying shifts, like when I was initially trying to impress\nfriends, I consistently miss the 1-2 shift, often grope clumsily for\nthe 2-3 shift, and sometimes even muff the 3-4 shift.  I find this\npretty amazing in a car like this.\n\n    It also took me several days to realize that you get the smoothest\nshifts when you take your time.  Seems obvious, but compared to my\nToyota and my friend's Honda, this seems atrocious and clumsy.\nSomeone on rec.autos noted that CRXs should blow SHOs off-the-line\nbecause of the incredibly clumsy shifter.\n\n    I now shift much more sedately, and the shifter seems more\nreasonable.  When you play within these bounds, the shifter works\nsmoothly with no surprises.  I don't know whether the rod shifter\nupgrade would help at all.\n\n    Along these same lines, I initially had trouble shifting gears\nsmoothly.  Again, slowing down the shifts and taking more care to\nmatch revs when letting out the clutch helped immensely.  This took\nseveral days for me to get the hang of.  (I think some of my problems\nwere because I've never had a car with enough power to balk at bad\nshifts in higher gears.)\n\n    Occasionally, I have trouble shifting into reverse.  The shifter\nrefuses to enter the gate, and I often grind the synchros trying to \nget it into gear.  I'll be watching this carefully in the next couple\nof months.\n\n    A quirk:  When I upshift and the engine drops back to 1000-2500\nrpm, I hear a whirring and then a grinding noise coming from the the\nengine compartment.  Not terribly loud, but the passenger can\ndefinitely hear it.  I asked about it when I was looking at the car,\nas do all my passengers.  Apparently, this is a definitely a "SHO\nsound" and is the gearbox -- apparently called "gear rollover".\nReplies to my queries on rec.autos are at the end of this review.\n\n\nExterior:\n\n    As I mentioned before, I am astounded by how well the body of this\nSHO has stood up.  Paint chipping on the front bumper and grille are\nvirtually non-existent.  Looking at how older Tauri sometimes\ndon't age so gracefully, I wonder what the guys at Ford did\ndifferently to the SHO bodies.\n\n    The body, in my opinion, is extremely attractive with matching\ncolor body moldings than the stock Tauri.  For some odd reason, the\nSHO seems different enough from vanilla Tauri to get stares at\nstoplights -- of course, this could be my overactive imagination.\n:-)  SHOs get fog lights, a more open grille, a completely\nmonochromatic exterior, and a deeper ground skirt in the back with\n"SHO" stenciled in relief.  I've seen a couple SHOs whose owners have\ncolored these in with florescent colors or in black.  Yuck.\n\n    I don't think the car is flashy.  I like it that way.  I feel\nalmost anonymous with all those Tauri out there, but different and\ndistinctive enough to those of us who care.  :-)\n\n\nInterior:\n\n    The interior is what really makes me feel like I don't deserve the\ncar.  The seats are grey leather, the steering wheel and shifter are\ncovered with black leather, and the entire instrument panel is done in\na black/grey/metallic scheme.  \n\n    The instrumentation is stock Taurus, except for the 140 mph speedo\nand 8000 rpm tach.  You get a center console with two cupholders, a\nlarge compartment under the radio (great for a CD player), an armrest\nthat contains yet another compartment, three appropriately sized coin\nholders for tollways (I think), and a compartment for holding\ncassette tapes.  There's map-holders in the doors, and an oddly small\nglove compartment.\n\n    I spilled a whole can of Coke in the cupholder and was delighted\nto find that the entire rubber holder can be removed and washed in a\nsink.  Hey, I'm really impressed with the ergonomics and\nthoughtfulness that went into its design.  And it's a 1989, before the\ninterior was upgraded!\n\n    The backseat is bigger than any car I've had.  Why do they need so\nmuch space?  :-)  (No smart-ass comments, please.  :-)\n\n    The driver and passenger seat have lumbar and side bolsters.  From\nwhat I hear, it's not uncommon for the side bolsters to show wear.\nMine is no exception.  The left side bolster on the driver's has\ncracked and I'm not convinced the right bolster is inflating all the\nway.\n\n    A big surprise for me:  I forgot that SHOs don't have a normal\nhand parking brake.  Instead, they have the regular parking brake that\nyou press with your left foot.  Too bad.  Again, I'm getting used to\nit, but it seems a bit anachronistic to me.\n\n\nRide:\n\n    The suspension is nice and stiff.  Too stiff?  It's stiffer than\nany car I've had.  A friend's new 1993 Toyota Celica ST seems tauter\nand is still able to soak up bumps better.  The SHO seems stiffer with\nless ability to soak up bumps.  Driving over railroad tracks is a\nnoisy and jarring affair.  On the other hand, taking turns feels\nwonderful because the body is so rigid and doesn't flex at all -- I\nlistened for that before I bought the car.\n\n    On the highway, the ride is great.  When I drove the car from\nChicago back to Purdue, I had trouble keeping under 85 mph, let alone\nfrom trying to see what 100 mph really feels like.  It's a relatively\nquiet ride, but the sunroof rattles.  I've tried to find out what\nexactly makes all the noise up there, but it seems to be the window\nthat rests on the rails.  No easy way to get rid of it, I think.\n\n    Over the past three days, I've oscillated between thinking the\nsuspension is wonderful and perfect and thinking that the ride is way\ntoo rough.  (Not for me, mind you.  But I wonder whether I would\nadvise my dad to buy one for himself.)  But, I've discovered, as with\nthe shifter, if you take your time with shifts, you'll have no reason\nto complain.  Let me explain...\n\n    The ride is worst when turning and applying lots of power to the\nwheels.  I feel the wheels scrabbling for traction and torque steer\nmaking the car skitter left and right.  After I understood this, I\navoid the limits of traction -- and I'm a happy camper again.\n\n    It's not body rigidity, but the composure of the car.\n\n    As if matching the suspension, the steering feel is quite heavy.\nMy first impression of driving my SHO was how hard you had to turn the\nwheel at highway speeds.  It tracks straight as an arrow, but when\ndriving around a parking lot, the high-effort steering didn't seem so\nuseful.  However, it's reasonable, but it doesn't communicate the road\nto the driver as well as a 1993 Ford Probe GT.  IMHO, it's much better\nthan the steering on my Celica ST.\n\n    I wonder how bad this car is during winter?\n\n\nMiscellaneous notes:\n\n    GRIPES:\n\n    The rattles from the sunroof is intermittent -- some days it rattles\n        loudly, other days I look up wondering where all the noise went.\n\n    Activating the sunroof is sometimes very noisy -- loud squealing as\n	it retracts on its rails.  I wonder if there is a quick fix for this.\n	Again, other days it completely disappears.  (Function of humidity?)\n\n    Once I made the connection between the sometimes awful feeling suspension\n	and torque steer, I've never complained about ride.\n\n    I wish the seats had more support under the thighs.  Also, I wish the\n	side bolsters would close more tightly.  \n\n    I hear that tires for this car can get really expensive.  I\n	currently have Goodyear GT+4s that cost the previous owner $500\n	for four.\n\n    I used to hate the Ford stereo systems -- whose idea was it\n	to use a volume *paddle*?  Now, to my amazement, I don't\n	really mind...  and sometimes think it's an okay idea!!!\n	Pretty ridiculous, though.\n\n    Getting up to 4000 rpm sometimes seems to be a chore.  But,\n	this is no big deal.  There is more than enough torque\n	down low.\n\n    I often goof up the shifting when driving with friends.  It\n	took me a couple of days before I could really shift\n	smoothly from 2nd to 3rd gear.  (Hard to believe, isn't it?)\n\n    My car has almost 93,000 miles on it.  My parents noted that\n	it is almost impossible to find a low-mileage SHO. \n	Astute observation, IMHO.  I wonder how long I can make\n	my SHO last -- I just bought a book titled "Drive It Forever"\n	for tips in this department.  :-)\n\n    The goofy parking brake pedal still throws me for a loop.  I once\n	parked the car in gear, and then accidentally let out the clutch\n	after I started it.  The car jolted forward, and bounced off\n	the car in front of me -- no paint damage at all, but starting the car \n	is a whole new ritual for me with that fangled pedal!  Also, I began \n	to wonder how strong that brake really is.  (Today, I backed out of \n	parking spot today and started to drive away before I noticed \n	the glowing brake light.  Oops.)\n\n    The driver's power window creaks when closed all the way.  The same\n    	thing happens in my parents 1989 Mercury Sable.  Oddly, all the\n	other windows work smoothly.\n\n\n    LIKES:\n\n    I'm liking the interior amenities more and more each day.  The\n    	cupholders are great.\n\n    I didn't expect to use the keyless entry buttons so much, but\n	it really is handy.  You can lock all the doors by\n	pressing the 7/8 and 9/10 buttons together!  Neat!  And\n	you can never lock yourself out of the car.\n\n    I really feel like I don't deserve this car.  I really can't\n	believe that I could afford it.  I got this car ten years \n	ahead of schedule.  :-)\n\n    I love this car so much that I've been telling my parents to\n	look into buying one.  I love this car so much that I\n	wrote this 13K file -- I meant to write a couple of lines\n	and ended up with this.  \n\n    If there were a J.D. Powers Survey for used car owners, I would have\n	an opportunity to express my incredible satisfaction of owning this \n	car.  I don't like thinking about getting another car, but at this\n	point in time, I'm sure I'd buy another SHO.  For under $7000, you\n	can't beat it.  (Next time with an airbag and ABS, though.)\n\n    Insurance-wise, this car is also a big win.  I pay the same premiums\n	as on my 1987 Toyota Celica -- despite that it has nearly twice\n	the horsepower.  \n\n\n\nOther Odds and Ends:\n\n    Much to my amazement, there is no SHO mailing list anywhere.\nMaybe because the _SHO Registry_ publication has filled this void.  I\nhaven't joined yet, but I've noticed that queries about SHOs still\nappear on rec.autos about once a month.  Owners of SHOs are always\nquick to respond, and are very vocal fans of the cars.  (Maybe some\nof the most vocal on rec.autos.  :-)\n\n    I've put together the responses to my questions about the cars, as\nwell as other posts with useful information on these cars.  I'll be \nposting this in the form of a FAQ soon.  \n\n    If anyone is interested in starting a mailing list, please speak up!\nI don't know if I have the resources here at Purdue to start one, but \nmaybe someone out there does.

i    of course car safety is important.. I for one used to think that these \nguys are going way OTT with their airtbags (sorry del button dont work) and \nside impact bars and crash zones and (the list goes on) just tpo make the \ncar heavbier (and all its penalties) ... bur recently I had a little accident (on\nmy bike) and not as bad as John's ..... but after the accident - it made me \nrealizer I should have worn a helmet (my mom always insistede I should... I was\nmore concerned about my hair style).....
If you had free reign to design your own instrument cluster, which\ngauges would you choose to have beyond the basic set?\n\nI consider the basic set to be:\n\n	- tach\n\n	- coolant temp (or cylinder head temp for air-cooled engines)\n	- oil pressure\n	- amps\n\n	- speedo\n	- fuel\n\nothers that are nice to have:\n\n	- volts (maybe this should be in the basic set)\n	- vacuum/boost\n\nI can think of a few others, but what are your ideas and why?
flat = 180 deg V = horizonatlly opposed\n\nUsually, it also equals "boxer," however, I think the term is\ntraditionally reserved for 8's and 12's (and firing order matters).\nThis was talked about here in r.a many months back; I can't remember\nthe consensus.\n\nExamples:\n\nFerrari's 512TR is a flat 12 boxer.\nPorsche's 911 is a flat 6.\nSubaru's Impreza is a flat 4.\n\nRegards,\n\nBrian\n\nbqueiser@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI am the engineer, I can choose K.
Probably the most famous V16 is the one Cadillac made from about 1925  \nto 1935.  They had to scale down then because the Great Depression really put  \nthe crimp on luxury cars.  It had 452 cubic inches with over two hundred horse  \npower.  "They don't make them like they used to."  \n	There were others though.  Packard had one until about 1930 whe it down  \nsized to their legendary Twin-Six, their mainstay for the next twenty years.   \nLincoln and Pierce Arrow might have also had one but I am not two sure.\n	Most luxury and semi-luxury cars of this era at least experimented with  \nV16 if they did not actually produce them.

Are you serious?  The auto that had a lot to do with bringing the term\n"boxer" to the popular forefront was the Ferrari 512 Berlinetta Boxer\nor the 512BB. Had a 5 liter, opposed 12 cylinder engine.
Talk to Philip Greenspun. He took Ford to court recently and, despite much\nmanouvering and trickery on Ford's part, he won! Well, actually I think\nFord settled out of court on the provision he shut his mouth and stopped \ncausing them trouble. I love it when the little guy wins. I don't have\nPhilip's address anymore, but a "Philip, where are you" call may bring him\nout of hiding.\n\nCheers,\nPaul.
Does anybody have any information on the second generation Broncos? (I'm\nnot talking about Bronco II's, I'm referring to the Broncos that began\nproduction in 1978 based on the F-150 chassis I believe)\n\nI need to know what to look for, can the tops be removed from all\nmodels, how easily can that be done. Also, what kind of price range\nshould I be looking at? (i.e. what is blue book) I'm in college right\nnow, and would like a Jeep. Unfortunately, I've got a bit of a ride to\nschool, and I need to carry a lot of junk to and from the dormitory in\nthe spring/fall. I think that the Bronco (with the removable fiberglass)\nwould be a better (read "bigger") choice than a CJ-5 or CJ-7.\n\nEven better: anybody in the Maryland/Virginia area interested in selling\none?
A dealer will make money off you in three ways, if you let him:\n\n	1)  New car markup over his cost (remember his hold-back),\n	2)  Arranging financing through the dealership, and\n	3)  Screwing you on the trade.\n\nKeep the deal with the dealer simple by eliminating 2 & 3.  Buying a car at \n"dealer's cost" is meaningless if he makes $1000 on the trade and/or gets a \nkickback from the bank.\n\nBlue book (you need to know if you're talking average wholesale or average \nretail) is a good guide to value for a car.  If you are selling it yourself, \ntry to get average retail, and chances are you'll have done ok.\n\nBe careful selling to acquaintances if you ever want them to become friends.
My 85 Caprice Classic with 120K+ miles has finally reached\nthe threshold of total number of mechanical problems that\nI am forced to post :).  Anyone out there who might be\nable to give me some pointers on one or more of the below,\nplease e-mail or post!\n\n1. When making turns, especially when accelerating,\n   there is usually a loud "thunk" from the rear of\n   of the car.  Sounds like it could be the differential.\n   What could cause this?  Is the differential going\n   bad?  I recently had the differential fluid changed,\n   and it DID have tiny metal bits in it.  (And no,\n   the sound is NOT something rolling around in the\n   trunk!)  \n\n2. On starting the car, I get blue (oil) smoke from\n   the exhaust for 5-10 seconds.  Exhaust valves\n   going bad?  Worn rings?  Anyone know whether the\n   valves on the 4.3 TBI engine can be lapped?\n\n3. Brakes.  More pedal travel than I feel comfortable\n   with, but master cylinder is full and fluid is\n   relatively clear.  Pedal does NOT slowly sink to\n   the floor when held down.  Pedal does not feel\n   spongey, but I suppose that bleeding the brakes\n   might help -- could anything else cause this?\n\n4. Tranny.  Tranny problems seem to be slowly getting\n   worse -- takes almost 2 seconds to downshift from\n   3rd to 2nd on heavy throttle application, and more\n   recently, it is reluctant to shift from 2nd to 3rd.\n   Fluid (checked with car running with tranny put\n   through all the gears and then back to park, as per\n   Haynes manual) is red and clear, and is on full mark.\n\n5. My springs all around are just about shot -- I have\n   4 new shocks on, but car still skips out on bumps\n   in turns at moderate to high speed.  How hard are\n   they to change?  Can they be reconditioned?\n\nI'd be interested in hearing from any GM full-size RWD owners\nout there with stories to tell and/or advice.  Here in Philly,\nthese cars are apparently stolen(!) quite often and converted\ninto taxis.  Apparently the cab conversion shops will get a\njunk title for the car or switch VINs with a car about to be\njunked.  About 60% of Philly cabs are Caprice's, with most of\nthe rest being Crown Vic's with a few old New Yorkers and\nImpalas (& Broughams).
I looked at that Bimmer yesterday. It's an '81, has about 90kmi, according\nto owner (odometer stopped working at 68Kmi). Drivess well, sounds good,\nbody is OK, he wants $3000.\ni liked the car, despite it's auto tranny, but my wife will be a primary\ndriver on this one, and she wants auto.\nThe radio does not work untill the car warms up and you honk the horn (!)\nThe A/C seems to have a leak. \nThe sunroof is sticky, but operational.\nOdometer does not work, as mentioned before.\nIdle is a bit bouncy, going from 900rpm to 1200rpm.\nWipers are slow.\nThat's teh gripes. The owner says that he changed radiator, alternator, \nrotors and calipers, exhaust.\nThe biggest problem, is that the owner is a shifty SOB, telling strange\nstories. I hate that. I would never buy from a persom like that, except, how\noften you see a descent 528i for that amount of money. He also said that,\nalthough I could bring a mechanicin, he wouldn't let me check the car by taking \nit to a garage. Suspicious. And who knows what milage is on it.\nSo, let me know what to check for, given there's practically no rust.\nI know there was an article on 528i in R&D a few years back, anybody remembers\nwhat issue?\nMike.S
I agree about the durability of the old TH400 trannies from GM.  While I \nnever intentionally slamed my '68 Firebird 400 ci Conv. into gear, I would leave \nthe trannie in Low (read 1st), grab hold, hit the pedal, and once the tires \ngrabbed, take off.  When I reached about 57-60mph the turbo 400 Auto would \nshift to S (read 'super' or 2nd) and leave about 10 to 15 foot of double \nstripped rubber on the ground.  Most everyone I knew at the time was quite \nimpressed with 'peeling' out at 60 MPH.  The trannie held up just fine.\nMotor mounts would last about a year until I tied the motor down with large\nchains.

reasonable  \n\nThat's probably true but it's the closest to it that you're going to get.  \nThe actual dealer cost depends on a lot of things and even the dealer  \nprobably doesn't know exactly what it will be until all the factory   \nkick-backs, incentives, etc. are paid and that often depends on his volume  \nat the end of the month/quarter/whatever. It might be a funny munber but  \nit's all you have to start with, except the sticker, and anyone who pays  \nsticker price is really being ripped off.

My last car had T-Tops (BIG T-Tops).  My current car is a convertible.\nIMHO, if you're after that 'convertible feel', T-Tops, open-top,\nsunroofs, moonroofs, whatever, just don't cut it.  There's no\nsubstitute for a convertible.  If you're not after that sun beating\ndown on you, the wind in your hair and teeth, the flopsum and\njetsum getting in the car and the noises associated with the\nwhooshing of the wind, you're not after that 'convertible feel'.\nSo go with something with at least a hole above the driver but don't call\nit a convertible.\n\nAnd I do wonder how those targa tops would compare against my roll\nbar in a rollover situation.  Of course, I'd rather not test it\nin MY car.  I, too, am in my early 40s.\n\nA convertible--accept no substitute.

Tony,  I believe, first of all, that Max's car is an Austrailian\nbuilt car.  I don't think its a chopped up U.S. unit.  It may be called a\nKangaroo or Roo or something similar-not sure.  But, I do recall reading\nthat Austrailian cars used Ford V-8 engines.  The Ford V-8 Interceptor\nis, I think, a 428 c.i. cop car motor.  Whatever the case that small car\nwith a screaming big block Ford 428 would probably smoke the tires for\nmiles/kilometers.  I hope someone out there can elaborate on the subject.

I am considering the purchse of a 1987 VW Jetta GLI with 87k miles on it.\nI recently found out that there are two versions of the GLI -- 8v and 16v.\nI know of three differences between the two cars that both carry the same\nname:  the 16v version has 20 more horsepower, 4 wheel discs, and a standard\nsunroof. \nOops, that's the difference between the GLI 16v and the regular GL !!\nSo in addition to the engine, what other differences exist between the\ntwo models of the Jetta GLI ?\nMore importantly, how can I tell which version this one is ?  There are\nno badges that said "16v" so I am inclined to think that is the 8v version.\nAssuming this one (the one I looked at) is the 8v version, is there a valid\nreason to buy it instead of a comparably equipped GL which would cost less ?\n(Of course I would love to get the 16v version, but money talks.)
I don't think that a transmission fluid change will solve your problem.\n Unless you are in an extremely cold climate and using a very heavy weight\n fluid.  Follow the manufacturer's recommended oil weight.  Some of the\n cars I have had (all standard transmissions 4 or 5 speeds) recommend\n changing the transmission fluid at 30,000 miles under normal driving\n conditions.  I've gone 100,000 without changing the transmission oil (and\n had to replace the transmission bearings!). My older cars used 85 weight\n oil whereas my 92 Honda uses 10-30 motor oil (or maybe 30 weight).
This whole discussion is just a religous war.  I'd rather have a '93 RX-7\nthan the Mustang 5.0L for 3 times the price.  That's how you explain\nPorsches selling.  Some folks would rather have the Stang...\n\n<shrug>\n\nSean
anyone else experiencing a similar problem?\n\nThis concerns the clutch on a 92 Honda Accord 5 speed. When the clutch\nis first used in the morning, about the first 4 miles of shifting, there\nis a significant amount of clutch chatter until things warm up.  Then the\nclutch shifts smoothly.  This chatter started when I moved to the San \nFrancisco Bay area from a low-humidity environment.  The dealer stated\nthat this is known to happen since Honda changed from an asbestos to\nnon-asbestos clutch material.  No remedy!! Seems that moisture on clutch\nsurface causes slipping until the moisture evaporates.
A Yugo that will go 1/4mi in 7.7 seconds will _not_ lose on the\nstreet. That's just too damn quick. It might be wrapped around\na telephone pole at the end of that quarter mile, but it will\nbe there alone...\n\n\nOr you could replace the stock shifter with a Hurst short-throw\nshifter (available from Ford Motorsport), or any number of other\nafter-market products to boost the performance of a Mustang or\nCamaro. Can you do _that_ with a '93 RX-7, or, verily, with _any_\nMR-2? With the Detroit aftermarket, you can build a Mustang or\nCamaro which is superior to either car you mention for less than\nthe sticker price of either.\n\n\nWell, gee. It works, and it doesn't break. It transmits power to\nthe drive wheels, and it's essentially zero maintenance--and there's\nan aftermarket in parts for Ford and Chevy rear-ends, too.\n\n\nWell, the '93 Mustang Cobra (which, from all reports, uses the\nsame running gear as '94 Mustang) has 4-wheel disks. I can't\nspeak for the new Camaro, but I think it does, too.\n\nAlso, stop and think about the markets here. The Mustang is, and\nalways has been, a mass-market sporty car (that's where the\n"pony car" class came from) with a performance model. That's\nwhy it has the econo-box running gear. That was also factored\ninto the design of the Mustang from the day Lee Iacocca conceived\nhis baby; it was designed as a wide-market car--sporty, yet \naccessible--with room for performance tweaking.\n\nThe cars you listed are designed for a specific market niche,\nand they both fit those niches very well. The Mustang, at least,\ndoes well in multiple markets; I can't speak for the Camaro.\n\n				James

In a word, yes.\n\n1989 Bonnevilles prices (avg. retail):
Don't worry about this -- they'll drop you like a hot potato after you do\n  make a claim. They'll just make filing the claim a pain, but it will end\n  when they leave you in the lurch.\n\nMore than that. GEICO funded the company that developed LIDAR. When locals \n  showed a reluctance to BUY the units, GEICO started giving them away. I\n  know they've given units to the Florida Highway Patrol, County Sheriff's a\n  and some local governments.\nThe real question is why? This is the hook. GEICO, and other Ins. Co.s can\n  tell which drivers represent risk. This is a determination they can make\n  AFTER YOU receive a speeding ticket from one of GEICO's LIDAR units. Most\n  drivers do not represent increased risk even after a ticket or two, but \n  this gives them the opportunity to RAISE RATES FOR EQUAL RISK. It's called\n  extra profits. They also know how silly the NSL is, and how it is almost\n  universally ignored. Driving in excess of the NSL gets you a ticket, an\n  increase in your rates, points on your license --- but it doesn't make you\n  a riskier driver to insure.\nLike the sound of this? Like the people who thought up the scheme? Go GEICO!
I would also be interested in finding out about the '94 Talon,\nand I suspect that many other people would be interested too,\nso let's get some responses on the net.\n\nThe question again:\nDoes anyone have any info on the 1994 Eagle Talon / Mitsubishi\nEclipse / Plymouth Laser?\n\nI know that the old Talon was based on the Mitsubishi Galant,\nand that in Japan, a 240 hp twin-turbo V6 1994 Galant has been\nreleased.\n\nSo anyway, any info on the '94 Talon would be appreciated.

Ahh Broncos.  Well personally, I have a '78.  The blue book is just\na hair over 3 grand.  I bought it for 2500 and then bought new tires 650\nfront end rebuild 350, carb rebuild 130.  Then i did the unthinkable\nand blew the engine (not bronco specific, unmaintained engine with 168,000)\n2400 more bucks there, now it is in nice condition, well after new seats out\nof a t-bird, radio, 2 amps, speakers, alarm, well the radio and amps were \nfree and i bought the speakers used for 40 bucks, and the other speakers\ni took out of my old jeep (Sell a Jeep for a bronco you might ask,\nbut it was a Wagoneer).  Its a lovely specimen, solid front and rear\naxels, ford 9" and a dana 44 up front.  Watch the rear axel wrap, i \nbusted off my u-bolts ONCE, i added traction shocks after that and \nhaven't had a problem since.  Also the bottom of the doors tend to \nrot, bottom of the tailgates likes to rust right up to the new ones\nthat might be in your budget.  The post 80 broncos have that sickly\nTTB front end and little stamped and folded steel radius arms were\nas the 78-79 have nice big cast iron longer radius arms(ie more prspective\nwheel travel).  The only rust i have is on my doors and a few\ndings in the sheet metal.  I don't know when the removeable tops were\ndiscontinued but they are fun.  I just ordered a full convertable top\nfor 400$ for mine(credit card).  Don't ever break the window if you\nhave the double laminated bronzed privacy glass in your cap it is over\n400 bucks to replace.  My bronco also does pretty good offroad,\ni haven't bottomed out my suspension, YET, and have crossed over\n3 foot deep of water with no problems, handles rocks like a charm too.\nOne problem is it is WIDE and you sometimes can't follow a CJ or a\nToyota, between two rocks or trees, and your grandmother will have\na hard time getting up into it.
A question for any high-mileage Audi owners out there: I am\ninterested in buying a 1989 Audi 5000S for $5500 Cdn.

My question is: how\nreliable are Audi 5000s with mileage that high?  Would it\nbe worthwhile for me to buy the car?  Any problem areas that\nI should look out for?\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.  Post responses and/or\ne-mail me.\n\nThanks\n\nSteve Hui

Before the S4 became the S4 it was called the 200 turbo quattro 20v.\n   This model did come in a wagon, a very quick wagon.  Very rare also.\n\n						      Mike Sylvester  Umass\n\nBeing a satisfied Audi owner (-90 100 turbo quattro. my 4:th Audi) I\nget the free VAG magazine. The latest issue presented a new S4 Avant\n(wagon) with a 4.2 litre V8. I'd like one of these ;-)\n\nBtw, this is my second quattro and my third turbo and I must say that\neven in the summer, with dry roads, the quattros give so much extra in\nroad holding and balance that I hope I can afford them always.\n\nThomas
A friend had a Ford Taunus (era early 60's) that *did* have a V4 in it.\n\nI lost a bet on it. I find it hard to believe there are no *recent* cars\nwith a V4 in them. Any *recent* ones?\n\nSpiros
Drivel.  I received delivery of my '93 Trans Am 7 weeks after I \nordered (promised 6-8 weeks), and paid $400 over dealer invoice, \nwhich is a $1425 discount off of MSRP.  I only have about 370 \nmiles on it, but so far no problems, and it seems very well put \ntogether.  By the way, first year production will be about 60,000 \ncars.  Dealers would like you to think there is a shortage, but \nconsidering they only sold about 90,000 F bodies last year and the \nnew model was introduced mid-year, that is not going to create a \nshortage.  GM planning on ramping to about 160,000 F bodies next \nyear (according to a WSJ article).\n \nSeveral people have mentioned seeing a photo of the '94 Mustang in \nPopular Mechanics.  I saw a photo of it in Motor Trend January \n1993 issue (p30).  Direct side on view.  Although they described \nit as a "seriously handsome car with broad shoulders," I thought \nit looked pretty boring in that view.  Roofline reminded me of a \nToyota Celica (yuch!).  Description of mechanicals same as has \nbeen reported from the PM article.
I'm having an interesting problem with my girlfriend's car.  Before\nI delve into its innards, I thought I'd check "net.wisdom" on the\nsubject. :)\n\nIt's a 1985 Buick Skyhawk (I know...I know)\n2.0l EFI 4-banger\nauto\n35k miles\n\nWhen I drive tha car long enough to get it hot (especially at\nhighways speeds) the transmission has this nasty habit of\ngetting "stuck" in 3rd gear.  As a result, when you stop for\na light the motor stalls.  Putting the car in park, and waiting\nfor 30-60 seconds before restarting sometimes allows the transmission\nto "reset" and go back into 1st.  Otherwise, it just stalls when\nput in drive.  \n\nMy thoughts:  Either it the 3rd gear band is binding and getting\nstuck when it gets hot (not so likely) or perhaps the lock-up\nconverter is not disengaging properly (seems likely).  The least\nlikely (keeping fingers crossed) is that some critical vacuum\nhose has broken/cracked and this behaviour is due to lack of\nvaccuum somewhere (as used to happen with old modulator valves).\n\nMy background is that my father owns a service station and\nI worked there on and off from 10-19 years of age.  Please\nfeel free to be as technical as you want. :)\n\nI'd appreciate hearing any tips/suggestions/offers of free\nbeer. <grin>\n\nSkoal,
Hi Javier, (how are things at Corp, my old stomping ground was c-level?)\nVibration when applying the brakes can be caused, on disc brakes at least,\nby warped rotors. When the brakes are applied, there results uneven pressure\non the rotor.  Turning the rotors by a brake shop will remedy this problem\nas long as there is enough rotor width left for turning (i.e. within spec).\nThere could be some possible front end suspension problem but a brake shop\nshould be able to confirm warped rotors by a visual inspection which is free.
Funny, I thought the numbering scheme for both Lexus and Infiniti was\nrelated to sticker price more than anything else, i.e. Infiniti G20 (around\n20K), Q45 (around 45K), Lexus ES250 (RIP) (around 25K), Lexus ES300 (around\n30K), etc.\n\nIs there a conspiracy theory there? \n\nSpiros
A 68 Corvette but, I don't want to put Corvette seats in it.  The original\n seats are in exc. shape but they are uncomfortable as hell.  I'm going to\n store those and find a set to drive in.  I have all the Vette catalogs but\n I'm looking for a more generic type seat.  I can modify the brackets but \n cushion height and overall width are a concern.  I've looked through some\n local boneyards without success.  I would just like to find a pair of \n cheapo's to use this summer.
Not to inject a non-automotive note to this thread, but the BMW opposed\ntwin used in motorcycles for a *long* time is and always has been known as\na "boxer".
Is there a Honda mailing list, and if so how do I subscribe to it?
The European version is called 200 SX and have a 1.8 liter engine with\nturbo and have more power than the US version ( 169 HP ); it goes from\n0 to 100 Km/h in 7.5 sec and have a top speed of 225 Km/h ( 140 miles/h ).\nI just purchased one ( new ) and I am looking for a repair book. I could\nnot find one in FRANCE and GERMANY; does anybody knows where to find one ?\nIs there one in the UK ?\nProbabaly no use to look in the US as the 240 SX have here a different motor.\nI am very pleased with the car and have no problem with it; but like to have\ngood technical documentation about the car I own.
RADAR (Radio Association Defending Airwave Rights) says that Geico\ninsurance not only buy's Radar for police but also actively lobbies\nstates to promote making Radar Detectors illegal.   I think the\nbuying part is a misuse of money but the Radar Detector part shows\nhow little they know about the issue.  No study I am aware of has ever\nconcluded that detectors have a negative impact on safety or that\nusers have a higher average speed.  Incompetence by Geico?  I think\nso.\n\n\nTroy Wecker\ntroy@sequent.com\nSequent Computer Systems\nBeaverton, OR
this is off the subject but, \n\nDon't the numbers in the car names above refair to the engine size in \nliters? i.e. ls400 = 4.0litre engine, sc300 = 3.0 liter "Sport Coupe".. \nand Q45 = 4.5liter.. (similar, kinda, to BMW and MB nameing deal).
On the subject of the upcoming new Mustang:\n\n\n\nThe car magazines have printed a lot of information about the new Mustang\nand the consensus about what to believe in my "car circle" is that the \nsuspension pieces and tuning will be almost identical to the current\nCobra, but on a stiffer body structure which will improve its behavior.\nAfter the MN12 (Thunderbird) cost and weight debacle, Ford decided \nindependent rear suspension with rear wheel drive won't be tried again in \na volume car.  \n\nThe current 4.9l V-8 will soldier on for about two years.  A version of\nthe 32 valve modular V-8 in the Mark VIII could be offered then.  Ford\nis spending big money tooling up for 2.5l and 3.5l V-6 engines which will\npower most of their cars in the immediate future, and therefore probably\ndo not consider volume production of 300 hp V-8 engines a priority. \n\nUndisguised, the car looks OK, but not nearly as exciting as the new\nCamaro/Firebird, IMO.  \n\nI suspect Ford will produce their car with higher quality than GM will \nachieve with the Camaro/ Firebird.  The way GM loses money, the temptation\nto "just get them out the door" for the sake of positive cash flow will be \ngreat once demand really takes off.
Having had my car die on me(engine fire, insurance agent said\nit was probably totaled), I am in the market for a another vehicle.\nI saw a Toronado that was within my expected price range and was\nwondering if anybody could relate their experiences with me.\n\nNamely:  1.  Does it have accceptable power(it has a 305 in it)?\n	 2.  Does its being front wheel drive make maintenance difficult?\n	 3.  One power window and the power seat do not work, are these\n		expensive items to replace if I do the work myself?\n	 4.  How long do the engines usually last( 90M+ now)?\n	 5.  Any other experiences good or bad, and opinions.
Oh, that's not so bad. Every time I try to change the oil, I forget to\nshut off the engine first. The hot oil comes out and scalds me, blinds\nme, then the engine starts to overheat, and while I'm screaming in agony\nand trying to crawl out from under the car, I grab the red hot exhaust\npipe and get third degree burns on my hands. My screams intensify as I\nfinally emerge from under the car, and I struggle to my feet in front of\nthe car, whereupon the radiator hose ruptures and sprays me with super\nheated coolant. Then the engine seizes, but not before the cylinder head\nexplodes, piercing my flesh with fragments of red hot iron.\n\nThis happens every time. I'm starting to think I should pay the mechanic\n$25 instead paying the hospital $250,000 and the dealer $25,000 for a new\ncar. This gets costly when you change the oil every 3000 miles.
I dont know about Saabs but whenever there is a 'long temr tset' in a magazine\nthey always say that tehy're are little annoying niggles which keep on occuring\nevery so often... I wouldn't expect that from such a 'quality' car.... why \ndoesn't anything like this ever happen on BMWs? Maybe coz they're 'quality'\ncars ;-)
Greetings automobile enthusiasts.  Can anyone tell me if there is\na mail order company that sells BMW parts discounted... cheaper than\nthe dealerships.\n\nSorry if it's a FAQ. email replies very much appreciated.\n\nThanks,
Deloreans NEVER had a factory V8.  They were considering production\nwith a turbo (or twin turbo, I forget) version of the standard V6.  As\nto who produced it, you got me!\n\nJonathan
My suggestion look at your current insurance card, there will be a name \naccross the top telling you which insurance company you are insured by.\nCall information in Houston and get the number of a branch office in the \nHouston area, call the insurance company.\n\nYour rates will vary depending on the amount of coverage you want,\ndo you want to carry comp and collision (probably not on an 82),\nwhat your driving record is.  You mentioned none of these things in your\nposting so how can anyone give you accurate information.\n\nLike I said, pick up the phone and make a few calls, it won't kill you.
Well, the Opel deal fell through...\n\nNow i'm looking at a Datsun 240Z for sale in our local buy&sell.  Any\nprevious owners have any experience with these cars?  Besides looking\nfor rust,good compression,low miles, and all the other usual car\nthings one looks for, is there anything special about these cars that\nI should watch out for?\n\nHow about things like handling,performance,mileage,etc.  These cars\nlook hot, to my eyes at least, and bear more than a passing\nresemblance to the Aston Martin DB4 Zagato(sp?), which has to be one\nof the most beatiful cars ever made.
We have seen lots of discussion on automobile engine configuration. Let me ask \na similar question from the aviation field. You must have seen images of prop \nplanes with all cylinders exposed. I have seen up to 8 cylinders positioned \nradially in a circular fashion with the prop at the center of the circle. \nThis arrangement always brings up a geometric dilemma. How can one crankshaft \nthrow accomodate 8 rods or are the pistons displaced but not visible from the \noutside.
I have manual transmission 5 speed. It difficult to engage gear. Does xmission oil change improve this situation?\nWhat do you think about the most favorable xmission oil change period?
I had a '82 Saab 900 Turbo, and now have a '87 BMW 325is\n\nThere is no comparison for handling, reliability, or overall quality of\nengineering. The BMW wins hands down. After 5 years I was sick and tired\nof the all the little problems and entropic decay of the SAAB. The 6-year\nold BMW is still as sweet as it was new.\n\nBut I see you are posting from western MA. BMW's **SUCK** in the snow.\nI have aggressive snows, plus a hundred pounds of sand in the back, and I\nstill try to avoid driving in the snow. I happily took the SAAB through\nblizzard conditions without a worry. I would say this is the single design\nflaw in the BMW.

First off, the correct spelling of Nissan's luxury automobile division\nis "Infiniti" not "Infinity."  I would also like to clear up the question\nof what kind of engines power Lexus and Infiniti automobiles, since a\nperson had remarked in earlier posts that most Lexus and Infiniti models\nhad V6 engines, while at the same time saying that several of each\nmanufacturer used V8 engines.\n\nLexus:\n  LS400- V8\n  GS300- V6\n  ES300- V6\n  SC400- V8\n  SC300- V6\n\nInfiniti:\n  Q45- V8\n  J30- V6\n  G20- inline 4 (I must admit that I cannot remeber for sure here)\n\nI hope this helps.
Before we get into another discussion on the relative merits of a car alarm,\nlet's go on the assumption that one is desired.  The question then remains,\nwhich one?  I've owned a Hornet, and was satisfied, but not enough to get\nanother for my new car.  The Alpine has been highly recommended, but what about\nClifford and VSE's Derringer 2?  Any others?  I want all of the standard stuff;\ndoor lock interface, starter kill, light flash, LED, valet mode, passive/active,\nshock/motion sensor, etc...  Thanks for the advice!

Can taking the car to a car wash hurt the car's finish?\n\nAnd if so, is it better to hand wash it about once a month, or just take it \nto the car wash anyway?\n\nAre detailing places worth the money?  if i do a good, careful job on washing\nand waxing, is a detail place going to be worth it?\n\nreply to my email address: pfk1@crux1.cit.cornell.edu\n\npk4
It is actually simple in principle. Porous adsorbents like zeolite and\nactivated carbon can adsorb gases evaporated from the adsorbate (water\nor methanol, etc.) giving the cooling effect.  Upon being heated, the \ngas-saturated adsorbent bed will give off the gases which are then to be\ncondensed.  This forms the adsorption refrigeration cycle.  The only problem\nis that the COP is very low (0.2 -0.6).  \n\nMax
Well, it depends on what kind of locking lugnuts you have.  My previous\ncar had locking lugnuts that weighed about 2.5oz. more than the others. \nThe locking lugnuts were factory equipment, and according to the factory\nservice manual, after tire balancing the technician/mechanic was\nsupposed to put a 1/2 oz. counterweight on the rim opposite the locking\nnut.  I always had vibration problems with those stupid lugnuts since no\none ever did the service correctly. I eventually got rid of the locking\nlugnuts and replaced them with the standard lugnuts.  Unfortunately, I\nfound out about the counterweighting technique 6 months after I got rid\nof the locking nuts. :-(\n\nMy present car, a Saturn SC, has locking lugnuts that I bought at the\ndealer and are made specifically for the Saturn.  They have been made to\nbe exactly the same weight as the non-locking lugnuts (said so on the\npackage and I verified it myself).  I haven't had any vibration problems\nwith the tires at all (due to the nuts) in 12,000 of ownership.  I did\nhave some other vibration problems, but it was due to a poor job of tire\nbalancing.

Ok, so in my ongoing search for a sport utility, here's the latest;\n\n\nToyota 4runner:\n\n	 Small. Small Small Small. The interior of this vehical is impossible\n	for a large person. Too bad; it would have been the winner otherwise.\n\nNissan Pathfinder:\n	\n	Very low ceiling. My head hit the roof, Fun on bumps, no? Also has\n	a cheap-looking interior.\n\nIsuzu Trooper:\n\n	Class act. This is a really, really nice vehical. Very comfortable,\n	handled ok. Has really cool grab handles EVERYWHERE. But it's huge,\n	and the engine is a bit too small for it's bulk; also the manual shift is \n	weird and kind of awkward. I'd buy this if it were $3k cheaper or 10"\n	shorter. But at this size and for this price, no. I kept picturing trying to \n	park in in San Francisco. No Thanks.\n\n\nChevy Blazer:\n\n	Cheap looking. Small. Not as small as the Toyota and Nissan, but still \n	too small.\n\nFord Explorer:\n\n	This is no sports car, and it's certainly not for the serious off roader.\n	But it's big enough to be comfortable without being as huge and heavy as the\n	trooper. It's engine has plenty of power for everyday driving, though it would\n	be nice if it had a *bit* more. The automatic tranny is pretty nice; head and\n	shoulders above my '90 mazda MPV. The steering is not as tight as I'd like,\n	but it's acceptable. The two door has easy-to-enter back seats (Easier to get\n	into, in fact, than the driver's seat of the 4runner!) and with a 10" shorter\n	wheelbase and the easier availability of a manual tranny, (Yes, I'm a manual \n	shift biggot, I admit it...) it's the one I'm thinking of buying. \n\n\n	So, that said, is there anyone out there who has one of these and hates it?\n	Anyone had any major problems? Heard any horror stories? \n\n	Also, any reason to buy the ford over the mazda Navajo, both being essentially\n	the same vehical?\n\n\n			Thanks-\n\n\n	-Karl
After a tip from Gary Crum (crum@fcom.cc.utah.edu) I got on the Phone\nwith "Pontiac Systems" or "Pontaic Customer Service" or whatever, and\ninquired about a rumoured Production Hold on the Formula Firebird and\nTrans Am.  BTW, Talking with the dealer I bought the car from got me\nnowhere.  After being routed to a "Firebird Specialist", I was able\nto confirm that this is in fact the case.\n\nAt first, there was some problem with the 3:23 performance axle ratio.\nShe wouldn't go into any details, so I don't know if there were some\nshipped that had problems, or if production was held up because they\nsimply didn't have the proper parts from the supplier.  As I say, she\nwas pretty vague on that, so if anyone else knows anything about this,\nfeel free to respond.  Supposedly, this problem is now solved.\n\nSecond, there is a definate shortage of parts that is somehow related\nto the six-speed Manual transmission.  So as of this posting, there is\na production hold on these cars.  She claimed part of the delay was\nnot wanting to use inferior quality parts for the car, and therefore\nhaving to wait for the right high quality parts...  I'm not positive\nthat this applies to the Camaro as well, but I'm guessing it would.\n\nCan anyone else shed some light on this?\n\nChris S.\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChris Silvester      | "Any man capable of getting himself elected President\nchriss@sam.amgen.com |  should by no means be allowed to do the job"\nchriss@netcom.com    |   - Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
i think you got it the other way round: the Ferrari flat 12 is a 180\ndegree v12 and not a "true" boxer, while the subaru and porsche are\ntrue boxers.  don't know about the vw bug though, but i suspect that\nit is also a true boxer.
I am thinking of buying a used Audi 90 Auto.\n\nThese cars look good and Audi do have a good rep. for these cars in Europe\n(where I'm from).\n\nI was just wondering if there anything about these cars that I should know.
Yeah... and BMW 525e has 2.7 litres\n		535      3.4 \n\nBTW - can someone out there please tell me how to put someone else's file \non and then reply to that so the other person's file and my own 'reply' go\nto the newgroups together? (ps: just mail me personally)
The Civic does still come in a 4 door model.  My wife and I looked\nquite seriously at the 626, Prizm (Corolla), and Civic, as well as\nsome other cars.  Our impressions: all three seemed well built and had\nthe features we wanted - these are similar to the features you want\nexcept for cruise control, and we want a manual transmission and are\nconsidering anti-lock brakes.  I also hate automatic seatbelts and we\nboth think having an airbag is a plus.  In general, comfort and\nperformance were both significant.\n\nSome specific +'s and -'s are listed below.\n\nMazda 626\n + very comfortable and roomy\n + can theoretically get ABS on DX model, though in practice this is\n   hard to find\n + base price for base model includes numerous little things like:\n   tach, variable speed wipers, rear defroster, 60/40 split folding rear seat\n - more expensive than many other cars listed below\n\nHonda Civic\n + DX gets significantly better mileage than other cars listed here\n + comfortable front seat\n + adjustable seat belt mounting\n - no ABS without EX model (includes $1000's of other things like a sunroof)\n\nGeo Prizm/Toyota Corolla\n - seats not very comfortable to us (your mileage may vary)\n + adjustable seat belt mounting\n + can get ABS without lots of other extras\n\nSaturn\n + SL2 was quite comfortable, though SL1 less so\n - motorized attack belts\n\nDodge Spirit\n   no real outstanding +'s, but seemed generally ok\n - rear seat does not fold down\n\nChevy Corsica\n + comes with ABS standard\n - lower "would you buy that car again" and safety ratings in\n   Consumer Reports (than first 3 cars above)\n - suspension didn't feel as stiff as the others (this would be a +\n   for some)\n\nThe Honda Accord and Toyota Camry were both more expensive than the\n626, and in our minds, not significantly better.\n\nWe probably gave disproportionately low consideration to the "big 3",\ndue (a) to my wife's family's general dislike of Chrysler products,\n(b) some unimpressive GM products owned by my parents and a housemate\nof mine (c) the Taurus comes with automatic transmission, I find the\nseat of the Tempo very uncomfortable, and the escort has attack belts\nand no air bag.
Does anyone know what the domestic content is of any of these:\nGeo Prizm, Eagle Talon, Ford Probe\n\n?\n\nAll are made in the US, but I have been told they contain mostly\nforeign parts.  Please follow up directly to me, I'll post the\nfindings to the net if there is interest.\n\nThanks!\nTim Newman
This is a tricky situation; if the previous owner didn't inform\nthe dealer of the odometer change, then the previous owner committed\nfraud, and he may be liable. The dealer may also be liable; If the\nprevious owner notified the dealer, or if the previous owner had the \ndash replaced at a dealer, or if the previous owner had the dash changed \nlegally, any records search on the car should turn up the fact that\nthe odometer had been altered.  If a dealer changes the speedometer, he has\nto report it (it goes into the car's service record with the manufacturer,\nand on the title, if I remember correctly; the dealer told me that\nthe old mileage, etc. were sent to Ford when my T-Bird's speedo \nwas replaced). If the odometer can be set to the old mileage, it must \nbe; if it can't (eg, electrically-driven odometers) then the mileage \nof the old odometer must be written on a permanent sticker which is \naffixed to the door frame of the vehicle. \n\nEither way, if the change had been done legally, then a records search\n(which the dealer almost certainly did) should have turned it up.\n\nCall your state's Department of Transportation/Public Safety/Motor\nVehicles--or your tag agent--to find out for certain what your\nrights are. Your state's Attorney General will know for certain ;-)\n\n				James
Geico supports (reads gives to police) Laser Radars.  They have been known \nto be very picky.  No sports cars. No radar detectors (although Maryland \ninsurance board over rules this consistantly). No turbos.\n\nBasically it seems if you need to use your insurance ever they don't want \nyou.  They once told me they wouldn't insure me (perfect record) because of \nmy corvette even though it would be insured by another specialty insurance. \n "We must insure all the cars".  I think this rep didn't know what she was \ntalking about.\n\nGeico is cheap.  But if you ever file a claim be prepared to be dropped.  I \nthink in most areas two tickets will do it.\n\nGeico will never see a dime from me If I can help it.
I just entered the market for a Radar Detector and am looking for\nany & all advice/recommendations/warnings/etc from anyone in \nthis group.\n\nEmail is preferred.
best way to reduce risk when operating a vehicle is being able to avoid\nhazards and, for that reason my preferred vehicle is a motorcycle.  When I do\nuse a four wheeler my primary reasons are: it will keep me dry, it will keep\nme warm, or it will carry more cargo.  If the four wheeler has as much\ncollision protection as the average motorcycle, then it has enough form me.\n\nHow do you define safe?  One definition of safe is without risk.

From article <1993Apr21.190251.14371@sequent.com>, by troy@sequent.com (Troy Wecker):\n  .\n  .\n  .\n\n  .\n  .\n  .\n\nIt sounds like your analysis is based on hypothesis and not\nactually using the Valentine-1.  I'd like to give some feedback based on\nreal life experince.  I keep the Valentine-1 in advanced logic mode\nand it rarely lights up as a Christmas tree.  The only time it does\nis when I am in the middle of a major shopping area and then it makes\nsense that is does since there are >= 8 sources coming from many different\ndirections.  I have found the Valentine-1 to be consistent in its\nreporting of bogeys regardless of any moving cars in the area.\n\nI have found the directional indication to be very useful.  In one case\nthere was two radar traps set up within one mile of each other.  As I\npassed the first radar trap, the direction indication changed.  Then\nthe detector was set off again pointing in the forward direction.  With\nother radar detectors I would have assumed that this was due to a reflection.\nBut with the Valentine-1 I knew there was a high probability that there\nwas another trap.  And there was!\n\nOn other occasions, the directional helped discern a false alarm from\na true alarm.  For example, as I pass a source, the direction indicator\nchanges.  The directional also allows me to focus my attention as to where\nthe signal might be coming from instead of having to look all over the \nplace.  When a car is approaching me from the rear with a detector\nthat leaks, I can tell that the signal is coming from the rear and as the\ncar passes me I can verify the source.  With other detectors, I would\nhave been unable to do this and would have had to assume that there was a radar\ntrap when there was none.\n\nI've had the Valentine-1 for several months now and find its added features\nto be useful and not gimmicks.\n\n                                       -Barry

gimme a break!  you KNOW chevy'd screw that up just like that almost great\ntruck with the "big phat 454".  Have you ever seen the mufflers on that \nthing??it's amazing it moves....(which isn't to say it's not a good idea,\nbut i'm quite sure chevy'd screw it up the same way)
I used to drive a truck a few years back. I once rode with an old codger\nthat had been driving for about 30 yrs. The only time he would use the clutch\nwas to get the truck moving. He could shift that 13 speed lightning quick, up\nor down, without the slightest rake of a gear. He was as smooth as silk. It was\nthe most amazing shifting demonstration I've ever seen! Having said all that I \nstill don't know why anyone would want to shift a synchronized tranny without a\nclutch? Why do it?
Primarily milage.  Gas is much more expensive, so people are very\nconcerned about it taking a few more liters per kilometer.  This,\nalong with narrow old cities, also results in smaller cars with\nsmaller engines.  These engines usually don't have the torque to mesh\nwell with an automatic.  So, having engines that don't work well with\nautos, and a great concern for milage, the usual Euro-car has a\nmanual.\n\n(Note that not many big Benzes come with manuals.  If you've got the\nmoney for the car, you've got the money for the gas, and the engine to\ndrive through the slushbox.)\n\nAs automatics become more efficient, the "bigotry" is probably\nreduced.  Still, everyone knows how to drive a manual, and cars are\ncheaper with one, and it saves a little expensive fuel.  So there\naren't compelling reasons to go automatic.\n\n-dB

There is a known problem with the seals on the taillights of <93 probes.\nComplain loudly to your dealer and get them to install new seals.  It is\na known problem, present on most (if not all) pre-93 Probes, so you \nshouldn't have to pay them to fix it.  In my case, they fixed it on\nmy extended warranty (I just had to pay a $50 deductable) (the\nwork was valued at something like $185 with labor and parts).  Having\nremoved the tail lamps myself on other occasions, I think their estimate\nwas fair.
It seems that there are more and more "bands" available for\npolice radar each month.  I have recently purchased (within\nthe last 8 months) the BEL 966STW.  While it is not a perfect\ndetector by any means, it does do the job fairly well.  \n\nNow, however, I pick up a car magazine at the airport and\nread about this Super Ka Wideband which is a superset of\nthe Ka Wideband that this latest generation of detectors\nwas touted as covering.  \n\nSo now BEL has a NEW series of detectors out that cover all\nthe usual bands (X, K, Ka photo, Ka wideband) as well as the\nnew Super Ka wideband.  \n\nJust as there comes a point of diminishing returns when chasing\nincreased PC computing power with faster and faster CPUs (for\nthe average home consumer, at least), it seems that there is\nnow the same concern with radar detectors.  Does it make sense\nto upgrade just 8 months after purchasing my "new" detector?\nIs Valentine upgrading their equipment?  If so, it might be \nworth it for me to upgrade to the Valentine.  I was in the \nmarket for a Valentine when I purchased the BEL but the\n3-4 month waiting time was just too much for me since I had\ninadequate protection with my Passport.  Life was much simpler\nwhen there was just X and K band and Escort has the best\nequipment on the market and there was no need to continuously\nshop for a new detector.  I hope that the flood of new radar \nbands ceases with this new Super Wideband business.

For the information of those not "lucky" enough to live in the city of\nAustin, TX, if an auto a/c system is checked and found to have leaks,\nit must be repaired at that time, or evacuated.  This is an ordinance\nunique (I think) to the city of Austin.\n\nFreon is subject to increasing taxes, but $12 is about 2X cost here.\nRecovered freon is not required to be "purchased" from the car it is\nwithdrawn from.

let me clarify, i think they both are 2.0 litres.
I was curious as to what people thought of the VW Corrado VR6?\nThat's about it...
-> The current 4.9l V-8 will soldier on for about two years.  A version\n-> of the 32 valve modular V-8 in the Mark VIII could be offered then.\n\nHow unfortunate for anyone who loves the simplicity with which 302 and\n351 Fords and 305 and 350 Chevys can be built up. Still, it will provide\na needed punch for the Ford to stay up with the new Firebird/Camaros. It\nwouldn't surprise me if Ford called the engine a 5.0 litre in the\nMustang. (We all know that the current 5.0 is really 4.9 litres anyway)\n\n-> Undisguised, the car looks OK, but not nearly as exciting as the new\n-> Camaro/Firebird, IMO.\n\nI must agree. I don't think I've seen anything as impressive looking as\nthe new Firebird since my friend back home sold his 1970 Formula 400\nFirebird (for a paltry $2000, without even telling me. The bastard.)
Wouldn't that make them an I4?  Or would they \nreally be an _4 (henceforth referred to as\n"underscore 4")?
BMWs boxer twin! (no two wheelers here?) Been around since 1923. I think the\nother examples are Johnny come latelies... I may be wrong so no flames please..
The 91 and 92 Cruisers run the 4.0L straight 6 which only has about 150hp \nand 220lb-ft of torque.  Plenty off-highway, marginal on the highway.\nThe 93 has a much improved 4.2L straight 6 with >200hp and 275ft-lb torque.\n\n\nIf you take them on rough trails, you'll see the difference.  The Cruiser\nis an order of magnitude better in off-highway ability.
On the subject of the V4,Ford in the UK used V4 engines exstensively in\ntheir Ford Transit vans.This brings back a memory from the seventies.I\nplayed in a band at the time and for something like 180 pounds four of\nus bought a 1967 "tranny" to cart the gear around in.It was in terrible\nshape (cosmetically) because it's last owner was a pig farmer.We spent\ndays cleaning it up and putting in a partition and more seating but 'til\nthe day it died everytime you turned on the fan to the defroster dried\npig shit came flying out the vents!!!.\n    Back to the engine if I remember right it was a 1600cc V4 and that\nthing could haul,we could fill it with equipment and up to 8 people and\nit went like a bat out of hell,of course there were no pollution controls\non the engine and the gas was leaded and higher octane than we get now.\n    When the mechanical fuel pump quit we put in an electric one from a \nMorris Minor that worked great. Ah fond memories.
I think it was the reverse, the V4 being 2/3 of the V6.\n\n\nIt was also the worst engine that Ford (Europe) have ever made - bloody\nawful reputation. It's most successful application being the Transit\nvan.\n\nSaab gave up with this motor and then made the Triumph 1854 (half a Stag V8) under license (I believe), but with 2-litre capacity and perhaps a different\narrangement for the cylinder head studs, before developing their own straight \nfour from the Triumph.
foot in mouth again, drew.  the first generation mr 2's were 1.6's which \nwere very smooth.  i'd be real surprised if the original poster was talking\nabout a 1st generation car.  the second generation cars were 2.2 for the\nnon turbo and 2.0 for the turbo.  i drove the non turbo 2.2 and calling it\nunpleasant is to be kind to it.. \n\n\nwrong and wrong.  mitsubishi owns the patent, which has since expired\nwhich is why everybody with a shred of integrity is putting balance\nshafts into their big 4's.. the notable exception is nissan.. and only\nfor the us market suckers.  i guess we need to write to C&D and start\ntelling them to publish graphs for engine vibration over rpm.  then\nyou'll see usenet discussions of the form: engine A has peak\nvibrations 3 dB less than engine B, therefore engine A is better than\nengine B.\n\n1/2 :-)
Shaz,\n\nHmm.. but the service indicators that I have works this way:\n  There are 5 green,1 yellow, 1 red indicators.\n  initially all green indicators will be on for few minutes when you start\n  your car. The computer will actually "sense" how you drive your car and\n  as time goes by the green indicators will start to go off one by one and\n  then the yellow indicator will turn on and then the red indicator will go\n  on. And you should get service when by the time green indicators are off.\n  \n  After service the mechanic(or you) will reset the service indicators and the\n  computer starts counting again.\n\nSo I expect to have a tool(or a procedure) to reset it so the green lights will \ncome on and the yellow and red lights will go off.\n\nI wonder how people can do oil change themself without knowing how to reset the\nindicator.\n\nIt's the first european car I have and changing oil at 15,000 miles is a \nsurprise to me. and it's a big plus :-). But I wonder how that could happen\nsince the oil lose its lubrication ability over time, I thought it's the oil and\nnot the vehicle that determines how often we should change oil.\n\nAny BMW owner on the net? Response welcomed.\n\nPS.  my initial question is "how do you seset the service indicator of a BMW"
No comparison. The BEL is just a hooped up wideband Escort like detector.\nNo directional indicators, no Bogey counter, no radar signature analysis, no\nremote display option, not as sensitive, not as well built. \nHad it, sent it back!
Hello again.\n\nAnyone here done any tinting work.  What are the best brands out there?\nHow about applications...I heard there was a water based brand that s\nyou can move around, till it's just right, and you then let it dry like that.\n\nAlso I would consider having it professionally done, how much around\nWisconsin or Chcago area, that does a decent job, fairly cheap.

Okay, okay, I know the Ford Probe is made in the US, in fact it's\nmade in Michigan, at a Mazda plant.  My question: are most of the parts\nfrom American or Japanese sources?  I have been told that most of the US\nassembly plants for Japanese automakers import almost all of the parts used in\nthe vehicles.\n\nAny information anyone has on this will be appreciated!
I'm not sure if this made it out so i'll try again.\n\nI have an Ecklar's (sp?) Corvette car cover for sale.  The cover is canvas\non the outside and felt on the inside.  It is weather proof and in great\ncondition.  I'm asking $95.00 and I'll pay shipping.  (originally $175.00\nin October of 1992).
Hahahahahaha.  *gasp*  *pant*  Hm, I'm not sure whether the above\nwas just a silly remark or a serious remark.  But in case there are\nsome misconceptions, I think Henry Robertson hasn't updated his data\nfile on Korea since...mid 1970s.  Owning a car in Korea is no longer\na luxury.  Most middle class people in Korea can afford a car and do\nhave at least one car.  The problem in Korea, especially in Seoul, is\nthat there are just so many privately-owned cars, as well as taxis and\nbuses, the rush-hour has become a 24 hour phenomenon and that there is\nno place to park.  Last time I heard, back in January, the Kim Administration\nwanted to legislate a law requireing a potential car owner to provide\nhis or her own parking area, just like they do in Japan.\n\n	Also, Henry would be glad to know that Hyundai isn't the only\ncar manufacturer in Korea.  Daewoo has always manufactured cars and\nI believe Kia is back in business as well.  Imported cars, such as\nMercury Sable are becoming quite popular as well, though they are still\nquite expensive.\n\n	Finally, please ignore Henry's posting about Korean politics\nand bureaucracy.  He's quite uninformed.
Sorry 'bout that - Mine is a '91 model non-turbo 2.0. (with ABS and revised\nsuspension (whatever revised means)). I'm in Australia, so we always seem to \nget the versions without extras which the Europeans and Americans get as \nstandard.\n\nMy query is, - why does the noise get noticeably LOUDER about 2-3 months after\nan oil change. I just find it a bit wierd that this happens. Is it the oil I'm\nusing (Mobil 1) or is it the engine (the 3S-GE version/model) ie. gets\nnoiser the older the oil is (I'm only guessing). \n\nIts not annoyingly distressing or anything, but just slightly puzzling.
I have this same alarm installed in my Syclone.  It works great.  The shock\nsensor is very sensitive, but much more practical than the motion sensor I have\non my other car.  It doesn't trigger if the car is rocked gently by the wind,\nbut any kind of shock sets it off.  Even kicking the tire sets it off.  It\nworks great.\n\n\nThe shock sensor is adjustable and there are two cycles on it.  You can adjust\nit to be sensitive enough that there is no way you could open the hood without\nsetting off the alarm.  Although, I know that you cannot pop the hood on the\nSyclone without setting off my alarm now, and yet I have had zero (none!) false\nalarms with this system.  The alarm tells you when you disarm it whether it has\nbeen activated in your absence.  I have been able to trace every alarm to it's\ncause and it was not a false alarm.\nI guess it would be possible depending on the vehicle.  My Syclone is so tight\nin the engine compartment that it would be tough to do this.  There are\nsupplemental power supplies you can put on with this Viper alarm, but I don't\nhave one.  I really think that if someone wants my car that bad, the alarm\nwon't keep them from it, even with a supplemental power supply.\n\nThis is primarily for convertibles.  I have a convertible and have looked at\nthis feature in detail.  Alpine actually makes a better radar unit if you want\nto get one of these.  It has zones in it that can be shut down independently so\nthat if one side of your car has pedestrian traffic or something else that\nwould trigger an alarm, it shuts down the zone, or rather, pulls it in tighter.\nI don't see the real benefit to these unless you have a convertible that you\nleave the top down on.\n\nAvoid the voice alarm that can be added to the radar package.  It talks to\npeople as they walk by.  I saw one installed on a Lotus Esprit.  The kids would\ntaunt it seeing how close they could get before it 'warned' them to get back. \nThe owner finally disabled it, which defeats the purpose in my mind.\nI am real happy with my Viper.  One other feature I really like is you can tune\nit to your preferences.  You can have it arm passively or not.  You can disable\nthe chirp for arming/disarming.  You can have it lock/unlock the doors when the\nalarm is armed/disarmed.  \n\nI like these features.  I hate the chirp when the alarm arms/disarms, so mine\nflashes the lights only.  I like the door lock feature, although I have to be\ncareful to take my keys with me because it doesn't know if you have left your\nkeys in the car when it passively arms and locks the doors.  But, if you are\nmeticulous about taking your keys with you, it takes care of the rest.\n\nI looked seriously at the Alpine system too.  It is a real nice system, but\nmore money and it has a motion sensor standard instead of the shock sensor. \nThe shock sensor is better....and the Viper shock sensor is better (2 cycle)\nthan the optional Alpine one, IMHO.  I think the Viper gives you a lot of good\nvalue for the money.  But it isn't absolutely tamperproof.  No system is. \nExcept maybe the one that James Bond had on his Lotus in For Your Eyes Only. \nAnyone know where we can get one of those installed?  Maybe that was what they\nhad in the van in the World Trade Center, huh?>

and didn't you also say that it was easier to add masses than to\nadd balance shafts?  the sad truth is that some makers don't\nbother to put balance shafts on their big shaky 4's..\n\n\nhow about:\n	    1	 3\n	   __    __\n	  |  |  |  |\n	__|  |  |  |   __\n	     |  |  |  |\n	     |__|  |__|\n	\n	       2     4		\n\nif this is ridiculous, kindly explain why.. it's been more than 10 years\nsince i studied this stuff.  :-)\n\n\n\nthe point that they are trying to make is that while everybody settles\nfor the orthodox inline 4, they are using a horizontally opposed 4,\nwhich is unique in that market segment.  and porsche also uses a flat\nsix in their 911, so what's the problem?  i don't see any claim that\ntheir engine is as good as a porsche's.. they are simply pointing out\nthat they use the same configuration as a porsche.. if you want to\nnitpick ad campaigns, i think there are far more blatant excesses than\nthis.
I have both an '84 and an '86 Camry, each with manual 5-speed transmissions.\nThe '84 has about 105,000 miles on it and the '86 about 83,000 miles.  ABout\na year ago I found that the master cylinder on the clutch in the '84 was        \nleaking fluid around the piston seal, leading to air in the system and fluid\nback into the passenger compartment of the car.  I pulled the plunger and\ngot a rebuild kit (new plunger, seal, etc.) and thought I had the problem\nlicked.  Much to my surprise, the same problem developed several months\nlater!  This time I looked carefully at the master cylinder to make sure\nthere were no scratches, burrs, or other obvious causes of the problem.  I\ndidn't find any.  Ever since I have been periodically feeding the clutch\nhydraulins additional fluid and bleeding air from the system.  I knew I\nwould be selling the car and didn't want to go all the way to solving the\nproblem.\n\nI should add that the clutch is original, and that I've had to adjust the\npedal to allow maximum extension of the piston into the master cylinder in\norder to actuate the clutch.\n\nMy hypothesis is that this means that when fully depressing the clutch pedal,\nthe angle of the piston rod (attached to the pedal) is off the axix of the\ncylinder, thus cocking the piston and seal and perhaps deforming it.\n\nWhat do you think of that as an explanation?  Can you suggest a possible fix\nshort of replacing the master cylinder and getting a new clutch put in?\n\nNow the '86: same problem, except that the above diagnosis doesn't explain\nwhy all of the fluid leaked out (by way of the master cylinder, into the\npassenger compartment) while I was on vacation for 10 days, during which\nthe clutch pedal was not depressed or otherwise caused to distort.  What\ncan you suggest here?\n\nMany thanks.  Let's hope I don't end up going to Click and Clack on this...
Yeah, it seems toyota has always had a problem with those 2.2's\nand sound. I know the celicas with em were pretty noisey, and\nthe MR2s were no exception. Now, about large displacement 4s\nwith bad noise.. I have a 90 Grand Am H.O. quad 4, and it\nsounds really good, almost like a larger 6.. Now, Toyota\nis coming out with an all-new Celica next year and the Mr2...\nwell who knows..
Many cars sold here in Finland are *small* and *cheap* cars (at least when\ncompared to other cars --- note that we have over 120 % car tax).\n\nAnd you couldn't expect a good auto mated to a 1.3 L engine?
V4s? I don't know of any. I4s and flat4s are abundant.\n\n\nA whole $h!tload. Minivans, pickups, just about any car above the\nsubcompact/compact range and below the full-size range (with a few\nexceptions).\n\nI6s are much more rare now; the only one I personally know of that's\nstill in production is the venerable Ford 300CID in the F-series pickups.\nI think that Jeep's big 6's are also straight sixes, but I'm not a\nbig Jeep person.\n\n\nWhere are you to not know of V8s? There are Mustangs, Cadillacs,\nLincolns, Camaros, Corvettes, Thunderbirds, all real full-size\npickups, Crown Vics, Chevy Moby^H^H^H^HCaprice ;-), and even a few\nJapanese and European vee-hickles with V8s.\n\nV10 - Dodge Viper; Dodge promises a truck with a V10.\n\n\nDon't Ferarri and Lamborghini both use V-12s extensively?\n\n				James

Yeah, but I hate to follow them with the exhaust at ground level. Not all\ndiesels are well maintained, either, it seems they run for so long that\npeople keep them going long after the top end is worn out.
Just for the record, read your owner's manual before attempting a push start.\nMost manufacturers today do not recommend this (I think the catalytic converter\nis the primary reason - unburned gas goes down to it and may ignite when\nthe converter gets into its operating range).\n\nThe best reason for a manual? Because you like to drive one. I find that its\nmuch easier to develop lazy habits in an auto trans car. Remember, pay \nattention out there - stupidity behind the wheel has still taken more people\nto the morgue than drunk driving. The problem is that we don't revoke peoples\nlicense for stupidity.
Geico has purchased radar guns in several states, I know they have done\nit here in CT.\n\nI have also heard horror stories about people that have been insured by Geico\nfor years and then had 1 accident and were immediately dropped.  And once\nyou've been dropped by any insruance company you become labled a high\nrisk, and end up forking out 3 or 4 times what you should be for insurance.\n\nMy suggestion, stay where you are, or shop around but STAY AWAY from Geico!
Damn straight! As far as I've heard, unless the owner is _very_\nhard up, the GT-40s are not for sale at any price that mere\nmortals could afford.\n\n\nI think the GT-40 actually _is_ street legal, although that particular\nquestion is moot (see the price figures below).\n\n\nI wish I could find my Shelby-American guide; it included the GT-40\nregistry (as of '88 or so). There were precious few of them made \n(fifty is the number that springs to mind; they made just enough\nto qualify for the Manufacturer's Cup, or whichever series it\nwas that Shelby broke Ferarri's 13-year winning streak in in '65),\nand they are all accounted for. The last price I saw estimated on a\nGT-40 was a little bit over $1,000,000 (yes, that's right, ONE MILLION\nUS DOLLARS; it was second only to some worthless piece of Ferrari\nthat it would blow the doors off of ;-).\n\nI don't recall off-hand what the drive configuration was, although\nI'm certain some must have been LHD, as they had to be sold to qualify\nfor racing. The drivertrain was the Ford 427 (hi-riser, I think, \nand/or side-oiler) coupled to various 4-speed transmissions. They\nalso used 3-speed manuals; they had lots of problems with the\noriginal trannys breaking under the load of the 427. Layout was\nrear-engine, rear-drive, with the "bundle of snakes" exhaust\nheaders...I can remeber other bits and pieces of info, but I\ncan't remember whether they applied to the GT-40 or the Shelby\nCobra Daytona Coupe...I'll try and find that reference.\n\n				James
I don't remember the formula's off hand as it has been awhile since\nI took aerodynamics and haven't used the stuff since. \nThe Cd is related to the drag force which is what effects top speed and\nfuel consumption. When the drag force on the car or aircraft is greater\nthan what the vehicle's engine can overcome it has reached its top speed.\n(autos of course also have to overcome rolling resistance)\nSince drag opposes the vehicle's motion, the engine must make up for that\nby burning more fuel. Anyway, since the geometery of an auto is rather\ncomplex, the Drag,pressure coeffiecent,etc is either found experimentaly, or\nusing a numerical method.\n\nanyway for flow around a cylinder the drag coeff is:\n\n            Cd = d/(q*2R)\n\n       where d is the drag force, q the flow velocity and R is the radius\nof the clyinder.\n   To get a rough (very rough) estimate, you can set R at 1/2 the car's\nwidth, q at the car's speed and knowing the Cd, find the drag force that\nthe car would need to overcome.
You Ford vs Chevy people must live in the planet of Detroit or Droid.\n\nLike they say in the airforce, with enough horsepower anything will fly.\n\nI can put a 32valve V-8 with twin Garret-4s on Yugo and get 7.7sec QM.\nThats useless ... Its still a Yugo that will loose any race on a track,\nor on the street.\n\nHave you Detroit beings compared the ultra-long-throw stick shifts of\nthe 5.0 with the 93 MR2 turbo or 93 RX7 (I ll buy it in 6 mos) ?\n\nOr the Torsen differential of the RX7 compared to the Differential of \nthe 5.0 that sounds in every hairpin turn ?\n\nAnd bythe way 5.0 and Camaro both have drums on the rear breaks ...\nHello , this is the 90 's ?\n\nVlasis Theodore\nSoftware Engineer

Check out the shocks where they mount, at both ends. if you have\n    the type that have a loop?,from lack of a better term, and a bolt like\n   piece sticking through, there should be a rubber bushing between the loop\n   and the bolt.

Well, this isn't the right group for this, but I have to say that I don't\nthink violence is any more socially acceptable now, by any means.  How\ncan you say that when we used to have of pistol-toting gunslingers as \nheros, or even gangland thugs being considered romantic.  Do you think\nour great grandparent got yelled at by their parents for playing cowboys\nand indians?  I don't think so.  That behavior was somewhat encouraged\nback then, in fact.\nI think the only difference between now and then is that nowadays, when\nsome teenager kills another one in a classroom in California, we here \nabout it in MA the same day.  Back in the old days, they'd never hear \nabout something like that, period. \n\nSorry about posting to rec.autos, but this is where it came up...\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        ___          \n       / _ \                 '85 Mustang GT                        Bob Pitas\n      /    /USH              14.13 @ 99.8                      bpita@ctp.com\n     / /| \                  Up at NED, Epping, NH           (Cambridge, MA)\n\n                           "" - Geddy Lee (in YYZ)\nDisclaimer: These opinions are mine, obviously, since they end with my .sig!

: \n: I am considering buying a 1993 Chevy or GMC 4x4 full-size pickup with\n: the extended cab.  Any opinions about these vehicles?  Have there been\n: any significant problems?\n: \n: -- \n: Dick Grady           Salem, NH,  USA            grady@world.std.com\n: So many newsgroups, so little time!\n\n\nI bought a brand new 1992 Chevrolet K2500 HD 4x4 extended cab last\nMay.  It has had many, many problems.  See my earler post that describes\nthe situation.  I went to BBB arbitration, and they ruled that Chevrolet\nmust buy it back from me.  If you do get one, stay away from the 5 speed\nmanual with the deep low first gear.  They have put three of them in my\ntruck so far.  After about 1,500 miles, overdrive either starts\nrattling or hissing loudly.  There is no way to fix them.  Chevrolet \nsays that the noise is "a characteristic of the transmission."\n\nAlso, if you are planning to use your truck to tow, the\ngear ratios in that tranny suck.  On a steep hill, you get up to about\n55 MPH in second gear at 4,000 RPM (yellow line).  If you shift to third,\nthe RPM drop to only 2,500, and you begin to loose speed.  I should\npoint out that the 350 V8 they put in the HD (8600 GVW) trucks is a\ndetuned motor compared to the one they put in the light duty ones.  They\ndropped the compression ratio, supposedly for "engine longevity"\nreasons.  So the light duty 350 may pull better than my truck does.\nOther things that have gone wrong include the ventilation fan (3 times \nso far), paint (had specs of rust embedded in the paint from being\nshipped by rail with no covering), and suspension parts (link between\nstabilizer and control arm fell off).\n\nAny company can make a bad individual car, Chevrolet included.  What\nreally bothered me was the way they reacted.  They made no attempt\nto deal with me except to tell me to take it back to the dealer for \nthem to attempt to fix it one more time.  So I bought a brand new\nFord F250 HD Super Cab with a 460 and an automatic.  I will never\nbuy another Chevrolet.
I also experience this kinda problem in my 89 BMW 318. During cold\nstart ups, the clutch seems to be sticky and everytime i drive out, for\nabout 5km, the clutch seems to stick onto somewhere that if i depress\nthe clutch, the whole chassis moves along. But after preheating, it\nbecomes smooth again. I think that your suggestion of being some\nhumudity is right but there should be some remedy. I also found out that\nmy clutch is already thin but still alright for a couple grand more!

Please explain the why of this. I have over 200k miles usage of clutchless\nshift and no problems.
If everything I've read is correct, Ford is doing nothing but "re-\nskinning" the existing Mustang, with MINOR suspension modifications.\nAnd the pictures I've seen indicate they didn't do a very good job\nof it.  \n\nThe "new" mustang, is nothing but a re-cycle of a 20 year old car.
Good for you.  I am convinced that someone should start a boycott \nagainst GEICO.  Any takers?
I have a 90 Eagle Talon and I wanted a pair of GTS \nHeadlight covers.  Actually, they are turning signal\ncovers since the Talons that year had pop-up lights.\nI went to a auto shop and bought the tail-light \nblackouts for $45, but they did not have the turning\nsignal covers in stock.  I asked how much it would be\nand he told me it would cost me another $40.  I thought\nthis was a bit high for two small pieces of plastic.\nCan anyone find me a cheaper pair or even a used one?
I am in the market to buy a used car. I am particularly\ninterested in the Pontiac Bonneville. My budget is between 7-\n8 thousand. Would I be able to afford an 88 or 89. What\nengines were available at this time. I know they didn't\nredesign until the 1992 model year. How is the reliability of\npast models. I would appreciate any advice or information.
Are 180 degree V-6 "Flat-Six" engines???
Ego Trip...
was\nYuppies\nstarted\nYep, that's when I noticed it too. I stopped replacing the hood badge  \nafter the second or third one (at $12.00 each).\n\n2002 drivers used to flash their headlight at each other in greeting. Try  \nflashing your headlights at a 318i driver and see what kind of look you  \nget. They usually check their radar detector...they think you're alerting  \nthem to a cop.
Me too!
which flat 4 engines have I4 style cranks?\n\n\ni am 99.99% sure that subaru (and porsche) use the boxer configuration\nand not the inline 4 crank that you analyzed and compared. would you\ncare to re-evaluate the other case of a flat four?  i think that this\nconfiguration is perfectly balanced as far as primary, secondary\nforces and couples are concerned.  i have an article in front of me\nthat says so.\n\n\nthe flat four is also shorter than an inline 4, so even if it is mounted\nlongitudinally it will not take up lots of length.. and a longitudinal\nplacement is easier for a 4 wheel drive drivetrain.\n\ni think that subaru's ads hold water.  in practice, their flat fours\nare noticeably smoother than inline 4s and completely buzz free,\nthough some may not like its peculiar note.  but as alfa has shown, a\nboxer four can produce a spine tingling scream that only the likes of\nrecent hondas can approach.
The question is not whether your radio will be stolen.  The question is\nwhen your radio will be stolen.
And I thought the nutters were the ones throwing the bricks from the\nbridge.......\n\n\nAn institution?

I once had a sparking problem with my '65 Mustang, and simply changing\nthe spark plug wires fixed it.
Yeah, People act really shocked about violence, as though it were new\nto our species...\n\nWhat about the holocaust? The crusades? The Salem witch trials? The\nreligious persecutions of the middle-ages? \n\nWhat about violent acts carried out in the name of religion all over\nthe world? What about the early Christians put to death by the Romans?\nThe Jews persecuted by Christians?\n\nThere are a lot more humans today than there have ever been. I do not\nknow the stats, but there are far more people on the planet than there\nwere 2 or 3 hundred years ago! The per capita acts of violence are\nprobably not significantly different than they were a hundred or a\nthousand years ago!\n\nThere is nothing new about violence.
Having recently purchased a 93 Probe with clear-coat paint, I \nwould like to give it a good wax job.  What is the Best type of\nwax to use for this type of finish?  Is paste or liquid better?\nI would be waxing it by hand, and buffing it by hand, I guess\nusing cheesecloth to buff it (anything better you would suggest?).\n\nI've heard comments here before about things like Turtle Wax\nand Raindance not being very good, so I'm wondering what is\nrecommended for a quality finish.\n\nThanks in advance.\nBill
'63 to '82 vettes had the same basic chassis. 1980 add aluminum (weaker) \nrear 'axle' housing.  All these years used same brakes, similar springs etc\n  Late 70's was a bad year for GM reliability.  Catastrophic converter was \nadded in 1975.\n\nCheapest corvette '78 to '79 low end about 4k tops out about $12k except \nfor those morooons that think there '78 indy / 25th aniversity vette is \nspecial.  These guys have been known to ask 25K.  I don't think they get it\n.\n\nBest buy: convertables 69 - 74.  I got my 69 for 5K - needs body work but \nI'm willing.  \n\nParts for all are readily avail at swap meets and mail order etc.\n\nV-8 reliability / looks / independant suspension / 4 wheel disk and all \nunder 10K.  And they thought a miata was a good deal.\n\n\nMy origional inquires to my insurance agent: I can drive my '69 convertable \nfor 3000 miles or less per year, I must keep it in a locked garage and it \nwill cost me 2% of the stated value per year (does this sound right?).\n\n\nGet an appraiser to look at the car. He will check serial numbers and look \nfor origional equipe.  Depending on what mods have been done the car could \nbe worth only 10K.  Problems like wrong engine / trans.  Wrong paint type (\nvetts used lacquer)  An modification would reduce tthe value.  But your \nlooking for a car to drive right?\n\nThis sounds like a ball park price for a small-block (327 cu in.) / manual \n/ no air car.  A 427 would put it closer to $30K.
You know, I'm a Ford fan, I must say, so I'm looking forward to the next\nMustang.  I have faith that it will be a fine product, more desireable\nthan the Camaro is now.  You know, that's MHO.  \n\nThe differences these days between Ford and GM are not so much the quality,\njust the philosophy.  It used to be quality _and_ philosophy.  GM is\nbarely catching up, but they have more room for improvement that\ncan only be made up in time.  STSs still come off the assembly line\nwith screwed up paint stripes and poor trunk/door/hood/panel alignments;\nit's those 75 year old plants.  And the latest GM products still come\nwith the standard equipment RattleDash (tm).  But like I said, they're\ngetting better and making the move in the right direction.\n\nThey beat Ford to the market with the Camaro/Firebird, but really only\nin words.  Production of these vehicles will be limited until the\nend of the year, keeping selling prices above MSRP for the most part\nsince there are so many twitching Camaro fans out there.  I wouldn't\npress Ford to hurry the Mustang since the final wait could be worth it.\nBesides, no bow-tie fanatic is gonna buy the Mustang anyway.\n\nI do not put much stock in the mag rags' "inside" information, or even\nFord rep quotes.  The Taurus was pretty much a surprise when it was\nfinally disclosed in it's entirety.  "Inside" information had the\nTaurus with a V8 and rear-wheel drive at one point.  I wouldn't look\nfor a simple re-paneled Mustang, folks; you may be cheating yourself\nif you do.  There's a lot of potential.  Ford hasn't released a new\ncar without a 4-wheel IS in 7 years.  The Mustang project has been\nbrewing for at least 4, right?  A 4-wheel IS could happen.  Those\nmodular V8's are out there, too.  In the interest of CAFE and\ncompetition, don't rule those out, either.   Your ignorant if you do.\nAnd there are so many spy shots and artist renderings out there,\nwho really knows what it'll look like?  The Mach III?  Doubt it.\nHighly.\n\nThe next Mustang will be Ford's highest profile car.  It attracts\nway more attention than the Camaro/Firebird because it's heritage\nis more embedded in the general public.  Don't lie to yourself and\nbelieve Ford will forfeit that.\n\nI submit that the Mustang will be a success.  Enough to elicit\ndefensive remarks from some heavy Camaro fans here.  You know,\nintelligent, critical spews like, "The Mustang bites, man!"  Some of\nyou are already beginning.  I predict that the Mustang and Camaro\nwill be comparable performers, as usual.  I predict that the\ndifferences will be in subjective areas like looks and feel, as usual.\nThe Camaro is still a huge automobile; the Mustang will retain its\ncab-rearward styling and short, pony-car wheelbase.  The Camaro still\nreaches out to the fighter pilot, while the Mustang will appeal to\nthe driver.  The Camaro will still sell to the muscle car set, while\nthe Mustang will continue to sell to the college-degreed muscle car set.\nBoth will be more refined (I do think the Camaro is).  There will be\nno clear winner.\n\nUnless the Ford gets the 32v, 300hp Romeo.  You don't seriously believe\nthat it was designed for the Mark VIII only, do you?\n\n:^)\n\nRegards,\n\nBrian\n\nbqueiser@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI am the engineer, I can choose K.
I agree with Gaia. Even though the Saturn has proved to be a very reliable car\nso far, a little money spent now is worth the peace of mind.\n\nIn my opinion, getting the PowerTrain warranty is enough. In my case, that's be\ncause; anything that needed repairing in the interior (sunroof, windows, doors,\n etc.) I could do myself. I just didn't want to mess with the engine and such.\n\nPlus I think the extra 3 years of 24-hour RoadSide Assistance must be worthe so\nmeting. I opted for the 5 year plan for $375.
Did youy guys know that it is LEGAL to own a radar detector but is ILLEGAL\nto use it! Isn't that a bit like owning a gun but not being allowed to use it?\nMy mate just switches his off whenever the cops are around.
The DeLorean had the yucky PRV V6 engine. A joint-venture between Peugout (note \nspelling), Renault and Volvo. PRV. This engine is a *MIGHTY BORING* piece of\njunk with approx 140hp. Doesn't like revs at all.\n\nIf you look at the DeLorean in the movie Back To the Future you will note\nthat they changed the engine sound to a big V8. A real DeLorean doesn't sounds\nhalf as good. You will also note that every time they have to spin the tires\nin the movie the ground is all wet. This is because a DeLorean can't make\na burnout on a dry road! The weak engine thats mounted over the rear axle\nmakes it almost impossible.
Bob: Excellent! To the point and correct! Spread the word.
I am a little confused on all of the models of the 88-89 bonnevilles.\nI have heard of the LE SE LSE SSE SSEI. Could someone tell me the\ndifferences are far as features or performance. I am also curious to\nknow what the book value is for prefereably the 89 model. And how much\nless than book value can you usually get them for. In other words how\nmuch are they in demand this time of year. I have heard that the mid-spring\nearly summer is the best time to buy.
I want one, and I don't want to move to Europe to buy one.  Please make\nit the next Pontiac F-Car.  Of course I'll have to wait 'till 2003 to buy it...

Could someone explain how to make sense of drag coefficients (i.e Cd) mentioned in magazines.  I understand that lower numbers signify better aerodynamics but\nwhat does this mean in the real world.  Is there a way to calculate new top speeds(assuming the car is not rev limited at top speed) or mileage benefits if a identical car had the Cd reduced from .34 to .33.
Note: BMW doesnt always follow this convention.
Enough, already. Let's take this discussion to some other newsgroup\nthat's more appropriate. Most of us are tired of it and would like to \nget back to old cars, IMHO.
It's been a while since I've reviewed a car but today I paid a visit\nto an old friend whose love for Audis has been so overwhelming that he\nmakes a not too sucessful living selling them.\n\nWithout further delay, I will get to the 1993 Audi S4:\n\n\n1) Servotronic steering:\n\n[For those who are not familiar with what Servotronic is, it is the\nname for the speed variable power steering manufactured by ZF and\nused in Audis and BMWs.]\n\nI have been outspoken in my damming of Servotronic over the past\ncouple of months, and this was based on magazine reviews and drives of\nthe Audi 90 CS quattro and the Audi 100CS fwd.  I am quite happy to\nreport now that on the S4, the Servotronic is *inoffensive*.  I\nsuppose that due to the fat gumball tires, the Servotronic has been\nloaded up more and this, so far has been the best implementation that\nI have tried.  It is far from perfect, mind you, and I'd be much\nhappier if it was an option that I could refuse, but on the S4, I no\nlonger consider this to be bad enough where I feel the entire car is\nruined.\n\nThe steering is still a tad too light, but it is accurate and I\nsuppose the stiffly sprung chassis sends back so much information that\nsome makes it through to the driver's hands.  So there is feel and\nthere is accuracy in the S4's steering.  But there is also room for\nimprovement.  I consider the S4's steering to be better than the\nJapanese competition, primarily because the Japanese do not believe in\n"feel" and engineer it out completely.\n\n\n2) Engine\n\nWheee! What a pressure cooker.  With just 110 miles on the clock I did\nnot expect the S4 to be producing anywhere close to what it will be\nputting out 10000 miles later, but still, the car packs a terrific\npunch.  For a turbocharged machine, it is very unusual in that it\nencourages lazy driving.  i.e. low revs, high gear.  It is so\nsupremely flexible that one could hardly believe that there's only 2.2\nliters of displacement to move this 3700 pound car around in such a\nfashion.  With maximum torque available at 1950 rpm and a 7200 rpm\nredline, the car can pretty much be left in third all day.. which\ntranslates to a speed range of something like 20-100 mph.  A\nchracteristic that one normally associates with large capacity V8s.\nThe technical achievement is breadthtaking.\n\nThrottle response is right up there with a good atmospheric engine. In\nfact, it would even put peaky multivalve engines to shame. Downshifts\nare almost unnecessary.  It is more fun to use the "overboost" feature\nthan to rev the engine.  For those not familiar, the S4 engine features\nup to 15 seconds of additional turbo boost for passing.  Sort of like\nlighting up the after burners in a jet fighter, one could, with the\nright foot only, in third gear, blast the car from 30 to 80 in just a\nfew moments.. simply by flooring the gas.  As far as the numbers go,\nmaximum torque available in overboost mode shoots up to about 270 lb\nft.. incredible for a 2.2 liter.  It takes a few moments for it to\ndevelop overboost but it is well worth waiting for.  Since this is quite\na heavy car, one's body parts are not flung around like say, the Corrado\nVR6.  The acceleration is smooth and strong, somewhat similar to riding\nin a jetliner as it accelerates down the runway on takeoff.  Also, one\nis treated to a very distinctive and entertaining whistle from the\nturbo.. the only entertaining sound to come out of a very\nrefined but bland sounding 5 banger..\n\nYes, Audi has refined the 5 to the point where at 7200 rpm it sounds as\nserene as it does at 2000.  The smoothness is outstanding, but not quite\nup to the standards of a very good 6, e.g. a 12 valve BMW.  I'd say that\nin terms of refinement, i.e. willingness to rev, smoothness, lack of\nharshness under full acceleration it is better than many V6s.  However,\nlost in the refinement process is the characteristic 5 cylinder bark\nthat made the older engines so characterful, if not terribly refined.\nThe 20 valve turbo 5 sounds pretty bland except for the whistle under\nfull boost.  Subjectively, I'd rate the VW VR6 engine as being far more\nmusical than the turbo 5.. Also, Audi's own V8 is also far more musical,\nwith a rorty race car growl when pressed,  though none of these can\nmatch its grunt.\n\nThe only hint of the engine's true capacity occurs when one is taking\noff from rest after the turbo has come to a near stop.  With the extra\ninertia from the permanently engaged 4wd system, one has to be somewhat\ndelicate in feeding in the clutch to prevent an embarassing stall. \nAlternately one could use more revs.. In both cases a very small price\nto pay for such a fantastic engine.  I think that Audi of America should\noffer an automatic option for this car, just as they offer (though in\nextremely small numbers) a 5 speed for the much peakier V8.  The\ncharacteristics of the engine are perfect for an automatic.  Ironically,\nin europe a slush is available but none is offered for the land of the\nslush.  Marketing twits rearing their ugly heads again...\n\n\n3) Chassis\n\nI've noticed that Audis tend to have very wide wheels and relatively\nmodest tire widths.  The car comes with Firestones of size 225/50 ZR16..\nwhich is not uncommon at all.  However, the very attractive 5 spoke\nwheels are no less than 8 inches wide, so there is no sidewall bulge\nwhatsoever.  Combined with the flared wheel arches, the S4 has a mouth\nwatering macho, yet subdued look. \n\nOn rough concrete, it becomes immediately clear that the new 100 body\nstyle has made significant advances in structural rigidity as well as\nroad noise suppression.. I suppose the two are inter-related, but I\ndigress.  To use a cliche, the S4's body feels like it has been carved\nout of stone.  Flex is totally undetectable, even when going over rough\nroads.  With a super rigid body like this stiff springs and stiff dampers\ndo not cause excessive harshness and while the S4's ride quality will\nnever worry a Lexus, it will also not draw comparisons to trucks or\npony cars.\n\nThe servotronic steering has already been mentioned.  I consider it to\nbe inoffensive because it did not inhibit spirited cornering.  I  was\nable to test the car's cornering powers without too much trepidation. I\nthink a new concept is at work in this car.  With its fat gumball tires,\ntalking about understeer or oversteer is practically meaningless.  On a\nbanked highway on ramp, I went in slow and started applying power as I\nwent around.  I could feel the g forces build to the point where the\nskin on my face was being tugged sideways.  Yet the car was totally and\ncompletely obedient to throttle and steering inputs.. It felt that the\nlimits were not even close to being approached.  The g forces were\nthrilling, but the entire affair of going around a curve is strangely\nuninvolving.  You tell the car what you want and it does it.  End of\nstory.  I think that I am starting to relate more and more to those\nreviewers who were highly impressed by the Honda NSX's clinical\nefficiency but were unable to fall in love with the car.\n\nThe brakes have a very good firmness to them and stop the car pretty\nwell too, though I've read that they are prone to fade.  I am not too\nsurprised, since the S4 does not have uprated brakes over the base Audi\n100 fwd. Harder pads would help, but that in turn would lead to a more\nwooden response when cold.  I am starting to see a trend among the\nluxury/sports sedan makers where extra weight is not being offset by\nadditional braking capacity.  The LS400's fade performance is nothing to\nbrag about; neither is the Q45's or the Legend's.  Brake fade these days\nseem to be a forgotten virtue when everybody's attention is focused on\nanti-lock capability.\n\n\n4) Comfort\n\nFor a car with such sporty abilities, its comfort levels are also\nexcellent.  The cabin is beautifully appointed, with carbon-fiber panel\ninserts in place of the wood trim of the '92 S4.  All the expected\ngizmos are there.. heated seats, power seats, seat memory, power this\nand that.  The glaring ommision was the trip computer, which was removed\nbecause Audi hasn't gotten it to work reliably yet.. That means that the\ncar has no boost gauge.  A real disappointment taking into account how\nmuch the turbo dominates its performance.  \n\nUnusual for the germans, the S4 comes with a Honda style moonroof, as\nwell as the very intelligent dial-a-sunroof-position rotary switch.\n\nNoise levels, including engine and tire noise is so low that I wouldn't\nconsider the Lexus' advantage in this area to be significant enough\nto sway a potential buyer.\n\n\n5) Conclusion\n\nEven though few will be able to afford an Audi S4 at its sticker price\nof $48K, the car is a bargain if one takes into account what it has to\noffer over the competition.  The 20 valve turbo 5 is a real gem, even if\nit doesn't produce Ferrari sounds.  No other luxury/sports sedan maker\noffers the utter security of quattro all wheel drive, which to some is\nworth the extra money all by itself.  The safety features are also \ntop notch.. 1994 side impact standard compliant, the very elegant \nautomatic seat belt tensioners and the dual airbags.  The 100 series\nAudis have been outstanding in government crash tests.  It gets my\nthumbs up for being so overwhelmingly capable rather than being\nall out exciting and intoxicating.

We were at a dealership today looking at buying a car and\nthe salesman was showing us something he was calling a\n"buy back".  Is that a car that was fleeted and then\ngiven back for the new model the next year?  If that\nis so, how many miles is a good number to have on it\nand are these types of cars generally a good buy?

Rich,\n	First of all you might want to join the VetteNet (vettes@chiller.compaq\n	.com)  during your search/acquisition of the 67.  $20k sounds about \n	right for a wrong engine, condition 3 car.  This means that the car may\n	not have significant investment value but could be an excellent driver\n	and or hobby car.  You will also want to get a copy of the Corvette\n	Black Book immediately.  Don't leave home (to look at Vettes) without it.\n	Since you are contemplating spending >$20k, you might want to invest a\n	few hours in reading the "Corvette Buyer's Guide" and purchase Noland\n	Adams' tape "How to Buy a Corvette."  The tape shows you how to check\n	for damage, etc..  There are many many factors that will affect the\n	value, road worthiness, and repair expense of your proposed 67.  The\n	list is much too long to go into here.  Join the VetteNet where\n	there are over 100 current Corvette owners (many with 60s vintage\n	vettes) that are available to help you.  The pubs I mentioned above\n	are available from Mid-America Designs (800) 637-5533 and several\n	other Corvette parts sources.  Good luck!!!
Here is a press release from the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\n Energy Secretary Hails President's Plan For Alternative Fuel\nVehicles\n To: National Desk, Environment and Energy Reporters\n Contact: Larry Hart of the U.S. Department of Energy, 202-586-5806\n\n   WASHINGTON, April 21  -- Secretary of Energy\nHazel R. O'Leary today said President Clinton's Executive Order on\nAlternative Fuels will make the federal government a "driving force\nbehind efforts to increase the availability of both alternative\nfuel vehicles and fuel supplies."\n   President Clinton signed the order today, which calls for\nfederal purchases of alternative fuel vehicles in numbers over the\nnext three years at least 50 percent higher than those called for\nin the Energy Policy Act of 1992.\n   President Clinton also announced that Texas Land Commissioner\nGary Mauro will head up the Federal Fleet Conversion Task Force to\nadvise O'Leary on implementation of the Executive Order.\n   "I am delighted that I will be working with Gary Mauro to make\nthis happen," O'Leary said.  "As Land Commissioner, Gary Mauro has\nhelped make Texas a national leader in converting the state fleet\nto alternative fuels, and has been a tireless proponent of natural\ngas vehicles in speeches across the country."\n   The task force is to issue a report within 90 days recommending\na plan and schedule of implementation.\n   "The Department of Energy and all of us in government must lead\nby example if the option of alternative fuels is going to become a\npractical, affordable choice for fleet owners across the country,"\nO'Leary said.  "Increased use of domestically-produced alternative\nfuels means reducing pollution while creating jobs.  We believe\nthat energy efficiency, protecting the environment, and a healthy\neconomy are complimentary goals."\n   O'Leary said that plans call for the Department of Energy to\ncoordinate the agencies' five-year purchase plans, help with\nfunding for extra purchase or conversion costs, and work with GSA\nto encourage development of the fuel infrastructure needed to make\nfleet conversions practical.\n   Under the order, the Department of Energy will also be working\nwith states, local governments and industry to coordinate vehicle\npurchases and encourage manufacturers and fuel suppliers to make\nalternative fuel vehicles and alternative fuels more widely\navailable.\n -30-
: But waiiiiiit, isn't Nissan officially registering the car as far as\n: government paperwork goes, Nissan Stanza Altima, to avoid costly and\n: lengthy paperwork? I read this on the net a while ago, and someone\n: actually may have said there's a little Stanza logo on the Altima\n: somewhere.\n\nI just bought an Altima (and like it very much) and yes there is a\nlittle Stanza logo ever so discretely placed on the trunk. The Altima is\nemblazoned in big silver letters, but the itsy-bitsy Stanza is shunted\nto the far left of the trunk lid. You can only see it if you get up\nclose to the car and know where to look. It is very inconspicuous.\n\nIn fact my first clue that this was a Stanza was that the owners manual\ncalled the car a Nissan Stanza Altima.\n\nAnybody know *why* Nissan did it this way?

Hi there, maybe you can help me...\n\nI have an '88 Corolla with a 5 speed as the subject line says.  The gearbox\nseems excessivly clunky.  I used to have an '85 Corolla, and it was also \nsomewhat clunky, but it had 30,000 more miles on it, and it wasn't nearly as\nbad as this car!  Is there fluid in the 5speed case?  If there is, could it\njust be low, or in need of a change?  As I recall, only the autos have fluid.\nOr am I just mistaken?  Please no flames for owning an import.  I also have\nan old Dodge, but it's not in very good shape these days...

They changed the lights and slope of the hood, along with the new\ngrille.  Otherwise, it is unchanged.\n\nInterestingly, their lack of wood and lack of a grille was a BIG\ndesign statement... they tried to defy conventional wisdom and carve\ntheir own niche ... unfortunately, sales were only half those of the\nLEXUS and hence, they now join the pack.

Only if you want to stop. Seriously though, every 2 years you should\nhave this done. Brake fluid absorbs water over time, the water becomes\nsteam when the fluid gets hot, and steam compresses. You'll also have\nbetter luck with the longevity of master cylinder, calipers and brake\nlines.

Well, you can just about set your watch by Honda releasing new models every\n4 years and an upgrade half way through the cars life. The local acura\ndealership tells me that the new Integra will be out very soon, i.e. May/June.\n\nIts hard to find specific details as the Integra has been deleted from\nmost of the rest of the world - I have seen them in Canada and Australia\nas well as the U.S. but it was discontinued after the first generation\nin Europe.

To replace the engine and\ntranny have to be pulled as a unit.

In many of our cities, there are traffic signals every 100 feet (unsynchronised,\nof course (well here in Ottawa anyway)) and the roads are so congested that \nshifting manually is a real pain in the left foot.  Also, most Canadians are\ntoo stupid to learn how to shift manually (gee, I gotta co-ordinate my two\nfeet on the clutch, brake _and_ accelerator, and I gotta steer, shift _and_\noperate the signals (optional) and radio with my two hands... duh... it \ncan't be done).  Also, most North American made cars come with the automatic \nas standard equipment, so why bother with a manual when the car can shift \nfor you for no addition money.
Actually, that'd be 155 mph and 60 mph (the legal speed limit for trucks) \nin *two* lanes, each direction. It's a hell of a rush when those trucks fly \nby. (or was that me flying by them? Who cares, the rush is really something \nelse, and so is the draft)
Yeah, diesels are cleaner than petrol powered cars. They even have catalysts \nfitted to disels now! Oh and Citroen have even launched the 'First sports \ndiesel car in the world'. Which is probably true if you assume if its for \nproduction purposes (Merc-Benz had a prototype which runs on diesel back in \naround 1968..... it did - and read this! - 200 MPH!!!)\n							....Shaz....
If I'm going to drive on a public road then I need a\nspeedometer, and an odometer helps for navigation.\n \nMy 1965 Chevy has a bare minimum:  Engine-temp and\nOil-press warning lights and a fuel gauge. \n\nMy 1983 VW has tach, water-temp, voltmeter \nand oil-temp gauges. \n \nIf I had a turbo car, I'd want a vacuum manifold/boost\ngauge.  An oil pressure gauge is a nice, reassuring\ngauge to look at.  If my car was air cooled, then I\nwould substitute a cyl-head-temp gauge for the water-temp\ngauge.\n \nA few years ago, I looked at the Audi Quattro Si Coupe\nthat Bobby Unser used to win the 1986 Pikes Peak Hill Climb.\nThe gauge layout, from left to right, top to bottom was:\n \n----------------------------------\n \nspeedometer\n \n----------------------------------\n \nfuel                  tranny\npress                 temp\n \n----------------------------------\n \ndifferential           water\ntemp                   temp\n \n----------------------------------\n \nbig orange             tach\noil-press\nwarning light\n \n----------------------------------\n \noil-temp               boost\n \n----------------------------------\n \noil-press\n \n----------------------------------
Believe Bugatti's coming(has) out  one.  Something like 4 turbos\nand mucho macho HP.  One cool price too, as i heard.  At any rate,\nthe point is, i'm pretty sure there is, indeed, one in production...\ntho rather limited..
Since we're on the subject of brakes.... does anyone know why a 4WD Vauxhall/\nOpel disengages drive to the rear wheels when the brakes are applied? Vauxhall\nboast about how the car is more stable in fwd mode during braking than in 4wd\nmode.... how is this so? \n						...Shaz...
It isn't that bad.  At least the Bugatti EB110 has compound curves compared\nto the slab sides on the Consulier.  And the Bugatti has a quad turbo V-12\n(thing of it as 4 three cylinder turbo engines tied together).  Also Ettore\nBugatti's nephew is on the board of directors and had a hand in the\ndevelopment.  So that's about as much Bugatti as you are likely to get in\ntoday's world.  Much like Enzo Ferrari's illegitamate son being allowed to\ntake over part of Ferrari as well... \n\n\nThat's funny.  I have motorcylclist friends who say the same about `cages'. \n:-)\n\nMost GP 500cc motorcycles are V-4s, and the VF line of Hondas were all V-4s\n(from the VF-400F through the VF-1000F, including the RC30 race bike and\nthe present VFR-750F).  It should be noted that Lancia built a V-4 in\nrecent history in the Fulvia HF, a very pretty Italian coupe.
What???  I heard there was a new engine slated for the mustang...something\nlike 280hp  (ok, it was from one of their other lines...)...\n\n--
this is an interesting point.  some people are not really buying the coverage,\nthey are buying 'peace of mind', marketing folks love selling that.  i suggest\nthat people *choose* to not engage their minds in peaceless worry rather than\nbuying that 'peace of mind'.
The clutch on my '92 Honda Civic EX-V (EX in the U.S.) does this too.\nIt's annoying.  Now that I think about, it _is_ worse when the humidity is\nhigh.  The dealer also claims there's nothing they can do since the clutch is \na "self-adjusting hydraulic design".  Yeah, right.
it hauls butt, handles nice, but is junk.  i drove a brand new one for a day\nas a loaner.  the key was already rusting...seems they stamp their keys out\nof pot-metal.  all the controls seemed really junk...clutch was heavy.\ndoor locks, power buttons, sunroof controls etc.  seemed really cheap.\nno way i would pay 24k for this baby.  no airbag either.  i also drove a svx\nfor a day...stickered at 30k, but going out the door for 21k...a much better\nbuy, imo.  although it is more of a sports touring coupe...roomy etc.\nthe corrado is more of a small sports car.  the ergonomics and leather in the\nsvx was twice as nice as the corrado's.  both had smooth strong engines.
Same engine, different state of tune (less hp and maybe more torque). My\nfriend at work regularly takes 6 people in his and it seems to haul around\njust fine.
