This is not at all comparable. Christianity is the main stream in\nwestern culture. You are trivializing the experiences of others.\n\nI remember what it was like being "different" as a Christian. We\nwere told all the time that we were different, and in fact that\nonly members of the our church were really Christians (though others\nwho believed in God weren't as bad as atheists), so we were a small\nminority. That was nothing compared to being an atheist.\n\nThe only thing comparable would be a young child being Christian\nbeing surrounded by staunch atheists, including parents, who\nactively persecute any religious tendancies - both actual punishments\nand, even worse, emotional blackmail. They would also have\nto have the whole mainstream society on their side. Maybe these\nconditions could have occured in the old Soviet Union* not in a\ncountry with "under God" in its pledge of allegiance.\n\n* I doubt it even then, because children have to be taught to be\nChristians and hence must have support somewhere.\n\n\nYes. My atheism was "born of necessity." For an intellectually honest\nperson belief is mostly a response to evidence. Will or wishes have\nnothing to do with it. I could choose to lie, or to be silent about\nmy true beliefs. I could no more choose to believe in the God of\nChristianity than I could decide that the ordinary sky looks red to\nme. Still I should be clear that I'm not equating what I went through\nwith what gays go through. However it is a mistake to assume that\neveryone who goes through painful experiences are broken by them.\nHappily some are made stronger, once we get past it.\n\n\nNot without going to details and violating the confidences of some of my\nchildhood friends. Suffice it say to that religion does not guarantee\nthat a person will be happy and strong emotionally, and a repressive\nupbringing can leave its scars even, or especially, on those who don't\nget free of it. I doubt that any sane and sincere person doubts that and\nI feel no need to defend it.\n\nBy the way I am much happier and stronger being out of the closet. In\nthe end it has been, as someone eloquently put it in private email, an\nexperience of liberation rather than disillusion.
My girlfriend is a smoker. She has been addicted to it for quite some time.\nShe has been tried a couple of times, but then always get back to it. Her \nbackground is non-Christian, but she's interested in Christianity. I'm a\nChristian and non-smoker.\n\nI would like to collect any personal stories from Christians who managed to \nquit. I hope that this will encourage her to keep on trying. If anybody ever \nhad a similar problem or knows a good book on it, pls reply by email. \n\nI appreciate any kinds of helps. Thanks a lot.
Hypostasis\n\n[I've explained it here before.  If you want the full document, ask me by mail\n--Rex] \n\n\n   "Questions arise as we begin to think about LOGOS and what His inner\nconsciousness was composed of. We need to clarify the two natures of Christ\nbriefly.  The divine nature, which has existed eternally, did not undertake any\nessential changes during the incarnation which would cause a conflict with the\nattributes of God, the foremost of these being His immutability.  This would\nmean that it remained impassable, that is, incapable of suffering and death,\nfree from ignorance and insusceptible to weakness and temptation.  In the realm\nof the divine nature it is better to say that the Son of God became that which\nwas not absolute-and in Himself.  The result of the incarnation was that the\ndivine LOGOS could be ignorant and weak, could be tempted and suffer and die,\nnot in His divine nature, but by the derivation of His possession of a human\nnature.\n     This would mean that both the properties of the divine nature and the\nhuman nature are properties of the person, and therefore ascribed to the\nperson. By this reason we can say that the person can be omnipotent,\nomniscient, and omnipresent, yet at the same time be also a man of limited\npower, knowledge, a man of sorrows, subject to human wants and miseries.  There\nis, however, no penetration of one nature into the other.  Deity can no more\nshare the imperfections of humanity than humanity can share in the essential\nperfection of the Godhead.\n     We are not to assume that there is a double personality due to the\npossession of the double natures.  Christ's human nature is impersonal, in that\nit attains self-consciousness and self-determination in the personality of the\nGod-man.  We must now differentiate between the person and the nature of the\nMan. Nature is defined:\n\n"the distinguishing qualities or properties of something; the fundamental\ncharacter, disposition or temperament of a living being, innate and\nunchangeable."\n\n     Nature is then, in essence, the substance possessed in common, in as such\nthe Trinity have one nature.  There is also a common nature of mankind. \nPersonality, on the other hand, is the separate subsistence of nature, with the\npower of consciousness and will.  It is for this reason that the human nature\nof Christ has not, nor ever had, a separate subsistence, that it is impersonal.\n LOGOS, the God-man, represents the principle of personality.  It is equally\nimportant to see that self-consciousness and self-determination do not, as\nsuch, belong to the nature.  It is for this reason that we can justifiably say\nthat Jesus did not have two consciousness or two wills, but rather one.  It is\ntheanthropic, an activity of the one personality which unites in itself the\nhuman and the divine natures, being that neither the consciousness nor the will\nare simply human or simply divine."\n\n\n[The quotation given above is not identified, and it's not entirely\nclear to me what position Loren is taking on it.  Just for clarity,\nlet me note that the view expressed in it is one of the classic\nChristological heresies -- monothelitism.  That's the position that\nChrist's two natures were not complete, in that there was only one\nwill.  In most cases (which I think includes this example), it was the\nhuman will that was regarded as missing.\n\nNormally people who talk about Christ's human nature as being\n"impersonal" mean it in a somewhat more abstract sense.  That is, they\nare using "person" as hypostatis, not in the usual English sense of\npersonality.  In this use, the doctrine is called "anhypostasia".\nPersonally I think anhypostasia is just a more sophisticated way of\ndenying that the Logos took on humanity fully.  However it has never\nbeen formally ruled a heresy, and in fact has been held by influential\ntheologians both ancient and modern (e.g. Athanasius).  But the\nquotation above appears to be going farther than even Athanasius went,\ninto the realm of the overtly heretical.
Recently an e-mail to me mentioned:\n\n(Technically, the messengers aren't even human so\nit *can't* be a case of "homosexuality" -- even of rape.) [...]\n\nThe Jude reference to Sodom is also meaningful only in the context of\nthe Sodomites' "lust" for the "other flesh" of angels.  Again,\napplication to homosexual behavior in general, or to the position of\ngay Christians is largeely specious.\n***\nAre angels "flesh"? No. I feel that this is saying that it was because\nof their lust after other men, who are flesh( or of this world).\n\nwhat are other opinons on this? I haven't heard much about this verse  \nat all.\n\nIn Christ's Love,\nBryan
Yes, Mary is fully human.  However, that does not imply that she was\njust as subject to sin as we are.  Catholic doctrine says that man's\nnature is good (Gen 1:31), but is damaged by Original Sin (Rom 5:12-16).\nIn that case, being undamaged by Original Sin, Mary is more fully human\nthan any of the rest of us.\n\n   You ask why God cannot "repeat the miracle" of Mary's preservation\nfrom Original Sin.  A better way to phrase it would be "why _did_ He\nnot" do it that way, but you misunderstand how Mary's salvation was\nobtained.  Like ours, the Blessed Virgin Mary's salvation was obtained\nthrough the merits of the Sacrifice of Christ on the Cross.  However, as\nGod is not bound by time, which is His creation, God is free to apply\nHis Sacrifice to anyone at any time, even if that person lived before\nChrist came to Earth, from our time-bound perspective.  Therefore,\nChrist's Death and Resurrection still served a necessary purpose, and\nwere necessary even for Mary's salvation.
The biblical arguments against homosexuality are weak at best, yet\nChrist is quite clear about our obligations to the poor. How as \nChristians can we demand celibacy from homosexuals when we walk\nby homeless people and ignore the pleas for help? \nChrist is quite clear on our obligations to the poor.\n\nThought for the day:\n\nMAT 7:3 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but\nconsiderest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Or how wilt thou say to\nthy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam\nis in thine own eye?
How about Acts 11: 15-18, 22-23\nor, I John 4:1-8\nwhich says to *try* the spirits to see if they be of God.  \n\n\nHow do you know?  When have you tried to learn anything about me?\n--
What is fornication? (sex outside of marriage, abuse of sex)  \n\nIs not homosexual intercourse outside the context of marriage?\nIsn't it an unatural use of what God has given us?\n\nWhy is it that homosexuals are using the Grace of God as a license to\npractice sin? \n\n   For certain persons have crept in unnoticed, those who were long\n   beforehand marked out for this condemnation, ungodly persons who\n   turn the grace of our God into licentiousness and deny our only \n   Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.\n\n                                      Jude 4 (NASB)\n\nWhat is defined by God as a legitimate marriage?\n\n   For this cause a man shall leave his father and his mother, and\n   shall cleave to his wife; and the shall become one flesh.\n\n                                      Gen 2:24 (NASB)\n\n   And He answer and said, "Have you not read, that He who created them\n   from the beginning MADE THEM MALE AND FEMALE, and said, 'FOR THIS \n   CAUSE A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER, AND CLEAVE TO HIS WIFE;\n   AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH'?  Consequently they are no longer\n   two, but one flesh.  What therefore God has joined together, let no\n   man separate." \n\n                                      Matt 19:4-6 (NASB)\n\n   But because of immoralities, let each man have his own wife, and let\n   each woman have her own husband.  Let the husband fulfill his duty\n   to his wife, and likewise also the wife to her husband.\n\n                                      1 Corinthians 7:4,5 (NASB)\n\n\nI disagree... Every law that is written in Leviticus should be looked at \nas sin.  That is why we have a need for a savior.  I can understand \nsomeone who may not know a particular sin listed in the Levitcal law, but\nI would hope that they would repent when confronted with it.\n\n\n\nAlso I noticed that the preceeding verses say.  \n\n   Also you shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness during her\n   menstrual impurity.  And you shall not have intercourse with your\n   neighbors wife, to be defiled with her. \n\n\n                                   Leviticus 18:19, 20 (NASB)\n\nThese verses are just as relevant as:\n\n   You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an\n   abomination.\n\n                                   Leviticus 18:22 (NASB)\n\nWhy was God telling the Israelites not to practice such things?\n\n   Do not defile yourselves by any of these things; for by all these\n   the nations which I am casting out before you have become defiled.\n   For the land has become defiled, therefore I have visited its \n   punishment upon it, so the land has spewed out its inhabitants.\n   But as for you, you are to keep My statutes and Judgments, and \n   shall not do any of these abominations, neither the native, nor\n   the alien who sojourns among you\n\n                                    Leviticus 18:24-26 (NASB)\n\nHe is the Lord...  Listen to what he has to say... \n\nNobody wants to dismiss homosexuals.  We do love you, but we don't \nagree that what you practice is not sin.  You have not truly repented\nof your sin.  We hate the sin that is within your lives.  I hate sin\nthat is in my life.  All Christians should hate the sin that is within\ntheir own lives.  Confrontaion with sin should bring about repentance. \nYes I agree with John 3:17, but I also know that Jesus said, "Repent for\nthe kingdom of heaven is at hand"  Matt 3:17.  If you don't agree that\nhomosexuality is sin than how can you repent from it?  This means that\nyou remain in bondage to it.  Repent from it and God will set you free.\n\nIn His Love, \n\n       Mike\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMichael Christensen                 |  Trust the Lord with all your heart,\nSenior Product Support Engineer     |  And do not lean on your own \nProcom Technology, Inc.             |  understanding.

The problem with this view is that the topic under discussion in this\npassage *is* marriages that were performed on earth.  Jesus' words\nseem to me to indicate that He regards His response as the answer to their\nquestion about which earthly marriage would be valid after the resurrection.\nThis being the case, the most straightforward interpretation, in my\nopinion, is that marriage does not exist in the next life because those\nwho are raised are of a different nature than what we are now.  Other-\nwise, why would Jesus offer "but are like the angels in heaven" as a\ncontrast to the idea of the resurrected marrying and being given in\nmarriage?  We do not have angel-like natures now, but someday we shall,\nand when we do, our earthly marriages will be irrelevant.  Or at least,\nthat's what I think Jesus is saying about the post-resurrection validity of \nmarriages performed on earth.  Your mileage may vary. :)
But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be\nmy witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the\nearth." \nActs 1:8
If you don't agree with Joseph's accurate statement of the Catholic dogma\nof Mary's perpetual sinlessness, then how do you interpret Luke 1:28,\n\n	And when the angel had come to her, he said, "Hail, full of \n	grace, the Lord is with thee.  Blessed art thou among women."\n\nand Luke 1:48? \n\n	...for, behold, henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.\n\nI suppose that these verses might be interpreted to mean that Mary was\npossessed of some limited quantity or quality of grace, just as some of \nfilled to the brim, incapable of containing more.  The only other people we \nknow of who have an abundance of grace are those souls existing in heaven now \n(another Catholic dogma, based on the communion of saints, as I explained in \nan earlier post).  Full of grace to me means sinless, and anyone who has \never sinned in his life cannot be without sin in the same sense as Mary  \nwas sinless.  \n\nAs a Catholic, I too find certain of the dogmas tough to embrace.  But\nthat's where the Catholic faith and prayer come into play.  I pray God\nto strengthen my will to accept the faith given the bride of Christ,\nwhich in turn usually strengthens my community faith in His Church.  And,\nas you probably know, faith in Christ's Church is tantamount to faith in\nChrist inasmuch as the Church is Christ's Mystical Body.  A Catholic by\nnature must have two aspects to his faith in Christ: (1) a personal faith in \nChrist as his own personal redeemer and (2) a community faith in the Church \nas the body of Christ.\n\n \n-- \nRandal Lee Nicholas Mandock \nCatechist\ngt7122b@prism.gatech.edu
This might be better directed to s.r.c.bible-study, which I have begun\nreading, but since my earlier notes were posted to this forum, I will\nconclude here as well.  A week ago, I managed to find time to consult\na Septuagint Concordance and a LXX text with apparatus at the library,\nand I can now usefully conclude my look at the Greek words for love as\nused in the Christian background of the Septuagintal translation of the\nJewish scriptures.\n\nThe principal result is that there is a cluster of uses of the verbal\nnoun from _erao:_, _eraste:s_ meaning "lover."  This cluster occurs just\nwhere one might most expect it, in the propethic image (and accusation)\nof Israel as faithless spouse to YHWH.  The verses in question are Hosea\n2:5,7 & 10; Jeremiah 4:30, 22:20 & 22; Lamentations 1:19; and Ezekiel\n16:33, 36 &37 and 23:5, 9 & 22.\n\n	[ Hosea seems to have originated this usage, which Jeremiah and\n	  Ezekiel picked up;  Lamentations is dependent on, though not\n	  likely written by, Jeremiah. ]\n\nThe "erotic" meaning (in its allegorical use, not at all literally) is\nevident.  So too in English, unless you complement it with a phrase like\n"of the arts" the word "lover" is going to have an overtone of sexual\nrelationship.  There is no surprise here, but it is worthwhile to see\nthat standard Greek usage *does* show up in the translations from the\nHebrew! :-)\n\nMore interestingly, and some confirmation of my guess that later Koine\nusage avoided the verb _erao:_ because of its homonymy to _ero:_ (say),\n_eromai_ (ask), there is an error in Codex Vaticanus (normally, a very\nvaluable witness) where a form of _erao:_ is used in a completely absurd\ncontext -- 2 Samuel 20:18, where the  meaning *must* be "say."\n\nIn addition to the above (and the uses I have already mentioned in Proverbs),\nEsther 2:17 uses the verb in its most natural application, \n\n	kai e:rasthe" ho basileus Esthe:r  --  and the King loved Esther\n\nand, rather more interestingly, 1 Samuel 19:2 supplies a modest degree of\nsupport to the gay appraisal of the relationship of David and Jonathan:\n\n	kai Io:nathan huios Saoul e:[i]reito ton Dauid sphodra\n	-- and Jonathan, Saul's son, loved David intensely\n\n	[ I'm using the bracketed [i] for io:ta subscript, which I\n	  don't yet have a reasonable ASCII convention for. ]\n\n(The relevance of this to the gay issue is not anything implicit about\nthe "historical" facts, but just that a quasi-official translation of\nthe Hebrew text in the Hellenistic period makes no bones about using the\n"erotic" verb in this context.  Given the quite general usage of _agapao:_\nfor erotic senses, this need not mean anything "more" than _agapao:_ alone\nwould mean, but it DOES disambiguate the relationship, as far as this\ntranslator goes!)
hey folks,\n\nI'm fairly new to these groups, tho' some have heard from me before.\n\nI'd like to get your comments on a question that has been on my mind a\nlot:  What morals/ethics apply to dreams and out-of-body incidents?\nIn normal dreams, you can't control anything, so obviously\nyou aren't morally responsible for your actions.  But if you can contrive\nto control the action in dreams or do an OOBE, it seems like a morality applies.\n\nNow, there seem to be 3 alternatives:\n\n1) Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental phenomena.  In this case no morality\napplies beyond what might be called 'mental hygiene', that is, not trying\nto think about anything evil, or indulgining in overly sexy or violent\nthoughts.\n\n2) Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own (i.e. are 'another plane')\nEvidence for this is that often dreams and OOBEs are sometimes done in\ncommon by more than one person.  A\nmark of objective fact is that >1 people report the same objective experience.\nIn this case, the same interpersonal morality/ethics applies in dreams and\nOOBEs as does in waking life.\n\n3) Like (2), but here we assume that though the dreeam and OOBE environs have a\nreal existence, a different moral/ethics apply there, and no (or maybe \ndifferent) moral laws apply there.\n\nSo... There it is.  Is one of these cases the truth, or does anyone know\nof another alternative?  respond by post or email.\n\nthanks very much\n\n*dt*\n\n========================================================

Note the difference here. One is saying, if *Christ* disagrees with \na Christian being gay, *Christ* can change that.\n\nThe other is saying, if *I* think being gay is wrong, that a Christian\ncannot be gay, *I* need to tell them to change.\n\n\nAs Lois said, and as before her Paul wrote to the believers in Rome,\nWHO ARE YOU TO JUDGE ANOTHER'S SERVANT?\n\n-jen\n\n--
Fred Gilham asks whether it is true that Goedel wrote a version of\nthe ontological argument for the existence of God.\n\nYes, it is true. Someone has published a rebuttal pointing out\ncertain flaws in the argument, and recently Professor C Anthony\nAnderson, of the Philosophy Department of the University of\nMinnesota, has written a revised version of the argument, perhaps\nfree of flaws, and at any rate free of the flaws complained of in\nthe original version.

IMHO this are going from bad to worse. 3-in-1, 1-in-3 was bad enough.\n \nI do not like a God who prays to Himself.

To me, the whole context of the scriptures\nco-heirs with Christ; that we will be like Him.\n \nCo-heirs share all things equally--including knowledge, power, dominion etc.\nWhen I am like Him (Christ), I will be the same as HE is--and He is a God.\n \nIf God cannot do this, the His is not all powerful--and He is NOT God.\nIf He will not, He is a Liar--and He is NOT God.\n \nBut if He does, He is the greatest of all the Gods.

: However greatly we extoll Mary, it is quite obvious that she is in no\n: way God or even part of God or equal to God.

Just as the person of Christ\n	cannot be replaced by an organization, so the bride cannot be re-\n	placed by the Church.  The feminine, like the masculine, demands an\n	equally personal representation.\n		The dogmatizing of the Assumption does not, however, according\n	to the dogmatic view, mean that Mary has attained the status of a\n	goddess, although, as mistress of heaven...and mediatrix, she is \n	functionally on a par with Christ, the king and mediator. At any\n	rate, her position satisfies the need of the archetype.

Not to change the subject, but how was Fr. Gobbi allowed at Notre Dame?  Notre\nDame is an anti Catholic University.  Was this allowed to show that the\ncrackpots at Notre Dame believe in freedom of speech?  I am glad that they did\nallow him to speak.
This is a RFD on a proposal for a newsgroup which would promote a \nsharing on the "Johannine hours" as proposed each month by the monks of \nthe ecumenical community of Taize (pronounced te-zay) in France.\n\nNAME OF PROPOSED NEWSGROUP: \n==========================\n\nsoc.religion.taize (Unmoderated)\n\n\nPURPOSE OF THE GROUP: \n====================\n\nThe Taize Community is an international ecumenical community of monks \nbased in France. Many young adults come there to search for meaning in \ntheir life and to deepen their understanding of their faith through a \nsharing with others. This newsgroup will allow such a sharing through a \nmonthly "Johannine Hour" which will be posted at the beginning of each \nmonth. A "Johannine hour" involves a short commentary on a given Bible \npassage, followed by some questions for reflection.  Any thoughts that \nmay arise in consequence and that you wish to share with others can be \nposted here. We are not interested in theological debate, and even less \nin polemics. No expertise is required! The idea is to help one another \nto deepen our understanding of Scripture as it is related to our own \nlife-journey.\n\nThe idea of "Johannine hours" was born in Taize as a simple response\nto all those who were trying to assimilate the Bible's message in the\nmidst of their daily life. Because of work or studies, it is often\nimpossible to spend long hours in silence and reflection, but\neveryone can take an hour from time to time to enter a church, sit\nquietly at home or go out for a walk in the woods. There, in silence,\nwe can meditate on a passage of Scripture to listen to the voice of\nChrist.\n\nDuring the time of silence, it is important to concentrate on what we \nunderstand and not waste time worrying if, in some Biblical expressions, \nwe find it difficult to hear the voice of Christ. The idea is to \ncommunicate to others what we have understood of Christ, not burdening \nthem with our own hesitations but rather telling them what has brought \nus joy, what has led us to run the risk of trusting more deeply.\n\nPerhaps those who read and think about the "Johannine Hours" in this\nnewsgroup could share their reflections and discoveries with others.\n\nThe important thing is the complementarity between two aspects, the\npersonal aspect of silent, personal reflection and the communal aspect\nof sharing, which through Usenet makes us a part of a worldwide network.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE TAIZE COMMUNITY:\n=================================\n\nThe following provides some background information on the life and\nvocation of the Taize (pronounced te-zay) community.\n\n"A PARABLE OF COMMUNION": August 1940, with Europe in the grip of\nWorld War II, Brother Roger, aged 25, set up home in the almost\nabandoned village of Taize, in Eastern France. His dream: to bring\ntogether a monastic community which would live out "a parable of\ncommunity", a sign of reconciliation in the midst of the distress of\nthe time. Centering his life on prayer, he used his house to conceal\nrefugees, especially Jews fleeing from the Nazi occupation.\n\nAN INTERNATIONAL AND ECUMENICAL COMMUNITY: Taize's founder spent the\nfirst two years alone. Others joined him later and at Easter 1949,\nseven brothers committed themselves together to common life and\ncelibacy. Year by year, still others have entered the community, each\none making a lifelong commitment after several years of preparation.\nToday, there are 90 brothers, Catholics and from various Protestant\nbackgrounds, from over twenty different countries. Some of them are\nliving in small groups in poor neighbourhoods in Asia, Africa, North\nand South America. The brothers accept no donations or gifts for\nthemselves, not even family inheritances, and the community holds no\ncapital. The brothers earn their living and share with others\nentirely through their own work. In 1966, Sisters of Saint Andrew, an\ninternational Catholic community founded 750 years ago, came to live\nin the neighbouring village, to share the responsibility of welcoming\npeople in Taize.\n\nTAIZE AND THE YOUNG; THE INTERCONTINENTAL MEETINGS: Young adults, and\nless young, have been coming to Taize in ever greater numbers since\n1957. Hundreds of thousands of people from Europe and far beyond have\nthus been brought together in a common search. Intercontinental\nmeetings take place each week, Sunday to Sunday, throughout the year\nand they include youth from between 35 and 60 countries during any\none week. The meetings give each person the opportunity to explore\nthe roots of their faith and to reflect on how to unite the inner\nlife and human solidarity. The meetings in summer can have up to\n6,000 participants a week. Three times every day, the brothers and\neverybody on the hill come together for common prayer in the Church\nof Reconciliation, built in 1962 when the village church became too\nsmall.\n\n"A PILGRIMAGE OF TRUST ON EARTH" The community has never wanted to\ncreate a "movement" around itself. Instead, people are called to\ncommit themselves in their church at home, in their neighbourhood,\ntheir city or village. To support them in this, Taize has created\nwhat it calls "a pilgrimage of trust on earth". At the end of each\nyear, the pilgrimage has a "European meeting" which brings together\ntens of thousands of young adults from every part of Europe for\nseveral days in a major city. There have also been meetings in Asia\nand in the United States. Every year, Brother Roger writes an open\nletter to the young. Usually completed during a stay in one of the\npoor regions of the world, these are translated into thirty languages\nand provide themes for reflexion for the following year.\n\nNOTE:  Discussion on the creation of this newsgroup will take place in \n       news.groups.\n\nFor any further information contact: Brother.Roy@almac.co.uk\n\n               brother.roy@almac.co.uk
Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be terrified; do not\nbe discouraged, for the LORD your God will be with you wherever you go."
This is something I've always found a little curious. I've never quite understood\nthe trinity thing. On the one hand, Jesus is supposed to be God incarnate. But,\nat the same time, he is God's son "For God so loved the world that he gave his\nonly begotten son". First question is, if Jesus was God in human form, how could\nhe really be God's son? If the Holy Ghost "planted the seed" in Mary, so to speak,\nthen it seems that Jesus' relationship to God would be the equivalent to the\nhuman father/son relationship. While a son might inherit alot of the father's \nqualities, he is not the father. They are still two separite entities. To try\nand say that a son is the same person as the father is obviously wrong. In that\ncase, Jesus and God aren't the same. On the other hand, if their relationship\nisn't the same as the human father/son relationship, but Jesus is actually God\nincarnate, then he's not really God's son and he never was. He's just God\nmanifesting himself as Jesus. At least, this is how I'm seeing it. Can someone\nwho is more knowledgeable about the trinity enlighten us? \n\nGetting back to the original question, what is the great price that Jesus paid\nto redeem our sins? Was it dying on the cross? Since Jesus knew that he would\nrise again in 3 days and then ascend back to heaven, I have a hard time seeing\nhow this is considered paying such a great price for humanity. His earthly body\nmay have been killed, but then, so what? He suffered a few hours of physical\npain, but then, there has been many a human who has suffered a great deal more.\nThe fact that Jesus was God's only begotten son doesn't seem to me to have much\nmeaning since God can beget as many sons as he wants to. Jesus being the only\none was simply a matter of choice. I suspect that these questions will be very\noffensive to many Christians on this net. To those people, please accept my\nsincere apologies. It is not my intention to offend or to trivialize Christ.\nBut, I do believe these are legitimate questions and I am genuinely curious.\n \n[Note that the Trinity and Incarnation have to be looked at together.\nFirst, your reading of the Virgin Birth is an uncommon one.  (In this\ngroup, it's dangerous to say that no one believes something.)  You\nseem to be suggesting the Jesus is God's son in a physical sense,\nwith the Holy Spirit as Father and Mary as Mother.  I consider that\nterrible heresy, though some people react less violently.  The Virgin\nBirth says that Jesus' birth is God's responsibility.  But it doesn't\nimply that God's sperm was involved.  Indeed one (though by no means\nthe only) speculation is that God used Joseph's genetic material.\n\nSecond, Jesus is in some sense doubly indirect from the Father.  In a\nTrinitarian context, the term Son refers to the eternal Logos, who is\na part of God.  The Son didn't come into existence with Jesus' birth.\nJesus is the incarnation of the Son.  So his sonness isn't\nspecifically a result of being incarnated.  Rather, it's the Son\nwho was incarnated.
I have enrolled in "The History of Christianity" at a college here in\nSt. Louis. The teacher of the class is what I consider to be\nclosed-minded and bigotted on the subject of what the definition of\nChristianity is.  His definition is tied directly to that of the\nTrinity and the Catholic church's definition of it and belief in\nJesus Christ is not sufficient to call one's self a Christian.\n\nWhile his saying it doesn't make it so,  I nevertheless feel insulted\n(or am I just neurotic? :^) ). I would like to be able to respond to\nhim with some sense of literacy while maintaining an amiable\nstudent-teacher relationship.\n\nSo, is there common definition of what Christianity is?  As the\nprevious discussion of the Trinity did not lend itself to an exchange\nof flames, I am hopeful that this will also not produce major\nflames.\n\nRegards,\n--\nLarry Autry\nSilicon Graphics, St. Louis\nautry@sgi.com \n\n\n\n[Often we get into discussions about who is Christian.  Unfortunately\nthere are a number of possible definitions.  Starting from the \nbroadest, commonly used definitions are:\n\n  a historical definition\n  people who accept Christ as Lord and savior\n  a broad doctrinal definition\n  narrow doctrinal definitions\n\n1) By a historical definition I mean the sort of definition a secular\nhistorian would likely use.  This would include any group that\ndeveloped out of the Christian church, and continues within the same\nbroad culture.  E.g. some Unitarians would fail just about any\ndoctrinal test you could come up with.  Yet it's clear that that group\ndeveloped from Christianity, and people from very different\nbackgrounds (e.g. Hindus) would likely see them as part of\nChristianity.  This is not a definition most Christians like, but it's\nrelevant in some political and ethnic contexts.\n\n2) Accepting Christ as Lord and savior is a test used by many\nChristian groups for membership, e.g. the Southern Baptists and\nPresbyterian Church (USA).  I would qualify it by saying that what\nmost people have in mind is an exclusive commitment to Christ, so that\nsomeone who accepted Christ as one of many gods would not fit.  It's\nan attempt to formulate a criterion that is religious but is not based\non technical doctrine.  By this definition, groups such as Arians\nwould be viewed as heretical Christians, but still Christians.  In the\nmodern context this would include Mormons, JW's, and "oneness\nPentecostals".  They would be viewed as heretical Christians, but\nstill Christian.  In practice I believe just about everyone who falls\ninto this category would accept the Apostle's Creed.\n\n3) The next level is an attempt to give a broad doctrinal definition,\nwhich includes all of the major strands of Christianity, but excludes\ngroups that are felt to be outside "historic Christianity."  This is\nof course a slippery enterprise, since Catholics could argue that\nProtestants are outside historic Christianity, etc.  But I think the\nmost commonly accepted definition would be based on something like the\nNicene Creed and the Formula of Chalcedon.  The attempt is to\ncharacterize doctrines that all major strands of Christianity agree\nare key.  Obviously this is to some extent a matter of judgement.  A\nMormon will regard the LDS church as a major strand, and thus will not\nwant to include anything that contradicts their beliefs.  But I think\nthis definition would have fairly broad acceptance.\n\n4) Finally, some people use definitions that I would say are limited\nto a specific Christian tradition.  E.g. some evangelicals only\nconsider someone Christian if he has had an evangelical-style\nconversion experience, and some I've even heard of groups that limit\nit to their specific church.\n\nI think you can find contexts where each of these definitions is used.\nA lot is going to depend upon the purpose you're using it for.  If\nyou're using it descriptively, e.g. in history or anthropology, you'll\nprobably use definition 1 or 2.  If you're using it normatively, i.e.\nto say what you believe the Christian message is, you'll probably use\na definition like 3 or even 4.

[much deleted] \n[much deleted] \n\n     It bugs me when I see this kind of nonsense.\n\n     First, there is no reasonable evidence linking Masonry to ancient\nEgypt, or even that it existed prior to the late 14th century (and\nthere's nothing definitive before the 17th).\n\n     Second, worship of Osiris is not, nor has it ever been, a part of\nMasonic practice (we are strictly non-denominational).\n\n\n     You said it!
Andrew - continuing the discussion on the Deuterocanonicals...\n\n\nArguably, it is both. Since authority is a matter of both\ncommunicator and recepiant we can say that, for example "Jesus\nis Lord" whether the world at large accepts the authority or\nnot. Thus the Bible can be considered for its authoritative\ncontent whether or not it is accepted (This issue is at the\nheart of Pilate's pragmatic question "What is truth?" to Jesus\nwhen our Lord was brought before Him. Jesus' reply was to appeal\nto the authority of his Father)\nYou also might like to consider the claimed authority\nrepresented by the statements "thus says the Lord" in the Bible,\nwhich claim to put across the exact words of God.\n\nYou fall into the danger of relativism with your rejection of\ninherant authority and claim that it lies only in the "community\nof faith" - does something become truth because it is accepted?\nThe main thrust of my argument is that there is a Godward\ndirection as well as a manward (which is where the reference to\nRev 22 came in.)\n\n\nIf we narrowed it down to the predictive elements - which will\ncut out some of the 39 accepted OT books as well - we\nnonetheless have criteria for determining the validity of the\nbook: Jesus' standards were that "Scripture cannot be broken".\nCan you name a single prophecy that fits the bill in the Apocrapha?\n(ie definitely fulfilled AFTER it has been written)\n\n\nDoes it have a subjective 'ring of truth' about it - and does\nother evidence that has come to light contradict or confirm the\nauthenticity? (archaeological, other textual evidence for\nexample)\n\n\nWhat this is getting at is the relationship between text and\nreader. It is to do with the quality of writing, which should\nhave the ability to fire the mind, affect our thought life and\ncause us to act in a certain way - there is something of this\nin Jesus' quote: "Man does not live by bread alone, but by every\nword that proceeds from the mouth of the Lord". (Matt 4.4)\n\n\nDoes the Catholic Church give the same authority to the\nApocrapha as to the accepted 66 books? Certainly it is not as\nwidely used as the OT and NT.\n\n\nThink about what I have said above. You may want to revise your\nconclusion. In addition think about other 'sacred writings', eg\nthe Koran, the book of Mormon and how and why you would\ncategorise them using the above principles. One word of caution\n- you may find some 'reflected glory' in some of these books: in\nthat the 'inspired quality' may be derived from the Bible.\nRemember that Lucifer is quite capable of appearing as an angel\nof light and quoting Scripture.\n\n\nWhat were you thinking of?\n\n\nWe've lost the point and the context here. I am not arguing that\nthe statement in Rev. can be applied indescriminately, just that\nthe whole acceptance/rejection idea does not just follow on from\nman-made traditions - but there is I believe an act of God\ninvolved in the selection and criteria of what is classified as\nScripture and comes under the definition of 2Tim 3.16.
I have not seen this book, though I have had several people quote it in \nsupport of some tendentious assertions they were making, so I have become \ncurious about it.\n\nI don't want to malign this Hislop fellow, whoever he may be, as I have only \nheard the arguments at second hand, but both of the arguments seemed to turn \non false etymology that SEEMED to be derived from Hislop.\n\nI would be interested in knowing more about these things. \n\nThe first one claimed that the word "church" was derived from the Greek \n"cyclos", and that it was therefore related to the worship of "Circe".\n\nI don't know if Hislop is the source of this assertion, but it does seem to \nbe based on false etymology.\n\nThe second claimed an etymological relationship between "Ishtar" and \n"Easter", which seemed to be even more fanciful and far-fetched than some \nof the wilder notions of the British Israelites.\n\nRegarding the latter, as far as I have been able to find out, "Easter" is \nderived from the old English name for April - "Eosturmonath". The Venerable \nBede mentioned that this was associated with a goddess called "Eostre", but \napart from that reference I have not been able to find out anything more \nabout her. It also seems that the term "Easter" is only used by the English \nand those they evangelized. The Germans, for example, also use the term \n"Ostern", but Germany was evangelized by English missionaries.\n\nSo I would be interested in any evidence of "Easter" being used for Pascha \nby people who do not have any kind of connection with the ancient Anglo-\nSaxons and their offshoots. Such evidence might support the claims of those \nwho appear to derive the theory from Hislop.
This is misleading, at best.  The question, really, has to do with the\nstatus of the Greek Septuagint versus Hebrew scripture.  And the issue\npredates the Reformation by quite a bit -- Jerome was negative about the\n"deuteroncanonicals" and in fact, even though he transalted them, he put\nthem after the Hebrew canon (reordered from the Greek ordering to the\nHebrew one.)  His translations of them were quick-and-dirty, also (he\nreports having done one of them in one day, and another overnight, just\ndictating his translation to an amanuensis.\n\nThat is to say, it is the Vulgate, and all of its massive importance in\nWestern Christianity, along with the veneration of Jerome, which took the\nfirst steps in "reducing" these books from the status they had (and have)\namong the Greeks.\n\nFurthermore, it is inaccurate to say that the Reformers "threw out" these\nbooks.  Basically, they just placed them in a secondary status (as Jerome\nhad already done), but with the additional warning that doctrine should\nnot be based on citations from these ALONE.\n\nI think that the emphasis on the Hebrew originals is sound, though it\nseems somewhat arbitrary to disallow on the face of it a translation as\npart of a collection whose principles of selection (in Hebrew or Greek)\nare confused or unknown and likely fraught with accident.  It also seems\nto play into a tendentious notion of the original languages being somehow\n"more inspired" -- as if magical, and conveying a message untranslatable\n-- than a translation, as if we could not hear God's word to the Jews in\nGreek (or German, or English, ...).  This tendency seems to have got a\nbig boost in _sola scriptura_ Protestantism, even to the point of current\n"inerrancy" bizarreness, despite the more basic, underlying tendency of\nthe Reformers to see that the texts SHOULD and COULD be translated.  If\nwe can profit from an English rendering of Hebrew and Greek, there is\nsurely little reason to keep Sirach, at least, out of our Bibles (and of\ncourse, Anglicans don't do so :-)).  For texts originally in Greek, it\nwould seem more to be anti-Greek prejudice (notably, by the time the\nHebrew canon is fully attested, including anti-Christian prejudice which\nled to the Jewish abandonment of the Septuagint) which is operative.\n\nBTW: readers may enjoy some lectures of Bruce Metzger on the issues of\ntranslation of the Bible (including some of what I said about Jerome,\nabove) in the current numbers of the journal _Bibliotheca Sacra_; two\nof four have been published so far.

Ezek 22:26 God seems to be upset with the priests who have made no\ndifference between the holy and the profane.  This brought to my mind a\nsermon I heard recently in which the speaker said "God's second name does\nnot begin with a D" referring, I believe, to use of God's holy name and\ntitles as swear words.  I was also reminded of the experience of Moses at\nthe burning bush when God told him "Take off your sandals, for the place\nwhere you are standing is holy ground."\n\nThese and other texts seem to imply that God's people must treat holy\nthings differently from other "common" things, or "make a difference"\nbetween holy and common things.\n\nThe obvious questions are \n\nWhat makes something holy? and How are Christians (primarily) supposed to\nmake this difference between holy and common things?  (e.g. God's name,\nthe Holy Spirit, the Holy Bible, etc.)
Conviction of Sin\n\n		A meta-exegetical or methodological essay\n\n\n\n\nI look forward to reading it.  When I got to the library last week, it\nwas with the object in view to look at some articles that have appeared\nover the last few years, since my previous look at the literature.  Un-\nfortunately, they had moved the journal back-issues, so I didn't get a\nlook at the articles I was hoping to find.  I will continue to reserve\nmy own judgment on _arsenokoitai_ until I have seen the latest scholarly\nwork, and I can hope that REXLEX's posting may give some meat to chew on.\n\nHowever, what I *can* do now, is to point out the methodological issues\n-- what needs to be shown for anything to be concluded in this matter.\nIf the article REXLEX posts addresses these issues, so much the better;\nif not, you will perhaps understand why the problem is hard.\n\n\nwrites, _in abstractu_:\n\n\n	[it is only a minor point, but let me make it anyway; De Young has\n	already contradicted his own prior assertion in this abstract that\n	the ancient analysis of these issues was concerned with actions and\n	NOT with orientation.  I doubt this will have much bearing on the\n	article as such, but thought I should point it out from the start.]\n\nThe hypothesis De Young is advancing is that Paul a) coined the word and\nb) his intended meaning for it was in reference to the Levitical law.  The\nquestions I wish to raise are\n\n	1.)  how would one go about confirming the truth of this hypothesis?\nand	2.)  what follows if one accepts (or stipulates, for the sake of the\n	     discussion) that it is correct?\n\nNote that b) is independent of a); I consider b) far more plausible than a),\nwhich seems merely to be a counsel of despair over finding nothing in the\nliterature contemporary with Paul to clarify this word.  So far as I know,\nPaul does NOT in general invent words anywhere else in his letters.  Unless\nyou have an otherwise-established pattern of coinages, it is *not* sound\nmethodology to assume it -- particularly if he gives no hint in the immedi-\nate text to "fix" the coinage's meaning for his audience.\n\nAs yet, the extract presents no evidence at all.  What do we need to confirm\nor reject the hypothesis? (which, I should say at the outset, I find somewhat\nplausible; I certainly know of nothing which makes it an *impossible* way\nof construing this problem passage.)  I'm going to set aside for the moment\nthe question of whether Paul might have coined this usage, to look at the\nmore tractable question of what it means.  For this there are, in principle,\ntwo kinds of evidence that can be adduced, internal and external.  That is,\nwe can look at the text of Paul's letter for clarification or look outside\nthat to prior or contemporary writings that Paul might have relied on, or to\nderivative writings that have some claim of access to Paul's meaning.\n\nThe single WORST problem with this word in Corinthians is that there IS no\ninternal evidence for Paul's meaning.  He uses the word totally without an\nexplanation or hint as to his meaning, save that its inclusion in a list of\nnegatives implies that it has for him SOME negative meaning.\n\nWe are left, as the only "internal" clue, with the etymology or formation\nof the word -- which is indeed the reason that De Young (and others before\nhim) have associated it with the Leviticus prohibition of men VERBing with\nother men, where VERB is some standard euphemism for having sex ("lie" in\nLeviticus, "bed" in Greek).  One problem is that "bedders" (_-koitai_) is\nnot, as far as I know, USED that way in Greek.  THEREFORE, I offer one\nserious test which de Young's hypothesis *must* pass or be rejected:\n\n	o  find a body of Greek texts contemporary with Paul (or not much\n	   prior to his day) such that the _X-koitai_ formation implies\n	   "men who have sex with X"  [obviously, the "best case" is to\n	   find such usages of _arsenokoitai_ itself.]\n\nsuch texts would be confirmation that the word *can* be read that way.\nIt is worth emphasizing that compound words are NOT in general under-\nstandable by projecting what the READER may imagine by the juxtaposition\nof the roots.  Existence of such parallels doesn't *prove* the hypothesis\ncorrect -- but it goes a long way towards making such a usage (whether or\nnot original with Paul in the specific case of X == _arse:n_) possible\nof comprehension by his readers.\n\nMy "test" moves in the direction of external evidence.  If Paul does NOT\nin his text explain his word (and he does not), then he has to expect his\nreaders to already know the word (which stands against its being a coinage)\nor to expect that it mimics word formations that they *do* know, such that\nthey can guess his meaning without too much floundering.\n\nExternal evidence, that is, texts other than Paul's own and lexicographic\nor social/historical considerations that might be adduced, then come into\nthe picture.  *If* there are other uses of the word, not dependent on Paul,\nwhich *have* sufficient internal (contextual) evidence -- or some gloss by\na contemporary scribe -- to show a derogatory reference to male homosexu-\nality, or similar _-koitai_ formations used in similar ways, *then* one\nhas grounds for\n\n	o  denying that Paul coined the word\nand	o  assuming that his readers might understand his meaning\n\nDo you see the problem?  If Paul coined the word, then he REQUIRES his\nreaders to share enough context with him to COMPREHEND his coinage and\nits intent -- in this case that they would (stipulating De Young's guess)\nunderstand him to be referring to the Levitical "universal" prohibition\nof male-male sex (this, mind you, in a context where Paul has emphasized\nat least to OTHER congregations (and so one assumes to the Corinthians --\nhow else to explain 1 Cor. 6:12, and the Corinthians having to be pulled\nback from overinterpreting their freedom?) the NON applicability of Torah\nlaw to his gentile converts!)\n\nAmong the considerations that make it implausible for Paul to have coined\nthe word, its first element is archaic -- _arse:n_ is an old Attic or\nIonic form of what in even classical (let alone koine) times would be\nassimilated as _arre:n_.  To me, this implies that we are even more than\nusually needful of external evidence to pin down meaning and usage.  What\nis Paul doing inventing a word in obsolete Attic formation?\n\nAnd if he *didn't* coin the word, but picked it up like the others in\nhis list as common terms of derogation, then his meaning will be -- for\nhis readers -- constrained by that common meaning (since he gives no\nother.)\n\nI cannot emphasize enough that Paul DOES NOT TELL US what he means by\nthis word.  We (and his original readers) are guessing.  They, at least,\nhad a contemporary context -- and maybe Paul had used this very word and\nexplained it in great detail to them in person.  But we have no trace of\nevidence of that, and to *suppose* it is mere fantasy.\n\nSo -- we are *desperately* in need of external evidence about this word.\nAnd it seems to be exceptionally meagre.  That is precisely the problem.\nI can think of several more or less equally plausible hypotheses about\nthe word:\n\n	a)  it was a standard gutter term of abuse for (some or all, maybe\n	    very specific, maybe very general) homosexual male activities\n\n	b)  it was a term of abuse used by Jews about the awful homosexual\n	    Greeks (which may or may not be consciously associated on their\n	    part with the Leviticus passage)\n\n	c)  Paul invented the term -- and again there may or may not be an\n	    association with Leviticus in his doing so.  He may or may not\n	    intend the word to have an explicit and universal application\n	    with absolute and clear boundaries.  [Since none of his OTHER\n	    words in that list have such character, this last seems to me\n	    about the *least* plausible of the hypotheses I'm advancing.]\n\nOf these, I'd say off the top of my head that a) is most plausible -- but\nI still have reservations about that, too.\n\nIf the word NEVER appears before Paul, and in later uses has some evidence\nof depending on Paul, then one can opt for Paul's coining it.  If it does\nappear before him, he might *still* have coined it being unaware of prior\nuse (in which case, his coinage is inherently confusing!) but one should\nnormally demote c) on the basis of any earlier uses (especially if they\ncan be shown to have been at all common in the places Paul traveled.)  In\neither of the a) or b) cases, one has to take into account Paul's relation\nto the community of usage he picked the word up from -- and whether it be\nfrom the Greek or Jewish communities, Paul's relations are hardly straight-\nforward!\n\nThere is, so far as I have yet seen, little or no external evidence to aid\nus in selecting one of these (or some other) hypothesis.  Your guess is as\ngood as mine (or maybe worse or maybe better, depending on a lot of things).\nBut it remains -- so far -- guesswork.  And I don't know about you, but I\nfor one WILL NOT equate human guesswork with the will of God.  By all means\nbe convinced in your own conscience about what Paul is getting at -- as he\nsays elsewhere on what was in HIS day a major controversy of somewhat this\nsame character (Romans 14:22-23)\n\n	"Hold on to your own belief, as between yourself and God -- and\n	consider the man fortunate who can make his decision without going\n	against his conscience.  But anybody who eats in a state of doubt\n	is condemned, because he is not in good faith, and every act done\n	in bad faith is a sin."\n\nFor my part, I cannot see any way to resolve Paul's meaning in the use of\n_arsenokoitai_ without directly applicable external evidence -- and by\nthe nature of such external evidence, it will never reach to certainty\nof constraining Paul's own intent.  Paul, like Humpty Dumpty (and me, and\nall the rest of us) *will* use words in ways that are personal choices --\nand sometimes leave his readers puzzled.  If that puzzlement leads you\nto God, it may be blessed -- if it should lead away (as some of Paul's\nwords HAVE led some people), then Paul's intense communicative effort to\ncontrive his meaning in our souls may have some regretable consequences.\nI have always found Paul to be a fantastically reliable guide -- if I\nread him "in the large", if I can see him lay out his position in detail\nand hammer it home time and time again.  I am much less certain about his\nmeaning in his many brief and cryptic passages (such as this one.)\n\nIn my usual discursive way, I have gone on at great length about the first\nof my intended meta-exegetical points -- what would be needed to confirm\nthat Paul a) coined or b) in any case meant the word to mean the same as\nthe Leviticus prohibition.  My second point is to *stipulate* this hypo-\nthesis, and follow up what it implies for both his initial readers and\nfor later Christians.  Given my verbosity, this will be tomorrow night's\nmeditation :-)
Without quoting at length from the preceeding post, I'd just like\nto say that I find it a much more appropriate way of dealing with\nissues like the Holocaust and Bosnia that asserting that "God is\npunishing them."\n\nThe activity of God is always _redemptive_, which means "restoring\nwhat has been lost, broken, or distorted."  So, God does not _will_\nthe brokenness, lostness, distortion, genocide, poverty, etc, but\nis nonetheless capable, willing, and active to restore, heal, mend,\nand redeeem.
The Moderator of the General Assembly, the Rev. John Fife, visited our\nchurch about a week ago (just 4 days after Rev. Spahr--it's been a busy\nweek for our small church!!).  He was asked specifically about the issue\nof homosexuality and what he thinks will happen at the GA meeting next\nmonth.  Evidently, there are 15-20 known resolutions pending that range\nthe gamut from "outlawing" homosexuality altogether to "legalizing" it\ncompletely.  He will readily admit that this is probabaly the most difficult\nissue that the church has had to deal with since the Presbyterian church\nsplit in two over the issue of slavery more than 100 years ago.  Without\nquestion, the issue may split the church again after we've been reunited\nfor all of a dozen years or so.  He is hopeful that it will not and is\npushing the same attitude that helped the church deal with the abortion\nissue last year as a solution.\n\nHe is hoping to pass a resolution that more or less states that we, the\nmembers of the church "Agree to Disagree" on the issue, admitting that\nboth sides have honestly studied the Scriptures and had the Spirit lead\nthem to different conclusions.  It worked last year when the abortion\nissue threatened to do more or less the same thing, and he is hopeful that\nthe GA can foster a loving and caring attitude about people who disagree\nwith their own view.\n\n--\nCliff Slaughterbeck           | \nDept. of Physics, FM-15       |   It's time for the sermon on the\nUniversity of Washington      |   Grand Torino!\nSeattle, WA 98195             |
Let me salute Gary Chin for speaking the gospel which is our source\nof life.  Any who will follow his example, and accept the priorities\nChrist commands of us, that the weightier matters of the law are justice\nand mercy and good faith, is my brother or sister in Christ, and I will\nattend to such a person with humility and charity.  We may not, in the\nend, agree -- siblings often don't -- but we can at least talk.
: \n: In the NT, the clear references are all from Paul's letters.  In Rom\n: 1, there is a passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evil.\n: Note that the passage isn't about homosexuality -- it's about\n: idolatry.  Homosexuality is visited on people as a punishment, or at\n: least result, of idolatry.  There are a number of arguments over this\n: passage.  It does not use the word "homosexuality", and it is referring\n: to people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexuality.\n: So it's not what I'd call an explicit teaching against all homosexuality.\n\nThat's like saying that murder is only wrong for those of us who aren't natural\nmurders, and stealing is only wrong for those of us who aren't natural\nthieves.\n\nWill
"Hate the sin but love the sinner"...I've heard that quite a bit recently, \n   ....  My question is whether that statement is consistent with Christianity.\n   I would think not.\n\n   Hate begets more hate, never love. ....\n\n   In the summary of the law, Christ commands us to love God and to love our \n   neighbors. He doesn't say anything about hate. In fact, if anything, he \n   commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves. ....\n\n   - Scott\n\nI too dislike the phrase "Hate the sin, love the sinner".  Maybe the\ndefinite article is also part of the problem, since it seems to give\nus license to fixate on our brother's peculiar pecadillo which we have\nmanaged to escape by a common grace of heredity, economic situation, or\nculture.  Our outrage at evil is too often just a cheap shot.\n\nThat said, I don't think Scott has adequately explored the flip side\nof this coin, namely the love of righteousness.  In the Beatitudes,\nJesus blessed those who hungered and thirsted for righteousness.  In\nthe New Testament, it is never enough just to behave well, one should\nalways actively desire and work for the cause of good.  In that sense,\nit should be impossible to remain dispassionate about evil and its\nvictims, even when these are its accomplices as well.\n\nMaybe "mourn sin, love sinners" catches the idea slightly better than\n"hate", but only slightly, since grief usually implies a passive\npowerless position.  A balanced Christian response needs grief, love,\nand carefully measured, constructive anger.  Jesus has all three.  The\nEuropean pietists during WWII whose response to Nazi atrocities was\ndevoid of anger do not fare well as role models, however much love or\ngrief they exemplified.\n\nMy sister is an actress in New York and a Christian.  A few years\nback, Jack, her long-time professional friend and benefactor, died of\nAIDS, impoverished by medical bills, estranged from his family, and\nabandoned by most of his surviving friends.  Only my sister and\nbrother-in-law were there with him at the very end.  In her grief over\nJack's death, my sister found quite a few targets for anger: callous\nbureaucracies, the rigid self-protective moralism of Jack's family,\nthe inertia in Christians' response to AIDS, and, yes, even Jack's own\nlapse in morality that eventually cost him his life.  Jack himself\nshared that last anger.  Brought up with strong Christian values, he\nwas contrite over his brief dalliance with promiscuous sex long before\nhis AIDS appeared.  (I imply no moral judgement here about Jack's\ninnate sexual orientation, n.b.)\n\nMaybe the hardest job is making our anger constructive.
That depends on how this verse is read.  There are at least two\nmeanings of the word "once".  1) only one time, and 2) at some\nother time (i.e. once upon a time).  Note that in the previous\nverse, the word "once" is used with the second meaning, and also\nin the following verse, "once" is again used with the second meaning.\nThe Greek, I am sure, uses different words for each of the two meanings\nfor the English word "once".  I am not a Greek scholar, but I'm sure\nsomeone here can verify which Greek word is used here for this meaning.\nIf the second meaning is being used, that verse can be interpreted as:\n\n  - for it was once given for men to die (beginning with Adam), but \n    after this [gift of atonement offered by Jesus Christ] the judgement\n    [is made available], for now there is no longer death, but life\n    with Christ.
(This is a continuation of an earlier post)\n\n\n(I am sorry you found this offensive.  It was not my intent to offend.  I was \nleading up to another point, which I discuss in more detail below.)\n\n\nI can see you have a revulsion for bestiality that far exceeds my distaste for \nhomosexuality.  Certainly if I spoke about homosexuality the way you speak of \nbestiality, nobody would have any trouble labelling me a homophobe.  Let me ask \nthis gently:  why are you so judgemental of other people's sexual preferences?  \nWhat happened to "No doubt I am free to do anything"?  I think you have a \nserious double standard here.  When you describe a comparison between \nhomosexuality and bestiality as "slimey" and "sleazy", you are making an \nimplicit judgement that bestiality is perverted, sinful, disgusting, \nunnatural--in short, all the things that society once thought about \nhomosexuality.  Not all people share your view.  You claim not to know any \nsincere zoophiles, but this does not mean that they do not exist.  They even \nhave their own newsgroup:  alt.sex.bestiality.  Are you going to accuse them \nall of being mere "jokers"?\n\nI notice you deleted the main point of my comment:  the fact that the only \nBiblical condemnations of bestiality occur in connection with the Levitical \nprohibitions against homosexuality.  While there are some New Testament \npassages that can arguably be taken as condemning homosexuality, there are none \nthat condemn bestiality.  One of your main points seems to be that Christian \nhomosexuality is acceptable due to the lack of any "clear" New Testament \nstatements against it; if this is a valid argument, then should not Christian \nzoophilia be made that much more acceptable by the fact that the New Testament \nmakes no reference, clear or unclear, to the subject at all?\n\nI am quite serious here.  If I am going to accept homosexuality as Biblically \nacceptable on the basis of your arguments, then I am going to be fair and apply \nthe same standards to everyone else's declared sexual preferences as well.  If \nthe arguments you make for homosexuality can be applied to other sexual \npreferences as well, I'm going to apply them and see what comes up.  I'm not \ntrying to "torpedo a serious issue" by using what you label "a ridiculous \njoke".  I posted a question about how we should interpret Biblical guidelines \nfor Christian sexuality, and I don't think such a question is "irrelevant" in a \ngroup called "soc.religion.christian".  The Bible discusses homosexuality and \nbestiality together in the same context, and therefore I feel I have a good \nprecedent for doing the same.\n\n\nI don't know whether it makes any difference, but for the record, this is not a \nside issue for me.  I believe loving one another includes not encouraging \npeople to defile themselves, therefore it is of high importance to determine \nwhether God regards certain sexual acts as defiling.  I can read in the New \nTestament that "God has joined together" heterosexual couples, and that the \nmarriage bed is undefiled.  I can read in the Old Testament that homosexual \nintercourse and bestiality defile a person whether or not that person is under \nthe Law.  If gay Christians can validly put aside the Old Testament standards \nof defilement, then I want to know so that I can fairly apply it to all the \nsexual practices that defiled a person in the old days.  I don't think it's \nright to take just bits and pieces of the Law and try and apply them to \nChristians today, e.g. bestiality still defiles you but homosexuality doesn't.  \nThat was pretty much what you said earlier, right?  You used different \nexamples, but I think you said essentially the same thing about it being wrong \nto apply only certain parts of the Law to Christians. \n\n\nIt was not my intent to stir up such an emotional reaction.  I personally don't \nget all that upset discussing alternatives to the monogamous heterosexual \norientation; I'm afraid I naively assumed that others would have a similar \nattitude.  Please note that I have never intended to equate homosexuality with \nchild abuse.  I have merely noted that, for all the lack of "clear" NT \ncondemnation of homosexuality, there is an even greater lack of NT condemnation \n(or even mention) of bestiality, a practice which a number of people (e.g. on \nalt.sex.bestiality) consider to be their true sexual orientation.\n\n\nThis is an excellent question, and I pray that you will not treat it as a mere \nrhetorical question, but will genuinely seek to discover and understand the \nanswer.  I recommend you begin with a little introspection into why you \nyourself have much the same attitude towards zoophilia.  Why do you find \nbestiality so repugnant that you regard it as slanderous to even mention in \nconnection with other alternative sexual orientations?  Why do you not apply \nall the same verses about love and tolerance to zoophiles the way you apply \nthem to homosexuals?\n\nIs it because you automatically experience a subjective feeling of revulsion at \nthe thought?  A lot of people have the same experience at the thought of \nhomosexual intercourse.  Is it because you regard the practice as socially \nunacceptable?  A lot of people regard homosexuality as socially unacceptable.  \nDo you feel that it violates the traditional Judeo-Christian standard of sexual \nmorality?  Many people feel that homosexuality does.  Do you feel the Bible \ncondemns it?  Many people think the Bible says more to condemn homosexuality \nthan it does to condemn bestiality.  Why then do you think comparing bestiality \nwith homosexuality is insulting to homosexuality?  If you can honestly answer \nthis question, you will have come a long way towards understanding why many \npeople feel the same way about homosexuality as you feel about bestiality.\n\nAlso please note that I am not in any sense condemning *people*.  I am merely \npointing out that when I read the Bible I see certain sexual *practices* that \nthe Bible appears to condemn, e.g. sex outside of marriage.  When I say I think \nadultery and pre-marital sex are sinful, do you take that as me failing to love \nmy neighbor?  When you treat bestiality as something disgusting and \nunmentionable, are you disobeying "repeated orders not to judge or condemn \nothers"?  When you say other Christians are guilty of sinning by condemning you \nand judging you, are you by that accusation making yourself guilty of the same \noffense?  Or are you and I both simply taking note about *practices* the Bible \nbrands as sinful, and leaving the judgement of the *people* up to God?\n\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by the above two paragraphs.  If you mean that Jesus \nis the Truth, and that He accepts sinners, and does not reject them, then I \nagree.  If we were not sinners, then we would not *need* a Savior.  Our \nsalvation in Christ, however, does not mean that sin is now irrelevant for us, \nand we can now do whatever we want.  Nor does Christ's grace mean that those \nwho refer to sin as "sin" are being judgemental or intolerant.  I am speaking \nin general terms here, not specifically about homosexuality.  If the Bible \ncalls something "sin", then it is not unreasonable for Christians to call it \nsin too.\n\nAs applied to Christian homosexuality, I think the only definitive authority on \nChristian sexuality is the Bible.  If you make a list of everything the Bible \nsays on the subject of homosexual intercourse, I think you will find that every \nverse on the list is negative and condemning at worst, and "unclear" at best.  \nThe most pro-gay statement you could make about the list is that there is some \ndispute about the New Testament verses which many people interpret as \ncondemning homosexual intercourse.  That is, from a gay perspective, the most \npositive thing you can say about the Bible's treatment of homosexuality is that \nsome verses fail to clearly condemn it.  That's it.  Jesus declared all foods \nclean, the council at Jerusalem declared that Gentiles were not required to \nkeep the ritual Law, but nobody ever reclassified homosexual intercourse from \nbeing an abomination deserving of death to being an accepted Christian \npractice.  You have verses describing homosexual intercourse as an abomination \nthat defiles both Jews under the Law and Gentiles not under the Law, and you \nhave some verses which are at best "not clear" but which some people believe \n*are* clear in their condemnation of homosexual behavior, and that's the sum \ntotal of what the Bible says about same-sex intercourse.\n\nI can appreciate (from personal experience) your desire to have everything \nsimple, cut-and-dried, black-and-white, what-I-want- is-ok, and \nthose-who-oppose-me-are-wicked.  However, I do not think the Bible makes your \ncase as definitively as you would like it to.  In fact, I don't believe it says \nanything positive about your case at all.  Yes, I know the verses about loving \none another, and not judging one another, but that's not really the issue, is \nit?  You know and admit that there are still things that are sinful for \nChristians to do, since you say it is wrong for Christians to condemn you.  \nTherefore, the issue is whether the Bible says homosexual intercourse is a sin.  \nEven if you do challenge the clarity of the New Testament verses, you are still \nleft with the fact that the only thing the Bible does say clearly about \nhomosexual intercourse is that it is an abomination that defiles both those who \nare under the law and those who are not.\n\n- Mark
This was a popular belief in the Judaism of Jesus` time, that Elijah\nwould return again (as he had been taken in to heaven in a chariot and\ndid not actually die).  However Jesus was referring to John the\nBaptist not in the sense that Elijah was reincarnated as John\n(remember Elijah didn`t die) but that John was a similar prophet to\nElijah.  John was a fiery preacher, he wore sackcloth and wandered\nrough through Israel preaching the coming kingdom.  The verses that\ndescribe him (in Mark`s gospel) can be linked to OT references about\nElijah.  Hence John was similar to Elijah and Jesus was drawing the\nparallels between the two just as he drew parallels with the Suffering\nServant in Isaiah (and other messianic figures) and himself.\n\nA brief reply but I don`t have time to look up all the relevant stuff.\n\nSuffice to say there is a very strong explanation.\n\n\n\nRick.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nRichard Johnston                             Queen`s University\n73 Malone Road                               Belfast\nBelfast                                 \nNorthern Ireland                          \nBT9 6SB

Either A: God exists, or B: He doesn't.  We have two choices, either\n1: Believe in God, or 2: Don't believe in God.  If A is true, then 2\nbrings eternal damnation, whereas 1 brings eternal life.  If B is\ntrue, then 1 has minor inconvenience compared with 2.

Some years ago -- possibly as many as five -- there was a discussion on\nnumerology.  (That's where you assign numeric values to letters and then add\nup the letters in words, in an effort to prove something or another.  I can\nnever make any sense of how it's supposed to work or what it's supposed to\nprove.)\n\nSomebody posted a long article about numerology in the Bible, saying\nthings like "this proves the intricate planning of the Scriptures, else\nthese patterns would not appear".\n\nThen there was a brilliant followup, which was about numerology in all the\nother numerology posts.  Stuff like "The word `numerology' adds up to 28,\nand the word appears 28 times in the posting!  Such elegant planning!\nFurther, the word `truth' ALSO adds up to 28; the writer is using these\nnumerological clues to show us that we reach truth via numerology!"\n(These examples are made up by me just as examples.)\n\nI really liked that reply, because it did such an excellent job of showing\nthat these patterns can be found in just about anything.  However, I did\nnot save a copy of it.  I do not remember the author.  I'm only 90% sure\nthat it was posted to this newsgroup.\n\nBUT, on the off chance that somebody remembers it and saved it, or that the\nauthor is reading here, I wanted to know if anyone could send me a copy.  (I\nthink it should be made into an FAQ, if we can find it.)
I have been studying the Bible now for about a year.  I love it,\nbut I am not very familiar with the different denominations, or\ntraditions, or common beliefs of various christian groups.\nI have heard various people (outside this news group)\ndescribe *idols* such as power, money, material \npossessions etc.  These things are worshiped in some sense I \nsuppose, but I never really gave idols much thought.  Until now...  \n\nI have been reading the postings in this news group (which I \njust found a few days ago), and I have a question...  First, I'm\nnot trying to question anyone's belief or try to push my views\non anyone else (I haven't been at this long enough to have\nany views other than I cannot get to heaven by being good,\nI must understand that Christ bore my sins on the cross so that\nI could be saved and I need to repent, i.e. realize that\nevery time I sin, I might as well stick a sharp stick in\nChrist's side because He took the punishment for my sins,\nwhen He died on the cross).\n\nIn my studies, Mary never really comes up.  I know who she is, \nbut that's about it.  It seems to me that a statue of Mary \ncould be considered an idol?  Do people pray to statues of Mary?\n\nIt sounds like educated christians (more educated than myself\nI'm sure) believe Mary was sinless?  Wow...  I hoped to spend\nthe summer convincing myself (one way or the other) about\nTongues (I'm reading "Charismatic Chaos").  I guess I'll study\nTongues in parallel with reading this news group.  Any help you can \ngive me will be appreciated.\n\n    -------------------------------------------\n\n[I don't think the issue is so much that people are more educated than\nyou (though it may well be that they are), as that they come from a\ndifferent tradition than yours.\n\nThis is a discussion between Catholics and Protestants.  Catholics\ngenerally believe that Mary was sinless.  Protestants do not.  The\nissue comes down to different sources of authority.  Protestants\ngenerally limit themselves to the Bible as a source of doctrine.\nSince this isn't in the Bible (except in passages that no one would\nunderstand in this way if they didn't already believe it), Protestants\ndon't accept it.  Catholics see continuing revelation through the\nChurch, though they believe the results are consistent with the Bible.\n\nI interpret your posting, not as a call for yet another argument about\nwhether the Catholic Marian devotions are idolatry (an argument I am\nnot prepared to see newed here), but as a sign of being interested in\nlearning about traditions other than your own.  Catholics are of\ncourse a major one, but by no means the only one.  I generally\nconsider the major traditions to be Catholic, Orthodox, and\nvarious subsets of Protestantism.  Within Protestantism, it's a matter\nof how finely you want to cut things.  These days I think the major\ndivision is between those who accept Biblical inerrancy and those\nwho don't.  There are also a number of major historical traditions,\nbut in recent decades distinctions are tending to blur.  I'd \nidentify the major Protestant traditions as:\n\n  Lutheran, Reformed, Anglican (they're sort of halfway between\n  Catholic and Protestant), Wesleyan, Baptist, Holiness, Pentecostal,\n  Church of Christ\n\nBut there are a number of others.  Historical distinctions tend not to\nbe so important among the liberal churches anymore, and I think\ncurrent trends in society and the Church are also tending to make\nconservatives seen themselves as allies from a general "evangelical"\nperspective.  But differences among these various traditions are still\nquite marked.\n\nI think the best introduction to these issues is to read a good book\non church history.  Anyone who wants to understand the church really\nneeds to understand how we got where we are now.  A church history\nwill normally show you where each of these traditions came from, and\ngive a feeling for their nature.  Unfortunately I'm away from my\nlibrary at the moment, so I don't have anything specific to recommend.
If that's the ONLY reason, I'd be inclined to doubt whether or not what\nthey profess is Christianity.  The relationship of faith is based upon\ntrust.  Fear and trust are generally incompatible.  If my only motivation\nis fear, is there room for trust?  If so, there's room for faith.  \nIf fear precludes trust, then there can't be faith.\n\nLarry Overacker (llo@shell.com)\n--

In some earlier discussions on this thread I may have\ngiven the impression that even though children didn't \nrequire baptism it wouldn't hurt if they were.\nTo the contrary, when you baptize children before\nthey are capable of comprehending it you deny them \ntheir opportunity to demonstrate their desire to\nserve God.\n\nHave any of you considered that children are not\naccountable for sin because they are not capable of \nrepentance?\nPeter said to a group of "men and brethren," "Repent\nand be baptized every one of you" (Acts 2:38).\nNotice that he specified that if they *repent* then \nthey may be *baptized*.\n\nIn following Peter's instructions people must first\ndemonstrate repentance (a forsaking of their sins and \na desire to obey God's commands) *before* they are \neligible to be baptized.\n\nSince young children are not capable of repenting,\nthey are not eligible for baptism.\nAnd since God is both just and merciful "sin is not \nimputed when there is no law" (Romans 5:13), young \nchildren are not accountable for what they can't \ncomprehend.

Ever since I was a kid and learned to tell when I was in a \ndream I have used my dreams for fantasies or working out problems.\nIn my dreams I have done everything from yell at my mom\nto machine-gunning zombies, not to mention myriad sexual\nfantasies. I have deliberately done things that I would never\ndo in real life. I understand the need to control ones\nthoughts, but I always felt that dreams were format free,\nno morals, no ethics, no physical laws, (though sometimes I would \nhave to wake myself up to go to the bathroom.)\n\nIs this an incorrect attitude? Rather than weakening my inhibitions,\nI could argue that I got certain things "out of my system" by \nexperiencing them in dreams. By analyzing a dream I can determine\nif I have a problem with a certain situation, i.e. in a dream\nsomething will be exagerated that I can then contemplate and\nsee if it really bothers me or not.\n\nI can't believe that other people don't do the same. It seems \nsilly to attach moral significance to dreams.\n\nI think that this is entirely different from out of body\nexperiences, which I have never had.\n\nContradictions welcome.
Note that "scientific evidence" in this area does not prove any conclusions.\nThere has been evidence to suggest that a certain part of homosexual's\nbrains are different from heterosexuals- but that proves very little.\n\nAlso notice that the apostles did not have with them the "scientific\nevidence" linking certain genes with alcoholism, or stealing with certain\ngenetic problems.  Even if they did have scientific evidence, I doubt it\nwould have stopped them from communicating the teaching from the Holy \nSpirit that these things are sinful.\n\nThis reminds me of a conversation with a professor of mine.  He said \nsomething very true.  Christianity teaches that we should not give in\nto our every inclination.  Most people do give in to their leanings.\nIn Christianity, we have the concept of struggling with the flesh,\nand bringing it into submission.  One person may have a problem with\nhis temper, and having a murderous heart, another may have a problem\nwith homosexuality, another may be inclined to greed.  But God offers\nus the opportunity to be more than conquerers.\n\n\nThe preying mantis bites the head off of her mate after she mates\nwith him.  Is it natural for a woman to do the same thing to her husband?\nThe Bible is concerned with human morality, and only touches on animal\nmorality as it relates to humans.
.\n  Of some relevance to the posts on this subject might be Deut.23:2,
whitsebd@nextwork.rose-hulman.edu (Bryan Whitsell) sent in a list of verses \nwhich he felt condemn homosexuality.  mls@panix.com (Michael Siemon) wrote in \nresponse that some of these verses "are used against us only through incredibly \nperverse interpretations" and that others "simply do not address the issues."\n\n[remainder of my post deleted]  The moderator then made some comments I would \nlike to address:\n\n\nIf you are referring to the terms "effeminate" and "homosexuals" in\nthe above passage, I agree that the accuracy of the translation has\nbeen challenged.  However, I was simply commenting on the charge that\nit is an "incredibly perverse" interpretation to read this as a\ncondemnation of homosexuality.  Such a charge seems to imply that no\nreasonable person would ever conclude from the verse that Paul\nintended to condemn homosexuality; however, I think I can see how a\nreasonable person might very well take this view of the verse.\nTherefore I do not believe it is "incredibly perverse" to read it in\nthis way.\n\n\nActually, I wasn't thinking of the church at all.  After all, a couple\ndoesn't have to be married by a minister.  A secular justice of the\npeace could do the job, and the two people would be married.  My point\nwas that it is easy to find a biblical basis for heterosexual\nmarriage, but where in the Bible would one get a Christian marriage\nbetween two people of the same sex?  And if you do see a biblical\nbasis for same-sex marriages, how willing would gay Christians be to\n"save themselves" for such a marriage and to never have sexual\nintercourse with anyone outside of that marriage relationship?  Please\nnote that I am not trying to imply that gay Christians would not be\nwilling to be so monogamous, I am genuinely interested in hearing\nopinions on the subject.  I have heard comments from gays in the past\nthat lead me to believe they regard promiscuity as one of the main\npoints of being homosexual, yet I tend to doubt that gays who want to\nbe Christian would advocate such a position.  So what is the gay view?\n\n- Mark
STILL, the Angel Gabriel's greetings was:\n   "Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you.\n   Blessed art thou amongst women".\n\n   Even Mary was confused about this greeting.
...\n\nRegarding the first paragraph, I would say that I didn't write it. I\ndon't believe that unbaptized babies are put in Hell. I don't even\nbelieve in Hell. At least, I don't believe in a fiery place where\nthere will be "gnashing of teeth".
There was an article in USA today a few months ago showing the results\nof a study that actually only about 1% were homosexual.  I saw another\nfigure that listed 2% as the figure.  Of course, even if it were 99%\nthat would have little bearing on whether or not it is a sinful behavior.\nHow many people have commited other acts of fornication?  How many\npeople have lied or sinned in other ways?\n\n\nWhy isn't it a specific feature of homosexuality?  Paul describes\n"men with men working that which is unseemly" to describe the acts.  \nSure, there spirtual nature was depraved also, and like the other\nsins, the idolatry, the other sexual immoraity, and the other sins\nsprang from their depraved spiritual state which was a result of \nman's not glorifying God as God and being thankful.  Still, their\nacts were shameless.\n\n\nIs everything sinful specifically elaborated on in the New Testament?\nScripture does not condemn being a drug dealer.  Being ruled by the\nSpirit rather than the letter not only frees from legalism, it also\nprotects us from sins that are against the Spirit.  The word is a\ntwo edged sword that cuts both ways.  \n\nI think we must be careful before we totally throw out Leviticus.  \nIf the Law is reflection of God's character and true holy nature, then\nthose who say that God endorses homosexuality run into a problem.  \nIf homosexuality were "natural" (whatever that means) wholesome, \nendorsed by God, and those who oppose sexual behavior are narrow-minded\nbiggots, as some would have us believe, why is there a condemnation of\nit in Leviticus.  This condemnation is in the midst of all the other\nsex sin condemnations, and there is nothing in the text to say that this\nlaw was limited to temple prostitution, and no good reason to believe that\nthis was the case.  Furthermore, male homosexual sex was a death-penalty\ncrime!  \n\nIs every sin elaborated on in the New Testament?  Take a look at\nI Corinthians 5.  Paul said that one of the Corinthians had broken a\nlaw not even heard of among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's\nwife.  There is a prohibition against having your father's wife in \nLeviticus.  No other new Testament verse clearly condemns it (besides\nthis one.)  Notice that Paul did not say that the sin was in commiting\nadultery, etc.- he spoke against having one's father's wife.  \n\nNotice also that this sexual condemnation in Leviticus is not mentioned\nin the specific context of paganism either.  And there was no pagan \ncoustom mentioned in I corinthians either.  As a matter of fact\ntaking one's father's wife wasn't even done among the Gentiles.  It was\njust a plain blantant sin, whether worshipping idols was involved or\nnot.\n\n\nOne of the reasons that some of us do not accept that common argument\nis because Paul probably did face this and other problems.  Sin can\nbe tough to over come, especially without supernatural power.  Is\nhomosexual sin any more difficult to overcome that heterosexual sin,\nlike lusting after a married woman, or sleeping around with people of\nthe opposite sex?  I doubt it, and even if it is, that is no excuse.\nGod is greater than all of it. \n\nAnother reason we reject it is because it ignores the supernatural\npower of God to intervene in this kind of situation.  How many \npeople have been set free from sin by the power of God?  Sure there\nmay be any groups that have tried to change homosexuals and failed.\nThat is a reflection on the people involved in the program, and not\nGod's willingness and ability to change a sinner.  Any program that\nuses formulas may fail.  What people need is the power of God to\nchange them, whether they are involved in homosexual sin, or any other\nsin.\n\n\nI don't see how you come to that conclusion.  Paul's dealings with\npastorial issues encouraged people to give up their liberties in order\nto spare others- not to allow people to continue in sin because it\nwas just too difficult.  Take the example of eating meat offered to idols.\nPaul felt that there was nothing wrong, in an abstract sense, with\neating the meat.  Yet he advised believers to sacrifice their liberty\nto eat meat in order to spare others.  \n\nBut Paul never allowed people to sin because living holy was just to\ntough.  Paul wrote to "make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts\nthereof."  (Romans 13:14)  Then he goes in to a discourse on how we\nshould sacrifice our own liberty in order to spare the consciences of others.\n\nSuppose it were not a sin for people to practice homosexual acts.  \nSince others consider it to be a sin, then using Paul's approach\non pastorial issues, those who would otherwise be homosexuals should \nsacrifice their liberty and be celbate or monogamously married to a\nmember of the opposite sex.  Paul never offers a lesser sin (homosexual\n"marriage") to prevent people from engaging in what may be considered \na more damaging sin.\n\n\nYet marriage itself is not a sin.  marriage is holy in all- and something\nthat God ordains, and Paul recognizes this.\n\n\nActually, Adam was put in the garden to tend to it before he fell.\nAfter he fell he would have to toil over the ground.\n\n\nThat is why we are dependent totally on God- what a vunerable and glorious\nposition to be it.  We all must be transformed by the renewing of our\nminds- and that is the only way homosexuals can walk in freedom, just\nlike anyone else.\n\n\nI'm sure you can see how people with the opposing view see this \nconclusion.  It's like saying, "How should I kill myself, with gun or\naresenic?  What about the person who just is overcome with a desire to\nsleep with goats?  Would it be better for him to sleep with one goat,\nor all of them?  What about the person who wants to sleep with his aunts?\nWould it be better for him to sleep with one aunt or all of them?  \n\nIn all these cases, the more people or animals one sleeps with, the higher\nthe chance that they will get a disease.  But this only deals with \nphysical aspects of the question.  Whichever sin is commited, it all \nleads to spiritual death.\n\n\nThe issue that is most often addressed in Scripture seems to be the\nactual act.  Second, isn't it historical snobbery to say that\nonly homosexuals of this century are capable of having "loving\nrelationships?"  There are ancient writings glorifying homosexual "love."\n(btw, I am one who believes in refraining from making oathes.  Also,\nwhere do you get that tax collectors are sinners.  That's certainly not\nexplicit.  Jesus didn't tell Zachias to quit his job.)\n\nLink Hudson.
Woo! So far, we've had the following interpretations of the figure of\nthe `Whore of Babylon' in Rev 17 & 18:\n\na) The United States of America\nb) MHO dB) which was as a figure of the fallen spiritual powers who\n   corrupt and oppress human society\nc) Historical Jerusalem\nd) Historical Rome\n\nDare I suggest that the passage might be many layered in meaning? How\nabout * The prophecy reveals God's judgement on the corrupt & idolatrous\nstate oppressing his chosen people (d) * That God's judgement extends\n_especially_ to his once chosen city (c) because, despite that City's\nspecial call, it still rejected God's grace at the decisive time (Rev\n11:8? - also isn't Rev19:24 equally suggestive of Rome as Jerusalem?) *\nThat the USofA is guilty of many of the crimes of Rome/Babylon (a) and\nis equally subject to God's judgement * That the Good Book(TM) actually\nencompasses _all_ these viewpoints by revealing the corrupting spiritual\npowers warring against mankind through the very society that we've\ncreated. (b)\n\nClever, huh? (<-- Flame here!) No need to argue at all! \n\nI think Mary's view has a lot of sense because there seems to be a\ndeliberate contrast between Rev 17/18 and Rev 21/22 - the mortal\nJerusalem chosen by God but never (historically) fulfilling its vocation\nand the new Jerusalem perfected (outside of history) purely by God's\ngrace. eg Details like Rev 17:1 `.. who sits on many waters' cf Rev 22\nthe single stream in the new Jersualem `the river of life flowing from\nthe throne of God and of the Lamb.'
No smiley on the part about atheism, I see. Do you realize that your\nstatement says that I was mentioning "nonsense" about atheism? This is\nhard for me to defend against if this is the claim you are making, as you\nhave only included the last two sentences of my post and mentioned the\nfirst. Please address the substance of my post rather than rejecting it\nout of hand. \nBut, because of the sometimes ambiguous nature of English, I may be\nmisinterpreting your wording here. Please clarify: did you or did you not\nmean to call my statements about atheism "nonsense"? If so, care to back\nup that claim?\n\n\nOK, then. Start up the amatuer psycology again. How am I "broken"?\n\n\n*YAWN* Excuse me, I don't recall any portion of my post in which I called\nChristians arrogant quote me, if I did. I do remember calling Christianity\n"silly" and then following that up with information that I was nine years\nold when I thought that. I also said that I find faith to be intellectually\ndishonest and I would like to see some sort of proof of your god's\nexistence. I define "faith" as "belief in the absense of any proof", BTW.\n\nAlso, I subscribe to a.a as I mentioned and we see fundies of all types\nthere, so in answer to your question: "no."\n\nFinally, I'd hardly call Christianity "beseiged" in this country. I seldom\nsee Christians ridiculed for merely practising their religion or wearing\ncrosses or having Christian bumper stickers. I don't know for sure, of\ncourse, I only say I haven't seen it happening. What I have seen happening\nis my homosexual and/or friends being beat up, or preached at by people\nwho claim to be Christ's followers. I know that this sort of thing isn't\npracticed by the majority of Christians, but it is a very vocal minority\nwho are doing it and I don't see comperable victimization of Christians. \n\n\nThe implication being that I am not self-respecting, of course. I'm not a\nstudent of psychology, BTW, but I am a student of Creative Writing and\nLinguistics, so literary analysis _is_ my forte. Also, if the implications\nI see are improper, please let me know.\nI'm here because I'm not sequestered in my own little atheist cubbyhole as\nyou seem to think atheists should be. Did it occur to you that I _don't_\nthink I know everything and that maybe someone will say something that\nwill change my life? Have you read my other posts here or did you see\n"atheist" and decide it was time to poke at someone who doesn't deserve\nyour respect?\nAw, geez. I'm sorry, I probably am getting my back up a little too high,\nhere. It's just that the "nonsense" thing really annoys me. I figure you\nshould see my first reactions, though, since they are my true reactions to\nyour question.\nNow, the smoothed feather version:\nI seek all sorts of knowledge. That's why I came to my university. Yes, I\nam looking at your religion (well, sorta, I have no idea what *kind* of\nChristian you are) from the outside, and hopefully with an objective view.\nI've been trying to ask reasoned questions here, because I genuinely don't\nknow the answers to them, but when I saw the question directed at atheists\nI figured I would answer. After all, you can speculate about atheist\nmotives here all you want (hence the "amatuer" psychology crack), but\nwithout an atheist, you can't be sure of even one atheist's motive.       \nI'm hoping people really\nwant to know and I was trying to show that I actually checked out several\nreligions and I actually read all the pamphlets people have to offer and I\nactually think about these things. Instead, I'm still faced with the\nimplication that atheism is some kind of aberration and that only "broken"\npeople are atheist.\n	Try it from the flip side: I posit that atheism is the natural\nstate and only broken people are theists. I offer as proof that so many\npeople witness from horrible lives which picked up as soon as they \ndiscovered their religion, that religion is regional (if people didn't\nfollow the religion of their areas, there would be a more homogenous\nmix), so many terrorists claim theistic motives, and that theists tend\nto be so pushy and angry when challenged on alt.atheism. Why are religions\nso successful? Because there is so much suffering in the world, which \n"breaks" people.\nIt's an uncomfortable situation whichever way you look at it, which is another\nreason I'm here, to try to see the flip side of my thinking (and also as \na watchdog for logical fallacies :).\n                                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nThe implication here being that atheists can't possibly know anything\nabout Christianity. Probably jumping at shadows again, but I think my\nreaction is somewhat justified. After all, the first post suggested that\natheists are "broken", hostile people. This post confirms that someone\nelse believes it. \n\n                                             ^^^^^^^^^^\n\nWell, he got me there. I am a strong atheist, because I feel that lack of\nevidence, especially about something like an omnipotent being, implies\nlack of existence. However, I haven't met the strong atheist yet who said\nthat nothing could ever persuade him. Call me a "seeker" if you like, I\ndon't. \n_Weak_ atheism is being ignore here, though. Some atheists simply say "I\ndon't believe in any god" rather than my position: "I believe that no\ngod(s) exist." For the weak atheist, the is no atheism to disbelieve,\nbecause they don't actively believe in atheism. (If you think this is\nconfusing, try figuring out the difference between Protestants and\nMethodists from an atheist point of view :).\nThis is another fallacy many theists seem to have, that everyone believes in\nsomething (followed up by "everyone has faith in something"). Guess what?\nMy atheism ends the moment I'm shown a proof of some god's existence. Is\nthat really too much to ask?\n\n\n\nWell, I guess you won't succeed in converting him or me. Why the\nsupposition that you will fail to convince him? (amatuer psycology on) Is\nit because you yourself are unconvinced? :) \n\nAnd I told you that I find faith to be intellectually dishonest. Note that\nI can only speak for myself. If you find faith to be honest, show me how.\nI have been unable to reconcile it so far. Maybe that's how I'm "broken"?\nI tell you that I have invisible fairies living in my garden and that\nyou should just take my word for it. If you accept that, you are of a\nfundamentally different mind than I and I really would like to know how you\nthink. All I ask for is proof of the assertion "God exists". Logical or\nphysical proofs only, please. Then we'll discuss the nature of "God".\n\nPrayer?! Uh, oh, we'll have to revoke his atheist club card and beanie! :)\n\n\nGood luck to you, as well. And, again, I apologize if the inferences I\nmade were inaccurate. \n\n\nMuppets and garlic toast forever,\nMax (Bob) Muir
I don't see how this logically follows.  True enough, Mary received a blessing\nbeyond any granted in all the history of humanity by being privileged to be \nthe mother of the Savior.  It says nothing about Mary needing to be a "blessed \nperson" _first_ in order that she might thereby be worthy to bear the Son of \nGod.  Again, I think the problem is that as humans we can't comprehend how the \nsinless Incarnation could spring from sinful human flesh and God's Spirit.\nRather than simply accept the gracious miracle of God, we must needs try\nto dope out a mechanism or rationale as to how this could be.  Mary's own\nwords, \n\n"...my spirit rejoices in God _my Savior_, for he has regarded the low\n estate of his handmaiden,..."\n\nsound like the words of a human aware of her own humanity, in need of a \nSavior, similar to what David proclaimed in his psalms...not the words\nof a holy being with no further need for God's grace.\n\nI really apologize for harping on this, I don't suppose it's important.\nIt's just that I see Mary and Joseph and the Baby reduced to placid,\nserene figurines I feel we lose the wonder in the fact that God chose\nto come down to you and I, to be born of people like you and I, to share\nour existence and redeem us from it's fallenness by his holy Incarnation.
In the Monday, May 10 morning edition of the San Jose Mercury News an\narticle by Sandra Gonzales at the top of page 12A explained convicted\nkiller David Edwin Mason's troubled childhood saying,\n\n	"Raised in Oakland and San Lorenzo by strict fundamentalist\n	Christian parents, Mason was beaten as a child.  He once was\n	tied to a workbench and gagged with a cloth after he accidently\n	urinated on his mother when she walked under his bedroom window,\n	court records show."\n\nWere the San Jose Mercury news to come out with an article starting with\n"Raised in Oakland by Mexican parents, Mason was beaten...", my face would\nbe red with anger over the injustice done to my Mexican family members and\nthe Mexican community as a whole.  I'm sure Sandra Gonzales would be equally\nupset.\n\nWhy is it that open biggotry like this is practiced and encouraged by the\nSan Jose Mercury News when it is pointed at the christian community?\n\nCan a good christian continue to purchase newspapers and buy advertising in\nthis kind of a newspaper?  This is really bad journalism.
Ouch, this is a good question. To me, not existing is worse\nthan existing no matter what, so I will modify this question to be:\nwould I be a Christian if it made no eternal difference in my\nreward or punishment? I hope this is in the same spirit you want.\n\nI personally am very goal oriented. It is hard for me to do things\nthat do not achieve some goal. However, to relate this to sports, \nonly after I learned to not care about the score did I become\na good basketball player. I had to learn to go all out no matter\nthe situation. Perhaps this lesson is relevent. After all,\nonly if I can give up my life can I keep it, only if I am\nhumble can I achieve glory. Only if I concentrate on living\nmy life now the best I can will I be afforded life eternal.\nI think you have illuminated the true meaning of "saved by faith."\n\nBut what is my answer? Right now I would remain a Christian.\nHowever, was that always my answer? That's the problem. Heaven\nand hell are good motivators at certain stages of maturity.\nAnd I admit there are certain times when perhaps I bite my\ntongue and put up with something in the hope of a better day,\ni.e. I mentally trade present happiness for future happiness.\nI hope the cynics and skeptics do not read more into that\nthan appropriate, but I am trying to be honest.\n\n\nI think these kinds of questions are extremely fruitful. I guess it\ndepends on how one views knowledge and learning. By stripping\nideas to simple, straightforward, opposing concepts we can\ndetermine levels of importance. By analyzing the theoretically \nabsurd we can gain a better understanding of the actually absurd.
I include the key verse (D&C 68:25) because others\nmay not have the reference.\n\n"And again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion,\nor in any of her stakes which are organized, that teach\nthem not to understand the doctrine of repentance,\nfaith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of\nbaptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying\non of the hands, when eight years old, the sin be\nupon the heads of the parents."\n\nWhat is "the sin" of the parents?\n\n\n\nEzekiel 18 teaches a correct principle.\nHowever, it assumes that fathers and sons have \nequal knowledge to prepare for the judgment.\n\nParents are responsible to teach their children\nthe Gospel and other life skills.  Should they\nfail to make a sufficient attempt to teach their \nchildren, the parent would be held responsible\n-- not for their children's sins, but for not\nteaching them properly.\n\nWhenever the Lord installs someone to a position \nof authority in either the family or the church He\nexpects that person to teach those in his charge.\n\nIn Ezekiel 33:7-9 someone called to care for others \nis likened to "a watchman unto the house of Israel."\n"If thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from \nhis way, that man shall die in his iniquity; but\nhis blood will I require at thine hand.\nNevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to \nturn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he\nshall die in his iniquity; but thou hast\ndelivered thy soul."\n\nEven though the D&C prefaces this commandment with\n"parents have children in Zion" I believe all\nparents are responsible for teaching their children \nwhatever good principles they understand.\nHowever, LDS parents accept greater responsbility\nand could be judged more strictly.
I have no problem with the idea that catechumens be dismissed before\nthe Eucharist.  They were not considered qualified to participate.\n\n\nDoes the dismissal in the early church mean that the eucharist was a\nsecret?  I mean, was it:\n\n	you don't have to stay; from now on, only the membership can\n	participate; you really don't have to hang around; yes, I know\n	you're obliged to keep up attendance to qualify, but now is an\n	exception, okay?\n\nor was it:\n\n	you may not stay; what happens next is secret\n\nWhen we have had reason to conduct business meetings after church,\nwe've made it clear that only members can vote.  But we've always been\nhappy for non-members to stay and observe.\n\nDo you have evidence for intentional secrecy?  (Other than rumours,\nwhich will always happen when you have an underclass doing things not\napproved of by those in power?)
In <May.13.02.31.16.1993.1569@geneva.rutgers.edu> djohnson@cs.ucsd.edu\n\n\nI'm afraid I see that question as very tendentious.  Try rephrasing it:\n\n	What's more important to Christians?  Love of God or love\n	of other human beings?\n\nto which of course the only conceivable answer is that the one is like\nthe other.  I am *deeply* suspicious of any "flavor" of Christianity\nwhich would elevate one clause of the Great Commandment to a "priority"\nover the other such as to claim a conflict.  True, we are told to let\nthe dead bury the dead, to "hate" family rather than let it keep us from\nfollowing Christ.  But the dichotomy here is not one between love of our\nfellows and love of God, but of allowing *social* constructs to blind us\nto the presense of God.  It is particularly satanic to twist love of God\nin such a manner as to become an excuse to treat others as on a different\nlevel than the one who is so caught up in "love" of God.\n\nThe trouble comes in the relation of human love and human sex.  Yes, it\nhas sometimes been the case that the Church has "taught" that all sex\nwas nasty, evil, sinful stuff.  But when man and wife leave their parental\nhomes to become helpmates, living in one flesh, it is the sex that is the\nvehicle of becoming "one flesh" (if you doubt me, read St. Paul on what\nis wrong with frequenting prostitutes :-)).  Less provocatively, what I\nmean is just this: sexual bonding is a deeply founded aspect of our social\ninteraction, and in particular is the foundation of the institution of\nmarriage, so that unlike with many mammals, human males remain with and\nfoster the children they beget and support their children's mothers.\nThis is the schema behind Genesis 2:18-24 (and behind Jesus' citation of\nthat passage.)\n\n	[ I observe, by the way, that not all human males in fact do as\n	  I have just described; but another thing that characterizes\n	  human societies is our raising of *non*begotten children, not\n	  only orphans and adoptees and the like, but products of the\n	  quite common infidelities of humans to their spouses. We are\n	  in this not unique in the animal world, but the full extent of\n	  social consequences and implications is most intricate for us. ]\n\nYes, of course it sometimes goes "wrong" -- like all else we do, it is\ninfected with sin, and you find married "couples" where there is no bond,\nand people so deliriously addicted to the initial stages of sexual bond\nformation (the "infatuation", "falling in love" phase) that they break\nany forming bond in order to keep stepping over the threshold of the deep\nunity God has prepared for us, and stepping back out again right away.\nSatan may indeed *use* sex as a very handy tool to corrupt human love --\nbut in the Edenic creation, that is not its nature, and with God's grace\nunder the power of Christ to make all things new it need not be a problem\nfor Christians (though we must be vigilant, even in Christ, as the devil\nis watchful, prowling around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour.)\n\nSo, returning to the original question, what is more important to STRAIGHT\nChristians?  Sex, or Christianity?  Paul, clearly, tended to think that\nsex was at best a distraction from Christianity (though to be charitable\nto him, his context was in expectation of immediate parousia, so that the\nhard TASKS of a married union -- the lifelong building and adaptation to\neach other -- seemed somehow to undercut the "proper" preparation for an\nimmediate eschaton.  Since we *do not* know the hour of return, we should\nact *both* with instant readiness for that *and* with a commitiment to our\nmates that proposes a long lifetime together.  And telling people *not* to\nbond in such a perspective strikes me as crippling us in the second clause\nof the the commandment to love.  I would claim that only a very few saints\nhave the CAPACITY to deeply love (without sexual tinges or complication,\nmind you) their fellow human beings unless they have had a deeply spiritual\nlife in married union growing together as one flesh -- and that means in\nthe type case, with a persistent and continued sexual relationship.  We\nare human, and little good comes of trying to "mortify the flesh" to the\npoint of pretending to be otherwise, pretending NOT to be sexual beings.\n\n\nIt depends entirely on context.  If that context is major hypocrisy\non the part of those who find us "stumbling blocks" I am much less of\na mind to efface myself so that they can pontificate about MY sins.\n\nThere are some people for whom a life of celibacy is a spritual gift,\nand maybe even a victory against a to-them troubling sexual urge that\nseems to them to lead only to sin.  Nothing I say should ever be read\nas demeaning such a gift.  Nor the even rarer gift of love for all our\nconspecifics, and indeed for all God's creation, that can develop to\nthe full *without* the tutoring of a spousal/helpmate marriage founded\nin sex.  But there is a difference between spiritual gifts and penance;\ntelling people that they HAVE to have a particular gift (or else? what?)\nis fraught with manipulation and disregard of the differences of our\nspiritual endowments from God.  To one person is given the gift of\nspeaking in toungues, to another intepretation of toungues; to yet\nanother prophecy; and to still another teaching.  The notion that some\n*particular* gift is required of *all* is one of the earliest heresies.
My roommate, the atheist, says "to anyone out there who might be \nlistening."
My wifes uncle was a 30+ level mason.  He let me look at some of the books\n(which after his death his "brothers" came over and took from his greiving\nwidow before his body had even cooled).  Don't tell me you don't worship\nOsiris.  You must not be past your 20th level.  You should read Wilkinson's\nEgyptians and how he shows this Egyptian religion paralleling his own British\nMasonry.  There is a man here at this laboratory who is a 33 degree black\nmason.  I've talked with him, though much he likes to hide ("mystery"). \nSpecial handshakes and all.  When he first started trying to "evangelize" me,\nhe told me all kinds on special this, and special that.  Here is truely a\n"mystery" religion.  THere is the public side with motorcyle mania and\nchildrens hospitals and then there is the priviate side that only the highest\ndegree mason every learns of.\nI haven't read it, but the literature that is offered by the silver haired\napologist (can't remember his name) on TV, didn't exactly come to this same\nconclusion.  \n\n"Khons, the son of the great goddess-mother, seems to have been gernaerally\nrepresented as a full-grown god. The Babylonian divinity was also represented\nvery frequently in Egupt in the very same wayas in the land of his nativity\n-i.e. as a child in his mother's arems.  THis was the way in which Osiris, 'the\nson, the husband of his mother,' was often exhibited, and what we learn of this\ngod, equally as in the case of Khonso, shows that in his original he was none\nother than Nimrod.  It is admitted that the secret system of Free Masonry was\noriginally founded on the Mysteries of the Egyptian Isis, the goddess-mother,\nor wife of Osiris.  But what could have led to the union of a Masonic body with\nthese Mysteries, had they not had particular reference to architecture, and had\nthe god who was worshipped in them not been celebrated for his success in\nperfecting the arts of fortification and building?  Now, if such were the case,\nconsidering the relation in which, as we have already seen, Egypt stood to\nBabylon, who would naturally be liiked up to there as the great patron of the\nMasonic art?  The strong presumption is, that Nimrod must have been the man. \nHe was the first that gained faim in this way.  As the child of the Babylonian\ngoddess-mother, he was worshipped in the character of Ala mahozim, 'The God of\nFortification.'  Osiris, the child of the Egyptian Modonna, was equally\ncelebrated as 'the strong chief of the buildings.'  THis strong chief of the\nbuildings was origninally worshipped in Egypt with every physicall\ncharacteristic of Nimrod.  I have already noticed the fact that Nimrod, as the\nson of Cush, was a negro.  Now, there was a tradition in Egypt, recorded by\nPlutarch, that 'Osiris was black'......."  Hislop\n\nIt was like a cold slap to my face, when my wifes uncle brought out his\ncerimonial dress and it was leopard skin.  I mean real leopard skin.   He told\nme that only the highest of degrees wore the leopard skin.  (The reason that he\nstarted telling me all this was that he had just been given a couple of months\nto live and my wife had led him to a saving faith in Christ and he immediately\nrepented from 'mysteries' of the lodge!)\n\nNimr-rod from Nimr, a "leopard," and rada or rad "To subdue."  It is a\nuniversal principle in all idolatries, that the high priest wears the insignia\nof the god he serves.  Any representation of Osiris usually show the wearing of\nsome leopard.  It is interesting that the Druids of Britian also show, or\nshould I say hide, this representation.  They, however, worshipped the "spotted\ncow".\n\nI'll stand by my statements.  Masonry is of the "mystery" religions that all\nfind their source in Babylon, the great harlot. Sorry Peter,  I do not mean to\nbe a "cold slap to the face" but there is to much evidence to the contrary that\nMasonry doesn't find its origins in Egypt.  Of the Masons I have personally\ntalked to, all refered to Egypt as their origin.  Why are you now separating\nyourself from this which not many years ago, was freely admitted?
I recall reading somewhere that a number of bishops spent  a great\ndeal of  time  debating the topic of "how many angels could fit on the\ntip of a needle".\n\n    Does anybody have a reference to this?\n\n    Thanks
I would put it stronger than that.  I consider it nonsense.\n\nSimply put, I do not see any way that a "Platonic essence" could have\nany *real* existance.  "Essence" in the Platonic sense does not have\nany referent as far as I can tell - it is just an imaginary concept\ninvented to provide an explanation for things better explained in\nother ways.\n\nSo, to attribute an 'essence' to God is to attribute to him something that\ndoes not exist!!  Thus the orthodox Platonic formulation seems to leave\nthe unity of God in limbo, since it is based on a non-existant 'essence',\nthus failing to avoid the very problem it was supposed to address.\n\nThus, to me, the unity of God must be primary, and the triality must be\nsecondary, must be modal or aspectual (relating to roles, or to modes\nof interaction), since otherwise there is no meaning to saying God is one.\n\n-- \nsarima@teradata.com			(formerly tdatirv!sarima)\n  or\nStanley.Friesen@ElSegundoCA.ncr.com
: Arrogance is arrogance.  It is not the result of religion, it is the result\n: of people knowing or firmly believing in an idea and one's desire to show\n: others of one's rightness.  I assume that God decided to be judge for our\n: sake as much as his own, if we allow him who is kind and merciful be the \n: judge, we'll probably be better off than if others judged us or we judged \n: ourselves.  \n\nI'm not sure I agree with this 100%.  I agree that arrogance is not the result\nof religion and that God is a far better judge than we are.  I also agree if\nyou mean to say that arrogance shows up in the form of trying to prove one's\nsuperior knowledge, rightness, or holiness over another person's beliefs.\n\nI need to be careful to understand what you mean here so that I do not fall\ninto the mistake of misrepresenting your views.  If I fall down in this area\nI hope you will forgive me.\n\nArrogance is not the result of believing one is right or of believing that\none's God is greater than the god's of others or of believing that one's\nreligion is better than other religions.  These are all naturally self-implied\nbeliefs.\n\nIt is self-contradictory to say that I believe my current beliefs to be wrong.\nWere I to find myself in error, my beliefs would naturally change and follow\nwhat I believe to be right.  Therefore, I must always consider my beliefs\ncorrect.  That's not arrogance.  That's unavoidable behavior.\n\nIt is nonsense to say that I believe another person's god to be greater than\nmy God.  Were his or her god greater, wouldn't I be obligated to change so\nthat their god would become my God?  We are naturally obligated to worship\nthat God which we deem to be the greatest.  Why should we feel obligated to\nworship a second best god for the sake of feeling humble?\n\nArrogance is not necessarily thinking onesself to be better looking or more\nintelligent or stronger or having more resources than another person.  No\ndoubt many will have to chew on this one awhile.  Were passive observation\nof one's superior points arrogance, then God would be most arrogant of all.\n\nHumility does not rest in slandering or belittling God's work of creation in\nour lives.  People often go around trying to be humble saying to one another,\n"I'm not very smart.  I'm poor.  I'm not good looking.  I'm just a worm in\nthe ground.  I'm such a weak person and although I don't want to sin, I\nreally cannot help it."  Were this person truely humble, he would take a\ndifferent approach.  "God, thank you for making me the way you did.  I know\nthat you never do anything second best.  Yet with all that you have given me,\nI have been so unthankful.  You've given me power to resist the devil.  I\nhave not used it but have indulged myself in doing exactly what you have said\nnot to do.  I have slandered your creation in my life and have credited myself\nwith humility for doing so.  Lord, with all you've given me, I have been\ncompletely unfaithful and I do not deserve your forgiveness.  And, yet Your\nlove for me is so boundless that you would give Yourself to die for me to\nsave me.  As terribly evil as I am, I deserve to go straight to hell, yet it\npleases you somehow to rescue me from this terrible life I've led.  Lord,\nplease forgive me and help me stay on the right track so that I can bring\nglory to Your Name instead of insult.  Lord I'm so sorry for my wrongs.  Please\nhelp me to change."\n\n: \n: I think people take exceptional offense to religious arrogance because\n: they don't want to be wrong.  If I find someone arrogant, I typically\n: don't have anything to do with them.\n\nFor me, I've often found it hard to tell the difference.  Often times, the\nmost humble christian has come across to me as arrogant while the most\nproud "worm in the ground" false humility type person has been found to be\nmost comfortable company.\n\nWhen I'm wrong and arrogant about my wrongness, I certainly don't feel like\nbeing confronted by my wrongness.  Were someone to confront me verbally with\nmy wrongness, I'd be likely to snap at them and examine them head to toe for\nall their faults and charge them with hypocricy for what they said to me.\nAt the root, my desire would be to make them shut up so that I can go about\nliving my life arrogantly as I wish.  However, were someone to confront me\nsilently by their example, earn my respect, and perhaps mention it to me in\nhumility in private, I'd feel broken down and challenged to seek God for help\nin changing from the error of my ways.\n\nThe hard part is getting to the point to where I can be humble before anyone\nregardless of their humility or pride--regardless of their hypocricy or\nsincerity--regardless of whether onlookers will frown down upon me or not.\nIt isn't easy to take this pain in love with thankfulness for the opportunity\nto improve in one's ability to serve God.  It's easier to cast aside any hope\nof reaching true humility and merely hide behind slandering God's creation\nin our lives instead.\n\n: But we should examine ourselves [I hope I typed this back in right]\n: and why we react to certain situations with such emotions.  For instance,\n: many of us feel "justified" to be insulted by an arrogant person.  As if\n: we needed a reason to feel insulted.  But after being insulted over and\n: over again by the words of others, you'd think we'd either toughen up\n: or decide not to be insulted, or ignore the insult.  Just because you\n: can justify feelings of anger or insult or outrage, that doesn't make that\n: reaction the appropriate one.  It is in this light of self-examination\n: that we can change our emotional reactions.\n: \n\nSometimes it helps when we can understand and feel the difference between\nwhat is a true statement of our character and what is a false and slanderous\nstatement of our character.  The devil is the accuser of the bretheren.  He\nwould love us to feel hopelessly guilty where we are innocent and feel arrogant\nand self-righteous where we are indeed wrong.  The devil's aim is to get us\ninto as much misery as he can.  Just think of the devil as a cruel and merci-\nless criminal who torments a parent by burning his or her children with\nhot irons.  The way the devil gets under the Father's skin is by hurting\nthose that the Father loves so much.\n\n\n--\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n	"I deplore the horrible crime of child murder...\n	 We want prevention, not merely punishment.\n	 We must reach the root of the evil...\n	 It is practiced by those whose inmost souls revolt\n	 from the dreadful deed...\n	 No mater what the motive, love of ease,\n		or a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent,\n		the woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed...\n	 but oh! thrice guilty is he who drove her\n		to the desperation which impelled her to the crime."
genealogical \nold \n\nWell, since my wife is (in your gentle term) a "bastard", I can\nprobably speak with a bit of authority on this. Any "stigma"\nassociated with children conceived and/or born out of wedlock rests\nsolely upon the parents--they've committed a sexual transgression for\nwhich they should repent. The child itself has no a priori limitations\non him or her; indeed, the concept of blaming the child for the\nparents' sins is one most Mormons would find appalling; note that LDS\ntheology rejects original sin, as the term is usually defined, and the\nsubsequent need for infant baptism (cf. Moroni 8 in the Book of\nMormon).  Indeed, LDS doctrine goes one step further and in some cases\nholds parents responsible for their children's sins if they have\nfailed to bring them up properly (cf. D&C 68:25-28; note that this\npassage applies it only to members of the LDS Church).\n\nAlso note that there is no "big genealogical book in Salt Lake City".\nThe LDS Church has a massive storage facility in the nearby mountains\ncontaining (on microfilm) vital statistic records (birth, christening,\nbaptism, marriage, death) gathered from all over the entire world. I\nmay be misremembering, but I believe they have records for some 2\nbillion people in that vault. At the same time, the LDS Church is\nbuilding up an on-line genealogical database. In neither case is there\nsome kind of "worthiness screening" as to whether someone can be\nentered in. The only potential issue is that of establishing who the\nparents were, and that would apply only in the case of the database.\n..bruce..\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBruce F.

The last time we discussed homosexuality, I asked whether anyone could\nidentify any other act besides homosexual intercourse that the Bible\nprohibited, but which might in some circumstances bring no apparent\nharm to anyone. Put another way, the question is whether homosexual\nintercourse is the only act that Christians are supposed to believe\nis immoral solely on the basis that God says it is, with no insight\nbeing offered as to *why* it is immoral. No one could answer my\nquestion in either form from the Bible. (I did get an interesting\nresponse based on Roman Catholic theology).\n\nHowever, I think now that I can at least answer my first question.\nLink Hudson pointed me to it in his recent comments about sleeping\nwith one's aunt. Incest is held to be immoral in every society,\nthat is, there are some degrees of relationship where marriage\n(and thus, intercouse) is prohibited. The Bible is no exception.\nThe trouble is that it may be difficult to see *why* a particular\nrelationship qualifies as incestuous. Societies differ as to\nhow they define incest. Genetic reasons are sometimes offered, but\nall the Biblical cases cannot be dealt with that way. Why can't\na man sleep with his step mother--assuming that his father is\ndead and that he has "married" her? How does this case differ\nfrom the *duty* to marry one's brother's childless wife.\n\nAre these two cases parallel? Does the Bible prohibit some incestuous\nmarriages and homosexual marriages for the same reason, perhaps\nthat God knows they are not good for us and yet we are incapable\nof understanding why.\n\nP.S. Please don't bother writing me to tell me that I am a homophobe,\nas some did last time. My mind is not made up on these questions.\nYou don't know whether I am homophobic or not. You don't\nknow me. To call me or anyone else a homophobe without knowing the\nperson may be as much an expression of bigotry as some homophobic\nremarks.

From what I understand of my experience in looking up this word, and \ndiscussing it with a Greek-literate individual, the meaning of the \nword is rather clear.  Basically it literally means "he who beds with a man"\nor "he who has sex with a man."  The burden of proof is on the \npro-homosexuality side of the argument to show that the word has an \nidiomatic meaning nor evident from its literal meaning.  One can speculate\nall day long that it might mean something else, but we need evidence\nbefore we create new doctrines, and get rid of the historical understanding\nof the meaning of this word.\n\nLink Hudson.
The Catholic doctrine of predestination does not exclude free\n   will in any way.  Since God knows everything, He therefore knows\n   everything that is going to happen to us.  We have free will, and\n   are able to change what happens to us.  However, since God knows\n   everything, He knows all the choices we will make "in advance" (God\n   is not subject to time).  Too often arguments pit predestination\n   against free will.  We believe in both.\n\nThat last sentence of Steve's is an important one to remember.\n\nThere are certain things in the Catholic religion that cannot be\ncompletely comprehended by a human being.  Were this not the case, it\nwould be good evidence that the religion was man-made.\n\nIn the case of predestination, you have to reconcile two things that\nwould at first appear to be irreconcilable: the sovereignty of God's\nwill over all things, and man's free will in deciding his own fate.\nCatholics believe in both!  But that doesn't mean that anyone has come\nup with a pat reconciliation...
Hi Bruce.  How do you reconcile this practice with Ezekiel 18?\nEzekiel 18:20 "The soul who sins is the one who will die.  The son will not\nshare the guilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the\nson.  The righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and\nthe wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him."\n\nIs Ezekiel 18 not translated correctly in your eyes perhaps?\n\nSincerely,\n\nAaron Cardenas\n\nP.S. I too am bothered to see offensive words being posted on this\nnewsgroup.  Obscenity is out of place for anyone who wants to live by the\nBible (Eph 5:4).\n\nModerator:  I would appreciate your not letting posts with foul language\nthrough, which has happened at least twice lately.  Thank you.

This week, many of you have asked about my earlier postings on OT, NT and\nIntertestiment exegesis on the homosexual issue.  I have refered you to the FAQ\nfiles, which I find out, no longer contains them.  They are too long for me to\nmail to each of you, each article, but will try to get them back on the FAQ\nfile.  \n\nBecause of the renewed interest on this subject, I will type, with permission,\nan article by James DeYoung.  I think it is one of the best articles that I've\nread todate from the conservative position.  I can't post it all at once, so it\nwill come piece meal and not daily.  After I'm done retyping the entire\narticle, I will make it available for the FAQ file.  Talk to clh.\n\nAlso, for those who can't get through to me, you may try one of these:\nREXLEX@FNAL.FNAL.GOV \nLEXREX@ALMOND.FNAL.GOV\nLoren Senders@ADMAIL.FNAL.GOV\n\n                              THE SOURCE AND NT MEANING\n                         OF ARSENOKOITAI, WITH IMPLICATIONS\n                         FOR CHRISTIAN ETHICS AND MINISTRY\n\n\n                                      James B. DeYoung\n                               Professor of New Testament\n                         Western Conservative Baptist Seminary\n                                      Portland, Oregon\n\n     Traditional interpretation of arsenokoitai ("homosexuals") in 1 Cor 6:9\nand 1 Tim 1:10 refers to sexual vice between people of the same sex,\nspecifically homosexualitiy.  Some restrict the term's meaning to "active male\nprostititute," but stronger evidence supports a more general translation,\nnamely "homosexuals."  More recently the definition "homosexual" has been\nopposed on clutural and linguistic grounds, the claim being that the term\n"homosexuals" is anachronistic.  In addition, criticism of the traditional\nrendering says the term today includes celibate homophiles, excludes\nheterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts, and includes female homosexuals. \nA concern for acts instead of the modern attention to desires was the only\nfactor in the ancient world.  The foregoing oppositition to the translation of\narsenokoitai by "homosexuals" has a number of debilitating weaknesses. \nFinally, this study argues that Paul coined the term arsenokoitai, deriving it\nfrom the LXX of Lev 20:12 (cf. 18:22) and using it for homosexual orientation\nand behavior, the latter of which should be an occasion for church discipline\n(I Cor 5-6) and legislation in society (1 Tim 1:8-11).\n\n                      *************************************\n\n                                   INTRODUCTION\n\n     Coincident with the rise of the gay rights movement in recent years has\nbeen an increasing focus on the biblical statements regarding homosexuality or\nsodomy.    As part of this focus, the meaning of the term arsenokoitai, used\ntwice by the apostle Paul (1 Cor 6:9,  I Tim 1:10), has received vigorous\nscrutiny.    This issue is particularly crucial to contemporary society since\nso much of modern ethics is shaped by biblical statements.  More particularly, \nthe concern over gay rights and the place of gays or homosexuals in the church\nand in society require the resolution of biblical interpretation.\n\n     This study of historical, linguistic, and literary matters will survey and\nevalutate recent proposals for the meaning of arsenokoitai and present evidence\nto point to a resolution.  Several writers and their positions represent the\nmodern debate on this word.  Three authors, Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs, have\nprovoked considerable discussion and significantly encouraged the wider\nacceptance of the homosexual lifestyle in society, in the church, and in the\nministry.
For your first set of questions (regarding the energy and will of Christ)\nI quote to you the relevant part of the Statement signed by both Eastern\n(Chalcedonian) and Oriental (non-Chalcedonian) Orthodox scholars a few\nyears ago (Both families = both Orthodox churches) :\n\n1. Both  families  agreed in  condemning  the Eutychian heresy. Both  families\nconfess that the Logos, the Second Person  of the Holy  Trinity, only begotten\nof the Father before the ages  and consubstantial with  Him, was incarnate and\nwas born from the Virgin Mary Theotokos; fully consubstantial with us, perfect\nman with soul, body and mind  ($  \nu o  \upsilon \zeta $); He  was crucified,\ndied, was  buried and rose  from the dead on  the third day, ascended   to the\nHeavenly Father, where He sits on the right hand of the Father as  Lord of all\ncreation. At  Pentecost, by the coming of  the  Holy Spirit He  manifested the\nChurch as His Body. We look forward to His coming again in the fullness of His\nglory, according to the Scriptures.\n\n2. Both  families condemn the  Nestorian heresy and the crypto-Nestorianism of\nTheodoret of  Cyrus. They agree that it  is not sufficient merely  to say that\nChrist is consubstantial both with His Father  and with us, by  nature God and\nby nature man; it is necessary to affirm also that the Logos, Who is by nature\nGod,  became by  nature   man, by His  incarnation  in the fullness  of  time.\n\n3. Both families agree  that the Hypostasis of the  Logos became  composite by\nuniting to His divine uncreated nature with its natural will and energy, which\nHe has  in common with  the Father and  the Holy Spirit, created human nature,\nwhich He assumed  at the Incarnation  and made  His own, with its natural will\nand energy.\n\n4. Both families agree  that the natures  with their proper energies and wills\n   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nare united hypostatically and  naturally   without confusion, without  change,\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nwithout  division and without separation,  and that they are distinguished  in\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nthought alone.\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n5. Both families agree that He who wills and acts is always the one Hypostasis\nof the Logos Incarnate.\n\n[...]\n\nI guess that adresses your question adequately.\n\nAs for your second set of questions, I am afraid they are irrelevant to the\ndiscussion (at least from my point of view) of Monophysitism. I do not see\nhow they relate to the topic we are discussing (other than to start an\nendless Orthodox-RC debate which I do not plan to engage into). As a brief\nanswer to your questions, the position of the Coptic Orthodox Church \nregarding the Roman pontiff, his jurisdiction, his infalability, etc.\nis exactly the same as all the other Orthodox churches.\n\nPeace,\n\nNabil
A recent post bears the subject line:\n\n > Re: Serbian genocide work of God?\n\nThe text contains 80 lines devoted to a defence of the doctrine of\npredestination as applied to the salvation of individuals.

Actually in D&C 68:25-28 the parents are being held accountable for\ntheir own sins.  Specifically they are accountable for their failure\nto teach their children properly.  If I fail to teach my children\nthat stealing is wrong then I am responsible for their theft if they\nlater indulge in such behavior.
The Catholic church has an entirely different view of Mary than do \n"most" other Christian churches (those with parallel beliefs\nnotwithstanding).  Christ, by most accounts, is the only sinless\nperson to ever live.  I too, have trouble with a sinless Mary\nconcept just. \nAs for the related issue of the "original" sin - only Adam and\nEve will answer for that one.  My children do not answer for my sins,\ncertainly I only answer for mine.
Larry -\n\nThanks for the reply, but this isn't quite the same thing.  Like I said before, \nI can understand why non-Christians would be denied *access* to holy \nceremonies, but the ceremony itself (communion) was not secret.  In fact, all \nfour gospels record the first "breaking of the bread" in some detail.  \nCommunion was a fellowship meal, and it was (and still should be, in my \nopinion) inappropriate to invite those who did not share in the fellowship of \nthe Body of Christ.  The fact that unbelievers, denied access to these communal \nmeals, began to imagine all sorts of secret and debased rituals during \ncommunion does not by any means imply that the early Christians were in fact \nhiding shameful things from the general public.  In fact, I think if you read \nsome of the early church fathers, you will find that they were not at all \nbashful about describing what went on during communion.  That's why it seems \nfunny to me when Mormons, who claim to be the only true restoration of 1st \ncentury Christianity, insist on hiding certain rituals on the grounds that they \nare "too sacred."\n\n- Mark
...\n\nIf we take things this literally then we must also forbid women from\nspeaking in church. Paul while led by the holy spirit was human and could\nerr. I find it interesting that CHRIST never discussed the issue of\nhomosexuality, certainly it existed back then and if it was a serious\ntransgression CHRIST would have condemned it. \nI find it disturbing that the modern church spends its energy trying\nto stamp out something that CHRIST didn't consider worth a single word\nof condemnation. CHRIST repeatedly warns us against judgement. \nDon't we risk "judgement in equal measure" when we condemn people who \nGOD himself did not judge when he walked on the earth?\n\n-- \n   |         The love of CHRIST is contagious!       \n --+--                                          \n   |
What we call today the "Old Testament" was being written up to approx-\nimately 168 BCE, according to most modern scholars.  Aside from the book of\nDaniel, the whole OT predates Alexander (the Great).  These books were written\n(predominantly) in Hebrew.\n	There were also other books being written at about this time and later\nby Greek-speaking, or "Hellenistic", Jews.  These books are those which are\nreckoned by many denominations as "Apocrypha".\n	Before the closing of the Writings, the third part of what is today\ncalled the canon, all of the books were in use by Jews of the day.  However,\nthere were those who reckoned (based on Zech. 13) that prophecy had ceased.\nThis faction maintained that there were no true prophets in their day.  They\nalso maintained that literature of a prophetic character could not be genuine\nteachings from God.\n	By the time of c.65 CE, another faction had entered the mess.  Christians\nhad come in claiming that THEIR writings were also suitable to be read in\nsynagogues and used for worship.  Therefore, the Palestinian Jewish leaders\ngot together and stated that the books written from the time of Ben Sira (Sirach)\nonward were not sacred writings.  They justified this from Zech. 13.  In\nparticular, they said, the writings of the Christians (called heretics) were\nnot inspired.\n	At about 90 CE, they codified things further by closing the canon in\nsomewhat of an official sense at the Council of Jamnia.  A few books (Ecclesi-\nastes, Song of Songs, Esther) made it in after that date, but these were those\nwhich had been written prior to the official cut off point (the time of Ben\nSira) for inclusion that they had established in order to keep out the Christian\nand Hellenistic writings.\n	Jerome excluded the 'apocrypha' because they were not in use by Jews\nof his day and because they were (except for Sirach) not found in Hebrew in his\ntime.  His criterion for separating them from the other pre-Christian writings\nwas not based on 'inspiration'.
[continuing with Dr. DeYoung's article-]\n \n               SURVEY OF NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI\n\nD.S. Bailey\n\n     D.S. Bailey was perhaps the trailblazer of new assessments of the meaning\nof arsenokoitai.  He takes the term in I Cor 6:9 as denoting males who actively\nengage in homosexual acts, in contrast to malakoi ("effeminate"), those who\nengage passively in such acts.*4   However, he insists that Paul knew nothing\nof "inversion as an inherited trait, or an inherent condition due to\npsychological or glandular causes, and consequently regards all homosexual\npractice as evidence of perversion" (38).  Hence Bailey limits the term's\nreference in Paul's works to acts alone and laments modern translations of the\nterm as "homosexuals."  Bailey wants to distinguish between "the homosexual\n*condition* (which is morally neutral) and homosexual *practices*" [italics in\nsource].  Paul is precise in his terminology and Moffatt's translation\n"sodomites" best represents Paul's meaning in Bailey's judgment (39).  Bailey\nclearly denies that the homosexual condition was known by biblical writers.\n\nJ. Boswell\n\n     The most influential study of arsenokoitai among contemporary authors is\nthat of John Boswell.*5    Whereas the usual translation*6  of this term gives\nit either explicitly or implicitly an active sense, Boswell gives it a passive\nsense.\n\n      In an extended discussion of the term (341-53), he cites "linguistic\nevidence and common sense" to support his conclusion that the word means "male\nsexual agents, i.e. active male prostitutes."  His argument is that the arseno-\npart of the word is adjectival, not the object of the koitai which refers to\nbase sexual activity.  Hence the term, according to Boswell, designates a male\nsexual person or male prostitute.  He acknowledges, however, that most\ninterpret the composite term as active, meaning "those who sleep with, make\ntheir bed with, men."  Boswell bases his interpretation on linguistics and the\nhistorical setting.  He argues that in some compounds, such as paidomathes\n("child learner"), the paido- is the subject of manthano, and in others, such\nas paidoporos ("through which a child passes"), the paido- is neither subject\nnor object but simply a modifier without verbal significance.  His point is\nthat each compound must be individually analyzed for its meaning.  More\ndirectly, he maintains that compounds with the Attic form arreno- employ it\nobjectively while those with the Hellenistic arseno- use it as an adjective\n(343).  Yet he admits exceptions to this distinction regarding arreno-.\n\n     Boswell next appeals to the Latin of the time, namely drauci or exoleti. \nThese were male prostitutes having men or women as their objects.  The Greek\narsenokoitai is the equivalent of the Latin drauci;  the corresponding passive\nwould be parakoitai ("one who lies beside"), Boswell affirms.  He claims that\narsenokoitai was the "most explicit word available to Paul for a male\nprostitute," since by Paul's time the Attic words pornos ("fornicator") and\nporneuon ("one committing fornication"), found also in the LXX, had been\nadopted "to refer to men who resorted to female prostitutes or simply committed\nfornication."*7\n\n     In the absence of the term from pagan writers such as Herodotus, Plato,\nAristotle, and Plutarch, and from the Jewish writers Philo and Josephus,\nBoswell finds even more convincing evidence for his affirmation that\narsenokoitai "did not connote 'homosexual' or even 'sodomite' in the time of\nPaul" (346).*8   He also demonstrates its absence in Pseudo-Lucian, Sextus\nEmpiricus, and Libanius.  He subsequently finds it lacking in "all discussions\nof homosexual relation" (346)*9  among Christian sources in Greek, including\nthe Didache, Tatian, Justin Martyr, Eusebius,*10    Clement of Alexandria,\nGregory of Nyssa, and John Chrysostom.  Chrysostom is singled out for his\nomission as "final proof" that the word could not mean homosexuality.*11 \n\n     Boswell next appeals to the omission of the texts of I Cor and I Tim from\ndiscussions of homosexuality among Latin church fathers (348).*12   Cited are\nTertullian, Arnobius, Lactantius, and Augustine.  The last named uses\n"circumlocutions."  Other Latin writers include Ausonius, Cyprian, and Minucius\nFelix.  The term is also lacking in state and in church legislation.  By the\nsixth century the term became confused and was applied to a variety of sexual\nactivities from child molesting to anal intercourse between a husband and wife\n(353).\n\n     Having surveyed the sources, Boswell concludes, \n\n   There is no reason to believe that either arsenokoitai or malakoi connoted\n   homosexuality in the time of Paul or for centuries thereafter, and every\nreason\n   to suppose that, whatever they came to mean, they were not determinative of\n   Christian opinion on the morality of homosexual acts (353).\n\nIt is clear throughout that Boswell defines arsenokoitai to refer to male\nprostitutes.  He even goes so far as to conclude that Paul would probably not\ndisapprove of "gay inclination,"  "gay relationships,"  "enduring love between\npersons of the same gender," or "same-sex eroticism"  (112, 166-17).\n\n\n________________________________________________________\n4.

Yet Polycarp, who was a disiple of Hohn\nthe Apostle and died about A.D. 155, argues in the context that young men\nshould be pure.  He uses only the three terms pornoi, malakoi, and arsenokoitai\nfrom Paul's list.

Yet Eusebius uses it in "Demonstraionis evangelicae 1."\n11.  Either Boswell is misrepresenting the facts about Chrysostom's use of\narsenokoitai and its form (about 20) in the vice lists of I Cor 6 or I Tim 1,\nor he is begging the question by denying that the word can mean homosexual when\nChrysostom uses it.  Yet the meaning of arsenokoitai is the goal of his and our\nstudy, whether in the lists or other discussions.  Boswell later admits (351)\nthat Chrysostom uses the almost identicl form arsenokoitos in his commentary on\nI Cor.  Although Boswell suggests that the passage is strange, it may be that\nPaul is seeking to make a refinement in arsenokoitai.  \n12.  Apparently Jerome is a significant omission here, since he renders\narsenokoitai as "masculorum concubitores," corresponding "almost exactly to the\nGreek" (348 n.36).\n\nfootnotes:\n_______________________\n 5.

I hate to sound flippant, having shot off my mouth badly on the net\nbefore, but I'm afraid that much of this material only adds to my\nfeeling that "the assumption of Mary" would be better phrased "our\nassumptions _about_ Mary."  In all the time I've been reading about\nMary on this group, I can not recall reading much about Mary that\ndid not sound like wishful veneration with scant, if any, Scriptural\nfoundation.  \n\nI find in the New Testament a very real portrait of Christ's parents\nas compellingly human persons; to be honored and admired for their\nhumility and submission to God's working, beyond doubt.  But the almalga-\nmation of theories and dogma that has accreted around them gives me\nan image of alien and inhuman creatures, untouched by sin or human\ndesire.  Only Christ himself was so truly sanctified, and even He knew\ntemptation, albeit without submitting to it.\n\nI also don't see the _necessity_ of saying the Holy Parents were some-\nhow sanctified beyond normal humanity: it sounds like our own inability\nto grasp the immensity of God's grace in being incarnated through an or-\ndinary human being.  \n\nI won't start yelling about how people are "worshipping" Mary, etc.,\nsince folks have told me otherwise about that, but I do think we\nlose part of the wonder of God's Incarnation in Christ when we make\nhis parents out to be sinless, sexless, deathless, otherworldly beings.
I don't think the issue of whether infants have faith is relevant or not.\nCertainly they *can*, as the example of John in utero proves. I find the\ntranslation of Col 2 above odd in terms of the circumcision of christ,\nwhich the KJV and RSV put in terms of Christ's cricumcision which we, in\nunion with him *participate* in putting off the body of sins of the flesh.\n\nAlso, perhaps cor 2:12 is dividing the act of burial with him in baptism,\nwhich can be independant of faith, from the experience of rising with\nChrist by faith. Who says both are by faith? This interpretation has the\nadvantage of explaining those who are faithlessly baptized, for whom their\nbaptisim is not benefit, but serves to put them into the kingdom nonetheless.\n\nLike the israelites (all of them, children included) who were baptized in\nthe cloud and in the sea, it was of no advantage because they did not add\nto their baptism faith and obedience.\n\nBaptism does not impart faith, nor is it done strictly speaking on the\nbasis of the faith of the parent, but because of the covcenant promise of\nGod. It imparts grace, the grace of the kingdom, which can be a\npunishement in disguise if there is later apostacy.\n\n\n\nDo you teach a child to pray the Lord's prayer? Do you expect them to not\nsteal? They *can* have faith appropriate to their condition. And in the\nnew covenant, we shall no longer say: know the lord, for they shall all\nknow him from the least unto the greatest Heb 8:11.\n\n\nBut also according to Ezekiel 18, God will not hold innocent anyone on the\nbasis of anyone elses innocense. Thus Jesus could not be our federal head\nany more than adam, *IF* that's what ezekiel is talking about. Shall you\nmake ezekiel 18 contradict the second commandemnt as well?\n\n\n  >\n\nEzekiel 36:25-26 indicates that this new heart will be given by God,\nin the context of the sprinkling of water in baptism. It is the action of\nGod puting them into his new order, and not a question of"personal"\nfaith as such.\n\n\nBut the death that came to all because of sin is not just their personal\ndeath, but the dead state (originbal sin). We are in a covenant of death,\nbecause adam, our federal head gave over his dominion to the devil and death.\n\n\n\nWhile this psalm is figurative in it's language, it is not hyperbolic, and\nthe one does not necessarily imply the other. There is not other\nhyperbolic language in this psalm. What v 5 is likely refering to is \nwhat is symbolized by the OT cleanliness laws (which make intercourse and\nchildbrith both acts which caus uncleannes and seperation from God). The\nwhole psalm is in the language of OT ritual (hyssop, cleansing, burnt\noffering, etc) David's sin with bathsheba included this element, as he\ndid not ritually cleanse himself when he should have. \n\nBut what was symbolized by the OT ritual was the truth that sin was \npassed generationally. That's why the organ of generation had to be\ncut. That's why brith was unclean. Uncleanness was death, and all babies\nwere born dead, and needed to be washed to newness of life, which we have in\nbaptism today.
Ok, what's more important to gay Christians?  Sex, or Christianity?\nChristianity I would hope.  Would they be willing to forgo sex\ncompletely, in order to avoid being a stumbling block to others,\nto avoid the chance that their interpretation might be wrong,\netc?  If not, why not?  Heterosexuals abstain all the time.\n(It would be nice if protestant churches had celibate orders\nto show the world that sex is not the important thing in life)\n\nTo tell the truth, gay churches remind me a lot of Henry the VIII\nstarting the Church of England in order to get a divorce (or is\nthis a myth).  Note that I am not denying that gay Christians are\nChristian.
I'd appreciate some support for this statement.  I'm not sure\nit really makes sense to me.\n\n\nI've heard this frequently - what exactly is Pascal's wager?\n\n\nI don't know.  You point out that your mother's treatment upset you,\nand see inconsistencies in various religions.  I'm not sure if that\nconstitutes broken-ness or not.   It certainly consititutes \ndisillusionment.
This neatly eliminates the need for a savior and "proves" that we can be\nsaved by works alone!  If we have no original sin, then it is possible for\nus to save ourselves by not sinning.  I understand the reasoning behind your\nargument, but it leads to sheer folly.  Original sin is the reason we need\nfaith to be saved.
(Peter White) writes\n\nYou've missed on very important passage.\n\n2 Thess. 1:6-10\n For after all it is only just for God to repay with affliction those who\nafflict you, and to give relief to you who are afflicted and to us as well when\nthe Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in flaming\nfire, dealing out retribution to those who do not know God and to those who do\nnot obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. And these will pay the penalty of\neternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of\nHis power, when He comes to be glorified in His saints on that day, and to be\nmarveled at among all who have believed-- for our testimony to you was\nbelieved.\n\nThings to note from this passage.  Unbelievers are both those who openly reject\nthe gospel, and those who do not know God.  The eternal destruction is the same\nas the eternal hope in 2:16.  This distructions primarily emphasize that it is\nseparation from the presence of God.  THe context is speaking of the 2nd advent\nwhile 2:1 is speaking of the rapture.  Don't confuse the two. \n\nYet we have a far greater discription of hell that we do heaven.\n\n For instance,\n\nIf this was like earthly fire that requires a gas producing substance to\nignite.\nHowever, there seems to be a different type of fire as expressed in the burning\nbush that was not consumed.  Also, the Daniel acct. shows that the laws of\nnature can be interupted even with earthly fire.\n\n\nMaybe you don't understand.  There will be those who are alive at the end of\nthe millenium, who will walk straight into the GWTJ.  Even those who have died\nin their sin will be resurrected, i.e. reunited with their physical body, to\nreceive condemnation.\n\n\nThis is contrary to the teaching of Scripture.\n\n\nTHis is conjecture at best if you are using it to support the "no physical\nbody" thesis.\n\n\nThe true awlfulness of hell, is that it is eternal separation from God, after\nhaving seen the glory of His presence at the GWTJ.  But whether it was open\nrebellion against the revealed gospel of Christ or if it is not having known\nGOd (not saught Him as He is), then as Paul says, they are without excuss and\nthat every mouth will be stopped.  There will be no defense at the judgment\nseat of God. THerefore we understand "it is appointed unto man once to die, and\nthen comes judgment" literally.  \n\njust because it is horrific, doesn't make it less of a reality.  \nit should compel those of us who have the riches of Christ to share it with\nothers
Although simplistic I have always liked the fact that "a Christian is one\nwho not only believes in God, but believes God."  After all the name was\nfirst given externally to identify those who "preached Christ and Him\ncrucified" to pay the price of their rebeliion and shortcomings before\nGod.

Our parent's\nAaron> faith cannot do this.  Do infants have faith?  Let's look at\nAaron> what the Bible has to say about it.\n\nYes, let do.  Try: \n\n"And if anyone causes one of these little ones *who believes in me*\nto sin, it would be better for him to be thrown into the sea\nwith a large millstone tied around his neck."  Mark 9:42\n\n"Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them,\nfor the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.  I tell you\nthe truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God\nlike a little child will never enter it."\n\nThe Colossians passage does not make faith a requirement\nfor baptism.  It merely says that in baptism we are born again,\nregenerated, and resurrected through faith.  In the case\nof an infant I would say that baptism works faith in the\nheart of the infant--through the power of the word.\n\nThe Colossians passage does make baptism a spiritual circumcision.\nCircumcision was the means by which a male infant was made\na part of God's covenant with Israel.  It was commanded to be\nperformed on the eighth day.  The early church understood this,\nand even debated whether baptism had to be performed on the\neighth day, or if it could in fact be done earlier.\n\nAaron> Romans 10:16-17 "But not all the Israelites accepted the good\nAaron> news.  For Isaiah says, 'Lord, who has believed our message?'\nAaron> Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the\nAaron> message is heard through the word of Christ."\n\nAaron> So then we receive God's gift of faith to us as we hear the\nAaron> message of the gospel.  \n\nAnd the gospel is surely preached at any infant's (or adult's)\nbaptism.

So we can have no\nAaron> original guilt from Adam.\n\nHere you show that you just don't understand original sin--\nyou are arguing against a straw man.\nMaybe you've been talking to Catholics too much.  I don't\nknow.  But original sin does not consist of God's imputation\nof Adam's guilt to us.  It consists of our inheritance of\nAdam's sinful nature.  It is actual sin.  See for example,\nthe Augsburg Confession, Article II, and the Apology of the\nAugsburg Confession, Article II, and, for extra credit,\nJohn Knox's `The Scots confession', Article III.\n\nAaron> Now then that we have a little more background as to why\nAaron> original sin is not Biblical, let's look at some of the\nAaron> scriptures used to support it.\n\nAaron> Romans 5:12 "Therefore, just as sin entered the world through\nAaron> one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to\nAaron> all men, because all sinned--"\n\n\nAsk yourself this question.  "Do infants ever die?"  Then ask\nyourself, "If infant baptism is not valid, then where was the\nChristian Church during all the centuries when almost all \nof the baptisms were performed on infants?

For another example of\nAaron> hyperbole, see Luke 14:26.\n\nWho are you to say what is literal and what is not?  Is a literal\ninterpretation manifestly absurd in Psalm 51 by reason of direct\ncontradiction with a clear passage from the Word of God?\n\nYou might also compare Genesis 8:21, "The LORD smelled the\npleasing aroma and said in his heart, `Never again will I curse\nthe ground because of man, even though every inclination of\nhis heart is evil from childhood...."\n\nAaron> We see\nAaron> that he did grow and become wiser in Luke 2:40 and 2:52.  The\nAaron> implication is that Jesus did wrong things as a child before he\nAaron> knew to choose right over wrong.\n\nYou are a long way from proving this (rather monstrous) assertion.\nAll you can say is that Jesus grew in wisdom and in stature.  A\nconclusion that he did wrong as a child is based on an extrapolation\nof reason, not on a direct revelation in Scripture.

I get the feeling that we are debating at cross-purposes--that we\ndo not see the same fundamental assumptions, and this perhaps makes\nmy answers orthogonal to your questions.  I will try again.\n\nPerhaps you believe that nothing exists aside from objectively\nobservable and provable things.  In that case, I cannot show you\nthat there is such thing as a spirit or a spiritual need--these \nthings do not exist in the realm of the objective, but in the\nrealm of the subjective.\n\n(By a.a., I assume you mean Alcoholics Anonymous, and not alt.atheism ;)\nI would not say that AA "handles" spiritual needs.  Rather I would say\nthat AA (and other 12-step programs) help people come to terms with their\nneeds--ie that AA is facilitating the recovery, and that as part of the\nrecovery, they recognize their spiritual needs, and begin to rely on a "higher\npower" (12-step's term) to fill them instead of whatever substance abuse\nthey had been accustomed to.  (Sorry, there is no objective proof here\neither--no way to take 2 identical alcoholics and try to have one recover\nby fulfilling spiritual needs, and one without and externally compare the\ndifference--we are talking about the virtually infinite complexity of\n*people* here.)\n\nSpiritual needs could be defined as things that people need in addition to\nphysical requirements like air, food, sleep, etc.  These are things like\nthe need for love and acceptance, and the need for meaning in life.  If \none denies the existence of spiritual things, one would presumably call \nthese "emotional needs". The reason Christians call them spiritual needs \nis that they have aspects that are not fulfillable except by spiritual \nmeans--ie a person could be loved and accepted by many people, and do \nmany meaningful things, but still have a need for love, which can only be\nsatisfied by the love of God.  Now the problem is that there are people who\naccept the existence of these needs, and people who reject them.  Since I\nbelieve in absolute truth, some of these people are right, and the others\nare wrong.  So here are the 2 possibilities:\n\n1) If Christians are right, then we all have spiritual needs--ie\nwe all need God.  Those who do not realize that they need God are \ndeluded--they just haven't recognized it yet.\n\n2) If Christians are wrong, spiritual needs are an artefact of our brain\nchemicals.  Well-adjusted and properly-integrated personalities do not\nhave such things.  Christians are simply using the concept of God and \nspiritual needs to mask their own inadequacies.\n\nI hate to belabour the point, but the existence of spirits and spiritual\nneeds cannot be objectively demonstrated or proven, just like the existence\nof God cannot.  And yes, this means that there is a risk that all my subjective\nevidence is manufactured by my brain chemicals.  But on the other hand, I \ncould venture into solipsism and say that there is a risk that everything that\nI appear to objectively know is really manufactured by my brain chemicals.\n\nI suspect this is an unsatisfactory answer to a request for evidence and\ndemonstration of the existence of spirits and spiritual needs, but my assertion\nis that such things are not objectively demonstrable.  As I have said before, \nI myself am on the Christian side of agnosticism, having been pushed off the \nfence by subjective evidence.  (And no, I was not raised a Christian, so it \nis not a case of simply accepting what I was indoctrinated with.)
From: db7n+@andrew.cmu.edu (D. Andrew Byler)\n\n1] An english translation of this can be found in:\n   "The Acts of the Apostles, translated from the Codex Bezae, with an\n   introduction on its Lucan Origin and Importance", J. M. Wilson\n   (London, 1923).\n\n2] Another work that might be useful is:\n   "The Acts of the Apostles, a Critical Edition with Introduction and\n   Notes on Selected Passages", Albert C. Clark (Oxford, 1933;\n   reprinted 1970).\n\n(This is an edition of text of Acts that makes the assumption that the\ntext in Codex Bezae is the more authentic.  I don't know if it\nactually contains an english translation or not.)\n\n3] Another useful that discusses many of the variants in detail is:\n   "The Theological Tendency of the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis in\n   Acts", Eldon J Epp (Cambridge, 1966).\n\n4] The most recent reference I found was an edition in French from the\nearly '80s.  (I can supply the reference if anyone's interested.)\n\n5] Now, many of the works are going to be difficult to find.  So if\nyou're interested in examining the differences in the long recension\nan excellent (and easily obtainable) discussion can be found in:\n   "A Textual Commentary on the Greek NT", Bruce Metzger (United Bible\n   Society, 1971).\n\nMetzger's book serves as a companion volume to the UBS 3rd edition of\nthe Greek NT.  It contains a discussion on the reasoning that went\nbehind the decisions on each of the 1440 variant readings included in\nthe UBS3.  Furthermore, notes on an addition 600 readings are\nincluded in aTCotGNT (the majority of these occur in Acts).\n\n   "[An attempt was made] to set before the reader a more or less full\n   report (with an English translation) of the several additions and\n   other modifications that are attested by Western witnesses ...\n   Since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the\n   text-volume, care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the\n   evidence that supports the divergent readings." (p 272).\n\n\n6] Most of the copies of the text of Acts that we have (including the\nones in Vaticanus and Siniaticus) adher pretty closely to the shorter\n(or Alexandrian) version.  The longer version to which you refer is\nusually called the "Western" version and its main witness is the Codex\nBezae (althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources).\n\n7] As far as size, the difference is that in Clark's edition\n(mentioned above) the book of Acts contains 19,983 words whereas the\ntext edited by Westcott and Hort (a typical Alexandrian text) contains\n18,401 words; i.e. a difference of about 8-1/2%.\n\n8] To answer the obvious questions, no, there are no major revelations\nin the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text.  The main\ndifference seems to "expansion" of detail in the Western text (or, if\nyou prefer "contractions" in the Alexandrian).  The Western text seems\nto be given to more detail.  There are some interesting specific\ncases, but this probably not the place to go into it in detail.\n\n9] The discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the\nmore authentic has been hot and heavy.  If there is anything\napproaching a modern consensus it is (i) that neither text represents\npurely the "authentic" version, (ii) each variant reading has to be\nexamined on its own merits however, (iii) the variant in the\nAlexandrian text is the "better" more often than not.
Indeed, the immediate context [NASB] is:\n\n  26 Otherwise, He would have needed to suffer often\n  since the foundation of the world; but now once at\n  the consummation He has been manifested to put away \n  sin by the sacrifice of Himself.\n\n  27 And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die\n  once, and after this comes judgement;\n\n  28 so Christ also, having been offered once to bear\n  the sins of many, shall appear a second time, not to\n  bear sin, tro those who eagerly await him.\n\n\nThe first point is that this verse is part of an even larger\ncontext, the subject of which is not the destiny of the\nindividual human soul but rather the singular nature of Christ's\nsacrifice, "once", and the fulfillment of the law for all of fallen \nmankind.  Rudolf Frieling elaborates this in detail in his \n"Christianity and Reincarnation".  The thrust of the passage\nin its context is to liken the one time incarnation and \nsacrifice of Christ for all mankind to the individual \nexperience of the human being after death.  The "once" \nis repeated and emphasized, and it highlights the singularity \nof Christ's deed.  One thing for certain it does is to \nrefute the claims of some that Christ incarnates more than \nonce.  But the comparison to the human experience - die \nonce, then judgement (note: not "the judgement", but just \n"judgement".  The word for judgement is "krisis".\n\nHebrews 9:27 is the one passage most often quoted in defense\nof the doctrine that the Bible denies reincarnation.  At this\npoint, I would just emphasize again that the  passages \nthat (arguably) speak against it are few, and that invariably\nthey are talking about something eles, and the apparent denial\nof reincarnation is either inferred, or, as in the case of\nHebrews, taken literally and deposited into an implied context,\nnamely a doctrine of the destiny of the human being after\ndeath.\n\nWhat should be considered seriously is that the Bible is essentially\nsilent about the fate of the individual human being between death\nand the Last Day.  If you take the few passages that could possibly\nbe interpreted to mean a single earth life, they are arguable.  And\nthere are other passages that point, arguably, in the other direc-\ntion. such as Matthew 11:14 and John 9:2.\n\nWe can continue to debate the individual scraps of scripture that\nmight have a bearinig on this, and indeed we should discuss them.\nBut what I wanted to introduce into the discussion was an approach\nto the idea of repeated earth lives that, unlike Hindu, Buddhist\nand "new age" teachings, takes full cognizance of the divinity, singular\nincarnation, death, burial, resurrection, and second coming of Christ\nas the savior of mankind; the accountability of each individual for\nhis deeds and the reality of the Fall and of sin and its consequences;\nthe redemption of man from sin through Christ; the resurrection of\nthe body, and the Last Judgement.\n\nTaken in this larger sense, many serious questions take on an entirely\ndifferent perspective.  E.g. the destiny of those who died in their\nsins before Christ came. the relationship of faith and grace to \nworks, the meaning of "deathbed conversion", the meaning of the\nsacraments, and many other things.  Not that I propose to answer all\nthose questions by a simple doctrine of convenience, but only that\nthe discussion takes on a different dimension, and in my opinion\none that is truly worthy of both man, the earth, and their Creator and \nRedeemer. There are many deep questions that continue to be deep, such \nas the meaning of the second death, and how the whole of Christian\ndoctrine would apply to this larger perspective of human existence.\n\nThere are those who deeply believe that the things of which the Bible \ndoes not speak are not things we should be concerned with.  But Christ\nalso indicated that there were other things that we would come to know\nin the future, including things that his disciples (and therefore others) \ncould not bear yet.  This idea that the human capacity for growth in\nknowledge, not only of the individual in one lifetime, but of the whole\nof humanity, also takes on great meaning when we realize that our growth\nin the spirit is a long term process.  The Bible was not meant to codify\nall spiritual knowledge in one place forever, but to proclaim the gospel\nof the incarnation and redeeming deed of Christ - taking the gospel in the\ngreater context, from Genesis to Revelation.  Now, salvation (healing) becomes, \nnot the end of man's sojourn but its beginning.  And the Last Judgement and\nthe New Heaven and Earth that follow it become its fulfullment.
Well, suppose your mother was a crack addict and crack user/abuser while\nshe was pregnant? Suppose your husband gave you some SDT (this recently\nhappened to a close friend of my wife and mine)?\n\nOFTEN, the consequences of our sin are at least partially inflicted on\ninnocent people. Several times in the OT, this is pointed out, even\nsaying that descendants would suffer consequences for a person's sin\nfor several generations. Even today, we see multi-generational (to\ncoin a phrase) effects from alcoholism, child abuse, and spousal\nabuse just to name three.\n\nSo, God's definition of fair and ours differ.\n\nSome points of perspective:\n\nThough the predisposition towards sinning is now inbred (see Webster's\nfirst definition of inbred) thanks to Adam, it is arrogant and foolish\nfor any of us to think we would have done any different if we were in\ntheir shoes. I know myself pretty well, and I'm just not that good. Take\nGod's word for it, neither are you. "There is no one righteous..."\n\nMore important, when a person decides to be a disciple of Jesus, God\npromises supernatural help in overcoming our physical self's sinful\ntendency. We can, of course, choose to ignore this help. (Rom 7,8)\n\n"...God made mankind upright, but men have gone in search of many\nschemes." -Eccl\n\nMark
Gee, I think there are some real criminals (robbers, muderers, drug\naddicts) who appear to be fun loving caring people too.  So what's\nyour point?  Is it OK. just because the people are nice?
Jung may have said that, but he was in no way speaking for the\nCatholic Church.  The dogma of the Assumption in no way means Mary is\nconsidered to be God or part of "the Godhead."  Therefore it implies no\nsuch thing about the feminine in general.\n\n   Also Jung's statement makes it sound as though the dogma was\nannounced "out of the blue."  This also is incorrect, as dogma is only\nthe formulation of what has always been part of Tradition.  This dogma\nhas always been believed, but was not formally defined until the\nAssumption was declared as an _ex cathedra_ statement.
I'm about to revise my resume and was wondering if I should put on there the\nfact that I'm a Christian.  Give me some input on what you think.
Romans 10:16-17 "But not all the Israelites accepted the good news.  For\n   Isaiah says, 'Lord, who has believed our message?'  Consequently, faith\n   comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word\n   of Christ."\n\n   So then we receive God's gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the\n   gospel.  Faith is a possible response to hearing God's word preached.  Kids\n   are not yet spiritually, intellectually, or emotionally mature enough to\n   respond to God's word.  Hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot\n   be raised in baptism to a new life.\n\nCatholics view the effects of Baptism slightly differently, and that's\none primary reason why they baptize babies.  They believe that Baptism\nproduces a change in the soul of the baby, quite independently of any\nvolitional act on the part of the baby.  This change in the baby's\nsoul gives the infant certain capabilities that he would not have\nwithout Baptism.  Since the infant does not have the use of his\nintellect and will yet, these new faculties are dormant.  But as the\nchild gets older, the gifts of Baptism come more and more into play.\n\n   Ezekiel 18:20 "The soul who sins will die.  The son will not share the\n   guilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son.  The\n   righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the\n   wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him."\n\n   If you read all of Ezekiel 18, you will see that God doesn't hold us guilty\n   for anyone else's sins.  So we can have no original guilt from Adam.\n\nAdam was given a number of gifts by God.  The chief among them was\nwhat Catholics call "sanctifying grace".  (In the New Testament, the\nword used for this is "charity".)  By his sin, Adam lost this grace.\nHe didn't lose it just for himself, however, he lost it for the whole\nhuman race.  Because once he lost it, he couldn't pass it on to his\ndescendents.\n\nThat's why Catholics baptize babies.  Through his Original Sin, Adam\nlost sanctifying grace for all his descendents.  Christ instituted\nBaptism to give it back to everyone.
Interesting question, esp since I remember *wishing* with all\nmy heart that this *were* true so that I wouldn't have to be a \n"good Christian" anymore.  "Christianity" was terribly hard, the\nonly reward was Heaven and (maybe, sometimes, if I was really\ngood) acceptance; I wanted a way out.\n\n\nWhat Jesus has done for me since I found Him (some 6 months ago) \nI do not want to lose.  Period.  \n\nThat said, I originally interpreted the What-If as "if Christ\nnever mentioned Sheol and weeping and gnashing of teeth, if\nChrist preached that those who did not follow him died and stayed\ndead and at that point forever ceased to exist...."\n\n\nI believe that we can only be complete through Christ. \nDo you think that Buddhists can also be complete?\n\n-jen\n\n--

I can see that some of the above verses do not clearly address the issues, \nhowever, a couple of them seem as though they do not require "incredibly \nperverse interpretations" in order to be seen as condemning homosexuality.\n\n"... Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolators, nor adulterers, \nnor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, \nnor revilers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom  of God.  And such were \nsome of you..."  I Cor. 6:9-11.\n\nWould someone care to comment on the fact that the above seems to say\nfornicators will not inherit the kingdom of God?  How does this apply\nto homosexuals?  I understand "fornication" to be sex outside of\nmarriage.  Is this an accurate definition?  Is there any such thing as\nsame-sex marriage in the Bible?  My understanding has always been that\nthe New Testament blesses sexual intercourse only between a husband\nand his wife.  I am, however, willing to listen to Scriptural evidence\nto the contrary.\n\n"You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an\nabomination.  Also you shall not have intercourse with any animal to\nbe defiled with it, nor shall any woman stand before an animal to mate\nwith it; it is a perversion."  Lev. 18:22-23.\n\nI notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the\nverse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.  I know\nof no New Testament passages that clearly condemn, or even mention,\nintercourse with animals.  Do those who argue for the legitimacy of\nhomosexual intercourse believe that the Bible condemns bestiality as a\nperversion, and if so, why?  That is, what verses would you cite to\nprove that bestiality was perverted and sinful?  Could the verses you\ncite be refuted by interpreting them differently?  Can one be a\nChristian zoophile?\n\nBy the way, I myself am subject to sexual desires that I did not\nchoose to have and that many people would regard as perverted and\nsinful, so please understand that I am not asking these questions out\nof an antipathy towards my fellow "people of alternative\norientations".  I do believe, however, that one should read the Bible\nwith an attitude of "what is the Bible trying to say" and not "what do\nI WANT the Bible to say."  I choose not to give in to my "perverted"\nsexual desires because I believe the Bible tries to tell me, whether I\nlike it or not, that such things are sin.  It is frustrating at times,\nand I have had days where it really got me down, but I don't blame God\nfor this, I blame the sin itself.\n\n- Mark\n\n[There's some ambiguity about the meaning of the words in the passage\nyou quote.  Both liberal and conservative sources seem to agree that\n"homosexual" is not the general term for homosexuals, but is likely to\nhave a meaning like homosexual prostitute.  That doesn't meant that I\nthink all the Biblical evidence vanishes, but the nature of the\nevidence is such that you can't just quote one verse and solve things.\n\nI think your argument from fornication is circular.  Why is\nhomosexuality wrong?  Because it's fornication.  Why is it\nfornication?  Because they're not married.  Why aren't they married?\nBecause the church refuses to do a marriage ceremony.  Why does the\nchurch refuse to do a marriage ceremony?  Because homosexuality is\nwrong.  In order to break the circle there's got to be some other\nreason to think homosexuality is wrong.
I agree, with the exception that I don't preach ignoring our cultures.\n\n\nIn Revelation 2-3, we see that in the first century church, there was one\ncongregation in each major city.  So there was one unified church.  Now in\neach city, there were people of different cultures.  Naturally, they\nformed something of a stew, with different members having different\nheritages.  Nevertheless, they were ONE body.  They met together,\nsometimes as smaller groups in their homes and sometimes in bigger groups\nin places such as the temple courts.\n\nNow in a particular city, then and now, you will find that there is a\ncommon language associated with that region.  For instance, in Rome, Latin\nwas spoken.  In the United States today, English is spoken.  So it would\nmake sense that congregations in different cities would speak the common\nlanguage and not necessarily Latin.\n\nNaturally, you would expect the lead evangelist to preach in the common\nlanguage.  In the first century church, there were probably many people\nin the congregation who could speak a given tongue to translate the\nmessage for people of foreign ethnic groups.  Today, however, you don't\nsee people speaking in tongues to translate sermons, even in so-called\nPentacostal churches.  We do have a modern day equivalent though --\nbi-lingual speakers.  Now in the unified church of which I am a member -\nsometimes called the International Churches of Christ, when we all meet\ntogether on Sundays, there are headphones on people who don't speak\nEnglish from which they hear an ongoing translation of the sermon in their\nnative tongue.  Neat idea, huh?\n\nNow, we meet in different size groups in a random sort of way on Sundays,\nso sometimes there will be a meeting of only Haitians or of Spanish-\nspeaking people, for example, who will hear an evangelist preach in their\nnative language.  In addition, we meet in small groups a couple of times\nduring the week for Bible discussion groups and Devotionals.  So someone\nwho speaks a different language will almost always be with people who also\nspeak his language (assuming the congregation is large enough) for those\nmeetings.\n\nAs for the people who speak the common language, they can keep in touch\nwith their culture, if they want, but they will also have equally deep\nfriendships among their church relationships with people of many various\nnationalities.  \n\n\nThe action of letting Catholics worship in a native language instead of\nLatin?  Indeed not!  See my second paragraph in response to the second\nclipping of your article.\n\nHowever, if you mean the action of forming denominations based on a\nculture, then the purpose of the church has been indeed thwarted.\n\nI'll assume the second possiblility when answering your next clipping.\n\n\nYou have met some needs of people, certainly, by helping them to be proud\nof their cultural heritages when most denominations didn't.  Yet you have\nlargely isolated yourselves from having quality "Christian" friendships\noutside your nationality (and your denomination).\n\nWe shall certainly give people a place to feel comfortable with their\nheritage.  However, we will do this in a way that does not destroy church\nunity, but rather encourages friendships among all disciples.\n\n\nIt sounds like these groups have wonderful intentions, but they are going\nabout things in the wrong way.  And names like the African Methodist\nEpiscopal Church still make me cringe, although not as much as before.\n\nI understand that there was more racism in the past that caused such\ngroups to be formed, but now we should try to unite.  I know that it's\nhard for many people on this newsgroup to imagine there being only one\nbody of people on earth, but it is quite possible, and I am working to\nmake it happen.  However, what might be a smaller step towards unity,\nwould be taking the word "African" out of your denomination's name.  Then\nperhaps someday a long time off, you can also remove the "Methodist\nEpiscopal" part also, and simply be part of "the Church".\n\n\nThere shall be one church, for the sake of unity, AND it shall be useful\nin helping students new to America make the transition in culture,\nlanguage, and thought.  We shouldn't make a new denomination to try to\nsolve problems.  The whole denominational mindset only causes more\nproblems, sadly.  \n\n\nThank you for the invitation.  That shows me that you indeed have the\nheart to spread the gospel of Jesus as well as take part in your cultural\nheritage.  Thank you also for responding to my post.  I know (all too well)\nhow they can be very time-consuming.\n\nThe whole idea of celebrating your culture is paved with good intentions,\nbut I still feel that you must restore and preserve unity at the same\ntime.  My own church, the Boston church, has the acapella singing that you\nmentioned in your post, yet doesn't limit expression of my Mexican\nculture, even though I am in the MIT Campus ministry and not the Spanish\n(speaking) Zone.  I have made a commitment to God that I will go to the\nSunday services of my church, because I know that my brothers and sisters\nhere are fully devoted in love for God as his disciples.\n\nI don't believe in tongues, as you may have already picked up on, because\nof my understanding of Biblical Christianity.  However, I am certainly\nwilling to visit your congregation provided that it doesn't interfere with\nmy normal worship.  Since you also live in Cambridge, I also extend an\ninvitation to you to visit our services as often as you like.  You can\nmeet the MIT students at the Student Center (across from 77 Mass. Ave.) at\n9AM on Sundays to leave for worship or simply call me after Wednesday\nnight to find out where the service will be held on a particular day.\nMy number is 225-7598, but will be 354-1357 in a few weeks from now and\nfor the rest of the summer.  Our service normally last from 10AM to noon,\nbut occasionally are later or earlier (1-3 times per year).  \n\n\nDefinitely!\n\nLet's also strive to grow in obedience to the Lord through being men and\nwomen after God's own heart.
I don't know either.  Truth be known, so little is known of angels\nto even guess.  All we really know is that angels ALWAYS speak in\nthe nativ tongue of the person they're talking to, so perhaps they\ndon't have ANY language of their own.\n\n\nWell, we are told to test the spirits.  While you could do this\nscripturally, to see if someones claims are backed by the bible,\nI see nothing wrong with making sure that that guy Lazarus really\nwas dead and now he's alive.\n\n\nIt's a common fallacy you commit.  The non-falsifiability trick.  How\ncan I prove it when not all the evidence may be seen?  Answer:  I\ncan't.  The fallacy is in assuming that it is up to me to prove \nanything.  \n\nWhen I say it has never been proven, I'm talking about the ones\nmaking the claims, not the skeptics, who are doing the proving.\n\nThe burden of proof rest with the claimant.  Unfortunately, \n(pontification warning) our legal system seems to be headed in\nthe dangerous realm of making people prove their innocence (end\npontification).\n\nBut truthfully, Corinthians was so poorly written (or maybe just\nso poorly translated into English) that much remains unknown\nabout just what Paul really intended (despite claims of hard\nproof one way or another).  Some will see his writings in\n1 cor 12-14 as saying don't do this don't do this and using\nsarcasm, metaphor, etc. while yet others take what he says literally\nsarcasms and metaphors notwithstanding.
Perhaps one other thing I should have added is that Jeremiah's prophesies\nabout the coming destruction of Jerusalem would have been understood by\nthe people of that time to be a full frontal assault on their understanding\nof their relationship with the Lord. Today the if the general populace \nhears "prophesies" like the Portland earthquake or New York will burn\nones, they are unlikely to see it in the context of their relationship\n(or lack of it) with the Lord. They are far more likely to think that\nthey are just the result of the fevered imaginations of a religious nutter.\nThat is one reason why I am always deep;y suspicious of bald judgement\nprophesies without any explanation of the reasons for the judgement. This\ndoesn't have to be long winded. To see a relatively modern example look\nat Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural speech. The relevant section is\nbelow. It is this type of spiritual insight which was missing in both\nprophesies posted here.\n\n--- Excerpt from Abraham Lincoln's 2nd Inaugural speech----\n\nBoth read the same Bible, and pray \nto the same God; and each invokes His aid against the other. It may seem \nstrange that any men should dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing \ntheir bread from the sweat of other men's faces; but let us judge not\nthat we be not judged. The prayers of both could not he answered that of neither\nhas been answered fully. The Almighty has His own purposes. ''Woe unto the\nworld because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to\nthat man by whom the offence cometh" If we shall suppose that American \nSlavery is one of those offences which, in the provdence of God, must needs come\nbut which, having  continued through  His appointed time, He now wills to remove\nand that He gives to both North and South, this terrible war, as the woe due to\nthose by whom the offence came, shall we discern therein an departure from\nthose divine attribute which the believers in a Living God always  ascribe \nto Him ? Fondly do we hope - fervently do we pray - that this mighty \nscourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue, \nuntil all the wealth piled by the bond-man's two hundred and fifty years of \nunrequited  toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn  with \nthe lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three \nthousand  years ago, so still it must be said "the judgments of the Lord, \nare true and righteous altogether"\n  With malice toward none; with charity for all;  with firmness in the right, \nas God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we \nare in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have \nborne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan - to do all which \nmay achieve and cherish a just, and a lasting peace, among ourselves, \nand with all nations.\n\n\n--\n                                                                     ___\nBill Rea                                                            (o o)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------w--U--w---
I certainly agree with the last paragraph.  Also, Jesus;s statements on\nhell can be treated as totally symbolic, allegorical or as parables, as\nwas much of his other teaching.  There's more than enough hell here on earth\nthat we are freed from by following Jesus that the rest just doesn't mattter\nto me.  And the fact that we can be free of the hell here is the best gift\nGod offers.  Eternal life begins for us now and we do not wait to start\npartaking of the divine nature and journeying on the path to deification.\n\nLarry Overacker (llo@shell.com)\n--
Are there any members of conservative, religious, politically active groups\n(such as the Christian Coalition) out there?  I come from a very liberal \nbackground, and I'd like to talk to some conservative people out there in a \npublic forum (such as this one.)  I frankly can't understand the rationale or\nChristian basis for much of the conservative position, and I'd like to try and\nlearn more about this movement--after all, we're part of the same church.  Is\nanyone interested in explaining a bit about the conservative viewpoint?\n  Thanks.
Gaining entry into heaven cannot be done without first being cleansed by \n the blood of Jesus. \n Sin cannot dwell in heaven.  It is against the natural laws of God. \n Being converted to christianity means being baptized by the Holy Spirit. \n You cannot get to heaven by good works only. \n Because of the union with the holy spirit, the man's behavior will change. \n If there is true union he will not desire to be homosexual.  Fornication \n and homosexuality will leave your life if you are truly baptized by the \n holy spirit.  It's not to say that we don't stumble now and then.
: Recently an e-mail to me mentioned:\n\n: (Technically, the messengers aren't even human so\n: it *can't* be a case of "homosexuality" -- even of rape.) [...]\n\n: The Jude reference to Sodom is also meaningful only in the context of\n: the Sodomites' "lust" for the "other flesh" of angels.  Again,\n: application to homosexual behavior in general, or to the position of\n: gay Christians is largeely specious.\n: ***\n: Are angels "flesh"? No. I feel that this is saying that it was because\n: of their lust after other men, who are flesh( or of this world).\n\n: what are other opinons on this? I haven't heard much about this verse  \n: at all.\n\nBo Reike in the Anchor Bible volume on _James, Peter, and Jude_ points\nout that all the examples given in this section of Jude are distinguishing\nthe elect from _apostates_, not just the wicked in general.  Hence, those\nwho were delivered from Egypt, but did not follow Moses (and, by extension,\nGod); the apostate angels; and Sodom and Gomorrah.  Quoting Reike:\n\n	"Fornication may here, as often in the New Testament,\n	refer to idolatry, while "flesh" (as in I Pet 1:24) \n	denotes human society and its violent attempts at self-\n	exaltation.  Sodom and Gommorrah represent the leaders\n	of apostasy, and the surrounding cities correspond to\n	their followers." [p. 199]\n\n\nThere is no inherent reason to read this verse (7) as literally referring\nto actual sexual lust for "alien flesh".  Nor is it inherently necessary\nto understand it as referring to homosexuality, outside of the circular\nreasoning that has already concluded that the sin of Sodom is the sin\nof homosexuality.  The only place that the sin of Sodom is specified, and\nnot merely inferred, is in Ezekiel 16:49 "This was the guilt of your sister\nSodom: she and her daughters had pride, excess of food, and prosperous ease,\nbit did not aid the poor and needy.  They were haughty, and did abominable\nthings before me; therefore I removed them when I saw it.\n\nFor the same reason (overliteralizing the text) your correspondent's\nsuggestion that the reason the passage doesn't deal with homosexuality\nis because the guests were angels and not men is just silly.  There \nare much more solid reasons for pointing out the irrelevance of the\nSodom passages for dealing with homosexuality per se.
The Apocryphal books that are in the Septuagint were part of the canon \nused by the Greek-speaking churches from the inception of the church.\nThey were not added later (or much later).  This is a common misconception.\n\nThe preference of the Hebrew canon over the Greek canon is a later\ninnovation.   The church did not need to be guided to "add" the books\nsince they were part of the faith once received by the apostles and\npassed to the Church.\n\nLarry Overacker (llo@shell.com)\n--

So what's\n: your point?  Is it OK. just because the people are nice?\n\nThe point is not about being "nice."  "Nice" is not a christian virtue.  The\npoint is that the gifts and fruits of the spirit (by their fruits you shall\nknow them- Mt 7:20) are manifested by and among prayerful, spirit-filled\nGAY christians.  It was the manifestation of the spirit among the gentiles\nthat convinced Peter (Acts 10) that his prejudice against them (based on\nscripture, I might add) was not in accordance with God's intentions.\n\n: I think the old saying " hate the sin and not the sinner" is\n: appropriate here.  Many who belive homosexuality is wrong probably\n: don't hate the people.  I don't.  I don't hate my kids when they do\n: wrong either.  But I tell them what is right, and if they lie or don't\n: admit they are wrong, or just don't make an effort to improve or\n: repent, they get punished.  I think this is quite appropriate.

You may be suprised.\n\nOf course the whole issue is one of discernment.  It may be that Satan\nis trying to convince us that we know more than God.  Or it may be that\nGod is trying (as God did with Peter) to teach us something we don't\nknow- that "God shows no partiality, but in every nation anyone who fears\nhim and does what is right is acceptable to him." (Acts 10:34-35).

If I get a chance I will ask them this weekend.\n\n                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThe words I have underlined are at the heart of the problem. A "quick\nlook" doesn't do justice to the depth of the book of Jeremiah. Having\nstudied the Jeremiah/Ezekial period solidly for over a year at one\nstage of my life, I have to say that there is a great deal of underlying\ntheological meaning in the judgement prophesies. Let me make one point.\nThe clash between Jeremiah and the "false prophets" was primarily in\nthe theological realm. The "false prophets" understood their relatioship\nto God to be based on the covenant that the Lord made with David. It is\npossible to trace within the pages of the Old Testament who this covenant,\nwhich was initially conditional on the continued obedience of David's\ndescendants, came to be viewed as an unconditional promise on the part\nof the Lord to keep a descendant of David's upon the throne and to never\nallow Jerusalem to subjegated by any foreign power. Jeremiah was not a\nJudahite prophet. He was from Anathoth, across the border in what had formerly\nbeen Israelite territory. When he came to prophesy, he came from the\ntheological background of the covenant the Lord had made with Israel\nthrough Moses. The northern Kingdom had rejected the Davidic covenant\nafter the death of Solomon. His theology clashed with the theology of the\nlocal prophets. It was out of a very deep understanding of the Mosaic\ncovenant and an actute awareness of international events that Jeremiah\nspoke his prophesies. The "judgement prophesies" were deeply loaded with\ntheological meaning.\n\nIn my opinion, both the Portland earthquake prophesy and the David Wilkerson\n"New York will burn" prophesy are froth and bubble compared to the majestic\ntheological depths of the Jeremiah prophesies.\n\n--\n                                                                     ___\nBill Rea                                                            (o o)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------w--U--w---
Sorry, I put my foot in my mouth, concerning the church's history.\nIt is correct to say that the Council of Hippo 393 listed the \ndeuterocanonical books among those accepted for use in the\nchurch, and that this was ratified by the Council of Carthage,\nand by Pope Innoent I and Gelasius I (414 AD).\n\n\n"At the end of the fourth century views still differed in regard to\nthe extent of the canon, or the number of the books which should\nbe acknowledged as divine and authoritative.\n\n   The Jewish canon, or the Hebrew bible, was universally \nreceived, while the Apocrypha added to the Greek version\nof the Septuagint were only in a general way accounted as books\nsuitable for church reading, and thus as a middle class between\ncanonical and strictly apocryphal (pseudonymous) writings.\nAnd justly; for those books, while they have great historical\nvalue, and fill the gap between the Old Testament and the New,\nall originated after the cessation of prophecy, and the cannot\nbe therefore regarded as inspired, nor are they ever cited\nby Christ or the aposteles."\n\n"In the Western church the canon of both Testaments was closed\nat the end of the fourth century through the authority of\nJerome (who wavered, however, between critical doubts and the\nprinciple of tradition), and more especially of Augustine,\nwho firmly followed the Alexandrian canon of the Septuagint,\nand the preponderant tradition in reference to the Catholic\nEpistles and the Revelation; though he himself, in some\nplaces, inclines to consider the Old Testament Apocrypha\nas *deutero* canonical, bearing a subordinate authority."\n\nThis history goes on to say that Augustine attended both the\nCouncil of Hippo and of Carthage.\n\nIt is interesting to note, however, the following footnote to\nthe fourth session of the Council of Trent.  The footnote \nlists various Synods which endorsed lists of canonical \nbooks, but then says "The Tridentine list or decree was the\nfirst *infallible* and effectually promulgated declaration\non the Canon of the Holy Scriptures."\n\nWhich leads one to think that the RC canon was not official\nuntil Trent.  Thus my previous erroneous statement was\nnot entirely groundless.\n\nIt is also interesting to note that the Council of Trent\nwent on to uphold "the old Latin Vulgate Edition" of \nthe Scriptures as authentic.  Which, I would suppose, \ntoday's Catholic scholars wish the Council had never said.\nAlso the council made no distinction between deutero-canonical\nand canonical books--in contrast to (Eerdman's statement of) the\nfourth century views.
This idea, that the Reformers somehow were the first to bring the\nBible to the people in their own language, is a myth.  Many vernacular\ntranslations of the Bible existed long before the Reformation.  The\nVulgate Bible, which is still the official version of the Bible for the\nCatholic Church, was itself a translation in the common (i.e. vulgar ==\nvulgate) tongue of its day, Latin, and had existed for about a millenium\nbefore the Reformation.\n\n   It might also be noted that the printing press was not even invented\nuntil the same century as that in which the Reformation occurred.
That was my point. If I play poker with Monopoly money I can bet \nanything I want.\n\n\nThis is exactly why Christianity is missionary in nature,\nnot just out of a need to irritate. 8-)\n \n\nTo the people who wrote the Bible and to whom the Bible is written,\nthere is evidence of love, but that is a cultural bias. This is\na poor answer which you needn't rebut.\n\nI will now pull the old bait and switch.\n\nI think you should use the Bible to judge man, not God.\nBy that I mean, if your moral intuition doesn't like what\nis described in the Bible, realize that such things are going on\nnow. I will avoid the semantic arguments about the cause of evil\nand ask what are you doing to fight it? Not you specifically,\nbut everyone, including myself. If I don't like the genocide\nin the Bible, what about the genocide that goes on right now?\nTo move beyond the question of a hell, realize that many people\nright now are suffering. If you think hell isn't fair and are\nwilling to sacrifice everything just to deny its existence,\nwhat about how life isn't fair? Right now there is a young mother\nwith three little kids who doesn't know how she will get through\nthe day. Right now there is a sixth grader who is a junkie.\nRight now there is an old man with no friends and no money to\nfix his TV. Instead of why doesn't God help them ask why don't\nwe help them. I think you are correct to challenge any Christian\nwho doesn't live his life with the compassion you seem to possess.\n\nYou want evidence of God. Find someone who is making a difference,\nsomeone you admire, someone who has been through some tough times\nand has come out with his head up. Ask the person how he does it. Ask \nthe Vietnam vet who was battle medic how he kept his mind. Ask the \nwoman who was pregnant at 15, kept the baby and now is a successful\nbusiness woman. Ask the doctor who has operated on a 1-1/2 pound\nbaby. They won't all be Christians, or even what you might\ncall religious, but there will be something in common.\n\nGod is not defined in the Bible, God is defined by what is\nin those people's hearts. It doesn't matter if you can't give\nintellectual assent to any description you've heard, they're\nall wrong anyway. The compassion you already feel in your heart \nis a step in the right direction. Follow that instead.\nThen come back and read the Bible and you'll see that same\nthing described there.\n\n\nGood, I guess we only have to work on your grammar. 8-)
[Anyway, your argument seems to be saying, "If _I_ were\nGod, I certainly wouldn't do things that way; therefore, God doesn't do\nthings that way."]
Marhaba Nabil,\n\nIf we posit two minds in Christ, the mind of the logos and the mind of the\nhuman Jesus, then we must admit two wills.  A mind is not a mind without a\nwill.  I know this has been dealt with in past Church prnouncements, but there\nis a philosophical problem here that should examined.\n\nT. V. Morris argued that the Incarnation can be seen like this:\n\n      _____________		\n     (Mind of Logos)\n     (	 _______   )\n     (	(	)  )	Here, the mind of Jesus is circumsribed by God the\n     (	( Human	)  )	Son.  God the Son has complete access to the human\n     (  ( Mind	)  )	mind but the human mind only has access to the mind\n     (	(	)  )	of God the Son when the Son allows access.  This \n     (	(_______)  )	explains why Jesus said even he did not know the \n     (_____________)	time of the kingdom.	\n\nThe human will acted in accordance with the divine will according to free\nhuman decision.  But if the human will would have decided differently than\nwhat was intended the divine will would have interceded, but this was never\nthe case.\n\nHe employs some very interesting analogies to support the one person/two mind\ntheory.  The ideas of a completely healthy version of split personality from\nthe field of psychology, and the intriguing ideas of being in a dream, seeing\nyourself acting, knowing that is you, but also being omniscient.  \n\nThe one hypostasis would be the unity of the two minds.  Agreed.  But I am\nstill waiting for Morris and others to respond to the lingering problem of two\nminds making two persons.  Christian analytic philosophers are breaking new\nground in explicating the rationality of Theism and the Incarnation. \n\n====================================          \nTed Kalivoda (tedr@athena.cs.uga.edu)\nUniversity of Georgia, Athens\nInstitute of Higher Ed.
I would like to see his reasoning behind this.  You may have gotten \n"burned" by natural disaster prophecies down there, but that\ndoes not mean that every natural disaster/judgement prophecy is\nfalse.  Take a quick look at the book of Jeremiah and it is obvious\nthat judgement prophecies can be valid.  here in the US, it seems like\nwe might have more of a problem with positive prophecies, though I\nam sure there may be a few people who are too into judgement.\n\nSometimes God does give words that are difficult to swallow.  The\nrelative positiveness of a prophecy is not necesarily grounds to\ndismiss it.  Much of the OT is not happy stuff.
I don't agree, but I can only speak for myself.  I have a good friend\nwhose lifestyle is very sinful.  Do I hate the things she does to herself\nand others?  Yes.  Do I hate her?  Absolutely not.  In fact, she tells me\nrepeatedly that I am the best friend she has in the world.  I care about\nher very much despite the fact that I hate how she lives her life.\n\nIt's very easy to fall into the progression you describe above.  I've\nfelt it with my friend more than once.  There is a very important \npart of Christianity that you've overlooked above and makes it possible\nto "love the sin but hate the sinner."  Before I look at someone\nelse's life and sin, I look to myself and am as disgusted by what I see\nin *me* as I see in others, probably more.  Self-righteousness is\ncontradictory to Christianity and is what makes the progression you\ndescribe happen.  If a Christian can truthfully quote Paul and say, "Wretched\nman that I am!" [Romans 7:24 (NASB)], that Christian will be able\nto love the sinner and hate the sin.  If we have the attitude of the Pharisee \nwho said, "I thank Thee that I am not like other men..." [Luke 18:11 (NASB)],\nwe will hate both.\n\n  -- Scott at Brandeis
What is the basis of the idea of hell being a place of eternal\nsuffering?  If it is Biblical, please reference.\n\nHere's my train of thought: If God is using the Earth to manufacture\nheavenly beings, then it is logical that there would be a certain\nyield, and a certain amount of waste.  The yield goes to Heaven, and\nthe waste is burned (destroyed) in Hell.  Why is it necessary to\npunish the waste, rather than just destroy it?\n\nPeace and joy,
I wouldn't and don't.  I thought I did a pretty good job of\nqualifying my statement, but apparently some people\nmisinterpreted my intentions.  I apologize for my part in\ncommunicating any confusion.  My intent was more to\nstir up discussion rather than judge.   It seems to\nhave worked.\n\n[rest of post noted - by the way, I did not originally post this to\nalt.atheism.  If it got there, I don't know how it did.]
:                                                               Consequently,\n: this verse indicates that she was without sin.  Also, as was observed at\n: the very top of this post, Mary had to be free from sin in order to be the\n: mother of Jesus, who was definitely without sin.\n\nIf the mother of Jesus had to be without sin in order to give\nbirth to God, then why didn't Mary's mother have to be without\nsin in order to give birth to the perfect vessel for Jesus?  For\nthat matter, why didn't Mary's grandmother have to be without sin\neither?  Seems to me that with all the original sin flowing\nthrough each person, the need for the last one (Mary) to have\nnone puts God in a box, where we say that He couldn't have\nincarnated Himself through a normal human being.\n\nMy God is an all powerful God, Who can do whatever suits His\npurpose.  This includes creating a solar system and planet earth\nwith the appearance of great age; providing a path through the\nRed Sea for the children of Israel that does not depend on the\nexistence of a ridge of high ground and a wind blowing at the\nright speed and direction; and the birth of Himself from a normal\nsinful person without being tainted by her original sin.\n\nI see far too much focus on the "objects" of religion and not\nnearly enough on the personal relationship that is available to\nall believers with the Author of our existence, without the\nnecessity of having this relationship channeled through conduits\nto God in the form of Mary, Apostles and a Pope.\n\n: Note that the idea of Mary being conceived without Original Sin, i.e. the\n: Immaculate Conception, is distinct from the idea of Mary not having sinned\n: during her lifetime, which is a separate doctrine and, I believe, also\n: held by the Catholic Church.\n\nIf Mary was born without original sin, and didn't sin during her\nlifetime, how is she any different from Jesus?  This means the\nworld has had two perfect humans:  one died to take away the sins\nof the world;  the other gave birth to Him?  I would certainly\nwant to see some scriptural support for this before I would start\npraying to anyone other than God.  Everything I have ever read\nfrom the bible teaches me that Jesus was and is the only sinless\nLamb of God, not His mother, grandmother........\n\n: Hope this is useful to you.\n\nVery useful in helping me understand some of the RC beliefs.\nThank you.

After reading this story about St. Maria Goretti (posted two weeks\nago), I am a bit confused.  While it is clear that her daily\nlife is one of probity and sanctity, I am afraid I don't quite\nunderstand the final episode of her life.  I am reading it \ncorrectly, she (and the Church apparently) felt that being raped\nwas a sin on _her_ part, one so perfidious that she would rather\ndie than commit it.  If this is the case I'm afraid that I \ndisagree rather strongly.\n\nCan anyone out there explain this one to me?\n\nYours in Christ,
Luke 10:16-18\n\nHe that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth\n me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me.\n\nAnd the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the\n devils are subject unto us through thy name.\n\nAnd he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.
Lets talk about principles. If we accept that God sets the\nstandards for what ought to be included in Scripture - then we\ncan ask:\n1. Is it authoritative?\n2. Is it prophetic?\n3. Is it authentic?\n4. Is it dynamic?\n5. Is it received, collected, read and used?\n\nOn these counts, the apocrapha falls short of the glory of God.\nTo quote Unger's Bible Dictionary on the Apocrapha:\n1. They abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and\nanachronisms.\n2. They teach doctrines which are false and foster practices\nwhich are at variance with sacred Scripture.\n3. They resort to literary types and display an artificiality of\nsubject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred Scripture.\n4. They lack the distinctive elements which give genuine\nScripture their divine character, such as prophetic power and\npoetic and religious feeling.\n\n\nBut the problem with this argument lies in the assumption that\nthe Hebrew canon included the Apocrapha in the first place, and\nit wasn't until the sixteenth century that Luther and co. threw\nthem out. The Jewish council you mentioned previously didn't\naccept them, so the reformation protestants had good historical\nprecedence for their actions. Jerome only translated the\napocrapha under protest, and it was literally 'over his dead\nbody' that it was included in the catholic canon.\n\n\nHow do you then view the words: "I warn everyone who  hears the\nwords of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to\nthem, God will add to him the plagues described in this book.\nAnd if anyone takes away from this book the prophecy, God will\ntake away from him his share in the tree of life and in the\nholy city" (Rev 22.18-9)\nSurely this sets the standard and not just man-made traditions.\n\nIt is also noteworthy to consider Jesus' attitude. He had no\nargument with the pharisees over any of the OT canon (John\n10.31-6), and explained to his followers on the road to Emmaus \nthat in the law, prophets and psalms which referred to him - the \nOT division of Scripture (Luke 24.44), as well as in Luke 11.51\ntaking Genesis to Chronicles (the jewish order - we would say\nGenesis to Malachi) as Scripture.\n\n\nI am not familiar with the book. \nSome other arguments you might like to consider are found in\nChapter 3 of Josh McDowell's Evidence That Demands A Verdict.
I find this remark to be awfully arrogant.  I would venture to \nsay that there are many people who are Christians now, who at one\npoint in their lives had no intention of ever becoming a Christian.\nI was certainly one such person.  I am quite thankful that there \nwere Christians who were willing to continue to talk to me, despite\nthe appearance that it might have been a waste of their time and \nmine.  (I even married one of them.)

I have noticed that newspapers don't even know what a fundamentalist is;\nat the least, they confuse new evangelicals and fundamentalists.

I think many\npeople use it to cover people who believe in inerrancy and a number of\nrelated concepts (e.g. denial of evolution).  While the original\nfundamentals movement was somewhat more specific, I would think most\npeople who accept inerrancy would actually support the whole original\nagenda.  (It included a list of key traditional doctrines, e.g.  the\nvirgin birth.)  The term is now being used by the press to describe\naggressive conservative religions in general, most typically those who\nare attempting to legislate religion.\n\nLegalism is yet another ill-defined term.  However there is some\nreason for its use in this context.  In fact the common theological\ndefinition is the believe that salvation is through the Law.  I hope\nno one here believes that our conservative contributors hold this\nview.  However there is a basic difference in approach over what we\nexpect to get out of the Bible.  The conservative approach expects to\nfind specific behavioral rules.  Generally the posters advocating this\napproach talk about the relevant passages from Paul's letter as God's\nLaw.  The liberal approach expects to find general principles, but it\nregards specific behavioral rules subject to change depending upon the\nculture and other things.  It's easy to see why a liberal would regard\nthe conservative approach as legalism.  It's hard to know quite what\nother term to use.  The issue in this case is not inerrancy, because\nno one is saying that Paul made a factual error.  Rather, the question\nis whether his statements are to be taken as Law.  Calling the\npositive answer legalism seems obvious enough terminology.  I haven't\nseen any good alternative.
What you call "the Trinity and the Catholic church's definition\nof it" is precisely the result of the first Christians getting\ntogether and trying to find an acceptable answer to your\nquestion "what is a Christian?". I can't see what you are\nobjecting to: someone is saying what historians of all beliefs\nwould agree on, and you are calling him a closed-minded bigot?\n\nYou really ought to say what you mean by "belief in Jesus\nChrist". It is not a wording that is sufficient to describe a\nChristian. Muslims believe in Jesus Christ although they\nbelieve he was a prophet and not the incarnated Son of God. But\nfollowers of Eastern religions might be quite happy to say that\nJesus was the incarnation of God - along with large numbers of\nother historical and mythical figures.\n\nSo perhaps you ought to rephrase your question and say\nprecisely what it is in the traditional definitions of what it\nis to be a Christian, as handed down by the Universal Church,\nyou object to but regard as unnecessary for being a Christian.
From: dhammers@pacific.? (David Hammerslag)\n\n	How do you (Mormons) reconcile the idea of eternal marriage with \n	Christ's statement that in the resurrection people will neither \n	marry nor be given in marriage (Luke, chapt. 20)?\n\nFootnotes in some bibles reference this verse to the Book of Tobit.\nTobit is in the Septuagint. Goodspeed published it in a book called \n"The Apocrypha". Most any bookstore will have this. At any rate, the Jews \nof Christ's day had this book. It is a story mostly centered around the\nson of Tobit who was named Tobias. There was a young lady, Sarah, who had \nentered the bridal chamber with seven brothers in succession. The brothers \nall died in the chamber before consumating the marriage.\n\nTobias was entitled to have Sarah for his wife (3:17) because Tobias was\nher only relative and "...she was destined for [Tobias] from the beginning"\n(6:17).\n\nTobias took her to wife and was able to consumate the marriage. The \nseven husbands would not have her as a partner in heaven. That does not \neliminate Tobias, her eighth husband. Tobit is a fun and interesting \nstory to read. It's kind of a mythical romance. It's a little shorter \nthan Esther.\n\nThe LDS also have scriptures that parallel and amplify Luke 20. Most \nnotably Doctrines and Covenants 132:15-16.\n\n	"Therefore, if a man marry him a wife in the world, and he marry \n	her not by me nor by my word, and he covenant with her so long as\n	he is in the world and she with him, their covenant and marriage\n	are not of force when they are dead, and when they are out of \n	the world; therefore, they are not bound by any law when they \n	are out of the world.\n\n	"Therefore, when they are out of the world they neither marry nor \n	are given in marriage; but are appointed angels in heaven, which\n	angels are ministering servants, to minister for those who are \n	worthy of a far more, and an exceeding, and an eternal weight of \n	glory."
Heres a nice story to help explain the virtues of purity, innocence\nand modesty, and their importance.\n\n\n\n    The Most Beautiful Virtues\n\n    This story is an excerpt taken from The  Basket  of  Flowers   by\n    Johann Christoph von Schmid\n\n\n    In a certain little market town, over a hundred years ago,	there\n    lived  an  upright	and  intelligent man named Jacob Rede. He was\n    married to a most virtuous young woman and they lived happily  in\n    a  humble  home which was in the midst of a large, beautiful val-\n    ley. After living many, happy years together, Jacob's wife	died,\n    leaving  him alone with only one friend...his daughter Mary. Even\n    as a child Mary was uncommonly pretty; but as she grew in  years,\n    her piety, her innocence, her modesty and her unfeigned kindne ss\n    towards all she came in contact with, gave to her beauty  a  rare\n    and  peculiar  charm. Her face was lighted up with a look of such\n    indescribable goodness, that  it  seemed  almost  as  though  one\n    looked upon an angel.\n\n    Mary's greatest delight was the beautiful garden and her  favour-\n    ite  flowers  were the violet, the lily and the rose. Jacob loved\n    to point to them as emblems of the virtues most becoming  to  her\n    gender.  When	she  once, early in March brought the first violet to\n\n    Let the modest violet, my dear Mary, be to you an image of humil-\n    ity  and  of the benevolence that does good in secret. It clothes\n    itself in the tender colours of modesty; it prefers to  bloom  in\n    retired  grots; it fills the air with its fragrance while remain-\n    ing hidden beneath the leaves.  May you also, my  dear  Mary,  be\n    like  the  retiring violet, avoiding vain display, not seeking to\n    attract the public	eye,  but  preferring  ever  to  do  good  in\n    quietude and peace.\n\n    One morning when the roses and lilies were in full bloom and  the\n    garden appeared in its richest array, Jacob said to his daughter,\n    as he pointed out a beautiful lily,  which	was  beaming  in  the\n    morning sun:\n\n    Let the lily my dear child, be to you the emblem\n     of purity. Look how beautiful, how pure and fair it is! The whi-\n    test  linen is as nothing compared with the purity of its petals:\n    they are like the snow. Happy the maiden whose heart is  as  pure\n    and as free from stain. But the purest of all colours is also the\n    hardest\n\n				   -5-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    to preserve pure. Easily is the petal of the lily  soiled;	touch\n    it	but carelessly or roughly and a stain is left behind.  In the\n    same way, a word or a thought may stain the purity of  innocence!\n\n     Let the rose my dear Mary, be to you an emblem of modesty.  More\n    beautiful  than the colour of the rose is the blush that rises to\n    the cheek of a modest girl. It is a sign that she is  still  pure\n    of	heart  and  innocent in thought. Happy is the maiden whom the\n    suggestion of a thought that is indelicate, will cause to  blush,\n    as	she  is thus put on her guard against the approach of danger.\n    The cheeks which readily blush will remain for a long  time  with\n    their  roseate  hue, while those which fail to blush at the least\n    indelicacy of thought will soon  become  pale  and	wan,  and  go\n    before their time to the grave."\n\n\n\n\n    Among the many fruit trees that adorned the garden there was  one\n    that  was  prized above all the others. It was an apple tree, not\n    much larger than a rose bush, and stood by itself in  the  middle\n    of	the garden. Mary's father had planted it the day that she was\n    born and every year it bore a number of beautiful apples. Once it\n    blossomed  earlier	than  usual  and with unusual luxuriance. The\n    tree was one mass of blossom. Mary was so delighted with it  that\n    she went every morning as soon as she was dressed to look at\n     it. Once, when it was in full bloom, she called  to  her  father\n\n    Look father, how beautiful! Was there ever such a lovely mingling\n    of	red  and  white?  The whole tree looks like one huge bunch of\n    flowers!\n\n    The next morning she hastened into the garden to feast  her  eyes\n    once  more	upon the tree. But what was her grief to see that the\n    frost had nipped it and destroyed all its flowers. They were  all\n    become  brown  and	yellow	and  when  the	sun came forth in its\n    strength they withered and fell to the ground. Mary  wept  bitter\n    tears at the sight. Then said the father:\n\n    Thus, does sinful pleasure destroy the  bloom  of  youth.  Oh  my\n    child,  never  cease to remember how dreadful it is to be seduced\n    from the path of right! Behold in the example of the  apple  tree\n    an	image of what would happen if you were to wander from the way\n    - if the hopes your conduct  hitherto  has	raised	in  my	heart\n    should  vanish,  not  merely for a day or year, but for life. Ah,\n    then how much more bitter would be the tears which I  would  shed\n    over your lapse from virtue than those which now course down your\n    cheeks! Life would have no joys for me: with tears in my eyes  I\n    should\n\n				   -6-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    go down sorrowfully to my grave.\n\n    As he spoke, the tears stood in his eyes; Mary was deeply  moved,\n    and  the words he uttered made so profound an impression upon her\n    mind that she never forgot them.\n\n    Under the eyes of a father so  loving  and	wise,  and  amid  the\n    flowers  of  her  garden, Mary grew daily in stature and intelli-\n    gence - blooming as a rose, pure as a  lily  and  retiring	as  a\n    violet, and as full of promise as a tree laden with blossom.\n\n    Happy was the old man at all times to behold how plenteously  the\n    fruits  of	his  garden  rewarded his diligent toil; but with how\n    much more happiness and content did he mark the  gracious  effect\n    produced  upon  the heart and mind of his beloved daughter by his\n    pious teaching and example.\n\n    Jacob plucked several roses and lilies, tied them together	in  a\n    bunch and gave them to Mary with the words:\n\n    The lily and the rose, sister flowers as they are, belong the one\n    to	the  other;  both incomparable in their beauty, they are ren-\n    dered still more lovely by being together. In  the	same  way  my\n    dear  child  are innocence and modesty twin sisters of virtue and\n    cannot be separated\n\n\n\n\n    The greatest and most powerful guardian of purity is the  thought\n    of the presence of God

You are right, Michael.\n\nIn John 3:5, Jesus says, "Amen, amen, I say to you, no one can enter the\nkingdom of God without being born of water and Spirit."  That's really what\nHe said, and He meant it.  That verse is the definition of baptism.  I don't\nhave the law book in front of me, but there is a canon law that urges\nparents to baptize their children within one week of birth for the very\nreason that you state.
Dear fellow Christians,  \n\n	I had a dinner last night with a bible study group which      \nI am in. We had a discussion about the difference between Christianity\nand Islam. And I was shocked to hear that our bible study teacher\nsaid that Mohammad was indeed a prophet but of Satan. I said, "What??"\nI did not believe that, because I have some moslem friends who are\nso kind and  nice, even sometimes I feel I wish I could be like them\n(in my point of view, they don't sin as much as I do). How come if they\nwere under Satan, they could have such personalities. \n\nTo tell you the truth, I don't know much about Islam.\nBut I know that they believe in God, they believe in the day of\njudgement.\n	\n	Now I'm  asking you what your opinions about Islam and \nits teaching. \n\nIMPORTANT : I do not want to discuss whether they are saved or not.\n	    I do not want to discuss about politic related to Islam.\n\nP.S: I post this in bit.listserv.christia, soc.religion.christian,\n     and bit.listserv.catholic.\n\n\nIn Christ, our Lord,                           Smile.........\n					       Jesus loves you.......\n	Tabut Torsina\n	TORSINA@ENUXHB.EAS.ASU.EDU	   \n\n[Let me start by saying that this is not the right newsgroup for a\ndiscussion of Islam, since there's a group for that.  But I suspect\nthe point your teacher was making was not specifically about Islam.\nIndeed it's going to be impossible to see what he was getting at\nwithin your groundrules, since the question of whether non-Christians\nare saved is at the heart of it.\n\nThe classic Christian view, which I think most people believed until\nthe last century or so, was that Christianity (and of course Judaism)\nwas the only religion founded by God, and that all other religions\nworshipped false gods, and came from Satan.  This is more or less a\ncorollary of another traditional view that no one but Christians (and\npossibly Jews) will be saved.  This need not mean that there's no\ntruth in any other religion, nor that all of their members are\nintentionally Satanic.  After all, in order to be an effective snare,\nSatanic alternatives would have to be attractive.  Thus they might\ncontain all kinds of truth, wisdom and spiritual insights.  They would\nbe missing only one thing -- knowledge of salvation through Christ.\nIf this is the background of your teacher's remarks -- and I suspect\nit is -- that means that a discussion of Islam is not necessarily\nrelevant.  The point is not that there's anything intrinsically wrong\nwith it.  It may teach a fine code of behavior, and its practitioners\nmay all be wonderful people.  But if salvation requires being a\nfollower of Christ, it could still be a Satanic invention.\n\nThis is a reasonable deduction from the classic Protestant position.\nChristianity says that salvation isn't a matter of being kind and\nnice.  Those are good things, and we should encourage them.  But no\none is able to do them enough to be saved.  Salvation requires Christ.\n(Please forgive me for doing this in Protestant terms.  There's a\nCatholic equivalent to this that has similar implications, but in\ndifferent terms.)  A religion may be quite attractive in all visible\nways.  But if it doesn't have Christ, it's like a diet that consists\nof food that looks wonderful, tastes great, but is missing some\nessential food element so that you end up dying.\n\nLet me be clear that I am not specifically advocating this position.\nWhat I'm trying to do is (as usual) to clarify issues.  Indeed it is\nnow relatively uncommon for Christians to believe that all other\nreligions are Satanic.  Most Christians regard such beliefs as an\nunfortunate vestige of the past.  This is part of a general move\nwithin Christianity in the last century or so to a non-judgemental\nGod.  Christians now find it hard to believe that God would allow\nanybody other than a really rotten person to end up in hell, and they\nfind it hard to envision that real malignant spiritual forces are at\nwork in the world doing things like creating superficially attractive\nalternatives to Christianity.  Whether there is actually a sound basis\nfor the shift is a decision that people need to make for themselves.
Curiously enough, this subject has occupied a good bit of my prayer life\nrecently.  God's experience of time is so completely different from our own,\nsince He is both within and without it.  Using words like "foreknowledge"\nand "predestination" are semantically incorrect when it comes to describing\nGod's perception of our action, because, for God, the beginning, living, and\nending of our lives are all the same.  Sort of.  For God, there is no "before"\nwhen He did not know, so he could not have "foreknowledge" of our lives or\na time when he could have "predestined" our actions.  In fact, since our\nunderstanding of things is so tied to our linear experience of time, I\nwould say that it is impossible for us to understand completely how our\nfree will interacts with God's control of the universe.
Just a quick comment.  As a baptist clergyperson, I find the idea\nof such a "baptism" (if the news report is in fact accurate, and\nthey seldom are regarding religion) offensive.  The pastor here seems\nto have a most unbaptist view of baptism- one that seems to demand the\nceremony even when comprehension and choice are absent.\n\nWe do baptize converts, but no one who has been deceived into hearing\nthe word is likely to be a convert.  If in fact the grace of God might\nwork in such a situation, there is no harm done in waiting a day or\ntwo.\n\nBaptist believe in regenerate membership.  Did this church include these\nhalf-baked (at best) converts into their church fellowship? Or do they\nsomehow feel there is some validity in dunking them and turning them loose?\n\nThis kind of "evangelism" is certainly not baptist, and probably not\nvery christian, either.
So do other parts of the Bible when taken literally - i.e. the Psalms\nsaying the Earth does not move, or the implication the Earth is flat\nwith four corners, etc.  The Bible was written to teach salvation, not\nhistory or science.\n\n\nWhat ones?  Paryers for the dead or the intercession of saints? (Which\nare taught in 2 Maccabees, Sirach, and Tobit)\n\n\nBy your own subjective judgement.  This falling short is your judgement,\nand you are not infallible - rather the Church of Jesus Christ is (see 1\nTimothy 3.15).\n\n\nMore subjective feelings.   This is not a proof of anything more than\none persons feelings.\n\n\nAs I have written time and again, the Hebrew canon was fixed in Jamnia,\nPalestine, in 90 AD.  60 years after the foundation of the one, holy,\ncatholic, and apostolic Church.  Furthermore, the opinons of Jerome do\nnot count.  He was neither the Church, or the Pope, or an ecumenical\ncouncil, or a council in general, or an insturment of the Magisterium of\nthe Church.  He was a private individual, learned admittedly, but\nsubject to erro of opinion.  And in exlcuding the deuterocanon, he\nerred, as Pope Damsus, and the Council of Carthage, and the tradition of\nthe Fathers, clearly shows, as I pointed out in my previous post.\n\n\nI suggest you take heed of the last part of the statement, if you want\nto take it in the sense you are taking it, that taking away from the\nbook will cause you to lose heaven.\n\n\nThe order of the Canon is unimportant, it is the content that matters. \nNone of Jesus' statments exlcude the deuterocanon, which were\ninterspersed throughout the canon.  And remeber, there are some\ncompletely undisputed books, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Ecclesiatses, Song\nof Songs, Job, etc. that are not quoted in the New Testament, which is\nnot taken as prejudicial to their being inspired.
[my stuff about dealing with defferences deleted]\n\n\ni am sorry; i did not mean to.  i think i understand how your\nexperiences were much worse than the small bit of ridicule i have had\nto put up with.  i guess i didn't really understand before; now i do.\n\n\nwow, pretty conservative church.  (please excuse me if this seems like\na ridiculous understatement to you.)\n\n\n(on a side note, that "under God" wasn't in there until recently -- i\nbelieve my father, who is in his sixties, remembers saying the pledge\nof allegiance without that in there.  i don't know the history behind\nthat though.)\n\nemotional blackmail -- ouch.  thank goodness (i'll be neutral in my\nthanks here :) ) i was raised in a completely tolerant household, so\nthat i could make my own decisions!\n\n\nso atheism doesn't have to be taught, but christianity does.  i guess\ni can see that, although i can see a child believing in some sort of\ngod without anything other than his/ her own imagination as a basis.\n(sorry, i guess this is sort of minor)\n\n[my query about parallel between lack of choice for homosexuals and\nlack of choice for him as an atheist deleted]\n\nhmm, i wonder why i am a christian then?  this isn't a flame, this is\na real wonder.  does anyone else have opinions to offer on why you\nbelieve in something that hasn't necessarily been "proven" to you?\n\n\nsounds like you are an atheist by nature, then.  or is it possible\nthat at least part of it is due to the apparently repressive nature of\nthe christianity of your childhood?  if this is getting too personal\nperhaps you should ignore it, or we can take it to email.\n\n\nthis may have been a general remark; you do not sound broken to me,\nbut indeed stronger.\n\n\nyes, i agree with that.  i've seen some of the damage repressive\nreligion can do, and as a result i intend to raise my own children as\nmuch as i can to look around before accepting one religious stand\n(atheism is included in this) and to _question everything_ -- this is\nvery important.\n\n\ni can see that.
It troubles me that there have been so many posts recently trying to support\nthe doctrine of Original Sin.  This is primarily a Catholic doctrine, with no\nother purpose than to defend the idea of infant baptism.  Even among, its\nsupporters, however, people will stop short of saying that unbaptised infants\nwill go to hell.\n\nIt's very easy for just about anyone to come up with a partial list of\nscripture to support any sort of wrong doctrine.  However, if we have the\nheart to persevere in our beliefs to make sure that they are biblically\nbased, then we can come to an understanding of the truth.  Let's now take a\nmore complete look at scripture.\n\nColossians 2:11-12 "In him you were also circumcised, in the putting off of\nthe sinful nature, not with a circumcision done by Christ, having been\nburied with him in baptism and raised with him through your faith in the\npower of God, who raised him from the dead."\n\nIn baptism, we are raised to a new life in Christ (Romans 6:4) through a\npersonal faith in the power of God.  Our parent's faith cannot do this.  Do\ninfants have faith?  Let's look at what the Bible has to say about it.\n\nRomans 10:16-17 "But not all the Israelites accepted the good news.  For\nIsaiah says, 'Lord, who has believed our message?'  Consequently, faith\ncomes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word\nof Christ."\n\nSo then we receive God's gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the\ngospel.  Faith is a possible response to hearing God's word preached.  Kids\nare not yet spiritually, intellectually, or emotionally mature enough to\nrespond to God's word.  Hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot\nbe raised in baptism to a new life.\n\nEzekiel 18:20 "The soul who sins will die.  The son will not share the\nguilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son.  The\nrighteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the\nwickedness of the wicked will be charged against him."\n\nIf you read all of Ezekiel 18, you will see that God doesn't hold us guilty\nfor anyone else's sins.  So we can have no original guilt from Adam.\n\nEzekiel 18:31-32 "Rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committted,\nand get a new heart and a new spirit.  Why will you die, O house of Israel?\nFor I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign Lord.\nRepent and live!"\n\nThe way to please God is to repent and get a new heart and spirit.  Kids\ncannot do this.  Acts 2:38-39 says that when we repent and are baptized, we\nwill then receive a new spirit, the Holy Spirit.  Then we shall live.\n\nNow then that we have a little more background as to why original sin is\nnot Biblical, let's look at some of the scriptures used to support it.\n\nRomans 5:12 "Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and\ndeath through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all\nsinned--"\n\nSin and death entered the world when the first man sinned.  Death came to\neach man because each man sinned.  Note that it's good to read through all\nof Romans 5:12-21.  Some of the verses are easier to misunderstand than\nothers, but if we read them in context we will see that they are all\nsaying basically the same thing.  Let's look at one such.\n\nRomans 5:19 "For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many\nwere made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many\nwill be made righteous."\n\nThrough the disobedience of each individual, each was made a sinner.  In\nthe same way, through the obedience of Jesus, each will be made righteous.\nWe must remember when reading through this passage that death came to each\nman only because each man sinned, not because of guilt from Adam.\nOtherwise the Bible would contradict itself.  I encourage you to read\nthrough this whole passage on your own, looking at it from this point of\nview to see if it doesn't all fit together.\n\nPsalm 51:5 "Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother\nconceived me."\n\nThis whole Psalm is a wonderful example of how we should humble ourselves\nbefore God in repentance for sinning.  David himself was a man after God's\nown heart and wrote the Psalm after committing adultry with Bathsheba and\nmurdering her husband.  All that David is saying here is that he can't\nremember a time when he wasn't sinful.  He is humbling himself before God\nby confessing his sinfulness.  His saying that he was sinful at birth is\na hyperbole.  The Bible, being inspired by God, isn't limited to a literal\ninterpetation, but also uses figures of speech as did Jesus (John 16:25).\nFor another example of hyperbole, see Luke 14:26.\n\nNow then, even though people see that baptism requires faith and that\noriginal sin is not Biblical, they will still argue that infant baptism is\nnecessary because children sin by being selfish - not sharing toys with\nother children, by being mean - hitting others and fighting, etc.\n\nCertainly we have observed children doing wrong things, but my gut feeling\nis always that they don't know any better.  Let's look to see if the Bible\nagrees with my gut feelings.\n\nIsaiah 7:14-15 "Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign:  The\nvirgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him\nImmanuel.  He will eat curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the\nwrong and choose the right."\n\nNow just about any church leader will tell you that this is a prophecy\nabout Jesus.  If they don't, then point them to Matthew 1:23 and find a new\nleader.  Jesus certainly couldn't have had less knowledge than normal human\nbabies.  Yet this passage says that he had to mature to a certain extent\nbefore he would know the difference between right and wrong.  We see that\nhe did grow and become wiser in Luke 2:40 and 2:52.  The implication is\nthat Jesus did wrong things as a child before he knew to choose right over\nwrong.  Since we know that Jesus was perfect -- without sin, we have rather\nconclusive proof that babies cannot sin because they don't know to choose\nthe right instead of the wrong.\n\nJesus himself was baptized, albeit with John's baptism, not as an infant,\nbut as a thirty-year-old man (Luke 3:21-23) and started his ministry as\nsoon as he was baptized (Luke 3:23).  Immediately afterwards, he was\ntempted by the devil (Luke 4:1-13; Matthew 4:1-11; Mark 1:12-13).\n\nThank you for your attention.\n\nModerator - this should finish up the subject for a while.  Perhaps you\nwould like to make a FAQ out of this response so that you can repost it\nfrom time to time when the topic comes up.

Until recently I always understood the term "kingdom theology" to mean the \ntheology of the kingdom of God, but now I have discovered that there is a \nnew and more specialized meaning. I gather that it is also called "Dominion \ntheology", and that it has to do with a belief that Christians must create a \ntheocratic form of government on earth before Christ will come again.\n\nI have not come across anyone who believes or advocates this, but I am told \nthat it is a very widespread belief in the USA.\n\nCan anyone give me any more information about it?\n\nHere are some of my questions:\n\n1. Is it the teaching of any particular denomination? If so, which?\n2. Where and when does it start?\n3. Are there any particular publications that propagate it?\n4. Are there any organizations that propagate it?
I guess I would react rather strongly to this line of thinking carried \nout!  When you think "your army" is stronger than "mine", you would \n"righteously" take my children and baptize them, doing what you know is \nreally "best" for them.\n   You cannot possibly put this kind of action, nor the crusades into the \ncontext of the teachings of Jesus/God.  I think he advocated a different \napproach that was *by design* made to be appealing, to those called by him, \nnot chosen by a church practice.\n   It seems to me you have the cause and effect switched, the change comes \nand then you get baptized.
Yes, I suppose that's true.  Of course, notice I qualified with NEARLY\nevery language :-).  And there are missionaries out there who can\nspeak every imaginable language AND dialect.  But then, the fact that\nnot all languages have a WRITTEN gospel lends no credence to the \nconcept of "pentecost" type xenoglossolalia since most tongues occur not\nin these places of un-written language, but rather in churches full\nof people who do have a written language and a Bible in that language.
Though this will be addressed in the series of articles I'm posting now under\n"ARESNOKOITIA", I can't wait.  This just really blew my socks off.  Read I Tim\n1: 3-11.  Verses 3-8 speaks against those who have perverted the teachings of\nthe Mosaic Law.  In vv.9-10, we have, *IN ORDER*, the 5th thru the 9th\ncommandments and in the midst of this listing is "homosexuals."  The decalogue,\nabove everything else, is seen as God's absolute.  If you don't believe in\nabsolutes, then you have nothing do do with Jehovah of the OT, which Paul\nreveals to be the Messiah of the NT. "Lord Christ Jesus" transliterates to read\n"Jehovah's Anointed Savior."  \n  In I Cor5, we see the same emphasis of moral separation from the pagan\ngentiles as we do in Lev 18-20.  In I Cor 6:9-10, only one notation (drunkards)\nis not found in Lev 18-20.  Paul was not naive in his use of the LXX.  He knew\nfull well how he was using the Law of God that was given in the OT, for\napplication in the NT.  As I've said, the Law was fulfilled, not done away\nwith.\n\n\nThis understanding is thoroughly rebutted in DeYoungs article that is being\nposted.  Please refer to it.\n\n\nWe can do better than "probably" which is not an adequate defense against the\nstatement that Paul's culture didn't have the same understanding of\nhomosexuality as ours.  \nAgain read the article because it uses facts.\n\n\nI think I do, because I have worked in the homosexual community by means of\nworking with AIDs patients.  The pastoral is merely the practical application\nof the theological truth however.  Those who are working thru the issue of\nhomosexuality need to have our love and understanding just as with a friend who\nis contiplating cheating on his wife or a friend who lives with his girlfriend,\nyet you continue to witness to him.  But, once the choice is made, and there is\nno remorse, then I feel that Paul's "pastoral" care, as presented in the\nCorinthian Church, come to bear significance.  THe one in active rebellion\nshould be placed outside of the church if a believer, and if a non-believer,\nthen one wipes his sandels and leaves it in Gods hand.  If there was a member\nin your youth group who was constantly pawing at the little girls, you wouldn't\nhesitate to deal with the matter quickly and decisivly.  That, in part, betrays\nthe present "political correctness" of the issue.  Pederasty is not accepted at\nthe present, but some how we are to accept homosexuality because the latter is\npolitically correct, while the former is not -at least not yet.  THis is how\nthe morals decay.  \n\nI guess this would follow the liberal application in the political realm of\neconomics.  The liberals want to tax the rich in the federal, yet in their own\nstates, when they try to get businesses to settle there, they give tax\nincentives to these same richies.  It comes down to a moral code of\nrelativeness, or to use the cultural thing, politically correct -at the moment.\n--Rex
[ in response to a question about why Jesus' parents would be sanctified \nbeyond normal humanity]\n\nI would think that simply being pregnant with the incarnation of the \nAlmighty God would be enough to make Mary blessed among all women, whether\nor not she had special spiritual attributes.  I find that the more special\nMary needs to be, the less human Jesus gets.
Gerry Palo wrote that there is nothing in Christianity that excludes\nthe theory of a succession of lives.\n\nI wrote that the Apostle Paul, in Romans 9, speaks of God as\nchoosing Jacob over Esau, and adds that this is not as a result of\nanything that either child had done, since they had not been born\nyet.\n\nClearly, Paul does not believe that they had had previous lives, nor\ndoes he suppose that his readers will believe it. For if they had\nhad previous lives, it would not make sense to say, "Neither of them\nhas done anything good or bad as yet, since they are not yet born."\n\nDaniel Cossack writes to ask whether it is fair for God to hate\nEasau when Esau has done nothing bad?\n\nI reply that in Hebrew it is standard usage to speak of hating when\nwhat is meant is simply putting in second place. As an example,\nconsider the saying in Matthew 6:24\n\n + No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one\n + and love the other, or....\n\nNow, it is obviously false that a man with two masters must hate one\nof them. But it is obviously true that he must put one of them in\nsecond place. A dog that always comes when either Billy or Bobby\ncalls will have a problem if they stand in different places and call\nsimultaneously. It cannot give first priority to both. One must take\nsecond place. In our original example, second place means that\nJacob, not Esau, is chosen to bear the covenant blessing and\nobligation, and to be the ancestor of Christ.\n\n     *****     *****     *****     *****     *****\n\nEugene Bigelow mentions Matthew 11:14 which says of John the\nBaptist:\n\n + And if ye will receive it, this is ELijah, who was to come.\n\nI take this to mean that John was an Elijah-like figure, dressing\nand living like Elijah, preaching like Elijah, and fulfilling the\nprediction that Elijah would prepare the way for the Messiah.  I do\nnot think that he was Elijah in a literal sense, and, appareently,\nneither did he (John 1:21).
speaking of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin:\n\n\nYes.  For examples of this in the writings of the early fathers, consider:\n\n    You alone and your Mother\n        are more beautiful than any others;\n    For there is no blemish in you,\n        nor any stains upon your Mother.\n    Who of my children\n        can compare in beauty to these?\n                -- St. Ephrem the Syrian, Nisibene Hymns, 27:8, around\n                   A.D. 370\n\n    Lift me up not from Sara but from Mary, a Virgin not only undefiled \n    but a Virgin whom grace has made inviolate, free of every stain of sin.\n                -- St. Ambrose, "Commentary on Psalm 118", 22:30, ca. A.D. 388\n\nThere are many others.\n\n\nNo.  We have, for instance:\n\n    Was there ever anyone of any breeding who dared to speak the name of\n    Holy Mary, and being questioned, did not immediately add, "the Virgin"?\n    ... And to Holy Mary, Virgin is invariably added, for that Holy Woman\n    remains undefiled.\n                -- St. Epiphanus of Salamis, "Panacea against all heresies",\n                   between A.D. 374-377.\n\n    We surely cannot deny that you were right in correcting the doctrine\n    about children of Mary ... For the Lord Jesus would not have chosen\n    to be born of a virgin if He had judged that she would be so incontinent\n    as to taint the birthplace of the Body of the Lord, home of the Eternal\n    King, with the seed of human intercourse.  Anyone who proposes this is\n    merely proposing ... that Christ could not be born of a virgin.\n                -- Pope St. Siricius, Letter to Anysius, Bishop of \n                   Thessalonica, A.D. 392\n\nNote that St. Augustine's conversion to Christianity was in A.D. 387.  I\ndon't know offhand when his election as bishop of Hippo was, but I'm quite\nsure it was after 392.  The belief in Mary's perpetual virginity originated\nlong before Augustine's time.  We hold that it originated with the \nApostles.\n\nStrictly speaking, however, Mary's perpetual virginity is independent\nof her Immaculate Conception.  Mary could have been Immaculately \nConceived and not remained a virgin; she could have remained a virgin\nand not been Immaculately Conceived.\n\n\nNo.  It has been held in the Church since ancient times that original\nsin was transmitted at conception, when a person's life begins.\nBiology had nothing to do with it.  Prayerfully reflecting on the\ntruth of Mary's sinlessness, and the means by which God could have\nachieved this, the Church arrived at the truth of the Immaculate\nConception.  Thus, the Immaculate Conception is not a new doctrine,\nbut the logical result of our understanding of two old ones.\n\nThe celebration of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception itself was\ngiven by Pope Sixtus IV (1471-84) and the Feast was made a precept\nfeast of the Church by Pope Clement XI (1700-21).\n\n\nNo.  First of all, Lourdes is private revelation, and doctrine is not\nbased on private revelation.  The most that private revelation can do\nis enhance and deepen our understanding of existing public revelation,\nwhich ended with the death of St. John the Apostle.\n\nSecond, the "case for the doctrine" was irreformably sealed in 1854 \nwith the ex cathedra promulgation of the Bull "Ineffabilis Deus" by\nPope Pius IX.  This meant that the doctrine was formally recognized as\na dogma; a dogma, by definition, cannot change and is required to be\nbelieved by the faithful.\n\nThe apparition at Lourdes happened in 1858, four years later.  The most\nthat might be claimed is that Lourdes gave the infallible proclamation\nof 1854 a sort of heavenly stamp of approval, but the Church has never\nclaimed that, nor shall she.\n\nIn Christ's Peace,\n\nBrad Kaiser\n(bradk@isdgsm.eurpd.csg.mot.com)
I wrote that I thought that 2 Peter 1:20 meant, "no prophecy of\nScripture (or, as one reader suggests, no written prophecy) is\nmerely the private opinion of the writer."\n\nTony Zamora replies (Sat 8 May 1993) that this in turn implies that\nit is not subject to the private interpretation of the reader\neither. I am not sure that I understand this.\n     In one sense, no statement by another is subject to my private\ninterpretation. If reliable historians tell me that the Athenians\nlost the Pelopennesian War, I cannot simply interpret this away\nbecause I wanted the Athenians to win. Facts are facts and do not go\naway because I want them to be otherwise.\n     In another sense, every statement is subject to private\ninterpretation, in that I have to depend on my brains and\nexpereience to decide what it means, and whether it is sufficiently\nwell attested to merit my assent. Even if the statement occurs in an\ninspired writing, I still have to decide, using my own best\njudgement, whether it is in fact inspired. This is not arrogance --\nit is just an inescapable fact.
And as someone mentioned earlier, from the apocryphal Book of Enoch,\nsatan was apparently kicked out for three times asserting his own will,\n"I will".  Hmmm...pro-choice looks kinda creepy here.
way.qub.ac.uk writes (single angle brackets):\n\nng \n\nThere is no question of similarity in Jesus indication about John.\nThe passage in Matthew is very direct.  Where Luke (1:17) reports\nthe angel Gabriel prophesying that John will go before Christ "in the \npower and spirit of Elias", In Matthew 11: 14, Jesus himself says of John,\n   \n   "And if you care to accept it, he himself is Elijah, who\n    was to come".\n\nIt is interesting that Jesus prepended the words, "If you care to accept\nit", as if to say that the implications of this truth, namely of rein-\ncarnation, I will not force on you, but for those who can accept it, here it\nis.  A Jewish poster to other newsgroups on Jewish esotericism and other\ntopics has outlined the esoteric, cabbalistic Jewish teaching of of\nreincarnation and Karma, a teaching that is little known among Jews\ntoday, but which is apparently widespread enough in Israel that Hannah\nHurnard ("Hinds Feet on High Places") was told about it by a Rabbi\nshe was trying to convert back in the 1940s as a missionary in Palestine.\nThus there may well have been a small number of Jews who knew about this,\nwhereas the large number of people did not.  The statement of Jesus about \nJohn, the greatest human personality in the New Testament, is guarded\nbut nevertheless quite direct.  Again, the subject of reincarnation, one\nway or another, is not a subject of the New Testament, nor is the fate in general\nof the human being between death and the last judgement.  But there are \noccasional indications that point to it.\n\nAs for the "popular belief" that Elijah would come again, it was more than \na popular belief, as Jesus confirms it in more than one place, and he never \ncorrected those who were expecting Elijah --  for example, those who thought \nthat Jesus himself be he.
Fred Gilham asks (May 11) whether it is true that Kurt Goedel wrote\na version of the ontological argument for the existence of God.\n\nYes, he did. He did not publish it, but it will be published by the\nOxford University Press in German and with English translation in\nVolume 3, due to appear this fall, of his Collected Works.\n\nMeanwhile, you can find a summary, or perhaps the whole thing, in an\narticle by Jordan Howard Sobel called "Goedel's ontological proof"\nin the book ON BEING AND SAYING, edited by Judith Jarvis Thompson\n(sp?), published by the MIT Press in 1987.\n\nProfessor C Anthony Anderson of the Philosophy Department of the\nUniversity of Minnesota has written an article, "Some Emendations of\nGoedel's Ontological Proof," which appeared in the magazine FAITH\nAND PHILOSOPHY, v. 7 (1990): 291-303. It discusses some objections\nthat various critics have raised against Goedel's proof, and offers\na revised version of the proof that is not vulnerable to these\nobjections.
This is a point that seems to have been overlooked by many. The ending of a \n1600 year old schism seems to be in sight.\n\nThe theologians said that the differences between them were fundamentally \nones or terminology, and that the Christological faith of both groups was \nthe same.\n\nSome parishes have concelebrated the Eucharist, and here in Southern Africa \nwe are running a joint theological training course for Coptic and Byzantine \nOrthodox. \n\nThere are still several things to be sorted out, however. As far as the \nCopts are concerned, there were three ecumenical councils, whily the \nByzantine Orthodox acknowledge seven.
I didn't say to visit some "nice" homosexuals.  I said "visit some congregations\nof Christians..spirit-filled believers.."\n\n\nPraise the Lord that we are all members of the same body.  Let us agree to\ndisagree.
Michael> The kind of interpretation I see as "incredibly perverse" is\nMichael> that applied to the story of Sodom as if it were a blanket\nMichael> equation of homosexual behavior and rape.  Since Christians\nMichael> citing the Bible in such a context should be presumed to have\nMichael> at least READ the story, it amounts to slander -- a charge\nMichael> that homosexuality == rape -- to use that against us.\n\nand\n\nMichael>  It is just\nMichael> as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it's a\nMichael> secondary argument from the 'phobic contingent) to equate\nMichael> homosexuality with such behavior as to equate it with the\nMichael> rape of God's messengers.\n\nLet's review the Sodom and Gomorrah story briefly.  It states\nclearly that the visitors were angels.  But "all the men from every\npart of the city of Sodom--both young and old--surrounded the\nhouse.  They called to Lot, `Where are the *men* who came to \nyou tonight?  Bring them out to us so that we can have sex \nwith them.' " \n\nFor the rest of the story the angels are referred to by the men\nof Sodom and by Lot as *men*.  Furthermore we know from Gen 18:20,21\nthat the Lord had already found Sodom guilty of grievous sin--before\nthe angels visited the city.  It is clear that the grievous sin\nof Sodom and Gomorrah involved homosexual sex.  It appears that\nthe men had become so inflamed in their lust that they had\ngroup orgies in the public square--which simply indicates \nthe extremity of their depravity.  It does not show that lesser \ndegrees of homosexuality are not sinful, as Michael would have us\nbelieve.\n\nUltimately our understanding of God's will for sexuality comes from\nthe creation story--not solely on the story of Sodom and Gomorrah.  He\ncreated us male and female, and instituted marriage as a relationship\nbetween one male and one female, "Therefore a man will leave his\nfather and mother, and be united with his wife, and they will become\none flesh."  This marriage relationship is the only sexual\nrelationship which God blesses and sanctions. He regulates and\nprotects the marriage of man and woman, and even uses it as a picture\nof the relationship between himself and his church.  But we find not\none word of blessing or regulation for a sexual relationship between \ntwo men, or between two women.\n\nEverything else that we find in the Bible about sexuality derives from\nor expresses God's will in instituting and blessing marriage.  Thus\nthe Levitical code, which was given only to the Jews, forbade incest,\nhomosexuality, bestiality; the Ten Commandments forbade adultery and\nthe coveting of our neighbor's wife; other commandments forbade rape.\nThe men of Sodom and Gomorrah were regarded as sexually immoral and\nperverse (Jude 7) because they abandoned and/or polluted the marriage\nrelationship.  Thus also Paul regarded homosexuality as `unnatural',\nRomans 1:26,27--not because this was simply Paul's opinion,\nbut because it was contrary to God's purpose in creating us\nmale and female.\n  \nMichael> Christians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here\nMichael> and in every corner of USENET and the world, and ALL they\nMichael> ever do is spout these same old verses (which they obviously\nMichael> have never thought about, maybe never even read), in TOTAL\nMichael> ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with the vilest\nMichael> charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can\nMichael> manage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they\nMichael> suppose) great emotional force to cause readers to dismiss\nMichael> our witness without even taking the trouble to find out what\nMichael> it is.\n\nReally, have you no better response to `slander' than more\nslander?
The basic definition that I use is:\n	The belief that Jesus was God incarnate.\n	The belief that Jesus was crucified and raised from the dead\n	for our salvation.\n	The acceptance of Jesus as personal Lord and Savior.\n\nThis would include most Christian denominations, but exclude the Unitarians.

Absolutely not.  I went through a "journey" of lukewarm Christianity,\nagnosticism, atheism, agnosticism, and now (although I know my faith\nis less than what it should be) Christianity again.  I think it's a path\nmany of us take.
Maybe you should dig a little further Charles.  Hislop's scholarship was\naccepted by the Bristish Oriental Institute which, at the time, was the premere\nInstitute for Oriental studies.  As I've stated over and over,  I've checked\nout about 25% of his references (most are now out of print or in private\nlibraries) and the likes of Wilkerson and Layard hold their own merit.  THey\ntoo came to the same conclusions and if you will trouble yourself, you will\nfind that their knowledge of the mysteries have yet to be surpassed.  Both were\nhighly honored by the British Oriental Museum.  Wilkerson is known as one of\nthe leading archeologist in the history of Egyptiology and Layard is still\nbeing refered two after 200 yrs of archeology in the Mesopotamian regions.  He\nwas recently refered to in a TIME article on Babylonian archeology.  \n\nPhony scholarship is when you review their references and find that they have\nmisquoted or misrepresented the conclusions.  Hislop did not.  His conclusions\ndo not tickle the ears, that much is self evident.  But to assert that his\nconclusions are "spurious" is without merit.  He gave references to all his\nconclusions and as I have stated, for the last 25 years I have used his\nconclusions in debates at RC seminaries and brotherhoods, not to mention the\nindividual priests and bishops that I have talked to one on one.  No counter to\nHislops scholarship was made.  The only rebuttals were against his conclusions\nbecause they do totally undermined the claims of the RCC. He was showing that\nthe intitution of the RCC was based on the mysteries (which others have shown\neven to this day in various articles and topics).  THe tongues movement in\nCorinth was a direct result of the mysteries entering into the church.  If it\nwas so in Corinth, why could they not have an influence in Rome, the city of\nseven hills?\n\nAlso, you do not have to listen to his conclusions, you can draw your own\nconclusions by looking at the customs, artifacts, the cerimonial dress, the\ndocrine of purgatory, etc from the vantage of the mysteries.  You don't even\nhave to be a believer to see the parallels.  Just one example.  THe mitre. \nWhere did it come from?  Why is it shaped the way it is?  What are the two\ntails that hang down the back represent?  Was this an ancient  head dress from\nan earlier culture and why was it in Rome at the time of the beginnings of the\nchurch of the State of Rome?  Does it have pagan history behind it, and if so,\nwhy did the RCC chose regardless?\n\nAny lay person of middle eastern religion can answer these questions.  Even the\nscriptures themselves refer to it.  All Hislop did was collect the information\nfrom all the various sources and put them in one binding.  There is no lack of\nscholorship in that.\n\nPlease tell me why you discredit this man by your accusation, yet present no\nevidence supporting it.

> A Christian friend of mine once reasoned that if we were never\n > created, we could not exists. Therefore we were created, and\n > therefore there exists a Creator.\n\nI hesitate to comment on the validity of this, because I do not know\nwhat your friend meant by it. If he meant that whatever exists must\nhave been created, then he is open to the obvious retort that God\nexists, and so God must have been created.\n\nPerhaps your friend meant that we exist now but that there was a\ntime when we did not exist, and therefore something other than\nourselves must have brought us into existence. This seems plausible,\nbut an atheist might reply, "So my parents engendered me. So what?"\nHere your friend would have to explain why an infinite regress of\ncauses is not a satisfactory explanation. He would have some support\nfrom philosophers who are not ordinarily considered religious (Ayn\nRand, and some others who are in the tradition of Aristotle). Having\nargued for a First Cause, he would have to bridge the gap between\nsaid entity and the God of Abraham. If he merely asserts that the\nthings we observe are ultimately dependent on things radically\nunlike them, few physicists would disagree.
You should remember that in Adam's transgression, all men and women\nsinned, as Paul wrote.  All of humanity cooperativley reblled against\nGod in Adma's sin, thus, all are subject to it, and the sin is\ntransmitted from generation to generation.\n\nAndy Byler]
Dave - you might like to read a book by Florence Bulle "God\nWants You Rich & Other Enticing Doctrines", which discusses\nOOBEs in one of her chapters.\n\nIn the Bible we have examples of men caught up in the Spirit (eg\nEzekiel, Paul). I believe that also this experience is\ncounterfeited by Satan - so that for example yoga and other\neastern medatitive techniques can be used to induce the soul to\nleave the body and float off. Someone tried to sell me a book in\nLos Angeles airport entitled "Easy Journeys to Other Planets"\nwhich uses such techniques.\n\nThe occultic trance of a medium sometimes involves such body\ndeparture - the book "The Challanging Counterfeit", about a\nformer medium who gets saved, tells how the author, on his last\ntrance, was attacked by evil spirits who tried to kill him\nwhile returning to his body at the end of the seance\nbecause of his interest in Christianity and how he was supernaturally\nprotected by the Lord.\n\nThere may be some similarities in mind-altering drugs and the\nphenomena of 'tripping'.\n\nAs regards the connection between body and soul, there is an\ninteresting verse in Ecclesiastes. In a passage talking about\nold age, the preacher writes "Then man goes to his eternal home\nand mourners go about the streets. Remember Him--before the\nsilver cord is severed." (12.5-6) My understanding of this\nsilver cord is that it is something that attaches body and soul\nin a manner somewhat similar to an umbilical cord or an\nastronaut's air-line to his spaceship.\nWhen a person goes out of body this silver cord still attaches\nthe soul whereever it goes - and is vulnerable to being broken:\nastral projection can be dangerous! Bulle, I think, reports a\ncase of a yogi off on an OOBE who was found dead in his\napartment, with no apparent external cause.
As St. Augustine said, "I did not invent original sin, which the\nCatholic faith holds from ancient time; but you, who deny it, without a\ndoubt are a follower of a new heresy."  (De nuptiis, lib. 11.c.12)]
Interesting idea.  \nRegular televeision seems to do this sort of thing too with politically correct  \nshows.
"Hate the sin but love the sinner"...I've heard that quite a bit recently, \noften in the context of discussions about Christianity and homosexuality...\nbut the context really isn't that important. My question is whether that\nstatement is consistent with Christianity. I would think not.\n\nHate begets more hate, never love. Consider some sin. I'll leave it unnamed\nsince I don't want this to digress into an argument as to whether or not \nsomething is a sin. Now lets apply our "hate the sin..." philosophy and see\nwhat happens. If we truly hate the sin, then the more we see it, the \nstronger our hatred of it will become. Eventually this hate becomes so \nstrong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to hate\nthe sinner. In addition, our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and \ndo things which are taken personally by the sinner (who often does not even \nbelieve what they are doing is a sin). After enough of this, the sinner begins\nto hate us (they certainly don't love us for our constant criticism of their\nbehavior). Hate builds up and drives people away from God...this certainly\ncannot be a good way to build love.\n\nIn the summary of the law, Christ commands us to love God and to love our \nneighbors. He doesn't say anything about hate. In fact, if anything, he \ncommands us to save our criticisms for ourselves. So, how are Christians\nsupposed to deal with the sin of others? I suppose that there is only one\nway to deal with sin (either in others or ourselves)...through prayer. We\nneed to ask God to help us with our own sin, and to help those we love \nwith theirs. Only love can conquer sin...hatred has no place. The best way to\nlove someone is to pray for them. \n\n- Scott

[Someone quoted the following.  I've removed the name because it's not\nclear which name goes with which level of quote.  --clh]\n\n\n\nOn the basis of these examples I would say that Joe Moore was only wrong\nin claiming Augustine as a prime mover of the sin=sex view.  These quotes\nclearly equate sexuality with defilement and incontinance, even within\nthe marriage relationship (else they would not apply to Mary after her marriage\nto Joseph).\n\nSo Joe's assignment of the reasoning behind the concept of the perpetual\nvirginity of Mary does seem to be supported by these quotes.
This thread si starting to get really silly. Such nonsense do not\nbelong in s.r.c and it really hurts me to read some of the posts on\nthis issue.\n\nWe chose to believe whetever we want, but we are not allowed to define\nour own Christianity. we see in parts. If you see something that I do\nnot see, or vice versa, it does not give me the right to play jokes on\nyour belief!\n\nThere is no wonder that your "miracle" does not work. You designet it\nyourself, and even if you were able to collect a group of people like\nthe one you describe, I see no reason why your "miracle" should really\nhappen. God is the one who does miracles, not humans!\n\nAfter all we are all on the same way, or at least, we are all headed\nfor the same goal, following different paths. Remember that we are\ngoing to spend eternity together. If I can not stand your view here on\nearth, how can I possibly stand spending eternity together with you?\n\nTongues is a question of belief. Not wether you believe in Jesus, but\nif you believe that He is able to give you this gift. Just as any\nother of the gifts mentioned in the Bible. But there is no evidence in\nthe Bible that people who do not accept these gifts are in any way\nbetter than others.\n\n\nMaybe some of the people who have received spiritual gifts are more\ninterested in glorifying themselves than glorifying God, I don't know.\nBut if this is the case, it still does not suggest that the gifts are\nfaked.\n\nIn the Bible you will find that Jesus did not always do miracles. He\nsaid that "I do nothing, except what my father tells me." Perhaps it\nwoulkd be for the best of all if we where all able to live by that\nexample!\n\nIn Him,\nBjorn

Surprise, surprise. I sure didn't lose any sleep over it, and I live there.\n\n\nSuppose someone said that he was sure that he would return from death,\nin glory and power, flying in the clouds with the host of heaven,soon, within\nthe lifetimes of those then standing with him - and 2000 years went by without\nany such event. [He also asserted, so they say, himself to be God.]\n\n2 questions:\n\n	1) Is that one of those "false prophecies" you were talking about?\n	2) Does that make the speaker a false prophet?\n\n\nUhh,  Has it occurred to you that there is no way to know any of these\nthings, for certain, "without the tiniest shadow of a doubt"? That people\nwho thought they did have also been deluded?\n\nThose of us who believe in actually being able to _CHECK_ our opinions\nhave an out - we can check against some external reality. Those who\nassert that beliefs entertained without evidence, or even despite evidence\nhave a special virtue (ie. "faith") are out of luck -- and this is the\nresult.\n\n\nYou want to demonstrate Christian honesty? Great.\nStart with the prophecy above - what can we conclude about the speaker?

[material deleted] \n[deletions]\n\n\nI don't necessarily object to the secrecy but I do question it, since I see no \nBiblical reason why any aspect of Christian worship should involve secrecy.  \nBut I am interested in your claim that early Christian practices "parallel" \nMormon temple ceremonies.  Could you give an example?  Also, why do they only \nparallel Mormon ceremonies?  Why don't Mormon ceremonies restore the original \nChristian practices?  Wasn't that the whole point of Joseph Smith's stated \nmission?
I define faith as "belief, in the abscense(sp?) of evidence". I also\ninclude in "evidence" past experiences. Because I have no past experience\nin a god actually having an effect on my life and because I have never\nseen evidence for any god beyond what can be explained without the\nneccessity of a god or which is more convincing than the many fictional\nworks I have read (And other reasons), I do not believe in any god(s).\nFrom what I have seen, some people reconcile this lack of evidence by\nusing faith.\nIt is faith in that sense (the only way I _currently_ understand the word\n"faith") that I find intellectually dishonest.\n\n\nPascal's wager goes something like this:\nPremise #1: Either there is or there isn't a God.\nPremise #2: If God exists, He wants us to believe and will damn us for not\nbelieving.\nPremise #3: If God does not exist, then belief in God doesn't matter\nbecause death is death, anyway.\nConclusion: Belief in God is superior to non-belief because\nnon-belief damns us to eternal punishment if we are wrong, while belief in\nGod only wastes a little time in life if we are wrong.\n\nSound pretty straightforward and is logically sound. The problem is,\nPremise #1 presupposes 1:1 odds between belief and non-belief. This is\nflat out wrong, because of the sheer number of religions out there and the\nfact that, for the most part, the religions are mutually exclusive. I have\nheard theists referred to as "99% atheists" because they believe in their\ngod (or gods) to be the _one_ god (or set of gods). The consequence of\nthis is "what if I pick the wrong god?" Suddenly, the odds don't look so\ngood because picking the wrong god or wrong doctrines of a god still\nleaves you with the possibility of being wrong and being damned to another\ngod's version of hell.\n\n\nI don't see how "disillusionment" enters into it. You see, I presented my\nmother's treatment of me to show the cause of my questioning my atheism, a\nquestioning which continues to this day. I had already been an atheist for\nfive years before having any contact with my mother's version of\nChristianity. If anything, I had become somewhat disillusioned with\natheism (uh, oh, I thought, What if there *is* a God?). Yes, in a way, I\nhave also become disillusioned by many religions, simply because I had\nthought at one time that they had all the answers, if I only found the\nright one.\nI'm still looking, but each time I look in a different place, I become a\nlittle stronger in my attitude (belief, if you will, no faith, though,\nit's based on the evidence of past experience) that I'll never find a\nreligion which has all the answers.\nSorta like looking for Easter eggs. The more time it takes you to find the\nnext one, the more convinced you become that you may already have found\nall the eggs you're going to find.\nSomeone else mentioned that critisism isn't going to make me think any\nmore highly of Christians. I have a contrary position: Constructive\ncritisism will likely improve my attitude towards Christians. Abusive\ncritisism will turn me off.\nNo accusations to you, Mr. Sapienza. I merely slipped that into this post\nbecause I forgot to reply to that one.\n\n\nMuppets and Garlic Toast forever.\n\nMax (Bob) Muir
Q. Should teenagers have the freedom to choose what church they go to?\n\nMy friends teenage kids do not like to go to church.\nIf left up to them they would sleep, but that's not an option.\nThey complain that they have no friends that go there, yet don't\nattempt to make friends. They mention not respecting their Sunday\nschool teacher, and usually find a way to miss Sunday school but\ndo make it to the church service, (after their parents are thoroughly\ndisgusted) I might add. A never ending battle? It can just ruin your\nwhole day if you let it.
I'd like to field this one, if I may.  Although I am a believer in and follower\nof Christ, my experiences with religion haven't been all that positive.  In\nfact, there was one point in my life when, for about three days, I simply\n_couldn't_ believe in the existence of God.  Anyway, when I look back upon the\ntroubles I've had, they seem to fall into two categories -- impulses to\nunbelief that resulted from logical contradictions, and impulses to unbelief\nthat resulted from frustration with God.\n\nThe first category doesn't occur to me much anymore, as I have worked through\nmost of the arguments for the non-existence of God.  But way back when, these\nwould cause me some problems, and I would have to struggle with my faith to\ncontinue to believe.  I can see where others less stubborn than I (and I do\nmean stubborn.  Stubborness has often been the only thing standing between\nme an atheism from time to time) would fail.\n\nThe second category arises out of some long-term personal difficulties and\nthe struggle to live my life as God would have me live it WITHOUT living my \nlife as others would tell me how God would have me live it.  A good example of\nthis is my struggle with the more radical Christians I meet.  I am not, nor\nhave I ever been, "on fire for Chirst," and I don't think I ever want to be.\nNevertheless, I am not "lukewarm" about my faith, so I don't really\nfit in with the mainstream either.  Quite naturally, I feel a lot of anxiety\nabout my dislocation within Christian society, and it can lead to a lot of\ninternal tension, when I want to do what I _know_ is right,\nbut when another part of me believes that what I want to do is wrong because\nall the other Christians think so to.  Quite naturally, this tension has a\ndestructive effect on my relationship with God, and during all of this internal\nstrife, there's atheism sitting there like the promised land -- no rules, no\nresponsibilities, no need to live up to anyone's expectations but my own.\nComplete freedom.  Of course, it's all an illusion, but nevertheless, it's a\nvery appealing illusion, especially when the so-called "people of God" are\nbehaving like total twits.  I can easily understand why someone would go\nthat route, and would be hostile to ever coming back.\n\nIMHO, many of the former-Christians-turned-atheists-who-are-now-actively-\nhostile-to-Christianity are so because their experience with Christ and God\nwasn't a very peaceful one, but one of mind-control and "shut-up-and-do-what-\nyou're-told-because-we-know-what's-best-for-you-because-it's-God's-will-and-\nyou're-to-young-to-know-what-God's-will-is-yet" courtesy of some of Christ's\nmore overzealous followers.  \n\nA final reason why people become atheists is because Christians do not have a\nvery good reputation right now.  One of the things that attracted people to\nChristianity in the ancient days was the love that Christians obviously had\nfor one another and the world around them.  Unlike the rest of the world,\nChristian communities actively cared for their poor, and the Christian rich\ndid not trod on the backs of their poorer brothers, but bent down to help\nthem.  Christians were known for living exemplary lives, even if they were\nthought to be traitors to the state because they wouldn't sacrifice to the\nemporer.  Nowadays, courtesy of the media and some Christian leaders who lost\nChrist on their way to power, people see Christians as sexually-repressed\nhippocritical busibodies who want to remake society into a facist version of \ntheir own moral view.\n\nThere are a lot more reasons why people become atheists, but I don't have time\nto go into them right now.

The Catholic doctrine of predestination does not exclude free will in\nany way.  Since God knows everything, He therefore knows everything that\nis going to happen to us.  We have free will, and are able to change\nwhat happens to us.  However, since God knows everything, He knows all\nthe choices we will make "in advance" (God is not subject to time).  Too\noften arguments pit predestination against free will.  We believe in\nboth.
On these counts, the apocrapha falls short of the glory of God.\n   To quote Unger's Bible Dictionary on the Apocrapha:\n   1. They abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and\n   anachronisms.\n   2. They teach doctrines which are false and foster practices\n   which are at variance with sacred Scripture.\n   3. They resort to literary types and display an artificiality of\n   subject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred Scripture.\n   4. They lack the distinctive elements which give genuine\n   Scripture their divine character, such as prophetic power and\n   poetic and religious feeling.\n\nFirst, to point out the obvious: While #4 would clearly be a highly\nsubjective issue, one would be hard pressed to point to another book\nof the OT (or for that matter the NT) that doesn't, on some issues, in\nsome way, fail one or more of the first three of these tests.\n\nSecond, one factor the Deuterocanonicals share is the lateness of\ntheir composition.  I don't recall the exact dating of all of the\nbooks, but most --if not all-- were written after the latest of the\ncanonical books (i.e. Daniel).\n\nFurthermore, while the Deuterocanonical may or may not have been\noriginally written in Greek, they are clearly deeply _Hellenistic_ in\nnature.  Both of these features probably figured heavily in the\nrejection of these books from the various canons.\n\nThese may not be strict and uniformly applicable criteria by which to\njudge the canonicity of these books, but, as these discussions have\nshown, I think the one thing we can see is that there _are_ no purely\nobjective standards for determining canonicity.
There is a contradiction related to the moral issue of polygamy in the\nMormon writings.  In the book in the book of Mormon called the book of \nJacob, Joseph Smith wrote that it was an abomination to God for \nDavid and Solomon to have many wives.  Later, when Joseph Smith wrote\nthe Doctrines and Covenants (possibly when polygamy was becoming an\nissue in his personal life) he wrote that it was not an abomination for\nDavid to have many wives.  How do Mormons answer this contradiction?
Maybe before Babel,everyone including angels spoke the same language,so at\nBabel, God punished us by giving us languages different from the original one.\nSo if that's the case,then angels now would be speaking in the tongue  mankind\nspoke before Babel.
-= PASTORTALK =-\n\n  A weekly dialogue with a local pastor on the news of the day\n\n                      by Carl (Gene) Wilkes \n\n                       Startext: MC344578 \n                     CompuServe: 70423,600\n                       Internet: 70423.600@compuserve.com\n\n                   -= THIS WEEK'S THOUGHTS =-\n\nLast week the Supreme Court refused without comment to hear an\nappeal by Rensselaer, IN, school officials desiring the\ndistribution of Bibles in their public schools (REL65, 5/21). A\nlower court had banned the local Gideons, an international Bible-\ndistribution group, from passing out Bibles to fifth-graders. The\nACLU's Barry Lynn was quoted as saying that the court's action\nprotected the "religious neutrality of our public schools." He also\nsaid that schools must serve students of "all faiths and none."\nSchools were not to be a "bazaar where rival religious groups\ncompete for converts," according to Lynn.\n\nSeveral Gideons, men who are responsible for putting Bibles in\nhospitals and hotels, are members of our church. They tell of\nsimilar stories where they are only allowed to distribute Bibles on\nsidewalks around the schools, but cannot go inside the schools.\nThey tell of mild harassment by parents who do not want their\nchildren receiving a Bible from a stranger. They are willing to\ncontinue their work at a distance, but find the school's position\nsomewhat disheartening.\n\nI understand rationally and logically the court's position. And, I\ncan see the sense of fairness for all groups. But, on the other\nhand, when does "neutrality" become "nihilism?" When does plurality\nturn into no position at all?\n\nI see a couple of ironies here. One is that we can pass out condoms\nbut not Bibles in our schools. Think on that one for a moment.\n\nThe other is that while we are seeking "religious neutrality" in\nour schools, countries like Russia--who, by the way, practiced\n"religious neutrality" for the past seventy years--are making the \nBible part of their public school curriculum. When I was in St.\nPetersburg in March, the church we worked with had trained over 100\npublic school teachers to teach the Bible, and the government had\nrequested hundreds more! I recently heard a medical doctor who is\npresident of the Gideon chapter in Moscow tell how they are eagerly\ninvited to the University of Moscow to distribute Bibles to the\nstudents and are given class time to explain its contents. I\nremember seeing a photograph of this doctor holding a Bible and\nspeaking to the university students standing under a statue of\nLenin. Now, that's ironic!\n\nI admit two things: 1) We are a pluralistic society, and all faiths\nhave equal footing. This is what our country was founded on. 2) To\nallow every group on school grounds could create a bazaar-like\natmosphere. Each city must work to be inclusive of all religions\nand provide a hearing for them. 3)--I know I said two--The vitality\nof religious faith is not dependent upon whether or not the public\narena acknowledges it as valid.\n\nHowever--and you knew this was coming--I believe, disallowing the\ndistribution of the Bible by law-abiding, caring adults in our\nschools only signals once again our culture's movement away from a\nsingular base from which we as individuals and as a nation can make\nmoral and ethical decisions.\n\nWhat do you think? \n\n                         -= MAIL BOX =-\n(Let me know if you do not want me to print your letter or your\nname.)\n\nGood column [re: TIME coverstory about teen sexuality]; I agree\nwith moral education from home, but some homes don't have the kinds\nof morals I want taught.  One family I worked with smoked dope as\ntheir primary family activity.  Another acted like incest was OK.\nFamilies, no matter where they are, are often a lot sicker than\nwe'd like to believe.\n\nFrom: John Hightower, MC 407602\n\nJohn,\n\nI agree that the "home" ain't what it used to be, and some homes\nare NOT the place to learn value-based sexuality. I still believe\nthat this is where the church can come into play. I know, those\nfamilies you speak of may not come to a church to seek information,\nbut the help does not need to be in a church building...I believe\nthat the youth from the families you mentioned will probably\ndisregard the value-free information at school, too.
It might be interesting for folk to know that the Church of Scotland\n(also a Presbyterian church)  managed to "agree to disagree" over\nwomen's ordination for 25 years.  The reasoning was that congregations\nare free to call whoever they wish, and that Ministers and Sessions\nchoose elders.  If a congregation did not wish to have a woman, they\nwere not obliged to, and if a Session did not wish to, they could not\nbe forced to.  (Note that the who issue of freedom to call on the part\nof the Congregation is VERY important here - this year is the 150th\nAnnivarsary of the Disruption, where the church split on that very\nissue, they didn't get back together for almost 80 years).\n\nA couple of years ago on the 25 anniversary of the allowing of womens\nordination the position was changed - so that, in theory, all\nministers and elders must recognise that women can be ordained.  In\ntheory, a minister who refused to ordain a woman to his Session, or\nrefused to work with a woman minister in Presbytery, could be\ndisciplined.  In practice this has not happened, and I believe it is\nunlikely to happen.  My personal view is that the new legislation was\na mistake, and that the permissive (but not prescriptive) legislation\nworked very well.  \n\nWe are going to start going round the homosexual debate at next years\nassembly.  At this years, a motion was put to ban the blessing of\nsame-sex couples (after an Edinburgh minister did so).  Our Panel on\nDoctrine is currently looking at marriage, and will report next year -\nthe matter will be considered and debated then.\n\nHope this is interesting
Though you can certaily assert all this, I don't see why it necessarily\nhas to be the case. Why can't hate just stay as it is, and not beget more?\nWho says we have to get disgusted and start hating the sinner. I admit\nthis happens, but I donlt think you can say it is always necessaily\nso.\n\nWhy can we not hate with a perfect hatred?\n\n\nCertainly we should love even our enemies. Amos 5:15 says to hate the evil\nand love the good. This can't contradict Christ's teaching. I think we tie\nup both hate and love with an emotional attitude, when it really should be\nconsidered more objectively. Surely I don't fly into a rage at every sin\nI see, but why can I not "hate" it?
Note:  I am breaking this reply into 2 parts due to length.\n\n\nI agree that there are no verses that have gone unchallenged by gay rights \nactivists.  But if there are zero verses that "'clearly' address the issues," \ndoesn't that mean that there are also no verses that clearly *support* your \ncase?  Are you sure you want to say that there are zero verses that clearly \naddress the issues?\n\n\nThe story in Genesis 19 tells of the citizens of Sodom demanding an opportunity \nto "know" the two men who were Lot's guests; the fact that the Sodomites became \nangry when Lot offered them his daughters could be seen as indicating that they \nwere interested only in homosexual intercourse.  Yes, what they wanted was \nrape, homosexual rape, and everybody agrees that that is wrong.  Some \nChristians believe that the homosexual aspect of their desire was just as \nsinful as the rape aspect of their desire.  The passage does not say what it \nwas that so offended God, whether it was the homosexuality, or the intended \nrape, or both, but I believe that it is only fair to consider all the possible \nalternatives in the light of related Scriptures.  I do not believe that those \nwho believe God was offended by both the homosexuality and the rape are trying \nto say that homosexuality is itself a form of rape.\n\nYou seems to take the view that the *only* sin described in Gen. 19 is in the \nfact that the Sodomites wanted to commit rape, and that it is unfair to \n"stigmatize" their homosexuality by associating it with the sin of rape.  I can \nsee how you might reach such a conclusion if you started from the conclusion \nthat there is nothing wrong with homosexuality, but then again we're not \nsupposed to start from our conclusions because that's circular reasoning.  If \nGod is in fact opposed to homosexual intercourse in general, then the more \nprobably interpretation is that He was at least as offended by the Sodomites' \nblatant homosexuality as He was by their intent to commit rape.  Later on I \nwill document why I believe the Old Testament portrays God as One who despises \n*any* homosexual intercourse, even if both partners are consenting adults.\n\n\nThe moderator found my proposal to be circular in that he regarded the church \nas the proper  authority for determining what *kinds* of marriages would be \nlegitimate, and thus the church's refusal to recognize "perverted" marriages \nwas circular reasoning.  My questions, however, had nothing to do with the \nchurch ordaining new kinds of marriages, and so his argument was something of a \nstraw man.  In terms of my original question, the precise \ndefinition/translation of "porneia" isn't really important, unless you are \ntrying to argue that the Bible doesn't really condemn extramarital sex.  I'm \nnot sure the moderator was trying to do that.\n\nIn any case, I think both you and the moderator have missed the point here.  \nWhen Jesus was asked about divorce, He replied, "Have you not read, that He who \ncreated them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, 'For this \ncause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife; and \nthe two shall become one flesh'?  Consequently they are no longer two, but one \nflesh.  What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate." (Mt. \n19:4-6).  I read here that the sexual union of a man (male) and his wife \n(female) is a divinely-ordained union.  In other words, the institution of \nheterosexual marriage is something ordained and established by God--not by men, \nand not by the church, but by God.  Men are not supposed to dissolve this \nunion, in Jesus' words, because it is not something created by men.\n\nThis is not circular reasoning, this is just reading God's word.  I read in the \nBible that God ordained the union of male and female.  I do not read of any \nsimilar divinely-ordained union of two males or two females.  Granted, there \nhave been uninspired men who have ordained "alternative" unions (isn't Caligula \nreported to have "married" his horse?), but the only union that Jesus refers to \nas "what God has joined together" is the heterosexual union of a man and his \nwife.\n\n(Pardon me for mentioning Caligula.  I know that's probably inflammatory, and I \nshould save it for the discussion on bestiality, in part 2 of this post.  \nPlease hold off on passing judgement on me until you have read that section of \nmy reply.)\n\nAnyway, my original question was not whether we should translate "porneia" in a \nway that condemns only a select few kinds of extramarital sex, my question was: \ngiven that heterosexual marriage is the only union described by the Bible as \ndivinely-ordained, and given a Biblical prohibition against sex outside of \nmarriage, is homosexual intercourse sinful?  Of course, I see now that first we \nneed to ask whether the Bible really condemns sex outside of marriage.  You \nseem to be trying to argue that only certain kinds of extramarital sex (and \nother sins) are really wrong:\n\n\nAlternatively, it may be that the definition of such terms as "porneia" and all \nthe rest was, in Paul's day, what we would call a FAQ; i.e. the Law, as the \n"tutor" appointed by God to lead us to Christ, had just spent some sixteen \ncenturies drumming into the heads of God's people the idea that things like \nhomosexual intercourse were abominations that deserved punishment by death.  \nPerhaps Paul didn't go into detail on what "porneia" &c were because after 1600 \nyears he considered the question to have been dealt with already.  Perhaps the \nreason God's apostles and prophets did not devote a great deal of time defining \na distinct, New Testament sexuality was because He did not intend any \nsignificant changes in the sexuality He had already established by the Law.  \nI'll discuss the Law and homosexuality in greater detail below, but I just \nwanted to point out that the New Testament's failure to develop a detailed new \nstandard of sexuality is not necessarily evidence that God does not care about \nsexual conduct--especially after 1600 years of putting people to death for \npracticing homosexuality!\n\n\nAnd how do you define an "obsessively driven" mode of sexual behavior?  How do \nyou determine the difference between obsessive sexual behavior and normal sex \ndrives?  Is the desire to have "sinful" sex an obsessively driven mode of \nbehavior?  I think you see that this is circular reasoning:  Why is it defined \nas sinful?  Because it is obsessive.  What makes it obsessive?  The fact that \nthe person is driven to seek it even though it's sinful.  Or is it obsessive \nbecause it is a desire for that which society condemns?  Once again, that's \ncircular:  Why is it defined as obsessive?  Because the person wants it even \nthough society condemns it.  Why does society condemn it?  Because it is \nobsessive.\n\nYou seem to be trying to limit the Bible's condemnation of "porneia" to only \n"perverted" sex acts, but I don't think you can really define "perverted" \nwithout falling into exactly the same circularity you accuse me of.  What, \nthen, is Paul condemning when he declares that "Fornicators...shall not enter \nthe kindgom of heaven"?\n\n\nI think you misunderstood me:  I was not trying to make an argument on some \ntechnical definition of "porneia", I was raising the issues of the sinfulness \nof extramarital sex and the lack of any Scriptural evidence of a homosexual \ncounterpart to the divinely-ordained union of heterosexual couples.\n\n\nPlease remember what you just said here for when we discuss bestiality, in part \n2.\n\n\nI am glad you asked.  Would you agree that if God condemns homosexual \nintercourse even among those who are not under the Law of Moses, then this \nwould show that God's condemnation of homosexual acts goes beyond the ritual \nlaw?  If I can show you from Scripture that God punished the homosexual \nbehavior of people who were *not* under the Law of Moses, would you agree that \nGod's definition of homosexual intercourse as an abomination is not limited to \njust the ritual law and those who are under the Law?\n\nI've been having a private Email discussion with a 7th Day Adventist on the \nsubject of the Sabbath, and my main point against a Christian sabbath-keeping \nrequirement has been that nowhere in Scripture does God command Gentiles to \nrest on the sabbath, nor does He ever condemn Gentiles for failing to rest on \nthe Sabbath.  This illustrates the difference between universal requirements \nsuch as "Thou shalt not kill", and requirements that are merely part of the \n(temporary, Jews-only) Law of Moses, such as the Sabbath.\n\nThe point you are trying to make is that you think the classification of \nhomosexual intercourse as "an abomination" is *just* a part of the temporary, \nJews-only Law of Moses.  I on the other hand believe that it was labelled by \nGod as an abomination for Gentiles as well as Jews, and that He punished those \nguilty of this behavior by death or exile.  Here's why:\n\nBack in Genesis 15, God promises to give Abraham all the land that was then in \nthe possession of "the Amorite"--kinda hard on the Amorite, don't you think?  \nBut in verse 16 we have a clue that this might not be as unjust as it sounds:  \nit seems God is going to postpone this takeover for quite a while, because "the \niniquity of the Amorite is not yet complete".\n\nRemember, this is all long before there was a ritual law.  What then was the \niniquity the Amorite was committing that, when complete, would justify his \nbeing cast out of his own land and/or killed?  Go back and look at Lev. 18 \nagain.  Verses 1-23 list a variety of sins, including child sacrifice, incest, \nhomosexuality, and bestiality.  Beginning in verse 24, God starts saying, "Do \nnot defile yourselves by any of these things; for _by_all_these_ _things_ the \nnations which I am casting out before you _have_ _become_defiled_.  For the \nland has become defiled, therefore I have visited its punishment upon it, so \nthe land has spewed out its inhabitants... For whoever does any of these \nabominations, those persons who do so shall be cut off from among their \npeople."\n\nNotice that God says the Gentile nations (who are *not* under the ritual Law of \nMoses) are about to be punished because they have "defiled" themselves and \ntheir land by committing "abominations" that include incest, bestiality, and \nhomosexuality.  Flip ahead two chapters to Lev. 20, and you will find these \nsame "abominations" listed, and this time God decrees the death penalty on \nanyone involved in any of these things, including, specifically, a man "lying \nwith another man as one lies with a woman" (Lv. 20:13).  Their \n"bloodguiltiness" was upon them, meaning that in God's eyes, they deserved to \ndie for having done such things.  According to Lev. 18:26-29, even "the alien \n[non-Jew] who sojourns among you" was to refrain from these practices, on \npenalty of being "cut off [by God?] from among their people."\n\nUnder the circumstances, I believe it would be very difficult to support the \nclaim that in the Old Testament God objected only to the intended rape, and not \nthe homosexuality, in Sodom.  Since God took the trouble to specifically list \nsex between two consenting men as one of the reasons for wiping out the \nCanaanite nations, (not homosexual rape, mind you, but plain, voluntary gay \nsex), I'd say God was not neutral on the subject of homosexual behavior, even \nby those who had nothing to do with the Mosaic Covenant.\n\n\nAccording to II Tim. 3:16, all Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable \nfor teaching, reproof, correction, and training in righteousness; thus, I \nbelieve that even though we Gentile Christians are not under the Law, we can \nlearn from studying it.  If a certain action is defined as a sin because it is \na violation of the Law, then it is a sin only for those who are under the Law \n(for example, in the case of Sabbath-keeping).  Where God reveals that certain \nactions are abominations even for those who are not under the Law, then I \nconclude that God's objection to the practice is not based on whether or not a \nperson is under the Law, but on the sinfulness of the act itself.  In the case \nof homosexuality, homosexual intercourse is defined by God as a defiling \nabomination for Gentiles as well as Jews, i.e. for those who are not under the \nLaw as well as for those who are.  Thus, I am not at all trying to say that \nGentile Christians have any obligation to keep any part of the Law, I am simply \nsaying that God referred to homosexuality as a sin even for those who are not \nobligated to keep the Law.  If this is so, then I do not think we can appeal to \nour exemption from the Law as valid grounds for legitimizing a practice God has \ndeclared a bloodguilty abomination that defiles both Jew and Gentile.\n\n(continued in Part 2)

This is no less logical than the assumption that if something is\n_not_ in the Bible, then it _must not_ be done.  But I don't really\nthink that's what he's saying anyway.  See below.\n\n\n   What about the letter to Philemon?  In it Paul at least hints that a\ncertain slave be released.  Also, slavery in those times was not the\nsame as the type of slavery we had in the U.S.  I think a better\ncomparison would be to indentured servitude.  I don't really want to get\ninto a discussion on slavery.  Anyway, although it does demonstrate your\npoint, I don't think it is relevent, because the original poster did not\nsay that absence of specific condemenation proves something is not\nimmoral.\n\n   Back to the original poster's assertion.  He is not in fact making\nthe logical error of which you accuse him.  He stated the fact that the\nBible does not say that babies cannot be baptized.  Also, we know that\nthe Bible says that _everyone_ must be baptized to enter Heaven.\n_Everyone_ includes infants, unless there is other Scripture to the\ncontrary, i.e. an exception.  Since there is no exception listed in the\nBible, we must assume (to be on the safe side) that the Bible means what\nit says, that _everyone_ must be baptized to enter Heaven.  And so we\nbaptize infants.\n\n   To summarize, you accused the original poster of saying if something\nis not forbidden by the Bible, then that proves it is OK; i.e. if\nsomething cannot be disproven, it is true.  He rather seemed to be\nasserting that since the Bible does not forbid, _you cannot prove_,\nusing the Bible, that it is _not_ OK.  There is a difference between\nproving whether or not something can be proven or disproven (there are\ntheories on provability in the field of Logic, by the way) and actually\nproving or disproving it.  The other logical error we must avoid falling\ninto is the converse: that if something cannot be proven, then it is\nfalse.  This seems to be the error of many _sola scriptura_ believers.\n\n   I think the only thing that can be proven here is that one cannot use\nScripture alone to prove something either way about infant Baptism,\nalthough the evidence seems to me to favor it.

continuing part #4 (I think); used by permission,\n\nTHE SOURCE AND NT MEANING\nOF ARSENOKOITAI, WITH IMPLICATIONS\nFOR CHRISTIAN ETHICS AND MINISTRY\n\n                                      James B. DeYoung\n\nW. Petersen\n\n     More recently Wright's understanding has itself been questioned from a\ndifferent direction.  In a brief 1986 study William Petersen found linguistic\nconfusion in using the English word "homosexuals" as the meaning of\narsenokoitai.[22]   He faulted Wright and English Bible translaions for\nrendering it by "homosexuals" in I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10.\n\n     In a sense Petersen has coalesced Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs into a\nsingle assertion that reiterates, in effect, the position of Bailey.  He finds\n"homosexuals" unacceptable as a translation because it is anachronistic.  "A\nmajor disjunction" exists between contemporary thought and terminology and the\nthought and terminolgy in Paul's time (187-88).\n\n      What is this "disjunction"?  He bases it on historical and linguistic\nfacts.  Accordingly, ancient Greek and Roman society treated male sexuality as\npolyvalent and characterized a person sexually only by his sexual acts. \nVirtually all forms of behavior, except transvestism, were acceptable. \nChristianity simply added the categories of "natural" and "unnatural" in\ndescribing these actions.  Ancient society know nothing of the categories of\n"homosexuals" and "heterosexuals," and assumed that, in the words of Dover\nquoted approvingly by Petersen, "everyone responds at different times to both\nhomosexual and to heterosexual stimuli. . ." (188). [23]\n\n      In contrast to this, modern usage virtually limits the term "homosexual"\nto desire and propensity.  K.M. Benkert, who in 1869 coined the German term\nequivalent to "homosexual," used it as referring to orientation, impluse or\naffectional preference and having "nothing to do with sexual acts" (189).\n\n     Petersen then proceeds to cite the "Supplement to the Oxford English\nDictionary,"  which defines "homosexual" only as a propensity or desire with no\nmention of acts.  Petersen's point is that by using "homosexuals" for\narsenokoitai, one wrongfully reads a modern concept back into early history\n"where no equivalent concept existed" (189).  Consequently the translation is\ninaccurate because it "includes celibate homophiles,. . . . incorrectly exludes\nheterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts . . . [and]incorrectly includes\nfemale homosexuals" (19=89).  Prior to 1869 there was no "cognitive structure,\neither inour society or in antiquity, within which the modern bifurcation of\nhumanity into 'homosexuals' and 'hetersosexuals' made sence" (189).\n\n     The foregoing clarifies why Petersen feels that the translatio\n"homosexual" is mistaken.  Yet is it possible that Petersen is the one\nmistaken, on both historical and linguistic or philological grounds?  The next\nphases of this paper will critically examine Petersen's position.\n\n                        THE JUSTIFICATION FOR TRANSLATING\n                          ARSENOKOITAI BY "HOMOSEXUALS"\n\nHistorical Grounds\n\n     A refutation of the foregoing opposition to the traslation of arsenokoitai\nby "homosexuals" begins with the historical and cultural evidence.  Since\nvirtually everyone acknowledges that the word does not appear before Paul's\nusage, no historical settings earlier than his are available.  Yet much writing\nreveals that ancient understanding of homosexuality prior to and contemporary\nwith Paul.  The goal is to discover wheither the ancient s conceived of\nhomosexuality, particularly homosexual orientation, in a way similar to\npresent-day concepts.  \n\n     Peterson, Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs claim that the homosexual\ncondition, desire, propensity, or inversion -whatever it is called- cannot be\npart of the definition of the term.  They assert this either because the term\nis limited to acts of particular kind (Boswell, active male prostitutes; \nScroggs, pederasty) or because the homosexual condition was unknown in ancient\ntimes (Bailey; Petersen).  The following discussion will show why neither of\nthese positions is legitimate.  Attention will be devoted to the latter postion\nfirst with the former one being addressed below under "Linguistic Grounds."\n\n     In regard to the latter position, one may rightfully ask, did not the\nhomosexual condition exist before 1869?  Is it only a modern phenomenon? Yet if\nit is universal, as alleged today, it must have existed always including\nancient times, even though there is lack of sophistication in discussing it. \nIndeed, evidence show that the ancients, pre-Christian and Christian, not only\nknew about the total spectrum of sexual behavior, including all forms of\nsame-sex activity (transvestism included), but also knoew about same-sex\norientation or condition.  Petersen admits (190 n. 10) that Plato in\n"Symposium" (189d-192d) may be a "sole possible exception" to ancient\ningnorance of this condition.  He discounts this, however, believing that even\nhere "acts appear to be the deciding factor."  However, this is a very\nsignificant exception, hardly worthy of being called "an exception," because of\nthe following additional evidence for a homosexual condition.\n\n     THe "Symposium" of Plato gives some of the strongest evidence for\nknowledge about the homosexual condition. [24]   Plato posits a third sex\ncomprised of a maile-female (androgynon ("man-woman"). Hence "original nature"\npalai physis, consisted of three kinds of human beings.  Zeus sliced these\nhuman beings in half, to weaken them so that they would not be a threat to the\ngods.  Consequently each person seeks his or her other half, either one of the\nopposite sex or one of the same sex.  Plato then quotes Aristophances:\n\n    Each of us, then, is but a tally of a man, since every one shows like\n    a flatfish the traces of having been sliced in two;  and each is ever\n    searching for the tally that will fit him.  All the men who are sections\n    of that composite sex that at first was called man-woman are \n    woman-courters;  our adulterers are mostly descended from that sex,\n    whence likewise are derived our mancourting women and adulteresses.\n    All the women who are sections of the woman have no great fancy for men:\n    they are incllined rather to women, and of this stock are the she-minions.\n    Men who are sections of the male pursue the masculine, and so long as \n    their boyhood lasts they show themselves to be sliced of the male by\n    making griends with men and delighting to lie with them and to be\n    clasped in men's embrasces;  these are the finest boys and striplings,\n    for they have the most manly nature.  Some say they are shameless\n    creatures, but falsely:  for their behavior is due not to shamelessness\n    but to daring, manliness, and virility, since they are quick to welcome\n    their like.  Sure evidence of this is the fact that on reaching maturity\n    these alone prove in a public career to be men.  So when they come\n    to man's estate they are boy-lovers, and have no natural interest in\n    wiving and getting children but only do these things under stress of\n    custom;  they are quite contented to live together unwedded all their days.\n    A man of this sort is at any rate born to be a lover of boys or the \n    willing mate of a man, eagerly greeting his own kind.  Well, when\n    one of them -whether he be a boy-lover or a lover of any other sort- \n    happens on his own particular half, the two of them are wondrously \n    thrilled with affection and intimacy and love, and are hardly to be \n    induced to leave each other's side for a single moment.  These are\n    they who continue together throughout life, though they could not\n    even say what they would have of one another (191d-192c) [25]\n\nShould these two persons be offered the opportunity to be fused together for as\nlong as they live, or even in Hades, Aristophanes says that each "would\nunreservedly deem that he had been offered just what he was yearning for all\nthe time:  (192e).\n\n     Several observations about this text are in order.  Lesbianism is\ncontemplated, as will as male homosexuality (191e).  "Natural interest" (ton\nnoun physei), (192b) refelects modern concepts of propensity or inclination. \nThe words, "born to be a lover of boys or the willing mate of a man: \n(paiderastes te kai philerastes gignetai), (192b) reflect the modern claims "to\nbe born this," i.e., as homosexual.  The idea of mutuallity ("the two of them\nare wondrously thrilled with affection and intimacy and love," 192b) is\npresent.  Aristophanes even speaks of "mutual love ingrained in mankind\nreassembling our early estate" (ho eros emphytos allelon tois anthropois kai\ntes archaias physeos synagogeus, 191d). The concept of permanency ("These are\nthey who continue together throughout life," 102c) is also present.  Further\nmention of and/or allusion to permanecy, mutality, "gay pride," pederasty,\nhomophobia, motive, desire, passion, and the nature of love and its works is\nrecognizable.\n\n    Clearly the ancients thought of love (homosexual or other) apart from\nactions.  THe speakers in the Symposium argue that motive in homosexuality is\ncrucial;  money, office, influence, etc. . . bring reproach (182e-183a, 184b). \nThey mention the need to love the soul not the body (183e).  There are tow\nkinds of love in the body (186b) and each has its "desire" and "passion"\n(186b-d).  The speakers discuss the principles or "matters" of love (187c), the\ndesires of love (192c) and being "males by nature" (193c).  Noteworthy is the\nspeech of Socrates who devotes much attention to explaining how desire is\nrelated to love and its objects (200a-201c).  Desire is felt for "what is not\nprovided or present; for something they have not or are not or lack."  This is\nthe object of desire and love.  Socrates clearly distinguishes between "what\nsort of being is love" and the "works" of love (201e).  This ancient\nphilosopher could think of both realms -seaual acts as well as disposition of\nbeing or nature.  His wors have significance for more than pederasty. [26]\n\n     In summary, virtually every element in the modern discussion of love and\nhomosexuality is anticipated in the Symposium of Plato.  Petersen is in error\nwhen he claims that the ancients could only think of homosexual acts, not\ninclination or orientation.  Widespread evidence to the contray supports the\nlatter. [27]\n\n     Biblical support for homosexuality inclination in the contexts where\nhomosexual acts are discribed adds to the case for the ancient distinction.  In\nRom 1:21-28 such phrases as "reasoning," "heart," "becoming foolish," "desires\nof the heart." and "reprobate mind" prove Paul's concern for disposition and\ninclination along with the "doing" or "working" of evil (also see vv. 29-32). \nEven the catologues of vices are introdiced (I Tim 1:8-10) or concluded (I Cor\n6:9-11) by words describing what people "are" or "were," not what they "do." \nHabits betray what people are within, as also the Lord Jesus taught (cf. Matt.\n23:28).  The inner condition is as important as the outer act; one gives rise\nto the other (cf. Mt 5:27).\n\n     Petersen errs regarding other particulars too.  Transvestism apparently\nwas accepted by the ancients.   It was practiced among Canaaniteds, Syrian,\npeople of Asia Minor, as well as Greeks, according to S.R. Driver. [28]  Only a\nfew moralist and Jewish writers are on record as condemning it.  For example,\nSeneca (Moral Epistles 47.7-8) condemns homosexual exploitation that forces an\nadult slave to dress, be beardless, and behave as a woman.  Philo also goes to\nsome length to describe the homosexuals of his day and their dressing as women\n(The Special Laws III, 37-41;  see also his On the Virtues, 20-21, where he\njustifies prohibition of cross-dressing).  Even the OT forbade the interchange\nof clothing between the sexes  (Deut 22:5).\n\n     Petersen is also wrong in attributing to Christianity the creating of the\n"new labels" of "natural" and "unnatural" for sexual behavior.  These did not\nbegin with Paul (Rom 1:26-27) but go as far back as ancient Greece and even\nnon-Christian contemporaries used them.  Plato, the TEST.NAPH., Philo, Josephu,\nPlutarch, and others used these words or related concepts. [29]\n\nLinguistic Grounds

The founder of this\nmovement, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), was proclaimed to \nbe the Promised Reformer of this age as foretold in the Scriptures\nof almost all major religions of the world. He claimed to be the \nfulfillment of the long awaited second comming of Jesus Christ\n(metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised Messiah.\n\n        The claims of Hazrat Ahmad raised storms of hostility and\nextreme opposition, which are often witnessed in the history of \ndivine reformers. Even today this sect is being persecuted especial-\nly in some of the Muslim regimes. The right of Ahmadi Muslims to \nopenly practice their religion and to define themselves as Muslims\nhas been severely restricted in many Muslim Countries. The United\nNations, human rights organizations such as Amnesty International\nand top leaderships of some countries have voiced their concerns \nagainst this denial of basic human and civil liberaties to the\nmembers of this movement, but so far to no avail.\n\n        Despite the opposition and persecution, the movement cont-\ninues to grow with a current membership of millions from around the\nworld in over 130 countries, who come from diverse ethnic and cul-\ntural backgrounds.\n\n        The movement is devoted to world peace and strives towards\ndeveloping a better understanding of all religions. Ahmadi Muslims\nhave always been opposed to all forms of violence, bigotry, reli-\ngious intolerance and fundamentalism.\n\n        Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es-\ntablished a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clinics\nin many third world countries. These institutions are staffed by\nvolunteer professionals and are fully financed by the movement's\ninternal resources. The movement stresses the importance of educa-\ntion and leadership. Its members have included a high number of\nprofessionals as well as world class individuals.\n\n        The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral\nreform, establish peace and justice, and to unite mankind under\none universal brotherhood.\n\n\nNEWSGROUP CREATION: \n==================\n\n        The  discussion for this proposed newsgroup has now offi-\ncially ended. Voting will be held for three weeks. If the news-\ngroup gets 2/3rd majority AND 100 more "YES/Create" votes than\n"NO/don't create" votes; the newsgroup shall be created. \n\n\nABOUT THE VOTE-TAKER: \n====================\n\n        Mr. Anthony Lest has been asked by the proponents of\nthis newsgroup to act as an official impartial vote-taker for the\nproposed newsgroup. He has no objection to  use his workstation\nfor the purpose of vote-taking. Neither the University of Colora-\ndo, nor Anthony Lest has anything to do with the proposal of the\nnewsgroup.  They are just collecting the votes as a neutral third\nparty.\n\nQUESTIONS OR COMMENTS:\n=====================\n\n        Any questions or comments about the proposed newsgroup\nmay be sent to:\n     Nabeel A.

which Kenneth Engel challenges:\n\nI will wimp out and admit that I never liked the metaphor of\nJesus "paying" for our sins in the sense that many Christians\naccept as literal. The point is that God understands the suffering\nwe go through, not just intellectually like when we watch\nthe Somalians on TV, but _really_ understands, He can "feel" \nour pain. This fact is manifested by Jesus' life. We can argue\nthat someone in history might have suffered more than Jesus,\nwe can think of more horrible torture than crucifixion, we can\nthink of cases of betrayal and fruitless effort leading to\nworse despair, but the main point is that Jesus is in the\ntrenches with us, He is in everyone, whatever I do to the least\nof humanity I do to Him, and whatever I do for the least of\nhumanity I do for Him.\n\nNow, to reconcile this with the existence of hell is beyond my\ncapabilities, but that wasn't my goal.\n\n\nThankfully our moderator is surprising.\n\n\nAs I re-read this I must admit that this is more of a description\nof my faith than an explanation, but perhaps that's all\nI can do, hopefully that's all I have to do.
Andy Byler writes on the Biblical basis for the dogma of the\nImmaculate Conception:\n\n +  I will put enmity between you [the Serpent] and the woman, and\n + between your seed and her seed, she [can also be read he] shall\n + crush your head and you shall bruise her [or his] heel.\n + -Genesis 3.15\n\n +  He who commits sin is of the devil ...    -1 John 3.8\n\n +  Hail, full of grace [greek - kecharitomene], the Lord is with\n + thee ...    -Luke 1.28\n\nIn the Hebrew of Genesis 3:15, the gender is clearly masculine.\n\n + HE shall crush your head, and you shall bruise HIS heel.\n\nThe Latin has feminine forms, only by an accident of grammar.\n\nAndrew stated that KECHARITOMENE means not just "full of grace" but\n"having a plenitude or perfection of grace." The word is used\nelsewhere in the New Testament only in Ephesians 1:6\n\n + Unto the praise of the glory of his grace, in which he hath\n + GRACED us in his beloved Son. (Rheims-Douay translation)\n\nI cannot find any indication in my dictionary that the verb implies\nanything as strong as Andrew suggests, nor does the Ephesians\npassage suggest that the verb means "to preserve from any taint of\noriginal or actual sin from the first moment of existence." I should\nlike to see a comment on the meaning of the verb, preferably not\nfrom s writer who is discussing Luke 1:28 at the moment.
Protestants love to play up Jerome for all he is worth. They should\nremeber that after the Decree of Pope St. Damsus I, Jerome did not\nhesitate in accpeting the deuteroncanon, and quoted them as Scripture in\nhis later writings.  And as I have already pointed out, in a previous\nletter on this subject, the Catholic Church has accepted the\ndeuterocanon from the beginning.  And the Protestants in the 1500's all\nof a sudden revived the old theory of some, condemned by Pope, Council,\nand Church, that the deuterocanon were not inspired.\n\nAgain, why must the Church of Jesus Christ adopt the canon of the\nunbelieving Jews, drawn up in Jamnia in 90 AD, in countering the\nChristian use of the Septuagint.                 ^^^^^
I'm wondering if anyone knows the answer to a rather trivial question which\nI've been thinking about: What was the process used to divide the Bible into\nverses. I believe Jerome divided the New Testament, but I've never seen any\ndiscussion of *how* he did this. It seems rather arbitrary, as opposed to, for\nexample, making each sentence a verse.
[much stuff deleted]\n\nexcuse me, but what makes you think that just because he's atheist he\ndoesn't know anything about christianity????  in my (albeit limited)\nexperience atheists are often the ones who know _more_ about the\nbible, having searched it from end to end for answers.  i myself am a\nchristian, but that doesn't mean i consider myself more of an\nauthority on my religion -- i just have a different perspective on it\n(more biased in favor, naturally :) ).\n\nit seems quite obvious why he is subscribed, if i may infer from what\nmotives anyway -- at the very least (although i dislike this kind of\nlogic), one could hope that he will "see the light".  critcism will, i\nfear, not give him a very positive picture of christians....\n\n\nwith regard to this, i guess i don't really feel sentiments of this\norder can be proven -- faith has a lot to do with it.  this is why\nthose who search the bible from cover to cover for answers won't\nnecessarily get what they're looking for.  of course that doesn't help\nanyone who doesn't already have faith -- what a big catch 22.  i\ndiscovered this quite recently when i ran into an agnostic looking for an\nexplanation of my faith and i quickly discovered that i could give him\nnothing more than my life story and a description of my nature.  faith\nis a very personal thing -- any attempt to "prove" the "facts" behind\nit must be questioned.\n\n\nlikewise -- no matter what you believe.
This may sound argumentative, but do the pro-homosexual crowd give the\nsame support to church members that are involved in incestuous relationships?\nIf we do a little substitution above, we get:\n\n"although by no means all episcopalians are sympathetic to incestuous\nmen and women, there certainly is a fairly larget percentage (in my\nexperience) who are.  I am good friends with an episcopalian minister\nwho is ordained and living in a monogamous incestual relationship.  This\nin no way diminishes his ability to minister -- in fact he has a very\nsignificant ministry with the Incest association of his community..."\n\nDo the same standards apply?  If not, why not?  And while we're in the\nballpark, what about bestiality?  I can't recall offhand if there are\nany direct statements in the Bible regarding sex with animals; does that\nactivity have more or less a sanction?\n\nPlease avoid responses such as "you're taking this to extremes".  I would\nguess that a disproportionate percentage of the inerrant Bible community\nviews homosexual acts with distaste in the same manner that society at\nlarge views incest.\n\n-- \n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nScott Cokely       | (714) 833-4760   scott.cokely@nb.rockwell.com		    \n"They came for the Davidians, but I did not speak up because\n I was not a Davidian.  Then they came for me..."  Opinions expressed\nare mine and do not represent those of Rockwell.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[ Obviously you can replace homosexuality in the above statement by\nanything from murder to sleeping late.  That doesn't mean that the\nsame people would accept those substitutions.  The question is whether\nthe relationships involved do in fact form an appropriate vehicle to\nrepresent Christ's relationship to humanity.  This is at least\n*partly* an empirical question.  \n\nIn some cases types of human relationship have been rejected because\nover time they always seem to lead to trouble.  I think that's the\ncase with slavery.  One can argue that in theory, if you follow Paul's\nguidelines, it's possible to have Christian slaveholders.  But in\npractice, over a period of time, most people came to the conclusion\nthat nobody can really have that degree of control over another and\nnot abuse it.  \n\nThe message you were responding to was asking you to look at the\nresults from Christian communities that endorse homosexuality.  (Note:\nChristian homosexuals, not people you see on the news advocating some\nextremist agenda).  You may not want to base your decision completely\non that kind of observation, but I would argue that it's at least\nrelevant.  You can't answer the request by asking why you shouldn't\nlook at the Incest association, because in fact there is no such\nassociation.  If there were, it might be reasonable for you to look at\nit too.  Of course that doesn't mean that the results of all such\nexaminations would necessarily come out the same way.  Part of why\nthere aren't groups pushing all possible relaxed standards is that\nsome of them do produce obviously bad results.
Well I am one of those (apparently) odd people who can sometimes\ncontrol their dreams.  For example, I might decide before going to\nsleep that I want to repeat a favourite dream, or dream about a\nspecific place.  Or if I am having an unpleasant dream, I can often\n(not always) redirect events to something more pleasant.\n\nI guess I think that the same standards apply in these "directed"\ndreams as apply in waking fantasies or real life (ref Jesus teaching\nabout looking at a woman lustfully being the same a committing\nadultary).\n\nWhen my normal dreams display themes that I would not conciously chose\nto dream about, I take that as a sign that all is not well with my\n"inner life" - maybe I have underlying tenstions/fears that need to be\nresolved, or maybe its straightforward sin.  In either case, the cause\nneeds to be resolved.  \n\nIn fact, either case is pretty rare.  I don't\noften remember dreams that I don't chose to have.  When I do, they\nalmost always tell me something important.\nI also almost never dream in pictures, and especially not in colour\n(in fact I've had precisely one full colour picture dream that I can\nremember, and it was definately spiritually important)\nI tend to dream in sound, with the odd blurred image, in black and\nwhite.\n\nInteresting topic - I'll be fascinated to read other responses.\n\nAlison
bruce@liv.ac.uk (Bruce Stephens) suggests different levels of acceptance of\nhomosexuality:\n\nI would add 4': our churches should accept homosexual orientation but hold all\npeople to certain standards of sexual behavior.  Promiscuity, abuse of power\nrelationships, harrassment, compulsivity are equally out of place in the lives\nof homosexual as of heterosexual people.\n\nOf course, this would bring up the dread shibboleth of homosexual marriage,\nand we couldn't have that! :-)
It is important if Christianity is being damaged by it. If\npeople who "speak in tongues" make claims that they are\nmiraculously speaking a foreign language through the power of\nthe Holy Spirit, when it can easily be shown that they are simply\nmaking noises, it damages all Christians, since many who are\nnot Christians do not distinguish between the various sects.\n\nThe more modest claim for "tongues" that it is simply\nuncontrolled praise in which "words fail you" is surely the one\nthat should be used by those who make use of this practice.\n\nI agree with the point that "Charismatic" practices like this\ncan lead to forms of worship which are more about the\nworshipper showing off than genuine praise for God; one of the\nthings Jesus warned us about.
This has troubled me for a long time and needs to be dealt with.\n\nFrom a long article Available through an individual on this newsgroup.\n\nAbout scripture being against homosexuality:\n------------------------------------------\nWhen we  are\nless homophobic we will see that what we know as gay and lesbian  people,\nengaging in loving, voluntary erotic relations with each other, aren't  even\nmentioned. [in the Bible, tk]\n------------------------------------------\n\nThis frightens me (not in the homophobic sense, but intellectually),\nespecially because it was written by someone from a homosexual church.\n\nSo, if my interpretation is different than theirs, I am homophobic!  This\ncan't be right. Disagreement in interpretation of the Bible and/or rejection\nof homosexual acts is not tantamount of homophobia.
...\n\nThe so-called Athanasian Creed has never been a recognized standard of faith \nin the Orthodox Church. It was introduced (without the Filioque) in certain \nservice-books in the 17th and 18th centuries at a time when there was a \nstrong Western influence on Orhtodoxy.
When I need a kick-butt God, or when I need assurance of the reality\nof truth, I pray to God the Father.\n\nWhen I need a friend, someone to put his arm around me and\ncry with me, I pray to Jesus.\n\nWhen I need strength or wisdom to get through a difficult situation,\nI pray for the Holy Spirit.\n\nI realize that the above will probably make some people cringe,\nbut what can I say? I think the doctrine of the trinity is\nan attempt to reconcile Jesus being God and being distinct from\nGod, as described in the Bible.\n\nI wonder if Jesus had been a Hindu how different the wording would be.
...\n\nI have seen it used in an Orthodox church once, although I can't recall why.\nI found it odd, to say the least.  Also, I object to the statement that the\nOrthodox DELETE the filioque from the original form of the Creed.\n\nThe creed originally did NOT contain that phrase, and it is not present\nin the Greek original, which hangs by my desk.  Not intending to start a\nflame war.  We didn't need to delete what wasn't there.\n\nLarry Overacker (llo@shell.com)\n--
Though there is a command in the law not to heed to one who prophecies \nfalsely, it is still possible for the one who has prophecied falsely\nto prophecy truely again.  Take, for example the story in Kings about the\nman of God from Judah who came to israel and prophecied against a king.\nThe Lord had commanded him to not eat or drink till he returned home.\nAnother prophet wanted this man of God to stay in his house, so he\nprophecied falsely that the Lord wanted the man of God to stay in his \nhouse.  While they ate and drank in his house, the Lord gave the prophet\nwho lied a word that the man of God would die from breaking the word of\nthe Lord.  It came to pass.
[referring to Mary]\n\nI have quite a problem with the idea that Mary never committed a sin.\nWas Mary fully human?  If it is possible for God to miraculously make \na person free of original sin, and free of committing sin their whole\nlife, then what is the purpose of the Incarnation of Jesus?  Why can't\nGod just repeat the miracle done for Mary to make all the rest of us\nsinless, without the need for repentance and salvation and all that?\n\nI don't particularly object to the idea of the assumption, or the\nperpetual virginity (both of which I regard as Catholic dogma about which\nI will agree to disagree with my Catholic brothers and sisters in\nChrist), and I even believe in the virgin birth of Jesus, but this\nconcept of Mary's sinlessness seems to me to be at odds with the\nrest of Christian doctrine as I understand it.

[To the moderator: I posted this about a week ago but it never showed\n                   up (locally) on the net.  If this has already\n                   actually been posted, please fill free to flush\n                   this copy.  --N]\n\nFrom: db7n+@andrew.cmu.edu (D. Andrew Byler)\n\n1] A english translation of this can be found in:\n   "The Acts of the Apostles, translated from the Codex Bezae, with an\n   introduction on its Lucan Origin and Importance", J. M. Wilson\n   (London, 1923).\n\n2] Another work that might be useful is:\n   "The Acts of the Apostles, a Critical Edition with Introduction and\n   Notes on Selected Passages", Albert C. Clark (Oxford, 1933;\n   reprinted 1970).\n\n(This is an edition of text of Acts that makes the assumption that the\ntext in Codex Bezae is the more authentic.  I don't know if it\nactually contains an english translation or not.)\n\n3] Another useful that discusses many of the variants in detail is:\n   "The Theological Tendency of the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis in\n   Acts", Eldon J Epp (Cambridge, 1966).\n\n4] The most recent reference I found was an edition in French from the\nearly '80s.  (I can supply the reference if anyone's interested.)\n\n5] Now, many of the works are going to be difficult to find.  So if\nyou're interested in examining the differences in the long recension\nan excellent (and easily obtainable) discussion can be found in:\n   "A Textual Commentary on the Greek NT", Bruce Metzger (United Bible\n   Society, 1971).\n\nMetzger's book serves as a companion volume to the UBS 3rd edition of\nthe Greek NT.  It contains a discussion on the reasoning that went\nbehind the decisions on each of the 1440 variant readings included in\nthe UBS3.  Furthermore, notes on an addition 600 readings are\nincluded in aTCotGNT (the majority of these occur in Acts).\n\n   "[An attempt was made] to set before the reader a more or less full\n   report (with an English translation) of the several additions and\n   other modifications that are attested by Western witnesses ...\n   Since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the\n   text-volume, care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the\n   evidence that supports the divergent readings." (p 272).\n\n\n6] Most of the copies of the text of Acts that we have (including the\nones in Vaticanus and Siniaticus) adher pretty closely to the shorter\n(or Alexandrian) version.  The longer version to which you refer is\nusually called the "Western" version and its main witness is the Codex\nBezae (althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources).\n\n7] As far as size, the difference is that in Clark's edition\n(mentioned above) the book of Acts contains 19,983 words whereas the\ntext edited by Westcott and Hort (a typical Alexandrian text) contains\n18,401 words; i.e. a difference of about 8-1/2%.\n\n8] To answer the obvious questions, no, there are no major revelations\nin the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text.  The main\ndifference seems to "expansion" of detail in the Western text (or, if\nyou prefer "contractions" in the Alexandrian).  The Western text seems\nto be given to more detail.  There are some interesting specific\ncases, but this probably not the place to go into it in detail.\n\n9] The discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the\nmore authentic has been hot and heavy.  If there is anything\napproaching a modern consensus it is (i) that neither text represents\npurely the "authentic" version, (ii) each variant reading has to be\nexamined on its own merits however, (iii) the variant in the\nAlexandrian text is the "better" more often than not.
In response to alleged circular reasoning concerning the morality of      \nhomosexuality, clh poses the following challenge:\n\n\nI answer,\n\nThe circle is simple to break.   The Church teaches that homosexual\nbehavior is immoral.  This teaching is raw, impassionate, unassailable\ndogma.  That closes the argument for me.\n\n\n-- \nRandal Lee Nicholas Mandock \nCatechist\ngt7122b@prism.gatech.edu

: \n:   .\n:            It's my understanding that the U.S. Supreme Court has never \n:        given a legal definition of religion.  This despite the many \n:        cases involving religion that have come before the Court. \n:            Can anyone verify or falsify this?  \n:            Has any state or other government tried to give a legal \n:        definition of religion? \n\nAccording to the legal practices of today's America, I imagine the legal\ndefinition of religion, if defined, may resemble the following:\n\n	"Any system of belief or practice to which people are committed\n	for the benefit of society which must, in the opinion of secular\n	thought, be isolated from political and educational influence."\n\n	"Should any system of belief or practice to which people are\n	committed be harmful or void of any benefit to society in the\n	opinion of religious thought as defined in the previous paragraph,\n	isolation of such from political and educational influence would\n	constitute unreasonable censorship and an unlawful violation of\n	civil rights."
EXACTLY!!  Read that one sentence in there..."to the degree\n	that means other than the death penalty and military operations are\n	sufficient to keep the peace, then these non-violent provisions are to\n	be preferred..."\n\n	I don't believe that it is necessary for us to murder criminals to keep\n	the peace; the Church in the United States feels the same way, thus the\n	reason that the Catholic Church has opposed every execution in this\n	country in recent memory.\n\n\n	So what is justifiable?  As you stated very explicitly from the new\n	Catechism, the only justifiable case is when it is necessary to keep\n	the peace.  Since that does not apply *at all* to this country, the\n	logical conclusion (based on your own premises) is that one must be\n	opposed to *any* form of capital punishment in America.
My feeling on baptism is this:  parents baptize their baby so that the\n	baby has the sanctifying grace of baptism (and thus removal of original\n	sin) on its soul in the event of an unexpected death.\n	\n	That is, the parents speak on behalf of the child which is too young\n	to speak on its own.  This should not surprise anyone:  don't parents\n	*always* do what they believe is the best for their baby?  Why would\n	that apply to the baby's physical needs only but not his/her spiritual\n	needs to have God's grace?\n	\n	The purpose of confirmation is for the baby (now young adult) to \n	decide to re-affirm for himself/herself the promises that his/her\n	parents made at baptism.  That is where accepting Jesus into your\n	heart comes in.  In baptism, the parents ask Jesus to come into their\n	baby's heart; at confirmation the child repeats that request \n	independently.

We can also analyze to whom the Lord is addressing: "Marvel\nAlan> not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again" (John 3:7).\nAlan> Here Jesus is clearly directing his remarks to Nicodemus -- a\nAlan> ruler of the Jews (not a child).\n\nYes, but Jesus also made a very general and doctrinal statement\nin the same conversation:\n\n"Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit."\n(John 3:6)\n\nClearly infants are not born of the spirit.  Thus, without baptism\nthey are unspiritual.  They are not born with the image of God, but in\nAdam's fallen image (cf. Gen 5:3).  They have no righteousness of\ntheir own, just as adults have no righteousness of their own.  There\nis only the imputed righteousness of Christ, which believers receive\nthrough faith.\n\nAlan> 3.  We can ask ourselves why the Lord would even introduce the\nAlan> concept of spiritual re-birth through baptism if newborn babies\nAlan> weren't free from sin?\n\nYour point is a little obscure here, but I think you are saying\nthat Christ used the "innocence" of newborn babes as a metaphor\nfor spiritual re-birth.  But this is not what he did.\nIf you look at the text, he did not speak\nof spiritual re-birth but of spiritual birth.  We are\nborn of the Spirit once, not twice or several times.\nWe are also born of the flesh once.  The Lord makes it\nclear that these are separate and different events.\nIt is true that other Scriptures refer to spiritual\nbirth as re-birth because it is a second birth\n(for example, Titus 3:5).  But it is not a second\n*spiritual* birth.\n\nThe only thing the two births have in common is the concept of birth,\nwhich is used as a symbol of `new life' -- not of innocence.  When an\ninfant is born (or conceived) a new life is begun--but it is neither\ninnocent nor righteous.  Similarly when that same individual is\nbaptized, or perhaps when they believe prior to baptism, they begin a\nnew life in Christ (Romans 6:3, Colossians 2:12, Titus 3:5, Ephesians\n2:5).  Then the believer has God's assurance of the forgiveness of\ntheir sins, and of Christ's imputed righteousness.\n\nFor references, see \n	The Augsburg Confession Article II, Original Sin, \n	The Apology to the Augsburg Confession, \n		Article II, Original Sin, \n	the Formula of Concord, Article I, Original Sin, and \n	Luther's Large Catechism, Part 4, Baptism.  \n\nFor something more recent, see "Baptized into God's Family: The\nDoctrine of Infant Baptism" by Andrew Das, available from Northwestern\nPublishing House.

I think that if someone often has immoral dreams, like lustful dreams, \nor dreams where you commit acts of violence, etc. etc. it may be a sign \nthat he has something sinful in his heart.  It may be the Holy Spirit's\nway of allowing the sinfulness that is in us to come to light so that\nwe can pray about it and have it removed.  Generally, if one has a \npure heart, and sets his mind on things that are holy, he will be holy\neven when he dreams.\n\nDreams also can be from the Lord.  Joseph and Nebucadnezzar are two examples\nof people in the Bible who received dreams from the Lord.  \n\nRegarding out of body experiences, this is something that we have to be\ncareful with.  What is called an OOBE can be spiritual in nature, especially\nif what one saw is the same as an experience witnessed by someone else.\nChristians should certainly avoid any occult activity that would generate\nan out of body experience.  Some things that might be called an OOBE\nmight actually be from the Lord.  Paul wrote of what might of been an OOBE.\nIn II Corinthians 12, he wrote of a spiritual experience of being caught\nup into the third heaven.  Is an OOBE truely an OOBE?  Does one really\nleave his body, or is he just seeing an image being shown to him by a\nspirit, be it a demon or the Holy Spirit?  I don't think it matters\nthat much.  Paul could not tell.  \n\nBe that as it may, we should be careful not to open ourselves up to Satan\nto experience OOBE's.  We should not meditate and pretend we are in a \nplace until our spirits apparently float there.  This is dangerous.  If\nGod wants to gice us what seems like an OOBE, then He can do that of His\nown sovereign will.  In the Bible, most often it seems that prophets are\njust taken up by God's sovereign will, and not because they are seeking\nan OOBE.  John was in the Spirit praying on the Lord's day when he was\ncaught up in the visions he received.  Ezekial was talking with some\nJewish leaders when he was caught up into the visions of God one\ntime.  If God wants to take one of us up into a vision, he can do it.\nPeople should be careful not to open themselves up to evil spirits\nfor the sake of a few thrills.

[...etc...]\n\n\nI am becoming increasingly convinced that most of us take Paul's illustration\nabout one body / many parts far too narrowly. It is easy to say that the one\nbody represents a particular sect of Christianity (generally our own), and\nthe parts are clearly the various offices of ministry. There is a place for\nthat. But having met people who are walking closeely with God in a wide\nvariety of doctine - Catholic, Protestant, liberal, conservative, Orthodox,\netc. - I am willing to encompass a wide spectrum of views within the\ncontext of the 'body of Christ.' And I am equally sure that one day, after\nwe shug off this mortal coil, when we no longer see through a glass darkly\nbut see clearly, face to face, we will all be ashamed at some of the things\nwe held as truth. We ought all fellowship, worship, and serve where we are\ncalled, and understand that where we are called may not be where everyone\nelse is called.\n\nOne of the fathers of the reformation (help me out - can't recall the name)\nput it quite succiently:\n\n	In essentials, unity.\n	In nonessentials, liberty.\n	In all things, charity.\n\nWhile I agree with Lewis (Mere Christianity) that calling oneself a Christian\nimplies some basic, fundamental standards of belief if the word is to mean\nanything at all, I think most of us define the bounds of essentials a bit\ntoo broadly, deny the place for liberty in questionable issues near those\nbounds, and ignore the requirements of charity all together. \n\nMe? I attend a Vineyard church, speak in tongues, am effectively an\ninerrantist, though I'll grant some inaccuracy in translation, am moderately\npre-mill, and evangelical. But, I'm not ready to damn those who use icons,\nsay mass in latin, uphold the Virgin Mary (though I really don't believe\nthat she was sinless), vote on Church membership, or insist on baptism for\nsalvation. Of course, I think my doctine is pretty close to the truth -\nwhy would I follow it if I believed something else was closer to the truth?\nBut my understanding of the reality of a walk with Christ is continually\nevolving as I spend more and more time walking with Him, studying His word,\nand fellowshiping with others in the (often extended) family. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.                    \n  --T.S.

The Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to Catherine Laboure, a nun of the\nsisters of Charity on July 18, 1830 at Rue du Bac, Paris.\n\nSister Catherine was awakened late that night by a small boy, age 5\nor 6, who was literally glowing with some sort of interior light. \nThe child led her to the sanctuary of the chapel where he promised\nthe Virgin Mary was to be found awaiting her. Our Lady appeared to\nher and instructed her for two hours or more on matters pertaining\nto her life and to the future of France and the world.\n\nOn November 27 Our Lady appeared again to Catherine. She instructed\nher to have a medal struck. She told her that those who wore this \nmedal would enjoy special protection from the Mother of God and would\nreceive great graces. In less than a year there were three more\napparitions. In June of 1831 the medals were a reality. Many reports\nwere received by those who wore it. Within two years of its issuing\nthe medal was known as the "Miraculous Medal". Catherine died in 1876.\nHer body to this day is remarkably preserved (incorrupt). She was\ncanonized on July 27, 1947. Her body lies in the chapel at the\nmotherhouse on the Rue du Bac where she had her first meeting with\nOur Lady.\n\nThe apparition on November 27 1830 was of average height and clothed\nin white with a veil that flowed over the head and fell to the floor.\nAbove the altar, a pyramid painted to represent God's all knowing\nwisdom looked down on them. Our Lady's feet rested on a white globe\nand there was also a green serpent with yellow spots that she was\nstepping on. In her hands was a golden ball that represented the world.\nGreat streams of light issued from her hands and she also showed \nCatherine an image of two hearts, the Sacred Heart wrapped in\npiercing thorns and her own heart punctured by a sword. The sword\nrepresented her suffering with Jesus.\n\nThe apparitions announced the onset of the great battle and forewarned\nthat a dark era lay in the immediate future. It was the apparition \nleading up to the recent ones. Our Lady began to dispense secrets.\nAnd with the globe she revealed herself in worldwide dispute\nwith the forces of the dark. She told Catherine "The times are\nevil. Misfortunes will fall upon France. The throne will be\noverturned. The entire world will be overcome by evils of all\nkinds."\n\nRefer to books on St. Catherine for more of Our Lady's messages.\nA copy of the medal is also available in Catholic bookstores.\n\nI will post other Marian events every few days or so including\nthe ones happening today which are still under investigation.\nThese postings serve only to introduce you to these events.\nPlease look more into them and understand the reason for \nthe increasing number and urgency of these apparitions.\n\n--
Do we attach some meaning of the Israelites entering "the promised land" to \nChristianity?\n\n   I submit God did not hold the children responsible when the adults chose \nto follow the bad report of the 10 spies over Joshua and Caleb.  This is \nrecorded for us in Deuteronomy 1:39 "Moreover your little ones, which ye said \nshould be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge \nbetween good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give \nit, and they shall possess it."\n\n   At least to me it seems there was/is an age, or point in maturity where \nthey were/are held responsible, and could not enter the "Promised Land", \nyounger ones were not held to the same "rules", at least not by God.
Luke 16 talks about the rich man and Lazarus. Matthew 25 talks about \nthe eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. Revelations\n20 and 21 reference this fire as the place where unbelievers are\nthrown. Matthew 18 talks about being thrown into the eternal fire and\nthe fire of hell. It seems quite clear that there is this place where\na fire burns forever. From the Revelations passages it is clear that\nthe devil and his angels will be tormented there forever. From the\nMatthew 25 passage it doesn't seem abundantly clear whether the\npunishment of unbelievers is everlasting in the sense of final or\nin the sense of continual. \n \nFrom Dale's question, I come away with the suggestion that hell,\nif it were short, might be an acceptable alternative to living\nforever with the Source of Life, Peace and Joy i.e. the \nunbeliever ceases to exist. Whereas, if punishment goes on\ncontinually, then one should have a greater motivation to avoid it.\nIt definately seems to me that hell is something we want to avoid\nregardless of its exact nature. \n\nThere seem to be two main questions in Dale's thought:\nWhat is God's main plan on earth?\nWhy is continual punishment a necessary part of hell as opposed\nto simply destroying completely those who refuse God?\n\nI believe that God's main plan is to have a genuine relationship\nwith people.\n\nThe nature of hell and the reasons for its nature seem a lot more\ndifficult to ascertain. It does seem clear that hell is something\nto avoid. At a minimum, hell is the state one is in when one has\nnothing to do with God.\n\nIn the Bible, I am not aware of any discussion about the specifics of\nhell beyond the general of hot, unpleasant and torment. For instance,\nit is not discussed how (if at all) the rich man can\ncontinually stay in the fire and still feel discomfort or pain or\nwhether there is some point at which the pain sensing ability is\nburned up. If you can forgive the graphicalness, if you throw a\nphysical body into a fire, assuming the person starts out alive,\nat some fairly quick point, the nerves are destroyed and pain is\nno longer sensed. It is not stated what occurs when at the judgement,\nthe unbelievers, (who are already physically dead) are cast into hell\ni.e. they no longer have a physical body so they can't feel physical\npain. What could be sensed continually is that those in hell are\nto be forever without God. \n \nThe Lazarus/rich man parable is told with the idea of having the listener\nthink in physical terms in order to get the point that some people\nwon't listen to God even after he rises from the dead. The point of\nthe parable is to reach the hard-hearted here who are not listening\nto the fact of the resurrection nor the Gospel about Jesus Christ.\nIt seems reasonable to also draw from the parable that hell is\nnot even remotely pleasant.
Well, Michael,  I don't know if clh has left them in the faq  (Maybe you should\npost the "how to get there map again), but I posted two or three lengthy\nexegetical paper on these verses.  They looked at the OT, NT and\nintertestimental usages of terms in reference.  I would suggest you read those\nbefore you talk about a "need" in exegetical studies.  If those aren't enough,\nI could also provide "The source and NT Meaning of Apsevokoitai".  Dr James\nDeYoung published it in THE MASTERS SEMINARY JOURNAL in fall of '92.  To read\nany of these 4 papers shows that the shoe is on the other foot as far as a need\nfor honest exegesis.\n\nAgain, please refer to the faq file, or if you are unable to acess it, drop me\na line and I will enclose them to you.\n\nRexlex@fnal.fnal.gov
: You might want to re-think your attitude about the Holocaust after\n: reading Deuteronomy chapter 28.\n\nOn the contrary, after the Holocaust, I would be _very_ cautious about my\ninterpretatoin of Deuteronomy 28.  Not everything that happens is in\naccordance with God's will.  (You might guess which side of the\npredestination issue I am on.)  I will never _assume_ that evil is \npunishment by God, especially when I am speaking of the evil that falls on\n_someone else_.  For my own life, I will work to discern the hand of God\nin the evil that befalls _me_.\n\nSee the discussion earlier on Luke 13.

I'm very grateful for scott's reflections on this oft-quoted phrase.  Could\nsomeone please remind me of the Scriptural source for it?  (Rom. 12.9 doesn't\ncount, kids.)  The manner in which this little piece of conventional wisdom is\napplied has, in my experience, been uniformly hateful and destructive.
Regarding the consequences of the original sin:\n\nCatholics believe that what Adam primarily lost by his sin, for\nhimself and the human race, was sanctifying grace.  This is basically\na share in the Divine life.  Take a rock and make it able to talk:\nwhat God does to a human being through sanctifying grace is similar.\nIt makes such a one able to live on a plane that is above the powers\nof any possible creature.  This is the "everlasting life" that the New\nTestament speaks of.\n\nWhat Christ did when he came was to restore this life of sanctifying\ngrace to the human race.  He instituted the Sacraments as the means by\nwhich this life is given to people, and its increase fostered.\n\nThe absence of sanctifying grace at death means automatic exclusion\nfrom Heaven.  The nature of Heaven is such that it's impossible for a\nhuman being to have any part in it without the gift of sanctifying\ngrace.  To use my example, it would be like taking that rock and\nattempting to hold a conversation with it: rocks cannot talk.  Neither\ncan human beings live in Heaven without sanctifying grace.\n\nThis all obviously applies equally well to infants or adults, since\nboth have souls.  Infants must be baptized, therefore, or they cannot\nenter into Heaven.  They too need this form of life in them, or they\ncannot enter into Heaven.\n\nTurning it around, infant baptism is good supporting evidence for the\nCatholic belief in sanctifying grace.  Unless Baptism causes some\nchange in an infant's soul, there is no particular reason to insist on\nthe practice.  Yet infant Baptism was probably practiced by the\nApostles themselves, and was *certainly* part of the Church shortly\nthereafter.
From Bit.listserv.christia\n\nZane writes...\n \nFrom: FACN34B@SAUPM00.BITNET (zane of dhahan)\nSubject: Christianity in Crisis\nDate: Wed May 12 14:43:19 1993\n \n"Frank, first of all, thanks for all of the great Scripture verses.  It\nwas a pleasure to read them."\n \nMY REPLY...\nYou are welcome, Zane.\n \nZane...\n"I am sure nothing that I will say will change your mind about it... but I\nwould like to ask you if the book in question really does anything for you.\nI mean, were you all caught up in the word/faith thing, but now that you\nhave read the book you've been rescued from all of the error and pain that\nwill result in your Christian life?"\n \nMY REPLY...\n(1) When I first became a Christian, I entered into the Word/Faith\n    movement.  It was easy.  I wasn't grounded in the Word of God and sound\n    doctrine.  When I visited Christian book stores, the cheapest books I\n    could find to buy were the .50 and $1.00 books by Hagin and others.\n    Consequently, I began receiving Hagin's monthly magazine (and they\n    still send it to me), and also Copeland's (also, still sent to me).\n    It wasn't until I read a booklet by Jimmy Swaggart called _Hyper Faith:\n    The New Gnosticism_ that I began to realize the teachings I were\n    partaking of were error.  I started reading the Bible more and studying\n    more.  Sure enough, Jimmy was right in many points.  As part of my\n    experience, I am alerting Christians, particularly new Christians, that\n    these teachings are heretical and they need to do as the Bereans did in\n    Acts 17:11 - check these teachings out with Scripture!\n \n(2) My brother in law was involved in a Word/Faith "cult" in my area - it's\n    leader is real good friends with Benny Hinn.  Rather then going into\n    much detail about this, suffice it to say he was deceived, mistreated, and\n    has now fallen into atheism.  I'm still praying for him (Phil. 1:6).\n \n(3) The assistant pastor at the church I teach adult Sunday School in has been\n    a `follower' of Copeland for 15 years.  He has thousands of tapes by the\n    Faith teachers.  In the class recently, I quoted several of the teachers'\n    heretical statements to his surprise.  Since then, I've been able to talk\n    to him at length about these issues.\n \n(4) The leader of the Women's Group at my church is a Benny Hinn `fan'.\n    Recently, I found that she has been lending _Good Morning, Holy Spirit_ to\n    women in the church.  That prompted my quotes in Sunday School, as well as\n    my lending CIC to people in the church.\n \nI'm well aware of the abuses and heresies perpetrated in this movement and\nhave an urgency in my heart and life to warn people about the heresies.\nWhat heresies?\n    A. Jesus became sin - took on the very nature of the devil, and became\n        one with him.\n    B. Jesus' death on the cross wasn't enough to atone.\n    C. Jesus was dragged to hell after His death, was beat and abused by\n        Satan and demons, thus finishing our atonement.  Satan was ruling\n        over Him there.\n    D. Jesus was `born-again' in hell.\n    E. Jesus died spiritually, lost His divinity, and reassumed it after\n        the resurrection.\n    F. We are gods.\n \nThese are heresies.  Documentation will be provided re: these teachings\nupon request.\n \nZane...\n"Or what does it do for you?  Is it preventing you from going out and\njoining up with the word/faith movement which you'd been contemplating\njoining for so long, but now that you've read the book, you've been saved\nfrom all of that?"\n \nMY REPLY...\nIt wasn't _Christianity In Crisis_ that helped me; it was a booklet by\nSwaggart that I mentioned above.  But CIC is MUCH, MUCH better - tremendous\ndocumentation and insights.\n \nZane...\n"I don't have a nice Scriptural answer for why I believe it is at best un-\nprofitable for Christians to engage in this type of activity - heresy hunting."\n \nMY REPLY...\nWhy do you call it "heresy hunting"?  "Hunting" implies it isn't readily\naccessible or available.  This movement is the fastest growing movement in\nChristendom.  Hagin has sold over 40 million books and booklets.  Hinn has sold\nmore books in the last couple of years than Swindoll and Dobson combined.  Fred\nPrice has the largest church in terms of seating capacity in the USA.  Doesn't\nsound like much "hunting" is needed.\n \nIt is Scriptural to expose doctrinal error.  I gave some verses to you before.\nMore can be given.  Most of the epistles were written due to error (doctrinal,\npractical) in the churches.  The early church had numerous councils to expose\nerror and heresy.  It's not a new thing.  Remember Luther?\n \nZane...\n"I would like to point out though, that historically those who hunt heretics\noften end up causing a bigger mess than the heretics... but this is my un-\ndocumented opinion."\n \nMY REPLY...\n(1) If you can provide documentation, it would be appreciated.\n(2) Read Ephesians 4:11-16, esp. vss. 13 and 14 and tell me what causes\n    disunity and immaturity in the body.\n \nEPH 4:13-14 till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of\nthe Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness\nof Christ; that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried\nabout with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning\ncraftiness of deceitful plotting....\n \nDisunity, contrary to popular opinion, isn't caused by exposing error; it's\ncaused by error.\n \nZane...\n"There are many who probably give no place for seeing the Scriptures as\ndocumenting a Spiritual development or growth in its writers - but I would\nsuggest that the fiery Paul of the letter to the Galatians mellows and\nmatures into the one who loses all for the sake of Love in the End."\n \nMY REPLY...\nMost scholars believe Paul wrote 2 Timothy last.  Let's examine his admonitions\nto Tim to ascertain how mellow he had become...\n \n2TI 1:13-15 Hold fast the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me,\nin faith and love which are in Christ Jesus. That good thing which was\ncommitted to you, keep by the Holy Spirit who dwells in us. This you know, that\nall those in Asia have turned away from me, among whom are Phygellus and\nHermogenes.\n \n2TI 2:15-18 Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does\nnot need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. But shun profane\nand idle babblings, for they will increase to more ungodliness. And their\nmessage will spread like cancer. Hymenaeus and Philetus are of this sort, who\nhave strayed concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already\npast; and they overthrow the faith of some.\n \n2TI 2:24-26 And a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all,\nable to teach, patient, in humility correcting those who are in opposition, if\nGod perhaps will grant them repentance, so that they may know the truth, and\nthat they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil, having\nbeen taken captive by him to do his will.\n \n2TI 3:6-9 For of this sort are those who creep into households and make\ncaptives of gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,\nalways learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. Now as\nJannes and Jambres resisted Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of\ncorrupt minds, disapproved concerning the faith; but they will progress no\nfurther, for their folly will be manifest to all, as theirs also was.\n \n2TI 3:12-17 Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer\npersecution. But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving\nand being deceived. But you must continue in the things which you have learned\nand been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them, and that from\nchildhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise\nfor salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.

It's imperative that leadership\nbe made aware of this, and CIC does just that.\n \nAlso, let's examine a passage of Scripture...\n* EPH 4:11 And He Himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some\nevangelists, and some pastors and teachers,\n* EPH 4:12 for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the\nedifying of the body of Christ,\n \nThese ministry gifts that the Lord installs in the church are not just for one\nindividual church, but for "the body of Christ".\nPaul was an apostle - he traveled all over distilling his message.

> Paul repeatedly talks about the "thorn" in his side. Some think\n > it refers to lust, others pride, but who knows? Whatever the\n > thorn was, apparently it was not compatible with Christianity,\n > yet does that make his epistles any less?\n\nPaul mentions his "thorn" (SKOLOPS, actually a sharp stake) in 2\nCorinthians 12:7-9\n\n + And to keep me from being too elated by the abundance of\n + revelations, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of\n + Satan, to harass me, to keep me from being too elated. Three\n + times I besought the Lord about this, that it should leave me;\n + but he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my\n + power is made perfectr in weakness."\n\nHe does not explain what it was, but it need not have been a moral\nproblem.  One guess is that Paul had a disorder of the eyes. He\nordinarily dictated his letters, and then added a personal note and\nhis signature. At the end of the letter to the Galatians, he says,\n"See, I am writing in large letters with my own hand," or else, "See\nwhat a long letter I have written with my own hand." If the former\ntranslation is adopted, it seems that Paul could not write in the\nsmall script of a practiced writer, but needed to make his letters\nlarger, and this suggests eye problems. Again, he says to the\nGalatians (4:13-15),\n\n + You know that it was because of a bodily ailment that I preached\n + the gospel to you at first; and although my condition was a trial\n + to you, you did not scorn or despise me, but received me as an\n + angel of God.... For I bear you witness that, if possible, you\n + would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.\n\nPerhaps this last line means simply, "You would have done anything\nfor me, not withholding your most precious possessions (your eyes)."\nBut in that case, we would expect some wording like, "If I had\nneeded them." "If it were possible" sounds as though the bodily\nailment was connected with his eyes.\n\nWilliam Barclay, in his volume on Acts, makes a more specific\nsuggestion.  Before Paul preached in the highlands of Galatia, he\nhad been preaching in the coastal areas of Asia Minor. If he had had\na malarial attack while there, a doctor would have advised him to\nleave the low country and head for the hills. Malaria might well\nhave given him both severe headaches and blurred vision.

Before you finalize your file in the FAQs (or after), you might want to \ncorrect the typo in the following:\n\n\nIt seems one or the other end of the rating scale should be identified with \n"homosexual".\n\nAs a personal note, I guess I differ with you on the question of work \nentering human life as a result of sin.  \n \nBefore the fall (Gen 2:15) "And the LORD God took the man, and put him into \nthe garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it." which I would call "work".  \nFor me, the difference introduced by sin is the painful aspects of work added \nat the fall (I take the cursing of the ground in vs.17-19 to apply to the \nwork for sustenance).  In a way, some view "work" as a blessing (Ecclesiastes \nis a fun book! - for melancholies).\n\nI hope I do not sound caustic, maybe you can enlighten me further.\n\nWell, this is certainly a delicate subject, and I guess you accomplished what \nyou state as your purpose "It summarizes arguments for allowing Christian \nhomosexuality", not for me the most noble goal, but you are writing a FAQ.\n\nI wonder if you might temporize the apparent "sentence" of the specific \nhomosexual you propose (arguably tenuously define).\n  Perhaps that would be true of "celibacy from homosexual relations", or \nrefrainng from their choice relationships, but that does not forbid \nheterosexual.  Could they not have/enjoy heterosexual relations "for what it \nwas worth"?

I do not believe genuine prophecy was ever \n: like this.  Comments?\n: \n\nI agree.   People should not be misled to believe "thus sayeth the Lord" by\ninnuendo or opinion or speculation.\n\nSpeak directly.  If the Lord has given you something to say, say it.\nBut, before I declare "thus sayeth the Lord", I'd better know for certain\nwithout a shadow of a doubt that I am in the correct spiritual condition\nand relationship with the Lord to receive such a prophecy and be absolutely\ncertain, again, without the tiniest shadow of a doubt that there is no\npossibility of my being misled by my own imaginations or by my hope of gaining\nrecognition or of being misled by the wiles of the devil and his followers.\n\nMistakes in this area are costly and dangerous.  For me, my greatest fears\nin this area would be the following:\n\n1--that the people would be misled\n2--that people would lose respect for christianity\n3--that true prophecy would be clouded by all the false prophecies\n4--were God to call me to be a prophet and I were to misrepresent God's Word,\n   my calling would be lost forever.  God's Word would command the people\n   never to listen to or fear my words as I would be a false prophet.  My\n   bridges would be burnt forever.  Perhaps I could repent and be saved, but\n   I could never again be a prophet of God.\n\nIn the light of this, it is critical that we speak when the Lord says speak\nand that we be silent when the Lord says to be silent lest we deprive the\nworld of God's Word and hide it under a bushel either by our inappropriate,\ncowardly silence or by our false statements.  And because of this, it\nis critically important that we remain close to the Lord, in His Word, and\nin prayer, and filled with the Spirit of God so that we know the difference.\n\nIn this day and age, sinners spout off their mouths left and right judging\none another, claiming "rights" that are not theirs, denying rights that do\nindeed belong to others, demanding equal respect for all the "gods" of this\nworld, and uttering every form of falseness that promises to make one feel\ngood.\n\nIt's time that we christians give an example of honesty that stands out in\ncontrast against this backdrop of falsehood.  When we say, "thus sayeth the\nLord", it happens.  When we pray, prayer is answered because we prayed right.\nWhen we say we're christians, we really mean it.\n\n           Dan\n\n--\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n	"I deplore the horrible crime of child murder...\n	 We want prevention, not merely punishment.\n	 We must reach the root of the evil...\n	 It is practiced by those whose inmost souls revolt\n	 from the dreadful deed...\n	 No mater what the motive, love of ease,\n		or a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent,\n		the woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed...\n	 but oh! thrice guilty is he who drove her\n		to the desperation which impelled her to the crime."
In the course of discussing the Sabbath with some folks, \nI came across something that was completely new to me, \nand I thought I'd offer it for comment.\n\nTo keep this as brief as possible, let me state my \nobservation as a declarative statement, and then whoever \nwants to can comment on it.  Basically, what I think \nI've observed is that the phrase "the Ten Commandments", \nas used by Moses, is not a reference to Ex. 20:1-17, but \nrather a reference to ten distinct discourses from Ex. \n20:1 through Ex. 31:18.  That is, the phrase "the Ten \nCommandments" should more accurately be translated "the \nTen Discourses", of which the passage we call the "Ten \nCommandments" is really only the first.\n\nI'm not completely convinced that the above is true, but \nfor purposes of discussion, let me argue it as though I \nwas sure.\n\nArguments supporting the above idea:\n\n1)  There aren't really ten commandments in Ex. 20:1-17.  \nIn order to get 10 commandments, you have to get two of \nthem out of verses 3-6, and the verses themselves do not \nsupport such a division because they are all about not \nworshipping other gods.  That is, verse 3 commands to \nhave no other gods, and verse 5 commands to not worship \nthe idols mentioned in verse 4.  You can't violate \nverses 5-6 without violating verse 3, indicating that \nthe whole passage is one command, and leaving us with \nonly Nine "Commandments".  I could go on at length about \nthis, but for now I'll just stop with this summary.\n\n2)  There ARE ten speeches between Ex 20:1 (the beginning\nof the traditional "Ten Commandments") and Ex 31:18 \n(where God actually gives Moses the two tablets with the \nTen Commandments/Discourses written on them).  I break \nthese ten down as follows: 20:1-17; 20:22-26; 21:1-23:33; \n25:1-30:10; 30:11-16; 30:17-21; 30:22-33; 30:34-38; \n31:1-11; and 31:12-18.  In most cases, each of these \npassages begins with some variation of the phrase, "And \nthe LORD spoke to Moses, saying..."  The exception is \nEx. 21:1, which begins "Now these are the ordinances \nwhich you are to set before them..."\n\n3)  The word translated "commandments" in the phrase \n"the Ten Commandments" isn't really the word for \n"commandment", its the word for a speech, or an \nutterance.  It's a word often used for longer discourses \nrather than individual statements; for instance, when \ncombined with the word 'yom' (day), this word is \ntranslated "Chronicles" in such phrases as "now the rest \nof the acts of so-and-so, are they not written in the \nChronicles of x?..."  The word for "commandment" is \nfreely used throughout the books of Moses, and perhaps \nit is significant that when Moses spoke of the Ten X's, \nhe appears to have avoided the word for commandment and \nchosen instead a word associated with discourses longer \nthan just a single command.\n\n4)  God tells Moses that He is going to give him the \nstone tablets "with the law and the commandments" (Ex \n24:12), yet He does not give Moses the tablets until He \nhas finished all ten discourses on Mount Sinai.  If the \nTen Commandments were only Ex. 20:1-17, it is not \nimmediately clear why God would wait several days and \nnine more discourses before giving these tablets to \nMoses.  On the other hand, if we have the Ten Discourses \nwritten on the tablets, then it makes perfect sense that \nGod would not give Moses the tablets until He had \nfinished delivering all Ten Discourses.\n\n5)  When Moses did get the tablets, he found that both \ntablets were written on both sides (Ex. 32:15).  If \nthese Ten "Commandments" were only the first 17 verses \nof Ex. 20, God would have had to have written in LARGE \nletters!  Not that He couldn't have, of course, but it \ndoes seem more likely to me that this is a reference to \ntwo tablets containing ten discourses written in normal-\nsized letters.\n\n6)  In II Cor. 3, Paul seems to specifically single out \nthe "commandments written on stone" as being the \n"ministry of death", "that which is fading away," and \n"the ministry of condemnation."  With the possible \nexception of the commandment about the Sabbath, it is \ndifficult to see why Paul would refer to the commands in \nEx. 20:1-17 as being temporary, "fading away"-type \ncommandments.  This is less of a problem if the stone \ntablets should happen to have included all of the \ncommandments from Ex 20 through Ex 31.\n\nArguments against this idea:\n\nThe main argument against this idea, aside from the fact \nthat it contradicts a long-standing tradition, is that \nin Dt 5:22, Moses says, after quoting the commands in \nEx. 20:1-17, "These words the LORD spoke...and He added \nno more.  And He wrote them on two tablets of stone and \ngave them to me."  This appears to identify the words \njust quoted as being the only contents of the two stone \ntablets.\n\nThat was my first impression, anyway.  However, after \nsome thought, I noted that a great deal hinges on how \nyou understand the phrase "These words."  If Moses meant \n"These words *which I have just related to you* were \nspoken by God" etc., then that would mean that only the \ntraditional "Ten Commandments" were on the stone \ntablets.  If, however, Moses was making a parenthetical \ncomment--"These words *which I AM NOW telling you* were \nspoken by God" etc.--then that's quite different.\n\nI did note that in the Dt 5 account, Moses tells of \nbeing given the stone tablets BEFORE telling of the \npeople asking Moses to represent them before God, \nwhereas in the Exodus account, the people asked this of \nMoses between the first and second discourses, several \ndays BEFORE God gave Moses the stone tablets.  This \nreinforces the idea that Moses' remarks in Dt 5:22ff \nwere intended as a parenthetical remark, rather than a \nstrictly chronological account of when God wrote what, \nand at what point He stopped adding to what was on the \ntablets.\n\nSummary:  all things considered, I find it somewhat more \nlikely that the nine commands in Ex 20 are really only \nthe first of what Moses regarded as the Ten Discourses \nof God.  I don't know if anybody has ever espoused this \nidea before; it's brand-new to me.  So, while I lean \ntowards accepting it, I would be very interested in \nhearing any comments and criticisms anyone may care to \noffer.

You will keep in perfect peace him whose mind is steadfast, because he trusts\nin you. \nIsaiah 26:3
I don't think Joe was saying any such thing.  However, your question\non "asking Jesus to come into your heart" seems to imply that infants\nare not allowed to have Christ in theirs.  Why must Baptism always be\nviewed by some people as a sort of "prodigal son" type of thing; i.e. a\nsudden change of heart, going from not accepting Christ to suddenly\naccepting Christ?  Why can't people start out with Christ from shortly\nafter birth, and build their relationship from there?  After all, does\na man suddenly meet a woman, and then marry her that same day?  From my\nexperiences, I've learned that all relationships must be built,\nincluding one's relationship with God.\n\n   Also Joe is speaking from the standpoint that Baptism is not just a\nritual, but that through it God bestows sacramental grace upon the\nrecipient.  Certainly for those with the mental faculties to know Christ\nit is necessary to believe in Him.  However, the Sacrament itself\nbestows grace on the recipient, and makes a permanent mark of adoption\ninto God's family on the soul.
Early in Church history, the catechumens were dismissed prior to the celebration \nof the Eucharist.  It WAS secret, giving rise to the rumors that Christians\nwere cannibals and all sorts of perverse claims.  The actions were considered\ntoo holy to be observed by non-Christians, as well as potentially dangerous\nfor the individual Christian who might be identified.\n\nLarry Overacker (llo@shell.com)\n--

(I presume you are quoting John 3:3-7.)\n\n1.  My King James Bible says "Except a man be born of water \nand of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God" \n(John 3:5).  (Here "man" == "adult").\n(However, this could be a quibble between translations.)\n\n2.  We can also analyze to whom the Lord is addressing:\n"Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again"\n(John 3:7).  Here Jesus is clearly directing his remarks\nto Nicodemus -- a ruler of the Jews (not a child).\n\n3.  We can ask ourselves why the Lord would even \nintroduce the concept of spiritual re-birth through\nbaptism if newborn babies weren't free from sin?\n\nA IDLER
It's not scriptural, but comes from the patristic age, I think:\nsomething about "amare errantem, interficere errorem", which sounds\nmore like "love the errant, slay the error".  No doubt someone else \nwill know in particular who minted the phrase.  If I had to guess, I'd\nblame :-)  St Augustine, who seems to have had a gift for aphorism.
You should remember that in Adam's transgression, all men and women\nsinned, as Paul wrote.  All of humanity cooperativley reblled against\nGod in Adma's sin, thus, all are subject to it, and the sin is\ntransmitted from generation to generation.
If you were to start your own religion, this would be fine.  But there\nis no scriptural basis for your statement, in fact it really gets to\nthe heart of the problem.  You think you know more than scripture.\nYour faith is driven by feel goodism and not by the Word of God.  Just\nbecause they are nice people doesn't make it right.  You can start all\nthe churches you want and it won't change the fact that it is wrong.\nThat is not to imply that gays don't deserve the same love and\nforgiveness that anyone else does.  But to call their behavior right\njust because they are nice people is baseless, and it offers Satan a\nperfect place to work because there is no check on what he is doing.
Thanks for the letter, your comments helped some.\n\nAs to the last comment, I certainly realize that it was not intended to\nsound that way.  I am still trying to understand *how* a spiritual being\ncolud truly be one and three at the same time.  All of the descriptions\nof this are either Platonic or sound like special pleading (sort of,\n"they appear to be three seperate beings in all ways, but really they are\none, trust me").\n\nNeither of these is acceptible to me.\n\nThe fact is, so far the only descriptions of the trinity that makes any\n*sense* to me are the modalistic ones, such as Modalistic Monarchianism\nor "Economic Trinitarianism".  [I can accept that the three aspects are\nintrinsic to the nature of God, so I perhaps lean more towards the latter].\n\nI am trying, here, to see if anybody can come up with another description\nthat is both orthodox and believable.\n\n-- \nsarima@teradata.com			(formerly tdatirv!sarima)\n  or\nStanley.Friesen@ElSegundoCA.ncr.com
OFM Comments:\n\n\nNo disagreement at all that there is a VERY serious struggle going on.\nBut Jesus more typically uses consequences as a threat.  That's quite\ndifferent from Hell Classic (TM). :-) Jesus doesn't sound like the\nusual hell-fire type of preacher.  He attracts people through what he\ndoes. And the stongest example in Jesus preaching is in the parable of \nLazarus and Dives, which is a parable!  In any case, my point is that\na fear-based response to Christ is not a freeing, life-affirming choice\nand isn't Good News in a meaningful sense.  There are plenty of good \nreasons to follow Jesus that have nothing to do with fear or a literal \nhell, that still pertain to overcoming in the present struggle between \nGod and the Disloyal Opposition.  A faith based in fear is not built\non Rock, as we should found our faith, but on ice.  If the fear were\nremoved, there would BE no foundation.  \n\nThat's basically why it matters to me.  I think we have many Christians \nthat DON'T have a solid basis for relating to the living Incarnate God.\nI cannot be fully open to the working of God in and through my life if\nmy response to God is motivated on fear.  \n\nLarry Overacker (llo@shell.com)\n\n--
Arthur Clarke may have quoted the comment about knowing you're to be\nhanged in the morning concentrating a man's mind wonderfully, but the\nsource of the comment is Samuel Johnson.\n\n(Pardon me if you already knew that.)
Like we have never heard of, or read these verses before?\n\nHow about you read them in context, taking into consideration the times and \nplaces in which they were written; the local customs and pagan rituals; \nwhat the surrounding verses are talking about and how they interact with \nthe rest of the Bible.\n\nThere are many issues in the Bible that are argued, and can be argued \nsuccessfullly from both sides of an issue.  Some examples that come to mind\nare \n		Gifts of the Spirit\n		when the Rapture will occur(pre or post tribulation)\n		how people should be baptized\nto name a few.\n\nI have found nothing in scripture that condemns me, or anyone else, for having\na monogamous relationship with the person whom I love, even if we are the\nsame sex.\n\nI'm sorry if I am coming across as heated.  It's just that the Lord has been\nso dear to me the last several years and I'm tired of hearing this same old\nthing from people who believe what their told rather than finding out for \nthemselves.\n\nCheck it out for yourself.  Invite the Holy Spirit to guide you.  If I weren't\nconfident of this I wouldn't invite you to do this.
Note:  the following article is submitted on behalf of someone (Frank \ndaniels) who has difficulty posting to s.r.c, email replies to \ndaniels@math.ufl.edu\n\n	I am unable to post to the bitnet groups.\n	Here is a capsule history of the Shepherding/Discipleship Movement in\nthe Churches of Christ (i.e. Crossroads/Boston):\n\n	I could trace the Movement back as far as 1800, and indeed some of its\nroots go back that far, but these were really "influences" on the Movement,\nand not the actual movement, per se.\n	I will start in c.1920.\n	In that day, there were 'white' churches and 'colored' churches in\nnearly every area (due to segregation).  Modern Pentecostalism was developing\nas a predominantly 'colored' phenomenon.  Here, there was great fanaticism,\nemphasis on emotional experiences, and belief in a personal guidance and\nindwelling of the Holy Spirit.\n	Many 'white' Protestant churches were growing into what became known\nas conservative fundamentalism.  By the 1940s, the evangelical movement was\nin full swing, and many groups were becoming part of it.\n	When the civil rights movement grew stronger (in the 1950's and \n1960's),\nmany 'white' church groups began to be influenced by the 'black' churches and\nby what was going on there.  This spread started in the most liberal of groups\nand spread to the more conservative ones by the late '60's.  In 1969, even the\nCatholic Church was displaying evidence of influence by the other \ngroups...still\nevident today.\n\n	The Churches of Christ are (and were) a very conservative Protestant\ngroup.  When the influence from outside began to reach the CofC in c.1965, it\nwas generally not appreciated.  Conservative groups are very strongly \nresistant\nto change, and the new movement was VERY different from the CofC status quo.\n	The magazines put out at that time by CofC folks tell the story as it\nunfolds.  New ideas came into the CofC.  There was a big push to reach out to\ncollege students, young adults, and teens.  Some called this the Campus \nEvangel-\nism Movement.  Emotions, generally not highly regarded in the CofC at large,\nplayed a more important role in the new movement.  In some places, people \nbegan\nto speak in tongues (as their Pentecostal predecessors did).\n	This was met with extreme criticism from within the Churches of \nChrist.\nIn some places, people were fired from their jobs for speaking in tongues or \nfor\nadvocating the "Holy Spirit Movement", another name for the new branch.  The\nterm "Underground Church of Christ" also came into use because these people \nhad\nto hide their differences (or they might be ostricised).\n	There were several congregations, however, whose leaderships were\nreceptive to the new ideas (at least in part; the tongues-speaking never \nreally\ncaught on).  One of these was the 14th Street Church of Christ in Gainesville,\nFL.  Campus Ministry had already been regarded as important at 14th Street, \nand\nthe new ideas seemed to be very helpful tools for evangelism.  They also \nseemed\nto put vitality into the church, which many felt had been lacking.\n	In October of 1967, the 14th Street congregation hired Chuck Lucas to\nbe its Campus Minister.  By 1970, he would move to being the congregation's\n(lead) Minister.  In the late 60's/early 70's, the congregation worked with \nmany\nother groups.  They held Bible discussions at Daytona Beach during Spring \nBreak.\nThey organized talks in the fraternities on the University of Florida campus.\nThey also worked with UF sports people.\n	In 1972, the congregation ordered a larger building to be constructed.\nWhen it was finished, the group moved and changed its name (now no longer\nappropriate).  It became the Crossroads Church of Christ from then on, a name\nthat would become legendary.\n\n	By this time, Crossroads was basically the only CofC whose programs\nwere fully aligned to the new movement.  While they didn't start it, they \ncontinued it and were responsible for where it wound up going.\n	By 1975, none of the other Churches of Christ in the area felt that\nthey could cooperate with Crossroads, due to what they recognized as doctrinal\nproblems at Crossroads.\n	Crossroads had begun to heavily emphasize, and later require \nattendance\nat all church functions.  It was seen as a good thing for each member to have\nat least one close relationship, a person with whom you would share all of\nyour problems, pray, and get help from.  The concept was called Prayer \nPartners,\nwhich later became Discipleship Partners and also later became mandatory.  The\nleadership was assigning prayer partners to people for a while.\n	The book called "The Master Plan of Evangelism" was a strong influence\non Chuck Lucas.  He (and the group) believed that it was every person's duty\nand life purpose to carry out the great commission.  Crossroads was growing\nin number, and numbers became VERY important (some would say all-important).\n	A person who "was evangelistic" was "spiritual".  Evangelism meant\ninviting people to Crossroads events; if you did this a lot and some of them\nconverted, then you were "spiritual".  There were sermons about how if you\nbought groceries, the cashier and bag boy ought to receive invitations to\nservices.  Everyone at your job ought to receive invitations.  Since these\npeople needed Jesus, you should be "aggressive"--don't take 'no' for an\nanswer.\n	If you did not evangelize enough, you came to be called "lazy" or\n"unspiritual".\n	By the end of the decade, the Prayer Partner system was integrated \ninto\na structure.  The Elders and Ministers were on top (like a big pyramid).  Then\nthe group leaders, Bible study leaders, and members.  Everyone who came in had\nsomeone placed over them.\n	It is at this time, 1978-1980, that the bad press about Crossroads\nbegan to circulate.  The problem with rape on the University of Florida campus\nwas tremendous, but Crossroads was considered a bigger and more immediate\nproblem.  There were many complaints about the congregation and its "pushy"\nevangelistic tactics.  Crossroads was considering the other Churches of Christ\nto be "dead" churches, which aggravated them; it was aggressively recruiting\nout of the other church groups (denominations), which aggravated THEM.\n\n	By this time, Crossroads had grown numerically to the point (1100)\nwhere not only did they believe that they would soon need a new building, but\nalso they were sending out "planting" [create a new church] and \n"reconstructing"\n[reorganize an existing church] teams to other cities.  By this time, the\nCrossroads Movement was underway.\n	A group was sent to the 30-member Lexington Church of Christ in \nBoston,\nMA.  The team was headed up by Kip McKean, who had been converted out of a\nfraternity by Crossroads (in Gainesville).  Kip held a still stronger view of\nchurch authority, which he believed was heavily vested in the Evangelist(s),\nand not so much in the Elders.  He had been fired in 1977 from the \ncongregation\nthat he had been working at when the elders there found numerous things wrong\nwith his theology, including the practice of what came to be called one-over-\none\nChristianity.  [Called this by critics]\n	In the first year, half of the 30 people felt that they did not want \nto\nbe a part of the new congregation.  They left.  But others began coming into\nthe new Boston Church of Christ.\n	Ah, but I'm ahead of myself.\n	At Crossroads, the heavy-handed system had begun to take its toll on\nthe members.  Many have said that they felt that they were working hard, but\nthey were not achieving the results that were so important.  The numbers were\ndropping.  From 1978, Crossroads membership declined steadily.  The leadership\nbegan to tighten the reigns on the congregation, who was seen as being largely\n"unproductive" and "unfruitful".  The "fruit" passages in the NT were \ninterpreted\nas referring to new converts.  If you were not bearing fruit, said John 15, \nyou\nwould be cast into the fire!  [Boston still teaches this.]\n	If you love your neighbor, you'll save his soul (invite him to church\nand convert him).  If you're not doing that, you don't love your neighbor.\nAnd if you don't love, you're in danger of backsliding.  The logical arguments\ncontinue in this vein.\n	In 1985, Chuck Lucas was fired from his job as minister, due to \nrecurring\nsins in his life.  These struggles were never revealed to the congregation at\nlarge, although many people outside the congregation had heard about them.  \nFor\nby now, there was very little contact (on a friendship level) between most\nCrossroads members and those outside.  [If you have contact, your focus should\nbe on converting them.  Bring them to a Bible Study.]\n	Chuck's replacement was Joe Woods, who was fully supportive of the\nBoston system.  As Boston grew in number, they began to offer 'training' \nsessions\nfor other ministers.  Joe went to Boston to be trained and returned to Cross-\nroads ready to emphasize the "total commitment" to the church that Boston and\nKip McKean were now emphasizing.  Eventually, in Fall of 1987, the Elders at \nCrossroads (now 2 in number--Dick Whitehead and Bill Hogle) made a decision.\nBoston was demanding that all of the other churches in the movement come under\nthe direction of the church in Boston.  The Elders refused, citing their \nbelief\nthat each church should be autonomous (something true in all non-Boston \nChurches\nof Christ).  Perhaps there was also some degree of offense done here, since\nCrossroads was no longer the 'example' to the rest of the Movement.  The group\nnow numbered about 800, while Boston was now larger (in membership).\n	The Churches of Christ generally teach that baptism is a necessary\nelement of salvation.  At Crossroads, they taught what was called 'Lordship'\nbaptism:  you had to understand the commitment involved before you could be\nbaptized.  You had to 'count the cost'.  At Boston, they took this a step\nfurther.  If at some time you became "unproductive", then your spirituality\nwas suspect.  People would begin to ask you if you REALLY understood what you\nwere getting into.  Anyone who said 'no' had their baptism deemed invalid:  \nthey\nhadn't counted the cost properly.  They still had to be baptized.  Others \ncalled\nthis "rebaptism", and Crossroads didn't approve of this practice.\n	When Crossroads announced that it would not follow Boston, many of its\nmembers left Crossroads and went to Movement-related ministries, which were\nnow called Discipling Ministries.  You were either discipling (evangelizing) \nor\nyou were "dead".  They also used the nickname "Movement of God" for a while.\n	By Summer of 1988, Crossroads was withdrawn from the Movement and now\nstood alone.  They had few to no allies in the mainstream Churches of Christ,\nand now none in the Movement.\n\n	Boston, however, continued to chart its course in the direction that\nthey had been following.  They sent "reconstruction teams" to many cities, \nwhich\nusually meant that they split the church there.  They stopped acknowledging \nother\nchurches of Christ as Christians and began to call themselves the "remnant".\nThe "remnant" of the Jews in the OT are those who are saved by God.  It was\nfelt that the "remnant" today represents all the Christians.  Sometimes they\nwould simply call their Movement "the church".\n	They usually took the name of the city for their name, implying to the\nother Churches of Christ that Boston did not recognize their existence.  Many\ncampuses have now formally forbidden Boston ministries from recruiting there\ndue to the number of complaints.  In some cases, it has been documented that\nBoston ministries have lied to University officials in order to continue to \nhave\naccess to the campus.  Any resistance that they experience is termed "perse-\ncution", which all true Christians are expected to experience.  Are you really\na Christian if you're not being persecuted?\n	The numbers at Boston peaked at c.3000 in 1989.  Since then, they have\nfought to remain steady.  I have heard a tape of Kip McKean shouting at the\nleaders for failing to fulfill the Great Commission (their life's purpose) as\nGod commanded them.  Their Christianity is highly centered on commands and\nobedience.\n\n	Crossroads once was called a cult.  Boston is now recognized by the\nCult Awareness Network and other national and international groups as a cult,\nunder a formal definition, because of the techniques which they employ.  The\nterm "cult" is usually differentiated from "sect" by the practice of those\ntechniques.  The techniques which they employ are recognized by many as being\ntechniques of destructive pursuasion, also used by other Shepherding\nDiscipleship groups.  [Robert Jay Lifton, Margaret Thaler Singer, and many\nothers have written about the topic.]  These techniques include guilt \nmotivation,\nemotional manipulation, loaded language, the aura of sacred science (a sort\nof mystic element seen in everyday events), and others.\n\n	I have no particular axe to grind against the Movement.  I have numer-\nous friends who are still part of the Movement.  I have never had a 'falling\nout' with anyone in the Movement.  I disagree with many things which they \nteach.\nI recognize the psychological damage done by being involved in such a system.\nI hold no loyalty to the mainstream Churches of Christ and do not defend their\nmistakes either.\n	I want to point out, though, that unlike in many other systems which\nare in other ways similar, the Leadership of the Boston Movement are as much\nvictims of the system as the members.  We do not have a leader who enjoys\nmanipulating his people.  The leaders believe what they teach, and they feel\naccountable for the activites (and spiritual welfare) of the members.  When\nmembers do not evangelize to their expectations, for example, the leaders feel\npersonally responsible as well.  The leaders are not out for money or power.\nThey want to evangelize the world in their lifetime.\n\n	I have said too much, but there is much more to say.  There are many\nexamples I could give and quotes from other sources (including Boston \nbulletins)\nthat I could include.  But this is too long already.  You may post this if\nyou so desire.\n						Frank D.
Does anyone belong to or know any facts about the\n              Christian Reformed Church?
[a lot of stuff deleted -- i'm focusing on just one point]\n\ni'm a little confused about the difference between this "weak atheism",\nas you put it, and agnosticism.  is agnosticism not believing or\nnecessarily disbelieving in anything, or what is it?  i used to be\nagnostic (by this definition) -- but if weak atheism includes not\nnecessarily believing in God, then i guess i was one of those.  ???\n\nactually what i have a hard time understanding is people who do not\never decide what they believe.  i am constantly in a state of\nself-examination, as it would appear many others are as well (including the\natheists, of course -- i'd assume that's why they're here!).  i guess\nsome people don't really consider it important to think about the\nanswers to "life, the universe and everything" -- any comment?  just\nwondering....\n\n\ntough call, as these things seem to be based on faith -- wish i could\nhelp you, but i already tried once with someone who was a\nself-professed agnostic-thinking-of-becoming-a -christian, and it\ndidn't work too well!  especially tough as i'm still mulling over\nwhether or not i believe in miracles (looks like another email to my\nchaplain is coming up....).  all i can do is wish you the best of\nluck, and please do post what you find.\n\n\nhmm, how so?  i guess i really don't understand.  there are times, of\ncourse, when i say to myself "of course i have absolutely no way of\nknowing that what i believe in is true except the satisfaction and\nsense of peace i get from it -- which of course could just be\npsychological".  somehow i live with this anyway -- is this what you\nmean?\n\nthe only "proof" i have is that i believe God spoke to me once --\nwhich could of course be my own imagination.  the odd thing is,\nthough, that if you don't at some point start believing in something,\nafter a while it all gets sort of ridiculous.  maybe it's just a\nquestion of where you draw the line.\n\n\ni'll only add one question -- have you read pascal?  what did you\nthink of him if you did?\n\nalso you may (or may not) be interested by cslewis/ _surprised by\njoy_.  i'd be interested in knowing what you think of him, no sarcasm\nat all intended.  (i just say this because one can never know how\none's written words will be interpreted.  i am not interested in\nconverting you, since i don't seem to have whatever it would take --\nproof -- to do so.  i'm just interested in learning.)\n\n\ni like this.
Often times (most recently on this list in the last few days) I've\nheard the passage from revelation:\n\n	"...whoever adds to the sacred words of this book...whoever removes\n	 words from this book..."    \n\n	 used as an arguement against the deutercanonical books.\n\n	 I feel this is ridiculous for two reasons:\n\n	 1.  They weren't added later by the Catholic Church; they were\n		*always* part of what was considered inspired scripture.\n		(This has been dealt with in previous postings...no reason\n		to repeat the info.)\n\n	2.  It is more likely than not that when St. John (or whomever) wrote\n		the book of Revelation WHAT WAS THEN CONSIDERED SCRIPTURE was\n		** NOT ** the same thing you and I are holding in our hands!\n\n	If one takes the translation of "this book" in REV 18:22 (or somewhere\n	around there) to mean "all of scripture", then all of us are likely\n	holding something that is in violation of this command.\n\n	It is impossible to exactly date the scriptures, even the N.T. ones\n	(they didn't like to date their letters, I guess).  I really wish I\n	had my bible with me right now to get the facts straight, but I believe\n	that several of the N.T. letters, chief among them 2 Peter, have their\n	most likely date of composition in the early second century A.D.\n		Revelation was almost certainly written durin the reign of \n	Domition (sp?), A.D. 80-96.  Thus it could be argues that we are all\n	in sin if we accept 2 Peter as scripture, since it was "added" to the\n	book after the composition of Revelation, when we are told to add \n	nothing more.
The belief that the churches of Egypt and Syria were (or are) monophysite is \nfalse, as is the belief that they often held that the Council of Chalcedon \nwas Nestorian.\n\nThese misunderstandings were exacerbated by political factors, and thus led \nto schism - a schism that is on its way to being healed.
The dogma of the Assumption does not state whether or not Mary died a\nphysical death before being taken into Heaven.  Catholics are free to\nbelieve what they wish, whether it be that she was taken still alive, or\nafter having died.  I lean somewhat toward the latter myself.
: When Elizabeth greeted Mary, Elizabeth said something to the effect that\n: Mary, out of all women, was blessed.  If so, it appears that this\n: exactly places Mary beyond the sanctification of normal humanity.\n\nThe phrase is "eulogemene su en gunaixin"- "blessed are you among women."\nThere is nothing to indicate that this is an exceptional or unique status,\nonly that _as a woman_ Mary was blessed.  Adding the word "all" is not\na fair reading of the text.  There are some good reasons for the church's\nveneration of Mary, but they cannot depend on this verse.
In a post of 29 April (?), considering disasters as instances of the\njudgements of God in history, Andy Byler spoke of\n\n > the desire of the Jerusalem mob who crucified the Lord that\n > "His blood be upon us."\n\nVera Noyes replied (02 May),\n\n > I will not comment here for fear of being heavily flamed.\n\nI invite them both (and other interested parties as well) to read my\ncomments on this verse of Scripture. To obtain them, send the\nmessage GET CHOOSING BARABBAS to LISTSERV@ASUACAD.BITNET or to\nLISTSERV@ASUVM.INRE.ASU.EDU. Putting it briefly, I think that the\nsignificance of the demands of the Jerusalem crowd has usually been\ngreatly misunderstood, both by Christian and by anti-Christian\nreaders.\n\n Yours,\n James Kiefer
Welcome.\n\n\nHm. I get a little queasy around the phrase "aren't morally \nresponsible", perhaps because I've heard it misused so many times.\n(I remember in college some folk trying to argue that a person who\nwas drunk was not morally responsible for his actions.) In general,\nmost folk can't control their dreams, but perhaps what you do all day\nand think about has some impact on them, hm? And I'm not sure what\n"actions" are in a dream. But I will note that Jesus does seem adamant\nabout the fact that our thought-life is at least as important as\nour actions. Go lightly with this argument - we are all morally\nresponsible for *who we are* and dreams might well be an important\npart of that.\n\nI don't know a thing about Out Of Body Experiences. I've had dreams, some\nfairly vivid ones; is an OOBE just a very vivid dream? I would argue that\nextreme interest in this sort of phenomena is a tad risky; it is probably\nmuch better to think about who Jesus is, and who we are in relation to that,\nthan to cultivate a strong interest in dreams. Unless you feel plagued by\ndreams that are painful and out of control; then pray about it and/or get help.\n\nWhat on Earth is your definition of "often"? I know exactly one case of\ntwo people who had substantially the same dream at the same time, and\nas they were brothers who had spent the day doing the same things I could\nsee why their dreams might be similiar. Anyway, the only "other plane" I\nknow of is the spiritual realm. I don't think *anyone's* dreams,\nperhaps outside the occasional prophet's, represent actual actions on an\nalternate plane. If they were real actions, or conscious thoughts, then\nyes they would have direct moral significance.\n\nin a different environment, then different moral laws apply" is my guess of\nwhat you said.]\nI don't see the slightest hint in Christian writings that ones "environment"\nchanges the way a person determines what is moral. For a Christian won't\nit *always* come down to "what Jesus would have us do?"\n\nTruth? I don't claim to be an expert in dreams. I'll note that the Bible\ndoesn't talk much about dreams outside of the realm of God using them to speak\nto us, with the caveat that such messages are not always very clear, as it\nwarns somewhere in the OT. Given that, I would not give them a lot of\nattention unless you feel your dreams are trying to tell you something.

Someone referred to my FAQ essay on homosexuality.  Since it hasn't\nbeen posted for some time (and I've modified it somewhat since the\nlast time), I'm taking this opportunity to post it.  There is another\nentry in the FAQ containing comments by some other contributors.  They\ncan be retrieved from ftp.rutgers.edu as\npub/soc.religion.christian/others/homosexuality.  It contains far\nmore detail on the exegetical issues than I give here, though\nprimarily from a conservative point of view.\n\n----------------------------\n\nThis posting summarizes several issues involving homosexuality and\nChristians.  This is a frequently asked question, so I do not post the\nquestion each time it occurs.  Rather this is an attempt to summarize\nthe postings we get when we have a discussion.  It summarizes\narguments for allowing Christian homosexuality, since most people\nasking the question already know the arguments against it.  The most\ncommon -- but not the only -- question dealt with herein is "how can a\nChristian justify being a homosexual, given what the Bible says about\nit?"\n\nFirst, on the definition of 'homosexual'.  Many groups believe that\nthere is a homosexual "orientation", i.e. a sexual attraction to\nmembers of the same sex.  This is distinguished from actual homosexual\nsexual activity.  Homosexuals who abstain from sex are considered by\nmost groups to be acceptable.  However in a lot of discussion, the\nterm 'homosexual' means someone actually engaging in homosexual sex.\nThis is generally not accepted outside the most 'liberal' groups.  In\nthis paper I'm going to use 'homosexual' as meaning a person engaging\nin sexual acts with another of the same sex.  I haven't heard of any\nBiblical argument against a person with homosexual orientation who\nremains celebate.\n\nI think most people now admit that there is a predisposition to be\nhomosexual.  This is often called a 'homosexual orientation'.  It is\nnot known whether it is genetic or environmental.  There is evidence\nsuggesting each.  The best evidence I've seen is that homosexuality is\nnot a single phenomenon, but has a number of different causes.  One of\nthem is probably genetic.  There are several groups that try to help\npeople move from being homosexual to heterosexual.  The best-known is\nExodus International".  The reports I've seen (and I haven't read the\ndetailed literature, just the summary in the minority opinion to the\nPresbyterian Church's infamous report on human sexuality) suggest that\nthese programs have very low success rates, and that there are\nquestions about how real even the successes are.  But there certainly\nare people who say they have converted.  However this issue is not as\nimportant as it sounds.  Those who believe homosexuality is wrong\nbelieve it is intrinsically wrong, defined as such by God.  The fact\nthat it's hard to get out of being a homosexual is no more relevant\nthan the fact that it's hard to escape from being a drug addict.  If\nit's wrong, it's wrong.  It may affect how we deal with people though.\nIf it's very difficult to change, this may tend to make us more\nwilling to forgive it.\n\nOne more general background issue: It's common to quote a figure that\n10% of the population is homosexual.  I asked one of our experts where\nthis came from.  Here's his response: Kinsey (see below) is the source\nof the figure 10 percent.  He defines sexuality by behavior, not by\norientation, and ranked all persons on a scale from Zero (completely\nheterosexual) to 6 (completely heterosexual).  According to Kinsey,\none-third of all male adults have had at least one experience of\norgasm homosexually post puberty.  Ten percent of all adult males have\nmost of their experiences of homosexually.  That was in 1948.  The\npercentages held true in a followup study done by the Kinsey\nInstitute, based on data in the early seventies but not published\nuntil the early 80s or so, by Bell and Weinberg, I believe.  I can't\nput my hand on this latter reference, but here is the online\ninformation for Kinsey's own study as it appears in IRIS, the catalog\nat Rutgers:\n   AUTHOR Kinsey, Alfred Charles, 1894-1956.\n    TITLE Sexual behavior in the human male [by] Alfred C.

(Feb. 24, 1992).  A\njournalist is running the rounds of talk shows this season promoting\nher book that allegedly refutes Kinsey's study, but the scholarly\nworld seems to take her for a kook......\n\nI've seen some objections to the Kinsey's study, but not in enough\ndetail to include here.  (If someone would like to contribute another\nview, I'd be willing to include it.)\n\nMost Christians believe homosexuality (at least genital sex) is wrong.\nNot all, however.  A few denominations accept it.  The Metropolitan\nCommunity Churches is the best-known -- it was formed specifically to\naccept homosexuals.  However the United Church of Christ also allows\nit, and I think a couple of other groups may as well.  The Episcopal\nChurch seems to accept it some areas but not others.  In churches that\nhave congregational government, you'll find a few congregations that\naccept it (even among Southern Baptists, though the number is probably\nonly one or two congregations).  But these are unusual -- few churches\npermit homosexual church leaders.  How carefully they enforce this is\nanother issue.  I don't have any doubt that there are homosexual\npastors of just about every denomination, some more open than others.\n\nAs to the arguments over the Biblical and other issues, here's an\nattempt to summarize the issues:\n\nThe most commonly cited reference by those favoring acceptance of\nhomosexuality in previous discussions has been John Boswell:\n"Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality", U Chicago Press,\n1980.\n\nThe argument against is pretty clear.  There are several explicit laws\nin the OT, e.g. Leviticus 20:13, and in Rom 1 Paul seems pretty negative on\nhomosexuality.  Beyond these references, there are some debates.  Some\npassages often cited on the subject probably are not relevant.  E.g.\nthe sin which the inhabitants of Sodom proposed to carry out was\nhomosexual *rape*, not homosexual activity between consenting adults.\n(There's even some question whether it was homosexual, since the\nentities involved were angels.)  It was particularly horrifying\nbecause it involved guests, and the responsibility towards guests in\nthat culture was very strong.  (This is probably the reason Lot\noffered his daughter -- it was better to give up his daughter than to\nallow his guests to be attacked.)  If you look through a concordance\nfor references to Sodom elsewhere in the Bible, you'll see that few\nseem to imply that homosexuality was their sin.  There's a Jewish\ninterpretive tradition that the major sin was abuse of guests.  At any\nrate, there's no debate that homosexual *rape* is wrong.\n\nI do not discuss Leviticus because the law there is part of a set\nof laws that most Christians do not consider binding.  So unless NT\njustification can be found, Lev. alone would not settle the issue.\n\nThe NT references are all in Paul's letters.  A number of the\nreferences from Paul are lists of sins in which the words are fairly\nvague.  Boswell argues that the words occuring in these lists do not\nin the lists (i.e. I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10) are /malakos/ and\n/arsenokoitai/.  Unfortunately it is not entirely clear what the words\nactually mean.  /malakos/, with a basic meaning of soft, has a variety\nof metaphorical meanings in ethical writing.  Boswell suggests\n"wanton" as a likely equivalent.  He also reports that the unanimous\ninterpretation of the Church, including Greek-speaking Christians, was\nthat in this passage it referred to masturbation, a meaning that has\nvanished only in the 20th Cent., as that practice has come to be less\nfrowned-upon.  (He cites references as late as the 1967 edition of the\nCatholic Encyclopedia that identify it as masturbation.)  He\ntranslates /arsenokotai/ as male prostitute, giving evidence that none\nof the church fathers understood the term as referring to\nhomosexuality in general.  A more technical meaning, suggested by the\nearly Latin translations, would be "active mode homosexual male\nprostitute", but in his view Paul did not intend it so technically.\n\nFor a more conservative view, I consulted Gordon Fee's commentary on I\nCor.  He cites evidence that /malakos/ often meant effeminate.\nHowever Boswell warns us that in Greek culture effeminate is not\nnecessarily synonymous with homosexual, though it may be associated\nwith some kinds of homosexual behavior.  Given what Boswell and Fee\nsay taken together, I suspect that the term is simply not very\ndefinite, and that while it applies to homosexuals in some cases, it\nisn't a general term for homosexuality.  While Fee argues against\nBoswell with /arsenokotai/ as well, he ends up suggesting a\ntranslation that seems essentially the same.  The big problem with it\nis that the word is almost never used.  Paul's writing is the first\noccurence.  The fact that the word is clearly composed of "male" and\n"f**k" unfortunately doesn't quite tell us the meaning, since it\ndoesn't tell us whether the male is the subject or object of the\naction.  Examples of compound words formed either way can be given.\nIn theory it could refer to rapists, etc.  It's dangerous to base\nmeaning purely on etymology, or you'll conclude that "goodbye" is a\nreligious expression because it's based on "God by with ye".  However\nsince Boswell, Fee, and NIV seem to agree on "homosexual male\nprostitute", that seems as good a guess as any.  Note that this\ntranslation misses the strong vulgarity of the term however (something\nwhich Fee and Boswell agree on, but do not attempt to reproduce in\ntheir translation).\n\nIn my opinion, the strongest NT reference to homosexuality is Romans\n1.  Boswell points out that Rom 1 speaks of homosexuality as something\nthat happened to people who were naturally heterosexual, as a result\nof their corruption due to worshipping false gods.  One could argue\nthat this is simply an example: that if a homosexual worshipped false\ngods, he would also fall into degradation and perhaps become\nheterosexual.  However I find this argument somewhat forced, and in\nfact our homosexual readers have not seriously proposed that this is\nwhat Paul meant.\n\nHowever I am not convinced that Rom 1 is sufficient to create a law\nagainst homosexuality for Christians.  What Paul is describing in Rom\n1 is not homosexuality among Christians -- it's homosexuality that\nappeared among idolaters as one part of a whole package of wickedness.\nDespite the impression left by his impassioned rhetoric, I'm sure Paul\ndoes not believe that pagans completely abandoned heterosexual sex.\nGiven his description of their situation, I rather assume that their\nheterosexual sex would also be debased and shameless.  So yes, I do\nbelieve that this passage indicates a negative view of homosexuality.\nBut in all fairness, the "shameless" nature of their acts is a\nreflection of the general spiritual state of the people, and not a\nspecific feature of homosexuality.\n\nMy overall view of the situation is the following: I think we have\nenough evidence to be confident that Paul disapproved of\nhomosexuality.  Rom 1 seems clear.  While I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 are\nnot unambiguous and general condemnations of homosexuality, they do\nnot seem like wording that would come from someone who approved of\nhomosexuality or even considered it acceptable in some cases.  On the\nother hand, none of these passages contains explicit teachings on the\nsubject.  Rom 1 is really about idolatry.  It refers to homosexuality\nin passing.\n\nThe result of this situation is that people interpret these passages\nin light of their general approach to Scripture.  For those who look\nto Scripture for laws about issues such as this, it not surprising\nthat they would consider these passages to be NT endorsement of the OT\nprohibition.  For those whose approach to the Bible is more liberal,\nit is not surprising that they regard Paul's negative view of\nhomosexuality as something that he took from his Jewish upbringing\nwithout any serious reexamination in the light of the Gospel.  As\nreaders of this group know by now, the assumptions behind these\napproaches are so radically different that people tend to foam at the\nmouth when they see the opposing view described.  There's not a lot I\ncan do as moderator about such a situation.\n\nA number of discussions in the past centered around the sort of\ndetailed exegesis of texts that is described above.  However in fact\nI'm not convinced that defenders of homosexuality actually base their\nown beliefs on such analyses.  The real issue seems to rest on the\nquestion of whether Paul's judgement should apply to modern\nhomosexuality.\n\nOne commonly made claim is that Paul had simply never faced the kinds\nof questions we are trying to deal with.  He encountered homosexuality\nonly in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was\nwrong.  He had never faced the experience of Christians who try to act\n"straight" and fail, and he had never faced Christians who are trying\nto define a Christian homosexuality, which fits with general Christian\nideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the\nrelationship between God and man.  It is unfair to take Paul's\njudgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make\njudgements on these questions.\n\nAnother is the following: In Paul's time homosexuality was associated\nwith a number of things that Christians would not find acceptable.  It\nwas part of temple prostitution.  Among private citizens, it often\noccured between adults and children or free people and slaves.  I'm\nnot in a position to say that it always did, but there are some\nreasons to think so.  The ancients distinguished between the active\nand passive partner.  It was considered disgraceful for a free adult\nto act as the passive partner.  (This is the reason that an active\nmode homosexual prostitute would be considered disgraceful.  His\ncustomers would all be people who enjoyed the passive role.)  This\nsupports the idea that it would tend not to be engaged in between two\nfree adult males, at least not without some degree of scandal.\nClearly Christian homosexuals would not condone sex with children,\nslaves, or others who are not in a position to be fully responsible\npartners.  (However Fee's commentary on I Cor cites some examples from\nancient literature of homosexual relationships that do seem to involve\nfree adults in a reasonably symmetrical way.  Thus the considerations\nin this paragraph shouldn't be pushed too far.  Homosexuality may have\nbeen discredited for Jews by some of these associations, but there\nsurely must be been cases that were not prostitutes and did not\ninvolve slaves or children.)\n\nSome people have argued that AIDS is a judgement against\nhomosexuality.  I'd like to point out that AIDS is transmitted by\npromiscuous sex, both homosexual and heterosexual.  Someone who has a\nhomosexual relationship that meets Christian criteria for marriage is\nnot at risk for AIDS.\n\nNote that there is good reason from Paul's general approach to doubt\nthat he would concede homosexuality as a fully equal alternative,\napart from any specific statements on homosexuality.  I believe his\nuse of the Genesis story would lead him to regard heterosexual\nmarriage as what God ordained.\n\nHowever the way Paul deals with pastoral questions provides a warning\nagainst being too quick to deal with this issue legally.\n\nI claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual Christians is\nnot entirely a theological issue, but also a pastoral one.  Paul's\ntendency, as we can see in issues such as eating meat and celebrating\nholidays, is to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issues\nto look very carefully at the good of the people involved, and to\navoid insisting on perfection when it would be personally damaging.\nFor example, while Paul clearly believed that it was acceptable to eat\nmeat, he wanted us to avoid pushing people into doing an action about\nwhich they had personal qualms.  For another example, Paul obviously\nwould have preferred to see people (at least in some circumstances)\nremain unmarried.  Yet if they were unable to do so, he certainly\nwould rather see them married than in a state where they might be\ntempted to fornication.\n\nI believe one could take a view like this even while accepting the\nviews Paul expressed in Rom 1.  One may believe that homosexuality is\nnot what God intended, that it occured as a result of sin, but still\nconclude that at times we have to live with it.  Note that in the\ncreation story work enters human life as a result of sin.  This\ndoesn't mean that Christians can stop working when we are saved.  The\nquestion is whether you believe that homosexuality is in itself sinful\nor whether you believe that it's a misfortune that is in a broad sense\ndue to human sinfulness.  If you're willing to consider the latter\napproach, then it becomes a pastoral judgement whether there is more\ndamage caused by finding a way to live with it or trying to cure it.\nThe dangers of trying to cure it are that the attempt most often\nfails, and when it does, you end up with damage ranging from\npsychological damage to suicide, as well as broken marriages when\nattempts at living as a heterosexual fail.\n\nThis is going to depend upon one's assessment of the inherent nature\nof homosexuality.  If you believe it is a very serious wrong, then you\nmay be willing to run high risks of serious damage to get rid of it.\nClearly we do not generally suggest that people live with a tendency\nto steal or with drug addiction, even though attempts to cure these\nconditions are also very difficult.  However these conditions are\nintrinsically damaging in a way that is not so obvious for\nhomosexuality.  (Many problems associated with homosexuality are\nactually problems of promiscuity, not homosexuality.  This includes\nAIDS.  I take for granted that the only sort of homosexual\nrelationships a Christian would consider allowing would be equivalent\nto Christian heterosexual relationships.)\n\nIn the course of discussing this over the last decade or so, we've\nheard a lot of personal testimony from fellow Christians who are in\nthis situation.  I've also seen summaries of various research and the\nresults of various efforts for "conversion".  (Aside from the\nPresbyterian report mentioned above, there's an FAQ that summarizes\nour readers' reports on this question.)  The evidence is that\nlong-term success in changing orientation is rare enough to be on a\npar with healing miracles.  The danger in advising Christians to\ndepend upon such a change is clear: When "conversion" doesn't happen,\nwhich is almost always, the people are often left in despair, feeling\nexcluded from a Church that has nothing more to say but a requirement\nof life-long celibacy.  Paul recognized (though in a different\ncontext) that such a demand is not practical for most people, and I\nthink the history of clerical celibacy has strongly reinforced that\njudgement.  The practical result is that homosexuals end up in the gay\nsex clubs and the rest of the sordid side of homosexuality.  Maybe\nhomosexuality isn't God's original ideal, but I can well imagine Paul\npreferring to see people in long-term, committed Christian\nrelationships than promiscuity.  As with work -- which Genesis\nsuggests wasn't part of God's original ideal either -- I think such\nrelationships can still be a vehicle for people sharing God's love\nwith each other.\n\nThere's an issue of Biblical interpretation underlying this\ndiscussion.  The issue is that of "cultural relativism".  That is,\nwhen Paul says that something is wrong, should this be taken as an\neternal statement, or are things wrong because of specific situations\nin the culture of the time?  Conservative Christians generally insist\non taking prohibitions as absolute, since otherwise the Bible becomes\nsubjective -- what is to stop us from considering everything in it as\nrelative?\n\nWhen looking at this issue, it's worth noting that no one completely\nrejects the concept of cultural relativism.  There are a number of\njudgements in the New Testament that even conservative Christians\nconsider to be relative.  The following judgements are at least as\nclear in the Bible as anything said on homosexuality:\n\n  - prohibition against charging interest (this occurs 18 times in\n	the OT -- it's not in the NT, but I mention it here because\n	until relatively recently the Church did consider it binding\n	on Christians)\n  - prohibition against swearing oaths\n  - endorsement of slavery as an institution\n  - judgement of tax collectors as sinner\n\nWe do not regard these items as binding.  In most cases, I believe the\nargument is essentially one of cultural relativism.  Briefly:\n\n  - prohibition of interest is appropriate to a specific\n	agrarian society that the Bible was trying to build,\n	but not to our market economy.\n  - few people believe that American judicial oaths have the\n	same characteristics as the kind of oaths Jesus was\n	concerned about\n  - most people believe that Paul was simply telling people\n	how to live within slavery, but not endorsing it as\n	an institution\n  - for people believe that the IRS is morally equivalent to\n	Roman tax farming\n\nThe point I'm trying to make is that before applying Biblical\nprohibitions to the 20th Cent., we need to look at whether the 20th\nCent. actions are the same.  When Christian homosexuals say that their\nrelationships are different than the Greek homosexuality that Paul\nwould have been familiar with, this is exactly the same kind of\nargument that is being made about judicial oaths and tax collectors.\nUntil fairly recently Christians prohibited taking of interest, and\nmany Christians regarded slavery as divinely endorsed.  (Indeed,\nslavery is one of the more common metaphors for the relationship\nbetween God and human beings -- Christians are often called servants\nor slaves of God.)\n\nI am not trying to say that everything in the Bible is culturally\nrelative.  Rather, I'm trying to say that *some* things are, and\ntherefore it is not enough to say that because something appears in\nthe Bible, that ends the discussion.  We need to look at whether the\naction we're talking about now has the same moral implications as the\none that the Bible was talking about.  If Christians want to argue\nthat there are reasons to think that the prohibitions against\nhomosexuality are still binding, I'm willing to listen.  Those who\nclaim that the question doesn't need to be looked at are kidding\nthemselves (unless they are part of the small minority who really obey\nall the rules listed above).\n\nOne thing that worries me is the great emotions that this issue\ncreates.  When you consider the weakness of the Biblical evidence --\nsome laws in Leviticus, a passage in Rom whose subject matter is\nreally idolatry rather than homosexuality, and a couple of lists whose\nwords are ambiguous -- the amount of concern this is raising among\nChristians seems rather out of proportion.  This should suggest to\npeople that there are reasons other than simply Biblical involved.\nThis is true on both sides -- clearly homosexual Christians are as\nstrongly motivated to find ways of discrediting the Biblical arguments\nas conservative Christians are to find Biblical arguments.  But I\ncan't help feeling that the Bible is being used by both sides as a way\nof justifying attitudes which come from other sources.  This is a\ndangerous situation for Christians.\n\nOn the other side of the issue, I would like to note some problems I\nhave with the pro-homosexual position as it is commonly presented.\nOne of the most common arguments is that homosexuality is biologically\ndetermined.  I.e. "God made me homosexual", and I have no choice.  I\nthink "God made me homosexual" is a fine view for people who already\nbelieve on other grounds that homosexuality is acceptable.  But I\ndon't see it as an argument for acceptability.
> Public revelation, which is the basis of Catholic doctrine, ended\n > with the death of St John, the last Apostle. Nothing new can be\n > added.\n\nEvery so often, the Pope declares that some departed Christian is\nnow in Heaven, and may be invoked in the public rites of the Church.\nIt is my understanding that Roman Catholics believe that such\ndeclarations by the Pope are infallible. I see three possibilities:\n     1) The Church has received a Public Revelation since the death\nof (for example) Joan of Arc.\n     2) The Church was given a list before the death of St John\nwhich had Joan's name on it.\n     3) There is no public revelation about Joan, and Roman\nCatholics are free to doubt that she died in a state of grace, or\neven that she is a historical character.
No.  It is very relevant.  Homosexual acts and acts of beastiality are\ntopically aranged together in the law.  This is very important.\nAnyone who would want to say that this command against homosexuality\ndeals with temple prostitution (and I think you would agree that there\nis no proof for this.)  If the Law reveals the character of God, and \nis "holy, just, and good" as is written in the New Testament, then\nthose who consider we who are against commiting homosexuals acts\nto be biggots have to address this passage of Scripture.  \n\nWhy must we only discuss Scriptures that involve consensual human\nadult relationships?  Isn't that bordering on sophistry?  The point\nwe are making is that God did not ordain certain kinds of sex acts.\nNot everyone who brings up these Scriptures is just trying to use and emotional\nargument that compares homosexuals to beastophiles and child molestors.\nThe issue we are dealing with is that some sex acts are ungodly.  \n\nI do not have problem with a loving, nonlustful relationship with a member\nof the same sex.  I have them, and we all do.  The issue at hand is \nthe sinfulness having sex with members of the same sex, or lusting after.\nSo other forbidden sex acts are a valid topic for conversation. \n\nAnd the idea that these relationships may be  emotional  relationships\nbetween adult humans is red herring.  We all agree that it is okay \nfor adults to  have caring relationships with one another.
Yes, there are these two senses of interpretation, and certainly our\ndecision to accept Scripture as inspired ultimately rests on our own\nprivate opinion.  However, when reading Scripture, we have to remember\nthat the Scriptures were given by God for our instruction, and that\nthe interpretation that matters is the one God intended.  For example,\nif I decide that the fact that John the Baptist is Elijah teaches the\ndoctrine of reincarnation, I am wrong because that is not the intended\ninterpretation.  The prophets didn't make up this teaching; it came\nfrom God, and we must accept it as such.  This necessarily means that\nour private interpretations must take a back seat to the meaning God\nintended to convey.  Certainly we must rely on our best efforts to\ndetermine what this meaning is, but this very fact should make us\nrecognize that our private interpretations cannot be automatically\naccepted as the infallible interpretation of God.  We need to test the\nspirits to see if they are from God.  When the Holy Spirit speaks, he\nsays the same thing to all; he won't tell me that a passage means one\nthing and tell you it means another.  If the two of us come to\nconflicting conclusions, we can't both be completely right.  We know\nour interpretations are reliable only when the Church as a whole\nagrees on what Scripture means.  This is how we know the doctrines of\nthe Trinity, the dual nature of Christ, etc. infallibly.  These\nmatters are not up for private interpretation.\n\nThis is the reason Peter goes on to talk about the deceptiveness of\nthe false teachers.  They preferred their own private interpretation\nto the God-given teaching of the apostles.  It is through such private\ninterpretation that the traditions of men, so soundly denounced in\nScripture, are started.
ites:\nI realized that my generalizations would probably have problems\nunder scrutiny from various  Asian points of view.  They need to be \ndiscussed in detail, indeed. But for the purposes of this newsgroup \nand thread  thus far and in this newsgroup, I risked oversimpli-\nfication.  My main purpose was to emphasize that I was not coming\nfrom a Buddhist or Hindu point of view.  As you observed, the\nmain context is that of Christianity.  But by all means, add comments\nand corrections as you find them.\n\nI wrote a longer reply addressing some of your points, but decided\nto not post it. Perhaps it would be more appropriate for soc.religion.\neastern. Instead I just add the following couple of items about karma \nand reincarnation as I see the matter from an anthroposophical and \na Christian point of view.\n\n1. Karma is not simple reward and punishment dealt out by a "judging\n   deity".\n\n2. Reincarnation is not the same as being born again.\n\n3. Reincarnation is not the same as the resurrection of the body.\n\n4. Reincarnation and karma do not contradict the fundamental teachings\n   of Christianity about God, the fall, the being. incarnation, death,\n   and resurrection of Christ, his coming again, sin, grace, forgiveness, \n   salvation, and the last judgement.\n\n\nOrigen's work was mostly lost. He was not anathematized, to my knowledge, \nbut his writing comes down largely in fragments and quotations from enemies.\nPerhaps someone else can comment on Origen.  I don't know if there\nis a specific statement about reincarnation from him, but from what I do\nknow about him he probably did hold to the teaching in one form or another.\n\nI don't know too much about the history of the idea of reincarnation in\nthe Church. However, I heard an interesting story about Pope John Paul II\nfrom an astronomer who teaches at the University of Cracow.  The Pope likes\nto go to Poland for a scientific conference every couple of years so he\ncan relax and talk Polish to friends and fellow countrymen.  My acquaintance,\nan anthroposophist, related the fact that Woitila knew about Steiner and\nAnthroposophy from his early days.  Before he became a priest he was an\nactor in a dramatic company in Cracow whose leader was a pupil of Steiner\nand based his acting and directing methods on Steiner's indications.  Part\nof the work was the study of the basic works of anthroposophy.  Well,\ngoing to this conference with him a few years ago, the astronomer and another\nPolish anthroposophist thought they would ask the Pope what he thought about\nAnthroposophy.  They chickened out at the last minute, but one of them did ask\nhim what he thought about reincarnation.  The Pope smiled and said, \n"Actually there have been quite a few good Catholics who believed in \nreincarnation," and he proceeded to name several from the earliest times\nto modern times.  Then he changed the subject. My Polish friend did not\nsay whether Origen was among those he mentioned.\n\nGerry Palo (73237.2006@compuserve.com)

Easy vs. Hard .....Easy on who?\n\nI had a rare very personal talk with my mother last year.  She said\nthat when she and my father were raising we four children, they\ndid not try to raise us in this world as strictly as they were raised\nin their Norwegian Lutheran community. They felt that we would be\nalienated from them and it would create problems.\n  In other words, my parent did the very tolerant, loving thing. They\nraised us without conflict, without what we saw as unreasonable\ndemands and were always accepting, no matter what the circumstances.\n  What happened was that I grew up believing in situation ethics and\nnever absolutes. I believed in a loving God, and my concept of God\nnever involved justice or punishment, nor was there any concept that\nI may someday be held responsible for the things that offended\nHim...sins that the "world" told me were OK.\n  My parents are very good, honest and moral people. They raised\nfour extremely honest children. Yet, before coming to a more\ncomplete knowledge of God (which includes the knowledge of justice\nand punishment)I committed what I now believe to be many, many\ngrave sins. I lived with a partner outside of marriage, was married\nand divorced ( only after physical abuse and no apparent hope for\nchange...but I shouldn't have married to person in the first place )\nand more....\n  My parents felt they were doing the loving,kind thing by allowing\nus to be who we were, by not imposing their standards on us, and by\naccepting unquestioningly everything we did without judgement or\ncounsel.\n  Today, it is absolutely appalling for me to look back on what they\n*did* accept without a word. It takes courages to dare to help souls\nbecause you must speak up and say what is unpopular and\ndifficult and what people do not want to hear. You must be able\nto say what is hard, and say it as Christ would, with love and\ncompassion. It involves risk....perhaps someone you love may not\nwant to hear and will stay away from you.\n  This life is "but dust". As long as the comfort of this life\nis our highest priority, we will fail God and fail those\nwith whom we come in contact.\n  I wonder how many who engage in sex outside of marriage, who\nsupport the "right" to abortion, who engage in homosexuality,\nor who commit any of the range of sins that are plentiful in\nthis time have ever heard from a quiet, thoughtful, loving\nfriend that these things are *wrong*. No one ever told me that\nwhat I was doing was wrong, and I saw multitudes around me\nliving the same way I was and they seemed like good, decent\npeople. (wouldn't kick dogs or beat the elderly or babies..)\nIt is more difficult for sinners without a genuine prayer\nlife to hear the Holy Spirit than it is to hear a loving friend.\nThink about this the next time the Holy Spirit tells you that\na friend is in error, but you don't want to "cause trouble".\nRighteous prayers is great power, but don't forget that we are\nwe are Christ's lips and hands on earth. Don't be afraid to\nsimply voice Truth when the situation calls for it. Say a\nfervent prayer and ask the Holy Spirit for Love and guidance.\nIn more ways than we may realize, we *are* our brother's\nkeeper.

I quote from the journal, "30 Days In the Church and In the World,"\n1992, No. 8/9, p. 29. \n\nRegarding the new draft of the Universal Catechism:\n\n	In procuring the common good of society the need could arise\n	that the aggressor be placed in the position where he cannot\n	cause harm.  By virtue of this, the right and obligation of \n	public authorities to punish with proportionate penalties,\n	including the death penalty, is acknowledged.  For similar\n	reasons, legimate authorities have the right to impede\n	aggressors in society with the use of arms.  The Church's \n	traditional teaching has always been expressed and will \n	continue to be expressed in the \n	consideration of the real conditions of common good and the\n	effective means for preserving public order and personal\n	safety.  To the degree that means other than the death\n	penalty and military operations are sufficient to keep the\n	peace, then these non-violent provisions are to be preferred\n	because they are more in proportion and in keeping with the\n	final goal of protection of peace and human dignity.  \n\nAs is clearly shown by this excerpt, the Church's teaching on capital\npunishment remains today as it has always been in the past - in total\naccord with my sentiment that I do not disagree with the use of deadly\nforce in those cases for which this option is justifiable.  \n\n\nI seek to conform my will to the will of God as expounded by His\ninstrument of the visible Church here on earth whenever the question\nof faith or morals arises.
Hi everyone,\n\nI'm trying to find my way to God, but find it difficult as I can't hear\nGod talking to me, letting me know that he exists and is with me and\nthat he knows me, and I feel that I can't possibly get to know him until\nhe does. Maybe he _is_ talking to me but I just don't know or understand\nhow to listen.\n\nSome Christians tell me that (in their opinion) the only way to find God\nis to take a plunge and commit your life to him, and you will discover.\nThis idea of diving into the totally unknown is a little bit\nfrightening, but I have a few questions.\n\n1) How do you actually commit yourself? If I just say, "OK God, her you\ngo, I'm committing my life to you", I wouldn't really feel that he'd\nlistened - at least, I couldn't be sure that he had. So how does one (or\nhow did you) commit oneself to God?\n\n2) In committing myself in this way, what do I have to forfeit of my\ncurrent life? What can I no longer do? I feel that I'm as 'good' as many\nChristians, and I try to uphold the idea of 'loving your neighbour' - I\ndon't go round killing people, stealing, etc., and I try not to get\njealous of other people in any way - and I would say that I keep to the\nstandards of treating other people as well as many Christians. So what\ndo I have to give up?\n\n3) When committed, what do I have to do? What does it involve? What (if\nany) burdens am I taking on?\n\n4) So then, what's the general difference before and after? I assume,\nthat (like on your birthday you don't suddenly feel a year older) it\nwon't suddenly change my life the day I commit myself. So what happens?\n\n5) How can I be sure that it is the right thing to do? How can I find\nout what the 'it' in the last sentence actually _is_?!\n\nThanks very much for all your help in answering these questions. Perhaps\ne-mail would be a better way to reply, but it's up to you.
> I'm leaning... SIRACH... is more directly referenced by JAMES\n > than JOB or RUTH is... in any NT verse I've seen.\n\nIt would help if you mentioned chapter and verse from SIRACH and\nfrom JAMES.\n\nJob 5:13 ("He taketh the wise in their craftiness") seems to be\nquoted in 1 Corinthians 3:19.\n\nJames 5:11 ("You have heard of the patience of Job"), while not a\nquote, implies that James and his listeners are familiar with a\nstory of a man named Job who exhibited exemplary patience. It is\npossible that the story they know is not that found in the Hebrew\nBible, but rather another similar and related story. (One has the\nsame problem with direct quotes.)\n\nAgain, Matthew 1:5 ("Boaz begat Obed of Ruth") tells us that Matthew\nknew a story about a woman named Ruth who married a man called Boaz\nand  became the ancestor of David. Since Ruth is not mentioned in\nthe OT outside the Book of Ruth, it seems likely that Matthew was\nfamiliar with the book and respected it, and thought Ruth important\nenough to be one of the few women mentioned in the genealogy.\n\nReferences like this do not prove that the NT writer considered his\nOT source inspired or inerrant or canonical. But neither do direct\nquotes.
whitsebd@nextwork.rose-hulman.edu (Bryan Whitsell) writes,\n\n\nBut that is exactly what I was asking. If the Homosexual community (is that\nthe proper term?) has decided that Christianity is not against Homosexual \nbehaviour but rather condones it then how do they interpret these verses. I\nguess what I am really looking for is a "homosexual" response.
It's my understanding that Romans 9:13 "As it is written, Jacob have I\nloved, but Esau have I hated." refers not to the two individuals, but\nrather to their offspring, the tribe of Jacob and the tribe of Esau\n\nSee Obadiah, for example.  In fact, if you scan through the OT, you\nwill find similar references to the two tribes.
Ok, let me see if I can get all this out concisely.  I am on an\ninformation gathering venture regarding the various expressions of\nChristianity/churches there are.  \n        My husband and I come from very different, but completely\nChristian backgrounds.  I was a Lutheran when I met him and he was a\nborn and raised Church of Christ member.  At first I agreed with a lot\nof what the C of C was about, I wanted to move from the liturgical\nbased Lutheran church to something a little more Biblical based.\nHowever over the last year, I've been regretting changing to the\nChurch of Christ for a number of reasons - for one thing I am not a\nfundamentalist and believe that a few things in the Bible are\nsocio-cultural in nature and don't relate to the Christian doctrine.\nOne of my sorest spots is the role of women.  I believe that through\nMary and other women, Chris validated women as worthy disciples - but\nin the C of C the writings of Paul are taken without exception and I\nam told that I am not an equal partner in my marriage but the lesser\nmember, I am to submit to my husband in all things (if I hear that\nverse one more time....) and I am not to take an active role in\nanything which might be construed as putting me in authority over men\n(ie leading prayers, conducting Bible studies etc).   The last straw\nwas when the Elders at our church came down on one of our college\ngroups because it was all-women and they wanted a man to lead the\nstudy.\nAlso my husband and I really resent the way everyone at our church\nfeels that if you aren't a conservative republican - you aren't a REAL\nChristian (I got told that nobody who voted for Clinton should call\nthemselves a Christian).  Hence we are subjected during the service to\nlong prayers calling for things we flatly dont agree with.  We are\nalso don't agree with the C of C's dread of any new "movement" being\nled by the young people.\n\nSo, we have been church hunting with NO success.  I want a reasonably\nbiblical based church where women are viewed as whole people no matter\nwhat their calling ( C of C really looked down on career women).\nChristopher is looking for a church with deeply rooted religious\nconvictions, with adult baptism and a church where the members still\nbring their Bibles to service.\n\nWe are so confused here and we're drifting around trying to find a\nplace where we both feel loved and can express our faith honestly and\nwithout reservation.  If anyone can point us in a direction we'd be\nthrilled!\nI'm afraid that it will be very hard for me to go back to C of C and\neven harder for me to stay churchless for long.\n\nany responses would be welcome\n\n\nthe diel family
While this is essentially a discussion of reincarnation in the context of\nChristianity Gerry Palo has made some comparisons to Asian religious\nbeliefs on this topic which have simplified the Asian idea of karma\nto the point of misrepresentation.\n\nThere are significant differences in the idea of karma among Hindus,\nJains, Buddhists (and even among the various Buddhist traditions.)\n\nTo refer to karma as a system of reward for past deeds is totally\nincorrect in the Buddhist and Jain traditions.  Karma is considered to\nbe a moral process in which intentions (either good or evil) shape\na person's predilections for future intention and action and\nproduce a person who is more prone to good than evil, or the opposite --\n"reward" has nothing to do with it.  Both Jainism and Buddhism are atheistic\nso there is no deity to dispense rewards or punishments.  Karma is usually\ndescribed in terms of seeds and reaping the fruit thereof.  In fact "As you\nsow, so shall you reap" is found in the Pali Canon as I recall, the metaphor\nof natural growth is explicit.\n\nHinduism, or some sects in that tradition, are I believe much more\ndeterministic and involve concepts closer to reward and punishment being\ntheistically inclined.\n\nIn point of fact, the Theravadin Buddhist tradition of Southeast Asia\nconsiders karma as only one of five influences in human life, and in\nfact from their point of view they would be unable to explain the mechanics\nof karma without the element of free will.\n\nAlso in Eastern religions there is a difference between reincarnation and\nrebirth, which is essentially absent in Western considerations.\n\nIsn't Origen usually cited as the most prestigious proponent of reincarnation\namong Christian thinkers?  What were his views, and how did he relate them\nto the Christian scriptures?
I don't think we should draw borders around newsgroups, christians\nare free to read and post entries on the atheist newsgroups, and \nmuslims are free to so so in other groups as well.\n\nIt's up to each individual to define their time schedule concerning \npostings. The problems we all have noticed on various newsgroups\nis the evangelistical method of telling that 'I am right, and you are\nwrong'. This is true of both theists and atheists.\n\nHopefully a more constructive dialogue between the groups \nwould help concerning assumptions and colorization of views.\n\nCheers,\nKent

[Someone asked about Biblical support for the image of Satan as\na fallen angel.  Rev 12:7-9 and Enoch have been cited.  --clh]\n\nThere is also a verse in Luke(?) that says He[Jesus] saw Satan fall\nfrom Heaven.  It's something like that.

The cited passages are covered IN DEPTH in a FAQ for this group.\nThat particular FAQ (I've forgotten the author) discusses the\ntraditional vs. pro-homosexual interpretations of the passages and\nindicates which points have strong textual support.\n\nPerhaps the moderator might give again the instructions for\nretrieving the FAQ on this topic?\n\nBTW, this issue, while dealt with before, is VERY timely.  One\nof the major Presbyterian churches in California (St. Andrews -- a \nMegaChurch in a rich neighborhood) is withholding their support of \nSynod (amounts to about 10% of the budget of the Synod, which \ncovers all of Southern CA and Hawaii) until support for a \npro-homosexual lobbying group (the Lazarus Project) is terminated.\n[This came from a news report on CNN yesterday -- corrections welcome.]\n					Tim\n\n[I think it's time for me to post the FAQ.  \n\nThis is an issue throughout the Presbyterian Church.  On the other\nside, one of the major churches in Cincinnati has been ordaining\nhomosexual elders, and has ignored Presbytery instructions not to do\nso.  And the church in Rochester where the judicial commission said\nthey couldn't install a homosexual pastor has made her an\n"evangelist".  These situations, as well as the one you describe, do\nnot appear to be stable.  This will certainly be a major topic for the\nGeneral Assembly next month.  If the church can't come up with a\nsolution that will let people live with each other, I think we're end\nup with a split.  Clearly neither side wants that, but I think we'll\nget pushed into it by actions of both sides.

Paul-\n\n	You did a wonderful job of not doing anything humany possible to \noffend us Catholics; hopefully I can be just as careful in my wording as you\nwere.\n	I also don't want to extend this topic into an entire major issue of\ndebate (anymore than it already is), but just a note or two:\n\n	1.  Please don't talk about Jesus' "parents"--the doctrinal positions\n		of the church an unequivocally different regarding Mary and\n		Joseph.  I (personally) have never heard of anything being\n		attributed to St. Joseph other than his sainthood; that is,\n		no reference *ever* to him being sinless, assumed into heaven,\n		immaculately conceived, etc.--all these ideas apply only to\n		Mary.\n\n	2.  I would agree there is very little scriptural evidence for our\n		doctrines about Mary.  Needless to say, that presents a \n		significant problem to those who accept the bible as the only\n		source of doctrine.  If, however, one turns to the sacred \n		traditions of the undivided Christian Church, there is no\n		problem finding plently of evidence that it was basically a\n		unanimous belief among the apostles and all the early \n		generation that Mary was assumed into heaven, body and soul,\n		etc. etc.  It wasn't until the reformation that these doctrines\n		were called into question.  As far as I am concerned (again, my\n		personaly feelings) if it's a choice between the apostles or\n		Luther, I'll choose the apostles every time, whether or not\n		it is recorded within the writings that the traditions of men\n		have determined to be "the bible".

searching out our deceased ancestors so that we can perform the\n   ordinances -- such as baptism, confirmation, and marriage for time and\n   eternity -- that are required for a person to obtain salvation through\n   Christ and to live with Him through the eternities. These are people\n   who may have not had the opportunity to know Christ in their lifetime,\n   so we are making it possible for Christ's saving grace (I know there\n   are thousands of interpretations of that phrase) to become fully\n   effective for them if they allow it to do so on the other side.\n\n\nThis paragraph brought to mind a question.  How do you (Mormons) reconcile\nthe idea of eternal marriage with Christ's statement that in the ressurection\npeople will neither marry nor be given in marriage (Luke, chapt. 20)?\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDavid Hammerslag (dhammers@urbana.mcd.mot.com)\n   "...there ain't nobody so bad that the Lord can't save 'em ain't\n        nobody so good they don't need God's love..." -- Mullins
When an alleged private revelation attracts sufficient attention,\n   the Church may investigate it.  If the investigation indicates a\n   likelihood that the alleged private revelation is in fact from God,\n   it will be approved.  That means that it can be preached in the\n   Church.  However, it is still true that no one is required to\n   believe that it came from God.  A Catholic is free to deny the\n   authenticity of even the most well attested and strongly approved\n   private revelations, such as those at Fatima and Lourdes.  (I\n   suspect that few if any Catholics do reject Fatima and Lourdes, but\n   if any do their rejection of them does not mean they are not\n   orthodox Catholics in good standing.)\n\nIt may be a bit much to say that a Catholic is free to deny what\nhappened at Fatima.  That's a bit strong, it is sort of like saying\nthat a Catholic is free to deny that Hong Kong exists.  What a\nCatholic *is* free to do is to deny the truth of Fatima, without being\ncalled a heretic.  You can be labeled other things for such an\noffense, but not a heretic.\n\nTheologians make a basic distinction as far as the degree of assent\none must give to events like Fatima and Lourdes.  Things revealed by\nGod through Jesus Christ or His Apostles must be given the assent due\nto a revelation of God: total and unswerving.  Fatima and Lourdes\ndemand our assent as much as any other well-attested event in human\nhistory.  Perhaps a bit more, given the approval of the Church.\n\n"Approval" of an apparition by the Church principally means that\nwhatever happened was in harmony with the Catholic Faith.\n\nI personally think of private revelations as our Lord's way of telling\nus what to do at particular periods in history.  He gave us all the\ndoctrines, etc., 2000 years ago, but we can always use some help in\nknowing how exactly to apply what He gave us.\n\nCatholic devotion to the Sacred Heart was a result of a series of\napparitions to St. Margaret Mary Alacoque, for example.  The problem\nat the time was extreme moral rigorism that was turning our Lord into\nsomeone without a heart.
Several replies to my post have said that I should get to know  \nChristian homosexuals before judging them.  I maintain that I was not  \njudging them by saying that homosexuality is wrong.   I would like to  \nlook at the responces to my post and make a general sterotypical  \nevaluation of the people who responded to the side of Christianity  \nand homosexuality being compatible (admitedly not all are homosexuals  \nbut I know that many are from their e-mail responces).  I don't  \nnormally make sterotypical assumptions about groups of people, but  \nsince I have been asked to by many of the opposing veiw point I will.\n\nSo far people have made wild assumptions, put me down because I don't  \nhave the resources of others, and even reverted to name calling.  If  \nyou don't think this is an acurate representation then those of you  \nwho are homosexual Christians show me the diffrence.
Hello, Brycen ?!\nI'm a Norwegian journalist student - and also a Christian. Thanks for your \ntestimony! But I want to ask you one question: What do you think of Heavy \nMetal music after you became a Christian? You know there are Christian bands \nlike Barren Cross, Whitecross, Bloodgood and Stryper, that play that kind of \nmusic. I like some of it, I feel like it sometimes. Of course I listen to \nthe lyrics too. I don't listen to any Christian band, but it's better than \nlistening to secular music anyway. \nHope you're still going strong - with Christ!!
I haven't read this entire thread, but, if someone hasn't tossed this out yet, then here it is: \n\n2 Samuel 12:21-23 (RSV) : \n\n  "Then his servants said to him, `What is this thing that you have\n  done? You fasted and wept for the child while it was alive; but when\n  the child died, you arose and ate food.' He [David] said, 'While the\n  child was still alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, 'Who knows\n  whether the LORD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?' But\n  now he is dead; why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall\n  go to him, but he will not return to me.'"\n\nAnyhow, many interpret this to mean that the child has gone to Heaven\n(where David will someday go). I don't claim to know for sure if this\napplies to all babies or not. But even if it's just this one, what\nwould you say to this?
: After reading the posts on this newsgroup for the pasts 4 months, it \n: has become apparent to me that this group is primarily active with \n: Liberals, Catholics, New Agers', and Athiests.  Someone might think \n: to change the name to:  soc.religion.any   - or -  perhaps even\n: soc.religion.new.  It might seem to be more appropriate.\n: Heck, don't flame me, I'm Catholic, gay, and I voted \n: for Bill Clinton.  I'm on your side!                      \n\nSince when did conservative, protestant, old-time religion believers get\nan exclusive francise to christianity?  Christianity is, and always has\nbeen, a diverse and contentious tradition, and this group reflects that\ndiversity.  I, fo one, am not ready to concede to _any_ group- be they\n"liberal" or "conservative", catholic, protestant, or orthodox, charismatic\nor not- the right to claim that they have _the truth_, and everyone else\nis not "christian."
I see a parallel between what I will stupidly call the "homosexual" \nissue and the "atheist" issue. Please take no offense at these\ncomparisons.\n\nThe homosexual "feels" things that I admit I do not "feel". \nHe learns that these feelings are classified as homosexual feelings\nand learns of a model of sexuality that seems to apply to\nhis feelings, which he then can fit with his experiences.\nThat is, this model gives him a sense of understanding his\nsituation. Models that do not match up with what he knows he\nfeels will be discarded. However, one wonders if once accepting\nthe idea of his being gay and deciding what exactly that\nmeans he will analyze all his feelings and experiences based on \nthe definition he has already accepted, which of course validates\nhis model.\n\nIf that was hard to understand now listen to my parallel.\n\nThe Christian "feels" things that an atheist claims he does not\nfeel. The Christian accepts the Christian theology as the true\ndescription of what his feelings mean. Once accepting this\nmodel he interprets his experiences with regards to this model\nwhich of course validates his Christianity.\n\nAs a reminder, I am a Christian, a Catholic, I don't hate \nhomosexuals or atheists, but am just trying to understand\nthem. I only compare them because they are both so foreign\nto me. Am I as blind to the homosexual as the atheist seems\nblind to me? Or am I as prejudiced against atheistic denial of\nreligious experience as the homosexual is prejudiced against \nattempts by society to deny his sexuality?\n\nOr am I just out to lunch, again?

Where's the beef, Rex?\n\n[...Claims ex-Mason showed him leopard skin he wore in lodge]\n\n   I'd have to check this. The tomb paintings I remember don't show\nthis.\n\n\n   Can you give ancient citations for this? The druids were suppressed\nover 2000 years ago. What's your point?\n\n   This whole "leopard skin" business sounds bizarre.  I have not yet\ngone through the Scottish Rite (which contains all of those "higher\ndegrees" anti-Masons get so excited about, and which was invented in\nthe 1750's), but I know enough people who have (and who are good\nChristians), that I reject your claim.\n\n\nNot so much a 'slap in the face' as 'a weary feeling of deja vu'. I'm\ngoing through a very similar argument over on soc.culture.african.american.\n\n\n    Why don't you try reading some serious books on Masonic history, such\nas Hamill's "The Craft"?\n\n\n   Because we got honest. If you can come up with actual evidence that\nMasonry existed prior to 1390, I'd be VERY impressed (actually,\nanything earlier than 1630 would be pretty good.)\n\n						Peter Trei\n						ptrei@mitre.org
What is the proper way to dispose of old blessed palms?\nI`ve have a bunch that I`ve been holding onto.  In addition,\nmy mom has been giving me her's.  I used to give them to my\nuncle who would burn them (and leave the ashes to seep into the\nground).  Should I do the same?  Could I just bury them?  Could\nI add them to my compost bin?\n\nThanks in advance.
I would say only to the extent that the Roman Catholic Church\nneither approves nor disapproves of capital punishment, as\nconfirmed in the recent catechism, though there are many RCs\nwho were rather surprised and upset that capital punishment was\nnot explicitly condemned.\n\nFor myself, as a Catholic, I see my own opposition to capital\npunishment as much the same as my opposition to abortion - a\nreverence for life. Here in the UK, the anti-abortion case is\noften let down by the explicit link which those on the\npolitical left make with anti-abortionists and\npro-executionists. There is a tendency to condemn people who\nhold both views as hypocrites. I feel that if there were many\nmore anti-abortionists who were also vocal in their opposition\nto capital punishment on a pro-life line, it would end this\nkneejerk association of anti-abortion as a right-wing thing,\nand get many to think seriously about the issue (there are\nplenty who are pro-abortion equally for a kneejerk left-wing\nreason).\n\nI do not think your biblical quote can automatically be taken\nas support for capital punishment. I take it that as a Roman\nCatholic you are opposed to abortion, and would still onsider\nit wrong, and something to be objected to even if legalised by\n"authority".
All children are born pure, i.e., without sin.\nHowever, most saints would view a pregnancy\noutside of marriage as an occasion of mourning.\n(Some church members would be much more\njudgmental, but that is *their* problem.)\n\nIn situations where welfare assistance is \nprovided through our Church, bishops usually\nrequire that the family be making some effort to\nlive the Gospel standards and provide for \nthemselves.\n\nHowever, there are occasions when assistance is\nprovided because of the children in the home.\nAs a former bishop of mine said, "Children are \nalways worthy before God."\n\n\nI am not sure what you mean by the term "bastards"\nin this context.\n\nLatter-Day Saints believe that through the\ntemple ordinances the family unit may be\npreserved in eternity.\n\nIf you use genealogical material or software\nproduced by the Church, you may notice a section\nfor "temple ordinances."  Within that section\nthere should be a spot for signifying "BIC"\nwhich stands for "born in the covenant."\n\nThe children born to couple sealed (married)\nwithin the temple are "born in the covenant"\nand are eligible to be part of that eternal\nfamily unit.\nChildren born to other couples (whether in a\ncivil marriage or not) would have to be\nsealed to their parents after their marriage\nis solemnized for eternity.\n\nSupposing a child were born to a woman out of\nwedlock, he or she could be sealed to his or\nher parents at a later date or adopted into \nany eternal family unit (which may include one\nof the birth parents).\n\n\nI can't say if this principle of adoption\nwas revealed at the same time as the sealing \nordinances, but it has been accepted for the \n~15 years I have been in the Church.\n\nI would tend to discount any admonitions from\nthe Church authorities against having children\nout of wedlock because even though there are\nprovisions within the Lord's plan to recover\nwhat we have done wrong the Church does not\nwant to give anyone the impression we can sin\nand repent at our leisure.

The following was published in the May 15th Rocky Mountain News.  I\nguess I have some REAL ethical problems with the practices at this\nchurch.  I understand that Baptism is an overriding factor.  I also\nunderstand that this is not an honest way to proceed.  Unfortunately,\nthis is becoming more typical of congregations as the Second Coming is\nperceived to approach.\n\nThere is a real element of disparation in this 'make it happen at any\ncost' style of theology.  I wonder where TRUST IN THE LORD fits into\nthis equation?\n\nBaptisms draw parents' ire -- Children at church carnival in Springs\ntold they'd be killed by bee stings if they didn't submit to religious\nrite.\n\nBy Dick Foster -- Rocky Mountain News Southern Bureau\n\nColorado Springs -- Outraged parents say their children were lured to\na church carnival and then baptixed without their permission by a\nBaptist minister.\n\nDoxens of children, some as young as 8 years old and unaccompanied by\ntheir parents, thought they were going to a carnival at the\nCornerstone Baptist Church, where there would be a big water fight,\nfree balloons, squirt guns and candy.\n\nBefore that May 1 carnival was over, however, children were whisked\ninto a room for religious instruction and told they should be\nbaptized.  In many cases they consented, although they or their\nfamilies are not of the Baptist faith.\n\nThe baptisms by the church have angered many parents, including\nPaulette Lamontagne, a Methodist and mother of twin 8-year-old girls\nwho were baptized without her knowledge or consent.\n\n'My understnading was they were going to a carnival.  I feel that's a\nfalse pretense,' said Lamontagne.  Her daughters said the minister\ntold them they would be killed by bee stings if they were not\nbaptized.\n\nCornerstone church officials defended their actions.\n\n'We take our instructions from the word of God and God has commanded\nus to baptize converts.  No one can show me one passage in the Bible\nwhere it says that parental permission is required before a child is\nbaptized,' said Dan Irwin, associate pastor of the Cornerstone Baptist\nChurch.\n\nChurch officials did not tell parents their children would be baptized\nbecause 'they didn't ask,' Irwin said.\n\nMany other parents also felt they were simply sending their children\nto a carnival at the invitation of their children's friends who were\nmembers of the Cornerstone Church.\n\nPolice said chhurch officials had broken on laws in baptizing the\nchildren, but indicated the parents could pursue civil action.\n\n-------------------------------------------\nAren't these the same behaviors we condemn\nin the Hari Krishnas and other cults?\n\n[I think the issues are more complex than the newspaper account\nmentions.  First, I'm not entirely sure that parental consent is\nabsolutely required.  This would be extremely difficult, because of\nthe clear commandment to obey parents.  But if an older child insisted\non being baptized without their parents' consent, I might be willing\nto do it.  However this would be a serious step, and would warrant\nmuch careful discussion.  The problem I find here is not so much\nparental consent as that there was nobody's consent.  Whether you\nbelieve in infant baptism or not, baptism is supposed to be the sign\nof entry into a Christian community.  If there isn't a commitment from\n*somebody*, whether parent or child, and no intent to become part of\nthe Church, the baptism appears to be a lie.  Furthermore, it is\nlikely to raise serious practical problems.  What if the child is from\na baptist tradition?  Normally when he reaches the age of decision, he\nwould be expected to make a decision and be baptized.  But he already\nhas been, by a church claiming to be a Baptist church.  So does he get\nrebaptized?  Neither answer is really very good.  If not, he's being\nrobbed of an experience that should be very significant to his faith.

>Subject: hate the sin...\n   >Date: 12 May 93 08:27:08 GMT\n\n   >"Hate the sin but love the sinner"...I've heard that quite a bit recently,\n   >My question is whether that statement is consistent with Christianity. I\n   >would think not.  Hate begets more hate, never love.\n\n       If you are questioning whether or not "hating sin" is consistent with\n   Christianity; I ask you to consider the following Scripture:\n\n       Romans 12:9 "Let Love be without hypocrisy.  Hate what is evil, cling\n                    to what is good."\n\n       What is it that Paul, through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit is\n   calling us to hate?  Would God call us to do something that would\n   eventually lead to hating our fellow man; especially when he commands us to\n   do the opposite, to love your fellow man?\n\n   >Consider some sin. Now lets apply our "hate the sin..." philosophy and see\n   >what happens. If we truly hate the sin, then the more we see it, the\n   >stronger our hatred of it will become. Eventually this hate becomes so\n   >strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to\n   >hate the sinner.\n\n       That has not been my experience.  I've not found myself hating anybody\n   as a result of hating the sin that may be in their life.  As a sinner\n   myself, I find myself having more compassion for the person.  Jesus too,\n   since the Bible teaches that he was tempted in every way that we are, is\n   able to have compassion on us when we our tempted and fall.  Jesus is our\n   very example of HOW to hate the sin but love the sinner.  In the account of\n   the woman caught in adultery (John 8), Jesus had compassion on the woman;\n   BUT he also called her to leave her life of sin.  This is what it means to\n   love sinners but hate their sin; it means loving them unconditionally,\n   while at the same time calling them to leave their sin.\n\n   >In addition, our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and do things\n   >which are taken personally by the sinner (who often does not even believe\n   >what they are doing is a sin).\n\n       The blame for this can not always be laid at the feet of the\n   Christian.  I have seen and been guilty of taking offense by someone merely\n   pointing out my sin and calling me to repent of it.  It was not unloving\n   for the Christian to call me out of sin; in fact, I believe it was the most\n   loving thing that that person could have done.  He loved me enough to want\n   to spare me the consequence of remaining in my sin.\n\n   >After enough of this, the sinner begins to hate us (they certainly don't\n   >love us for our constant criticism of their behavior). Hate builds up and\n   >drives people away from God...this certainly cannot be a good way to build\n   >love.\n\n       Again, I don't think that you can lay the blame for this at the feet of\n   the Christian.  If we have loved them as Jesus loved sinners (exemplified\n   in John 8) and the sinner hates us for it, then we have done the best we\n   can.  We will have extended to them the most perfect expression of love and\n   they will have rejected it.\n\n       Now it we hate the sin but forget to love the sinner, then indeed, we\n   will, ourselves, be in sin.\n\n   >In the summary of the law, Christ commands us to love God and to love our\n   >neighbors. He doesn't say anything about hate.\n\n       I would like to encourage you to do a word study on HATE in the New\n   Testament.  I really think that you will be surprised.\n\n   >In fact, if anything, he commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves.\n\n       Criticism is very different from calling a sinner to repent.\n\n   Hope this helps,\n   In Christ,\n   Tony Balsamo\n--
Yes, but no more than he is worth. :-).  Seriously: Jerome is merely\n(and grandly) another Christian witness, to be taken for what he can\ntell us.  He is one in the community of saints.  You seem to wish for\na greater polarization and dichotomy between Catholic and Protestant\nthought than seems to me, from a historical perspective, to be valid.\nTo be sure, Rome rejects (some significant aspects of) Protestant\nthought just as vehemently as Protestants reject (some significant\naspects of) Roman thought.  Other than some peoplw who apparently try\nto embody the greatest extreme of this rejection, on either side, there\nis not quite so vast a gulf fixed as casual observers seem to assume.\n\nEcumenical consultations between Rome and the Lutherans, as well as \nthose between Rome and the Anglican communion (to which I belong) show\nvery nearly complete convergence on understanding the basic theological\nissues -- the sticking points tend to be ecclesiology and church polity.\nThus, for example, as you go on to say:\n\n\nMany of us do not regard a papal decretal as having any necessary (as\nopposed to political) significance.  Sometimes it will, sometimes it\nwon't.  You misread me if you think that my communion, at least, "throws\nout" the deuterocanonical books.  Nor do I think you should overstress\nthe sense in which the more Reformed may do so.\n\n\nI seriously suggest you rethink what you are saying here.  It verges on,\nand could be taken as, anti-Semitic in the worst sense.  The "unbelieving"\nJews were, according to what I understand as a Christian, the chosen\npeople of God, and the recipients of His pre-Incarnational revelation.\nI think they have some say in the matter.  The Javneh meeting should not\nbe over-interpreted.  A recent magisterial study titled _Mikra_ (I don't\nhave more citation information on hand, sorry) produced primarily from\nthe background of Christian (rather than specifically Jewish) scholarship\nsuggests strongly that the Javneh meeting mostly resolved a lingering\nquestion, where in practice the canon had long been fixed on the basis\nof the scrolls that were kept in the Temple, and thereby "made the hands\nunclean" when used.  The list of "sacred books" that may be drawn up from\nJosephus and other pre-Yavneh sources correspond (plus or minus one book,\nif I rememeber the chapter correctly) to the current Jewish canon of Tanakh.\n\nAll of this is not to "throw out" the deuterocanonicals (what, by the way,\nis YOUR position about the books the Greeks accept and Rome does not? :-))\n-- just to observe that the issue is complex and simply binary judgment\ndoes not do it justice.
If you want parallels the best source is probably the book _Temple\nand Cosmos_ by Hugh Nibley.  It is not light reading however.\n\nAs to why these early practices "only parallel" and do not exactly\nduplicate the modern LDS ceremony, there are a couple of reasons:\n\n1.  Quite likely we do not have the exact original from ancient\ntimes.  This stuff was not commonly known but bits and pieces\nundoubtedly spread.  (Much as bits and pieces of the modern ceremony\nget known.)  What we have in the 40 day literature, the Egyptian\nceremonies, and certain Native American ceremonies is almost\ncertainly not exactly what Jesus taught.
Anyone who thinks being gay and Christianity are not compatible should \ncheck out Dignity, Integrity, More Light Presbyterian churches, Affirmation,\nMCC churches, etc.  Meet some gay Christians, find out who they are, pray\nwith them, discuss scripture with them, and only *then* form your opinion.\n--

Well, here is something I wrote some time ago in response to a\nsimilar question.  I hope it helps:\n\n[Begin repeat of previous post]\n\nAs for the scripture mentioned I agree that it does seem to be a \nproblem, not only for eternal marriage but marriage in general.  \nLuke's version has Jesus saying that the children of this world \nmarry and are given in marriage but not those who will attain\nthe kingdom of heaven.  It almost sounds like marriage disqualifies\none for salvation.  (Matthew and Mark both omit this statement.)   I\nthink the accounts are not as clear as they might be.  Let's have a\nlook at the incident and see if we can come up with some reasonable\nideas of what it means.  The scriptures involved are Mat 22:23-30,\nMark 12:18-25, and Luke 20:27-36.\n\nWhat happened was that the Sadducees, who did not believe in the\nresurrection, thought they could trap Jesus.  They made reference to\nthe "Leverite" marriage which required the brother of a man who died\nwithout children to take the widow to wife and raise up children.  \nThe children would be considered children of the deceased, just as\nthough the woman's first husband had fathered them.  It seems\nobvious from this that the woman was still considered in a way to be\nthe wife of her first husband.  However, the Sadducees concocted a\nscene in which 6 brothers of the deceased each in his turn failed to\nfather children by the widow.  They seem to imply that the Leverite\nmarriage was equal to the first for they ask, "Whose wife shall she\nbe in the resurrection?"  At this point it seems obvious that if she\nis anybody's wife, it is the first husband.  After all, had she\nborne children they would have been credited to him regardless of\nwhich brother was the biological father.  It is possible Jesus was\nrefering to this when he says, "Ye do err, not knowing the\nscriptures or the power of God." (Mat 22:29, compare Mark 12:24,\nphrase not in Luke's account).\n\nAnyway, the Sadducees ask, "Whose wife will she be in the\nresurrection, seeing that all 7 had her?"  Jesus answer is that,\n"In the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in\nmarriage..." (Mat 22:30) "When they rise from the dead they neither\nmarry..." (Mark 12:25)  "They which are accounted worthy to obtain\nthat world neither marry..." (Luke 20:35)  All 3 accounts go on to\nsay, "but are as the angels in heaven" or the equivalent.  I find\nthis last not very helpful since the Bible does not define angels\nnor give any idea what their life is like.  (Some ministers claim\nthat they are sexless, different that humans etc. but I can find no\nBiblical support for this.)
The above article is a good short summary of traditional Christian\nteaching concerning the death of Mary.  \nAlso very good is "Re: Question about the Virgin Mary" by Micheal D.\nWalker.  He tells the story very well.\nI would like to add that in the Eastern Orthodox Church we celebrate "The\nDormition (or falling asleep) of the Theotokos (the mother of God)".  The\nIcon for this day shows Mary lying on a bed surrounded by the Apostles\nwho are weeping.  Christ, in his resurrected glory, is there holding what\nseems to be a small child.  This is, in fact, Mary's soul already with\nChrist in Heaven.  The Assumption of Mary is one more confirmation for us\nas Christians that Christ did indeed conquer death.  It forshadows the\ngeneral resurrection on the last day.  The disciples were not surprised\nto find Mary's body missing from the grave.  She was the Mother of the\nSavior.  She was the first of all Christians.  She gave birth to the Word\nof God.  If it were not for her we would not be saved.  This is why we\npray in the Orthodox Church, "Through the prayers of the Theotokos,\nSavior save us."
Not exactly correct, but nice try.  The Catholic doctrine of infallibility\nrefers to freedom from error in teaching of the universal Church in \nmatters of faith or MORALS.  It is this teaching which is taken as \ndoctrine.
Meta-exegesis: Conviction of Sin,  part II\n\nLet me return to the question, stipulating that Paul meant his use of\n_arseonkoitai_ to refer more or less exactly to the Levitical prohibition\nof male-male sex.  In order to bring out the problems most clearly, I'll\nalso stipulate (what I think is far less plausible) that Paul coined the\nterm for this usage.  The question I want to turn to is what that would\nmean for Paul's readers and for later Christians.  This should be shorter\nthan my last note, as we will see that this question rapidly confronts us\nwith some of the major divisions within Christ's body, and I am not trying\nto open the gates for flames across any of the terrible chasms that\nseparate any of us from our fellow Christians.  My own biases (loosely\ncharacterizable as "liberal") will be evident, but I am not grinding an\naxe here, so much as trying to get all parties to see that it may be HARD\nto reach "closure" when the issues involved strike at the heart of what we\neach, in our own different ways, see as crucial to the Gospel of Christ.\n\nSo; stipulating Paul's intent, the immediate question is: HOW CAN HIS\nREADERS UNDERSTAND this intent?  And following on that question, there is\na second one: WHAT IS OUR PROPER ACTION if we *do* manage to understand him?\n\nSince Paul gives not a single clue about his meaning in the text of 1st\nCorinthians, there are two "positive" answers and one "negative" to this\nquestion:\n\n+	a.  Paul (or Apollos, or someone) in the apostolic community has\n	    conveyed to the Corinthians the then-traditional Jewish condem-\n	    nation of homosexual behavior, and Paul expects them to be\n	    sufficiently well-tutored by this tradition that he needs no\n	    futher explanation.  [I should note that there is no evidence\n	    in the letter, or in 2 Corinthians for such a supposition :-)]\n\n+	b.  The Spirit will teach us what Paul means (or, if not Paul,\n	    what God means "behind" Paul's inspired word-choice.)\n\n-	c.  We *don't* know, and cannot guess to within any better pre-\n	    cision here than, for comparison, in the parallel use by Paul,\n	    in the same passage of the word  _pleonektai_ ("those who have\n	    more" -- if you think that _areseonkoitai_ is "obvious" from\n	    its roots, try cutting your teeth on *this* word!  The NEB\n	    translates it as "grabbers") or even _methusoi_ ("drunkards"\n	    -- at least this has the advantage of being a common insult,\n	    so that at least there is *some* hint as to its meaning!)\n\nThe three positions more or less -- if I can be allowed some exaggeration\nfor the sake of argument -- define a classical Catholic attitude towards\ntradition, one form of Protestant _sola scriptura_, and a liberal/critical\ndemand for evidence.  All three positions have strengths and weaknesses.\n\n_ad_ a:	It is unquestionable that the gospel was preached in and by the\n	community of Christ's disciples and their successors, and that\n	our NT scripture itself emerges from this communal tradition.\n	But it's also the case that we know little or nothing about this\n	tradition until almost a century after Paul, which is to say that\n	we have access to the tradition only after several generations of\n	possibly confused transmission.  The scripture is itself our only\n	documentation of the tradition in the critical era.\n\n_ad_ b:	If we are NOT born of water and Spirit [to revert to John in an\n	attempt to explain Paul :-)], then we have no more hope of under-\n	standing the gospel than Nicodemus had; neither the traditions of\n	men nor the vain elevation of our own reason can prevent the Spirit\n	from blowing where it will -- the Paraclete is a kamikaze.  But\n	the downside of Protestant belief in the efficacy of the Spirit\n	as our guide in scripture is that the wing of Protestantism that\n	takes this most seriously is also the most fragmented over divergent\n	understanding supposedly derived from the "clear" Word of God.\n\n		[Note: classical Lutheran, Calvinist and Anglican thought\n		constrains scripture to be read *within* tradition, even\n		while reserving judgment against tradition out of scripture;\n		the more bizarre forms of "I will read Scripture my way"\n		are primarily a fringe aspect of "cultic" Protestantism.]\n\n	The main problem with this approach is that there is apparently no\n	means for ONE person to convey to another what that one may feel\n	*is* teaching received from the Spirit; and history shows incredible\n	conflict between Christians on this point, each in his own mind\n	"convinced" that he is led by the Spirit.  No one can seriously\n	urge point b without SOME sense of its potential for setting Christian\n	against Christian.  To what purpose?\n\n_ad_ c:	The critical approach has the distinct advantage that when it can\n	reach a conclusion, it can lay out the data in a way which is open\n	to all.  The weakness is an obvious corollary: this is not usually\n	possible. :-)\n\n	[If I may say a word here, out of my own already acknowledged bias;\n	one complaint against critical methodology is that it "dissolves"\n	faith -- but surely a "faith" that cannot honestly face the evalu-\n	ation of evidence has problems which mere theology is helpless to\n	address.]\n\nAnyway, there is a serious and unfortunate possibility of schism between\n"liberal" and "conservative" positions, mostly on the basis of extreme\nzealots of positions b and c.  A Catholic sense of authority and tradition\ntends to constrain arguments of b contra c to secondary position, so that\ndespite horrendous strains Rome is NOT as likely to find these issues as\nultimately divisive as the Protestant world will.  And Anglicans will (I\npredict) muddle through on the _via media_, attempting to give each position\nits due, but no more than its due. \n\nSecond question.  Suppose tradition tells us, and lots of "spiritual"\nChristians tell us, and critical thought at least admits as possible,\nthat Paul is refering to a flat, universal Levitical prohibition against\nmale-male sex.  What then?  Again, we can abdicate our personal responsi-\nbility to tradition, and let it dictate the answer.  But it's precisely\nwhere inherited traditions are NOT questioned that they're most dangerous.\n\nWe have EXAMPLES of Christ questioning the Pharisees and THEIR use of\ntradition (despite his urging, in Matthew 23:2 that we are to heed them).\nWe have EXAMPLES of Peter, and more radically still Paul, jettisoning the\ntraditions that THEY were led by the Spirit to call into question.  Jesus\nand Peter and Paul do not so much "throw out" tradition as subject it to\nradical criticism, on a couple of very basic grounds:\n\n     "the weightier demands of the law: justice and mercy and good faith"\n							(Matthew 23:23)\nand  "On these two commandments [love God & neighbor] hand the whole Law,\n      and the Prophets, also."\n							(Matthew 22:40)\n\nIf there is a fundamental (because derived from Christ) validity in the\nchallenge to *some* traditions, a validity that led the first generation\nto go so far as to waive application of the Torah to gentile converts\n(vastly beyond anything that is directly deducible from Jesus' reported\nwords and deeds), it signifies to me a certain failure of the imagination\nto *postulate* that *only* the traditions that we have specific challenges\nagainst are in fact open to challenge.\n\nAll traditions passed *through* men are traditions *of* men.  That God may\nlead us even so, that these traditions are a source of our spiritual\ninstruction I will freely grant.  But tradition is inherently human, and\ninherently corruptible (and given the Fall, corrupt).  Nothing in it is\nimmune to challenge, when the Spirit shows us a failure in justice, mercy\nand good faith.  Nothing may ultimately stand unless it DOES follow from\nlove of God and love of neighbor.\n\nI am perfectly willing to grant that I could be blind to my own sin.  That\nthe Spirit may have taught another what She refuses to teach me (or I am\ntoo dense to learn).  That tradition *might* have value here.  But what I\n*know* of tradition is that on one occasion, some superstitious Christians\nappealed to Justinian after an earthquake in Asia Minor, and scapegoated\n"sodomites" as the "cause" of the earthquake, so that legislation was\npassed making homosexual behavior a capital offense.  If that is in\naccord with the gospel of Christ, then I am no Christian.  That is human\ntradition at its most hateful and vicious.  And I see nothing all that much\ndifferent in all the unbidden eruptions onto USENET of people who are quick\nto condemn but slow to understand.  If that is the leading of the Spirit,\nthen I want no part of it.  But what I have found in obedience to the Lord\nis that I am, myself, TOTALLY dependent on the witness of other Christians,\nfor the truth that lives in the Body of Christ.\n\nAnd I say to all who doubt that gay Christianity is from God what Gamaliel\nsaid to doubting Pharisees who would have suppressed the earliest Church:\n\n	"be careful how you deal with these people...  If this enterprise,\n	this movement of theirs, is of human origin it will break up of\n	its own accord; but if it does in fact come from God you will not\n	only be unable to destroy them, but you might find yourselves\n	fighting against God."\n							[Acts 5:36...39] \n\nAll I ask is that you listen to your traditions, and read your scriptures\nwith a mind and soul OPEN to the Spirit, and to the past history of our\nfirst Christian witnesses' willingness to challenge tradition and OTHER\nreadings of scripture -- though read with all the authority of scribes and\nrabbis -- and a submission to the declaration that all must depend on the\nlove of God and neighbor.  Then, study the evidence; learn the history of\nChristians oppressing Christians out of their traditions and eagerness to\njudge where Jesus and Paul tell us NOT to judge.  And let the witness of\nthe Spirit in the lives of your fellow Christians -- including those who\nare NOT of your preference in theology -- guide you towards God's truth.\n-- \nMichael L. Siemon		I say "You are gods, sons of the\nmls@panix.com			Most High, all of you; nevertheless\n    - or -			you shall die like men, and fall\nmls@ulysses.att..com		like any prince."   Psalm 82:6-7\n\n[There's a certain ambiguity in your discussion of position (a), as to\nwhether you're speaking of tradition in Paul's time or ours.  I think\nthere are two ways to use tradition.  One is to say that when Paul and\nhis readers share a tradition, it makes sense to interpret his words\nin the context of that shared tradition.  That's what makes me think\nthat these arguments over words turn out to be silly.  We know that\nPaul came out of a background that was rather Puritanical on sex.\nEverything else he says on sex is consistent with that background.\nThe tone of his remarks on homosexuality in Rom 1 is consistent with\nthat background.  Even if the words in the sin lists aren't the most\ngeneral terms for homosexual activity (and it seems to me that there's\nsome evidence that they are not), they are just one more piece of\nevidence for something we would probably be willing to believe with no\nevidence at all -- that Paul shares the common Jewish rejection of\nhomosexuality.\n\nBut when you identify (a) with the Catholic position, that's rather a\nhorse of a different color.  The Catholic position involves a\ncontinuing church tradition.  Arguments specific to that tradition\nmight be (1) we can get guidance on how to interpret Paul's original\nmeaning from tradition, e.g. the way the Church Fathers interpreted\nhim, and (2) we gain confidence that his prohibitions still apply in\nour time because of the universal judgement of the church between his\ntime and ours.  I think this is a somewhat different use of tradition.\nA radical Protestant might be willing to use known 1st Cent.\ntradition to illuminate Paul's original meaning, but not use the\nCatholic position to answer the question of what our own attitude to\nhomosexuality should be.
Just because those  "marriages" are more stable and loving and long-lasting,\ndoesn't make it right.  Same-sex partners could have been best friends,\nwithout getting sexually involved with each other.

Everybody!  Listen up!  Get your rocks ready!  We'll have\n        some good biblical fun.  Here she is whispering to me that\n        she doesn't have a husband, yet I know by my secret powers that\n        she has had five of them!  (You know how these Samaritans are!\n        And worse, she's living with a guy now that she's not even married\n        to.  Now I believe in loving her, and if you'll just raise up\n        those rocks like the bible allows and threaten her with a good\n        stoning, she'll understand how much we hate the sin but love\n        the sinner.

It is nice of you to have pity on\n            me while I'm hanging here, but you must understand, this is\n            all an act; I'm not really hurting.  I'm God, you see.

Are you sure you want to include Chalcedon here?  I presume that you \nmean the description of Jesus as fully human and fully devine.  Almost \neveryone would consider the majority of Copts and Armenians, and the \nJacobites, as Christians, yet for 15 centuries it has been maintained \nthat they disagree with the Formula of Chalcedon.  Those that wouldn't \nconsider them Christians are most likely to object that these communities \ndon't require a personal commitment to Jesus, which is only tangentially \nrelated to the Formula of Chalcedon.  \n-- \nThanks, John Kolassa, kolassa@bio1.bst.rochester.edu

He has also made several visits to many East\nEuropean countries.\n\nFRONTLINE FELLOWSHIP NEWS                          ISSN 1018-144X\n\nPRAYING FOR JUSTICE\n(by Peter Hammond)\n\nTo those involved in ministering to Christians suffering\npersecution the imprecatory Psalms are a tremendous source of\ncomfort. And those of us who are fighting for the right to life\nof the preborn, or battling social evils such as pornography or\ncrime, are beginning to appreciate what an important weapon God\nhas entrusted to us in the imprecatory Psalms.\n\n\nTHE IMPRECATORY PSALMS\n\nEarly in my Christian walk I encountered the prayers for\njudgement in the Psalms and was quite at loss to know how to\nrespond to them. Prayers such as:\n"Break the arm of the wicked and evil men; call him to account for\nhis wickedness ..." Psalm 10:15 did not seem consistent with the\ngospel of love which I had accepted. Yet Psalm 10:15 was clearly\nmotivated by love for God ("The Lord is King for ever and ever;\nthe nation will perish from His land" 10:16, and "Why does the\nwicked man revile God? 10:13), and by love for the innocent who\nsuffer ("You hear, O Lord, the desire of the afflicted; You\nencourage them, and You listen to their cry, defending the\nfatherless and oppressed, in order that man, who is of the earth,\nmay terrify no more." 10:17-18)\n\nNevertheless, I grew increasingly uncomfortable reading such\ngraphic prayers for God to judge the wicked as: "Pour out your\nwrath on them; let Your fierce anger overtake them" 64:24; "O\nLord, the God avenges, O God who avenges, shine forth. Rise up, O\nJudge of the earth, pay back to the proud what they deserve."\n95:1-2; "Break the teeth in their mouths, O God; ...let them\nvanish like water .. let their arrows be blunted ... The\nrighteous will be glad when they are avenged, when they bathe\ntheir feet in the blood of the wicked. Then men will way, "Surely\nthe righteous still are rewarded; surely there is a God who\njudges the earth.'" 58:6-11\n\nCertainly I wanted God to be honoured and yes I was deeply\ndestressed by the prevalence of evil -  but could I actually pray\nfor God to "pour out His wrath" on the wicked?\n\nThe scripture make it clear that these prayers are not to be\nprayed for own selfish motives, nor against our personal enemies.\nRather they are to be prayed in Christ, for His glory and against\nHis enemies. The psalmist describes the targets of these\nimprecation as: those who devise injustice in their heart and\nwhose hands mete out violence (58:2) those who "boast of evil"\nand "are a disgrace in the eyes of God. Your tongue plots\ndestruction, it is like a sharpened razor, and you who practise\ndeceit. You love evil rather than good, falsehood rather than\nspeaking the truth." 52:1-3; "They crush your people ... They\nslay the widow and the alien; they murder the fatherless." 94:5-\n6; "With cunning they conspire against Your people; they plot\nagainst those You cherish." 83:3; "You hate all who do wrong. You\ndestroy those who tell lies; bloodthirsty and deceitful men the\nLord abhors." 5:5-6.\n\nTo those unrepentant enemies of God the psalmist declares:\n"Surely God will bring you down to everlasting ruin" 52:5;\n"Surely God will crush the heads of His enemies ... of those who\ngo on in their sins" 68:21.\n\nAnd the purpose of these prayers for justice is declared: "Then\nit will be known to the ends of the earth that God rules ..."\n59:13; "to proclaim the powers of God" 68:34; "All kings will bow\ndown to Him and all nations will serve Him " 72:11; "Who knows\nthe power of Your anger? For Your wrath is as great as the fear\nthat is due You. " 90:11\n\nYet despite the fact that 90 of the 150 Psalms include\nimprecations (prayers invoking God's righteous judgement upon the\nwicked) such prayers are rare in the average Western church.\nHowever, amongst the persecuted churches these prayers are much\nmore common.\n\n\nPRAYING AGAINST THE PERSECUTORS\n\nAmidst the burnt out churches and devastation of Marxist Angola I\nfound the survivors of communist persecution including the\ncrippled and maimed, and widows and orphans praying for God to\nstrike down the wicked and remove the persecutors of the Church.\nI was shocked - yet it was Biblical (Even the martyrs in heaven\npray "How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judge\nthe inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?" Revelation\n6:10).\n\nThe initiator of the communist persecution in Angola was Agestino\nNeto. Described as a "drunken, psychotic, marxist poet", Neto had\nbeen installed by Cuban troops as the first dictator of Angola.\nHe boasted that: "Within 20 years there won't be a Bible or a\nchurch left in Angola. I will have eradicated Christianity." Yet\ndespite the vicious wave of church burning and massacres it is\nnot Christianity that was eradicated in Angola but Agestino Neto.\nNeto died in mysterious circumstances on an operating table in\nMoscow.\n\nIn Romania I learnt of a series of remarkable incidents recorded\nof God judging the persecutors of the Church in answer to prayer:\n  *  A communist official ordered a certain pastor to be\n     arrested. the next day the official died of a heart attack.\n  *  Another communist party official ordered that all the Bibles\n     in his district were to be collected and pulped, to be\n     turned into toilet paper. This blasphemous project was in\n     fact carried out. But the next day when the official was\n     medically examined, he was informed that he had terminal\n     cancer. He died shortly afterwards.\n  *  On another occasion, a communist official who had ordered a\n     Baptist church to be demolished by bulldozers died in a car\n     crash the very next day.\n  *  When an order was given to dismantle a place of worship on\n     the mountainside in a forest, the workmen flatly refused to\n     carry out the order. At gunpoint a group of conscripted\n     gypsies also refused to touch the church. In desperation,\n     the communist police forced prisoners at bayonet-point to\n     dismantle the structure. Yet the officer in charge pleaded\n     with the local Christians to pray for him, that God would\n     not judge him. He emphasised that he had nothing against\n     Christians and was only obeying strict orders. The building\n     was in fact reconstructed later, and again used for worship.\n     "They were all seized with Sear and the Name of the Lord\n     Jesus was held in high honour... in this way the Word of the\n     Lord spread widely and grew in power. " Acts 19:17,20\n\nNicolae Ceaucescu the dictator who ordered much of the\npersecution in Romania was overthrown by his own army and\nexecuted on Christmas day, 1989, to joyous shouts of "the\nantiChrist is dead" in the streets. Many testified that this was\nin answer to the fervent prayers of the long suffering people of\nRomania.\n\nAnother persecutor of the Church who challenged God was Samora\nMachel, the first dictator of Marxist Mozambique. Samora Machel\nwas a cannibal who ate human flesh in witchcraft ceremonies in\nthe 1960's. He pledged his soul to Satan and vowed that he would\ndestroy the Church and turn Mozambique into the first truly\nMarxist-Leninist state in Africa. Thousands of churches in\nMozambique were closed confiscated, "nationalised" chained and\npadlocked, burnt down or boarded up. Missionaries were expelled,\nsome being imprisoned first. Evangelism was forbidden. Bibles\nwere ceremonially burnt and tens of thousands of Christians,\nincluding many pastors and elders, were shipped off to\nconcentration camps - most were never seen again.\n\nA month before his sudden death Samora Machel cursed God publicly\nand challenged Him to prove His existence by striking him\n(Machel) dead. On 19 October 1986, while several churches were\nspecifically praying for God to stop the persecution in\nMozambique, Machel's Soviet Tupelov aircraft crashed in a violent\nthunderstorm. The plane crashed 200 metres within South Africa's\nboundary with Mozambique. Amidst the wreckage the marxist plans\nfor overthrowing the government of Malawi were discovered and\npublished. Not only had God judged a blasphemer and a persecutor,\nbut He had also saved a country from persecution.\n\nIn the months leading up to the first multi-party elections in\nZambia many churches fasted and prayed tor God to remove the 27\nyear socialist dictatorship of Kenneth Kaunda. This was done on\n31st October 1991 when Fredrick Chiluba (a man converted to\nChrist whilst imprisoned for opposing Kaunda) was elected\npresident of Zambia and covenanted to make Zambia a Christian\ncountry.\n\nIt is recorded in history that the wicked Mary, Queen of Scots,\ndeclared trembling and in tears: "I am more afraid of John Knox's\nprayers than of an army of ten thousand".\n\nOn 3 April 1993 the Secretary General of the South African\nCommunist Party Chris Hani was shot dead. From the unprecedented\ninternational wave of condolences and adulation reported one\ncould be forgiven for assuming that this man was a saint and a\nmartyr. Certainly it was not the death and resurrection of Christ\nJesus which dominated the thoughts and headlines of South Africa\nthis Easter, but the assassination of Chris Hani.\n\nThe stunning hypocrisy of the situation is that 20 135 people\nwere murdered in South Africa in 1992, yet more collective\nconcern and anguish were reported over the death of the head of\nthe SA Communist Party than for all the thousands of other\nvictims. Indeed the SA government, the international community\nand the mass media have apparently had greater sorrow reported\nover this one death than for all the 50 000 South Africans\nmurdered since 2nd February 1990 when the ANC, SACP and PAC were\nunbanned!\n\nYet as a member of the ANC Revolutionary Council since 1973,\nDeputy Commander of Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) the ANC's "military\nwing" - from 1982, and Chief of Staff of MK from 1987, Chris Hani\nhad approved and ordered bombings and assassinations of many\nunarmed civilians. As Jesus warned: "all who live by the sword\nwill die by the sword " Matt 26:52.\n\nAfter personally confronting Hani about his terrorist activities\nat a press conference in Washington DC (where he publicly\ndeclared his support for Fidel Castro, Col. Gaddafi, Yasser\nArafat and Saddam Hussein and defended the placing of car bombs\nand limpet mines in public places during "the struggle") I told\nhim that I was a Christian and, while I didn't hate him, I did\nhate communism and I was praying for him - that God would either\nbring him to repentance and salvation in Christ, or that God\nwould remove him. He responded by swearing and declaring that he\nwas an atheist.\n\nSeveral other people also prayed that God would either bring Hani\nto repentance or remove him. Similarly several churches in\nAmerica have begun to pray the imprecatory Psalms against\nunrepentant abortionists. In one town 8 abortionists were struck\ndown, with heart attacks, strokes, car accidents and cancer,\nwithin months of these public prayers for God to stop these\nkillers of preborn babies.\n\nSome praised God for His righteous acts of judgement and quoted:\n"When justice is done, it brings joy to the righteous and terror\nto evildoers " Proverbs 21:15. Others were shocked that any\nChristian could express satisfaction at the misfortune of any -\neven of the blatantly wicked. Yet the Apostles prayed imprecatory\nprayers (Acts 13:8-12; Galatians 1:8-9; 2 Tim 4:14-15) and so did\nour Lord (Matt 11:20-24).\n\nWhat then should our attitude towards the imprecatory Psalms be?\nShould we be praying the Psalms? To tackle these thorny issues I\nwould like to present a short summary of an excellent book, "War\nPsalms of the Prince of Peace - Lessons From The Imprecatory\nPsalms" by James E Adams, (published by the Presbyterian and\nReformed Publishing Company):\n\nOur Lord Jesus Christ & His apostles used the Psalms constantly\nin teaching men to know God. The New Testament (NT) quotes the\nOld Testament (OT) over 283 times. 41% of all OT quotes in the NT\nare from the Psalms. Christ Himself alluded to the Psalms over 50\ntimes. The Psalms are the Prayer Book of the Bible.\n\n\n1. Are the imprecatory Psalms the oracles of God?\n\nSome Christian commentators & theologians reject these Psalms as\n"devilish", "diabolical ", "unsuited to the church", and "Not God\n's pronouncements of His wrath on the wicked; but the prayers of\na man for vengeance on his enemies, just the opposite of Jesus'\nteaching that we should love our enemies. "\n\nYet 2 Tim 3:16-17 declares:\n"All Scripture is God breathed and is useful for teaching,\nrebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the\nman of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. "\n(see also 2 Peter 3:15-16).\n\nThe fact that something in the Word of God is beyond our\ncomprehension is not grounds to denying or even questioning its\ninspiration. To make ourselves the judge of what is good or evil\nis to impudently take the place of God.\n\nDo we imagine ourselves to be holier than God? Wrong ideas of God\nhave led many to become "evangelic plastic surgeons who have made\nit their job to "clean up" God's Word according to their own\nideas of what is proper. They have forgotten that it is God alone\nwho must determine what Christianity is and what is suitable for\nHis Church. The essence of what many have done is to question the\nauthority of God's Word (like Eve's original sin of listening to\nSatan's question "Yes, hath God said... ?").\n\nThe Psalms are part of God's revelation of Himself and His\nattributes, and they are reaffirmed by the NT as the\nauthoritative Word of God. Those imprecatory Psalms which these\nevangelical plastic surgeons reject as "unsuited" and "unworthy"\nfor the Church are the very Psalms Christ used to testify about\nHimself (eg: Mark 12:36; Matt 22:43-44) and which the Apostles\nused as authoritative Scripture (eg: Acts 1:16-20; Acts 4:25; Heb\n4:7). See also: 2 Samuel 23:1-2.\n\nCH Spurgeon said concerning the imprecatory Psalms, (especially\nPs 109):\n"Truly this is one of the hard places of Scripture, a passage\nwhich the soul trembles to read, yet it is not ours to sit in\njudgement upon it, but to bow our ear to what the Lord would\nspeak to us therein. "\n\nThe rejection of any part of God's Word is a rejection of the\ngiver of that Word, God Himself.\n\n\n2. Who is praying these Psalms?\n\nChrist quoted the Psalms not merely as prophesy; He actually\nspoke the Psalms as His own words. The Psalms occupied an\nenormous place in the life of our Lord. He used it as His prayer\nbook and song book - from the Synagogue to the festivals and at\nthe Last Supper.\n\nOn the cross Christ quoted from the Psalms - not as some ancient\nauthority that He adapted for His own use, but as His very own\nwords - the words of the Lord's Anointed - which as David's Son\nHe truly was.\n"Father, into your hands I commit my Spirit" Ps 31:5\n"My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?" Ps 22:1\n\nIn His ministry Christ foretells what He will say as the Judge on\nthe day of judgement, and He quotes the Psalms in doing so!\nMatt 7:23 "Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away\nfrom me, you evildoers'. " Ps 6:8\n\nIn Heb 10:5 the apostle attributes Ps 40:6-8 directly to Christ\nalthough nowhere in the Gospels is Christ recorded as having said\nthese words. Similarly Hebrews 2 : 12 attributes Ps 22:22\ndirectly to Christ despite there being no record of His having\nspoken these words while on earth. Clearly the apostles believed\nChrist is speaking in the Psalms.\n\nChrist came to establish His kingdom and to extend His mercy in\nall the earth. But let us never forget that Jesus will come again\nto execute Judgement on the wicked.\nDavid as the anointed king of the chosen people of God was a\nprototype of Jesus Christ. Acts 2:30:\n"being therefore a prophet, ... he foresaw and spoke of the\nresurrection of Christ. "\nDavid was a witness to Christ in his office, in his lite, and in\nhis words. The same words which David spoke, the future Messiah\nspoke through him. The prayers of David were prayed also by\nChrist. Or better Christ Himself prayed these Psalms through His\nforerunner David.\n\nThe imprecatory Psalms are expressions of the infinite justice of\nGod, of His indignation against wrong doing, and His compassion\nfor the wronged.\n\n\n3. But what about the Psalms of repentance?\n\nChrist is also the Lamb of God, the substitutionary sacrifice for\nour sins. Christ in the day of His crucifixion was charged with\nthe sin of His people. He appropriated to Himself those debts for\nwhich He had made Himself responsible. Our Lord was the\nsubstitution for the sinner. He took the sinners place (Isaiah\n53).\n\n"God made Him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in Him we\nmight become the righteousness of God. " 2 Cor 5:21\n\nIn history the Psalms, especially the imprecatory Psalms, have\nbeen understood to have been the prayers of Christ by: St\nAugustine, Jerome, Ambrose, Tertullian, Luther and many others.\nAll the Psalms are the voice of Christ. Christ is praying the\nimprecatory Psalms! All the Psalms are messianic. It is the Lord\nJesus Christ who is praying these prayers of vengeance. It is\nonly right for the righteous King of Peace to ask God to destroy\nHis enemies.\n\nThese prayers signal an alarm to all who are still enemies of\nKing Jesus. His prayers will be answered! God's Word is revealed\nupon all who oppose Christ. Anyone who rejects God's way of\nforgiveness in the cross of Christ will bear the dreadful curses\nof God.\n\nHe who prays Psalm 69:23-28 will one day make this prayer a\nreality when He declares to those on His left:\n"Depart from me you who are cursed into the eternal fire prepared\nfor the devil and his angels. " Matt 25:41\n\nAll the enemies of the Lord need to hear these Psalms. *God's\nKingdom is at War.* The powers of evil will tall and God alone\nwill reign forever!\n"With justice He judges and makes war...out of His mouth comes a\nsharp sword with which to strike down the nations. He will rule\nthem with an iron sceptre; He treads the winepress of the fury of\nthe wrath of God Almighty...King of Kings and Lord of Lords. "\nRev 19 : 15\n\n\n4. Are Jesus' prayers contradictory?\n\nWhat about Jesus' command to love our enemies and to bless those\nwho curse us (Matt 5:44)?\n\nChrist is of course the loving and merciful Saviour who forgives\nsin; but He is also the awesome Judge who is coming in Judgement\non those who disobey His Gospel.\n\n"God is just. He will pay back trouble to those who trouble you\nand give relief to you who are troubled...This will happen when\nthe Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with His\npowerful angels. He will punish those who do not obey the Gospel\nof our Lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting\ndestruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from\nthe majesty of His power on the day He comes to be glorified in\nHis holy people and to be marvelled at among au those who have\nbelieved. " 2 Thess 1:6-10\n\nJesus has power on earth to forgive sins, and He has power on\nearth to execute judgement upon His enemies. In the Psalms we see\nboth the vengeance and the love ot God.\n\nEven in the N.T. & in the Gospels we see imprecations.\n"Woe to you,...hypocrites...blind guides...blind fools...full of\ngreed and self indulgence...whitewashed tombs...you snakes! You\nbrood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to Hell ? "\nMatt 23\n\nIn Matt 26:23-24 Christ quotes from Ps 69 and 109 to refer to His\nbetrayal by Judas.\n\nWe also need to acknowledge that Christ's prayers of blessing are\nnot for all. In John 17:6-9 it is clear that Christ is only\npraying to the elect of God - those who have:\n"obeyed your Word"... "accepted" God's Word ... and have\n"believed ". (see Luke 10:8-16 - Those who reject the\nmessage of God's kingdom will be judged.)\n\n\n5. May we pray the imprecatory Psalms?\n\nMartin Luther pointed out that when one prays: "Hallowed be Thy\nName, Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done " then "he must put all\nthe opposition to this in one pile and say: 'Curses, maledictions\nand disgrace upon every other name and every other kingdom. May\nthey be ruined and torn apart and may all their schemes and\nwisdom and plans run aground' . "\n\nTo pray tor the extension of God's kingdom is to solicit the\ndestruction of all other kingdoms, eg: Dan 2:44: "The God of\nheaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed ... it\nwill crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it\nwill itself endure forever. "\n\n* Advance and victory for the Church means defeat and retreat for\nthe kingdom of darkness. *\n\nThere is a life & death struggle between two kingdoms. The Church\ncannot exclude hatred tor satan's kingdom from its love for God's\nkingdom. God's kingdom cannot come without satan's kingdom being\ndestroyed. God's will cannot be done on earth without the\ndestruction of evil. The glory of God demands the destruction of\nevil. Instead of being influenced by a sickly sentimentalism\nwhich insists upon the assumed, but really non-existent, rights\nof man - we should focus instead upon the rights of God.\n\nNote Psalm 83 where the Psalmist prays against those who "plot\ntogether" against God and His people:\n"Cover their faces with shame so that men will seek your Name O\nLord... Do to them as You did to Midian, as you did to Sisera and\nJabin at the river Kishon, who perished at Endor and became like\nrefuse on the ground. "\n\nThe story of Sisera in the book of Judges (Chapter 4 and 5)\nprovides a vivid example of God's judgement on the wicked. Sisera\n"cruelly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years" and they\n"cried to the Lord for help" Judges 4:3. In response to those\nprayers: "The Lord routed Sisera and all his chariots and army by\nthe sword, and Sisera abandoned his chariot and fled on foot...\nAll the troops of Sisera fell by the sword; not a man was left. "\nJudges 4:15-16\n\nThe account then goes on to describe how Sisera escaped to the\ntent of Jael where she lulled him into a false sense of safety\nand then drove a tent peg through his temple with a hammer. The\nsong of victory by Deborah and Barak celebrated the crushing of\nthe head of Sisera in graphic detail (Judges 5:25-27). And it is\nthis that Psalm 83 implores God to again do to His enemies.. "As\nyou did to Sisera ..."\n\n\n6. The blessings of obedience and the curse of disobedience\n\nThe imprecatory Psalms are fully consistent with the Law of God:\n     "If you do not carefully follow all the words of this Law,\n     which are written in this book, and do not revere this\n     glorious and awesome Name - the Lord your God - the Lord\n     will send fearful plagues on you and your descendants. He\n     will bring upon you all the diseases of Egypt that you\n     dreaded, and they will cling to you. The Lord will also\n     bring on you every kind of sickness and disaster not\n     recorded in this Book of the Law until you are\n     destroyed...because you did not obey the Lord your God ...\n     so it will please Him to ruin and destroy you. You will be\n     uprooted from the land you are entering to possess. "\n     Deuteronomy 28:58-63\n\nThe covenant God made with His people included curses for\ndisobedience as well as blessings for obedience. Deuteronomy 27\nrecords the formal giving and receiving of the covenant terms in\nan awesome account:\n"The Levites shall recite to all the people of Israel in a loud\nvoice:\n"Cursed is the man who carves an image or casts an idol - a thing\ndetestable to the Lord, the work of the craftsman's hands - and\nsets it up in secret. "\nThen all the people shall say, "Amen!" "\n"Cursed is the man who dishonours his father or his mother...\n"Cursed is the man who moves his neighbour's boundary stone...\n"Cursed is the man who leads the blind astray on the roads...\n"Cursed is the man who withholds justice from the alien, the\nfatherless or the widow...\n"Cursed is the man who kills his neighbour secretly...\n"Cursed is the man who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent\nperson.\n"Cursed is the man who does not uphold the words of the Law by\ncarrying them out.\nThen all the people shall say, "Amen!" " Deut 27:14-26\n\nThe New Testament confirms that the inevitable consequence of\nrejecting Christ is the curse. "If anyone does not love the\nLord - a curse be on him. " 1 Corinthians 16:22\n\n(See also: Romans 12:19-21; Hebrews 1:1-3; 3:7-12; 3:1519; 10:26-\n31; 12:14-29.)\n\n\n7. How can we preach these prayers?\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ is an army under orders.\nScripture constitutes the official dispatch from the Commander-\nin-Chief. But we have a problem: those who are called to pass on\nthose orders to others are refusing to do so. How then can we\nexpect to be a united, effective army? Is it any wonder that the\ntroops have lost sight of their commission to demolish the\nstrongholds of the kingdom of darkness? If the Church does not\nhear the battle cries of her Captain, how will she follow Him\nonto the battlefield?\n\nPastors are commissioned to pass on the orders of the Church's\nCommander, never withholding or changing His words. One whose job\nis to carry dispatches to troops in wartime would face certain\nand severe punishment if he dared to amend the general's orders.\nThe pastor's charge is of greater importance than that of a\ncourier in any earthly army. There's no place tor the dispatcher\nto decide he doesn't agree with his Commander's strategy.\n\nWhen Jesus Christ sent seventy-two disciples on a preaching\nmission, He told them to proclaim the coming of God's Kingdom (Lk\n10:9) - that is, to announce that people must submit to God's\nrule in their lives. Jesus instructed them to pray for peace on\nany house they approach, assuring them that if anyone rejected\nit, the peace would return on the disciples (verse 5). But we\nmust consider what He said they should do if their message were\nrejected - that is, if the hearers persisted in rebellion against\nGod's rule - "But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go\ninto its 'streets and say, 'Even the dust of your town that\nsticks to our feet we wipe off against you. Yet be sure of this:\nThe kingdom of God is near"' Luke 10:11.\n\nWhat would be the result of that denunciation? I tell you, it\nwill be more bearable on that day for Sodom [on which God sent\nfire from Heaven in judgement for its wickedness] than for that\ntown (verse 12). Immediately Jesus added curses on Korazin,\nBethsaida, and Capernaum tor their rejection of His message\n(verses 13-15). He then explained to the disciples the great\nauthority He had given them: "He who listens to you listens to\nMe; he who rejects you rejects Me; but he who rejects Me rejects\nhim who sent Me " (verse 16). This is the fundamental basis tor\ncalling down God's curses on anyone: his persistent rebellion\nagainst God's authority expressed in His Law and the ministry of\nHis servants.\n\nWe need to clearly and forcefully proclaim the war cries of the\nPrince of Peace. Only then will the Church awake from its\nlethargy and once again enter the battle. If we tail to pass on\nthe battle cry then a lack of urgency and confusion in the ranks\nwill be inevitable.\n\nLike Psalm 1 our preaching needs to clearly show the blessings of\nobedience and the curse of disobedience. The eternal truth is\nthat God cannot be mocked. Whatever a man sows - that shall he\nreap (Galatians 6:7). The curses pronounced on disobedience in\nDeut 28:47-53 were fulfilled in detail in Samaria (2 Kings\n6:2&29) and in Judea (AD 70). The wrath of God upon covenant\nbreakers is real.\n\nThe "I" of the Psalms is Jesus Christ. The "we" of the Psalms\nincludes those of us in the Lord Jesus. The enemies are not our\nown, individually, but those of the Lord and of His Church. The\nPsalms are ot Christ as Prophet, Priest, and King. They record\nChrist's march in victory against the kingdom of darkness. As\nChrist is the author of the Psalms, so, too, is He the final\nfulfilment of the covenant on which they are based. God will\nanswer the psalmist's prayers completely in Jesus Christ on the\nfinal day of judgment. While on earth Jesus foretold the day when\nHe will say: "But those enemies of Mine who did not want Me to be\nKing over them - bring them here and kill them in front of Me"\nLuke 19:27.\n\nA fatal end awaits everyone who refuses to acknowledge and to\nobey Jesus as King and Lord. Hearing expositions of these war\npsalms of the Prince of Peace will remind His people that God's\nkingdom is at war! The kingdom of darkness is being overcome by\nthe kingdom of Jesus Christ, a war in which each local\ncongregation of believers plays a vital part. You must rally your\nbattalion to put on the whole armour of God, including "the sword\nof the Spirit, which is the Word of God " Eph 6:17. That battle-\nreadiness also involves "pray(ing) in the Spirit on all occasions\nwith all kinds of prayers and requests n Eph 6:18.\n\nChrist teaches His army to pray for the utter destruction of the\nenemies of God as the psalmist did: "Pour out Your wrath on the\nnations that do not acknowledge You, on the kingdoms that do not\ncall on Your Name" Ps 79:6.\n\nTo deal with the very real hurts and injustices in this world it\nis necessary for us to pray for God's justice. Those who are\npersecuted need the comfort of these prayers.\n\n"Let the saints rejoice in His honour and sing for joy...May the\npraise of God be in their mouths and a double-edged sword in\ntheir hands, to inflict vengeance on the nations and punishment\non the peoples, to bind their kings with fetters, their nobles\nwith shackles of iron, to carry out the sentences written against\nthem. This is the glory of all His saints. Praise the Lord. " Ps\n149:5-9\n\nPrayer is, in fact, spiritual warfare. One weapon is prayer for\nconversion of spiritual enemies; another is prayer for judgement\non those who finally refuse to be converted. We handicap the army\nof God when we refuse to use both of these great weapons that He\nhas given us. It is at all times a part of the task of the people\nnf God to destroy evil.\n\nIf you have been guilty of dulling your sword, by neglecting or\nundermining these psalms, repent of that sin, sharpen your sword\nanew, and go forth to do battle in the Name and for the Glory of\nJesus - until "the knowledge of the Lord will cover the earth as\nthe waters cover the sea" Hab 2:14.\n\nThe full book "War Psalms of the Prince of Peace " is available,\nat R25, from Frontline Fellowship, PO Box 74 Newlands, 7725 RSA.
But wouldn't that go for any sin.  My father told me when he was growing\nup Catholics were not allowed to associate with anyone who was divorced.\nThere are a few verses prohibitting divorce.  Somehow, divorce became\nacceptable (even in Catholicism anullments).  Certainly it is no longer\na sin to associate with a divorced person.  The point is that each person\nhas their own temptations to deal with.  Paul repeatedly talks about the\n"thorn" in his side, some think it refers to lust, others pride, but\nwho knows.  Whatever the thorn was, apparently it was not "compatible"\nwith Christianity, yet does that make his epistles any less?  The Bible\nwarns us against judging, greed, anxiety, impure thoughts, bearing grudges,\netc., etc.  I suppose we should seek out all the so-called Christians\nwho have entertained impure thoughts and oust them.  All those who have\ngiven in to greed, get 'em outta here.  Jesus pointed out that he\nwas the physician for the sinners.  Any attempts to make homosexuals\nfeel unwelcome because of our discomfort with homosexuality is incompatible\nwith Christianity.  Is our hatred so deep that rather than see someone\ntry to become closer to Jesus, we need to keep them away.  Does Jesus need\nus to screen out those guilty of a particular sin.  Do we really mistrust \nJesus when he says he can forgive any sin?\n\nThink about it.  Among the people Jesus encountered were sinners and\nthe Pharisees.  The sinners he embraced and forgave.  The Pharisees,\nhypocritcal, unmerciful, self-righteous, pointed out others sins and\ndid not seek and thus did not gain forgiveness of their own sins.  What\nI take from this and other verses is that if we do not admit our sins,\nthose sins will not be forgiven.  And since those guilty of even one sin\nare guilty of the whole law, those not repenting the judging of others\nare guilty, as guilty as if they committed the same sin they judged others\nof.\n\nThe poor in spirit, meek, humble, merciful, pure of heart, peacemakers, \nthose who thirst for justice, those who suffer for His sake are blessed.
It is possible that the individual saw a true prophetic vision, but that he\ninterpreted the scale of time and space according to his material con-\nsciousness, translating the supersensible perceptions of a plane above\nthat of time and space into an immediate worldly context -- and getting it\nwrong.  Not that he did it rationally, but rather that unconsciously the\nperceptions became clothed in material images, instead of remaining in the\nrealm of the potential and not-yet-time-space-bound.  This difficulty of\ntranslating prophetic vision into a concrete when and where has always been\ndifficult, even for the prophets of old.  That is why their prophecies are\nso often subject to multiple interpretations.  Likewise, the Apostles seemed\nto feel that the return of the Lord was to be "very soon" in the sense of\nperhaps the same generation. Yet the meaning of "very soon" has proven to\nbe different than they could grasp.  Prophetic vision tends to telescope\ntime, so that things that are far off appear to be very close.\n\nAnother possibility is that the vision was one of a real event preparing to\nhappen, again in the realm of the potential-but-not-yet-manifest and which\nwas thwarted by other forces, including possibly an act of divine mercy.\n\nThere are many concrete prophecies being made these days by devout and\nsincere and sober Christians (and others too).  It seems that great coming \nevents are really casting their shadow before their arrival in these \n"apocalyptic" times.  The various predictions (I'm talking about those that\nappear to be sincere and sober) are hard to accept, yet hard to ignore com-\npletely.  One has the feeling "something is about to start to get ready to \nbegin to commence to happen".  We are living, as the Chinese saying goes,\nin interesting times.\n\nAs for how to discriminate, the Bible doesn't help much.  There is an Old\nTestament passage (I forget where it is) that says you will know whether\na prophet is true by whether or not his prophecy comes to pass.  That\nhelps eliminate the failures after the fact, but in the case of an earth-\nquake it is small comfort.  It seems to me that all prophecies that give\nspecific times and places and events should be suspect, not in that they\nare necessarily false, but in the sense stated above, that all such visions\nare subject to mistranslation from the plane of prophetic vision to the\nplane of earthly time and space.\n\nFor what it is worth, Rudolf Steiner once was asked whether a modern initiate \ncould see into the future and predict coming events.  His answer was that \nit would be possible but then he would have to withdraw from active parti-\ncipation in them, including proclaiming what he saw.  If this is in fact\na spiritual law, then the answer to your question about how to discriminate\nis that the one who makes such prophecies is probably violating that law,\nknowingly or unknowingly, and as such his message should be considered\na priori to be dubious.  I.e. I would expect that those capable of making\ntrue predictions and giving accurate expression to them would not do so in \nthe way that the prophet of the Oregon earthquake did.  However, I can\nsympathize with the person who published the prophecy. Given the same\noverwhelming experience that he apparently had,  I too might feel impelled, \nand even commissioned by God to tell my fellow human beings about what \nI had seen.\n\nGerry Palo (73237.2006@compuserve.com)
: I heard on the radio today about a Christian student conference where\n: Christians were called to "repent" of America's "national" sins, such\n: as sexual promiscuity.\n: \n: To which I reply: ...whoa there!\n: \n: How can I repent of _someone else's_ sin?   I can't.\n: \n: And when I claim to "repent" of someone else's sin, am I not in fact\n: _judging_ him?  Jesus equipped us to judge activities but warned us\n: not to judge people. "Judge not that ye be not judged."\n: \n: C. S. Lewis made the same point in an essay after World War II,\n: when some Christian leaders in Britain were urging "national repentance"\n: for the horrors (sins???) of World War II.\n: -- \n\nI see your point, but I cannot more strongly disagree.\n\nTo repent means to turn around.  We, as a nation, have behaved incredibly\narrogantly toward God condoning, encouraging, and even forcing folks to\nparticipate in activity directly opposed to the written Word of God.  We\nhave arrogantly set our nation far above the God who created it and allowed\nus the luxury of living in this land.  We have set a bad example for other\nnations.  We've slaughtered unborn children by the millions.  We have\nstricken the name of God from the classroom.  We've cheated God out of the\nhonor due Him at every turn, and we owe God an apology every bit as public\nas our sins have been.\n\nWhen Jesus said "Judge not that ye be not judged", he was not addressing\nthose like John the Baptist who had repented and were calling others to\nrepent.  He was addressing those who remained in sin while heaping down\ncondemnation on others for their sins.  His message to us all was to remove\nthe log from our own eye before removing the speck from our brother's.  But\nHe also said to rebuke and to reprove.  Don't forget that this is a command\ntoo.\n\nOur problem today is that we tend to judge and condemn as though we were\nrebuking and we tend to neglect bringing folks back to the Lord with the\nexcuse that we don't want to judge anyone.\n\nIn truth, what we need to do is to judge less and call others to repent more\nand to be able to distinguish between the two in our own motives.  Call sin\nwhat it is and do so openly.  Let it's charge fall correctly where it should.\nBut instead of running someone into hell over it, pull them out of their\nhellward path and onto the heavenward path.\n\n--\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n	"I deplore the horrible crime of child murder...\n	 We want prevention, not merely punishment.\n	 We must reach the root of the evil...\n	 It is practiced by those whose inmost souls revolt\n	 from the dreadful deed...\n	 No mater what the motive, love of ease,\n		or a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent,\n		the woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed...\n	 but oh! thrice guilty is he who drove her\n		to the desperation which impelled her to the crime."

One time, after several apparitions\npassed, The Lady finally said, "I am the Immaculate Conception".\nSo, Bernadette, was so happy and repeated these words over and\nover in her mind so as not to forget it before she told the\npriest who was asking.  So, when she told the priest, the\npriest was shocked and asked Bernadette, "Do you know what\nyou are talking about?".  Bernadette did not know what exactly\nit meant but she was just too happy to have the answer for\nthe priest.  The priest continued with, "How did you remember\nthis if you do not know?".  Bernadette answered honestly that\nshe had to repeat it over and over in her mind while on her\nway to the priest...\n\nThe priest knew about the dogma being four years old then.\nBut Bernadette did not know and yet she had the answer which\nthe priest finally observed and took as proof of an authentic\npersonal revelation of Our Lady to Bernadette.\n\n(Note: This Lady of Lourdes shrine has a spring of water which\nour lady requested Bernadette to dig up herself with her\nbare hands in front of pilgrims.  At the start little\nwater flowed but after several years there is more water \nflowing.)
There are exactly ZERO verses that "clearly" address the issues.\n\n\nThe kind of interpretation I see as "incredibly perverse" is that applied\nto the story of Sodom as if it were a blanket equation of homosexual\nbehavior and rape.  Since Christians citing the Bible in such a context\nshould be presumed to have at least READ the story, it amounts to slander\n-- a charge that homosexuality == rape -- to use that against us.\n\n\nThe moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of _porneia_\nin this.  I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of\nactivity that could be named by "fornication" or "theft" or "coveting" or\n"reviling" or "drunkenness" which would well deserve condemnation.  We may\nor may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very\nfact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at\nall "clear" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest\nin MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions,\nwith all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated\nChristian discussion of ALL these areas.\n\nHomosexual behavior is no different.  I (and the other gay Christians I\nknow) are adamant in condemning rape -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and\nchild molestation -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and even the possibly\n"harmless" but obsessive kinds of sex -- heterosexual or homosexual --\nthat would stand condemned by Paul in the very continuation of the chapter\nyou cite [may I mildly suggest that what *Paul* does in his letter that\nyou want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning?]\n\n	"'I am free to do anything,' you say.  Yes, but not everything\n	is for my good.  No doubt I am free to do anything, but I for one\n	will not let anything make free with me."  [1 Cor. 6:12]\n\nWhich is a restatement that we must have no other "god" before God.  A\ncommandment neither I nor any other gay Christian wishes to break.  Some\npeople are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior.\nIt is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it's a secondary\nargument from the 'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such\nbehavior as to equate it with the rape of God's messengers.\n\nI won't deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially.\nFundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your\nassumption that you know what _porneia_ means.  There are plenty of\nlaws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of\nwhich Christians ignore completely.  They never even BOTHER to examine\nthem.  They just *assume* that they know which ones are "moral" and\nwhich ones are "ritual."  Well, I have news for you.  Any anthropology\ncourse should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories\nin an awful lot of societies (we have them too, but buried pretty deep).\nAnd I cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of Leviticus\nfrom the "ritual law" which NO Christian I know feels applies to us.\n\nI'm dead serious here.  When people start going on (as they do in this\nmatter) about how "repulsive" and "unnatural" our acts are -- and what\ndo they know about it, huh? -- it is a solid clue to the same sort of\narbitrary cultural inculcations as the American prejudice against eating\ninsects.  On what basis, other than assuming your conclusion, can you\nsay that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part\nof the ritual law?\n\nFor those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can\nbe "law" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about)\nit is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to\ndetermine why you "pick" one and ignore another.  I frankly think the\nwhole effort misguided.  Reread Paul: "No doubt I am free to do anything."\nBut Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this,\nthe Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor.  If you cannot go\nthrough Leviticus and decide each "command" there on that basis, then\nyour own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy.  In this\ncontext, it is remarkably offensive to say:\n\n\nWell, la-ti-da.  So what?  This is almost as slimey an argument as the\none that homosexuality == rape.  I know of no one who argues seriously\n(though one can always find jokers) in "defense" of bestiality.  It is\nabsolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do*\nraise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human\nadult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant\nthan the laws of kashrut.  If you cannot address the actual issues, you\nare being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the\nworld.  If *you* want to address bestiality, that is YOUR business, not\nmine.  And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in\nour culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing\nus as human beings.  You want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest means\nyou can think of to do so.\n\nJesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length,\nthe central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to\nlove one another, and ALL else depends on that.  Gay and lesbian Christ-\nians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get\nin return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues.\n\nChristians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every\ncorner of USENET and the world, and ALL they ever do is spout these same\nold verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never\neven read), in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with\nthe vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can\nmanage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great\nemotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even\ntaking the trouble to find out what it is.\n\nSuch behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ.\nWHY, for God's precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to\ncondemn people you don't know and won't even take the trouble to LISTEN\nto BEFORE you start your condemnations?  Is that loving your neighbor?\nGod forbid!  Is THAT how you obey the repeated commands to NOT judge or\ncondemn others?  Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time in\ninsisting on this than the half-dozen obscure words in Paul that you are\nSO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do.\n\nWhy, for God's sake?\n\n	"For God did not send the Son into the world\n	to condemn the world,\n	but that the world might be saved through him.\n	Whoever believes in him is not condemned,\n	but whoever does not believe has already been condemned\n	for refusing to believe in the name of God's only Son.\n	Now the judgment is this:\n	the light has come into the world,\n	but men have preferred darkness to light\n	because their deeds were evil.\n	For everyone who practices wickedness\n	hates the light,\n	and does not come near the light\n	for fear his deeds will be exposed.\n	But he who acts in truth\n	comes into the light,\n	so that it may be sh0own\n	that his deeds are done in God."	John 3:17-21\n\nFor long ages, we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from\nevil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and\nrejected.  Some of us despaired and took to courses that probably *do*\nshow a sinful shunning of God's light.  Blessed are those whose spirits\nhave been crushed by the self-righteous; they shall be justified.\n\nHowever, we have seen the Truth, and the Truth is the light of humanity;\nand we now know that it is not WE who fear the light, but our enemies who\nfear the light of our witness and will do everything they can to shadow\nit with the darkness of false witness against us.
: Ok, what's more important to gay Christians?  Sex, or Christianity?\n: Christianity I would hope.  Would they be willing to forgo sex\n: completely, in order to avoid being a stumbling block to others,\n: to avoid the chance that their interpretation might be wrong,\n: etc?  If not, why not?  Heterosexuals abstain all the time.\n: (It would be nice if protestant churches had celibate orders\n: to show the world that sex is not the important thing in life)\n\nThe difference is that straight members are given the choice of\nabstaining or not, and celibacy is recognized as a gift, given only\nto some.  Gays are told that, as a condition of acceptance, they\n_must_ be celibate.  I don't believe that God gives me a forced choice\nbetween having a relationship with God and expressing my heterosexuality\n(within the context of a faithful relationship).  Nor do I believe\nthat God gives that forced choice to gays.  Sex or Christianity is a\nfalse dichotomy.\n\n: To tell the truth, gay churches remind me a lot of Henry the VIII\n: starting the Church of England in order to get a divorce (or is\n: this a myth).  Note that I am not denying that gay Christians are\n: Christian.\n\nFor my part, gay churches remind me of blacks starting their own churches\neither because they were not allowed at all in the white churches, or, at\nbest, only with special restrictions that did not apply to white members.
Perhaps because there is a connection here that is not there in the Mexican\nvariant you bring up.\n\nThat is, many (not all) extreme fundamentalist Christians use the excuse of\nteaching their children Biblical morality to justify this sort of mistreatment.\nI do not see many Mexicans using their Mexican heritage as an excuse for abuse.\n\nIt is indeed this judgemental, controlling legalism of many fundamentalist\nChristians that has led me to reject that branch of our faith as not true\nto the Gospel of Christ, the gospel of love.\n\nI have seen this sort of thing too often, even amoung my own relatives, to\nbelieve there is no relationship.  Judgementalism often leads to overly\nstrict, and thus abusive, discipline of children.\n[This is not restricted to just Christian fundamentalism, it is found in\nmany extreme sects of other legalistic religions].\n\nI, too, am a Christian.  But I do not condone the use of the Bible to justify\nthis sort of abuse.  I believe that it is only by exposing the horrors of\nthe misapplication of the Biblical concept of discipline that such abuses\ncan be stopped.\n\nJust because someone is also a Christian does not mean we must identify\neith them. This sort of sin needs to be made public.
...\n\nThanks for posting the exact wording which I had not seen\npreviously. The part I quote above seems to me to indicate\ndisapproval of capital punishment - it is to be used only when\nother means are not sufficient; I would say this is a stronger\nrestriction than saying that capital punishment is useable when\njustifiable. I would certainly say there are cases where a\ncrime justifies death (perhaps this is the Old Testament\ninterpretation), but my reverence for life would say that I\nwould oppose the actual infliction of the death penalty (a New\nTestament interpretation?). It is a matter for debate whether\nthe death penalty works to keep the peace in a way that\nnon-violent provisions do not. I don't believe it does, and I\nwould certainly observe that in the USA, where you have the\ndeath penalty, there is a far higher murder rate than here in\nthe UK, where we do not.
There is no reason to believe that Paul's thorn in the flesh was \na sin in his life.  That makes little sense in the light of Paul'\nwritings taken in totality.  He writes of how he presses for the\nmark, and keeps his body submitted.  No doubt Paul had to struggle\nwith the flesh just like every Christian.  Paul does associate his \nthorn with a Satanic messenger, and with physical infirmities and tribulation,\nbut not with a sin in his life.
[does he believe in predestination]\n\nreally?  you may be right, but i'd like proof.  as far as i know (and\ni am not a div school student!) the catholic church does not seem to\naccept predestination.  my chaplain told me "beware of greeks bearing\ngifts" with reference to this doctrine: it seems to have the curious\nresult that human beings are not held responsible for their own\nactions!  i'll answer how you deal with this in a minute.\n\n\nright.  that doesn't really seem like predestination to me, but i'll\ncontinue with what you're saying....\n\n\nthis is really confusing to me, especially since i still believe that\nchrist jesus died for ALL of us.  preknowledge of obstinacy seems\nlike an awfully convoluted way to account for a couple of verses.  but\nthen, i am not really biblically supported in this opinion -- or am i?\nothers?\n\n\nso God uses grace like margarine: he only spreads it where it's needed\nand not where it isn't?  and so there are the saved and the not-saved,\nand nothing in between.  hmmmm.\n\n\nalthough i realize this doctrine was not originally intended to cause\nsocial problems, it ends up doing just that -- if there is supposed to\nbe some sort of "sign" that someone is elect, like lots of children or\nsuccess at work, then those who have a good life on earth will go\naround thinking that those who don't are doomed to hell.\n\nin a way, though, this sounds like the opposite idea -- those doomed\nto hell will have a great life on earth.  that's almost like the\nconverse of what i believe -- responsibility for what we do now will\nbe punished after we die.  you're saying what we get after we die has\na direct bearing on how we live now?  strange....\n \n\nso sin is either punished now or later -- and not both?  what if it's\n sort of half-punished?  are there any grey areas in this doctrine?\n\n [my stuff deleted]\n >We should stop the slaughter of the innocent (cf Proverbs 24.11-12), but\n >does that mean that Christians should support a war in Bosnia with the\n >U.S. or even the U.N. involved?  I do not think so, but I am an\n >isolationist, and disagree with foreign adventures in general.  But in\n >the case of Bosnia, I frankly see no excuse for us getting militarily\n >involved, it would not be a "just war."  "Blessed" after all, "are the\n >peacemakers" was what Our Lord said, not the interventionists.  Our\n >actions in Bosnia must be for peace, and not for a war which is\n >unrelated to anything to justify it for us.\n\n the idea (well, my idea) would be that you would intervene to\n establish peace and stop the atrocities.  i'm not suggesting wwIII.  i\n don't really understand what you mean by a "just war".  of course i am\n not an isolationist, although i see some merit in not jumping in at\n the first opportunity (can you say kuwait?).  we happen to be a big\n country with a lot of resources (as well as a lot of debt), and this\n gives us some responsibility in the world, whether we like it or not.\n flashbacks of wwII, as well as vietnam, should be haunting us.\n\n yet another difference of opinion.  so be it.\n\n >Andy Byler\n\n thank you for answering; i hope you don't take any of my comments as\n flames, but instead as expressions of interest.
: Lets talk about principles. If we accept that God sets the\n: standards for what ought to be included in Scripture - then we\n: can ask:\n: 1. Is it authoritative?\n\n"Authoritative" is not a quality of the writing itself- it is a statement\nby the community of faith whether it will accept the writing as normative.\n\n: 2. Is it prophetic?\n\nHow is "prophecy" to be defined? If it is "speaking forth" of God's message,\nmuch of the apocrypha must surely qualify.\n\n: 3. Is it authentic?\n\nAgain, by what standard?  Is "authenticity" a function of the authors? the\nhistorical accuracy? \n\n: 4. Is it dynamic?\n\nWhat is this supposed to mean?  Many of the apocryphal books are highly\n"dynamic" -thought provoking, faithful, even exciting.\n\n: 5. Is it received, collected, read and used?\n\nBy whom?  Of course the apocryphal books were received (by some),\ncollected (or else we would not have them), read and used (and they still are,\nin the Catholic and Orthodox churches).\n\n: On these counts, the apocrapha falls short of the glory of God.\n\nThis is demonstrably false.\n\n: To quote Unger's Bible Dictionary on the Apocrapha:\n: 1. They abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and\n: anachronisms.\n\nSo do other books of the Bible.\n\n: 2. They teach doctrines which are false and foster practices\n: which are at variance with sacred Scripture.\n\n"False" by whose interpretation?  Those churches that accept them find no\ncontradiction with the rest of scripture.  \n\n: 3. They resort to literary types and display an artificiality of\n: subject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred Scripture.\n\nThis is a purely subjective evaluation.  The apocryphal books demonstrate\nthe same categories and forms of writing found in the other scriptures.\n(In fact, one could argue that the apocryphal "Additions to the Book of\nEsther" act rather to bring the "unscripturelike" book of Esther more into\nline with other books.)\n\n: 4. They lack the distinctive elements which give genuine\n: Scripture their divine character, such as prophetic power and\n: poetic and religious feeling.\n\nHave you ever read the Wisdom of Ben Sira or the Wisdom of Solomon?  They\nexhibit every bit as much "poetic and religious feeling" as Psalms or\nProverbs.\n\n[deletions]\n\n: How do you then view the words: "I warn everyone who  hears the\n: words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to\n: them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book.\n: And if anyone takes away from this book the prophecy, God will\n: take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the\n: holy city" (Rev 22.18-9)\n: Surely this sets the standard and not just man-made traditions.\n\nThese words clearly were meant to refer to the book of Revelation alone,\nnot to the whole body of scripture.  Revelation itself was accepted very\nlate into the canon.  The church simply did not see it as having a primary\nrole of any kind in identifying and limiting scripture.\n\n: It is also noteworthy to consider Jesus' attitude. He had no\n: argument with the pharisees over any of the OT canon (John\n: 10.31-6), and explained to his followers on the road to Emmaus \n: that in the law, prophets and psalms which referred to him - the \n: OT division of Scripture (Luke 24.44), as well as in Luke 11.51\n: taking Genesis to Chronicles (the jewish order - we would say\n: Genesis to Malachi) as Scripture.\n\nJesus does not refer to the canon for the simple reason that in his day,\nthe canon had not been established as a closed collection.  The books\nof the apocrypha were part of the Septuagint (which was the Bible of\nthe early church).  The Hebrew canon was not closed until 90 c.e.\nThe Torah (Pentateuch/ "Law") was established in Jesus' day, as were\nthe Prophets (with the _exclusion_ of Daniel).  The Writings, however,\nwere still in flux.  Jesus does not refer to the Writings, only to the\nPsalms, which were part of them.  The books of the apocrypha were all\npart of the literature that was eventually sifted and separated.\n\nTo argue that Jesus is referring to the Jewish canonical order in Luke 11:51\nis weak at best; he is not quoting scripture, but telling a chronological\nstory.  And, as mentioned above, the Hebrew canon (especially in the\npresent order) did not exist as such in Jesus' day.
That is an assumption on your part.  Where is your proof that one always will\ndegenerate into hating the sinner, because he hates the sin.\n\nI am reminded of the Civil Rights movement in America.  It is true that many\nindividuals hated the proponents of racism.  It is also true that many \nindividuals hated segregation and discrimination with their whole heart and\nnever degenerated into hating the individuals who practiced it.  Dr. King's\nmessage was this.  Love the individual, the loving of the individual would\ntransform him into a friend.  However, this did not take away his hatred for\nsegregation.  His hatred for injustice.  \n\n\n\nI would ask, "Did John the Baptist practice love when he criticized the Jewish\nLeaders of his day?"  Did Jesus Practice love when he threw the moneychangers\nout of the temple?\n\nWe must have at least a distase for sin.  We must in order to fight it in \nourselves.  Also we must be ready for the call from God to call sin by its\nright name.  Jesus loved everyone, but he called sin by its right name.\n\nIt is true that love for others is to guide every step of our walk, but it is\nalso true that sometimes the love for God calls us to stand up for truth.\n\n--\n"Competition is the law of the jungle.\n Cooperation is the law of civilization."  --  Eldridge Cleaver
You may not think that it is fair, but how many sins do you know of\nthat affect only the sinner?  Is it fair for us even to be able to get\ninto Heaven?  Do we have a _right_ to Heaven, even if we were to lead\nsinless lives?  Anyway, your argument seems to be saying, "If _I_ were\nGod, I certainly wouldn't do things that way; therefore, God doesn't do\nthings that way."\n\n	Isaiah 55:8-9:\n\n	"For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my\n	ways, saith the LORD.  For as the heavens are higher than the\n	earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts\n	than your thoughts."\n\n   Original Sin is biblical:\n\n	Romans 5:12-14:\n\n	"Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death\n	by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have\n	sinned: (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not\n	imputed when there is no law.  Nevertheless death reigned from\n	Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the\n	similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him\n	that was to come."\n\n	1 Corinthians 15:22:\n\n	"For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made\n	alive."
Let me say that the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ is\ncentral to Christianity. If you personally believe that Jesus Christ\ndied for you, you are a part of the Christian body of believers.\n\nWe are all still human. We don't know it all, but homosexual or heterosexual,\nwe all strive to follow Jesus.  The world is dying and needs to hear about\nJesus Christ.\n\nAre you working together with other Christians to spread the Gospel?
..\n...\n\nIt sounds like she has a problem.  She has a problem opening up to her\nhusband so she is lesbian.  WHAT? In a marrige, a couple is supposed\nto open up to each other.  Because she didn't feel comfortable opening\nup to her husband she gets a divorce and comes to the conclusion that\nshe is lesbian.  Before anyone gets maried they should make sure that\nthey would feel comfortable "open up the deepest part of her soul to\nher husband".

I am going to stop reading the homosexuality posts, at least for a  \nwhile, because of the repeated seemingly personal attacks on me via  \npost/e-mail(mainly e-mail).  If anyone has a specific comment,  \nsuggestion, and/or note that does not contain any name calling, etc.  \nthat they would like for me to read, send it to me via e-mail.  I  \nwould like a copy of file mentioned by the moderator ragarding the  \nexergetical issue of it.  I attempted to get it via ftp but was  \nunable.

Does anyone know of an English language edition that does not show the\nverse (or even chapter) numbers.  I have always thought that such an\nedition would be very useful - although hard to navigate around.\n\nI have a Scots NT that doesn't show verse numbers, and it is great to\nread, particularly longer narrative passages, but my Scots isn't quite\nup to doing proper study from this edition - I tend to use it to get a\n"feel" for a story, particularly in the gospels, and then use an\nEnglish edition to look for details.\n\nAlison
Hi Frank:\n\nI've read it a couple of times and I think that it is excellent.\nChristiandom has needed this book for some time now. I suggest that\n*every* Christian read it.\n\nAccording to Hank, they printed 15 times more than Harvest House\nusually prints for the first printing, and it still sold out in\nthe first week. It is in it's second printing, and most Christian\nbook stores have waiting lists. You can order it directly from CRI\nat 1-800-443-9797.
Here is the short answer: because only\ncertain marriages are recorded in Heaven.\n\nNow for the long answer:\n\nIn Doctrine and Covenants section 132, the \nchapter discussing eternal marriage (and, yes,\nplural marriage), the distinction between\nsealings under the priesthood and other \nmarriages is revealed.  \n\nWhen "the children of this world marry, or are\ngiven in marriage" when they receive "the \nresurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are\ngiven in marriage" (Luke 20:34-35).\nJesus was simply teaching that marriages "until\ndeath do you part" are not in force after death.\n\nHowever, the Doctrine and Covenants continues \ndescribing eternal marriage.\n\nD&C 132:19\n   And again, verily I say unto you, if a \nman marry a wife by my word, which is my law, and\nby the new and everlasting covenant, and it is\nsealed unto them by the Holy Spirit of promise,\nby him who is anointed this power and the keys \nof this priesthood; ... [ shortened for brevity AI]\nand shall be of full force when they are out of\nthe world; and they shall pass by the angels, \nand the gods, which are set there, to their \nexhaltation and glory in all things, as hath been \nsealed upon their heads, which glory shall be a \nfulness and a continuation of the seeds forever\nand ever.\n\nThe Lord told Peter "whatsoever thou shalt bind\non earth shall be bound in heaven" (Matt 16:19).\nDo you doubt that Peter was given the power to \nperform sealings?\nPeter thought so because he taught that husbands\nand wives were "heirs *together* of the grace of\nlife" (1 Peter 3:7).\n\n"In order to obtain the highest" (degree of\ncelestial glory), a man must enter into this\norder of the priesthood" (D&C 131:2).\nWhen a man and wife are sealed they truly become \n"one flesh" because their eternal "increase" \n(destinies) are enjoined completely.\n\nOur Father has an eternal companion (and maybe\nmore because of the plural marriage conditions\nof the law) who participated in our creation\nand is equally concerned with our progress here.\n\nThere is no scriptural basis for this doctrine.\nIf fact, the only mention of our Mother is in\none verse of a hymn written early in the history\nof the Church:\n\n    O My Father\n\n    I had learned to call thee Father,\n    Through thy Spirit from on high,\n    But, until the key of knowledge\n    Was restored, I knew not why.\n    In the heav'ns are parents single?\n    No, the thought makes reason stare!\n    Truth is reason; truth eternal\n    Tells me I've a mother there.\n\nWhy don't we hear more about our Mother?\n\n1.  Because our Father presides under Priesthood\nauthority (which is not a calling for Her);\n\n2.  Because we don't all (necessarily) have the\nsame Mother it would be confusing for worship;\n\n3.  Because our Father wishes to withhold Her\nname and titles because of how some people\ndegrade sacred things.
It's always a two-way street.  God gave her the grace to avoid sin,\nthus when she was visited by Gabriel, she gave her fiat, her total\nacceptance of God's will.  This fiat summarizes why Catholics regard \nher as the highest of all humans, that God chose her and that she\naccepted.  Knowing this in advance, we extrapolate that she was\nneither stained by nor subject to original sin.\n\nGod did create us all miraculously free to choose or not choose to sin.\n"Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof and the grace of God to\ncommand it."  This amount of grace was precisely determined by God\nto be the amount required to do what God asked of her.  The grace\ngiven to each of us is also enough, but we do not always choose\nto accept it.  We also believe Jesus was fully human and never\nsinned.  \n\nGod could have created a much better person than myself, one who\nalways chose the right thing, yet he created me instead, despite\nmy flaws.  He proves he loves me as I am, continually drawing me\ntowards perfection.  For whatever purpose he has for me, he has\nconfidence that I will accomplish it.  If I ask God to repeat his\nmiraculous creation of the mother of his son, where will that leave me?

My wife wants to go to one of his lectures.  When\nI asked why, she said Ram Das was "the greatest spiritual leader\nof our time!"\n\nSeveral years ago my wife got involved with a religious cult, and\nwe went through 9 months of hell that almost ended our marriage \nbefore she quit.  Let's just say I'm concerned about this Ram Das\nand her interest, especially so with the recent religious cult\nevents from Texas.

What is wrong with "the Spirit talking to Himself."  Jesus intercedes\nfor us, and Romans 8:26-27 tell of how the Spirit intercedes for\nus before God.  That is no theological problem.  Tounges as a prayer\nlanguage finds support in I Corinthians 14:14-18.\n\n\n\nIts true that this could be (and has been) used as a rug to sweep\nany difficulties under.  But it is a valid point.  Paul does mention\nangelic tounges in the verse. \n\n\n\nIf the languages we sepak are the result of Babel, then it stands to\nreason that angels would speak a different language from us.  You do \nhave a valid point about multiple angelic languages.  But angelic\nbeings maybe of different species so to speak.  maybe different species\ncommunicate differently.  \n\n\nI have heard an eyewitness account, myself.  Such things are hard to prove.\nThey don't lend themselves to a laboratory thing very well.  I don';t\nknow if it is a very holy thing to take gifts into a laboratory anyway.\n\n\nThat's an unprovable statement.  How can you prove if somethings been proved?\nThere is no way to know that you've seen all the evidence.  Once I \nsaw an orthodontists records complete with photographs showing how one of\nhis patients severe underbite was cured by constant prayer.  \n\nJohn G. Lakes once prayed for someone and saw them healed in a laboratory,\naccording to "Adventures in God."  Its an interesting book.
This sounds to me like a sort of generic modalism (in the the three phases\nof water are but different modes of behavior of the same physical stuff).\nIt certainly does not seem to me to describe the orthodox position.\n\n[Of course, I suppose that the medieval view of water may have been\ndifferent, but now we know that the phases of water are just different\n*behaviors* of the same physical stuff - different modes, not different\nidentities - but perhaps the medieval people did not know that].\n\n\nThis is clearly Modalistic Monarchianism, since these three aspects depend\nsolely on point of view, and are do not really represent actual variety\nwithin the person.\n\nDo you now begin to see why

> When Elizabeth greeted Mary with the words: "Blessed art thou\n > among women" (Luke 1:42), it appears that this places Mary\n > beyond the sanctification of normal humanity.\n\nBut Deborah says (Judges 5:24):\n\n > Blessed among women shall be Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite,\n > Blessed above all women in the tents.\n\nIt can doubtless be taken that Jael's slaying of Sisera was a type\nof Mary's victory over sin. But even if we take Deborah's words as\napplying prophetically or symbolically to Mary, they must still be\napplicable literally to Jael.  We may well take them to mean that\nGod used her as a part of His plan for the deliverance of His\npeople, and that she has this in common with Mary.  But we have no\nreason to suppose that they mean that she was sinless, and thus no\nreason to take the like expression applied to Mary as proof that she\nwas sinless.
Whoa, dude I don't see the jump you made.\n		She was blessed, I'll give you that much.\n		What do you mean, she was placed "beyond" \n\n\n\n\n\nthe sanctification of normal humanity.
> I would rather spend an eternity in Hell than be beside God in\n > Heaven knowing that even one man would spend his "eternal life"\n > being scorched for his wrongdoings....\n\nStephen, I suspect that when you and I use the word "Hell," we have\ndifferent concepts in mind. When you encounter references to Heaven\nin terms of crowns and harps and golden streets, I trust that you do\nnot suppose (or suspect Christians of supposing) that the golden\nstreets are to be taken literally, still less that they are what the\nconcept of Heaven is all about. Why then should you suppose that\nabout the "fires" of Hell?\n     Have you read the novel ATLAS SHRUGGED? Do you remember the\nlast description of James Taggart, sitting on the floor beside the\nFerris Persuader? This comes close to a description of what is meant\nby Hell in my circles. If the image of fire is often used in this\nconnection, there are two reasons that occur to me.\n     The first reason is that it conveys the idea of Hell as\nsomething that any rational being would earnestly wish to avoid (as\nany rational being would wish to avoid the fate of James Taggart --\nbut the latter image is meaningful only to those who have read ATLAS\nSHRUGGED, a smaller audience than those who have played with\nmatches).\n     The second reason is the history of the Hebrew word "Gehenna,"\none of the words translated "Hell" in the New Testament. It refers\nto the valley of Hinnon, outside Jerusalem. In early days, it was a\nplace where the Canaanites offered human sacrifices (burned alive)\nto Molech. Later, it was made a garbage or refuse dump, where fires\nburned continually, consuming the trash of the city of Jerusalem.\n"To be cast into Gehenna" or "to burn in Gehenna" thus became a\nmetaphor for "to be rejected or discarded as worthless."\n\nLest you think that identifying Hell with the fate of James Taggart\nis my own private fancy, I commend to you the book THE GREAT\nDIVORCE, by C S Lewis. It discusses Heaven (no harps) and Hell (no\nflames). It is shorter than ATLAS SHRUGGED, and available at most\nbookstores and libraries.
(stuff deleted)\n\n    [First point. What they are doing is wrong, just as what\nJoseph's brothers did was wrong, just as what Judas did was wrong.\nThey intend it for evil. If God somehow brings good out of it, that\ndoes not make them any less subject to just condemnation and\npunishment.\n     Second point. Of course, God will bring good out of it. But not\nthe same good that He would have brought if the Serbians had\nrefrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder. Nor does the\ngood He purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right.]
Fine, but one of the points of this entire discussion is that "we"\n(conservative, reformed christians - this could start an argument...\nBut isn't this idea that homosexuality is ok fairly "new" [this\ncentury] ? Is there any support for this being a viable viewpoint\nbefore this century? I don't know.) don't believe that homosexuality\nis "acceptable to Him". So your scripture quotation doesn't work for\n"us".
From article <May.14.02.11.36.1993.25219@athos.rutgers.edu>, by tas@pegasus.com (Len Howard):
This is too often true.  Many people try to place this as a "higher"\nsin.  However...\n\n\nA big part of the problem is that many of the homosexuals and people\nadvocating acceptance of homosexuality in churches do not consider\n(active) homosexuality a sin.  I don't often see the attitude of\n"forgive me and I will try to change".  Instead I see "there's nothing\nwrong with my life and I can be a good Christian, so it must be you who\nhave an illness because you don't accept me".  Christians can and will\naccept homosexuals, just as they will accept *any* sinner.\n\nSure, it may be natural to some people to be homosexual - but it\nis also perfectly natural for everyone to sin!  I was born with\na desire to sin, but I work to prevent myself from sinning.  It's\nmuch less common now, but I *still* have urges to lash out in\nanger.  There also may not be a sudden disappearance of sinful\ndesires (or ever!), so it is sad to see people leave the church\nwhen they are discouraged that they are still homosexual after\nseveral years.
being gay and Christianity are not compatible should \n\nI would absolutly love to have the time and energy to do so. The\nproblem is to be totally fair I would have to go throught this type of\nsearch on every issue I belive in.  I don't have the time, resources,\nor ability to do what you ask.  Maybe you should pray that God gives\nme the opportunity instead of simply discrediting me because I have\nnot been able to talk to every gay christian.
[cont. Dr. James DeYoung; #3]\n\nR. Scroggs\n\n     Robin Scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and\nsuggested a new twist to the word.  Scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a\n"Hellenistic Jewish coinage, perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic\nterminology."  The term is derived from Lev 18"22 & 20:13 where the LXX\njuxtaposes the two words arsenos ("male") and koiten ("bed"), and represents\nthe Hebrew miskab zabar ("lying with a male").   Yet he believes that Paul did\nnot originate the term, but borrowed it from "circles of Hellenistic Jews\nacquainted with rabbinic discussions" (180 n.14).  It was invented to avoid\n"contact with the usual Greek terminology" (108).  If this is true, Scroggs\nobserves, it explains why the word does not appear in Greco-Roman discussions\nof pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it.  It was meaningless to\nnative-speaking Greeks (108).\n\n     Scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the\nobject of the second part, thus differing from Boswell's "learned discussion"\n(107).  Yet Scroggs understands the general meaning of "one who lies with a\nmale" to have a very narrow reference.  With the preceding malokoi (I Cor 6:9),\nwhich Scroggs interprets as "the effeminate call-boy," arsenokoitai is the\nactive partner "who keeps the malakos of the 'mistress' or who hires him on\noccasion to satisfy his sexual desires" (108).  Hence arsenokoitai does not\nrefer to homosexuality in general, to female homosexuality, or to the generic\nmodel of pederasty.  It certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model, he\naffirms (109).\n     This is Scrogg's interpretation of the term in I Tim 1:10 also.  The\ncombination of pornoi ("fornicators"), arsenokoitai and andrapodistai ("slave\ndealers") refers to "male prostitutes, males who lie [with them], and slave\ndealers [who procure them]" (120).  It again refers to that  specific form of\npederasty "which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual\npurposes, and the use of these boys by adult males" (121).  Even "serious\nminded pagan authors" condemned this form of pederasty.  He then uses these\ninstances of arsenokoitai in I Cor and I Tim to interpret the apparently\ngeneral condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in Rom 1. \nConsequently Paul "Must have had, could only have had pederasty in mind" (122).\nWe cannot know what Paul would have said about the "contemporary model of\nadult/adult mutuality in same sex relation ships" (122).\n\n     In relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical\nconcerns, Scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of\nvices in I Cor 6 have no deliberate, intended meaning in Paul.  The form and\nfunction of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped.  Any\nrelationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually\nnonexistent.  He concludes that Paul "does not care about any specific item in\nthe lists" (104). \n\n     Both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary\nphenomenon of a "catalogue of vices,"  Scroggs argues that the Scriptures are\n"irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today" (129).  The "model\nin today's Christian homosexual community is so different from the model\nattacked by the NT" that "Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not\nrelevant to today's debate.  They should no longer be used in denominational\ndiscussions about homosexuality, should in no way be a weapon to justify\nrefusal of ordination. . . " (127).\n\n      REACTIONS TO THE NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI\n\nD. Wright\n\n     In more recent years the positions of Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs have\ncome under closer scrutiny.   Perhaps the most critical evaluation of Boswell's\nview is that by David Wright.  In his thorough article, Wright points out\nseveral shortcomings of Boswell's treatment of arsenokoitai.   He faults\nBoswell for failing to cite, or citing inaccurately, all the references to Lev\n18:22 and 20:13 in the church fathers, such as Eusebius, the "Apostolic\nConstitutions,"  Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian and Origen (127-28). \nBoswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term\nderives either its form or its meaning from the Leviticus passages (129).  This\nis significant, for if the term is so derived, it clearly refutes Boswell's\nclaim that the first half of the word (arseno-) denotes not the object but the\ngender of the second half (-koitai).  The LXX must mean "a male who sleeps with\na male," making arseno- the object.\n\n     Wright also faults Boswell's claims regarding linguistic features of the\nterm, including suggested parallels (129).  Though Boswell claims that\ncompounds with arseno- employ it objectively and those with arreno- employ it\nas an adjective, Wright believes that the difference between the two is merely\none of dialectical diversity: "No semantic import attaches to the difference\nbetween the two forms" (131).  Wright believes that in most compounds in which\nthe second half is a verb or has a verbal force, the first half denotes its\nobject and where "the second part is substantival, the first half denotes its\ngender" (132). \n\n     It is with Boswell's treatment of the early church fathers that Wright\ntakes special issue, because the former has failed to cite all the sources. \nFor example, Aristides' Apology (c. AD 138) probably uses arrenomaneis,\nandrobaten, and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male\nhomosexuality (133), contrary to Boswell's discussion.  Boswell fails to cite\nHippolytus (Refut. Omn. Haer. 5:26:22-23) and improperly cites Eusebius and the\nSyriac writer Bardensanes.  The latter uses Syriac terms that are identical to\nthe Syriac of I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 (133-34). \n\n     Next Wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in\nparallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers, the\ndominant form of male homosexuality among the Greeks (134).  Sometimes this\nparallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia ("adultery"), porneia\n("fornication"), and paidophthoria, with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris\n(136).  Clement of Alexandria in Protr. 10:108:5 cites the second table of the\nTen Commandments as "You shall not kill, ou moicheuseis ("you shall not commit\nadultery"), ou paidophthoreseis ("you shall not practice homosexuality with\nboys"), you shall not steal. . ." (150 n. 43).\n\n     Another occurrence of arsenokoitein ("commit homosexuality") exists in the\nSibylline Oracles 2:71-73.  It may be, Wright observes, that the word was\ncoined by a Jewish pre-Christian writer in a Hellenistic setting represented by\nOr.Sib., book 2 (137-38).\n\n     Wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in Rhetorius (6th c.) who drew\nupon the first century AD writer Teucer, in Macarius (4th-5th c.), and in John\nthe Faster (d. 595) (139-40).  The last in particular bears the idea of\nhomosexual intercourse, contrary to Boswell.\n\n     Wright next replies to Boswell's contention that the term would not be\nabsent "from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted\n(140-41).  Wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to\nthe first century AD since it did not exist before then, that the Greeks used\ndozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality, that some sources (e.g.\nDidache) show no acquaintance with Paul's letters or deliberately avoid citing\nScripture, and that Boswell neglects citing several church fathers (140-41). \n\n     Boswell's treatment of Chrysostom in particular draws Wright's attention\n(141-44).  Boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of Chrysostom,\nomitting references and asserting what is patently untrue.  Chrysostom gives a\nlong uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on Rom\n1:26.  Boswell has exaggerated Chrysostom's infrequent use of the term.  Wright\nobserves that Boswell has "signally failed to demonstrate any us of\narsenokoites etc. in which it patently does not denote male homosexual\nactivity" (144).  It is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature\nand the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly\nspecified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the Greco-Roman world. \n\n     Wright also surveys the Latin, Syriac, and Coptic translations of I Tim\nand I Cor.  All three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning\n"homosexual" i.e., they understand arseno- as the object of the second half of\nthe word (144-45).  None of these primary versions supports Boswell's limited\nconclusion based on them.\n\n     Wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the\ncatalogues of vices as a literary form.  He believes that such lists developed\nin late Judaism as Hellenistic Jews wrote in clear condemnation of\nhomosexuality in the Greek world.  This paralleled the increased concern on the\npart of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence.  The term came into\nbeing under the influence of the LXX (145) so that writers spoke "generally of\nmale activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual\nengagement with paides" (146).  If arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were\ninterchangeable, it is because the former encompassed the latter (146).\n\n     In summary, Wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning\nhomosexuality and arises with Judaism.   The views of Boswell, Scroggs, and\nothers who limit the term to "active male prostitutes" or pederasty are without\nsignificant support from linguistic and historical studies.
And do not set your heart on what you will eat or drink; do not worry about it.
This is true. The statement didn't say anything about Christians in general.\nIt specifically said "strict fundamentalist" Christians. It reflects a\ncommon perception that people have about fundamentalists being strict\ndisciplinarians. Whether or not this perception is justified is another issue.
David Hammerslag asked:\n\n	How do you (Mormons) reconcile the idea of eternal marriage\n	with Christ's statement that in the resurrection people will\n	neither marry nor be given in marriage (Luke, chapt. 20)?\n\nSeveral explanations for this seeming contradiction have been proposed,\nbut most LDS scholars whose opinions I have studied take more or less\none of the following three positions:\n\n(1) Jesus was talking to a group of people (Sadducees) who were trying\n    to trip Him up with what they felt was a silly hypothetical situa-\n    tion that ridiculed the concept of a resurrection (something they\n    didn't believe in).  These people -- and those associated with them\n    ("Now there were with us seven brethren", Matt. 22:25) -- would not\n    be receptive to such higher blessings as eternal marriage.  Hence,\n    the people in the story would likely not be married in the eterni-\n    ties; but that doesn't mean other, more faithful people could not\n    have this blessing.\n\n(2) Jesus was making a distinction between the state or condition of\n    =being= married, and the process of =becoming= married.  The latter\n    activity (marrying and giving in marriage) will not take place in\n    the eternities, because all eternal marriages will be taken care of\n    before then.\n\n(3) The account as we have it (in all three of the synoptic Gospels) is\n    missing something that would make its real meaning clearer.  Note\n    that we (LDS) do not believe in Biblical inerrancy, so we do not in\n    general feel obliged to reconcile each and every Bible text with\n    modern revelation through Joseph Smith and other latter-day proph-\n    ets.  Nor are we particularly upset that the account in question\n    was not significantly revised in the "Joseph Smith Translation" or\n    "Inspired Version" of the Bible, since we do not believe this work\n    was completed or that failure to revise a passage in the JST con-\n    stitutes divine approval of that passage as it stands in the KJV.
Seeing as how _The_Two_Babylons_ has been brought up again, it is time for\nme to respond , once again, and say that this book is junk.  It is nothing\nmore that an anti-Catholic tract of the sort published ever since the there\nwere protestants.  Its scholarship is phony and its assertions spurious.
Please note that God commanded Adam to work before the fall:\n\n"The LORD God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work\n it and take care of it." (Gen 2:15, NIV).  \n\nWork was God's design from the beginning.\n\n-- \nKen
Paul's statement only asserts that that particular choice was not\na matter of karmic fulfillment of the past, just as the fate of the\nman born blind (John 9) was not.  There is no question here of the\nsimplistic idea of karma as a machine that is the sole determiner\nof one's destiny.  Even the eastern traditions, or many of them,\ndo not say that, as one knowledgeable poster pointed out.\n\nAnd if in fact that Paul did not know about or believe in reincarnation\ndoes not say anything one way or another about it.  Even John the Baptist,\nwho Jesus says emphatically is Elijah (Matt 11:14), does not appear to \nhave been aware of it, at least at the point at which he was asked. But \nit is interesting that his threefold denial -- to the question whether \nhe is the Christ, the Prophet (i.e. Isaiah), or Elijah, is emphatic in \nthe first case and very weak in the third.\n\nI would like to add once again that, while it is important to discuss the\ndifferent passages that may point directly to the teaching of repeated\nearth lives, one way or another, what I really see as important in our\ntime is that the subject be revisited in terms of the larger view of\nChristianity and Christian doctrine.  For the most part, those who do\naccept it either reject the central ideas of Christianity or, if they\nare Christians, hold their conviction as a kind of separate treasure.\nI believe that Christianity has important new understanding to bring\nto bear on it, and vice versa, much that is central to Christianity\ntakes on entirely new dimensions of meaning in light of repeated earth\nlives. It has a direct bearing on many of the issues frequently discussed \nin this newsgroup in particular.\n\nI have said openly that I have developed my views of repeated earth lives\nlargely from the work of Rudolf Steiner.  Not that I hold him as an\nauthority, but the whole picture of Christianity becomes clearer in light\nof these ideas.  Steiner indicated that the old consciousness of reincar-\nnation necessarily had to fade away that it could be renewed in later\ntimes, after a time of development of the Christ idea through the first\ntwo millenia after Christ's deed on Golgotha.  In our own time, it becomes \nimportant that, having received the basic gospel of salvation, our \nunderstanding of life and of the human being can now grow to embrace the \nsignificance of this idea.  For the discussions in this newsgroup, I \nhave tried to focus on that which can be related as directly as possible \nto scripture and to fundamental Christian teaching and tradition.
I would just like to point out that the particular command not to eat\nor fellowship with Gentiles is not found in the Old Testament.  This\nwas part of the "hedge built around the law."  It was a part of Peter's\ntradition, and not the Scripture.

"We however, shall be innocent of this sin, and will pray with earnest\nentreaty and supplication that the Creator of all may keep unharmed the\nnumbers of His elect."\n    -St. Clement, Bishop of Rome, Letter to the Corinthians, 59.2, (c. 90 AD)\n\n"Ignatius also called Theophorus, to the Church at Ephesus in Asia,\nwhich is worthy of all felicitation, blessed as it is with greatness by\nthe fullness of God the Father, predestined from all eternity for a\nglory that is lasting and unchanging, united and chosen in true\nsuffering by the will of the Father in Jesus Christ our God..."\n    -St. Ignatius, Bishop of Antioch, Letter to the Ephesians, Address,\n(c 110 AD)\n\n"We say therefore, that in substance, in concept, in orgin and in\neminece, the ancient and Catholic Church is alone, gathering as it does\ninto the unity of the one faith which results from the familiar\ncovenants .... those already chosen, those predestined by God who knew\nbefore the foundation of the world that they would be just."\n    -St. Clement, Patriarch and Archbishop of Alexandria, Miscellanies,\n7.17.107.3, (c 205 AD)\n\nOf course the doctrine was explained more fully later on by Sts.\nAugustine, Aquinas, etc., but the seeds were ther from the beginning.\n\n\nI think you are reading it wrong.  I say those who are not saved are not\nsaved on account of their own sins.  It is not because God did not give\nthem sufficient grace, for He does do so, in His desire that all men\nmight be saved.  However, as only some are saved - and those who are\nsaved are saved by the grace of God, "not by works, lest any man should\nboast" - the others are damned because of their obstinacy in refusing to\nheed the call of God.  They are damned by their own free will and\nchosing, a choice forseen by God in His causing them to be not\npredestined, but reprobated instead.\n\n\nCertainly God does not distribute grace evenly.  If He did, no one could\nhave their heart hardened (or rather, harden their heart, thus causing\nGod to withdraw His grace).  But, you are correct - the world is divided\ninto those who God knows to be saved, and those God knows to be on the\nroad to perdition.  THe key is that God knows it and we do not.  Thus,\nno one can boast in complete assurance that they are one of the elect\nand predestined.  But no one who is a Christian in good standin should\ndoubt their salvation either (that shows a lack of trust in God).\n\n\nYou must admit it is possible.  Anyway, why would you want something in\nthe hear and know, when you can recieve 100 fold in heaven?  Better to\nlay up your treasure in heaven is what Jesus said.\nThis is not to condemn the rich, but simply to point out that those who\nare rich are frequently very evil or immoral, so God must give them\ntheir blessing know, as they have chosen.  Remeber, Jesus promised\ntribulation in this world, and hatred of others because we are\nChristians.  He did not promise heaven on earth.  He promised heaven.\n\n\nNot really.  Unless you do penance here on earth, you will have to do it\nin Purgatory, as Paul pointed out (1 Corinthians 3.15).  Those with\npoorer works, though still done with good intentions, will only be saved\nthrough fire (the damned will of course go into fire immeadiately, for\nwhatever good they did was not for God but for self (dead works)).  Of\ncourse, the Church gives indulgences, has Confession, and Annointing of\nthe Sick to remove sin and the the vestiges of sin, so there is really\nlittle excuse for ending up in Purgatory - it is a last hope for the\nsomewhat lazy and careless as I said above in referring to Paul.\n\nAnd no comments were taken as flames.  You are one of the more polite\npeople I have talked to over the net.\n\nAndy Byler

A generation\nbefore the time of its writing, the people of Israel had stood at Kadesh,\ngateway to Canaan, and made the fateful choice to go their own way rather\nthan God's way. They refused an adventure of faith in God which would\nhave given them Canaan, the homeland of promise. God honored their\ndecision, and said they would wander in the desert only a few miles from the\nland of promise until they were all buried in the sand. The young decision-\nmakers of that fateful day were between twenty and thirty years old, and\ndestined to be dead within forty years... bleached bones in the desert by the\ntime they were seventy-- eighty, at the most. The lives of these wanderers\nhad been unending sadness. Moses described it as ending each year with a\nsigh (v. 9). The fact that they knew, give or take a few months, when they\nwere going to die, underscored the meaninglessness of their existence.\nWhatever heights of success they reached, they would be a heap of bleached\nbones within forty years.  The only ones to live outside of that depression of\nhopeless disbelief were Joshua and Caleb, who had stood against the nation\nat Kadesh and had God' s promise of one day entering the land. The\nforty-year period was finally drawing to an end. The new generation, those\nwho were children at Kadesh, were now grown and eager to take the\ninheritance their parents had refused to enjoy. In the light of this, Moses\nprays...it is time for a new day to begin and the days of misery to be over.\nAll these years, as Moses had walked with these moaning and complaining\npeople through the wilderness of their exile, he had carried a double burden.\nHis was not only the sadness of living in less than what could have been; but\nhe also knew why they had chosen as they had at Kadesh.  The problem was\nthat they were ignorant of the character of their God. If asked. "Who is your\nGod?" they would have described Him as the God who is Power. When\nAaron had created their concept of God in an idol. he chose a calf. or young\nbull--a symbol of power, of virility. In their minds, God was the young bull\nwho had impaled Pharaoh on his horns and gored Egypt's gods as He led\nIsrael to Sinai.  But when man worships a God of power, His miracles grow\nthin and even boring. After miracle food on the desert floor and water\ngushing miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland, the\nGod of Almightiness becomes "ho-hum --What' s next on the miracle menu?"\nAnd a God of power can be as unpredictable as a young bull calf. He might\nbe all they need, but then...who knows? If He has all power, He has a right\nto do whatever He wants, whenever He wants. The only person these people\nhad known who had absolute power was Pharaoh, and men's lives had hung\non the whim of his moods, which could change with the wind. They believed\nGod could work His wonders on their behalf, but they did not know HIM\nand, so, could not trust Him. Israel had a God based on what He DID, His\nacts; Moses knew the heart of God, the motivation behind the acts. From the\nday of his encounter at the burning bush, Moses had been fascinated by God.\nAt Sinai, he asked to be shown His glory...to know who He really was. He\nhad seen what God had done; he wanted to know who God was. This\nrequest was granted, and Moses was given a glimpse of God's glorious\nPerson. He had come to know the heart of God as compassion and\nlovingkindness (Exodus 34:6,7). The word "lovingkindness" is not to be\nunderstood as a human kind of love. It speaks of the kind of relationship\narising out of the making of a covenant. It can only be understood as the\nlove that says, "I will never leave you nor forsake you." Lovingkindness is as\ntenacious as a British bulldog; when the world walks out, this love digs in its\nheels and refuses to leave.And it is not human romantic love, based on\nfeelings and rooted in emotions. It is a love of covenant commitment and,\ntherefore, operates quite apart from feelings. God's love is not an emotion\nthat wavers day by day; it is the total commitment of His Being to seek our\nhighest and best, and to bring us to our fullest potential as humans. God\ndoes not see something good and beautiful in us which arouses His feelings\nof love toward us...we do not woo Him and cause Him to fall in love with\nus! If that were the case, the first ugly, sinful thing we did would cause Him\nto reject us.  He is Love, and He loves us because of who He is-- not\nbecause of who we are. He does not love what we do, but He is committed\nto us, pursuing us down every blind alley and bypath of foolishness. He will\nnot let us go. His is a love that is not looking for what it can get out of us--\nbut a committed love that searches for opportunities to give to us. It is\nsaying to the recipient, "For as long as we shall live, I am for you."  The God\nwho has revealed Himself to man through Scripture and, finally, in Jesus--in\nHis coming, and in His death and resurrection--is the God who is\nlovingkindness. Thus He loves us and gives Himself to us...He will never\nleave us nor forsake us.  Tragically, many believers have never seen Him as\nlove; they see Him as power. No one will come to faith by just seeing\nmiracles. Miracles point to who He is, and that is when faith springs in the\nheart.  Israel did not see God as lovingkindness; they saw His acts of power.\nMoses knew His ways, the kind of God He was, and the love that He had for\nthese people. Because of their total lack of understanding of His love, they\ncould not trust Him to be their strength in taking the land. Faith is born out\nof knowing the love He has for us; it is the resting response to the One who\ngives Himself to us. He is not the force, and to call Him the Almighty is to\nmiss His heart. He is Love who is the Almighty and the Infinite Force.  If\nman is to make force or raw power work for him, he must depend on\nknowing the forrnula and have faith in it. But the power that issues from\nlove demands faith in the Person of love Himself. The forty years of\nmeaningless wandering was a monument to a people who had never come to\nknow the God of love.  At this point, with the new generation and the\npossibility of enjoying all that God promised, Moses prays verse 14. The\nlanguage Moses uses is reminiscent of a baby having slept secure in its\nmother's love, now waking to look up into the delight of her eyes. It is\nwaking to the consciousness of being loved... watched over, cared for,\nprotected, fed, and cleaned, day and night, by the mother. Suppose we were\nto ask, "What has the baby done to deserve this?" or, "Have arrangements\nbeen made for the child to repay the parents for this inconvenience?" Our\nquestions would be considered unnatural, even immoral. The child was\nconceived in love, anticipated and prepared for with love's excitement, a love\nthat has been to the gates of death to bring it into being. The parents' love is\nunconditional, spontaneous...it has nothing to do with the looks of the child\nor its performance. So God is love. He loves us unconditionally,\nspontaneously. We were conceived in His imagination and fashioned after\nHis image, to be brought to where we are at this moment by the blood of the\nLord Jesus. It is slanderous, and immoral, to even ask what we must do to\nearn and deserve that love. The child discovers its personhood and identity\nthrough the eyes and touch, through the cuddles, of its parents' love. It is a\nscientific fact that a baby who is not touched and held will probably die or, if\nit survives, will have severe emotional problems. And a person who has been\nheld and loved will still never know the true meaning of life without the\nembrace and knowledge of love from God. Moses prays that the new\ngeneration will learn to wake every morning, resting with total confidence in\nthe love of God. and will receive all His promises and blessings with joy and\ngladness. Significantly, Moses prays that they will be SATISFIED with His\nlove. "Satisfied." in the Hebrew language. is a rich picture word describing\nbeing filled with an abundance of gourmet food. It is also used to describe\nthe earth after the rain has soaked it and all the vegetation has received\nenough water. Moses prays that they will awaken every morning to be\ndrenched in the life-giving love of God. That sense of satisfaction is the\nlifelong quest of every man and woman. When we are satisfied in our\ndeepest selves, many of our emotional--and even our physical--problems\ndisappear. Man seeks that sense of satisfaction which comes from feeling\nthat he is fulfilled as a human being...his hours have meaning, which make\nsense out of the ordinary and mundane. Apart from God, man seeks this\nsatisfaction through intellectual pursuit, through the exciting of the\nemotions, and through the feeding of his body...he will even seek it in\nreligious exercise. But man will always be dissatisfied until he is responding\nto the love of the living God. Only in knowing God's love will the rest of life\nmake sense. As the forty years drew to a close and the land of promise again\nbecame the inheritance to be taken, Moses prayed this psalm. I find it\nfascinating that he  should pray and ask God for a daily revelation of His\nlove. Considering the awe with which the people held Moses. one would\nthink he could have lectured them on the subject of lovingkindness and, by\nthe knowledge they gained, they would live in it. But Moses knew\nbetter. God is the only one who can make known to us His love. We won't\nfind it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use to\nmanipulate Him. Nor is it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotions and\ngive us God feelings. It is God, himself, the Lover, who must open our eyes\nand satisfy us with His love. This prayer is man, in helplessness, asking God\nto make the love He is real in our hearts. Moses' prayer was partially\nanswered in the next generation and seen in the exploits of faith which\nworked by love in The Book of Judges. But it would not be answered in its\nfullest dimensions until the coming of the Holy Spirit, who pours out the\nlove of God in our hearts (Romans 5:5). In the history of the early Church,\nwe read of the Holy Spirit "falling upon" the believers. This is an ancient\nexpression that, in modern English, means to give a bear hug. It is used in\nLuke 15 to describe the father running to the prodigal and "falling on his\nneck and kissing him." The Holy Spirit is God hugging you in your deepest\nself and smothering you with divine kisses at the deepest level of your\nbeing. This is not a one-time experience to be filed in our spiritual resumes.\nMoses prayed that morning by morning we would awaken to the realization\nthat we are loved. The world, and much of our religious training, has taught\nus to perform in order to be accepted. We have spent far too long living in a\nstate of doing in order to find satisfaction for ourselves...to find acceptance\nand love from others, and from God. We now come humbled to receive love\nwe cannot earn...to be still and let Him tell us we are loved: to let the Holy\nSpirit descend into us, pouring out the love of God. We come in stillness to\nthink on and repeat His words of love to our minds. which have been jaded\nwith the doctrine of "perform to be accepted." We begin to realize that He\nloves us as we are, and gives meaning and purpose to all of life. I challenge\neveryone reading this to begin each day, from the moment you open your\neyes, by celebrating the God of love and praying this prayer. You may not\nfeel anything, but SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS. I was X-rayed the\nother day. I did not see or feel anything, but I noted that the technicians kept\nbehind protective walls. They know you cannot be exposed to those rays\nwithout being affected. So it is as we consciously begin our day knowing\nthat we are loved. Such experiential knowledge will produce, according to\nMoses, "joy and gladness all our days." Joy is the result of a life that is\nfunctioning as God intended us to function when He made us. You might say\nthat joy is the hum of an engine that is at peak performance. Man' s highest\nperformance is to rest in the love God has for him... the hum will be joy, and\nthe result will be endless creativity arising from the sense of meaning he now\nhas in life. Stop wandering in the wilderness. Be satisfied with His love and,\nin joy, day by day, receive all His promised blessings.
Hello.\nI just like to share this rosary and other prayer propagation\npractice we do in my country.  I am not sure if it is going on\nalso here in the US or any other country.  In all these 4 1/2\nyrs. I've been here in Illinois, USA, I have not encountered\nit.  May I just call it "Traveling Fatima" since I don't know\nof an exact translation of what we call it in my native language.\n\nFor certain regions in a district in a town or city, an image/\nstatue of our Lady of Fatima is moved from one home (originating\nfrom owner) to another.  This will stay with that family for\none (1) week and this family is required to pray the rosary and\nother prayers (prayer sheets accompany the image) to our Lady\nof Fatima.  The move will be like a simple procession of folks\npicking up the image from its current 'home' after 'departing'\nprayers and proceeds to move it to the next home which has the\nprior notification about the move.  There will be the 'receiving'\nprayers at the next home to welcome our Lady of Fatima image\nthere.  It does not have to be that only members of the family\nin that home who must pray to the image.  They may invite others\n(or others/friends can invite themselves in ;^)) to participate\nduring prayer time in that 'new' home everyday for one week.\nThis image is moved from one family to the next within the\nbounded region of that district, until it goes back to the owner\nof the image.\n\nThis is probably going on around there (Philippines) right now\n(or somebody correct me when exactly since I forgot) and every\nyear, this is part of our devotion to our Lady of Fatima.\n\nIt has been easy to facilitate this back home because it is more\nlikely that your next door neighbor is a Catholic and the image\nthen is just moved next door.\n\nI am thinking of starting something like it in the village where\nmy sister and her family lives.  Most of our friends and neighbors\nthere are Catholics and practicing ones.\n\nI'd like to know if there are any state/community laws that this \npractice will violate, whatsoever, before I go for it.  Thank you \nfor any comments or help about this matter.
After reading the posts on this newsgroup for the pasts 4 months, it \nhas become apparent to me that this group is primarily active with \nLiberals, Catholics, New Agers', and Athiests.  Someone might think \nto change the name to:  soc.religion.any   - or -  perhaps even\nsoc.religion.new.  It might seem to be more appropriate.\nHeck, don't flame me, I'm Catholic, gay, and I voted \nfor Bill Clinton.  I'm on your side!
comments :\n\n							     ^^^^^^^^^\n ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThere is a BIG difference between the status of what you refer to as\nAlexandrians (actually, this includes all Oriental Orthodox Churches\nand not only Copts) and that of Nestorians. The Oriental Orthodox\nChurches never even "shelter" Eutyches (the advocator of Monophysitism)\nbut on the contrary, it condemned (and still does condemn) him and his\nheresy. That is why the Eastren (Chalcedonian) Orthodox Church held\ntalks with the Oriental (non-Chalcedonian) that started 30 years ago\nand still continueing till today, but they have converged on many\nissues the most imporatant of which is Christology (I have more \ndetails of the inter-Orthodox dialogue, in case anyone is interested).\nSo I do not see how the "Alexandrians" and the Nestorians are in a\nsimilar position.\n\nPeace,
