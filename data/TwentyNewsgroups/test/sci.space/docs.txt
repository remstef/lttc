The forces and accelerations involved in doing a little bit of orbital\nmaneuvering with HST aboard are much smaller than those involved in\nreentry, landing, and re-launch.  The OMS engines aren't very powerful;\nthey don't have to be.
This does not propose a _mechanism_ for GRBs in the Oort (and, no,\n   anti-matter annihilation does not fit the spectra at least as far\n   as I understand annihilation spectra...). Big difference.\n   That's ignoring the question of how you fit a distribution\n   to the Oort distribution when the Oort distribution is not well\n   known - in particular comet aphelia (which are not well known)\n   are not a good measure of the Oort cloud distribution...\n\nMerging neutron stars is at least a mechanism with about the right\nenergy, except it doesn't explain why there is no apparent correlation\nwith galaxies or galaxy structure, there is no mechanism for getting\nall the energy out in gamma rays (with any significant amount of\nbaryons around there will be a lot of pair production, which makes a\nplasma, which thermalizes the energy), it has trouble generating\nenough energy to explain the most powerful bursts (10^52-53 ergs), it\nhappens too fast compared to the burst duration, and it is hard to\nmake tight-binaries of neutron stars.\n\nAnother cosmological mechinism is the catalytic conversion of a\nneutron star to a strange star or the merger of two strange stars, but\nthat uses pretty far-out physics.\n\nMy point is that we don't have a good mechanism at any distance, so\nGRB's are likely to be happening by an unknown mechanism, so we can't\nrule out the Oort cloud.  What would be the spectrum of an event which\nconverts a comet to strange matter?  The spectra for primordial black\nholes eating comets and antimatter comets colliding with matter comets\naren't quite right, but perhaps there is an unusual mechanism which\nmodifies the spectrum.  The energy matches very well for both of these\nmechanisms.  According to Trevor Weeks, if the "Tunguska Meteorite"\nwas a mini-black hole collision with the earth, then there are likely\nto be enough mini-black holes around that the rate for BH-comet\ncollisions matches the GRB rate well.\n\nThe fact that we don't know the distribution of comets in the Oort\ncloud isn't a reason to rule them out; it makes it harder to rule them\nout.  The point of the cited paper was that if we assume they got the\nright distribution for the Oort cloud, it is hard but not impossible\nto match that up with the distribution of GRB's.  If they got the\nwrong distribution for the Oort cloud, they can't constrain any Oort-\ncloud GRB's at all.
Are you guys talking about the Soviet "shuttle"?  It's not "Soyuz",\nit's called "Buran" which means "snow storm."\n\n(At least that's what they call it on Russian TV).
fc> Exactly what fraction of current research is done on the big, \nfc> visable light telescopes? From what I've seen, 10% or less \nfc> (down from amlost 100% 25 years ago.) That sounds like "dying"\nfc> to me...\n\n That doesn't seem like a fair comparison.  Infrared astronomy \n didn't really get started until something like 25 yrs. ago; it\n didn't explode until IRAS in 1983.  Gamma-ray (and I think \n X-ray) observations didn't really get started until the '70s.\n I believe the same is true of ultraviolet observations in \n general, and I know that extreme UV (short of 1000 Angstroms)\n observations, until the EUVE (launched last year) had almost \n no history except a few observations on Skylab in the '70s.\n\n Twenty-five years ago, the vast majority of astronomers only \n had access to optical or radio instruments.  Now, with far more\n instruments available, growth in some of these new fields has\n resulted in optical work representing a smaller fraction of \n total astronomical work.\n\n\n\nfc> That would be true, if adaptive optics worked well in the visable.\nfc> But take a look at the papers on the subject: They refer to anything\nfc> up to 100 microns as "visable".

(Book Review):\n          \n          \n          "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North \n          Pacific Publishers, Portland, Oregon, 456 pages, indexed, \n          hardcover. \n          \n\n               "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION" contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to \n          most ALL astrophysical mysteries. \n          \n               This book is Volume III of a revised and enlarged \n          edition of "THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE", 1959.  \n          Volume I is "NOTHING BUT MOTION" (1979), and Volume II is \n          "THE BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER" (1988). \n          \n               Most books and journal articles on the subject of \n          astrophysics are bristling with integrals, partial \n          differentials, and other FANCY MATHEMATICS.  In this book, by \n          contrast, mathematics is conspicuous by its absence, except \n          for some relatively simple formulas imbedded in the text.  \n          Larson emphasizes CONCEPTS and declares that mathematical \n          agreement with a theory does NOT guarantee its conceptual \n          validity. \n          \n               Dewey B. Larson was a retired engineer with a Bachelor \n          of Science Degree in Engineering Science from Oregon State \n          University.  He developed the Theory described in his books \n          while trying to find a way to MATHEMATICALLY CALCULATE the \n          properties of chemical compounds based ONLY on the elements \n          they contain. \n          \n               "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION" describes the astrophysical \n          portions of Larson's CONSISTENT, INTEGRATED, COMPREHENSIVE, \n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, a kind of \n          "grand unified field theory" that orthodox physicists and \n          astro-physicists CLAIM to be looking for.  It is built on two \n          postulates about the physical and mathematical nature of \n          space and time: \n          \n               (1) The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE \n          component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE \n          units, and with two RECIPROCAL aspects, SPACE and TIME. \n          \n               (2) The physical universe conforms to the relations of \n          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its primary magnitudes are \n          ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN. \n          \n               From these two postulates, Larson was able to build a \n          COMPLETE theoretical universe, from photons and subatomic \n          particles to the giant elliptical galaxies, by combining the \n          concept of INWARD AND OUTWARD SCALAR MOTIONS with \n          translational, vibrational, rotational, and rotational-\n          vibrational motions.  At each step in the development, he was \n          able to match parts of his theoretical universe with \n          corresponding parts in the real physical universe, including \n          EVEN THINGS NOT YET DISCOVERED.  For example, in his 1959 \n          book, he first predicted the existence of EXPLODING GALAXIES, \n          several years BEFORE astronomers started finding them.  They \n          are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of his comprehensive Theory.  And \n          when quasars were discovered, he had a related explanation \n          ready for those also. \n          \n               As a result of his theory, which he called "THE \n          RECIPROCAL SYSTEM", Larson TOTALLY REJECTED many of the \n          sacred doctrines of orthodox physicists and astrophysicists, \n          including black holes, neutron stars, degenerate matter, \n          quantum wave mechanics (as applied to atomic structure), \n          "nuclear" physics, general relativity, relativistic mass \n          increases, relativistic Doppler shifts, nuclear fusion in \n          stars, and the big bang, all of which he considered to be \n          nothing more than MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES.  He was very \n          critical of the AD HOC assumptions, uncertainty principles, \n          solutions in principle, "no other way" declarations, etc., \n          used to maintain them. \n          \n               "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION" is divided into 31 chapters.  \n          It begins with a description of how galaxies are built from \n          the gravitational attraction between globular star clusters, \n          which are formed from intergalactic gas and dust clouds that \n          accumulate from the decay products of cosmic rays coming in \n          from the ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe.  (Galaxy \n          formation from the MYTHICAL "big bang" is a big mystery to \n          orthodox astronomers.)  He then goes on to describe life \n          cycles of stars and how binary and multiple star systems and \n          solar systems result from Type I supernova explosions of \n          SINGLE stars. \n          \n               Several chapters are devoted to quasars which, according \n          to Larson, are densely-packed clusters of stars that have \n          been ejected from the central bulges of exploding galaxies \n          and are actually traveling FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT \n          (although most of that speed is AWAY FROM US IN TIME). \n          \n               Astronomers and astrophysicists who run up against \n          observations that contradict their theories would find \n          Larson's explanations quite valuable if considered with an \n          OPEN MIND.  For example, they used to believe that GAMMA RAY \n          BURSTS originated from pulsars, which exist primarily in the \n          plane or central bulge of our galaxy.  But the new gamma ray \n          telescope in earth orbit observed that the bursts come from \n          ALL DIRECTIONS UNIFORMLY and do NOT correspond with any \n          visible objects, (except for a few cases of directional \n          coincidence).  Larson's explanation is that the gamma ray \n          bursts originate from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the ANTI-MATTER \n          HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls the "cosmic \n          sector".  Because the anti-matter universe exists in a \n          RECIPROCAL RELATION to our material universe, with the speed \n          of light as the BOUNDARY between them, and has THREE \n          dimensions of time and ONLY ONE dimension of space, the \n          bursts can pop into our material universe ANYWHERE seemingly \n          at random. \n          \n               Larson heavily quotes or paraphrases statements from \n          books, journal articles, and leading physicists and \n          astronomers.  In this book, 351 of them are superscripted \n          with numbers identifying entries in the reference list at the \n          end of the book.  For example, a quote from the book \n          "Astronomy: The Cosmic Journey", by William K. Hartmann, \n          says, "Our hopes of understanding all stars would brighten if \n          we could explain exactly how binary and multiple stars \n          form.... Unfortunately we cannot."  Larson's book contains \n          LOGICAL CONSISTENT EXPLANATIONS of such mysteries that are \n          WORTHY OF SERIOUS CONSIDERATION by ALL physicists, \n          astronomers, and astrophysicists. \n\n\n               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., \n          please consult my CITED SOURCES (Larson's BOOKS). \n\n\n               UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this \n          IMPORTANT Book Review is ENCOURAGED.

Aboard those boosters were a new breed of VENERA probe \n    for the planet Venus. \n\n        Designated VENERA 15 and 16, the probes were meant not for landing\n    yet more spherical craft on the Venerean surface but to radar map the\n    planet in detail from orbit.  To accomplish this task, the basic\n    VENERA design was modified in numerous areas.  The central bus core\n    was made one meter (39.37 inches) longer to carry the two tons of\n    propellant required for braking into orbit, double the fuel carried by\n    the VENERA 9 and 10 orbiters eight years earlier.  Extra solar panels\n    were added on to give the vehicles more power for handling the large\n    amounts of data which would be created by the radar imaging.  The\n    dish-shaped communications antennae were also made one meter larger \n    to properly transmit this information to Earth. \n\n        Atop the buses, where landers were usually placed, were installed\n    the 1.4 by 6-meter (4.62 by 19.8-foot), 300-kilogram (660-pound)\n    POLYUS V side-looking radar antennae.  The radar system, possibly a\n    terrain-imaging version of the nuclear-powered satellites used by \n    the Soviets for Earth ocean surveillance, would be able to map Venus'\n    surface at a resolution of one to two kilometers (0.62 to 1.2 miles). \n\n        The Soviet probes' imaging parameters were a vast improvement over\n    the United States PIONEER VENUS Orbiter, which could reveal objects \n    no smaller than 75 kilometers (45 miles) in diameter.  And while the\n    VENERAs' resolution was comparable to that of similar observations \n    made by the 300-meter (1,000-foot) Arecibo radio telescope on the \n    island of Puerto Rico, the orbiters would be examining the northern\n    pole of Venus.  This region was unobtainable by either Arecibo or \n    PIONEER VENUS and appeared to contain a number of potentially \n    interesting geological features worthy of investigation.\n\n        On October 10, 1983, after an interplanetary journey of 330 \n    million kilometers (198 million miles) and two mid-course corrections, \n    VENERA 15 fired its braking rockets over Venus to place itself in a \n    polar orbit 1,000 by 65,000 kilometers (600 by 39,000 miles) around \n    the planet, completing one revolution every twenty-four hours.  VENERA \n    16 followed suit four days later.  The twin probes thus became Venus' \n    first polar-circling spacecraft.\n\n        Radar operations began on October 16 for VENERA 15 and October 20 \n    for VENERA 16.  For up to sixteen minutes every orbit over the north\n    pole, the probes would make a radar sweep of the surface 150 kilometers \n    (ninety miles) wide and nine thousand kilometers (5,400 miles) long.  \n    The craft would then head out to the highest part of their orbits over \n    the south pole to recharge their batteries and transmit the data back \n    to two large Soviet antennae on Earth.  Each strip of information took \n    eight hours to process by computer.  By the end of their main missions \n    in July of 1984, the VENERAs had mapped 115 million square kilometers \n    (46 million square miles), thirty percent of the entire planet.\n\n        VENERA 15 and 16 revealed that Venus has a surface geology more\n    complex than shown by PIONEER VENUS in the late 1970s.  Numerous hills, \n    mountains, ridges, valleys, and plains spread across the landscape, \n    many of them apparently formed by lava from erupting volcanoes in the \n    last one billion years.  In planetary terms this makes the Venerean \n    surface rather young.  Hundreds of craters were detected as well, the \n    largest of which had to have been created by meteorites (planetoids \n    would be a better term here) at least fourteen kilometers (8.4 miles) \n    across, due to Venus' very dense atmosphere.\n\n        There were some disagreements between U.S. and Soviet scientists\n    on the origins of certain surface features.  For example, the probes' \n    owners declared that the 96-kilometer (57.6-mile) wide crater at the \n    summit of 10,800-meter (35,640-foot) high Maxwell Montes, the tallest \n    mountain on the planet, was the result of a meteorite impact.  American \n    scientists, on the other hand, felt the crater was proof that Maxwell \n    was a huge volcano sitting on the northern "continent" of Ishtar Terra.  \n\n        In any event, the U.S. decided to wait on making verdicts about\n    Venus until the arrival of their own radar probe, scheduled for later\n    in the decade.  Originally named the Venus Orbiting Imaging Radar\n    (VOIR), its initial design was scaled back and the craft was redesig-\n    nated the Venus Radar Mapper (VRM).  Eventually the machine would be \n    called MAGELLAN, after the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan \n    (circa 1480-1521).  This vehicle would map the entire planet in even \n    finer detail than the VENERAs.  For the time, however, the Soviet \n    probes maintained that distinction.\n\n        Radar imaging was not the only ability of the VENERAs.  Bolted\n    next to the POLYUS V radar antenna were the Omega altimeter and the \n    Fourier infrared spectrometer, the latter for measuring the world's\n    temperatures.  The majority of the areas covered registered about\n    five hundred degrees Celsius (932 degrees Fahrenheit), but a few\n    locations were two hundred degrees hotter, possibly indicating \n    current volcanic activity.  The probes also found that the clouds \n    over the poles were five to eight kilometers (three to 4.8 miles) \n    lower than at the equator.  In contrast, the polar air above sixty \n    kilometers (thirty-six miles) altitude was five to twenty degrees \n    warmer than the equatorial atmosphere at similar heights.\n\n        When the main mapping mission ended in July of 1984, there were \n    plans for at least one of the VENERAs to radar image the surface at \n    more southernly latitudes.  Unfortunately this idea did not come to \n    pass, as the orbiters may not have possessed enough attitude-control\n    gas to perform the operation.  \n\n        VENERA 15 and 16 ceased transmission in March of 1985, leaving \n    the Soviet Institute of Radiotechnology and Electronics with six \n    hundred kilometers (360 miles) of radar data tape to sort into an \n    atlas of twenty-seven maps of the northern hemisphere of Venus.\n\n        Venus by Balloon\n\n        For years the thick atmosphere of Venus had been a tempting \n    target to scientists who wished to explore the planet's mantle of \n    air with balloon-borne instruments.  Professor Jacques Blamont of \n    the French space agency Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES)\n    had proposed such an idea as far back as 1967, only to have a joint \n    French-Soviet balloon mission canceled in 1982.  Nevertheless, \n    late in the year 1984, such dreams would eventually come true.\n\n        When two PROTON rockets were sent skyward on December 15 and 21, \n    the Soviet Union provided Western observers with the first clear, full \n    views of the booster which had been launching every Soviet Venus probe \n    since 1975.  This was but one of many firsts for the complex mission.\n\n        The unmanned probes launched into space that December were named\n    VEGA 1 and 2, a contraction of the words VENERA and GALLEI - Gallei\n    being the Russian word for Halley.  Not only did the spacecraft \n    have more than one mission to perform, they also had more than one \n    celestial objective to explore, namely the comet Halley.  \n\n        This famous periodic traveler was making its latest return to \n    the inner regions of the solar system since its last visit in 1910.\n    Since it was widely believed that comets are the icy remains from\n    the formation of the solar system five billion years ago, scientists \n    around the world gave high priority to exploring one of the few such \n    bodies which actually come close to Earth.  \n\n        Most comets linger in the cold and dark outer fringes of the solar \n    system.  Some, like Halley, are perturbed by various forces and fall \n    in towards the Sun, where they circle for millennia spewing out ice \n    and debris for millions of kilometers from the warmth of each solar \n    encounter.\n\n        The Soviet Union, along with the European Space Agency (ESA) and\n    Japan's Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), did not\n    wish to miss out on this first opportunity in human history to make a\n    close examination of Halley.  The ESA would be using the cylindrical\n    GIOTTO probe to make a dangerously close photographic flyby of the \n    comet, while Japan's first deep space craft - SAKIGAKE (Pioneer) and \n    SUISEI (Comet) - would view Halley from a much safer distance. \n\n        Scientists in the United States also desired to study the comet\n    from the vantage of a space probe, at one time envisioning a vessel\n    powered by solar sails or ion engines.  However, government budget\n    cuts to NASA canceled the American efforts.  The U.S. would have to\n    make do primarily with Earth-based observations and the sharing of \n    data from other nations, though an instrument named the Dust Counter \n    and Mass Analyzer (DUCMA), designed by Chicago University Professor \n    John Simpson, was added on the Soviet mission in May of 1984.\n\n        The Soviets' answer to Halley were the VEGAs.  Instead of building\n    an entirely new craft for the mission, the Soviets decided to modify\n    their VENERA bus design to encounter the comet while performing an \n    advanced Venus mission along the way.  As VEGA 1 and 2 reached Venus,\n    the buses would drop off one lander/balloon each and use the mass of \n    the shrouded planet to swing them towards comet Halley, much as the \n    U.S. probe MARINER 10 used Venus to flyby Mercury eleven years earlier. \n    The Soviet craft would then head on to Halley, helping to pinpoint the \n    location of the comet's erupting nucleus for the GIOTTO probe to dive \n    in only 605 kilometers (363 miles) away in March of 1986.\n\n        As planned, the two VEGAs arrived at Venus in June of 1985.  VEGA\n    1 released its payload first on the ninth day of the month, the lander\n    making a two-day descent towards the planet.  The craft touched the\n    upper atmosphere on the morning of June 11.  Sixty-one kilometers\n    (36.6 miles) above the Venerean surface a small container was released\n    by the lander, which produced a parachute at 55 kilometers (33 miles)\n    altitude.  Thus the first balloon probe ever to explore Venus had\n    successfully arrived. \n\n        One kilometer after the opening of the parachute, helium gas was\n    pumped into the Teflon-coated plastic balloon, inflating it to a\n    diameter of 3.54 meters (11.68 feet).  Dangling on a tether thirteen\n    meters (42.9 feet) below was the instrument package, properly known as\n    an aerostat.  The top part of the 6.9-kilogram (15.18-pound) aerostat\n    consisted of a cone which served as an antenna and tether attachment\n    point to the balloon.  Beneath it was the transmitter, electronics,\n    and instruments.  Connected at the bottom was a nephelometer for\n    measuring cloud particles.  The aerostat was painted with a special\n    white finish to keep at bay the corroding mist of sulfuric acid which\n    permeated the planet's atmosphere. \n\n        The VEGA 1 balloon was dropped into the night side of Venus just\n    north of the equator.  Scientists were concerned that the gas bag \n    would burst in the heat of daylight, so they placed it in the darkened \n    hemisphere to give the craft as much time as possible to return data.  \n    This action necessitated that the landers come down in the dark as \n    well, effectively removing the camera systems used on previous missions.  \n    The author wonders, though, if they could have used floodlights similar \n    to the ones attached to VENERA 9 and 10 in 1975, when Soviet scientists \n    had thought the planet's surface was enshrouded in a perpetual twilight \n    due to the permanently thick cloud cover.\n\n        The first balloon transmitted for 46.5 hours right into the day\n    hemisphere before its lithium batteries failed, covering 11,600\n    kilometers (6,960 miles).  The threat of bursting in the day heat did\n    not materialize.  The VEGA 1 balloon was stationed at a 54-kilometer\n    (32.4-mile) altitude after dropping ballast at fifty kilometers\n    (thirty miles), for this was considered the most active of the three\n    main cloud layers reported by PIONEER VENUS in 1978.  Indeed the\n    balloon was pushed across the planet at speeds up to 250 kilometers\n    (150 miles) per hour.  Strong vertical winds bobbed the craft up and\n    down two to three hundred meters (660 to 990 feet) through most of the\n    journey.  The layer's air temperature averaged forty degrees Celsius\n    (104 degrees Fahrenheit) and pressure was a mere 0.5 Earth atmosphere.\n    The nephelometer could find no clear regions in the surrounding clouds. \n\n        Early in the first balloon's flight, the VEGA 1 lander was already\n    headed towards the Venerean surface.  Both landers were equipped with\n    a soil drill and analyzer similar to the ones carried on VENERA 13 \n    and 14 in 1982.  However, VEGA 1 would become unable to report the\n    composition of the ground at its landing site in Rusalka Planitia, the\n    Mermaid Plain north of Aphrodite Terra.  While still ten to fifteen\n    minutes away from landing, a timer malfunction caused the drill to \n    accidentally begin its programmed activity sixteen kilometers (9.6 \n    miles) above the surface. \n\n        There was neither any way to shut off the instrument before\n    touchdown nor reactivate it after landing.  This was unfortunate not\n    only for the general loss of data but also for the fact that most of\n    Venus was covered with such smooth low-level lava plains and had never \n    before been directly examined.  Nevertheless, the surface temperature \n    and pressure was calculated at 468 degrees Celsius (874.4 degrees \n    Fahrenheit) and 95 Earth atmospheres respectively during the lander's \n    56 minutes of ground transmissions.  A large amount of background \n    infrared radiation was also recorded at the site.\n\n        As had been done when the drills and cameras on VENERA 11 and \n    12 had failed in December of 1978, the Soviets focused on the data\n    returned during the lander's plunge through the atmosphere.  The\n    French-Soviet Malachite mass spectrometer detected sulfur, chlorine, \n    and possibly phosphorus.  It is the sulfur - possibly from active \n    volcanoes - which gives the Venerean clouds their yellowish color.\n    The Sigma 3 gas chromatograph found that every cubic meter of air\n    between an altitude of 48 and 63 kilometers (28.8 and 37.8 miles)\n    contained one milligram (0.015 grain) of sulfuric acid.\n\n        The VEGA 1 data on the overall structure of the cloud decks \n    appeared to be at odds with the information from PIONEER VENUS.\n    The case was made even stronger by the fact that VEGA 2's results\n    nearly matched its twin.  The VEGAs found only two main cloud layers \n    instead of the three reported by the U.S. probes.  The layers were \n    three to five kilometers (1.8 to 3 miles) thick at altitudes of 50 \n    and 58 kilometers (30 and 34.8 miles).  The clouds persisted like a\n    thin fog until clearing at an altitude of 35 kilometers (21 miles), \n    much lower than the PV readings.  One possibility for the discrepan-\n    cies may have been radical structural changes in the Venerean air \n    over the last seven years.\n\n        When the lander and balloon finally went silent, the last \n    functioning part of the VEGA 1 mission, the flyby bus, sailed on\n    for a 708 million-kilometer (424.8 million-mile) journey around\n    the Sun to become the first probe to meet comet Halley.  On March\n    6, 1986, the bus made a 8,890-kilometer (5,334-mile) pass at the \n    dark and icy visitor before traveling on in interplanetary space.\n    The Soviets had accomplished their first mission to two celestial\n    bodies with one space vessel.\n\n        On June 13, VEGA 2 released its lander/balloon payload for\n    a two-day fall towards Venus.  Like its duplicate, the VEGA 2\n    balloon radioed information back to the twenty antennae tracking\n    it on Earth for 46.5 hours before battery failure on the morning\n    side of the planet.  During its 11,100-kilometer (6,660-mile)\n    flight over Venus, the second balloon entered in a rather still\n    environment which became less so twenty hours into the mission.\n    After 33 hours mission time the air became even more turbulent \n    for a further eight hours.  When the balloon passed over a five-\n    kilometer (three-mile) mountain on the "continent" of Aphrodite \n    Terra, a powerful downdraft pulled the craft 2.5 kilometers (1.5 \n    miles) towards the surface.\n\n        Temperature sensors on the VEGA 2 balloon reported that the air \n    layer it was moving through was consistently 6.5 degrees Celsius \n    (43.7 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than the area explored by the VEGA 1\n    balloon.  This was corroborated by the VEGA 2 lander as it passed \n    through the balloon's level.  No positive indications of lightning\n    were made by either balloon, and the second aerostat's nephelometer \n    failed to function.\n\n        The VEGA 2 lander touched down on the northern edge of Aphrodite\n    Terra's western arm on the fifteenth of June, 1,500 kilometers (900\n    miles) southeast of VEGA 1.  The lander's resting place was smoother\n    than thought, indicating either a very ancient and worn surface or a\n    relatively young one covered in fresh lava.  The soil drill was in\n    working order and reported a rock type known as anorthosite-troctolite, \n    rare on Earth but present in Luna's highlands.  This rock is rich in \n    aluminum and silicon but lacking in iron and magnesium.  A high degree \n    of sulfur was also present in the soil.  The air around VEGA 2 measured \n    463 degrees Celsius (865.4 degrees Fahrenheit) and 91 Earth atmospheres,\n    essentially a typical day (or night) on Venus.\n\n        Far above the VEGA 2 lander, its carrier bus sped past Venus at\n    a distance of 24,500 kilometers (14,700 miles) and followed its twin \n    to comet Halley, making a closer flyby on March 9, 1986 at just 8,030 \n    kilometers (4,818 miles).  Both probes helped to reveal that the comet \n    is a very dark and irregular-shaped mass about fourteen kilometers \n    (8.4 miles) across, rotating once every 53 hours, give or take three \n    hours.\n\n        Since both VEGA craft were still functioning after their Halley\n    encounters, Soviet scientists considered an option to send the \n    probes to other celestial objects.  One prime target was the near-\n    Earth planetoid 2101 Adonis, which VEGA 2 could pass at a distance \n    of six million kilometers (3.6 million miles).  Sadly, the Soviets \n    had to back out on the opportunity to become the first nation to fly \n    a spacecraft past a planetoid when it was discovered that there was \n    not enough maneuvering fuel in the probe to reach Adonis as planned.  \n    VEGA 1 and 2 were quietly shut down in early 1987.\n\n        Future Plans Diverted\n\n        The impressive VEGA mission had given some scientists numerous \n    ideas and hope for even more ambitious expeditions to the second \n    world from the Sun.  One example was the VESTA mission, planned for\n    the early 1990s.\n\n        This Soviet-French collaboration called for the launch of multiple \n    probes on a single PROTON rocket in either 1991 or 1992.  The craft \n    would first swing by Venus and drop off several landers and balloon \n    probes.  The aerostats would be designed to survive in the planet's \n    corrosive atmosphere for up to one month, a large improvement over \n    the VEGA balloons' two days.  The mission would then head out to \n    investigate several planetoids and comets, including a possible \n    landing on Vesta (thus the mission name), the most reflective Main \n    Belt planetoid as seen from Earth.\n\n        Unfortunately for Venus exploration, plans began to change in\n    the Soviet Union.  In 1986 the Soviets decided to reroute the VESTA\n    mission to the red planet Mars instead of Venus, keeping the comet\n    and planetoid aspects intact.  By this time in the Soviet space \n    program interest was focusing on Mars.  Already under construction \n    was an entirely new probe design called PHOBOS.  Two members of this \n    class were planned to leave Earth in 1988 and orbit Mars the next \n    year.  PHOBOS 1 and 2 would then place the first instruments on\n    Mars' largest moon, Phobos. \n\n        All this was a prelude to even more advanced Mars expeditions,\n    including balloon probes, rovers, soil sample return craft, and \n    eventually human explorers in the early Twenty-First Century.\n    The environment of Venus was just too hostile for any serious\n    consideration of human colonization in the near future.\n\n        But things began to look bleak for Soviet Venus and Mars\n    exploration.  Both PHOBOS probes failed to complete their missions,\n    one losing contact on the way to the Red Planet in 1988 and the other\n    going silent in Mars orbit just one week before the planned moon\n    landing in March of 1989. \n\n        In 1989 a plan was devised for a Venus orbiter to drop eight to\n    ten penetrators around the planet in 1998.  Several years later the\n    mission launch date was moved to the year 2005 and has now been put \n    on indefinite hold.  No other official Soviet missions to Venus have\n    since been put forth, a sad commentary after twenty-five years of\n    continuous robotic exploration of the planet. \n\n        During the late 1980s a drastic political and economic change\n    was taking over the Soviet Union.  President Mikhail Gorbachev began \n    to "open up" his nation to the benefits of increased cooperation with \n    the rest of the nations, particularly those in the West.  While the \n    culture became less oppressive than in the past, the economy was taking \n    a very rough ride as it also underwent the effects of a "free market".\n\n        These effects hit everywhere, including the space program.\n    Missions at all levels were cut back.  The Soviets began making\n    almost desperate attempts to cooperate with other space-faring\n    nations either to keep their remaining programs alive or just to \n    make money.  \n\n        In early 1992 it was reported that the Soviets were offering for \n    sale several fully-equipped VENERAs they had in storage for the price \n    of 1.6 million dollars each, an incredibly low price for any planetary \n    probe.  No nation took them up on the bargain.  Meanwhile the United \n    States was gearing up for new Venus missions of their own.\n\n        MAGELLAN and GALILEO \n\n        The U.S. reactivated their long-dormant planetary exploration\n    with the launch of the Space Shuttle ATLANTIS on May 4, 1989.\n    Aboard the Shuttle was the MAGELLAN spacecraft, a combination of\n    spare parts from other U.S. probes designed to make the most \n    detailed and complete radar-mapping of Venus in history.  When\n    MAGELLAN reached the second world in August of 1990, it would be\n    able to map almost the entire planet down to a resolution of 108\n    meters (360 feet), surpassing the abilities of VENERA 15 and 16.\n\n        In the interim another American probe was launched from a Space \n    Shuttle which would make a quick flyby of Venus on its way to orbit \n    the giant planet Jupiter in 1995.  On October 18, 1989, the Shuttle \n    ATLANTIS released its second unmanned planetary probe into space, \n    named GALILEO after the famous Italian astronomer who discovered the \n    probe's primary target's major moons in 1610.\n\n        In the absence of a powerful enough booster to send GALILEO on\n    a direct flight to the Jovian planet, the probe was sent around\n    Venus and Earth several times to build up enough speed to reach\n    Jupiter.  As a result, Venus became GALILEO's first planetary\n    goal in February of 1990.  The probe radioed back images of the\n    planet's swirling clouds and further indications of lightning in\n    that violent atmosphere.\n\n        On the Drawing Boards\n\n        With the incredible success of MAGELLAN in the last few years,\n    new plans have been laid out for further journeys to Venus.  Scien-\n    tists in the U.S. have talked to space scientists in the former Soviet \n    Union - now the Commonwealth of Independent States since January 1, \n    1992 - of a cooperative effort to launch new VENERA lander missions \n    within in the next decade.  Japan, India, and the ESA have also\n    considered their own Venus missions in the next few decades.\n\n        In February of 1993 NASA came up with several new Venus projects \n    as part of their Discovery Program for launching inexpensive probes\n    throughout the solar system.  For Venus two missions were selected\n    for further study:  A Venus Multiprobe Mission involving the landing\n    of fourteen small probes over one hemisphere to measure winds, air\n    temperature, and pressure; and the Venus Composition Probe, designed\n    to study Venus' atmosphere while descending through the thick air\n    with the aid of a parachute, much as the Soviets had done since 1967.\n    Final project decisions will be made in 1994.\n\n        Humans on Venus      \n\n        Will a human ever be able to stand on the surface of Venus?\n    At present the lead-melting temperatures and crushing air pressure\n    would be threatening to any Earth life not protected in something\n    even tougher than a VENERA lander.  Plans have been looked into\n    changing the environment of Venus itself into something more like\n    Earth's.  However, it should be noted that any such undertaking\n    will require the removal of much of the thick carbon dioxide \n    atmosphere, a major reduction in surface heat, and the ability \n    to speed up the planet's rotation rate to something a bit faster\n    than once every 243 Earth days.  Such a project may take centuries\n    if not millennia.\n\n        In the meantime efforts should be made to better understand\n    Venus as its exists today.  We still have yet to fully know how\n    a world so seemingly similar to Earth in many important ways became\n    instead such a deadly place.  Will Earth ever suffer this fate?\n    Perhaps Venus holds the answers.  Such answers may best be found\n    through international cooperation, including the nation which \n    made the first attempts to lift the cloudy veils from Venus.\n\n        Bibliography -\n\n         Barsukov, V.

TRry the SKywatch project in  Arizona.
We`ve had the the Great Western, the [ dunno ] and the Great Northern\npostulated as Brunel`s masterpiece. Keep boxing the compass chaps, you`ll\nget round to it eventually.\n\nThe Great Western was a highly successful transatlantic mail ship,\nwith hybrid sail and steam propulsion. The Great Eastern, which broke\nthe 'Little Giant' financially and otherwise, was a revolutionary leap\nforward in ship design. A thirty thousand ton all steel vessel, with\nprimary steam propulsion, it was at the time easily the biggest ocean\ngoing vessel ever built. Brunel took advantage of the fact that cargo\nand / or fuel capacity rose with the cube of scale, while drag rose\nwith the square, so a really big ship could steam thousands of miles\nwithout coaling.\n\nUnfortunately, there was no real market for such a beast at the time,\nand it was eventually sold off at scrap values. As another poster\nsaid, it then went on to a successful career as a telegraph cable\nlaying ship. It was in fact the only ship of its day capable of laying\na transatlantic cable in one go, with the endurance and capacity to\ncarry the huge reel all the way, and the manoeuverabilty to dredge for\ndefective sections. See Arthur C Clarke`s book "How the World was One"\n[ I think that`s right ]\n\nIf that`s how the Shuttle goes down in history, as a technical triumph\nand a financial disaster for the builder, it would not be entirely\nignoble, but I doubt if history will be so charitable.  Its true the\nShuttle can do things no other launch system can do, but are they\nworth doing? With low cost access to space, you could have an\naffordable space station for doing shuttle-like extended manned\nmissions. As it is, the shuttle is not so much a space-truck as a\nspace-RV, ( only not so cheap to run :-( )
Another factor against bringing the HST back to Earth is risk of contamination.
Getting wierd again?\n\nOkay we have figure out that a mission specifically to Pluto is to large and to\nexpensive..\n\nOkay what about launching one probe with multiple parts.. Kind of liek the old\nMIRV principle of old Cold War Days. \nBasically what I mean is design a mother ship that has piggy backed probes for\ndifferent missions,namely different planets. Each probe would be tied in with\nthe mother ship (or earth as the case may be).. This is good when and if we go\nfor Mars (the MArs mission can act as either Mother ship or relay point for the\nprobes.\n\nAlso the mother ship would be powered (if not the Mars Mission) by a normal\npropulsion, but also a solar sail (main reason for solar sail race is to see\nwhat can be done and autmoated?) the sail would get the probes to were they\nneeded.. I know the asteroid/meteor clouds (and such) might get in the way of a \nSail??\n\nMain reasonf ro mother ship idea is to make it more economoical to send\nmultiple probes/mission/satellites/exploreres to different places and cut\ncosts..\nThe probes could do fly bys or ?? we shall see...

Uh, why do they have to ask a state commision? Unless the state's buying...\n\nSuch a process will only increace the overhead to the power company\nof selling different types of light, and will decreace the likleihood\nthat they will do so. And any efficient lights they might have been\nplanning in the future, go down the drain.....\n\n\nYou could order it special. If enough people did so, it would be \nlow cost. Last I checked, you could use UPS to buy stuff in Arizona\nbefore going there.\n\nFinally, I'm sure your state has things like small factories and\nmachine shops. You could go into business making lights that are\ncheaper to use (thanks to their higher efficiency and the\nfact that they aren't wasting energy on broadcasting to space)\nand therefore _better_ than the old style...\n\n\nFive year plans have to be enacted or the planning for the economy\nwill fall apart.\n  \n\nAs if the clean air act really cleaned up the air...\n\n\n_MY_ *experience* seems to suggest that you're trying too hard\nto *educate* them (with the same methods used in American schools\nto make any subject whatsoever as relevant and boring as Proto-Ugric)\ninstead of *selling* them on the idea.\n\n...\n\nWell, wake up. Space is becoming a field of human endeavor\ninstead of just something we can look at from a long long\nway away. There are practical space projects that could conceivably\n(although probably not) cause lots of light pollution, and \nhave been argued against on those grounds, even though they\nmight open up such possibilities, that people could vacation on\nMars if they wanted really dark skies...
Jonathan, interesting questions.  Some wonder whether or not the moon could\nhave ever supported an atmosphere.  I'd be interested in knowing what\nour geology/environmental sciences friends think.\n\nAs for human tolerances, the best example of human endurance in terms\nof altitude (i.e. low atmospheric pressure and lower oxygen partial pressure)\nis in my opinion to the scaling of Mt. Everest without oxygen assistance.\nThis was accomplished by a team of mountaineers who trained at high\naltitudes for quite awhile (I think a few months) and then were flown by\nhelicopter from that training altitude to the equivalent altitude on\nMount Everest, where they began the ascent of our planet's highest peak\nwithout oxygen tanks.  This is quite a feat of physiological endurance, because\nif you or I tried to go to 20,000 feet and exert ourselves, we would probably\npass out, get altitude sick, and could even die from cerebral edema. So\nthis is the limit of low pressure.  High pressure situations would be\nlimited by the duration of time which it takes to slowly acclimate to a higher\npressure.  Skin divers would know alot about high pressure situations and\ncould tell you about how they safely make deep dives without getting the\nbends.  Some military experiments have put people under several atmospheres of\npressure (not sure what the high limit was because the papers aren't in\nfront of me).  Usually at a certain point, the nitrogen in the air becomes\ntoxic to the body and you start acting idiotic.  Divers call this nitrogen\nnarcosis.  Those afflicted can do very dangerous and irrational things, like\ntaking off a diving mask and oxygen tank in order to talk to fish at 100 feet\nunder water.  (Hope any diving folk can elaborate on this matter, as I\nam not a diving expert).\n\nMars cannot support human life without pressurization because the atmosphere\nis too thin (1/100 th  our Earth's atmospheric density).  In addition,\nthe Mars atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide.  Basically, you would need a \npressure suit there, or you'd die from the low pressure.  Interesting huh?
"The Forever War", one of my favorite SciFi books, had a passage devoted to \nbreathing fluids. The idea was to protect people from the high accelerations \nrequired for interstellar travel by emersing the passengers in dry-cleaning \nfluid saturated with oxygen. Plenty of very imaginative ideas is this book.\nI would certainly recommend it (won the Hugo and the Nebula awards).
Yes a flotation tank, combined with floride breathing water(REF: the Abyss\nbreathing solution I think).. also the right position of the astronaut and\nstrapping you can probably get much more than 45gs in an accesloration..\nMore like near 100g (or somewhat less)..\n\nSaw I book called the "Time Master" (I thjink that was the title) that had some\nideas on how fast and all you could go..
_The_ problem with Oort cloud sources is that absolutely\n      no plausible mechanism has been proposed. It would have\n      to involve new physics as far as I can tell. Closest to\n      "conventional" Oort sources is a model of B-field pinching\n      by comets, it's got too many holes in it to count, but at\n      least it was a good try...\n\n   So you have a plausible model for GRB's at astronomical distances?\n\nI don't have any plausible models for GRBs at any distances ;-)\n\n   Recent observations have just about ruled out the merging neutron star\n   hypothesis, which had a lot of problems, anyhow.  We have to look for\n   implausible models and what is fundamentally allowed independent of\n   models.\n\nHmm, the "superbowl" burst has been claimed in press releases\nto cast doubt on the merging NS hypothesis, from what I've read\n(and I haven't seen the papers, only the press) I'd say it is\nconsistent with some of the merging NS models\n\n   A paper on the possibility of GRB's in the Oort cloud just came\n   through the astrophysics abstract service.  To get a copy of this\n\n   Here is the abstract of that paper.\n\n ...\n      indicator to these events all possible sources which are\n      isotropically distributed should remain under consideration. This is\n      why the Oort cloud of comets is kept on the list,\n      although there is no known mechanism for generating \GRBs\n      from cometary nuclei. Unlikely as it may seem, the possibility that \GRBs\n      originate in the solar cometary cloud\n      cannot be excluded until it is disproved.\n\nThis does not propose a _mechanism_ for GRBs in the Oort (and, no,\nanti-matter annihilation does not fit the spectra at least as far\nas I understand annihilation spectra...). Big difference.\nThat's ignoring the question of how you fit a distribution\nto the Oort distribution when the Oort distribution is not well\nknown - in particular comet aphelia (which are not well known)\nare not a good measure of the Oort cloud distribution...
Back in January and February there were several articles (Wash Post, Time...)\nsaying that NASA was "considering" the option just as it is now "considering"\na followup mission 6-12 months after the servicing mission.  However, the\ndown time was estimated to be a year+ (servicing, checkout, sceheduling\nand training another shuttle, orbit verification...) and to be quite\nexpensive.  I think it may have been more a mental exercise than a\nreal plan.  Don't know.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRobert Dempsey                                 (410) 338-1334\nSTScI/PODPS                                                                   \n\n"He which hath no stomach for this fight, Let him depart; his passport\nshall be made, and crowns for convoy put into his purse: We would not die\nin this man's company that fears his fellowship to die with us." -Shakespeare

My apologies if this is a re-post - I submitted it on Friday, but \ngot a message that my post might not have gone out.  Considering \nthe confusing spitting contest over 'rights', (there are TOO \ninalienable rights damn it!  The majority can be just as destructive \nof liberty as a despot), I suspect that my post did not get out \nof my site.    (I ain't saying that dark skies are included in these \nrights, although we can only preserve any rights by exercising them.) \n\n\n\nAnyway, here are my thoughts on this: \n\n\nI'd like to add that some of the "protests" do not come from a strictly \npractical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for \nresearch activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I \nwould complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may \nnever have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - \nunsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars \nas profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and \na pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time \n- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. \nAny lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  \nWhole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there \nand becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief \nin an afterlife.  \n\nThe Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks \nand Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light \ncrossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people \nis still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating \nthe scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or \nthousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  \nBut there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. \n\nYes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live \nin a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport \ncurrently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The \nimpact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists \nthat has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped \ninto shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life \nforms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels \n(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains \none weekend, "getting away from it all" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, \nmalls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed \nthe hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 \nmiles to the east.  (Their 'security light' didn't help matters \nmuch either.)  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of \nhigh air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. \n\nBut there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't \nfouled in some way.  (I mean they've been TRYING this forever - \nlike, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don't watch \ncommercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, \ntruck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  \nIf ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at \nleast consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last\nbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  \n\nTo be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage \nof HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at \n8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the \nlocal meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I'll be trying to see it \nif I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could \nbe called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky \nwhile complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that \nas it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, \neven if it can't ever be perfectly achieved. \n\nRegards, \nWm. Hathaway \nBaltimore MD
It's been suggested.  (Specifically, lightning strikes between clouds\nin the interstellar medium.)
How hard or easy would it be to have a combo mission such as a solar sail on\nthe way out to the outer planets, but once in near to orbit to use more normal\nmeans..\nSeems that everyone talks about using one system and one system only per\nmission, why not have more than one propulsion system? Or did I miss\nsomething.. ?? or did it die in committee?\n==\nMichael Adams, nsmca@acad3.alaska.edu -- I'm not high, just jacked
Ahh, perhaps that's why we've (astronomers) have just built *2* 10-meter\nground-based scopes and are studying designs for larger ones.\nSeriously, though, you're never going to get a 10-meter scope into orbit\nas cheaply as you can build one on the ground, and with adaptive optics\nand a good site, the difference in quality is narrowed quite a bit\nanyway.  Also, scopes in low orbit (like Hubble) can only observe things\ncontinuously for ~45 minutes at a time, which can be a serious\nlimitation.\n\n\nI sure as hell does if the 'point of light' is half a degree in extent\nand as bright as the moon.  Have you ever noticed how much brighter the\nnight sky is on a moonlit night?\n\n\n\nExisting satellites *are* points of light, but an advertising sign that\nappeared as a point would be useless, so I rather think these will\nappear larger than a 'typical' satellite.  Also, satellite tracks *are*\nruining lots of plates in the current Palomar Sky Survey.\n\nWhat deparment are you in anyway, Philosophy?  You obviously are not\nqualified to speak about astronomy...
Regarding the feasability of retrieving the HST for repair and\nrelaunching it:\n\n(Caution: speculation mode engaged)\nThere is another consideration that hasn't been mentioned yet.\nI expect that retrieving HST would involve 'damaging' it considerably in\norder to return it to its cradle in the cargo bay.  Most of the deployed\nitems (antennas and, especially, the solar arays) probably are not\nretractable into their fully stowed position, even by hand.  They would\nhave to be removed by the astronauts.  (The only advantage that this\nmight yield is that we could put new panels on that don't 'ring' due\nto thermal cycle stresses...)\n\nI also expect that, as has been discussed, the landing loads on the\nHST optics structure is a big issue (but that the reentry loads are\nmuch less so.)  Can the moveable optical components even be re-caged\n(I assume that they were caged for launch)?\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMichael Corvin 	      				zwork@starfighter.den.mmc.com\nGN&C R&D					Martin Marietta Astronautics\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n===============    My views, not Martin Marietta's   ========================
I would appreciate any thoughts on what makes a planet habitable for Humans.\nI am making asumptions that life and a similar atmosphere evolve given a range\nof physical aspects of the planet.  The question is what physical aspects\nsimply disallow earth like conditions.\n\neg Temperature range of 280K to 315K (where temp is purely dependant on dist\n     from the sun and the suns temperature..)\n   Atmospheric presure ? - I know nothing of human tolerance\n   Planetary Mass ? - again gravity at surface is important, how much\n     can human bodies take day after day.  Also how does the mass effect\n     atmosphere.  I thinking of planets between .3 and 3 times mass of the\n     earth.  I suppose density should be important as well.\n\nClimate etc does not concern me, nor does axial tilt etc etc.  Just the above\nthree factors and how they relate to one another.\n\nJonathan\n--
Not useful unless you've got some truly wonderful propulsion system for\nthe mother ship that can't be applied to the probes.  Otherwise it's\nbetter to simply launch the probes independently.  The outer planets\nare scattered widely across a two-dimensional solar system, and going\nto one is seldom helpful in going to the next one.  Uranus is *not* on\nthe way to Neptune.  Don't judge interplanetary trajectories in general\nby what the Voyagers did:  they exploited a lineup that occurs only\nevery couple of centuries, and even so Voyager 2 took a rather indirect\nroute to Neptune.\n\n\nSolar sails are pretty useless in the outer solar system.  They're also\nvery slow, unless you assume quite advanced versions.

On-orbit, SSME's are just dead weight, since we don't have an\nSSME H2/O2 pressurization mechanism which works in zero-G.  This means\nthat you can't use them for re-boost or anything else.  Dead weight has\na couple of advantages, but more disadvantages.\n\nThrow-away SSME's might let us use some of the old SSME's which are not-\nquite-man-ratable.  But I doubt we'd do that; the cost of a launch\nfailure is too high.\n\n-- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office\n      kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov  (713) 483-4368
I understand the when one is in orbit, the inward force of gravity at\none's center of mass is exactly balanced by the outward centrifugal\nforce from the orbiting motion, resulting in weightlessness.\n\n I want to know what weightlessness actually FEELS like.

[Stuff deleted]\n\nWould Mr. Hart please explain how one could get every nation on\nearth and every corporation to agree that astronomers own the\nnight sky without `coercion'.   Remember that not every nation\nfollows the English common law.   In most countries, for most of\nhistory, it was probably true that the rulers `owned' everything\nnot explicitly owned by individuals.   Even in North America,\nwhere by the principle enunciated, the aboriginal inhabitants should\nhave owned everything, when new arrivals wanted to use land\nand resources, they just took it over.  In case Mr. Hart hasn't noticed,\nthere is currently a brutal war going on in Bosnia about who owns what.\nOf course, if some friendly super power were to give an international\nastronomy organization some anti-satelite missiles and also agree\nto defend it if attacked, such a proposal might work, but it\nwould hardly be non-coercive.\n\nSome of us nutty environmentalists think it might make sense first\nto try to mobilize public opinion against advertising in space\nand also to use governmental actions (like taxing power, for example)\nto discourage them.   This of course would be too coercive for\nMr. Hart.
No, the sky does not, at this time, belong to anyone.  Ownership is necessary\nto the definition because someone has to have the authority to decide if the\naction was good or bad.  If neither you or I own a brick wall, then I can't\nunilaterally declare that spraypainting my name on it is right, and you don't\nhave the authority to declare that it is wrong.  The owner may find it artistic\nor she may be call the police.\n\n(this applies to the argument on bright satellites more than street lights)\n\nIt's vandalism because many people -- power companies -- do maliciously waste light. \n\n"maliciously" implies evil intent.  The lighting companies aren't going out\nof their way to spoil the sky.  They just don't care.\n\n\nIt is the responsibility of the customer to choose the most efficient hardware.\nIf that's what your city will buy, that's what the lighting company will sell.\nWrite a letter to city hall.\n\nPlease note that I'm not defending light pollution.  The orignial focus of \nthis thread was space based light sources.
One of the main reasons nations like the US and RUSSIA observe satellite\n  that have been launched is FORBs system whick loft nuclear bombs into\n  orbit which are planned to be detonated in LEO causing EMP pulses\n  interfering with the target command and control system.
Bear in mind that a lot of the Vandenberg launch traffic is military and\nat least semi-secret.  They aren't interested in publicizing it beforehand.
I didn't think the bi-stem design was used so much for the retrieval as\nfor the ability to launch in a tight (size) STS envelope.  This is my own \nguess, based on similar designs flown on other large STS-launched s/c \n(GRO, UARS).  Also, there _might_ be some consideration given to mass \nrequirements (bi-stems weight less than conventional S/A).  Finally, \nthe HST arrays _do_ have the ability to be detached--remember, they're \ngoing to be replaced with new arrays.\n\nHowever, as an ACS guy who's seen his branch management pull their\ncollective hair out over HST, I would voice a hearty 'yea' to using\nconventional arrays over bi-stems, whenever possible.  No half hertz\nflexible modes, no thermal snap, no problem.
Could someone explain where these names come from?   I'm sure there's a \n   perfectly good reason to name a planetoid "Smiley," but I'm equally sure \n   that I don't know what that reason is.\n\nRead John le Carre's "Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy", "The Honorable Schoolboy"\nor "Smiley's People".
No, no, no!  The previous one was called "Smiley".  1992 QB1 = Smiley,\nand 1993 FW = Karla.\n\nNote that neither name is official.  It seems the discoverers have an\naversion to the designation scheme.
Let me get this right - sorry, try again.  Let me get this straight - \nwell maybe that too is a poor choice of words - someone might think \nI'm pushing a gay agenda.  How about:  let me try to understand this \nby re-phrasing it as an extreme.  I, as a minority of one, have no right \nto a beautiful world.  You, on the other hand have the right to make an \nugly one because you presume to speak for all the rest.  And I cannot \ncomplain.  Curious. \n\n.. \n\n\nAnd do you want everyone to do as you wish (insist on putting something \nup that will impact everyone for selfish reasons) _without_ any legislation?  \nAnd no one else can even object?  Somehow I think this whole shoving \ncontest has gotten way off the track.  I'm ready to let this thread \ndie a quick and merciful death.
Would someone please send me a list of the historic space flights?  I \nam not looking for a list of all flights, just the ones in which something \nmonumental happened.  Or better yet, is there an ftp site with the list of all\nshuttle flights?

If re-boosting the HST by carrying it with a shuttle would not damage it,\nthen why couldn't HST be brought back to earth and the repair job done\nhere?\n\nIs it because two shuttle flights would be required, adding to the alredy\nhorrendous expense?\n\nGruss,\nDr Bruce Scott                             The deadliest bullshit is\nMax-Planck-Institut fuer Plasmaphysik       odorless and transparent\nbds at spl6n1.aug.ipp-garching.mpg.de                 -- W Gibson
You'll find that in Allen, C.W., "Astrophysical Quantities", Athlone\nPress, Dover, NH, 3rd edition, pp. 268-269 (1973).  To the accuracy it can\nbe calculated (see specific references in Allen about how it is\ncalculated), the temperature is 3 degrees K.\n\n     Lots of people have remarked on this temperature.  The first may have\nbeen in Eddington's book, "Internal Constitution of Stars", Ch. 13 (1926;\nreprinted 1986), where he gives the "temperature of space" as 3 degrees.\n\n     The source of this temperature is the radiation of starlight.\n\n\n     To the accuracy of measurement, it's the same temperature.  Some of us\nthink this may not be a coincidence.  -|Tom|-

David gives good explaination of the deductions from the isotropic,\n   'edged' distribution, to whit, they are either part of the Universe or\n   part of the Oort cloud.\n\n   Why couldn't they be Earth centred, with the edge occuring at the edge\n   of the gravisphere? I know there isn't any mechanism for them, but there\n   isn't a mechanism for the others either.\n\nWhat on Earth is the "gravisphere"?\nAnyway, before it's decay the Pioneer Venus Orbiter\nhad a gamma ray detector, as does Ulysses, they \ndetect the brightest bursts that the Earth orbit detectors\ndo, so the bursts are at least at Oort cloud distances.\nIn principle four detectors spaced out by a few AU would\nsee parallax if the bursts are of solar system origin.\n\n_The_ problem with Oort cloud sources is that absolutely\nno plausible mechanism has been proposed. It would have\nto involve new physics as far as I can tell. Closest to\n"conventional" Oort sources is a model of B-field pinching\nby comets, it's got too many holes in it to count, but at\nleast it was a good try...
And from whence does this right stem, that it overrides the 'rights'\nof the rest of us?\n\n\nAnd if you want to view that television station, you have to watch the\ncommercials.  You can't turn them off and still be viewing the\ntelevision station.  In other words, if you don't like what you see,\ndon't look.  There is no 'right' I can think of that you have to force\nother people to conform to your idea of aesthetic behaviour.  What's\nnext, laws regulating how people must dress and look so as to appeal\nto your fashion sense, since you have this 'right' of an aesthetic\nview? \n\n\n\n\nWhich has what to do with the topic of discussion?\n\n\n\nOh, I see.  You don't want any legislation that might impinge on you;\nyou just want everyone else on the planet to do what you want.\n\n-- \n"Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live\n in the real world."   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden
If you've got a good propulsion system that's not useful for deceleration,\nsure you can use chemical rockets for that part... but even just doing the\ndeceleration chemically is a major headache.  We're talking seriously high\ncruising velocities; taking the velocity down nearly to zero for a Pluto\norbit isn't easy with chemical fuels.\n\nIncidentally, solar sails are not going to be suitable as the acceleration\nsystem for something like this.  They don't go anywhere quickly.  (I speak\nas head of mission planning for the Canadian Solar Sail Project, although\nthat is more or less an honorary title right now because CSSP is dormant.)\nThey can't fly a mission like this unless you start talking about very\nadvanced systems that drop in very close to the Sun first.

I'm not sure if this is a big issue, but it seems to me like it\nmight be -- up till now, all >1g forces applied to the mirror and\nits mounting (and nearly all =1g forces) have been applied along the\ntelescope's optical axis, and against the mirror's base.  Reentry\nwould apply forces along roughly the same axis, but tending to pull\nthe mirror away from the mount, and the landing would apply on-edge\nforces to both the mirror and mount.  It could be that one or both\nof these would not survive.\n\ngreg\n--

Someone from NASA posted that there were very significant mass margins\non the HST re-boost mission.  A while back i had asked why not carry\nthe EDO pallet up,  and the answer was the mass margins were tight enough, they weren't even carrying extra suits.\n\n\nWhere's wingo when you need him:-)\n\nCOme on.   Knock that S**T off.\n\nYOu forget,  that during skylab,  they did  overnight mission planning\nfor the repair EVA's.   Also during theøÄ   \nIntelsat Mission,   they did overnight  WETF simulations.\nI somehow think they could train up a new  EVA in  8 months.\n\nAnd as for building hardware,  anything can  be built if you want it\nbad enough.\n\nYOu forget,  the  BUS 1  is already built.  all they'd ahve to do\nis soup it up, even test it  on a delta mission.\n\nDon't get into this mode of  negativism.   besides,  at the rate\nmissions slip,   the Discovery won't launch on this mission until\nMarch.  that's almost a year.\n\n\nAh,  but how much more expensive is the Second HST servicing mission.\n\nYOu forget,  there is a bum FGS,  the Solar array electronics, are\ngetting hinky  and there is still 8 months until the servicing mission.\n\nThe time for the space walks are growing rapidly.  THis was orignally\nplanned out as 3 spacewalks,  now they are at 5 EVA's  with 3 reserve\nwalks.\n\nIf the SMT can avoid a second servicing mission that's $500 million\nsaved.  If the Weight savings,  means they  can sit on orbit  for 30 Days.\nand  handle any contingency  problems,  that's quite a savings.\n\n\n\nOf course,  there wasn't any need for the Saturn  V  after apollo too.\n\nas for the problems with the aperture door,  I am sure they can\nwork out some way to handle  that.  Maybe a Plug  made from\nFrozen ice.?   it'll keep out any contamination,\nyet sublime away  after teh boost.
A bright light phenomenon was observed in the Eastern Finland\n    on April 21. At 00.25 UT two people saw a bright, luminous\n    pillar-shaped phenomenon in the low eastern horizont near\n    Mikkeli. The head of the pillar was circular. The lower part\n    was a little winding. It was like a monster they told. They\n    were little frightened. Soon the yellowish pillar became\n    enlarged. A bright spot like the Sun was appeared in the middle\n    of the phenomenon. At last the light landed behind the nearby\n    forest. Now there was only luminous trails in the sky which were\n    visible till morning sunrise.\n\n    The same phenomenon was observed also by Jaakko Kokkonen in\n    Lappeenranta. At 00.26 UT he saw a luminous yellowish trail in\n    the low northeastern horizont. The altitude of the trail was\n    only about 3-4 degrees. Soon the trail began to grow taller.\n    A loop was appeared in the head of the trail. It was like a\n    spoon. This lasted only 10 seconds. Now the altitude was about\n    five degress above horizont. He noted a bright spot at the\n    upper stage of loop. The spot was at magnitude -2. The loop\n    became enlarged and the spot was now visible in the middle of\n    the loop. A cartwheel-shaped trail was appeared round the bright\n    spot. After a minute the spot disappeared and only fuzzy trails\n    were only visible in the low horizont. Luminous trails were still\n    visible at 01.45 UT in the morning sky.\n\n    The phenomenon was caused by a Russian rocket. I don't know if\n    there were satellite launches in Plesetsk Cosmodrome near\n    Arkhangelsk, but this may be a rocket experiment too. Since 1969\n    we have observed over 80 rocket phenomena in Finland. Most of\n    these are rocket experiments (military missile tests?), barium\n    experiments and other chemical releases. During these years we\n    have observed 17 satellite launches.\n\n    Leo Wikholm

I can't see the need for a single (big? expensive? heavy?) "mothership" except\nfor Voyager style flyby missions. A few years ago, I did some calculations on a\n"Grand Tour" space probe launched by a Saturn V in 1975-76. At the time,I felt \nthat\nthe idea of a big "mother ship" had some merit - the Voyagers had to be rather\nsmall, lightweight craft due to the limitations imposed by using weak Titan\nIII/Centaur launchers. The concept I examined (and Michael's?) had a lot in\ncommon with the British Interplanetary Society's Daedalus project for sending a\nprobe to Barnard's Star - i.e. a large "bus" spacecraft carrying several\nsmaller probes to be dispatched when the ship arrives at its destination.\nThe Saturn V supposedly would have been able to launch a 10-ton payload towards\nJupiter and beyond. The "bus" could have included far more powerful\ncameras/telescopes/scientific equipment and a heavier/more powerful power\nsource than the Voyagers as there would be no limitations on weight anymore.\nExtremely important as the Voyagers had to perform most of their measurements\nwithin a couple of weeks before and after planetary encounter, and usually at a\nrelatively great distance.\n---\nThe smaller probes carried aboard might have been based on the "real" Voyagers,\nand an even smaller version like the one scheduled for launch towards Pluto in\nthe early 21st century, and would have been released at various points during\nthe mission. The advantages are obvious: the bus would have carried out the\nsame basic Jupiter-Saturn-Uranus-Neptune mission than Voyager 2 did, but in\naddition two "sub-probes" could have been relased at Saturn, examining\nthat planet's south polar regions before moving on to Pluto. This would have\nenabled NASA to map both hemispheres of Pluto/Charon by 1986...and several\nother probes could have examined parts of the Jupiter/Saturn/Uranus/Neptune\nsystems that weren't examined in great detail by the Voyagers due to\ntrajectory-related factors. A small "swarm" of camera-equipped miniature space\nprobes released a month before encounter would have been too costly for a \nsmall Voyager-type mission but entirely feasible if launched from a heavy, \nwell-equipped spacecraft. And would we have learned a lot more about the outer\nplanets! The reason why the Grand Tour was cancelled was lack of money, of\ncourse. \n\nMARCU$

In Space Digest V16 #487,\n\n...about the protests over proposals to put a giant billboard into orbit,\n\n\n\nMr. Hathaway's post is right on the money, if a little lengthy.  In short,\nan orbiting billboard would be trash, in the same way that a billboard on\nthe Earth is trash.  Billboards make a place look trashy.  That is why there\nare laws in many places prohibiting their use.  The light pollution\ncomplaints are mainly an attempt to find some tangible reason to be against\norbiting billboards because people don't feel morally justified to complain\non the grounds that these things would defile the beauty of the sky.\n\nRegular orbiting spacecraft are not the same in this respect, since they are\nmore like abstract entities, but a billboard in space would be like a beer\ncan somebody had thrown on the side of the road: just trash.

I haven't seen any mention of this in a while, so here goes...\n\nWhen the Hubble Telescope was first deployed, one of its high gain antennas\nwas not able to be moved across its full range of motion.  It was suspected\nthat it had been snagged on a cable or something.  Operational procedures\nwere modified to work around the problem, and later problems have overshadowed\nthe HGA problem.\n\nIs there any plan to look at the affected HGA during the HST repair mission,\nto determine the cause of its limited range of motion?  Is the affected HGA\nstill limited, or is it now capable of full range of motion?
Climbers regard 8000 metres and up as "The Death Zone".  Even on 100% Oxygen,\nyou are slowly dying.  At 8848m (Everest), most climbers spend only a short\nperiod of time before descending.

Supernovae put out 10^53 or 10^54 (i forget which, but it's only an\norder of magnitude...).  Not in gamma rays, though.  You'd hafta get\nall of that into gammas if they were at 9 Mpc, but if a decent fraction\nof the SN output was in gammas it could reasonably be extragalactic \n(but closer than 9 Mpc).  I dunno SN theory so well, but I can't think\nof how to get many gammas out.  Maybe I should look it up.\n\nBig radio galaxies can put out 10^46 erg/s *continually*.  That's just\nin the radio... there are a lot of gammas around them, too, but "bursts"?\nNah.\n\nNeither of these should be taken as explanations... just trying to show\nthat those energies *are* produced by things we know about.

I'd guess this was a garbled report of the NERVA effort to develop a\nsolid-core fission rocket (the most mundane type of nuclear rocket).\nThat was the only advanced-propulsion project that was done on a large\nenough scale to be likely to attract news attention.  It *could* be any\nnumber of things -- the description given is awfully vague -- but I'd\nput a small bet on NERVA.
Obviously not.  Count rates are too low and signal rise times too long\nfor this to be possible.  The CGRO, is, what, 10 meters long?  You'd\nneed to time to an accuracy of nanoseconds to do this.\n\nWhat BATSE actually does is measure the relative strength in each of\nthe detectors (also as a function of photon energy).  Each of the\ndetectors does not have isotropic response.  To do this right one must\nmodel the scattering of photons in the material around each detector,\nand even scattering of photons off the Earth's atmosphere back onto\nthe spacecraft.  I believe they have now reduced the error to about 2\ndegrees.
Am I correct in assuming that the science instruments buffer their acquired\ndata in onboard RAM, which is then downloaded upon receipt of the MRO command?

Well, I'll avoid your question for now (got some learnin' to do) with a\npromise to come back with more info when I can find it.  I _do_ know that\nBATSE is the primary instrument in the development of the all-sky map of\nlong-term sources.  Given that fact, and the spacecraft attitude knowledge\nof approx. 2 arcmin, we might be able to figure out how well BATSE can\ndetermine the location (rotational) of a Gamma Ray burster from knowledge\nof the all-sky map's accuracy.  PR material for the other three instruments\ngive accuracies on the order of "fractions of a degree", if that's \nany help.\n\nSpeaking of GRO, the net-world probably was happy to see that the preps\nfor orbit adjust appear to be going well.  Our branch guy who's helping\nout says that things have gone smoothly with the iso-valve preps and the\nburns will take place in mid-June.\n\nAnyway, I'm off to find out more.  'Be back when I get some info.

Some of the innovative features of NeXTSTEP are\nbinary compatibility across platforms (eg you can just copy your program from\na Sparc to a PC and it would run, as opposed to buying the version of the package\nported to a PC), graphical object-oriented design (its all WSIWIG postscript), \nsupports parallel hetrogeneous processing, and best of all it is based around \nthe Mach micro-kernel so you can make it look like Unix with X, or DOS, or NT or \neven VMS if you feel the need. No package out there comes even close. I hope \npeople will subscribe to the HyperKnowledge project and NeXTSTEP finally\ntakes off in my lifetime :-)
Nowadays, usually with a computer. No theory predicted the numeric \ndiscoveries listed above. No one can yet write an algorithm that will\npredict the precise behavior of any of these at any precise level of\ntheir evolution.

According to my *Glossary of Astronomy and Astrophysics*:\n"parsec (abbreviation for parallax second) 	The distance at which\none astronomical unit subtends an angle of 1 second of arc.  1 pc =\n206,265 AU = 3.086 X 10^13 km = 3.26 lt-yr."\n\nGeorge
a yes,  but the improvement in  boost orbit to the HST is Significant,\nand  that means you can then carry EDO packs  and enough consumables\nso the SHuttle mission can go on long enough to also fix the\narray tilt motors,  and god knows what else  is going to wear out\non the HST in the next 9 months.
We can only say that they are beyond about 25 AU, due to the low\naccuracy of position determination by single detectors.\n\n\nIt may be a NEW Physics problem (i.e. a problem involving new\nphysics).  However, the data is not good enough to rule out the >100\nmodels which use old physics.  New physics is a big step, and is only\ntolerated when there is no alternative.  For example , the Dark Matter\nProblem (there's more to the universe than meets the eye) is a question\nof comparable mystery to GRBs, but we have much better data regarding\nit.  Theoreticians postulate new particles all the time to explain it,\nbut no one will actually believe that these particles are real until an\nexperimentalist (or several) detects them in the lab.
Yes, but that's because interstellar grains are very poor radiators, not\nremotely black bodies.  As a consequence they are a lot warmer than the\n"ambient".\n \n\nWhen I was in graduate school, a long time ago, we used 10,000 deg K with\na DILUTION FACTOR of 10+4 for representative values of the radiant energy\nbackground in the galaxy due to starlight.
That has sort of happened for real. Back in the 1920's travellers\nin the Sudan would find strange cigar shaped designs on native huts.\nWhen asked the locals would say it was a picture of the great omen\nthat appeared in the sky. This was LZ 53 a zepplin flying from Bulgaria\nto German East Africa with supplies in 1917 (and back since it was fooled\nby the British secret service.)
Habital planets are also dependent on what kind of plant life can be grown..\nand such.. Length of growing season (that is if you want something more than\nVAT food, argh, Id ratehr eat an MRE for  along period of time).\n\nI know in Fairbanks (Furbanks to some) the winter can get to -60 or so F, but\nin the summer can get to +90 and such.. I know of worse places..\n       \nIncans and Sherpa and other low pressure atmosphere and such are a limit in\nhuman adaptability(someone mentioend that Incan woman must come to lower\nelevations to have babies brought to term? true?)

I like this statement, though for my own reasons.  Cost comparisons depend\na lot on whether the two options are similar, and *then* it becomes very\nrevealing to consider what their differences are.  Can Soyuz launch the\nLong Exposure Facility?  Course not.  Will the Shuttle take my television \nrelay to LEO by year's end?  Almost certainly not, but the Russians are\npretty good about making space accessible on a tight schedule.\n\nComparing S and SS points up that there are TWO active space\nlauncher-and-work-platform resources, with similarities and differences.\nWhere they are in direct competition, we may get to see some market\neconomics come into play.\n\ntombaker
A young French skeptic, who reads (skeptically) the UFO review OVNI\nPresence (O.P.), sent me the following excerpt from an August 92\nissue of this review (R.G. = Robert Galley, French minister of\ndefense in 1974, answering about the Belgian UFO wave):\n\n"O.P. : Can you conceive that the U.S. could allow themselves to send\n their most modern crafts over foreign territory, with the Belgian\n hierarchy ignoring that ?"\n"R.G. : Absolutely ! The best proof which I can give is that, some time\n ago, without informing the French authorities, the U.S. based in\n Germany sent a plane to make photos of Pierrelatte (*). We followed\n this plane, and, after its landing on the Ramstein airport, Colonel X\n got back the shots of Pierrelatte. The U.S. had not informed us..."\n(*) There is an important military plant of enrichment of uranium at\nPierrelatte (Drome).\n\nWhat kind of plane could it be ? Surely not an SR-71, which our planes\ncould not follow (and still can't)...
[discussion of pros and cons deleted]\n\n\nCould someone give me the references to the LLNL proposal?  I've been meaning\nto track it down in conjuntion with something I'm working on.  It's not \ndirectly related to space stations, but I think many of the principles will \ncarry over.
I know that alot of how people think and act in a long distance space project\nwould be much like old tiem explorers, sailors, hunters and such who spent alot\nof time alone, isolated, and alone or in minimal surroundings and sopcial\ncontacts..

That may change next month; at least I hope it will. A couple of hundred\njournalists have requested press passes for the test flights. Sustaining\nthat publicity however, will be a problem. \n\n  Allen
The people involved in it have been building hardware rather than writing\npress releases.  This is not a high-manpower project; they don't *have*\nspare people sitting around.\n\nAs I understand it, there has also been some feeling on the part of some\nof the project management that publicity was not a good idea.  A lot of\npeople have been working on changing this view, with some success.
Doing this in anything like reasonable time would require more\npropulsion capability than we can manage.  You would have to boost to\nPluto and then slow back down.  You could do something like a Hohman\norbit, but I think that would take ridiculous amounts of time (my\nRubber Bible is at home).\n\n-- \n"Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live\n in the real world."   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden
Sorry to split hairs, but I just read in "The making of the atomic\nbomb"(*) that teflon was developed during world war 2.  A sealant was\nneeded for the tubing in which uranium hexafluoride passed as it was\ngradually enriched by difussion.  UF6 is very corrosive, and some very\ninert yet flexible material was needed for the seals.\n\n\nAlejo Hausner (hausner@qucis.queensu.ca)

Ron Miller is a space artist with a long and distinguished career.  \nI've admired both his paintings (remember the USPS Solar System\nExploration Stamps last year?) and his writings on the history of\nspaceflight.  For several years he's been working on a *big* project\nwhich is almost ready to hit the streets.

Clarke\n\nKrieger Publishing Company\nMelbourne, Florida, USA\nOrig. Ed. 1993\nPre-publication $84.50\nISBN 0-89464-039-9\n\n\nThis text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a\ntechnological phenomenon.  The idea of a vehicle for traversing the\nspace betwen worlds did not spring full-blown into existence in the\ntlatter half of theis century.  The need preceded the ability ot make\nsuch a device by several hundred years.  As soon as it was realized\nthat there were other worlds than this one, human beings wanted to\nreach them.   \n\nTracing the history of the many imaginative, and often prescient,\nattempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of\ntechnology, science, astronomy, and engineering.  Once space travel\nbecame feasible, there were many more spacecraft concepts developed\nthan ever got off the drawing board-- or off the ground, for that\nmatter.  These also are described in theis book, for the same reason\nas the pre-space-age and pre-flight ideas are:  they are all accurate\nreflections of their particular era's dreams, abilities, and\nknowledge.  Virtually every spaceship concept invented since 1500, as\nwell as selected events important in developing the idea of\nextraterrestrial travel, is listed chronologically.  The chronological\nentries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and\nspeculative ventures.  They also allow comparisons between\nsimultaneous events taking place in different countries.  They reveal\nconnections, influences, and evolutions hitherto unsuspected.  Every\nentry is accompanied by at least one illustration.  Nearly every\nspacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing.  This\nallows accurate comparisons to be made between designss, to visualize\ndifferences, similarities, and influences.\n\nThis text will be of interest to students of astronautical history,\nand also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic\ndiagrams.   Science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and\nhistorians of science will also find this book to be fascinating.  The\nunique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and\nvery interesting history of the spaceship.\n\nSPECIAL FEATURES\n\nIncludes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft, both real and\nfictional\n\nContains scores of illustrations: artwork, drawings, and photos\ncontemporary with the subject.  This includes extremely rare\nillustrations from scarce books and novels, exclusive photos and\ndrawings fromSoviet spacecraft; rare stills from both famous and\nobscure science fiction films, and unpublished photographs from NASA\narchives\n\nAn index, bibliography, and appendices are included.\n\nCONTENTS\n\nPart I  The Archaeology of the Spaceship (360 B.C. to 1783 A.D.)\nPart II The invention of the Spaceship (1784-1899)\nPart III The Experimenters (1900-1938)\nPart IV The World War (1939-1945)\nPart V  The Golden Age of the Spaceship (1946-1960)\nPart VI The Dawn of the Space Age (1961 to the present)\n\nABOUT RON MILLER\n\n[The brochure has a page of stuff here; I'll try to hit the high\nspots.]\n\nFormer art director for Albert Einstein Planetarium  at Smithsonian's\nNational Air and Space Museum\n\nMember of International Association for Astronomical Arts, member of\nInternational Astronautical Association, Fellow of the British\nInterplanetary Society,  consulting editor for *Air & Space\nSmithsonian* magazine\n\nAuthor, co-author, editor, or sole illustrator on many books since\n1979, including *Space Art*, *Cycles of Fire*, *The Grand Tour*, and\nmany others, as well as many articles and papers\n\nBook jackets and interior art for over a dozen publishers \n\nContributor to IBM traveling exhibition and book *Blueprint for Space*\n\nProduction illustrator for movies *Dune* and *Total Recall*\n\nDesigner of ten-stamp set of commemorative space postage stamps for\nU.S. Postal Service in 1991 (Solar System Exploration)\n\nORDERING INFORMATION\n\nPre-publication price $84.50 before 1 May 1993\nAfterwards, price will be $112.50\n\nKrieger Publishing Company\nPO Box 9542\nMelbourne, FL 32902-9542\nUSA\nDirect order line (407)727-7270\nFax (407)951-3671\n\nAdd $5.00 for shipping by UPS within USA for first book, $1.50 for each\nadditional book.  \n\nFor foreign orders, add $6.00 for first book, $2.00 for each\nadditional.

Much of Cook's later exploration was privately funded, by Joseph Banks\namong others (eg in Resolution & the earlier Endeavour).  Colnett's voyage\nto the Galapagos was substantially privately funded by the owners of\nBritish whaling vessels.  Chancellor and Willoughby were privately funded\nby London merchant companies in their voyages to Muscovy.  The list is\nalmost endless.  Those doing the funding were about eighty percent\nmotivated by potential profit, ten percent by potential glory and ten\npercent by the desire to advance the sum of human knowledge.
at least be honest.  velcro (tm) dates from the 40's.  i have doubts\nabout everything listed above.  just because it was developed in the\nspace age, doesn't mean it was a space spin-off.
Ken:\n\nYour arguments are thoughtful but you are going up against the Big\nBoys if you're tackling Henry.  Allen Sherzer will doubtless chime in\non the subject of staggering operational costs, too.  Good luck, son.\n\n\nAhem.  The Russians are in the Free World now, or at least it would be\nPolitically Correct to contend so.\n\n\nIt will be tough to make DC-X succeed, and to turn it into an\noperational orbital vehicle.  Doubtless it will fail to meet some of\nthe promised goals.  The reason people are so fond of it is that it's\nthe *only* chance we have now, or will have for a *long* time to come,\nto develop a launch vehicle with radically lower costs.  \n\nThere is no Shuttle successor in funded development, NASP is dwindling\naway, and ALS/NLS/Spacelifter sure as hell aren't gonna knock any\nzeroes off that $2000-$3000 per pound cost.   Part of the blame for\nthis must be placed on a Shuttle program that consumes many annual\nbillions of the, er, Free World's available space cash.  As you will\nno doubt hear from many correspondents in the days to come. (-:\n\nDC-X is an attempt to break out of the vicious cycle by keeping\ndevelopment costs low and flying incremental "X-plane" hardware.\nIt's been, to my mind, incredibly successful already-- they've built a\ncomplex prototype in under 600 days for under 60 megabucks.  I would\nhave been extremely skeptical that this could be accomplished in 1990s\nAmerica, never mind flying the thing, getting a successor funded, or\nbuilding the DC-Y.\n\nI'm sure you know well that launch costs are THE basic problem for any\nexpansion of astronautics.  I don't see a realistic  prospect for\nbeating down those costs, for multi-ton payloads, anywhere else.  If\nthe DC flops, it'll be business as usual in space.  The Nineties and\nthe Double-Oughts will look just like the Seventies and Eighties, a\nprospect too depressing to bear.\n\n(Pegasus represents another assault on the problem from a different\ndirection.  It doesn't lower cost-per-pound but it offers an orbital\nlaunch for under ten megabucks.  It's creating its own market for\nsmall payloads.)\n\nI read the magazines and I've attended the last two IAFs. There are\nplenty of engineers with paper ideas for cheaper launch systems, some\nof them as good as or better than SSTO.  There is no sign in today's\nworld that any of these designs will be allowed anywhere near an\nassembly line.\n\n[...deleting some things I'm not going to prove tonight...]\n\nStrawman.  Is anybody seriously proposing this?  References, please. \nThe DC must be developed in the real-world funding climate, which\nincludes a NASA ferociously committed to continuing Shuttle\noperations, as well as the "bird in the hand" argument your common\nsense tells you.   If DC-Y flies at all, it flies alongside the\nShuttle, not instead of it.\n\nAlso, of course, DC-Y and its operational descendants will be useful\nfor a wide variety of jobs even if they are *not* man-rated.\n\n\nIf a DC-X successor can fly a 10,000-kg payload for $1M, or even $5M,\nrather than the $40M it now costs, more people will be able to afford\nmore payloads... for the same money, you can fly several satellites\ninstead of one.  Big outfits can fly multi-satellite series.  Little\noutfits will be able to fly spacecraft of their own, instead of\nbegging a ride.  This is just supply and demand.  You should be able\nto convince *yourself* that point 4 will be true, assuming DC makes a\nbig difference in costs.  Do you have some reason to think not?
As Herny pointed out, you have to develop the thruster.\nAlso, while much lighter, you still have to lift the mass of\nthe thruster to orbit, and then the thruster lifts its own \nweight into a higher orbit.  And you take up room in the payload\nbay.
I think you're both right.  Teflon was actually discovered by accident\nbefore WWII.  From what I've heard, they had some chemical (I assume it\nwas tetrafluoroethylene) in a tank and but the valve got gummed up.\nCutting it open revealed that it had polymerized.\n\nThe material was useful for seals, but it had a major problem for, say\nthe linings of vessels: it wouldn't stick to metal.  What the space\nprogram did was to find a way to get it to stick.  Thus we had no-stick\nfrypans on the market in the late '60s.
My information shows that the last San Marco launch was 1988.  There seem to \nhave been a total of seven before that.  I seem to recall that someone, either\nASI or the University of Rome (?) includes money in their annual budget for\nmaintainance of the platforms (there are actually two).\n\nThe Italians have been spending money to develop an advanced Scout.  However,\nrecent events in the Italian space program, and the Italian government overall\nmake me skeptical that this will get off the ground in the near future.
Well, no, during the original deployment mission the HST aperture door was\nnot opened until after the Shuttle had landed.  \n\nI presume that during a re-boost mission HST would be berthed in the orbiter\nwith the orbiter bay doors shut; but still there would be lots of contamination\nworries.  I understand that the EVA suits are one of the hardest things to \nkeep clean.\n\nBut I still don't know where the idea is coming from that HST _NEEDS_ a\nre-boost.  We have many problems but our orbit is the least of them.  There\nis certainly no plan to change the orbit in the first servicing mission in\nDecember.
A harmonic of the Earth's gravitational field?  What IS a harmonic of the\nEarth's gravitational field?\n\n\n14:1 resonance with WHAT?  It's not like there's any wavelength or frequency\nto the Earth's gravitational field.  Now, there' might be some interesting\ninteractions with the Moon's tidal effect--is that what you're talking about?\n\nWhat are the physics of the situation?  The only way I can see gravitational\neffects being useful in adding energy to an object orbiting Earth is some\nsort of interaction with the moon.
From the description I've read, it's prob. only going to be\nas bright as Jupiter. Anything else is probably hype from the\nopponents or wishful thinking from the sponsors.\n\nIf we could do something as bright as the full moon that soon,\nthat cheap, the CIS would have done it already.
"Let's make a deal!"  If you're going to put up a billion, I'd want to budget\nthe whole sheebang for $450-600 million.  If I have that much money to throw\naround in the first place, you betcha I'm going to sign a contract committing\nto volume production...
There would be some point to doing long-term monitoring of things like\nparticles and fields, not to mention atmospheric phenomena.  However,\nthere is no particular plan to establish any sort of monitoring network.\nTo be precise, there is no particular plan, period.  This is a large\npart of the problem.  In this context, it's not surprising that unexciting\nbut useful missions like this get short shrift at budget time.  The closest\napproach to any sort of long-term planetary monitoring mission is the\noccasional chance to piggyback something like this on top of a flashier\nmission like Galileo or Cassini.\n\n\nIt is most unlikely that there is much happening on Pluto that would be\nworth monitoring, and it is a prohibitively difficult mission to fly\nwithout new propulsion technology (something the planetary community\nhas firmly resisted being the guinea pigs for).  The combined need to\narrive at Pluto within a reasonable amount of time, and then kill nearly\nall of the cruise velocity to settle into an orbit, is beyond what can\nreasonably be done with current (that is, 1950s-vintage) propulsion.\n\n\nMost of this can be done just about as well from Earth.  The few things\nthat can't be, can be done better from a Voyager-like spacecraft that is\n*not* constrained by the need to enter orbit around a planet.
Uh, no. These burst detectors are just that, burst detectors.\nThey have no angular resolution.\n\nNow a network of burst detectors could have angular resolution,\nbut we do not have a decent set of different networks at the distances\nneccesary from each other to determine if they're happening in the oort\ncloud or not.\n\nWe have one network, and trying to make two networks out of it\ndegrades what angular resolution we have.
Is it not also an abomination that somebody would spend money on "space \nadvertising" when those children are starving? Perhaps some redistribution\nof wealth would help them ...
("like most good ideas,..." please, people!)\n\n\n_Five Weeks in a Balloon_. Not a good idea unless you have helium.\nVerne's protagonists didn't. They just got increadibly lucky.\n\nAnd yes, I knew the title of the movie too, just didn't want to start\ntalking about it. Except to bring up the image of a team of S. African\nBushmen showing up at a launch site with spears and flint knives\nto stop the launch (anyone want to bet on their success in doing so?\nespecially since they could probably stop a shuttle launch by sneezing\ntoo hard within a couple miles of the launch site).
big Capacitor :-)   Real Big  capacitor.
I don't think a reboost exercise is analogous to a shuttle landing/launch\nin terms of stresses/misalignments/etc.  I would think of the reboost as\na gentile push, where a landing, then launch as two JOLTS which would\nput more mechanical stress on the instruments.  Additionally, there might\nbe a concern about landing loads to the shuttle in the event of a laden\nlanding.  Finally, probably some thought went into possible contamination \nproblems if the instruments came back to earth.\n\nOf course, the cost of two shuttle launches _is_ a good reason to avoid\nsomething that might be done in one shuttle launch.  Here's hoping\nCepi's gang gets the job done right the first time.
Introducing the Back to the Moon in Congress:\n                          The Next Step\n                          \n        The next key hurdle for the Lunar Resources Data Purchase \nAct is introduction of the Act in Congress. At this point,  many\ncongresspersons have been approached about the bill. However,\nfor a successful effort to pass the bill, we need the best\npossible congressperson to introduce the bill. Due to his\nposition as Chair of the House Committee on Space and Science,\nCongressman George Brown is the logical choice. He has a long\nrecord of support and interest in space development, and helped\npass the Launch Services Purchase Act and the Space Settlements\nAct.                      \n        There is a small group of activists in southern California \nwho have assisted George Brown in his recent re-election campaigns.\nWe are mobilizing this group to have them tell Congressman Brown\nabout the Back to the Moon bill. We are also asking pro-space\nconstituents to let him know that they care about getting\nAmerica back to the Moon.\n        Finally, there is a good chance that a nationwide alert \nfor space activists to call or write George Brown to have him\nintroduce the Back to the Moon bill may be staged during late\nspring, 1993.\n        All this should produce a positive reaction from Brown's\noffice. As more is known, it will be passed on.\n        However, even if we are successful in getting him to support\nthe bill,  this alone will not ensure passage of the bill. For\nany bill to become law, one of three conditions must exist:\neither the bill must reflect widespread national support for an\nissue (such as extension of unemployment insurance benefits); be\npropelled by high-priced lobbyists (we're out of luck there); or\nhave widespread support within Congress, due to small, but\nwidespread, constituent support. The latter is the path that we,\nby necessity, must choose.                    \n        This means that the introduction of the Lunar Resources \nData Purchase Act must be immediately accompanied by a large number\nof congresspersons' sponsorship of the bill.  To accomplish\nthis, we need activists to ask their congressperson to support\nthe Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act - now. To wait until the\nbill is introduced is simply too late - it takes time to have a\ncongressperson's staff review a bill.\n        If your congressperson mentions that the bill is not yet\nintroduced, please elicit their opinion of the bill as currently\nwritten. We appreciate all comments on the bill from activists\nand politicians.\n        If you have yet to see the Back to the Moon bill, please\nrequest a copy by Email (please include your U.S. postal service\naddress), or contact your local chapter of the National Space\nSociety).
I'm wondering if "vandalize" is the proper word to use in this situation.  My\ndictionary defines "vandalism" as "the willful or malicious destructuion of \npublic or private property, especially of anything beautiful or artisitc." I\nwould agree the sky is beautiful, but not that it is public or private property.\n\nI personally prefer natural skies, far from city lights and sans aircraft.  \nHowever, there is also something to be said for being able to look up into the\nsky and see a satellite.  Many people get a real kick out of it, especially if\nthey haven't seen one before.
It's a moot point: Step out of your door go _anywhere_ (except possibly\nyour mailbox). You will be "subject to some ad agency's 'poor taste'"\n \n\nWhile I'm sure Sagan considers it sacrilegious, that wouldn't be\nbecause of his doubtfull credibility as an astronomer. Modern, \nground-based, visible light astronomy (what these proposed\norbiting billboards would upset) is already a dying field: The\nopacity and distortions caused by the atmosphere itself have\ndriven most of the field to use radio, far infrared or space-based\ntelescopes. In any case, a bright point of light passing through\nthe field doesn't ruin observations. If that were the case, the\nthousands of existing satellites would have already done so (satelliets\nmight not seem so bright to the eyes, but as far as astronomy is concerned,\nthey are extremely bright.)
This definitely had nothing to do with the entry of the government into\nthe support of science; some of it is relevant in technology.  There\nwas little involvement of federal funds, or except through support of\nstate universities, of state funds, for scientific research before WWII.\nThe US research position had been growing steadily, and the funding was\nmainly from university and private foundation funds.  There were not that\nmany research universities, but they all provided their researchers with\nlow teaching loads, laboratories, assistants, and equipment, and funds for\ntravel to scientific meetings.  Not that much, but it was provided, and a\nuniversity wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as well\nas salary.\n\nDuring WWII, the military and the defense departments found that pure\nscientists could do quite well with their problems, even though they \nwere not exactly in the areas of the scientists' expertise.  This is\nprobably because of the "research mind" approach, which is not to try\nto find a solution, but to understand the problem and see if a solution\nemerges.  This works in stages, and as research scientists were used to\ndiscussion about their problems, the job got done.\n\nThe military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for the\nfuture, and started funding pure research after WWII.  But Congress was\nunwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into the\nfuture supply of scientists, and set up other organizations, such as \nNSF, to do the job.  It also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly\nkeep politics out.  Also, the government did a job on private foundations,\nmaking it more difficult for them to act to support research.\n\nThe worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in which\nthe government supports research the university will not provide funding,\nand in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money.  Suppose,\nas has been the case, I have a project which could use the assistance of\na graduate student for a few months.  What do you think happens if I ask\nfor one?  The answer I will get is, "Get the money from NSF."  Now the\nmoney at the university level is a few thousand, but at the NSF level it\ncomes to about 20 thousand, and is likely to keep a faculty member from\ngetting supported.  So the government is, in effect, deciding which projects\nget supported, and how much.  \n\nAlso, the government decided that the "wealth" should be spread.  So instead\nof having a moderate number of universities which were primarily research\ninstitutions, the idea that more schools should get into the act came into\nbeing.  And instead of evaluating scholars, they had to go to evaluating\nreseach proposals.  As a researcher, I can tell you that any research proposal\nhas to be mainly wishful thinking, or as now happens, the investigator conceals\nalready done work to release it as the results of the research.  What I am\nproposing today I may solve before the funding is granted, I may find \nimpossible, or I may find that it is too difficult.  In addition, tomorrow\nI may get unexpected research results.  Possibly I may bet a bright idea\nwhich solves yesterday's too difficult problem, or a whole new approach to\nsomething I had not considered can develop.  This is the nature of the beast, \nand except for really vague statements, if something can be predicted, it\nis not major research, but development or routine activity not requiring \nmore than minimal attention of a good researcher.  \n\nI believe that at this time less quality research is being done than would\nhave happened if the government had never gotten into it, and the government\nis trying to divert researchers from thinkers to plodders.
This was all badly reported in the news.  There is no evidence that\nsigns of life found in old rock predate putative planet-sterilizing\nevents.  Rather, the argument was that if life arose shortly the last\nsterilizing event, then it must be easily formed.  The *inference*\nwas that life originated before and was destroyed, but there was\nno evidence of that.\n\nHowever, even this argument is flawed.  It could well be that origin of\nlife requires specific conditions (say, a certain composition of the\natmosphere) that do not last for long.  So, perhaps life formed\nearly only because it would have had no other chance to do so,\nnot because it was likely that life would originate under those\nconditions.
Forwarded from Neal Ausman, Galileo Mission Director\n\n                                 GALILEO\n                     MISSION DIRECTOR STATUS REPORT\n                               POST-LAUNCH\n                           April 23 - 29, 1993\n\nSPACECRAFT\n\n1.  On April 22 and 23, delta Differenced One-way Range (DOR) passes were\nperformed over DSS-14/63 (Goldstone/Madrid 70 meter antennas) and DSS-14/43\n(Goldstone/Canberra 70 meter antennas), respectively.  Initial results \nindicate the delta DOR pass on April 22 was unsuccessful due to ground\nstation hardware problems but the one on April 23 was successfully performed.\n\n2.  On April 23, a cruise science Memory Readout (MRO) was performed for the\nMagnetometer (MAG) instrument.  Analysis indicates the data was received\nproperly.\n\n3.  On April 23, the spare power relay contacts were commanded closed via the\nspacecraft stored sequence.  These relays were commanded closed by the CDS\n(Command Data Subsystem) prior to launch and were again commanded closed to\npreclude the possibility at Jupiter of the PPS relays/wiring being a\nsource of internal electrostatic charge (IESD).\n\n4.  On April 26, cruise science Memory Readouts (MRO) were performed for the\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer\n(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\nproperly.\n\n5.  During the period from April 26 to April 27, a navigation cycle was\nperformed.  This navigation cycle provided near-continuous acquisition of\ntwo-way doppler and ranging data during three consecutive passes of the\nspacecraft over DSS-63, DSS-14, and DSS-43.\n\n6.  On April 26, real-time commands were sent to test slew the Radio Relay\nAntenna (RRA) in preparation for the mini-sequence slew test on April 28.\nThe RRA was slewed from approximately 3.5 degrees from stow to approximately\n20.3 degrees.  Preliminary analysis indicated the antenna slewed to about 18\ndegrees which was well within the predicted range.  The RRA was commanded back\nto approximately 15.2 degrees from stow.  Preliminary analysis indicated the\nantenna reached about 15.8 degrees also well within the predicted range.  The\nRRA motor temperature was at 1 degree C at the start of the activity and had\nincreased to 1.6 degrees C at its completion.\n\n     After verifying proper RRA slewing, the RRA slew test mini-sequence was\nuplinked to the spacecraft for execution on April 28.  Upon successful uplink,\na Delayed Action Command (DAC) was sent which will reposition the stator on\nMay 4 to its initial pre-test position.  Also, a DAC was sent to turn the\nTwo-Way Noncoherent (TWNC) on April 28 prior to the start of the RRA slew test\nmini-sequence.\n\n7.  On April 27, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to\n264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\n\n8.  On April 28, the RRA slew test executed nominally.  The spacecraft under\nstored sequence control performed six RRA slews starting at about 16 degrees\nfrom stow and going to 53 degrees, back to 25 degrees, then to 51 degrees,\nback to 22 degrees, then to 48 degrees and then back to 21 degrees.  All of\nthe slews were well within the predicted range.  The RRA motor temperature was\nat 2.3 degrees C at the start of the activity and had increased to 4.4\ndegrees C at its completion.  After completion of the RRA slews, real-time\ncommands were sent to reconfigure back to the pre-test configuration.\n\n9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant change\n(greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads 17 DN\n(3.9 volts).  The DC measurement reads 134 DN (15.7 volts).  These\nmeasurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special\nanomaly team.\n\n10. The Spacecraft status as of April 29, 1993, is as follows:\n\n       a)  System Power Margin -  75 watts\n       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin\n       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner\n       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 23 degrees\n           off-sun (lagging) and 4 degrees off-earth (leading)\n       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1\n       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within\n           acceptable range\n       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range\n       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,\n           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS\n       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within\n           acceptable range\n       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours\n           Time To Initiation - 203 hours\n\n\nGDS (Ground Data Systems):\n\n1.  The first Galileo-GDS test of the MGDS V18.0 Command System (CMD) took\nplace April 27, 1993 with DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna).  The test went\nwell and demonstrated that the new command system interfaced with the new DSN\n(Deep Space Network) Group 5 Command Processor Assembly (CPA).  The test was\nsuccessful and the next test for V18.0 CMD is scheduled for May 1, 1993 with\nDSS-15 (Goldstone 34 meter antenna).\n\n2.  The April System Engineers Monthly Report(SEMR)/Ground System Development\nOffice (GSDO) MMR was conducted Thursday, April 29.   A review of current\nProject and Institutional (DSN and MOSO) system status was conducted.  On-going\ncruise development plus the GSDO Phase 1 and 2 delivery schedules, past months\naccomplishments  and potential problem areas were discussed.  No significant\nschedule changes or significant problems were reported.\n\n\nTRAJECTORY\n\n     As of noon Thursday, April 29, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory\nstatus was as follows:\n\n	Distance from Earth         187,745,300 km (1.26 AU)\n	Distance from Sun           296,335,800 km (1.98 AU)\n	Heliocentric Speed          89,100 km per hour\n	Distance from Jupiter       522,015,800 km\n	Round Trip Light Time       20 minutes, 58 seconds\n\nSPECIAL TOPIC
Why not design the solar arrays to be detachable.  if the shuttle is going\nto retunr the HST,  what bother are some arrays.  just fit them with a quick release.\n\none  space walk,  or use the second canadarm to remove the arrays.
Indeed, the sky doesn't look much like a black body if you look carefully\nenough; in particular, its temperature at radio frequencies is quite a\nbit higher than you would see from a black body.  Morgan&Gordon's fat\n"Communications Satellite Handbook" has a graph of sky temperature vs.\nwavelength, in fact, for communications design.\n\nHowever, in terms of energy content, the RF frequencies are negligible.\nFor thermal purposes, at very large distances from the Sun the sky\nlooks like a black body at 3.5K (Allen, "Astrophysical Quantities").\nI haven't found a number for non-large distances, since solar radiation\ntends to be something you can't just ignore :-), but M&G says "about 4K"\nin a brief discussion of why solar radiation dominates the problem.
Well, there are several bursts in species diversity I can think of.\nThe Cambrian and Ordovician explosions resulted in a vast increase\nin animal diversity. Likewise, after the one-two punch of the\nPermian and Triassic extinctions, the number of marine animals\nrose steadily (**) to an all-time high (*) just prior to the spread \nof humans.\n\n(**) biggest exception being the K/T (bye bye dinos) extinction\n\n(*) about 800 families\n\nAlso, plants arose from green algae and colonized the land in\nsuccesive sweeps. Mosses colonized very wet environments first,\nferns (who had evolved vascular tissues) took over more territory\nwhen they evolved (1). These were eventually (mostly) replaced by gymnosperms\n(pines and the like) (2) and then (mostly) displaced by angiosperms (flowering\nplants -- now the dominant plant group on the planet(3). Fungi\nalso radiated greatly with the invasion of the land. \n\n(1) around the carboniferous (up to about 200 families)\n(2) around the triassic (up to maybe 250 families)\n(3) starting in the cretaceous (rising to about 600 families currently)\n\nIt's unclear (to me at least) what the max equilibrium number\nof species the earth can hold (***) and if it has ever hit this\nin the past. It could be (warning: speculation alert) that\ndiversity has never reached a peak because mass extinctions\nhappen often enough to keep the total number down.\n\n(***) This would depend a great deal on how fragmented\nspecific ecosystems were. \n\nSee Cowen's book "History of Life" for a not-too-technical\nrun-down on, well, like the title sez, the history of life.\nOr see, Wilson's "Diversity of Life" for a view centered more\non current ecology -- this is (IMHO) the best popular biology\nbook of (what the hell, I'll say it) all time. \n\n\nFollow-ups to t.o.
...\nI believe that my former employer Hughes Aircraft Company has a working Ion \nPropulsion system for satellites.
I just wanted to point out, that Teflon wasn't from the space program.\nIt was from the WWII nuclear weapons development program.  Pipes in the \nsystem for fractioning and enriching uranium had to be lined with it.\n\nUranium Hexafloride was the chemical they turned the pitchblend into for\nenrichment.  It is massively corrosive.  Even to Stainless steels. Hence\nthe need for a very inert substaance to line the pipes with.  Teflon has\nall its molecular sockets bound up already, so it is very unreactive.\n\nMy 2 sense worth.
I can't speak to sheer mass, but part of the problem is that HST\nwasn't built to ever be brought back down.  It's not built for those\nkinds of 'jolt' forces and there is no support cradle for it (which is\nadditional weight that would be required.\n\n-- \n"Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live\n in the real world."   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden
:>... Also, as implied by other posters, why \n:>do you need to boost the orbit on this mission anyway? ...\n:You don't *need* to, but it's desirable.  HST, like all satellites in\n:low Earth orbit, is gradually losing altitude due to air drag.  It was\n:deployed in the highest orbit the shuttle could reach, for that reason.\n:It needs occasional reboosting or it will eventually reenter.  (It has\n:no propulsion system of its own.)\n\nHas any thought been given as to how they are going to boost the HST yet?\nGive it a push?  I can see the push start cartoons now :-).
Correction, and some more info: The Kaliningrad that Mr. Larrison\nwrites about is indeed near Moscow. I've read that it may also be known by\nthe name Podlipk, and is a short distance from Zvezdny Gorodok (Star \nCity) and the Cosmonaut Training Center there. I read that the Tsniimach\n(Central Scientific Research Institute of Machine Building, est. 1961) \nEnterprise was also responsible for creating the NKIK (Ground Command and \nMeasurement Complex) including the Kaliningrad Flight Control Center\nwhich has controlled all Soviet/Russian manned spaceflights since its\ncompletion in 1973. However, it appears to have been a part of the \nMinistry of General Machine Building which was not part of the military\n(Ministry of Defense) but would have been a part of the military-industrial\ncomplex.

(in answer to Amruth Laxman\n\n\nApart from the fact that you get G in the pull-out, not the dive, that\nfigure is about right for sustained G, no protection.\nThe duration of G, it's rate of onset, body position and support aids are\nall critical parts of the equation. I remember one note about instrumented\ngridiron players recording peaks about 200G. Stapp, the aviation doctor,\neither by accident or design, took a short-period 80G in a rocket-sled\ndecelleration, eye-balls-out against a standard (1950's) harness. It had\nto be short, calculate the stopping time, even from 500 - 600mph at that\nG. A bang-seat can get up to about 60 G, and you'd better be sitting\nstraight. Find the book by Martin-Bakers human guinea pig to hear how bad\nit can get if the rate of onset is too high. A reclining position and a\ngood G-suit can keep a pilot functioning at around 12G.\n\nA flotation tank should be a good bet, since you can treat the body as a\nfluid, and high-pressure situations are not new. Anyone have any figures?
: Mike Adams suggested discussions on long-term effects of spaceflight\n: to the human being.  I love this topic, as some of you regulars know.\n\n: So, having seen Henry's encouraging statement about starting to talk\n: about it; I shall.\n\n: I feel that we as a community of people have unique resources\n: to deliver to the world a comprehensive book which can elaborate\n: on the utility of spaceflight to fields which are as divergent \n: as medical intensive care, agriculture, environmental protection, and \n: probably more.  I do not believe that the general public understands\n: the impact of spaceflight on the whole of society.  In the absence\n: of such knowledge, we see dwindling support of the world's space effort.\n\nJust a few contributions from the space program to "regular" society:\n\n1.	Calculators\n2.	Teflon (So your eggs don't stick in the pan)\n3.	Pacemakers (Kept my grandfather alive from 1976 until 1988)\n\n\np.s.  To all the regular contributors to sci.space.news and\nsci.space.shuttle, thanks for all your hard work keeping us informed\nas to the doings down in NASA and other space-type agencies.  I don't\nhave much time to read USENET, but I ALWAYS read these two groups....
Heck, some of his ships were loaners. One was owned by a Basque...\n(you know, one of those groups that probably crossed the Atlantic\n_before_ Columbus came along).
Ok, so you have proven you saw the right stuff.  However, as I said above,\nit takes politics and PR to keep the bucks coming.\n"No politics, no bucks, no buck rogers."\n \n\nYes this may be true in the case of the SCIENCE data coming from the spacecraft\nand other stuff about the operations.  However, there is still stuff regarding\nregular operation that belongs to the company and they have ever legal right\nto keeping it theirs.  But this does not mean that everything can or\nshould be swept under the umbrella of company proprietory data.\n \n\nYou can do the same here...you just have to wait a year.\n \n\nSafeguard internal company data are indeed supported by US law.
This is a whole different situation.  If aliens were able to get here prior\nto us being able to get there, one might conclude that they would be more advanced\nand therefore "more intelegent" that we are.  However if we get somewhere where there\nis life, chances are we wont be able to communicate with them.  So we will have\nno clue as to weather they are "intelegent" or not.\n\n\nThat's a good point, I hadn't thought of it that way.  My question however was\nmore along the lines of... Every year the US spends millions of tax dollars\nand giving tax breaks to individuals and companies who feed the poor of foreign\ncountries while thousands of our own people sleep on the streets at night.\nWould we give to the economicly dissadvantaged on another planet if we hadn't resolved\nthese issues on our own?\n\n\nBut... Your comment brings up another good question.  Over the years we have decided\nthat certain cultures need improvements.  The native americans is a good example.  Prior\nto our attempt to civilize them, the native american culture had very little crime, no\nhomelessnes, no poverty.  Then the europeans came along and now they have those and\nmore.  If we encounter life elsewhere, do we tell them they have to live in houses, farm\nthe land and go to church on sunday?\n-- \nHave a day,
an image of the moon has been caught in a weather satellite images of the earth.\nit appears in both the 0430-1500UT ir and visual images of the earth.\nthe GIF images can be down loaded from vmd.cso.uiuc.edu and are named\nCI043015.GIF and CV043015.GIF for the IR and visual images respectively.\n\npretty cool pictures;  in the ir it's saturated but in the visual image\ndetails on the moon are viewable.\n\nthe moon is not in the 1400UT images.
Batse alone isn't always used to determine position.  WHen a\nparticularly bright burst occurs, There are a couple of other detectors that\ncatch it going off.  Pioneer 10 or 11 is the one I'm getting at here.  This\npuppy is far enough away, that if a bright burst happens nearby, the huge\nannulus created by it will hopefully intersect the line or general circle given\nby BATSE, and we can get a moderately accurate position. Say oh, 2 or 3\ndegrees. That is the closest anyone has ever gotten with it.  \n        Actually, my advisor, another classmate of mine, and me were talking\nthe other day about putting just one detector on one of the Pluto satellites. \nTHen we realized that the satellite alone is only carrying something like 200\npounds of eq.  Well, a BATSE detector needs lead shielding to protect it, and 1\nalone weighs about 200 pounds itself.
There is an office on the middle left US coast on Middlefield Road in\nMenlo Park, CA (415) 329-4390
But I believe that there is a fundamental difference here.  The other x\nthree instruments are focusing instruments, that, more or less, form\nan image, so positional errors are limited by craft attitude and the \nresolving power of the optics.  BATSE is an altogether different\nbeast, effectively just 8 coincidence counters, one on each corner of \nthe craft.  Positional information is triangulated from the \ndifferential signal arrival times at each of the detectors.\nPositional error would be predominantly determined by timing errors\nand errors in craft attitude. Since none of the 8 BASTE detectors have\nany independant angular resolution whatsoever, they can not be used to\ndetermine parallax.  Indeed, parallax would just add a very small \ncomponent to the positional error.  \n\nDemonstrating that these puppies are beyond the oort cloud would \nrequire resolution on the order of arcseconds, since the oort \ncloud is postulated to extend to about 0.5 parsec (all together \nnow: "Parallax ARc SECond", a parsec is the distance of an object \nthat demonstrates one arc second of parallax with a 2 AU base line).\nIf the 3 degree accuracy reported above is true, we're going to \nhave to add a BASTE to the pluto fast flyby to get enough baseline.\n\nThe beauty of BASTE is that it both gives positional information and\nwatches the entire sky simultaneously, a realy handy combination\nwhen you have no idea where the next burst is coming from.

All consipiracy theories aside, (they are watching though :-)), will NASA \ntry to image the Cydonia region of Mars where the "Face\n" is? If they can image it with the High resolution camera, it would \nsettle the FACE question once and for all. I mean, with a camera that \nwill have a pixel resolution of about 6 feet, we'd know whether all this \nstuff is real or imagination. \n\nCome on JPL and NASA folks, try to image it and settle this thing.

1. Please take this out of sci.space.\n\n2. Ayn Rand was not only born in Russia, but educated there. A lot\nof her philosophy reflects not only a European education but a \nreaction against certian events in Russia while she lived there.\nI've heard that to the extent there is a division of modern philosophy\nbetween the "Continental" and British/American schools, Rand belongs in\nthe former in terms of methodology et al, even though she was trying to\nsay things that would belong in the latter school.\n\nI.e. she was trapped in the language of Kant and Hegel, even though\nshe was trying to say (at times) much different things.

This is one of those "yes, but" things. It's true that a hydraulically\npressurized tube can be somewhat more rigid than an unpressurized tube,\nbut even at 2000 PSI levels a hydraulic hose will bend rather easily,\nthough it's straight-on compressive strength is high, and it's torsional \nresistance increase is practically nil. On the other grasping member, \nthere's no doubt that hydraulic "leverage" exists in nature. Tree roots \nare an example. Given time they can shatter concrete as osmotic pressure\nincreases.\n\n\nKangaroos 3-limbed? I don't think so. If you take the view that the\ntail is a limb, then monkeys and kangaroos are 5-limbed. I think the\ntail is a different kind of structure, grossly enlarged in the case\nof the kangaroo, but primarily still an instrument of balance rather\nthan locomotion. I don't know much about panda "thumbs", so I'll ask\nis it opposable?\n\n\nWell I won't say flat out that they can't be intelligent, but I'll\nbring a couple of lines of argument to bear to try to show why I\ndon't think it's likely. First let me say that when I say "intelligent"\nI mean complex behaviors in response to novel situations on a level\nwith, or greater than, human tool use and tool building. IE assuming\nsuitable manipulators are present on the creature to allow it to alter \nit's enviroment in a planned way, it will do so. That's certainly not\na universal or complete definition of intelligence, but it will suffice\nfor a putative technological alien.\n\nNow no one knows exactly what makes a brain capable of thought, but\nit's generally accepted that one of the criteria is a certain level\nof complexity. This is generally determined by the number of neuron\ncells, and their interconnections. So a creature the size of a lemur\nwouldn't have enough neurons to support complex thought. This argument\nis considerably less clear in the case of the dinosaur. There's room\nfor a large brain, though no indication that one ever developed. One\nreason this may be true is neuronic speed. The electrochemical messages \nthat trigger neurons require time to propagate. This makes it difficult\nfor a highly complex central brain to coordinate the movements of very\nlarge creatures. So there's little selection pressure for such brains.\nInstead, a simpler distributed network evolves. This doesn't rule out\nintelligent dinosaurs, but it points in that direction.\n\nThen there are the thermodynamic arguments. A tiny creature like the\nlemur needs to eat frequently because it's internal heat is rapidly\nlost due to it's high surface to volume ratio. I contend that a creature\nthat must spend most of it's time and energy feeding won't have the time\nto develop and exercise intelligence. That argument may be somewhat weak.\nThe dinosaur's problem is the reverse, it must moderate it's heat production \nbecause it's high volume to surface ratio makes it tend to retain waste heat. \nI'm assuming that a certain temperature range is optimal for chemical\nreactivity reasons for productive neuron function. So creatures would\ntend to need to maintain a regulated temperature in a range near that\nof humans if they are carbon based. That tends to rule out cold blooded\ncreatures as potential homes of intelligence. Some people contend that\nsome of the dinosaurs may have been warm blooded. But for a creature\nthe size of a brontosaur, it's activity levels would have to be restrained\nor it would be prone to generate an internal steam explosion from the\nwaste heat. Whales are similar size, but they can reject heat to the\nocean, a much more efficient sink than air. I suspect that for intelligence\nto manifest itself, a certain degree of activity in interacting with the\nenvironment is necessary. IE monkey curiousity. I doubt a large dinosaur\nwould be capable of that much activity.\n\nGary
I think to some extent this is a case of stooping to their level.  You assume\nthat the general public "can't handle the truth" and then, based on this \nassumption, go for the fluff arguments.  Then someone, who can understand a\ngood argument, comes along and asks "why don't you just develop the spinoffs?"\nor "why can't we just get our spinoffs from some other program, like the\nmilitary?"  There are some good arguments for space development without relying\non its side effects.  I'm not ignoring the value of spinoffs.  I simply think\nthat the general public deserves more credit than you give them.\n\n\nAnd if you're going to use spinoffs you better make darn sure you are right.\nTeflon has been around since before NASA.  As I understand it, Velcro was \nconceptualized by a french doctor who went walking in the woods and took the\ntrouble to wonder how burrs stick to your clothes.

Thanks to the people who have answered here and in email to my \nquestion about which countries engage in space surveillance. \nUnfortunately, I apparently didn't make the meaning of the message \nclear, since most replies have addressed satellite reconnaissance, \nrather than space surveillance \n\n     What I meant was _not_ which countries use satellites to look at \nthe Earth (satellite reconnaissance) , but _was_ which countries have \nprograms to detect and track (i.e., determine the orbital elements of) \nsatellites as they pass overhead (space surveillance). \n\n    The US uses missile-defense radars, supplemented by a fascinating \nquasi-radar operated by the Navy, to do this for satellites in LEO, and \nelectrooptical systems for objects at altitudes above 5,000 km or so. \nThe FEE, I understand, does much the same thing. \n\n    Amateur satellite observers use eyeballs, binoculars, stopwatches \nand PCs for objects out to around 1500 km, enabling them to keep track \nof satellites for which, ah, official element sets aren't available. \nSee the fascinating books by Desmond King-Hele for details, as well as \nthe files in the molczan directory on kilroy.jpl.nasa.gov.  The \nmaterial posted in my previous message suggests that Japan engages in \noptical and radar space surveillance to a modest degree, and it may be \nthat other countries do also. \n\n    Which was the question I meant to ask: who are they, how do they do \nit, and why do they do it?\n\n\nAllen Thomson                     SAIC                        McLean, VA
I'd hardly call the current Pluto Fast Flyby proposal "too large" (if the\nnew technology insertion currently taking place succeeds, the S/C mass will\ndrop to 110-120 kg) or "too expensive" ($400 million [FY92 $] for two S/C),\nespecially when compared to other NASA planetary missions.\n\n\nThis proposal would work only if your various targets are relaively nearby and\nthe require minimal delta-v from the mother ship.  A mission to the main belt\nmight be one possibility for such a mission -- I recall a paper being presented\nat an AIAA deisgn conference in Irvine in February where such a proposed\nspacecraft was designed by some grad students at UT Austin (I think).  Four\nmini-spacecraft would detatch from the main S/C, each visiting a seperate\nasteroid and then returning to the main S/C.  After analysis, the main S/C\nwould then be targeted for the most "interesting" object for further study.\n\nNow, if I could only *find* that paper...  =)

I don't think this will work.  Still the same in space\nintegration problems,  small modules, especially the Bus-1 modules.\nthe MOL would be bigger.   \n\nAlso,  budget problems  may end up stalling developemnt.  \nA small undersized station wont have the science community support.\n\n\nProgram effeciencies may cut costs,  but the basic problems\nwith freedom remain.  in space integration,  too many flights\ntoo build.  not enough science retrurn.  \n\n\nEssentialy  $5 billion to build MIR.\n\nI think had NASA  locked onto this design, back in 1984,  with\nscarring to support a TRUSS for real expandability,  we'd be looking\nat a flying space station.\n\nThis looks the most realistic, to me,  IMHO,  but,  i dont know if\nthere is enough will power  to toss the CDR'd  existing hardware\nand then  take a 1/3rd  power cut  and do it this way.\n\nthe core  launch station has a lot of positive ideas.  You could stick\nin more hatches for  experimental  concept modules.  Like the ET\nderived workshops.  Or inflatable modules.\n\npat\n\n\nSad but true.\n\nepitaph.  Killed by mis-management.

Correct, we have no parallax measurements on the bursts.\n\nTherefore, we can't tell whether they're slightly extra solar\nor not!\n\n(which means that parallax can't tell us whether or not it's real close.)
Has someone actually verified that mass is the predominant constraint on this\nmission?  You seem to be assuming it without giving supporting evidence.  \n\n\n\n\nPat, this would be slower, more expensive and worse.  \n\nSlower:  The shuttle mission is scheduled to go up in December.  That's less\nthan eight months away.  There is no way you could build new hardware, retrain\nand reschedule the EVA's in that time.\n\nMore Expensive:  Your proposal still requires the shuttle to do everything it\nwas going to do execpt fire the OMS.  In addition, you've added significant\nextra cost for a new piece of complex hardware.\n\n\nAccording to a GAO report on the OMV I have before me, there are\nonly two currently planned missions that could use such a vehicle -- HST and\nAXAF.  Since AXAF has since been scaled back and HST can rely on the shuttle,\nthere doesn't seem to be any need for your vehicle.
I would have to say that the "greatest philosopher" title would have to\ngo to Plato since the whole enterprise of philosophy was essentially\ndefined by him.  Although he got most of his answers wrong, he did \ndefinitively identify what the important questions are.  I think it\nwas Descartes who said that "All philosophy is just a footnote to Plato."\n\nIf I were to choose which philosopher made the most important advances\nin human knowledge over his lifetime, that's simple...it is Aristotle.\nThis is so much the case that many simply refer to him as "the philosopher".\n\nRegarding Nietzsche, he's one of the most entertaining, although since his\nideas were so fragmented (and since his life was cut short) it is doubtful\nthat his influence as a philosopher is likely to be very extensive 500 years\nfrom now.  They'll probably still be reading him in 500 years though.\n\nAs for "modern" philosophers, I would have to say that Kant was the most\ninfluential since he had such a strong influence on almost everyone who\ncame after him (and unfortunately, they maintained his errors and \namplified them over time).\n\nI would say that the most influential "american" philosopher would have to\nbe Dewey.\n\nBut as to the question of what philosopher will be most highly regarded in\n500 years, it may very well be Ayn Rand (who in every important respect\nwas "American", but was born in Russia).  But I guess that remains to be seen.

Dandridge Cole and Isaac Asimov collaborated on a book titled,\n"Habitable Planets for Man" (I think) in 1964.  It should be available\nin most good libraries, or through inter-library loan.\n\n   It answered the questions you ask (speculatively, of course), along\nwith many more that need to be considered in habitability studies:\nlength of day (for day/night temperature variation, and agricultural\nconcerns), partial pressures of certain unexpected gasses (ever hear of\nxenon narcosis?  neither did I), density of particulates in the atm, and\ntheir composition (ever hear of silicosis?  not much fun), etc.\n\n   Climate isn't a global phenomenon and probably needn't concern you,\nbut axial tilt ought to.  It plays a large part in determining the\nseverity of seasonal differences, and a lesser but still significant\npart in determining the speed of prevailing winds.
_The_ problem with Oort cloud sources is that absolutely\n   no plausible mechanism has been proposed. It would have\n   to involve new physics as far as I can tell. Closest to\n   "conventional" Oort sources is a model of B-field pinching\n   by comets, it's got too many holes in it to count, but at\n   least it was a good try...\n\nSo you have a plausible model for GRB's at astronomical distances?\nRecent observations have just about ruled out the merging neutron star\nhypothesis, which had a lot of problems, anyhow.  We have to look for\nimplausible models and what is fundamentally allowed independent of\nmodels.\n\nA paper on the possibility of GRB's in the Oort cloud just came\nthrough the astrophysics abstract service.  To get a copy of this\npaper, send a message to astro-ph@babbage.sissa.it with the subject\nline \n  get 9304001\n\n\nHere is the abstract of that paper.\n\n   The currently favored explanation for the origin of \GRBs puts them\n   at cosmological distances;\n   but as long as there is no distance\n   indicator to these events all possible sources which are\n   isotropically distributed should remain under consideration. This is\n   why the Oort cloud of comets is kept on the list,\n   although there is no known mechanism for generating \GRBs\n   from cometary nuclei. Unlikely as it may seem, the possibility that \GRBs\n   originate in the solar cometary cloud\n   cannot be excluded until it is disproved.\n\n   We use the available data on the distribution of \GRBs (the BATSE\n   catalogue up to March, 1992), and\n   the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits  by Marsden and Williams (1992) to\n   investigate whether there is any observational indication for correlations\n   between the angular distributions of \GRBs and comets' aphelia,\n   assuming that the distribution of aphelia direction reflect,\n   at least to some extent, true variations\n   in the column density of the Oort cloud. We also apply the $\vov$\n   test to both distributions.

Is HST really _that_ much heavier than a Spacelab ???\n\nbd
From the Pluto Fast Flyby Instrument definition research anouncemnet,\nthe instrument payload constraints are:\n    Mass allocation -  7 kilograms (15.4 lbs)\n    Power allocation - 6 watts\n    Required instruments:\n	Visible imaging system (1024x1024 CCD, 750 mm fl, f/10 optics)\n	IR mapping spectrometer (256x256 HgCdTe array, 0.3% energy resolution)\n	UV spectrometer (55-200 nm, 0.5 nm resolution)\n	Radio science (ultrastable oscilator incorporated in telecom system)\n		ultrastable means 10^-14.\n\nThis doesn't leave much room for payloads which are totally unrelated\nto the  mission of the spacecraft.  In addition, the power will come\nfrom a radioisotope thermal generator, and the whole space craft will\nbe about 2 feet in diameter, with no booms, which means there will be\nstrong gamma-lines from Pu-239 and associated schmutz in the\nbackground, which tends to reduce sensitivity somewhat.\n\nIt would still be nice, and our group here at Goddard is looking\nin to it.
Interstellar grains are not at all close to blackbodies.  The "large"\ngrains have sizes of order 0.1 micron and absorb visible light with\nfair efficiency.  However, at temperatures below 100 K, 90% of the\nthermal emission will be beyond 22 microns, where radiating\nefficiency is poor.  (A small antenna cannot easily radiate at long\nwavelengths.)  Thus the grains must heat up more in order to radiate\nthe energy they have absorbed.\n\nMoreover, the IRAS observations had a maximum wavelength of 100\nmicrons.  Grains colder than 30 K will radiate primarily at longer\nwavelengths, and IRAS would be relatively insensitive to them.  In\nthe extreme limit, grains as cold as 5 K will be almost undetectable\nby any conceivable observation.\n\nWorse still, IRAS color temperatures are heavily contaminated by a\npopulation of "small" grains.  These grains have only perhaps 50\natoms, and when they are hit by a single photon they heat up to\ntemperatures of several hundred or 1000 K.  Of course they cool\nquickly and then stay cold for a while, but _when they are radiating_\nthe characteristic temperature is several hundred K.  Even a small\npopulation of these grains can dramatically raise the observed\n"average" temperature.\n\nA model for local infrared emission consistent with COBE data has\nthree components.  These represent scattered radiation from Zodiacal\ndust (color temperature 5500 K), thermal emission from Zodiacal dust\n(Tc = 280 K), and thermal emission from Galactic dust (Tc=25 K).  At\nthe ecliptic poles, the emissivities or dilution factors are\nrespectively 1.9E-13, 4E-8, and 2E-5.  The first two are roughly\ndoubled in the ecliptic plane.\n\nTo find the thermal equilibrium temperature, we add up the dilution\nfactor times the fourth power of temperature for all components, then\ntake the fourth root.  In the table below, starlight comes from\nAllen's number that stellar emission from the whole sky is equivalent\nto 460 zero mag stars with B-V color of 0.75.  No doubt careful work\ncould do much better.  (The person who suggested starlight had a\ndilution factor of E-4 must have been remembering wrong.  We would be\ncooked if that were the case.  In any event, the energy density of\nstarlight comes out about the same as that of the microwave\nbackground, and I believe that to be correct.)\n\n                         Dilution   Temp.   DT^4\nMicrowave background         1        2.7     53\nGalactic dust              2E-5      25        8\nZodiacal dust (emission)   6E-8     280      369\nZodiacal dust (scattering) 3E-13   5500      275\nStarlight                  1E-13   5500       92\n                                           -----\n                                             797\n\nThe fourth root of 797 is 5.3 K.  Outside the Solar system, the\nresult would be 3.5 K.  \n\nI find these results surprising, especially the importance of\nZodiacal dust, but I don't see any serious mistakes.
Sorry, you have a _wish_ for an uncluttered night sky, but it\nisn't a right. When you get down to it, you actually have no rights\nthat the majority haven't agreed to give you (and them in the process).\nIt's a common misconception that being born somehow endows you with\nrights to this that and the other. Sadly this is not true.\n  Now if you want to talk about the responsibility that _should_ go with\nthe power to clutter the night sky, then that's a different matter.
I don't know.  Does anyone in NASA land know how much fuel is\nbudgeted for the altitude change?\n\nHenry,  any figures on the mass  (full)  for the EDO pallet  plus\nit's dry weight?  How about for the dry mass of Bus-1?  it was\nbeing de-classified as i checked last.\n\nAlso, I need.\n\n1)  current orbital parameters of HST \n\n2)  projected  orbital parameters after re-boost.\n\n3)  Discovery's  DRY weight\n\n4) HST's Dry weight.\n\n\n\nSo how long do they need to train?  a year?  2 years?  somehow\nI think 2-3 moths should be adequate.\n\n\nAlso because they significantly lacked on-orbit EVA experience.  \nThe HST is designed for on-orbit servicing.  it should be a lot easier.\n\n\nThere comes a time in every project, to kill the management.\n\nThey can if neccessary, re-schedule the  HST mission.  December is\nnot a drop dead date, unlike say the LDEF retrieval mission.  \n\n\n\nI suspect, the BUS-1, may not have enough basic thrust for the HST\nre-boost.  it mayu need bigger tanks,  or bigger thrusters.\n\n\nMy understanding is the Second HST servicing mission is not\na contingency.  My understanding is the mission  needs both\na new FOC  and work on the electrical system,  plus\nanother re-boost.   \n\n\nSomehow, i think the cost of an expendable SMT will be less then\n$500 million.\n\nand the extra stuff is real cheap.  NASA has lots of suits,  MMU's,\nand the EDO pallets are re-usable.  Oh, one double magnum of champagne,\nnow there's a couple hundred bucks.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat door has cycled, X times already.  Once after massive G loading.\nI somehow think they can work ou;reliability  methods to ensure the\ndoor works.\n\nAlso,  please tell me how some sort of sublimated  material  like\nCO2, or H2O  would manage to contaminate the mirror,  anything\nthat goes to vapor state, shouldn't adhere to the mirror.\n\nsomehow, the door,  problem can be worked.  maybe they can put a one\ntime spring on it.\n\nwhat do they do now, if the door hangs up.  that door is part\nof a intrument safing mechanism.  if it hangs up tomorrow,  it'll\nbe 8 months until someone gets up there witha crowbar to fix it.
I had to turn to one of my problem sets that I did in class for this\nlittle problem.  I don't have a calculator, but I DO have the problem set that\nwe did not too long ago, so I'll use that, and hope it's what you wanted.  \nThis is a highly simplified problem, with a very simple burst.  Bursts are\nusually more complex than this example I will use here.\n        Our burst has a peak flux of 5.43E-6 ergs cm^-2 sec^-1 and a duration\nof 8.95 seconds.  During the frst second of the burst, and the last 4 seconds,\nits flux is half of the peak flux.  It's flux is the peak flux the rest of the\ntime.  Assume that the background flux is 10E-7 erg cm^-2 sec^-1.\n        Then we had to find the integrated luminosity of the burst, for several\ndifferent spheres: R=.25pc(Oort Cloud Radius), R=22.5pc(at the edge of the\ngalaxy), R=183.5pc or the edge of the galactic corona, and lastly at a\nR=8800Mpc.  \n        We integrated the flux over all time to find the fluence, then used the\nold standby formula:\n                        Luminosity=4(pi)(r^2)Fpeak\n        For a radius of .25 pc, we found an L around 10^32 erg/sec.  Pretty\nenergetic for close by.  for the coronal model, we found around 10^43 erg/sec.\nAnd lastly, for the cosmological model an L=10^53. That's what you'd call\nmoderately energetic, I'd say.  Any suggestions about what could put out that\nmuch energy in one second? \n                                                -jeremy
We don't disagree on this.  All I said was that a right is whatever\nyou or somebody acting for you can enforce.  The Bill of Rights didn't\ncome into effect until it was ratified by the states (and indirectly,\nthe people); from that point it defined legal rights.  "Common law"\nrights are vague and situational; that's why the people insisted on a\nBill of Rights in the Constitution, spelling out exactly what they\ndemanded from the government.  Legitimate or illegitimate, power is\npower.  That's why the federal government can force states to grant\ntheir citizens rights they don't wish to: In a slugging match, the feds\nwin.  Period.\n\n   And you're right, this doesn't belong in sci.space.  I've said my\npeace.  No more frome me on rights (at least not here).
The "artist renderings" that I've seen of the HST reboost still have\nthe arrays fully extended, with a cradle holding HST at a ~30 degree\nangle to the Shuttle.  I think the rendering was conceived before the\narray replacemnet was approved, so I'm not sure if the current reboost\nwill occur with the arrays deployed or not.  However, it doesn't \nappear that an array retraction was necessary for reboost.\n\nThanks for the input on GRO's S/A design constraints.  That would \nexplain the similar design on UARS.\n\n\nHeck, the MMS project used to design _missions_ with servicing in mind.\nThe XTE spacecraft was originally designed as an on-orbit replacement\nfor the instrument module on EUVE.  That way, you get two instruments\nfor the price of one spacecraft bus (the Explorer Platform).  A \nsecond on-orbit replacement was also considered, with the FUSE telescope.
Dennis.\n\n	WE agree a lot ,  it's just we don't both post when we agree\non something.  And when we disagree, it tends to be a lot more\nnoticeable.;-)
I hate to belabor the obvious once again, but if there had been an Orbiter\nemergency in the early stages of the original HST deployment mission, they\nwould have HAD to land with HST in the bay. \n\nIndeed they were worried about that.  One concern was the possibility that\nthey would lose a motor or something on the way up, and make orbit but one\nthat was too low to give HST a useful lifetime against atmospheric drag.  \nI believe the decision was to deploy HST even if the projected lifetime was\nas short as six months.  In fact we got an excellent orbit, on the upper\nenvelope of what the Shuttle can do.\n\nI have never heard of any serious consideration that HST might be brought \ndown for refurbishment.  You would have the horrendous cost of transporting,\ncleaning, re-testing, and re-certifying all the hardware on the ground, in\naddition to the lost observing time and the cost of a second deployment \nmission with the risks that we might not get such a good orbit the second \ntime.  And, you would probably STILL need a (third) servicing mission in a \nfew years as gyros and other components wear out.  Better to have two \nservicing missions in space (which could well happen) than to bring HST down \nand take it up again.
Static test firings are now scheduled for this Saturday.....after many\nschedule changes.....
I'm worried by the concern about it though, for a number of reasons\nthat have nothing to do with Space Advertising (which for a number of\nreasons is probably doomed to fail on financial grounds).\n\n(And I've been reading and (and writing) this thread since way\nback when it was only on sci.space).\n\nFor starters, I don't think the piece of light-pollution apparatus\nwould be as bright as the full moon. _That_ seems to me to be a bit\nof propaganda on the part of opponents, or wishful thinking on the\npart of proponents.\n\nSecond, this charge of ruining the night sky permanently has been\nlevelled against other projects, that either 1) don't increace light\npollution significantly, or 2) increace light pollution only over the\ntarget area.\n\nYou may or may not recognize #1 as being Solar Power Sattelites.\nI think it was Josh Hopkins who actually did the math, showing that\nSPS's weren't that bright after all, ending some two months of frenzied\nopposition on the part of dark-sky activists and various other types.\n\n#2 is mainly projects like the orbiting mirror the CIS tested\nrecently.  While slightly more worrisome, I'd like to point out that\nany significant scattering of light outside the target area for one of\nthese mirrors would be wasted as far as the project would be\nconcerned, and something any project like that would work against\nanyway. And given some of the likely targets, I don't think there's\ngoing to be much of an outcry from the inhabitants. There is too much\ndark sky in the northern CIS during the winter, and I doubt you'll find\nmany activists in Murmansk demanding the "natural" sky back. If anything,\nhe'll probably be inside, stripped buck naked in front of the UV lamp,\nmaking sure he'll get enough vitamin D for the "day."\n\nThe mirror experiments aren't something they're doing for crass\nadvertising. They think that if they can build one, it'll be one of\nthose things people in the affected areas will think they couldn't\nhave lived without before. And I doubt anyone's going to really be\nable to convince them to stop.
I'm not sure if this will help you, but the (local) interstellar\nradiation field has been measured and modeled by various groups.  If I\nremember things correctly, the models involved contributions from three\ndifferent BB sources, so there's no obvious "temperature" of background\nradiation in our local area.  However, the following references give the\ninterstellar radiation density as a function of wavelength, and you can\nintegrate and average in an appropriate manner to get an "effective"\ntemperature if you like:\n\nWitt and Johnson (1973) Astrophys. J. 181, 363 - 368\nHenry et al. (1980) Astrophys. J. 239, 859 - 866\nMathis et al. (1983) Astron. Astrophys. 128, 212 - 229\n\nAs you can see, the references are out of date, but they might get you\nstarted.\n\nHope this helps,

With\nactivities beginning at shortly before 5:00 AM yesterday, C9 commanded\nthe spacecraft to execute a series of slews and rolls to provide the MAG\n(Magnetometer) Team data points in varying spacecraft attitudes and\norientations for the purpose of better characterizing the\nspacecraft-generated magnetic field and its effect on their instrument.\n\nThe spacecraft was commanded back to Sun Star Init state at 9:07 AM to\nre-establish Inertial Reference.  Transition back to Array Normal Spin\nbegan at 11:17 AM, after which the sequence powered on the on-board\ntransmitter at 11:18 AM.  Telemetry reacquisition occurred at\napproximately 11:30 AM at the 4 KBS Science and Engineering downlink\ndata rate on the High Gain Antenna.  Subsystem engineers report that all\nsystems appear to be nominal.  The command to terminate using the Low\nGain Antenna for uplink was sent at 12:31 PM.  Uplink and Downlink are\ncurrently via the HGA.\n\nMAG Calibration data has been recorded on Digital Tape Recorders 2 and 3.\nPlayback of DTR 2 is scheduled to take place tomorrow morning between\n8:11 AM and 12:42 PM.  Playback of DTR 3 is scheduled to take place\ntomorrow evening beginning at 11:57 PM and ending at 4:28 AM on Friday.\nDTR playback will be performed via the High Gain Antenna at 42,667 bits\nper second.  Upon verification of successful DTR playbacks, downlink will\nbe maintained at the 4K S & E rate.
I disagree with what to tout, although I agree that the space program is\ninherently a good thing.  Most people today only care about "what will it\ncost me?" and "what's in it for me?" and could care less about whether\nsomething is simply worthwhile in and of itself.  Our society has become\nincreasingly geared toward the short-term (which you could read as NOW!). \nThey couldn't care less about next week, much less next century.  They want\nsomething to show for the expenditure and they want it *now*.\n\nI think we *should* tell them about the things that they are using now that\nare spinoffs of the space program.  That is the only way you can *prove*\nits worth to *them* - and they vote and pay taxes too.  The continued\nexistence of the space program relies upon that money.\n\njust my $.02\n\nBTW: don't forget Velcro...

HST is about 25,500 lbs (11,600 kg).  That doesn't include the cradle that\nwould have been in the cargo bay when it was deployed.  Spacelab-J on STS-47\nwas 21,861 lbs (according to the press-kit). \n\nAs someone else pointed out if they had been unable to deploy it for some\nreason that would have had to land with it still in the cargo bay and this\nwas a planned for contingency.  This is not a problem for the shuttle,\nthough it would eliminate KSC as a landing site, they still have to go to\nEdwards when landing with something like Spacelab in the cargo bay. \n\n--GaryM

Analog SF magazine did an article on a similar subject quite a few\nyears ago.  The question was, if an alien spacecraft landed in\nWashington, D.C., what was the proper organization to deal with it: The\nState Department (alien ambassadors), the Defense Department (alien\ninvaders), the Immigration and Naturalization Service (illegal aliens),\nthe Department of the Interior (new non-human species), etc.  It was\nvery much a question of our perception of the aliens, not of anything\nintrinsic in their nature.  The bibliography for the article cited a\nphilosophical paper (the name and author of which I sadly forget; I\nbelieve the author was Italian) on what constitutes a legal and/or moral\nperson, i.e., a being entitled to the rights normally accorded to a\nperson.  The paper was quite interesting, as I recall.\n\n   I think you'd have to be very careful here if the answer is yes.  The\nhuman track record on helping those poor underpriveleged cultures (does\nunderpriveleged mean not having enough priveleges?) is terrible.  The\nusual result is the destruction or radical reorganization of the\nculture.  This may not always be wrong, but that's the way to bet.
You may want to put Hubble back in the payload bay for a reboost,\nand you don't want to clip off the panels each time.\n\nFor the Gamma-Ray Observatory, one of the design requirements was that\nthere be no stored-energy mecahnisms (springs, explosive squibs, gas shocks,\netc.) used for deployment.  This was partially so that everything could\nbe reeled back in to put it back in the payload bay, and partially for\nsafety considerations.  (I've heard that the wings on a cruise missile\nwould cut you in half if you were standing in their swath when they opened.)\n\nBack when the shuttle would be going up every other day with a cost to\norbit of $3.95 per pound :-), everybody designed things for easy servicing.
And most definitely read it in conjunction with Heinlein's _Starship\nTrooper_.  The two books are radically different viewpoints of the\nsame basic premises.

How big of a lightning rod, would you need for protection?\nand  would you need jupiter as a ground plane.
The aperture door will be shut during reboost. Using the shuttle\nmeans that there will be someone nearby to pry the door open again \nif it should stick.
Just to throw it out there:  The mass of the telescope is 11,600 kg \n(25,500 lb).  I do not know what Space lab weighs, but I believe it is\nless.  Can anyone verify??\n\nAlso, remember that weight was not the only concern, as many others have \nnoted, just one possible concern.  I was responding to a statement that\nif you can boost it, why can't you land it.  Those are too different\nproblems.\n\nROB\n-- \n===========================================================================\n===========================================================================\n\nDisclaimer-type-thingie>>>>>  These opinions are mine!

I assume that can only be guessed at by the assumed energy of the\n   event and the 1/r^2 law.  So, if the 1/r^2 law is incorrect (assume\n   some unknown material [dark matter??] inhibits Gamma Ray propagation),\n   could it be possible that we are actually seeing much less energetic\n   events happening much closer to us?  The even distribution could\n   be caused by the characteristic propagation distance of gamma rays \n   being shorter then 1/2 the thickness of the disk of the galaxy.
The following is what they feed to us..... most has been posted already,\nbut there are a number of items not seen here yet.....\n\nRedesign Activities Update -- Following is the weekly status on redesign,\nbased on information provided by NASA headquarters.\n\nThe station Redesign Team (SRT) provided a detailed status report to the\nAdvisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 22.  The\nday-long meeting was held in ANSER facilities in Crystal City, VA; topics\ncovered by the SRT included a preliminary mission and goals statement for\nthe space station; science, technology and engineering research; the\nassessment process; and the design approach. Discussions on management\noptions and operations concepts also were held.\n\nThe Design Teams then presented the three options under study:\n\n¥ Option A - Modular Buildup -- Pete Priest presented the A option. Priest\nsaid the team is working to define a station that meets cost goals and has\nidentified three distinct phases of evolution - power station, human tended\nand permanent presence. The team will define the minimum capability needed\nto achieve each phase, the total cost of each phase and the achievable\ncapability for budget levels. The A option uses current or simplified\nFreedom hardware where cost effective and is considering other existing\nsystems such as the so-called "Bus-1 spacecraft," the orbiter and Spacelab.\n\nThe Power Station Capability could be achieved in 3 flights with Freedom\nphoto voltaic modules providing 20 kW of power. 30-day Shuttle/Spacelab\nmissions docked to the power station are assumed for this phase.\n\nHuman Tended Capability would be provided by the addition of the U.S.\nCommon Module Module which adds subsystems and 9 payload racks and docking\nports for ESA and Japanese laboratories. 60-day missions with the orbiter\ndocked to the station are assumed for this phase. Different\noperation/utilization modes are being studied for this phase.\n\n¥ Option B - Freedom Derived -- Mike Griffin presented the status of Option\nB activities. Griffin detailed the evolution of the Freedom-derived option,\nfrom initial Research Capability, to Human-Tended Capability, to Permanent\nHuman Presence Capability, to Two Fault Tolerance, and finally Permanent\nHuman Capability. Griffin also outlined proposed systems changes to the\nbaseline program, with minor changes to the Communications and Tracking\nsystem, Crew Health Care System and ECLSS, and a major change to the Data\nManagement System.\n\nInitial Research Capability would be achieved with 2 flights to 28.5 degree\ninclination (3 flights to 51.6 degrees) and consist of an extended duration\norbiter-Spacelab combination docked to a truss segment with 2 photo voltaic\narrays providing 18.75 kW of power.\n\nHuman-Tended Capability would be achieved in 6 flights and add truss\nsegments and the U.S. lab.\n\nPermanent Human Presence Capability would be achieved in 8 flights with two\norbiters providing habitation and assured crew return.\n\nTwo Fault Tolerance, achieved in 11 flights, would build out the other\nsection of truss with another set of PV modules, thermal control and\npropulsion systems.\n\nThe freedom derived configuration could achieve an International Complete\nstate with 16 flights.  Three more flights, to bring up the habitat module,\na third PV array and two Assured Crew Return Vehicles (ACRV) would complete\nthe Permanent Human Capability with International stage.\n\nGriffin told the Redesign Advisory Committee that eliminating hardware\nwould not, by itself, meet budget guidelines for the Freedom derived\noption.  Major reductions or deferrals must occur in other areas including\nprogram management, contractor non-hardware, early utilization and\noperations costs, he said.\n\n¥ Option C - Singe Launch Core Station -- Chet Vaughn presented Option C,\nthe Single Launch Core Station concept.  A Shuttle external tank and solid\nrocket boosters would be used  to launch the station into orbit.  Shuttle\nmain engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launch\nand jettisoned after ET separation.\n\nThe module, 23 feet in diameter and 92 feet long, would provide 26,000\ncubic feet of pressured volume, separated into 7 "decks" connected by a\ncentralized passageway.  Seven berthing ports would be located at various\nplaces on the circumference of the module to place the international\nmodules, and other elements.  This "can" would have two fixed photo voltaic\narrays producing approximately 40 kW of power flying in a solar interial\nattitude.\n\nIn his closing comments to the Redesign Advisory Committee, Bryan O'Connor\nsaid a design freeze would be established for the 3 options on April 26 so\nthat detailed costing of the options can begin.  The next meeting with the\nRedesign Advisory Committee will be May 3.\n\nRussian Consultants Arrive in U.S. -- A delegation of 16 Russian space\nexperts arrived in the U.S. on April 21 and briefings to the SRT by members\nof the Russian team began on the 22nd.  The group includes Russian Space\nAgency General Director Y. M. Koptev, and V. A. Yatsenko, also of the RSA. \nOthers on the team include representatives from the Ministry of Defense,\nthe Design Bureau SALYUT, the Institute of Biomedical Problems, the\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs, NPO Energia and TsNIJMASH.  The Russian team\nbriefed the SRT on environmental control and life support system, docking\nsystems, the Proton launch vehicle, Mir operations and utilization, and the\nSoyuz TM spacecraft.\n\nThe Russian consultants are available to the SRT to assess the capabilities\nof the Mir space station, and the possible use of Mir and other Russian\ncapabilities and systems as part of the space station redesign.  They will\nbe available to the SRT through May 5.\n\nManagement and Operations Review Continues --  Work continued in the SRT\nsubgroups.  The Management Group under Dr. Walt Brooks is working to\ndevelop a family of options that solve the current problems and build a\nfoundation for the transition to development and operations.  Various\nmanagement options have been developed including:\n\n¥ Lead Center with the Center Director in the programmatic chain of\ncommand.\n\n¥ Host Center with the Program Manager reporting directly to an Associate\nAdministrator.\n\n¥ Skunk Works/Dedicated Program Office with a small dedicated co-located\nhand-picked program office.\n\n¥ Combine Space Station with Shuttle, with the space station becoming an\nelement of the current program.\n\n¥ Major Tune Up to Current Organization, with current contracts and\ngeographical distribution maintained but streamlined.\n\nThe Operations Group under Dr. John Cox is building on the work of the\nOperations Phase Assessment Team lead by Gene Kranz of NASA-JSC, which had\nalready begun a comprehensive review of operations and had concluded in its\npreliminary results that significant cost reductions are possible.\n\nAs part of its work,  the Operations Group has identified teams of agency\nexperts to develop detailed evaluations of each design in the areas of\nassembly and operations, utilization, maintenance and logistics and testing\nand ground operations.\n\nWhat's in the Week Ahead? -- The Design Support Teams will provide a\ncomprehensive status of their option to the Station Redesign Team on Monday\nand Tuesday at which point the design will be "frozen" to begin the\ndetailed cost assessment.   Also this week, the team will begin preparing\nfor the next round of discussions with the redesign Advisory Committee, to\nbe held May 3.\n\nDr. Shea Steps Down --  Dr. Joe Shea stepped down as director of the\nStation Redesign Team on April 22 and Bryan O'Connor will take over the\nactivities of the team.  Dr. Shea submitted his resignation as assistant\ndeputy administrator for space station analysis, but will continue to serve\nas a special advisory to NASA Administrator Goldin and be available to\nconsult with the SRT. Mr Goldin accepted the resignation so that a request\nfrom Dr. Shea to reduce his workload could be accommodated.\n\nKey Milestones -- The key dates for the SRT as they are currently being\ncarried on the schedule are:\n\nApril 26\nDesign Freeze on Options for Costing\n\nApril 27\nDesign Support Team Present Selected Options to SRT\n\nMay 3\nStatus report to Redesign Advisory Committee\n\nMay 15\nInterim report by Redesign Advisory Committee\n\nJune 7\nFinal report to Redesign Advisory Committee
We've been progressing towards that goal for 30 years now.  We precede\nany orbiting mission with flyby missions.  Of course, it gets harder to\ndo as we work our way farther away from Earth.  We're just starting to\nwork out to the outer planets: Galileo will orbit Jupiter, and Cassini around \nSaturn.

Fine. I'll buy from George. GEORGEEE!!!!\n\nThat assumes I can't weasel out a cooperative venture of some sort (cut me a\nbreak on the launcher, I'll cut you in on the proceeds if it works).

This presupposes that no supersonic ramjet aircraft/spacecraft can be reliable\nor low-cost.  This is unproven.
Could someone explain where these names come from?   I'm sure there's a \nperfectly good reason to name a planetoid "Smiley," but I'm equally sure that\nI don't know what that reason is.
Basically the right question, although I was interested in cases closer\nto home where the Sun is behind either a natural object or effective\nshielding.\n\n\nGood point (and thanks for the references).
Davis Nicoll sez;\n\nI'd buy that for two reasons.  The tubes for TV's and radios (if you can\nstill find them) are usually 3x or more expensive than comparable transistors.\n\nAlso, ask any electric-guitar enthusiast which type of amp they prefer, and\nthey'll tell you tube-type, since tubes have lower distortion and noise\nthan transistors.  'Course, most of your electric guitar types just say\n"Tubes sound better, dude." :-)\n\nAlso, transistors have the advantage in both waste-heat and energy-use,\nmainly because of the heaters on the cathodes of the tubes.\n\n-Tommy Mac\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTom McWilliams 517-355-2178 wk   \\ As the radius of vision increases,\n18084tm@ibm.cl.msu.edu 336-9591 hm \\ the circumference of mystery grows.
How about the discussion of the STS Tether experiment.  Ran forward,\nit would suck energy from the Earth's magnetic field, while trivially\nslowing the Shuttle.  It could also have run backward -- if they ran \nelectricity through the tether the other way, it would have trivially\npropelled the Shuttle faster.\n\nBut an even better example comes to mind.  There's this electronics guy,\nsomeone like Craig Anderton or Don Lancaster.  Ten years ago he wrote about\nan invention of his.  He could take a light-detector, run current through\nit at about a hundred times its rating, and it would glow.  He got legal\nrights to this design of a combination "fiber optic emitter/receiver".  This\nturned out to be the basic unit of ATT's  (I think) plan to bring Brazil's\ncommunications system into the 21st century.  (The article was mostly about\nhis legal wranglings with the company that eventually got him well-compensated\nfor his invention.)

Of course,  they then  turn up the REverb, the Gain,  add in the analog\ndelay line  and the Fuzz box.  I'd think they wouldn't notice the\ndistortion.   Oh I forgot the phase shifters.\n\n\n\nAh,  but how do they compare to Mechanical systems :-)

I don't think that idea means what you think it does. Having everyone\non Earth subject to some ad agency's "poor taste" *is* an abomination.\n(abomination : n. loathing; odious or degrading habit or act; an\nobject of disgust. (Oxford Concise Dictionary)) Maybe *you* don't mind\nhaving every part of your life saturated with commercials, but many of\nus loathe it. I'd rather not have the beauty of the night sky always marred\nby a giant billboard, and I'll bet the idea is virtually sacrilegious\nto an astronomer like Sagan.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nI am sure your numbers are far better then mine.  As i said above,\ni don't have exact numbers.\n\n\nHow different would the contamination threat of a small manuevering tug\nbe from that of the Shuttle and it's OMS engines??????\n\nI know that no small manuevering tug exists,  but maybe  one could\nsoup up a Bus 1.   Does anyone out there have the de-clasified\nspecs on hte BUS 1?  would it be able to provide enough  control\nforce to balance the HST,  and  still have the rocket thrust\nto hurl her into a decent high orbit?\n\n\nSorry,  that should be intrument pointing.\n\n\nPlus, if the second box gets fritzy, you could be in shitter ville\nreal fast.\n\n\nThe problem is no-one seems to have the exact numbers.  When the mission\nwas planned originally at 3 spacewalks,  and 3 astronauts,  there was\nenormous concern over the mass margins for the flight.  THey\nhave now planned for 5 EVA's,  an 11 day mission and have 2 reserve\nEVA's and an emergency EVA.  Obviously that is coming from somewhere.\nMy guess is the OMS burn  fuel,  or  re-boost  margin.   \n\nI just figured, if GOldin wants to really,  prove out faster, cheaper\nbetter,   have some of the whiz kids  slap together an expendable\nspace manuevering tug  out of a BUs1,  and use that for the re-boost.\nit has to be better then using the Discovery as a tow truck.
Idea for repair of satellites:\n\nWarning I am getting creative again:\n\nWhy not build a inflatable space dock.\n\nBasically deploy one side of the space dock (using a scissor shaped structure,\nsaw it on beyond 2000), then maneuer the side to next to the satellite and then\nmove the rest of the dock around the satellite and seal it..\nThe inflate the dock with a gas (is does not have to be oxygen, just neeeds to\nbe non-flameble, non-damaging to the satellite and abel to maintain heat),\nthenheat the space dock (for the astronaut who will be working onthe satellite\nto be able to not have to wear the normal bulky space suit, but a much striped\ndown own).. \n\nI know this might take a slot of work or not??? Or just to plain wierd, but\nideas need to be thought of, for where is tomorrow, but in the imagination of\nthe present..

Tell that to the people who run the 10-meter Keck telescope, or the \nastronomers and engineers working on the Gemini twin 8-meter telescope\nproject.  It took 7 years to build Keck I and now they are building\nKeck II.  According to the December 1992 Sky & Telescope, "This\nsecond 10-meter eye will convert the facility into a binocular telescope\nwith double the light-gathering power and the ability to resolve\nthe headlights of a car some 25,000 kilometers away."   Japan's 8.3-meter\nSubaru telescope will soon join Keck on Mauna Kea.  All these telescopes\nwill work in the infrared, yes, but they are _visible light_ telescopes!\n\nAnd haven't you heard anything about adaptive optics?  A lot of research\nwas done with "Star Wars" funding, and some is now being shared with\nastronomers.  This shows great promise.  Soon, probably within a few\nyears, even the largest telescopes will be able to resolve to their \ntheoretical limit _despite_ the distortions of the atmosphere.\n\nTo say that "visible light astronomy is already a dying field" is \npure hokum.  To use the "logic" that things are already bad, so it doesn't\nmatter if it gets worse is absurd.  Maybe common sense and logic\nare the dying fields.\n\nGeorge Krumins

There have been several papers published on the\nsubject and I'll collect some references.  There may be an\narticle in the IBM Systems Journal Late '93, early '94.\n\nThere is no magic formula.  We did it with dedicated and disciplined\nfolks who worked to put together a process that finds and removes errors\nand is corrected based on errors that "escape".  We present a\none day overview of our process periodically to interested folks.\nThe next one is May 19th in Washington, D.C.  I can fax specifics\nto those who are interested.\n\nBret Wingert\nWingert@VNET.IBM.COM
Or perhaps even weird?\n\n\nHmmm, you might want to read this group more carefully; there's been a good \namount of discussion of the proposed Pluto Fast Flyby (PFF) mission that is \nspecifically designed to be small and cheap.
I know this is kinda off the subject of sci.space, but not really, I want to\nanswer this for their, as well as everyone else's information.  What these\npeople are proposing, by and large already exists and can be purchased today.\n\nIt is called labview by National Instruments.  IT is a wonderful object\noriented graphical programming language.  IT has been implemented on\nboth Mac's PC's and VME unix boxes.  IT is fare superior to any programming\napproach that I have ever seen and allowed us to decrease the software\ndevelopment time for our shuttle payloads by 90 percent.  This program is\nnot dependendant on specific hardware and already has exensive analysis \ncapability.\n\nWhy re-invent the wheel on a platform that may not exist? It is a great\nidea but look out there at what is available today.  The Hydrogen leak on\nthe Shuttle was found using this software. All SSME control and simulation\nstudies, along with the real testing at MSFC is handled with LabVIEW.  There\nare tons of applications, with the ability to create "virtual" instruments\nthat can accomplish any specific custom task the maker desires.  With the\naddition of IEEE-488 support, the computer becomes a virtual control station,\nallowing the graphic representation of remote instrumentation. With serial\nI/O support that instrument can be anywhere.  The ground control software\nfor the main control of SEDSAT 1 will utilize this approach.
It's not quite what you were asking, but a few years ago I helped some EE\nremote sensing people run some experiments on the microwave emmissivity of\nice; they used the sky for a background calibration source.  They said that\nfrom Earth's surface the sky looks like a 60K blackbody.
I'd be willing to bet that a majority of the cost difference could be\naccounted for by the AF's requirement for superfluous 2167 documentation, 5\nor 6 huge requirements and design reviews, travel expenses flying personnel\naround to meetings, and over specifying the hardware. I doubt that the\nactual fabrication cost in materials and labor would be very different from\nSDIO's costs.
This is, shall we say, an overly-broad statement.  In particular, are you\nreferring to the native American culture that existed in 1400, or the one\nthat existed in 1800?  (Simplify things by assuming we're talking about\nthe eastern US rather than the whole continent.)  Given that those were\n*radically* different cultures, which one are you referring to?\n\n\nNote that the pre-Columbian native Americans, east of the Mississippi,\ndid all of these things.  (Well, maybe not "on Sunday", but they did\nhave organized religions, not to mention cities and governments.)  If\nyou are judging the native Americans by the tribal culture that existed\nin 1800, you might want to read an account of the De Soto expedition\nto find out what pre-Columbian native American culture, at least in the\nmore civilized parts of the continent, was like.
Picture our universe floating like a log\nin a river.  As the log floats down the\nriver, it occasionally strikes rocks, the\nbank, the bottom, other logs.  When this collission\noccurs, kinetic energy is translated into heat, the\nlog degrades, gets scraped up, and other energy \ntranslaions occur.  The distribution of damage to\nthe log depends on the shape of the log.\n\nHowever, to a very small virus in a mite on the head of a\ntermite in the center of the log, the shock waves from the\ncollissions would appear uniformly random in direction.\n\nThis is my theory for GRB.  They are evidence of our universe\ninteracting with other universes!  Why not!  Makes\njust as much sense as the GRB coming from the Oort cloud!\n\nThe log theory of universes can't be ruled out!\n\nOf course, I'm a layman in the physics world.  You \nphysicists out there, Tell me about this !!!!
Actually, both numbers are correct.  The difference is in the direction\nof the acceleration.  For pilots, accelerations tend to be transverse to\nthe direction you're facing (pulling out from a steep dive, the\nacceleration will force blood toward your feet, for instance).  In this\ncase, you can only put up with about 8 g's even with a pressure suit.  \n\nThe record for acceleration, though, is measured along "the direction\nyou're facing" (for lack of a better term).  As I recall, this record\nwas set in rocket sleds back in the 60's -- and was about 40 g's or so.
Well pat for once I agree with you and I like your first idea that you had.\nIT probably is the gamma ray signature of the warp transitions of interstellar\nspacecraft! :)\n\nWell it makes as much sense as some things. I was at the first Gamma Ray\nBurst conference here at UAH and had great fun watching the discomfiture\nof many of the Gamma Ray scientists. Much scruitiny was given to the\ndata reductions. I remember one person in particular who passionately declared\nthat the data was completely wrong as there were no explanation for the\nphenomena of the smooth sky distribution. (heck it even shoots down the\nwarp transition theory :(. The next conference is soon and I will endeavour\nto keep in touch with this fun subject.
That's fine idea, but it only works if the lighting/power company even bothers to supply good light fixtures.  For instance, a power company in Virginia \nrecently asked a state commission for permission to sell more lights of various\ntype.  Yet, all of the different fixture that they sold and wanted to sell\nwere bad designs - one that wasted the light.  Thus, you couldn't even buy\na good light from them.  In most places, to get a good light, you have to\neither order it special at high cost or call a store in Arizona.  At some\npoint, society starts to make rules.  Cars have to pass safety tests.  \nCompanies have to meet pollution standards, etc..  There are two ways to achieve this:  educate the public so that they demand good lighting or force code\ndown the lighting companies backs.  History seems to suggest that the latter\nis more likely to work.\n\nAgreed, so I won't respond again.  It's important for all you spacers out \nthere to realize that some people will object to various wild ideas that \nhave been presented.  Just like Congress, it would be best to consult\nthe astronomers/lovers of the night sky before you try some PR stunt\nto boost public knowledge about space.
James Nicholl sez;\n\nJeff responds;\n\n\nI wouldn't worry too much about it, Jeff.

The compressed image format used for the Voyager disks is not (yet)\nsupported by any Macintosh display software that I know of. However,\nthere does exist a program that can convert the images to a format that\nis recognized by recent versions of both Pixel Pusher and NIH/Image. It\nis called "PDS Decompress" and is available via anonymous ftp from the\n"pub" directory on "delcano.mit.edu" [18.75.0.80]. This is a Binhex/\nStuffit archive and contains the application itself, Think-C source,\nand a very brief description.\n\nThe most recent version of NIH/Image (1.48) may be down-loaded from\n"starhawk.jpl.nasa.gov", where it is located in "image148.hqx" in the\n"pub" directory. This archive also contains source code, but not the\ndocumentation, which is located in the "image1455.hqx" archive in the\nsame directory.
Of course,\n\n	How many government projects after Using PERT, GANT, C.P.M.s\nProcess flow diagrams,  Level 5 software projects....  actually\ncome in on schedule and under Cost.  I know the GAO determined\nthat 80% of all NASA projects  miss their budgets due to failing\nto adequately measure  engineering developement costs.   \n\nMe, I am allin favor of Government R&D.  I thought Bell Labs was one of the best \nto do research.   I don't think the government should pour money\ninto any one sector,  but should engage in projects which naturally\npush the state of the art.  \n\nTHings like  High tech  construction projects,  apollo  was worth it for the doing.  Running hte national labs.  The SSC is grossly overweight,  but\nis a reasonable project at a lower cost.  \n\nUnfortunately support for solo investigators is direly neglected.\n\nMaybe what they should do, is throw out much of the process and just tell\nnew PH'ds,  you get a 1 time grant of $50,000.00   If you produce, you\ncan  qualify for other grants.  If you don't  you never get in again.\n\nTHis way  young people get a shot at  reserach,  and older  stale \nscientists don't dominate the process.

According to this reasoning there are no rights, at least none that I can think \nof....\n\nLet's see.  Do I have a right to unpolluted air?  No, because the majority\ndrive cars and use goods that create air pollution in the manufacturing process.\n\nDo I have the right to clean water?  I guess not, by the same reasoning.\nI could go on with these examples for a long time....\n\nLook at Nazi Germany.  Because of the majority, Jews, homosexuals, blacks,\nand others that were different had no rights.  In fact they were terrorized, \nimprisoned, and slaughtered.  In this country did blacks have the right to be\nfree from slavery?  I guess not, because the majority said that slavery was \ngood for them.\n\nI think that a right has a moral imperative.  If a law, imposed by the majority,\nis immoral, one should not follow it.  In fact, one should do everything in\nhis/her power to stop it. Of course, that doesn't mean that I would lose all\ncommon sense to break the law, just because I thought it was immoral.  I pay\nmy Federal Income Tax even though I am morally opposed to the U.S. Government\ntaking my money and spending it on weapons of mass destruction and terrorism.\nThis is precisely the point I am trying to make.  We should _persude_ people \nby logic, pointing out that it is in their self-interest to let all have\nequal rights in all aspects of life, including adequate housing, food, and\nmedical care.  I just happen to think that for a full life the aesthetic of\nbeauty and joy is also necessary.  That is why I consider an uncluttered\nnight sky a right.\n\nHave you ever been out in the desert, away from local lights, and most people?\nThe sky is dark and transparent.  The Milky Way is ablaze with more detail\nthan you thought possible.  The beauty and wonder takes your breath away.\n\nNow imagine you live in the worst ghetto, say in L.A. Due to light pollution\nyou have never seen a dark sky.  You might in fact never, not in your whole\nlife, ever see the majesty of the night sky.  Every where around you, you see\nsqualor, and through your life runs a thread of dispair. What is there to live\nfor?  \n\nI admit these two scenarios are extreme examples, but I have seen both.\nI, for one, need dreams and hopes, and yes, beauty, as a reason for living.\nThat is why I consider an uncluttered night sky a right.\n\nGeorge
Well,  you better not get the shuttle as your launch vehicle.\n\nand most ELV's have too  far of a backlog for political messages.\n\nIf during the campaign season,  the candidates for president had\nlaunched one,  right around now we'd  be getting a launch\nfor PEROT 92.\n\nand if they had used the shuttle,  we'd be seeing launches\nfor NIXON now more then ever.
I feel compelled to complain: the statement that recent observations\nrule out merging neutron stars as sources of gamma-ray bursts is\nutterly false, even though it is popular enough to make it to\nBATSE press releases.\nThe idea behind the statement is as follows: \n     "if you smack two neutron\n      stars together, or have a neutron star be gobbled up by a black hole,\n      a lot of energy is released, enough for a gamma-ray burst at a\n      cosmological distance. But, so the reasoning continues, this energy \n      is released below a lot of matter, so the radiation becomes\n      thermalized and you expect to see roughly a blackbody spectrum.\n      The observed spectra are strongly non-thermal, so this model must\n      be wrong."\nAs so often, the fault lies with the imagination of the person who\nwas trying to prove the model wrong rather than with the model. It\nmay be that the initial energy release is not seen as a gamma-ray\nburst, but the 'fireball' of energy and matter that is created\nmay spew out a relativistic flow. When this slams into the surrounding \nmedium, a strong flux of non-thermal gamma rays results, which may\ncarry off a substantial fraction of the initial total energy. All\nthis is not my idea: it is in a series of papers by Martin Rees,\nPeter Meszaros (sorry for the missing accents:-) and co-workers.\nIt is certainly not a complete model, but it may well be the best one\naround (summing over all proposed distance scales). An alternative\nproposal for what creates the initial fireball, by the way, is the \nso-called 'failed supernovae' scenario by Stan Woosley, in which\na very massive star at the end of its life collapses to a black\nhole. If the stellar core was rotating, part of the infalling matter\nwill be temporarily halted because it is supported by centrifugal\nforce, and form a very dense neutron torus that accretes onto the\nblack hole. This beast may spew out a jet along the rotation axis,\nwhich again constitutes relativistic flow. The rate of such\nevents may be much higher than that of neutron star mergers,\nbut the flux may be more strongly beamed, so that the net rate\nof bursts observed on Earth stays the same between the two\nscenarios, but the energy released per event can be a lot less\nin the failed supernova scenario.\n\nOn another note: I do believe that the distance scale must \nultimately be resolved via some classical astronomical method\nsuch as finding counterparts to the bursts at other wavelengths,\nor finding a definitive signature of some known class of\nobjects in the distribution of positions and fluxes. Theorists\nhave historically not been too successfull in finding the\ndistance of any object by proving that there is only one\npossible way in which the object can work, and therefore\nit *must* be so-and-so.
Dave,\n\n	What i recall from air craft maintence.  Torqque  and safety\nwires or cotters  were more important, then if some bolt\nface were nicked up.  If it was in bad shape you replaced it\nwith another $30,  aircraft grade bolt.  I can see adjustable spanners\neating up profit,  but lives?
Actually, the situation is even worse than that.  The *total mass* of the\nPluto Fast Flyby spacecraft is only 250ish pounds, and most of that is\nsupport equipment like power and communications.  The mass available for\ninstruments is maybe 10% of that.  I don't think a BATSE will fit...\n\nActually, would you need the shielding?  My understanding is that it's\nmostly there to give the detectors some directionality.  No point in\ndoing that if you've only got one.  I'm sure the burst detectors that\nhave flown on other deep-space missions haven't weighed that much.\n(Mind you, they're probably still too heavy -- the PFF people would put\nmore Pluto-specific instruments on first, if they had any mass to spare.)
Even better.  Make up pete conrad in a Martian Suit,\nand have him get ou;t  and throw a football\nto the refs.
.. \n\nAs Ben says - this re-boost idea is all news to us here.  Do you know \nsomething we don't?  Please supply a source - it would be nice for \nthe schedulers of observations to know where the thing is going to \nbe.  These altitude numbers are also way off.  \n\nMy best source has: \n"Minimum ST ALTITUDE in the PMDB is:    573 Kilometers"\n"Maximum ST ALTITUDE in the PMDB is:    603 Kilometers"\n"Delta   ST ALTITUDE in the PMDB is:      3 Kilometers" \n\n(PMDB is Proposal Management Data Base - used to schedule observations.) \n..\n\n\nCould you supply some calculations?  You might check some recent \npostings that explained that 'a small booster' as suggested does \nnot now exist, so comparing the mass of something that doesn't \nexist to the mass of the OMS fuel seems impossible.  The contamination \nthreat also remains.  \n\n.. \n  Longer drag life I can understand, but could you explain the \nantenna pointing?  \n\n\nTell me about it.  Although the arrays can be (and are) moved perfectly \nwell utilizing the second electronics box.  Getting them both working \nis much desireable so as to reclaim redundancy.  \n\n\nI don't mean to jump on you - helpful suggestions are always welcome \nand we all know the more ideas the better, but I do want the true \nsituation to be described clearly and correctly, lest some get \nconfused.
It should be noted that the US benefitted not only from German science and\ntechnology after WW2 but also from British science and technology. From the\ndiscovery and manufacture of penicillin to jet engines, swing wing aircraft,\nthe hovercraft etc etc. all were shipped lock-stick-and-barel across the\nAtlantic. We still are suffering from this sort of thing because of some of the\nmore parochial aspects of US procurement policy. Meiko, a British \nparallel computer company, for example, has now moved most of its facilities to\nthe US since that was the only way it could sell stuff over there.

Often Shuttle lifts satellites with upper stages. Yet we still consider it\npayload. Ten Saturn flights over about 4 years delivered to LEO roughly the\nsame as 50 shuttle flights over 10 years.\n\n\nThey where pretty much the same in terms of cost/pound.

This is not quite right.  The differential arrival time techinique\nrequires interplanetary baselines to get good positions.  The\ndifferential arrival at the eight detectors differ by 10's of nanoseconds.\nThis is smaller than BATSE's microsecond timing capabilities.\nBATSE, Ulysses, and Mars Obsverver are used for this technique.\n\nEach BATSE detector does not have a full sky field of view.\nThe sensitivity of each detector decreases with increasing \nangle of incidence.  The burst position on the sky is determined by\ncomparing the count rates in different detectors.

I didn't want to quote all the stuff that's been said recently, I\njust wanted to add a point.\n\n   The whole question of "a right to a dark sky" revolves around the\ndefinition of a right.  Moral rights and natural rights are all well and\ngood, but as far as I can see, a right is whatever you or someone\nrepresenting you can enforce.  In most civilizations, the government or\nthe church (or both) defines what the rights of the citizens are, and\nthen enforces those rights for them.  Here in the U.S., the constitution\nprovides a "Bill of Rights" from which most if not all legal rights are\nconsidered to derive.  I'm sure that most other countries have\ncomparable documents.  If you can persuade a court that you have a right\nto a dark sky derived in some manner from the Bill of Rights (in the\nU.S.), you can prevent (maybe) these billboards from being launched.  To\nkeep anyone in the world from launching then gets into international law\nand the International Court of Justice (correct name?) in the Hague,\nsomething I know little about.
Indeed so; it's at the extreme limit of what is humanly possible.  It is\npossible only because Mount Everest is at a fairly low latitude:  there\nis a slight equatorial bulge in the atmosphere -- beyond what is induced\nby the Earth's rotation -- thanks to the overall circulation pattern of\nthe atmosphere (air cools at poles and descends, flowing back to equator\nwhere it is warmed and rises), and this helps just enough to make Everest-\nwithout-oxygen feasible.  Only just feasible, mind you:  the guys who did\nit reported hallucinations and other indications of oxygen starvation,\nand probably incurred some permanent brain damage.
Henry, if I read you correctly, you may be asking "If I put a blackbody\nin interstellar space ('disregarding the Sun and nearby large warm objects'),\nwhat termperature will it reach in thermal equilibrium with the ambient\nradiation field?"\n\n   If that's the case, let me point out that interstellar dust and \nmolecules provide many instances of things that are, well, not-too-far\nfrom being blackbodies.  Many different observations, including IRAS\nand COBE, have determined that interstellar dust grain temperatures\ncan range from 40K to 150K.  You might look in a conference proceedings\n"Interstellar Processes", ed. D. J. Hollenbach and H. A. Thronson, Jr.,\npublished in 1987.  Try the articles by Tielens et al., Seab, and \nBlack.\n\n   Inside the disk of the galaxy, the temperature varies quite a bit\nfrom place to place (how close are you to the nearest OB association,\nI would guess).  Outside the galaxy, of course, things aren't so \nvaried.\n\n   I hope this is what you were looking for....
Think for a moment about the technology required to do that.  By \nthe time they could make the Earth's sky look like Las Vegas, \nthe people could afford to go backpacking on the Moon. Round\ntrip costs for 500 kg to the Moon would be about the same as\n5000 kg in a Low Earth "advertising" orbit: Very roughly the\nsame cost as a smallish billboard, therefore. If such ads were\nto become common place, that would have to be a very low price...\n\nThe night sky on a Lunar backpacking trip would still be very \npristine... \n\nThere's always been a problem of having to get \naway from civilization before you can really find "natural"\nscenery. 100 years ago, this usually didn't take a trip\nof over 5 miles. Today, most people would have to go 100 miles\nor more. If we ever get to the point where we have billboards\non orbit, that essentially means that no place on Earth is still\n"wild." While that may or may not be a good thing, the orbital\nbillboards aren't the problem: They are just a symptom of \ngrowing, densely-populated civilization. Banning such ads will\nnot save your view of the night sky, because by the time \nsuch ads could become widespread you will probably have trouble\nfinding a place without street lights, where you can _see_\nthe stars...\n\n \nAn ad on a moon of Jupiter would be rather pointless, since you need\na telescope to see them. However, I'd love to see them get all\nthe publicity they could from underwritting the "Coca Cola Io\nOrbital Mapping Probe."  \n\n\nThey already can, to some extent: The IAU allows names derived from\nsponsors or patrons of scientific research. If Microscum donates\nmoney to a university astronomy program, one of the galactic \nastronomers could easily get a newly discovered galaxy named after\nthem.
Ha!\n\n\nWatch me. It flies. It lands. It gets rebuilt.\n\n\n\nThat's not what they told us back in the '70's.\n\n\n1. It isn't a logical follow-on. A logical follow-on would have\nbeen either a Russian "snowfox" type thingey (for the lifting bodies)\nor something like MMI's Space Van (or Boeing's TSTO, or the airbreathing\nTSTO the military is allegedly _using_ now that probably cost less\nto develop than the shuttle does to fly for a year).\n\n\nKeep that attitude, and it'll be a couple centuries before we get real\naccess to space, unless another country without all that baggage comes\nalong and kicks our ass in the space race.\n\n\nOr NASA HQ. That doesn't give the rest of the program plausible deniability\nif we deceide that it wasn't worth the money we've spent, which is by now\nprobably a lot more than Apollo.\n\n\nYes, but it gets sold on the basis of the political statements.\nYou're saying basically that it met the engineering specs (which is\nquestionable, IMHO) so it's a success, never mind that you couldn't\nget the funding the shuttle eats with those engineering specs in\na thousand years.\n\n\nYou can get hypersonic flight data with an X-15 or a follow-on X-15\ntype vehicle for much less.\n\nAnd economics and engineering are interchangable; engineering in the\nabsense of economics is basically just physics, and in terms of physics,\nthe shuttle looks like a failure next to the X-15.\n\n\n\nHS>Sorry, support that I can arrange for launchers all goes to launchers\nHS>that I have some hope of riding some day.  At the moment, that's\nHS>DC-X's hoped-for successors.\n\n\nThe shuttle program has a bad record. I _once_ had hopes for the\nshuttle program. By now I know those hopes were false. \n\nAll I have for DC-X and similar and dissimilar experimental vehicles\nare hopes. But at least I know they aren't false hopes yet.\n\nI did support the shuttle, way back when. It didn't do nearly what\nit was supposed to. It's time to move on to something that might do\nthe job of orbital delivery better. Or at all.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe don't want to learn how to operate on orbit. It launches, it\nshoves out the payload, it lands. It doesn't waste payload hauling\nup and down EDO pallets and the like.\n\nThe only thing to be learned from shuttle is how *not* to build a\nlauncher.\n\nFinally: that bit about the "proven" shuttle. Are you hoping you can\ntell a lie enough times and get someone to believe it?\n\n\nHow much science and technology could have been done is the money spent\non shuttle had been spent differently?\n\n...\n\nLearn about economics and the current budget realities in the United States,\nplease.

Well, I agree.  I hope others chime in with suggestions on specific\ntechnologies which could be applied towards the maintenance of an\nEarth like atmosphere on a long-duration spacecraft.\n\nTim et al:\nI think we should try looking at atmosphere first.\nThis seems to be the single most fundamental issue in keeping anyone alive.\nWe're all taught that when supporting a patient\nyou look for maintaining airway. So, in keeping with my trauma training\n(and keeping my emergency medicine professor happy), I suggest that\nwe look at the issues surrounding a regenerable atmospheric circuit.\n\nHowz that Tim?

About three weeks ago on the SPACE list, someone was quoting a source on the\nrelative traffic and rankings of this listserv.  A figure of 88th in\ntraffic(?) was given.  Unfortunately I did not clip the message and I would\nlike to know the source of the rankings list.  If anybody still has that\ndiscussion on their disk or knows the source (or is the poster himself!)\nI'd appreciate getting that reference.  Being on the road I have temporarily\nunsubscribed to the list to cut down mail box stuffing <g> so please reply\nvia e-mail to lek@aip.org OR 71160.2356@compuserve.com or I won't get your\nanswer!
I disagree.  It think the average joe is interested/curious about spaceflight\nbut sees it as an elitist activity.  Not one which he is ever going to\nparticipate in.\n\n\nWhy is the general public going to be interested in the technical details\nof long term space habitation?  I like the idea of the study, but it should\nbe released to other scientists and engineers who will be able to use it.\nIf you want a general public document, you'll need a more general publication.\n\n\nAs one working on Controlled Ecological Life Support Systems, engineering\nthe microworld isn't the problem.  The problem is understanding the basic\nchemical, biological and medical factors to be able to engineer them\nefficiently.  For example, the only way we know how to produce food is from\nplants and animals.  Food synthesis is not very far advanced.  So we have\nto orbit a farm.  Well that's obviously not very efficient, so we use \ntechnology to reduce the mass and grow plants hydroponically instead of \nusing dirt.  This is where the engineering comes in.  But new technologies\nbring new basic questions that we don't have the answers to.  Like, in \ndirt we can grow tomatoes and lettuce right beside each other, but in \nhydroponics it turns out that you can't do that.  The lettuce growth is \nstunted when it's grown in the same hydroponic solution as tomatoes.  So \nnow you have to consider what other plants are going to have similar\ninteractions.  This means some basic applied scientific research.  And that's\nwhat needs to be done with all technologies that have been developed so far.\nWe also need to find out how they interact together.  That's where we are now.\n\n\nFirst you need to do the literature search.  There is a lot of information\nout there.  Maybe we should just pick a specific area of long term habitation.\nThis could be useful, especially if we make it available on the net.  Then\nwe can look at methods of analyzing the technologies.\n\n\nUnless there is an unbelievable outpouring of interest on this on the net,\nI think we should develop a detailed data base of the literature search \nfirst.  Then if we accomplish that we can go on to real analysis.  The data\nbase itself could be useful for future engineers.\n\nThat's my response Ken, what do you think?
Or how about:\n    "End light pollution now!!"\n\nYour banner would have no effect on its subject, but my banner would.
Why can't an aircraft be designed so that the pilot can always be \nmaintained in a upright position, perpendicular to the plane of\nacceleration?  With the visual helmets now being used that display\nsome of the flight parameters and with a keyboard and manuvering\nequipment moving with the pilot, a pilot may be able to function at\naccelerations in excess of 12G.  Is anyone currently pursuing this\narea or is there a reason why this is impossible at the present time?
I do not understand what you are saying here.  What is improved, what \nis Significant, and what does this have to do with carrying more \nequipment on a servicing mission?  Also, as implied by other posters, why \ndo you need to boost the orbit on this mission anyway?  Maybe you have \nsomething here, but could you please clarify it for us on the net? \n\n\nFrom what I've heard, the motors are fine - it is one of the two \nsets of electronics that control the motors that needs a fix.  The \nmotors and electronics are separate pieces of hardware.  I expect \nto be corrected if I'm wrong on this.
Sure about that? Maybe Proxima might cause problems, but at Oort\nCloud distances AC a and AC b together look like a point source.\n\nBesides, even the solar system's Oort cloud is unstable over\ngeologic time, right, and needs to be replentished from somewhere\nelse, like the short period comets of the Kupier Belt?\n\n(Or maybe I'm misremembering something I read or heard somewhere...)\n\n\nUntil we're able to perform a broad-band survey of nearby stars\nto detect planets, we won't know enough to say whether or not\na single star has planets. And we're likely to find out about the\nclose ones first.\n\nHeck, if neutron stars can have planets, anything can have planets.\n(Or was that discovery disconfirmed?)
Could someone please help me. I am trying to find the \naddress to the TDRS receiving station at White Sands\nMissile Range. I am interested in possible employment\nand would like to write for information.

How difficult would it be to do a solar sail mission to say mercury?\n\nNot much has been there and there is a 23?KM/s delta v to eat off.\n\ncould a  solar sail, handle say adiscovery bus, and drop it into\nmercury orbit,  good enough for rockets to put it into some\nform of polar orbit?
You don't *need* to, but it's desirable.  HST, like all satellites in\nlow Earth orbit, is gradually losing altitude due to air drag.  It was\ndeployed in the highest orbit the shuttle could reach, for that reason.\nIt needs occasional reboosting or it will eventually reenter.  (It has\nno propulsion system of its own.)  This is an excellent opportunity,\ngiven that there may not be another visit for several years.
My comment was off the top of my head; I wasn't aware that it had\nalready been thought of.  Guess it's true that there's nothing new under\nthe sun (or in this case, the flying billboards.)\n\n\n--

Ancient astronomers observed points of\nlight that appeared to move among the stars. They called these\nobjects planets, meaning wanderers, and named them after Roman\ndeities -- Jupiter, king of the gods; Mars, the god of war;\nMercury, messenger of the gods; Venus, the god of love and\nbeauty, and Saturn, father of Jupiter and god of agriculture. The\nstargazers also observed comets with sparkling tails, and meteors\nor shooting stars apparently falling from the sky.\n\n     Science flourished during the European Renaissance.\nFundamental physical laws governing planetary motion were\ndiscovered, and the orbits of the planets around the Sun were\ncalculated. In the 17th century, astronomers pointed a new device\ncalled the telescope at the heavens and made startling\ndiscoveries.\n\n     But the years since 1959 have amounted to a golden age of\nsolar system exploration. Advancements in rocketry after World\nWar II enabled our machines to break the grip of Earth's gravity\nand travel to the Moon and to other planets.\n\n     The United States has sent automated spacecraft, then\nhuman-crewed expeditions, to explore the Moon. Our automated\nmachines have orbited and landed on Venus and Mars; explored the\nSun's environment; observed comets, and made close-range surveys\nwhile flying past Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.\n\n     These travelers brought a quantum leap in our knowledge and\nunderstanding of the solar system. Through the electronic sight\nand other "senses" of our automated spacecraft, color and\ncomplexion have been given to worlds that for centuries appeared\nto Earth-bound eyes as fuzzy disks or indistinct points of light.\nAnd dozens of previously unknown objects have been discovered.\n\n     Future historians will likely view these pioneering flights\nthrough the solar system as some of the most remarkable\nachievements of the 20th century.\n     \n\nAUTOMATED SPACECRAFT\n\n     The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's)\nautomated spacecraft for solar system exploration come in many\nshapes and sizes. While they are designed to fulfill separate and\nspecific mission objectives, the craft share much in common.\n\n     Each spacecraft consists of various scientific instruments\nselected for a particular mission, supported by basic subsystems\nfor electrical power, trajectory and orientation control, as well\nas for processing data and communicating with Earth.\n\n     Electrical power is required to operate the spacecraft\ninstruments and systems. NASA uses both solar energy from arrays\nof photovoltaic cells and small nuclear generators to power its\nsolar system missions. Rechargeable batteries are employed for\nbackup and supplemental power.\n\n     Imagine that a spacecraft has successfully journeyed\nmillions of miles through space to fly but one time near a\nplanet, only to have its cameras and other sensing instruments\npointed the wrong way as it speeds past the target! To help\nprevent such a mishap, a subsystem of small thrusters is used to\ncontrol spacecraft.\n\n     The thrusters are linked with devices that maintain a\nconstant gaze at selected stars. Just as Earth's early seafarers\nused the stars to navigate the oceans, spacecraft use stars to\nmaintain their bearings in space. With the subsystem locked onto\nfixed points of reference, flight controllers can keep a\nspacecraft's scientific instruments pointed at the target body\nand the craft's communications antennas pointed toward Earth. The\nthrusters can also be used to fine-tune the flight path and speed\nof the spacecraft to ensure that a target body is encountered at\nthe planned distance and on the proper trajectory.\n\n     Between 1959 and 1971, NASA spacecraft were dispatched to\nstudy the Moon and the solar environment; they also scanned the\ninner planets other than Earth -- Mercury, Venus and Mars. These\nthree worlds, and our own, are known as the terrestrial planets\nbecause they share a solid-rock composition.\n\n     For the early planetary reconnaissance missions, NASA\nemployed a highly successful series of spacecraft called the\nMariners. Their flights helped shape the planning of later\nmissions. Between 1962 and 1975, seven Mariner missions conducted\nthe first surveys of our planetary neighbors in space.\n\n     All of the Mariners used solar panels as their primary power\nsource. The first and the final versions of the spacecraft had\ntwo wings covered with photovoltaic cells. Other Mariners were\nequipped with four solar panels extending from their octagonal\nbodies.\n\n     Although the Mariners ranged from the Mariner 2 Venus\nspacecraft, weighing in at 203 kilograms (447 pounds), to the\nMariner 9 Mars Orbiter, weighing in at 974 kilograms (2,147\npounds), their basic design remained quite similar throughout the\nprogram. The Mariner 5 Venus spacecraft, for example, had\noriginally been a backup for the Mariner 4 Mars flyby. The\nMariner 10 spacecraft sent to Venus and Mercury used components\nleft over from the Mariner 9 Mars Orbiter program.\n\n     In 1972, NASA launched Pioneer 10, a Jupiter spacecraft.\nInterest was shifting to four of the outer planets -- Jupiter,\nSaturn, Uranus and Neptune -- giant balls of dense gas quite\ndifferent from the terrestrial worlds we had already surveyed.\n\n     Four NASA spacecraft in all -- two Pioneers and two Voyagers\n-- were sent in the 1970s to tour the outer regions of our solar\nsystem. Because of the distances involved, these travelers took\nanywhere from 20 months to 12 years to reach their destinations.\nBarring faster spacecraft, they will eventually become the first\nhuman artifacts to journey to distant stars. Because the Sun's\nlight becomes so faint in the outer solar system, these travelers\ndo not use solar power but instead operate on electricity\ngenerated by heat from the decay of radioisotopes.\n\n     NASA also developed highly specialized spacecraft to revisit\nour neighbors Mars and Venus in the middle and late 1970s. Twin\nViking Landers were equipped to serve as seismic and weather\nstations and as biology laboratories. Two advanced orbiters --\ndescendants of the Mariner craft -- carried the Viking Landers\nfrom Earth and then studied martian features from above.\n\n     Two drum-shaped Pioneer spacecraft visited Venus in 1978.\nThe Pioneer Venus Orbiter was equipped with a radar instrument\nthat allowed it to "see" through the planet's dense cloud cover\nto study surface features. The Pioneer Venus Multiprobe carried\nfour probes that were dropped through the clouds. The probes and\nthe main body -- all of which contained scientific instruments --\nradioed information about the planet's atmosphere during their\ndescent toward the surface.\n\n     A new generation of automated spacecraft -- including\nMagellan, Galileo, Ulysses, Mars Observer, the Comet\nRendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini -- is being\ndeveloped and sent out into the solar system to make detailed\nexaminations that will increase our understanding of our\nneighborhood and our own planet.\n     \n\nThe Sun\n\n     A discussion of the objects in the solar system must start\nwith the Sun. The Sun dwarfs the other bodies, representing\napproximately 99.86 percent of all the mass in the solar system;\nall of the planets, moons, asteroids, comets, dust and gas add up\nto only about 0.14 percent. This 0.14 percent represents the\nmaterial left over from the Sun's formation. One hundred and nine\nEarths would be required to fit across the Sun's disk, and its\ninterior could hold over 1.3 million Earths.\n\n     As a star, the Sun generates energy through the process of\nfusion. The temperature at the Sun's core is 15 million degrees\nCelsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit), and the pressure there\nis 340 billion times Earth's air pressure at sea level. The Sun's\nsurface temperature of 5,500 degrees Celsius (10,000 degrees\nFahrenheit) seems almost chilly compared to its core-temperature.\nAt the solar core, hydrogen can fuse into helium, producing\nenergy. The Sun also produces a strong magnetic field and streams\nof charged particles, both extending far beyond the planets.\n\n     The Sun appears to have been active for 4.6 billion years\nand has enough fuel to go on for another five billion years or\nso. At the end of its life, the Sun will start to fuse helium\ninto heavier elements and begin to swell up, ultimately growing\nso large that it will swallow Earth. After a billion years as a\n"red giant," it will suddenly collapse into a "white dwarf" --\nthe final end product of a star like ours. It may take a trillion\nyears to cool off completely.\n\n     Many spacecraft have explored the Sun's environment, but\nnone have gotten any closer to its surface than approximately\ntwo-thirds of the distance from Earth to the Sun. Pioneers 5-11,\nthe Pioneer Venus Orbiter, Voyagers 1 and 2 and other spacecraft\nhave all sampled the solar environment. The Ulysses spacecraft,\nlaunched on October 6, 1990, is a joint solar mission of NASA and\nthe European Space Agency. After using Jupiter's gravity to\nchange its trajectory, Ulysses will fly over the Sun's polar\nregions during 1994 and 1995 and will perform a wide range of\nstudies using nine onboard scientific instruments.\n\n     We are fortunate that the Sun is exactly the way it is. If\nit were different in almost any way, life would almost certainly\nnever have developed on Earth.\n     \n\nMercury\n\n     Obtaining the first close-up views of Mercury was the\nprimary objective of the Mariner 10 spacecraft, launched on\nNovember 3, 1973, from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. After a\njourney of nearly five months, which included a flyby of Venus,\nthe spacecraft passed within 703 kilometers (437 miles) of the\nsolar system's innermost planet on March 29, 1974.\n\n     Until Mariner 10, little was known about Mercury. Even the\nbest telescopic views from Earth showed Mercury as an indistinct\nobject lacking any surface detail. The planet is so close to the\nSun that it is usually lost in solar glare. When the planet is\nvisible on Earth's horizon just after sunset or before dawn, it\nis obscured by the haze and dust in our atmosphere. Only radar\ntelescopes gave any hint of Mercury's surface conditions prior to\nthe voyage of Mariner 10.\n\n     The photographs Mariner 10 radioed back to Earth revealed an\nancient, heavily cratered surface, closely resembling our own\nMoon. The pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing the\nplanet. These apparently were created when Mercury's interior\ncooled and shrank, buckling the planet's crust. The cliffs are as\nhigh as 3 kilometers (2 miles) and as long as 500 kilometers (310\nmiles).\n\n     Instruments on Mariner 10 discovered that Mercury has a weak\nmagnetic field and a trace of atmosphere -- a trillionth the\ndensity of Earth's atmosphere and composed chiefly of argon, neon\nand helium. When the planet's orbit takes it closest to the Sun,\nsurface temperatures range from 467 degrees Celsius (872 degrees\nFahrenheit) on Mercury's sunlit side to -183 degrees Celsius\n(-298 degrees Fahrenheit) on the dark side. This range in surface\ntemperature -- 650 degrees Celsius (1,170 degrees Fahrenheit) --\nis the largest for a single body in the solar system. Mercury\nliterally bakes and freezes at the same time.\n\n     Days and nights are long on Mercury. The combination of a\nslow rotation relative to the stars (59 Earth days) and a rapid\nrevolution around the Sun (88 Earth days) means that one Mercury\nsolar day takes 176 Earth days or two Mercury years -- the time\nit takes the innermost planet to complete two orbits around the\nSun! \n\n     Mercury appears to have a crust of light silicate rock like\nthat of Earth. Scientists believe Mercury has a heavy iron-rich\ncore making up slightly less than half of its volume. That would\nmake Mercury's core larger, proportionally, than the Moon's core\nor those of any of the planets.\n\n     After the initial Mercury encounter, Mariner 10 made two\nadditional flybys -- on September 21, 1974, and March 16, 1975 --\nbefore control gas used to orient the spacecraft was exhausted\nand the mission was concluded. Each flyby took place at the same\nlocal Mercury time when the identical half of the planet was\nilluminated; as a result, we still have not seen one-half of the\nplanet's surface.\n     \n\nVenus\n\n     Veiled by dense cloud cover, Venus -- our nearest planetary\nneighbor -- was the first planet to be explored. The Mariner 2\nspacecraft, launched on August 27, 1962, was the first of more\nthan a dozen successful American and Soviet missions to study the\nmysterious planet. As spacecraft flew by or orbited Venus,\nplunged into the atmosphere or gently landed on Venus' surface,\nromantic myths and speculations about our neighbor were laid to\nrest.\n\n     On December 14, 1962, Mariner 2 passed within 34,839\nkilometers (21,648 miles) of Venus and became the first\nspacecraft to scan another planet; onboard instruments measured\nVenus for 42 minutes. Mariner 5, launched in June 1967, flew much\ncloser to the planet. Passing within 4,094 kilometers (2,544\nmiles) of Venus on the second American flyby, Mariner 5's\ninstruments measured the planet's magnetic field, ionosphere,\nradiation belts and temperatures. On its way to Mercury, Mariner\n10 flew by Venus and transmitted ultraviolet pictures to Earth\nshowing cloud circulation patterns in the Venusian atmosphere.\n\n     In the spring and summer of 1978, two spacecraft were\nlaunched to further unravel the mysteries of Venus. On December 4\nof the same year, the Pioneer Venus Orbiter became the first\nspacecraft placed in orbit around the planet.\n\n     Five days later, the five separate components making up the\nsecond spacecraft -- the Pioneer Venus Multiprobe -- entered the\nVenusian atmosphere at different locations above the planet. The\nfour small, independent probes and the main body radioed\natmospheric data back to Earth during their descent toward the\nsurface. Although designed to examine the atmosphere, one of the\nprobes survived its impact with the surface and continued to\ntransmit data for another hour.\n\n     Venus resembles Earth in size, physical composition and\ndensity more closely than any other known planet. However,\nspacecraft have discovered significant differences as well. For\nexample, Venus' rotation (west to east) is retrograde (backward)\ncompared to the east-to-west spin of Earth and most of the other\nplanets.\n\n     Approximately 96.5 percent of Venus' atmosphere (95 times as\ndense as Earth's) is carbon dioxide. The principal constituent of\nEarth's atmosphere is nitrogen. Venus' atmosphere acts like a\ngreenhouse, permitting solar radiation to reach the surface but\ntrapping the heat that would ordinarily be radiated back into\nspace. As a result, the planet's average surface temperature is\n482 degrees Celsius (900 degrees Fahrenheit), hot enough to melt\nlead.\n\n     A radio altimeter on the Pioneer Venus Orbiter provided the\nfirst means of seeing through the planet's dense cloud cover and\ndetermining surface features over almost the entire planet.\nNASA's Magellan spacecraft, launched on May 5, 1989, has been in\norbit around Venus since August 10, 1990. The spacecraft uses\nradar-mapping techniques to provide ultrahigh-resolution images\nof the surface.\n\n     Magellan has revealed a landscape dominated by volcanic\nfeatures, faults and impact craters. Huge areas of the surface\nshow evidence of multiple periods of lava flooding with flows\nlying on top of previous ones. An elevated region named Ishtar\nTerra is a lava-filled basin as large as the United States. At\none end of this plateau sits Maxwell Montes, a mountain the size\nof Mount Everest. Scarring the mountain's flank is a\n100-kilometer (62-mile) wide, 2.5-kilometer (1.5-mile) deep\nimpact crater named Cleopatra. (Almost all features on Venus are\nnamed for women; Maxwell Montes, Alpha Regio and Beta Regio are\nthe exceptions.) Craters survive on Venus for perhaps 400 million\nyears because there is no water and very little wind erosion.\n\n     Extensive fault-line networks cover the planet, probably the\nresult of the same crustal flexing that produces plate tectonics\non Earth. But on Venus the surface temperature is sufficient to\nweaken the rock, which cracks just about everywhere, preventing\nthe formation of major plates and large earthquake faults like\nthe San Andreas Fault in California.\n\n     Venus' predominant weather pattern is a high-altitude,\nhigh-speed circulation of clouds that contain sulfuric acid. At\nspeeds reaching as high as 360 kilometers (225 miles) per hour,\nthe clouds circle the planet in only four Earth days. The\ncirculation is in the same direction -- west to east -- as Venus'\nslow rotation of 243 Earth days, whereas Earth's winds blow in\nboth directions -- west to east and east to west -- in six\nalternating bands. Venus' atmosphere serves as a simplified\nlaboratory for the study of our weather.\n     \n\nEarth\n\n     As viewed from space, our world's distinguishing\ncharacteristics are its blue waters, brown and green land masses\nand white clouds. We are enveloped by an ocean of air consisting\nof 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other\nconstituents. The only planet in the solar system known to harbor\nlife, Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of 150 million\nkilometers (93 million miles). Earth is the third planet from the\nSun and the fifth largest in the solar system, with a diameter\njust a few hundred kilometers larger than that of Venus.\n\n     Our planet's rapid spin and molten nickel-iron core give\nrise to an extensive magnetic field, which, along with the\natmosphere, shields us from nearly all of the harmful radiation\ncoming from the Sun and other stars. Earth's atmosphere protects\nus from meteors as well, most of which burn up before they can\nstrike the surface. Active geological processes have left no\nevidence of the pelting Earth almost certainly received soon\nafter it formed -- about 4.6 billion years ago. Along with the\nother newly formed planets, it was showered by space debris in\nthe early days of the solar system.\n\n     From our journeys into space, we have learned much about our\nhome planet. The first American satellite -- Explorer 1 -- was\nlaunched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on January 31, 1958, and\ndiscovered an intense radiation zone, now called the Van Allen\nradiation belts, surrounding Earth.\n\n     Since then, other research satellites have revealed that our\nplanet's magnetic field is distorted into a tear-drop shape by\nthe solar wind -- the stream of charged particles continuously\nejected from the Sun. We've learned that the magnetic field does\nnot fade off into space but has definite boundaries. And we now\nknow that our wispy upper atmosphere, once believed calm and\nuneventful, seethes with activity -- swelling by day and\ncontracting by night. Affected by changes in solar activity, the\nupper atmosphere contributes to weather and climate on Earth.\n\n     Besides affecting Earth's weather, solar activity gives rise\nto a dramatic visual phenomenon in our atmosphere. When charged\nparticles from the solar wind become trapped in Earth's magnetic\nfield, they collide with air molecules above our planet's\nmagnetic poles. These air molecules then begin to glow and are\nknown as the auroras or the northern and southern lights.\n\n     Satellites about 35,789 kilometers (22,238 miles) out in\nspace play a major role in daily local weather forecasting. These\nwatchful electronic eyes warn us of dangerous storms. Continuous\nglobal monitoring provides a vast amount of useful data and\ncontributes to a better understanding of Earth's complex weather\nsystems.\n\n     From their unique vantage points, satellites can survey\nEarth's oceans, land use and resources, and monitor the planet's\nhealth. These eyes in space have saved countless lives, provided\ntremendous conveniences and shown us that we may be altering our\nplanet in dangerous ways.\n     \n\nThe Moon\n\n     The Moon is Earth's single natural satellite. The first\nhuman footsteps on an alien world were made by American\nastronauts on the dusty surface of our airless, lifeless\ncompanion. In preparation for the human-crewed Apollo\nexpeditions, NASA dispatched the automated Ranger, Surveyor and\nLunar Orbiter spacecraft to study the Moon between 1964 and 1968.\n\n     NASA's Apollo program left a large legacy of lunar materials\nand data. Six two-astronaut crews landed on and explored the\nlunar surface between 1969 and 1972, carrying back a collection\nof rocks and soil weighing a total of 382 kilograms (842 pounds)\nand consisting of more than 2,000 separate samples.\n\n     From this material and other studies, scientists have\nconstructed a history of the Moon that includes its infancy.\nRocks collected from the lunar highlands date to about 4.0-4.3\nbillion years old. The first few million years of the Moon's\nexistence were so violent that few traces of this period remain.\nAs a molten outer layer gradually cooled and solidified into\ndifferent kinds of rock, the Moon was bombarded by huge asteroids\nand smaller objects. Some of the asteroids were as large as Rhode\nIsland or Delaware, and their collisions with the Moon created\nbasins hundreds of kilometers across.\n\n     This catastrophic bombardment tapered off approximately four\nbillion years ago, leaving the lunar highlands covered with huge,\noverlapping craters and a deep layer of shattered and broken\nrock. Heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements began to\nmelt the interior of the Moon at depths of about 200 kilometers\n(125 miles) below the surface. Then, for the next 700 million\nyears -- from about 3.8 to 3.1 billion years ago -- lava rose\nfrom inside the Moon. The lava gradually spread out over the\nsurface, flooding the large impact basins to form the dark areas\nthat Galileo Galilei, an astronomer of the Italian Renaissance,\ncalled maria, meaning seas.\n\n     As far as we can tell, there has been no significant\nvolcanic activity on the Moon for more than three billion years.\nSince then, the lunar surface has been altered only by\nmicrometeorites, by the atomic particles from the Sun and stars,\nby the rare impacts of large meteorites and by spacecraft and\nastronauts. If our astronauts had landed on the Moon a billion\nyears ago, they would have seen a landscape very similar to the\none today. Thousands of years from now, the footsteps left by the\nApollo crews will remain sharp and clear.\n\n     The origin of the Moon is still a mystery. Four theories\nattempt an explanation: the Moon formed near Earth as a separate\nbody; it was torn from Earth; it formed somewhere else and was\ncaptured by our planet's gravity, or it was the result of a\ncollision between Earth and an asteroid about the size of Mars.\nThe last theory has some good support but is far from certain.\n     \n\nMars\n\n     Of all the planets, Mars has long been considered the solar\nsystem's prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life.\nAstronomers studying the red planet through telescopes saw what\nappeared to be straight lines crisscrossing its surface. These\nobservations -- later determined to be optical illusions -- led\nto the popular notion that intelligent beings had constructed a\nsystem of irrigation canals on the planet. In 1938, when Orson\nWelles broadcast a radio drama based on the science fiction\nclassic War of the Worlds  by H.G. Wells, enough people believed\nin the tale of invading martians to cause a near panic.\n\n     Another reason for scientists to expect life on Mars had to\ndo with the apparent seasonal color changes on the planet's\nsurface. This phenomenon led to speculation that conditions might\nsupport a bloom of martian vegetation during the warmer months\nand cause plant life to become dormant during colder periods.\n\n     So far, six American missions to Mars have been carried out.\nFour Mariner spacecraft -- three flying by the planet and one\nplaced into martian orbit -- surveyed the planet extensively\nbefore the Viking Orbiters and Landers arrived.\n\n     Mariner 4, launched in late 1964, flew past Mars on July 14,\n1965, coming within 9,846 kilometers (6,118 miles) of the\nsurface. Transmitting to Earth 22 close-up pictures of the\nplanet, the spacecraft found many craters and naturally occurring\nchannels but no evidence of artificial canals or flowing water.\nMariners 6 and 7 followed with their flybys during the summer of\n1969 and returned 201 pictures. Mariners 4, 6 and 7 showed a\ndiversity of surface conditions as well as a thin, cold, dry\natmosphere of carbon dioxide.\n\n     On May 30, 1971, the Mariner 9 Orbiter was launched on a\nmission to make a year-long study of the martian surface. The\nspacecraft arrived five and a half months after lift-off, only to\nfind Mars in the midst of a planet-wide dust storm that made\nsurface photography impossible for several weeks. But after the\nstorm cleared, Mariner 9 began returning the first of 7,329\npictures; these revealed previously unknown martian features,\nincluding evidence that large amounts of water once flowed across\nthe surface, etching river valleys and flood plains.\n\n     In August and September 1975, the Viking 1 and 2 spacecraft\n-- each consisting of an orbiter and a lander -- lifted off from\nKennedy Space Center. The mission was designed to answer several\nquestions about the red planet, including, Is there life there?\nNobody expected the spacecraft to spot martian cities, but it was\nhoped that the biology experiments on the Viking Landers would at\nleast find evidence of primitive life -- past or present.\n\n     Viking Lander 1 became the first spacecraft to successfully\ntouch down on another planet when it landed on July 20, 1976,\nwhile the United States was celebrating its Bicentennial. Photos\nsent back from the Chryse Planitia ("Plains of Gold") showed a\nbleak, rusty-red landscape. Panoramic images returned by the\nlander revealed a rolling plain, littered with rocks and marked\nby rippled sand dunes. Fine red dust from the martian soil gives\nthe sky a salmon hue. When Viking Lander 2 touched down on Utopia\nPlanitia on September 3, 1976, it viewed a more rolling landscape\nthan the one seen by its predecessor -- one without visible\ndunes.\n\n     The results sent back by the laboratory on each Viking\nLander were inconclusive. Small samples of the red martian soil\nwere tested in three different experiments designed to detect\nbiological processes. While some of the test results seemed to\nindicate biological activity, later analysis confirmed that this\nactivity was inorganic in nature and related to the planet's soil\nchemistry. Is there life on Mars? No one knows for sure, but the\nViking mission found no evidence that organic molecules exist\nthere.\n\n     The Viking Landers became weather stations, recording wind\nvelocity and direction as well as atmospheric temperature and\npressure. Few weather changes were observed. The highest\ntemperature recorded by either craft was -14 degrees Celsius (7\ndegrees Fahrenheit) at the Viking Lander 1 site in midsummer.\n\n     The lowest temperature, -120 degrees Celsius (-184 degrees\nFahrenheit), was recorded at the more northerly Viking Lander 2\nsite during winter. Near-hurricane wind speeds were measured at\nthe two martian weather stations during global dust storms, but\nbecause the atmosphere is so thin, wind force is minimal. Viking\nLander 2 photographed light patches of frost -- probably\nwater-ice -- during its second winter on the planet.\n\n     The martian atmosphere, like that of Venus, is primarily\ncarbon dioxide. Nitrogen and oxygen are present only in small\npercentages. Martian air contains only about 1/1,000 as much\nwater as our air, but even this small amount can condense out,\nforming clouds that ride high in the atmosphere or swirl around\nthe slopes of towering volcanoes. Local patches of early morning\nfog can form in valleys.\n\n     There is evidence that in the past a denser martian\natmosphere may have allowed water to flow on the planet. Physical\nfeatures closely resembling shorelines, gorges, riverbeds and\nislands suggest that great rivers once marked the planet.\n\n     Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos. They are small and\nirregularly shaped and possess ancient, cratered surfaces. It is\npossible the moons were originally asteroids that ventured too\nclose to Mars and were captured by its gravity.\n\n     The Viking Orbiters and Landers exceeded by large margins\ntheir design lifetimes of 120 and 90 days, respectively. The\nfirst to fail was Viking Orbiter 2, which stopped operating on\nJuly 24, 1978, when a leak depleted its attitude-control gas.\nViking Lander 2 operated until April 12, 1980, when it was shut\ndown because of battery degeneration. Viking Orbiter 1 quit on\nAugust 7, 1980, when the last of its attitude-control gas was\nused up. Viking Lander 1 ceased functioning on November 13, 1983.\n\n     Despite the inconclusive results of the Viking biology\nexperiments, we know more about Mars than any other planet except\nEarth. NASA's Mars Observer spacecraft, to be launched in\nSeptember 1992, will expand our knowledge of the martian\nenvironment and lead to human exploration of the red planet. \n     \n\nAsteroids\n\n     The solar system has a large number of rocky and metallic\nobjects that are in orbit around the Sun but are too small to be\nconsidered full-fledged planets. These objects are known as\nasteroids or minor planets. Most, but not all, are found in a\nband or belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Some have\norbits that cross Earth's path, and there is evidence that Earth\nhas been hit by asteroids in the past. One of the least eroded,\nbest preserved examples is the Barringer Meteor Crater near\nWinslow, Arizona.\n\n     Asteroids are material left over from the formation of the\nsolar system. One theory suggests that they are the remains of a\nplanet that was destroyed in a massive collision long ago. More\nlikely, asteroids are material that never coalesced into a\nplanet. In fact, if the estimated total mass of all asteroids was\ngathered into a single object, the object would be only about\n1,500 kilometers (932 miles) across -- less than half the\ndiameter of our Moon. \n\n     Thousands of asteroids have been identified from Earth. It\nis estimated that 100,000 are bright enough to eventually be\nphotographed through Earth-based telescopes.\n\n     Much of our understanding about asteroids comes from\nexamining pieces of space debris that fall to the surface of\nEarth. Asteroids that are on a collision course with Earth are\ncalled meteoroids. When a meteoroid strikes our atmosphere at\nhigh velocity, friction causes this chunk of space matter to\nincinerate in a streak of light known as a meteor. If the\nmeteoroid does not burn up completely, what's left strikes\nEarth's surface and is called a meteorite. One of the best places\nto look for meteorites is the ice cap of Antarctica.\n\n     Of all the meteorites examined, 92.8 percent are composed of\nsilicate (stone), and 5.7 percent are composed of iron and\nnickel; the rest are a mixture of the three materials. Stony\nmeteorites are the hardest to identify since they look very much\nlike terrestrial rocks.\n\n     Since asteroids are material from the very early solar\nsystem, scientists are interested in their composition.\nSpacecraft that have flown through the asteroid belt have found\nthat the belt is really quite empty and that asteroids are\nseparated by very large distances.\n\n     Current and future missions will fly by selected asteroids\nfor closer examination. The Galileo Orbiter, launched by NASA in\nOctober 1989, will investigate main-belt asteroids on its way to\nJupiter. The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini\nmissions will also study these far-flung objects. Scheduled for\nlaunch in the latter part of the 1990s, the CRAF and Cassini\nmissions are a collaborative project of NASA, the European Space\nAgency and the federal space agencies of Germany and Italy, as\nwell as the United States Air Force and the Department of Energy.\nOne day, space factories will mine the asteroids for raw\nmaterials.\n     \n\nJupiter\n\n     Beyond Mars and the asteroid belt, in the outer regions of\nour solar system, lie the giant planets of Jupiter, Saturn,\nUranus and Neptune. In 1972, NASA dispatched the first of four\nspacecraft slated to conduct the initial surveys of these\ncolossal worlds of gas and their moons of ice and rock. Jupiter\nwas the first port of call.\n\n     Pioneer 10, which lifted off from Kennedy Space Center in\nMarch 1972, was the first spacecraft to penetrate the asteroid\nbelt and travel to the outer regions of the solar system. In\nDecember 1973, it returned the first close-up images of Jupiter,\nflying within 132,252 kilometers (82,178 miles) of the planet's\nbanded cloud tops. Pioneer 11 followed a year later. Voyagers 1\nand 2 were launched in the summer of 1977 and returned\nspectacular photographs of Jupiter and its family of satellites\nduring flybys in 1979.\n\n     These travelers found Jupiter to be a whirling ball of\nliquid hydrogen and helium, topped with a colorful atmosphere\ncomposed mostly of gaseous hydrogen and helium. Ammonia ice\ncrystals form white Jovian clouds. Sulfur compounds (and perhaps\nphosphorus) may produce the brown and orange hues that\ncharacterize Jupiter's atmosphere.\n\n     It is likely that methane, ammonia, water and other gases\nreact to form organic molecules in the regions between the\nplanet's frigid cloud tops and the warmer hydrogen ocean lying\nbelow. Because of Jupiter's atmospheric dynamics, however, these\norganic compounds -- if they exist -- are probably short-lived.\n\n     The Great Red Spot has been observed for centuries through\ntelescopes on Earth. This hurricane-like storm in Jupiter's\natmosphere is more than twice the size of our planet. As a\nhigh-pressure region, the Great Red Spot spins in a direction\nopposite to that of low-pressure storms on Jupiter; it is\nsurrounded by swirling currents that rotate around the spot and\nare sometimes consumed by it. The Great Red Spot might be a\nmillion years old.\n\n     Our spacecraft detected lightning in Jupiter's upper\natmosphere and observed auroral emissions similar to Earth's\nnorthern lights at the Jovian polar regions. Voyager 1 returned\nthe first images of a faint, narrow ring encircling Jupiter.\n\n     Largest of the solar system's planets, Jupiter rotates at a\ndizzying pace -- once every 9 hours 55 minutes 30 seconds. The\nmassive planet takes almost 12 Earth years to complete a journey\naround the Sun. With 16 known moons, Jupiter is something of a\nminiature solar system.\n\n     A new mission to Jupiter -- the Galileo Project -- is under\nway. After a six- year cruise that takes the Galileo Orbiter once\npast Venus, twice past Earth and the Moon and once past two\nasteroids, the spacecraft will drop an atmospheric probe into\nJupiter's cloud layers and relay data back to Earth. The Galileo\nOrbiter will spend two years circling the planet and flying close\nto Jupiter's large moons, exploring in detail what the two\nPioneers and two Voyagers revealed.\n     \n\nGalilean Satellites\n\n     In 1610, Galileo Galilei aimed his telescope at Jupiter and\nspotted four points of light orbiting the planet. For the first\ntime, humans had seen the moons of another world. In honor of\ntheir discoverer, these four bodies would become known as the\nGalilean satellites or moons. But Galileo might have happily\ntraded this honor for one look at the dazzling photographs\nreturned by the Voyager spacecraft as they flew past these\nplanet-sized satellites.\n\n     One of the most remarkable findings of the Voyager mission\nwas the presence of active volcanoes on the Galilean moon Io.\nVolcanic eruptions had never before been observed on a world\nother than Earth. The Voyager cameras identified at least nine\nactive volcanoes on Io, with plumes of ejected material extending\nas far as 280 kilometers (175 miles) above the moon's surface.\n\n     Io's pizza-colored terrain, marked by orange and yellow\nhues, is probably the result of sulfur-rich materials brought to\nthe surface by volcanic activity. Volcanic activity on this\nsatellite is the result of tidal flexing caused by the\ngravitational tug-of-war between Io, Jupiter and the other three\nGalilean moons.\n\n     Europa, approximately the same size as our Moon, is the\nbrightest Galilean satellite. The moon's surface displays a\ncomplex array of streaks, indicating the crust has been\nfractured. Caught in a gravitational tug-of-war like Io, Europa\nhas been heated enough to cause its interior ice to melt --\napparently producing a liquid-water ocean. This ocean is covered\nby an ice crust that has formed where water is exposed to the\ncold of space. Europa's core is made of rock that sank to its\ncenter.\n\n     Like Europa, the other two Galilean moons -- Ganymede and\nCallisto -- are worlds of ice and rock. Ganymede is the largest\nsatellite in the solar system -- larger than the planets Mercury\nand Pluto. The satellite is composed of about 50 percent water or\nice and the rest rock. Ganymede's surface has areas of different\nbrightness, indicating that, in the past, material oozed out of\nthe moon's interior and was deposited at various locations on the\nsurface.\n\n     Callisto, only slightly smaller than Ganymede, has the\nlowest density of any Galilean satellite, suggesting that large\namounts of water are part of its composition. Callisto is the\nmost heavily cratered object in the solar system; no activity\nduring its history has erased old craters except more impacts.\n\n     Detailed studies of all the Galilean satellites will be\nperformed by the Galileo Orbiter.\n     \n\nSaturn\n\n     No planet in the solar system is adorned like Saturn. Its\nexquisite ring system is unrivaled. Like Jupiter, Saturn is\ncomposed mostly of hydrogen. But in contrast to the vivid colors\nand wild turbulence found in Jovian clouds, Saturn's atmosphere\nhas a more subtle, butterscotch hue, and its markings are muted\nby high-altitude haze. Given Saturn's somewhat placid-looking\nappearance, scientists were surprised at the high-velocity\nequatorial jet stream that blows some 1,770 kilometers (1,100\nmiles) per hour.\n\n     Three American spacecraft have visited Saturn. Pioneer 11\nsped by the planet and its moon Titan in September 1979,\nreturning the first close-up images. Voyager 1 followed in\nNovember 1980, sending back breathtaking photographs that\nrevealed for the first time the complexities of Saturn's ring\nsystem and moons. Voyager 2 flew by the planet and its moons in\nAugust 1981.\n\n     The rings are composed of countless low-density particles\norbiting individually around Saturn's equator at progressive\ndistances from the cloud tops. Analysis of spacecraft radio waves\npassing through the rings showed that the particles vary widely\nin size, ranging from dust to house-sized boulders. The rings are\nbright because they are mostly ice and frosted rock.\n\n     The rings might have resulted when a moon or a passing body\nventured too close to Saturn. The unlucky object would have been\ntorn apart by great tidal forces on its surface and in its\ninterior. Or the object may not have been fully formed to begin\nwith and disintegrated under the influence of Saturn's gravity. A\nthird possibility is that the object was shattered by collisions\nwith larger objects orbiting the planet.\n\n     Unable either to form into a moon or to drift away from each\nother, individual ring particles appear to be held in place by\nthe gravitational pull of Saturn and its satellites. These\ncomplex gravitational interactions form the thousands of ringlets\nthat make up the major rings.\n\n     Radio emissions quite similar to the static heard on an AM\ncar radio during an electrical storm were detected by the Voyager\nspacecraft. These emissions are typical of lightning but are\nbelieved to be coming from Saturn's ring system rather than its\natmosphere, where no lightning was observed. As they had at\nJupiter, the Voyagers saw a version of Earth's auroras near\nSaturn's poles.\n\n     The Voyagers discovered new moons and found several\nsatellites that share the same orbit. We learned that some moons\nshepherd ring particles, maintaining Saturn's rings and the gaps\nin the rings. Saturn's 18th moon was discovered in 1990 from\nimages taken by Voyager 2 in 1981. \n\n     Voyager 1 determined that Titan has a nitrogen-based\natmosphere with methane and argon -- one more like Earth's in\ncomposition than the carbon dioxide atmospheres of Mars and\nVenus. Titan's surface temperature of -179 degrees Celsius (-290\ndegrees Fahrenheit) implies that there might be water-ice islands\nrising above oceans of ethane-methane liquid or sludge.\nUnfortunately, Voyager's cameras could not penetrate the moon's\ndense clouds.\n\n     Continuing photochemistry from solar radiation may be\nconverting Titan's methane to ethane, acetylene and -- in\ncombination with nitrogen -- hydrogen cyanide. The latter\ncompound is a building block of amino acids. These conditions may\nbe similar to the atmospheric conditions of primeval Earth\nbetween three and four billion years ago. However, Titan's\natmospheric temperature is believed to be too low to permit\nprogress beyond this stage of organic chemistry.\n\n     The exploration of Saturn will continue with the Cassini\nmission. The Cassini spacecraft will orbit the planet and will\nalso deploy a probe called Huygens, which will be dropped into\nTitan's atmosphere and fall to the surface. Cassini will use the\nprobe as well as radar to peer through Titan's clouds and will\nspend years examining the Saturnian system.\n     \n\nUranus\n\n     In January 1986, four and a half years after visiting\nSaturn, Voyager 2 completed the first close-up survey of the\nUranian system. The brief flyby revealed more information about\nUranus and its retinue of icy moons than had been gleaned from\nground observations since the planet's discovery over two\ncenturies ago by the English astronomer William Herschel.\n\n     Uranus, third largest of the planets, is an oddball of the\nsolar system. Unlike the other planets (with the exception of\nPluto), this giant lies tipped on its side with its north and\nsouth poles alternately facing the sun during an 84-year swing\naround the solar system. During Voyager 2's flyby, the south pole\nfaced the Sun. Uranus might have been knocked over when an\nEarth-sized object collided with it early in the life of the\nsolar system.\n\n     Voyager 2 found that Uranus' magnetic field does not follow\nthe usual north-south axis found on the other planets. Instead,\nthe field is tilted 60 degrees and offset from the planet's\ncenter, a phenomenon that on Earth would be like having one\nmagnetic pole in New York City and the other in the city of\nDjakarta, on the island of Java in Indonesia.\n\n     Uranus' atmosphere consists mainly of hydrogen, with some 12\npercent helium and small amounts of ammonia, methane and water\nvapor. The planet's blue color occurs because methane in its\natmosphere absorbs all other colors. Wind speeds range up to 580\nkilometers (360 miles) per hour, and temperatures near the cloud\ntops average -221 degrees Celsius (-366 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\n     Uranus' sunlit south pole is shrouded in a kind of\nphotochemical "smog" believed to be a combination of acetylene,\nethane and other sunlight-generated chemicals. Surrounding the\nplanet's atmosphere and extending thousands of kilometers into\nspace is a mysterious ultraviolet sheen known as "electroglow."\n\n     Approximately 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) below Uranus'\ncloud tops, there is thought to be a scalding ocean of water and\ndissolved ammonia some 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) deep.\nBeneath this ocean is an Earth-sized core of heavier materials.\n\n     Voyager 2 discovered 10 new moons, 16-169 kilometers (10-105\nmiles) in diameter, orbiting Uranus. The five previously known --\nMiranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon -- range in size from\n520 to 1,610 kilometers (323 to 1,000 miles) across. Representing\na geological showcase, these five moons are half-ice, half-rock\nspheres that are cold and dark and show evidence of past\nactivity, including faulting and ice flows.\n\n     The most remarkable of Uranus' moons is Miranda. Its surface\nfeatures high cliffs as well as canyons, crater-pocked plains and\nwinding valleys. The sharp variations in terrain suggest that,\nafter the moon formed, it was smashed apart by a collision with\nanother body -- an event not unusual in our solar system, which\ncontains many objects that have impact craters or are fragments\nfrom large impacts. What is extraordinary is that Miranda\napparently reformed with some of the material that had been in\nits interior exposed on its surface.\n\n     Uranus was thought to have nine dark rings; Voyager 2 imaged\n11. In contrast to Saturn's rings, which are composed of bright\nparticles, Uranus' rings are primarily made up of dark,\nboulder-sized chunks.\n     \n\nNeptune\n\n     Voyager 2 completed its 12-year tour of the solar system\nwith an investigation of Neptune and the planet's moons. On\nAugust 25, 1989, the spacecraft swept to within 4,850 kilometers\n(3,010 miles) of Neptune and then flew on to the moon Triton.\nDuring the Neptune encounter it became clear that the planet's\natmosphere was more active than Uranus'. \n\n     Voyager 2 observed the Great Dark Spot, a circular storm the\nsize of Earth, in Neptune's atmosphere. Resembling Jupiter's\nGreat Red Spot, the storm spins counterclockwise and moves\nwestward at almost 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) per hour. Voyager\n2 also noted a smaller dark spot and a fast-moving cloud dubbed\nthe "Scooter," as well as high-altitude clouds over the main\nhydrogen and helium cloud deck. The highest wind speeds of any\nplanet were observed, up to 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) per\nhour.\n\n     Like the other giant planets, Neptune has a gaseous hydrogen\nand helium upper layer over a liquid interior. The planet's core\ncontains a higher percentage of rock and metal than those of the\nother gas giants. Neptune's distinctive blue appearance, like\nUranus' blue color, is due to atmospheric methane.\n\n     Neptune's magnetic field is tilted relative to the planet's\nspin axis and is not centered at the core. This phenomenon is\nsimilar to Uranus' magnetic field and suggests that the fields of\nthe two giants are being generated in an area above the cores,\nwhere the pressure is so great that liquid hydrogen assumes the\nelectrical properties of a metal. Earth's magnetic field, on the\nother hand, is produced by its spinning metallic core and is only\nslightly tilted and offset relative to its center.\n\n     Voyager 2 also shed light on the mystery of Neptune's rings.\nObservations from Earth indicated that there were arcs of\nmaterial in orbit around the giant planet. It was not clear how\nNeptune could have arcs and how these could be kept from\nspreading out into even, unclumped rings. Voyager 2 detected\nthese arcs, but they were, in fact, part of thin, complete rings.\nA number of small moons could explain the arcs, but such bodies\nwere not spotted.\n\n     Astronomers had identified the Neptunian moons Triton in\n1846 and Nereid in 1949. Voyager 2 found six more. One of the new\nmoons -- Proteus -- is actually larger than Nereid, but since\nProteus orbits close to Neptune, it was lost in the planet's\nglare for observers on Earth.\n\n      Triton circles Neptune in a retrograde orbit in under six\ndays. Tidal forces on Triton are causing it to spiral slowly\ntowards the planet. In 10 to 100 million years (a short time in\nastronomical terms), the moon will be so close that Neptunian\ngravity will tear it apart, forming a spectacular ring to\naccompany the planet's modest current rings.\n\n     Triton's landscape is as strange and unexpected as those of\nIo and Miranda. The moon has more rock than its counterparts at\nSaturn and Uranus. Triton's mantle is probably composed of\nwater-ice, but the moon's crust is a thin veneer of nitrogen and\nmethane. The moon shows two dramatically different types of\nterrain: the so-called "cantaloupe" terrain and a receding ice\ncap. \n\n     Dark streaks appear on the ice cap. These streaks are the\nfallout from geyser-like volcanic vents that shoot nitrogen gas\nand dark, fine-grained particles to heights of 2 to 8 kilometers\n(1 to 5 miles). Triton's thin atmosphere, only 1/70,000th as\nthick as Earth's, has winds that carry the dark particles and\ndeposit them as streaks on the ice cap -- the coldest surface yet\nfound in the solar system (-235 degrees Celsius, -391 degrees\nFahrenheit). Triton might be more like Pluto than any other\nobject spacecraft have so far visited.\n     \n\nPluto\n\n     Pluto is the most distant of the planets, yet the\neccentricity of its orbit periodically carries it inside\nNeptune's orbit, where it has been since 1979 and where it will\nremain until March 1999. Pluto's orbit is also highly inclined --\ntilted 17 degrees to the orbital plane of the other planets.\n\n     Discovered in 1930, Pluto appears to be little more than a\ncelestial snowball. The planet's diameter is calculated to be\napproximately 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles), only two-thirds the\nsize of our Moon. Ground-based observations indicate that Pluto's\nsurface is covered with methane ice and that there is a thin\natmosphere that may freeze and fall to the surface as the planet\nmoves away from the Sun. Observations also show that Pluto's spin\naxis is tipped by 122 degrees. \n\n     The planet has one known satellite, Charon, discovered in\n1978. Charon's surface composition is different from Pluto's: the\nmoon appears to be covered with water-ice rather than methane\nice. Its orbit is gravitationally locked with Pluto, so both\nbodies always keep the same hemisphere facing each other. Pluto's\nand Charon's rotational period and Charon's period of revolution\nare all 6.4 Earth days. \n\n     Although no spacecraft have ever visited Pluto, NASA is\ncurrently exploring the possibility of such a mission.\n     \n\nComets\n\n     The outermost members of the solar system occasionally pay a\nvisit to the inner planets. As asteroids are the rocky and\nmetallic remnants of the formation of the solar system, comets\nare the icy debris from that dim beginning and can survive only\nfar from the Sun. Most comet nuclei reside in the Oort Cloud, a\nloose swarm of objects in a halo beyond the planets and reaching\nperhaps halfway to the nearest star.\n\n     Comet nuclei orbit in this frozen abyss until they are\ngravitationally perturbed into new orbits that carry them close\nto the Sun. As a nucleus falls inside the orbits of the outer\nplanets, the volatile elements of which it is made gradually\nwarm; by the time the nucleus enters the region of the inner\nplanets, these volatile elements are boiling. The nucleus itself\nis irregular and only a few miles across, and is made principally\nof water-ice with methane and ammonia -- materials very similar\nto those composing the moons of the giant planets.\n\n     As these materials boil off of the nucleus, they form a coma\nor cloud-like "head" that can measure tens of thousands of\nkilometers across. The coma grows as the comet gets closer to the\nSun. The stream of charged particles coming from the Sun pushes\non this cloud, blowing it back like a flag in the wind and giving\nrise to the comet's "tails." Gases and ions are blown directly\nback from the nucleus, but dust particles are pushed more slowly.\nAs the nucleus continues in its orbit, the dust particles are\nleft behind in a curved arc.\n\n     Both the gas and dust tails point away from the Sun; in\neffect, the comet chases its tails as it recedes from the Sun.\nThe tails can reach 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) in\nlength, but the total amount of material contained in this\ndramatic display would fit in an ordinary suitcase. Comets --\nfrom the Latin cometa, meaning "long-haired" -- are essentially\ndramatic light shows.\n\n     Some comets pass through the solar system only once, but\nothers have their orbits gravitationally modified by a close\nencounter with one of the giant outer planets. These latter\nvisitors can enter closed elliptical orbits and repeatedly return\nto the inner solar system.\n\n     Halley's Comet is the most famous example of a relatively\nshort period comet, returning on an average of once every 76\nyears and orbiting from beyond Neptune to within Venus' orbit.\nConfirmed sightings of the comet go back to 240 B.C. This regular\nvisitor to our solar system is named for Sir Edmond Halley,\nbecause he plotted the comet's orbit and predicted its return,\nbased on earlier sightings and Newtonian laws of motion. His name\nbecame part of astronomical lore when, in 1759, the comet\nreturned on schedule. Unfortunately, Sir Edmond did not live to\nsee it.\n\n     A comet can be very prominent in the sky if it passes\ncomparatively close to Earth. Unfortunately, on its most recent\nappearance, Halley's Comet passed no closer than 62.4 million\nkilometers (38.8 million miles) from our world. The comet was\nvisible to the naked eye, especially for viewers in the southern\nhemisphere, but it was not spectacular. Comets have been so\nbright, on rare occasions, that they were visible during daytime.\nHistorically, comet sightings have been interpreted as bad omens\nand have been artistically rendered as daggers in the sky.\n\n     The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) spacecraft will\nbecome the first traveler to fly close to a comet nucleus and\nremain in proximity to it as they both approach the Sun. CRAF\nwill observe the nucleus as it becomes active in the growing\nsunlight and begins to have its lighter elements boil off and\nform a coma and tails. Several spacecraft have flown by comets at\nhigh speed; the first was NASA's International Cometary Explorer\nin 1985. An armada of five spacecraft (two Japanese, two Soviet\nand the Giotto spacecraft from the European Space Agency) flew by\nHalley's Comet in 1986.\n     \n\nConclusion\n\n     Despite their efforts to peer across the vast distances of\nspace through an obscuring atmosphere, scientists of the past had\nonly one body they could study closely -- Earth. But since 1959,\nspaceflight through the solar system has lifted the veil on our\nneighbors in space. \n\n     We have learned more about our solar system and its members\nthan anyone had in the previous thousands of years. Our automated\nspacecraft have traveled to the Moon and to all the planets\nbeyond our world except Pluto; they have observed moons as large\nas small planets, flown by comets and sampled the solar\nenvironment. Astronomy books now include detailed pictures of\nbodies that were only smudges in the largest telescopes for\ngenerations. We are lucky to be alive now to see these strange\nand beautiful places and objects.\n\n     The knowledge gained from our journeys through the solar\nsystem has redefined traditional Earth sciences like geology and\nmeteorology and spawned an entirely new discipline called\ncomparative planetology. By studying the geology of planets,\nmoons, asteroids and comets, and comparing differences and\nsimilarities, we are learning more about the origin and history\nof these bodies and the solar system as a whole.\n\n     We are also gaining insight into Earth's complex weather\nsystems. By seeing how weather is shaped on other worlds and by\ninvestigating the Sun's activity and its influence throughout the\nsolar system, we can better understand climatic conditions and\nprocesses on Earth.\n\n     We will continue to learn and benefit as our automated\nspacecraft explore our neighborhood in space. One current mission\nis mapping Venus; others are flying between worlds and will reach\nthe Sun and Jupiter after complex trajectory adjustments. Future\nmissions are planned for Mars, Saturn, a comet and the asteroid\nbelt.\n\n     We can also look forward to the time when humans will once\nagain set foot on an alien world. Although astronauts have not\nbeen back to the Moon since December 1972, plans are being\nformulated for our return to the lunar landscape and for the\nhuman exploration of Mars and even the establishment of martian\noutposts. One day, taking a holiday may mean spending a week at a\nlunar base or a martian colony!
I'm replying to someone who asked for information on space camp.\nI have a brochure that has all different schedules. What age, what \nlevel and what program do you want to know the schedule of?

I propose that PepsiCo, Mcdonalds and other companies could put \ninto orbit banners that have timely political messages, such as,\n\n     "Stop the slaughter in Bosnia!"\n\n, etc.
This was on "That's Incredible" several years ago.  The volume of liquid\nthe rat had to breath was considerably smaller than what a human would have\nto breath, so maybe it is possible for a rat but not a human.
Hans> As somebody replied on whether the space shuttle is connected to\nHans> Usenet: "No. Of course the main flow of information would be up,\nHans> unless Henry Spencer would be aboard, in which case the main\nHans> flow of information would be down."\n\nGene Miya says that Henry will never go aloft in the Shuttle; the\npayload bay isn't big enough for his chocolate chip cookies.\n\nWhen Henry was here at Dryden, he was looking pretty covetously at the\nSR-71s and the F-104s, even though they don't have much cookie space.\nI guess he figured that he could manage for a short flight....
In some sense, I think that the folks who think the idea is wonderful, and the\nfolks who want to boycott anyone who has anything to do with this project are\nboth right.\n\nThat is, I think that space advertising is an interesting idea, and if someone\nwants to try it out, more power to them. However, a company may discover that\nthe cost of launch is not the only cost of advertising, and a company who \ngauged that ill will would lose them more revenue than the advertising would\ngain might decide to bow out of the project.\n\nI got incensed when I read that Carl Sagan called this idea an "abomination." \nI don't think that word means what he thinks it does. Children starving in the\nrichest country in the world is an abomination; an ad agency is at worst just\nin poor taste.
: While I'm sure Sagan considers it sacrilegious, that wouldn't be\n: because of his doubtfull credibility as an astronomer. Modern, \n: ground-based, visible light astronomy (what these proposed\n: orbiting billboards would upset) is already a dying field: The\n: opacity and distortions caused by the atmosphere itself have\n: driven most of the field to use radio, far infrared or space-based\n: telescopes.\n\nHardly.  The Keck telescope in Hawaii has taken its first pictures; they're\nnearly as good as Hubble for a tiny fraction of the cost.\n\n: In any case, a bright point of light passing through\n: the field doesn't ruin observations. If that were the case, the\n: thousands of existing satellites would have already done so (satelliets\n: might not seem so bright to the eyes, but as far as astronomy is concerned,\n: they are extremely bright.)\n\nI believe that this orbiting space junk will be FAR brighter still;\nmore like the full moon.  The moon upsets deep-sky observation all\nover the sky (and not just looking at it) because of scattered light.\n\nThis is a known problem, but of course two weeks out of every four are\nOK.  What happens when this billboard circles every 90 minutes?  What\nwould be a good time then?\n\n:                                              Frank Crary\n:                                              CU Boulder
.. \n\n\nOne thing to recall.  Putting a satellite as high as possible is one thing. \nComing back to not only that altitude, but matching the position of it in \nits orbit on a subsequent mission is another thing.  Any misalignment of the \nplane of the orbit during launch or being ahead or behind the target will \nrequire more fuel to adjust.  This was considered in the original deployment. \n\nI agree though that the demands on the crew and complexity are stupendous.  \nOne has to admire how much they are trying to do.

Mike Adams suggested discussions on long-term effects of spaceflight\nto the human being.  I love this topic, as some of you regulars know.\n\nSo, having seen Henry's encouraging statement about starting to talk\nabout it; I shall.\n\nI feel that we as a community of people have unique resources\nto deliver to the world a comprehensive book which can elaborate\non the utility of spaceflight to fields which are as divergent \nas medical intensive care, agriculture, environmental protection, and \nprobably more.  I do not believe that the general public understands\nthe impact of spaceflight on the whole of society.  In the absence\nof such knowledge, we see dwindling support of the world's space effort.\n\nI believe that we as a group have the responsibility to not only\ncommunicate amongst ourselves, but also with others through print media.\n\nA well-orchestrated and technically oriented analysis of life science\nvariables required to support long-duration spaceflight (like long\nexpenditions to the moon or Mars) would be entertaining and educational\nto the general public.  The objective of such an effort would be to \ncompile resources and publications from accepted scientific and technical\njournals which would address each major life science area.  In addition,\nideas for further research and development could be put forward for\nthe general public to ponder...allowing the general public to take\npart in the excitement of exploration.\n\nIndividuals interested should be willing to devote an hour per week\nto running literature searches and finding journal articles.  In addition,\nwe need to obtain the assistance of personnel from within the halls\nof NASA and industry.\n\nI have appreciated the positive responses to date and I am personally\neager to start this project.  Perhaps we could start with debate regarding\nhow best to grade the viability of various technologies for application\nto spaceflight.
That's assuming it could get built by them.\n\nOf course,  it would probably sport Cruise missile Racks,\nSidewinder Missile tubes,  Bomb Points,  extra drop tanks,\na Full ECM suite, Terrain following radar  and stealth\nmaterials.\n\nIT might not fly,  but a technology demonstrator does\nnot require  actual flight.
Why jettison the SSMEs?  Why not hold on to them and have a shuttle \nbring them down to use as spares?
It would be nice if someone here from the HST program was talking instead\nof all the speculation that is going on here. From what I understand from\nDr. Frank Six of the Marshall Space Flight Center there is no insrmountable\nproblem in bringing HST back. IT was designed that way to begin with.\n\nAlso it is my understanding that the solar arrays WILL be one of the items\nreplaced on this mission. The originals were built by Brit Aerospace and\nI think the new ones are too. I am currently working with the guys at MSFC\nthat are in charge is the HST power system, although I have not spoken with\nthem in a long time about HST.
I am taking a course entitled "Exploring Science Using Internet".\nFor our final project, we are to find a compendium of Internet resources \ndealing with a science-related topic. I chose Astronomy. Anyway, I was \nwondering if anyone out there knew of any interesting resources on Internet\nthat provide information on Astronomy, space, NASA, or anything like that.\n\nTHANKS!
You should have been following the discussion of GRBs\ngoing on in sci.astro. It's been discussed in some detail,\nwith references even.
Although the $1 billion scheme is a fantasy (it's an old canard in the space\nbusiness called "trolling for billionaires"), there is a good chance that a\nmuch smaller program ($65 million) will pass the 103rd Congress. This is the\nBack to the Moon bill, put together by the people who passed the Launch\nServices Purchase Act. The bill would incent private companies to develop\nlunar orbiters, with vendors selected on the basis of competitive bidding.\nThere is an aggregate cap on the bids of $65 million.\n \nHaving a single rich individual paying billions for lunar missions is probably\nworse than having the government bankroll a $65 million program, as the Delta\nClipper program has shown (DC-X was funded by SDIO at $59 million). We have a\nclear chance of making a lunar mission happen in this decade - as opposed to\nsimply wishing for our dreams to come true. Please support the Back to the\nMoon bill.\n \nFor more information, please send E-mail with your U.S. postal service\naddress.
In the New York Times on Sunday May 9th in the week in review\nsection there was a report of a group called "Space Marketing"\nin Atlanta, Georgia who is planning to put up a one mile wide\nreflective Earth orbiting satelite which will appear as large\nand as bright as the Moon and carry some sort of advertising.\nThere was an editorial about this in the Times the following\nTuesday.\n\nAre others as upset about this as I am?  I feel that a global\nboycott of anyone involved with such a project would be a good\nidea.  Perhaps it could be made illegal in various countries\naround the world?  Do others agree?\n\n-david\n\n[Relevant messages found on the net:]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFrom: webb@tsavo.hks.com (Peter Webb)\nNewsgroups: sci.space\nSubject: Stopping the sky-vandals\nDate: 13 May 1993 21:17:22 GMT\nOrganization: HKS, Inc.\nDistribution: world\n\n\n\nIf you don't want to see Space Marketing put up orbiting billboards, write\nthem, or call them, and tell them so.

If I may offer a constructive criticism, perhaps you should decide if you\nlove vehicles or the use they are put to. I, myself, think the F-86 is\na beautiful aircraft, but rest assured, I wouldn't even think of flying\nit in combat today. Most of us want access to space and judge vehicles\non how they perform.\n\n\nNot to this degree.\n\n\nWhy?\n\n\nYour wrong. The DC approach is very tollerent of failure. It also has\nthe advantage of far greater reliability do to its reusable nature (Shuttle\nisn't reusable, it's salvagable).\n\n\nThe flip over happens at a very low speed, not supersonic. If the DC-X\nshows the flip over works, it will work unless the laws of physics change.\n\n\nThe final DC-1 will have fully intact abort throughout the entire flight\nenvelop. Upon re-entry for example, it can loose about 80% of available\nthrust and still land safely.\n\n\nEverything can suffer from catastrophic failure but that's not the same\nthing. Shuttle simply isn't a fault tolerent design, SSTO is.\n\n\nYou don't put your patients in conditions where there is no way out. You\nwouldn't for example, give a patient a drug and not monitor them for\nharmful side effects would you?\n\n\nYou are very much in the minority. If the DC series fails to make orbit, it\nwill still be a very worthwhile effort. It will show us EXACTLY what we do\nneed to do to build SSTO.\n\n\nAgain, refering to the DC-1, it will provide fully intact abort theroughout\nthe flight envelop. Shuttle doesn't. DC is fault tollerent, Shuttle isn't.\n\n\nNot true. Build a passenger pallet (a fairly easy thing to do) and it will\ncarry passengers.\n\n\nI would suggest you talk to the DC-X crew themselves. Their original\nschedule had an operational DC-1 flying in 96.\n\n\nYour ignoring the dammage it does. Mannes space has a reputation for being\nunreliable and hugely expensive. Shuttle supporters only make it easy for\nopponents of manned space to kill it.\n\n\nThe only way to prove those things is to build it.\n\n  Allen
[deleted]\n[deleted]\nOk, so those scientists can get around the atmosphere with fancy\ncomputer algorythims, but have you looked ad the Hubble results, the\ndefects of the mirror are partially correctable with software (see\nthose jupiter pictures for results), but is the effects are completely\nreversable, why is there going to be a shuttle mission to fix it?\n\nThe way I see it (and please, astromomers give me a swift net-kick in\nthe butt if i'm out of the ball park), the astromers are making the\nbest of limited possiblities, there's only one hubble, and the shuttle\nmakes another in the near future a non-thought.  Perhaps those self\nsame billboards could have small optical receptors of a limited kind\nmounted on the reverse sides of the mirror's (if that is what is used)\nand then the whole thing becomes a giant array telescope...\n\n--
: In article <1993Apr29.121501@is.morgan.com>, jlieb@is.morgan.com (Jerry Liebelson) writes...\n: > I want to know what weightlessness actually FEELS like. For example, is\n: >there a constant sensation of falling? \n\nRon Baalke (baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov) replied:\n: Yes, weightlessness does feel like falling.  It may feel strange at first,\n: but the body does adjust.  The feeling is not too different from that\n: of sky diving.\n\nI'm no astronaut, but I've flown in the KC-135 several times.  I'll\ntell you about my first flight.\n\nAt the on-set of weightlessness, my shoulders lifted and my spine\nstraightened.  I felt a momentary panic, and my hands tried to grab\nonto something (like the strap keeping me firmly against the floor)\nto prevent me from falling; I remember conciously over-ruling my\ninvoluntary motions.  My ears felt (not heard) a rush and I could\nfeel fluid moving in my head (like when you get up from bed while\nyou have a cold).\n\nAt that point, I ceased to concentrate on my physiological response,\nsince I had some science to do.  I was busy keeping my experiment\ngoing and keeping track of all the parts during the "return" of\ngravity and subsequent 1.8-G pull-out, so I didn't really pay\nattention to physiology at that time.\n\nAfter about 5 parabolas, I discovered that I was performing one\nof the tricks I've discovered to keep myself from getting motion\nsickness; I was keeping my head very still and moving very slowly\n-- all except my hands and arms, which needed to be in rapid,\nconcious motion for my experiment.  During the pull-out to\nparabola 5, my queasiness finally started to get to me, and I\nhad to use one of those air-sickness bags.  I was basically\nuseless for the rest of that flight, so I went to the seats in\nthe back of the plane while my partner (whom I drafted for just\nthis purpose) kept working on the experiment while I was ill.\n(He was a vetran Vomit Comet rider, one of those anomalous\npeople who don't get sick on the thing.)\n\nI didn't think of it as a "constant sensation of falling" so\nmuch as like swimming in air.  It's very close to the sensations\nI feel when I'm scuba diving and I turn my head down and fins up.\n\nJerry:\n: >And what is the motion sickness\n: >that some astronauts occasionally experience? \n\nRon:\n: It is the body's reaction to a strange environment.  It appears to be\n: induced partly to physical discomfort and part to mental distress.\n: Some people are more prone to it than others, like some people are more\n: prone to get sick on a roller coaster ride than others.  The mental\n: part is usually induced by a lack of clear indication of which way is\n: up or down, ie: the Shuttle is normally oriented with its cargo bay\n: pointed towards Earth, so the Earth (or ground) is "above" the head of\n: the astronauts.  About 50% of the astronauts experience some form of\n: motion sickness, and NASA has done numerous tests in space to try to\n: see how to keep the number of occurances down.\n\nI'm a volunteer in JSC's Space Biomedical Laboratory where they do,\namong other things, some of the tests Ron mentions.  I was in one\ncalled the Pre-flight Adaptation Trainer, which consisted of a chair on\na several-degree-of-freedom motion base with moving geometric visual\naids.

Sorry, I've lost track of who asked the question originally \n	(our news server at GSFC keeps things around for tremendously\n	short periods of time), but wanted to be certain before I\n	replied. Someone asked about displaying the compressed images\n	from the Voyager imaging CD-ROMs on a Mac. As Peter Ford (MIT)\n	pointed out, a decompression program is available via FTP.\n	(Sorry, I don't remember the name of the node offhand, \n	although it's .mit.edu.) In any case, though, one of the MAC\n	display programs (CD ROM Browser by Dana Swift) does display\n	the compressed images directly. The program is shareware and\n	is distributed by NSSDC for nominal reproduction costs ($9 +\n	shipping, if memory serves). This does *not* cover the\n	shareware price which should go to Dana for his diligent work\n	and upgrades, however.\n\n	To request current pricing information, information about\n	available display software, catalogs, or data from NSSDC,\n	contact our user support office at:\n\n		National Space Science Data Center\n		Coordinated Request and User Support Office (CRUSO)\n		Mail Code 633\n		NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center\n		Greenbelt, MD   20771\n		Phone: (301) 286-6695\n		Fax:   (301) 286-4952
Well, almost. It turns out that clever orbital mechanics can \nengineer things so that resonant interactions with the higher order \nharmonics of the Earth's gravitational field can pump energy into a \nsatellite, and keep it from experiencing drag effects for periods of \nmonths to years. \n\n     My favorite example of this is the Soviet/Russian heavy ELINT \nsatellites of the Cosmos 1603 class, which are in 14:1 resonance. In \nparticular, C1833 has undergone two periods of prolonged *gain* in \naltitude, the current one having started in June 1991; the mean altitude \nof the satellite is now as high as it has ever been since launch on 18 \nMarch 1987. (Looking at the elements for C1833 also shows the \nlimitations of NORAD's software -- but that's another story.) \n\n    This probably has little relevance to space stations, since the 71 \ndegree orbits of the C1603 satellites are at 850 km, which is \nunacceptably far into the inner van Allen belt for manned platforms. But \nit's kind of interesting from the point of view of the physics of the \nsituation. \n\n    (Orbital elements for these satellites are available on request.) \n\n\nAllen Thomson                  SAIC                       McLean, VA
[...]\n\nThis reminds me... my fuzzy brain recalls that somebody was thinking\nof reviving the San Marco launch platform off the coast of Kenya,\nwhere the Copernicus satellite was launched around 1972.  Is this\ntrue, or am I imagining it?  Possibly it's connected with one of the\nItalian programs to revive the Scout in a new version.\n\nThat old platform must be getting pretty rusty, and there ain't a lot\nof infrastructure to go with it...
Here is a potentially dumb question: What prevents the martian landers\nthemselves from "polluting" the martian environment with earth based\ncritters?

(sci.space readers can skip the first paragraph)\n\n  Yesterday, in response to Henry Spencer's question about the \ntemperature of a blackbody in interstellar space, I said "Dust grains\nacts as blackbodies, and they're at 40-150 K."  Well, I was dead\nwrong.  Our local interstellar dust expert, Bruce Draine, has\ninformed me that dust grains _aren't_ good radiators in the far IR,\nwhich is why they are so warm; actually, the ambient radiation field\nfrom distant stars can bring a true blackbody to only 3 or 4 Kelvin.\nSorry, Henry, and anyone else I misled.  Obviously, time for me to\ntake another ISM class :-(\n\n  In other news, Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute gave\na talk on the Pluto-Charon binary system yesterday.  He gave a brief\noverview of the currently-accepted system parameters (volume ratio of\nabout 8:1, mass ratio about 15:1 or so, plus lots more...) and then\ngave his thoughts on the formation of Pluto-Charon.  His idea is \nthat there were lots and lots of small planetesimals in the outer\nsolar system, with masses distributed as a power law of some kind;\nover time, the planetesimals accreted into larger bodies.  Most got\nscattered out of the solar system by close encounters with Jupiter\nand Saturn, but many accreted into the gas giants, especially\nUranus and Neptune.  A large planetesimal was captured by Neptune -\nwe call it Triton [captured how?  Perhaps by a collision with a smaller,\nalready-existing Neptunian moon, perhaps by a very close passage through\nNeptune's atmosphere - mondo aerobraking!].\n\n  He notes that the two recently discovered "Kuiper Belt" objects,\n1992 QB1 and 1993 FW, plus Chiron and Pholus, are all about the same \nmass, and he identifies this group as one-accretion-down from the\nlarger bodies of Triton and Pluto/Charon.  Pluto/Charon, he thinks,\nformed when an impacting body hit proto-Pluto, knocking some material\ninto a ring around Pluto which later accreted in Charon; similar to\nideas about the formation of Earth's moon.  There is good evidence\nfrom spectra that the surfaces of Pluto and Charon are very different\n(Pluto has methane frost, Charon doesn't), which can be used as evidence\nfor the impact theory.\n\n  He believes that there may be around 1000 Pluto-to-Chiron-sized objects\nremaining in a relatively stable dynamical zone just outside Neptune's \norbit, beyond 35 AU or so.  1992 QB1 and 1993 FW are the first members\nof this population to be found, in his model.  Note that such bodies\nwill be very dark, since if their surfaces are covered with methane \nfrost, it will have photolyzed into very dark, long-chain hydrocarbons\nby now.  The reason that Pluto has such a high albedo (around 0.5, I think)\nis that its surface warms up JUST enough around perihelion to sublimate,\nand when the atmosphere freezes out again, thirty years later, it forms\nbright, new frost.  So any bodies much farther away than 30 AU are going\nto be very hard to see.\n\n  I hope I haven't made any errors in the transcription; if you see\na howling mistake, it's undoubtedly mine, not his.\n\n  By the way, he's one of the top guns behind the Pluto Fast Flyby\nmission (I think), and said that the current plans are to use a\nTitan 4 to send the probe on "just about a rectilinear trajectory"\nto Pluto (we were speaking loosely at the time...).  He'd like\nto use a Proton, which gives a slightly smaller velocity but costs\nMUCH less.  His figures: $500 Million for 2 Titan 4 launches (there\nwill be two separate probes, launched separately), or $120 Million\nfor 2 Proton launches.  He told a story about how the Soviets originally\noffered to sell Proton launches for $30 Million each, but were forced\nto increase their prices in the US in order to be allowed in the\nmarketplace.\n\n  I'm just telling you what he said.\n\n                          Michael
Well, it's not that simple -- you're in Earth's magnetic field, and you\ndon't generate electricity -- but it can be done.\n\n\nThe way you power things is with electricity, so the answer to the first\nquestion is definitely yes.  (If you meant to say "propel" rather than\n"power", the answer is "sort of".)  Yes, you can use interaction with the\nEarth's magnetic field to get electrical power, and there are potential\napplications for this.\n\nHowever, bear in mind that there is no free lunch.  The energy isn't\ncoming from nowhere.  What such systems do is convert some of the energy\nof your orbital velocity into electrical energy.  There are cases where\nthis is a useful tradeoff.  Using power obtained in this way for propulsion\nis useful only in special situations, however.\n\nWhat you *can* do is get your power by some other means, e.g. solar arrays,\nand run the interaction with the magnetic field in reverse, pumping energy\n*into* the orbit rather than taking energy out of it.\n\nIf you want more information, trying looking up "electrodynamic propulsion",\n"tether applications", and "magsails".\n\n\nNo.  A "dragless" satellite does not magically have no drag; it burns fuel\nconstantly to fight drag, maintaining the exact orbit it would have *if*\nthere was no drag.  This is why there are quotes around "dragless".
: >Why not build a inflatable space dock.\n\n: If you're doing large-scale satellite servicing, being able to do it in\n: a pressurized hangar makes considerable sense.  The question is whether\n: anyone is going to be doing large-scale satellite servicing in the near\n: future, to the point of justifying development of such a thing.\n\nThat's a mighty fine idea.  But since you asked "Why not," I'll\nrespond.\n\nPutting aside the application of such a space dock, there are other\nfactors to consider than just pressurized volume.  Temperature control\nis difficult in space, and your inflatable hangar will have to \nincorporate thermal insulation (maybe a double-walled inflatable).\nMicrometeoroid protection and radiation protection are also required.\nDon't think this will be a clear plastic bubble; it's more likely\nto look like a big white ball made out of the same kind of multi-layer\nfabric that soft-torso space suits are made out of today.\n\nBecause almost all manned space vessels (Skylab, Mir, Salyut) used\ntheir pressurization for increased structural rigidity, even though\nthey had (have) metal skins, they still kind of qualify as inflatable.\n\nThe inflation process would have to be carefully controlled.  The\nspace environment reduces ductility in exposed materials (due to\ntemperature extremes, monotomic Oxygen impingement, and radiation\neffects on materials), so your "fabric" may not retain any flexibility\nfor long.  (This may not matter.)  Even after inflation, pressure\nchanges in the hangar may cause flexing in the fabric, which could\nlead to holes and tears as ductility decreases.\n\nThese are some of the technical difficulties which the LLNL proposal\nfor an inflatable space station dealt with to varying degrees of\nsuccess.\n\n-- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office\n      kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov  (713) 483-4368

Hello netters,\n\n   I'm new to this board and I thought this might be the best place\nfor my post.  I have a question regarding satellite technology seen\nin the movie Patriot Games.  In the movies, the CIA utilizes its\norbitting sats to pinpoint a specific terrorist camp in N Africa.\nThe photos taken by the sats are stunning!  I know that sats are\ncapable of photographing the license plates of vehicles.  My\nquestion is this:  The camp in question was taken out by the\nBritish SAS.  And while the SAS was in action, the CIA team was\nwatching in the warroom back in Langley, VA.  The action of the SAS\nwas clear and appeared to be relayed via a sat.  The action was at\nnight and the photography appeared to be an x-ray type.  That is,\none could see the action within the tents/structures of the camp.\nDoes such techology exist and what is it's nature?  i.e., UV, IR,\nx-ray, etc.\n\nPS  Who wrote the book Patriot Games?
they weren't even carrying extra suits.\n\nSo how much mass is saved by not burning the OMS?  That's the critical question.\nMy data shows that the OMS engines hold 10,900 kg of propellant.  Of that, a \nsubstantial fraction is going to be used for the first OMS burn, the reentry\nburn and the reserve.  So Pat, tell us how much fuel the altitude change is\ngoing to take, and how much the EDO pallet, BUS-1 and extra parts are going\nmass.  If you can make the numbers work out, _then_ I'll be interested.  After\nyou show us that it can be done, then tell us how much the EDO pallet, BUS-1\nand extra equipment is going to cost.  \n\n\n\n\nFirst, while astronauts certainly have done EVAs with minimal planning, that was\nbecause they _had_ to.  They don't like to do that as a general rule.\n\nSecond, remember why they had to improvise during Intelsat 6?  They were trying\nto attach a motor to a piece of hardware that wasn't designed to do that.  \nTrying to shortcut the training is only going to make a repeat more likely.\n\nThird, they don't have eight months.  They have however much time is left \nafter someone comes up with a plan, shows it can work and gets it approved.\nYou may think I have a pessimistic attitude.  I think it's realistic.  I'm not\nsaying that the engineering task is impossible (few engineering tasks are).  \nWhat I'm saying is that this is neither cost effective nor feasible under NASA\nmanagement.\n\n\n\n"All they have to do is soup it up?"  Just what does that mean?  \n\n\n\n\nThe second servicing mission is a contingency.  You have neither shown that it\nwould be necessary without your plan nor that it would be unnecessary with your\nplan.  \n\n\nNo, Pat, I haven't forgotten.\n\n\nNo Pat.  That's $500 million minus the cost of the new hardware, minus the cost\nof the extra struff you want to bring along, minus development and mangement \ncosts, minus extra operating costs.  TANSTAAFL.\n\n\n\nI'm sure that if you reread this you'll see that your argument is falacious.\n\n\nPat, not only is this messy and less reliable than a device that's _made_ to \nperform this task, it also ignores the point.  There is a desire to have \nastronauts available so that if the door fails to open, something can be done\nabout it.  Unless you can provide a very reliable way of reopening the door,\nyou haven't solved the problem.
[deleted]\n\nNot to flame (REALLY), but thats an abominable viewpoint (while were\non the subject of abominations).  If we followed the "redistiribution\nof wealth" (and by the way, ist that what Clinto and the Democrats are\ntrying to do...), EVERYONE would starve in short order.  Not only is\nit impossoble to organize a fair distribution that depends on every\n(wo)man's altruism (can you say black market under communisim\nanyone?), but the current methods of resource production are entirely\nenergy dependant.  There are not enough sources of cheap capital\n(aside from human capital) to allow us to stop looking at space a an\nexcellent source of materials and realestate.  More directly, perhaps\nyou mioght consider the fact that BILLIONS are spent by TV companies,\nand their sponsors, (ABC, NBC, CBS...) on the SUPERBOWL, the OLYMPICS,\nand even on monday night baseball games.  Perhaps we should boycott\nthose games?  If DC-X and company get finished, and there is a market\nfor it, those "abominable" space will probably be much more cost\neffective for the companies, and those starving children.  More people\nbuy products, the company hires more workers, end result fewer\nchildren die of starvation.\n\n--

No, the thing is designed to be retrievable, in a pinch.  Indeed, this\ndictated a rather odd design for the solar arrays, since they had to be\nretractable as well as extendable, and may thus have indirectly contributed\nto the array-flapping problems.\n\nThe retrieval problems are exactly as stated:  it would be costly, would\ninvolve extensive downtime (and the worry of someone finding a reason not\nto re-launch it), and would unnecessarily expose the telescope to a lot\nof mechanical stresses and possibilities for contamination.

There are people who have adapted to high altitudes in the Andes and in\nTibet. I suspect that it took them several generations to make the\nadaptation because Europeans had difficulty making the adaptation. They\nhad to send the women to a lower altitude when they were pregnant in order\nto insure sucessful childbirth.\n\n\nAnother factor you should consider is the X-ray opacity of the atmosphere \nin case of stellar flares, the uv opacity is also important because uv \nradiation can kill or damage microbes, plants, and animals.
Yesterday, I went to the Boeing shareholders meeting.  It was a bit shorter\nthan I expected.  Last year (when the stock was first down), they made a big\npresentation on the 777, and other programs.  This year, it was much more\nbare-bones.\n\nIn any case, I wanted to ask a question that the board of directors would\nhear, and so I got there early, and figured that If I didn't get to the mike,\nmaybe they would read mine off of a card, and so I wrote it down, and handed it\nin.\n\nAfter the meeting started, Mr. Shrontz said that he would only answer written\nquestions, in order to be fair to the people in the overflow room that only\nhad monitors downstairs.  Naturally, I was crushed.\n\nSo, when question and answer time came, I was suprised to find my question\nbeing read and answered.  Admittedly near the end of the ones that he took.\nPresumably getting there early, and getting the question in early made all\nthe difference.\n\nSo, on to the substance. The question was \n\nIs Boeing looking at anything BEYOND the high speed Civil Transport, such\nas a commercial space launch system, and if not, how will Boeing compete\nwith the reusable single stage to orbit technology presently being developed\nby Mcdonnell Douglass?\n\nWell, he read it without a hitch, and without editing, with impressed me,\nthen he answered it very quickly treating it as a two part question, last\npart first.\n\nThis is to the best of my recollection what he said.\n\nAs far as single stage to orbit technology, we think that we have a better\nanswer in a two stage approach, and we are talking to some of our customers \nabout that.  As far as commercialization, that is a long ways off.  The High\nspeed Civil Transport is about as far out as our commercial planning goes at\nthis point.\n\nSo, this tells me that Boeing still considers space to be a non-commercial\narena, and for the most part this is true, however it also tells me that \nthey consider there to be enough money in building space launchers for them\nto persue work on their own.\n\nNow, I do have a friend on the spacelifter program at boeing.  Actually,\nthis is a mis-nomer, as there is no spacelifter contract for the work that this\nguy is doing, however, he is doing work in preparation of a proposal for space\nlifter contracts.  He won't tell me what he is doing, but maybe this is where\nthe TSTO action is taking place at boeing.  At the very minimum, the chairman\nof the board of boeing said that they have an approach in mind, and they are\ntrying to do something with it.  \n\nAnybody know anything further?\nIs this really news?\nDoes this threaten further work on DC-? ?

No, if you put a conductor in a changing magnetic field, it produces a voltage.\nThe two ways you can do that with a permanent magnet is to move the magnet or\nmove the conductor.  The slow shifting of the Earth's magnetic field isn't\nreally significant, especially when you consider how weak the Earth's magnetic\nfield is to begin with.\n\n\nWell, it would require generating an incredibly large magnetic field to repel\nthe Earth's magnetic field (as a magnet can repel another magnet).  Of course,\nthis force only works in one direction, and the magnetic field generated has\nto be unimaginably powerful.  Magnetic repulsion drops off as 1/r^3, and the\nearth's magnetic field on the surface is already very weak.  It would require\nsome sort of unknown superconductor, and special nonmagnetic construction.\nAnd seriously hardenned electronics (optical computers, perhaps).  And the\nphysiological danger would be significant (due to the iron content in our\nblood, among other things).  In other words, forget it.\n\n\nI missed out on the "dragless satellite" thread, but it sounds totally bogus,\nfrom this little bit.
Pennicillin if i have everything correct,  was a highly valuable\nMyco-toxin,  discovered during WW2.  It proved to have an amazing\nBacterio-cidal effect without human toxicity.   It's immediate\nadministration  showed immediate dramatic results  solving\nproblems  that previously were fatal.  Although initially\nenormously expensive to culture,  within 3 years,\nthe price had fallen at least two orders of magnitude,\nand within 10 years,  was  not much more expensive then\naspirin.  Penicillin was also usable for an amazingly wide\nclass of infections.\n\nCentoxin is a drug that is not passing FDA approval.  It promised\namazing results for Toxic shock, a rapidly fatal disease.\nIt consumed enormous amounts of funding  in testing and\ndevelopement,  However it works  less then 1 in 5 times\nof administration  and costs $2,000 per administration\nwith no promise of any reduction in manufacturing cost.\nThe drug thus costs $10,000 per useful case,  and is\nimplicated in a slight increase in mortality for some\npatients.\n\nI would not dare to compare the shuttle to Pennicillin,\nbut to centoxin.

I don't know the exact orbit numbers.\nI know when HST was first flown, it was placed in the Highest\npossible Shuttle orbit. \n\nNow the shuttle can cary a thing called the EDO pallet, or extended\nduration orbiter pallet.  It's mostly  LOX/LH for the fuel cells\nand RCS gear,  plus more O2  and canisters for the life support\nre-breathers.  maybe more nitrogen too.\n\nTHe limit on space-walking is a function of suit supplies (MASS)\nand Orbiter Duration.   \n\nIn order to perform the re-boost of the HST, the OMS engines\nwill be fired for a long period.  Now the shuttle is a heavy\nthing.  THe HST isn't light either.  THe amount of OMS fuel\nneeded to fly both up is substantial.   a small booster\ncarried up and used to boost HST on it's own will weigh significantly\nless then the OMS fuel required to Boost  both HST and SHUttle,\nfor a given orbital change.  \n\nFrom what i understand,  the mass margins on the HST missions are\ntight enough they can't even carry extra Suits or MMU's.\n\nNow if they used a small tug,  I would bet,  just a wild guess,\nthat the savings on amss margin  would allow carrying the\nEDO pallet,  extra suits,  more consumables,  parts for the\nflaky FGS sensor,  parts for the balky solar  electronics,\n\nand still enough for a double magnum of champagne.\n\nor the HST could even get placed into  some sort of medium orbit.\nThe reason they want a high orbit, is less antenna pointing,\nand longer drag life.\n\n\na\nWhatever it is,  the problem in the tilt array is a big constraint\non HST ops.
[ stuff deleted ]\n\nThe French SPOT is an example that comes to mind.  Although the\ncompany (name escapes me at the moment) sells images world-wide, you\ncan bet your last dollar (franc??) that the French gov't gets first\ndibs.\n\nI remember a few years ago (about the time SPOT was launched), I\nwas speaking to my Dad (an USAF officer) about this and that, and I\nhappend to mention SPOT (I think we were talking about technology\nutilization).  He just about went ballistic.  He wanted to know how I\nknew about SPOT and just what I knew.  I guess that space surveillance\nis such a sensitive topic in the Air Force that he couldn't believe\nthat I would read about such a system in the popular press (ie. AV week).\n\nmark,

It is interesting to note in the past few days' correspondance that some\nbelieve that poor old New Mexico is not capable of hosting a commercial\nspace launch business.  For many reasons, it can, and we here on the front\nlines see no reason why it should not.  The 'spaceport political publicity'\nreferred to the other day had its intended effect - the state of New Mexico\ndid establish the start of the necessary government infrastructure to back a\ncommercial space port.  The commanding general at WSMR is in full support of\ndual-use for the facilities.  The WSMR location also has some strategic\nadvantages in the form of necessary infrastructure and controlled air space\nto support the project.  Just because the folks involved have not done the\ntraditional aerospace-equivalent of vapor-ware by inviting folks out to kick\nnon-existent tires but have been merely doing their job to prepare for\nlaunch, don't think that nothing has happened.  From my interactions with\nthe MACDAC folks, I get the impression that they want to set a firm,\nbelievable launch date based on vehicle readiness and not just some fiction\nto plug a space on a calendar.  I believe that all will happen this summer\nand don't worry, the locals here are planning to let everyone know when it\ndoes occur.\nStephen Horan\nshoran@nmsu.edu

Okay, the earth has a magnetic field (unless someone missed something?)\n\nOkay if you put a object in the earth magnetic field, it produces electricty..\n\nNow the question. Can you use electricity to power a space/low earth orbit\nvehicle? and i fyou can, can you use the magnetic field of the earth to power\nit??\nCan the idea of a "dragless" satellite be used in part to create the electrical\nfield?\n\nAfter all the dragless satellite is (I might be wrong), a suspended between to\npilons, the the pilons compensate for drag..

For some reasons we humans think that it is our place to control\neverything.  I doubt that space advertising is any worse than any other\nkind advertising, but it will be a lot harder to escape, and is probably\nthe most blatant example yet of our disregard for the fact that we are \nnot in fact creaters of the universe.  Annoying little species, aren't we?
Wm Hathaway comments;\n\n\n\nI agree that the desire for beauty is valid, but I think your desire to\nimpose your vision of beauty is not.  You mention the age-old desire to\nsomehow get up there, but ignore the beauty of the actual achievment\nof that vision.  You mention the beauty of a very dark sky, not impeded\nby the effects of humans, but ignore the beauty of the as-dark-as-can-be\nsky that is only visible from space, a vision that we, or at least,\nour descendents, may one day be able to see, in part, because of efforts\nthat others call ugly.  One day, I hope, humans will be able to look out,\nnot upon half the heavens, with only nature-creted lights, but upon all\nof the heavens, with no lights.  If advertising in space can help us reach\nthat goal, it is no less beautiful for the way we reach it, than the\n'pristine' sky of yesteryear (or yester-century), which is totally\nunreachable.  One of the original conceptions of beauty in wetsern\nsculpture was a human form, in the effort of striving to reach a goal.\nI don't think there's any reason to believe that modernity has changed that,\njust because it has changed the way we strive.\n\nBTW, there are places that people haven't fouled.  Sometimes they make\nit better.\n\n-Tommy Mac\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTom McWilliams 517-355-2178 wk   \\ As the radius of vision increases,\n18084tm@ibm.cl.msu.edu 336-9591 hm \\ the circumference of mystery grows.
I think you've got an off-by-one error in your memory. :-)  MM bought the\nsatellite-building side of GE.  E, not D.  MM and GD are still competitors.\n\n\nBetter, yes, but we're not talking order of magnitude.  (Especially if you\nwant to use Titan IV, which belongs to the USAF, not MM.)\n\n\nSure, you can get a heavylift launcher fairly cheap if you do it privately\nrather than as a gummint project.  But we're still talking about something\nthat will cost nine digits per launch, unless you can guarantee a large\nmarket to justify volume production.

Yes, weightlessness does feel like falling.  It may feel strange at first,\nbut the body does adjust.  The feeling is not too different from that\nof sky diving.
>If this idea goes through, it's the thin end of the wedge.  Soon\n   >companies will be doing larger, and more permanant, billboards in the\n   >sky.  I wouldn't want a world a few decades from now when the sky\n   >looks like Las Vegas.  That would _really_ make me sad.\n\n   Think for a moment about the technology required to do that.  By \n   the time they could make the Earth's sky look like Las Vegas, \n   the people could afford to go backpacking on the Moon. Round\n   trip costs for 500 kg to the Moon would be about the same as\n   5000 kg in a Low Earth "advertising" orbit: Very roughly the\n   same cost as a smallish billboard, therefore. If such ads were\n   to become common place, that would have to be a very low price...\n\nThis is nonsense.  Its like saying that by the time commercials\non television become commonplace every citizen will have their own\nhour long nationally broadcast TV program.\n\n   There's always been a problem of having to get \n   away from civilization before you can really find "natural"\n   scenery. 100 years ago, this usually didn't take a trip\n   of over 5 miles. Today, most people would have to go 100 miles\n   or more. If we ever get to the point where we have billboards\n   on orbit, that essentially means that no place on Earth is still\n   "wild." While that may or may not be a good thing, the orbital\n   billboards aren't the problem: They are just a symptom of \n   growing, densely-populated civilization. Banning such ads will\n   not save your view of the night sky, because by the time \n   such ads could become widespread you will probably have trouble\n   finding a place without street lights, where you can _see_\n   the stars...\n\nThe rest of your post is strange mishmash of "its already really bad"\nand "it doesn't really matter if it gets worse."  You should try to\nfigure out what you are really arguing for.  (Kneejerk anti-environ-\nmentalism?)\n\n-david

You should have heard Prof. McNally , from my days as an astronomy\nundergraduate, denouncing photon pollution. It was easy to imagine him\ntaking practical steps to modify the sodium lamps on the street\noutside Mill Hill observatory with a 12-gauge shotgun :-)\n\nHowever, seriously, it is possible to limit the effects of\nstreetlights, by adding a reflector, so that the light only\nilluminates the ground, which is after all where you need it. As a\nbonus, the power consumption required for a given illumination level\nis reduced. Strangely enough, astronomers often seek to lobby elected\nlocal authorities to use such lighting systems, with considerable\nsuccess in the desert areas around the major US observatories. At\nleast, thats what McNally told us, all those years ago.\n( British local authorities couldn`t care less, as far as I can see )\n\nI suppose that the "right" to dark skies is no more than an aspiration,\nbut it is a worthwhile one. Illuminated orbital billboards seem especially\nyukky, and are presumably in the area of international law, if any, although\nI do find the idea of a right to bear anti-satellite weapons intriguing.
People who criticize "big Government" and its projects rarely seem to\nhave a consistent view of the role of Government in science and\ntechnology.  Basically, the U.S. Government has gotten into the role of\nsupporting research which private industry finds too expensive or too\nlong-term.  \n\n(Historically, this role for the U.S. Gov't was forced upon it because\nof socialism in other countries.  In order for U.S.  industries to\ncompete with government-subsidized foreign competitors, the U.S. Gov't\nhas taken on the role of subisizing big-ticket or long-lead R&D.)\n\nAs a Republican, I abhor the necessity for our Government to involve\nitself in technology this way.  I believe that market forces should\ndrive technology, and the world would be a better place for it.  But\nthe whole world would have to implement this concept simultaneously, or\nsome countries would have subsidized R&D, while others would not.  So\nthe U.S. must subsidize because everybody else does.  (This sounds a\nlot like the farm subsidies arguments behind our GATT negotiations,\ndoesn't it?)\n\nBut this role of Government subsidies is antithetical to\ncost-effectiveness.  The general idea is to spend money on new\ntechnology, and thereby maintain and promote our technological culture,\ndespite the forces in the business world (like the dreaded quarterly\nearnings report) which erode the ability of U.S. industry to invest in\nnew technology.  And since our goal is to spend money, it makes little\nsense to try to save money.\n\nOf course, we could always spend our money more wisely, but EVERYBODY\ndisagrees about that the wisdom should be.  \n\nIt's interesting to note that some of our best tools for cost control\navailable in industry today were derived from Government projects.\nGANTT charts, CP/M, and most of the modern scheduling software comes\nfrom DoD projects and their contractors.  The construction industry\nhas taken these tools to the core of their businesses; every large\nconstruction project now uses these tools.  \n\n-- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office\n      kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov  (713) 483-4368
Come on, this is sci.space.  An orbital billboard won't\ndo any permanent damage; in a few years it will reenter\nand probably hit Los Angles anyway :-)\n\nThe boost to space commerce orbital advertising might\nprovide might speed the day it is possible for those with a \nyen for dark skies to get some really dark skies beyond\nthe dust producing the zodiacal light. \n\nNow, if they wanted to paint the CocaCola symbol on the\nmoon in lampblack, that would give me pause.  It would\nbe very difficult to reverse such a widespread application\nof pigments.
Reboost may not be a problem, if they have enough fuel.  If they don't do a \nreboost this time, they will definitely have to do one on the next servicing\nmission.  But try to land a shuttle with that big huge telescope in the \nback and you could have problems.  The shuttle just isn't designed to land \nwith that much weight in the payload.\n\n\nof course that is a concern too, and the loss of science during the time\nthat it is on the ground.  plus a fear that if it comes down, some\nbig-wig might not allow it to go back up.  but the main concern, I\nbelieve is the danger of the landing.  Just to add another bad vibe,\nthey also increase the risk of damaging an instrument.  Finally, \nthis is a chance for NASA astronanuts to prove they could build and\nservice a space station.  Hubble was designed for in flight servicing.\n\nbringing the telescope down, to my understanding, was considered\neven very recently, but all these factors contribute to the \ndecision to do it the way it was planned in the beginning.\n\n\nROB\n-- \n===========================================================================\n===========================================================================\n\nDisclaimer-type-thingie>>>>>  These opinions are mine!

Well, I seem to have struck an  interesting discussion off.  Given that I\nam not an astrophysicist  or nuclear physicist,  i'll have to boil it\ndown a bit.\n\n1)  ALl the data on bursts to date,  shows a smooth random distribution.\n\n2)  that means they aren't concentrated in  galactic cores, our or someone\nelses.\n\n3) If the distribution is smooth,  we are either seeing some  ENORMOUSLY\nlarge phenomena  scattered at the edge of the universe  said phenomena\nbeing subject to debate almost as vioent as the phenomena\n	OR\nwe are seeing some phenomena  out at like the Oort cloud,  but then it needs\nsome potent little energy source,  that isn't detectable  by any other\ncurrent methods.\n\n4)  we know it's not real close,  like  slightly extra solar,  because\nwe have no parallax measurements on the bursts.\n\n5)  the bursts seem to bright to be something like black hole quanta or\nsuper string  impacts or something like that.\n\nSo everyone is watching the data and arguing like mad in the meanwhile.\n\nwhat i am wondering,  is this in people's opinion,  A NEW Physics problem.\n\nEinstein got well known for solvingthe photoelectric effect.   \n\nCopernicus,  started looking at  irregularities in planetary motion.\n\nIs this a big enough problem, to create a new area of physics?\njust a little speculative thinking folks.

You can do a whole hell of a lot better than 2 or 3 degrees with\nthe differential timing measurements from the interplanetary network.\nIgnore the directional information from BATSE; just look at the time\nof arrival.  With three detectors properly arranged, one can often\nget positions down to ~arc minutes.\n\nBTW, about Oort cloud sources: shouldn't this be testable in the\nfairly near future?  Some of the GRBs have very short rise times (< 1\nms).  We could detect the curvature of the burst wavefront out to a\ndistance of on the order of b^2/(t c) where b is the detector spacing\nand t the time resolution.  For t = 1 ms and b = 2 AU, this is on the\norder of 16 light years.  I understand statistics will reduce this\nnumber considerably, as would geometry if the burst is coming from the\nwrong direction.
This is a good question.  There are major blind spots in our understanding\nof what makes the earth habitable.  For example, why does the earth's\natmosphere have the concentration of oxygen it does?  The naive\nanswer is "photosynthesis", but this is clearly incomplete.  Photosynthesis\nby itself can't make the atmosphere oxygenated, as the oxygen produced\nis consumed when the plants decay or are eaten.  What is needed\nis photosynthesis plus some mechanism to sequester some fraction of\nthe resulting reduced material.\n\nOn earth, this mechanism is burial in seafloor sediments of organic\nmatter, mostly from oceanic sources.  However, this burial requires\ncontinental sediments (in the deep ocean, the burial rate is so slow\nthat most material is consumed before it can be sequestered).\n\nThis suggests that a planet without large oceans, or a planet without\ncontinents undergoing weathering, will have a hard time accumulating\nan oxygen atmosphere.  In particular, an all-ocean planet may have a\nhard time supporting an oxygen atmosphere.\n\nThere is also the problem of why the oxygen in the earth's atmosphere\nhas been relatively stable over geological time, for a period at least\n2 orders of magnitude longer than the decay time of atmospheric O2 to\nweathering in the absence of replenishment.  No convincing feedback\nmechanism has been identified.  Perhaps the reason is the weak\nanthropic principle: if during the last 500 MYr or so, the oxygen\nlevel had dropped too low, we wouldn't be here to be wondering about\nit.
Forwarded from the Mars Observer Project\n\n                       MARS OBSERVER STATUS REPORT\n                             April 30, 1993\n                              11:30 AM PDT\n\nDSS-65 (Madrid 34 meter antenna) did not acquire the expected Mars Observer\nSpacecraft signal at the scheduled beginning of track yesterday morning (4/29)\nat approximately 6:00 AM.  Indications were that the spacecraft had entered a\nFault Protection mode sometime between that time and receipt of normal\ntelemetry at the end of the previous station pass (DSS-15 - Goldstone 34\nmeter antenna) at approximately 8:00 PM the evening before.  Entry into\nContingency Mode was verified when signal was reacquired and telemetry\nindicated that the spacecraft was sun coning.  After subsystem engineers\nreported all systems performing nominally, fault protection telemetry modes\nwere reconfigured and memory readouts of command system Audit Queue and\nAACS (Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem) Starex performed.  These\nreadouts verified that Contingency Mode entry occurred shortly after 1:30 AM\nyesterday, 4/29/93.  Preliminary indications are that a Sun Ephemeris Check\nfailure triggered fault protection.  However, the Flight Team will be\ndetermining the precise cause over the next few days.\n\nAs of last evening, the spacecraft had been commanded back to Inertial\nReference and was stable in that mode.  The Flight Team is planning to\ncommand the spacecraft back to Array Normal Spin state today.

We are interested in constructing a reentry vehicle to be deployed from a\ntether attached to an orbiting platform.  This will be a follow on to our\nsuccesful deployment of a 20 kilometer tether on the March 29 flight of\nSEDS (Small Expendable Deployment System), which released an instrumented\npayload that reentered the earth's atmosphere and burned up over the west\ncoast of Mexico.  This time we want to make a payload that can be recovered.\nWe want to build it from "off the shelf" technology so as to do this as\nquickly and inexpensively as possible.  We want to be able to track the\npayload after it has deployed its parachute.  An idea we have is to put the\nsame kind of radio beacon on it that is used with SARSATs (Search and Rescue\nSatellites).  It would turn on with the opening of the parachute and aid in\ntracking.  These beacons are known in the marine industry as EPIRBs\n(Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon).  They are rugged (they have to\nbe to survive a ship wreck!) and cheap.  We have several questions:\n\n1.  What is the world authority regulating the use of SARSAT beacons.  Are\nthere multiple authorites, i.e. military and civilian?\n\n2.  What are the regulations regarding the use of SARSAT signals.  Can they\nbe used for one of a kind situations with a long lead time of warning the\nrelevant authorities, or are they strictly reserved for life threatening\nemergencies?\n\n3.  What is the coverage of SARSATS?  Are they in LEO with only intermittant\ncoverage of a fixed position on the earth, or are they in geosynchronous\norbit?\n\n4.  Is there an industry organization governing the use and manufacture of\nthese transponders?\n\nPlease post replies here or send E-mail to me at:\n	fennell@well.sf.ca.us\nThanak you very much for any assistance you can provide.
Re; Response from CoB of Boeing on SSTO ...\n  \n   Boeing has been looking at several TSTO vehicles and has carried\nout extensive conceptual studies of advanced launch systems for some\ntime.  A good reference on this might be: "Comparison of Propulsion\nOptions for Advanced Earth-To-Orbit (ETO) Applications (IAF-92-\n0639)." by V.A. Weldon and L.E. Fink from Boeing.   The paper\ndescribes a propane-fueled TSTO launch system claimed to achieve\naircraft-like operational efficiencies without the problems\nassociated with liquid hydrogen fuel.  Basically, it's a high-speed\nairplane launching a Hermes-type spaceplane\n   The design (the concept is also called "Beta") as laid out in the\npaper can launch at least 10,000 pounds into polar orbit, or 20,000\npounds to space station orbit including a crew of eight persons and\nlife support.  System design reliability is .9995.\n   Beta is a 360-foot-long first stage powered by two large ramjets\nand 12 high- speed civil transport (HSCT) turbofans.  A 108-foot-\nlong reusable orbiter is trapeze-mounted in the belly of the first-\nstage aircraft, which also could accommodate a longer and heavy\npayload on an expendable second stage.\n   To launch the orbital vehicle, the first stage takes off like a\nnormal HSCT and accelerates to Mach 3.  At that point the turbofans,\nmodified to burn catalyzed JP-7, would shut off and the ramjets,\nwould take over.  At Mach 5.5 the orbiter or the ELV would swing\nout, ignite and proceed to orbit. Both vehicles would land like\naircraft at the conclusion of their respective missions.\n   Estimated total weight of the combined configuration at takeoff\nis about 1.5 M lbs, roughly equivalanet to a fully loaded An-225.\nThe orbiter stages weighs about 400,Klbs including 335 Klbs\nof LOX and subcooled propane to power two 250 Klbs vacuum thrust\nrocket engines. Propellants would be stored at 91 degrees Kelvin,\nwith the propane in a spherical tank mounted forward of the 15-by-\n25-foot cargo bay and the two-seat orbiter crew station. LOX would\nbe stored aft.  Weldon and Fink claim the key to this design's\nsuccess is the structurally efficient airframe and the compact\ntankage allowed by the high-density supercooled hydrocarbon fuel.\n     The paper compares TSTO design to SSTO design.  They conclude\nwhile a SSTO has a slightly lower recurring cost, a TSTO is easier,\ncheaper, and less risky to develop, simpler to build, has greater\nsafety and mission versatility and doesn't carry the hard-to-handle\nand bulky hydrogen fuel. The conlcude "In conjunction with its major\nuse of airplane type engines and fuel, as well as its inherent self-\nferry capability, it is probably the system most likely to provide\nas close to airline-like operations as possible with a practical\nconfiguration, until a single stage airbreather/rocket concept can\nbe shown to be operationally viable."\n  \n   Weldon and others at Boeing have been working on TSTO designs for\nsome time.  I expect this, or a similar concept (perhaps the HTHL\nSSTO they proposed for the SDIO SSTO first phase) is being re-\nexamined as a basis for a bid on the first phase of SpaceLifter.\n   Does it threaten DC-???.  Possibly -- There is a set of on-going\nstudies trying straighten out the government's future space\ntransportation strategy.  MDC and Boeing (as well as other firms)\nare providing data to a joint study team back in DC.  There are\nvarious factions and options vying for attention -- including\nshuttle upgrades, shuttle replacement (what was called the "4-2-3"\narchitecture), SpaceLifter, ELV upgrades, and various advanced\nvehicles (ALES, Beta, DC-??, NASP, FSTS, SSTOs of several types,\netc.)  NASA/DOD/DOT are trying to put together a coherent strategy\nfor future US gov't space transportation systems, and trying to\njuggle near-term launch needs (like for DoD and NASA) against\nmedium-term needs (including commercial considerations), and against\nthe investment and risk of going to "leap frog" new technologies\nlike SDIO/SSTO and NASP and Beta.\n   It's a heck of a problem.  The worst part of the problem isn't\nthat there aren't promising ideas and concepts -- there are dozens\nof them -- but how they balance cost and risk versus real needs in\nthe near term.  They should have a draft report in mid-June, with a\nfinal report coming by the end of the fiscal year.\n ------------------------------------------------------------------\n Wales Larrison                           Space Technology Investor
Dale sez;\n\nI don't buy it.  If the things had no value at all, people wouldn't\nspend money to make them.

"I bought this house, out in\nthe boondocks, specifically to enjoy my hobby, amateur astronomy.

I know its semantics, but the "no-op" _doesn't_ do anything.  The\nCommand Loss Timer is simply looking for a command, any command.  A\n"no-op" is simply a spacecraft command that drops bits into the big\nbit bucket in the sky.  "No-op" also get used as timekeepers to provide\nmillisecond delays between command sequences (used on the thruster preps\non GRO, er, Compton) and to verify command links at the beginning of\nTDRS events.  All in all, a rather useful command.  And, an intelligent\nFDC test on Galileo (the Command Loss Timer).
There are a number of Philosophical questions that I would like to ask:\n\n1)  If we encounter a life form during our space exploration, how do we\ndetermine if we should capture it, imprison it, and then discect it?\n\n2)  If we encounter a civilization that is suffering economicly, will\nwe expend resources from earth to help them?\n\n3)  With all of the deseases we currently have that are deadly and undetectable,\nwhat will be done to ensure that more new deadly deseases aren't brought\nback, or that our deseases don't destroy life elsewhere?\n\n\n\n-- \nHave a day,

I guess it's  kind of an aesthetics argument.\n\nI can see the solar arrays being expensive,  and  there could be\ncontingencies where you would be throwing away brand new\nsolar cells,   but  it seems so cheap compared toa shuttle\nmission, i wouldn't think they would bother.
Only if he doesn't spend more than a billion dollars doing it, since the\nprize is not going to be scaled up to match the level of effort.  You can\nspend a billion pretty quickly buying Titan launches.\n\nWhat's more, if you buy Titans, the prize money is your entire return on\ninvestment.  If you develop a new launch system, it has other uses, and\nthe prize is just the icing on the cake.\n\nI doubt very much that a billion-dollar prize is going to show enough\nreturn to justify the investment if you are constrained to use current\nUS launchers.  (There would surely be a buy-American clause in the rules\nfor such a prize, since it would pretty well have to be government-funded.)\nYou're going to *have* to invest your front money in building a new launch\nsystem rather than pissing it away on existing ones.  Being there first is\nof no importance if you go bankrupt doing it.\n\n\nI'm sure Spar would offer to develop such a lunar-tuned system and deliver\na couple of them to you for only a couple of hundred million dollars.

Well, here goes.\n\nThe first item of business is to establish the importance space life\nsciences in the whole of scheme of humankind.  I mean compared\nto football and baseball, the average joe schmoe doesn't seem interested\nor even curious about spaceflight.  I think that this forum can\nmake a major change in that lack of insight and education.\n\nAll of us, in our own way, can contribute to a comprehensive document\nwhich can be released to the general public around the world.  The\ndocument would scientifically analyze the technical aspects of long\nterm human habitation in space.\n\nI believe that if any long-term space exploration program is to \nsucceed we need to basically learn how to engineer our own microworld\n(i.e. the spacecraft).  Only through the careful analyses of engineering,\nchemical, biological, and medical factors will a good ecosystem be created\nto facilitate human life on a long-duration flight.\n\nSo, I would like to see posts of opinions regarding the most objective\nmethods to analyze the accepted scientific literature for technologies\nwhich can be applied to long-duration spaceflight.  Such a detailed\nliterature search would be of interest to ourselves as space advocates\nand clearly important to existing space programs.\n\nIn essence, we would be dividing the space life science issues into\nvarious technical problems which could be solved with various technologies.\nThis database of acceptable solutions to various problems could form the\nbasis of detailed discussions involving people from the bionet, isunet,\nand any other source!
Teflon? A contribution from the space program? Since the French were using\nTeflon on household items in the early 1950's, it is unlikely that it was\ninvented by NASA. As for pacemakers and calculators, again those are\nanecdotally connected with NASA.
I have to agree with Ward.  The problem with your approach is they add\nup what you can reasonably claim as 'spin-offs', add up what's been\nspent on space, and then come back with something like, "You spent $X\nbillion for that?  Wouldn't it be better just to spend the money on\ndirect research and forget all this space stuff?  We could have got\nall that stuff a *lot* cheaper that way.  Space is wasteful and\ninefficient."\n\nThen they cancel your funding and spend it studying mating rituals of\nNew Guinea tribesmen or something.\n\n-- \n"Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live\n in the real world."   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden

Having read in the past about the fail-safe mechanisms on spacecraft, I had\nassumed that the Command Loss Timer had that sort of function.  However I\nalways find disturbing the oxymoron of a "NO-OP" command that does something.\nIf the command changes the behavior or status of the spacecraft it is not\na "NO-OP" command.\n\nOf course this terminology comes from a Jet Propulsion Laboratory which has\nnothing to do with jet propulsion.\n\n--
Being wierd again, so be warned:\n\nIs there a plan to put a satellite around each planet in the solar system to\nkeep watch? I help it better to ask questions before I spout an opinion.\n\nHow about a mission (unmanned) to Pluto to stay in orbit and record things\naround and near and on Pluto.. I know it is a strange idea, but why not??\nIt could do some scanning of not only Pluto, but also of the solar system,\nobjects near and aaroundpluto, as well as SETI and looking at the galaxy\nwithout having much of the solar system to worry about..

I'll vote for anything where they don't feel constrained to use stupid\nand ugly PC phrases to replace words like 'manned'.  If they think\nthey need to do that, they're more than likely engaging in 'politics\nand public relations as usual' rather than seriously wanting to\nactually get into space.  So that eliminates Option "A" from the\nrunning.  What do they call a manned station in Option "C"?\n\n[I'm actually about half serious about that.

They can be detached in an emergency.

The main effect of the spherical aberration problems with the\nprimary mirror was to drive the computer engineers to develop the image\nprocessing software that much faster.

There is every reason to believe that the results will \n_exceed_ the original specs by a fair margin.  \n\nAdaptive optics is a combination of hardware and software.  It works \nrealtime, not after the fact, as is the case with Hubble.

The article states: "The AO-2 Adaptive Optics System \ncomes in a handy soft-plastic case that a three-year-old could carry \naround."  Even though this device is really only good for the brightest\nobjects, "it could cope with image movements of up to 0.8 millimeter\nin the telescope's focal plane."

Regarding drag free satellites, Joe Cain gives a good description of the concept.  It is however more than a concept.  The Navy's Triad satellite succesfully used drag free control.

I too am a Jules Verne collector, and can tell you that though tough \nto find, it *is* out there.

I don't know if the book\nstore situation near JSC is as good as the Bay Area, but good luck.\nI have also had excellent luck at the Antiquarian Book Fair which comes\nto SF every other year, though the prices are more in the $100-$200 range\nthan the $50 you want to spend.  My guess is that *if* you find it,\nyou won't need to spend even that much, since most people don't care \nabout it.  I think I paid about $15 for my dust-jacket-less but otherwise\ngood condition copy, which I found one day at a small bookshop that happened\nto have just bought a lot of random books at an estate sale.  \n\nOf course, if you re willing to buy blind, you can put a $2 advertisement\nin the Antiquarian Bookseller's newsletter (the exact title of which escapes\nme at the moment.)  _Five Weeks in a Balloon_ is not the rarest of Jules\nVerne books.
