I have an old Optonica tuner and integrated amp that I no longer\nuse.  The integrated amp section does not work right now but should\nnot cost much to fix.  I believe that it is just a Chip.  I have \nused it as a preamp and it works great!\n\nThis is a very nice looking and well built set.  They both are low \nprofile but the amp is rather heavy.\n\nThe tuner is in fine working condition and is a match to the amp.\n\nThe amp is rated at 75w/ch.\n\nThese peices went for about $850 New.\n\nI would like to get $150.  obo  for the pair. \n\nIf anybody has knowledge anough to fix the amp, I have had an estimate\ndone that it should cost less than $50 in parts.\n\nPlease email me if you are interested.  I will be moving back home for\nthe summer and will sell it back there if I do not do so here.\n\nTodd
Hmmm... Interesting. What do you mean by WALKING distance? I lived in\nMoscow for 21 years, and if I am 5 minutes walk to Belorusskaya\nsubway station, I CANNOT be walking distance to Kremlin. Unless\n1 hour of walking is what you mean. By the way, what is\nthe price? I may plan a trip there (not sure yet, though) in\nlate summer.

"Jack Previdi" <p00020@psilink.com> writes, in reply to Dorothy Heydt\nreminding us that advertising is not done on Internet:\n\n	   As a matter of fact D.J., it does make a difference.\n	   Almost a half million new users joined the Internet last year,\n	   many of them are commercial businesses. The ban on commercial\n	   use of Internet is no more.\n\nJack, there is a difference between using the network for commercial\npurposes and advertising in newsgroups.  Business communication is\nokay.  Advertising to hundreds of thousands of users around the planet\nwho have no desire to receive advertising is not okay.\n\n	   Those of us who pay for Internet access are constrained only\n	   by our innate good taste and no have no "administrator" to \n	   guide(?) us.\n\nI suspect that a site which generated a large volume of material not\nin anybody's good taste would find itself getting a lot of attention\nit didn't want.  You may belong to the public library, but that\ndoesn't mean you can deface the books, disorder the stacks, or disturb\nthe other patrons.\n\nYou're constrained by the same rules that the rest of the users (many\nacademic and military, who get irritable about a network for which\nthey pay with tax and grant money carrying private business\nadvertising) follow.  There are Secret Masters here, just like\neverywhere else.  They're not as obvious as the ones on Prodigy, but\nthey're here.\n\nNo doubt at some point the Internet, like everything else, will become\ngrotty enough to carry advertising.  At that time I hope it is\nconfined to its own newsgroups and not on discussion groups---like\nmisc.writing.
********************[ PC Game For Sale ]******************\n\nWaxworks by Horrorsoft/Accolade (5.25")		   $30\n\nBy the same folks who brought you Elvira I & II.  I played\nElvira I & II, and think that Horrorsoft has finally made\na very playable game with Waxworks.  The look and feel is\nroughly the same as in the Elvira games, though the real time\nfighting is a little easier to survive.  The first two games,\nespecially Elvira II: Jaws of Cerberus made it very tough to\nstay alive and hit-point restoring was very difficult.  This \nis not to say that Waxworks is a walk in the park, but it is\nquite fair, in that there is always some weapon to be found\nthat is quite effective, or hint given as to the proper fighting\nstrategy.  In one of the four wax works to be explored, there is \nno fighting at all (well almost none), though all four contain\nmoderately challanging puzzles.\n\nThe really interesting thing about this game is that it is really \nbroken up into four seperate RPGs, one for each of the four exhibits\nyou must enter.  In starting each one, your character is transported\nwith no objects to use, and experience level 1.  One exhibits traps\nyou inside a multi-level ancient Egyptian pyramid which you must \nescape by fighting, mapping and puzzle solving.  Another exhibit\ntraps you in a mine that has been taken over by creeping plant vines\nand pods, while the local humans have been transformed into plant\nzombies.  This is a single level maze that requires you to rescue\nsome humans, kill the head plant alien, and figuere out how to kill\nthe very tuff plant zombies that are always showing up.  This is\nperhaps the most horrifying exhibit.  Another exhibit puts you into\nJack The Ripper England where you appear by the corpse of a fresh Ripper\nvictim, and of course the police think you are responsible.  You must\navoid police and angry mobs to unravel the mystery of The Ripper and \nmeet him face to face - but first get a disquise.  The last exhibit\npus you in a graveyard where most of the challenge is in learning to \nstop the almost indestructible zombies.  \n\nOver all the VGA graphics and music are very effective in setting a \ncreepy tone for the game, as was the case for the Elvira games, though\ngameplay is much improved and makes for a much more enjoyable game.\nI heartily recommend it for RPG and Horror fans.   \n\n*********************************************************\n\n- All prices include shipping.\n- All games are in excellent condition unless otherwise stated.\n- US buyers only please.\n- All games will be shipped inside a box with packing, insured,\n  priority USPS.\n- All games include all original materials including box, manual,\n  disks, and registration unless otherwise noted.\n\nThe first responder offering asking price is guarenteed to\nget the game.  Those just asking questions get no priority until\nthey offer to buy the game.  Lower offers may be considered\nassuming no other offers at asking price are made.\n\n**********************************************************

Hi, everyone;\n\n\nI need an advice on what is the best way to get a scumster.\n\nSeveral weeks ago I posted an article on behalf of a friend who wanted\nan external HD for mac. The scumster - R.E.P. - called my friend and\nthey agreed on a price. My friend (unexperienced and not too fluent in\nEnglish) paid by check, requesting R.E.P. to call him back when the check\narrives and the HD is send. Well, the check was cashed 3/24 and that is\nthat. Phone # that R.E.P. gave is on the answering machine all the time\nand there is no reaction when the message is left; e-mail address does not\nbounce but again there is no answer. I know, that R.E.P. is a student at\nUniversity of Delaware; I have his e-mail address, his US postal address\nand his (?) phone#. The question is: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO PROCEED?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice.\n\nSincerely,\nVictor Levenson (VVL2H@virginia.edu)\n\nP.S. The reason I did not put R.E.P.'s full name is that I still hope...\n\n\nP.P.S. If I get enough responses I will post a summary, maybe even on a\nregular basis.\n\nVL\n--\n====================================

I was\nnot able to stop them and now I have a package which I do not need.\n\nNishika 3D camera, wide angle flesh, film, carring case, instruction\ntapes, and some jewelrys.\n\n3 vacation vouchers to Bahama, Cancun, Las Vegas, Orlando.\n\nI paid $697 for the promotion package, and the vacation vouchers\ncame as gift. I really want to sell them, so make me an offer for\nthe whole package. If you are participating in a award, $697 is how\nmuch you would end up paying. And I strongly believe that you would\nget the same award as I do. If you are interested in those items,\nyou could get them from me for a cheaper price.\n\nLet me know, and make me an offer. No flames please, I have got enough.\n\nYou could reach me at koutd@hirama.hiram.edu

not only is it improper etiquette AND illegal but the people who\nare responsible for junk mailings are *EVIL*!!!!
I don't want him nuked, I want him to be honest.  The junk mail has\nbeen much more interesting than the promised catalog.  If I'd known\nwhat I was going to get, I wouldn't have hesitated.  I wouldn't be\nsurprised if there were other folks who looked at the ad and said\n"nope" but who would be very interested in the junk mail that results.\nSimilarly, there are people who wanted the advertised catalog who\naren't happy with the junk they got instead.\n\nThe folks buying the mailing lists would prefer an honest ad, and\nso would the people reading it.\n\n-andy

I would like to sell my dot matrix printer so I can upgrade to inkjet.\nIt is a "Panasonic KX-P1124 24 pin Multi-Mode Printer".  Here are the\nstats (from memory and the manual):\n\n-  360x360 dot-printing for hi-res graphics, etc.\n-  VERY fast (up to 192 cps) printing in "printer-controlled" (as\n	opposed to Windows driver-controlled) printing\n-  Bidirectional printing for faster processing speed\n-  5 fonts ("courier","prestige","bold ps","script","sans serif")\n-  Epson LQ-2500 and IBM Proprinter X24 printer emulation\n-  Can accept single sheets, envelopes, and 3 non-carbon copies by\n	friction feed\n-  Front or bottom paper feed\n-  6KB buffer\n\nI will send a sample document and a printed GIF/JPEG file to anyone\nwho wishes to send a SASE.  With purchase (prepaid, please!), I will\ninclude the following accessories:\n\n-  Manual\n-  cable (Centronics)\n-  remaining stack of tractor-fed paper (about .4")\n-  FREE copy of Windows printer driver (unless this is illegal, or if\n	it is included with Windows)\n-  FREE unregistered DOS shareware program ($2 registration, I think)\n	that apparently offers some word processing capabilities\n	from DOS\n\nThe last two will be on a disk (either size).  I am asking for around\n$165, but I am open to any (reasonable) offers.  I am a college\nstudent, so I cannot afford to buy a new printer without getting a\nconsiderable portion of the money from this printer.  This price\nincludes all above items, and shipping (probably UPS) is included as\nwell.  I have the original box, but only one of the original Styrofoam\nend pieces.  I will use a towel on the other end (you get a free towel\ntoo!!).  Worked fine getting it here.  The whole shebang might not fit\nin the original box; I will figure this out after the offers come in.\nEmail any questions and offers.		-Jon.

I'll third the opinion about this outfit/franchise. Now, when I\nbuy over the net and pick up the shipping costs, I'll specify that I\nonly pick up the normal UPS charges (as if delivered directly to\nUPS), as I've been burned by $10 shipping charges for a $2.49 pkg.\nI will never use a mailing service unless I don't have the\nright box and the buyer needs whatever IMMEDIATELY. I'll also\ntell the person, if they agreed to pick up shipping, what is going on.\n\nOther things to watch out for/consider:\n\n	The rates are $5 to $30 higher than UPS direct.\n\n	For a non-UPS (truck) package, they quoted a rate\n	of $85. Fed Ex economy air was only $85 for the\n	same weight! RPS (a trucking package company, in many\n	cities) only wanted $18. Guess who got it. The Mailbox\n	operator told me I was not telling the truth about\n	competitors' rates, said RPS was unreliable (I've used them\n	before with NO problems), etc. Right.\n\n	A COD check goes to the mailing service. Our local\n	Mailbox then takes its sweet time mailing me the\n	remade check. All this for an additional $3.00 over the\n	UPS COD charge. What a deal.... :-)\n\n	For packages over $100, they charge you about double over\n	what UPS charges them for insurance. I've never had\n	a claim, but other netters (is Ralph Seguin out there?)\n	have told horror stories about them...\n\n	All package traces have to be done through Mailbox by\n	Mailbox.\n\n	Our local Mailbox operator told me I was lying when I\n	asked him why their rates were stratospheric compared\n	to direct UPS. Does he ever check? Probably not...\n\n	Their UPS ground rates come close to Fed Ex's economy\n	air rate, and Fed Ex will pick up!\n\n	UPS will pick up for a $5 charge in most areas!\n	\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Dave Medin			Phone:	(205) 730-3169 (w)\n    SSD--Networking				(205) 837-1174 (h)\n    Intergraph Corp.\n       M/S GD3004 		Internet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.com\n  Huntsville, AL 35894		UUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin\n\n   ******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) *******

Items for sale.....\n\nThis package was bought throught a award give-away company. I attempted\nto cancel my order before I received the package, but I was too late and\nthe company refused to take the package back for refund. I know the truth\nwhich I would never get my $697 back, but I wish to get my money back as\nclose as possible. Here is the describtion of the package...\n\nNishika 3D camera	It takes very good picture, never been opended\n			or used. It came with wide angle flesh, carring\n			case, film, and a instruction video. It has four\n			lens and created a 3D effect on a regular 35mm\n			film.\n\nJewelry			It came with the package as additional gift.\n\nBahama vacation voucher	The voucher is good for two RT airfare to Freeport.\n			The users get a special hotel rate of $27 per-person\n			per-night. Meals, ground transfer, hotel tax is\n			_not_ included.\n\nLas Vegas, Reno, Orlando	The voucher provides one RT airfare, and\n				hotel accomodation for 3 days/ 2 nights.\n				Meals, ground transfer, hotel tax is not\n				included. The voucher is good for all 3\n				locations, but you can't travel to all 3\n				places at once.\n\nCancun, Mexico		The voucher provides one RT airfare, and hotel\n			accomodation for 3 days / 2 nights. Meals and\n			ground transfer, hotel tax is not included as\n			usual.\n\nI paid $697 for the whole package. So try not to be cold-blooded when you\nmake your offer. Details would be provided by request. I do wish to sell\nthe whole package at once. So if you are just looking for the vacation\nvouchers, I don't care if you sell the camera to other for a higher pric\nIf you are interested in the camera, you could treat the vacation vouchers\nas gift.\n\nIf you receive a letter in your mail box which says that you are selected\nto be part of the sweeptake and you have at least one out of five awards. \nTrust me, you would get the exactly the same package as I did. There is \nonly one award which will be given away. So don't bother even to call them \nback, if you are really interested, you could get it from me for a cheaper \nprice. And you could receive the package within a week ( I waited three \nmonths to get my first and final packages). Also, they would ask for your\ncredit card number and you have to pay for the interest to the credit \ncard company. So why spend more than you should when you could get them\nfrom me for a cheaper price.\n\nIf you are interested, please reply to me as soon as posible. I really\nwish to get this over with. Make me an offer, if I am confortable with\nyour offer, I would send the package by U.P.S. the next day morning.\nMore details could be given if you wish.\n\nPlease contact me at koutd@hirama.hiram.edu
^^^^^^^^\n\nWell, I'm not sure I'd go quite that far, but I agree that Motorola\ngear is of better quality.  The question is how much that quality\nis worth to a ham in amateur service, not commercial service\n\n\nOk, great. But how often does that come up?  How good is\n"good enough", and how much is someone willing to pay for it?\nA good ham-quality HT is maybe $500, while a commercial\nquality one is maybe $2000. Is the increased reliability and\nperformance worth 4 times the price *in amateur service*?\nOnly the individual involved can answer that question, and each\nham has to decide for him/herself.  If Motorola quality is worth\n4 times the price to you, then more power to ya'. But I'm amazed\nthat folks make that choice. For, me, given that I've got $2000 to\nspend, I'l pick the Yaesu ht and a nice new HF rig every time over\na Motorola ht alone, no matter how good it is.  To me, ham-quality\ngear is "good enough". To each his own...\n\n73... Mike, N4PDY

I recently upgraded to a 486 and have found out I don't really have a need\nfor my old 386.  I'd prefer to sell just the motherboard and keep the case\netc, so I'll offer the motherboard and case separately and let you decide.\n\nI'm asking $325 for the motherboard, which has:\n    25Mhz 386 DX (not SX)\n    8 megabytes of 32-bit, 70ns memory\n    AMI BIOS\n    based on C&T NEAT chipset\n    	(this means the motherboard and bus circuitry timings are\n	programmable - the BIOS' advanced configuration menus let you\n	select system, DMA, bus clock, wait states, command delays, etc.)\n    "baby AT" sized - fits in mini-tower, full-sized or most any other case\n(Includes User's Guide and a copy of the BIOS reference manual)\n\nFor $150 more you could have the rest of the system too:\n    full-size AT case with 200(?) watt power supply\n    2 serial, 1 parallel, 1 game ports\n    20Mb hard disk\n    1.2Mb floppy disk\n    keyboard\n    video card (choice of VGA or ???)\n\nIf you're interested, please give me a call.

Fellow netters,\n\nI just wanted to let you know that there are a few honest and good people out\nthere (even outside of Iowa).  I'm sorry if anyone thinks that I am wasting\nspace, but I thought you might want some relief from the "So-and-so is a thief"\nposts.  Not that I think we shouldn't hear about the bad deals, but it would be\nnice to hear some good news once in a while.\n\nAfter seeing his post on one of the for sale groups, I mailed Mr. Mark Miller a\nrequest for his copy of WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS.  He suggested a price of $50\nin his ad, but when I phoned him, he quoted $40 plus shipping.  That sounded\nmore than fair to me, so I told him that I would send him a check the next day. \nImagine my surprise when I logged into my account the following day and found a\nmessage from him saying that it had already been sold (after I had just mailed\nthe money order).  After another E-Mail message to him, he apologized and\nassured me that it was a mistake - I was the one who he was holding it for.  He\nsent the package as soon as he got the money, along with a letter stating a\ntransfer of license.  This wasn't good enough for WordPerfect, so I asked him\nto fill out one of their forms.  No problem - we thought.  It took three times\nto get it to the right address (my fault).  Anyway, he mailed me the form for\nmy signature and included a Workbook that I had no idea was included in the\ndeal.  Again, he apologized for not sending it before.  I now have the world's\nbest word processor and a renewed hope in the world that there are a few good\nones left.  I recoend that if you ever see that Mark is selling anything thatat\nyou may want, give him a call.  If I had the choice, I would purchase all of my\nsoftware from him.\n\nBravo, Mr. Miller!

The front covers should be available from Sony.  Check with a local car\nstereo shop.  You will probably (definitely) have to provide the units \nserial number and hopefully you had registered the warranty card.  I \ndon't know the cost, but replacements have to be available to people\nwho damage the face cover, so it stands to reason that it can be replaced.\n\nAs to deterring theft:\n\nWhen I worked for a stereo shop, we referred the customer to a Sony 800\nnumber.  We would not sell the face, nor did we have them available.  Most\npeople who came in asking for the face cover (or a pullout sleave for that\nmatter) would look very disheartened to find that they acquired a deck\nthey couldn't use.  If theft occurs with these decks, notify Sony.  Serial\nnumbers do catch theives.
Hi,\n\n	I have a Humminbird HDR200 Depth Sounder for sale. It\nhas been used for 1 season on my sailboat. \n	\n	All parts are included as well as the installation\ninstructions. It is even packed in the original box it came in. There\nis no damage to the unit or the transducer. In fact, the transducer\nwas mounted *inside* the hull in a piece of pipe glued to the hull.\nSo it led a "sheltered" life. The transducer can be mounted either inside\nthe hull as I did, or on the transom. It cannot be placed in a hole\ndrilled into your hull.\n\n	It is fully waterproof and fits into a 2" hole in a bulkhead\n(that's where I had it installed) or into a standard dashboard on a\npowerboat. It reads depth to 199' and has a backlit LCD display. It has\nan adjustable shallow water alarm built in. \n\n	I am changing out my instruments to another manufacturer that\noutputs the NMEA 0183 information. This little depth sounder works fine\nand is very stable.\n\n\n	It is usually priced as low as 130$ in some catalogs, I paid 150$.\n\n\n	The first 80$ takes it, or best offer. \n\n\n\n				John R.

Just to inform the readers of newsrc Sony has just introduced a new DATman,\nthe TCD-D7 which is smaller and less expensive than the D3.  Also, the D7\nhas a coaxial jack which the D3 lacks.  Oh, the D3 has always been\navailable through mail-order houses for less than $700 dollars new... with\nthe new model coming out, I suspect the now obsolete D3 will be selling for \neven less.

This is the final public update to my dragon magazine auction.  If there\nare no new bids then the current bids stand (like that's gonna  happen.  :) ).\nAfter this, any updates will be by E-mail *ONLY*.  The entire auction \nwill end as soon as the bids stop coming in.  So if you want to get in\non  this, be sure to bid now.  All bids must be made in *AT LEAST*\n25 cent increments.  Buyer will pay shipping.  (Unless you have any\nparticular fancy, it will be US mail 4th class special, with lots of\npadding).  \nAll dragons are bagged.  The condition of them vary quite a bit, \nso I've come up with my own condition system.  Some dragons may be missing \nitems like the inserts.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask.\n*\nCondition ratings - Usually this is just an evaluation of the cover, as\nmost of the material inside is in great shape.\nExcellent - IE-"As you find them in the store"\nVery Good - Still in great condition, but can tell it's been boughten\nGood      - On down the line\nVery Fair/fair - indicates lots of use (But still "decent")\nPoor      -  Indicates the material inside may be damaged (usually by\nscissors).  \nA * by the condition indicates that something from the magazine is \nmissing (usually the insert)\nI'll post another public update sometime this weekend (which will be the\nfinal public posting, after which the auction will be by e-mail until\nthe bidding stops)\n*\nAgain if you have any questions, ask away.\n*\narrow      $2.50 056 -

Good point, but I was just thinking.. I wanted to sell my HP28sx\ncalculator here in this newsgroup... It is called a calculator, but really\nit is a computer, albeit a small one, but it does function as one... How\ncome car adds are acceptable? They cant run without computers nowadays....\nWhere does one draw the line? Accept it, live with it, and if you care to,\navoid it.... \njonathan
I recently backed out of purchasing an almost-unused Sony TCD-D3 DAT\nWalkman, having found someone else who has a unit I personally prefer (and am\npaying more for).  However, it's still a heck of a machine for the price -- it\nis quite rugged, and many people out there swear by it.  (It's probably the\nmost popular walkman-style DAT machine out there.)\n\n        Anyway, the guy selling it is Bryan Davis (bdavis@netcom.com), and\nhere's what he told me:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHere is what is included:\n        - TCD-D3 DATman.\n        - (2) RCA to Stereo 1/8" plug cables.  One for analog input, one for\n          analog output.\n        - Optical digital I/O cable (one lead for input, one for output).\n        - A copy of my sales receipt with a note about your purchase.  The\n          unit is still under factory warrantee.\n        - AC adaptor/battery charger.\n        - Rechargable battery.\n\nI paid $750 + tax for it so I hope you don't mind if I keep the 60 minute\ntape it came with (I have some samples on it!).\n\n[By the way, he spent at least $100 too much for it, unless he's including an\n extended warranty, which is advised for DAT machines, since it costs about\n $300 to replace the head when it wears out, and it probably will within 5\n years if you use it a lot.. -- davisonj]\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n        I'm not going to quote my sale price for him: that would not be nice.\nSend him mail and ask him what he wants.\n\n        Again, I've used the TCD-D3, and I have to say that I can certainly\nunderstand why it is as popular as it is.  I've been using one for a little\nwhile, and although I had some problems with it recently, I should also point\nout that the particular one I was using had been on the road for two years and\nhad truly been _used_ during that time.  (This is the same exact DAT machine\nthat was lugged around the U.S. and Canada to record the Jazz Butcher\nConspiracy for their recent live album.)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI know at least half a dozen professional musicians and record labels\nin S.F who use that model (and have been for a while) with no reported\nproblem.  My problem is that everyone I know already has one.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n        'nuff said.\n\n        The reason I'm not getting it is that I found someone else selling me a\nunit that features phono-plug SPDIF I/O instead of optical (I don't have any\noptical ports on my equipment, but you, the reader, might), and it also has\nsome other bells & whistles that the TCD-D3 doesn't.  (I am also paying more\nfor the alternative.)  Note that phono-plug-to-optical SPDIF adapters are\navailable if you absolutely must have one.\n\n        Of course, it has SCMS.  All consumer decks do.  (So do Sony Minidiscs,\nby the way.)\n\n        Anyway, if you're interested, get in touch with bdavis@netcom.com.
[advertises his printing business]\n\nOh, dear.  Let me be the first on my block.\n\nYou have just violated one of the major shibboleths of the Usenet groups:\nyou're not supposed to use a newsgroup to plug your own commercial\nenterprise (of _any_ kind; people frequently get flamed for announcing\nthey've got a new book out.)\n\nI don't know whether this is an official Usenet rule or just a long-\nstanding custom, and it doesn't make much difference from a practical\npoint of view.\n\nSo please don't do it again.\n\nAnd all you others, who are even now taking keyboard in hand to flame\nhim off the face of the earth--lay off.  He didn't know any better.\nHe does now.\n\n\nDorothy J. Heydt\nUC Berkeley\ncozzlab@garnet.berkeley.edu

I participated a promotion by a company called Visual Images. \nThey sent me a award certificate three months ago and asked \nme to buy their promotion package in order to receive the major\naward. They mislabled my address and I did not receive my package\nuntil one month ago. I was mad and angry about how it took them\nso long to get my package. So I wrote them a letter and requested\nfor a refund. They never return my letter. I was lucky enough to\nfind out their telephone number through operator and received the\npackage. I immediately returned the package and wrote them another\nletter to ask for refund. The package was returned because they\naddress they put on the package was incorrect. I attempted to \ncall them and learnd that they have changed their telephone number.\nIt took me at least 10 phone calls to find out their new number,\nbut they refused to take any responsibility. I spoke to their\nmanager and she said she would call me back, but she has not call\nyet. But I was able to get their address from their front desk.\nShould I just go ahead and send the package? Or should I waite until\nthey call me back?\n\nI know there are several people on the net has experience with the\nsame company. I would like to know how they got their money back.\nIf you have similar experience, please advise me.\n\nThanks in advance,

You get a case, a power supply, and a motherboard\n(with RAM and a coprocessor). *Everything* else is yours to add as you like.\n\nThe case/power supply:\n  \n     - Standard desktop case. 230watt power supply with the usual connectors.\n     - Room for five floppy/hard drives (three visible, two internal).\n\nThe motherboard:\n\n    - US-made Micronics 8-slot motherboard with Intel 386dx/25mhz CPU\n    - 64kb SRAM cache\n    - 4mb 80us RAM using 4x1mb simms (worth $150 alone)\n    - Cyrix 83D87 math coprocessor (worth $90 alone)\n    - Norton SI 6.0 rating of 26.1\n    - Latest version Phoenix BIOS\n\n\nPlease do not post/email saying "but I can get a Taiwanese SuperClone\n386/90 for only $9.95 including a free toaster!". I am *certain* you can\nfind a cheaper Brand X board without even breaking a sweat. *New* Micronics\nCPUs command a several-hundred dollar premium because they are US-made,\nuse high-quality components, and are known to be both very reliable and\ncompatible. They have been OEMed in systems sold by both Gateway and\nZeos at various points in the past. (Check out the ads in the back pages\nof Byte or PC Magazine if you want to see this price differential for\nyourself.)\n\nPrice: $495 complete, $100 less if you don't want/need the case and\npower supply. The board is fully guaranteed. Email for further details\nor for any questions.\n\nThanks!

Time once again to clean out the ol' closet.  Some stuff is up for offers, some\nisn't.  Please read carefully.\n\n\nIn the MAKE OFFER department:\n\n	WordPerfect 5.0, upgrade copy.  Includes all disks and all upgrade\n	manuals.  Best offer.\n\n	Balance of Power, 1992 edition, for the Amiga.  With manual and reg.\n	card.  Best offer.\n\n\nIn the FOR SALE department:\n\n	Technics model 715 auto-reverse open-reel STEREO tape deck.  Because\n	it's auto-reverse, this deck records onto tape just like a cassette\n	deck does, so it's not very good for splice-type editing.  However,\n	I have used it effectively in "tape studio" applications for mastering,\n	and it works great.  3.75 and 7.5 ips speeds, supports up to 7" reels.\n	Dual lighted VU meters with record indicators.  Full auto-reverse\n	capable (and the mechanism works, too!).  Adjustable sound on sound,\n	and socket for remote control (I don't know where you'd find one, but\n	they used to make 'em), plus a 110VAC unswitched outlet.  This unit\n	is in excellent condition and I have had it rebuilt once since I got\n	it--works perfectly.\n\n	Price:  $225.00 or best offer, or possible trade (see below).\n\n\n	Panasonic KX-P1624 printer.  24-pin with 360x360dpi resolution in both\n	text and graphics modes.  Warranty cards, manuals, all the usual stuff\n	you expect when buying like-new merchandise.  I'm selling it because I\n	now have a better printer.  This is the wide carriage version of the\n	KX-P1124, by the way.  Test prints are available upon request.\n\n	Price:  $250.00 o.b.o. or trade.\n\n\n	Excalibur custom pool cue.  19 oz., 13 mm, brass joint, Irish linen\n	wrap, could use a new tip but will hold up for a while.  I've got too\n	many cues as it is, and don't need this one.  Hits nicely, is very\n	straight and in excellent condition.\n\n	Price:  $125.00 o.b.o. or trade.  Imperial hard case (1 butt/1 shaft)\n	available for an additional $40.00.\n\n\nTRADES:  I need the following things, and I have no cash of my own right now,\nso if you want to trade, it needs to be straight-across.   The list:\n\n	Amiga ROM upgrade to at LEAST 2.04, preferably 2.1+, with appropriate\n	DOS and Workbench.\n\n	1 meg Agnus chip for the Amiga.\n\n	Amiga hard drive and controller (preferably SCSI).\n\n	IBM-compatible hard drive (and controller if not MFM).  This one's \n	touchy, as I have a full-height and don't have room for more unless\n	I swap out--needs to be above 100M, and I will consider trading a\n	good ST-4096 in the deal.\n\n	Intel 9600EX or 14.4EX or similar EXTERNAL high-speed modem.
He is probably referring to the DOS version.. the dos versions is up\nto like version 6 i think.  The window version just came out recently\nso it is only up to like version 2 or something.

> MOTOROLA EXPO VHF 2WATT/2CHAN. HT--------[new]-------$1200.00\n> Would like $400, or BEST OFFER!!!\n\nI'm sure that the Motorola is worth it, but this kind of thing\nhas always mystified me.  $400 is the price of very good, new\ndual-band, fully synthasized HT.  Yes, yes, I know Motorola\nHTs are bullet-proof, unbreakable, plutonium-based \nindestructable -- you can drive a tank over them and they'll\nstill work.  But just how often does that come up?  Why are hams\nwilling (and they *are*) to spend the price of a synthaszied\ndual-bander for a 2-channel xtal rig???  Note: this is not\na flame; as I said, I'm sure this is a good deal for this rig.\nI'm just amazed that it *is* a good deal.  I would have guessed\nthat a 2 channel xtal rig could never be worth as much as a dual-\nbander to a ham, no matter how durable. Just shows you how wrong\n*I* can be.\n\nMike, N4PDY

I have a 24-pin printer which is an ALPs Allegro24.  It's both a fast\nprinter with LQ and a very sophisticated design.  It has a straight paper\npath and the capability of auto-forwarding sheets to tear off and then back\n(a big paper saver as you never have to waste sheets to get a current\nprint out).  It can also handle single sheets without removing the formfeed\nand has sophisticated preferences options (you can interactively program\nall the preferences to control the printer and get printed feedback without\never using a computer).  You get prompts and menus to pick your current setup\nand default set up.  This was THE top of the line LQ dot matrix when I bought\nit three years ago for $399.  It is also Epson LQ2500 compatible (besides it's\nown modes) and comes with IBM driver software (which I've never used since I\nown an Amiga).  Has a card slot for upgrading memory or fonts.\n\n    I'll let it go for $150 including shipping prepaid.

Hi to all.\n\nSince all of you could also be a seller as well as a buyer, I'd like to bring\nthis issue for discussion - what would be the best solution in case a deal \nbecame a lemon?\n\nAs I understand most people selling things over the net do not grant a warranty,I am in such a situation that the seller did not state whether a warranty would be granted or not and the item I received is out of order. The seller insisted\nthat it was 'in good condition' when he sent it and so would just return half ofthe amount that I paid if I send the item back to him and after he is sured it\nis bad. Is this reasonable?\n\nBasically I would like to believe the seller tells the truth. Also, I am positively to say that I've not done anything wrong which might cause the failure of \nthe thing. My assumption here is everyone is honest - so rule out the possibility that either one of the two parties or both are liars.\n\nI would like to hear your opinion - either in here or directly respond to my\ne-mail address.\n\nI know there is such a risk that you could lose money. But, how can we make it\nenjoyable to most people and not wasting the bandwidth?

#>So, does anyone care to enlighten us whether DOS6.0 is worth upgrading to?\n#>How good is it's compression, and can it be turned on/off at will?\n#>Any other nice/nasty features?\n# \n#According to reports, if you don't have DOS yet, and don't have any\n#utilities (QEMM, Stacker, PCTools, Norton, ...) then DOS6 may be worth it. \n#For people who have DOS5, and some sort of utility, DOS6 doesn't offer\n#much. You'd never know it from the usual hype that marketing is able\n#to create, however. :-)\n\n	IMHO, it seems to be worth the $40 to upgrade.  DoubleSpace seems a bit \nsaner than Stacker 2.0 (which I've replaced).  MemMaker is nowhere near as \naggressive as QEMM, but it doesn't hose my system like QEMM did (at least\nit hasn't yet).  Microsoft AntiVirus is just the latest version (or a \nreasonably recent one) of CPAV - mine was very aged, so this was quite welcome.\n\n 	MS-DOS 6.0 ain't the end all, be all of operating systems - but it's\nbetter than a sharp stick in the eye, unless you happen to be into that sort \nof thing.  :-)

I also check Computer\nShoppers and found they don't advertise anymore. If you know if they are still\nin business or you know how to contact them, please tell me.\n\nThank you very much.

COD is fine until the buyer opens the box to find they paid 150.00\nfor a brick. Or if it the seller allows for a personal check to be used\non a COD it's fine till a stop payment is made. There are few methods\nto protect both buyer and seller in any sort of transaction. Even with\nmerchants and customers there are problems...stolen credit cards, \nchargebacks, no return policies and getting the wrong item, etc.\n\nAbout the only protection available to to do business with someone you\ntrust....someone who has been around for a while.\n\nJeff\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________

Fellow netters,\n\nI have an Okidata printer I would like to sell.  A description follows:\n\nOkidata 180 printer including cables for both IBM compatibles (Centronics\nparallel) and Commodore (RS-232 - round).  Also includes power cable, manual,\nand a handful of computer paper to get you started.  This is a 9-pin printer. \nI recently cleaned the printhead and installed a new ribbon.  A print sample \ncan be provided upon request.  This is a very dependable printer - it never\njams or does "weird" things.  I have used it with a Commodore for about 3 years\nand am now using it with my 486sx.  I use mainly WordPerfect 5.1 (see next\npost) for which I got a driver (at no charge) that directly supports the \nOkidata 180 in Epson FX mode. \n\nWhen I got the printer, it was selling for around $200-220 new (I got mine\nfrom Tenex brand new - for a Christmas present).  I would like to get about\n$100 or so for it.  If you are interested at all in it, please give me a ring\n(E-Mail) and make an offer.

After hearing about the McGovern House story on Paul Harvey I never had any\nidea how much it was worth.  The autograph is on a Senate Pass card\nand is signed 'John Kennedy.'  I don't remember if it was signed \n'Senator John Kennedy' or whether or not it was dated, because I haven't\nlooked at it in quite a while.  Currently it is in a safety deposit box.\nI would rather sell to a private collector rather then go through an auction\nhouse such as Christy's since that would tend to take away from the profit. \nIf you (or any collector you may know) has an interest in this please send\nme an e-mail expressing your interest.  I will see what I can do to make \na scanned gif of it available to prospective buyers.

Dear Fellow Usenet Users:\n\n	I would like to give a formal apology for posting an advertisement \nabout my printing business.  I did not intend this to be an advertisement, \nbut rather an offer for people on the usenet, many of whom use printing\non a regular basis.  I was not aware that this is not "legal" on the usenet.\nI am only trying to put myself through college.  For those of you who\nrequested information, I will write to you privately.  For those of you who \nare having fun flooding my mailbox, I think you can grow up.  To offer advice\nis one thing, but to use profanity toward me is another.\n\nThank you,
I was my understanding that the purpose of those removeable-front-panels\nwere to make the radio useless, and thus discourage theft (that is if the \ncover were removed by the owner and taken along whenever the car was left.)\n\nIf those covers were sold for anything remarkably less than the radio \noriginally costs, or even sold at all,\nthen the above discouragement wouldn't be so great.\n\nI personally would be unhappy, if I bought a radio like that, thinking that \nremoving the cover greatly depreciated the radio's value, and the covers were\nsold by the company (or other legitimate source) cheaply.

My little Nash has sat for about a year (had been running), but now I must move\na long distance and there are too many things to carry with me.  Here are the\ndetails of the car:\n\n1958 Hardtop--Exterior condition:\n     Rocker panels rusted out at weld points, no rust at typical spots like\n     door hinge mounting points, back battery box, etc.  Missing front bumper,\n     front pan dented up, one weld popped in front.  This is for the most part\n     a solid, restorable automobile.\n\n     Interior Condition:\n     Missing original steering wheel, has one of the smaller aftermarket\n     wheels, seats need reupholstered, general fair condition.\n\n     Mechanical Condition:\n     Had been running, but now does not want to start...needs new rings (which\n     I have) also have extra parts such as complete long block, extra steering\n     shaft, etc.\n\nFor a car that has not been touched since 1958, it is in solid shape.  It will\nobviously need some work, but will make a good project.\n\nPRICE:  Well, this is a tough one, I would like to get around 800.00, but will\nconsider any serious offers by individuals willing to come and get it. If you \nhave things to trade such as tools, toys, cameras, comics, cards, etc., \nanything easily movable to Florida, I may consider that as well.\n\nHit <r>, or my e-mail address is Ellis.15@osu.edu\n\n(614) 777-0791 home (leave message)\nThanks

I have used JVC's top of the line portable cd player for three months now.\nI have mostly used it in my car on long trips, so it has less than 20 hours of use on it.  The unit is one of the best that I have seen and listened to, but\nI am going to part with it to install a disc changer in my car.\n\nFeatures include:\n	17 Hz - 20,000 Hz\n	rechargeable nicad batteries\n	wireless remote control\n	AC adaptor\n	headphones\n	carrying belt and case\n	digital 6 band graphic eq with spectrum analyzer\n		25 presets, 5 user programmable\n	RCA connections and cord\n	JVC compulink capability (cord included)\n	programmable from remote\n	intro, random, repeat playback\n\nI will include a Discwasher (tm) power converter to convert an automobile's\n12v DC to the 5.5V DC that the unit requires.  I had to buy this one because\nit was the only one that fits, (JVC makes a unique connection that cannot be\nfound at Radio Shack etc).\n\nI paid $235 for the disc player and another $30 for the power converter.\nI will sell the disc player alone for $180, or both items for $190.\n\nSend replies to harrij@rpi.edu or (518)271-7942

Oh no!  Someone is provided useful information AND mentioned that they\nmade money in the field.  Don't they know that usenet is reserved for\nuninformed speculation by people trying to sell their personal stuff\n(from houses to dead pcs) at a huge markup/trying to unload stuff they\nbought from their company at just under retail, and other\n"non-commercial" activities.\n\n\nThe net is not "supposed" to be a dumping ground for free ads, but\nreserving it for tripe doesn't seem to be a significant improvement.\n\n\nSo?  Either they target it well enough to pay for it, in other words,\nthey manage to send it to people who want the stuff (in which case it\nis junk only for the "rest" and the transaction costs are borne\nappropriately in this case) or they go bankrupt.

Hello, I have a motherboard and a case for sale as a package.\nBoth of them came from a CompuAdd computer I bought last August and am \n  presently upgrading.\nHere are the specs--\n\nMotherboard\n-----------\nCyrix 486SL 25 MHz microprocessor\nChips and Technology chipset (SCATsx V2.3.6 SLSLC)\n8 SIMM banks for a maximum of 32 Megs of RAM\nBUILT-IN Floppy and Hard Drive Controllers\nBUILT-IN ports--1 Parallel, 2 Serial (9 and 25 pin)\nBUILT-IN Paradise SVGA controller with 1 meg of RAM (Windows drivers inc.)\n   -can do up to 1024x768 @ 256 colors\n   -based on the Western Digital WD90C31 chip\nMath co-processor slot\n3 16-bit expansion slots and 2 8-bit expansion slots\n\nCase\n----\nLow-Profile Desktop\nVery nice grey color\n150 watt power supply\nRoom for 2 floppies plus HD\n\nMouse\n-----\n3-button\nMicrosoft-compatible\nGrey color matches case\n\nAll original manuals and documentation, video drivers, etc. are included.\n\nYou are probably wondering why I must sell the case with the motherboard.\nIt is simply because the case is custom-made for this particular board and\n  you would be hard-pressed to fit another MB in it.  However, the case and\n  this motherboard were made to go together and fit perfectly.\n\nAs you can see, since this board includes drive controllers AND a video \n  controller, you can save some money by buying this unit and not a MB\n  where you would need to get IO cards, video card, and drive controllers\n  Its just a lot more convenient on the whole\n\nI would like to ask about $500 for this whole package.  I think this is a fair\n  price given the facts that it includes a video card and drive controllers/IO\n  ports.  All you need to do is add drives, a monitor, RAM, and a keyboard. \n  Also keep in mind that it isn't a generic board, but from CompuAdd.\nI also will entertain all serious offers.\n\nPlease email at jmu@acpub.duke.edu\n\nThanks

Jammer !\n\n Dit is geen fantastische advertentie over nep-rolexen\n maar een evenzo duidelijke mededeling hieromtrent :\n\n Aangezien het alleen al aanbieden van deze horloges onder\n vermelding van de echte merknaam niet geheel correct is,\n wil ik met dit bericht duidelijk maken dat ik, Marcel Engelbertink,\n niet meer zal adverteren met imitatie-horloges van het merk ROLEX.\n\n Enig persoon die hierin geiinteresseerd is kan ik jammer genoeg ook niet\n meer helpen.\n\n\n\n\n For all the foreign people who can't even understand dutch ?!? :\n\n In spite of earlier mailing about fake-rolex's, I announce that I\n don't have any information available any longer and I won't use\n the trade name ROLEX anymore for those fake models.\n\n\n Yours fakefully,

Hello Neo-Geo owners (and non-owners who couldn't resist the title;)),\n\nI was wondering if any of you out there want to trade or sell games.

But ahh, the quality...\nNow I can get them for about $100, but that's still a lot.\n\nRight now, I have:\n\nCrossed Swords\nMagician Lord\nBaseball Stars 2\nFatal Fury\nNam-1975\n\nI am interested in buying more titles.  If any of you have any interesting\ntrade ideas, please let me know.\n\n\nThanks

Time to clear out some miscellaneous lenses, cameras and photo stuff\nthat's not being used.  Some are gems, some are mundane.\n \n \nMinolta AF 50/1.7 lens for Maxxum cameras.  New lens, but I guess it'd\nbe best to call it a "demo" since I did not get the literature, box or\nwarranty cards.  $30.\n \nVivitar 2X converter for Nikon F or AI lenses.  Pretty cute "flip back"\ntang so it will work with all manual focus Nikon lenses - and bodies.\nIt will even couple (and double) a non-AI lens to an AI body.  $15.\n \nPentax 50/1.4 screwmount lens.  Well actually it's a Super-Takumar which\nis what they all were back then.  Very mint condition.  $25. Nice hard\ncase for this lens $5 more..\n \nAlpex 135/2.8 lens.  Beautifully made, all metal construction with fine\noptics.  Minolta mount.  $25.  Another hard case that fits this with\nstrap can be added..call it $7 more.\n \nVivitar 283 flash.  The one that made Vivitar famous (until the 285\neclipsed it).  Tilt head, removable sensor, variable auto exposure.\n$30.\n \nUniversal "Roamer 63" folding old "bellows" camera with leather case.\nUses 120 or 620 film, 100mm F6.3 lens.  Kinda cool articulated shutter\nrelease.  Decent shape.  $20.\n \nWeston 540 lightmeter.  Nothin super fancy, but it works well, and is a\ngood cross check to built in meters.  $7 with case and strap.\n \nAnd finally..the "gems"\n \nPentax Auto 110 camera with 24mm F2.8 lens.  This is the little\n(and I do mean TINY) SLR that Pentax made.  Has interchangeable lenses,\nbut try and find the 20-40 zoom, true through the lens viewing with\nsplit image focus, and completely auto exposure.  $70.\n \nOlympus 35RC rangefinder camera.  A really cute little camera with 42mm\nlens (F2.8) with built in manual or auto exposure, self timer etc.  I\nthink this was the predecessor to the XA - and it's nearly all metal.\nI won't mind holding onto this one if it doesn't sell.  $60.\n \nOlympus OM-1 with flash shoe, leatherette case, 50/1.4 Zuiko lens, and\nTokina SD (Super Dispersion) 70-210 lens.  These are all in very nice to\nmint condition, except for one little ding on the OM body near the film\nadvance lever.  Lenses are perfect, and the Tokina is a very compact,\nand sharp lens.  $225 for the set.\n \n \nThat'll do to clean out some of the stuff.  Feel free to offer on this\nstuff, although the cheaper stuff is priced to cover my hassle in\nshipping it..\n \nFor more details call or email.
Forgot to mention that the above mentioned Quantum is a SCSI\ndrive.

Your kidding, $210.00, man o man, you can buy the system new for $49.00 at \nElectronic Boutique and those games are only about $15 - $20.00 brand new.  \nMaybe you should think about that price again if you REALLY need the money.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                        \n                        -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n                            Wayne State University      \n                                                       \n                                Steve Teolis            \n                             6050 Cass Ave. # 238       \n                              Detroit, MI  48202
OK... I've done a little research and the price I've been asking\nwas a BIT high.  So...\n\n	Casio CZ-101 Synthesizer	$125 or best offer\n\nFeatures:\nuses FM modulation to create sounds -- \n	programmable ADSR envelopes for each of 2 DCA's (amplitude), 2 DCW's \n	(pitch, like a VCF), and 2 DCO's (waveform, like VCO) with up to 8 \n	steps for each\n16 preset sounds, 8 more in memory, 8 more still in RAM cartridge.\n49 stubby keys\nPitch Bend Wheel\nMIDI in/out ports\n\nIncludes:\nAll the manuals you could ever want\nAC adapter (can use 6 D batteries)\nLine cord\n1 RAM cartridge -- holds 8 additional sounds\n\nI'll throw in a bunch of sheet music and "Play Rock Keyboards" too.
For Sale ...:\n \n        Hewlett Packard DeskJet 500 inkjet printer.\n \n        o Perfect condition both internally and externally\n        o Comes with two FULL ink cartridges\n        o Less than six months old\n        o Comes with all original packaging, manuals, cables\n          and software\n \n        This is truly an excellent printer and is the low-cost\n        alternative to a laser printer.  It prints with the\n        quality of a laser printer, but for a fraction of both\n        the inital cost and he long term cost (that is,\n        replacement of ink cartridges as opposed to replacement\n        of toner).  The printer prints at a maximum of 300*300\n        (D)ots (P)er (I)nch (D.P.I.) on many different types\n        and sizes of paper, including envelopes and\n        transperencies.  Printer prints in both landscape and\n        portrait modes.  Printer can accept up to two\n        cartridges giving it things like more memory or\n        additional fonts.  Printer works excellently with\n        Windows and DOS and brings TrueType to its full\n        potential.\n \n        I originally purchased the printer for $375.00.  Make me\n        an offer, but I would prefer to stay in the $300.00\n        range.  I will pay the shipping to anywhere in the \n        continental U.S.A.\n \n        If you are interested, please either leave me email or\n        call Kirk Peterson at (303) 494-7951 anytime.\n \n        Thanks!
