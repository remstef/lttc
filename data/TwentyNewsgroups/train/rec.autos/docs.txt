While not exactly a service incident, I had a similar experience recently  \nwhen I bought a new truck.\n\nI had picked out the vehicle I wanted and after a little haggling we  \nagreed on a price. I wrote them a check for the down payment plus tax\nand license and told them I'd be back that evening to pick up the truck.  \nWhen I returned, I had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could  \nget to me. When I finally got in there, everything went smoothly until he  \nstarted adding up the numbers. He then discovered that they had  \nmiscalculated the tax & license by about $150. He then said he needed  \nanother $150 from me. I said we had already agreed on a price and it was  \ntheir problem, I wasn't giving them any more money. The finance guy then  \nbrought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time. I  \nreminded him that I was the customer and I didn't think I should be  \ntreated like that and that if he didn't back off he could forget the whole  \ndeal. He made some smart remark so I told him where he could stick it,  \nsnatched back my check and left. Needless to say, they were not pleased by  \nthe turn of events.\n\nEarly the next morning I got a call from the general sales manager wanting  \nto know what happened. I related the story and he apologised profusely and  \nasked if there was anything they could do to change my mind. I told him  \nthat if they gave me the truck for free I probably still wouldn't take it,  \nthat there were other dealers in town, I was a repeat customer of theirs  \nand that they should learn how to treat customers,etc,etc...I was still  \npretty steamed about the whole affair. He gave me the line about hating to  \nlose a customer and they would try to find a solution, etc, etc. I told  \nhim not to bother, thanks, I'd go somewhere else.\n\nA couple hours later, the owner of the dealership called me, all  \napologetic, etc, etc, etc, and said that they would cover the $150 plus  \nknock another $400 off the price of the truck. I told him I'd think about  \nit and he gave me his private, direct phone number, his secretary's name,  \nand assured me that they valued me as a customer, etc etc etc....\n\nI thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we  \ndecided, what the hell...that was a pretty decent deal, so I called him  \nback and accepted his offer. When I went back the next day to pick up the  \ntruck, I received the royal treatment. Everyone seemed to know about the  \nincident, even the lot boy. Everything went smoothly and I was out of  \nthere in my new truck in about 30 mins.\n\nSo, I guess I'm a reasonably satisfied customer. However, it should not  \nhave happened in the first place. I was a bit shocked to have a sales  \nperson talk to me like that. I don't expect them to bow and grovel, but I  \nsure don't expect to be given a hard time either, esp. when it's their  \nmistake.\n\nAnyway, I'm happy with the truck and it turned out to be a couple hundred  \ndollars under invoice and they paid most of the first year's license fee.  \nI'm not sure whether I'll go back to that dealer, tho.

Hello,\n	I am looking to slightly increase the performance of my 89 Honda\nCivic Si.  I was wondering if anyone could suggest upgrades that were not\ntoo drastic.  I thought that one of the easiest upgrades would be a new\nheader.  Does anyone know what kind of increase that the header would give\nme?  I think I would check with Jackson Racing for the part.  Are there\nany other comparines would make Honda parts.  \n\n	Are there any other small changes that can be easily made and won't\nscrew up the car.  Things like new injectors?, new fuel injection chip etc?\nI would welcome any suggestions of small changes that would make a\ndifference.\n\n	I don't really want to change the cam etc because I have heard that it\nwould be much harder on the engine.\n\nE-Mail relpies prefered please and I will post a summary of all the replies.\nThanks for any help you may have to offer!
It's great that all these other cars can out-handle, out-corner, and out-\naccelerate an Integra.\n\nBut, you've got to ask yourself one question: do all these other cars have\na moonroof with a sliding sunshade?  No wimpy pop-up sunroofs or power\nsliding roofs that are opaque.  A moonroof that can be opened to the air,\nclosed to let just light in, or shaded so that nothing comes in.\n\nYou've just got to know what's important :^).
Not to mention my friend's '54 Citroen Traction Avant with the light switch and \ndimmer integrated in a single stalk off the steering column!   Those dumb French\nwere apparently copying the Japanese before the Germans!  :^)
I don't understand this last statement about the '90Vanagon...Our '90Vanagon\nOwner's Manual RECOMMENDS 20W50 !!
Say, you bought your Saturn at $13k, with a dealer profit of $2k.\nIf the dealer profit is $1000, then you would only be paying $12k for\nthe same car.  So isn't that saving money?\n\nMoreover, if Saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by $1000, \nthen their cars will be even better deals.  Say, if the price of a Saturn was\nalready $1000 below market average for the class of cars, then after they\nreduce the dealer profit, it would be $2000 below market average.  It will:\n\n1) Attract even more people to buy Saturns because it would SAVE THEM MONEY.\n \n2) Force the competitors to lower their prices to survive.\n\nNow, not only will Saturn owners benefit from a lower dealer profit, even \nthe buyers for other cars will pay less.\n\nIsn't that saving money?
I have just a couple of questions about this technique.\n\nFirst, what firing order should I use?  Do I start with my pointer\nfinger or my pinky?  Left hand or right?\n\nAnd secondly, I have a 12cyl and there are two cylinders unaccounted\nfor.  Any suggestions?
I just had my 41 Chrysler painted. I was told to refrain from waxing it and\nto leave it out in the sun!! Supposedly this let's the volatiles escape from\nthe paint over a month or so (I can smell it 15 feet away on a hot day) and\nlets any slight irregularites in the surface flow out, as the paint remains\na little soft for a while.
I'd like to see you use this method on a couple of semi drivers. If they see you,\nthey usually acknowledge by sticking their hand out the window with their middle\nfinger extended. Because it is also obvious to them that there is no clear lane\nahead.
Joni Ciarletta writes\n\nYou are not alone.  My '79 Honda Accord with 110,000 miles on it started  \nshowing the same behavior.\n\nI replaced the brake master cylinder myself.  It took about an hour and cost  \nabout $45.  Sure beats paying $300 to have someone else do it!  If I wanted to  \nrebuild my own master cylinder instead of putting in a rebuilt one, it would  \nhave cost only $20 to $30 for the rebuild kit.\n\nThe Honda brake master cylinder is easy to get to.  Two bolts attach it to the  \nengine compartment.  Two brake lines enter the master cylinder.  The tricky  \npart was that the brake lines were stuck tight.  My Craftsmen open end wrench  \nrounded off the bolt heads!  I had to use Vise Grips to loosen those suckers.   \nWow!  Best invention since sliced bread.  After that it was very easy.  Bolt  \nthe new part in place, add new brake fluid, and bleed the brakes.

[stuff about autobahn and safety of sho at speed deleted]\n\nThe Mustang is a much worse case of design irresponsibility than the\nSHO. \n\nIts hard to predicatbaly drift a stock Mustang because\nof the suspension.\n\n\nYes. When i think Mustang, I think school-bus +  F16 motor. In\nmy mind the Mustang should be fitted with a speed limiter at 80-90\nor so. It just isn't safe, check out your local junkyard, Mustangs\noutnumber other cars by a proportion way in excess of sales in\njunkyards.\n\nI find it astonishing the CU or somesuchlike has not jumped on the\nMustang for poor brakes in relation to power. Ford should at least\nstandardize on the SVO rear brakes for all 5.0's.\n\n\n\n\nTrue of Northern Europe, latin countries are something else.\n\nKindof true. remember they were build by adolf in the '30's.\n\n\nYes.\n\n\n"Autobahn" is the german word for freeway. Other countries have\ndifferent names for loose equivalents; autostrada, autoroute, motorway\netc.\n\n\nEurope did seem on the brink of a 130kmh limit. It hasn't passed as\nfar as I know. typical speeds in western europe are much higher than\nthe US. Law enforcement is negligible in my experience (comapred\nto the US) as there is no revenue enhancement motivation. The things\nyou really notice are the higher speed differentials, and the more\nprofessional attitude to driving. You just never see two cars\nrunning parallel at 55.1 mph oblivious to all around them.\n\n\nYou're wrong. GTI's  go this fast. Just kind of noisy, not the ideal\n\nautobahn car. A lot of times you see cars being driven with the drivers\nfoot on the floor. How do I know? - when you're not making any ground\non the identical car in front of you!\n\n\nIf something happens at 130-150 you're dead, but the same goes for much\nover 35. Driving at high speed forces you to concentrate. I feel much\nsafer driving 130+ on the autobahn than 60-80 in typical US traffic\nbecause most people seem to be awake. I've never seen any driver reading\na book on an autobahn, I see it all too often in the US.\n\nCraig\n\nIt just doesn't *seem* fast after 30 minutes or so of aclimation. everybody\ndrives that fast, no big deal.
I like my power windows. I think they're worth it.\n\nHowever, cruise control is a pretty dumb option. What's the point?\nIf you're on a long trip, you floor the gas and keep your eyes on\nthe rear-view mirror for cops, right?\n\nPower seats are pretty dumb too, unless you're unlucky enough to have\nto share your car. Otherwise, you'd just adjust it once and just leave\nit like that.
While I don't read normally read this group, I was looking for Valentine radar\ninformation (sigh, maybe in the FAQ) and came across your posting..\n\nI bought a '93 Probe GT with the PEP 263A last July (now at 9500 miles)\nafter debating over the Sentra SE-R/NX2000, MX6, MR-2, Stealth, Prelude, \nand Celica.\n\nCheck this month's Consumer Reports for previous Probe records.  \n\nMy criteria: a "fun" car with ABS, airbag, over 130hp, and less than $25K.\nI thought about a turbo, but checking with insurance people ruled that out.\nThe Tri-Star cars (Eclipse/Talon/etc) were out since they don't have an air bag.\nDitto for the Mustang(also no ABS).\nThe SE-R/NX2000/M20 fell into the pocket-rocket category.  A good used car buy.\nThe MX-6 was almost there but rolled more than I liked.  \nI didn't like the Prelude dash/instrumentation at all.  Too weird for me.\nThe MR2 has a much smaller non-passenger space than I needed, so out that went.\nThe Celica was "ok" but underpowered when loaded with options (and somewhat\noverpriced too) in non-turbo form.\nI never considered the 240SX since it didn't have an airbag.  I did look at it\nfor its RWD virtues but that's it.  The Corolla never entered my mind.\nI should have looked at the Mitsubishi VR4/Dodge Stealth more.\nSince my list was exhausted, I bought the Probe.  :-)\n\nThe car design is different than earlier years, so it's too early to see its\nreliability so far.  For what it's worth, my comments:\n\nMy dislikes:\nShutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal.\nHeadlights have "stuck" up a few times (weather?)\nair conditioning broke ~4000 miles (pressure cycling switch)\ncondensation around rear washer fluid container doesn't drain completely.\ncrammed engine; little hope for do-it-yourselfers (typical)\nparts somewhat more expensive than normal Ford parts\nunderside plastic doesn't like sharp driveways and speedbumps (typical).\nassembly gripes: tape on radiator, screw fell out of dash, seat seams not \nstitched properly.  Hopefully just a fluke.\nFord only gives 1 key with the car.  C'mon Ford, spend an extra few pennies!\nRear hatch has no padding on corners when up.  I'm waiting for the day when\nI bash my head on the corner.\nhorn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center (personal preference)\nTires fling dirt/mud onto side of car \n\nMy Likes:\nengine (design/valves/sounds/smoothness/power/mileage/torque) -- definitely #1\nhandling (very good for FWD; understeer only at limits)\ntransmission (the 5 speed is a must)\nusable instrumentation (lovely readable analog everywhere)\nVery little torque steer at full power (much better than the '90 SHO I drive)\nstability at 100+mph (high gearing though)\nlow cowl (good visibility in front)\nHeated outside mirrors (nice in fog, never tested in freezing weather)\nABS/Air bag (see above)\nrear seats fold down (I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important)\nNo shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!)\nTires: 225/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles (70% left; hoping for 30K :-)\n\nAs you can see, I'm primarily interested in the engine.  While it doesn't\nhave the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big selling\npoint for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine.  \n\nThe overall car is a good buy for the money.  That market segment hasn't changed\nmuch since July (Prelude VTEC, Honda Del Sol??).  I drive it to and from work\neach day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that the\nProbe's suspension doesn't like potholes.  When you test drive one, find a \npotholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable.\nIf you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  They'll find\nthat they have no room in the back and you'll find that the car rides\ndifferently (if that's "better" is up to you).  Also, there's a lot of glass\naround you which I wasn't expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty\nhot in the summer.  My back seat passengers (now very few) complain about\nthe lack of ventilation; you may want to consider that when combined with\nthe heat.  I've heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine.\nLeather and the keyless entry system weren't available when I got the car so\nI can't comment on them (I got the car before it was officially announced).  \nI prefer cloth to leather anyway.  \n\nI wouldn't want this car in the snow:  The suspension is too rough for the\ninevitable surprise potholes, tires aren't meant for snow, and the seats assume\nthat you're not wearing lots of thick clothing.  Rain is much better:  water \ngenerally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wiper\ncontrols are easy and understandable, and I barely hydroplaned once with the\nEagles (and I was really trying).  \nThere is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places.  The GT\nhas map holders below the speakers in the door, but they're rigid plastic\nthat could fit two cassettes or CD's max.  The center console/storage bin/arm\nrest has *1* cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth "pouch"\nbut that's it.  No change holders.  Quite a let-down from the SHO.\nAnd the Probe is definitely not a people-mover car or an econo-box car!\n\nLastly, don't store wet car covers in the back.  The foam will soak the \nwater up and the result will *not* smell pleasant :-(.\n\nNathan\nnathan@sco.com
*nnnnnnnng* Thank you for playing, I cannot agree with this.  I believed\nthis and to put it nicely, it was a piece of junk!\n\nI loved this car, I babied it, I pampered it, and after 2 years, it just\ncouldn't stay together, I would say that not everyone will have the\nproblems that I had, but know this, it's not just the car, it is the\nability to get the car fixed, which will NOT happen at any\nchrysler/dodge/take your pick dealer.  I don't care if there are going to\nreform their dealers/service with the intro of the LH cars, I will believe\nit when I see it.  Case and point, the local dodge dealer.  You drive up,\njust looking, you don't even get out of your door, when about 10 (yes 10)\nsalesman all eye you like their next meal, and literally pounce on you,\nand try to get you to make a deal, on everything your eye wanders towards.\nService is about 2 times worse than that.  I had an alignment problem, but\nthey tried to tell me that the K frame was bent, and about 2000 dollars of\nwork/parts to fix it.  Let me tell you the problems I had, and I took care\nof this car, I put alot of miles on it in the first couple years, but took\nit to every checkup it needed, and many that shouldn't have been.\n\n1988 Dodge Shadow ES\n\nThese were replaced within the 4 years that I owned the car.\n\nEngine \n4 Alternators\nRear Suspension Torsion Bar\n2 Water pumps\n5 thermostats\nHall effect sensor\nMain computer\n4 Batteries\n\nThese were rebuilt/repaired\n\nRadiator\nAutomatic Transmission\nPower Steering\n\n\nThose are just the things I can remember off the top of my head.  For\nabout a year before I sold the car, I said to myself, it's a good car, I\njust can't find anybody competent enough the fix it.  In the end, before I\ntraded it in for a Saturn, the power steering started acting up again.  I\njust stopped putting money into it.  I must have put at least $5000-$7000\nworth of repairs over it's lifetime.  I am sorry but Lee Iacocca can bite\nme.  Bullshit, whoever backs em best, is just afraid the stupid things are\ngoing to fall apart, and no one will buy them without assurance, why the\nhell do you think that LH has been nicknamed Last Hope.\n\nYou can do better, and I know people will disagree with me here, but\nJapanese, like Honda, or Toyota, or the only american car company that I\nfeel is a quality product, Saturn.  I will not touch another chrysler\nproduct again, no way.  I don't care how good the LH cars look good, and I\nwill admit they look promising, but not with the support that you get.  GM\nisn't much better, thank god, they don't control Saturn, like they do\ntheir divisions, or it would be just another marketing ploy.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, i will be watching my car (which I do like) like a\nhawk for the next 4 years.  I am much more hesitant to say it (or any) car\nis really good, until it has proved itself to me.\n\nBut since someone else pointed out C&D as a source.  I will note, because\nI used to read these magazines, that Car and Driver has never had a good\nthing to say about most Chrysler products (Shadow for one), always were\nthey moaning about the reguritated K-car, and engine.  Whereas Motor Trend\nalways thought they were great cars.  No car magazine is really objective.\n\nAnd although there are alot of people who don't like Consumers Reports, I\nwill use them to reinforce my argument (I already know about the big stink\nwith the Saturn crash tests, time will tell how good a car they are), the\nshadow/sundance rate much worse than average, in fact none of the\nchrysler's rate a better than average, I think the best one is just\naverage.  Excluding the diamond star/mitsubishi stuff and the LH's.  You\ncan find bad stuff about the Shadow.  Try as I might, when I researched\nthe Saturn, I could not find anything bad about it.  There is a great deal\nof information about this company, just because it is a new american\ncompany and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community, for\ngood reason.  Much more than the introduction of any new model lines of\nany established company.  I read an article, which had a sub-column, an I\nthink this imprinted on me more than anything else.  Some big wig in\nToyota said and I quote, "We are watching them very closely."  Come on,\neverybody grow up, the foreign cars, especially the japanese have been\nkicking our butts, for good reason, the american car companies could not make\na good product or support the customer the way they want these days, to\nset in their ways, which is one of the reasons Saturn was created.  They\nare still struggling because they haven't learned yet.  They have the\nability, the workers are not inferior, the technology is not out of date,\nbut their attitude is, and they are just finding this out.  It's called\ncompetition gentleman/women if you don't satisfy the demand of the\nconsumer, well your out..  \n\n*asbestos suit on*
I was hoping for something like "The chassis exhibits X \ndegrees of flex when subjected to forces of more than Y units.\nForces of more than Y units begin to manifest at Z miles per hour."\n\n	Not "Well, gee, it wasn't designed to go fast because, uhh,\nwell, gee, it wasn't designed to go fast.  It's not a Porsche, you\nknow".\n\n\n	Well, as compared to the normal Taurus, the SHO comes\nwith more supportive seats,better brakes,a stiffer suspension,\ndifferent tires, and a body design that takes advantage of aero\neffects to keep the car on the ground (or at least I think that's\nwhat all that boy-racer plastic is for).  You're kidding yourself if\nyou think any car on the road has a passenger compartment made to\nwithstand 130 MPH impacts.  \n\n\n	Oh, right.  Only 120,000 dollar cars should be driven fast.\nThey drive goddamn Rabbits at 120 MPH in Europe, pal, and I reckon\na Taurus is at least as capable as a Rabbit.\n\n\n	Of course not.  "Speeding-is-bad.  Speeding-is-illegal. \nI-will-not-speed.  I-love-Big-Brother."  You had your mind made up\nalready.\n\n	It's interesting that lots of the roads out west had *NO*\nspeed limits until 1975.
Archive-name: rec-autos/part4\n\n[this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly\nasked automotive questions; the other article contains questions\nof general consumer interest, and is broken out to facilitate\ncrossposting to misc.consumers -- rpw]\n\n[last change: 8 February 1993; CT now permits radar detector usage,\n    new tire-traction q&a -- rpw]\n\n                Commonly Asked Questions\n\nRadar Questions:\n\nQ:  Where are radar detectors illegal?\n\nA:  In the US, currently Virgina and the District of Columbia prohibit\n    all usage of radar detectors.  New York prohibits their use in\n    large trucks.  In Canada, they are illegal in Manitoba, Ontario,\n    Quebec, Newfoundland and PEI (Prince Edward Island).  They\n    are apparently are illegal through most, if not all, of Europe.\n    Legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other\n    jurisdictions; chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal.\n\nQ:  Where are Radar Detector Detectors used?  Do they really work?\n\nA:  Usage is spreading rapidly; initially they were used only in Canada,\n    but now they are appearing in New York and Virginia.  It is unsafe\n    to assume that they are not in use in Connecticut and D.C.\n    They work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently\n    available super Het radar detectors; some brands of detector radiate\n    more strongly than others, and are thus more likely to be spotted.\n    New radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected\n    by the current generation of detector detectors.  Note that a\n    detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned\n    on.\n\nQ:  What is VASCAR?  Is it some kind of Radar?\n\nA:  VASCAR is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time-speed-distance\n    computer.  It depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target\n    vehicle passes landmarks.  No radar signals are emitted by a VASCAR\n    system.\n\nQ:  What is Ka band radar?  Where is it used?  Should a radar detector be\n    able to handle it? \n\nA:  Ka band has recently been made available by the FCC for use in the US\n    in so-called photo-radar installations.  In these installations, a\n    low-powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the\n    direction of traffic, and a picture is taken of vehicles which the\n    radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit.\n    Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle.  Because of the low\n    power and the 45 degree angle, many people believe that a radar\n    detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit,\n    although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such\n    capability anyway.  The number of locales where photo-radar is in use\n    is limited, and some question the legality of such units.  Best advice:\n    learn what photo radar units look like, and keep track of where they\n    are used (or else, don't speed.)\n\nQ:  Do radar jammers work?  Are they legal?\n\nA:  Quick answer:  No, and Not in the USA.\n    Detailed answer:  Cheap radar jammers do not work well at all.\n    Jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the\n    military.  Jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the\n    Federal Communications Commission of the USA.\n\nDriving technique and Vehicle Dynamics Questions:\n\nQ:  What are understeer and oversteer?\n\nA:  Understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a\n    car while cornering near the `limit' (limit of adhesion, that is.)\n    Most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to\n    be descriptive of the situations they encounter.  Simply put, they\n    tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner (steer `less',\n    or `understeer') or it wants to turn more in a corner (`oversteer'.)\n    Understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that\n    untrained drivers, inadvertantly traveling too fast, won't get into\n    trouble.  Understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle\n    in a corner.  Oversteer is designed into some more performance\n    oriented cars; it may be induced by lifting on the throttle (Trailing\n    throttle oversteer, or TTO).  In extreme cases, lifting on the throttle\n    may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or\n    spinning.\n\n    Some technical details:  in a corner at speed, the tires on the car\n    will develop what are called `slip angles'; the slip angle is the\n    angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling\n    and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to\n    travel.  In understeer, the front wheels have a greater slip angle\n    than the rear wheels.  In oversteer, the rear wheels have a greater\n    slip angle than the front wheels.\n\nQ: What is a rev-matched downshift?\n\nA: When downshifting, the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear\n   than it was in the higher gear.  However, during a downshift, normally\n   you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle, so the revs drop\n   rather than increase.  In rev-matched downshift, you blip the throttle\n   before re-engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to\n   the new speed.  This results in a much smoother and faster downshift.\n\nQ: What does heel-and-toe mean?\n\nA: Heel-and-toe is a technique used to do a rev-matched downshift while\n   braking.  This is normally challenging, because you need the right foot\n   for both the brake and throttle.  It is called heel-and-toe because you\n   use one end of the foot on the brake, and the other on the throttle to\n   match revs for the downshift.  In many modern cars this is a misnomer;\n   often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side\n   on the throttle.\n\n   Note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch, and just use the\n   left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle, accomplishing\n   the same thing.\n\nQ: What is double-clutch downshifting?\n\nA: While your right foot is doing the above, your left foot can do one of\n   three things:  nothing, declutch once, or declutch twice.  The reason for\n   declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the\n   transmission to the speed of the engine.  This is usually coupled with\n   rev-matching, so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch\n   engaged, the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission\n   speed up.\n\n   The procedure is as follows:\n   (0) declutch\n   (1) move gearshift lever to neutral\n   (2) engage clutch\n   (3) match revs\n   (4) declutch\n   (5) move gearshift lever to next lower gear\n   (6) engage clutch\n\n   This sounds like a lot of work, but with practice it becomes natural.\n   The problem that double-clutching solves is normally the function of the\n   synchronizers within the gearbox.  In transmissions without synchros or\n   with very worn synchros, double-clutching makes it much easier to shift.\n   Basically, if you double-clutch well, you are not using the synchros at\n   all.  This is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good\n   condition.\n\nQ: What do the numbers for acceleration from 0-60, 1/4 mile, skidpad, and\n   slalom times in the Auto Magazines really mean?  May they be compared?\n\nA: In short, 1) not as much as the magazines want you to believe, and\n   2) almost never.\n\n   In more detail:  the acceleration numbers (0-60mph and 1/4 mile times\n   in the US) may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the\n   same source.  Testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine\n   that comparing a Road & Track number to a Car & Driver number is quite\n   pointless.  Keep in mind, too, that the same variation applies from\n   driver to driver on the street; the driver is a major (often *the*\n   major) part of the equation.\n\n   Skidpads vary, and even if they didn't, skidpad figures are really\n   only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires; they change radically\n   when tire compounds change.  DO NOT make any assumptions about the\n   comparative handling of, say, two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers.\n   This is not to suggest that skidpads are without value, however. Skidpads\n   are an excellent educational tool at driving schools.  They are simply\n   of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires.\n\n   Slalom times are slightly more useful; they test some small parts of the\n   automobile's transient response.  However, they are also heavily influenced\n   by the stock rubber on the car, and they do not test many corners of the\n   car's envelope.  They DO NOT tell you all you need to know before making\n   a buying decision.  For example, they don't tell you what the rear end\n   of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off-camber.  When a car\n   has an adjustable suspension, these tests are usually done in the `sport'\n   setting, which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving.  The list of\n   caveats could go on for page after page.\n\nQ: My buddy claims that wide tires don't make any difference, according\n   to his freshman physics textbook, and that you can't ever accelerate\n   or corner at more than 1.0G.  Does he know what he's talking about?\n\nA: 1) in short:  he hasn't got a clue.\n\n   2) in more detail: the equations for friction used in freshman physics\n   textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth,  dry and non-deformable,\n   none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a\n   stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating\n   temperature.\n\n   Pavement is _never_ smooth; it is always irregular to a greater or lesser\n   extent.  Tires, which are not really dry and solid (as rubber is a\n   substance which in its natural form is liquid, and which has only been\n   coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic), deform to match\n   the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over.  In a tire\n   at operating temperature, grip is actually generated by shear stresses\n   inside the deformed rubber, and not by anything even remotely resembling\n   friction in the freshman physics sense of the term.  The colder a tire\n   is relative to its operating temperature, the closer its behaviour will\n   be to the traditional concept of friction; if much hotter than the its\n   proper operating temperature, the more likely the possibility of some\n   part of the tire actually ``reverting'' to liquid, which is mostly like\n   to happen deep in the tread, causing characteristic blisters and chunking.\n   (This latter, though, is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal\n   street driving, so unless you're a competition driver or do a lot of\n   high speed track driving, don't worry about it.)\n\n   Because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction,\n   it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all; thus dragsters\n   accelerate at more than 1.0G and race cars corner and brake at more than\n   1.0G.  Because simple friction does not apply, it is actually possible\n   for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of\n   grip.  An actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques\n   such as Finite Element Analysis, due to the complexity of the mechanism.\n\nMisc. Questions:\n\nQ:  What does <name or acronym> stand for?\n\nA:  Here is a list of some of the names which are commonly asked\n    about; be careful in soliciting the meanings of other names\n    as misinformation abounds on the net.  In particular, NEVER\n    ask in rec.humor if you want a useful result.\n\n    Saab:   Svenska Aeroplan A. B.,\n              or The Swedish Airplane Corporation\n\n    Alfa:   Societa Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili,\n              or The Lombardy Automobile Manufacturing Company\n\n    Fiat:   Fabbrica Italiana di Automobili Torino,\n              or The Italian Automobile Manufacturers of Turin\n\n    BMW:    Bayerische Motoren Werke,\n              or Bavarian Motor Works\n\n    MG:     Morris Garage\n\n\nQ:  Does VW own Porsche?\n\nA:  No.  Porsche is a publicly held company, controlled by the Porsche and\n    Piech families.  Porsche has extensive business dealings with VW/Audi,\n    which causes some confusion.  Since currently Porsche is in some\n    financial difficulty, there is a possibility that Mercedes or VW may\n    be interested in purchasing the company in the near future, but this\n    is only speculation at this time.

Last year produced: 1980.\n\n\n	Yes, there are still alot of MGBs out there.  The earlier cars (pre\n 74-1/2) are usually more desirable due to certain things that went with having \nchrome bumpers (ride height, generally more power).  The older cars are \nappreciating... slowly.  The newer ones seem to be at a stable level at the \nmoment.  $6 to $8k would require extremely good condition and low miles.\nIf the car is in good shape and regular maintenance is kept up on it, the car \nshould last for a long time.  There are still plenty of parts sources ouththere. \n The MGB is a great, fun little car.  If she is keeping it solely in the hopes \nthat it is going to appreciate, tell her to sell it.  It is not worth waiting \nthe time it would take to appreciate to a real profitable level.

From article <1993Apr5.200048.23421@ucsu.Colorado.EDU>, by lorenzo@rintintin.Colorado.EDU (Eric Lorenzo):\n\n--Let me put it like this.  The only similarity between the three models\n  is the "300", or 3-liter engine displacement.  Actually, the SC300 (the\n  coupe) and the GS300 (the funky-looking new sedan) share the same 3.0\n  liter inline-six, and the ES300 (popular small sedan) uses 3.0 V6 shared\n  with the Camry.  The SC300 is a luxury/sports coupe, the GS300 is the new\n  luxury sedan, and the ES300 is the base executive sedan.  All three look\n  completely different.\n\n--Aamir Qazi\n--
So its an automatic? Don't know if US spec=CDN spec. for Maximas.\n\n\nIf it is the first set of brake pads on front, then this is fine. My car\neats a set every 15k miles or so. The fact that he is replacing the\nmuffler too is also ok.\n\n\nThe mileage is fairly low - but typical fwd stuff is CV joints. Check\nthe maintenance records with the manufacturers requirements for valve\nadjustments, timing belt changes and so on.\n\nThe 60k mile service is often expensive, so make sure he has done everything.\n\n\nWell, this is one of the commonly cited methods for identifying a\ncar with highway miles. \nMight check the gas pedal wear too. Ask him how many sets of tires he\nhas been through. A highway car might have squeezed by on 2 sets,\na hard driven car 6-10 sets.\n\n\n\nWell, the Maxima should be pretty reliable - but if its out of warranty\nyou should get it checked out by someone knowledgeable first. Stuff\nfor Japanese cars can be expensive.\n\n\n1995 model year, I believe.
I'd go for a '39 Lincoln Continental if I could find one. Sad part is\nthat Edsel Ford designed it, and look at the abortion they named after\nhim. Ain't no justice.
Rob Reilly:\n\n\nThis is just not so - many of the earliest cars had their steering\ncontrols in the center of the vehicle, and there is no discernible\npattern of left- or right-hand steering controls until a few years into\nthe 20th century, when, in America at least, left-hand wheels became the\npattern. The mule team (or horses, I imagine) explanation, however,\nseems to have some merit.\n\nDan\ndh3q@andrew.cmu.edu\nCarnegie Mellon University\nApplied History
For an all out sports car, I'd go for the RX-7 without the sports\nsuspension (which is too stiff.)  For a little more practicality and more\ncomfort, the Nissan 300ZX Turbo is a good buy.  And for a good dose of\nluxury, the Lexus SC300 is perfect (with a manual transmission of course.) \nHowever, the Toyota Supra is coming out soon and if you like it's looks,\nthe performance is supposed to be great, almost race car like.  I don't\nparticulary like the Mitsubishi 3000GT's or the Dodge Stealths as they are\ntoo heavy and aren't very nimble handlers for a sports car.\n-- \nA motion picture major at the Brooks Institute of Photography, CA\nSanta Barbara and a foreign student from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
I would be concerned about how the car was driven and how well it was\nmaintained.  I own a turbocharged one, and I would never buy a\nturbocharged vehicle unless I knew the owner and his/her\ndriving/maintenance habits.\n\n\nI have been wondering about that myself.  The '90 AWD models and the\n'91s were identical (except for the ABS option).  \n\n\nYes.  Some owners had problems with the transaxles.  Using\nsynthetic lubricants in the transaxles solved the problem in most\ncases.  The problem was not unique to the AWDs, however.  It was\ncommon to all models.  The Galant VR4 and GSX had the same transaxle,\nbut I didn't see those listed in CR.\n\n\nI don't know of any major complaints in this area, except that the\nbattery that was installed at the factory had a low current rating. \n\n\nThe first FWD models (those built before May 1989) were recalled for\nbrake upgrades.  Some FWD and AWD owners had problems with warped\nrotors.  Those of us who insist on using manual torque wrenches every\ntime the lug nuts are tightened have never had a problem.\n\n\nI can refer you to someone who has gone through a set of pads in one\nday!  It all depends on how you drive.  It seems that most owners have\nbeen getting between 40-70k on a set of pads.\n\n\nFirst time I hear about a problem with the valve train on these cars,\nother than timing belt failures.\n\n\nIf your friend "beats" on the car, then his unit is not a\nrepresentative sample of the car's reliability.\n\nMy suggestion is instead of listening to the useless Consumer Reports,\ntalk to several owners (the mailing list may be the best way to reach\na few of them).\n\n\n#if (humor_impaired) skip_to TheEnd\nNo matter how much you pay, you won't get all three.  Examples:\n\nNSX:       reliability and looks.\nFerrari:   reliability ^H^H^H^H^H^H (yeah, right!) speed and looks\n\nTheEnd\n--\nThe opinions stated above are not necessarily my employer's.

I'm wondering if anybody else out there is a clutchless shifter? I've been\ndoing it my self over 200,000 miles, on my current toyota truck I've got\nover 150k. I've heard people talk about how doing this can damage a\ntransmission. My experiences suggest otherwise. What techniques do you use?\n\nOn some old pieces of junk I drove, the transmission was so\nworn that pumping the clutch was the only way to shift, except clutchless.\nTo date I've driven rabbits, datsuns, comets, fords & a chevy. Some where\nharder than others to shift but generally the higher the milage the smoother\nquicker & easier they where to shift.\n\nMy technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently\nwrist back on the shift lever. If for some reason I miss the shift window,\nI lightly press the accelerator & try agian. I've found that clutchless\nshifting is eaiser/quicker at high rpms (4000-7000). I also skip gears some\ntimes using 1-3-5 ,1-2-4-5.
I would probobly feel a hell of a lot poorer...   a gas tank is about\n50$ in a junkyard.   An engine... more!\n\nSeriously though, my other brother, DARRELL, left his VW on the same\nstreet...  someone stole the radiator out of it....  try finding a VW\nradiator in a junkyard  :-)    I DARE YOU !\n\nJD
I don't know if some lemons are out there, but from personal experience\nMy brother's has been trouble free.  Not one single repair, only \nregular maintainance.  The only work he had done on it was a result\nof his stupidity... he stopped suddenly in the middle of a left turn \non a busy intersection, and was rear-ended.  He has a 1989 Plymouth\nSundance.  I would recomend it, but I would also like to say that if\nyou can wait about six months, ChryCo is coming out with a new car\ncalled the Neon, that is built in the same way as the LH's where.\nGood luck with your desiscion.
OK...\n\n5) How about a fuel gauge that *really* told you how much fuel was\n   left.  Like, "can I make it to where the gas is $1.14 or should\n   I get gouged right here at $1.35?"  Accurate to the tenth of a\n   gallon would be great.
I saw an interesting product in NY Auto Show, and would like to \nhear your comments.\n\nMILITECH(tm) is yet another oil additive. But the demonstration of this\nproduct really impressive, if it didn't cheat.\n\nThe setup of the demo is fairly simple. A cone shaped rotor is\nhalf submerged in a small oil sink, filled with motor oil. The rotor\nis powered by an electronic motor. A metal pad is pressed against\nthe rotor using the torque wrench until the rotor stopped by friction. \nThe torque that is needed to stop rotor is read from the torque wrench.\n\nBefore MILITECH was added, the rotor was stopped with about 60 lb-ft\nof torque (You pick the brand of oil, no difference). Once MILITECH was \nadded to the oil, the rotor could not be stopped even with 120+ lb-ft of\ntorque. \n\nHere is the good part: even after the salesman emptied the oil sink, \nyou still could not stopped the rotor with the thin film remained  on it.\n\nThey say you need only add 2oz per quart of oil every 15k miles. A 16 oz\nbottle is $25.\n\nI still have my doubts. If this product is really so great, why it was\nso little known? The salesman said it is widely used in military. I didn't\nbelieve it.  The demo was so impressive, that I bought a bottle against\nmy common sense.\n\nHas anyone heard of or actually used this product? Is it real?\nIf you are going to the auto show, please visit this stand on the \nsecond floor. See if can find out if the demo is a hoax or not.
I had the exactly same problem with my '70 Lesabre. It was also from Cal.     What I did was go to the local junkyard and pick up a diaphragm from a '68      Lesabre with the same heater set up.  It worked for me, but a little bit slow   to change from vents to defogger.  Better than nothing!

Well, the MGB is currently in production for the English market, built\nby Rover. It now has a V8, improved suspention, and a slightly\nupdated body. Too bad it's only available in GB and would set one\nof us back about $42,000+.

Yes, but then someone would have no problem draining your oil in a parking lot.\n\nall they have to do is reach underneath, turn a valve, and forget the trip \nhome.\nBut there is less likelyhood they have a wrench with them.\n\nI personally recommend, installing a 'special' locking drain plug to keep\nvandals away. :---)
I find this method much better myself, too, although I do really\nhate it when the bolt finally comes loose and the wrench and my\nhand both come crashing into my face.  After coming to, which is\nabout 15 minutes later, I change my clothes (because by this time\nall the oil has drained *on* me), and ice my entire face and suck\ndown about 20 Tylenol to ease the pain.  Later in the day I then\nproceed with refilling the engine oil.\n\nIt's just crazy how I try and change the oil on my cars in one\nweekend---I go through about 3 bottles of Tylenol and 2 bags of ice.
Although, others have in the past and will continue to disagree\ni think that it is worthwhile to get an alarm.\n\n\n\nI think that it is important to protect your trunk, engine bay, all\ndoors.  I'd get flashing lights, LED's mounted on the drivers and\npassenger door and a relay to disable engine operation. Toss in \na glass break sensor, and shock sensor.

Bottom line:  I did it and it worked.\n\nSome 'tips and techniques' are included here:\n\n\nI found that I needed some smaller sockets to undo the shocks.\nAnd a can of WD40 helped...\n\nThe sockets needed were metric (exact fit) but I was able to use\nsome SAE sockets...  13/16 and 15/16 are rather close to 21 and 24mm...\nIt CAN be fun having a Canadian Ford ...\n\n\nDidn't have to undo the end bolts/bushings.  Just the 2 U bolts on\neach side and the shock absorber.  Jacking up the frame some more\n(had to put the spare tire on the garage floor and put a wooden \nplatform on top of that to get the 'floor jack' high enough to\nraise the frame ... I't one TALLL truck...) lifted the spring\nfree of the axel.  Taking out the block gave me enough room to\nundo the pin holding the spring pack together.\n\nThe spring pack was held together with a nut on top and a round head\non the other end....  No wrench head...  Vice Grips worked fine...\nI soaked the nut with WD40 and it came right off.\n\nFlipped the bottom spring and then...\n\n\nI donno ... I'm a little more sore today than after working on a\n1911A1 ...\n\nA 1.5 foot pipe cheater was a real help.  Torque spec for the U bolt\nnuts is 150 to 200 ft-lbs (!).   A 1911-A1 doesn't have that kind of\ntorque spec ...\n\nIt was a 'challenge' to get the 'pack bolt' back in the spring pack.  \nSqueeze pack with two hands, hold bolt with third, put nut on\nwith fourth while picking up wrench and vice grips with fifth\nand sixth hands ...  I used some string to tie the pack together\nwhile holding the pin in for alignment... then I could let go\nto get the {nut, wrench, Vice Grips...}.\n\nGetting the pin back lined up with the lift block was a challenge too...\nuntil I discovered that the axel had 1) Tilted and/or 2) rolled forward.\n\nOne the drivers side, a bottle jack under the front of the differential\ntilted it back in line enough for the pin head to drop into the right\nhole.  On the passenger side, I had to wrestle the wheel into rolling\nforward about 1/2 inch to get things to line up.  Spent more than an\nhour working on getting the pin head into the hole in the lift block\nwith levers and ropes and impliments of distruction before I took a \nbreak and thought about WHY it wasn't lined up anymore (since it HAD\nbeen lined up before, and *I* didn't move it, something ELSE must \nhave ... hmmm, axle no longer constrained not to move ... hmmm, move \nit back... hmmm...).\n\nAfter that, it was all much easier to 'close up'.\n\nBTW, the ride is now softer, but not quite as soft as I was hoping for.\nAt least it now sits level..\n\n-- \n\nE.

You must be _incredibly_ bored.  Have you considered reading the phone book?
The subject says it all. My 1984 Chev S10 Pickup's left turn signal does\nnot stop after turning. What cause this to stop automaticaly?. Is this\na mechanical problem by the steering wheel?.
By the way, what do people think about the Opel CAlibra?
How do you take off the driver side door panel from the inside\n   on an '87 Honda Prelude?  The speaker went scratchy, and I want\n   to access its pins.\n\nWhy are you posting this tripe to rec.autos.vw?
The SC1/SC2 has a shorter wheel base than the SL/SL1/SL2/SW1/SW2, just a \nthought. Ithink your right though......
Oh come on, Silly, all you have to do is cut a hole in your hood and \nput a tube there so you can get to the oil fill hole.  What do you\nthink all those big air intake things are for on those hot-rod cars?\nThey're just for looks only...little does anyone know, they provide\naccess to the oil-fill hole.
[stuff about RHD deSoto's deleted]\n\nAustralians still do drive on the "wrong" side of the road. I believe\nSweden changed in 1968. The way I heard it was that they swapped\nall the traffic signs around one Sunday....
I really must object to that last statement.  Having a lot of experience\nwith a '92 Grand Am coupe, I can firmly state that they do have a lot of\noutstanding qualities.  Very reliable throughout.  Great layout of controls\nand components.  Very roomy considering the exterior size of the car.  They \nlook sharp inside and out.  The V6 that I drive has exceptional power and \ndrivability compared to other similar cars that I have driven.\n\nAll in all, it's a fun-to-drive, dependable, and reasonably priced vehicle.\nPlease don't knock it with a statement like that unless you back it up with\nspecific reasons why you feel that way.\n\nRob\nbell@plains.nodak.edu
I was wondering if anyone out in net-land have any opinions on MGs\nin general.  I know they are not the most reliable cars around but\nsummer is approaching and they are convertibles `8^).  I'm interested\nin a 75 MG but any opinions on MGs would be appreciated.  Thanks.
A while back I asked for help in defending a traffic ticket I received.\n In short:\n     The ticket was for not stopping at a stop sign. Given the conditions\n   I could not stop in time and decided instead of sliding right through the\n   intersection, I would complete my right-turn and avoid a possible accident.\n   A police cruiser happened to be approaching the intersection from my left\n   and gave me the ticket.\n     The officer said "The only reason that you even slowed down in the first\n   place was that you saw me approaching, otherwise you would have bombed right\n   through"\n\n\n  I would like to thank all those who responded favorably to my request for\n help. To all of those who told me to bite the bullet and pay the fine:\n PHGHGHGHGH..\n\n The judge sided with me and decided that in this case "Not stopping" was the\n safest thing to do and found me NOT GUILTY.\n\n  The officer's statement and my account of the conditions at the time (very\n  slippery, backed by newpaper weather conditions) were the factors what made\n  the judge decide on his verdict.\n\n\n  Moral: If you have never been to court before and you think you have a case,\n	 go for it. It is a very interesting process, and it is there for\n	 your benefit. Exercise your rights.\n\n\n Trev
I prefer a manual to an automatic as it should be.  I believe that automatics\nshould only be manufactured for people with physical disabilities who otherwise\nwould not be able to drive.  Automatic transmissions allow drivers to be lazy.\nMore time is available to fiddle with the radio or to look at the scenery\ninstead of concentrating on the road.  The manual transmission keeps the drive\nalways doing something, granted it isn't a large movement.  Plus, driving should\nbe FUN!  Driving a manual is fun, driving an automatic is a chore.\n	In the case of shift speed, automatics can be made to shift far faster\nthat any human could move a stick.  If I was racing, I'd want and automatic.  For\nnormal driving go with the manual.
As a matter of interest does anyone know why autos are so popular in the US while \nhere in Europe they are rare??? Just wondering.....
: From: OPDBS@vm.cc.latech.edu\n: Subject: Taurus/Sable rotor recall\n\n:        My '92 Taurus GL with only 26k on the clock also has rotor warp.\n:    Apparently they HAVEN'T fixed the problem yet.  But try convincing the Ford\n:    service person to fix it for free...Right!!!\n\n:    Tony\n\n\nGads, I have heard so many horror stories with Taurus and Sable cars!  I thought\nthese were premium American automobiles.  The way they sell, you'd think so.\nIs Ford really no better than in the late '70s when it was turning out tin\ncans like the Granada and the Fairmount?  Which would you get, a Taurus or \na Camry or Accord?
Based on my experience with a '79 FJ40 ( the hard-top jeep-style model ) I \nwould definitely give a new model consideration if I were in the market. The\nolder models are VERY well built. Unless Toyota lost its mind, I would\nassume, until  proven otherwise, that the newer models have inherited some\nif not all of the qualities of their ancestors.\n\nTwo major differences in the running gear (that I'm aware of) need study.\nMy '79 has a solid front axle housing whereas the newer models have\nindependant front suspension. The solid axle is theoretically stronger and\nmore reliable than the newer model, but only experience will tell. The\nindependant front suspension is, no doubt, a compromise made to satisfy\nthe typical user, who will never need a real utility vehicle. The second\ndifference is the type of transfer case used on the newer models. I'm\nnot sure, but I think Tioyota went to a full-time 4WD or all-wheel drive\nsystem. The older Landcruisers have a "lock-up" type. Both have their\nadvantages and disadvantages.
an excellent automatic can be found in the subaru legacy.  it switches to\n"sport" mode when the electronics figure it,  not when the driver sets\nthe switch.. which is the proper way to do it, IMO.  so what does "sport"\nmode entail?  several things:\n\n1) revving to red line (or to the rev limiter in the case of the legacy)\n\n2) delayed upshifts.  (i.e. if you lift off briefly, it will remain in the\n	low gear.  this is handy if you are charging through corners and\n	would like to do without the distraction of upshifts when there's\n	another curve approaching)\n\n3) part throttle downshifts, based on the *speed* at which the pedal is\n	depressed, rather than the *position* of the pedal.  modern\n	electronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode.\n	this is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about\n	to turn red.  my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as\n	little as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough.\n\nalso, i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage\nthan a dumb driver with a stick, all else being equal.. remember that\nthe idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a\nbig assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to\nuse for each situation.. how many times have you ridden with an\ninattentive driver cruising on the highway at 55/65 in 4th gear (of a\n5 speed)?  \n\nhow many % of people who drive manuals *really* know what the best\ngear to use is for every conceivable situation?  i'm sure there will\nbe some who know, but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with\nall possible scenario/ratio combinations stored in ROM is likely to do\nbetter.  i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved\nwrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout... high gear,\nlow revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear, high\nrevs and small throttle opening.  the explanation is quite simple if\none sits down to think about it, but not that obvious at first sight.
Archive-name: rec-autos/part5\n\n[this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly\nasked automotive questions; the other article contains questions\nmore geared to the automotive enthusiast, and so is not crossposted\nto misc.consumers.  -- rpw]\n\n   [changes as of 14 April 1993: revised brake fluid section, as\n    non-silicone DOT-5 fluids are now apparently available -- rpw]\n\n                 Commonly Asked Automotive Questions\n\n\nTire Questions:\n\nQ:  What do the funny numbers on the sides of my tires mean?\n\nA:  Typically, you will see something like 195/60HR14.  the 195 is the\n    overall width of the tire in millimeters, the tread is usually\n    narrower.  The 60 is the `aspect ratio'; it indicates the height of the\n    sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width.  Our example tire\n    has a sidewall height of 0.60 * 195 ~= 117 mm.  The 14 is the wheel\n    diameter in inches; there are also some special tires called `TRX'\n    tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations, like\n    390, which is in millimeters.  The R means Radial, and the H is a speed\n    rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire, when properly\n    inflated and carrying an appropriate load, may safely operate.  Common\n    speed ratings are S (112MPH), T (118MPH), H (130MPH), and V (up to\n    150MPH.)\n\n    Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed\n    rating to a different part of the designation; you may therefore find\n    designations like 195/60R14 85H; the 85 indicates the per-tire load\n    associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous\n    operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice.  What follows is\n    a table showing a number of `load indices' and corresponding maximum\n    per-tire loads:\n\n    Load Index       50   51   88   89   112   113   145   149   157\n    Max Load (Kg)   190  195  560  580  1120  1150  2900  3250  4125\n\n    Note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table.\n\n    In some cases, the letters P or LT may be found in front of a tire\n    size; the LT designation indicates Light Truck, and the P designation\n    indicates Passenger car.  If no letter is given, then the application\n    of the tire is Passenger car usage.  As far as I know, these letters\n    only appear in the US market.  The LT designation is prinicipally of\n    interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles.  For\n    the owner of a passenger vehicle, there is no meaningful difference\n    between a tire with a P designation and one with no designation at\n    all.\n\n    If the aspect ratio is omitted, it is probably 80, but may be 78.\n\n    Tires with an MS (mud/snow) designation may have their speed rating\n    reduced by 20 km/h (about 12mph.)\n\n    There is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature,\n    traction, and treadwear.  Temperature and Traction are graded\n    A, B, and C (with A the best and C the worst); treadwear is\n    a numeric rating.  These values are of limited value, as they\n    are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are\n    thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires.\n\nQ:  My car has tires with a funny size designation:  185/65HR390; can i put\n    normal tires on the car?\n\nA:  Your tires are called TRX tires; they were devised by Michelin.\n    Because of a somewhat different bead design, they are incompatible\n    with normal tires; Michelin used a different diameter wheel for them\n    so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel (and so that\n    more conventional tires could not be mounted on TRX type wheels.)\n    You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your\n    car; it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels, and horribly\n    dangerous to do so (the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner,\n    or possibly blow out at high speed.)  TRX type tires are becoming hard\n    to find; in addition to Michelin, Avon makes suitable tires.  Goodyear\n    has apparently discontinued their line of TRX tires.\n\nQ:  Can I rotate radials from side to side, or rotate them only on one side\n    of my car?\n\nA:  Car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject; many\n    say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a\n    car is now ok (this group includes Michelin and Goodyear); others\n    (for example, Pirelli and Nokia) will void warranties if such swapping\n    is done.  The best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before\n    rotating your tires, and stick to the manufacturer's recommendations.\n\nQ:  How many snow tires should I buy, and if I buy 2, which end of the\n    car should I put them on?\n\nA:  In short, 4, and both ends.  To explain, many drivers in areas that don't\n    get excessive snow or who don't drive agressively (or at all) in snow\n    conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels, but there\n    are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice.  With a rear\n    wheel drive car, you can choose between being able to start the car\n    going (a function of the rear axle) or stopping and turning the car\n    (a function of the front axle.)  In a front wheel drive car, you start,\n    stop, and turn with the front end.  The primary risk of putting the\n    snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes\n    while going downhill, you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards.\n\nRadar Detectors and Speed Limits:\n\nQ:  Why aren't there any comments on Radar Detectors and Speed Limits\n    in this Q&A posting?\n\nA:  Because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between\n    misc.consumers and rec.autos.* always start long, tedious, and pointless\n    flame wars.  If you want to talk about either of these topics, please\n    subscribe to rec.autos or alt.flame and keep it there.\n\nSafety Equipment:\n\nQ:  Do airbags really work?\n\nA:  Preliminary statistics suggest the following:  Airbags work much\n    better than no belts; good 3 point belts alone work much better than\n    Airbags alone, and AirBags + 3 point belts work slightly better than\n    3 point belts alone.  The con to airbags is that some designs tend\n    to burn the driver's hands when venting the byproducts of the\n    explosion that occurs inside the bag, and that some designs (but\n    not all) may knock the driver's hands from the wheel, making retention\n    of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult.\n\nBrake Questions:\n\nQ:  Do I always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned?  Midas\n    always wants to do this.\n\nA:  No.  There are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing\n    rotors; some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors\n    more often than is strictly necessary.  if the rotors are not warped\n    warped, and only lightly grooved, then there is no need to replace or\n    to turn them.  Note also that some rotors (the rotors on many Hondas\n    are a good example) are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical\n    to turn them; they must be replaced when they become too thin, warped,\n    or badly grooved.\n\nQ:  They tell me I should downshift when braking to slow my car down.  Is\n    this really a good idea?\n\nA:  It used to be a very good idea, back in the days of mediocre, fade\n    prone drum brakes.  In modern disc brake equipped cars, use of\n    downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary, except in cases\n    of long, steep downhill runs.  Otherwise, modern disc brakes are more\n    than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances, and they\n    are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings.\n\n    On the other hand, many standard driver's license tests in the USA\n    still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking; I\n    suggest that before taking a US driver's test, you either 1) learn to\n    do this smoothly (which takes some time and practice) or 2) borrow a\n    car with an automatic to take the test.\n\nQ:  How often should I replace my brake fluid?\n\nA:  Probably more often than you do.  Traditional brake fluids tend to\n    absorb water; this water can corrode internal parts of the brake\n    system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid.  DOT-3 type\n    are older fluids; DOT-4 and DOT-5 are newer specifications.  The\n    principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points; the dry\n    boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid, but the wet boiling\n    point is important in older brake fluid.  DOT-3 fluids have the lowest\n    wet and dry boiling point _requirements_; DOT-4 fluids have better\n    boiling point requirements; and DOT-5 fluids have the best boiling\n    point requirements (but DOT-5 fluids are not clearly superior; see\n    the next Q&A for more details.)  While the requirements imply that\n    DOT-4 fluids are better than DOT-3 fluids, there may be specific\n    cases where a DOT-3 fluid is preferable, but these are mostly\n    competition applications.  Otherwise, DOT-4 type fluids offer _much_\n    improved brake pedal feel.  Replacement once a year is recommended for\n    DOT-4 fluids, although agressive drivers may profit by changing out\n    fluid more frequently, or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid\n    out of the brake calipers fairly regularly.\n\nQ:  What about DOT-5 brake fluids?\n\nA:  This breaks down in to two parts.  The DOT-5 specification looks\n    excellent for performance, but the first DOT-5 fluids were Silicone\n    based.  Silicone fluids are a tricky proposition.  Unlike DOT-3 and\n    DOT-4 fluids, they do not absorb water at all.  While this may sound\n    like a feature, the problem is that any water present pools up in\n    such systems, interfering with braking performance and corroding any\n    metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring.  The water will tend\n    to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers, where\n    most of the corrosion occurs.\n\n    Because of this phenomenon, it is essential when converting to\n    Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly\n    beforehand; some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the\n    brake system when converting to Silicone fluids.\n\n    Two other issues that come up with silicone fluids:  1) they are\n    difficult to pour cleanly (that is, without air bubbles), which\n    interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel, and 2) while they\n    generally have much higher boiling points than DOT-4 fluids, they\n    do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable\n    in effect from boiling DOT-4 fluids.  SIlicone fluids may make sense\n    in some street car applications, but they are certainly not\n    recommended for high performance driving applications, and the\n    economics are questionable for street use.\n\n    I have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the DOT-5 standard\n    that do not contain Silicones; these fluids appear to be reasonably\n    compatible with the older DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids, but I have little\n    information at this time.\n\nQ:  ABS is available on some of the cars I'm looking at, but it costs\n    more.  Is it worth it?\n\nA:  This does not have a cut and dried answer; therefore, this answer will\n    be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons.  The short answer\n    is that ABS costs more, both initially, and to maintain, will generally\n    work better for the `average driver' (that is to say, a driver who does\n    not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques),\n    and may require the `unlearning' of some obsolete braking techniques\n    like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case.\n\n    Now for the long answer.  ABS works by monitering the wheels of the\n    car, looking for signs of locked brakes.  It may or may not be able\n    be able to distinguish between the different wheels (there are several\n    systems on the market.)  It cannot detect impending lockup (which is\n    what you would really want in an ideal world), but only the existence\n    of lockup.  The sensors used vary; some of the less well designed\n    sensors are sensitive to tire size, and to brake pad material, and\n    may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original\n    equipment or OE-equivalent components.\n\n    When the sensors detect lockup, the ABS system responds by unlocking\n    the brakes (either individually, or all at once, depending on the\n    system.)  If the driver keeps their foot firmly planted, the ABS\n    will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states (if a\n    sensor existed that could detect _impending lockup_, then we could\n    sit right at that point, which is where maximum braking effect is\n    achieved.)  This pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal, as\n    the system cycles.  The percentage of the time that the brakes are\n    truly engaged is called the `duty cycle'; typically in an ABS system\n    this is about 40%  On dry pavement, a trained driver can beat this\n    duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking;\n    on wet pavement, braking is so chancy that ABS will outperform\n    threshold braking nearly every time.  Unfortunately, on mud and on\n    snow, often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes\n    locked; only Audi, of the manufacturers producing ABS-equipped cars,\n    has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the ABS system for this\n    eventuality.\n\n    A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves\n    steering control.  This is the case simply because, if you are\n    braking near the limit and turn the wheel, the ABS will release\n    the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup, and back off\n    on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied.\n    Braking distances will lengthen accordingly.\n\n    An important caution:  ABS cannot exceed the maximum theoretical\n    braking force in any given situation; if you start sliding on\n    glare ice, don't expect an ABS system to help you out very much.\n    The coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an\n    ABS system in your car.\n\n    As far as maintenence goes, in addition to the potential\n    restrictions I've listed above, you have to worry about the\n    following:  1) parts costs are much higher; the OE master cylinder\n    for my obscure european sedan lists for $185, but the OE master\n    cylinder for the ABS-equipped version of the same car lists for\n    over $1000.  Most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of DOT-5\n    (silicone) brake fluids in ABS-equipped vehicles.  Because of\n    the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system\n    components, regular (I suggest annual) replacement of brake fluid\n    becomes very important.\n\nQ:  What about this threshold braking business?\n\nA:  [normally, I'd not put this in the consumers Q&A, but recent\n    publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers\n    in ABS-equipped Chevy Caprices suggests that this section is\n    needed here -- rpw]\n\n    Threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high\n    performance drivers; if made a habit, it replaces the `stab\n    the pedal and lock 'em up' panic habit entirely, and is much\n    to be prefered.  Basically, the premise is that tires generate\n    maximum braking force when they have just started to slide, but\n    just before the wheels lock up entirely.  Drivers who threshold\n    brake learn to feel what this `threshold' feels like, and learn\n    to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake\n    pedal.  In many cars, you can feel that you are near the\n    threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it.\n    In any case, if you can't hear the tires whine just a bit, you're\n    not very near the threshold.\n\n    In a car with ABS, often there is a twinge in the pedal just\n    before the system starts cycling; if the driver backs off on\n    the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt, then they are very\n    close to the threshold and they'll probably achieve better\n    stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the ABS\n    take over.\n\n    Recently, there has been a rash of publicity over a number of\n    accidents, and one death, involving police cars equipped with\n    ABS systems.  The police departments in question quickly blamed\n    the new ABS systems, but according to Autoweek magazine, it now\n    seems clear that the problem was a lack of training; none of the\n    involved officers had any recent performance driving training.\n    There is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing\n    brake pedal by `pump braking', an old and discredited technique\n    of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal, the goal being to\n    try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system.  If you\n    think about it for a minute, you'll realize that pump braking must\n    cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least\n    1/2, so if you cut the 40% duty cycle of an ABS system by that\n    much, you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason.\n    Threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective\n    and useful technique regardless of whether your car has ABS; if\n    you do fear a failed hydraulic system, then one or two stabs at\n    the pedal will be sufficient.    \n\nGas Questions:\n\nQ:  Does High Octane gasoline help?\n\nA:  Maybe, maybe not.  Some cars have knock sensors, and can adjust the\n    engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used.\n    On most cars, however, you should use the cheapest gas that makes your\n    car run well.  Check your owner's manual for details on what your car\n    needs.\n\nQ:  My car was made for leaded gasoline.  Will unleaded gas hurt it?\n\nA:  It is possible that unleaded gas may *slightly* increase valve wear,\n    although the Amoco Oil company argues otherwise.  The actual increase\n    in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable, however, as modern leaded\n    gasolines actually contain very little lead.  You should, however,\n    check your owner's manual; many cars from the early 1970s do not\n    actually require leaded gasoline.\n\nQ:  Do fuel treatments help?  What kind should I use?\n\nA:  Some do and some don't.  During the winter, it is a good idea to use\n    dry gas; however, some may be harmful to fuel injection systems.\n    Never use an additive containing Methanol (sometimes called Methyl\n    Alcohol); such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs\n    and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection.\n\n    Manufacturer's opinions vary on additives containing Ethanol (sometimes\n    called Ethyl Alcohol); if your car has fuel injection, check the owner's\n    manual on your car before  using these.  Most manufacturers consider\n    10% Ethanol acceptable in gasoline.  Additives with Isopropyl Alcohol\n    (Isopropanol), and Petroleum  Distillates are fine in fuel injected\n    cars.\n\n    An occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with\n    fuel injectors, although many premium gasolines contain detergents that\n    do the same job.  Some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain\n    Ethanol or Methanol; always check the ingredients before putting anything\n    in your gas tank.\n\n    There are a small number of particularly good additives; these are\n    noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill ones, but work\n    much, much better.  Among these are Chevron Techron, Redline SL-1,\n    Wurth `Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber', and BG 44K.  A bottle of one of these,\n    once every six months, is highly recommended.\n\nQ:  What about detergent gasolines?\n\nA:  The quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat; BMW\n    has instituted a testing program, and gasoline brands which pass this\n    test may advertise that fact.  Stickers indicating passage of the test\n    are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations.  If such\n    gasolines are used, then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional.\n    Beforewarned that while use of BMW approved gasolines will keep a clean\n    engine clean, they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits.\n\nLubrication Questions:\n\nQ:  What do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean?\n\nA:  There are several different items encoded.  There is a two-letter\n    code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer	\n    uses in the oil; this looks like SE,SF,CD or such.  The S codes are\n    for gasoline engine applications; the C codes are for diesel engine\n    applications.  The second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels\n    of protection are developed; thus SF is considered better than SE,\n    SE is considered better than SD, and so forth.\n\n    The more noticeable designation is the oil weight.  This is either\n    a single number (e.g., 30 weight) or a pair of numbers separated by\n    the letter W (e.g., 10W30.)  The latter type is much more commonly\n    used these days, and are the only type that most automobile\n    manufacturers specify in operators manuals.  The first number in the\n    designation (10W) is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold;\n    the W stands for `winter'.  The second number (30) is the viscosity\n    of the oil when hot.  There is a trick here; the oil doesn't actually\n    get thicker (turn from 10 weight to 30 weight) as it gets hotter.  What\n    is actually happening is that when the oil is cold, it has the viscosity\n    of a cold 10 weight oil.  as it gets hotter, it doesn't get thin as fast\n    as a 10W oil would; by the time it is up to temperature, it has the\n    viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil.\n\n    Note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities; not\n    all 10W oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold, and not all\n    30 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot.  Note also that the\n    novel behaviour of multi-grade oils is caused by additives, and it has\n    been reported that with the sole exception of Castrol GTX, 10W40 oils\n    do not retain their multi-grade characteristics well over time.  10W30,\n    15W40, and 20W50 oils work very well, though.\n\nQ:  Are `quick lube' places any good?\n\nA:  Some do adequate work, but there are quite a few incompetent ones out\n    there.  Let the buyer beware, watch them while they work, make sure\n    that they don't overtorque the oil drain plug, and keep your hand on\n    your wallet at all times.\n\nQ:  Are oil additives like Slick-50 or Tufoil any good?\n\nA:  Slick-50 and Tufoil are PTFE-based additives.  Many of these have\n    come onto the market recently; they are different from the moly-based\n    additives that have been around since the early 50's.  PTFE is the\n    chemical name for Teflon(TM), a trademark owned by DuPont. In general,\n    auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products.  Most USENET\n    responses to questions on these additives are favorable (slight\n    increase of MPG after application, smoother revving) but long term\n    results (whether PTFE additives are effective after 5K miles) are\n    debatable.  Some manufacturers (such as Saab) claim that either the\n    product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes\n    deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage.  Some BMW owners\n    have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of\n    Slick 50 to their cars.  This writer has been cautioned by a Slick-50\n    Dealer (!) that Slick-50 should _not_ be used in Japanese motors, as\n    it may clog the oil return passages in the engine.  Otherwise, there are\n    no known reports of damage caused by PTFE additives.\n\n    On the other hand, there are satified Slick 50 customers in the world.\n\nQ:  Do synthetic oils really work?\n\nA:  Yes, but.  More specifically, most auto manufactuers accept synthetics,\n    but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by\n    oil manufacturers.  Auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to\n    change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your\n    car.  Even if you decide to try the longer intervals, at least change\n    the oil filter at regular intervals, as synthetics get just as dirty\n    as conventional oils.\n\n    Synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter\n    entirely; Amsoil, Redline, and AGIP are very highly regarded and very\n    effective.  Mobil 1 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews, however.\n\nQ:  Manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals.\n    How often should I change my oil?\n\nA:  It depends on how you drive.  If your car always (or nearly always)\n    gets warmed up, and you don't drive it very hard and keep the revs\n    down, the manufacturer's recommendation is probably fine.  If, however,\n    you drive it hard, drive it at high revs, or alternatively, if you\n    only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn't get up\n    to temperature, then you may wish to change oil much more often,\n    perhaps at 3000 mile intervals (given that most manufacturers are\n    now specifying 7500 mile intervals.)  If you don't drive your car\n    much at all (say 7500 miles a year), then you probably want to change\n    oil every six months anyway.  If you are storing a car during the winter,\n    then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out\n    of storage.\n\nMisc. Questions:\n\nQ:  My car has a timing belt.  I hear that bad things happen when they\n    break.  What's the story?\n\nA:  It depends on the internal design of the motor.  Early Ford Escorts,\n    for example, will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks, but\n    the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt.\n    Some Honda motors will not be damaged, but others will be.\n\n    If no replacement interval is specified for your car, then change the\n    belt at least every 60,000 miles; some cars may require more frequent\n    replacement.  Ask your dealer or independent mechanic.  Also, ask if\n    there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time\n    (for example, the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have\n    a timing belt driven water pump, which has been known to seize,\n    destroying the timing belt, and which then causes major valve damage\n    as a side effect.  Replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water\n    pump can be a costly mistake.)\n\nQ:  Why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it\n    self destructs when the timing belt breaks?\n\nA:  For performance reasons.  Compromising piston design so that the\n    valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression\n    ratio of the engine be reduced significantly; this is why you are\n    more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance\n    oriented vehicles.\n\nQ:  What causes Unintended Acceleration?\n\nA:  The final report of the National Highway, Transportation, and Safety\n    Administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be\n    caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the\n    same time be consistent with the physical evidence.  The NHTSA report\n    goes on to conclude that `pedal misapplication' by the vehicle operator\n    is probably the cause.

The big win with the V-1 is not its range but rather its\ndirectionality and multiple-transmitter tracking (which you later\ncalled a "gimmick" -- a conclusion I disagree with).  Since the\ndetector incorporates multiple receivers it's not surprising that it's\nsignificantly more expensive.  While the added capabilities may not\nhelp you, there is added value for those of us who live in areas where\nthere are a lot of false-alarms.\n\n\nI certainly call it "interesting" but I'm another person who thinks\nthat the added value might be coming at too high a cost.  Very\nadequate radar detectors are available for less than half the cost and\none of them has suited me rather well.  If I did more long-distance\ntravelling in areas I'm not familiar with I'd probably consider\ngetting the V-1 because it's additional information would be useful in\ndiscriminating false alarms.

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica\nGT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners\nincluded the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years).\nI narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling\n(and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less\nmoney and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury\ncar.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.\nI was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i\ndecided to stop by my insurance agent's office on the way.  I asked\nabout what would happen to my rate with either car.\n \n"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as\nthe Celica (the '85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that\nyear was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because\nthe car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue\nto handle your account.\n \n"If you buy the Porsche 924, we'll have to change you to the standard\n[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with\na 944, it's another story again - we'll cover the rest of this year,\nbut cancel you after that."\n \n"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually\nfaster than the [standard] 944.  That doens't make sense."\n \n That's what the book says.  We don't insure Corvettes, either.  For\nsome reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers -\nas very traditional and conservative."\n \nI eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche\ndealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure\nguy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken\na year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I\nconcluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto\ntheft.\n \n   /|/| /||)|/  /~ /\| |\|)[~|)/~   |   Everyone's entitled to MY opinion.\n  / | |/ ||\|\  \_|\/|_|/|)[_|\\_|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil\n========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======\n \n \n \n \n \n======================================================================== 32\n \nI live in Idaho.

I just ordered a Saturn SL1 after considering a few imports. Frankly, the Saturn\nway of doing business and service was a *very* big plus. I hadn't bought a new\ncar since I bought my Honda 4WD back in '85, and I was unbelieveably offended by\nmost salespeople I met.\n\nSaturn was indeed very different. I made three different visits to the dealer where\nI bought my car, and was never pressured. Saturn also had the best after-sales\nsupport, and the fixed pricing made it *very* easy for me to decide exactly what\nI wanted to buy. Another big selling point was running into my mechanic at the\ndealer. He's been fixing imports for 20 years...and bought a Saturn, based on\nwhat he's seen and heard from his customers. \n\nSaturn also has a good extended warranty program; $675 for 6 year/60K miles, \nfully refunded if you don't use it. That works out to an actual cost of $170 or\nso, based on the 6 year treasury rates. Using savings account rates it's more\nlike $120. In the first three years it also buys you free rental during any\nwarranty work, without counting against the refund.
Of course it releases radiation! Thats why your car goes faster when\nyou punch the holes in it. All that radiation gets on your engine\nand gives it "pep" (scientific term). You get more horsepower &\ntorque too! If you don't know what HP & torque are, you can read\nmile long threads on the subject, but they are all wrong. Horsepower\nis how much power a horse can make pulling a Subaru, and torque is\na name invented by Craftsman for a wrench.
Any advice on HOW to buy a Land Cruiser? My local Toyota dealer says they\nget two a year, and if I want one I can just get on the waiting list.\nForget about a test drive or even kicking the tires.\nAnd if they are that rare, I doubt there is much of a parts inventory on\nhand.
A "fuel injector cleaning" at the dealer is probably little more than\nthem opening your gas tank, dumping in a bottle of fuel injector cleaner,\nand sending you on your merry way $59 poorer.  Go to KMart and buy the\ncleaner yourself for $1.29.\n \nJust because you dealer sez you need it, don't mean it's necessarily so.\nBe suspicious.
Well, yes, the exhaust is where the majority of the noise comes out, but the\nbasics (tone, firing cadence, etc.) are determined by the engine configuration.\nIn the case of the Viper, yes, we are discussing a HUGE multicylinder 90-deg.\nengine, which will sound somewhat like a truck.  And my understanding, btw, is\nthat that V-10 engine was designed originally with the intention of being ad-\naptible for either the trucks or the Viper.  And from what I've heard (no first\nhand knowledge :-( ) it's doing a pretty good job at both.\n\nAnd the best exhaust sound in the world is now and will always be a 60-degree\nDOHC Colombo-designed V-12.  Period.
Place your hands flat on a table, and arrange the firing order from left to\nright.
Yes, there is:  consumer confusion.  In the early 80's with the\nfuel crisis, etc., everyone wanted better fuel mileage.  Diesel fuel\nwas the cheapest fuel available and usually provides better mileage\nthan comparable gasoline engines.  So, GM decided to conver their\n350 gas engine into a diesel engine (I think was a 5.7 liter).  Big\nmistake.  The engine was not redesigned, but converted.  The engine\ncould not handle the higher compression, etc.  Lots of problems with\nthese cars.  This thew up a big red flag to the casual observer --\nDON"T BUY A DIESEL.  THEY ARE BAD.  This was a gross generalization.\n\nAsk yourself this question -- if your livelihood depended on driving,\nLOTS of it, would you use a dependable or undependable (but cheaper\nin the short run) vehicle?  What do Greyhound busses have in them?\nTrailer Trucks?  Even Train Locomotives?  Are these gasoline engines?\nNo, they are diesel.  Tractor trailer truck manufacturers provide a\n500,000 mile warrantee with they vehicles.\n\nI own an `82 Diesel Suburban.  The 6.2L diesel is a GREAT engine.\nJust keeps going.  It was more expensive (when new) than the gasoline\nengine vehicle was.  The only problem with diesel engines is that \nwhen they need to be rebuilt, they are expensive.  In a gas 350\nengine, you will pay about $1000 for a rebuild.  Diesel 6.2L is about\n$2000.  But then again, the diesel engine lasts about twice as long\nand gets about 50% better mileage.  A carburator for a gasoline engine\ncosts about $100 to rebuild (or less).  A rebuild of the fuel injection\npump on a diesel will cost about $500 (or more).  But then again,\nyou never need a tune-up.\n\nIf you're looking at a rebuilt 6.2L, I'd say you got a great deal.\nCheck to see if the fuel injection pump was rebuilt also.
Take a look at mini-vans.  I sat in a Dodge Caravan, which had a high seat\nand plenty of headroom.
Thanks to everyone who responded to my Honda Accord break question.\nIt does seem that the master cylinder is bad. I will have my\nmechanic double check and be sure it isn't something simpler\nand cheaper first, but from your responses it sounds like it\nis very likely to be the master cylinder.\n\nThanks everyone!!
Sounds a lot more like an Opel GT to me. I'd guess that this is on the same\nchassis as the Kadett, rather than the bigger Manta - but I could easily\nbe wrong.  I think the later Kadett's were sold here as Buick Opels.

I sold my '86 Sprint last April with 95k on it.  I'd driven it since\nthe previous July, putting 20k miles on it.  The sensor light used to\nlight up regularly, starting about 5k miles after I bought it.  \nMy brother and I rebuilt the engine but used all of the original equipment,\nso I suppose the sensor could have used replacement.  Performance (hah,\nif you could call it that) did not change.  Perhaps emissions increased,\nbut how much emissions could a CA-registered 3 cylinder engine produce?\nThat was a neat car, I held the engine block easily in one hand!  Has\nanyone ever driven the 'Turbo' variant?  Just curious...
recently-manufactured locomotives have wheel-slip detection systems\nthat use frequencies shared with police radar (i forget which band).\nthese will set off your radar detector if you get close enough, though\ni believe the range is pretty short.

Oh PULLEEZE!\n\nIt's not biology at all, it's clothing design.  Women's clothing is\ngenerally designed to be as non-functional as possible.  It's only been\nin the last five years or so that you could buy women's pants with\npockets deep enough to carry anything in.  Previously, deep pockets were\nvirtually unknown in women's clothing.  Skirts generally have better\npockets now, too.  Dresses, espcially fancy dresses, are still pretty\nhopeless.  I often hand my driver's license over to my husband if we're\ndressed up to go out somewhere, so I don't have to be encumbered by a\npurse.\n\nIf women consistently bought functional clothing, and boycotted the\nmanufacturers who refuse to make functional women's clothing, I think\nmanufacturers would tend to bow to market pressures.

I am thinking about getting an Infiniti G20.\nIn consumer reports it is ranked high in many\ncatagories including highest in reliability index for compact cars.\nMitsubushi Galant was second followed by Honda Accord).\n\nA couple of things though:\n1) In looking around I have yet to see anyone driving this\n   car. I see lots of Honda's and Toyota's.\n2) There is a special deal where I can get an Infinity G20, fully\n   loaded, at dealer cost (I have check this out and the numbers match\n   up). They are doing this because they are releasing and update mid-1993\n   version (includes dual air-bags) and want to get rid of their old 1993's.\n\nI guess my question is: Is this a good deal? \nAlso, Can anyone give me any feedback on Infiniti?\n\nThanks,\n\nCarl Hoffman\n\nP.S.
I have to disagree with this.  I have a 92 Z28 with a 350 and a 4-speed auto\nw/ overdrive, and it is really better that way.  Chevy autos are reknowned\nfor their long life and ability to handle copious amount of power.  I live \nin the Dallas area, and a manual would be much harder to drive in the traffic \nhere.  Now if I still lived out in the sticks like I used to, a manual would be\nmore fun.  \n\nSafety-wise, an auto is less distracting...I would hate to have to be    \nshifting gears while I was trying to ease into traffic in the freeways here.\nPerformance-wise, I can hold my own against any stock 5.0 Mustang or 5.0\nCamaro w/ a five speed.  \n\nAll of this IMHO... :)

I am currently in the car market and would like opinions on a VW\nPassat GLX.  How does it compare to a Toyota Camry?  I thought the car\nlooked very solid, stable and European.  Only disappointment so far is\nthat that it doesn't offer an airbao my next question is, why isn't VW\noffering automobiles with airbags?  Should I pay the extra three\nthousand for a BMW 318 is even though it is smaller and less powerful\nthan than the Passat?

Ah, we are looking for good people just like you. We are a very concerned\ngroup of citizens who are absolutely disgusted at the way that the majority\nof drivers simply disobey traffic rules like going above the speed limit,\npassing on our right, and riding our tails, while all the while we respectfully\nabide by the rules of this great country and maintain the mandated speed\nlimits with our calibrated, certified cruise controls, while keeping the\nrespectful 1.5 car length distance/10 mph speed. How many times have you been\nticked off by some moron who jumps ahead in the (5.5 * 1.5)8.25 car lengths \nthat you have left between you and the vehicle ahead of you while driving\n55 mph? Finally you have an option.

Back to the F1 stuff for a second, note that the `auto' tranny in F1\n_STILL_ shifts at the driver's command, not some preselected schedule.  The\ndriver still controls the shifting, not the transmission. \n\n\n          ^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nI have yet to see a torque multiplier installed on a production automobile. \nSuch systems do exist, but none are presently installed in production autos\nthat I am aware of.  These are commonly called viscous drive CVTs or\nfluidic amplifiers. \n\n\nWhat the convertor _does_ allow is for the engine to be closer to its\ntorque peak during the launch before a clutched car can fully engage it's\ndriveline.  Chevy proved it many years ago with the '70 Camaro (ETs and\nterminal 1/4 mile times were close enough tpo be identical for 4 speed and\nauto cars).  Note that this is also the major reason that an auto car can\nget away with fewer gears than a manual, the slip in the convertor makes up\nfor the fewer ratios (and before everyone starts yelling about the proposed\n5 sspeed autos soon to be out, note that some manufacturers are using 6\nspeed manulas now). \n\n\nCorrect.

Ford tried that also, back in 1983.

The only time I got it right was when I was getting the\nannual state-required safety inspection!\nNot one of Ford's better ideas.

Ok, I'll bite.  How is this supposed to work?
I know it's a long shot, but maybe someone went through this and will have\nsome comments to share.\n\nThe story is this: I bought a car out of state, and I'm trying to get\nthe safety inspection in Pennsylvania. The problem is that the car has \naftermarket tint on all windows except the windshield. The tint is rather\nweak, and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint.\n\nThe inspection garage said that they won't pass it unless I get a\nwaiver from the state police. So I went to the state police - the\nofficer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal, and I can get a\nwaiver only for a pre-84 car or for a medical reason. I asked him to\nshow me the section of the vehicle code that says it's illegal.  He\nshowed it to me and the paraghaph said that you can't have tint, if\nyou can't see the inside of the car because of the tint. When I told\nhim that you can in fact see the inside very well, he shut the book\nand said "It's just illegal, and in fact we can have someone give you\na ticket for it right now." Well, won't argue with that...\n\nSince the vehicle code says it's OK as long as you can see through the\ntint, I'd like to keep it (I'll re-read the vehicle code in the\nlibrary).  I'd also like to get some sort of paper from the police\nthat says it's OK, so I can get the inspection, and so that I won't\nget in trouble for the tint later on. I also wouldn't mind registering\na complaint against that officer - he really pissed me off.\n\nSo does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper from\nthe police, especially in Pennsylvania? Does anyone have any experience\nregistering a complaint against an officer? I called the station \nlater on today, but they basically said there is no place where I\ncould register a complaint against an officer... And if I do decide\nto keep the tint and get a ticket anyway, how much of a chance do\nI stand to succesfully appeal the ticket in court?\n\nAny comments about it will be welcome!

MK48T02 from thomsom.  It has a timekeeper (clock) and 512 bytes of NVRAM which\nhas a lithium battery backup.  The battery has a life of ~10 years of poweroff\noperation.  Installed in a car it could be left powered on continuously and not\ndraw much current.  The battery would only be used when your auto battery was\ndead or had been removed.\n\n\nIn California they have a line on the transfer of ownership form which states\nthat the odometer mileage is correct.  If incorrect you are required to \nfill in what you know (or guesstimate) to be the correct mileage.  If you\nlie on this form and are caught you can be prosecuted and the buyer can\nsue you for the value of the mileage differential.
I had exactly the same problem with a 1981 Horizon.  Third gear would\njust disengage.  Engine would rev up.  Kind of disconcerting.\n\nI sold that car quite a few years back but the memory of that tranny\nsticks with me.  It also had a clutch chatter in first that the dealer\ncould not fix.  If the lemon law had been in place then, that car\nwould have been covered.\n\nI have had several Jap cars since then (figuring the Horizon was my\ncontribution to the American Auto Companies), and have never seen any\nbad behavior with the exception of a Toyota Tercel with a bit of\nclutch chatter that they did fix on the first try.\n\nAnyway, from that day forward, I have sworn that I would never\npurchase another American car with a standard.  American manufacturers\ndon't have a clue on how to manufacture five speed transmissions and\nhave been doing the automatics much longer and on many more cars.\nHowever, I hate automatics, so I am still buying Jap cars.\n\nNot sure this is any help, but other cars do this too.\n\nCheers, Larry\n--\n    @@               Larry Rogers               *\n   @@@               larry_rogers@dg.com        *   Big Brother\n   @@@ &&&           larry@boris.webo.dg.com    *   is Watching\n    @@ &&            Data General  508-870-8441 * \n\nThe opinions contained herein are my own, and do not reflect the\nopinions of Data General or anyone else, but they should.
Checker Motors went out of business in 1982.  It's hard to get\nold Checkers that are worth restoring, since almost every one was\na fleet vehicle that was driven into the ground.  If you can get a \nbody in decent shape the mechanicals should all be available _somewhere_ - \nChecker used whatever parts were around.  For instance, I had a Chevy\nstraight six and a GMC Truck radiator and a Ford rear in mine.\n\n\n	Actually, you want a Checker Special if you can find one.

What do you find so wrong with the flat 6 in the Subaru's, or the flat 4 for that\nmatter?
think again!!  thanks to 60 minutes (tick tick tick), used 200\nquattros are bargains.. '89s go for about $15K, '90s go for perhaps 1\nor 2K more, the 20 valve 91's are quite a bit more because of an\nenormous hp and torque gain.. i think they go for about $23 to $25K if\nyou can find one.  i have seen quite a lot of '89-'90 200 quattros (not\nthat many wagons though) at the dealer lot.. they use very high\nquality paint and the entire car is zinc galvanized, so it will never\nrust.\n\nin short, typically a 4 yr old 200 looks no more older than a 1 year\nold and the 5 bangers are bullet proof engines.  200K out of one is\nnot rare, even for a turbo, which is watercooled for the 200s.  then\nthere are aftermarket chips that you can buy to bump up turbo boost...\n\nif you are into luxo-gizmos.. the cars are loaded with just about\neverything too..\n\nthe price of parts is a different story though...
Anybody got any good/bad experience with selling their car through one of\nthose car hunters?  I'm selling a 1991 Dodge Stealth R/T and I was contacted\nby this company called the Markham group based out of Illinois.  \n\nThey said they have 7-10 buyers in my area interested in my car or they wouldn't\nbe talking to me.  They talked to me for a good 20 minutes asking everything\nabout my car and said they could sell it no problem.  They guaranteed that if\nthey didn't sell my car in 75 days, I would get my money back ($389) and since\nI charged it, I'm protected by federal law which states that if I'm not satisfied,\nI would get a refund (which is true).  They federal expressed all the paperwork \nto me which had a contract stating their policy about the 75 days and such.
I'm considering switching to Geico insurance, but have heard that\nthey do not assign a specific agent for each policy or claim.  I was\nworried that this might be a real pain when you make a claim.

Left hand steering wheel placement was not standard until the 20's in the\nUS. Driving on the right has been standard since standards came into being.\nInterestingly, Chrysler has just begun building right hand drive cars again\nfor export to Japan.
Most cars have drain petcocks in the radiators, and I've never \nseen nor heard of a vandal opening one.  I imagine that there\nwould be an even lower risk with an oil plug because you have \nto crawl furthur under the car to open it.  \n\nCar vandals are usually real traditional in their methods, and do things\nthat don't get them dirty, like keying your car, dumping sand, sugar\nor mothballs in the gas tank, TPing it, etc.

Sometimes a bad choke pull-off diaphram will cause a car to fast idle. The\npull-off, which is vacuum actuated, provides a necessary pull in non-cold\nweather conditions to get the idle off the the fast idle cam. Locate the\nfast idle cam on your vehicle and see if you can rotate it to produce a\nnormal idle. If so, locate the diaphram and test it. If you can't apply\nsuction (via a good piece of rubber vacuum hose) with your mouth that will\ncause the diaphram to retract, then it's bad and should be replaced.

Does that mean that they're gonna bring back the Biscayne and Bel Air?
assuming yours is a non turbo MR2, the gruffness is characteristic of\na large inline 4 that doesn't have balance shafts.  i guess toyota\ndidn't care about "little" details like that when they can brag about\nthe mid engine configuration and the flashy styling.\n\nmyself, i automatically cross out any car from consideration (or\nrecommendation) which has an inline 4 larger than 2 liters and no\nbalance shafts..  it is a good rule of thumb to keep in mind if you\never want a halfway decent engine.  \n\nif the noise really bugs you, there is nothing else that you can do\nexcept to sell it and get a V6.

GM, at least, is heading in that direction.  One of the post-sale\nquestions they asked me was if I'd like the choice of a cigarette\nliter or an accessory plug, and another whether I'd like the choice of\nan ashtray or a cup holder.\n\nThe '93 Geo Storms have the cigarette lighter vs accessory plug option\n(which did not exist in the '92 I bought) -- I'm not sure about the\nash tray vs cup holder.

Hi netters,\n\nMy friend is seriously thinking of getting the Subaru SVX. There is\na local dealer here in Seattle selling them for $22600, with\nTouring package, that's $7400 off from MSRP. He thinks it's a \nvery good deal (and I think so too). Since he knows I have access to\nthe net, he would like to get anyone's opinion about this car, especially\nin the area of reliability and maintenanability.\nPlease send e-mail to me as my friend doesn't have access to the net.\n\nMy opinion about this car is, you get a lot for $22600:\nauto everything (tranny, climate control, windows, locks, folddow rear seet),\nfull wheel drive, 2+2, fast (143 top spped), heavy (3580lb);-)\n\nThanks in advacne!
hand.\n\nLand Crusier is just simply nice with shit-load of power and room.\nFully stocked, it cost ~$40,000.  I think it is worth the money.\nOnly problem is when you get into accident(it doesn't usually break down\nunless you forget to get a oil change for 30000 miles or something\nstupid like this), body parts and other parts are very hard to locate. \nParts are over priced also.  One of my friend had accident in past snow\nstorm and he is still waiting for front bumper and passenger side fender.\n\nWell, if you test drive Land Cruiser, all other SUV look like toys.\nOne of magazine writer called it "Land Bruiser".  \n\nIf you have $40,000 to spare for SUV, get Land Cruiser and forget Lange Rover.

That's nothing.  When a friend of mine went shopping for a small\nsedan a few years ago, she brought me along as a token male so\nthe salespeople wouldn't give her the "bimbo" treatment.\nHer first choice was a Mazda 323, and second choice was a Nissan\nSentra.  We went to a Mazda dealership and described what "we"\nwanted.  We started negotiating on the price, and the salesdroid\nkept playing the "let me run this price by the sales manager".  After\nplaying the "good salesman, bad salesman" game, we finally told him\nthat if he didn't have the authority to negotiate a price, perhaps\nwe should be speaking directly to someone who did.  He brought in\nthe sales manager who proceeded to dick us around with every trick\nin the book.  (Read Remar Sutton's "Don't Get Taken Every Time" for a\nlist.)  Finally, after playing a few more rounds of "you'll have to\nwork with us on this price", also known as "each time you come up a\nthousand dollars we'll come down ten", the salesmanager gave a signal to\nhis two sales cronies, stood up, and said "well, we can't come down any\nmore so I guess we can't help you" and they trouped out of the room,\nleaving us sitting in the salesman's office all by ourselves.  Hmm.\nI'd read that sleazy salesmen sometimes bug their own offices so they\ncan leave and listen in on couples discussing the sales offer, and\nI mentioned this aloud to my friend while we were sitting there wondering\nwhy they would leave us in the office instead of showing us to the\ndoor.  For lack of anything better to do, I picked up the phone on\nthe desk and called another Mazda dealership, asked for a salesman,\nand began discussing what kind of price they would consider.  A few\nsentences into the conversation, Mr. Salesmanager broke into the line\n(!) and began telling me how rude he thought it was that I would call\nanother dealership from "his" phone!  I said that since he'd announced\nthat our business was over, he shouldn't care, and every time I tried\nto talk to the other sales guy the sales manager would drown out our\nvoices with his own.  (How did he know that I was using the phone,\nanyway?)  Finally, I hung up and we headed out of the showroom.\nSales manager and cronies come out of a little unmarked room and he\nbegins to berate us again.  We say that we won't bother him anymore,\nwe're going next door to the Nissan dealership.\n\nThen comes the part I wish I could have videotaped.  As we go out\nthe front door, the sales manager SHOUTS across the entire showroom,\ncustomers and all, "Go ahead!  You DESERVE to buy a Nissan!"\nSo my friend bought a Sentra.
Women's pants rarely have pockets and most, when they do, are too\nshallow to use!\n\nI is very important for a woman to have her keys in her hand when\nshe goes from building to a car.

It is much more covenent\nthan the pants pockets and looks better.\n\nHaving a car that unlocks quickly and locks back fast is\nparamout to a woman's safty. Men don't see this as a problem.\nA woman is aware of this every time she goes out!

G'day people,\n	\n	Are there any MR2 owners or motor-head gurus out there, that know why\nmy MR2's engine sounds noisy? The MR2's engine is noisy at the best of times, \nbut not even a nice nose - it's one of those very ugly noises. \n	I do an oil change every 2-3 months, and for about 2 months the engine\nnoise sounds relatively quiet during driving and idling. At around the 3 month\nmark, after an oil change (I've been tracking this very thoroughly for months\nnow) it starts to get that very disgusting noise, not so much during driving,\nbut more so during idling. \n	What's its problem? \n	Also.. I don't know if it's just me, but if noticed a little\nperformance drop. It just hasn't got the acceleration it used to. \n\n	Any help/tips would be appreciated!!
My GS came with XGT V4s and they are NOT all weather tires.  I took\nout my right front bumper sliding on packed snow (not ice), before I learned\nthis fact.

The Michelin dealer\nwhere I bought my new tires said the V4s were made out of a different \nrubber that gets really hard and slick when the weather gets near feezing.  \nSaid he'd only try to sell me those tires during the winter if we were in\nTexas and not Colorado.\n\nThanks,\nEric
Hi Folks,\n\nI recently bought a 1981 Mercury Capri (my first car ever!).\nI have noticed a few problems with the car :\n\n	1. It gives very low gas mileage (something like\n           11 miles / gallon ; I hear other car owners speak of\n           gas-mileage figures like 25 miles/gallon (wow!) etc.).\n\n	2. When I start the car, it goes into high idling (something\n           like 1500 (or is it 15000 ?) rpm. After driving 4 or 5 miles, \n           it comes down to 300 (or 3000?) rpm. \n\nI would like to know if there is any way by which I can fix these\nproblems. Or is it natural for an old car like this ? (it has\ndone about 117,000 miles). Someone suggested that I change/rebuild/\nrecondition the carburettor. I am not prepared to do it\nunless I am sure it will fix the problem. And yes, I got the\ncar tuned-up recently (within the last 200 miles or so).\n\nPlease let me know if you have any suggestions. Please respond\nby email since I don't scan this newsgroup regularly.\n\nThanks.\n\nRegards,\n\n--Sudhi.\n\n-- \nSira Gopinath Sudhindranath. email : sudhi@ucs.usl.edu.
Sorry, by "they" I meant autobahns, not US freeways.\n\n\nWell, I've driven in every state but Alaska, and drive about 60k per year.\nI take long cross country trips any chance I get - its fun for me and I\ncan get reimbursment.\nMy job allows me to drive rather than fly. Not to labor the point, but\nI've driven just about every freewayin the US, Germany, UK and France plus\nsome in Mexico, which was surpisingly good.\n\n\nYes, but as a %age of the total freeway in the US? \nAll you have to do in this case is mark the hazard, advising people to\nslow to 85 or so. \n\n\nTexas freeways are varied, sometimes a good surface. Mostly flat. But,\nI5 in CA is comparable and hilly.\n\nGiven the absence of other traffic and car built for 130 (e.g. 535) \nmost US freeways are just fine. The problem is other road users and\ncops.
I am presently doing a masters thesis to do with traffic intersections in \nNew Zealand but a lot of the books I am researching from, are from America or\nAustralia and so I was wondering if anyone could please tell me what the road\nrules are in either country with regard to intersections.\n\nThanks\nJulian Visch\njsv@math.canterbury.ac.nz
If you don't already know it, you should call the bank/credit union/\nfinance company that holds the loan on your present car and get the\ncurrent payoff cost.\n\nIf you are trading in your current car on the new car, subtract the\npayoff amount from the trade-in the dealer is giving you.  (If this\nturns out to be a negative number, you need to reconsider the deal.)\nSubtract this difference from the price of the new car.  This is the\nsize of the loan you will need for the new car.\n\nThe dealer will take care of paying off the loan on your old car out\nof the money you give them when you pick up your new car.\n\nAt least that's how it worked for me 5 years ago in Ohio...

One thing that everyone is forgetting in this argument\nover the pricing of the SC1 vs. the Japanese cars is\nthe Saturns "no-dicker sticker".  This makes the Saturn's\nprice low in comparison to the inflated base prices of\nthe Japanese competition on paper, but in reality, one\ncould dicker several hundred dollars off the price of\nthe Japanese cars.\n\nAdmittedly, though, here in Canada, at least, the SC2 \nis in the same price class as the Civic Si, not the\nSC1.
From article <1993Apr16.162950.25849@newsgate.sps.mot.com>, by markm@bigfoot.sps.mot.com (Mark Monninger):\n\n\nA couple of months ago I went to a dealership to test drive a car.  Afterwards,\nwe sat down to discuss prices.  I explained that I wanted a car just like the\none I drove, but in a different color.  He said he could get one exactly like\nI wanted from the dealer network within a day.  We then negotiated a price and\nsigned the deal.\n\nNext day, I get a call.  He explains that they goofed, and they had neglected\nto take into account a price increase. (The last price increase had occurred\nover 4 months prior to my visit.)  If I still wanted the car, I would\nhave to fork over another $700.  As an alternative, they would honor the\nprice if I bought the car I test drove (which had been sitting around for \n6 months and had a few miles on it). I said goodbye.  This was a good\nexample of how they can lowball you and still cover their butts.  It's too\nbad more people don't demand honesty or these types of dealers would\nno longer be in business.  \n\nThe next dealership I went to was straightforward and honest.  First thing the\nsalesman said was, "Lets's see what you have for dealer cost and work out\nhow much profit I should make."  The deal went through with no problems.
So, how did you guys *learn* this? Is it something you were\nborn with, or did you make horrible grinding noises the first few\ntimes? (how many times?)\n \n   I would think you'd have to have a certain amount of "feel"\nfor it to begin with. Some people would never get it, and others\n(like me) would never have the guts to try it, unless maybe you\nwere planning to buy a new transmission anyway...\n \n   (BTW, I've heard that quite a few truckers and race car\ndrivers shift this way).
Hi, maybe someone can help me here...\nI am looking to buy this 1990 Nissan Maxima GXE for CDN$14000 right now.\nThe car has 96000 km (or about 60000 miles) on it.\nA typical mileage for 1990 cars seem to be about 70000 km (or about 43K mi).\nThe seller just informed me that when he brought the car in for certification\nhe was told that the front break pads and the exhausts had to be replaced\nto meet the legal standards.  (He said he will replace the components before\nselling the car to me.)\n\nBeing copmletely ignorant to the technical stuff on cars, I don't know\nwhat this could mean...\nIs 96K km about the time typical for replacing the above mentioned items?\nOr is this an indication that the car was abused?\nWould other things break down or have to be replaced soon?\nThe seller told me that he used the car on the highway a lot, but,\nI don't know how to verify this...  I've seen the paint chipped away\nin tiny dots in the front edge of the hood, though.\n\nAlthough the Maxima is an excellent car and the car is very clean and\nwell kept, it's currently out of warranty\n(a similarly priced '90 Accord with 70K km will have 2 years or 30K km\nworth of warranty left) and I don't want to worry about paying for\nany repair bills...\nBut, I also need a car for 5 people...  \n\nWhen will the new Maxima come out, by the way?\n\nI would very much appreciate your input in this.\nPlease reply by e-mail (preferred) or post in this newsgroup.\nThanks!\n\nRyan

Les Bartel's comments:\n\nLet me add my .02 in. I had a A/C installed by the Ford garage and it did not\nwork as well as the A/C that was installed by the factory in pickups \nidentical to mine. I have talked to other people that have had the same\nresult. Don't know if this is just a probable with Ford or what??

How about those toneau covers? I've been thinking of building one\nfrom chipboard for roadtrips. Any comment on how they affect\nmileage in highway travel?\n\nCharles
The best auto-shifters on the street (AND NOT THE TRACK) are those from \nPorsche... they wont change if you floor the gas during a turn.... a few \nyears back a was in a 200SX auto (you guys call it a 240SX [without turbo])\nand was going round a corner.... I floored it and next thing I know I was \npointing backwards! The other drivers seemed quite amused ;-)

The quality of autobahns is something of a myth. The road surface\nisn't much different to a typical TX freeway. They are better\nin terms of lighting, safety, signs, roadmarkings etc. I'd have\nno problem driving 130 on most US freeways, as it is, I save it\nfor the backroads, which really are more likely to be dangerous.\n\n\nIt would have to be quite severe. I don't recall any US freeway,\nwithout road damage warnings, that i would regard as unsafe\nat 130 in any decent, well damped car. Note that my definition\nof decent, well damped, would exclude most typical American sedans.\n\n\nI don't know where you live, but I would be much more worried\nabout cops, other traffic etc. than the road surface at 130.\nIt just isn't that fast or that dangerous. If you have a Probe\nGT, no problem. The 4cyl models I have driven would be\nlikely to be unpredictable at higher speeds.
There is just something disconcerting about the name of this group. :)
From article <1qkkl5INNbvo@hp-col.col.hp.com>, by theckel@col.hp.com (Tim Heckel):\n\n--When I was selling Nissans last summer, I sold a '92 SE-R in early August\n  when its supply was getting quite scarce.  The car was black with ABS, \n  Value Option Pkg, and power moonroof.  I sold it for $12,900 plus tax.\n  Naturally, my manager didn't really care to sell one of the most desirable\n  SE-R's for virtually no profit (to the best of my knowledge).....\n\n--Aamir Qazi\n\n--
Archive-name: rec-autos/part1\n\n[most recent changes, 15 March 1993: addition of alt.autos.karting -- rpw]\n\n               === Welcome to Rec.Autos.* ===\n\nThis article is sent out automatically each month, and contains a general\ndescription of the purpose of each of the automotive newsgroups, and\nsome suggested guidelines for discussions.  The keywords `Monthly Posting'\nwill always appear to make killing this article easy for users of\nnewsreaders with kill facilities.  This article is posted to all autos\ngroups, but followups are directed only to rec.autos.  If you don't\nunderstand what this means, ask your system administrator for help, or at\nleast for copies of the newuser documentation.  Failing that, please\nsubscribe to the newsgroup news.announce.newusers and read the\ndocumentation provided there.\n\nIntroduction to the Rec.Autos newsgroup hierarchy:\n\nrec.autos.tech\n\nis intended for technical discussions of automobiles, their design,\nconstruction, diagnosis, and service.  Other discussions are largely\ninappropriate, especially For Sale ads.\n\nrec.autos.sport\n\nis intended for discussion of legal, organized competition involving\nautomobiles.  Technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they apply\nto competition vehicles.  Discussion from either of two viewpoints,\nspectator and participant, is encouraged.  Arguments about sports cars are\nlargely inappropriate, as are most other discussions.  For Sale ads are\ninappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles and/or equipment.\nDiscussions of illegal events are marginal; one should probably avoid\nadvocating breaking the law.  (remember, the FBI reads Usenet!)\n\nrec.autos.driving\n\nis intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles.\nAlso, if you must discuss 55 vs. 65, or radar detectors, or <insert\nyour pet driving peeve> boneheads, do it here.\n\nrec.autos.vw\n\nis intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership\nof automobiles manufactured by Volkswagen (this includes VWs, Audis,\nSeats, etc.)  It was created on the grounds that the info-vw mailing\nlist was very successful.  It should not be presumed from the existence\nof this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many\ndifferent marques; groups specific to individual marques should only be\ncreated on demonstration of sufficient interest, via some avenue such as\na mailing list.\n\nrec.audio.car\n\nis not properly part of the rec.autos.* hierarchy.  it is, however,\nthe correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment, and\nso is mentioned here.\n\nrec.autos.antique\n\nis intended for the discussion of older cars (usually more than 25 years\nold, although this is not a hard-and-fast rule.)\n\nalt.hotrod\n\nis not part of the hierarchy, but also of potential interest to the\nrec.autos reader.  it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing\nlist, and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing\nperformance vehicles.\n\nalt.autos.rod-n-custom\n\nalso not part of the `official' hierarchy; devoted to that peculiar\nAmerican hobby of customizing older cars.\n\nalt.autos.karting\n\nfor the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby, karting.\n\nrec.autos\n\nis intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics.\n\n\nCrossposting:\n\nCrossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on\nthe Newsgroups: line in the article header; such articles will appear\nin all of the newsgroups listed.\n\nCrossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on\nUsenet.  You should only post to a group because you feel an article is\nappropriate; you should NEVER crosspost just to reach a particular\naudience.  This distinction is subtle, but important.  Radar Detector\narticles, for example, are more-or-less appropriate in rec.autos.  They are\nalmost never appropriate in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio, and the fact\nthat you might want to reach the audience in sci.electronics or\nrec.ham-radio is NOT adequate justification for posting to either group.\n\nCrossposting between any or all of the rec.autos.* groups is usually\ninappropriate; if you find yourself doing so, consider whether or not it is\ntruly advisable, before sending your article.  Consider setting Followup-To:\nto point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost.\n\nCrossposting between rec.autos.* and misc.consumers is chancy at best; in\nparticular flame wars over the speed limit in the US and/or the use of\nradar detectors should NEVER be crossposted between any of these groups.\n\nMost readers of sci.electronics and rec.radio.* couldn't care less about\nthe police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in\nrec.autos.\n\nIt is an excellent idea to check the Newsgroups: and Followup-to:  lines of\narticles before posting a followup.  In particular, be wary of posting to\nmisc.test, rec.arts.startrek.*, or talk.bizarre, or any combination of these\nthree.  The life you save may be your own.\n\nDistribution:\n\nThere is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to\n(partially) control where the article goes; it is called the Distribution\nfield.  It may be very useful for many reasons; it should also serve\nas a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system.\n\nThe distribution of rec.autos.* is fairly extensive.  As of this writing, \nthe Automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of Europe, Australia,\nNew Zealand, and some locations in Japan.  With this in mind, I offer the\nfollowing hints about use of the Distribution: field in your article\nheaders, and on article content.\n\n1) Please take care not to send for-sale ads about clapped out Ford\nMavericks in New Jersey to France or California; i doubt that anyone in\neither place will care, except for my girlfriend, who for some strange\nreason likes Mavericks (but only 4-door Mavericks, at that.)\n\n2) When posting technical questions, please include the market for which\nyour car was manufactured.  For example, there are a number of differences\nbetween a European-market Ford Escort and a US-market Escort.  Likewise,\nall 1750cc and early 2000cc Alfa Romeos reached the US with Spica Fuel\ninjection; European market cars usually got carbs (often Webers).  These\ndifferences can be important to your readers; make your situation clear.\nFailure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant\nspread of misinformation.\n\n3) Be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting;\nin the US we get a mix of Metric and English system values, whereas\nEurope is almost entirely on the Metric system.  A future edition\nof this monthly posting will contain a list of commonly-used\nabbreviations that may not be known in some places that rec.autos\nreaches; this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it.\n\n4) Use the Distribution: field to limit where your article goes, when\npossible.  Within North America, the values na (north america), can\n(canada), and usa may be used.  in addition, the two-letter state\nabbreviations of the US are supported in some cases; e.g. if i wanted\nto send an article only to New York and New Jersey, i could put\n"ny,nj" in a Distribution field.  note that multiple, comma-separated\nvalues are legal.  these distribution fields vary widely, however, so\nyou should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely\nto be supported in your area.\n\nThe Dangers of Overgeneralization:\n\nTo amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article:\nBe wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars, tires, etc.  What is\ntrue for a 1973 Buick with a 455cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a\n1976 Honda with a 1200cc engine.  Headlight laws in Sweden are decidedly\ndifferent from those in Idaho.\n\nThe Need for Adequate Specification:\n\nWhen you ask a question, please give a reasonable amount of information;\ne.g., if you have a question about your Honda, please specify year,\nmodel, engine size, etc.  Otherwise, most answers to your question may be\nquite useless.\n\n\nConcerning Lemons:\n\nAt one time or another, every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or\ntwo; even Honda admits to this.  Please don't waste everyone's time by\nannouncing to the world that your `brand x' automobile is terrible, so all\n`brand x' automobiles are terrible, so no one should ever buy a car from\nthe `brand x' company.  Such articles are worse than useless, because they\ncause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful\ninformation.\n\n\nConcerning Flames:\n\nAs much as we might wish it, a flame-free newsgroup is something that most\nlikely will never occur.  Here are some guidelines for flames and how\nto deal with them (a list of flame-prone topics follows in the next section\nof this posting):\n\nIf you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory, don't imagine for a\nminute that including the words `No Flames' will work.  It won't, and\nyou'll get exactly what you deserve.\n\nIf you're going to flame, you're more likely to get away with it if you can\ncite a fact or maybe a well-known reference.  No one is likely to believe\nbald, unsupported assertions.\n\nBe careful about who you choose to insult.  Consider not insulting anyone.\n\n\nAsking the Question:\n\nIt is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like `Please\nsend email, I don't read this group'.  It is a much better idea to\nend the question with `Please send email, if there is sufficient interest\nI'll summarize the results in a later posting.  I may miss posted responses\nto this request'.\n\nAnswering the Question:\n\nIf someone wants to hop up their Yugo, don't tell them to get a Mustang.\nEither be silent, or give them useful advice.  If someone wants advice on\ndefending a speeding ticket, don't tell them to obey the law next time --\nit's offensive, presumes guilt which is not proven, and doesn't directly\naddress the original question.  In general, don't post in order to see\nyour words in print, and don't post in order to enjoy feeling smug and\nself-righteous.\n\n\nStale and/or Inflammatory Topics:\n\nCertain topics are considered stale by `old timers'; while discussion of\nthem is certainly ok, and new, factual information is welcome, ravings\nabout them are extremely tiresome, and may get the person who posts them\nignored altogether.  Some topics are naturally inflammatory; it is\ndifficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them.  Some\nof these topics include the following:\n\n1)  the 55mph speed limit in the US: Pro and Con\n\n2)  discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of\n    radar detectors.\n\n3)  discussions over which radar detector is best.\n\n4)  discussions over what is a sports car (this is one reason why\n    rec.autos.sport is not a `sports car' group -- everyone would argue\n    about what constitutes a `sports car'.)\n\n5)  disputes over whether or not US Federal law protects the driver's\n    right to own and operate a radar detector\n\n6)  `Buy American' discussions\n\n7)  `clever' bumper stickers and personalized license plates\n\n8)  <insert nationality here> cars are terrible\n\n9)  What kind of car did Maxwell Smart drive?\n      [when I have a complete, accurate answer it will be added to the\n          commonly-asked questions article which is also posted monthly.\n          Until then, please don't waste bandwidth on this topic. -- rpw]\n\n\n\nPlease direct comments and suggestions about this article to:\n\n     welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com
Howdy,\n\nI'm a little new to this newsgroup, but I would like to tap some of the\nknowledge and expertise available here.\n\nThe Subject:  After-market cruise controls\n\nThe Background:\nI recently broke my ankle in a road-bicycling accident (4 places, five \nscrews, yuk! :-( ).  In two weeks I will be returning to Texas (my\nhome) from my school (BYU) in Provo, Utah.  As you can imagine, trying to\ndrive nearly 1300 miles with a broken right ankle isn't just the epitome of\na good time.  My car does not have a cruise control, so I would have to do\nall the pedalling (ha ha) with my messed-up ankle.\n\nMy question:\nWhat is the general opinion of after-market cruise control units?  I\nrealize that a cheap CC (cruise control) from, say, Pep Boys, isn't going to\nbe as good as a factory or professionally installed unit (if there is such a\nthing).  And I uderstand that I probably can't expect much in the way of\naccuracy, looks and that sort of thing;  But anything's gotta be better than\ntrying to drive with a hosed ankle.\n\nI have a 1984 Jeep Cherokee, 4 speed, standard, 4*4, 2.5L engine with\nkettering(sp?) ignition (y'know, distributor cap, rotor, that set-up--not\nelectronic.  Maybe you could've guessed it being an '84, but I'm just trying\nto give information as completly as I can).\n\nI found a CC unit for 80 bucks.  It seems to use the vehicles vacuum system \ninstead of an electric servor/motor.  Is this good or bad?  If I did buy\nthis CC, which vacuum hose should I tap?\n\nIt has two speed sensors:  One magnetic, and one that gets a signal from the \nnegative side of the distributor, kinda like a tach pick-up, or so I\nunderstand.  I can use either one.  Which is best?  The manual says (I read\nit in the store today) that the magnetic/axle set-up is more accurate, but\nharder to install.  Is there really a big difference?\n\nIt has a sensor for the brake pedal, just like other CCs, but does NOT have a\nsensor for the clutch pedal.  So if I wasn't paying real close attention I\nmight push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up.  Which\nwould wind the engine up kinda high until I got my wits about me and turned \nthe thing off.  I'm pretty coordinated, so this doesn't bother me, if it\nwere for my girlfriends car, *then* it would bother me, but I'm ok with it.\n\nThe installation also calls for an attachment to a steady-on brake signal\nand a switched-on brake signal.  I think I can get a switched brake signal\nfrom the correct side of the brake light blade fuse.  Am I right?  But I'm\nnot sure where to get the steady-on brake signal, or, for that matter, what\nexactly it is?  Any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get\nit?\n\nI think I can figure the other things out.  Like how to hook-up the negative\nside tach-type sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit, and the ground and\nall that miscellaneous business.  But I need a little help with:\n\n	1.  Is it worth the money and safety risk (if any) for such a\n	    device?\n	2.  Is there any particularly good after-market CC?\n	3.  Are "professionally" installed CCs signifacantly better and\n	    worth the cabbage?\n	4.  If the unit I saw (sorry, no manufacturer or model number, just\n	    that it is at Pep Boy and its $80) is sufficient for my simple \n	    needs, how do I get the thing installed properly (specifically,\n	    the questions above)?\n\nMy father and I built a "Veep" (Volkswagen powered Jeep CJ-2A) when I was in\nhigh school, so I consider myself fairly good with tools, electronics, and\ncars.  So the installation doesn't scare me.  I just want to be certain that\nI get the thing installed correctly as my Cherokee is just a wee bit more\ncomplicated than my Veep. :-)\n\nI appreciate your time in reading my post, and I would appreciate any\nexpertise or opinion anybody has on the subject.  If you would like to share\nsome of your wisdom, please email as I don't get over this group very often\n(but I check my mail all the time).\n\nAgain, thanks for any help anyone may have.
You can be sure they wouldn't do it if it wasn't to their advantage.
I offered to relay this information for a ham friend of mine without\nInternet access:\n\nHis name is Robert (Bob) Wondolowski, N1KDA, and his car was a \n1985 Brown Cutlas Sierra Sedan, Massachusetts plate 716ADL.\n\nHis HT (Yaesu FT415) and mobile antenna were also included in the car.\nIt was stolen from Lynn, Mass. about 10 days ago (being on April 6).\n\nIf anyone has any information about the car's whereabouts, please e-mail\nme.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this message.\n\n\n===============================================================================\n===============================================================================
Are there any Honda groups out there?  Especially ones that deal with\nPreludes?
Why don't you look again at Motor Trend's, slalom times, they are 67.9, right\nalong with the Integra, and the car does that with small 14 inch tires that\nare all -weather XGTV4, not to mention that the Integra rides alot better than\na Beretta.\nYour acceleartion times also vary, magazine to magazine\nRoad & Track and Car& Driver have the GS-R at 6.8 to 8.0 for Road and Track.\nAlso Quarter mile times vary from 15.4 to 16.1\nYou can't tell exactly by the numbers.  Furthermore, the Integra will\ndefinately outrun the Beretta on the high end.  Car & Driver and Road & track\nhave the GS-R doing 136 to 141 mph, and it gets there fast.\n\n\n***You always believe those exact numbers, why don't you drive a GS-R, and see\nfor your self, while the GS-R has a low 117 torqye, its high gearing over a 8000\nrpm make up for the difference (still wouldn't call it a torque moster though!)\n\n\nQuad 4 reliable, yeah, what's your definition of reliable- if that's reliable,\nthen its safe to say that integra engines in general are near perfect\n (not to mention, a hell of alot smoother and quieter - balance shafts.The Acura has the engine\n   wins the reliablity contest hands down. You can rev that car all day, everyday,\nand you'll never blow a hose, or crack the block, or anything else. (I speak\nfrom expierence!)\nI'm not saying the Quad 4 is a bad engine, but don't highlight reliability when you\ncomparing it to a Acura Engine.  AND while the Integra costs alot more, it is a\nbetter investment since it will hold its value considerably much better.  And\ndoes a nice job at being a sporty car and practical at the same time.
I remember this happening on the I-75 through Michigan and Ohio several\nyears back. A group of guys in an old beater would rear end a car,\nusually out of state or Canadians. You stop and they smack you with a BB\nbat. At least they didn't kill you for the sake of a car.\nI think the cops put out decoys and this calmed down for a while.
rboudrie@chpc.org (Rob Boudrie) writes...\n\n\n\n\nFOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY\n\nOn the other hand, if it can be proven, it's possible the changed \nterms could be thrown out.  The question will be whether the \nagreement contains a merger clause.  See UCC @ 2-202 (parol \nevidence).

Ok if you are so right, name a few good examples that were brought up.\n\n\njohn
I consulted with someone working on an electronic odometer.  The\ndesign was to use a microprocessor based system to write a somewhat\nofuscated pattern into an EEPROM.  The idea was to make the circuit\ndifficult to program arbitrary values into the EEPROM.  The\nsecondary purpose, acutally the primary purpose from the standpoint\nof practicality, was to distributed the writes so as to avoid\nexceeing the maximum number of writes fof the EEPROM being used.\nThe microprocessor also ignored pulses coming from the Hall effect\nat a rate any higher than 110 MPH so as to make spoofing the reading\nby bench pulsing at least somewhat undesirable.  This was for an\nautomobile that was not expected to ever exceed 110 MPH in\noperation.  The case, of course, might not be the same for your\n1993 RX-7!\n\nThe ECM modules of some cars do indeed store info about conditions\nunder which cars have been operated.  Since steering angle and\nvelocity data, etc is available it would not be difficult to\ncollect all sorts of interesting demographic information about the\ndrivers' use of the car.  I am not aware of any manufacturer\ncurrently trying to enforce warranty restrictions based on reading\nout use data from the ECM.  While it could be a potential invasion\nof your privacy for manufacturers to have access to data about your\ndriving style, it could also provide valuable information from\nactual field use conditions to help engineer more appropriate cars.\nI personally wouldn't mind the dealer collecting my driving\ndemographics as long as it is done in an anonymous fashion.
Well, there *is* a difference.\n\nI don't happen to have my SAE manual handy, but oil viscosity in general\n_decreases_ with temperature.  The SAE numbers are based on a `typical'\ncurve that oils used to all have, running from (say) the viscosity of a\nroom-temperature 90-weight at 0C, down to (say) that of a room-temperature \n5-weight at 20C, for a typical 40-weight oil.\n\nOils that are designed for operation in `normal' temperatures just have\na weight specification.  Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly\ncold temperatures have a `W' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold\nplace, you'd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer,\nto approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year.\n\nModern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature.\nAs a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves.  A multi-vis\nspecification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a `normal' operating\ntemperature and a `cold' one (though I can't remember the numbers...).\n\nIn any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference.  Remember\nthat your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat and\nradiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or\nsomething.\n\nAny weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonized\noil.  Thin oil won't (in general) lubricate as well at temperature,\nthicker oil will (like a 20W50) will lubricate better at temperature, \nbut not as well during startup, when most engine wear occurs.  \n\nIf you're planning on making long drives, the 20W50 is probably fine\n(esp. in the summer) in your 10W40 car.  But if you're making short drives,\nstick to the 10W40.
Depending on how you plan to use your SUV, I might recommend also\nbrowsing Trailer Boats and one or more of those Pickup, Shotgun,\nand 4WD magazines.  The car rags mostly seem to consider recently\ngraded pea gravel to be offroading and ten sacks of redwood chips\nto be a bedload.  Considering that most of these SUVs seem to be \nused mostly as robust station wagons, that's probably not a bad\napproach, but if your applications are more demanding, pick your\ninformation sources accordingly.\n\nOf the three vehicles on your short list (Explorer, 4Runner, \nPathfinder), I'd recommend the 4Runner as being closely based \non a rather robust pickup and the Explorer for being comfortably \ncarlike.  Don't know much about the Pathfinder.
Society, as we have known it, it coming apart at the seams! The basic reason\nis that human life has been devalued to the point were killing someone is\n"No Big Deal". Kid's see hundreds on murderous acts on TV, we can abort \nchildren on demand, and kill the sick and old at will. So why be surprised\nwhen some kids drop 20 lbs rocks and kill people. They don't care because the\nmessage they hear is "Life is Cheap"!

The 1941 Lincoln Continental was the first car to sport the "continental\nkit." The continental kit is not to be confused with ye olde outside\nmounting bracket; a continental kit is a very specific ornament/storage\ncompartment.

Quoting Jeffrey J. Nucciarone's (nucci@microwave.gsfc.nasa.gov) article \n<C4G8Hv.Cs4@skates.gsfc.nasa.gov> of 04-06-93, in pertinent part:\n\n JJ>   I am considering buying a used '90 Taurus SHO.

There has been a clutch \nreplacement program; you might check to see if the car is still eligible, \nas it is a change well worth making.  You can also swap the cruddy cable \nshifter for the newer rod shifter, also a change worth making, but that'll \ncost you some $$.\n\nMy brakes usually do one wibble-wobble on startup, so that is probably \nnormal.  Didn't know they had a self-test, that's interesting.\n\nWhat kind of tires does the car have on it?
Chances are that this has been discussed to death already, and\nif so could someone who has kept the discussion mail me or direct me \nto an archive site.

I'm about to buy a new car and finance some of it.  Since I paid\ncash for the last car I bought I did not have to worry about\nwhether or not I had a good amount of insurance on it because\nof a bank loan.  I just put the amount that I wanted (not what\na bank would have wanted).  Friends are telling me that banks\nrequire some kind of insurance on the car to protect it since it\nis collateral on loans.  Is this true?  Can that insurance be\ngotten as part of my other insurance?  I assume I don't have to\npay a dealer for extra insurance over my regular car insurance.\nAm I correct?  I hear about accident/health type insurance at\nthe dealers and I am pretty sure these are just money makers\nfor them.  I just want to verify that I don't _have_ to buy\nthese at all.  Or any other types of extras.\n\nWhat do I have to pay for?  Car, tax, license.  Anything else?

No, that sounds pretty reasonable for that car and that city.\n\nUnless you have an accident, you won't need more.  If you plan on\npaying for the car with a credit card, check and see if your card\nautomatically covers rental cars.  Also, your own auto insurance may\ncover rental cars also.\n\nMost rental companies here offer extra insurance when you rent, and\nrequire you to initial in several spots if you don't want it.  The\ncredit cards and personal auto insurance provide the same sort of\ncoverage that the rental agency is trying to sell.\n\nI have never rented from Alamo, so I don't know if they follow this\nsame practice.\n\nYes.  It is a compact 2-door, probably a bit dull performance and\nacceleration-wise, but very adequate.  It will have an automatic\ntransmission, AM/FM stereo, air conditioning, and possibly power \nwindows and door locks.\n\nJoe

Awww, right, you want all the home mechanics lined up against a wall and\nshot eh?\n\nBull Pucky you chicken! Read the service manual and get your head out of the\nsand! Certainly there are tools for the job that are cheaper than an alignment\nrack, that do the job as competently (albeit, not as swiftly), if not\nmore accurate, due to the natural pride an owner/mechanic places on his work.\nYou can do an `acceptable' job of aligning a car using simple tools and\nsome imaginative work that would *never* have the effect of endangering\nanyones life. The worst that happens is that your tires wear oddly (well,\nyou could have the wheels aiming TOTALLY pigeon toed and not be able\nto steer the car, raise your hands those that think their vision is\nso poor that they would screw up this badly!)\n\nI bet you are one of those people that feels that honing a cylinder wall\nwith sand paper will kill millions of people. It aint magic. Go take the\ncertification course, and look at the people that have never learned to add\nin their whole life that are taking the certification!\n\nBTW, I am disgusted at the Colt (and some of the other Chrysler offerings)\nbecause they go out of alignment if you sneaze at them. My '84 Chrysler\nLaser (Similar to the Daytona, a reskinned Colt) needed a realignment every\n3 months ... Bolt a good grade 12' 2x4 to each wheel, using a carefully welded\nspacer jig. Measure toe in, adjust to manufacturer specs. Camber a bit more\ndifficult to adjust and measure ... I used a micrometer to measure the\nspace between the rim and a funky bent up pipe that could be placed on\nupper and lower portions of the rim on the inside of wheel (hard to explain).\nThis same tool could be used instead of the 2x4s.  I had made these tools up\n*right* after the last alignment done professionally so I had a reference that\nthe original poster might not ...
I have owned my Sprint from the beginning and that sensor light comes on every\n30K to let you know it's time for a check up.  When that light goes on, I just\ntake it to the delaer tell them "It's that time" and they work on it for 4 hou\nand you pay $5 for parts and $100 for labor. (Ahh...what they get for labor)\nI currently have about 95K on my Sprint and of all the times I took it in for\nservice, I never say on the payment sheet anything about the replacement of the\nOxygen sensor.  What the heck is an Oxygen sensor?  As far an I know of, I have\nnever had that thing replaced in my car and the car is purring like a kitten.\nNow, I don't have a/c (Mother Nature does that for me :-) ) and that might have\nsomething to do with it, but I still never heard of an Oxygen sensor.  The only\nMAJOR service job I have had on my car (besides getting the tires replaced\nif you want to call that a service job) was getting the Rotor, Distributor and\nGasket replaced.  And that was all done within the past 2 months.  \n\nWhat I do at 30K is have a good tune-up, let them replace what ever they need\nto, pay the bill (about $125) and go home and don't worry about the car for\nanother 30K.  Oh, I just remembered something.  If that little sensor light\nbothers you, in the fuse box right below the turn-signal lever up against\nthe dash, there is a swith on the right side.  Flip that switch and the light\nwill go off.  I do that so that little light won't annoy me.  If you can't\nfind it, look it up in the car manuel.  I hope that I have helped a little\nand good luck with the _Oxygen sensor_?\n\n				- Thomas -

all of my HO's disagree with your HO's.  I LOVED Dallas rush hour in my stick..\ndetested it in the auto(like i did any other time in the auto...).  Of course,\nDalls rush hours are nothing, from what i hear..if i lived in LA, i might\nbe of a different persuasion.  And, just for the record, rarely do you shift\ngears when merging into traffic..that is what 5 speeds are good for..4th is\ngood up through around 80-90, most of the time, so you can just wind it out..\nit's not going to hurt anything, and keeps it in the powerband anyway..\nonly shift into top gear when you are exceeding redline in 4th(fairly rare,\nunless you drive a ferrari or some such, i'd bet) or when you hit cruising \nspeed where you feel comfortable(or when my mother is sitting in the \npassanger seat complaining about how you wind her "poor little engine" way\ntoo hi :-)\nJust my HO's..

...deleted lines...\n\n\n   As I live in Sweden I remember the day perfectly well. We changed\nside 1967-09-03 (or 03-SEP-1967). I don't remeber the exactly time but\nit was in the night. (in the 'big' cities like Stockholm & Gothenburg\nall trafic was forbidden, exept busses and taxis, during the whole\nweekend.) The day was a Sunday and everything was prepared in before.\n\nBefore the day we was told to follow the yellow lines on the road and\nafter it was the white one that matters. The signs with arrows on was\nprepared with a 'left mode' label that was torn off that night to\nreveal the new right mode arrow.\n\nThe year after Iceland also changed.\n\nAbout cars: Before the H-day (H as in "Hoegertrafik". "hoeger" is\nSwedish and stands for 'right') practically all cars already had their\nsteering wheels on the left side. Even the imported cars from UK had\nthe wheel on 'the right side'. At last we have cars with the wheels on\nthe right side. :-)\n\nMore contries that uses the left side is:\n\nJapan\nTanzania (I think)\nNew Zeeland\nHow about South Africa?\n\nBTW. Some sais that the left side is the right side because Ivanhoe\nand other knights meet at the left when they fight in tournaments. :-)\n\n...deleted lines...

Right. In the thirties both Buick and Packard had two spares mounted in\nwells in the front fenders. Of course that was back when the front\nfenders were long enough to provide room. There were a couple of other\nmarques that did this as well, but memory fades.
Grass Roots Motorsport [3/93] has a long article about MG/B's this month.\nAs far as collectivity/speculation is concerned they think it is a \nwaste of time, especially the later rubber bumpered models are the least\ndesirable, a 1962 original model the most. The reasons for its low\nvalue are easy availability and the fact that it just was not a very good\ncar.
I think VW got caught out on the airbag thing.  It's only been in the last\nyear or two that airbags have become a significant selling feature.\nVW assumed that  automatic belts would satisfy govt. requirements for\npassive restraint, but didn't guess that the 'merican consumer would\nactually make buy decisions based on the presence of an airbag.\n\nVW is really hurting right now in the US market.  Check out the\narticle in last week's Autoweek about the crisis at VW.  Golfs and\nJettas will be coming from the plant in Mexico, but they don't have\nthe quality at that facility.  As per normal VW practice, the US\nlaunch of the Jetta III is delayed again and again, until a good chunk\nof the useful life of the design is spent.\n\nI think that Passats come from Germany, so there is not the same\nquality and availability issue.  It's a nice car with a nice engine.\nWhether VW will be a player in the US market in two year's time is a\ndifferent question...
Wharf Wrat rites:\n\n\nEver' once in a while, you still see a reference to the super-\nslab system as "Interstate and Defense Highways."  But whether\nthe military has much of anything that goes 80 on the road is\nanother matter.  A few of their most whomped-up diesel trucks,\nmaybe, load permitting.  The military surplus stuff I've\ndriven -- "Jeep Classic" (Willys/Kaiser/AMC, pre-independent\nsuspension) and Power Wagons (Slant 6 in a crew-cab pickup)\nweren't exactly congenial at highway speeds, and I wouldn't\nswear any of them would do 80 except as a bedload on a semi.\n\nYou just gotta love the standard military tire, too, or at\nleast the one they used to use.  Designed circa WW II as a\ncompromise between traction in icky sticky goo and longevity\non sharp rocks and so forth, it's quite ill-adapted to high\nspeeds on civilian roadways.  For those who can't remember\nwhat they look like, imagine a mountain-bike tire with a\nroad rib in the middle, scaled up to car size. Oh, yeah, and\nnarrow too. One of the standard mods for civilizing a surplus \nJeep was to install tires and wheels that reflected some of\nthe advancements made in ride and handling since D-Day.\n\nBut the point made by Wharfie and others still stands:  if\nyou're going to do 80 in a mil-spec '58 Power Wagon (or a\nJeep or a tank transporter or other unwieldy rubber-tired\nvehicle) anywhere, I'd suggest the American interstate.  \nYour safe speed there tends to be limited more by your car\nand skills, road maintenance, and the swarms of fools around\nyou; the roads were designed for going like the devil.\n\nNaturally, neither I nor my employer advocates unsafe or\nunlawful driving.

I just always \nrecall thinking that GOOD roads of asphalt didn't come around til the\nInterstate Hiway Act, or whatever they called it(60's?), and that wood and\ncobblestone roads were fairly rare up through the depression, except in\noverpopulated places like England and US cities.  Obviously netwisdom\nsays i am wrong.\n\n\ni knew it was almost always done, but i knew of no reason that it might not\nbe done the other way by DeSoto for their car.  Seems like they had some\nother deviations from the norm too, at times :-)

You can also just put the detector off to the side on the dash so the cop\ndoesn't see it right away...Valentine is the best detector by far (as stated\nby Car and Driver) and even tells you what direction the radar is coming from.\n It also gives the amount of "threats" it is picking up, so if you go through\n the same place everyday, and it always goes off there, you can glance at the\n number of "threats" the Valentine is detecting to see if it is a genuine cop.\n  It's about $300 and you can only get it factory direct..one problem.\n                                            Rob Fusi\n                                            rwf2@lehigh.edu

Wrong. I got two points, which were the 100% sample space on the show\nfloor.

This past winter I drove from NYC to Killington,VT 6 or 7 times in my\n1990 325i Convertible (talk about poor reputation in the snow!!)\nwith an EXCELLENT set of snow tires. I put 4 Noika NR10s on in Dec. and have been \nsure footed in some pretty severe weather conditions ever since. I've plowed through\n4 - 5 inch snow covered roads effortlessly, while other cars have been paralyzed\n(front wheel drive included).\n\nConcentrate more on "where the rubber meets the road" rather than driveability of cars\nin snowy conditions. Drive carefully, buy good snow tires, and most cars will perform\nadequately in less than ideal conditions.\n\nAn aside: \nI can't praise Noika NR10 snows enough. Absolutely the BEST snow tires I have ever\ndriven on. If you live in the snow belt, do yourself a favor and get a set of these\nnext winter. \n\n\nTim
About a year ago, some kids tossed a rock off an overpass on I-94 near Eau\nClaire, Wisconsin and it killed the driver below.  (I believe he was a\nschoolteacher from Minnesota.)
You can avoid these problems entirely by installing an oil drain valve in\nplace of the bolt.  I have one on both of my cars.  There have been no\nleaks in 210,000 miles (combined miles on both cars).
no, but somebody's dropped a ford 302 V-8 into the miata, somewhat\nreminiscent of the shelby cobra.  the car's obviously not as nimble\nas before, but it's supposed to have a near 50/50 weight distribution\nand handle very well.  i'd sure love to drive one.
I've got an 89 GT.  It has the smoked taillight assembly.  I think this is where\nthe water is getting in.  When I first got it (had it for a month), one of the rear\ntaillights fogged up with moisture.  I took it in to the dealer and they replaced\nthe entire assembly.  It happened to the other one about 3 months later.  This time\nI happened to look in the spare tire well and noticed water standing in there.  The\ndealer was more reluctant this time to replace it.  But I convinced them to\nfix it.  (They must have had to deal with a number of other probes with the same\nproblem.)  I haven't noticed water in the taillamps (or the trunk) for the last 2.5\nyears, but just last month, the taillamp just fogged up again.  I'm going to try\nto take it back to get them to fix it again.  I'm real tempted to drill some vent\nand drain holes in the tops and bottoms of the assembly and forget about it.  This is\ngetting very annoying. (Almost every other `89 GT I've seen has had this problem.)\n\nVel\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-- Vel Natarajan  nataraja@rtsg.mot.com  Motorola Cellular, Arlington Hts IL  --
My knowledge about driving in the U.S. is also second-hand, but I think I can\ncorrect your statements about our Autobahn:\n\n\nOh yeah, that would be paradise... in fact, you can forget it. From all I've\nheard from my U.S. relatives, drivers esp. here in Germany are much more agg-\nressive, but not disciplined. One of my relatives, a L.A. resident, hired a car\nat the Nuernberg airport and went about 18 miles to our home. He said then that\nhe grew about 1 year older during this ride and swore he'd never drive a car in\nGermany again (this was in 1982 and he kept his promise - the situation now is\neven worse as effect of the increased volume of traffic).\nWhat you mean by `better disciplined' should perhaps be considered `cautious due\nto fear': \nWhen driving around here, you always *have* to take into consideration that the\nmajority of the other drivers absolutely relies on you: They expect that nobody\nfails or sleeps; many of them exploit this by driving as fast as their car can\ngo (of course only where that is allowed, you might think - dream on :).\nSo any mistake you make is a very high risk to your health - and if you're ex-\nposed to such a situation from your very first day as a driver, you learn to\nhandle it - or you lose... \nThat's the way I and most people I know experience our traffic situation - \nwhether you think this is pleasant or efficient is up to you; I think we handle\na very high volume of traffic and that at high speeds with modest (compared to\nthe volume) and decreasing rates of lethal accidents - OTOH, more and more\npeople (esp. women) dislike driving (because they feel overtaxed and threatened)\nand each accident is one accident too much.\n\n\nBetter designed and maintained, may be - but animal fences are very rare. Auto-\nbahnen and many other streets have guard-rails (I hope that's the right word - \na plank made from thick steel sheet fixed on uprights; it's about 2 feet high);\nthose guard-rails are designed for keeping vehicles on the road. Smaller animals\ncan crawl under the plank, bigger ones can easily jump over it. The point is\nthat esp. larger animals are very rare in Germany; they tend also to be very\ntimid. Accidents caused by animals are a neglegible danger.\n\n\nYou're right (there are speed linits even on the major part of the Autobahn) -\nbut the attitude towards driving (see above) seems to be very similar to that\nin Germany (I've been in France, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Spain, Belgium,\nthe Netherlands) - besides that, you really can't rely on the residents abiding\nthe local speed limits. I've got quite a lot of practise (~120k miles) and I'm\nused to travel at 130 mph (FYI, with a car even smaller than a rabbit), but I\nconsider driving on the highways round Paris or Milano really a thrill...\n\n\nSorry, but you'll find quite a lot rabbit-class-car (or even smaller, mine is a\nPeugeot 205) owners going that fast; small cars with much HP are very `hip' over\nhere - and most people buying such cars aren't afraid to let them run.\n\n\nI disagree; the size or weight of a car is rather irrelevant. Formula-1 cars\nweigh less than 700 kg and the drivers have a chance to survive accidents at\n130 mph or higher - OTOH when crashing against a solid object at 130 mph,\nit makes no difference whether you sit in a Porsche, a Mercedes, a tank or on\na bicycle: Your're dead.\n\nBye,\nStefan\n---\nStefan Dalibor (dalibor@immd3.uni-erlangen.de)
I agree that a fully-loaded SL2 would come close in price to a\nLOWER-END Ford Taurus.  A FULLY-LOADED Taurus, on the other hand, would still\nbe substantially more expensive than even the most glitzy SL2.  A fully loaded\nSL2 would run somewhere around $17,000, while a fully loaded Taurus LX would be\nsomewhere around the $22,000-$23,000 range.  A base Taurus (GL I believe) might\nstart around $15,000.  Of course there is the Taurus SHO which can push $30,000\nif you really try, but this is a totally different car than your mainstream\nTaurus sedan.  Your statement was not entirely faulty, just a little\ninaccurate.\n\n\nWell, that's ok.  At least you're not bitching about dealer profits like some\nof the other netters are.  You seem to have rationally picked out the car that\nis best for you.  The Loyale is an aging design that is about to be replaced by\nthe Impreza wagon, so you probably got a good deal on one of the last ones.
A little bit off of the subject but here goes\nyes he is one in the same (i.e. Chevrolet Motor Div)\nalso his brother Gaston raced at Indy and was the winner in 1920.\nI have also seen the name Arthur Chevrolet in the early teens (1911 and on)\nI assume he is related\n\nKeith Nuetzman, nuet_ke@pts.mot.com\nMotorola Inc.\nPaging and Wireless Data Group\nBoynton Beach, Fl
In rec.autos you write:\n\n\nThis McLaren auto-transmission (I still think it's only half auto,\nbut You may be right) has NOTHING to do with Your GM, Chrysler, Volvo,\nor whatever auto transmission. It's a normal manual transmission\ngearbox with clutch and all, but there are servo motors, which do\nthe shifting. \n\nThat means, there is no power loss in the drivetrain (if You take out \nminimal mechanical friction), and the sami-auto transmissions \n(Ferrari, Williams, McLaren(?),...) don't tell You, when to shift,\neither. However, these transmissions share an important disadvantage\nwith Your stock auto-trannie: They are EXPENSIVE.\n\nAs long as these servo-shifted gearboxes aren't available on \n'normal' cars I'm gonna stick with my manual. I just can't see an\nadvantage to make up for two grand I lose in this deal and the\nloss in mileage and power (except maybe in real heavy traffic). But\nthen I drive mostly on the autobahn and country roads anyway.\n\nThere's no point in making a religion out of this, I just wanted to\npoint out a few technical facts and MY OWN opinion, so there's\nno need for a flame war.\n\n\nHave a safe ride
I don't understand the fascination with vent windows. They create a tremendous \nturbulence and noise that makes even a simple connversation impossible at \nspeeds above 40mph. The current flow-throuh ventilation, if designed right, \nare far more superior.
Ah, yes, the big chunks down in the sump. The solution is simple. Sort of\nlike the advice my Aunt always gave -- never scratch your ear with anything\nexcept your elbow.
I was following an example of the LH the other day, and noticed the fit\nbetween the tunk lid and the rear bumper.   The gap was quite small on\nthe left side, but much larger on the right.  Blech!!!
Hmmm....I was listening to the local radio expert (who is, amazingly\nenough, an Honest-to-God Expert(tm); it's amazing what he knows...), \nand he said that, based on his conversations with the inventor of \nSlick50 (who is no longer with the comapny, due to some kind of \nconflict), he avoids it like the plague.  He does recommend other \nteflon-based/type oil additives, though.\n\n				James
Actually I wasn't too surprised, since I bought it with the rust.  Any of you \ngot some ideas of getting rid of this CHEAPLY (key word)??  It has eaten all \nthe\nway through on the door panels.  Can I use Bondo?  \n \nAlso, is there a good paint that will bond to Aluminum rims?  The paint thati\nwas on my rims has peeled off, actually, there's some rust looking 'stuff' on\nthe rims themselves...  but it comes off pretty easily.  \n \nOne more thing...\nHave any of you done self-painting to a car?  How do you start?  What do I need\nto do this?
$ [...]\n$ 	Actually, you want a Checker Special if you can find one.\n\n$ 	Good luck.  I'm sorry I let mine go...\n\nI grew up in New York City so I rode in many Checker cabs.  The jump\nseats were fun as a kid.  Although the cars were roomy -- a good trait\nfor a taxi -- they had a design flaw that I don't understand they never\nfixed: the rear passengers tended to fall out of their seats when the\ndriver braked.  I wouldn't want to take a long ride in the back seat of\none of these vehicles.  Why did you like yours?  I never drove one, so\nI have to ask.
==================\nLet me see, "unless you have an accident, you won't need more", hmmmmmmm.
My Honda Accord just hit the magic 100,000 mile mark and now\nall sorts of things are beginning to go bad. The latest problem\nI am experiencing is with my brakes.  They still stop the\ncar fine, but once I am stopped completely, my brake pedal\nwill sink another 2 or 3 inches all by itself.  If feels really\nstrange, and I am worried my brakes will quit working one of\nthese days.\n\nI checked my brake fluid, and the reservoir was full, but the\nfluid itself looked really dirty (like dirty oil).  I called\nmy mechanic and he told me I need a new brake master cylinder,\nwhich will cost me a whopping $250-300.\n\nI was just wondering if anyone out there has experienced this\nsort of thing.  If so, is my mechanic being honest? Or do I\nsimply need to have my brakes bled and new fluid put in?\n\nAny help you could provide would be appreciated.  Please send\nreplies directly to me, as I rarely have a chance to read this\nlist.  I will post the responses if there is any interest.\n\nThanks,

I have a '71 Buick Skylark with 148K on it.  I bought it in California, and if\nit'll let me, I'd like to keep it for another year.  The only problem is these\nIndiana winters--my heater controls don't work.\n\nThe car has vacuum operated control switches for the vents.  Right now it is\nstuck in the "vent" mode.  It will blow warm air, but I can't switch the air\nflow to either the floor (I can live without this) or the defrost (I can't \nlive without this).  I probably could just jam the air deflector to the \ndefrost position, but this blows a lot of air in my face and is, well,\nkind of like putting a vacuum cleaner in reverse.\n\nI have taken parts of the dash off and looked at the vacuum system and I think\nthe problem (or part of it) is with the two diaphragms which control up/down\nand outside/inside air flow.  THe diaphragm which controls outside(vent)/in-\nside(no vent) air is cracked most of the way around, and the other one is\nprobably damaged too, considering the advanced age of the car.\n\nTwo questions:\n\n	1)  Is there anything I should be aware of about this (other than\n	the fact that I should move from Indiana) ?\n\n	2)  In the event that replacement diaphragms aren't available, is there\n	a way to "fix" this?\n\nTHanks for any advice/info\n\nselah,
You can go to the DMV and ask for their listing.  Although I\ndon't know where you may actually buy a copy, you can use theirs\nfor your perusal.  In California, the listing of personalized\nlicense plates run 3 volumes, each about 1.5" thick.  I hope this\nis what you're asking for.\n\n\nKen
Don't worry about leaks.  Don't worry about which way to turn the damn thing.\nTake a good claw hammer and pry it straight out.  Now, you'll notice, after\nall the oil pours out, that there are no theads where there used to be.
Now, my ego with regards to my shifting ability is as big as anyone else's, but\nI just ordered my first car with an auto trans. I wasn't planning on it; but\nafter driving a few I was convinced: Things have changed since the days of \n"Slip 'n' Slide Withe Powerglide". They shift *better* than I do, there's no\nclutch to wear out (Honda wanted $800 for my 4WD wagon last year!- got it done\nfor $500), it only costs about 5% in gas milage on the highway and it makes it\neasier to concentrate on all the radios in my car ;-)\n\n(Oddly enough, while two of my best friends- both in the auto industry here in the \nMotor City- have switched wholeheartedly to autos, their wives *insist* on \nmanual. Shift envy?)\n\nBraggadocio aside, given today's technology and the warranties they're handing \nout the auto trans seemed like an excellent choice. Call me a convert.
I can't tell if Matt is being sarcastic here or not, but to be honest, many\nautomobiles are worth far more to their owners (in $$ value and $$ investment)\nthan the people that would take them.  I don't have figures on average property\ntax in the U.S. or how much of it is allocated for housing projects, inferior\npublic schools, jails, or the like, but I have a feeling that the amount the\ngovernment steals from an honest, productive citizen to breed this trash is \nsignificantly less than the value of many automobiles.  And for those who will\nargue that the animals out there stealing cars and everything else (not to\nmention committing COMPLETELY senseless acts of violence, such as rape) cannot\nbe valued in terms of money because they are human beings, I submit that they\nare not human beings.  Jim Callison, I think, is on the right track.  And \nChintan Amin remarked earlier that we cannot blame environment for the actions\nof a single criminal.  I couldn't agree more.  One could trace any crime back\nto the environment/upbringing of the criminal; should we let all of them out,\nfrom pickpockets to rapists to inside traders, because what they did wasn't\ntheir fault?  Where does one draw the line?\n\n$0.02

$ The biggest hurdle for automatics (IMHO) is not shifting speed\n$ per se, but rather the transmission's reaction speed when you\n$ try to force it to shift manually.  \n$ [...]\n\nI rented an Oldsmobile Achieva (is that a yuppie name or what?) and a\nNissan Stanza.  They both had automatics.  I'm a manual transmission\nbigot but I have to admit that the transmissions on these cars were\nbetter shifters than I am.  And yes, they responded very quickly to\nkickdown requests.  The Nissan had a tachometer so I was able to figure\nout which gear I was in.  (The Olds may have also, but I don't\nremember.)  I believe it shifted all the way down to second at about 50\nmph when my foot told it, "No I really want to accelerate quickly."\n\nI would still prefer a manual, but I won't delude myself into thinking\nthat I can out-accelerate a modern automatic.  And I'm very smooth at\nshifting but certainly not as good as an automatic.
The girl's OK, actually, and she recovered well enough to go home.  I\ndon't know if she has any permanent damage, though.  Just in case anybody was\nconcerned...\n\n\n	If people start forcing others to take responsibility for their actions\nthings like this wouldn't happen.  Untill we stop blaming outside causes, and\nstart blaming the criminals, we will continue to let things like this happen.
Not exactly dumb, but who remebers the tachometer on the 69 or 70 Firebird \nbulging out of the _hood_ right in front of the driver. Neat place but I love \nto know what the elemnts did to its internals after a few years. Also, does \nthe speedomete pointer on many US cars have to be 3 feet long?.
The rubber drain plugs under my carpet in my mazda glc leaked\nlike the ones are doing under your spare in the Probe.\nI tooke them out and put some silicone sealant on them\nand put them back in.
Car and Driver rated the 325is (1988) at 7.2 0-60 , 1/4 at 15.2 (after 30k miles) last time I checked 8#}.\n\nAutomobile magazine rated new 325is 1/4 mile@16.2.\n\nGee , aint quotiin funner than the dickens!\n\nSounds like we need a race.  I'll let you have the newer version.  Can someone out there lend me a 1988 325is for a day 8-].  I wont hurt it, I promise.
sorry about that last post, my server neglected to send the message:
You raise a valid point, but again it's a tradeoff -- how much money\ndo you want to spend for that kind of protection?  You could buy a\nVolvo, Saab, or 'Benz and get really good crash protection (and other\nluxuries) but you'll pay significantly more for it.  In my case it's\nout of the question because *all* of those cars are beyond my budget.\n\nEven in high-speed head-on collisions the most beneficial item you can\nhave is a good old 3-point seatbelt.  Nowadays, at least in the US,\nyou get an airbag if you get a 3-point belt so (presumably) you get an\nadded safety benefit there as well.  That's something I certainly look\nfor and which can be had in inexpensive cars.\n\nMy $.02, of course.
is this really the dealer's cost?  did you get the dealer's cost by\nlooking at the invoice?  there may be factory to dealer incentives.\ni'd check this out, since i have trouble believing that a dealer would\nsell a car to me at his cost.\n\ndealer invoice is not necessarily the dealer cost.

Perhaps instead of this silly argument about what backup lights\nare for, couldn't we agree that they serve the dual purpose of\nletting people behind your car know that you have it in reverse\nand that they can also light up the area behind your car while\nyou're backing up so you can see?\n\nBackup lamps on current models are much brighter than they used\nto be on older cars. Those on my Taurus Wagon are quite bright\nenough to illuminate a good area behind the car, and they're \nMUCH brighter than those on my earlier cars from the 60s and 70s. \n\nInsofar as Vettes having side backup lights, look at a '92 or '93\nmodel (or perhaps a year or two earlier too) and you'll see\nred side marker lamps and white side marker lamps both near the\ncar's hindquarters.

That is absolutely correct.  They have a streak of meanness that runs much\ndeeper and stronger than anything I ever experienced even during the height\nof the 60's racial struggles.  I am absolutely convinced that there are\nkids out there today that have no concept of right and wrong, but have the\nhuman intelligence which is turning them into the greatest predators that\nhave ever walked the earth.  They will prevail unless the rest of humanity\ndecides that it is in their best interest to stand up against these feral\nhumans, and for individuals to start taking some responsibility for their\nown protection.  In a state in which the individuals turn to the authorities\nand police for protection, the police and government is soon composed of\nthe very feral humans that they originally sought protection from.\n\nGee, I guess you touched my hot button.  I'd better go cool off somewhere.

Alright, beat this automobile sighting.\n\nDriving along just a hair north of Atlanta, I noticed an old, run down\nformer car dealership which appeared to deal with, and repair, older\nrare or exotic foreign sports cars. I saw:\n\nFord GT-40 (!), the famous model from Ford, that seemed to win most of \nits races in the late 60s, including Le-Mans 4 or 6 times.\n\nTwo Jensen Interceptors, one a convertable, one a hatchback?\n\nPorsche 911 (boring compared to the rest)\n\nTHREE Ferarries, a Mondial, a 308 prepared for racing, and a red 60s model\nthat I couldn't identify.\n\nAnd at the bottom, a late 70s MG convertable.\n\nOutside there was a rotting Rover 3500 saloon, which was never regularly\nsold in the U.S.\n\nAnd in the showroom, there was a small italian body, either an Alpha Romeo\nor a Lancia. It was about the size of an Austin Mini.\nThe trunklid was missing, exposing a boot with a voltage regulator \nin the upper left corner of the wall, and a chunk of metal removed from\nthe floor on the right hand side as if something would leave the trunk\nand go to the outside from here.\nThe taillights looked like they\nwould be the round type (if they were there). Does anyone know what the\nmake of this one is?  \n\nCertainly made my day...
But, those chips are probably inside a custom chip, (to make it smaller and\nuse less power) and the preset/data pins are not going to be available.\nIt would probably not be TTL but might be CMOS \n(wider operating voltage range), not that the tecnology would make \nmuch difference.\nPlus the custom chip would probably be potted (encapsulated with epoxy).\nGood luck.\n\n-- \n--garyl-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n		"Any shark that gets to be 11 or 12 feet long with \n	      300 big teeth can be considered dangerous" - 'Shark Bowl '92'
I'm no mustang head, but don't the early ones have a simple\nstrut suspension (that is, with no upper A-arm)?  Just a strut\ngoing down to a lower control arm (single bushing: not an A-arm), with a\ntension/compression rod locating it in the forward/backward direction?\n\n	Anyway, simple strut suspensions like this can be lowered just by using\nshorter springs, cutting the springs, lowering the spring perch or shortening\nthe strut below the perch.  In each of these cases, the suspension geometry\nwill suffer because the lower control arms will not be at the\nintended angle.  A spacer placed between control arm and the bottom\nof the strut (roughly the height of the reduction) will restore\nthe suspension geometry.  IMHO, the kit that includes the spacer\nis the only way to go...\n\n--Ken
If the tire has a leak you should fix it. \n\n\nDoesn't work too well if the engine is hot, its more accurate to check the\noil when the engine is cool, i.e. not when you are at a gas station.
Perhaps it is because witnesses who have left the compound have all\ntestified that the BATF shot first, they they did not identify themselves\nbefore tossing in concussion grenades (not that anyone inside could have\n_heard_ such identification after being near a concussion grenade) and\nthe announcement from the BATF that they have sealed the warrant under\nwhich they were operating - which was a _search_ warrant, by the way,\n_not_ an arrest warrant.  In short, perhaps because the BATF is wildly\nout of control and perhaps calmer heads have realized that bombing a\ncompound full of woman and children will not improve their position.\nThere is a real chance that Koresh will be able to prove self-defense\nin court.

Something that happened in South AFrica about a year ago: A dealer sold a \nMercedes with an odometer reading of 150K kilometers to a lady. Turned out \nthat the actual reading should have been 160K. Court case followed because\nlady said she wouldn't have bought a car with that much km's. Dealer found \nquilty, fined and had to take back the car.\n\nI think you have a case if you can get a sworn statement from the previous\nowner. Take the car back to the dealer and threaten him or something.
I'm plannig to trade my Sentra SE-R in with a NX2000.  My car has 11,500\nmiles on it and is a '92 model.  The NX2000 the dealer is selling is a '91\nmodel with 23,000miles on it.  It has a T-Bar Roof, a/c, and an airbag,\nwhich my Sentra does not have.  They are asking for $1500.  Is that a fair\ndeal?  The only thing I noticed about the NX2000 is that the engine did not\nseem to have as much torque as my Sentra which has the same identical\nengine.  I presume that the last lady owner did not really push the engine\nto it's limits occassionaly while I did that on mine, thuis the NX2000's\nengine is a little "tight."  So, if I buy the NX2000 and "excercise" it\nwell, should that slight power problem go away?  Any advice on this will be\nmuch appreciated.  Thanks.  Please reply via e-mail if possible.\n-- \nA motion picture major at the Brooks Institute of Photography, CA\nSanta Barbara and a foreign student from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
I would suggest you take the car to the nearest Chevron dealer, with\nyour own oil and filter.  Ask for an oil change.  It will cost less\nthan $10.  Watch him/her do it.  Just from watching someone do a job,\nyou will be able to learn and remember the sequence, and do it right\nwhen you do it yourself the next time.  Besides, when he/she loosens\nthe drain nut, the next time around it will be easier for you.\n\n  If it is stuck, use an impact wrench.  Not too much force though.\nUse a new washer each time you put the nut back.....
Anyone have any opinions on fairly recent model Alfa Spiders ( 86-> ) \n\nReliablilty for what their class ( I'm not talking Alfa vs. Toyota corrola\nwhich is more relaible ) \n\nAs far as I can discern, in recent years, there are 3 levels with all\nbasically the same mechanical aspects.\n\nPlease email any responses
Sorry, but *neither* 'dictates' the cost. It's a negotiation.\nWhether it's up front at a honda dealership in an all out \ndickering war, or more removed on a larger economic scale\n(ie, if saturn can't sell at it's price, the price drops,\nor the company stops building them), it remains a negotiated\nvalue controlled by market forces. To think that the consumer \ncontrols price is ludicrous. If the consumer controled\nprice, then cars would be *free*...And no one would build \ncars.\n\nRegards, Charles
Well the European Manta and US GT have entirely different bodies. There is\nlittle or no chance that they are the same. The Manta went through several\ngenerations as the coupe version of the Ascona and was OK in its time.\n\n\nNot true. The Kadett has been in and out of the US market over the years.\nThe LeMans (old Kadett) is only the latest version. \n\nCraig\n\nDifferent Cars. One looks like a sports-car, the other is a coupe.
There is something going on here.  It seems that once a month, the VW\ngroup must have get a specific detailed question about Hondas.  I\nwould like to ask that next month we get one about Hyundai instead of\nHonda.  Thank you.
I bought an Intrepid about two months ago and am very happy with\nit.  Lots of room inside and even with the smaller engine it has\nenough power for me.  The only problem I found was a small\nselection on the dealer's lots. They are hot sellers around here.
I have a 1986 Acura Integra 5 speed with 95,000 miles on it. It is positively\nthe worst car I have ever owned. I had an 83 Prelude that had 160k miles on\nit when I sold it, and it was still going strong .  This is with religious\nattention to maintenance such as oil changes etc. Both cars were driven in\nexactly the same manner..\n\n  1. It has gone through two clutches (which are underrated.)\n  2. 3 sets of tires (really eats tires in the front even with careful align)\n  3. All struts started leaking about 25-30k miles\n  4. Windshield wiper motor burned up (service note on this one)\n  5. Seek stop working on radio about 20k miles\n  6. Two timing belts.\n  7. Constant error signals from computer.\n\n  8. And finally. A rod bearing went out on the No. 1 piston seriously damaging\n     the crankshaft, contaminating the engine etc. When the overhaul was done\n     last week it required new crankshaft, one new cam shaft (has two) because\n     the camshaft shattered when they tried to mill it. The camshaft took 4\n     weeks to get because it is on national back order. \n\n     Everything on the engine is unique to the 1986 year. They went to a new\n     design in 87. Parts are very expensive.
Good luck.
Just found a great deal on a Clifford Delta car alarm, $450 installed.  \nComes with glass break sensor, motion detector, and shock detector.  Does \nanyone have one of these alarms?  Are they any good?  From the looks of it, its\nabout the best on the market for the price.  It's also on sale, so that's \nanother reason to get it.  I think I'll be saving almost $200.  Any opinions?
No. reverse lights are to warn others that you are backing up. They\naren't bright enough to (typically) see by without the brake and tail\nlights. \n\n\nWell, red and orange were already taken. Maybe white defines the direction\nthat the car is moving in.\n\n\nIf you really want to be able to see behind you, get some fog lamps for\nthe back of the car. These work very well - and are a good way to get\nrid of tailgaters if you get that rush of testosterone.
Don't have a list of what's been said before, so hopefully not repeating.\n\nHow about horizontally mounted oil filters (like on my Ford) that, no\nmatter how hard you try, will spill out their half quart on the bottom\nof the car when you change them?

(I deleted your name because I don't want to sound accusative in my remark)\nI'm not going to argue the issue of carrying weapons, but I would ask you if \nyou would have thought seriously about shooting a kid for setting off your\nalarm?

Glad you got out of there\nbefore they did anything to give you a reason to fire your gun.\n\nWe can all ask "what's happening to society these days", but don't forget to\nask another important question too: What effort am I expending to make it any\ndifferent than it is?

Pretty much like the people who buy the Mazda MX-5 (Miata) today.  Small \nfun and you can fool yourself (and a lot of other people) that you have the \nperformance of many far superior (and much more expensive) performnace cars.
Hi,\n\nMy friend's 1983 Toyota Tercel accelerates by itself without using\nthe gas peddel. The repairman said it has a internal leak of air in\nthe carburetor and needs a new carburetor (costs $650). She likes\nto know if it is possible to fix the problem without replacing\nthe whole carburetor.
My whole point was not to say that the cars *couldn't* go that fast,\nbut that they *shouldn't* go that fast.  A family sedan designed to be\noperable at 85mph doesn't suddenly become operable at 130mph because\nyou added some plastic aero effects, slightly wider tires, and a much\nlarger engine.  That's what the SHO is -- a slightly modified family\nsedan with a powerful engine.  They didn't even bother improving the\n*brakes.*\n\nThe Mustang is essentially the same deal as the SHO -- a big power\nplant stuck in a mid-size sedan, with almost no other modifications.\nI have real-life experience with the Mustang -- it handles like a\nbrick (except when you're invoking oversteer, of course, something I\npersonally avoid doing on the highway) and stopping power is\ninadequate even from 80mph.  Lots of accelleration -- but the rest of\nthe car is not up to par.\n\nI picked the Porsche example because they are designed with speed in\nmind.  It didn't have to be the 911 -- it could have been the much\ncheaper 944 or one of several Mercedes or Audi models.  All of these\ncars are fairly expensive -- but so are the parts that make them\ndrivable at high speed.  This should be elementary.\n\nThere are a few things to keep in mind about Europe, since you brought\nit up.  My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly second-hand, but I believe\nthe following to be true:\n\n1. Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here.\n2. The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than\n   they are here, and usually include animal fences.  This makes them\n   far more predictable than most US highways.\n3. Not all of Europe is the Autobahn.  Most places in Europe have\n   speed limits that aren't out-of-line with what we used to have in\n   the US -- if my friends weren't lying to me they're typically not\n   much higher than 120km/h.\n\nI strongly suspect you won't find a lot of Rabbit owners doing 120mph\n(nearly 200km/h) on the Autobahn, but I could be wrong.  Some people\nhave no respect for their own lives.\n\n\n\nIf you think so you sure don't pay attention to my postings.

The greenhouse effect (produced by\n infrared-trapping gasses like CO2 and methane) and the ozone-hole problem\n (produced by long-lived, chlorine-containing molecules) are not the same\n thing.  It is a lot easier to do something about not using the CFC's\n (chloro-fluorocarbons) than it is to stop producing CO2 and methane which\n are natural byproducts of combustion and of living (animal) organisms.\n Planting more trees and not destroying so many existing trees would help\n the greenhouse-gas problem, but would do nothing for the ozone problem.\n\n Fred W.

just to satiate my curiosity, why would this make you the stupid one?  It seems\nto me, everybody SHOULD be aware enough of what is going on.  You do not need\nto calculate the future position.  You need to look at your mirrors a little\nmore.  If you glance around, you will be able to tell how much faster than you\nthe car is going.  Maybe not precisely, but well enough to know if you should\nlet him around before you try to pass.  I know what you are talking about,\nabout the other driver being startled, because i myself have been startled\nby drivers cruising by at around 90-100mph when i'm doin 55-65.  The problem,\nthough, as i saw it, was not their fault for barreling around me, but my fault\nfor not paying the attention to my task-at-hand that i should have been.\nOddly enough, since the 2nd time(happened 2x in around 4 mo. when i'd had my\nliscence for around 6 mo), i haven't been startled..and i've been passed by\ncars doing roughly twice the speed of my car.  Another odd occurance is the\nfact that this only seems to happen on LONG trips...and if i drive along with\nthem, it doesn't happen at all :-) even on the long trips! :-)  (adrenaline\nwill do that to you...i've had bad cop experiences with speeding, so anything\nover the limit is adrenalizing for me...scared i'll get caught :-)  Maybe\nthey should raise the limit, so we can pay better attention.....\n\njust curious, and my .otwo

l\n\n\ndiamond star cars (Talon/Eclipse/Laser) put out 190 hp in the turbo models,\nand 195 hp in the AWD turbo models,  These cars also have handling to match\nthe muscle, and are civil in regular driving conditions, rather than having a\nharsh, stiff ride....The AWD Turbo is clearly the better choice of the two\n(because of all that torque steer on the front drive model), but you may have\nto go with a leftover or "slightly" used model for that price range....tough\ndecision...\n\n        Rob Fusi\n        rwf2@lehigh.edu

My T-Bird SC's manual says to replace the platinum plugs every 60,000mi.\nWal-Mart has Autolite platinum plugs for $2.00 each. Are these "real"\nplatinum plugs?

I dont know about the car comparison but as far as the price goes rest\nassured that the street prices for the MX-3 and Escort and (maybe) even\nthe Honda will be lesser than that of the Saturn you're talking about.\nAll price comparisons I've seen are based on MSRP and of course the\nsaturn dealer will sell the car for sticker price whereas the others\nwill do it way below sticker.
: While not exactly a service incident, I had a similar experience recently  \n: when I bought a new truck.\n: I had picked out the vehicle I wanted and after a little haggling we  \n: agreed on a price. I wrote them a check for the down payment plus tax\n: and license and told them I'd be back that evening to pick up the truck.  \n: When I returned, I had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could  \n: get to me. When I finally got in there, everything went smoothly until he  \n: started adding up the numbers. He then discovered that they had  \n: miscalculated the tax & license by about $150. He then said he needed  \n: another $150 from me. I said we had already agreed on a price and it was  \n: their problem, I wasn't giving them any more money. The finance guy then  \n\nA similar thing happend to me a year ago.  I bought a used Ford Bronco\n(which has since been stolen...  :(  )  and few weeks after I paid\nand took delivery, they sent a letter telling me they goofed and \nmiscalculated the license renewal by $300 and that I need to send\nin a check to "avoid further delay" in the processing of my registration.\nThe thing is, I had already received the pink slip from the DMV, so\nI ignored it.  I received another letter and then the phone calls\nstarted coming.  First from the finance guy and then from the general\nmanager, both hounding me for the extra money.  They left me alone\nonce I told them I already had the paperwork and pointed out the clause\nin the contract that stated that the final price was just that: FINAL.\nAfterall, they wouldn't budge if I had told them I wanted another\n$300 off after the deal had been signed, right?  I told them not \nto call again and that I would not do business with them in the future.\nThey didn't seem to have a problem with that.  This, after all, was a\nused Ford at a Toyota dealership.\n\nI had a much better experience buying a new Pathfinder about a month\nago.  It certainly pays to buy a car on the last Sunday of the month.\nIt was even raining too, so they had done very little business that \nweekend and were really willing to deal.  I kept telling them I would\nthink about it, and they kept dropping the price.  Got a very good\ndeal and so far have been very please with the service.
^^^^\n						Rears also vented\n\n\nThen you shouldn't've done it. Try answering the damn question.\nI am well aware of the fact that there was no mention of the SC\nin there.\n\n\nWell, my point was that the SC and the SHO both have very similar\ncharacteristics (front and rear disks (ABS on the SHO?), high output\nV6, 4-wheel independent suspension, very good aerodynamics, 3-point\nharness, fat rubber, and 130mph+ top speed). If one of them is \nup to standard (and I think the SC is), but the other isn't, then\nwhy is that? No flamage, just curiousity.\n\n\n				James
Having spoken to technical staff from Ford many times, I can assure you that \ninternally at Ford this car is always called the Taurus "Show" or just  \n"the Show".  As in long "o" sound.  I still refer to it as the "S-H-O",\nhowever, because it sounds better to me. I assume many purist fans and owners \nprefer using the Ford lingo.
Les Bartel's comments:\n\nLet me add my .02 in. I had a A/C installed by the Ford garage and it did not\nwork as well as the A/C that was installed by the factory in pickups \nidentical to mine. I have talked to other people that have had the same\nresult. Don't know if this is just a problem with Ford or what??

My friend brought a subaru SVX recently.  I had drove it for couples times and I\nthink its a great car, esp on snow.  However when she took it to a local Subaru\ndealer for a oil change, the bill came out to be about 80 dollars.  The dealer\ntold us it is because to change the oil filter on a SVX it is necessary to\ndisassemble a metal cover under the engine and that took an hour of labour.\nAt first, we think we are being ripped off so she phone to a dealer in Toronto\nbut found out the they are charging roughly the same price.  So is there any\nSVX owner out there that has the same problem ?  And if the oil change story is\ntrue, then the engineer of Subaru looks pretty stubid to me. By the way, the car\nlooks great.
I heard the diesels are considered cleaner-burning than\ngas engines because the emit less of: Carbon Monoxide,\nHydrocarbons, and Oxides of Nitrogen.  (CO, HC, NOX).\n\nBut they can put out a lot of particulate matter.  I heard\nsomething about legislation being discussed to "clean up\ndiesel emissions".  Is there anything in the works to\ninstall "scrubbers" for diesels?  How about the feasibility\nof installing them on trucks and cars?  Would it be any\ndifferent than a catylitic converter?  I'd assume easier,\nsince we're removing particulate matter instead of converting\ngasses.

We had those f*****g photo-radar things here in Sweden a while ago.\nThere was a lot of fuzz about them, and a lot of sabotage too (a spray-can\nwith touch-up paint can do a lot of good...).\n\nEventually they had to drop the idea as there were a lot of court-cases\nwhere the owner of the car could prove he didn't drive it at the time\nof speeding.\n\nI especially recall a case where it eventually proved to be a car-thief that\nhad stolen a car and made false plates. He, ofcourse, chose a license number\nof a identical car, so the photo seemed correct...\n\nIn conclosion: Photo-radar sucks, every way you look at it!
It did it again.  This morning, my 88 Ford Ranger was idling at 10,000 RPM.\nOk, so I exaggerated a little, but it was idling very fast.  It has a 2\nliter carburated engine in it, and no blipping of the throttle would\ncause the idle to drop back to normal (I don't think the linkage is stuck).\nWhat can I do to fix this problem?  This has been a problem from time to\ntime, but has straightened itself out - until now.  I don't have a tach,\nbut by gauging by the sound of the engine, it is idling about twice as fast\nas it should be.  This is down from what it was idling at when I pulled up\nat a stop light.\n\nMany thanks for any suggestions.\n\n - les

The part about spending $5000-7000 on repairs reminds me\nof an article I read in a magazine comparing the 5 year ownership costs\nof a Toyota Camry and a Ford Taurus or something like that.  The result,\nwhich they announced with great flourish was that it cost the same at the\nend of the period.  That was their argument to prove that you don't go\nwrong buying the Ford Taurus over the Camry.\n\n	Now, if I remember correctly, the Camry costs about $4000 or so more\nin initial costs.  Essentially, it means that you spend about $4000 extra\non repairs on the Taurus.  That is ridiculous.  Every time your car\nneeds repairs, it is extra hassles, loss of time and a dozen other things.\nI would much rather spend $5000 more in initial costs than spend $4000 more\nin repair costs.

Sounds more like an Opel GT.  Neat cars, fun to drive.  Sold through\nBuick from 196? through 1973 (if I remember correctly).  I believe it\nwas in '72 that there were some engine mods made such that parts\nwere not interchangeable with the older models.  Parts are thus much\nharder to come by for the later models.  Parts in general are not\ntoo difficult to find.  At one time JC Whitney carried some stuff\nincluding a brand new (not remfg) long block.  Either a GT or a\nKharman Ghia (hmm that spelling looks hosed) will be my next project.
Graham E. Thomas, grahamt@phantom.gatech.edu\nsighting.\n\nI can top that one.  Friday afternoon 4-16-93 I\nlook out my window in Long Beach CA.  What do I\nsee but the new Ferrari.

Because Greyhound has apparently gotten around to installing their\nRADAR collision-prevention system. They use RADAR to monitor how close\nother vehicles are and how fast their relative speeds are, and signals\na warning to the driver if they're coming up on something too fast\nor are getting too close.\n\nThis is all I remember from the news reports a few months back; at\nthe time, they were only talking about the possibility of installing\nthe system. (They didn't mention how it worked in bumper-to-bumper\ntraffic, or how it discriminated between a Camaro approaching at\n120mph and ye olde bridge support in the median being approached \nat 60mph on a curve.)\n\nI do recall something about progressive stages of warnings, from\nflashing lights to audible warnings--ie, it goes from a red "Too\nclose" light to hysterically screaming "WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE!!!!"  :-)\n\n				James
Is clear coat really worth it?  Yes, on the showroom floor, the cars\nhave this deep, lustrous shine that just can't be found on paint jobs\nthat aren't clear coated.  On the other hand, it seems that every clear\ncoated car that I've seen on the road (in a parking lot, etc.) has\nfine scratches throughout the paint job.  As does, alas, my 1992 Laser.\n\nSeveral weeks ago I had my car professionally polished and waxed.\nWhen I picked it up, it had that same showroom shine that I remember\nfrom a year ago when I bought it.  Several days ago I took my car\nto the dealership for some work.  As an added bonus, they washed my\ncar.  Unfortunately, whoever washed it either didn't get the roof\n(which is black, the rest of the car is red) completely clean before\nhe dried it, or he used a dirty towel.  Now my showroom shine is a\nhaze of fine scratches that aren't really visible until the light\nhits the roof at a particular angle.\n\nI am, to put it mildy, somewhat peeved about this.  Do I have any \nchance of getting the dealership to do something about this?\nMy guess is 'no'.  Is there any product on the market that provides\na solution to this problem?  Or am I faced with the prospect of\nhaving the car professionally polished again to hide the scratches?\nInformation, commiseration, and sympathy all greatly appreciated . . .
Actually, this started as a great idea.  Before steering-column\nlocks became popular, Saab installed a *gearshift* lock -- put the car\nin reverse, remove the key, and the car *stays* in reverse!\n	Also, suppose you get into your car, and a thug comes up and\ndemands your keys at gunpoint.  You hand them over, he gets in, and\nHAS NO IDEA WHERE TO PUT THE KEY!  At this, he will run away (or perhaps\nshoot you anyway  %-}).  I heard this actually happened somewhere...\n	Btw, I hear that the Saab 900's new successor will have the\nignition on the console, between the seats, where it belongs.
Several years ago GM was having trouble with the rings sticking on the\n5.7 diesel.  They traced a cause to the use of 10W-40 oil.  They would\nnot honor warranty work if 10W-40 was used (if my memory serves me).\n5-30, 10-30 or 20 50 was OK'd though.

james, i really hate to do this, but try reading the damn posts!\nnever was a t'bird mentioned.  The discussion was about SHO's and\n'stangs not being up to spec.  I do not know about t'birds.  I\nonly know that the specs quoted for the SHO by previous poster sounded\na little anemic for me to say that it was up to snuff.  This does not\nin any way  disencourage* me from wishing to own one, nor does it make it\na bad car.  It merely means that i think Ford could have added that extra\nbit of safety  and tossed in larger brakes, as the wheels are plenty large\nenough for them to fit (if memory serves right, which it may very well not)\nand the motor plenty powerful enough to need it.
While previous Volvos have been essentially very fast tractors, the 3,4 and 8 series\nare far from 'agricultural' in design or execution (how many FWD tractors have you \nseen?).\n\n\nYou state this like it is a bad thing.  :^)  (remember, car companies use\nad agencies - they don't do their own ads!)\n\n\nIs this true?  I know that they had done joint ventures with Renault, but I haven't\nheard about their subsumption into Renault - does this mean that the French Government\nnow owns Volvo?  - anyway, Renault makes some very nice cars, they just don't sell\n'em in N. America!\n\n\nHere! Here!
One of the local dealers has a used (7k miles) '93 Probe GT\non the lot with a photocopy of a document taped to the\nwindow saying the dealership bought the car back from\nthe previous owner because of "Engine noises", but that\nthe Ford district rep had OK'ed the car saying those\nnoises were "normal".  I thought it was worth looking\ninto (the car seems otherwise clean) and mentioned this\nto a co-worker, who proceeded to tell me a horror story\nabout her son's '93 Probe GT, which had several problems,\nending with engine noises which she said "was something\nwith the heads", that Ford acknowledged the noise, said\nthey were working on it, but didn't have a cure as of\nyet.  Her son traded the car in (and I checked -- not\nthe same car).  So I have some evidence of a reoccuring\nproblem with the V6 in the Probe GT's, and by extension\nwith the Madza 626 and MX-6.

This kind of behavior is what I was shocked by in my 'experience'. For  \ncrying out loud, how do these turkeys think they can talk to customers  \nthis way and still stay in business? Again, I don't expect sales people to  \nbow, scrape, and grovel in my presence but I sure don't expect to be  \nabused either. I was very surprised by the way the sales people talked to  \nme and in other 'negotiating' sessions I overheard in neighboring sales  \ncubicles. Evidently, their success rate is high enough that they continue  \nto do business this way. There must be a lot of people out there who are  \neasy to intimidate.\n\nOn the other hand, I'm not sure about the 'one price, no haggling'  \napproach that Saturn and other are starting to use. I guess if their fixed  \nprice is fair it's OK. Maybe the best approach is to do your homework  \nbefore you go in. Find out the invoice prices of the car, add a reasonable  \nprofit for the dealer ($200-$300??), offer them that price and stick to  \nit. If they get abusive, just leave. Then, don't let them try to screw you  \nafter the deal is agreed on.

There's only one car that really fits your needs. It's spelled:
In defense of the drivers, who are in the right lane.  Here in the states, people simply do not expect when they are driving to be overtaken at a speed differential of 50+mph.  I don't think this is because they are stupid (of course, there are exceptions), they are just programmed because of the 55mph limit. Do you (in the states) when you look in the rear-view ALWAYS calculate future  positions of cars based on a 50+ speed differential.  \n\nDont get me wrong, I love to drive in the left lane fast but when I overtake\ncars who are on the right, I slow down a tad bit. If I were to rely on the judgement of the other car, to recognize the speed differential, I would be the stupid one.
Hello,\n \nI have a 92 Toyota 4X4 and in the last few weeks I have been getting quite\na few "dings" :( in the paint on the hood from rocks and debris off of the\nroad. I have never had any major problems with other car/trucks in the past\n(maybe a ding once in a while). I went to the dealer and he said that it\nhappens all of the time and he recomended putting a bug deflector on the\nhood. He said that the trucks, for some unknown reason, seem to have this\nproblem more than some cars.? \n\nIt seems to me that either my luck is really bad or there might be a problem\nwith the paint (painted on a monday morning perhaps?). \n \nHow well do these bug deflectors work for small road debris on trucks? \n \nIf anyone has any experiences/suggestions please let me know, thanks.\n \n--Greg
While your 0-60 time is consistent with most car magazines and reports, I saw\nthe PBS MotorWeek show clock a 5-speed SL2 at 7.9 seconds.  I'm sure that most\nSL2 owners will be VERY lucky to get this speed, but 7.9 seconds is still\nastonishingly fast for a small 4-door.  A new Civic EX runs about 8.2 seconds\n0-60, if I'm not mistaken.  Most cars in this class are lucky to be in the\n9-second range.

Archive-Name: rec-autos/part6\n\n[New article as of 4 February 1993 -- rpw]\n\n\nMany people want to set up mailing lists for their favorite\nautomotive topics; rather fewer know how to do it.  This article\nwill provide the essential information for doing so on standard\nUnix systems.  A shell script and examples of alias file setups\nare included which presently run on a Sparc 2 here at balltown.cma.com\nfor a number of mailing lists.  Note that if you do set up an automotive\nmailing list, please let me know of the -request address so that I can\nlist it in the montly rec.autos posting.  Also inform the keeper of the\nUsenet list-of-lists (check news.answers for this monthly posting.)\n\nFirst of all, to get anywhere, you need to either 1) be a sysadmin,\nor 2) have some measure of assistance from your sysadmin.  It is also\nimportant that you have reasonably good network connectivity; if it seems\nlike you get everything several days after anyone else, or that you\nhave trouble getting email through, then your network connectivity is\nprobably not good enough.\n\nListserv:\n\nThere is a handy automated mailing list package named listserv, which\nis available from several ftp servers on the network.  Details of\nthe installation and operation of listserv are beyond the scope of this\narticle, but anyone who is considering running a large mailing list should\nprobably  look at listserv carefully.\n\nThe Alias file:\n\nOn a typical unix system; there is a file named /usr/lib/aliases on\nwhichever file server is your mail host; it contains lines such as:\n\nfoo:   bar, baz, bletch\n\n\nwhich means that any email sent the name `foo' on that host is\nredistributed to users bar, baz, and bletch.  thus, the simplest\npossible email list is \n\nmy-favorite-car:  member1, member2, member3, my-address\nmy-favorite-car-request: my-address\n\nthis has a couple of problems; the most noticeable one being that\nyou have to be superuser to edit the alias file.  however, you can\ndo the following, with the connivance of your sysadmin:\n\nmy-favorite-car: :include:/home/mydir/misc/autos/my-favorite-car-list\nmy-favorite-car-request: my-address\n\nWhere the file specified is a list of comma and newline separated\naddresses.  This file can be in the list admin's home directory,\nowned by the list admin.\n\nBounced Mail:\n\nthis still has a problem; bounced mail usually gets distributed to all the\nmembers of the list, which is generally considered somewhat irritating.\nTherefore, the way that the driving school mailing list is set up\nis instructive (Thanks to harpal chohan of the bmw list for this setup,\nby the way.  I'm not sure where he got it from.)\n\n\nschool-request:   welty\nschool-rebroadcast:  :include:/home/newwelty/misc/autos/school/list\nschool: "|/usr/local/adm/bin/explscript school"\nowner-school: school-request\nowner-school-out: school-request\n\n\nhere's what is going on here:\n\nthe owner- and -request addresses are intended as traps for bounced mail\ncoming from the network.  the -request address also serves as the point\nof contact for administrative duties.\n\nschool is what people send mail to; instead of pointing at addresses,\nit points at a shell script which rewrites headers before resending\nthe email.  school-broadcast (of which nobody except me knows the name;\nthe name has been changed here to protect my own sanity) points at the\nactual list members.\n\nthe shell script i use is as follows:\n\n-----------------\n#!/bin/sh\ncd /tmp\nsed -e '/^Reply-To:/d' -e '/^Sender:/d' -e '/^From /d' | \\n        (echo Reply-To: ${1}@balltown.cma.com; \\n         echo Errors-To: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\n         echo Sender: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\n         cat -) | \\n        /usr/lib/sendmail -om -f ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com \\n                -F "The ${1} Mailing List" ${1}-rebroadcast\nexit 0\n-------------------\n\nnote that this script does not know the name of the list; the name\nis passed in from outside, so that the script may be used for multiple\nlists (i run several out of this site.)\nthe script excises Reply-To:, Sender:, and From lines from the incoming\nmessage, substitutes for Sender: and Reply-To:, and adds Errors-to:\n99.9% of all email bounce messages end up being sent to the -request\nor owner- addresses if this header rewrite is done.\n\nFor digested lists, there is some digestification software around.\nHopefully I'll be able to provide more information in a future version\nof this posting.\n\nrichard welty (welty@balltown.cma.com)
The restriction could have to do with the car being a convertible.\n\nA lot of paronoid laws were passed concerning convertibles in the 80's.\nThese states may require greater rollover protection than the Capri affords.\n\n               Thatch Harvey
They light the highways in Texas?  Funny, everywhere else I've been\nthey only light 'em at junctions.\n\nI won't even get into how much road markings vary between states and\nlocalities except to say that there are some areas where markings are\nessentially nonexistant.\n\n\n\nI suspect you have very limited experience -- US freeways vary\ndramatically, particularly between states.  I can name a number of\ninterstate highways in various parts of the country where 130 would be\nvery optimistic in any car.\n\nI'm not sure what you call "quite severe" in terms of road deviations\nbut I suspect every single bridge junction on I84 through CT would be\nconsidered so.  They're hard to take at 85mph.  That's not the only\ninterstate I've seen with such deviations, but it's one I drive\nfrequently.\n\nTexas is pretty much an edge-case -- you can't assume that everywhere\nhas roads in such good condition, such flat terrain, and such\nwide-open spaces.  It just ain't so.
Definitely!\n\nSafety is an important criterium for me when buying a car. I won't buy a \nsmall car like a Civic or whatever.\n\nGreat = Safety + Handling + Speed  -  for me\n\nSeems to me that you would be more "dead" in a small car than a large car \nafter an accident.
Hi.. Me and My roomate are going to redecorate the "living room" and \nwe thought it would be a cool idea to have a license plate from every \nstate in the US and then from whereever else we could find, like canada,\nMexixo, even some European ones.\n\n  If anyone has any ideas or knows someone that could help us out\nplease let me know....  The more recent, the better, but anything\nwould be nice.\n\n  Either that or if you have an old plate hanging around... (hint hint!)\n\nKev\nwanderer@camelot.bradley.edu

Any reason you are limited to the two mentioned? They aren't really at\nthe same point along the SUV spectrum - not to mention price range.\nHow about the Explorer, Trooper, Blazer, Montero, and if the budget\nallows, the Land Cruiser? \nBear in mind that 90% of all SUV's purchased never venture off-road.\nCarefully weigh the trade-off between comfort and off-road performance\nwhen choosing one, and realistically decide whether you'll actually\nmake enough use of the off-road-ability to sacrifice (some of) the\non-road comfort.\n\n\n\nJohn
Personally, i wouldn't use the $1.29 product from KMart. I knew about\nthis previously, but this past weekend on PBS's MotorWeek Pat Goss \n(their resident tech type) discussed these products, and recommends\nnot using them (i.e, the non-isopropyl alcohlo based injector cleaners).\n\nSupposedly only the isopropyl based cleaners actually remove moisture\nfrom your fuel tank as they clean your injectors.  And although the \nothers (ethyl based) do clean injectors they also cause rubber \ncomponents in the fuel system to deteriorate, and they don't mix well\nwith water to help remove it from the fuel system.\n\nI use a product recommended by VW called 44K (by BG Products, Inc.).\nIt cost more about $14.00, but it is supposed to do the job without\nthe potential harmful side effects, and its results are supposed to \nlast from 2k to 4k miles. I have also used Chevron's Techtrolene (sp?).\n\nI can't say that i have noticed any difference using either, since i \nonly use these product as a preventative maintenance item.\n\n\n                                                  .  \n                                                 /                \nLarry                            __/    _______/_                 \nkeys@csmes.ncsl.nist.gov       /                  \               \n                          _____     __     _____    \------- ===\n            ----------- / ____/   /  /   /__  __/              \\n         /     ___    /  / ___   /  /      / /    ____          |\n        |    /      \/ /__ /  | /  /__  __/ /__ /       \      / \n        /___         \_______/ /_____/ /______/            ====OO\n            \       /                           \       /         \n                -            1990 2.0 16v           -\n\n\n       ---------------- FAHRVERGNUGEN FOREVER! --------------------            \n            The fact that I need to explain it to you indicates\n            that you probably wouldn't understand anyway!
I was wondering if anyone out there could enlighten me on this car I saw\nthe other day. It was a 2-door sports car, looked to be from the late 60s/\nearly 70s. It was called a Bricklin. The doors were really small. In addition,\nthe front bumper was separate from the rest of the body. This is \nall I know. If anyone can tellme a model name, engine specs, years\nof production, where this car is made, history, or whatever info you\nhave on this funky looking car, please e-mail.
My sister has an MGB.  She has one from the last year they were produced\n(1978? 1979?).  Its in very good shape.  I've been bugging her for years\nabout selling it.  I've said over and over that she should sell it\nbefore the car is worthless while she maintains that the car may\nactually be increasing in value as a result of its limited availability.\n\nWhich one of us is right?  Are there MGB affectionados out there who are\nstill willing to pay $6K to 8K for an old MG?  Are there a lot out in the \nmarket?\n--
The Olds Supreme Convertible got high marks in C/D's recent test, if\nyou can get by the stupid body moldings and stuff.  The Saab 900 ragtop may\nbe out of your range, but its a good choice.

Well, I never wrote that I would act as you described.  I stated that I \nwould not block a would-be passer.  I would not block a would-be passer\n"for their own good" or for any reason other than I was prevented from \ndoing so due to the traffic circumstance.  I fail to see how deterring a\npasser under these circumstance would IN ANY WAY decrease YOUR chances\nof being involved in an accident, fatal or otherwise.  In fact, I could\nimagine how blocking a would-be passer would actually INCREASE your \nchances of being "offed" or involved in an accident, especially if \nthis "passer" is riding your bumper.  Intentionally blocking a person\nriding your bumper is certainly NOT a "wise driving practice", it \nonly causes the jam to become more congested. \n \nI don't mess with trucks and I actually watch the road ahead AND the \nroad behind!   If I perceive that I am rapidly closing on a "pack" \nof vehicles, I try to avoid getting caught up in situation such as you \ndecribe.  Usually either traffic is just building and I have to deal \nwith this fact of life, or I wait to a slow passer to complete their \npass and make way for the pack to clear.  If someone decides then to \npull up on my bumper, I signal my intention to move to the right, and \ndo so at the first opportunity (& hope they will open the jam).  I \nfeel this is not only courteous driving, but ALOT safer than the \nactions you advocate!!!  There are actually many courteous drivers \non the road who do not intentionally impede others.
I don't know where you live, but I couldn't get out of my driveway\nat night without reverse lights. As someone said, out in the country\nyou notice neat little things like stars and the difference between\nday and night. At night around my house (which is amongst a forest of\nrather tall oaks) it is DARK, except for nights with full moons.\nReverse lights illuminate my path very well when backing up; I greatly\nprefer cars with them to cars without operational reverse lights.\n\n				James
Carrying a pistol, loaded or unloaded, in the glove compartment, is\nconsidered carrying a concealed weapon in Colorado and is illegal without\na concealed weapons permit.  Unless the law has been changed recently,\ncarrying a weapon openly is legal in Colorado but concealing it is illegal.\nI read a newspaper account last year where police stopped a car on a\ntraffic infraction and observed a .357 magnum revolver sitting on the\nseat.  The driver could not be cited for possessing or carrying the weapon\nbecause it was not concealed.  The article stated that if the gun had\nbeen discovered in the glove box, it would have been considered a crime.
Hi everybody,\n\n   I will buy a Honda Civic EX Coupe.  The dealer ask $12,750 for it,\nincluding A/C ( installed ), but not including stereo, tax, registration\nfees.  I live in Mexico, so I don't have time to go to a lot of dealers\nand compare their prices.  The dealer is in McAllen, Tx.  Is this a good\nprice for that car ?  If not, how much should I pay for it ?\n\n   Please e-mail ASAP if you don't want to post.  Thanks a lot.\n\n   Orlando Pugliese\n   opuglies@mtecv2.mty.itesm.mx
We're considering getting a Ford Explorer XLT with 4WD and we have the\nfollowing questions (All we would do is go skiing -- no off-roading):\n\n1.

Do we need the all-terrain tires (P235/75X15) or will the\nall-season (P225/70X15) be good enough for us at Lake Tahoe?\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nTom\n\n-- \n\n\n===========================================================================\n\n        Tom Shou			Silicon Graphics\n	shou@asd.sgi.com		2011 N.

Hm... I find this hard to believe.  V16T weights about the same as\nthe Red Head, but it has hell lot more horse power.  Perhaps it's\ndue to pre-production glitches?  Well, to me, it still got the most\nimposing styling among all the sports cars I have seen.

Labour prices for car service are very expensive in Toronto compared to other\nparts of Ontario.  For example, there are places in Ottawa that still charge\n"only" $40/hour.  I've seen a couple of places charging $60/hour.  The cheapest\nI've heard in Toronto is $70/hour.
sure sounds like they got a ringer.  the 325is i drove was definitely\nfaster than that.  if you want to quote numbers, my AW AutoFile shows\n0-60 in 7.4, 1/4 mile in 15.9.  it quotes Car and Driver's figures\nof 6.9 and 15.3.  oh, BTW, these numbers are for the 325i.\n\ni don't know how the addition of variable valve timing for 1993 affects it.\nbut don't take my word for it.  go drive it.

Yes, I saw a 200 Turbo Quattro wagon on I-287 in NJ on Monday.  I thought\nAudi stopped selling wagons in the US after the 5000.  This is exactly the\ntype of vehicle I would like to own.  I bet its price is 4-5 times my\ncar budget.
Could be due to the rear-end ratio also.  \n\nUsually automatics have different rear-ends than manuals, from\nmy limited experience anyways.\n\nDavid
Why crawl under the car at all? I have a machine I got for my boat that \npulls the oil out under suction through the dip stick tube. It does an\nexcellent job and by moving the suction tube around, you can get more \nold oil out than by using the drain plug. I think I paid $25 at E&B Marine.\nThe oil goes into a steel 3 gal can - wait until it cools and decant into\nyour favorite device. I use soft drink bottles. Easy to take them down to\nthe local oil recycle center.

The answer to your question is...sort of. Volkswagen had a\nmuch less robust version of this army vehicle out in the\nearly '70's (or thereabouts). It was called the Volskwagen\nThing, and was, of course, a convertible. I havent seen\nmany around then or now. Good luck...\n-Mik

Consumer Reports once wrote about the S-10 Blazer that it "shook and rattled\nlike a tired taxi cab".  There is one noise that is expecially irritating -\nthe back window squeaks.  I believe its because the whole tailgate assembly\nand window are not solid.  Anyway, has anyone had the same problem, and have\nyou found any fixes?

Remember roads in America are NOT designed for speeds above 80 meaning they\nwould be safe at 55-65. Roads like the Autobahn are smoother, straiter,\nwider and slightly banked. \n\nExample: A few months back I was traveling late at  night ( 3:00 am or so)\nand I was changing highways at a bent crosssing. It  curved off to the south\neast becoming hidden by trees after about 1,000 ft and continued to the\nleft strait north. I wanted to turn north, checked the south lane, rolled\ninto the crossing and checked the north lane. Nevertheless there wasn't \na car in sight, so I took one last look and pulled into the left hand lane.\nNow my car isn't a 5 sec 0-60 performer but I was in the corect lane and \nover 40 in decent time, even at 3:00 I wasn't wasting time. It was then\nthat I checked my mirror and saw a Mustang closing in my lane *FAST*, he \nhad just turned the corner and was just noticing me. Luckly he saw me and \nchanged lanes in time, I estamate he was moving in excess of 90 or so.\nI was just a by stander, I had no chance of runing from him, or moving out \nof his way. I'm glad he saw my brake lights in time. I shudder to \nthink of what would have happened had I wainted to pull out and not \nleft the time he needed to dodge me.\n\nRule: Just because your car can do 100+, and  your way is clear,\ndon't assume it will stay that way.
These arethe numbers I have been stating in the past 5-10 messages. It\nreally angers me that you insisted you were right, and that you had\nno clue what your own car weighed. Why didn't you check when I first\ntold you that your figures were implausible?\n\n\n\nI'd like to hear a better explanatin of how you come to that \nconclusion from the above data.\n\nNo, sorry your wrong again. *You* quoted the del Sol as doing 0-60 in\n8.1 according to C+D. Interestingly, the Stealth ES, which is\n*faster* than your RT does the samerun in 8.5 seconds according to\nC+D. Kind of embarassing isn't it? Why didn't you check the figures\n\nbefore posting? It only makes you look stupid when you are caught out\ntwice with *your own* figures.\n\n\nYou really should have checked.\n\n      *2*\nIf you insist, I gave you every chance to retract, but:\n\n  Dodge Stealth ES Auto does an 8.5/16.4 - Wonder why you couldn't find it?\n\nDo you realize that a 9k Sentra (C+D) will run a 16.7, that a Sentra SE-R or Saturn\nwill run in the 15's? Don't you think it is kind of strange that your\n222hp sports car is so easily beaten. \n\nA Mustang 5.0, which weights about the same (according to *your* numbers),\nhas less power and is much quicker? Care to explain. Don't be abusive,\njust try and come up with a rational explanation of where those 222hp\nwent to, its a mystery to me.
On the cars mentioned - 3 series from the late 80's the "electronic"\nodometer is really a mechanical drum type odometer, that is driven\nby pulses from a speed sensor on the rear axle.  These pulses are \nconverted into mechanical pulses that turn the odometer - and speedometer.\nNo way changing or erasing an eprom is going to change the mileage\nreading.  It also means the odometer is just as easy (or hard) to\nchange as any other mechanical odometer.\n\nOn the other hand it is a bit easier to disconnect the speed sensor\nand run the car with no speedometer or odometer reading...a simple\nswitch will do the job.  It also will disable the speed limiter,\nwhich will enable the car to reach it's full speed.  ;-)
out-\nhave\nair,\nhahaha ... my sentiments exactly.
I couldnt agree more.  That is how it SHOULD work. People should also ALWAYS see motorcycles too.\n\nI CONSTANTLY scan behind me (I have one of those wink mirrors) and two outside mirrors.  I actually spend just as much time checking my six (cops you know).\n\nI still get caught off guard every now and then.
It depends on your priorities.  A lot of people put higher priorities\non gas mileage and cost than on safety, buying "unsafe" econoboxes\ninstead of Volvos.  I personally take a middle ground -- the only\nthing I really look for is a three-point seatbelt and 5+mph bumpers.\nI figure that 30mph collisions into brick walls aren't common enough\nfor me to spend that much extra money for protection, but there are\nlots of low-speed collisions that do worry me.
Yes.  But the point is that prices are competetive.  Saturn may\nwell be selling a car intended on giving the dealer a $2000 profit, but \nsince a comperable Honda with $500 profit is more expensive, it may be well\nworth it to buy the Saturn.\n\n\n\n\n\n	Not necessarily.  It seems to me that Saturn salesdroids, who don't \nmake a commision, whereas their counterparts at other dealerships generally\ndo, make more $$ per hour or whatever.  This means that Saturn doesn't give up\nthe profit to their employees through commision, which IS taken out of per-\ncar profits.  They just pass it along to less pressureing salesmen/women.\n\n\n	Maybe.  Maybe not.  Depends on accounting practices.  I'd rather pay\nmore for dealer service that doesn't cut corners to contain costs...\n\n\n\n$2/100\nCKA\n'87 (Carolina) Blue Honda Civic DX
Sure, but the surface condition of most good autobahns is far better\nthan most of the roads here. A dip in the asphalt that you test your\nshocks on at 60 will kill you at 130. Don't get me wrong, I love to\ndrive quickly and they say my Probe will do 130, but that's 30 more\nthan I've ever tried in it cause there isn't a decent enough piece\nof road hereabouts.
Dear Netters:\n\nI am looking to buy a used Eagle Talon '91 or '91 TSi AWD.\nQuestion is that the '91 TSi AWD was mentioned in the\nApril Consumer Reports to a car to avoid!\n\nIn particular, the manual transmission, electrical system,\nand brakes were below par (in both models).  A friend of mine\nownes a '90 TSi AWD and he has had 2 brake jobs (pads), one\nstuck valve, and some clutch/transmission problem, something\nabout sticking/grinding into second gear.  This doesn't seem\ntoo bad if one "beats" on his car.\n\nI am willing to suffer reliability--for speed and looks.  Seems\nyou have to pay big buck if you want all three.  Anyway can\nanyone please let me know how you like your Talon, and any\nproblems you may have had, and if the repairs are worth it.\n\nThanks for any responses!
Society\nthose\nshaky\n\nNow, I'm not saying you're wrong because I know that the R-12 substitutes  \nexist, but this sounds a lot like the 200mpg carbs that the oil companies  \nkeep us all from getting.

No one should EVER rely on just a magazine to determine what car they\nbuy, I don't care what magazine. Btw, I subscribe to three other \nauto rags, I just think CU is getting a bum rap by these macho men\nfrom hell who think real men should read . . . .\n\nStatements like what you said above have no meaning. People keep on\nsaying "CU is only good for dishwashing detergent" or as you\nall they say. \n\nIf there were as critical of themsevles as they are of CU maybe there\nwould be some real content.\n\njohn
You probably should told you dad to buy that car, than your dream might\ncome true.
I was wondering if someone could point me to somewhere I could\nfind a list (and hopefully comparison) of all the convertibles that are\nout these days. Seems like they are making a big comeback - but I'm not\nsure where to look
: Ford and his automobile.  I need information on whether Ford is\n: partially responsible for all of the car accidents and the depletion of\n: the ozone layer.

Thank God Louis Chevrolet is \ninnocent! and that guy Diesel, HE otto feel guilty!
the transmission in my car contradicts both your assertions..  i get much\nstronger acceleration if i let the convertor lockup.. which i can induce\nby briefly lifting off,  then quickly (but not too quickly to trigger\na kickdown) applying throttle.  above 3000 rpms, the convertor will never\nunlock;  it would kickdown first.\n\nwho says there's no skill involved in driving an automatic?  i think\nof it as the throttle and shifter combined into a single pedal.  with\nmy car i can pretty much influence its shifting patterns with my\nright foot, while having both hands to steer.

I have a 86 chevy sprint with a/c and 4doors. It's odometer turned 90k\nand the sensor light started blinking. I went to the dealer and he said\nit was a maintenance light saying I need to change the Oxygen sensor. He\nsaid, It is to be changed every 30k, but since I bought the car when it\nhad 77k, I don't know if the same thing happened at 30k and 60k.  He\nquoted $198 for the part and $50 to install it. The part cost $30\noutside, but the mechanic I went to could not fix it saying the sensor\nis placed too deep in the engine parts. He suggested I wait till it\nmalfunctions before I do anything.  If anyone out there owns a chevy\nsprint, I want to know how they got their Oxygen sensors changed. Also,\ndid you face any problem with fixing it without the dealer's help. Also,\nwhat are the results of the oxygen sensor malfunction. \n  Any help would be greatly apprecisted\n   Thanks\n      Nagesh
I had the same problem in my '90 MX-6. Luckily I had it fixed\nunder warranty. I think they replaced a tail light gasket.\nCheck with a dealer, it's a known problem.
Makes sense, since the new Mercedes Benz engines go from 2.2L-4 to a 2.8L-6.\nNothing in between.  BTW, I beleive the numbers on those MB engines are\n156 and 225 hp respectively.  The one-upmanship in hp might induce BMW\nto create a larger six.  Also, the 2.6 190E has lagged behind the 3-er\n2.5 for some time wrt hp.   I am sure the Bavarians wouldn't want to be\n"shown-up" by the Schwabians.\n\nPS- those MB engines haven't been released over here yet.
Yeah, I loved the vent windows on my 82 Escort (hell, the only thing I liked\nabout the car).  One of the things I'd like to see brought back.  Does\nanyone know if they're an option on the new Escorts?
My BBB Autoline arbitration experience is over.  \nThe outcome was decidedly mixed.  I won the battle but \nlost the war.  The arbitrator found that the car was \ndefective, but decided to offer a repurchase well below \nmarket value :(.  At the time of the hearing, average \nretail on my truck in the NADA book was $21,025, but \nthe decision was for  $17,665.  I wrote a letter to the \nCouncil of Better Business Bureaus pointing out the \nfact that if you have an automobile that does not \ndepreciate rapidly, the manufacturer has no incentive \nto deal with you.  There is no way that the \nmanufacturer can loose because they can turn around and \nsell the vehicle at a profit if the consumer is awarded \na repurchase.  The attitude of Chevrolet's \nrepresentative at the hearing tends to support this \npoint of view;  he was totally unprepared and did not \nseem to take the proceeding very seriously.\n\nI decided to take the repurchase, even though I am \ngetting totally screwed on the price.  I will not have \nto deal with continuing repairs or selling a lemon \nmyself, and I have no case for a civil suit based on \nthe Idaho lemon law.  I am planning to send a letter to \nmy elected representatives telling them how utterly \nridiculous the Idaho lemon law is.  The law allows for \na "use deduction" equal to the IRS mileage allowance.  \nAs if Chevrolet were buying my gas and paying \nfor my insurance.\n\nSummary of the case:  In May 1992 I bought a new 3/4 ton\nHD Chevrolet pickup.  Between May 1992 and December 1992 \nthis vehicle required repair after repair.  Systems \nthat required attention included the transmission, \nheater fan, paint, suspension, and motor.  The main \nproblem was the five speed manual transmission.  They \ncould not install a non-defective transmission in at \nleast four attempts.\n\nSo, in summary, it is possible to get a repurchase, but \nyou are going to get screwed on the price, unless you \npaid too much in the first place, or if your car \nhappens to be a model that depreciates rapidly.
Good point. I have no idea how either of my Hondas will handle at 100+ mph,\nnor do they reach 155. However, using `high' to be 70-90 mph:\n\na) They are quite amenable to long high speed drives. I've done several\n1k mile+ trips in my Civic with no problems whatsoever. The last big trip\nI made was driving from New York to Texas. I remember driving 700-800\nmiles a day at typically 75-85 mph  without any problems. I'm sure I  \nwould have been more comfortable driving a benz, but no white knuckles.\nNo problems with winds and curves. \n\nThen there was the trip back from New Orleans after Mardi Gras - where\nwe were doing 80+ all the way to Houston. No problems.\n\nb) Both my cars have surprising good fuel economy at high speeds. I see\nno difference between sustained 60 mph and sustained 80mph. On the trip\nback from New Orleans, we got about 30 mpg in my Integra, quite ok. Mind\nyou, the engine revs to almost 4k at 80. The civic is markedly better\nthan the Integra in fuel economy. 50k miles down the road, I still\nget 35 mpg at 70-75 mph driving.\n\n\n\nNow now, you can't compare a diesel with a gasoline engine. I see enough\nbmws and gasoline mercs for sale that have 100-150k miles on them and advertise \nrebuilt engines. If honda was to build an accord for 30k, I'd darn well\nexpect the sucker to last 300k miles.\n\n\nEver got caught behind a early 80's 300SDL at a stop light? It's not\npleasant. The newer MB's are a lot better though. The diesel Volvos\nand VWs are probably the smelliest offenders.\n\nAs for economy, why should we care? Gas is cheap!

Hello netters!\n\nI'm visiting the US (I'm from Sweden) in August. I will probably rent a Chevy\nBeretta from Alamo. I've been quoted $225 for a week/ $54 for additional days. \nThis would include free driving distance, but not local taxes (Baltimore). \nThey also told me all insurance thats necessary is included, but I doubt that,\n 'cause a friend rented a car last year and it turned out he needed a lot more\ninsurance than what's included in the base price. But on the other hand he didn't\nrent it from Alamo.\n\nDoes anyone have some info on this?\n\nIs $225 a rip-off? \nProbability that I'll be needing more insurance?\nIs the beretta a good rental car?\n\nThanx
I think the Manta is the European name for the "GT."  I'm pretty sure\nthat the only Kadett's sold here were/are the Pontiac LeMans.  I think the\nGT is just an early '70s to mid '70s Manta.

Well Sweden and Australia, and lord knows wherever else used to drive on\nthe "wrong" side of the road, so the export market might have been\nlarger then than just the UK.\n\n\nBy the 1920s, there was a very active "good roads" movement, which had\nits origins actually in the 1890s during the bicycle craze, picked up\nsteam in the teens (witness the Linclon Highway Association, 1912 or so,\nand the US highway support act (real name: something different) in 1916\nthat first pledged federal aid to states and counties to build decent\nroads. Also, the experience of widespread use of trucks for domestic\ntransport during WW 1 convinced the government that good raods were\ncrucial to our national defense.  Anyway, by the 20s there were plenty\nof good roads, at least around urban areas, and they were rapidly\nexpanding into the countryside.  This was the era, after all, of the\nfirst auto touring fad, the motel, the auto camp ground, etc. Two good\nbooks on the subject spring to mind - Warren Belasco "America on the\nRoad" (title may not be exact - author is) and another called "The Devil\nWagon in God's Country" author I forget.  Also, any of John Flink's  or\nJohn Bell Rae's auto histories.\n\nAs to placement of the steering wheel being arbitrary, by the early\nteens there were virtually no American cars that did not have the wheel\non the left.  In the early days, cars had the wheel on the left, on the\nright, and even in the middle, as well as sometimes having a tiller\ninstead of a wheel.  This was standardized fairly early on, though I\ndon't know why.\n\n\nDan\ndh3q@andrew.cmu.edu\nCarnegie Mellon University\nApplied History

Front drive,\n2.4 L 20 valves motor, completely new chassis etc. Even the British magazine\n"CAR" liked it (and believe me, that is quite much for a Volvo). And\nthe American magazine "Road & Track" said that "This is not your uncle\nOlof's car", and in a positive sense.\n\nBut in any case, I'd still like to own the 960 estate.

Yes this is a common problem.  The leaks occur through the seal of the \ntaillights.  Unfortunately, Ford has this with Most Probes and does\nnot have a recall for it.  Very dissatisfying to say the least.\n\n\nThere is no drain holes that I know of.  I used a margine tub to drain it\nRegretably I waited three months as I was short cash and they wouldn't fix it\nunder warrantee.  Then I paid dearly as it messed up my electrical system\nincluding a balance/motion sensor which is located near the fuel shutoff in \nthe trunk.  This resulted in my passive restraints malfunctioning--they would\nnot retract.  So I ended up paying about $200 to have the sensor replaced; \n$90 to have the tail lights resealed (they firts replaced the hatch gasket\nwhich I insisted was not the problem so they did not charge me for that\nwhen I proved to be right.); not to mention the water damage to the \ncovers to the trunk/spare com partment and algae in the taillights.\n\nvery annoying.  Don't let the water problem go--get it fixed or you'll pay\nmore later.  Considering how common a problem it is I hope every one\ncomplains to Ford.
I stand corrected.  This is all from memory, mind you  :-)\n\n\nYeah, that's what I was trying to say.  No, REALLY!

The Chevrolet brothers were respected racers & test drivers for the\nBuick Co. when Durant was there.\n\nWhen the directors kicked Durant out of GM in 1910 he took Chevrolet and\nothers with him.  As mentioned before, they founded the successful\nChevrolet company.\n\nA little-known fact is that the Chevrolet Co. actually took over GM!\nThat was how Durant got back in charge of GM-- legally his new company\nChevrolet Co. did the buying, and GM was a division of Chevrolet!\n\nAfter 1920 and into the Sloan era, GM shuffled things so that the GM\nboard was superior, but there was always a degree of autonomy given\nthe Chevy division, presumably because of the initial structure.\n(If you look at the organization chart for GM in Sloan's book, Chevy\ndivision reports directly to 14th floor, not through the "passenger\ncar division" which covers Buick, Olds, Cadillac, and Oakland/Pontiac)
^^\n\nI think you mean late '60s.

There are two very long entry ramps which all the hurry-up\nyahoos dive into cause they want to get ahead. When we get to the point\nwhere these ramps merge, all hell breaks lose. The result is that traffic\nwhich was moving at 55 on the VA side of the bridge, stalls on t'other\nside. If these dingbats had stayed in lane, allowed the folks coming up\nthe two ramps to merge, we would still be doing 55. Instead we do start-\nstop for 4 miles. Dave Barry's idea of a laser equipped car would be\nreal useful here.\n\nBob
I found a Mopar spec sheet this weekend:\n\n               model         wgt    hp\n             Stealth         3086   164\n             Stealth ES      3186   222\n             Stealth RT      3373   222\n             Stealth RT TT   3803   300\n\n Okay, I'll take "their" word for it.\n\n\n\n Seems that the 1993 Mustang 5.0 is rated at 205 hp ONLY because Ford\n changed its testing procedures.  Under the older procedures, it still \n rates closer to 225 hp.  That means that the Mustang has 3 hp more.\n \n And you still haven't posted any weight figures for the Mustang.\n\n\n\n Yeah, sure, in your wet dreams.  And that's probably where you got \n that 11.2 second 0-60 for the Stealth.\n\n\n\n For 3 posts now you've been harping on this May 1991 issue of Car & Driver\n without posting any numbers.  Why not?  Because they prove me right and you\n ain't got the guts to admit it?  Yeah, thought so.\n\n\n\n No, I'm going to play your game -\n\n       No way, Sentra's are SLOW!  I took a test drive and it took\n       21.7 to go 0-50!  Why, even the Hyundai Excel blows it doors\n       off.  Any 12 yr old knows that!  I race and I'll kick your butt! \n       blah, blah, blah...\n\n Let's see ...  yep, that sounds just like you. \n Oh man, I just got it!  Beavis & Butthead - that's you!\n\n\n\n I dunno, why did you?\n\n But why would someone pick the Dodge Stealth RT over the Nissan Sentra?\n All it takes is one look.
The biggest hurdle for automatics (IMHO) is not shifting speed\nper se, but rather the transmission's reaction speed when you\ntry to force it to shift manually.  \n\nThis was the biggest fault with the Subaru ECVT -- it took SOOOOOO\nLONNNNNNNNGGGGG for the tranny to find the right ratio.\n\nThe sales propaganda says the Saturn automatic is effectively an\nelectronically-shifted manual.  Might this mean that Saturn has\nconquered the problem?  (I dunno, only driven Saturn 5-speeds)\n\nINPUT, PLEASE!
I have been looking at buying a 1989 Jeep Laredo and was wondering\nif anyone had any bad or good experiences with this model. Is it\nall that much different than the other YJs? \n\n It looks, feels and sounds like a nice vehicle even thought the\nprice is rather steep for an '89 (12K Canadian).
True 914 enthusiasts will be able to give you a better answer then this\nbut I'll dump my impressions.  I've wanted to own a 914 for about 10 years\nnow; came close once but I ended up buying a Fiero instead (biggest mistake\nof my life!)\n\nAnyway, for $4000 you should be able to get a nice car but your also set\nin the price range to get taken by a nice looker that is a pile of shit.\nThe most common total failure for the car would be frame rust between the\nengine and passenger compartment.  Also look for chassis welded together\nhere.  Oh yeah, the price range you are talking about must be the 4 banger;\na 6 (if you could find one) would be mucho more bucks.\n\nParts for the engine are pretty easy to come by (for an old car) and you\ncan even locate crude in the JC Whitney catalog if you have too.\n\nThe machine itself is pretty simple (they use the spare tire for windshild\nwasher instead of a pump fer chris sake!) so getting it fixed by a good\nbug/porsche mechanic would be easy.  Since it is mid-engine you may spend\nmore on labor for any mechanical work.

Water gradually builds up in the trunk of my friend's 89 Ford Probe.  Every\nonce in a while we would have to remove the spare and scoop out the water\nunder the plywood/carpet cover on the trunk.  I would guess this usually happens\nafter a good thunder storm.  A few Qs:\n\n1) Is this a common problem?\n2) Where are the drain holes located for the hatch?\n\nThanks for any info.\nTom
I am in the process of looking for a half decent aftermarket sport exhaust\nfor my 1981 BMW 320i. So far, I have found a Pacesetter exhaust for $219\nand an Ansa exhaust for $190 (Canadian funds). I was wondering if anyone\ncould tell me anyhting about either of these exhausts or any other possible\nexhausts that I may be interested in. My main priorities are a decent horse\npower increase (5-30%) and a nice low note to go along with that added power.\nI was also thinking of looking into both Remus and Leistritz exhausts.Has \nanyone got anything to say about these? I am mainly looking for the muffler\nonly but if anyone can find a good deal on a whole kit I would be willing to\ngo after that. I also would like to know how much these would cost me in the \nStates.Please mail me back if you have any information.
Hi everyone,\n\nI'm getting a car in the near future.  I've narrow it down to 300ZX and SC300.\nWhich might be a better choice?\n\nThanks for your opnion,\nDanny\n--

An on-the-road rally where participants are given a set of\n      directions and clues guiding participates around the \n      Joliet/Plainfield area.  The object is to navigate a course\n      based on a set of directions and clues.  Participants will\n      be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which\n      they must answer along the way.  Points are awarded for the\n      number of correct answers given.  Directions will ultimately \n      lead to an off-road area where a four-wheel drive course is \n      set-up.  At various locations in the on-road course, check-points\n      will be set-up where participants will be asked other questions\n      or requested to perform some activity (e.g. tire roll, truck tow,\n      basketball free-throw, etc.) for additional points.\n\n   2. An optional off-road, four wheel drive course where participants\n      will navigate off-road trails, mud bogs and/or hill climbs.\n      Points are awarded for successfully navigating off-road obstacles\n      without getting stuck.  If you should get stuck (which is half\n      the fun anyway), there will be assistance to get your vehicle\n      unstuck so you can try it again.  The off-road course will\n      divided up based on tire size, so stock 4x4s as well as modified\n      4x4s can run the course.\n     \n  At the end of the rally, trophies will be awarded to top scoring\n  participants.  Door prizes and dash plaques will also be given out.\n  Food and drinks also available at the conclusion.\n\n* This is an organized activity sponsored by the Joliet Mud Turtles\n  so safety and fun is our foremost concern.  All 4x4s must be\n  street legal and have solid tow points for the off-road section\n  of the course - we don't want to have to separate someone's bumper\n  from their vehicle :) .\n\nThe Particulars:\n\n* Rally begins at Instant Replay, 2409 Plainfield Road, Joliet Il.\n    (815)436-9382   (see map below)\n* Registration is between 9 and 10:30 a.m.  First truck out at 10:00 a.m.\n* Rally date is Sunday April 25th, rain or shine\n* There is an entry fee of $10 per truck.\n* You must have a co-driver (passengers allowed)\n* A valid drivers license is required\n* Suggested equipment:\n      CB Radio\n      Compass\n      Tow Strap and Clevis\n      Clip Board and Pencil\n* No alcohol during rally\n* For more information contact\n   Gary (815)727-3415\n   Tom  (815)485-9346\n   Norm Jr. (815)741-4853\n   Brian (708)979-6083\n\n\n                                            __\n              Instant                      /\\n      |       Replay |             |         \\n      | 1.9mi  ___   | 1.2 mi      |        North\n      |<----->|   | <------------> |\n Rt30 |       |___|  |             |\n------|---------------------------------------------\n Exit |              |             |         ^\n 257  |              |             |         |\n      |              |             |         |\n      |Rt55          |Canton       |Larkin   |\n      |              |Farm         |Ave      |\n      |              |Rd.          |         | 3 mi.\n      |              |             |         |\n      |              |             |         |\n      |                            |         |\n      |                            |         |\n      |       Rt80                 |         v
[stuff about Dodge Shadow deleted]\n\n\nWhat do you mean by "all models", all models of cars, all Chrysler models,\nall models that the fleet manager had bought? Because there is no way in\nhell that the Shadow is the most reliable car of all models sold, not\neven Chrysler's dept. of lies, damned lies and statistics would claim that.
addition,\n\nBricklins were manufactured in the 70s with engines from Ford. They are rather  \nodd looking with the encased front bumper. There aren't a lot of them around,  \nbut Hemmings (Motor News) ususally has ten or so listed. Basically, they are a  \nperformance Ford with new styling slapped on top.\n\n\nRush fan?
Ok, here's what I understand:\n\nThe SL/SL1/SL2/SW1/SW2 was meant to compete with the following cars:\n\nHonda Civic\nToyota Tercel (SL,SL1)\nToyota Corolla (SL1,SL2)\nNissan Sentra\nMazda 323/Protoge'\nSubaru Loyale/Impreza\nIsuzu Stylus\nGeo Prizm\nFord Escort\nMercury Tracer\nMistubishi Mirage\nPlymouth/Dodge Colt\n\n\nTheir core competition is the Civic, Corolla, and Sentra.  Most of the other\nmodels are in the same class, but aren't the first cars you would think of.\nI threw in the Escort/Tracer because it has a good amount of Japanese\ntechnology and has similar reliability stats.  I didn't include domestic small\ncars such as the Cavalier, Sunbird, Shadow, Sundance, Tempo, and Topaz, since I\nthink Saturn is going after cars that have at least some degree of Japanese\nroots.\n\nThe SC1/SC2 was meant to compete against the following cars:\n\nToyota Paseo\nHonda Civic Si/Civic Coupes/del Sol Si\nNissan NX1600/NX2000\nMazda MX-3\nIsuzu Impulse\nGeo Storm\nFord Escort GT\n\n\nIf you look at the prices of these cars, they're more expensive than they're\n4-door counterparts.  The is good reason for this.  It is a more upscale and\ntrend-driven market.  Even though many of these models are based on sedan\nplatforms, their interior, etc. is good enough to warrant slightly higher\nprices.  Here are some of the platform derivations I can think of:\n\nTercel -> Paseo\nSentra -> NX1600/NX2000\nCivic -> del Sol\n323 -> MX-3 (not sure on this one)\nStylus -> Impulse/Storm\n\nTo illustrate, a Tercel starts at around $8000, while the Paseo starts at\naround $11,000.  Even a 4-door Tercel will cost less than a 2-door Paseo.  Now,\nyou might be saying that the Tercel doesn't offer the power that some 4-doors\noffer.  What I mean is that there is no 4-dr Tercel with a comparable\npowerplant as its sport coupe derivative.  Let's take another example: the\nIsuzu Stylus XS and Impulse XS/Storm GSi.  Both have the same powerplants (a\n1.6L 140hp engine), but the smaller 2-dr coupes are generally more expensive.\nAgain, this is because the two-door sport coupe market is a more\nfashion-oriented and trend-setting segment.  People are willing to pay more\nmoney for this type of car.  \n\n\nIn short, even though the SC1/SC2 may be smaller, hence "less" car, it's market\norientation dictates a slightly higher price than its mechanically equivalent\nsedan (SL1/SL2) version.\n\nI hope this clears things up a bit......

I agree.  Six hour long stretches behind the wheel really make me\nthirsty, especially for something with caffeine.  I consider it a\nfailing of my car that it has no cup holder nor anywhere to put a cup\nholder.

In Des Moines, Iowa, about a year ago, some kid dropped a rock from an \noverpass and hit car just behind the windshield.  It put a dent in the roof, \nso I guess I was lucky it hit metal.\n\nIt's frustrating that we can't do much.  Bother the city government to put\ncovers on all overpasses?  Slow down/speed up a bit when driving under all\noverpasses in the city?  I like the first better, but that will take time\nand lots of people talking to the city governments.\n\nJust another .02...

While I can't think of any Corvettes with side mounted backup lights,\nI know that Saab started using them about 15 years ago.  My 1975 Saab 99\ndidn't have them, but a friend's 1978 Saab 99 certainly did.  In addition\nto the confentional tail-light mounted backup lights, they had another\nset integrated into the front turn signal assembly.  For those of you who\ndon't remember, Saabs of that vintage had an enormous multicoloured plastic\ngrowth, about the size of a _National Geographic_ magazine, sticking out\nof the front fender, which incorporated amber "parking lights", amber side\nmarker lights/reflectors, white "cornering lamps" (like American luxury\ncars) aimed towards the side of the road when you have your turn indicators\non, and white "backup lights" aimed towards the back of the car when you\nhave selected reverse gear.  The glossy brochure showed how these front\nmounted backup lights were useful for illuminating hazards (pot holes, kid's\ntoys, etc) that would be run over by the front of the car if you had the\nwheels turned while backing up.

Comparing the GTZ and GSR is apples to oranges, somewhat like a Mustang 5.0\nand a CRX, both have very different ways of doing things and ought to\nappeal to different buyers, i.e., I don't think an Acura owner would\nbe seen dead in a Chevy dealership or vice versa.\n\n[stuff deleted]\n\n\nNo Integra I have seen comes with all-season tires. \nThe GTZ does come with much bigger 16" wheels.\n\n\nThe C+D figures are almost certainly bogus and based on a hot prototype\nsupplied by Acura. The MT figures are more plausible.\n\n16.1 sounds reasonable, probably faster than regular Integras.\n\n\nThe GSR gearing is horrible for day to day driving. It needs a 6 speed\nbox more than any other modern car. Essentially 5th in a regualr Integra\nequals 4th in the GSR, and the regular Integras are very buzzy at speed.\n\n\nThe only person I knew with a GTZ had it bought back by GM as a lemon. It\nwas a piecve of junk, but very quick for FWD.\n\n\nThe only GSR owner I know had the engine throw a rod with less than 5k\nmiles, a rare screw up by Honda.\nBoth the GTZ and GSR are flawed cars. The performance enthusiasts would take\nthe GTZ and the CR purchase would be the GSR.

For those that are interested I got my fully optioned (Air, ABS,\nsunroof) '92 SE-R in September 1991 for $13,555 in Sacramento, CA. It\nwas one of the 1st '92s sold, few of the dealers had any, no local\ndealer had an ABS equipped SE-R.  I went straight to the fleet manager\nat the dealership I liked, told him what I wanted, made him aware that I\nknew what his price should be.

Unfortunately, I've got another story to add to this.  My girlfriend\nand I were driving through west L.A., and got pelted by a rock just as\nwe were pulling away from a stoplight.  The scary thing was that the\nrock was heavy enough to put a decent-sized dent in the door of my '72\nRiviera which is pretty much solid "Detriot Iron."

Do you, by any chance own an SHO or have access to one, such that you\nwould have any idea what it is designed for or how it handles?\n\nJust wondering...
Yeah.  I don't use the clutch all the time either.  I've done it\nwith Fords, BMW, Datsun, and Chevy and it works fine.  I can't think of\nany reason that it would damage the tranny.  Essentially you are just\ndoing what the synchros do anyhow - match the engine speed with the\ntranny speed and slip it into gear.\n\n\n\n\n	Sounds about right.  I usually slip it out during throttle-down\nand then blip the throttle and wait until it feels like things are right\n(usually about a second) and then slip it into gear...\n\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nJon "You obviously don't know who you're dealing with" Gross\njong@halcyon.com

What I don't understand is why \n\n\n\nYep.  They are popular vehicles.  You don't see a lot of previous model year\nones sitting on dealer's lots for any lenghth of time after the new ones are\nout.  The things sell, they are popular.\n\nBecause they are popular, and high-priced new, they are high price used, very\nsimple.\n\nI knew they were overpriced when I bought it... I knew they had a terrible \nreliability record when I bought it.  But I didn't expect anything like I\ngot, especially with a dealer network unable to repair it.  Personal experience\nhas quickly cured me of my infatuation with the machine.

[Long silly discussion deleted...]\n\n\nThis suggestion isn't as far-fetched as it sounds.  Years ago in another\ntime and place, I used to do oil changes in boats powered by automotive\nengines.  In many cases, there was no way to get any sort of a tray under\nthe oil pan because it was boxed in by the bottom of the hull and various\nfloation chambers on each side.  And if you *did* get something there, you'd\nspill all the oil out of it for sure trying to get it back out again.\n\nSo we used a small pump powered by an electric drill to suck the oil out\nthe dipstick hole.  There was a long/thin hose on the inlet side designed\nto fit down the dipstick tube, and another, thicker/shorter hose on the\noutlet side that you put into any convenient container.  I'm sure these\ngadgets are still available from marine hardware suppliers if you want one.
That is a question that can only be answered by yourself and where you live. \nIf you live in a place where crime is apparent, then it might be a good idea to\nget one simply as a deterrent.  However, if a professional thief wants your\nvehicle, its as good as gone no matter what you do.  But to slow down any\nthieves it would be a good idea to get the basic options.  That would be:\n\n1)	ignition kill or fuel cut-off\n2)	a flashing red LED\n\nThese two are basic to a decent alarm system.  \nTo slow down the criminal some more, get a steering wheel lock.\nThat should be sufficient to persuade the thief to find an easier target.\nBut, then there's always car-jacking.  \nWhy is life so confusing?\nI hope I helped somewhat.

Your best bet is the Dodge Intrepid with the SOHC 24 valve 3.4? six.\nit gets 214 hp, and has a hell of a lot of room, great styling, and\nABS, with four wheel disk breaks.  The LH cars won Automobile \nmagazines \n"automobile of the year" award, and are quiet impressive.
only when the torque converter is not locked up.  there are autos out there\nwith converter lock up in 2nd, 3rd and 4th gears.\n\n\nrare.. so are 5 speed autos.. but very real.\n\n\ni think that automatics have advanced far more than manuals.\nespecially in shift intelligence.  i say that a smart automatic is\nbetter than the majority of drivers in terms of being in the right\ngear at the right time, which to me is more important than torque\nconverter losses.\n\n\nwho says you can't have your cake and eat it too?  a well designed\nshifter will easily facilitate manual, clutchless shifts.  i am\nreferring to the much copied mercedes jagged gate.  the only\ndepartment where you lose out is in the number of ratios available,\nand of course the converter losses..\n\nif ayrton senna can drive a racecar with fully automatic transmission,\nit can't be half bad..  :-)
I think this is getting a little overheated.  Highway robbers have been a\npart of life since the Middle Ages at least.  It's human nature to look\nat history through rose colored glasses, but random acts of violence have\nbeen a ceaseless part of our heritage.  Overall, life is better now than it\never was then.  It's just that random individual acts of violence have\nnever\nbeen historically significant, and record keeping in the past was never\ngood\nenough to retain them all.
actually, disabled persons have been known to drive in SCCA\nraces.  i'd be careful about making sweeping generalizations here.\n\ni'd prefer a manual transmission, but the early SHO had an\nawful transmission that felt like it came out of a truck or something.\nit was almost enough to make me want an automatic.

This isn't anything new.  Back in 1985 I was driving under a high\noverpass at night on I-805 in San Diego when I caught a glimpse of\nsomeone on the overpass.  As I passed under a rock slammed against the\nmetal between the winshield and right front window.  My girlfriend was\nin the seat next to it.  I called the police from the next exit, but I\ndoubt if they were found.\n\nAbout five years ago in San Diego someone was put into a coma from a\nbrick being thrown through his sunroof as he was driving and\nsubsequently crashed.  I don't think he ever came out of the coma, and I\nhaven't heard anything about it for a couple years.\n\n\nProbably because there are many children there.  Also the minor fact\nthat other than defending themselves from 100 some people attacking them\nthey haven't threatened or attacked anyone outside the compound in\nyears.  Being a promiscuous religious nut does not constitute grounds\nfor a mass murder of Koresh and his followers.\n\nSorry for posting this to this group, but I thought the previous post\nneeded a rebuttal.  If you follow-up to this portion please cross-post\nand direct follow-ups to a more appropriate newsgroup.
Yes, Fred, my heart and prayers go out to the mother and others who have \nbeen victims of these and other senseless crimes.\n\n\nHowever, I feel that you have missed the point of the previous postings (see \ntop).  Your statement of 'responsibility' is felt as an attack towards the \nmembers of this group.  You are attempting to make the members of this group\nbe REQUIRED to answer.  The only people who should make a statement are people\nwho have experienced the problem and found a workable solution.\n\n\nMany people are interested, but have no input.  I will restate that your last\nsentence here is seen as an attack on the members of this group.  If people have\ninput, they will give it.  If they do not, YOU should not make them feel \ncompelled (sp?) to respond.  \n\nIf you wish to continue this conversation, PLEASE send e-mail.  DO NOT repost or\nattempt to bait me, I will not make another post (and may I make the same a\nsuggestion to other group members) on this matter.\n\n\n\nBTW, your welcome.\n--

I am considering buying an new car, so I called three insurance\ncompanies in California to get estimates. I asked for the same\ncoverage and same deductibles. Most of the companies charge you\naccording to your zip code. Others charge according to your city.\nAnyhow, I gave the same zip code and city to all three places. Here's\nwhat I found (for a '93 Integra GS):\n\nAAA: ~$2000/yr.\nState Farm: 2614.92/yr.\nAllstate: 1220/yr.\n\nAAA is non-profit, so they said I could also expect to receive about\n$200-300 back at the end of the year.\n\nStill, There is a huge gap between all of these companies. State Farm\nwants MORE than TWICE as much as Allstate. I think I should be\nsuspicious, but I've never heard anybody else complain.\n\nAny comments?
My wife and I looked at, and drove one last fall. This was a 1992 model.\nIt was WAYYYYYYYYY underpowered. I could not imagine driving it in the\nmountains here in Colorado at anything approaching highway speeds. I\nhave read that the new 1993 models have a newer, improved hp engine. \n\nI'm quite serious that I laughed in the salesman face when he said "once\nit's broken in it will feel more powerful". I had been used to driving a\nJeep 4.0L 190hp engine. I believe the 92's Land Cruisers (Land Yachts)\nwere 3.0L, the sames as the 4Runner, which is also underpowered (in my\nown personal opinion). \n\nThey are big cars, very roomy, but nothing spectacular.
W/r/t performance, converter lockup is purely irrelevant.  The lockup only\noccurs at light throttle settings and serves only to improve MPG.  Mind you,\na converter clutch does a lovely job of improving MPG, but the additional\nmechanical advantage of the converter gives you more acceleration (vs. locked\nconverter clutch) than its inherent losses take away.

All you have to do is turn it in to the police like you would an accident,\nget a report and send it in to your insurance company and they will contact\nthe other guys insurance company and they will have to pay just as they\nwould in an accident they caused.  Thus no need to go to court.  A friend of\nmine did this and he got the money so it does work.

I have just taken delivery on a new GM car (Firebird) with a \nclearcoat finish.  I assume that it is probably urethane since the \nindustry has moved in that direction in paints.\n \nIn years past, it used to be recommended that owners wait up to \n60 days before you wax a car, for the paint to "cure."  The dealer \nshop manager said this also, but I'm not sure that he wasn't just \nbasing it on past tradition.  Does anyone know if this is still a \nrecommended practice, or is it better to go ahead and wax right \naway (non-abrasive new car wax) with the newer finishes?
Bad driving habits can damage a car in a couple of months, not 6 years.\n\nIf that were not the case, everyone would be driving fleet rental re-solds...\n\nAnd while you are considering things (factors in stat terms), how about\ncity vs. highway driving ratios, owner vs. dealer service, extreme weather\nor environment, adherence (sp?) to maintenance schedules, whether the car\nhas ever been in an accident, number of different drivers of the same car\nin a family, whether the car is garaged, warmed up, ...\n\nSpiros
In fact, they make some ,but they just don't sell them here in U.S.\n\nSunny California is a 1.6l wagon based on Sentra.\nAvenil is a 2.0l 4WD/2WD wagon .(It looks like Infinity G20 \nbut actually it's independently designed to be a wagon.I mean, it's \nnot based on any sedans.) \n \nNissan had better consider to sell them here.\n\n\n\nSounds nice. But I doubt they have a plan. Coz Avenil was introduced \nto replace any sedan based wagon.
I just visited the NY Auto Show, and saw two LH cars on the floor: Eagle \nVision and Dodge Intrepid. \n\nReally nice I must say. Very attractive styling, lots of features and room, \nat a competitive price.  \n\nUnfortunately, the workmanship is quite disappointing. On BOTH cars,\nthe rubber seals around the window and door fell off. It turns out\nthe seals are just big grooved rubber band. It goes on just by pressing\nthe groove against the tongue on the door frame. Surely it would come\noff easily.\n\nI am not sure how many of this kind of pooring engineering/assembly\nproblems that will show up later.\n\nI may still consider buying it, but only when it establishes a good\ntrack record.
I am interested in finding out how the 4Runner and Pathfinder have\nbeen updated in the past few years.  Like new engine, suspension and\nthe like.

greetings:\n  you may be in luck.  i seem to recall seeing a blurb in one of\nthe kit car magazines about a company in norway who pulled a\nmould (sp?) off a real kubel, and has adapted it to the beetle\nfloorpan.  as for the suspension, all i can remember about the\nvw thing i used to own is that it had about 3" more suspension\ntravel than a stock beetle, but i'd heard that there were after-\nmarket parts for off-road use that were as good or better.  note\nthat the major difference (looks wise) between a kubel & a thing\nare the hood and the fenders.  the kubel had an external spare\nmounted *on* the hood, and the hood sloped down (for visibility?)\nsharply, and had rounded fenders.  the thing has a lightly sloped \nhood with the spare mounted inside (unless moved to make for more\nluggage space...) and has half-hexagon shaped fenders (imagine a\nnut large enough to put a tire *in*, and cut off the bottom half\nof it...).\n  unfortunately, i don't have that info anymore.  try stopping\nat a local bookstore and copying down the phone numbers for the\ntwo big mag's and calling them.  they might be able to get the\nnumber for you (don't forget to calculate the time difference to\nnorway before calling...).\n\nlater,\nkc
Two shots at it: (1) Check the tires again - if you can see the wear bars,\nyou're down to problem area (and some tires pass a penny test between the\nbars - that's no guide at all). Your problem in the wet is call hydroplaning.\nYou may not have enough tread left to channel water out from under the\ntire - so it goes fishy on you as it lifts off the road.\n\n(2) Tires age. In particular, soft tire compounds get harder as you put\nthem thru more heat cycles. Harder compounds don't grip as well as\nsoft ones. Effect is very noticable on tires that get very hot very\noften, such as in competition, but it hits all tires.
This should not be the case if they are at all reputable. Fuel injector \ncleaning is done properly with a can of injector cleaner solvent which is\nhooked up to the fuel system under high pressure. The car is actually run on\nthe solvent during the cleaning process. The equipment to properly do this is\npricey, and generally not something the average home mechanic has. The solvent\nitself is not very expensive ($5-$8) and you could probably make up a hose to\nfit your system and do it yourself, but I didn't tell you that... :-)\n\nNot many in-tank cleaners are worth wasting your money on. There has been a \ndiscussion of these products on here from time to time, and Chevron Techron\n(not Pro-Gard with Techron) is generally regarded as the best. It is, however,\na bit more than $1.29 a bottle. IMHO, it will not substitute for proper\ninjector cleaning if they are really crudded up. You'll have to decide if the\n$59 price is a better deal than spending your time and/or buying equipment to\ndo it.
...\n...\n\nSome other owners on the ford-probe@world.std.com mailing list have commented \nabout this problem, but I haven't seen it happen on my 3 month old \n'93 Probe GT.  I think this may be something that Ford has corrected since \nthe initial batch of cars.  Also, someone said that Ford has issued a \nservice bulletin to inform dealers about how to correct this problem, so you \nmay be able to get your dealer to fix it.\n\n\nHaven't seen any of these problems, nor have I seen these mentioned on the\nmailing list, so these might just be having bad luck with these.\n\n\nDefinitely!\n\n\nNo problems like these either.  I haven't been able to find any obvious \nplaces where they screwed up.\n\n\nHmmm!  I got two keys with my car.  Something tells me you got stiffed by\nyour dealer on this.  (Actually, if you count the "credit card" key that \ncame in the owner's binder, I got 3 keys, but since the credit card key\ndoesn't have any teeth cut in it yet, I guess I won't count it. :-))\n\n\nThe latter is probably because of the air bag.  It's pretty much takes up\nall the space where you'd expect to find the horn.\n\nSpeaking of the horn, I was surprised to find that the Probe comes with one\nof those nice 'merican sounding horns instead of the Japanese sounding kind.\nThe previous Probes had Japanese horns.\n\n\nYeah, not very badly, but enough to be annoying sometimes.\n\n\nI agree strongly with all of the above, especially about the engine.  The\ninterior is very, very nice too.  Very pleasing to the eye, and ergonomically\nsound.\n\n...\n\nYes, this car's stiff suspension isn't for everyone.  I personally like it,\nbut if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car, I'd strongly\nsuggest looking into the MX-6.\n\n\nThe problem with the back seat is that there's no leg room.  Plenty of \nhead room, though.  Shorter people fit back there without any complaints,\nso long as the seat they are sitting behind is pulled forward a bit to \ngive them a place to put their feet.\n\n\nThe power moonroof can greatly improve the ventilation throughout the car. :-)\nI really enjoy the moonroof, by the way, but then I've always been a sucker\nfor open air driving.  No leakage problems or anything like that...yet!\n\n\nI haven't heard about this one.  I know that some of the very early Probes\n('89 and maybe '90) had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers (which\nFord will replace at no charge), but I haven't heard about anything like\nthis concerning the '93 Probes.\n\nI haven't had any real trouble with this car outside of a CV joint boot\nthat was leaking, but the dealer took care of that promptly, and even\ngave me a free rental car for the day and a half that I was without my\ncar.  I was quite happy with the way they handled...especially considering\nthat I was expecting the worst from them!\n\nFrom what I've heard, it sounds like Ford/Mazda had some QC problems with \nthe Probe (and probably MX-6) when they first went into production, but \nI think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point.  That's\nalmost always to be expected with a completely new car like this, though.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n-chuck-

Here is a story.  I bought a car about two weeks ago.  I finally can\nget hold of the previous owner of the car and got all maintanence\nhistory of the car.  In between '91 and '92, the instrument pannel \nof the car has been replaced and the odometer also has been reset\nto zero.  Therefore, the true meter reading is the reading before\nreplacement plus current mileage.  That shows 35000 mile difference\ncomparing to the mileage on the odometer disclosure from.  The \ndealer never told me anything about that important story.\n\nI hope that I can return the car with full refund.  Do u think this\nis possible?  Does anyone have similar experiences?  Any comments\nwill be appreciated.  Thanks.

I won't argue too much about anything.  I am probably one of those that \nthink that we can't have enough safety on the roads.  I would gladly \nsacrifice distractions (as you call it), than someone having trouble seeing\ndanger earlier.  One saved life justifies more than my lifetime of "distractions"\nfor me.\n\n\n\n\n   Problem is that, I may just kill the guy. I agree that I would be at fault,\nand I will have my license revoked, why, I might even go to the gas chamber.\nBut the fact still remains that the guy is dead.  Someone died because I\nwas too stingy to put on my lights. \n\n\n\n\n   The ratio of the probability of fallen trees/rocks on the roads to \noncoming traffic is too low to even be considered.  The difference is also\nworking on what we *know* could happen, to what *might* happen.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Compared to the number of gallons of gas consumed by those 200 million cars,\nit is miniscule! \n\n  Whatever.....  'tis a pity I have to share the same roads with a person\nnot concerned with safety.\n\n-S\nssave@ole.cdac.com
I am interested to know if there is any Pontiac e-mail car clubs out\nthere?  Has anyone started one, or is anybody thinking about starting one.\nThanks for any info you can give me
Wasn't the original intent of the reverse lights for the driver, so he\ncould see where he was backing up???  Although reverse lights on the sides\nare useful for telling whether cars are backing up out perpendicular to the\npath of the car, I don't think warnings were their original intents, since they\nare colored white.
I'd hate to rehash an old thread, but...  Would someone kindly quote\na prices that a dealer quotes for a Civic EX, and Escort GT.  Also, I'm a\nassuming that the MX-3 was the V-6, so go ahead and look that up, too.  If \nsomeone has one of those yearly buyers' guides that give a low quote price,\nplease quote them, too.  Then find the the SC1 base price.\n\nThanks.
You'll have fun looking for the rear-end gears on an SHO--the Taurus\nis a front-wheel-drive vehicle...\n\nI went back and checked the article again; The SHO Wagon is quicker\nthan the SHO automatic, but significantly slower than the REAL SHO.\n\nWhy anyone would order an SHO with an automatic transmission is\nbeyond me; if you can't handle a stick, you should stick with a\nregular Taurus and leave the SHO to real drivers. That is not to\nsay that there aren't real drivers who can't use the stick (eg\ndisabled persons), but they aren't in any position to use an\nSHO anyway. \n\nI would be willing to bet that if we removed the automatic\ntransmissions from all "performance-type" cars (like the 5.0l\nMustangs, Camaros, and the like) we'd cut down on the number of\naccidents each year. Autos are fine for sedate little sedans,\nbut they have no business in performance cars, IMHO.\n\n				James
on wednesday morning, another driver decided to illegally\n		turn left in front of me, doing great damage to my car\n		(Honda Civic).\n		i have yet to pay off the car, and the body shop says the\n		insurance company wants to total the car.  i haven't\n		been able to get in touch with the person handling my claim,\n		so i checked on some things:\n	\n			1) my payout is $3700.00\n			2) Blue Book retail is $5650.00\n			3) loan value is $4450.00\n			4) trade-in value is $4000.00\n\n		could anyone give me any advice on what i should/could do\n		if the insurance company does not give me a reasonable\n		amount for the loss of the car.\n\n				thanks,\n				james baker
not a flame, just a point:  I'd be scared at 130 here, not because i feel\ndrivers who are STUPID.  Like the ones who are doing 130 also, and so\nthey pull in right behind you at maybe 1-2 car lengths....oh yeah, real\nsmart...  This scares me in cities at 50.  When i can't see enough of\nthe car to make it recognizable, they are following TOO CLOSE.  And \nwhen i see them doing this AND reading a newspaper.....*sigh*...this\nis why America has 55-65 speed limits: our drivers are TOO DUMB to realise\nthat reading the paper should be done at breakfast, or work, not in their\ncar.
IS there a simple way tooput these sunroofs out of their misery - \ndo leaks tend to be from old gaskets ?  \nor from inadequate mechanical seals - \nor all of the above ??\n\nis there any way to halt the rain ?\n\nthanks\nhk
It seems sad that people lose all perspective when they here about a\ncase of violence by teenagers...\n\nFor a little perspective:\n\nHow about the thousands of kind teenagers who volunteer at local\nagencies to help children, seniors, the homeless?\n\nDid you read about all the kids at Stanford who spent their spring\nbreaks helping out in inner city areas? What about the hundreds of\nvolunteers ( teenagers and others) who worked to clean up the mess\nafter the Rodney King riots in LA?\n\nHave you gone to your local high school play recently? Attended the\nschool orchestra performances? Have you seen how many kids volunteer\nto pick up trash, plant trees, do walk-a-thons? How many kids have\ntried to sell you stuff to benefit organizations they belong to? How\nmany girl scout cookies have you bought? How many chocolate bars for\ngood causes?\n\nThe media picks up on all the anomalies, the sensational...\n\nWhat about the wonderful teenagers all over the place who work hard at\nschool, get good grades, go to college (or to work) and make a real\ncontribution to our society?\n\nAll humans are teenagers at some time in their lives! Mother Theresa\nwas a teenager and so was Geoffrey Dahmer.\n\nIt is really sad to see so many people who buy the sensational\nreporting of the media as some kind of reflection of the world today!\nIt is a reflection of what is happening on the outer fringes of our\nsociety and nothing more...
I was recently thumbing through the 1993 Lemon-Aid New\nCar Guide.  What I found was a car would be given a 'Recommended'\nunder the picture while a few sentences later noting how a\ndriver and passenger were virtually guaranteed to be killed\nin a front end collision.  The most highly recommended small\ncar (The Civic) has the worst crash rating of all of the small\ncars listed.  There were many such cases of 'great' vehicles\nwhere you wouldn't survive an accident.  Is it only me, or is\nsafety not one of the most important factors when buying a car?
