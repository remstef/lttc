Note: These trial updates are summarized from reports in the\n_Idaho Statesman_ and the local NBC affiliate television\nstation, KTVB Channel 7.\n\nRandy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update: Day 5.\n\nMonday, April 19, 1993 was the fifth day of the trial.\n\nSynopsis: Government informant Kenneth Fadeley testified that\nRandy Weaver sold him two shotguns in violation of the National\nFirearms Act of 1934.  U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge\nasks jurors not to hear accounts of the Waco fire because\nof possible influences on the Weaver/Harris case.\n\nThe testimony of FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton apparently\nended without further incident, as it was mentioned neither\nby KTVB nor the _Idaho Statesman_.\n\nThe day was highlighted by the testimony of Kenneth Fadeley,\nwho had been posing as an outlaw biker and illegal guns person\nnamed Gus Magiosono.  Fadeley testified that he was acting as\nan informant for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms\nin his dealings with Randy Weaver.\n\nFadeley began by stating that he had met Weaver in 1987 at an\nAryan Nations summer conference in Hayden Lake, Idaho.  The two\nthen met again October 11, 1989 (note the huge separation in\ntime) at a restaurant in Sandpoint, Idaho, to begin a weapons\ntransaction.  He stated that Weaver had said, "He felt like he\n(Weaver) was being prepared to do something dangerous for the\nWhite cause."\n\nThe two later met October 24, 1989 behind the restaurant and\nlater went to a city park to make the sale.  During this second\nmeeting, Fadeley was wearing a small recording device to\ntape the conversation.  Weaver allegedly showed him an H&R 12-\ngauge shotgun with a 13-inch barrel and an overall length of\n19.25 inches.  He additionally showed a Remington 12-gauge\nshotgun with a 12.75-inch barrel and an overall length of\n24.5 inches (NFA requires minimums of 18 inches for barrel\nlength and an overall length of 26 inches).  On tape, Weaver\nis reported to have said that he could perform better work once\nhis machine shop is set up.  The two then discuss the possibility\nof future sales.  Fadeley then counts out three hundred dollars\nfor the two guns and promises the balance of one-hundred fifty\ndollars when they next meet.  (Note that the ATF could have\nsimply arrested him here.  Why did they wait until January 1991 -\nover a year later - to arrest him?  This is not explained).\n\nThe next meeting took place on Nov 30, 1989.  Fadeley stated that\nhis "source" had only come up with one hundred dollars instead\nof the one-hundred fifty he'd promised.  At this point, Weaver\nsuspected he was dealing with an informant, "I had a guy in\nSpokane tell me you were bad."  Fadeley managed to convince\nWeaver otherwise.\n\nThe _Idaho Statesman_ states explicitly that three tapes were\nmade of conversations with Randy Weaver.  Thus, each of these\nmeetings must have been recorded.  However, the _Statesman_ also\nreported that a tape of a telephone conversation involving Vicki\nWeaver (Randy Weaver's wife) was played to the court.  There must\nhave also been phone taps.\n\nThese tapes were played to the court via both headphones and\nloudspeakers under the objections of Gerry Spence, Weaver's\nattorney.  Spence said to a KTVB reporter that he wanted to\nmake sure that the government proved its case, "...if it has a\ncase at all..." according to the rules.\n\nRandy Weaver tore off his headphones and wept when he heard his\nwife's voice on the tape.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge asked jurors not to hear\naccounts of the Waco fire because of possible influences on the\nWeaver/Harris case.  Exactly how such information could affect\nthis trial is not explained.\n\nOther notes: Sunday evening there was a report on KTVB concerning\nKevin Harris.  Unnamed agents within the FBI admit that they are\nsurprised that Kevin Harris is still alive.  First, they were\nsurprised that he survived the initial gunshot wound(s) sustained\nin the initial firefight at the Y-junction.  Later, when Randy\nWeaver was struck by sniper fire the sniper had reported that\nHarris had been struck (not Weaver).  Finally, there was a report\nthat the FBI agent who killed Vicki Weaver believed he was aiming\nat Kevin Harris instead.  (This is what was reported).  Critics\nare charging that the FBI was blatantly trying to eliminate the\nonly non-government witness to the deaths of Samuel Weaver and\nDeputy Marshal William Degan.  Some local people believe that\nHarris's survival is simply due to divine intervention.

Hello,\n\n	I understand this philosophy.  The bears are a national\ntreasure, the area is their sanctuary and people who enter it\ndo so at their own risk.  It is better that that rare human be\nkilled by a bear than that bears be provoked or shot by unbear-savvy\nvisitors.  The bears aren't having a population explosion, humans\nare so it is better that a human be killed than endanger the bears.\nI don't agree with this philosopy, but I understand it.\n\n	The psychos are a bit different.  They are not a national\ntreasure but I suppose the decision has been made that to "allow"\nprovision for defense against them would also "allow" provision\nfor defense against bears.  Again, I suppose it has been decided\nthat it is better for the rare human to be killed by a psycho than\nto take a chance on threatening the bears.\n\n	Personally, I wouldn't go into an area where I would be\n"managed" so as to reduce my safety ..... but ... come to think\nof it I guess I live in a managed wilderness myself :-)
Well, actually, the Davidians (Koreshians?) started the fire themselves, \nthe last I heard ( around 15:00 EST). Eight people ran out into the feilds\nsurrounding the compound. All were captured and two admitted to setting the \nfire. I don't buy your napalm theory at all (although it would have made a \ngreat commercial for my .sig). Why the hell would they have a wood stove\nburning on such a warm day?  Flame throwers use liquid petroleum, napalm \nis more of a gel. Now to further dispute your theory, the diluted CS gas\nwas inserted around 06:00 if I understood correctly. The place didn't start\nburning until around 10:00 or 11:00.\n \n \nCalm down kid. Vernon (Koresh's real name) said himself that he would not leave\nthat compound alive. The inhabitants thereof had accepted the fact that they \nmay very well have to kill themselves before it was all over.\n\n\nThere are at least eight survivors. A caller on Rush Limbaugh today suggested\nthat the rest may even be hiding in underground bunkers. That's not such a wild\nidea considering their weaponry and resolve. \n\n\nSheesh! Get over it. I haven't heard (read) such ranting since the Hindenberg\nburned. This should have ended 50 days ago. I'm glad my tax dollars have\nfinally stopped working to pay a bunch of guys to stand around and give press\nconferences. Now they can get back to more important things, like catching\ncigarrette smugglers.
Two questions:\n\n1)  You asserted that both the AR-15 and AK-47 are not suitable for\n   "real hunting".  If you have no problem with hunting, or using\n   self loading rifles for hunting, why did you say this?  If not\n   for deer, then what about other, smaller game?\n\n2)  When did I get the nickname "NRA man"?  Notice I have never referred\n   to you as "Janette" which you don't seem to like.  Do I get any\n   super-powers, like Spider Man or Powdered Toast Man?\n\nScott Kennedy    Brewer, Patriot, and now NRA-Man, defender of Truth,\n                 Justice, and the 2nd Amendment.

As I understand it was considered unsafe for the tv networks to get\nany closer. Surely the networks can judge the risks of reporting\nfor themselves. I haven't noticed CNN being banned from Baghdad\nhotels yet despite the (all too real) risk of having a cruise\nmissile land in the lobby. Incidentally has that ever been explained\nor are we to assume that out of the whole of the city an off-course\nmissile just happened to hit that hotel at a probability of about\n1 in some very large number?\n\nUnsafe for who I wonder?
Which one?  The one yesterday, or has there been another?  If it was yester-\nday, catch up.\n\n  IMO, 90% of all "conspiracy" charges are easily explained by the simple\nfact that in these days of instantaneous news transmission, all kinds of\nstuff gets said when people really just don't know what the hell's going on.\nThen the story changes once the facts are in and suddenly cries of "its all a \nwhitewash!" start.  Naturally, everybody wants to cover his/her ass.\n\n\n  Damnfino.  I just tend to take issue with absolute statements that are ob-\nviously wrong on their face and tend to inflame, not inform.

Also, people would have a need to replace\nguns with something else, perhaps deadly sprays that would make Mace and OC\nseem like water.  They would be lighter and easier to conceal.\n\nGuns are really "old" in design and as long as we have tons of them, no one\nis motivated to design something better.  I'm sure we could come up with\nsome real nasty stuff if we tried and getting rid of these guns would get\nus moving on this track asap.  This is what we really want, right?  Stuff\nthat's smaller, lighter and far more deadly.

If they blast away a few good fokes then that is\n:\n:With the arms build up in Waco they needed to hit that compound with\n:mega fire power. They could of gone in there blasting and killed a few\n\nI hope this is a joke... if not, here's my response:\n\nThe BATF has a history of no-knock raids with poor evidence, often resulting in\ninnocent people being killed or suffering injury to person or property.  I will\nNOT support the BATF until they clean up their act... Maybe...  As to equipment,\nthe BATF has damn near anything it wants...  Their faults were in intelligence\n(military and civilian definitions apply), tactics (attacking during DAYLIGHT??), methodology (the FBI stated that it is against government policy to assault\na position where there are non-combatants/potential hostages without attempting\nnegotiations first), and legality.  The BATF's jurisdiction is TAXES on firearms\nand tobacco.  They are a branch of the department of the treasury.  They have\nvery curiously backed away from their claims of illegal weaponry to push the\nchild-abuse charges... The BATF has no jurisdiction over non-firearms/tobacco\nissues! And the charges of child-abuse had been investigated in the past with\nno violence and no validation.  This was a clear case of first the BATF, then\nthe FBI, having watched too many Rambo movies...  My opinion is that the agent\nin charge should be charged with executing an illegal raid, criminal negligence,\nmurder, civil rights violations, and breaking his/her oath to uphold and defend\nthe Constitution of the US.  The warrant should be unsealed to reveal to the \npublic what justification the BATF thought it had in committing an armed assault\non American citizens.  And while on the issue of investigating this issue,\nthe Randy Weaver case and the Johnny Lawmaster case should be investigated for\nBATF wrongdoing.\n\nJames\n\nbtw, if the BATF came busting in my windows with concussion grenades, you could damn well bet I would return fire to the utmost of my ability.
There are several ways in which one can choose to intrepret any \nconstitutational issue :\n\n   (a) Original intent\n   (b) Subjectively intrepreted accordiong to political whims of the day.\n\nIf we use original intent as the basis for intrepreting the constitution, \nit is clear that the founding fathers intended that the individual citizen \nbe allowed to bear arms similar to those used by soldiers of the day.\n\nFor references, I cite :\n\n  - Federalist papers\n  \n  - "The Embarassing Second Ammendment", Yale Law Review, \n    Prof. Stanford Levinson [sorry, I don't have the date handy]\n\n       Prof Levinson sought to prove that the 2nd ammendment did not\n       convey an individual right, but concluded that it did, hence the \n       "embarassing" in his title.\n \n  - Report of the Subcomittee on the Consititution, United States Sendate,\n    97th Congress, Second Session February 1982.\n\n  - U.S. vs. Verguido Urguidez (Supreme court case in recent years).  \n    Although this case did not pertain to firearms, Justice Rhenquist\n    notes that the term "the people" is a term of art conveying individual\n    rights, and specifically cited several used, 2nd ammentment included,\n    in his opinion.\n\n  - Title 10, U.S. Code.  This states that all males between the ages of\n    18 & 45 not part of the organized militia, and all female officers of\n    the national guard are part of the unorganized militia.
Fret not, you made it.\n\n\nNot while we still have our guns.  <evil grin>  \n\nHey, gang, it's not about duck hunting, or about dark alleys,\nit's about black-clad, helmeted and booted troops storming\nhouses and violating civil rights under color of law. \n\nAre YOU ready to defend YOUR Constitution?
I don't know for sure if Winchester made any commemeratives.  If I\nrecall correctly, the rifle itself was a .44-40 Model 92 with an\noversized loop lever.  I don't think Winchester makes this rifle\nany more.  Rossi make a Model 92 look-alike in .38 Special and\n.357 Magnum.

Dumb move.  \n\n        The smart move would be to sneak in someone with a TV camera\nand video transmitter.
Was THAT your argument.  Well, you didn't make it very well.  You started \nfrom the questionable premise that the fire was necessarily an act of\ninsanity, rather than an act of negligence or an accident.  Recall, one\nsurvivor claims that the fire started when a tank knocked over a kerosene \nlamp.  Kind of makes arguments regarding relative sanity somewhat moot, no?\n\n\n"Nice evasive maneuver, Mr. Chekov, but they're still on our tail."\n\nLet me ask it more plainly.  Which of the above complaints about David \nKoresh's religious or sexual proclivities justified an armed raid by the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms?\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's not entirely far-fetched.  Nobody outside the compound would know \nEVERYBODY inside the compound.  Don't forget, the BATF admits having \nagents inside the compound, in any case.\n\n\nI'm simply being the devil's advocate.  There's reasonable doubt by the\nboatload standing in the way of anybody totally swallowing the official \ngovernment story on Waco.\n--
I don't know how quickly YOU can get a woodstove to heat up from a cold\nstart, but mine takes about three hours.\n\n\nMox nix.  The BD's were prepared to provide their own heat and light,\nand were doing so for weeks while the power was out.  That means the\ncompound contained containers of flammable liquids or gases (that could\nbe busted by a tank intrusion), plus ignition sources, which no one can \ntell for sure were all off at the time.\n\n\nOn the contrary.  We are proposing alternate scenarios.  The people who\nare coming to wild conclusions are the feds, who are absolutely positive\nhow the fire started, even though none of them were in a position to \nsee it, either (and the stories they "hear" from their prisoners changes\nhourly).\n--
In Texas, it is legal to carry handguns while "traveling", and also to and from\nsporting activities.           ^^^^^^^^\n\nChapter 46 of the Texas State Penal Code does NOT restrict long guns.\nTherefore, it is legal to carry and transport long guns any place in Texas.
It's not the NRA's fault; but it is something to consider if you are\nconsidering contributing to the NRA. If candidate B is a complete asshole\nwhose only saving grace is that he opposes unnecessary restrictions on\nfirearms, I wouldn't want my membership dues funding efforts to get him\nre-elected.\n\n     I have other problems with the NRA (as an organization; the individual\nmembers I've met have been loyal, trustworthy, honest, brave, etc.,\nespecially my boss who probably reads this newsgroup B->); they are\ndefinitely pro-hunting, and I recall seeing a pro-Desert Storm NRA bumper\nsticker. Sometimes they come on too strong in the political arena, which\ncontributes to their reputation as "bad guys" amoung many people.
No, you merely have to start working on yellowcake or else\ndevise a system to get it from other sources.  BTW: the DOE handles\nreactor fuel, and merely leases it to reactors.  The NRC certifies these\nreactors.  The military have their own sources.  A private citizen has\nnone of these official sources.\n\n\n	That's freshman-level chemistry.  Big deal.  Can you make it\nwork?  That's PhD-level physics.  Big difference.\n\n\n	So you admit that there's no law that could stop you?  Physics\naside, could you make one if you had the funds and time?  The answer\nis yes.  So, do we lock you up now because of this?  Surely you can\nsee where the comparison with anti-gun laws comes into play here?\n\n\n	Precisely why it's not as readily utilized as you seem to have\nbeen lead to believe.  BTW: 98% U235 is far better for home-made bombs\nthan trying to use plutonium.  The laws of physics make the creation of\na device without serious manufacturing facilities very low in probability.

For those of you interested, I just finished talking with a \nrepresentative of Senator Bob Krueger's reelection campaign about his \nposition on the RTKBA.  Krueger was appointed by the  Democratic Governor \nof Texas to complete Lloyd Bentsen's unexpired term.\n\nThe representative said that Senator Krueger did not have a position and \nwould only comment on specific legislation that was pending.  No comment \nwas available on the various versions of the Brady Bill.
Even if they outlawed private posession of firearms, there would be no moral\nforce behind that law; I imagine compliance would be low.
Minor quibble:  The assualt (and it was one) began near dawn.  The fire did\nnot break out for several hours.  I find it highly unlikely that the BD would\nbe cooking lunch while armored vehicles punch holes in their house and are\npumping in tear gas.  The lantern story makes more sense, except the fire \nseemed to spread too quickly, even given the nature of the buildings and the\nvery high winds.  And it was daylight, but I guess in the innner recesses it\ncould be dark--shutters probably closed as well.\n\n  Which puts us back to the FBI did it, or the BD did it, or some other screw-\nup occured, which is quite possible.\n\n  The problem with the FBI as a monolithic entity doing it is that it requires\n*everybody* involved to keep their mouths shut.  While they tended to behave \nlike total idiots, that does not make them homocidal maniacs, either.  And if\nit was one nutcase agent, then it serves no purpose to blame the whole agency.\n\n  I can believe that a real nut-case like a Koresh would start such a fire,\nbut I'm far from convinced he actually did so.\n\n  Then again, I rarely go off making blanket condemnations and pronouncments\nwithin 2 hours of a very confusing incident over 175 miles away...\n\nsemper fi,
I guess what I am really asking, like I did above, how does my government\nwho is my servent, tell me the soveriegn what I can or cannot possess?\n\nIt would seem to me that the act of possessing a machine gun is no less\n"criminal", by definition, than the act of possessing a television set. I also would seem\nto me that it would be better to pass laws that say, that if I harm\nor kill someone with the machine gun or the television set that there \nwould be specific penalties for doing such. \n\n\nSorry, I was close.

Well, like someone said in a reply to this it really all depends on the area\nthat you live in.  See David Veal's reply to this.  I have heard exactly the\nsame thing that he said in his reply - to fade away if you think that you\nhaven't been seen (I heard this from a police officer).  For the record though\nhe was talking about in Tennessee - not everywhere.
I'm afraid he isn't.  They are a hypocritical lot.
Preliminary data regarding similar research into kangaroo overpopulation\nin Australia do not in any way support the cost-effectiveness of this\napproach.  It _may_ be cost-effective for deer--if you quietly overlook\nthe fact that the net cost to the state of deer hunting is _negative_\n(i.e. a profit) because the (majority of) hunters pay for licences.\nThe cost comparisons are probably being done assuming that people have\nto be employed to cull the animals, which is not in fact the case.\nYou figure people are going to pay for licences to implant contraceptive\npellets or spread baits?\n\nThere has been a fair bit of discussion about this here recently,\nbecause the kangaroo population in the grounds of the Governor-\nGeneral's residence has now reached plague proportions.  Despite the\nwhines of the rampant animal-libbers, the most effective method of\ncontrolling the population is still considered to be controlled\nshooting.\n\n\nSome people take satisfaction (IMHO, legitimate satisfaction) in eating\nfood that they have harvested themselves.  The pleasure derived from\nhunting is the same as that you get from eating fruit and vegetables\ngrown in your own garden (and, in general, game meat is probably much \nfreer of unpleasant chemicals than what you buy from the butcher or\nthe supermarket).\n\n\nBy "cannot now be justified" I guess you mean that you personally\ndon't see any justification.  Fine--but what makes your opinion\nso important?\n\n\nCertainly the last point is correct.  If politicians don't see any\nvotes for themselves in opposing stupid legislation or in developing\nand supporting measures which might be effective in reducing the \nincidence of violent crime they won't do these things.

If you want to talk "less likely to get killed with a handgun"\nyou'd have a point.  "Safer" includes other things than simply handguns,\nand you can't conclude "safer" by ignoring them.\n\n       Now if somebody's got the total homicide rates...
As I'm sure others will have pointed out to you by now, none of the above\nmeasures are required for you *on your own property*.  You do not have to\nhave a license, your car does not have to be registered or inspected, and\nyou do not have to have insurance or safety training classes, when you own\nand operate that vehicle on your own premises.  If you are going to make use\nof this dubious analogy, at least make it accurate.  And by the way, in Texas\nyou can drive a car in public (with the proper credentials), but an ordinary\ncivilian can't carry a gun legally in public to save his/her life.\n\nSo I won't even consider registration, *manadatory* safety classes, or\n*manadatory* liability insurance unless I get a federal law repealing\nall local, state, and federal gun control laws which abridge the Second\nAmendment, and a non-discretionary federal weapons carry permit, good\nanywhere in the United States.  Come on, you wanted the analogy.\n\n\nMike Ruff

The point that I forgot to bring up here (and this has nothing to do with being\na gang member or not) is that it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon in this\narea (or in the state of illinois for that matter).  This is not to say that\npeople in Illinois don't carry concealed weapons illegaly but practicing like\nthat when there are other people around wasn't too bright of an idea.\n\n\nI agree.      If you don't practice at all and carry a gun for self-defense you\nmost likely would be in big trouble if a situation were to arise.

Well the attorneys of the Davidians reported on Larry King that\nthe tanks had actually damaged the structure to the extent that\neffectuating egress from the building was difficult at best.\nWith a rapidly spreading fire and large amounts of smoke and\ntear gas, finding the right exits, or acceptible holes in the walls\nwere nearly impossible.  I find this explanation to be completely \nplausible.  Doesn't mean that it's true, but I don't find it\nintrinsically less believable than the government stories.\n\n\n\nI concur.\n\n\nIndeed.  According to the lawyers, the Davidian survivors say that\nlanterns were knocked over during the "probing" and that's how\nthe fire started.  A tragic accident, if true.\n\n\n\nSee above.  This one is going to be thoroughly investigated.  Maybe\nwe'll eventually get some idea of what happened.

In Texas, you cannot carry a handgun.  Period.  Either concealed or open.\nAnd your numbers are misleading; they include suicides and accidents.  The\nreal number from the Department of Public Safety:\n\n                   Murders, Non-neg hom		Car fatalities\n1991			2651			  3079\n1992			2240			  3057\n\nTexas only has "liberal" gun laws as far as purchasing a firearm; aside \nfrom that, it's probably more restrictive than most states as far as carry\ngoes.\n\n\n\nThe state was Virginia, and the law passed.\n\n\nThat right only inflicts on those who threaten my rights to life,\nliberty, the pursuit of happiness, etc., in the first place.  I am not\na criminal, and I don't indiscriminately fire my weapons at random.  \nSo please explain how I am "inflicting" anything on other people.
Though I agree this is not the place to discuss guns, I note in passing that\na number of gun apologists seem to have ignored the words "well regulated"\nin their distorted interpretations of the Second Amendment.\n\nDavid
Actually not Jim.  I just said that everyone else seemed to have skimmed by\nthat part and not mentioned it.  You can get whatever meaning you want from it.
They do. According the the Los Angeles Police Department, illegal\nmanufacture is one the three primary sources of machine guns and\nsubmachine guns used in crimes (sumggling and theft from the\npolice and military being the other two.) Washington D.C. police\nhave stated that 40% (If I'm remembering the figure correctly) of\nthe guns they conficate were illegally built.\n\n\nIt takes about 6 hours and a few tools to make one (at least one\nof reasonable quality). Unless the drug dealer enjoyes messing\naround on a lathe (say, as a hobby), he's going to have to \npay someone anyway. Materials plus six hours of a machinist's\ntime for something legal would run about $100. The blackmarket\nprices for guns are usually in the $50 to $200 range (at least\nthose few I've seen cited in newspaper articles were...)\n\n\nWashington D.C. has a total ban on handguns and prohibits assembled\nrifles within city limits. It's homicide rate is almost ten\ntimes the national average. It is also illegal for a D.C.\nresident to drive to the Virginia or Maryland suburbs and\nbuy a gun (dealers are required by federal law to check IDs\nand make sure the buyer isn't from another state) so the ban \ncan not be easily side-stepped.\n\n\nSure. But it you couldn't buy one, you would write your own (in\nfact, people _did_ write their own 15 years ago...) More likely,\nyou would find a friend who was a particularly good programer\nand get him give you a copy of his. Software is a _very_ bad\nexample for your case: How many people do you know with illegal\ncopies of $400 word processors? If people want something, and\nit isn't available (or affordable) legally, they will usually\nget it illegally.\n\n\nQuite.\n\n\n13-3-2. The formula has been around for half a million years.\nOr are you going to restrict sales of sulpher, charcoal and\nsaltpeter? That's alot cruder than modern smokless powder, but\nit works very well. The only real problems are a ~25% reduction\nin energy (so a .357 magnum would "only" be as deadly as a 9mm)\nand it makes alot more smoke... Of course, a smart black marketeer\ncould just make the gun in 9mm and steal the ammunition from the\npolice (the police are often corruptable, and things are known\nto disappear from police evidence rooms and armories and\nreappear on the streets...)\n\n\nPerhaps you weren't watching the news two years ago, but the Serbs \nalso tried to invade Slovinia. They were driven out after a few\nweeks by partisans armed with home-made _anti-tank_ weapons.\nThe Afghan rebels frequently made their own rifles.
Would *you* have come out if you knew the only national TV\ncameras were well over a mile away, and yet the agents with the guns\nwere only a few yards away?  They had contact with a lawyer, so I\nam inclined to believe they had an idea of what their situation\nactually was.  This also leads to the conspiracy theory that the\nlawyer had the BATF pinned on rights violations if the BD's\nacted as witnesses, hence the arson.  I doubt that one too, but\nit is still quite clear that leaving a safe place to surrender is\na rather stupid thing to do until that place is no longer safe.\n\n\n	As a matter of course, given how they've allowed no other\nviews to be heard.  I'll reserve judgement until the trial, but so\nfar as the FBI is concerned their statements carry the same amount\nof weight as photons at rest.\n\n\n	Ludicrous, yes.  Possible, yes.  Plausible?  Get the jury.\n\n\n	That's what gets me too.  It is likely the cult members were\nholed up in an enforced place inside the building.  With a decent arson\nattempt I suspect many of them could have been trapped.  In addition,\nthe introduction of CS gas for several hours would have rendered many\nof them immobile if not unconscious when their masks quit.  All the props\nare there, but proving what scene was played is difficult.  The only\ncertainty is that the FBI and BATF have few witnesses against them.
[stuff deleted]\n\n\nAh, clarification by obfuscation.\n\nActually, the words "A well regulated Milita, being necessary to the\nsecurity of a free state" is a present participle, used as an\nadjective to modify 'militia', which is followed by the main clause of\nthe sentence, the subject being 'the right', the verb 'shall'.  It\nasserts that the right to keep and bear arms is essential for\nmaintaining a milita.  The sentence doesn't restrict the right, or\nstate or imply possession of the right by anyone or anything other\nthan the people.  All it does is make a positive statement regarding a\nright of the people. The PEOPLE, as in you and me, as in the First,\nFourth, Ninth, Tenth, as well as the Second amendment.\nThe existence of this right is assumed - it is not granted by the\namendment. There is no stated or implied condition relating the right\nto bear arms to the necessity of a well-regulated militia to the security of\na free state.\nIn other words, the entire sentence says that the right to keep and\nbear arms is UNCONDITIONAL.\n\n\n\nThe final word on liberties and rights should not belong "to the\nmany".  That is why we have a Constitution.  Otherwise, a tyrrany of\nthe majority can ensue from "popular" opinion, a concept which you\nshould be familiar with from the Federalist papers.
re: is "John Q. Public with a gun" protected?\n\n\n\n\nMiller was convicted of owning a sawed-off shotgun and not paying the\nNFA '34 tax.  Snatches of the court's decision:\n\nThe Second Amendment was intended to "assure the continuation and render \npossible the effectiveness of such a force [the militia]... It must be \ninterpreted and applied with that end in view."\n\nThe militia includes "all males physically capable of acting in concert \nfor the common defense."\n\nHowever, regarding sawed-off shotguns, "certainly it is not within \njudicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military \nequipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense."\n\n"Judicial notice" is the term of art here -- it meant that no such\nevidence had been formally presented.  This is different from claiming\nthat they had ruled that it wasn't.\n\n\nI'm not talking about plain shotguns in war -- I'm talking about short-\nbarrelled ("sawed-off") shotguns in war.\n\nCompare Revolutionary War blunderbusses; luparas in the Spanish-American \nWar; and trench-cleaners in WW I.  They were also put to good use by\nUS soldiers in WW II, not to mention being invaluable to "tunnel rats" \nin Vietnam, but, of course, "Miller" took place in 1939.\n\n\nHere is my quandary:  you seem to be arguing that certain types of \nguns fall outside the scope of the Second.  This isn't a useful argument \nunless you believe that some significant gun or class of gun belongs\nin that class.  \n\nI think we both agree that zip guns probably aren't protected.  Maybe \nwe also both agree that all the weapons that random state governments \nhave been banning or trying to ban because they have "no sporting purpose" \nand "no provate citizen would ever need these guns" DO fall under the \nprotection of the Second.  \n\nSo, given that damn near any gun of any practical utility is or has at \nsome time been used by the military, even if only for marksmanship \ntraining purposes, I need to understand why you are intent on pressing \nthis point, arguing that that SOMETHING is not protected by the Second.\n\n\nOften, what makes someone unpopular is what other people say about him.\nHow much did any of us fear or abhor the Branch Davidians six months ago?\nHow many of us feared or abhorred Saddam Hussein five years ago?\n--

Finger pointing across the Atlanticis a waste or time.\n\n\n       Canada has been blaming the U.S. for their problems for years.\nThe simple fact of the matter is this:  Ten years ago they crowed about\nhow great their system was because they'd gotten rid of the guns and\nthe U.S. would be so much better if they'd just get into the divine light\nshining from the North.  We pointed out that it was cultural differences,\nand pointed to their pre-control crime rates.  We also pointed out that\nthe history of the entire world contained smuggling, and that whenever\nsomething was wanted, it was smuggled in.\n       If the problem were based on U.S. guns, it would have surfaced\nyears before.\n\n       Now more Canadian criminals want guns.  And they are being provided.\nCanada has its own version of the drug problem.  Yet drugs are prohibited\nin the U.S.\n\n\n       Saw a news report out of Britain that armed crime is on the rise,\nand several police agencies are considering have permanent "firearms\nofficers" to deal with it.\n\n       According to U.S. News & World Report, British handgun deaths have\nrisen over 250% over the past twelve years.  The U.S. number has dropped\n5%.\n\n       Maybe they're smuggling them across the U.S./U.K. border.  Yeah,\nthat's the ticket.\n\n\n       Have a nice day, Steve.

Hmm.  I beg to differ.  It will probably make a big difference at some\npoint.\n\n\nThankfully, it is true that the majority go through life without\nhaving to use a firearm.  Howver, there are situations where firearms\nare the most effective means of self protection.  What other means do\nyou propose as equally effective?\n\n\n\nNew to this country? New to political theory?\nAlas, I was speaking of principle.  Without principle, all attempts at\nrepublican forms of gov't are futile.  There are times when public and\npolitical opinion are contrary to principle, which is why we have a\nConstitution which enumerates gov't powers and presumes certain\nrights.  A major reason for this was to prevent a tyranny of the\nmajority.\n\n\nThis is exactly why law should be based on reasoned thought, not\nimmediate perception.  Of course, it doesn't always work that way.\nFortunately, while there are no guarantees, logic sometimes does\nprevail.  And, if not, there are still means for correction.  \nAs far as "enough active voters" are concerned, that is still\nan open question until the vote is made.\n\n\nYou portray a possible scenario for the future.  But, how will you\nsilence RKBA supporters right now?  As long as public debate is\nallowed, such debate will continue. If we allow public debate to be\nrestricted or denied, then we will get a gov't we deserve.

Yes, I am pro-gun, and yes, I do disagree with this statement.\nNuclear weapons in and of themselves are dangerous.  Radioactive\ndecay of plutonium and uranium, as well as the tritium in the\nweapon, tends to be somewhat dangerous to living things.\n(Can you say "neutron flux"?)  Plus these things have no self-\ndefense purposes.  It's kinda hard to justify their use as\na militia weapon when at best they are meant for battlefield use\n(low-yield weapons) or at worst for industrial target obliteration\n(translation:  cities and population centers).  Not to mention that\nfor it to be used as a militia weapon and expect the user to live\nrequires some sort of launch vehicle . . .

Excerpts from netnews.talk.politics.guns: 18-Apr-93 2ND AMENDMENT DEAD -\nGOOD ! by jrm@gnv.ifas.ufl.edu \n\nexcerpted from a letter I wrote a while ago:\n\n     Although less apparent to those who have not researched\nthe facts, personal protection is as legitimate a reason  as\nsport for the private citizen to own a gun.  The most recent\nresearch  is  that  of Dr. Gary Kleck of the  Florida  State\nUniversity  School of Criminology.1  He found that  handguns\nare  more  often  used by victims to defeat  crime  than  by\ncriminals to commit it (645,000 vs. 580,000 respectively  in\nthis  study).  These figures are even more encouraging  when\nyou  consider the number of crimes that never occur  because\nof  the  presence  of a gun in the hands  of  a  law-abiding\nprivate  citizen.  In a National Institute of Justice  study\nof  ten state prisons across the country they found that 39%\nof  the  felons  surveyed had aborted  at  least  one  crime\nbecause  they believed that the intended victim was  armed.,\nand  57% agreed that "most criminals are more worried  about\nmeeting an armed victim than they are about running into the\npolice."2\n     One  of the most heinous of crimes is that against  the\nwomen  of  this country.  It has been my recent  observation\nthat  more  women  are purchasing handguns  for  defense  in\nresponse  to  the  present danger of these  assaults.   This\nshould be taken as encouraging news if the events of Orlando\nFlorida  are any indicator.  In the late 1960's  the  female\npopulace was plagued with a series of brutal assaults;  just\nthe  publicity of the record number of women buying guns and\nobtaining training resulted in an 88% decrease in  rape  for\nthat  area,  the  only city of its size in  the  country  to\nexperience a decrease of crime for that year.  Additionally,\na 1979 US Justice Department study of 32,000 attempted rapes\nshowed  that overall, when rape is attempted, the completion\nrate  is 36%. But when a woman defends herself with  a  gun,\nthe completion rate drops to 3%.\n \n1 G Kleck, Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America Aldine\nde Gruyter, NY, 1991\n2 JD Wright & PH Rossi Armed and Considered Dangerous:  A\nSurvey of Felons and Their Firearms, Aldine de Gruyter, NY,\n1986\n-------\n\n__________________________________________________________________________\n[unlike cats] dogs NEVER scratch you when you wash them.

I'd hardly call that "giving up his chance to be Vice President of the US";\nthe chance of the Populist Party ticket winning is essentially nil.  Still,\nit does imply that he doesn't want to be associated with Duke.
Yeah, me.  Both the Slickmeister and Hillary's buddy Janet say\nthey're responsible... I want both their resignations on my desk \nyesterday.  I also want both thier butts up on federal civil rights\nviolations.... something which carries life in prison as a penalty.\n\nOh, and I'll contribute $20 to Arlen Specter's presidential campaign\nfor having the 'nads to launch the Senate investigation.
...the question is: for how long? Even if the FBI had done nothing, I guess the \nBDs would have committed suicide, but maybe not until hunger and thirst gave them\nthe choice between sucide or surrender. \nThe BDs was warned in beforehand about the FBI action. They HAD the chance to\nsurrender and get a fair trial. No matter who started the fire, the BDs were \nresponsible for 80+ peole dying. No one else.
Not to mention that the story was rewritten today. Those two BD's who\n"admitted to starting the fire", forget 'em, they don't exist anyone.\nToday, "a few saw someone starting a fire" and "our aerial surveillance\nshowed them starting fires" at this morning's press conference. \nTomorrow, even this excuse may evaporate. A reporter pointed out\nthat a BD being brought to arraingement shouted that tanks knocking\nover lanterns started the fire. Curiouser and curiouser.
Well put, Jim.  I am as concerned about the media's complicity in this\ngrowing coverup.  Can you imagine the media outrage, the lawsuits, the\ninvestigations that would emit if the government kept the media away from\nany other story?  Particularly if a Republican administration had been\nbehind it.  What's going on here?\n\nLet's look beyond the initial blunder and examine what happened next.\nI'm a student of human phychology, particularly in the area of psy-ops\nbecause I've found some of the techniques to be useful in business\nnegotiations.  That puts me firmly in the amateur ranks.  This AMATEUR\nknows that the first thing to do when sizing up the opponent is to do a\npsychological profile on him.  You can bet your ass the FBI had\nprofessionally done profiles on Koresh.  Koresh's behavior was\nemminently predictable.  It is typical of people who move away from\ncivilization to be willing to fight to the death to preserve their\nisolation.  It would also be typical, given Koresh's religious\norientation, for such an individual to interpret a government assault as\nthe apocalypse.  Suicide is as an acceptable alternative to being\nconsumed in the apocalypse.\n\nIMHO, the FBI knew all this and decided after 50 days of concentrated\npsy-ops to initiate that apocalypse.  I believe they chose a course of\naction designed specifically to push Koresh over the edge while publicly\nappearing to be acting reasonably.  They KNEW that Koresh considered the\ntanks to be the Chariots of Fire mentioned in the Book of Revelations.\nThey KNEW that sending tanks, oops, combat engineering vehicles,\nobstensibly to perform "gas insertions" (love that NewSpeak) WOULD push\nhim over the edge.\n\nLook at some supporting evidence.  Koresh's attorney mentioned on TV\nearlier today (4/20) that one of Koresh's major concern was the biblical\nrole of the tanks stationed around the compound.  The FBI (through Reno\non Larry King last night and at the news conference this morning)\nclaimed to have listening devices in the compound.  If that was true\nthey KNEW their actions were driving him to the brink.  They KNEW they\nwere pushing the Davidians toward mass suicide.  Any rational and\nreasonable agency NOT interested in killing those people would, at\nthe first sign of preparations for suicide, have pulled completely back and\nwould have gotten rid of all the armor.  Instead they continued with the\n"gas insertion" right up to the point where flames appeared.  The image\nthat will remain etched in my mind is that of the tank strutting back\nand forth in front of the burning compound, gloating over the kill.\n\nLet's step back and assess how this thing could have been ended without\nbloodshed.  This technique would have required a law enforcement agency\ninterested in constitutionally enforcing the law and in the preservation\nof life instead of achieving a military victory and of vengence.\n\nThe way to have nabbed Koresh was simply to have announced a pull back,\nabandoned the assault, torn down the concertina wire and removed the\narmor, maintained covert surveillance of the compound and then exploited\nhis ego to flush him out.  Exploiting his ego would have been simple.  A\nsimple invite or two from the tabloid talk shows to come on TV and tell\nhow he whipped the US government would have been something he could not\nhave resisted.  He could have then been nabbed when he left the\ncompound.  Simple, clean and safe but because it would have required the\nFBI to execute a tactical retreat and would have deprived them of the\nrevenge they sought, it was totally out of the question.  Not without\nall that testesterone floating around.  After all Jannet Reno had to\nshow the world how big her balls are.\n\nYesterday was a sad, sad day for the American system.  I am sick to my \nvery soul.\n\nJohn
I believe we still remember Masada, where Jews killed themselves rather\nthan being captured by the Romans.  While I do not agree with the\nDavidians, I must admire their willingness to die for what they \nbelieved, which Jews have had to do often.
Having lived, played, and worked on and near the Navajo reservation\nfor a number of years, I can confirm this is an ancient pattern,\nfound in petroglyphs dated 800 to 1200 years old.\n\nAlso, the Indians never stopped making rugs with this pattern - they\njust stopped selling them after the Nazi's pre-empted the swastika.\n\nNote also that the Indian versions use both clockwise and\ncounter-clockwise swastikas.\n\nOb guns:  It's the rare Navaho family that doesn't own a rifle. \nThey remember being "relocated" by the US Army, and don't intend to\ndo it again.  The Hopi, on the other hand, have a dislike for\nweapons, from my experience.  Perhaps they just hide them better\nfrom strangers.
----------------------------------------------------------------------\nOpen letter by Dr. Paul H. Blackman, Research Coordinator for\nNRA-ILA. NRA Official Journal 1/89.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDear sir:\n\nBy now, we are used to the New England Journal of Medicine's publication\nof small-scale studies related to firearms from which conclusions are\ndrawn which are quantum leaps from the data, followed by announcements of \nmomentus "scientific" findings. These are regularly released to the press\nwithout the caveats which riddle the conclusory paragraphs, and\noften accompanied by an editorial calling attention to the findings.\nGenerally, while they at least present a few interesting data, however\nmeaningless, the studies misinterpret statistics, and ignore or belittle\nserious studies by criminologists.\n\nThe latest effort -- "Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults, and Homicide:\nA Tale of Two Cities," by J.H. Sloan, et al., with the accompanying \neditorial, "Firearms Injuries: A Call for Science," by two employees\nof the Centers for Disease Control (November 10), however, is an insult\nto the intelligence of any serious scholar in any field and have so few\ndata and so many flaws that I feel compelled to write at some length\nto call attention to various major and minor failings, in no particular\norder.\n\n	1. The authors misleadingly cite Wright, et al. (Ref. 1) to \n	support the statement that "some have argued that restricting\n	access to handguns could substantially reduce our annual rate\n	of homicide." Wright, et al., in fact studied and rejected that\n	contention.\n	\n	2. The authors pretended that Vancouver and Seattle are very\n	similar cities with similar economic circumstances, histories,\n	demographic characteristics, and the like. In fact, the cities\n	are very different with very different demographic characteristics\n	which appear to explain completely the higher homicide rate in\n	Seattle. Both cities are over three-forths non-Hispanic white\n	and *the non-Hispanic white homicide rates are reported to be\n	the same in Seattle and Vancouver*. It is the different back-\n	grounds, problems, circumstances, and behaviors of the various\n	ethnic minorities which explain the difference in homicide.\n	\n	3. The authors pretend they are evaluating Canada's gun law,\n	compared to Washington State's. But they do not examine at all\n	the situation in Vancouver prior to the gun law taking effect\n	in 1978. As it happens, in the three years prior to that (1975-\n	1977), Vancouver averaged 23 homicides per year, one-eighth\n	involving handguns, (Ref. 2) and in the seven years of the NEJM\n	article there were 29 homicides per year, one-eigth involving\n	handguns. Surely even the medical profession recognizes that\n	one must look to see the prior situation was before concluding\n	that a change made a difference? Would a physician conclude that\n	a patient was benefiting from eating oat bran muffin each day\n	for seven years because his cholesterol level was 200 without\n	at least seeing if it was 180 before he started the regimen?\n	\n	4. The authors pick two medium-sized cities to evaluate a national\n	gun law. Nothing can be learned from such a tiny and arbitrarily\n	selected sample. Seattle appears to have been selected because\n	it was convienient for the authors rather than for any scientific\n	reason. Would physicians call something a scientific study which\n	involved one experimental subject and one dissimilar "control"?\n	Had different arbitrarily selected cities been chosen, opposite\n	"scientific" conclusions would follow: Vancouver's homicide\n	rate *exceeds* that of such "wild west" cities in Texas as\n	El Paso, Corpus Christi, Austen, and, in Colorado, Colorado\n	Springs. (Ref. 3)\n	\n	5. The authors fail to clearly demonstrate that firearms or\n	handguns "are far more commonly owned in Seattle than in\n	Vancouver." They use two surrogate approaches in pretending\n	to study the availability of firearms/handguns. The first is\n	an apples-and-oranges effort to compare the number of carry\n	permits in Seattle to the number of registered handguns in\n	Vancouver. But the number clearly understates the number of\n	handguns in Seattle, and counts primarily *protective* handgun\n	owners. The second, however, tells nothing about the number\n	of handguns in Vancouver, and counts *non-protective* handguns\n	for the most part. Where is it difficult to obtain handguns\n	legally for protection, registration figures are\n	meaningless. There are 66,000 registered handguns in New York\n	City (New York Daily News, Sept. 27, 1987). Comparing the two,\n	that method suggests about 930 handguns per 100,000 population\n	in New York City compared to 960 in Vancouver, meaning Vancouver\n	has a greater "prevalence of weapons" than New York City.\n	\n	The second method of measuring gun density is "Cook's gun\n	prevalence index, a previously validated measure of intercity\n	differences." But the validation was by Cook of his own\n	theory. (Ref. 4) Normally, second opinions are sought from a\n	different doctor. More significantly, the Cook index is\n	based on the average of the percentage of firearms involvement\n	in suicide and homicide. So the authors are basically taking\n	a measure of misuse. Unsurprisingly, gun misuse in homicide\n	(42% in Seattle, 14% in Vancouver) is related to gun misuse in\n	homicide plus suicide, divided by two (41% in Seattle, 12% in\n	Vancouver). The authors are not measuring the relative avail-\n	ability of firearms, or of handguns, in Seattle and\n	Vancouver.\n	\n	6. The authors misstate the laws of both Washington and\n	Canada. They neglect to mention the significant fact that\n	Washington has a waiting period and background check prior to\n	the purchase of a handgun, and that provisions exist in Canadian\n	law for owning and carrying handguns for personal\n	protection. The authors also make it appear that it is more\n	difficult to get a handgun legally in Canada than is actually\n	the case.\n	\n	7. The authors ignore all other factors which might explain\n	the differences in crime rate, beyond some vague mention of the\n	penalities provided by law and the roughest of estimates of \n	clearence for one particular offense -- homicide involving a\n	firearm. There is no measure of: the differences in the number\n	of law enforcement officers; their aggressiveness in making\n	arrests for gun law violations in the two jurisdictions; arrest\n	rates for other offenses; conviction rates; actual sentences\n	imposed for gun-related crimes, violent crimes without guns,\n	or gun law violations; or incarceration rates. Whereas social\n	scientists would attempt to measure and hold for such differences,\n	the authors of the NEJM "tale of two cities" fail even to mention\n	most factors related to crime control.\n	\n	8. The authors dismiss claims that handguns are an effective\n	means for protection unless the criminal is killed. Such is not\n	the case. Criminologists (Ref. 5-8) have found that almost\n	650,000 Americans annually use handguns for protection from\n	criminals, and that using a gun for protection reduces the\n	liklihood that a crime -- rape, robbery, assault -- will be\n	completed by the criminal and reduces the likelihood of injury\n	to the victim. It is interesting, nonetheless, that the authors\n	reported the same number (four) of civilian justifiable homicides\n	without firearms in each city but that less restrictive Seattle\n	accounted for 100% of the reported civilian justifiable homicides\n	involving firearms.\n	\n	9. The Centers for Disease Control, which funded the "study,"\n	editorially praised the paper, (Ref. 9) saying it "applied\n	scientific methods to examine a focus of contention betweeb\n	advocates of stricter regulation of firearms, particularly\n	handguns." There is nothing in the paper which could possibly\n	be mistaken for "scientific methods" by a sociologists or\n	criminologists. The Vancouver-Seattle "study" is the equivolent\n	of testing an experimental drug to control hypertension by finding\n	two ordinary-looking middle-class white males, one aged 25\n	and the other 40, and without first taking their vital signs,\n	administering the experimental drug to the 25-year-old while\n	giving the 40-year-old a placebo, then taking their blood pressure\n	and, on finding the younger man had a lower blood pressure, \n	announcing in a "special article" a new medical breakthrough.\n	It would be nice to think that such a "study" would neither be\n	funded by the CDC or printed by the NEJM.\n	\n	Since the longstanding anti-gun biases of the NEJM and the CDC\n	make them willing to present shoddy research as "scientific\n	breakthroughs" in "special articles" and editorials relating\n	to firearms, we are obligated to correct the record by notifying\n	the news media and those with congressional and executive oversight\n	over the activities of the Centers for Disease Control about\n	the distortions contained in "Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults,\n	and Homicides: A Tale of Two Cities" and "Firearm Injuries: A Call\n	for Science." Clearly, all scientific standards go by the wayside\n	whenever the CDC and the New England Journal of Medicine seize\n	an opportunity to attack firearms ownership in America.\n	\n				REFERENCES\n\n1.

Wright\n          (from July 1989 issue of REASON, Free Minds & Free Markets)\n\n   suggestive, but what they conceal is vital."  The problem is demonstrated\n   by the most recent entry in a long line of scientific research purporting\n   to show a causal link between gun availability and homicide.  Funded by\n   the federal government and published last year in the New England Journal\n   of Medicine, the study compared homicide rates in Seattle and Vancouver and\n   suggested that a handgun ban "may reduce the rate of homicide in a \n   community."\n      The nine medical doctors who published "Handgun Regulations, Crime,\n   Assaults, and Homicide" essentially reasoned in three steps: (1) Despite\n   many historical, social, and demographic similarities, (2) Vancouver\n   has a markedly lower homicide rate (3) because its stricter gun regulations\n   make guns less available.  The second step in their reasoning seems\n   indisputable.  The overall homicide rate in Seattle (for the period\n   1980-86) was 11.3 per 100,000 popuation, compared with 6.9 in Vancouver.\n   Homicide is definitely more common in Seattle.  The question then becomes,\n   Why?\n      The authors present a believable although not entirely accurate case\n   to support the notion, as claimed in the third step of their reasoning,\n   that Vancouver's handgun regulations are much more stringent.  But their\n   evidence on the difference in gun *availabilty* is indirect and \n   unpersuasive; indeed, they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point\n   does not exist.  They offer two fragments of inferential data in support\n   of the claim that guns are more available in Seattle; but for all anybody\n   knows as a matter of empirical fact, the opposite could be true.  We\n   are therefore being asked, at the conclusion of the study, to believe that\n   a difference in gun availability explains the difference in homicide rates\n   when a difference in gun availability has not itself been established.\n      Indeed, the situation is even more troublesome.  The first of the two\n   indirect bits of evidence is a difference between the number of concealed-\n   weapons permits issued in Seattle and the number of restricted-weapons\n   permits issued in Vancouver.  Differences between the two cities in the\n   permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable.\n*     The second bit of evidence is "Cook's gun prevalence index," which stands\n*  at 41 percent for Seattle but only 12 percent for Vancouver.  Cook's index\n*  however, does not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in \n*  various cities.  It measures gun misuse--it is an average of the percentage\n*  of homicides and suicides involving firearms.\n*     In the present case, the index shows only that in homicides and suicides,\n*  firearms are more likely to be used in Seatte than in Vancouver.  To take\n*  Cook's index as a measure of general firearms availability, it must be\n*  assumed that the proportional involvement of guns in homicides and suicides\n*  is directly related to their relative availability in the general \n*  population.  But this is exactly what the authors are seeking to prove. To\n*  assume what one is seeking to prove, then to "prove" it on the basis of\n*  that assumption does ot constitute scientific evidence for anything.\n      Even if we were to grant, on the basis of no compelling evidence, that\n   guns are less common in Vancouver, we might still question what causes what.\n   The authors attribute Seattle's higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun\n   ownership.  But it might well be argued that low crime or homicide rates\n   reduce the motivation for average citizens to obtain guns--in other words,\n   that crime rates explain the variation in gun ownership, not vice versa.\n      In fact, it was once commonly argued that Great Britain's low rate of\n   violent crime was a function of that nation's strict gun laws and the \n   consequent low rate of gun ownership--until British researcher Colin \n   Greenwood found that Great Britain had enjoyed low rates of violent crime\n   for many decades before strict firearms controls were enacted.  To invoke\n   an ancient methodological saw, correlation is not cause.\n      Nor do the problems with this study end with its lack of direct data\n   on gun ownership.  The authors say Seattle and Vancouver are "similar in\n   many ways," implying that they differ mainly in gun availability, gun-law\n   stringency, and crime rates.  This is an evident attempt to establish\n   the ceteris paribus condition of a sound scientific analysis--that "all\n   else is equal" among things being compared.\n*     Clearly the two cities are similar in some ways, but a closer look \n*  reveals differences in ways that are relevant to their respective crime\n*  or homicide rates.  The cities are closely matched in what percentage\n*  of their population is white (79 percent and 76 percent).  But Seattle\n*  is about 10 percent black, while Vancouver is less than 0.5 percent.\n*  Vancouver's minority population is overwhelmingly Asian.  So although the\n*  authors show that th two cities are approximately comparable on a half-\n*  dozen readily available demographic indicators, they have not shown\n*  that all potentially relevant sources of variation have been ruled out.\n*     In fact, the differences in racial compositions of the two cities is\n*  particularly relevant in light of the study's breakdown of homicide rates\n*  according to the race of the victim.  For the white majority, the homicide\n*  rates are nearly identical--6.2 per 100,000 in Seattle, 6.4 in Vancouver.\n*  The differing overall homicide rates in the two cities are therefore due\n*  entirely to vastly different rates among racial minorities.  For blacks,\n*  the observed difference in homicide rate is 36.6 to 9.5 and for Hispanics\n*  26.9 to 7.9.  (Methodoligical complexities render the Asian comparison\n*  problematic, but it too is higher in Seattle than in Vancouver.)  Racial\n*  minorities are much more likely to be the victims of homicide in Seattle\n*  than in Vancouver; the white majority is equally likely to be slain\n*  in either city.\n      Since the nearly 2:1 initial difference in homicide reates between the\n   cities is due exclusively to 3:1 or 4:1 differences between minority \n   groups, it is fair to ask why postulated difference in "gun availability"\n   (or gun-law strigency) would matter so dramatically to minorities but not\n   matter at all to whites.  Can differential gun availability explain why\n   blacks and Hispanics--but not whites--are so much more likely to be killed\n   in Seattle than in Vancouver?  (Studies in the United States, incidentally,\n   do not show large or consistent racial differences in gun ownership.)\n      Or are other explanations more plausible?  Could the disparity between\n   Canadian and American rates of poverty among racial minorities have \n   anything to do with it?  What are the relative rates of drug or alcohol \n   abuse?  Of homelessness among each cty's minority population?  (The city\n   of Seattle runs the largest shelter for homeless men west of the \n   Mississippi.)  Unemployment among young, central-city, nonwhite men in the\n   United States usually exceeds 40 percent.  What is the comparable Canadian\n   percentage?\n      The crucial point is that Canada and the United States differ in many\n   ways, as do cities and population subgroups with the two countries.  Absent\n   more detailed analysis, nearly any of these "many ways" might explain part\n   or all of the difference in homicide rates.  In gross comparisons such\n   as those between Seattle and Vancouver, all else is *not* equal.\n*     The authors of this study acknowledge that racial patterns in homicide\n*  result in a "complex picture."  They do not acknowledge that the ensuing\n*  complexities seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument.  They\n*  also acknowledge that "socio-economic status is probably an important\n*  confounding factor in our comparison," remarking further that "blacks   \n*  in Vancouver had a slightly higher mean income in 1981 than the rest of\n*  Vancouver's population."  Given the evidence presented in the article,\n*  it is possible that all of the difference in homicide rates between Seattle\n*  and Vancouver results from greater proverty among Seattle's racial\n*  minorities.  But the authors pay no further attention to this possibility,\n*  since "detailed information about household incomes according to race\n*  is not available for Vancouver."\n      The largely insurmountable methodological difficulties confronted in \n   gross comparative studies of this sort can be illustrated with as simple\n   example.  If one were to take all U.S. couties and compare them in terms\n   of (1) pervalence of gun ownership and (2) crime or homicide rates, one \n   would find an astonishing pattern: Counties with more guns have less crime.\n   Would one conclude from this evidence alone that guns actually reduce \n   crime?  Or would one insist that other variables also be taken into\n   account?  In this example, the "hidden variable" is city size: Guns are\n   more common in small towns and rural areas, whereas crime is a big-city\n   problem.  If researchers failed to anticipate this variable, or lacked the\n   appropriate data to examine its possible consequences, they coud be very\n   seriously misled.  In the study at hand, the authors matched two cities\n   for size but not for minority poverty rates or other hidden variables,\n   and their results are impossible to interpret.\n      In the editorial "Firearm Injuries: A Call for Science" accompanying\n   the study, two officials from the Centers for Disease Control lauded the\n   authors for applying "scientific methods" to a problem of grave public\n   heath significance.  But in attempting to draw causal conclusions from\n   nonexperimental research, the essence of scientific method is to anticipate\n   plausible alternative explanations for the results and try to rule them\n   out.  Absent such effort, the results may well seem scientific but are\n   little more than polemics masquerading as serious research.  That this\n   study is but one of a number of recent efforts--all employing practical\n   identical research designs and published in leading scientific journals--\n   is cause for further concern.\n\n   [James D.

First of all let's assume that you are right that fewer guns would make it \nin to the country, that sounds great (to those that see guns as inherently\nevil) except then every one  of those guns would be in the hands  of someone\nwho obviously couldn't care less about following the law, after all they \ngot the gun illegally, so is more likely to commit a crime with that gun.\nGreat then everyone with a gun is likely to use it in a crime, nice system.\n\nNow  as to reducing the number of guns  coming into society by making it \nillegal to manufacture, sell, or import them in this coutry,  let me use\na parallel for empiric evidence.  The amount of cocaine in this country is\nfar less since its manufacture, sale, and importation was out lawwed.    If\nthat last statement is true then perhaps we should consider your plan.  This \ncould also apply to drugs in general.
I don't think your objection is beyond the bounds of rationality.  The\nright mentioned in the bill is already established under the Second\nAmendment; the bill should be reworded to reaffirm the Second Amendment\nRKBA, and then establish the procedures for redress through the federal\ncourt system.\n\nThe right already exists and is already embodied in our Constitution.
[This is a co-authored report from two of us who were there.]\n\nGun Owners Action League, our state rifle association, started the day\nwith a rally in the secluded courtyard behind the statehouse at 9:30.\nIt was looking sparse (about 40 people) until the speaker began,\nwhereupon about 120 more people followed the loudspeakers from\nwherever they had been lost, and filled out the area something proud.\n\nMike Yacino of GOAL spoke.  One of his best throwaway lines was to\nremind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been\nchecked and certified clear of all crimes by the state; while the\npeople in the Statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of\n"election fraud" to hold their jobs.\n\nNancy Snow and Amos Hamburger were busy handing out ID buttons and\nsheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings, and\ntelling people where to find their own representatives (and in too\nmany cases, who they were).\n\nMike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and\ndiscuss a bill that hadn't made it onto the official list.  It seems a\ndelegation of students from Simon's Rock of Bard College (alma mater\nof Wayne Lo, who shot up the place with an SKS late last year) was\nbeing bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or\nammo to anyone who is not a state resident.\n\nThe hearings were originally scheduled in the (large) Gardner\nAuditorium at 10:30, but that had been pre-empted by the Governor's\nhearings on the Framingham Eight (women in prison for killing abusive\nhusbands, and seeking release).  So we had until 1:30 to buttonhole\nour representatives, after which we would be squashed into an\ninadequate hearing room.\n\nOne of my representatives' staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy.\nHe said, "Oh, it must be gun hearings day again!  The gun lobby is\nalways so organized every year."  I got a little pissed, and replied,\n"I'm not from the gun lobby -- I'm from your district."\n\nAt 12:30, your second reporter arrived in time to notice a\ndemonstration going on in front of the statehouse (where the\npro-gunners weren't).  Randy Price from the TV News was there, in his\nmirror reflective shades, talking to one of the anti-gun types, and\nseveral Simon's Rock anti-gun "close-the-loophole" protestors.\n(Earlier, Randy had covered the GOAL rally.)\n\nThe room we had been assigned seated about 50.  Remember, there were\nabout 160 gun owners there, plus another 20-30 students and teachers\nfrom Bard.  One of us had already reserved a seat; the other never got\ncloser than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind HIM.  A\ncop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the\ncrowd from coming in.  Soon after the debate started, a loudspeaker\nwas set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else.\n\nEveryone who was there (inside and outside) got to sign up on a sheet\nsaying what their position was on which bills.  Most of us signed up\nto "support GOAL's position" on "all bills."\n\nFirst, because of their time constraints, public officials got to\ntestify.  And first up was the bill that nobody had seen (the students\nhad some curfew, I guess).  \n\nCurrently, Massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase long\nguns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of\nhis own state.  Previously, the law was similar, but applied only to\nnon-residents from states adjoining Massachusetts.  The Simon's Rock\nfolks called the current law a "loophole" and wanted it closed.\n\nTwo of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his "SKS assault rifle."\nThe second one, Hodgekiss, a co-sponsor, had done his homework so well\nthat he kept confusing Montana (Wayne Lo's home state) with Missouri,\nand became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery\ncorrected him after his second muff.  Carr, from Gloucester, claimed\nthat the new bill would put the law back the way it was, but he was\nlying: the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoining\nstates ONLY if they have licensing in their own state "as strong as"\nthat in Massachusetts.  Since none of them do, that's that.\n\nSome of the things these two said were really offensive.  "In some of\nthese other states, anyone can buy a gun as long as he's breathing!"\n(Oooooo!)  "We have some very, very good gun laws in Massachusetts; if\nonly the other states would adopt the same type of laws, we wouldn't\nbe having this situation -- but they won't."  (Naughty, naughty!)\n\nNext up was Boston city councilman Albert "Dapper" O'Neill.  He was\nthere to testify pro-gun, but in some ways he was a liability.  He's\nreasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself, plus he's\nalmost a caricature of a law-n-order politician.  He badmouthed the\nACLU, said violent criminals should be executed, and that if he were\njudge, he'd give arrestees their "last rights" (pun intended) on the\nspot (at which many of the gun owners applauded, which bothered me.)\nHe said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the\nright direction -- for the criminals.  He said this FOUR times :-(\n\nTwo of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a\nCCW or FID, and confiscate all your guns, if someone had filed a\nrestraining order against you.  (Note that the filing of a restraining\norder requires no warrant, no hearing, no evidence, and no conviction\n-- just an accusation.)  Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favor\nof it, and patronized the pro-gunners there several times by saying,\n"I'm sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to\nget these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have\nconvicted."  I haven't seen such a disgustingly disingenuous\nperformance since Nixon whined that he wasn't a crook.\n\nBarrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewable\nevery five years, instead of permanent as it is now.  The stated\npurpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become ineligible.\n"Revenue has nothing to do with it."  (Yeah, right.)  Apparently, some\ncongressmen think we're stupid enough to swallow the argument that\nit's preferable to process 1.6 million renewals every cycle in the\nvague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn\ncard away from a criminal at conviction time.  As usual, hassle the\nlaw-abiding instead of the crook.\n\nThe two co-chairs of the committee were Rep. Caron and Sen. Jujuga.\nJujuga didn't say much (he was a co-sponsor of both "restraining\norder" bills) but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn't let any\nbad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged.  (He \nwas a co-sponsor of one of the "restraining order" bills as well.)  One\nof the younger reps on the committee (forgot his name) was\nvociferously pro-gun, somewhat embarrassingly so.  His heart was in\nthe right place, but his arguments seemed to be confined to, "every\nyear it's the same damn thing, you come in here with this crap..."\nIt's nice to have a friend on the committee, but he could have been\nmore effective.\n\nAt about 3:00, it was clear that the hall-jam couldn't continue.\nSomeone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because\nthe loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting, so the loudspeaker was\ndisconnected.  So they found a bigger hall upstairs.  One of us had\nto leave to catch his charter bus, and so missed the "public"\ntestimony; the other got a seat this time.\n\nCaron began by talking about how he got his FID 16 years ago, left the\nstate, and then returned without notifying them of his address change.\nHe complained that the state record system was not up-to-date and that\nhis PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived there.  Great\nquote: "If you purchase a gun today, it will not get into the state\ncomputer system until 1999."  (This was also an argument he used\nagainst the renewable FID card.)\n\nTestimony was heard from several "battered women," one of whom had\nbeen attacked by some guy in his 20's who had an FID card because he\ngot it when he was 15 or thereabouts.  They used a lot of emotion and\nsaid how they were scared of these men.  A staffer of Attorney General\nHarshbarger testified in favor of this anti-gun bill, saying how\n50,000 restraining orders were granted last year, and how these women\nneeded to be protected.  Caron noted that a restraining order was\ngranted for 10 days, and then a hearing was held to determine whether\nthe order would be extended to a year.  He asked whether she would be\nsatisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing rather\nthan after the initial issuance of the FID.  She gave some long\nrambling circumlocution in response.\n\nThen testimony against the bill was heard.  Mike Yacino (who looks\nsomething like Einstein) got up and made the point that restraining\norders were issued on too little evidence, that judges like to issue\nrestraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they\nthink is right (man or woman), and that the hearings for restraining\norders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts.\nAtty. Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony.\n\nOther pro-gunners got up to testify.  One said he had had to file a\nrestraining order against a tenant to clear her out, and that she\ncountered by filing one against him!  He noted that this would have\nallowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law.\nOne of the junior reps noted that "this is America" and we have to be\ncertain that individual rights are respected.  Senator Jujuga\nreiterated this, saying that "people who abuse smaller people can go\nto Hell as far as I care, but we have to be careful about equating\nconviction with a restraining order."  (Point and match, Senator.)\n\nAnother pro-gunner got up and testified that he didn't know his\ncitizenship "expired every 5 years," and that a driver's license was a\nprivilege, not a right like the right to keep and bear arms.\n\nA third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice\nsystem, and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public\nhangings.  Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death\npenalty bill passed, and joking responded that he, too, favored public\nhangings.  The speaker then responded, "I'll make you a deal.  You get\nme the rope, and I'll tie the noose."\n\nNext came public testimony on the Simon's Rock bill.  A teacher\ntestified that she had been the teacher of Wayne Lo, and that "he\nwouldn't have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was\noutside" without his evil gun.  She said that the "loophole" should be\nclosed to prevent something like this from "ever happening again".\n\nFour or five other kids testified in favor of this bill, one of\nspilling tears for the good legislators.  One of the students actually\nshot by Wayne Lo was also there.  Many of them had T shirts on,\nsaying, "As long as one person can buy a gun in anger, none of us are\nsafe -- support gun control."  The committee was reluctant to grill or\ncorrect the kids, except for Caron, who corrected one student who had\nclaimed that anyone could apply for an FID.  "Only residents can get\nFID's," he said.  (How much do you want to bet that this kid had no\nidea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut\nout-of-staters completely off?)\n\nYacino and McNutt spoke again, this time noting that the bill as\nwritten would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed by\nout-of-staters.  Karen also noted that hunters in CT, NH, and VT could\nbe put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundary\nsomewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens.  Yacino\nunderscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a resident\nstudent -- and, hell, even an CCW, as he had NO criminal or mental\nrecord.\n\nOne junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buy\na gun than out-of-staters, and thought it was "elitist".  Another\n(Caron?) said that we need the protection of preventing non-residents\nfrom buying without an FID because only two other states in the union\nhad "FID-type" cards, so complying with all the laws of one's home\nstate was "not enough."  One pro-gun speaker replied that this\nresembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming,\n"Everyone's out of step but Johnny!"\n\nAll the Bard College people were filing out as the pro-gun testimony\nfor this bill was made, and thus only pro-gunners were around when the\nother bills came under consideration.  The main bills remaining (and\nGOAL's position) were:\n\no  H.4375 and four others: Notify police chiefs so they can pull \n   licenses when a holder is convicted (strongly supported)\n\no  H.1732: Require trigger locks on all handguns sold (opposed)\n\no  H.962: Require trigger locks on all loaded firearms (strongly\n   opposed)\n\no  H.1350: Allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws \n   (opposed)\n\no  H.1731: Fund bullet-proof vests for municipal police (supported)\n\no  S.1097: State Constitutional Amendment for the RKBA (supported)\n\no  Several on police discretion in the issuance of FID cards (opposed)\n\no  Several altering non-resident license conditions (supported)\n\no  H.1135: Ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state (guess!)\n\nSome of these took only 30 seconds to consider, as the remaining\npro-gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them.\n\nMike Yacino noted that, besides the danger in screwing with a trigger\nlock on a loaded gun, that bill would make it illegal for a licensee\nto carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked.\n\nCaron blew right through H.1350 when he saw that we opposed it.\nAgain, he brought up the state's archaic records capability and said,\n"This would create hundreds of different licensing systems."\n\nThe session ran late -- since it was the last scheduled hearing, it\ncould not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified.  It\nended at about 6:30.\n--
oldham@ces.cwru.edu (Daniel Oldham) babbles:\n\nWhat happened in Waco is not the fault of the BATF. If they would of\nhad the proper equipment and personal then they could of captured the\ncompound on the initial assault and none of this would of happened.\n\n	If they'd gone to the door and knocked on it to serve the\n	warrant, like the Sheriff had done 3 other times, they\n	wouldn't have needed to HAVE an initial assault.  But then,\n	Herr Klinton and Attorney Gen'l Reno wouldn't have been\n	able to have told such heroic stories about how they\n	"protected" the rest of us from a group of people who\n	kept to themselves, miles out in the prairie.\n\nThe BATF needs more people, better weapons and more armored\ntransports. When they meet hostile fire they should be able to use\nmore force instead of retreating to a stand off. If you are going to\ndo a job then do it right. The BATF is there to protect us and they\nmust have the proper equipment and people to do the job.\n\n	The BATF needs to be disbanded.  This out of control group\n	of Rambo wannabees is a danger to the Republic.\n\nWith the WoD and the increased crime in the streets the BATF is needed\nmore now then ever. If they blast away a few good fokes then that is\nthe price we all have to pay for law and order in this country.\n\n	Well, I figure you're going to get flamed pretty badly by\n	everybody else for this incredibly stupid statement, so I'll\n	just let it pass for now.\n\n	Case Western reserve, huh?  Do the Feds know about that big \n	stockpile of automatic weapons and crack you have in  your\n	house?  Are you the same Daniel Oldham that lives on Orchard\n	Drive?  Just so they get the address right, that is...\n\nLook\nat all the good people that died in wars to protect this great country\nof ours.\n\n	Well, it used to be a great country.  Now I'm not so sure.  \n	I knew a few of those good people who died in wars;  I was\n	in Viet Nam.  I can assure you, none of us fought to protect\n	the right of the government to attack its own citizens with\n	military force without provocation.  (Hint: serving a search warrant\n	is NOT sufficient provocation to stage a military style assault\n	on a religious group.  At Least not here in the US.  Maybe in\n	Iraq, or Syria...)\n\nWith the arms build up in Waco they needed to hit that compound with\nmega fire power. They could of gone in there blasting and killed a few\nwomen and kids but it would of been better then letting them all burn\nto death 51 days later.
That's OK -- you can mail me if you want more discussion.\n\n\n	Around here, long-guns are proof of age and fill out the forms.\nFor pistols, nation-wide check for felonies and three days wait.  The\n"good reason" is the difference, and one Americans tend to get annoyed\nover as we see no reason the guy with the badge is any better than us.\n\n\n	Not when dealing with America.  I can drive an 18-wheel truck\nwith no permit, no license, and at age 12 if I'm engaged in farming\nwork.  Strange, that, but there is little to no problem with this.\nAgain, personal rights versus collective security.\n\n\n	Strange that the rates would decline, since killing somebody\nis much more frowned upon than merely stealing a gun.\n\n\n	Why attract attention?  I carry my sword openly to and from\npractice, as that is the only legal thing I can do.  I also attract\na lot of attention doing this.  I'd rather be lost "in a crowd of one"\nthan be the subject of attention while carrying a weapon.  Think of\nthe word "intimidation" and you can see where intimidation is not\nthe preferable method for the normal citizen.\n\n\n	Aggressive towards whom?  Southerners?  Germans?  Precisely\nwhy I think your society is less violent, weapons aside.\n\n\n	Then the masses have the same rights as the individuals, because\neverything comes down to the individual in one instance or another.  To\ndraw an analogy, Norway is involved in the EEC.  The USA in involved in\nNATO.  The EEC requires certain changes in your laws.  NATO requires\nno such changes in USA law.  These laws affect citizens, and hence\nNorway is saying Europe is more important than, say, Norwegians having\nmotorcycles that make over 100bhp.  In the USA, we'd likely tell the\nEEC to get stuffed since the EEC has no business, in our eyes, in\ntelling us how much horsepower we can safely ride.  While I note\nthat our own state governments often play with game with the federal\ngovernment, in essence this is a cultural difference between us.\n\n\n	It shouldn't.  Since neither of our countries has managed to\nremove criminals from society, in America we feel (and remember we\nhave individual states that are larger than your country) that if the\npolice cannot protect us then we must do so ourselves.  The criminals\nin our country are quite violent, hence we prepare for them.\n\n\n	We don't.  E-mail me to find out just how difficult it really\nis in this country.  It is easier than in yours, but theft is far\neasier than the troubles we go through to purchase over here.\n\n\n	They are neither.  They are an option.  We would never force\nyou to own guns if you lived here.  We would, however, fight to keep\nthat option open to you.\n\n\n	Then you show you are a responsible, rational user of weapons.\nWelcome to our ranks.  Now, how do we teach the young people this sort\nof responsibility?  Cultures seem to have a grave impact here.\n\n	I notice you didn't use my great-grandfather's name.  Well,\nhe didn't like it much either ;-)
Note: These trial updates are summarized from reports in the\n_Idaho Statesman_ and the local NBC affiliate television\nstation, KTVB Channel 7.\n\nRandy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update: Day 4.\n\nFriday, April 16, 1993 was the fourth day of the trial.\n\nSynopsis: Defense attorney Gerry Spence cross-examined agent\nCooper under repeated objections from prosecutor Ronald\nHowen.  Spence moved for a mistrial but was denied.\n\nThe day was marked by a caustic cross-examination of Deputy\nMarshal Larry Cooper by defense attorney Gerry Spence.  Although\nSpence has not explicitly stated so, one angle of his stategy\nmust involve destroying the credibility of agent Cooper.  Cooper is\nthe government's only eyewitness to the death of agent Degan.\nSpence attacked Cooper's credibility by pointing out discrepancies\nbetween Cooper's statements last September and those made in court.\nCooper conceded that, "You have all these things compressed into\na few seconds...It's difficult to remember what went on first."\n\nCooper acknowledged that he carried a "9mm Colt Commando submachine\ngun with a silenced barrel." [I thought a Colt Commando was a revolver!]\nCooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specific\nplans to use the weapon when they started to kill Weaver's dog.\n\nWhen Spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by Degan's\nM-16 rifle when Degan was apparently dead, Cooper could not say for\nsure that Degan did not return fire before going down.\n\nSpence continued by asking with how many agents (and to what extent)\nhad Cooper discussed last August's events, Cooper responded, "If\nyou're implying that we got our story together, you're wrong,\ncounselor."  Spence continued to advance the defense's version of\nthe events: Namely, that a marshal had started the shooting by\nkilling the Weaver's dog.  Cooper disagreed.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen repeatedly objected to Spence's\nvirulent cross-examination of agent Cooper, arguing that the questions\nwere repetitive and Spence was wasting time.  Howen also complained \nthat Spence was improperly using a cross-examination to advance the\ndefense's version of the events.  U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge\nsustained many of the objections; however, both lawyers persisted\nuntil Judge Lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded to\nadmonish both attorneys.  "I'm not going to play games with either\ncounsel.  This has been a personality problem from day 1, so start\nacting like professionals."\n\nSpence told the judge that, "When all the evidence is in, we'll see\nthat ... his [agent Larry Cooper] testimony is not credible, that\nhe was panicked and cannot remember the sequence of events." \nSpence continued, "We're going to find...that there is a very unlikely\nsimilarity - almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter - between\nthe testimony of Mr. Cooper and the other witnesses."\n\nSpence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that Howen's repeated\nobjections would prevent a fair trial, "We can't have a fair trial if the\njury believes I'm some sort of charlatan, if the jury believes I'm\nbending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that I'm\nviolating court orders."\n\nJudge Lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of Howen's\nobjections had somehow prejudiced the jury was "preposterous" and\ndenied the motion for a mistrial.  Lodge did tell Howen to restrict\nhis comments when objecting.\n\nThe trial resumed with the prosecution calling FBI Special Agent Greg\nRampton.  The prosecution's purpose was simply to introduce five\nweapons found in the cabin as evidence: However, the defense seized\non the opportunity to further address Cooper's credibility.\n\nDefense attorney Ellison Matthews (Harris' other attorney) questioned\nRampton about the dog.  Rampton stated that there were no specific\nplans to kill the Weaver's dog without being detected.  Matthews then\nhad Rampton read  a Septtember 15, 1992 transcript in which Rampton\nhad said that Cooper had said that the purpose of the silenced weapon\nwas to kill the dog without being detected, if the dog chased them.\nRampton then acknowledged that he believed that Cooper had said that,\nbut he could not remember when.  He then stated that, "I did not conduct\nthe primary interview with Deputy Cooper, but I have had conversations\nwith him since the interview was conducted."

All homicides must be shown, per capita, not  \n: just handguns.  The availability of them in the USA makes them the preferred  \n: murder weapon, but ban them, and some other weapon will step in as the  \n: favorite.\n\nAs a "favorite", sure.  As lethal, not likely.  A study of violence in\nChicago produced this table:\n\n		Percentage of Reported Gun and Knife Attacks\n			    Resulting in Death\n			    \n	Weapon				Deaths As Percentage of Attacks\n	---------------------------------------------------------------\n	Knives (16,518 total attacks)		 2.4\n	Guns (6,350 total attacks)		12.2\n\n	Source: Firearms and Violence in American Life\n	\nIt might be contended that if gun murderers were deprived of guns\nthat they would find a way to kill as often with knives.  If this were\nso, knife attacks in cities where guns were widely used in homicide\nwould be expected to show a low fatality rate, and knife attacks in\ncities where guns were not so widely used (like Vancouver) would show\na higher fatality rate.  But the Nat'l Commission on the Causes and\nPrevention of Violence Task Force analyzed the data and found this\nnot to be the case.  It appeared to them that as the number of knife\nattacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks\n(which presumably happened where guns were less available to assailants),\nthe proportion of FATAL knife attacks did NOT increase relative to the\nproportion of gun attacks.  In fact, the reverse was true.\n\nWhat was found was that most homicides did not show a determination on\nthe part of the assailant to kill.  Fatalities caused by knife tended\nto show a single-mindedness on the part of the assailant to do grave\nphysical injury: multiple stabs wounds, wounds concentrated about the\nhead neck and chest, etc.  Most gun homicides did not show this\npattern.  Rather, more fatal attacks were committed during a moment of\nrage and not the focused intent to kill the victim.\n\n	Source: Report on Firearms and Violence\n\n: Then, since England != USA (my ancestors left because of the oppression) you  \n: must compare England before strict gun laws to England after strict gun laws to  \n: be able to draw any meaning at all.  England has essentially legalized drugs,  \n: so there are no drug gangs battling for turf, etc., there.  If you drop out the  \n: drug related killings here, the USA would look a whole lot more peaceful.\n\nThere are a lot of factors which make a difference.  Actually, I'm not\nfond of making ANY kind of social parallels between Europeans and\nAmericans. There are more cultural, beahvioral and economic\ndifferences between us than similarities.  I just sort of found\nmyself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks.  I\ndon't think we could ever attain the low levels of European violent\ncrime here in the US, whether we banned guns or required every\nlaw-abiding citizen to carry a loaded Uzi.\n\nOn the other hand, we can draw lessons from neighbors who are more\nculturally similar, namely the Canadians.  In fact, an exhaustive,\nseven-year study has already been done of the respective crime rates\nof Vancouver, British Columbia and Seattle, Washington... cities\nwith roughly the same population, urban economy, geography\nand crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control.\n\nIn Seattle, handguns may be purchased legally for self-defense.  After\na 30-day waiting period, a permit can be obtained to carry a concealed\nweapon.  The recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted.\n\nIn Vancouver, self-defense is not considered a valid or legal reason\nto purchase a handgun.  Concealed weapons are not permitted.\nRecreational uses of handguns (target shooting, collecting) are\nregulated by the province.  Purchase of a handgun requires a\nrestricted-weapons permit.  A permit to carry may be obtained in\norder to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs.  Handguns\ntransported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box.\nIn short, gun control but not unreasonably so.\n\nBoth cities aggressively enforce their gun laws.  Convictions for\ngun-related offenses carry similar penalties.  The researchers\nstudied all cases of robbery, assault (simple and aggravated),\nburglary and homicides occurring in Seattle and Vancouver from\n1/1/80 to 12/31/86. In defining the cases, they used the same\nstandard: the FBI's Unified Crime Report.\n\nResults: during the seven-year study the annual rate of robbery in\nSeattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in Vancouver\n(1.09 / 1.11).  Burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates (.99).\n18,925 assaults were recorded in Seattle versus 12,034 in\nVancouver.  The risk of being a victim of a simple assault in\nSeattle was found to be only slightly higher than Vancouver (1.18 /\n1.15) and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher\n(1.16 / 1.12).  However, when aggravated assaults were subdivided by\nweapon and the mechanism of assault, a clear pattern emerged.\nAlthough both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravated\nassault involving knives and other dangerous weapons, firearms were\nfar more likely to be used in Seattle.  In fact, 7.7 times as often.\n\nOver the seven-year study, 388 homicides occurred in Seattle\n(11.3 per 100,000) vs. 204 homicides in Vancouver (6.9 per 100,000).\nAfter adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations,\nthe relative risk of being a victim of homicide in Seattle, as\ncompared to Vancouver, was found to be 1.63.\n\nWhen homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death, the rate\nof homicide by knives and other weapons (excluding firearms) in\nSeattle was found to be almost identical to that in Vancouver.\nVirtually ALL of the increased risk of death in Seattle was due to\na more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms.  Handguns\naccounted for roughly 85% of homicides involving firearms.  Handguns\nwere 4.8 times more likely to be used in homicides in Seattle than\nin Vancouver.\n\nThe authors of the report also investigated "legally justifiable"\nhomicides (self-defense).  Only 32 such homicides occurred during\nthe seven-year study, 11 of which were committed by police.  Only\n21 cases of civilians acting in self-defense occurrred: 17 in\nSeattle and 4 in Vancouver.  Only 13 involved firearms.  After\nexcluding these cases, there was virtually no impact on these\nearlier findings.\n\n-------\n\nThis is, I feel, a very fair report.  One might even make the\nargument that it is biased against Canada as a whole because\nVancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three times\nthat of Ottawa, Calgary and Toronto while Seattle reports\nannual homicide rates only half to two-thirds that of NYC,\nChicago, Los Angeles and Houston.\n\nCritics of handgun control always argue that limited legal access\nto handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide because\npersons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire a\ngun or will kill by other means.  This report shows differently.\nIf the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more by\nthe strength of intent than by the availability of weapons, we\ncould expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns to\nbe higher in Vancouver than in Seattle.  However, during the study\ninterval, Vancouver's rate of homicide by weapons other than guns\nwas not significantly higher than that in Seattle, suggesting that\nfew would-be assailants switched to homicide by other methods.\n\nAs well, ready access to handguns for self-defense by law-abiding\ncitizens was not endorsed in this report.  Although Seattle did\nexperience a higher rate of firearm death for self-defense, these\ncases accounted for less than 4% of the homicides in both cities\nduring the course of the study period.  And, as was reported,\nSeattle apparently didn't enjoy relief from any crime category\nover Vancouver because citizens may legally arm themselves for\nself-defense.\n\n	Heavily quoted source: Handgun Regulation, Crime,\n	Assaults, and Homicide: A Tale of Two Cities.\n\n	John H.

On the subject of CS/CN/tear gas: when I received my initial introduction to\ntear gas, the first thing that came to mind was the location of the exit.  If\nthere had been anything in the way, corners to negotiate, doors to open, or \nany other obstacles to movement, I would have had a difficult time exiting the\nchamber.  And any concentration of tear gas is hazardous to individuals with\nrespiratory problems, and the wearing of soft contact lenses in a tear gas \ncontaminated area is considered a REAL BAD IDEA.  So hoping the BD's would\npeaceably come strolling out the door after being gassed is a bit unrealistic.\nIf they could have found the door, having them staggering out retching wouldn't\nbe too far fetched.  Throw in the factor of 50-51 days of being under siege and\nsubject to psychological warfare, and all bets on functional abilities are off.\nAnybody tried to get Amnesty International to jump in on this one?

Jason Kratz writing:\n\n...\nJK>If they had rocket launchers and such (as the press and gov claims) why\nJK>shouldn't they have done something?  What possible use would a religious cult\nJK>have for a rocket launcher?  Also, is child abuse covered by the Bill of\nJK>Rights?\n...\n\nThis is taken a little out of context and I'm not flaming Jason...it's just\nthat this was the proverbial straw....\n\nI grow a little weary of the allegations (here, the media, people on the\nstreet) that the BD's had all these "horrible illegal weapons and other\nparaphenalia of destruction capable of blowing tanks 50 feet into the air..."\nand then, without missing a beat, discuss how the BD's willfully commited\nmass suicide, or killed their own less fanatical and *then* commited mass\nsuicide, etc., etc.\n\nIf the BD's had all these things and intended to "blow up their abode, blow up\nWaco, blow up the entire country, or whatever suits your fancy, what happened\nto all the violence they were supposed to unleash? Why wouldn't they have "gone\nout in the proverbial blaze of glory" and "come out shooting" with an attitude\nof "let's take as many of those dogs as possible with us"?\n\nInstead, they seemed to have preferred death to whatever they thought was in\nstore for them at the government's hands.\n\nIt's totally immaterial whether they were all crazy, all fanatics, all followers\nof the antichrist, haters of the government, practicers of weird lifestyles, or\nwhatever...they must have felt that they were being pressured into renouncing\ntheir beliefs, however how strange or lunatic those beliefs might appear to "you\nand me". There is much precedent for such devotion to cause.\n\nMy conclusion at this point is that the "authorities" seriously misread their\ndanger to society (else why did the BD's not do as suggested above) and/or chose\nthis incident to make some heinous point or satisfy some internal agenda, up to\nand including AG J. Renbo using this as an opportunity to assert her manhood.\n\nSome people really do believe it is better to die than be subjected to what\nthey perceive as the godless government.

Down to 170-some odd lines.  We must be making progress!\nOn an ironic note, where I deleted lines Emacs continually gave me\nthe message "Garbage collecting... Done."  Think it's trying to\ntell me something?\n\n\n\n	You lurkers can join in at any time, you know!  Ahhh..\nTalk.politics.guns -- the kindler, gentler newsgroup.  Who would\nhave thought?\n\n\n	I remind you of shrapnel.  I consider 5' a reasonable space\nlimitation, but make no mistake a gun blowing up is a hazard to\nthose nearby, say in the next lane at the range.  My point was at\nwhat distance, or level of threat, we draw the line.  Is it the\nendangerment of others, so we do a 5' restriction, or the possibility\nof being shot, hence we draw a 1.5 mile restriction, or a nuke and\ndraw a 5 mile restriction?  To me they al suffer from the fundamental\nflaw that they restrict based upon the instrument rather than placing\nthe responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulders of the user.\nPerhaps Sen. Metzenbaum declaring the Barrett Light Fifty an assault\nrifle has made this more apparent to me, since the Barrett has\nonly range and acurracy going for it.\n\n\n	I disagree, on the grounds that a house can be rebuilt much\nmore easily than my family once I have died.  I assume that word\nwould get to the citizens that such an attack was planned.  If this\nis not the case, the tactical and strategic implications change\nquite a bit.  Personally, my home is worth, say, twenty Martians\nintent on taking over the world.  My family?  All of them.  The\nbalancing act here is hard to judge sitting at my desk.\n\n\n	That seems to be the case already, given that heavy\nweapons aren't commonly owned by the citizenry.  With such low\nnumbers, obviously due to cost, I don't think the superior\nweapons are going to be of great effect against a numerically\nsuperior foe.  Furthermore, it is even more doubtful their training\nincludes proper tactical movements that best utilize tanks,\nwhereas the commonly rifleman is not so hampered in effectiveness.\n\n\n	I had envisioned that the armorer, perhaps the officers\nof a select group, and the like would exercise control over the\nheavier, more complex weapons.  But, if Joe Bob owns an old Sherman\ntank I certainly wouldn't ask him to give it up.  Follow orders\nfrom the officers, yes.  Since the expense of a tank is so large,\nthough, chances are it would be jointly purchased and should\ntherefore be jointly maintained and operated.\n\n\n	This I'll agree with to a point.  The State having control\nover the heavy weapons should not be justification for the state\nto have them centrally located.  Keep them spread out, such that\nthe ability of the State to lock them up isn't so easy.  Otherwise,\nI would have to assume that State control would rest on the\nauthority of the Governor and militia officers.\n\n\n	I'm having a hard time seeing how these heavy weapons,\nfairly few in numbers, could not be easily wielded by a few\npeople with government support.  Just as you argued above that\nthe weapons should be divvied up and under democratic control\nso one side doesn't have all of them, I can't see where this\nsituation is alleviated in having the select militia holding\nall the weapons and the unorganized militia being the infantry.\nI think a better mix is called for.  But, I would argue that\nthe Federal army should rely upon the select militia and the\nunorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry units.\n\n\n	We have to assume that there would be those who would\nside with the government-controlled forces, and if they've all\nthe equipment an infantry force 3x the size would be in trouble.\nI'd like to see that heavy stuff, say tanks, offset by the\nlocal troups having a few 105's and anti-tank weapons in their\narmory.  These would be much more useful to infantry than the\ntank would be when cost and training requirements are figured in.\nI suppose I'm quibbling over what constitutes heavy equipment.\n\n\n	So would I, but the resources often aren't available to\noutfit local units well enough.  Thus, we will certainly have to\ncall in others, and a mechanized unit carries more stuff faster\nthan anything else.\n\n\n	Perhaps our ideas of heavy weapons are different?  I think\nmain battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, and 155mm and up\nfield pieces are heavy stuff.  M113 troop carriers, 2 1/2 ton\ntrucks, HumVee's, old M60 tanks, 105 Howitzers, are more the stuff\nof a mechanized infantry.  Actually, this is what the Guard units\nin Iowa are currently fielding in some units.\n\n	Perhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavy\nequipment under State control, with little but numbers and light\nstuff to act as a deterrent.  Allowing main battle tanks to the\nstates should be balanced with anti-tank capability in the local\nranks.  Similarly, local units would need to band together quickly,\nhence small and fast response means mechanized infantry.  Finally,\nthe militia is more than just fighting.  Equipment is needed for\nother responses.  The Federal army, I'm convinced, should have a\nvery minumum of infantry, relying on the state and local militias\nfor these functions.
:You are loosing.\n\n"Loosing"?  Well, I'll avoid the spelling flames and see if this person\ncan make up for it.\n\n\n:There is no question about it. \n\nOh, there's LOTS of question about it.  People are becoming more aware each\nday that their rights are being threatened, so much so that NRA membership \nis growing at the rate of nearly 2,000 per *day*.  We are slowly gaining\nour rightful voice, despite the biases, prejudices, and veiled motives of\nthe liberal media and anti-gun politicians.  We will win.\n\n:Of those who vote, your cause is considered an abomination. No matter\n:how hard you try, public opinion is set against the RKBA. \n\nWhat do you base this on?  Some highly-skewed poll conducted by NBC News?\nThe same group who faked GM pickup explosions just to make "news"?  Right.\n\n:This is the end. By the finish of the Clinton administration, your\n:RKBA will be null and void. Tough titty.\n\nIt is true that we face even greater obstacles to our rights, betrayed by\nthose lying politicians who swear an oath to protect the Constitution "from\nall enemies, both foreign and domestic."  But the People will take only so\nmany lies and deceits.\n\n:You had better discover ways to make do without firearms. The number of\n:cases of firearms abuses has ruined your cause. There is nothing you\n:can do about it. Those who live by the sword shall die by it. \n\nThen the criminals who live by murder shall die by it.  Honest, law-abiding\ncitizens need have no fear on that count.  You, however, will evidently\ndie by (or at least in) ignorance.  And the number of firearms self-defenses\nshall spell out our ultimate victory.\n\n:The press is against you, the public (the voting public) is against\n:you, the flow of history is against you ... this is it !\n\nThe flow of history was against the Founding Fathers, but they managed to \nsuccessfully form the first real free republic on the face of this planet,\na republic that has become the model for all others to follow.  The press\nis against us, for its own selfish motivations.  And the people will soon\nrealize the depths of deceit being spread by that media, and nullify its\nill-directed power.  The People are with us.\n\n:Surrender your arms. Soon enough, officers will be around to collect\n:them. Resistance is useless. They will overwhelm you - one at a time.\n:Your neighbors will not help you. They will consider you more if an\n:immediate threat than the abstract 'criminal'. \n\nI shall never submit to an illegal, unConstitutional police state.  I will\ntake my own vow to uphold the Constitution, and I shall defend it and my\ncountry against a tyrannical government gone mad, should it become\nnecessary.\n\n:Too fucking bad. You have gone the way of the KKK. Violent solutions\n:are passe'. Avoid situations which encourage criminals. Then you will\n:be as safe as possible. Such as it is ...\n\nI will not be your sacrificial sheep, and I shall not bow down to you or\nanyone else who seeks to control my life.  Being an unarmed target is the\nSUREST way of encouraging criminals, and believe me, I shall avoid it as\nmuch as possible.  Then I shall be as safe as possible.  I will answer\nwith violence only when no other option exists, but I shall surely answer.\n\nMike Ruff
So why did the Australian Customs Service make a public statement to\na parliamentary committee last year that weapons smuggling was a problem\nwhich it was not able to control?  Possibly criminals don't have your \ngrasp of economics?
[deleted]\n[]       And as far as fully-automatic weapons, you can be a lot better\n[]armed if you want to hit what you aim at.\n[]\n\nDefine "armed better". Go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like the\nColt .45. Does one fires faster than the other? Nope. Aside from which\nfaster rate of fire is usually not desirable. Sure it makes the other\nguys duck for cover, but just *YOU* trying hitting anything with a Thompson\nin hose-mode. This is why the military is limiting it's M-16 now to\n3-round burst-fire. Simple semi-auto would be better, but the troops\nlike to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo (something\noften in short supply when the enemy is plentiful).\n\nA revolver is equally capable as a semi-auto in the same caliber.\n\n- A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull\n  the trigger again.\n- A double-action revolver (almost all of them) can be hand-cocked first,\n  but will fire merely by pulling the trigger.\n- A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again\n  to rotate to the next round.\n- A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the\n  hammer for maximum safety, but still can be drawn and fired with an\n  easy motion, even one handed.\n- Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines\n  on semi-autos. Can be faster depending on users.\n\n- A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell\n  first, time spent which can be fatal. And a vital second or so is often\n  lost as you realize "hey, it's jammed!" before starting to do anything\n  about clearing it.\n- Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round\n  and cock the hammer. Some police carry their semi-autos with the \n  chamber loaded and hammer cocked, but a safety engaged. I do not consider\n  this safe however. You must trade-off safety to get the same speed\n  of employment as a revolver.\n- There are some double-action semi-autos out there, but the complexity of\n  operation of many of them requires more training.\n\nSome police departments switched to Glocks, and then started quietly\nswitching many officers back to the old revolvers. Too many were having\naccidents, partly due to the poor training they received. Not that Glocks\nrequire rocket scientists, but some cops are baffled by something as complex\nas the timer on a VCR.\n\nAnyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun\nthe police don't know nothing about firearms. Turn off COPS and Hunter\nand pay attention. I do not seek here to say "semi-autos are junk"\nmerely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid. A cop\nwith a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than\nequipped for anything short of a riot.\n\nGun control is hitting what you aim at. If you whip out a \nwonder-nine and fire real fast you may find you don't hit anything.\nGood controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit.\nI own a 9mm Beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon\nto something like the Ruger Security Six revolver. If I haven't hit\nwhat I'm aiming at in the first 5 shots, something is quite seriously\nwrong somewheres. While I might like having the backup capacity of those\nextra shots in certain cases, overwhelmingly the # of shots fired in\ncriminal encounters is less than 5.\n\nWhat do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime? Why the same nice simple\n.38 revolvers that the police often use. Well actually some police \nprefer the much heftier .357 Magnum, but anyway.....\n\nObPlea: Don't flame me, I prefer semi-autos for most things. But they \n        introduce unneccessary complications to something as nerve-wracking\n        as an abrupt encounter with a lone criminal.
Because there are about 40 homicides total (i.e. using guns, knives,\ntire-irons, baseball bats, bare hands, etc...) in Switzerland\neach year and 850 homicides, total, in England. That's three\ntimes worse per capita in England than in Switzerland. Since\ndead is dead, it really doesn't matter that 60% of the Switz\nmurders involved a gun or that only 0.9% of the English murderers\ndo.
So?  Kratz was there - does that mean that he's a gang member?\n\nEven in the most gang-infested areas, most of the residents ARE NOT\ngang-members.\n\n\nHow was it obvious?  Were they not trying to hit the target?  Or, does\nKratz confuse "marksmanship" with "trying to simulate a post"?  If so,\nthat excludes self-defense shooting, but the rest of us understand\nthat that exclusion would be an error.  (It excludes a lot of legit\n"gun games" as well.)\n\n\nSounds like practical pistol or maybe IPSC.  It also sounds like how a\nself-defense shooter might well practice.  The only things that action\nexcludes are hunting and "like a post" shooting.  Kratz should get out\nmore often.\n\n-andy
Not provable.  It's about as "provable" as the number of votes\nvast for Bill Clinton in the last election.  If you accept the information\navailable, you can prove one way or the other.  If you refuse to accept\nit, nothing is "provable."\n\n\n      Fine, support your assertation.  But, you haven't supported\nany assertations just yet.\n\n      The National Crime Survey, that secret Arm of the NRA, estimates\nbetween 40,000 and 50,000 with-gun self-defenses from assaults, and\nis considered to considerably under-report.  When broken down by weapon,\nthere is no form of "self-defense" including dowing nothing which is\nmore effective at avoiding injury or death.\n\n\n      Ok, support *this* assertation.  Hell, support *one*.\n\n\n      That's nice.\n\n\n      That's nice, too.\n\n\n       Why on Earth should we?  If you're correct we've nothing to\nlose by continuing to argue against it and everything to gain.

: The Swiss population is (and well was) far larger than that. I think\n: your question should be, "...losing sleep over a million expert\n: riflemen?" Certainly he could have conquered Switzerland, but\n: a million armed militiamen (especially in a mountainous area, \n: where tanks' effectiveness is limited) would have made it a\n: real pain. The question a conqueror would ask, is "is it worth \n: the trouble?" The more difficult an invasion is, the more likely\n: the answer would be "no." Certainly a million riflemen (as\n: opposed to a professional army of only ten or twenty thousand, the\n: best a country the size of Switzerland could support), makes\n: invasions more difficult.\n\n   Hitler invaded Yugoslavia and occupied it.  The mountainous portions were\nsometimes patrolled by the wermacht, but they were certainly not in control.\nThere were two major native factions opposing each other and the germans,\nIt was basically useless to the germans (no production) and a drain on their\nresources (a armored division and a couple of infantry divisions) Which if\nmy memory is correct, were kind of stuck there up until the allies accepted\ntheir surrender.  (I think that the allies also let the germans keep some \nof their weapons for self defense unitil they were able to get to the \nlowlands, away from the resistance factions.  This is from memory, and \nit is unreliable.
As perhaps some insight into how this sort of thing works, the\nlocal college newspaper had a big crusade to have the U.T. police\nrelease crime stats.  (The school claimed that to do so would violate\nfederal education records privacy laws).  They swore up and down they\nweren't interested in student discipline records, only for stats so people\ncould make an evaluation of how safe the campus was.\n\n       It was barely a week after crime stats were released before the\nDaily Beacon had an editorial calling for student disciplinary stats\nto be released, because they complained certain segments of the campus\npopulation were treated administratively rather than turned over to the\npolice and therefore the criminal states weren't accurate.\n\n       What people say they want public today may not be what they\nsay tomorrow.

This directory can be used for things like\narticles by Kates, Wright, Tonso, Levinson, Supreme Court Decisions,\nthe RIA vs US decision, copies of legislation, and so on.  It's not\nmeant to be for the discussions that normally appear here.\n\nSo, in the future if you're looking for something check there first\nand then ask here.\n\nInstructions:\n\nShort version for techies:\n\nThe site is godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu.  Place contributions into the\ndirectory /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba.  The ftp commands\nget, put, mget, or mput should work.  Give the command "type binary"\nto be sure files are transferred correctly.  Your files will be moved\nto the rkba directory.  To get a file use the commands get or mget.\n\nI will maintain an index which you should get first to check if\nthe file you want to read or write already is archived.\n\nLong version for non-techies:\n\nIn order for you to use this archive your computer must be on\nthe Internet.  To connect to the archive site run the command:\n\n	ftp godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu\n\nIf that doesn't work you cannot use this archive.  If the ftp\ncommand is successful you'll get this prompt asking you for a\nlogin:\n	Name (godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu:lvc):\n\nInstead of lvc your initials will appear.  Answer this prompt with:\n\n	ftp\n\nNext you'll get this prompt asking your for your e-mail address:\n\n	Guest login ok, send e-mail address as password:\n\nI would enter:\n\n	l.v.cipriani@att.com\n\nYou'll enter your own e-mail address.  You'll get these lines\nor similar as output:\n\n	Remote system is UNIX.\n	Using binary mode to transfer files.\n\nNext, the command prompt is printed:\n\n	ftp> \n\nIf you do not get the line "Using binary mode to transfer files."\nRun the command:\n\n	type binary\n\nNow you're logged in to the archive machine.  There are many\ndirectories on this machine  but the two you are concerned with are\n\n	/usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba\nand\n	/usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming\n\nThere are subdirectories to the rkba directory, those are discussed below.\n\nWhen you login to the system your directory is /usr0/anon.  To retreive\nfiles change your current directory to the rkba directory with the command:\n\n	cd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba\nor\n	cd pub/firearms/politics/rkba\n\nTo submit files change your directory to the incoming directory with\nthe command:\n\n	cd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming\nor\n	cd pub/firearms/politics/incoming\n\nOnce you do this you'll get another ftp> prompt asking you to enter\nanother command.\n\nTo find the names of the existing files in the directory you are\nin run the command:\n\n	ls -l\n\nThis will produce something like:\n\ntotal 6021\n-r--r--r--  1 karl          6932 Jun 16  1992 DMN_Gratia_CCP\n-r--r--r--  1 karl         69149 Apr  5 19:20 INDEX\n-r--r--r--  1 karl         18965 Jun 16  1992 Knox_AW_lies\n-r--r--r--  1 karl         10930 Apr 30  1992 S361\n-r--r--r--  1 karl          8958 Jun 16  1992 WSJ_Crimestrike\n-r--r--r--  1 karl          2649 Jan 13 18:33 academia-bias\n-r--r--r--  1 karl           935 Mar 22 22:38 academics\n-r--r--r--  1 karl         36079 Aug  4  1992 aclu\n... and so on ...\n\nEach line corresponds to one file.  Reading right to left, the fields\nare the file name, the last modification date of the file, the size of\nthe file in bytes, and some permission fields which you do not need\nto be concerned with.\n\nTo get a file run the command "get" followed by the name of the file\nyou want, for example:\n\n	get INDEX\nor\n	get noduty\n\nAfter the file is transfered to your machine a message like this:\n\n	Transfer complete.\n	19580 bytes received in 5 seconds (4 Kbytes/s)\n\nYou can repeat the get command for every file you want to retreive.\nYou can use the mget command to retreive multiple files.  If the\nfile you want is in a subdirectory, for example, congress/103rd/HR1025\nyou should change your directory to the appropriate subdirectory first\nand then retrieve it:\n\n	cd congress/103rd\n	get HR1025\n\nOnce you're finished you can log off with the command:\n\n	quit\n\nIf you have a file you want to contribute the procedure is a little\ndifferent.  First of all you should find out if the file already\nexists, so get a copy of the index file with the procedure above\nand look it over to make sure you wouldn't repeat an entry.  The\nindex will have a description of each of the files in the rkba\ndirectory.  For example:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFile: whitemanslaw\n\nWhite Man's Law by William R. Tonso, from the December 1985\nReason magazine\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOnce you've determined you won't be duplicating an entry, login\nand change to the incoming directory command (see above).  Once\nyou are in the incoming directory use the command:\n\n	put file_name\n\nIn this case:\n\n	put whitemanslaw\n\nAgain there'll be a "Transfer complete, so many bytes transfered\nin so many seconds" message.  Now your file is on the archive\nmachine.\n\nAnother thing to watch out for is duplicate file /names/.  Be sure\nthere isn't a file in the incoming directory that is called the same\nas the file you want to write.  If you use the same name you'll\noverwrite the previous file [or you'll get an error message].\n\nYour file may have to be renamed if there is a conflict with a\nfile by the same name in the rkba directory.\n\nOnce your file is in the incoming directory send me an entry for\nthe INDEX file and I will add it to the file.\n\nIf you cannot use anonymous ftp and would still like to contribute\na file email the file to me and I'll take care of the rest.\n\nIf you submit a file and do not notify me it may be removed, so\nbe sure to let me know first.\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask me.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n-- \nLarry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com
Actually, if I were one of the survivors and wanted to institute a civil\nrights violation lawsuit against the Treasury Dept., I would claim that\nthe BATF/FBI itself was to blame for any mass hysteria/insanity...
Koresh had a lawyer, Deguin(?) who he spoke to in person several times during\nthe last few weeks. \n\n\n  This strikes me as a tad ingenous.  "If X had done/note done Y, then Z would\nnever have happened."  I tend to place tha responsibility on the group/person\nactually committing the act, not on those whon "forced them to do it".\n\n  After all, to take an extreme example, if the British were not in Northern\nIreland, the IRA would not be forced to place bombs in shopping centers.\n\n  That said, this whole sorry story was a totally unecessary, utterly fucked\nup mess from the get go.\n\nsemper fi,
That's not all that Kratz doesn't know.\n\n\nNow we know that Kratz doesn't understand what a safety is supposed to\ndo.  (He also confuses "things he can see" with "things that exist";\nGlocks have multiple safeties even though only one is visible from the\noutside.)\n\nA safety is supposed to keep the gun from going off UNLESS that's\nwhat the user wants.  With Glocks, one says "I want the gun to go\noff" by pulling the trigger.  If the safeties it has make that work,\nit has a "real" safety, no matter what Kratz thinks.\n\n-andy
Actually if 'a few minutes' translates into 6 hours, you have it\nright.  BUT you (and I guess your single-source news agency CNN)\nfailed to mention the Davidians pouring kerosene all over and lighting it in plain\nview.\n\n\nWell, small-scale Jim Jones type suicide with fire instead of kool-aid.\n\n\nSorry, guy, you got it wrong.  ATF was pumping tear gas into the compound.\nThe Branch Davidians (going along with their apocolyptic faith) set their\nown compound on fire killing all but 9 or so.  No children survived.\n\n\nSelf-slaughter, anyway.  I pity the children who were to young to be able\nto make a conscious choice.\n\n\nYou are wrong.  Thank goodness.  I would suggest, however, that you take\na deep breath, and wait 30 minutes or so before posting.  Also make sure\nyour facts are correct before making your allegations(sp.).\n\n\nYou repeated wrong.  There were 9.\n\n\nGod help the Branch Davidians.\n\n\nNO DON'T!!!!  THERE IS WAY TOO MUCH OF THIS CRAP BEING CROSSPOSTED ALL OVER\nCREATION AS IT IS!!!!!!
To keep from flooding s.c.u, I e-mailed it.  However, I agree that it's\nquite the sneaky trick.  No more than I would expect, however.\n--
Let's see if I have this straight.  A law is created that says "you can not\nhave a automatic weapon" and therefore it's ok for the government to use\nany level of force to enforce that law.  Doesn't matter if the entire \npopulation of the planet is destroyed as long as that law is obeyed.
Re: More on Gun Buybacks\n\nThe Denver buy back, trading guns for Denver Nuggets tickets was pretty much\na bust. Very few guns were turned in. The news tried to hype it but \nwhen the best they could do was ".... including a loaded .38..." well,\nyou get the picture.\n\nA side note- the news also reported that the guns would be checked for\nwhether or not they were stolen. STOLEN GUNS WILL BE RETURNED TO THEIR\nOWNERS!!!!! (They say)\n\n(Does this have anything to do with the rally on the Capital steps yesterday\n in support of the RKBA????)\n\nEven the rally made the 5 pm news on 3 channels :-)
/ iftccu:talk.politics.guns / jrm@gnv.ifas.ufl.edu /  6:26 am  Apr 14, 1993 /\n\n\n\nI suppose that depends on how you define 'vast' majority....\n\nYou are correct about 'majority.'  Somewhere between 1 out of three and \none out of 10 will at some period in their lives experience a violent \nassault.  The risk is generally higher than emergency medical problems\nlike heart attack and stroke.\n\n'Vast' is probably too loose a term.  With approximately 1,000,000 Americans\nusing firearms each year, over a 30 year period we get (roughly, since some\nmay have to do this more than once) 30 MILLION Americans with experience in \nusing firearms for self defense.  30/250 yields 12 percent of the population.\n(Yes, I know that is a REAL rough estimate.  We're closer to 270 million now, \nbut many of these are minors and should be included etc, thus the percentage\nif anything is low.)\n\nAt any rate, most minority groups in this range are not usually referred \nto as 'tiny' minorities, so I don't see how the other part of the group \ncan be referred to as the 'vast' majority.  A little more work might \nsupport a 'simple' majority of Americans never use, own or display a firearm.\n\nCertainly when you are talking about OWNERSHIP you are wrong.  Nearly half\nof your fellow citizens own one or more firearms.  \n\n\nPlease provide a list of other means that are as effective.  Then you might \nconvince your local police departments to switch.  Good luck.

Flame on!!\n\nIs this guy serious????\n\nIf he would ever really pay attention to the news (oops I forgot that the media\n   for the most part loves to jump right on top of a story before all the facts \n   are known, as well as to manipulate what we see and thus what we believe). \n   Any ways one of Koresh's DEVOTED followers that DID I REPEAT DID survive this\n   "GENOCIDAL MASS-SLAUGHTER OF INNOCENT PEOPLE".  Besides there are nine \n   survivors in the burn-unit of the local hospital and was reported that David\n   was in one of the towers when the shit hit the fan.  Besides, a majority of \n   these children were children that he was supposed to have been the father of,\n   this then makes them bastard children to a sacraligious zeloit (sp).

i]>>Since there was no sniper fire, doing nothing was equally effective,\n\nWhat sources did Sauter and Hines use?  In Congressional hearings\nlater, the newspaper folk admitted that their reports were completely\nwrong.  (Some of their excuses are understandable, while others amount\nto gross negligence.  Then there's their "we lied".)  As far as I\nknow, they never did the followup.\n\n\nI don't have any relevant knowledge about the counter-sniper tactics\nor what the govt did with the big war toys.  That's why I've only\ncommented on what they couldn't have accomplished, no matter what\nthey did.\n\n\nNot in Detroit, not during the 60s.  That's newspaper copy and they\nadmitted later that they were wrong.\n\n-andy
We all know this will never happen.  Because the Police are under the wings\nof Government, they will always be considered more important than Citizens.\n\nGovernment pens, pencils and paper are considered more important than\nCitizens.
This is about the third person who's parroted the FBI's line about the\nfires being set "six hours after the tear gas was injected."  Suppose you\nwant to explain to us the videotape footage shown on national TV last night\nin which a tank with the gas-injecting tubes is pulling its injection tubes\nout of the second story of a building as the building begins to belch smoke\nand then fire?\n\nDo tell.
A few comments on the ATF's botched handling of this case:\n\n1. Attempting to storm the compound in broad daylight?  The explanation\n   we were given (at least at one point) was that they thought the cult\n   members would be at religious services.  My only comment on this bit\n   of idiocy is that if you're going to operate as a quasi-military unit,\n   you'd better understand basic military tactics.  One cardinal rule\n   is that only a fool plans an operation where if one assumption is\n   incorrect, the operation will fail disastrously.\n\n2. We were told that ATF got four agents killed because they were\n   outgunned, they didn't expect such heavy resistance.  When\n   questioned about why such an overwhelming military-style assault\n   was planned, we were told that it was because the cultists were\n   thought to be heavily armed.  Can you say contradictory?  I knew\n   you could!\n\n3. The BATF has had a bad reputation for years as a bunch of arrogant,\n   hotdoggers.  I was talking to relatives a couple of weeks ago and\n   referred to them as a bunch of Crockett and Tubbs wannabes.  I'm\n   more than ever convinced that's right on target.  An anecdote not\n   related to the Waco fiasco is that apparently the BATF screwed up\n   some of the evidence in the World Trade Center bombing.  There's\n   now an excellent chance some of the forensic evidence gathered by\n   the FBI will not be admissible in court.  This is not hearsay.  I\n   was told this by a relative of my wife's who happens to be an FBI\n   agent.  His opinion of the BATF was, ummm, well, let's just say\n   uncomplimentary.\n\n4. I have *still* not been presented with one iota of evidence that\n   the BD's had *any* of the alleged illegal weaponry which was the\n   reason for the raid in the first place.  BTW, we're *still* hearing\n   this justification.  AG Reno, on CNN yesterday, made references\n   to this issue, without any substantiation.  She also waved around\n   the "He's a child abuser and we heard he was beating the children!"\n   flag.  Sigh.\n\n5. A point re the Feds in general: their handling of the whole siege\n   reflected a complete lack of understanding of the probable thought\n   processes of the cultists.  AG Reno said they pushed the button\n   because they were afraid a mass suicide was in the offing.  My\n   only comment on that is that if the cultists were that close to\n   the edge, what the hell did she think their reaction would be to\n   an hours-long assault on the compound where holes were punched in\n   the walls and CS gas pumped in?  If I were a BD, I'd expect the\n   forces of the godless government to assault me at any time.  In\n   that light, whether they torched themselves or drank Jim Jones\n   Kool-Aid is irrelevant.  Also, look at how the siege was conducted:\n   Bright lights, loud rock music, cutting off communications and\n   other contact with the outside.  All measures designed to make the\n   BD's feel more and more isolated and threatened.  This might have\n   been a great strategy - if they were dealing with criminals.  As it\n   was, it looks to me like everything they did fed into Koresh's\n   paranoid delusions.\n\n\n\n\n-- \n\n#include <std_disclaimer.h>
Posted by Cathy Smith for L. Neil Smith\n\n                           WEIRD SCIENCE\n\nEveryone knows how to tell when a politician is lying:  his lips \nmove.  What may not be equally obvious is that there are \npoliticians and then there are politicians -- and that the phrase \n"political science" is subject to more than one interpretation.  \n\nYears ago, we heard how "scientists" were worried that a new Ice \nAge might be coming, and later on that "nuclear winter" -- smoke \nand dust thrown into the atmosphere by full-scale international \nunpleasantness -- was a possibility.  Something like that may even \nhave killed the dinosaurs.  \n\nWhat we didn't hear was that no actual data supported any of this, \nthat real-world events (the burning of Kuwaiti oil fields) tended \nto discredit it, that mostly it was propaganda meant to weaken \nvalues that made America the most successful culture in history, \nand that the dinosaurs probably died of something like the Plague \nwhen continents drifted together, exposing them to new germs.  \n\nWe miss a lot like this, unless we listen closely.  Prince William \nSound, site of the famous oil spill, and Mount St. Helen's weren't \nsupposed to recover from their respective disasters for at least \n100 years.  That turned out not to be true, although you'd never \nknow it from watching network nightly news or CNN.  It doesn't fit \ntheir agenda to inform us that the earth is vast and resilient, and \nthat nature is rougher on herself than we could ever be.  \n\nBut for once, the media aren't entirely to blame.  As ignorant of \nscience as they are of everything, they trust "scientists" to \nunscrew the inscrutable.  The trouble is that today's "scientists" \nhave agendas of their own.  \n\nNobody in government, that wellspring of scientific wherewithal, is \ngoing to offer grants to an investigator who states truthfully that \nthere is no respectable evidence for "global warming".  The money \nand power for bureaucrats and politicians lie in mass transit, and \nthey hate the automobile -- blamed as a major cause of the mythical \ncrisis -- as a source of privacy and freedom they find intolerable.  \n\nThe same appears true of "acid rain", a deliberate hoax cooked up \nby the Environmental Protection Agency (which hates private \nindustrial capitalism almost as much as it does your car) and \nfoisted on real scientists through trickery which has depended on \nspecialists in different fields not talking to each other much.  \n\nThe list goes on, always with a common, disreputable thread.  \n"Ozone depletion", for which evidence is even more suspect and \ncontradictory than for acid rain or global warming, is no more than \na last, desperate attempt to indict private capitalism in an era \nwhen state central planning and the command economy have failed and \ncan only find this final, withered leg to teeter on.  \n\nDecades of anti-nuclear alarmism, resting on foundations of myth \nand panic-mongering, have failed to erase the fact that nuclear \npower is the safest, cleanest, most efficient source of energy \nknown to mankind -- and more to the point, that the greater amount \nof energy there is available to any individual in society, the \nfreer that individual -- and his society -- become.  \n\nHonest studies on the effects of individual gun ownership and \nself-defense on crime -- conducted by investigators who began as \nideological opponents to those concepts, but which show massive \nreductions in the latter to be the result of the former -- have \nbeen suppressed, most recently by the California state government.  \n\nAnd what the media didn't say about recent EPA "discoveries" on the \neffect of "secondhand smoking" is that, although some harm to non-\nsmokers may have been detected, it was less (by an order or two of \nmagnitude) than that associated with frying bacon a couple times a \nweek or keeping a pet bird.  It's enough to make you wonder whether \nthere was ever anything to the claim that smoking causes cancer.  \n\nThat, of course, is the real threat represented by politically \ncorrect science.  The world is a dangerous place.  It would be nice \nto know the hazards.  I've never believed smoking to be a healthy \npractice, but, given a lack of credibility on the part of today's \nscience, how am I to decide what to do about it?  Nicotine is \nhighly addictive, to that much I can attest from experience.  Yet \nthe stress of quitting may be riskier than to continue.  There \nisn't any way to tell, thanks to the corrupting influence of \ngovernment money on the scientific establishment.  \n\nTwo centuries ago, the Founding Fathers spared us certain agonies \nto which every other nation in the world has been subject at one \ntime or another, by creating a legal barrier between politics and \nreligion.  Each time some short-sighted individual or group has \ntried to lower the barrier (most recently over the issue of \nabortion), blood -- real human blood, hot and smoking in the street \n-- has wound up being shed.  \n\nReal human blood is being shed over scientific issues, as people's \nlives are ruined through the loss, to agencies like the EPA, of \nlivelihood, or property it may have taken a lifetime to accumulate, \nto diseases caused by toxins associated with burning fossil fuels \nfor electrical power, or thanks to bans on things like cyclamates, \nwhen they die from the effects of obesity.  \n\nWhat we need now, if we hope to survive as a civilization for two \nmore centuries, is another barrier, a Constitutional separation of \nstate and science -- including medicine.  Knowledge is valuable; \nreal science won't languish for lack of funding.  The money will \nsimply come from contributors unwilling to pay for lies, and \neveryone will benefit.  \n\nL.

If you haven't heard yet, US Senator Patty Murrey, a Mom in\ntennis shoes, is planning to introduce legislation to tax\nall handgun transactions and increase dealer licnese costs in\norder to raise money to cover the costs of un-insured shooting\nvictums.  She plans to start with $2500.00 per year dealer fees\nand $40.00 or so, depending on the type of firearm, per gun\ntransaction.  She plans to make it federal.\n   She was elected in Washington state under the trade mark as\njust a mom in tennis shoes.  She can be written to via the\nUnited States Senate, Washinton DC.  She is looking for your\ntennis shoes.  So if you have a pair please send them to her\nwith your feelings regarding this tax.  \n   She claims she has heard little from the opposition.\n\nLets inundate her!
Well, let me see.  UZI, no.  M-11/9, no.  M-16/AR-15, maybe.  I remember there\nbeing a selector swtich on the AR-15.  If I remember correctly (please correct\nme if I'm wrong) the switch would set to an "off" position or an "on" position\nbecause the gun (AR-15) is semi-automatic.  Wouldn't the M-16 have a position\nfor semi-auto fire and full-auto fire (or maybe 3 round bursts)?  If this is\ncorrect wouldn't it be easy to distinguish each gun by this alone?  Of course\nif the AR-15 were modified to full-auto fire I wouldn't think it would be that\neasy but I'm talking about distinguishing between an unmodified AR-15 and M-16.\nHow about the other guns?  Do they also have selector switch to switch between\nsemi-auto and fully-auto fire?\n\n\n\n\nActually it was pretty hard for the kids in my neighborhood to figure that out\nas Richard Petty lived in my neighborhood and left his stock car in the \ndriveway. ;-)\n\n\n\nWell, what about what I said above?  If that is correct I guess TV would be\nacceptable (if you had a good enough picture and a picture of the lower \nreceiver of the AR-15/M-16).
There is no law prohibiting having biological weapons or nerve gas\non his/her property, or even walking on government property with such\nitems: ipso facto it is now one's _RIGHT_ to have such weapons of\n"mass destruction."\n\nHell, the U.S. patent office has patents on the manufacture of nerve\ngas that anyone can obtain simply by sending a $1.50 to the Patent\nOffice in Washington, D.C. (P.O. Box 8). These same patents are\nverboten to English citizens from their own patent office, which doesn't\nsurprise me based on the mistrust of the UK government against private\nownership of semi-automatic rifles.
This, at least, has already been determined: The Blue Cross medical\ncoverage for all federal employees is a good model for a future\nnational system. To get emergency medical care, anyone so insured\nmust always carry their Blue Cross card. Before entering a hospital,\nyou must notify Blue Cross, or they will refuse to pay your bills. \nIn an emergency, where you must be treated before notifying them, \nyou must inform them within 24 hours or (if you are unable to do\nso for medical reasons) the hospital must. Failing to do so within\n24 hours means they will not cover the hospitalization. In you need\nyour card to notify them (and without the card, the hospital certainly\nwouldn't know they had to.) Therefore, you are required to carry\nthe card at all times, or do without emergency medical coverage.

Here is what is says about its character:\n\n	 To oblige the great body of the yeomanry, and of the other classes\n	 of the citizens, to be under arms for the purpose of going through\n	 military exercises and evolutions, as often as might be necessary to\n	 acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the\n	 character of a well-regulated militia, \n\nIt also talks about the "well regulated militia" having a nationally\nuniform in structure and disipline.  \n\nI will note you did quote the end of this particular paragraph which states:\n\n    	Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with\n	respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed\n	and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it\n	will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of\n	a year.\n\nBut, do you knew how much organization is required to training a large\ngroup of poeple twice a year.  Just to try to get the same people\nevery year, provide a basic training to new people so they can\nbe integrated into the force, and find a suitable location, it \nrequires a continually standing committee of organizers.  \n\nSince a well regulate militia is nationally uniform in structure and\ndisipline, and meet once or twice a year to train, how can you claim\na "well regulated militia" is not well organized.  But I will concide \na "well organized militia" is not necessarily a "well regulated militia." \n\nSeveral people have stated that the "well organized militia" is\nwhat is defined under 10 USC 311, which states\n\n	The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied \n	males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in \n	section 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, \n	or who have made a declaration of intention to become, \n	citizens of the United States and of female citizents of \n	the United States who are commissioned officers of the \n	National Guard.\n\nThis deos define the militia, but were is the adjective "well regulated."\n10 USC 311 does not define a "well regualed militia" in any way, shape, \nor form.  It only defines who can become part of a well regulated militia\nThe Federalist Papers CLEARLY define the "well regualed militia" as a\nproper SUBSET of the militia.  In the same paragraph quoted above, it\ntalk above "disciplining all the militia of the United States" so they\nfit the "character of a well-regulated militia."  This is what the\nparagraph states about the associated costs:\n\n	It would form an annual deduction from the productive labor \n	of the country, to an amount which, calculating upon the \n	present numbers of the people, would not fall far short \n	of the whole expense of the civil  establishments of all \n	the States. To attempt a thing which would abridge the \n	mass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent,\n	would be unwise: and the experiment, if made, could not \n	succeed, because it would not long be endured.\n\n\nAnother quote provide by Charles Scripter is:\nJames Madison, Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the "General Welfare" clause): \n	"Nothing is more natural nor common than first\n	to use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a\n	recital of particulars."\n\nSo the phrase "the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall \nnot be infringed" must either qualify or explain the phrase "a well \nregulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state."  \nThe definition of "explain" as stated in "The American Hertitage\nDictionary of the Enlish Language" The New College Edition, 1982 is:\n	1) To make plain or comprehensible; remove obscruity from;\n	   elucidate: "It was the economists who undertook to explain \n	   this puzzle"\n	2) To define; explicate; expound: He explained his plan.\n	3) To offer reasons for or a cause of; an answer for' justify:\n	   explain an error\nThe second phrase clearly does not "explain" the first, therefore\nthe second phrase must "qualify" the first.  The definition given\nfor "qualify" is:\n	1) To describe by enumerating the characteristics or qualities\n	   of; characterize.\n	2) To make competent or suitable for office, position, or \n	   task.\n	3) To give legal power to; make legally capable.\n	4) To modify, limit, or restrict, as giving exceptions.\n	5) To make less harsh or severe; moderate\n	6) Grammar: To modify the meaning of (a word or phrase)\nSince "the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be\ninfringed" does not describe, modify or make less harsh anything and\nit has nothing to do with grammar or some sort of position or task.\nBy process of elimination it must fall into definition #3.  And since\n#3 deals with legal power, the same thing the Constitution does, it\nmust be the correct definition in this case.  Therefore, "the right \nof the people to keep and bear Arms" gives legal power to the "well \nregualated militia" and this legal power "shall not be infringed".  \n\nI thank you very much Mr Scripter, you have provided me with more \nevidence that the Second Amendment only concerns itseft with the \npeople's right to form well regulate militia, and says very little \nabout the right of an untrained person to "keep and bear" a .50 caliber\nmachine gun.  And since I, totally untrained in the use of any firearm\n(something I personly have meant to correct by going to a NRA gun\nsafety course and joining a gun club), cannot legally buy such a machine\ngun, I conclude the courts and democraticly elected congress agree with\nme.\n\n-> So now we know which category Mr. Rutledge is in; He means to destroy\n-> our Liberties and Rights.\n\nI mean "to destory our Liberties and Rights."  Is that why a participate\nin the discussion of exactly what "our Libertues and Rights" are?  I \nforce my version of "our Liberties and Rights" by begining statements\nof what "our Liberties and Rights" with "All that the Second Amendment \nclearly states to me."   Using expressions, such as "states to me," \nclearly mean I intend to force my views on others?  I don't think so.\n\nSo in effort not to force my views and not "to destory our Liberties and\nRights,"  I state that nothing I have written, or will write, in\nthe matter of "Liberties and Rights" is the final word.  For I am only\none person among many and the final word on "Liberties and Rights" cleary\nand irrevocably belongs to the many.

This is not borne out of reality; the old Soviet Union had a very\nserious domestic handgun and submachinegun trade, guns that were\nof commercial grade because they were produced in honest-to-goodness\nmachineshops. Why would all production have to be local; don't we\nhave a road system that is the envy of the world?\n\nI seem to recall incidents in the past where Chinese entreprenaurs\nattempted to smuggle AK-47s (semi-autos) into this country to\nget around import number limitations (May have been Gunweek where\nI read that years ago...)\n\nAny person with high-school drafting skills and vocational school\nmachineshop training could produce a submachinegun. You talk about\nthe average person not being able get even a zip-gun; well now, think\nof all that private CNC controlled machinery that is not being used for\n3 shifts a day; do you think that if guns were being sold on the\nblack market for say, $150, an enterprising mechanical engineer\ncould be using that machinery to produce workable submachineguns\nfor sale? After all, GUNWEEK had an article and pictures on how BATF\nwas looking for the manufacturer of quite efficient silencers that\nwere of commercial quality and finish.
.\n.\n. \n \nAre you sure about this? I'm currently looking at a copy of last \nThursday's SF Chronicle and there is the typical one column Traders\nad on page C7 in the Sports section.

But I'd be surprised if there wasn't a Traders ad in it.\nIt's probably worth it to write to the Chronicle (and other papers)\nanyway, because all their anti-gun editorials are disgusting.\n\nBy the way, let me put in a plug for Traders.

We've heard a lot of talk about brainwashing in Waco but the brainwashing\nof the general population never ceases to amaze me. Here is an\nexample of action being taken which results in the worst possible\noutcome and despite people's deep intuition telling them something\nis wrong the programming will still cut in and say that the\nagents probably acted in good faith. NO THEY DIDN'T. They either did\nnot have enough information to act in good faith or else they acted\nknowing the risk. Sums up human stupidity all over and one of these\ndays it will destroy the fucking planet: "Oh sorry. Didn't think they\nwould respond by launching a strike. All our best calculations told\nus they were bluffing."
By this, do you mean that you consider it absolutely impossible for the\nmedia to be guilty of hypocrisy?\n\nNote that the film industry in California traded their political support\nfor an "assault weapon" ban in the state for an amendment to the bill\nexempting the entertainment industry from that very ban.\n\nNote that the very issue of the Batman comic book ("Seduction of the Gun")\nthat was produced as a tool for gun-control organizations carries a back-\npage ad for a "Terminator II" video game extolling the numerous and\nvaried sophisticated weapons available to the player.\n\nNote that Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, publisher of the NY Times -- one of the\noldest and most incessant gun-control grinders -- himself carries a\nconcealed handgun.\n\nStill, you find it completely incredible that these folks live by the \naphorism, "Do as I say, and not as I do."\n--
And who is responsible for it not happening?\nCertainly not the children.  Koresh was calling the shots.  He was \ntalking with his lawyer and the FBI.  Since others were released safely, \nthere is no sane reason for keeping the children inside the compound.\n\n\nNot at all.  Are you a Koresh worshiper?\n\n\nThanks for my laugh of the day!  Definitely a very silly supposition.\n\n\nI would if I could.  The news show that showed the lengthy excerpts also \nhad interviews with the filmmaker who made the documentary who basically \nconfirmed what was shown in the excerpts from the time he spent at the \ncompound in 1992.\n\n\nI believe that this was reported by local radio reporters on site.\nA fire started in a three story tower at the same time as the two \nstory window shown on the tv coverage.\n\n\nI thought about mentioning how Reagan and the military treated the press \nin Grenada and how that set the precedent, but decided it wasn't worthy \nof discussion.  If the news reporter got shot, you can bet his family \nwould sue the government for letting him into the danger area.\n\nThe root cause of suspicion in my mind is why 100 people wouldn't flee \na building that had numerous exits during the 30 minutes time it took \nto burn down.  Or why didn't they flee hours earlier when the tear gas was \nfirst introduced?  I can find no rational explanation for their behavior.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nI watched the CNN report and I never heard them report that the ATF started the\nfire.  They did speculate that the type of CS gas might have _accidentaly_\nstarted the fire.  \n\n                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nFrom my understanding of the CNN report it was 6 HOURS after they started.\n\n              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nThe track vehicle that I saw in the vicinity of the building where fire was \nfirst noticed looked more like an armored recovery vehicle (the type used to \ntow tanks of battle fields) and not an armored flame-thrower vehicle.\n\n                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nAs someone else has pointed out, why would the stove be in use on a warm day  \nin Texas.

Does anyone really believe the Swiss have had no war within their borders\nbecause every adult male owns a rifle? I'm a great admirer of the Swiss, but\n500 years of peace on their turf has zilch to do with gun ownership.

Sure. \nHitler stayed out of Switzerland because the Swiss run the money in this\nworld. We'd do well to emulate them on that and forget about getting more\nrifles on the street.

Title 18, 241 and/or 242 seem to apply.  241 is conspiracy (two or\nmore persons) against rights of citizens.  242 is deprivation of\nrights under color of law.

I was shocked to see that the subject of my last rely to awesley was\n"Luser!"  That was certainly not my intention.  I meant to leave the\nsubject line unchanged.

I wrote :\n  Nice strawman indeed.  The discussion is not about whether there were\ntanks\n  used in sixties riots; instead, it is about whether those tanks fired\ntheir\n  main guns in one of those riots.  You claim they did.  That claim is\n  ludicrous.\n\nAwesley replied:\n     I repeated what I had been told, under what context I had heard it,\n  supporting the claim that tanks were indeed used in Detroit in 67.\n\nThe issue has never been whether tanks were used in Detroit in 1967.  It\nhas been whether they fired their main guns.  You did not merely claim that\ntanks were used--you claimed that they fired their main guns to suppress\nsniper fire and that they were "quite" effective at this.  You continue to\nback away from this claim and defend something else that nobody is\ndisputing.\n\nAwesley went on:\n  I\n  spent a few minutes in a library today -- found their computer was\n  down and they don't have a card catalog.  Anyway, it took about 10\n  minutes to find this in _Nightmare in Detroit, A Rebellion and It's\n  Victims_ by Sauter and Hines, on page 133, telling of the death of\n  Tonia Blanding, age 4.\n   \n        "When the tank was fired upon by snipers it turned in the direction\n  the shots came from. [...] the fifty-caliber machine gun mounted on the\n  tank belched fire into the buildings.  After a short round into the front\n  of the buildings, the tank guns spit again, tearing apart huge holes out\n  of the side of the apartment."\n  \n       Well, it's not the main gun.  \n\n"Well, it's not the main gun."  Gee, that's only the entire point.  Are you\nnow going to admit that you were wrong?\n\n  will I see any pictures of tanks firing their main\n  guns?  Will I see pictures of buildings damaged by the shells?  Will I\nread\n  the reports of the tank fire?  I'll bet you dollar to doughnuts I won't. \n  It will take more than second-hand accounts from a few old National Guard\n  sergeants shooting the shit to convince me that tanks shelled American\n  cities in the Sixties.\n\nAwesley replied:\n    Well, if you bothered to read them, it wouldn't take long at all to\n  find reports of tank * fire * -- although not necessarily of the main\n  guns.\n\nI will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the '67\nriots.  There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place\nwithout it being common knowledge even 26 years later.  The American\nmilitary firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have\nbeen *big* news.\n\nAwesley goes on:\n  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.\n\nTo fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion\ngrenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be\nperfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since\nit makes your other claim seem more plausible.\n\nAnd on:\n  I don't\n  expect to convince you; you'll have to open your mind and eyes and\nactually\n  do a little research to be convinced one way or the other.  Let me know\n  what you find.\n\nI already know what you found: nothing.  If I claimed that the Marines used\nF-4s to launch rockets at buildings in Trenton, New Jersey would you\nbelieve me?  Would you suspend judgment until you had a chance to research\nit?  Or would your bullshit filters kick in?\n\nIf tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been\nscreaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about\nit.  Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up. \nIf your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I prefer\nto live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that\nthose tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.
Not to mention last year's Weaver affair.\n\nAnyway, here's how I see the Waco affair; I'd be interested in other peoples'\ninterpretations...\n\n1. Koresh and his people were basically minding their own business.\n2. Some weapons violations may have been committed and I wouldn't have\n   disapproved of prosecuting him for those violations.  However, I think\n   the BATF was criminal for starting negotiations with a military style\n   assault and for firing into a house where there were children and other\n   noncombatants.\n3. I don't see they couldn't just leave a token guard on the place and wait\n   the BDs out; I don't approve of the tear gas approach and, if it caused\n   the fire to be started, I think the FBI agent responsible should spend\n   10-20 years in jail.\n4. However, if Koresh's response to the tear gas was to kill everyone there,\n   I hold him largely responsible for their deaths.
So, like, what do you do during those six months to be "active?"\nMy town has a similar requirement, and it's rather stupid.  Before\nyou can buy a handgun, you have to be an active member of a gun club.\nWell, how active can you be without a gun, chief?\n\nMost gun owners feel a check of criminal records for crimes and mental\ndisorders would be a very good thing -- IF it couldn't be abused by the\ngovernment.  But every time this is proposed, there is always some\ntrapdoor by which the government can deny your purchase EVEN IF you\nare perfectly qualified to own a gun.  And we oppose this.\n\n\nSince the fatal accident rate for licensed automobile drivers in the US \nis around 50 times the fatal accident rate of largely unlicensed gun\nowners, I'd think twice before using this analogy.\n\nBesides, the problem is criminal use of guns, not accidents.  (There\nare about 500,000 criminal uses of guns in the US every year -- but\nonly 1,400 accidents.)  I don't think it's necessary to spend a lot\nof energy making sure a criminal CAN shoot a gun before he gets one.\n\nJust like the check, most gun owners feel positively about requiring\nsafety courses -- IF they couldn't be abused by the government.  But \nthey already have!  One state doesn't hold the courses, another doesn't \nfund them, a third holds them only once a year with limited attendence \nto those with political connections.  Is this fair?\n\n\nAnd how many of them acquire these guns from legal retail outlets?\nHow many are borrowed, stolen, smuggled, bought on the black market?\n\n\nSome states allow ONLY open carry.  Some allow ONLY concealed carry.\nSome allow both.  Some allow both, but require licenses for concealed \ncarry.  All you can say is if one of these modes has a clear advantage\nover another in terms of reducing crime or any other public good,\nthen state legislators SOMEPLACE are doing exactly the wrong thing.\nWhich means that they really don't have any objective reasons for \nthese laws other than their preferences -- a bad way to govern.\n\n\n("Hot-livered."  I LOVE that expression.  Here, we say "hot-headed.")\n\n\nTypically, the only criminals who can affect the rights of ALL the other\npeople are criminals in government offices.  The rest of our criminals\naffect the rights of only one or a few people at a time, and they do this\nduring the commission of a crime.  POSSESSION of a gun by someone hurts\nNO ONE else.  It is when they do something violent with that gun that\nthe crime occurs.  Of course, it is a crime for a felon or ex-felon to\npossess a gun, but we don't feel it is right to treat common citizens\nwho have lived good lives as if they were just "pre-felons" waiting to\ncommit crimes.\n\n\nI don't understand this sentence.\n\n\nLife isn't fair.  I shouldn't need a fire extinguisher either, or\nflood and theft insurance, or to lock the doors of my house and car.\nBut pining for a better world won't do anything to address what I have\nto do to live in this one.\n\n\nNone of ours, I'm sure.\n\n\nFrankly, I'm not sure I know what good a driver's license does anyone,\neither.  The people who drive safely never use it, and the people who \ndrive drunk, drive without it!\n\nHowever, a car is a good tool, but not one that protects my right to life.\nI rank the right to life somewhere north of the right to travel freely.\n\n\nThe question is not whether or not you want to own guns personally.  It's\nwhether or not you think that ALL people should be forced to do as you do.\nI don't have any problem with someone who says they would never own a gun.\nI do have a problem with someone who says I should be prevented from owning\none, too.\n--

Ok, here goes.  Yes folks, I realize I have stuck my foot in my mouth\nquite a few times already so please let me make some clarifications.  My\ninaccurate information in my posts was due to lack of knowledge.  Thanks\nto you kind (and some not so kind) people I am learning.   Some people\nhave given me several good points to ponder and I see how I was wrong.\nIn no way was this inaccurate information supposed to be trying to\nfurther the anti-gun cause.  I have said several times before (but\nnobody seemed to be listening) that I am pro-gun and anti-gun-control.\n\nAs far as the race can of worms that I have opened up I have only one\nthing to say - I am in no way prejudiced.  Some of the things I have\nstated were said to demonstrate that I am not prejudiced and/or a racist\nbut I have been accused of being too aware of race and prejudiced.  I will not\nsay anymore about that subject because no matter what I say it will be the\nwrong thing.\n\nBoy, what a start to being on a new group.  Oh well, things have been\nworse in my life.\n\nI hope this clears things up but I guess that will remain to be seen.\n\nBy for now,
From: "Preston K. Covey" <covey+@andrew.cmu.edu>\nSubject: Gun Stats & Mortal Risks\nDate: Mon, 15 Feb 1993 18:35:05 -0500 (EST)\n\n\nFolks,\n\nHail from the nether world.  On February 4th, the Wall Street Journal\ncarried a front-page article by Erik Larson entitled "Armed Force."  I\nfelt a reply was in order to his citation of the notorious scare stat\nthat "A Gun is 43 times more likely to kill than to protect."  I sent\nthe following to the WSJ.\n\n-----\n\nGun Stats & Mortal Risks\n\nPreston K. Covey\n\n\n	Erik Larson~s even-handed article on Paxton Quigley (~Armed Force,~\n2/4/93, WSJ) cites the world~s most notorious ~statistic~ regarding guns\nin the home:  ~A pioneering study of residential gunshot deaths in King\nCounty, Washington, found that a gun in the home was 43 times more\nlikely to be used to kill its owner, spouse, a friend or child than to\nkill an intruder.~  The ~43 times~ stat is everywhere these days;  it\nhas grown in media lore like the proverbial urban myth: it was inflated\nby one pugilistic talk-show pundit to ~93.~  Given the shock value of\nthe finding, the conclusion of the 1986 New England Journal of Medicine\n(NEJM) study is remarkably understated:  ~The advisability of keeping\nfirearms in the home for protection must be questioned.~ \n \n	Responsible people should indeed question the risks and benefits of\nbringing a firearm into their home.   But what we need to know is this: \nWhat exactly are the risks and benefits?  The NEJM testimony is neither\nthe whole truth about the benefits nor nothing but the truth about the\nrisks.  Further, as with motor vehicles, we want to know:  What control\ndo we have over the risks and benefits?  And, as with the risks of\ncancer or heart disease or auto accidents:  How can we minimize the\nrisks?  Like raw highway death tolls, the NEJM stat is not very helpful\nhere. \n\n	The NEJM finding purports to inform us, but it is framed to warn us\noff.  It is widely promulgated in the media as a ~scare stat,~ a\nmisleading half-truth whose very formulation is calculated to prejudice\nand terrify.  The frightful statistic screams for itself:  The risks far\noutweigh the benefits, yes?   What fool would run these risks?   If your\ncar were 43 times more likely to kill you, a loved one, a dear friend or\nan innocent child than to get you to your destination,  should you not\ntake the bus?  \n\n	Uncritical citation puts the good name of statistics in the bad company\nof lies and damned lies.   Surely, we can do better where lives are at\nstake.   Let~s take a closer look at this risky business:\n\n	The ~43 times~ stat of the NEJM study is the product of dividing the\nnumber of home intruders/aggressors justifiably killed in self-defense\n(the divisor) into the number of family members or acquaintances  killed\nby a gun in the home (the dividend).  The divisor of this risk equation\nis 9: in the study~s five-year sample there were 2 intruders and 7 other\ncases of self-defense.  The dividend is 387:  in the study there were 12\naccidental deaths, 42 criminal homicides, and 333 suicides.  387 divided\nby 9 yields 43.  There were a total of 743 gun-related deaths in King\nCounty between 1978 and 1983,  so the study leaves 347 deaths outside of\nhomes unaccounted.\n\n	The NEJM~s notorious ~43 times~ statistic is seriously misleading on\nsix counts:\n\n	1.  The dividend is misleadingly characterized in the media:  the ~or\nacquaintances~ of the study (who include your friendly drug dealers and\nneighborhood gang members) is equated to ~friends.~  The implication is\nthat the offending guns target and kill only beloved family members,\ndear friends, and innocent children.  Deaths may all be equally tragic,\nbut the character and circumstance of both victims and killers are\nrelevant to the risk.  These crucial risk factors are masked by the\ncalculated impression that the death toll is generated by witless\nWaltons shooting dear friends and friendly neighbors.  This is\ncriminological hogwash.\n\n	2.   The study itself does not distinguish households or environs\npopulated by people with violent, criminal, or substance-abuse histories\n-- where the risk of death is very high -- versus households inhabited\nby more civil folk (for example, people who avoid high-risk activities\nlike drug dealing, gang banging and wife beating) -- where the risk is\nvery low indeed.  In actuality, negligent adults allow fatal but\navoidable accidents; and homicides are perpetrated mostly by people with\nhistories of violence or abuse, people who are identifiably and\ncertifiably at ~high risk~ for misadventure.  To ignore these obvious\nrisk factors in firearm accidents and homicides is as misleading as\nignoring the role of alcohol in vehicular deaths: by tautology, neither\ngun deaths nor vehicular deaths would occur without firearms or\nvehicles; but the person and circumstance of the gun owner or driver\ncrucially affect the risk. \n\n	3.  One misleading implication of the way the NEJM stat is framed is\nthat the mere presence of a gun in the home is much more likely to kill\nthan to protect, and this obscures -- indeed, disregards -- the role of\npersonal responsibility.  The typical quotation of this study (unlike\nLarson~s) attributes fatal agency to the gun:  ~A gun in the home is 43\ntimes as likely to kill . . . .~  (The Center to Prevent Handgun\nViolence, a major promulgator of the NEJM statistic, uses this\nparticular formulation.)  We can dispense with the silly debate about\nwhether it~s people or guns that accomplish the killing:  again, by\ntautology, gun  deaths would not occur without the guns.  The question\nbegged is how many deaths would occur anyway, without the guns.  In any\ncase, people are the death-dealing agents, the guns are their lethal\ninstruments.  The moral core of the personal  risk factors in gun deaths\nare personal responsibility and choice.  Due care and responsibility\nobviate gun accidents; human choice mediates homicide and suicide (by\ngun or otherwise).  The choice to own a gun need not condemn a person to\nNEJM~s high-risk pool.  The gun does not create this risk by itself. \nPeople have a lot to say about what risk they run with guns in their\nhomes.  For example, graduates of Paxton Quigley~s personal protection\ncourse do not run the touted ~43 times~ risk any more than skilled and\nsober drivers run the same risks of causing or suffering vehicular death\nas do reckless or drunk drivers.  Undiscriminating actuarials disregard\nand obscure the role of personal responsibility and choice, just as they\ndisregard and obscure the role of socio-economic, criminological and\nother risk-relevant factors in firearm-related death.  This is why we\nresent insurance premiums and actuarial consigment to risk pools whose\nnorms disregard our individualities.  Fortunately, nothing can consign\nus to the NEJM risk pool but our own lack of choice or responsibility in\nthe matter.\n\n	4.  Suicide accounts for 84% of the deaths by gun in the home in the\nNEJM study.  As against the total deaths by gun in King County,\nincluding those outside the home, in-house suicides are 44% of the total\ndeath toll, which is closer to the roughly 50% proportion found by other\nstudies.  Suicide is a social problem of a very different order from\nhomicide or accidents.  The implication of the NEJM study is that these\nsuicides might not occur without readily available guns.  It is true\nthat attempted suicide by gun is likely to succeed.  It is not obviously\ntrue that the absence of a gun would prevent any or all of these\nsuicides.  This is widely assumed or alleged, but the preponderance of\nresearch on guns and suicide actually shows otherwise, that this is\nwishful thinking in all but a few truly impulsive cases.  (See:  Bruce\nL. Danto et al., The Human Side of Homicide,  Columbia University Press,\n1982;  Charles Rich et al.,  ~Guns and Suicide,~  American Journal of\nPsychiatry,  March 1990.)  If suicides were removed from the dividend of\nthe NEJM study~s risk equation, the ~43 times~ stat would deflate to\n~six.~  The inclusion of suicides in the NEJM risk equation -- like the\ncauses, durability, or interdiction of suicidal intent itself -- is a\nprofoundly debatable matter.  Quotations of the NEJM study totally\ndisregard this issue.\n\n	5.  Citations of the NEJM study also mislead regarding the estimable\nrate of justifiable and excusable homicide.  Most measures, like the\nNEJM homicide rate, are based on the immediate disposition of cases. \nBut many homicides initially ruled criminal are appealed and later ruled\nself-defense.  In the literature on battered women, immediate case\ndispositions are notorious for under-representing the rate of\njustifiable or excusable homicide. Time~s January 18, 1993, cover story\non women ~Fighting Back~ reported one study~s finding that 40% of women\nwho appeal have their murder convictions thrown out.  Time~s July 17,\n1989, cover story on a week of gun deaths reported 51% of the domestic\ncases as shootings by abuse victims; but only 3% of the homicides were\nreported as self-defense.  In a May 14, 1990, update, Time  reported\nthat 12% of the homicides had eventually been ruled self-defense. In\nTime~s sample, the originally reported rate of self-defense was in error\nby a factor of four.  The possibility of such error is not acknowledged\nby promulgators of the NEJM statistic. \n\n	6.  While both the dividend and the product of the NEJM risk equation\nare arguably inflated, the divisor is unconscionably misleading.  The\ndivisor of this equation counts only aggressors who are killed,  not\naggressors who are successfully thwarted without being killed or even\nshot at.   The utility of armed self-defense is the other side of the\ncoin from the harms done with guns in homes.  What kind of moral idiocy\nis it to measure this utility only in terms of killings ?  Do we measure\nthe utility of our police solely in terms of felons killed  -- as\nopposed to the many many more who are otherwise foiled, apprehended, or\ndeterred?  Should we not celebrate (let alone count ) those cases where\nno human life is lost as successful armed defenses?  The question posed\nto media that cite the NEJM scare stat is this:  Why neglect the\ncompendious research on successful armed defense, notably by\ncriminologist Gary Kleck (Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America ,\nAldine de Gruyter, 1992)?\n	Kleck~s estimations of the rate and risk of defensive firearm use are\nbased on victimization surveys as well as other studies:  the rate is\nhigh (about one million a year) and the risk is good (gun defenders fare\nbetter than anyone, either those who resort to other forms of resistance\nor those who do not resist).  Dividing one million gun defenses a year\nby 30,000 annual gun deaths (from self-defense, homicides, suicides, and\naccidents) yields 33.  Thus, we can construct a much more favorable\nstatistic than the NEJM scare stat:  \n\nA gun is 33 times more likely to be used to defend against assault or\nother crime than to kill anybody.   \n\n	Of course, Kleck~s critics belittle the dividend of this calculation;\nwhat is good news for gun defenders is bad news for gun control.  We\nshould indeed question the basis and method of Kleck~s high estimation\nof defensive firearm use, as I have questioned the NEJM statistic. \nClearly, the issue of how to manage mortal risks is not settled by\nuncritical citation of statistics.   One thing troubles me still:  we\ncan hardly escape the unquestioned NEJM scare stat in our media,  but we\nhardly ever find Kleck~s good work mentioned,  even critically.
In the latest case in Denver, they were giving away tickets to a Denver\nNuggets basketball game. \n\nHow traceable is a money order?  (I don't know. Haven't used one in 20 years)\n\nIs that even an issue if the weapons aren't checked for being stolen?
So, you have the right unless the Federal Government says you don't.\nI don't think I like this very much.\n\nThis would be much better if it said "everyone except those who have\nbeen striped of this right by due process of law" or some such thing.\n\nAlso, I don't care for the Federal Government stepping on states rights\nregardless of which state right is being stepped on.  If the constitution\ndoesn't give the Feds some power then they have to just shut up about\nit.\n\nThe only way the Feds should have anything to say is if the Constitution\nprohibits localities from infringing on the RKBA.  In which case this\nbill should just reiterate that the RKBA is guaranteed by the Constitution\nand that the Feds will take appropriate action if it is infringed.
All very true.  I'm going on what I have read and heard from friends.\nBasically the Glock is great but I have heard/read that it is a lot harder to\nlearn proper handling because of the type of safety that it has.  I was\nlooking at a Glock .40S&W and the S&W 4006 a couple of weeks ago and the\nsafties on the guns were very different.  The saftey on the 4006 seemed a lot\nmore "safe"  (for lack of a better word) than the one on the Glock.  Of course\nthis could also be a bad thing if you were to pull the gun on somebody.  You\nwould spend more time fiddling around turning the safety off.  Personally I\nlike the Glocks because they are very light and I think they look really cool\n(guess that's why they use them in so many movies) but I wouldn't get one as\nmy first semi-auto because of the safety.  I would prefer more training with\na "traditional" semi-auto (ala Colt .45) but of course that's just my opinion.
That was the entire point to *you*.  What exactly did I claim?\n     --------------------------------------------------\n    "I've heard eye-witness descriptions of tanks using their main guns\n  to respond to sniper fire.  Quite effectively."\n     --------------------------------------------------\n  \n    I wasn't wrong . . . I've heard those descriptions.  If you're\n  paying attention, I've mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own\n  eyes, but the main gun firing was an account I heard.  That helps\n  people judge whether or not to kick in the, to use your words,\n  "bullshit filters".  Stating that I *claimed* this is a falsehood.\n  \nLater in the same post:\n     Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building\n  were burnt, some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember, I was and\n  am inclined to believe an old sarge or two.\n\nFine, *now* you are stating that you believe their claims (or that you are\n"inclined" to.  See below for a stronger statement of your beliefs).  Those\nclaims are still ludicrous, however.\n\nPreviously Awesley had written:\n  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.\n\nPrompting me to write:\n  To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion\n  grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be\n  perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since\n  it makes your other claim seem more plausible.\n\nTo which Awesley replied:\n  John, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you're losing it so you\n  have to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said\n  nothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you\n  need some help, let me know and I'l take your side of this for a\n  while.  You're not scoring here, you're boring here.\n\nBut why did you mention grenade launchers at all?  Because it supports the\nnotion that the tanks shelled buildings.  And it supports that notion\nbecause it conjures images of troops launching fragmentary grenades.  But\nthat too is ludicrous.\n\n  If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been\n  screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about\n  it. \n\nAwesley relied:\n     Glad to know you're such an expert.  Nice to hear some an\n  authority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it\n  had happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an\n  authority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged\n  massive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot.\n  Some claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but\n  the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was "several".  I've also\n  heard some things about that but I won't dare repeat them.  You'd\n  assert that I claimed they were truth.\n\nYes, if it happened I would have heard about it.  Everybody would have. \nArmy tanks don't fire their cannons in American cities in the 1960's\nwithout it becoming common knowledge, without minority leaders seizing on\nit and condemning it over and over again, without civil libertarians saying\n"this has gone far enough."  So, yes, my never hearing of it was the basis\nfor my disbelieving the claim.  Now I have more reasons to disbelieve it. \nNot one poster has written to say, yes, I lived in Detroit at that time and\neverybody knew that the tanks had fired shells.  This is the UseNet.  If it\nhad happened, somebody here would remember it.  Furthermore, your own\nresearch failed to come up with any support for the claim.  The claim is\nextraordinary and it has no supporting evidence, extraordinary or not. \nUnless you count the brags of a couple of guardsmen shooting the shit.  I\ndo not.\n\n  Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up. \n\n     Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the \n  difference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26 \n  years ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks.\n  So it would have been an Army cover-up.\n\nQuibble.  Fine, it was an Army cover-up.  Six years in the Reserves has\ntaught me the difference also.  But do you think that in two and half\ndecades not one guilt-ridden participant has come forward and said "yes, I\nshelled Americans," or "I gave the orders to fire the cannons," or "I\nhelped cover it up"?\n\n  If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I\nprefer\n  to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that\n  those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.\n\nAwesley replied:\n    Given the level in destruction in Detroit, I'm quite willing to believe\n  that they did fire their guns.\n\nGood.  Then we can drop the junk about you not claiming that they did. \nYour belief fails a basic reality check: why isn't it known?\n\nAwesley concludes:\n     Now then, we've bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to read\n  this far and all you've managed to say is that you don't believe the\n  account I cited.\n\nActually, now we have established that I don't believe what you believe, as\nwell as why I don't believe it.  And if it's boring, then I yield the last\nword to you, if you want it.  You may say anything you like with\nimpunity--I am dropping the subject.
What ever happened to the 'Adobe Fortress' I kept hearing about? I\nthought this was a 'Cult Stronghold'! If the kgbatf knew it was a\ntinderbox, why didn't they just have all the talking heads line up\nand start huffin' and puffin?
actions  \nthe \nthem\n\nThis is, of course, your opinion.  I differ greatly.  There can be NO doubt the  \nFBI at least shares in the blame.\n\n\n--\njmd@handheld.com
[stuff deleted]\n\n\nReally?  How do you avoid situations which encourage criminals?  I'd\nreally like to know.  Would you, say, prohibit female college\nstudents from riding their bicycles near the university during the\ndaytime?  \n\nSounds a bit drastic, doesn't it?  Especially when the university is\nlocatd in a nice residential area.  A friend of mine was attacked and\nnearly raped in just this situation.  The police didn't feel she was\nin a situation which 'encouraged criminals'.\n\nWhat do you think?  Should we just tell her, that it was her fault\nfor daring to ride a bicycle in the middle of the day?  That she\ndidn't avoid a situation that encouraged criminals?  If that's the\ncase, then we'd all better put bars on our doors and windows and\npray for a police state to keep us all safe.  Crime happens in all\nsituations - there are no defined areas that criminals avoid.
CNN just claimed he bought 104 "semi-automatic assault rifles".  And\nthey say Koresh wasn't god-like...  He managed to buy or build a\ncollection of fully-automatic semi-automatic rifles...  Quite a feat,\nI would say.  ;-)\n\nThey're still making charges of "sexual abuse" and such, or course.\nNobody seems to have noticed that the Treasury department has nothing\nto do with sex crimes.  Or maybe the feds have recently instituted a\nTAX on sex crimes...  Yeah, that's why the BATF was there, looking for\nunregistered *guns* ("this is my weapon, this is my gun, this is for\nfighting, this is for...").\n\n\nI also heard that they're claiming to be cautious because of Koresh's\n"heated ammunition stockpile".  I seem to recall that smokeless powder\ntends to decompose at even moderate temperatures.

Why?  If you're not a threat, you're not affected at all.\n\n\nWhy?  I note that the available psych info says that feelings of\nsecurity INCREASE.

"Widely reported", eh?  Remember, this has had a news blackout since day 2.\nThe FBI is the single, sole, source of these rumors.  It may be the truth, but  \nit may not be.  We may never know.  We MUST question it, though.  Why no media  \ncoverare?  What were they hiding?\n\nIt would seem so.\n\n\nThey would still be alive, today.

Why don't you call the City and ask? Oak Park also has an illegal handgun\nban as well, but does allow those with a "collectors FFL" to possess\n("collectible?") handguns.\n\n\nProbably a fine in practical terms.\n\n\nIt wouldn't impede your defense at all. There was an actual incident\nin Oak Park where a gas station owner engaged in a shootout with a\nhandgun; the grand jury decided not to presecute. On the other hand,\na black man used an illegally owned handgun in Oak Park to defend\nhimself, and the Village tried to make an example out of him. An NRA\nDirector who lived there made a stink about this, and it was decided\nnot to charge the guy. Of course, pissing off anti-gun police thugs\nhas it's own drawbacks, like when the Oak Park Police Chief came to his\nhouse, and told him: "this is stepping over the line; this could get\ndangerous for you." Whereupon the few black Oak Park police officers\nwatched over his house to ensure that the white anti-gun police chief\nand his anti-gun cronies wouldn't f*ck with him, his home or family.\n\n\nL.V.

As long as Democrats reign in Chicago, Illinois\nresidents will always be disarmed and helpless in the streets. Politicians\nget around this by provisions in the law that allow them to carry\nconcealed weapons. Voters in Chicago are too stupid to vote these a**holes\nout of office; because the Dems are always in power, the Illinois \nSupreme Court is always tilted to the Democratic Party's views on guns.\n[All candidates supported by political consultant David Axelrod are\nanti-gun, which explains anti-RKBA Crook County States Attorney \nJack(ass) O'Malley being a so-called "Republican."]

No, but I have several other breakdowns of accidental shootings.\nI've never seen one that specifically provides the info that Davis insists\nthat he has, so I'd love to have a cite.\n\n\nWrong.  There's one gun design where that can happen, and it is\nsupposed to be carried with the hammer over an unloaded chamber.\n(Cocking the gun turns the cylinder so that a loaded cylinder is under\nthe hammer.  In other words, it can be usefully carried in a safe\nmanner.)  Other handgun designs don't have that property; if their\ntrigger isn't pulled, the hammer can't hit the firing pin.\n\n\nThe breakdowns that I do have include the above category.  From them I\ncan safely say that if Davis is right in ALL of his claims, a large\nnegative number of people are killed by animals, because we know that\nthe number of killings by wackos is reasonably large and that the\nnumber of accidents due to gun failures (which is a superset of the\ndescribed circumstance) is near zero.\n\n\nPlease do.  Include a cite for those of us who like looking at\ncontext.  Make sure that your source excludes other types of\naccidents and suicides that are misreported.  ("Gun cleaning\naccident" is police-speak for "the family needs the insurance\nmoney.")\n\n-andy
I don't remember the figures EXACTLY, but there were about 3500 deaths in Texas\nin 1991 that was caused by guns.....\nThis is more than those beeing killed in car-ACCIDENTS!\n(Yes, there could be that low sentences or high poverty could influence the\nfigures but they're still *pretty* high right??)\nI also believe Texas has some of the most liberal 'gun-laws' in USA......\n\n\n*I* should not suffer because of others....\nWe all agree on this one, BUT we also live in a sociaty and therefor\nwe'll have to give up *SOME* of our 'freedom' (Note the '').\n\nDo you have an insurance??\nThen you'll have to pay because of what others do...\n\nDo you buy anything??\nYOU are paying for those who return goods, steal or even those who gets a bonus...\n\nDo you live with other people??\nThen you 'can't' do ererything you'd want (burping/farting playing music LOUD)\n\n-What the hell is he trying to say ??\nWhen you live in a society (USA are stilll counted as one...) you\nhave to saccrifice.\nThe question is HOW MUCH.\n\n\nOne state (don't remember which, Texas??) tried to impose a rule that you could\nonly buy ONE gun each MONTH. Think you all know what happened.....\n\nI respect the right to defend yourself, but that right should not inflict on\nother people.\n\nIt seems like you all realize that you have a problem in America, the only\nproblem is\nthat you won't take the car away from the drunk driver, you hope to cure him\nfirst.\n\nHope life comfirms to the standard of Winnie the Poh.\n\n\n\n	This is not a .signature.\n	It's merely a computergenerated text to waste bandwith\n	and to bring down the evil Internet.
If they hadn't killed the ATF people in the original raid, I think I would \nlaugh my ass off.  (Actually, to be honest, I still might.)
There are a few bills not yet in the archive, but these are the main ones\nwe need to fight.  And thanks to David Robinson for scanning so many of\nthem in for us!\n\nThe subdirectory bills are stored in was moved from "congress" to\n"Congress", that is:\n\ngodiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu:/usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba/Congress
: \n: I believe this raid was ill planned because they only had 2 days to plan it,\n: and it was continued when failure was obvious because it had a bit part\n: in the much larger political agenda of President Clinton. I would even \n: suggest that the loss of 4 ATF agents is inconsequential in this the\n: context of his political agenda. It MIGHT even be beneficial to his agenda, \n: as it helps point up just how evil these assualt weapons are. Further proof\n: might be that the ATF denied their agents (Street Stories report) requests\n: for sufficient fire power. \n: \n: Important dates: \n: Feb 25th - NJ assembly votes to overturn assault weapon ban.\n: Feb 28th - Compound in Waco attacked.	   \n: \n: On Feb. 25th the New Jersey assembly voted to overturn the assault weapon\n: ban in that state. It looked like it might be a tight vote, but the Senate\n: in N.J. was going to vote to overturn the ban. It would not sit well to have\n: an Eastern state overturn an assault weapon ban, given Clintons stated\n: agenda on gun control. I suspect Clinton gave the order to get someone or\n: some: group with assualt weapons and have the press present (they were\n: initially\n: at the incident in Waco) to record the event for the TV audience. The agent \n: on "Street Stories" reported that a supervisor was urging them all to "get \n: ready fast", as "they know we are coming". I believe this attack continued, \n: even tho the probablility of failure was high,  because it came from the top \n: down. After the N.J. assembly vote, the ATF had a limited amount of time to\n: come up with something, and the Wackos in Waco fit the bill nicely.\n: \n: ...rich \n\n\n   I don't know Rich. Last year when the congress was debating the Bushmans\n'Crime Bill', the incident at Lubys' cafe occured. Most of the anti-gun\ncrap was amended out of the bill anyway. \n\n   \n   Could a president 'order': go find some 'assault weapons' and bring the\nmedia". I hope not.  Frankly, the Toon-meister* scares me. Of course \nhaving a Democratic majority in congress doesn't help. (Apologies to all \nDemos' who support RKBA)\n\n( *definition: toon-meister - a characatureic name for the current \npresident of the U.S.:   Clinton aka, Clintoon aka Toon-meister.)
Ahem!!!  Hrumph!!!!  You have encurred the wrath of Glock owners.  We will beat\nyou with our hammers.  Oooops, don't have any  :-)\n\nSeriously.  There is no difference in the safeties betweena Glock and any DA\nrevolver.  Intellectually, think of the Glock as a very high cap revolver. \nIgnoring stove pipes, misfeeds and all the other bonus exercises that\nautoloaders give you, that is.\n\nEvery gun has its safe moment and its dangerous moment.  If you just learn how\nto handle it, it becomes a lot less dangerous (to you).
This was posted to the firearms-politics mailing list.\n=============================================================\nHi Folks;\n\nThursday, April 15 marked Day 3 of the trial.\n\nThis day marked the first testimony of the trial.  Deputy\nU.S. Marshal Larry Cooper took the stand for the prosecution.\n\nThe short version is that his testimony was consistent with\nthe opening statements for the prosecution.\n\nCooper testified that he had arrived in Spokane (Washington)\non August 17, 1992 to participate in a surveillance operation\nwith five other deputies near the Weaver cabin.  The team was\nusing night vision equipment for surveillance, and split up\ninto two teams of three people.  The six later met at an\nobservation point above the cabin.  After this, deputies\nCooper, William Degan, and Arthur Roderick began a descent to\nscout further possible surveillance sites.\n\nCooper told the court that Roderick threw two large rocks into\na gully to see, "whether the [Weaver family] dogs would respond."\nStriker, the Weaver's yellow lab, started toward them barking\nloudly.  Roderick led the three in a run from the area.\n\nThey ran through some dense woods into an open area [called the\n"fern field"] with the dog in pursuit.  By this time, Kevin\nHarris and Samuel Weaver had joined the chase.  The surveillance\nteam had reached a Y in the road: Cooper decided that they should\ntake cover in the woods because otherwise they would be an easy\ntarget and might be "shot in the back."\n\nAs Degan reached the Y, he spotted Randy Weaver coming down the\nroad from the cabin ahead.  Weaver was startled but did not fire.\n\nAt this moment, Striker reached Degan, and Cooper had to "fend\nhim off with his gun."  [It is unclear whether this means he\nclubbed the dog or shot the dog].  Both Cooper and Degan then\ntook cover in the woods.  According to Cooper, Kevin Harris and\nSamuel Weaver continued walking down the road, apparently not\nnoticing the two.  After they had passed by on the road, Degan\ngot up on one knee, raised his gun, and shouted, "Stop!  U.S.\nMarshal!"  Harris then "...brought the weapon around at hip level\nand fired.  He didn't bring the weapon up to eye level.  I saw\nBill's arm going back, and I knew he had been hit."  Cooper fired\nat Harris, and Harris went down.  Cooper then brought his weapon\nto bear on Samuel, but did not fire.  At this point, Cooper then\nheard two shots to his right.  Samuel Weaver looked in the\ndirection of the shots, yelled, "You son of a bitch!" and ran\ntoward them.  Cooper then realized that shots were coming at him\nfrom directly ahead, so he fired a three-round burst at the\ncabin.  At this point he then saw Samuel Weaver running toward\nthe cabin.  When Cooper reached Degan, he placed his first two\nfingers on Degan carotid artery, counted two or three beats, and\nthen his heart stopped.  Shortly thereafter, Roderick and the\nother three marshals joined him.  They then all heard a large\nburst of gunfire from the area around the cabin.\n\nOn cross-examination, David Nevin questioned the point of\nthrowing rocks into the gulley, asking, "You wanted to lure that\ndog out so you could shoot that dog, didn't you?"  Nevin also\npointed out that in last September's testimony, Cooper had\nclaimed that he spotted Weaver after the dog had left him.\nCooper claimed that he had gone over the events in his head and\ndecided that Thursday's account was correct.  Nevin continued the\ncross-examination by asking what Cooper would have done had an\narmed man dressed in full camouflage jumped out of the woods at\nhim [no answer was available].\n\nFriday, April 16 marks continued cross-examination of Cooper.\n\nNotes: There was no coverage of protestors.\n\nDrew\n==============================================================
Today's atrocity in Waco has finally impelled me to start working on\nsomething I've been thinking about for some time.  Over the last few\nyears I have heard of one case after another of government running\ncompletely amok.  Unfortunately, most people are oblivious of the\ngovernment's crimes and still think of it as their protector.  So I\nintend to put together what I call the "American Horror File": a\ncompilation of cases where the American government has run roughshod\nover the rights of its citizens over the last few years, focusing\nespecially on deaths and injuries resulting from no-knock warrants,\nand financial ruin to innocents resulting from civil forfeiture laws,\nbut including any other cases for which I can find decent\ndocumentation.  I hope to make people blood-boiling, artery-bursting,\nred-hot enraged at their government.\n\nThe end result will probably be a book in electronic form (ASCII text\nand postscript files) detailing the government's crimes of recent\nyears.  This book will be distributed at cost, and I will encourage\npeople to post copies to BBS's, send copies on disk to friends, and\nprint out copies and give them to neighbors.\n\nThis is a call for your help.  Any information that you can send me on\nhow government is running amok will be greatly appreciated.  I would prefer\ninformation that is well-documented, with sources given, about specific\ninstances of governmental abuses.  I also welcome anyone who wants to\njoin me in collecting and researching information for this project.
In case you haven't sent it yet, it's "Bentsen", not "Bensen".
Two questions:  When was this, and do you have the relevant\nnumbers.  (Please note, this is *not* in any way an indication I don't\nbelieve you or that you're not correct, but when the drop occured is\nrelevant.)\n   \n\n       The primary objection (beyond ones based on the ideal of\nRKBA that it is simply not something the government should do) is\nthat it makes guns a play-thing and tool of the rich and connected.\nIt discriminates against the poor.\n\n       Is self-defense considered appropriate, and if so, under what\nconditions?  (Are you allowed, for instance to get a gun for protection\nif you're going to be carrying a very large sum of money on a regular\nbasis or have been threatened.)\n\n\n       This has been suggested in the U.S., and generally supported among\ngun owners.  What many object to is that many, if not most, proposals\ncontain a sort of "gotcha" clause which allows an arbitrary denial, even\nif you qualify in every way.\n\n\n       At this point, it should be pointed out that in general\na driver's licence in the U.S. is for the most part nothing like its\nEuropean counterpart.  I understand getting one is far more difficult\nthere than here.  In the U.S. it's a joke. \n\n       But my usual objection is that you're discussing two different\nthings.  For instance, in the U.S. a driver's license is a permit\nto operate a motor vehicle on a public road.  It is not necessary\nto own one, or to operate it on private property.  That is, the\nability to require driving permits is generally considered to arise\nfrom the government's legitimate power to enact reasonable regulations\nfor behavior on public lands.  A permit to own an automobile, for instance,\nwhich is far closer an analogy, would be a much harder thing to get\npast legally, since it wouldn't be based on making regulations on public\nproperty, but in restricting activity on private property.              \n\n\n        This varies *widely*.  (One thing I think Europeans have\na difficult time with is that the U.S. has fifty unique jurisdictions,\nwhere the laws from one state to another can be as radically different\nas from one country in Europe to another).\n\n        Some places allow open carry of both guns and knives.  Some allow\nconcealed.  Some prohibit both, or allow one or the other.  And it can\nbe either a state or local restriciton.       \n\n\n       The question must be asked:  Is the right of *this* individual\naffecting the rights of this *other* individual.  What we usually\nget is that the rights of this *group* (meaning some individuals within\nthis group, here defined as "people who own guns,") are adversely affecting \nthe rights of some other group.  \n\n       If for instance, "Bob" were using his gun to attack "Steve," you'd\nhave a point.  But essentially what we're discussing is that becuase\nsome person who qualifies as a member of the group "people who own\nguns" then some third person, perhaps in another *time zone* is told\nthat their being a member of that group is taking away somebody else's\nrights.  It's like trying to punish all newspapers for the libel commited\nby one.\n\n\n       The issue is crime, violence, and murder.  The question is to\nwhat extent guns and gun legislation impact those.\n\n\n       Of course not.  It would be nice if we didn't have to fear that\nother people might get it into their twisted little minds to hurt us.\nBut currently we don't have that option.  Nor do I expect we will.\n\n\n       No state does.  In any case, there's a limit to which the state\nmay enforce it's "wisdom" on me.  Freedom in general is an unwise\nconcept.  If you pre-emptively restrict everything which might be\n"unwise" then freedom becomes a meaningless concept.\n   \n\n       I'll raise my hand against driver's licenses.  As currently\nimplemented they're a waste of time and little more than revanue\ngeneration for the State and ignored by a startling number of\ndrivers.  It does not guarantee a level of skill any higher than is\nnecessary to get your car on the road and get yourself or somebody\nelse killed, or a knowledge of traffic laws beyond what any ten year\nold will have picked up riding around in his parents car.\n\n       But, as I mentioned, they're two different things.

I've already pointed out how\nwe aren't nailing DUI's hard enough...  Comparing the US with other countries\nseldom works, but the European attitude towards alchohol and DUI seems to work..\nTheir attitude towards weapons isn't really a valid comparison because they've\nhistorically done their best to keep the populace disarmed and submissive,\nwhile our country was founded by a bunch of rugged individualists who told the\nEuropean monarchies (for the most part) to take a flying leap (used more polite\nlanguage though).  We even weaseled out of our first international treaty, and\nthen convinced the French that it was in their best interests not to complain..\nBut first we had to overcome the fact that the Brits were doing their best to \nrestrict us to squirrel guns and such, so we'd be properly submissive while\nthey forced us to pay for their wars.  Of course, most American history classes\nthese days tend to gloss over facts that do not fit the image they wish to \nconvey... I'm glad my Amer.

I don't think we've got a conspiracy on our hands, or anything\nvaugely similar.

What made me\nreally concerned was FBI director William Sessions being on CNN engaging\nin what could only be called spin control before the place had even\ncooled down.

From article <1993Apr18.001319.2340@gnv.ifas.ufl.edu>, by jrm@gnv.ifas.ufl.edu:\n\nIt certainly is provable.  Around a million Americans every year defend\nthemselves with firearms.  In many of these cases the defender doesn't even\nhave to fire a shot!  The mere presence of a gun is oftentimes all the\ndeterrent that is needed.\n\nI don't like violence anymore than anyone else does.  But, taking away the\nright of Americans to keep and bear arms is not the solution to the violent\ncrime problem in this country.  If honest, law-abiding citizens are unable\nto get firearms then they will be preyed on even more by criminals who will\nbe able to acquire guns through illegal channels.  Expect to start seeing\nthe crime syndicates who smuggle drugs into this country start smuggling\nguns.  Believe me this will happen.  There is *plenty* of economic\nincentive for gangsters to illegaly import guns into this country if guns\nshould be banned by the Klintonistas.\n\n\nStatistics, por favor?\n\n\nSee my previous post.  That ought to set you straight.\n\n\nPeople have the right to keep and bear arms no matter what the\nConstitution says.  That means that even if the 2nd Amendment is\nrepealed the *people* (that's all American citizens FYI) will *still*\nhave the right to keep and bear arms.\n\n\nScott Kennedy,  Brewer and Patriot
That's open for debate.  Certainly, an excessive number of people are\nmurdered every year but people also do save innocent lives with firearms.\nThe media just don't tell us when it happens...\n\n\nI think there are more of us than there are federal marshalls...\n\n\nCrap.  It's simplistic thinking on the part of feather-headed dolts.\n\n\nNuts.
I think that HCI people honestly believe that passing more gun control\nlaws will be in the best interests of public safety.  Why do I think\nthis?  Because I used to buy the HCI line.  During my freshman year (1987),\ntheir line made so much sense -- only people who "need" guns should be\nable to get them, and the people who "need" them are the police and\nother elites.  Unfortunately for us, this position is highly emotional\nand not well thought-out.  They never stop to think that HCI's position\nbasically says that the non-elite are incompetents (that's you and me,\nfolks!) and that the Second Amendment has absolutely nothing to do with\nhunting or other "legitimate" uses (which excludes overthrowing tyrannical\ngovernments and defending yourself when the police have proven they\ncan't protect you).\n\n\nEvery pro-control person I've talked to is always left  stumped when I\nsimply argue the facts of gun control (that it has yet to be proven to\nlower crime rates) and weapons terminology (and I'm no expert -- but\nexplaining exactly how an "evil" semiautomatic weapon really works\ndoes wonders).\n\nI hvae personally found well-reasoned arguments to be most effective\nagainst the emotional pro-control people.

Here is a copy of my first update on the Randy Weaver trial.\nAfter a large response (about 15 email messages), I've decided\nthat there is sufficient interest here on t.p.g. to warrant\nposting.\n\n*** file follows *** \n\nHi Folks;\n\nAs perhaps the only Boise resident on the list, I guess it\nkind of falls on me to keep people updated about the\nRandy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial.\n\nYesterday marked the seating of the jury.  Apparently no other\nlegal activities occurred.  The jury was selected and things\nstart today.\n\nMore interesting is what happenned outside.  About a dozen\nWeaver supporters showed up to stage a protest outside the\ncourthouse.  One woman carried a sign that read, "Who stands\ntrial for the murder of Vicki and (son's name - I forget)\nWeaver?"  On the evening news she said, "I am here protesting\nbecause I believe in freedom of speech and freedom of religion.\nI thought we all did."  Nice sound bite (grin)!\n\nThe news reporter also interviewed some guy named "Tim"\nwho refused to give his last name.  Not to prejudge the\nguy, but he looked like a neo-nazi.  He also said he\nexpected many neo-nazis to show up throughout the trial.\n"Tim" had been handing out leaflets in support of Weaver\nand Harris and the news had footage of a Boise cop\ntelling him to move along or he'd arrest.  I don't know\nthe finer points of this one.  Perhaps there's a law\nagainst political activity within X feet of a courthouse\nor something (what happenned to the First Amendment?!?).\n\nMost ominous of all was that the local reporter filmed\nan agent of the Gestapo...err...ATF with a minicam\nFILMING THE PROTESTORS!  Welcome to the world of Big Brother.\n\nAnyhow, Gerry Spence came out and asked the protestors to\nleave because he didn't think it would help Weaver's case\nany.  He said he was confident that, once the evidence\ncame out, that Weaver would be aquitted.\n\nMore stuff as it comes available.
Actually, they won't.  What they'll tell you is that if you add up the\nnumber of suicides, murders of one drug dealer by another, legit\nself-defenses of a battered spouse, and so on, you'll end up with a\nnumber that is much larger than the number of self-defense killings\nagainst strangers committed in the bedroom.  (BTW - they didn't\nhonestly count the latter either, but let's not quibble.)  They\ntry to claim that comparison is between the costs of self-defense\nand the benefits, but they're wrong.\n\nThis comparison doesn't measure the costs of self-defense and it\ndoesn't measure the benefits either.  For example, the goal is not to\nkill the attacker, whatever your relationship to him, but to stop him.\nWhile the number of killings may be proportional to the number of\nstops, it isn't equal.\n\nAnyone who confuses that comparison with an honest evaluation\nis either lying or....\n\n-andy

And I'm sure that is a great comfort to the widows and children of\nthose stabbed, beaten and burned to death. The real question is,\n"Did the crime rate in England go down, after they enacted \ngun control laws?" If you look at the rates before and after their\nfirst such law in 1920, you will see no effect.
Of course.  The term must be rigidly defined in any bill.\n\n\nI doubt she uses this term for that.  You are using a quote allegedly\nfrom her, can you back it up?\n\n\n\n\nI read the article as presenting first an argument about weapons of mass\ndestruction (as commonly understood) and then switching to other topics.\nThe first point evidently was to show that not all weapons should be\nallowed, and then the later analysis was, given this understanding, to\nconsider another class.
Even though I find this to be funny on the surface, the original poster of the\njoke has  tried and convicted the members of the BD to be a bunch of "nuts".\nThis may be a dangerous thing to do.  It is my opinion that most educated\nor well informed people of this country have some distrust of the government.\nThis should exist because as a bureaucracy, any government given enough time\nwill tend to exist for it self and not for the original purpose it was \ncreated for.  This distrust by the people should keep those in power in-line.\nThat and a properly functioning press.  When a sensationalism oriented press\nportrays a group of people as "nuts" or crazies, a violation of those\npeople's civil rights seem justified.   Since we, as American's, have the \ngurantee of rights as enumerated in the constitution, to include the\n2nd ammendment, the government must appease the public's opinion or risk \nvoted out of existance, or if it has become corrupt enough to tamper with\ndomocratic process itself, being thrown out by force.\n  Our government as it stands, must appease the public.  Therefore the \nofficial press releases portray the BD's as fanatics who are a threat to\npublic safety.  We must not prejudge people based on one sided information.\nSo far the only information that we are being given is comming from the very\nagency that was embarrased by the BD(Branch Davidians sp?).  It is to their\nadvantage to make the BD's as fanatical and dangerous as possible.  If they\nwere portrayed as law-abiding citizen's, then they(ATF) had no justification\nwhat so ever of doing what they did.\n   So let's keep an open mind.  Jokes like above, even though it may be funny,\nmay mislead the public from the truth of the matter.\n\nJust as an aside,  my understanding of U.S. vs Rock Island and U.S. vs Dalton\nleads me to believe that the National Firearms Act, which allows the Fed's\n(in this case ATF) to regulate firearms(machine guns), has been deemed to be\nunconstitutional since 1986.(By two federal district courts at least).\nAnd since, I believe the only reason ATF was involved\nin this case is because of firearms violations, it would be interesting to \nfind out whether or not the search warrent was based on the NFA.\nIt would be very embarrassing indeed if a search warrent based on a possibly\nunconstitutional law has resulted in 4 deaths(Law enforcement). \n\n\n****************************************************************************\nThe above opinions are mine and mine only.\nI'm solely responsible for my opinions and my actions.  If you must flame\nthen flame away, but a well constructed argument will be much more respected.

What interpretations?  Just read it as it's written.\n   "A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free\nstate, the right of the people, to keep and bear arms, shall not be\ninfringed."\n\nWhere does it say "The right of the people to be members of a militia shall\nnot be infringed" or "The right of the militia to keep and bear arms shall\nnot be infringed?"  NOWHERE.\n\n\n"Well-educated businessmen being necessary to the ability of the nation to\ncompete in the international marketplace, the right of the people to attend\nschools shall not be infringed."\n\nWould you "interpret" this to mean that only businessmen should have a\nprotected right to attend schools?  Why or why not?
First, I would like to say how much I appreciate having so literate and\nerudite an individual as Mr. Rutledge with whom to discuss this topic.\nFrankly, most anti-RKBA posters refuse even to approach the topic of\nthe original understanding of the Bill of Rights as detailed in the\nwritings of the era. This  is most refreshing.\n\nSecond, I must apologize for leaving the discussion for several days.\nMy brigade's quarterly drill was this weekend and I needed to attend\nto several matters pertaining to the State Militia.\n\nSome people seem to feel that the concept of the Militia is an anachro-\nnism that is out of place in the 20th century. I'm not sure the Swiss\nwould agree and I think perhaps a discussion of how the Militia, both\norganized and unorganized, fits into the defense plans of my State,\nMississippi. Please do not assume that this describes something peculiar\nto one southern state. For instance, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts\nhas a well organized Militia which, members report, maintains stocks\nof both riot guns and machine guns. The laws of other States will vary\nbut are probably similar.\n\nTitle 35  of Mississippi Code defines our Militia as "all able-bodied\ncitizens of the state between the ages of seventeen (17) and sixty-\ntwo (62) years...". The Militia is divided into 3 classes: The National\nGuard, the Mississippi State Guard and the unorganized Militia.  The\nNational Guard is a strange sort of fish from a Constitutional perspective.\nIt tries to be both State Militia and Federal Reserve. The discussion\nof this "para-constitutional" arrangement is quite interesting in itself\nbut somewhat beyond the scope of this discussion. Suffice it that, at this\ndate, the National Guard has ceased to have any Constitutional standing\nas anything but a Federal reserve force.\n\nMississippi, and most other States, maintains a purely State organized\nMilitia. In Mississippi this is called The State Guard. In other \nStates it may be called something else. The State Guard exists as\na cadre or training corps made up of mostly experienced officers and\nsenior NCOs who serve as volunteers without compensation. We drill\non a monthly basis at the company and battalion level, brigade once\na quarter and have an annual drill of the whole organization. Our\nState-authorized cadre strength is 694. This is a skeleton of an\norganization without any flesh. The muscle and sinew when needed will\ncome from the unorganized Militia.\n\nIn time of invasion, insurrection or calamity the Governor can order\nthe activation of the State Guard. When this takes place a call will\nfirst be made  for volunteers to fill the organization out to either\nits contingency strength of 2194 or full strength of 4910. In the\nevent that a sufficient number of people fail to volunteer, the law\nprovides detailed instructions for the conducting of a draft of the\nunorganized Militia. The size of the State Guard is not specified by\nlaw, but rather by executive order. At one time, the organized Militia\nof Mississippi consisted of 68 regiments. Needless to say, the State\ndoes not have armories brimming with weapons with which to equip such\na force. The historical precedent for arming such a force is by use\nof mostly the private arms of the Militiamen. \n\nIt is my hope that demonstrates that State Militias are far from being\nthe long dead anachronisms that some may wish to claim.\n\n\nRegarding Hamilton: If you take Hamilton's opinion as being the sole\nrepresentative of the opinions of the Founding Fathers, you will have\nchosen a highly skewed sample set. Hamilton was on the extreme Federalist\nend of the political spectrum. Others, such as Coxe and Henry, can\nbe chosen to represent the other end. Many contemporaries felt that\nthe idea of having a standing Army of any sort or even a select Militia\nor "train bands" were contrary to the egalitarian nature of the govern-\nment they were striving to perfect. The compromise reached was to\nprovide for a small Army, which had to be refinanced every two years,\nand iron-clad protection for the Militia, which was to remain ever,\n"terrible and irresistible".\n\nThese protections included: State control, not Federal; limitation\nof Federal utilization of the Militia (i.e. execute Laws, suppress\nInsurrections and repel Invasions), and the Right to Keep and Bear\nArms to prevent what the British had tried to do at Lexington.\nThese limitations eventually proved so onerous to the Federal Govern-\nment that they were skirted by the creation of the National Guard.\n\nThe National Guard was created for one very simple reason: the \nConstitutional Militia was had proved too unreliable for fighting\nwars of imperial expansion. (e.g. Spanish-American War). The\nConstitution provided that the Militia could only be employed by\nthe Federal government in very limited purposes. As far back as the\nWar of 1812, Militia units had refused to leave United States\nterritory to attack the enemy. Further, there was no Constitutional\nauthorization for any conscription of anyone into the Federal\nMilitary and Militiamen were particularly protected. In all wars until\nWW-I every American who left the country under arms was a volunteer.\nWhen the National Guard acts of 1903-1916 required that each new\nmember also enlist as a reservest in the Army, existing soldiers were\n"grandfathered". At least one of these "grandfathered" individuals\nrefused to go to France in 1918 and his refusal was upheld by the\nFederal Courts.\n\nMr. Rutledge has stated that the Second Amendment applies only to\nmembers of a "well organized" militia. However, the pre-Constitutional\nhistory of the American Militia shows relatively few periods when\nThe Militia came close to meeting either Messrs. Rutledge or Hamilton's\ndefinition of "well organized". In the period of peace between the\nFrench & Indian War and The Revolution many companies simply stopped\ndrilling and had to be reconstituted just prior to The Revolution.\nPerhaps Mr. Rutledge would care to argue that those of my ancestors\nwho answered the Lexington alarm had forfeited their rights because\ntheir units didn't drill for a few years in the 1760s. I would not\nbe so bold.\n\nAgain, I wish to repeat. The National Guard, for all its merits, is\nnot the Militia described by the Constitution  nor by Mr. Hamilton\nnor by Mr. Henry nor by Mr. Coxe. The fact that the Federal Government\nand many States are delinquent in their attentions to and organizing\nof their Constitutional Militias  diminishes neither their\nresponsibilities nor the rights of the Militia as detailed in the\nConstitution.\n \nMisunderstanding of the nature and purpose of the Militia is but one\nerror that has crept into modern readings of the Constitution. The\nConstitution prohibits States from keeping "Troops or Ships of War\nin time of Peace". I have heard some insist this prevents States from\nmaintaining a Militia, but this comes about because people today do not\nunderstand the meanings of the words in their 18th century usage.\nToday we call any large vessel a "ship" but in the 18th century the word\ndescribed a particular kind of vessel.  A "ship" is a large vessel with\nthree or more masts each carrying square rigged sails. A "brig" has two\nmasts. In the contemporary usage the States were prohibited only from keeping\nthe largest warships of the day, those capable of global operations. Today's\nequivalent might be a prohibition on the States' keeping nuclear missiles.\n"Troops" at this time meant a full-time professional military organization.\nAny study of contemporaneous writings will bear this out. \n\nIn at least one respect, I am in agreement with Mr. Rutledge; being\npersonally involved in the maintenance and advancement of The Militia\nas a viable means of defense for a modern society, I am frequently\nboth bemused and saddened when friends and associates wax poetic on\ntheir place in the unorganized Militia and become strangely silent or\nscarce when invited to attend a  drill of their State's Militia.
Having read the posted long article by JPFO, I have some observations:\n\n1.  This article does NOT claim that the GCA of 1968 is a "verbatim \ntranslation" of a Nazi law.  What it says is that in another place --\nthe book they're talking about -- they compare the two things section\nby section.  The implication is that the similarities are devastating.\nIn the next sentence, they talk about how in that book they reproduce \nthe German text of the Nazi law, together with its translation.  Not \nsurprisingly, a reader could easily conflate these two things into a \nsingle idea:  that the American GCA is a literal translation of the Nazi\nlaw; and sure enough, that's what the whole thing has mutated into, \nurban-folklore style.\n\n2.  The article goes to great pains to establish that Senator Dodd had a \ncopy of the Nazi law, either from his time on the Nurnberg prosecution \nteam or later.  This fact is considered highly incriminating, but I don't \nunderstand why.  The author repeats several times that he is simply unable \nto imagine how anyone could come into possession of the original text; and \nyet in a paragraph towards the end, he explains it perfectly:\n\n"If Dodd got his copy of the original German text of the Nazi Weapons\nLaw during his time at Nurnberg, it likely was part of a collection of\ndocuments, for example, issues of the Reichsgesetzblatt [the German\nlaw registry]."\n\nBingo.  Exactly.  \n\nDodd had a *book*, with a series of Nazi laws in it, including the one\nunder discussion.  All of the stuff about "Why would a U.S. congressman\nhave a copy of a Nazi law?" melts away, by the author's admission.  He\nthen continues:  "But if he acquired the original German text of the \nNazi Weapons Law after his service at Nurnberg, he must have done so \nfor a very specific reason..."  But there's absolutely no reason to \nthink that this is the case.  In fact, as a "senior member of the U.S. \nteam that helped to prosecute Nazi war criminals", it seems to me that\nhe would have *had* to have a copy.  All arguments about whether \nthe Nazi Weapon Law is really of historical interest (as it obviously\nis, certainly according to the author here), or whether Dodd personally\nprosecuted the Interior Minister who signed it, can be put aside as red \nherrings.\n\n3.  Having established that Dodd owned a copy of the original German text, the\nJPFO article then tries to draw sinister implications from the fact that he \nasked to have it translated.  The problem is, in the context of the charge \nlevelled at Dodd, these two things work *against* each other.  People ask \nto have things translated when they *don't know what they mean*.  If Dodd \ntook it upon himself to preserve the Nazi law with idea of someday introducing \nit into American law, surely by 1968 he would have know what it *meant*, \nwouldn't he?\n    Anyway, this precise charge -- the main one that I questioned in an earlier\nposting -- is just silly.  Why would Dodd need the exact translation for this\npurpose?  Is the idea that the gun controllers, despite being presumably bent\non disarming the populace with the goal of eventually destroying all civil\nliberties, needed a crib sheet?  Didn't they have any idea how to do it\non their own?\n    Once again, the author provides a perfectly acceptable answer to his\nown question: "Dodd may have offered his copy of the Nazi Weapons Law\nto show that the specific proposal did not resemble anything in the \nNazi law."  In fact, since the law and its translation *were* entered\ninto the Congressional Record, under the heading of documents "concerning\nthe history of Nazism and gun confiscation", Dodd's motivation isn't a \nmystery:  he asked for the translation in order to put it in the CR.\n\n4.  Even this article makes it clear that the part of the Nazi law that\nwas added *by* the Nazi regime is only a small part of that law.  \nRegistration of guns, for instance, was begun in 1928, and thus NOT\na "Nazi-inspired" idea.  The parts of the Nazi law that parallel the \n1968 GCA include handgun control of some sort, and the identification \nof certain weapons as sporting weapons.  The JPFO then goes on to list \nother parts of the Nazi law, forbidding ownership of weapons by Jews;\nof course, there are no such provisions in the American GCA.  Nevertheless,\nin a rhetorical move guaranteed to muddy the waters, immediately after the \ndiscussion of the anti-Jewish parts of the law, the JPFO article continues, \n"Given the parallels between the Nazi Weapons Law and the GCA'68..." -- so \nas to get maximum emotional mileage out of that aspect of the law.
Very likely possible.  Reminds me of the movie "The Rapture".
On Ted Koppel last night, the ubiquitous Australian woman claimed that\nKoresh trained the women (years ago) how to commit suicide by swallowing\ncyanide or by putting a gun in their mouth.  With cyanide on hand, why\nchoose to roast yourself?  There are too many unanswered questions here.\n--
I just got through listening to the 10 o'clock news on Channel 4 here in\nDallas. They trotted out a list of justifications produced by the ATF after\n"months of investigation" for their raid. \n\nI couldn't believe the junk on this list! For example, the BDs were accused\nof stockpiling a bunch of "9mm and .223 ammunition that can be used in M15\nand M16 assault rifles". Imagine that--they had ammunition!  They also had\naluminum dust! (Yeah, it's a component of thermite, but so far I haven't\nheard that it's illegal to take a grinder to the aluminum lawn\nfurniture...) The only thing on the list that could conceivably have been\nillegal was an M-79 grenade launcher. (Anybody know about this?)\n\nMonths of investigation! For this 80+ people died!
I've been a member of the NRA for several years and recently "joined"\nHCI.  I wanted to see what they were up to and paid the minimum ($15)\nto get a membership. I also sent the NRA another $120.
I heard over NPR yesterday morning that Arlan Specter, Senator from\nPennsylvania, has already called for a Congressional investigation.\nThe problem is that Specter was one of the key government attorneys several\nyears ago who did what he could to coverup facts in the assassinations\nof JFK and others.  That is to say, the Chief Fox wants to check out\nthe hen house.  Writing your representatives is a great idea.  When\nyou do ask that they keep Specter and his cronies far away from \nany investigation.
Unfortunately, elections can, and are, bought.  Promise the voters money, and\nthey will vote for you.\n\n\nSame here.  Convicted felons may not legally purchase firearms.\n\n\nThat you know of.\n\nWhile I lived in the DBR, a gang robbed a joint US Army/Bundewehr armoury and\ngot several hundred M-16s, ammunition, handguns and some explosives.  When I\nleft two years later, there were no clues.\n\n\nWho uses them is the problem.  Crime, in the U.S., is "no big deal" if you are\nthe criminal.  How about 5 years for murder.  Credit for time served (in jail,\nwaiting for trial) and you are out in 12 months, worst case.  If we would put\ncriminals, especially violent ones, in the slam for true sentences, crime would\ndrop.  Instead, we reward them for being good and let them out early, very\nearly.\n\n\nSerbs, Croats and Muslims have been killing each other almost since before the\ninvention of guns.  Old women are throwing stones at UN trucks.  This is a\nhatred that goes beyond reason.\n\nYes, the problem is the user.  Question back (since you are one of the rational\nones):  If all gun crime were to stop, would you support dropping all gun\ncontrols?\n\n\nThey did not believe, from experience, that the "police" (including National\nGuard) could/would protect them.  Unless you want to argue that a human being\ndoes not have a right to protect him/herself, they did the right thing.  What\nwould you suggest as a defense against a mob throwing bottles and rocks, and\nalso likely armed with stolen firearms?\n\n\nCriminals would move to Scandinavia??? :-)  The average criminal would look for\na less hazardous job, and the rest would likely be buried at county expense.\n\n\nPersonally, I criticize the fools who send money to the IRA to "make Ireland\nfree".  Of course, this is the last thing the IRA wants, because they lose\npower if England pulls out.  But that's for another group.\n\n\nThe U.S. has roughly 20 times the major sporting events as the U.K..  How many\nriots did we have at sporting events last year (off the playing field)? \nHooligan is a word never used when reffering to sports fans here.  I guess\nthat's where the different cultures thing comes in.\n\n\nYes.  The question is, is the problem one of too many guns (mostly from the\narmy) or not enough (nonSerbians can not defend themselves.\n\n\nBut disarming responsible gun owners is not the solution.  Yet, that is exactly\nwhat HCI is proposing.

Here is a press release from the White House.\n\n President Clinton's Remarks On Waco With Q/A\n To: National Desk\n Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100\n\n   WASHINGTON, April 20 /U.S. Newswire/ -- Following are\nremarks by President Clinton in a question and answer session\nwith the press (Part 2 of 2):\n\n     Go ahead, Sarah.\n\n     Q  There are two questions I want to ask you.  The\nfirst is, I think that they knew very well that the children did not\nhave gas masks while the adults did, so the children had no chance\nbecause this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal, but it was\nvery dangerous to the children and they could not have survived\nwithout gas masks.  And on February 28th -- let's go back -- didn't\nthose people have a right to practice their religion?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  They were not just practicing their\nreligion, they were -- the Treasury Department believed that they had\nviolated federal laws, any number of them.\n\n     Q  What federal laws --\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me go back and answer -- I can't\nanswer the question about the gas masks, except to tell you that the\nwhole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; they\nwere convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult but\nit would force anybody that breathed it to run outside.  And one of\nthe things that I've heard -- I don't want to get into the details of\nthis because I don't know -- but one of the things that they were\nspeculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that\nthe windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have\nescaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect.\n\n     They also knew, Sarah, that there was an underground\ncompound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be\nsent.  And they were -- I think they were hoping very much that if\nthe children were not released immediately outside that the humane\nthing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace\nwhere they could be protected.\n\n     In terms of the gas masks themselves, I learned\nyesterday -- I did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas\nwas supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks\nthemselves were to work.  So that it was thought that even if they\nall had gas masks, that eventually the gas would force them out in a\nnonviolent, nonshooting circumstance.\n\n     MS. MYERS:  Last question.\n\n     Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying that --\n\n     Q  Could you tell us whether or not you ever asked\nJanet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide?  And when you\nlearned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your\nmind during those horrendous moments?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  What I asked Janet Reno is if they had\nconsidered all the worse things that could happen.  And she said --\nand, of course, the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the\npublic -- he had -- that had been debated anyway.  And she said that\nthe people who were most knowledgeable  about these kinds of issues\nconcluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would\nbe tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in\nthe future.  That was the judgment they made.  Whether they were\nright or wrong, of course, we will never know.\n\n     What happened when I saw the fire, when I saw the\nbuilding burning?  I was sick.  I felt terrible.  And my immediate\nconcern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were\nescaping or whether they were inside, trying to burn themselves up.\nThat's the first thing I wanted to know.\n\n     Thank you.\n\n     Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying it was a\nJanet Reno decision?  Isn't it, in the end, your decision?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I'm saying is that I didn't\nhave a four- or five-hour, detailed briefing from the FBI.  I didn't\ngo over every strategic part of it.  It is a decision for which I\ntake responsibility.  I'm the President of the United States and I\nsigned off on the general decision and giving her the authority to\nmake the last call.  When I talked to her on Sunday, some time had\nelapsed.  She might have made a decision to change her mind.  I said,\nif you decide to go forward with this tomorrow, I will support you.\nAnd I do support her.\n\n     She is not ultimately responsible to the American\npeople; I am.  But I think she has conducted her duties in an\nappropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation I think as\nwell as she could have.\n\n     Thank you.  (Applause.)

##flame thrower on## \n Well I don't want my tax dollars going to that kind of philosophy. \n maybe if the good folks you are talking about are people like you \n than I might be inclined to accept it. What does the batf do anyway? \n Why don't we have a bureau for militant, paranoid, freedom killers \n like yourself. People like you are more dangerous than alcohol, \n tobacco and firearms. \n Maybe we should just have nuked the whole city, I mean, what's a \n 100,000 good souls anyway? \n Get real, you sound like a racist.  I guess life isn't so precious \n to you, do you realize that there were  24 children KILLED!!! \n They will never get to fall in love, they won't see another sunrise, \n no prom, no first date, no football, baseball no NOTHING.  Why doesn't \n some people think first before they let everyone know how narrow they \n are.
OK ... a near-majority actually OWN firearms, but I will still\n	claim that the VAST majority never needs to use them or even\n	threaten anyone with them. What do they do right ... or are\n	they just lucky ? In either case, this means the 'average\n	threat level' in this country is rather low. \n \n\n	I think you have weapons on the brain. I never said that these\n	alternative means of self-protection involved any hardware.\n	Why are 'good' neighborhoods 'good' ? It isn't because every\n	person is armed to the teeth. It is because of (1) attitude\n	and (2) cooperation. In the 'good' neighborhoods, the residents\n	make themselves aware of their neighbors and notice when\n	strangers are lurking around. 'Good' neighborhoods form groups\n	like 'crime-watch' to increase this effect, and the relative\n	effectiveness of the police. When hostiles are arrested, the\n	good neighbors step up and say "THAT'S the one officer ! He\n	was robbing Mr. Jones' house". \n\n	In short, the alternative to firepower is gangs ... or at\n	least a benificent manifestation of that social cooperative.\n	Replace lead with flesh ... the flesh makes a better\n	conversationalist too and you can invite it over for a\n	block party. \n\n\n	Oliver North. The man is positively worshiped in many\n	all-American 'conservative' quarters. He and Big Ron\n	set-up a secret government and did all sorts of severely\n	illegal deeds - the kind of stuff you and I would be doing\n	twenty-to-life for, yet he walks free. This BS happens all\n	the time. In fact, it happens so much that no one really\n	cares anymore.  'Legitimacy' is a non-issue. Legality is\n	a non-issue. So long as we get T-bones and our MTV, who\n	gives a rats ass ? \n\n\n	No. I claimed that no one is interested in the statistical\n	aspects of the argument. Pure emotion, like the abortion issue.\n\n\n	Argue away ... you can't win.
This means you would support a ban if it were narrow enough.  Good.\n\n\nI would hope so.  Let's define a nuclear weapon as an explosive weapon\nwhose majority of energy comes from fission and/or fusion of atomic\nnuclei.  Let's define a biological weapon as live organisms or viruses \nin such state, quantity, and with such a vector that they could cause \ndeath or serious disease [further defined] to a significant number of\npeople if released in a city, similarly populated area, resevoir, or\ncropland.  \n\n\nNerve gas and mustard gas are well defined.  Other poisonous\ngasses should be individually banned only if it can be shown that there\nis no use not related to weaponry.  Licenses should be available for\nresearch purposes on such chemicals.\n\nI am not a lawyer, but these ideas could certainly be a basis for \ndefinitions.\n\n\nNope.  It is not considered a weapon.\n\n\nIt is not defined as a weapon of mass destruction.  Many things are\nbanned for other reasons.
Rather, people kill people with guns.  The sad truth is: sometimes that is\ngood, or at least, better than the alternative.\n\n\nOk.  There are about 1400 fatal firearm accidents per year [1], and the\nnumber has been in decline since early this century [2].  Most of these\naccidents involve rifles or shot guns, not handguns.\n\n...\n\nIn fact there are both guns and bullets designed specifically for that. \nThe idea that my Ruger Mark II Bull Barrel (a semi-auto 0.22 caliber\nhandgun) was designed to kill or hurt people, even for self defense,\nwould, I'm sure, come as a surprise to its designer.  It certainly isn't\nwhy I have it.  It certainly would hurt someone if you shot them with it,\nand might even kill them, but it is simply wrong to say it was designed to\nkill people.\n\n\nIn fact, that is what happens most of the time.  Most self defensive uses\nof firearms don't involve firing any shots.  Most criminals would prefer\nnot to be shot, and will go to some effort not to be, including doing what\nyou say when you point a gun at them.\n\nIf you were called on to design a tool, that could be easily carried, to\nimmediately stop someone attacking you, what would it be?  A handgun is\nabout the best anyone has come up with and experience shows it does work\nthe best.[3]\n\n\nCertainly, no one argues that handguns (of the type we are discussing)\naren't deadly weapons.  However, it simply isn't true to say that all of\nthem were designed to kill people.  Moreover, what exactly is wrong with\nhaving deadly weapons?  There are times when it is perfectly legitimate to\nuse deadly force, e.g. in self defense.  I consider it not just my right,\nbut my duty to defend myself and my family, and that includes having and\nknowing how to use the tools to do that.\n\n"The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear\narms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in\ngovernment."\n	- T. Jefferson.\n\nI think what Jefferson said is still true.\n\n\nNot very often compared to other use.[3]\n\n\nThis isn't that common either, at least when compared to other uses.  It is\nvery rare that a non-violent person will suddenly "get-pissed" and kill\nsomeone, gun or not.  In most cases, the people who murder have long\nhistories of violence.  If you have good reason to believe that these\npeople wouldn't kill if they didn't have a gun, feel free to present it.\n\n\nRight, but there are times when killing things is called for.  I hope I\nnever have to shoot a person, but I've had to kill a number of animals from\nrodents to cows, and when I do, I don't want them to suffer any more than\nis necessary.  I prefer they die instantly, but failing that, I want them\nto drop so I can quickly finish them with the next shot, and failing that,\nI don't want them to go fast or far.  I try to choose the best weapon and\nammunition I have to try to achieve that goal for the size of animal I'm\nafter, but it doesn't always work as I plan.  Without belaboring the point,\npeople who are overly impressed with the killing or shopping power of guns,\nparticularly handguns, haven't used them much for that purpose.\n\n\n[1] Accidental deaths in 1988:\n	48700 deaths by auto\n	11300 deaths by fall\n	 5300 deaths by drowning\n	 4800 deaths by fire\n	 4400 deaths by poison\n	 3200 deaths by food\n	 1400 deaths by firearm\n\n     Source: Statistics Department, National Safety Council.\n     "Accidents Facts 1988 Edition".

you consider those I got from you to be such.\n\nYes, You state the reference, and then YOU claim it's a good or fair treatment.  \n\n\nYou fail to see the differences between absolute numbers and rates.\n\npopulation  \nmight  \n\nNo, you just miss the point.  By your methods, I can prove gun control to be a  \ntotal failure.  New York's total homocide count, with it's strict gun control,  \nis MUCH higher than Rhode Island's, with it's less strict gun control.  FAR  \nmore folks are killed in New York, than Rhode Island.  Therefore, according to  \nMane Logic(tm), gun control has made New York a much more dangerous place than  \nRhode Island.  Remember, it's "Nitpicking" and "a whiney debating style" to  \npoint out the differences between New York and Rhode Island that might defeat  \nmy argument.\n\n\nNow you agree?  Wow, a break-through!
"We" know because the area that the gun shop/shooting range is in is right on\nthe border of the west side of Chicago.  That is a gang infested area.  There\nare many, many bad things going on in that area.  Also, I have several friends\nthat live very close to that area who have had problems with some of these\nfolks.  By the way, where did I say that they were minorities?  Do you think\nthat only minorities have gangs?  Not so.  As far as the quotes are concerned\nit was totally obvious that they weren't just practicing for marksmanship.  I\ndon't know about you but I have never seen anyone else practice marksmanship by\ntaking their gun out of their coat as fast as possible and start shooting.  If\nyou would have been there Andy it would've been obvious to you too.  Of course\nit might not have been.  Who knows.  All I do know is that I was there, I live\nhere and I know that they were gang bangers.  When you live here long enough it\nbecomes pretty easy to spot them via gang colors, gang signs, etc.  One last\nthing.  My sister is a social worker.  She makes it her point to find these\nthings out (gang signs, colors, etc) because it is in her best interest to do\nso.  She is nice enough to let me know these things so I can watch out for\nmyself as I live right on the border of the west side of the city. Enough said.
Good!\n\nNot very.  Thanks to the filibuster in the Senate, things are backing up.

(AP) -- A police officer afraid he would be fired for\nallegedly assaulting a teen-ager walked into an auto body shop wher the youth\nworked, said "You're going to die" and fatally shot him and two others, police\nsaid.\n\nA fourth youth was wounded.  A fifth escaped injury by hiding under a car.\n\nThe wounded youth ran about two blocks to a house after the shooting at about\nmidnight Tuesday and called police.  He was hospitalized in satisfactory\ncondition Wednesday.\n\nSuspended police officer Robert Sabetta, 23, of Cranston, was arrested at\ngunpoint over three hours after the shooting at Wilson's Auto Enterprises in\nFoster, a rural town of about 4,000 people in northwest Rhode Island.\n\n	Well, this just goes to show that cops are capable of snapping, just\nlike everyone else.  Now who was it who said only cops should have guns?
>   unsealed, it is CLEAR that Clinton and Reno supported an\n   >  ILLEGAL raid.  Did they not KNOW this?\n\n\n\n >    NO authority to use helicopters.\n\n\n\n	Sorry, I missed all this!  Can you please give an update on\n	the warrant?  I hadn't heard that it was unsealed.  There\n	was no authority for a "no-knock?"  This is news.  How about\n	an OK for a wiretap?
how so? i think you're making assumptions here that might not \nnecessarily be true. -my- personal choice would be a semi-auto, but \nrevolvers are just as effective, if not more so.\n\n\nrelevancy, please? you sound shocked, but that hardly proves anything.\n\n\nwait, doesn't Chicago have -serious- gun control? if so, why do the\npolice need all that firepower in the first place? (sarcasm alert)\n\nall the patrol cars i've seen around here have shotguns clamped to \nthe dash board. IMHO, that's all the police need to outgun just about \nanything.\n\njason
The Wall Street Journal had an article on how the police were whining\nabout all the new guns; excuse me, but police are EMPLOYEES of the\ngovernment. Rather like having your janitor complain about job\nconditions.\n\nI say Californians should form armed block clubs that would engage\nin coordinated strategies should BATF attempt to disarm them based\non the "nefarious tipster" theory of law enforcement. Unlike Waco, \nCalifornians should be able to destroy armored vehicles in city\nstreets with incendiary weapons, acetylene after slowing them down\nwith abandoned car blockades. M-1 Garands should easily outclass\nBATF shock troops with their H&K MP-5 SMGs, and there should be\nenough Sony Walkmans and Boom Boxes to overwhelm any FBI psy-war\noperation... yes, a good time would be had by all. Billary Clinton\nwould get what he wanted, a War on Gunowners, the BATF would attempt\nto show the anti-gun press they they really, REALLY were in charge\nwith a 500-man "Charge of the Light Brigade," and the FBI would attempt \nto show how _THEY_ really were in charge by asking the Californian \nNational Guard to level the area with artillary!

If alcohol were again banned today, it would be MUCH more\n	difficult to manage a large-scale smuggling operation. \n	The cops now rank just a narrow notch below the military\n	in communications, intelligence gathering and firepower.\n\n	In a similar vein, the amount of marijuana smuggled into\n	this country has greatly decreased. This is because its\n	value-per-pound is very low when compared to cocaine or\n	heroin. It's simply not worth the risk, it's uneconomical.\n	Now, most reefer is domestic. There is less pressure on\n	the domestic producer (showy raids notwithstanding) and\n	thus it is economical. Of note though ... domestic reefer\n	is now very strong, so a small volume goes a long way.\n	You cannot make alcohol stronger than 200 proof - not a\n	good dollar/pound deal.
Seeing as how people are willing to quote the FBI quoting cultists\nwho just yesterday were deranged and not to be trusted (hmm the FBI\nor the cultists...) I think I'll quote the BBC quoting (actually voice\ninterview) one of the two British survivors. He claimed that the fire\nstarted when the tanks caused an internal wooden wall/roof to collapse\nknocking over kerosene lamps and that they had no suicide plan.\n\nMaybe true, partly true, or false.
Anyone who worries about his own gun should not have one.  If you carry\nany pistol with a empty chamber and safety the chances of it going off\nare about zero.  Unless you sit it on top of a lite stove for a couple\nof minutes or put it in a fire. :-)

Even if it were a capital offense, the warrant was not even an arrest warrant,\nbut a search warrant.  In other words, there was no evidence of illegal\narms, just enough of a suggestion to get a judge to sign a license to\nsearch for illegal evidence.
A couple of questions for you firearms law experts out there:  \n\nQuestion #1\n\nAccording to the NRA/ILA state firearms lawbook, in Wisconsin it is\n'unlawful for any person except a peace officer to go armed* with a \n"concealed and dangerous weapon."  There is no statutory provision for\nobtaining a lixense or permit to carry a concealed weapon.'\n\n*  Jury instructions indicate that 'to go armed' one must have a firearm\non one's person or within his immediate control and available for use.\n\n\n\nDoes this mean that open carry is allowed?  If so, just how 'open' does it\nhave to be?  Would an in the pants holster be considered concealing?  What\nif one had their jacket on and it partially covered the weapon?  Also,\nis there any way to be allowed to carry concealed, or is it just not allowed,\nperiod? \n\nQuestion #2\n\nAs I understand it, in Evanston, IL, they have a ordinance banning handguns.\nIs there any way to get around this provision?  What would the penalty if\nyou were found out be?  What if you used said handgun in a defensive shooting\nin your apartment there?  How would the city law apply to your impending \ntrial for the shooting?\nAlso, what is IL state law concerning short barreled weapons?  Short barreled\nshotgun is what I would be interested in if a handgun were not available, \neither that or a shortened 9mm carbine (ie Colt, Marlin).  \nOne more thing, what is the chance of getting a CCW permit in IL without being\nrich or famous or related to the mayor?
As I recall, in the 60's the Kennedy Administration had sub-kiloton\nnuclear weapons withdrawn from Europe and destroyed.  They were man-\nportable and made for use in shoulder-mount rocket launchers.  The\nsmallest nuclear test I've seen data for was a .1 (yes, one-tenth)\nkiloton weapon tested either in the late 40's or early 50's.
They'd probably quote Montesque (sp?) who was once asked if Russia\nwas likely to become a democracy any time soon: "No, because\nRussia is a nation of slaves and the people get what they deserve."\nSince he said that, Russia has changed a great deal. But so, \nunfortunately have other nations.
This is probably the best part of your post.  Everything else is\nshrill speculation.

I have been convinced of the right of AMericans to an effective \nself-defense, but something strikes me as odd among the\npro-RKBA arguments presented here.\n\nThe numbers comparing hundreds of thousands (indeed, even a\nmillion) of instances of law abiding citizens deterring\ncriminal activity, seem valid to me.  Likewise the number\nof gun-caused homicides each year (about 11,000/year?).  However,\nit is surprising that the "Evil AntiGun Empire " (Darth Vader\nbreathing sound effect here) never tries to compare\n"All legitimate gun defenses" vs. "All gun crimes."  Instead, \nit's always "All legitimate gun defenses,"  which includes\ncases in which the criminals are shot but not killed, and\ncases in which the criminal is not here, vs. just \ncriminal gun homicides, which only includes case sin which\nthe victim died.\n\nWhy is this?  Of course, it wouldn't be unreasonable to say\nthat in each crime already measured (involving guns), the\nconsequnces are already known and it is safe to assume that\na gun-based bank robbery last week will not suddenly turn\ninto a gun-basd robbery+homicide.  Whereas in the legitimate\ngun defenses, one may assume that all those criminals who\nwere deterred would have committed more crime or more\nserious crimes had they not been deterred.\n\n-Case Kim
I agree very much.  I have read almost every article written about\n   the Glock, and IMO, it is probably the safest auto-loader made.  It\n   has the best safty of all, Jeff Cooper's First Rule, "Keep your finger\n   OFF the trigger until you want to shoot."  If everyone just observed\n   this, there would be fewer "accidents".\n\n   David N. Bixler\n   Auburn University
The only folks claiming this are the ATF/FBI who have an interest in\nputting the blame on the BD's. Wake up.\n\n\n\nRight and proper? How? It was FUBAR from day 1.\n\nFrom all independent sources. Yes. \n\n\nIt would have hurt nothing to wait and the result could hardly have been\nworse.\n\n\nSure, it you want to someone you claim is a dangerous paranoid even\nmore paranoid.\n\n\nAnd what makes you think that "waffle boy" didn't tell her to take the\nwrap.

/ iftccu:talk.politics.guns / steiner@jupiter.ca.boeing.com / 12:07 am  Apr 15, 1993 /\n\nAlso, you need to consider our legal system.  Since any of these things\nCAN be lethal, you are going to have a hard time explaining why you applied \nlethal force when you DIDN'T think it was necessary.  (If you thought lethal\nforce was necessary, you wouldn't be using rubber bullets, would you?)

Ack, what a public relations nightmare just begging happen.\n\n      "Gun Lobby pays vigilanties."\n\n      "NRA to shell out dough to gunfighters."
Fact:  Both Janet Reno and Bill Clinton have admitted responsibility,\n       even grief, over the deaths in Waco.\n\nFact:  Regardless of who started the fire, there are more than enough\n       things on tape to make a civil rights case against these two.\n       Cruel and unusual punishment (dying tortured rabbits on tape?)\n       come to mind.  \n\nFact:  It is a federal felony to infringe civil rights under color of\n       law; where death is involved, this offense carries a penalty\n       of life in prison.\n\nFact:  Impeachment is allowable for "high crimes and misdemeanors."\n       Anything that's a federal felony should qualify.\n\nConclusion:  We have NO CHOICE, if we are an honest people, but to \n             impeach Mr. Clinton, and remove Reno from office.
I have the April 15, 1993 issue of the SF Chronicle in my lap.  Page\nE7 (in the "Sporting Green" section) has a Trader's advert.

Just to shed some light on the fire, it was widely reported (AP, etc.) that\nthere WERE several witnesses to BD folks starting the fires.

[MODERATOR:  Nice summary, Keith, thanks.]\n\nI talked to the federal Dept. of Justice (DOJ, Ottawa) to try and\nclarify a bunch of things regarding changes to Canadian gun laws.\nI am posting here for informational purposes; questions to email,\nfollowup to t.p.g.\n\n1. It is still technically feasible (but almost impossible) to get\n   a concealed carry permit in Canada.  This is contrary to what I\n   was told by a police officer.\n2. It is still legal to use lethal force (such as a firearm) to\n   protect life, also contrary to what the officer told me.  Guns\n   must be stored locked up and unloaded, however.\n3. Regarding hi-capacity magazines, it is still not clear who will\n   be exempt or how this will be managed.  This is up to each province.\n   The general idea is that exempt persons will receive a letter/form\n   authorizing them to possess the high capacity magazines.  \n   Apparently, the authorization is to specify how many of these\n   'prohibited weapons' you will be allowed to possess.  Dealers will\n   be allowed to order high capacity mags for those allowed to possess\n   them, but will not be allowed to stock them.\n4. High capacity magazines converted to comply with the new limits will\n   not be considered prohibited weapons.  Amendments to the regulations\n   specify some possible methods to alter the magazines.  Some \n   manufacturers (Beretta) will be marketing reduced capacity magazines.\n   (God knows how much they'll charge for these)\n\nThis covers most of what we discussed.  I have typed this from memory,\ndo not take it as gospel.  I am not a lawyer and I refuse to play one on TV.\n\n\n-- \n-------------------------------------------------------------------
I think the point is being missed - that it is apparantly acceptable for\nBig Government (Big Brother?) to use TANKS to control the people, as\nlong as they don't use the BIG GUN (but everything else is allright...).\n\nTanks deployed against civilians, let alone FIRING on them with crew\nserved weaponry (a .50 Heavy Machine Gun is crew-served) is something\nboth our press and government howl about instantly when done in some\nother country.  Against civilians that have, at most, one-shot-at-a-time\nLIGHT small arms.  Certainly nothing that places the people in or behind\nthe tank in any real danger.  Molotov coctails?  A round from a rifle\nor pistol deals with anybody approaching with one of those.  And "snipers"\ntoo often turn out to be strays from other cops/guard/army gunfire.\n\nI don't know about the other people in this group (or on the net) but\nthe idea of tanks being used to control civilians, in anything that\npretends to be a free society is outrageous.  When Big Government feels\nit is necessary to use that kind of force to stomp out protests (even\nviolent) of the citizens, that suggests that the government is totally\nout of control, since that is effectively the government declaring war\non its own people.  If the government was living up to its responsibility,\ngovernment of the people BY THE PEOPLE, not the 'lords' and other elites\nwho want to keep their good thing going, the citizens wouldn't feel the\nneed to be resorting to acts that need to be squashed with a military\nboot.  People do things like that because they have become convinced\nthat it is the only option that remains, other attempts to have grievances\nredressed have been ignored.  And yes, there is a criminal element that\nwill exploit this, but the fact remains that the government has been\nunresponsive or such acts wouldn't be apt to happen.  Still not an excuse\nto open up on civilians with tanks, heavy machine guns, or whatever.\nIts the old 'might makes right' philosophy that is the hallmark of a\ngovernment going rogue:  They don't like it? Tough. We will simply\nsquash them under an iron boot.  Actually addressing their grievances\nin other than token fashion with huge volumes of hot air is just too\ninconvenient...  Sort of a variation on mushroom management:  Keep them\nin the dark, Smother them with shit, and Crush them when ready...\n\nAnd these are the folks that many liberals are trying to arrange things\nso that they will have a MONOPOLY on coercive force (firearms that are\nthan expensive toys...) by gutting the Bill of Rights (cuz it just isn't\nPROGRESSIVE or doesn't fit in with MODERN THINKING anymore)...\n\nUnbelievable.\n\nAnd I do believe amid the smoke, confusion, etc of a real riot situation,\nthat it would be POSSIBLE for a tank to get away with firing the main gun\ninto a building at close range?  One would hear an explosion among many\nexplosions.  It is loud, but it is not going to stand out like a 1000\npound bomb or a tactical nuke.  There would be a hole blown in the wall,\nand some rubble, but with tanks knocking over walls, and other sources\nof buildings turning into rubble, and other covering racket such as\ngunfire, including 50's tacking away, it would not stand out that much,\nand could be explained by "musta been a gas leak... ".  I think it could be\ndone and not be reported under such conditions - it is POSSIBLE.  It is\nnot like a tank driving down a quiet street on a Sunday afternoon, turning\nand firing, you know.  THAT would stand out, and be pretty impossible\nto cover up.
The Dividians didn't have that option after the FBI cut off their\nelectricity.

I think I have updated info on this.  My understandingis that\nformer officer Cranston approached a teenager who was being questioned\nby another officer.   Officer Cranston struck Teenager A in the head\nwith a heavy police flashlight, causing a significant, though not\nlife-threatening.  THere is no evidence that Teenager A was\ndoing anything threatening at the time.  Teenager A was released\non bail/recognizance and filed a formal complaint against Officer\nCranston.  The Police Chief suspended Cranston pending an \ninvestigation into the use of excessive force.  \n	The above is pretty clear... but what seems to have \nhappened is this.  The Chief requested Cranston's gun, but Cranston\nrefused to turn it over until the Chief went the Cranston's home\n to get it.  Sources said Cranston had always wanted to be\na cop and was very afraid of loosing his job because of the complaint\nagainst him.\n	A few days afterward, Cranston allegedly walked into \nWilson's Garage, where Teenager A and friends were known to\nhang out and work on cars as a hobby.  Cranston fatally shot\nTeenager A as well as TEenagers B and C.  Teenager D was shot once\nin the shoulder/chest.  Teenager E was working under the car\nand was not noticed by Officer Cranston.  Teenager D went to a home\nand summoned police, who went to Wilson's Garage and found the \n3 corpses and one unscathed survivor.
Hi,\n\nIn Canada, any gun that enters a National Park must be sealed (I think it's a\nsmall metal tag that's placed over the trigger).  The net result of this is\nthat you _can't_ use a gun to protect yourself from bears (or psychos) in the\nNational Parks.  Instead, one has to be sensitive to the dangers and annoyances\nof hiking in bear country, and take the appropriate precautions.\n\nI think this policy makes the users of the National Parks feel a little closer\nto Nature, that they are a part of Nature and, as such, have to deal with\nnature on it's own terms.

I HEARTILY agree.  Now that the BATF warrant has been \n     unsealed, it is CLEAR that Clinton and Reno supported an\n     ILLEGAL raid.  Did they not KNOW this?\n\n\n\n     NO authority for a 'no-knock" raid\n     NO authority to use helicopters.\n     NO authority to search for a "drug lab"\n\n    And, apparently, not even any authority to search for "automatic\n    weapons".
For me, it would be an obvious choice: Armed self-defence is clearly\nand strongly protected by the Colorado Constitution and the laws\nof the state. In the very clear-cut situation of your hypothetical,\nI wouldn't have anything to fear from the police (unless I had been\npublicly carrying the weapon concealed, something I'm not in\nthe habit of doing... Even then, the worst I'd have to deal with \nwas a class 2 misdemeanor.) Even if the situation were not so\nclear, and I might have to worry about arrest for manslaughter or\nhomicide, it would still be safer to wait for the police. If\nI were to leave and try to avoid police involvement, I'd be committing\nseveral felonies and ruining my chances of claiming self-defence\nin court ("If it really was self-defence," the prosecuter would\nask, "why did you run away and hide from the police?")\n\nIn other states, however, this decision might not be so clear-cut:\nIf someone in, say, Washington D.C. were to use a gun in self-defence\nhe would _automatically_ be guilty of several felony violations of\nthat city's gun control laws. Such a person's choices would be\nbetween certain conviction for a couple of felonies versus possible\nconviction for half a dozen.
No answer.\n\n\nI do not feel like the cameras were out of range.  Cameras watched the first \nconfrontation.  Cameras watched the banners.  Cmaeras watched the final \nconfrontation with tanks.  Cameras watched the fire.  When weren't cameras \nable to watch?  When would cameras be unable to watch people coming out with \ntheir hands up?\n\n\nWell, that is what BATF should have done.  Either, Koresh would have gone \npeaceably as he has done in the past, or perhaps it was already too close \nto the apocalypse in his own mind.  It is hard to predict the actions of \na leader who would not release the children when most rational people would.\n\nNow will you answer my question up top?
NUT CASE PANICS!!!!JUMPS THE GUN ON THE NET BEFORE GETTING FACTS STRAIGHT!!!!
com\n\n\n\nOn a DA revolver, you get another try on a misfire.  On a pistol where\nthe trigger does not cock the hammer, like a Jennings, or an Astra M400,\nor a Glock, a misfire requires the slide be cycled to get the gun  to\nfunction.\n\nRather than a high capacity revolver, think of a Glock as an Astra M400 \nwith no manual safety and a heavier trigger pull.
So?  Look in the trunk some time.  Heck - look at the dash.  That\nfunny thing attached with a quick-release is a gun.  The ones in the\ntrunk are "better".  (I don't have numbers for Chicago, but\nPhiladelphia police cars carried multiple automatic weapons and\nthousands of rounds as standard issue in the 60s.)\n\n\nWhat is the nature of this disadvantage?  If the cop can shoot, 6\nrounds will do the job against a single opponent (especially since the\ncop has guaranteed backup).  If the "gang member" can shoot, the extra\nrounds don't help.  The only time this difference can matter is if\nneither can shoot, and cops aren't supposed to be throwing lead around\nlike that.\n\nBTW - most cops carry multiple guns.  You're not supposed to know\nabout the second, third, and so on.\n\n\nHow do "we" know that they were gang members and not undercover cops\nor even law-abiding menacing minorities.  BTW - Why the sneer quotes?\n\nThey were actually practicing\n\nThen the extra rounds won't make any difference, so why is it an issue?\n\n-andy
Proof by assertion!  I love it!  Uh, please explain why the smugglers\ndo not also rank a notch below (or above) the military in terms\nof communications, intelligence gathering (e.g., why fight officials\nwhen you can bribe them..."I'll give you a hundred grand to let that\nsemi past..."), and firepower. \n\nWhat's the point here?  You're arguing that the black market\nWORKS (which it does, of course).  \n\n\nThis is the wrong way to quantify things.  The smuggler would\nbe concerned about value/cubic foot.  Go to a gun show and\nprice out a crate of good quality handguns.  \n\n\nWhat's "local?"  \n\n\nWhat is a worthwhile firearm?  Hell, anything that WORKS!  Go\nget yourself a copy of the Army's 1969 Improvised Munitions Manual.\nSee how easy it is to make a functional firearm.\n\n\nIf paying $10 for inconspicuous parts at the local K-Mart is\n"through the nose." \n\nDrew
I agree.  Sad, but true.\n\n\nPlease name one.\n\n\n.... Upon which our Bill of Rights is based.  Some delusion.\n\n\nIf this were not true in practice, then certain unethical politicians would\nnot be passing gun control laws.  Politicians are generally whores to public\nopinion.  This does NOT mean the the public is either well informed or correct.\nAs for the stats,  anyone can support anything with the right stats.  The \n"right" stats, from what I've seen, are sometimes even used to support\nconflicting sides of the same issue.\n\n\n\nUsed to own firearms? While armed insurrection, as the FF's of the Const. \nmay have envisioned seems to me a somewhat fanatical approach to avoiding this,\nPolitical protest is still an option at this point.

I hope you realize how trivial it is to manufacture these compounds.  Given\nabout $10k in lab equipment and chemicals (which are commercially available)\nand given the knowledge that I have (graduating BS, Ch, 1993) I could \nsynthesize enough of these compounds to make a serious dent in the population\nof several major US cities.  As also noted, the knowledge is there for\nthe production of nuclear weapons.  It's not even that restricted.  The\nonly thing is the expense.  \n\nNow I'm not going around making these things, but it's not 'cause of any\nlaw; I simply don't get any marginal benefit out of killing anyone.  Any\nlaw you enact in this respect is only going to give you the ability to \nadd a charge against someone who does make and use said weapons.  In the\ncase of chemical agents, I seriously doubt that you would even know that\nsomeone had set up a lab until after the weapons had been used.  \n\nPart of the trouble with the chemical-weapons ban treaty between the US\nand the USSR is that many of the precursors to chemical weapons such as\nGB and Sarin, etc., is that they have very valid commercial uses, and \nit is very easy to divert those precursors to chemical weapons manufacture\nwithout anyone knowing about it.
Waco is a city of about 100,000 people.  The population temporarily\n   raised to about 102,000 people when all the feds, and state police officers\n   arrived.\n\n	I tell you what, I stayed in a hotel room about 4 miles from the BD\n   compound around 3 weeks ago.  I have never felt more paranoid in my whole\n   life.  There were at least 100 state police in the hotel.
What happened in Waco is not the fault of the BATF. If they would of\nhad the proper equipment and personal then they could of captured the\ncompound on the initial assault and none of this would of happened.\n\nThe BATF needs more people, better weapons and more armored\ntransports. When they meet hostile fire they should be able to use\nmore force instead of retreating to a stand off. If you are going to\ndo a job then do it right. The BATF is there to protect us and they\nmust have the proper equipment and people to do the job.\n\nWith the WoD and the increased crime in the streets the BATF is needed\nmore now then ever. If they blast away a few good fokes then that is\nthe price we all have to pay for law and order in this country. Look\nat all the good people that died in wars to protect this great country\nof ours.

I DEMAND\nthe dismissal or resignation of Lloyd Bensen, Secretary of the Treasury,\nwho bears responsibility for the initial helicopter and grenade attack \nby the ATF against the Branch Davidians, and of Janet Reno, who authorized \nthe final assault on the very day that we were commemorating the Warsaw\nghetto revolt.  And I would truly appreciate it if you would make\nsure something like this never happens again on your watch.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nKenneth D. Whitehead\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nGet involved, gang.  It's your Republic.  Let's take it back.
SeAL Team six should have handled it?  Delta Force?  The\nBATF had more than enough equipment and men.  They did not have\ngood intel, but they did have poor planning.  They fucked up.  Even\nin just the most basic military sense, they fucked up.  Excuses do\nnot justify body counts.\n\n\n	And your excuses fall upon deaf ears when the same BATF\nhas shown shitty leadership despite more people, better weapons,\nand exclusive use of armor against their targets.  BATF is nothing\nmore than a private army of the government.  Do the agents swear an\noath, as I did, to uphold the Constitution?  You know, that document\nthat stipulates the highest law of the land?  If they do, they should\nbe up for charges in a court of law.  Remember, the law?  That's\nthe whole reason for any of this.\n\n\n	Yeah, I've been related to many of them.  This is flame-bait,\nright?  I'm not paying your price.  Mind if I sight in my guns on\nyour body?  Think of it as the price you have to pay that we may all\nlive without fear of my making a stray shot.  It's fine and dandy to\nrevel in the other guy being the target and your supposed safety.  In\nthe military, we called this "chicken shit."  Leadership from the rear.\nThe War on Drugs, despite being a catchy term for nothing more than\na continuation of policy since before this century, seems to have\ngotten you convinced that my rights aren't worth your good vibes.\nMind if I cut your net access, as well as access to any and all forms\nof expression?  See, you make me nervous, what with you being able\nto influence so many.  I'm sure you can see how this is the price we\nhave to pay for freedom and liberty in this country, as well as\na fair and unbiased judiciary.\n\n\n	Mind if we include you in the body count?  I'm sure we could\nall file it under "civic improvement" and your life wouldn't have\nbeen sacrificed in vain.  If you like, you can will your estate to\ndefecit reduction, too.  Now, when you learn how the law protects, or\ndoesn't protect, everybody equally and how our collective boot may\none day be on your collective throat, perhaps at that time you will\nmature enough to realize just what you're talking about and how\nserious this is.\n\n	Next time, include a smiley.  While I hesitate to think that\nyou could have meant this seriously, it deserved a small flame anyway.

Just want to back this up with a personal anecdote.  My grandparents\nhave a Navajo rug made in the 1920's, which they received in trade \nfrom the weaver while living in Flagstaff, Arizona.  The decorative motif\nconsists of 4 large black swastikas, one in each corner.  What's more, the\ncolor scheme is black, white, and red.  To the casual glance it would\nundoubtedly appear to be a Nazi relic of some kind.  Yet they owned it\nten years before Hitler and the National Socialists came to power.  \n\nAs I recall, they took it down in the 30's, and didn't feel quite right\nabout putting it back up until the 60's.  It still draws comments from \nthose who don't know what it is.\n\n--ccm\n\n-- \nChristopher C. May * U. of Ariz.

^^^^^^^\n \nYou can't spell. There is no question about it.\n\n \nWe must be reading different public opinion polls. I agree that the\nmisguided public would like to see assault weapons banned (mainly because\nthey are being lied to by the media about the frequency of their use\nin violent crime ... ~1%), but if public opinion were so dead-set\nagainst the RKBA you can bet that idiots like Metzenbaum and Schumer\nwould be seeing their foolish bills getting passed through Congress\na LOT easier than they are. And as governments go broke and can no\nlonger protect their citizens you can bet that the American people\nwill start to really appreciate the usefulness of firearms. Contrary \nto what you might think, time is probably on OUR side, not YOURS.\n\n \nYeah, right. Don't hold your breath. My condolences on the discovery\nof uncomfortable resilience in your mammary glands, but this has nothing\nto do with the issue at hand.\n\n... ridiculous tripe deleted ...\n \n \nYeah, the liberal press doesn't like us much, but you can't really\nexpect coherent thought from them anyway. Their opinions are based\nmore on a desire to appear politically correct than on facts (which\nare generously provided by the FBI, if they'd bother to put on their\nBirkenstocks and go to the library to read them). Most of my friends\nare anti-gun, and without exception NONE of them bases his/her opinions\non facts. They would rather believe (despite all evidence to the\ncontrary) that disarming law-abiding citizens would make the world\nmore civilized, when all it really does is make us all sheep. They \nwould rather wallow in their pitiful liberal white guilt about how\nsociety has driven the criminal to rob, rape, and murder. They \nsupport spending millions of public dollars protecting the rights of scum\nwho have already demonstrated that they have no regard for society\nor its laws. They ignore the fact that areas with the strictest gun\ncontrol (NYC,DC) have the worst crime and areas with little gun\ncontrol (VT,NH,ID) have very little crime in comparison. But they\nhave to ignore this because otherwise they would need to confront\nthe fact that law-abiding citizens who own guns are not the ones that\nare causing most of the trouble in society. Oh no, we certainly can't\naccept that! But I guess I have faith that when crime starts making\nsignificant inroads into their neighborhoods and starts directly\nhurting them and their families, they will probably whistle a different\ntune. They just better hope it isn't too late then.\n\n \nHmmm. I wasn't expecting company tonight. I might be able to whip\nup a quick cheese and cracker plate, but they should probably bring\ntheir own drinks. Do I have time to vacuum the rug?\n\n\nI'm glad you ended the posting here.

"Put not your trust in princes" is the Biblical proverb.  The modern\nanalog is governments.  At the time of the founding of the US, the\nidea that citizens had rights above those of the government was not\nthat common, but was explicit in the writings of the founders.  To a\nconsiderable extent, Englishmen also had those rights.\n\nYes, times change, and technology changes.  The possibility of \na few governments enserfing all of mankind was not possible until\nquite recently.  In the feudal system, the lord was almost as\nrestricted as the serfs, so having the people enserf themselves\ndoes not make anything better; most feudal lords, and even most\nslaveowners, did not mistreat those under them.\n\nFreedom of speech and freedom of religion are under real attack NOW.
In the interests of completeness, I thought readers of these \nnewsgroups would want to see FBI Director William Sessions'\nstatement, as released by the FBI press office.\n\n FBI Director's Statement On Waco Standoff\n To: National Desk\n Contact: Federal Bureau of Investigation, Press Office,\n          202-324-3691\n\n   WASHINGTON, April 19 -- The following is a statement by \nFBI Director William S. Sessions regarding the Branch Davidian \nincident in Waco, Texas:
Hm.  A previous poster argued that the fact that the BD's did not rush to\nescape the burning building indicated that it was they, and not any of the\ngovernment actions, that started the fire.  On the other hand, I wonder if,\nwith a face full of "massive amounts of CS," *I* would be able to escape\na burning tinder-box like that ranch house assuming my best efforts.\n--
I think its an attempt to show lives_saved v lives_lost; all other\n gun related crimes don't result in lives_lost.  On the other hand,\n its impossible to know how many of the successful self defenses \n prevented lives from being lost.  In other words, the lives_lost\n is pretty clear [its the homicide and non negligent manslaughter\n number], while the lives saved is some percentage of the successful \n self defenses.  Clearly that percentage doesn't have to be real \n high to show that lives_saved > lives_lost.\n\nAs a semi-related point, check out Kleck's "Point Blank".  I believe\n it goes into some related areas; it also is well written and informative.
Actually all the liberals I've seen have deplored the burning of \nchildren. I would far preferred that the Davidians had not set the \nfire that burned themselves and their children to death, but I don't \nbelieve that the responsibility for the fire (or the almost complete \nabsense of attempts to escape the blaze) can be placed at the door of \nthe Federal authorities.\n\n\n    Not so. My wife got me a convenient plastic "drip pan" for Christmas...\n\n\n    Yeah, those Nazis. You know how we liberals just love those Nazis.\n\n\n    Yeah, as information trickles in... funny how that works...
Did you forget to put in a sarcasm flag?
"A handful of anti-gun zealots are telling the public that their\nright to self-defense is of less importance than the interests of\nHandgun Control, Inc.  This action comes as local, state and federal law\nenforcement officials continue their assault on the Branch Davidian\ncompound--an assault which has already resulted in the death of one\ntwo year old child at the hands of federal agents.  This has highlighted\nthe need for citizens to be able to defend themselves and their children\nagainst the excesses of their own government."\n\n\n  "Any suggestion by opponents that this bill will increase crime is a \ndistortion of the facts, at best.  The aggressive outreach by officials\nin central Florida to train and arm women has led to a dramatic drop in\nthe level of assault and rape in that area.  Of course, this program is\na rare gem, as many law enforcement officials apparently believe that an\nunarmed citizenry will be easier to control, and thus favor tighter \nrestrictions."\n\n\n   "The vote today is a tribute to the good sense of the public at large\nwho are putting their lives on the line every day as they go about their\nlawful affairs.  The entire country knows how vulnerable the average \ncitizen is, both to attacks from criminals and from armed assault by our\nown police.  Texas lawmakers who voted for this concealed handgun bill have\nshown total understanding for those innocent, law-abiding citizens on the\nfront lines, and the families of those who have fallen."\n\n\n   "I urge the House of Representatives to pay attention to the needs\nof their constituents, and not be stampeded by ill-conceived arguments\nfrom ideological fanatics."\n\nAin't propaganda fun?
Could someone email me a USNail address for the NRA? I'd like to write them\na letter encouraging them to see to it VERY EMPHATICALLY that the 2nd\namendment is restored to the form that the founding fathers intended.\n\nPeople like Howard Metzenbaum seem very intent on diluting the 2nd amendment\nto the point where it is no effort for the governmentski to do what they\ndid in Waco.\n\nAfter all, from what I know of the Federalist papers, it is this kind of\ntyranny the 2nd amendment was supposed to be designed to protect against.\n\nHonestly! M-60 tanks against the civilian population! Attack helicopters!\n\nWe need the right to keep and bear anti-tank weapons. Actually, if they\nintend to mass armour against the (weakly-armed, at that) civilian population,\nwe need the right to field tactical nukes. Government tyranny! Who would\nhave ever thought it would happen here!\n\nI wonder who'se house they'll run tanks through next, because the gov.\nSUSPECTS child abuse. Maybe yours! Maybe mine!\nAnd what is an Illegal Weapon (which they have yet to show us), if the\n2nd amendment is designed to do what I believe it is, and the gov. uses\ntanks against you? Government self-serving? Naaaah. Not here.\n\nTime was when the U.S. used armour/attack helicopters against small countries.\nNow, we're down to using them against to what amounts to a busload and a\nhalf of civilians.\n\n"First they came for the Jews, but I did not stop them, because I was\nnot a Jew: Then they came for the catholics, but I did not stop them\nbecause I was not a catholic! Then they came for the lutherans, but\nthere was now no one left to stop them!" Rev. Martin Niemoller.\n(probably didn't get it verbatim, but you get the idea).\n\nIf the NRA reads this, then never mind about the address.\nGod save us!

Neglecting that the government and media have bullshitted the\npeople almost nonstop on this issue, Constitutional limitations are\nthere to prevent a 'tyrrany of the majority'.  For example, a majority\ncould vote that given ethnics have no rights, are not people, etc.\nand it would fly using the logic above.\n\nWhen government feels the Constitution is not right for the times,\nthere is a procedure called an AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION.  THis\nis deliberately difficult, and cumbersome, to prevent abuse of those\nwho decide to ignore the people, or impose unjust policies of a\nmajority on a minority.   A lynch mob is a majority, remember, outvoting\nthe hangee.\n\nWhat the government is doing are VIOLATIONS, end-runs around the\nlimitations on the government, probably because they know that the\npeople would be very hard to convince that a good intention is behind\ntampering with the Bill of Rights.  Government propeganda on guns has\nbeen very strong and persistant, but not THAT strong.  And it just\nshows how gullible the people have become to "I am from the government\nand am here to help you sort of line".  We have been lied to, fed\nhalf truths, rigged stats, while the government knows their control\nlaws have no effect on crime.  They want a government monopoly on\nforce, pure and simple.  Do you REALLY want the government to be able\nto override Constitutional limitations by a simple vote of a bunch\nof elitists (congresscritters)?  I sure don't.  The Founding Fathers\nsure as hell didn't, either.\n\n<> Mox nix, Mr. Rutledge.  YOU are the only one here claiming that the\n<-> RKBA is dependent on the existence of a top-flight, well-regulated\n<-> militia.  Why this is a false assumption has already been posted a \n<-> number of times.  \n<\n<No, I simple stated that the people have a right to "join a well\n<organized militia."  And I have also stated that a militia that\n<meets once or twice a year is clearly "well organized."  And this\n<state of readiness that I have claimed the people have a "right"\n<to, is the same state of readiness expected of the militia as stated\n<by Hamilton. \n\nYou better read the Senate Subcommitte on the Constitution regarding the\nSecond Amendment, and a linguist's analisys of the Second itself.\nIN the meanwhile, show us some stuff to back up your assertions.\nAnd yes, I have the above mentioned documents (and more) online.
Correction: The *FBI* *says* that two of the nine who escaped said the fire\nwas deliberately set by cult members.  Since the press was kept miles away,\nwe have absolutely no independent verification of any of the government's\nclaims in this matter.
I don't think such a Canada is any more "culturally similar" to\nthe United States than England. In terms of laws regarding individual\nrights, restrictions on police searches, etc... (all closely\nrelated to crime) Canadian laws parallel England's and differ\ngreatly from those of the United States.\n  \n\nActually, they do not have "roughly the same... urban economy", \nand extremely different ethnic composition.\n\n\nHowever, if you account for economic and ethnic differences,\nthe difference disappears completely: Seattle's minorities are\npredominatly poor, while Vancouver's are middle or upper class.\nThe rates for whites in both cities were found to be identicle,\nwhile the rate for poor, Seattle minorities was almost three\ntimes as great as for the well-to-do minorities of Vancouver.\nThe pattern seems to be one of poverty and race relations, not\none of gun control.\n\n\nThat is a gross distortion: "Self-defense" does not mean killing\nthe attacker. There were 21 cases of civilians killing their \nattacker in self-defence. But such cases represent less that\n0.5% of the crimes prevented by armed self-defence; for every\ncase you cite, there were over 200 other cases of self-defence\nwhere the crime was prevented but the attacker was not killed.\n(0.5%, by the way, is the most conservative possible figure,\nbased on the National Crime Survey's estimate of 80,000\ncrimes prevented by armed self-defence each year. Most other \nstudies on the subject put the figure at 500,000 to 600,000.\nThose figures would imply less than 0.08% of sucessful self-defences\ninvolve killing the attacker.) \n\nSo, more correctly, there over 4000 (possibly as many as 25,000) \ncases of civilians acting in self-defence, only 21 of which resulted\nin the death of the attacker. This is a significant factor, in\ncomparison to the 592 homicides. If memory serves, homicides\nmake up approximately 1% of the violent crimes the study\nconsidered, so the fair comparison would be 40 - 250 homicides\nprevented and 592 homicides. Clearly, the study can not be\nclose to accurate, since it ignored these cases of self-defence.
And another survivor claims he heard someone shouting "The fire's started!".\nOdd terminology.  That's what one says when you know a fire is planned, not \nwhen one occurs by accident.  We will have to wait and see what the evidence \nshows, assuming one is willing to believe any evidence offered by the \n"distrustful ones".\n\n\nNeither.  Again I was merely addressing the sanity level of the players.  \nI agree that the BATF handled the affair badly from day one.  BTW, I heard \non the news today that the affadavit behind the no-knock warrant was unsealed \ntoday.  Grenade launcher was the only thing on the list that I found \nunusual.\n\n\nAmbitious news reporters could use the documentary filmed by an Australian \nin 1992 on the compound grounds to help identify survivors.  I, for one, \nwill check their stories for consistency with what I learned in a long \nnews story about that documentary.\n\n\nCertainly there is some room for doubt.  I certainly reserve the right \nto change my opinions when new evidence warrants such a change.  If I \nwere conspiratorially minded, however, I would never be able to change \nmy mind, because any evidence I disliked would have to be a lie \nfabricated by the "distrustful ones".
I HATE long postings, but this turned out to be rather lengthy....\n\n\nOverall Crime rate:\nIt fell....just like that...\n\nAcquiring weapons in Norway:\nYou can buy (almost) all kinds of weapons in Norway, BUT you must have a \npermit, and a good reason to get the permit....\nIf I would like to have a handgun, i would have to get an gun-licence from \nthe police and to be a member of a gun-club.\nThe police would check my criminal records for any SERIOUS crimes and/or\nrecords of SERIOUS mental diseases.\nNow, if a got my licence, I would have to be an active member of the gun\n-club for 6 months BEFORE I could collect my gun.\nIt's a little like getting a drivers licence isn't it ???\nYou have to prove that you CAN drive before you are allowed to...\n\nUse of guns in crimes (in Norway):\nSome crimes are commited with guns that have been in the owners 'arms'\nfor a long time, but these are rather the exeption.\nMost criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes, and mostly short \ntime befor the crime.\n\nUse of knives:\nIt IS allowed to cary knifes in public, but not in your belt or 'open'.\nYou (Americans) think it's ok to have a gun, but not to carry it open\nin public -rigth ??\n\nScandinavians ARE 'aggressive':\nWe northeners are not as hot-livered as southeners, but when we decide\nto take action we DO.\nAsk ANY historian or millitary with an knowledge of europe....\n(Or ask any German who served in Norway in WW2.....)\n\nIndividual vs masses:\nYes the individual is more important than the masses, but only to some\nextent....\nYour criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses ??\nWhat happens when the rigths of some individuals affects the rights of \nall the others ??\n\n\nThe issue:\nI believe the issue is GUNS, and gun-legislation.\nWe shouldn't mix weapons and items that can serve as one....\nIF i lived in Amerika I would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in HOME.\nBut should it have to be like that ??\nDo you think it's wise to sell guns like candy (some states do...) ??\nIf you believe it's smart/neccacery to have drivers-licence WHY do you think\nit should be free to buy guns ??\n\nDisclaim-her:\nI'm not a pacifist or anti gun. \nI would defend my home, loved ones and country, but I don't view guns as\nneccities or toys.\nI HAVE done army service, and HAVE used a variaty of weapons, but wouldn't\nwant to have one for self defence or because they 'feel good'....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n	This is not a .signature.\n	It's marly a computergenerated text to waste bandwith\n	and to bring down the evil Internet.
And another one:\n\nHasn't enyone heard of a leader's recon?  This is when the leader of the\nassult goes and looks at the objective to see if anything has changed that\nwould affect the mission.

However, don't forget that the police in Chicago can carry just about\nanything they want except for the Glock, which is not approved for\ncarry (Guess they figure all cops are like the Police Chief of Winnetka,\nwho happened to let off a stray round of 9mm. This is the same anti-gun\npolice chief that wanted full-auto Uzis for his patrol cars...).\n\nPerhaps in the judgement of the majority of Chicago's finest, a close-to-\n100% reliable weapon like a revolver is preferable to a 99.99% reliable\nautomatic. I note that in Germany, where certainly the 9mm semi-auto\nhandgun is king, some of the more elite police types want revolvers.\n\nI don't think the issue is cost, because Chicago police certainly make\non the order of at least $40K/year. \n\nYour presumption of "disadvantage" I think is not borne out by the\nexperiences of New York City's cops; there the cops usually come out\non top with their standard .38 Spl revolvers.\n\nI've seen S&Ws, Rugers and Beretta 9mms in addition to the revolvers\ncarried by Chicago cops.... in the past, I've seen .45 M1911s; others\nhave seen Browning Hi-Powers...
jrm@gnv.ifas.ufl.edu:\n\n   Firearms tend to fall into this low dollar/pound area.  It would not\n   be economic to smuggle them in.  All production would have to be\n   local.  There are not all that many people who have both the skill\n   AND motivation to assemble worthwhile firearms from scratch.\n   High-ranking crime figures could obtain imported Uzis and such, but\n   the average person, and average thug, would be lucky to get a zip-gun\n   - and would pay through the nose for it.\n\nGood point you make.  However, a zip gun, by definition, is a crude,\nhomemade gun--certainly not something capable of sustained, accurate\nfire, but it would be useful as a means of getting a normal gun.  Recall\nthe tiny, single-shot pistols made by the Allies during World War II for\nuse by partisans.  They were essentially well-made zipguns, incapable of\neffective fire beyond a few feet.  But they were useful as a means of\nkilling German soldiers for their guns.\n\nAlso note that the crowd-pleasin' favorite, the Sten gun, was\nspecifically designed to require as little machine work as possible.\nThe point's been made here that one could make a Sten clone with steel\ntubing, hand tools and a welder.\n\nI still think that while the point is good, I think there's a difference\nbetween marijuana and firearms, in that quality marijuana can be grown\nlocally; there's no need to import the stuff.  If guns are banned, I\nthink the demand for "real" guns will be sufficient to make smuggling\neconomically feasible, thus rendering a ban moot.  In any case, the\nresult would be the same--people who aren't criminals won't have\nfirearms, and "bad guys" will continue to have access to them, one way\nor another.  And I don't see that as a necessary situation.
That's a revisionist account of what happened.  Gritz was well-aware\nof Duke's presence on the ticket.  Given that Gritz is not at all shy\nabout associating and promoting other white supremacists (such as the\nChristian Identity movement or Willis Carto), whatever reasons Gritz\nhad to leave the ticket had nothing to do with Duke's presence.\n\n\nI believe Chip Berlet has a Populist Party newsletter from the time with\na photo of Gritz happily shaking hands with Duke.
This is REALLY STUPID nitpicking.  Capitalization rules in the late 18th\ncentury were quite different from today, and what was posted matches current\ncapitalization rules.\n\nWe also don't make 's' look like 'f' and other such things done in the late\nseventeen hundreds.\n\nIn the original Constitution, "militia", "arms", etc. were capitalized simply\nbecause they were nouns.  This is also done currently in German.  There is\nno special significance to these words simply because they are capitalized.\nThe capitalization denotes no special emphasis.\n\n-Pete Zakel\n (phz@cadence.com or ..!uunet!cadence!phz)

Despite opposition to the ban --\naired largely by firearms owners at a series of public meetings on\nthe issue -- the Common Council voted on February 17 to place the\nreferendum on the ballot, allowing only seven weeks of campaigning to\nreverse public opinion on the controversial issue.\n \nAn October 1992 poll conducted by the Wisconsin State Journal found\n57% in support and 38% opposed, with 5% expressing no opinion.  By\nelection day, of the more than 56,000 voters who went to the polls,\n51% cast ballots in opposition to the proposal while 49% voted to\nhave the Madison Common Council enact such a ban.  The campaign\ncommittee, spearheaded by the Wisconsin Pro-Gun Movement and NRA-ILA,\nrelied on neighborhood canvassing, direct mail and radio/TV\nadvertising to educate voters on the civil liberties implications\nraised by enforcement of the ban if the referendum was approved.\n \nDespite the surprising defeat, it is expected that the Madison\ninitiative's chief proponent, Mayor Paul Soglin, will attempt to have\nthe Common Council enact an ordinance banning handguns.\n \n                Downloaded from GUN-TALK (703-719-6406)\n                A service of the\n                National Rifle Association\n                Institute for Legislative Action\n                Washington, DC 20036

^^^^^^^ Militia\n\n                  ^^^^^ State\n\n        ^^^^ Arms\n\nYou didn't even get the capitalization correct!  Try reading USCA on\nthe Constitution, or get any other CORRECT version of the\nConstitution. \n\n\nPerhaps you should actually READ the Federalist Papers!!\n\n    James Madison, Federalist Paper 46: "Besides the advantage of\n    being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost\n    every other nation, the existence of subordinate governments, to\n    which the people are attached, and by which the militia officers\n    are appointed, forms a barrier against the enterprises of\n    ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government\n    of any form can admit of.  Notwithstanding the military\n    establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are\n    carried as far as the public resources will bear, the governments\n    are afraid to trust the people with arms."\n                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n    James Madison, I Annals of Congress 434, 8 June 1789: "The right\n    of the people to keep and bear... arms shall not be infringed.  A\n    well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people,\n                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n    trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free\n    country..."\n\n    Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Paper 29 (on the organization of\n    the militia): "Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with\n    respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed\n               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n    and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it\n    will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of\n    a year."\n\n    Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Paper 29 (speaking of standing\n    armies): "... if circumstances should at any time oblige the\n    government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be\n    formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large\n    body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n    discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their\n                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*****\n    own rights and those of their fellow-citizens."\n    ***^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nBut *surely* Hamilton and Madison didn't mean the PEOPLE when they\nsaid "people", right?  That's why the Amendment refers to "the Right\nof the Militia"?...  ;-)\n\n\nYou're right, the Militia consists of ALL able bodied males (and\nprobably females under current interpretation). \n\n\nThe Amendment does nor refer to "well organized", it says "well\nregulated".  I have some targets you may examine if you wish to check\nhow _well regulated_ I am. \n\n\n\nCorrect.  That's why the Right is reserved to the People.  And that\nwas to insure the People could form a "well regulated Militia", not a\n"well organized militia".\n\n\nWhat do Atomic Units have to do with this argument?  Any moron can set\nh_bar = C = 1...\n\n\nOh, I see what your question is; Why don't you read the federalist\nPapers?! \n\n    James Madison, Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the "General\n    Welfare" clause): "Nothing is more natural nor common than first\n    to use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a\n    recital of particulars."\n\nBut what does Madison know about the grammatical style of the 2nd?  He\nonly wrote it.\n\n\nThat's obviously because you've never actually *read* the Federalist\nPapers. \n\n\nCan't read, huh?  Show me where the document says "well organized\nmilitia". \n\n\nThat is *exactly* why EVERY PERSON should be allowed to own *any*\nweapon currently in use in the armed forces.\n\n\nBut the major reason is to protect against that very same army.\n\n\n    Abraham Lincoln, First Inaugural Address, March 4, 1861: "This\n    country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit\n    it.  Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government,\n    they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it, or\n    their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it."\n\n    Rep. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, spoken during floor debate\n    over the Second Amendment, I Annals of Congress at 750, 17 August\n    1789: "What, Sir, is the use of a militia?

And why is this Freeman?  Even if a pro-gun person doesn't know what they are\ntalking about there is always the possibility that they will learn a thing or\ntwo.  I am and will continue to post even if people get angry with what I have\nto say.  I have several good sources of material now that I know where to look\nso calm down.\n\nAh, Freeman seems to forget from my statement that I am learning.  I have also\nasked several of the not-so-hostile folks on this group for sources of\ninformation to read.  Do you think, Freeman, that maybe this means I am\ninterested in learning?  I think it does because as you said people who don't\nknow anything won't be good for the pro-gun cause.\n\nAnother good habit to get into is to realize that not everyone is you Freeman\nand accept mistakes.  Sure, maybe it could have been some type of\nmisinformation being slung by some anti-gun nut but it wasn't.  I made my\nstatement to inform everyone of this and everyone who replied said don't worry\nabout it but also to learn as much as you can.  They accepted my mistake and\ngave me sources of information and told me to read as much as possible.  I have\nread several posts of yours and have found them informative.  Why don't you\ngive me the same chance?
But whatever the neutrons hit has a good chance of absorbing the\nneutron and becoming radioactive itself. Mostly, that means water\nturning into (harmless) heavy water. But some neutrons would \nalso hit bones, and the resulting harmfull, secondard radioactives\nwould remain in the body for decades. I think an unshielded nuclear\nwarhead could reasonably be considered a public health hazard.\n\nAs for a shielded warhead, I think a fair amount of maintaince\nis required for it to remain safely shielded (e.g. storage in\na dry, temperature-regulated facility, etc...) For private\nownership to be unregulated, I think a single individual must\nbe able not only to keep the weapon, but keep it in a safe\ncondition. If any random private citizen could not properly\nkeep, maintain and store a nuclear weapon, then some regulation\nis clearly appropriate.\n\n\n\nI disagree with this purpose: The job of the militia is to defend\nthemselves and their community. If you look at the American \nrevolution as an example, the militias won by seperating themselves\nfrom, and becoming independent of, a repressive government. They\ndidn't overthrow it, and those communities (Canada and England, for \nexample) that didn't defend themselves were still under that same\nold regime. If the role of the militia were offensive, to go out and\ndestroy repressive governments, nuclear weapons _might_ be appropriate.\nBut their jobs is defensive, and nuclear weapons aren't suited\nfor that.\n\nThere is also the question of personal and collective arms: The\nSecond Amendment definately protects ownership of personal\nweapons (since the very nature of the militia requires members\nto provide their own arms.) But it isn't clear if it covers\nother arms. Certainly, not all members would supply (for example)\na tank, only a few could or (if they were to be used effectively)\nshould. However, those providing the heavy weapons have a \ndisproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower.\nThe militias, as the framers envisioned them, were extremely\ndemocratic: If only 50% of the members supported the cause, only\n50% would respond to a muster, and the militia's firepower would\nbe proportionately reduced. Militia firepower and the popular\nwill were, therefore, linked. But if a small minority of the\nmembers supplied a large fraction of the firepower (in the\nform of heavy weapons) this would all change: The militia's\nfirepower would depend on the will of a small minority, not\nof the general public. Worse, that minority would be quite\ndifferent from the general public (at the very least, they\nwould be much richer.) As a result, I think the nature and\ncharacter of the militia requires that each member provide\na roughly equal share of the militia's firepower: His personal\nweapons, and some equitable fraction of a squad's heavier firepower.
No. The issue is reducing crime, not guns. If gun control doesn't\nlower crime overall, then is doesn't address the issue.\n\n\nDoes that matter if assaults with a baseball bat become much\nmore common? Muggers using a gun rely primarily on the\nthreat of the gun, and rarely shoot their victim. A mugger\nusing a knife is much more likely to start by stabbing his victim \nin an effort incapacitate him. So, while a knif may not\nbe as deadly as a gun, criminals are more likely to actually\n_use_ the knife (as opposed to threatening the victim with it.)\nIt isn't at all clear that replacing the criminal's gun with a\nknife would reduce murders. Stabbings might just become more\ncommon. That's why it is important to look at the overall\n(not the with-gun) homicide rate. It avoids the issue of\nsubstitution, different criminal techinques of using different\nweapons, etc... and measures what we want to prevent: Murders.\n\n\n"Face"? Possibly. However, facing knife-welding attackers isn't\ntoo common: Stabbing without warning and by supprise is the\nusual tactic. Very few criminals shoot from cover: It attracts\nto much attention and they don't have a chance to go through your\npockets. Overall, I'd much rather be threatened with a gun\nthan actually stabbed with a knife.\n\n\nActually, the exact same statement is true of guns: Training in\nunarmed self-defence will let you disarm an untrained gunman \nwithout much problem.\n\nYou also ignore the criminal's reaction: The National Crime\nSurvey clearly shows that criminals (unarmed, armed with a\nknife, gun or whatever) are unwilling to risk their lives\nin a confrontation. If faced with a serious threat, almost\nall prefer to leave and find an easier target. Therefore,\nusing (or threatening to use, as is much more commonly the case)\na weapon _is_ the best defence against an attacker, regardless\nof how he is armed. Knives, however, are much less effective\nthan guns: Criminals don't consider knifes as a "serious threat"\nnearly as often as they do guns.

I suspect that you think that this is less lethal than the typical\n"assault weapon".  You are wrong.  Compared to what most criminals use, a\n9mm with military ammo (FMJs), or a military rifle (use is extremely\nrare), .223 or 7.62mm with military ammo (FMJs), the .32 H&R magnum with\n"civie" bullets is more lethal.  Most of the arms which criminals (and\nthe military) use are among the least lethal arms in existance.

UPI Washington DC, Update Desk			4/15/93\n\n  For the past several months the Clinton administration has been\n  stymied by mixed signals coming from the economy.  While most\n  leading indicators has shown an apparent improvement in the \n  economy, there has been no corresponding improvement in the area\n  of jobs creation.\n\n  The unemployment figures seem stalled at the 7% mark.  last month,\n  in an effort to understand this problem, President Clinton appointed\n  a blue ribbon panel to try to resolve the apparent conflicting\n  economic signals.  This panel was chaired by Vice President Gore.\n\n  Today the panel released their results, providing a shocking conclusion.\n  "It's the guns" Vice President Gore said.  Apparently NRA members, and other\n  "gun-nuts" are purchasing firearms at in record numbers, pulling the\n  economy out of the recession.  "Their buying them five times faster than\n  ever before, and stockpiling left and right", the Vice President said.  \n\n  However, since many domestic firearm and ammunition manufacturers have\n  been experiencing hard times during the past few years, including several\n  declarations of bankruptcy by many leading American gun makers, they have\n  not rushed to increase hiring to meet the new demand.\n\n  "We want to see if this run will continue before hiring more people", said\n  the President of Colt industries.  "As long as Clinton is in office, we\n  suspect it will", he added.\n\n  In response to this new information, President Clinton announced a new\n  Gun Control measure to be introduced into Congress this session.  It's \n  called the "Ban-One-A-Month" Gun Control Bill.  Under the terms of this law,\n  every make and model of all firearms will be written on individual index \n  cards.  The cards will all be put in a big hat and the President will draw\n  one card every month.  Sixty days later that gun will be banned from any\n  further manufacture/importation or sale in this country, except to the\n  politically connected and to members of the National Police Force.\n\n  The President said, "This law will benefit America two ways.  When the\n  Gun-Of-The-Month is announced every thirty days, the gun-nuts will run\n  out and buy thousands of them, boosting the economy even more.  In addition,\n  over the long run, we will get all of these icky-evil guns off of the\n  street."  He also announce the appointment of Sarah Brady to oversee\n  this program, citing her "Honesty, and unbiased view on the subject\n  of gun control".\n\n  Senators Metzenbaum, DeConcini, Feinstein, and Boxer have proposed an\n  amendment to the Bill which would add additional index cards containing\n  caliber designations for all know ammunitions.  "Their stockpiling,\n  stockpiling, stockpiling" screamed Metzenbaum during a press conference\n  at the national Headquarters of Handgun Control Inc.\n\n  Senators Simon, Metzenbaum, and Moyenhan also introduced an amendment\n  that would make all guns illegal to possess once the last card has been\n  drawn from the hat.  Senator Simon was quoted as saying, "First we'll\n  fuck em, then we'll kick em out of bed in the morning", during a press\n  conference he held in the second floor Mens Restroom of the Senate\n  building.  He of course was referring to the fact that he would allow\n  the people to purchase the guns to help the economy, but would require\n  the BATF to seize all of the guns in America sometime in the year 2008,\n  after all of the cards have been drawn.\n\n  The head of the BATF responded by saying, "We will have to see if this\n  thing in Waco is over by then.  We may be too busy to seize all those\n  guns".\n\n  US House Representatives Pat Schroeder and David Skaggs of Colorado\n  declared this proposed law as being "reasonable gun control which won't\n  affect anybodys Constitutional right to own sporting guns".\n\n  - end article -\n\n  For the humor impaired :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-) \n\n                                Bill Vojak\n                                vojak@icebucket.stortek.com\n				NRA, ILA,\n                                Colorado Firearms Coalition\n------------------------------------------------------------\nThe CBS Nightly Propaganda With Dan Rather.

Moreover, the BATF has admitted having agents in the compound, and as\nfar as I have been able to ascertain, those agents were still in the\ncompound when the first shots were fired.  For all we know, these two\npeople may BE the agents, who would certainly be unlikely to stay around\nand "cook" with the faithful...\n\nAssuming the two people in question were even in the compound at all.\n\nMaybe I sound paranoid, but I watched Janet Reno last night harping on\nhow much David Koresh was a big, bad child abuser, and I kept wondering \nwhy she -- much less BATF -- wanted us to infer that she had any \njurisdiction over such accusations in the first place.\n\nI'm POSITIVE that the "sealed warrant" is not for child abuse.  What was\nit for?  Peobably weapons violations.  Janet Reno didn't say WORD ONE\nlast night about weapons violations.  Why?  Because she knows that such\na case is no longer believable?\n--
I'm neither a doctor nor a firearms tech expert, but it would seem\nthat given the way a holstered gun points, accidental injuries inflicted\nthat way would be among the least lethal.
The ATF agent interviewed on "Street Stories" reported that the raid was\nill planned, and went ahead even when they (the BD's) knew the ATF was \ncoming. WHY?\n\nI believe this raid was ill planned because they only had 2 days to plan it,\nand it was continued when failure was obvious because it had a bit part\nin the much larger political agenda of President Clinton. I would even \nsuggest that the loss of 4 ATF agents is inconsequential in this the\ncontext of his political agenda. It MIGHT even be beneficial to his agenda, \nas it helps point up just how evil these assualt weapons are. Further proof\nmight be that the ATF denied their agents (Street Stories report) requests\nfor sufficient fire power. \n\nImportant dates: \nFeb 25th - NJ assembly votes to overturn assault weapon ban.\nFeb 28th - Compound in Waco attacked.	   \n\nOn Feb. 25th the New Jersey assembly voted to overturn the assault weapon\nban in that state. It looked like it might be a tight vote, but the Senate\nin N.J. was going to vote to overturn the ban. It would not sit well to have\nan Eastern state overturn an assault weapon ban, given Clintons stated\nagenda on gun control. I suspect Clinton gave the order to get someone or some\ngroup with assualt weapons and have the press present (they were initially\nat the incident in Waco) to record the event for the TV audience. The agent \non "Street Stories" reported that a supervisor was urging them all to "get \nready fast", as "they know we are coming". I believe this attack continued, \neven tho the probablility of failure was high,  because it came from the top \ndown. After the N.J. assembly vote, the ATF had a limited amount of time to\ncome up with something, and the Wackos in Waco fit the bill nicely.
Can you say, "I get more background radiation from living in\nDenver or having an office in a limestone building than I do standing\nnext to a power reactor at full power or standing next to a nuclear\nwarhead that is armed?"  Look up "shielding" in your dictionary.  You\ndon't need six feet of lead to make decent shielding; your dead skin\ncell layer does an excellent job on alpha particles, and neutrons\nare slowed by mere *water*.  What do you think 75% of you is?\n\n\n	If the militia has as its job the overthrow of an illegal\ngovernment, they are indeed useful weapons to the militia.  They\nwon't be too useful in certain areas, but leveling the Pentagon\nwould be a "good thing" for said overthrow and it's likely one man\ncarrying a backpack would stand a better chance than one thousand\narmed with Colt Peacemakers.  Don't let self-defense become the\nonly reason you can have a gun and your sole means of justification.\nMyself, I won't overthrow my government until it ceases to be my\nlegal government, but if I need to I want every weapon I can get.\n\n	One can just as easily say no rifle larger than a .22 is\nneeded to kill a human being.  They are right.  When that human\nbeing is wearing armor and riding in an APC, things get a bit\ndifferent.  I don't see where the weapon is a problem.  It's not.\nOnly the manner of use is in contention here.\n\n\n	I guess you either don't have an alarm clock or have never\nheard the terms "timer" or "martyr" either.  Don't forget remote\ndetonation devices.  That CB radio in the pickup next to you can\neasily transmit ten miles in decent weather.  That's out of the\nblast radius of many portable nuclear devices.\n\n	Just what is it about radioactive decay that has you worried?
Recently while looking around in Traders Sporting Goods store, a very well\nstocked firearms store, I discovered a printed document that was being \ndistributed by the good folks who work there.

Nope.  Here in Northern California, a newspaper recently did a survey,\nasking if people favored stricter gun controls.  A full 40% said no.\nHere, in one of the most Liberal (it wasn't always a swear word :( areas\nof the country, nearly half the people don't want additional controls, let\nalone revocation of RKBA...\n\n\nMisguided dolt though he may be (though, I still maintain, less dangerous\nthan Bush), Clinton does not publicly support revoking the second amendment.\n\n\nWell, I'll help MY neighbors...\n\n\nViolent solutions are passe'?  I take it you propose disarming the police,\nthen?\n\nPlease don't mention RKBA in the same breath as the KKK.  RKBA is about\nbeing able to defend yourself and others, not about killing the innocent.\nActually, your mention of the KKK is rather funny, considering that the\nfirst gun control law in the US were created specifically to disarm black\npeople...

Only as far as it affects the crime rate.\n\nDid the RATE of crime fall?  If not, the ban was of no use.  It is the rate of  \nviolent crime that matters, not the tools used.  "It's the crime, stupid!"\n\n\nApparently that became the weapon of choice after the shotguns were banned.   \nAfter that, they'll decide the car of choice  is the Saab, and propose a ban on  \nthat!\n\n\nYes.

Is the license required for driving a car exclusively on private\nproperty, such as a farm? Here in the United States, the license\nis required only for the use of public roads.\n\n\nWe also have a nation of 250 million people, _many_ issues and\nusually only two candidates for a given office. A President\nmight be willing to abuse mild gun control laws and create\na de-facto ban (something a majority of the people would object to)\nand still be elected: The voters might look at issues like the\ncivil rights of minorities, health care, etc... and vote\nfor the "lesser of two evils." I don't think this is a matter\nof paranoia, since local governments in (for example) New York\nand Chicago have abused existing, mild gun control laws to \ncreate a virtual ban.\n\n\nIn which case, the United States already has adaquate gun control laws:\nAccording to federal statistic, only 7% of gun-wielding criminals\nlegally purchase their own guns from licensed dealers. If that's\nthe point of gun control (to prevent criminals from legally purchasing\nguns) then America doesn't need any additional laws to accomplish\nthis.\n\n\nHow is this any different from guns? There are legal purposes for\nowning and using a gun: They are appropriate tools for hunting,\ntarget shooting and self-defence. Like cars, murder isn't\ntheir only (or even a common) use.\n\n\nI certainly couldn't imagine the American public accepting regulation\nof axes. While the politics of other nations may be different,\nin America there is strong opposition to any intrusive law that\nprimarily would effect the average, law-abiding citizen who had\nnot done anything wrong.\n\n\nA good way to deal with which problem? It is an excelent way to deal \nwith the short-term problem of rioting and violent attacks. Of course,\nit doesn't do anything for the long-term issues that start riots. But\nat this point, what can these individuals do about long-term social\nproblems? \n\n\nThere are, according to surveys, guns in 40% of American homes.\nIn many parts of the country, this is closer to 100%. Those places\nwhere almost everyone owns a gun are, on average, safer than those\nwhere guns are less common.\n\n\nThis is, I think, a fundamental difference between American government\nand that of other nations. Here it is not acceptable to punish\nor restrict the average, law-abiding citizen in the name of some\nvague "common good."
How about "firearm related."\n\n\n       Texas is unusual in this regard.  It would be nice to reduce them\nboth, though.\n\n       As Texas doesn't appear to have an murder rate that much higher than\nthe national average, I would expect it is a result of a much higher\nsuicide rate.\n\n\n       Be nice if you didn't have to suffer at all.\n\n\n       Here's where we run into a problem.  I am perfectly willing to\nhave government regulation on something which is likely to cause others\nharm.  What we're discussing, though, is the extreme regulation of a large\ngroup in order to target a small group, and I don't think that's\nappropriate. \n\n\n        Does this, then, justify anything?  At some point you have to draw\na line (at least to my way of thinking) where the government must have\nsomething a little more substantial than a set of percentages with which\nto punish an individual.\n\n        Where do *you* draw the line?  Or is there one?\n\n\n        Virginia.  It passed.\n\n\n        Does it?\n\n\n        Cute analogy. \n\n        The U.S. doesn't treat drunk driving like a serious crime.  However,\nwe also don't confiscate cars of people who drink.  We also don't confiscate\n*all* cars because some people drink and drive.  It's the core of the legal\nsystem that in order to punish an individual (and I'd call property\nconfiscation a punishment) you must have evidence against that individual.\nThat is, it isn't enough to show that the majority of people convicted of\nmurder are white  in order to convict a particular white guy of murder.\n\n\n        Huh?
The debate over the Second Amendment rages on.\nArguments continue over what a "well-regulated militia"\nis and what TRKBA means in practical terms.

Is there anyone who\nhas the facts of a legal precedent, preferably a Supreme\nCourt decision on the specific meaning of the 2nd Amendment?

These prohibiting laws are examples why the are\nan anachronism.  After all, laws in made by representatives of the \npeople.  These representatives of the people have already decided\nthat the Second Amendment does not apply or is too broad in some\ncases.  Since these representatives feel an unconditional \ninterpretation is not wanted, then it is probable that they majority\nof the people feel the same way.  If this is so, it is an example\nof the people using their power of government.  If this is not\nhow the people feel, the people should stand up and state their wishes.\n \n-> RKBA is dependent on the existence of a top-flight, well-regulated\n-> militia.  Why this is a false assumption has already been posted a \n-> number of times.  \n\nNo, I simple stated that the people have a right to "join a well\norganized militia."  And I have also stated that a militia that\nmeets once or twice a year is clearly "well organized."  And this\nstate of readiness that I have claimed the people have a "right"\nto, is the same state of readiness expected of the militia as stated\nby Hamilton.
There's only one way I know of to tell an AR-15 from an M-16.\n   Pick it up, hold it about a foot from your face and look closely\n   at the saftey lever.  If it has two positions, its an AR-15, if\n   it has three, its an M-16.  There are numerous internal differences\n   as well, but since one would have to field strip the weapon to see\n   them, they are not valid in this discussion.  So, in conclusion,\n   there is very little external differences to distinguish an AR-15\n   from an M-16 except at close (very close) range.\n\n   David Bixler\n   Auburn University

[..]\n\nThis statement simply amazes me!  "Through no fault of ATF, the element of  \nsurprise was lost"!  What element of surprise?  In the paragraph preceding this  \none, he said "... the special agents announced who they were and their purpose  \nfor being at the compound", which was to serve the federal warrant.  No element  \nof surprise was even needed for that.  \n\nNo, the element of surprise that they lost was that needed for a preemptive  \nfirst strike, without warning.  \n\n\nRead: They need to wait until they see how it comes out before they fabricate  \nanymore, which could get disproven.\n\n\nAs always, no facts, just my opinions/observations.\n\nJim\n--\njmd@handheld.com

-> Actually, the words "A well regulated Milita, being necessary to the\n-> security of a free state" is a present participle, used as an\n-> adjective to modify 'militia', which is followed by the main clause of\n-> the sentence, the subject being 'the right', the verb 'shall'.  It\n-> asserts that the right to keep and bear arms is essential for\n-> maintaining a milita. \n-> a free state.\n\nYes, I agree the first half of the amendment does modify the noun \nmilitia.  But the difinition of modify that applies to how "well regulated" \nmodifies "militia" is:\n	to qualify or limit the meaning of.  For example, "wet"\n	modifes "day" in the phrase "a wet day."\n\nThe amendment is similiar to the statement:\n	A wet day, being annoying, the right of the people to keep\n	and wear boots, shall not be infringed.\nSo how does a dry day pertain the right to use boots?  Similiar,\nwhat does the "unorganized militia" have to due with the right to\nown guns?\n\n-> The sentence [in the Second Amendment] doesn't restrict the right, or\n-> state or imply possession of the right by anyone or anything other\n-> than the people.  All it does is make a positive statement regarding a\n-> right of the people. The PEOPLE, as in you and me, as in the First,\n-> Fourth, Ninth, Tenth, as well as the Second amendment.\n-> The existence of this right is assumed - it is not granted by the\n-> amendment. There is no stated or implied condition relating the right\n-> to bear arms to the necessity of a well-regulated militia to the security of\n-> In other words, the entire sentence says that the right to keep and\n-> bear arms is UNCONDITIONAL.\n\nNo not, unconditional, but "shall not be infringed".  Infringed\nis defined as:\n	To break or ignore the terms of or obligations (an oath, \n	an agreement, law, or the like); to disreguard; violate.\n	To go beyond the boundaries or limits; tresspass; encroach.\nThis definition implies the following of some form of existing \nagreement.  Laws and agreements are made in advance.  Boundaries \nor limits of behavior are set by society as a whole.  The word \n"unconditional" implies no agreements or all previous agreements \nare off, which is the opposite.\n\nThe words used in the first amendment are much stronger, i.e.,\n"congress shall make no law," are much stronger.  They clearly \n	         ^^^^^^^^^^^\nimply "unconditional."  If the writers of the amendment, wanted \nunconditional whay didn't they says, "congress shall make no \nlaws pertaining the the right of the people to keep and bear arms"?\nThe second amendment implies a sort contract between the people\nthe people and the state.  The bigger part of the contract is\nthe people have the right to overthrew the government and its laws\nat any time.  To guarantee this right, the laws cannot stopped\nthe people from forming a "well regutaled militia."  The duties\nof a "well regulated militia" to the government are descussed in \nFederalist No. 29.  And the limits of of the governmental control\nof the militia are descussed in Article I Section 8, Article II \nSection 2, and the Second Amendment of the constitution.
good job to whoever posted the article.

Of course, if you're a criminal, or hang around with criminals, or\nflash large wads of cash in the wilder parts of town, or utter verbal\nbigotry in the right public places, your chances of being shot are much\nhigher.\n\nAvoiding these behaviors, on the other hand, decreases your chances of\nbeing shot.\n\nSomething like 60% of all murders are criminals killing criminals. \nOver 90% of murders are committed by people with a prior *known*\nhistory of violence.\n\nSimplistic moral, suitable for my three year old, and most inane\nposters:  "Bad people do bad things - repeatedly."
Dennis Deconcini, 1982\n \n...In these and similar areas, the\nBureau has violated not only the dictates of common sense, but of 5\nU.S.C. Sec 552, which was intended to prevent "secret lawmaking" by\nadministrative bodies.\n   These practices, amply documented in hearings before this Sub-\ncommittee, leave little doubt that the Bureau has disregarded\nrights guaranteed by the constitution and laws of the United\nStates.\n   It has trampled upon the second amendment by chilling exercise\nof the right to keep and bear arms by law-abiding citizens.\n   It has offended the fourth amendment by unreasonably search-\ning and seizing private property.\n   It has ignored the Fifth Amendment by taking private property\nwithout just compensation and by entrapping honest citizens with-\nout regard for their right to due process of law.\n   The rebuttal presented to the Subcommittee by the Bureau was\nutterly unconvincing. Richard Davis, speaking on behalf of the\nTreasury Department, asserted vaguely that the Bureau's priorities\nwere aimed at prosecuting willful violators, particularly felons ille-\ngally in possession, and at confiscating only guns actually likely to\nbe used in crime. He also asserted that the Bureau has recently\nmade great strides toward achieving these priorities. No documen-\ntation was offered for either of these assertions. In hearings before\nBATF's Appropriations Subcommittee, however, expert evidence\nwas submitted establishing that approximately 75 percent of BATF\ngun prosecutions were aimed at ordinary citizens who had neither\ncriminal intent nor knowledge, but were enticed by agents into\nunknowning technical violations.\n \n( Exerpt from: 97th Congress; 2d Session   COMMITTEE PRINT\n     T H E   R I G H T   T O   K E E P   A N D   B E A R   A R M S\n                                REPORT\n                                of the\n                   SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE CONSTITUTION\n                                of the\n                      COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY\n                         UNITED STATES SENATE\n                        NINETY-SEVENTH CONGRESS\n                            SECOND SESSION\n                             FEBRUARY, 1982\n        Printed for the use of the Committee on the Judiciary\n                    U.S. GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE\n88-618 O\n                        WASHINGTON : 1982\n \n \nLetter to Constituent: April 1993\n \n \nThank you for contacting me regarding the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,\nand Firearms (ATF), which is the Federal law enforcement agency with\njurisdiction over firearms violations and regulations.\n \nIt has been my experience as chairman of the Appropriations\nSubcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government which\nfunds ATF, that ATF is one of the most competent and highly\nprofessional law enforcement agencies in the Federal government.\nThe agents of ATF have proven their value again and again in\nsuccessful, legal operations to curb the unlawful possession and use\nof firearms, especially in the area of  drug-related crimes.  It\nenforces the Armed Career Criminal Act which calls for mandatory\nminimum sentences for repeat felons using firearms to carry out  an\nillegal activity.  The Bureau has made itself a key component in\npreventing gang related violence, also, both by educating at-risk\nyouth to the dangers of gang membership as well a s by depriving known\ngangs from access to weapons.\n \nThe Waco, Texas case involved the execution of search warrants by ATF\non the Branch Davidians for illegal firearms and explosives possession\n(automatics, semi-automatics, and machine-guns, in addition to bombs\nand other explosives.)  In virtually every gun case, ATF is asked to\ntrace weapons through its' National Firearms Tracing Center, where\nthey keep all dealer and Federal firearms license information.  ATF\nis the Federal governments' firearms expert and routinely works with\nstate and local police to execute warrants.  ATF, working with state\nand local law enforcement in Texas and the U.S. Attorneys' office\nfelt it was necessary to execute these warrants in order to legally\nestablish that a crime had been committed and conclude a long and\nthorough investigation of illegal gun and explosives held by members\nof the Branch Davidians.  In addition, ATF carefully selected a\nSunday morning, knowing from their source, inside, that the men would\nbe separated from the women and children and not in the area where\nit was known that the illegal weapons were stored.\n \nAs you may be aware by now, Vernon Howell a.k.a. David Koresh\nspiritual leader of the Branch Davidians was tipped of the impending\nexecution of the search warrants.  Unfortunately, ATF lost the\nelement of surprise and the cult was able to arm themselves  and\nprepare for ATFs' entry into the compound.  Once a hostage situation\npresented itself, the ATF asked the FBI to become involved since the\nFBI is skilled in hostage negotiations.  In addition, and military\ntanks were brought in due to the serious nature of the situation and\nfirepower of the Branch Davidians.\n \nBased on what I have learned about ATF's role in the Branch Davidian\nraid, I believe the agency acted responsibly.  I am, however, deeply\nsaddened by the loss of lives of the 4 law enforcement agents who\nattempted to enter the compound and the civilian members of the\ncult.  I fully expect the Department of  Treasury to conduct a\nthorough evaluation with representatives from law enforcement outside\nthe Department to be headed by the Assistant Secretary for\nEnforcement.  In addition, ATF will conduct its' own review of the\nWaco operation.  I look forward to reviewing the findings of the\nevaluators and hope this situation in Waco will be brought to a quick\nand peaceful conclusion.\n \nSincerely,\n \nDennis DeConcini\nChairman\nSubcommittee on Treasury,\nPostal Service and\nGeneral Government\n \nApril 7, 1993

In this\ncase I should point out that semi-automatic firearms are legal in most areas of\nthis Country, including Texas and Colorado.  In addition the members of the\n"cult" have never been convicted of any crimes which would deny them the ability\nto purchase these weapons.  So under what grounds would you deny them these\nguns?

Maybe I consider your\nChurch to be a cult!\n\nThis line of reasoning by you borders on the concept of "thought crimes."  You\nand Pat Robertson should really get along.\n\n2) You were referring to the ALLEGED FULLY automatic weapons possessed by the\n"cult."  Under current US law, FULLY automatic weapons have been covered by\nsome of the strictest gun control laws in this Nation.  So if David Koresh\nillegally possessed them, he would have had to circumvent some of the strictest\nlaws we have.  How will more laws help?

If true, the 85 people who perished\nMonday in the fire, died so that the Federal government could collect a couple\nhundred dollars in taxes on guns David Koresh didn't declare.\n\nI have heard claims that they were "stockpiling weapons."

The documentary interviewed Koresh and current and ex-members.  \nThe documentary disucussed Koresh's "Christ" status inside the cult, \ncult brain-washing techniques, and unusual sex practices (the leader \ngets any he wants, and tells others when they can or can't).  I will let \nothers decide if using religious authority to have sex with a minor is \ntechnically child abuse or not.\n\n\nAll true.\n\n\nWell, if a fire was deliberately set by members of the cult, then the \nhistory and background of the cult is very relevant.  The history \nand backgournd of the Jones cult was very important in understanding \nwhat happened at Jonestown.\n\nNot taking into account the history and background of Koresh's cult may \nalso help explain why the FBI and BATF so badly predicted the reponses \nthey would get from inside the compund nearly every step of the way in \nthis badly handled affair.\n\n\nIt is likely that there will be at least two investigations (JD and congress) \nat this point.\n\n\nInteresting and conflicting details are starting to come out.  I have \nreverted back to wait mode to find out whether the fire was intentional \nor accidental and how it started and why it spread so fast.

Ah yes, I see a few liberal weenies have come out of the woodwork\nto defend the burning of the children. Probably drooled all over themselves\nwhile watching the TV coverage.\n\nProbably had a few like that in Nazi Germany, as well.
As quoted from <1993Apr14.184448.2331@gnv.ifas.ufl.edu> by jrm@gnv.ifas.ufl.edu:\n\n\nYou don't know much about modern automatic weapons, do you?  Just about ANYBODY\nwith basic manufacturing skill can turn out HIGH QUALITY submachineguns.  A \ncouple of high school shop teachers were recently arrested for building \nsubmachineguns in the school shop.\n\nI suggest that you go to the library and find a copy of "Smallarms of the \nWorld".  Your entire premise is based on non-factual assumptions.
[The original question was about who started the fire and whether the \n   "madmen" were inside or outside the compound.  To which I replied on \n   the possible sanity level of those inside and outside.]\n\nI paid my taxes.  There was no reference to sex or religion on the form.\nThe comments above and below were meant to address who might be unstable \nenough to keep children in a building with tear gas or start a fire.\n\n\nI agree that the BATF handled the affair badly.  \n\n\nDo you believe they would put impostors before the national tv cameras?\n\nAt this point, we are getting conflicting reports from the survivors.\nBest wait til more light is shed upon them.  Of course, this is no \ngood if you believe in eternal darkness.
There is no such thing as "completely secure," especially when dealing\nwith High Technology. It's all a question of cost: what cost are you\nwilling to bear to protect your information vs. what rewards the "bad guys"\nare going to get if they break it. The rewards of breaking such a single ID\nsystem would be high indeed.
Well, if police think they are so special that only _THEY_ are worthy\nof self-defense, perhaps we start putting the arm on police; maybe\nwe should start demanding that police are only police when ON-DUTY,\nthat after that they are just like the ordinary disarmed helpless\nchumps they consider "civilians."\n\nLet's prohibit arms carrying by police when off-duty. Or, if they make\nthe assertion that "Well, I need to maintain my gun" let's make it\nregulation that they can carry an UNLOADED firearm home, that it's\nonly fair that they be just as helpless as poor schmuck coming home\nfrom his computer operator job...\n\nNRA Director/ex-San Jose cop Leroy Pyle states in the latest SWAT\nmagazine that anti-cops better watch out for this schism between\nRKBA folks and the police. He asks the rhetorical question of 'What\nif what's left of the gun lobby starts demanding the disarmament\nof the police?"
Unworthy of comment.\n\n\nNor would they have died if they had come out with their hands empty.\nThat is undeniable truth.  My heart bleeds just as much as yours for \nthe children who were never released given 51 days of ample opportunities \nto do so.  My heart also bleeds for people so blinded by religious devotion \nto not have the common sense to leave the compound when tanks came up \nand started dropping in tear gas early in the morning.\n\n\nI do not think this.  However, if they did set the fire (which started in \nmore than one place and spread very quickly), then they got what they \nwanted and put into motion themselves.\n\nI see the BATF is going to be investigated by the Justice Dept. and likely \nby Arlen Spectre and congress.  This is good.  They have bungled the affair \nfrom the start.
Any projectile traveling at or near typical bullet speeds is potentially\nlethal.  Even blanks [which have no projectile] can cause death if the\nmuzzle is in close proximity to the victim.  I have heard of rubber or\nplastic bullets being used effectively during riot situations [where the\nintent is crowd control, rather than close range self defense]; i've also\nseen reports of deaths caused by them [the British in Northern Ireland].\n Use of a firearm for self defense is appropriate and lawful only in the\ngravest of situations; at that point, i consider deadly [lethal] force to \nbe a proper reaction [and so does the law].  \n Furthermore, use of less effective [but still potentially lethal] force\nhas its own set of problems.  It may well take more applications of the\nless effective force to stop the incident; this places all parties at some\nrisk; the victim because the attack has not stopped, and the assailent \nsince the aggregate damage done by the multiple applications may well be\nmore deadly.
Do you have any statistical evidence to back you claim that requires another\nlimitation of the citizenry freedom?\n-- \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteve Podleski			|     phone: 216-433-4000\nNASA Lewis Research Center     	|    \nCleveland, Ohio  44135         	|     email: pspod@hooch.lerc.nasa.gov
Posted by Cathy Smith for L. Neil Smith\n\n                   LETTER TO A LIBERAL COLLEAGUE\n\n[AUTHOR'S NOTE:  "Adrian" -- name changed to protect the guilty -- \nand the author are science fiction novelists who once worked with \nthe same editor at a famous New York publishing house.]\n\nDear Adrian:  \n\nI'm way behind schedule on my current book again, so this reply to \nyour note -- criticizing the recent magazine interview I gave and \ngenerally attacking gun ownership -- will necessarily consist \nmostly of assertions you're free to believe (or not) I can back \nwith evidence and logic I've neither time nor energy to present \nnow.  I've written fully on this topic before and will again in the \nfuture.  When I do, I'll make sure you get copies.  \n\nThere are many arguments I might make, from the futility and danger \nof delegating self-defense to the police (see Don Kates in the Jan. \n10, 1985 WALL STREET JOURNAL) to the real effect of prohibition, \nshifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic \nrifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs, but I'll \nlimit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent \nwith your note.  \n\nFirst, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nSecond, publication of some latter-day "scientific study" doesn't \nalter the fact that the gun prohibitionists I discussed in my \ninterview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying.  \n\nThird, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nFourth, as often happens with these things, the "study" doesn't \nsupport the gun prohibitionists' original numerical contentions \nanyway, but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older \nbody of lies, omissions, and distortions.  \n\nFifth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nSixth, the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on \ncountless occasions (Carl Bakal, author of NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND \nBEAR ARMS, even confessed to it publicly) makes the value of this \npresent "study" dubious, to say the least.  \n\nSeventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is \na natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, \nand Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic \nprocess nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nEighth, given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat \n(not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction), you \nshould be better aware than most people how "progress" -- in \ndesigning "studies" to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our \nability to collect meaningful data.  A case in point we might agree \non is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30 \nyears to create "studies" "proving" that pornography causes crime.  \nMore naive (and probably more honest) efforts in the 50s and 60s \nclearly indicate the contrary.  \n\nNinth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nTenth, another reason to doubt all such "studies" is that human \nbehavior (as the Austrian School of economics demonstrates) is far\ntoo complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified.  The \nattempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the \nresulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization.  \n\nEleventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is \na natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, \nand Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic \nprocess nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nTwelfth, the "study" is also worthless because it incorporates \nfigures for suicide, which is not necessarily a tragedy but \nbasically another individual right, sometimes with ancillary social \nbenefits.  If anything, perhaps suicide INTERVENTION should be a \ncriminal offense.  \n\nThirteenth and finally, the National Rifle Association officials \nquoted in the article, whatever their shortcomings (and they are \nmany), are correct in this instance:  the "study" is meaningless \nbecause the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nAnd because of that, Adrian, even if the "study" were valid, it \nwouldn't deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that \nanyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however, \nwhenever, and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody's \npermission. In this I'm ably assisted by gun prohibitionists \nthemselves, whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed \npeople to go out and buy their first gun "while they still can".  \nBefore the '68 Gun Control Act, most of the "shooting fraternity" \nviewed handguns (incorrectly, as it turned out) as inaccurate, \nineffective toys.  There probably weren't six million of them in \nthe whole country.  Now, thanks to Kennedy, Metzenbaum, the Bradys, \nand their ilk -- AMERICA'S GREATEST SPORTING GOODS SALES TEAM -- we \nprobably manufacture at least that many every year.\n\nThe fascinating datum is that Handgun Control, et al. are perfectly \naware of this -- so I guess you'll have to ask them yourself what \ntheir real motives are.  \n\nLook:  gun-making isn't an arcane or difficult art (and by the way, \nit's easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic; \nthe fact that I can still obtain my own weapon of preference, the \nself-loading pistol, is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing \nthis further).  Even if it were difficult, there are already a \nquarter billion firearms in America, with an estimated "half life" \nof 1000 years -- possibly more for stainless steel.  Guns are gonna \nbe around a long time, Adrian, whether you like it or not.\n\nAs for me, to paraphrase Elmer Keith, regardless of what the law \nprovides or any court decides, I'm always going to be armed.  And I \nwill always work to see that others are, as well.  The bad news is \nthat there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands \n-- where I come from.  We can't be stopped by passing laws, we can \nonly be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and -- given \nboth the practical and alleged differences between full automatics \nand semiautomatics -- perhaps more efficiently.  \n\nSo what's the point?  \n\nL.

That's nice, but it doesn't answer the question.  There is a difference\nbetween "the feds can mandate literacy" and "the feds can't interfere\nwith literacy/book possession".\n\n\nActually, the Miller court did nothing of the kind.  It remanded\nthe case back to the trial court because the miller court didn't\nknow if the weapon in question was a militia weapon.  (Doesn't it\nbother anyone that a major constitutional issue was taken up in\na case where there was no defense?  Miller had been released by\nthe appeals court and disappeared - only the govt was represented.)\n\nWe don't know what would have happened with the reasonable "all guns\nare militia weapons" argument.\n\n-andy
Is Kratz claiming that he can reliably visually distinguish an M-16\nfrom an AR-15?  That he can see the difference between a semi-auto and\na full-auto UZI?  That he can see the difference between the various\nversions (some full-auto, some semi-auto only) of the M-11/9?\n\nIf so, I'd love to hear the details, if only because they'll demonstrate\nthat Kratz is blowing smoke.\n\nConsidering that one can design a gun so that it looks just like\nanother gun, yet have very different properties, and that that's\nquite common....\n\nMost kids in my neighborhood were quite young when they figured out\nthat my parents car wasn't much like Richard Petty's, even though it\nlooked just like it (except for the paint job).  Things must have been\ndifferent with Kratz.\n\n\nNo, it doesn't, but that's irrelevant.  If visual inspection of the\noutside worked, TV would be acceptable, but since it doesn't, the fact\nthat it's just as good as seeing in person doesn't mean much.\n\n-andy gave Kratz a chance to back down on this in private

I watched it live, and have re-watched it several times, and from the press  \nvantage point, there was only one starting point visible, where the tank  \npunched in on the windward side, and the winds whipped that fire across the  \nwhole, dry, wooden, structure in minutes.

But,\nagain, statistics between too dissimilar cultures are difficult to\nquantify.\n\nI don't know how anyone can state that gun control could have NO\neffect on homicide rates.  There were over 250 >accidental< handgun\nhomicides in America in 1990, most with licensed weapons.  More\nAmerican children accidentally shot other children last year (15)\nthan all the handgun homicides in Great Britain.  (Source: National\nSafety Council.  Please... no dictionary arguments about RATES vs\nTOTAL NUMBERS, okay?  They're offered for emphasis, not comparison).\n\nIf Mr. Greenwood believes that Brits are much too sober and\ncoordinated to make such mistakes I'd like to introduce him to my\nfriend, Amanda from Brighton.

The San Jose Mercury News described him as "a 61-year old retired\nchemical engineer".
That's an interesting statement.  There's quite a difference between\nHollywood's "Old West" and the real one.  Yes, there were drunks,\nsaloons, mining camps, and thugs.  However, as McGrath showed, the\nthugs preyed almost exclusively on one another.  McGrath claims that\nthis was due to the fact that no one much cared if someone who\ninsisted on getting into a fight got his way, even if he lost, while\nthey really did care when thugs preyed on others.\n\n\nWe haven't figured out that those distinctions don't actually work.\nMachine guns have been strictly regulated since 1934.  Said regulation\nis both perfect (legally owned machine guns aren't ever used\ncriminally) and a complete waste of time (the criminal use of machine\nguns hasn't change at all).  The result - we're now arguing about\nguns that LOOK like machine guns, but are no different than other\nguns.\n\n-andy
I don't think anyone is arguing that there would be no effect. But\nthere would be no _net_ _positive_ effect. You also have to \nconsider the negative side: Law abiding citizens, armed with \nfireamrs (pistols for the most part), prevent between 80,000\n(National Crime Survey) and 1,000,000 (Dr. Kleck) crimes\neach year. (Those are the extremes. Most studies find\nthe number to be 500,000 to 600,000.) About 1% of those crimes are\nhomicides, so private ownership of firearms _saves_ approximately\n5,000 lives each year. There are roughly 12,000 criminal homicides\nand fatal accidents involving guns each year. For there to \nbe any net benefit, you would have to show that gun control measures\nwould disarm over 40% of the criminals currently using guns.\nThat would be very hard to do: According the the federal BATF,\nonly 8% of criminals buy their guns over the counter. Since\ngun control laws, by their very nature, only effect legal\nsales, such a law would remove all the benefits of armed,\nlaw-abiding citizens while having only a minimal effect on\narmed criminals (who, by and large, get their guns illegally.) \nThat doesn't sound like a net benefit to me.\n  \n\nSince most were with licensed weapons, I assume you are not\nsupporting "reasonable" laws (i.e. waiting periods, background\nchecks, licenses, etc...). Since only a complete ban would \nalter the statistic you refer to, I assume that's what you\nare supporting.\n\nBy the way, 1135 people dies in 1986 from falling down stairs.\n250 accidental handgun deaths isn't significant next to \nother household accidents.\n\n\n1080 children under the age of 10 died by drowning, 69 from \ndrinking poisonous household chemicals (like Drano), 139 from\nfalls. If the real goal is to reduce the tragic, accidental\ndeaths of children, wouldn't a ban on drain cleaners be a \nbetter palce to start? (Or, perhaps, restricting ownership to\nprofessionals like plumbers?)\n\n\nWhile you might call it "emphasis", refering to completely two\nstatistics in the same sentence _implies_ a comparison. If it\nisn't valid, and you put the numbers together to convince people\nyou are right, the kindest thing I could call it is propaganda.

There is a (likely) veto proof majority in the house.  The Senate,\nunfortunately, is a different story.  The Lt.Gov. has vowed that the bill will\nnot be voted on, and he has the power to do it.  In addition, the Senate is a\nmuch smaller, and more readily manipulated body.\n\nOn ther other hand, the semi-automatic ban will likely not live, as at least\nfifty per cent of the house currently opposes it, and it is VERY far down in\nthe bill order in the Senate (I believe it will be addressed after the CCW\nbill).\n\nAnd I thought my TX Political Science class was a waste of time!
Every city and suburban police officer I've seen around the Twin Cities in the\nlast two years has carried a semi-auto of some type (different brands though\nI haven't seen any Glock's). \n\nWith regard to this discussion:  We are getting dangerously far from the usual\nrantings of t.p.g, and close to the realm of r.g, but I'd like to put my two\ncents worth in.  While there's nothing wrong with a revolver (especially a \nlarge frame S&W in .357 magnum - my favorite) there are valid advantages to\nsemi-autos.  I suggest reading Massad Ayoob's (I know, some people can't stand\nhim and think he's full of bull, but I think that in general his material is\nvery valid and useful) book _The Semi Auto Pistol in Police Work_ (or something \nlike that).  He defines a number of ways that semi-auto's are different, and that\n"different is good".  The main advantage is not in increased firepower, but in \nmore accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode.  There is also a\ncertain "propriatory nature" of each gun that takes some familiarity to \nlearn.  This may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiar\nwith different models of semi-autos, but it was cited as stopping or at least\nslowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun.\n\n\nYes, but this is best done with a two hand hold.  With a single hand you either\npull the gun far off target to cock, or must fire double action.  The DA semi\nauto has the same advantages plus is always SA after the first shot.\n\n\n\nI'm not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point.  In a DA\nsemi-auto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the same\nround - an advantage you don't have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will\nalways go to the next round (discussing this point now).  This is fine with a dud\nbut what about a hangfire situation?  Granted it's very rare, but your round will\nnow go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go.  Slingshotting the slide\non a misfire takes very little time.\n\n\n\nActually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is not\nnecessary or usually recommended.  A revolver would have to fall hard enough and\nat the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into the\nround to set it off.\n\n\nThe best speedloader users, especially those using the spring loaded speed\nloaders are very fast.  A problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a two\nhanded job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed.  This means that\nwhile you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears the\ngun, with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will always \ntake more time.  You also don't have the advantage of tactical reloads (replacing\na partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity - the partial magazine can\nstill be used if needed later).  \n\n\nYes, the time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clear\nit.  Really though, in either a revolver or semi-auto the odds of an actual misfire\nwith factory ammo are awfully small.  You are more likely to get a jam in a semi-auto\nbut even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns (Sigs, Glocks, et.al.).\n\n\n\n\nAll common semi-auto's can be carried with a round in their chamber without any\nsafety problems.  While I put that out as a statement that I believe, I should\nsay that this applies to all of the ones I've looked at.  For the DA semi's it's\nno different from the revolver situation:  The guns all have hammer or firing\npin blocks.  They also have a safety.  Because there's no real advantage\ncarrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speed\nof employment as a revolver, plus the advantage of SA followup shots.  I'm\nnot familiar with SA semi-autos except for the 1911-A1.  I admit that I was\ninitially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked, but after examining\nthe design, trying to defeat the safeties (gun unloaded of course), and \nshooting it a lot, I see no inherent safety problems with it, especially in\na thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer.  This design also gets\nyou more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver.\n\n\nYeah, the infamous Glock.  I still can't figure out how it's worse than a revolver\nfor safety.  If you don't pull the trigger it doesn't go off.  I imagine that if all\nyour revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the Glock trigger\nfar enough to fire before you realized it.  In addition, if you had developed that\nnasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun and\nrelying on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blew\noff your foot then you'd have problems when the hammer wasn't there.\n\n\nI think this is even okay for a riot (as long as it's a small one B^)).\n\n\nI have the poor man's Beretta (Taurus 99) and consider it inferior as a carry\nweapon to the Springfield .45 (oops, 9mm vs. 45 arguments are relegated to\nr.g).  You are right, though.  If you don't hit what you aim at then the\nshooter/gun combination has failed.  I don't ascribe failures in the the\nfire real fast with a wonder-nine scenario you mention to the gun.  This is\na shooter failure, whether through lack of discipline or lack of training.\n\n\n\n9mm's are becoming more popular with crooks too, though the .38 does still\nlead the list.  And like I said, around here semi-auto's seem the rule for the\nstreet cop.  Don't know about the State Patrol however, they may still carry\nthe "Highway Patrolman".\n\n\nVincent, please don't take any of this as a flame.  Just my $0.02 (whoops, looks more\nlike $2.00) worth.  And much of it is IMHO, but do check Ayoob's book.
Money orders operate pretty much like checks, with both parties being\nsupposed to sign them.  I assume you'd have to show the buy-back people\nan ID, and you'd then have a money order made out to that ID.  \n\n       As far as traceable as a practical matter, I don't know, it would\ndepend on whether they bother to computerize who the recipient's name is\non the money order and bother keying that sort of thing in.  I'd say\ncertainly the police and the buyback people would keep a record of who\nthey gave money orders out to.\n\n\n       There might be some questions asked, I suppose, if somebody \nbrought in a number of weapons each time over a series of "buy back"\nprograms.
Well, I dropped by the library yesterday, and picked up back copies\nof the National Crime Survey (1986-1990) in an effort to examine what\nit said about self-defense with a firearm.\n\n      I haven't ground through much in the way of numbers yet, but a couple\nof things jumped out at me.  First only 1986 and 1987 specify the type of\nweapon used in self defense.  1988, 1989, and 1990 refer only to "weapon."\nThe second is that while assaults rose about 3% from 1986 to 1987, w/gun\ndefenses reported *fell* by almost 25%.  Unless there's an explanation for\nthis, I'm tempted to mark it as a reporting problem, and as such going \nahead with any examination of the numbers would be a waste of time.\n\n      Anybody have an idea what might have cause a real difference, and\nnot just a reporting difference?  The survey doesn't appear to have\nchanged significantly between 1986 and 1987.
Our new Attorney General seems determined to do so. In the past\n\n	She hopes the King beating will not reduce public confidince\n	in law enforcement.\n\n	The tactics of using tear gas and driving tanks through\n	walls in Waco were intended to further a "peacefull solution"\n	to the crisis.\n\n	Those same tactics were intended to prevent a mass suicide,\n	but she never expected the sect to react by killing themselves.\n\nIt's comforting to know, at least, that she wasn't Clinton's first\nchoice...
Are you saying that the Indians who became Christians did so because the\nUS Army marched them into church at gunpoint?\n\nThis will be news to the Indians of the Great Lakes and upper Mississippi\nbasin-- of the Southwest-- of Mexico and South America-- who converted even\nbefore there was such a thing as the US.  Are you saying that Indians are\nincapable of coming to a decision themselves about their religion without\nbeing forced to at gunpoint?  What about the Christian Cherokees who were\ngiven the boot by the US government after the Civil War... because the\nCherokee nation gave mild support to the Confederacy, since they themselves\nowned black slaves.  No, reducing it all to a matter of religion is to\nsupport a much too narrow view of history.

<In article <C5Bu9M.2K7@ulowell.ulowell.edu>\n<\n<> [ ... excellent exchange deleted ... ]\n<> It seems to me the whole reason for the Second Amendment, to give\n<> the people protection from the US government by guaranteeing that the\n<> people can over through the government if necessary, is a little bit\n<> of an anachronism is this day and age.  Maybe its time to re-think\n<> how this should be done and amend the constitution appropriately.\n<\n<    Abraham Lincoln, First Inaugural Address, March 4, 1861: "This\n<    country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit\n<    it.  Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government,\n<    they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it, or\n<    their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it."\n<\n<    Rep. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, spoken during floor debate\n<    over the Second Amendment, I Annals of Congress at 750, 17 August\n<    1789: "What, Sir, is the use of a militia?  It is to prevent the\n<    establishment of a standing army, the bane of liberty. ...\n<    Whenever Governments mean to invade the rights and liberties of\n<    the people, they always attempt to destroy the militia, in order\n<    to raise an army upon their ruins."\n<\n<So now we know which category Mr. Rutledge is in; He means to destroy\n<our Liberties and Rights.\n\nWhat I find so hard to understand is how come some people, apparantly\nNOT connected with government or otherwise privileged, will\ngo to great lengths, redefinitions, re-interpretations, in a full-bore\nattempt to THROW AWAY THE PROTECTION OF THEIR OWN RIGHTS under the\nConstitution!!!\n\nAlmost makes me think of lemmings running into the sea during a lemming\nyear...\n\nI really wonder that Jefferson and Madison would say to these folks?\n\n<-------------------------------------------------------------\n<"...when all government... in little as in great things, shall be\n<drawn to Washington as the centre of all power, it will render\n<powerless the checks provided of one government on another and will\n<become as venal and oppressive as the government from which we\n<separated."   Thomas Jefferson, 1821\n\nExcellent quote.
[stuff deleted]\n\nme:\nDavid:\n\nThis is a very, very good point.  Who cares what kind of gun you've got if\nyou're lying on the ground dead.\n\n[more stuff deleted.  mostly mine]\nAnother very good point that is well taken.  It seems that when lots of lead\nis flying (either the cops or the gangs) someone innocent always gets caught\nin the crossfire.\n\nAll points made above are well taken.  I guess I am in the mindset of\n"having more makes it better" which is obviously not the correct mindset\nto take in this discussion.  Now that I think about the situation a\nlittle more carefully I see your point exactly David and I\nwholeheartedly (sp?) agree.  Like I said I'm just assuming that "more\nbullets and/or bigger bullets is better".  Once again though I want to\nstate that I am a pro-gun individual and do NOT believe that gun control\nis really a viable option here in the United States regardless of the drivel\nthat I spout here :-)
Why?  Either the numerator or the denominator could fluctuate.\n	The dollar value of a gun would (of course)\n	go up if supply were restricted.  The weight of a gun might\n	go down significantly as technology improved.   I don't\n	think you have a basis to assert this.
And, I might add, vitamin C has been endorsed by a Nobel Laureate as a\npanacea for almost everything from the common cold to cancer.  \n\n\nWait a minute. S&K did NOT compare trends.  If they did, they would\nhave seen that the advent of Canada's gun law had no effect on\nhomicides, total or handgun.  Without a pre- vs. post comparison, one\ncannot speculate as to the utility of anything.  All they have is a\ncorrelation, and correlation DOES NOT prove causality.\n\n\n\nHold it again. You dismiss a point about demographics, then you ask\nabout socio-economic demographics? Very slick.\n\nOnce again, correlation does not prove causality.  Looking at pre-vs.\npost data, the Canadian gun law had no effect.\n\n\nSir, if you were a Canadian, and owned a gun before the restrictive\ngun laws were passed, and decided to hide it rather than turn it in,\nwould you answer truthfully a question about gun ownership from\nsomeone who calls, writes, or asks you on the street?  That is one\nproblem with surveys.  Nobody will answer an incriminating question.\nAnother is that people will often tell you what they THINK you want to\nhere.\n\n\nDoes that mean no Vancouver citizens have handguns? I think not. You\nare discounting guns purchased beforehand, and guns purchased for\npurposes other than self-defense, which can also be used for defense.\n\n\nHe makes valid points about demographic differences.  You then resort\nto the kind of argument that the "Politically Correct" movement often\nuses to stifle any debate.  Nice, real nice.\n\n\n\nOne doesn't have to produce his own data in order to point out the\nflaws in the methodology and conclusions of another's study. Again,\nyou resort to PC tactics.
fcrary@ucsu.Colorado.EDU (Frank Crary @ University of Colorado, Boulder):\n\n \n These stats are invalid; we're talking BACKCOUNTRY. These stats for\n rapes/assaults/deaths do not represent the backcountry singularly; the\n great majority represent urban incidents. You should have pointed this out.
I do not think it is at all unlikely that Clinton ro his policy\nwonk facilitators arranged the Waco raid as a display piece for  the\nGun War on the Constitution.  Look at what the Bush administration did to\nget material for the Drug War on the Constitution--remember that baggie of\ncrack George waved at the cameras?  They took a dealer from the ghetto\nand brought him to the White House so they could say drugs had been\ndealt onb the White House Lawn.\nAnd I don't think anybody could honestly think Clinton would have any\nmoral qualms about the raid...\nThe only really worrisome thing is that the BD's heroic defense of\ntheir ranch will make Clinton's Gun War on the Constitution _more_\nsuccessfull--exactly as he wanted.  The media and politicians will\nfilter this so that the general public will think the BD's\nare bad guys!  Don't help them.  Stand up for the BD's with your\nfriends and family adnd in public anytime you can--their supposed\nmoral qualms are not important to the issue.  They are heroes in the\nfight against oppressive government;  it could just as well have been\nyou.\n-watkins@earth.eecs.uic.edu  (Brian E Watkins)
Excuse me but I do know what I safety is supposed to do.  It's basic purpose -\nnot to let the gun fire until you're ready.  Christ, I've known that since I\nhad my first Crosman air gun.  You don't know me so don't make assumptions\nabout what I know and don't know.  I do know that the Glock has multiple\nsafties from reports, looking at them at a gun shop, and friends who own one.\n\nFrom the things I have read/heard Glocks are always knocked because of the\ntrigger safety.  They are supposedly harder to learn to use properly.  Every\narticle that I have read can't be wrong about the damn thing.  And don't ask\nme to quote my sources because I don't keep a ton of gun magazines and/or\nrec.guns articles laying around.  Boy, you can't make a simple statement on\nhere without someone getting right on your ass.  No wonder why there are so\nmany problems in the world.  Everyone takes everything just a little too\nseriously.  By the way,  I'm not going to reply to any of this stuff anymore as\nsomeone made the good point that this discussion is getting too close to r.g\n(And yes I know that I had something to do with that).
Mr. Parsli, I have to take exception at this.  There are\nverifiable, previous *examples* of levels of U.S. governments\nabusing gun-control restrictions.  I don't think it is paranoid\nto worry that what has been abused in the recent past might be abused\nin thye future.  After so many times of getting burned any sane person\nwill stop putting his hand on the stove.\n\n\n       I'd love to.  But as long as the politicians grab power to sell\npork back to their constituents, there's not a lot I can do.  \n\n       It's silly to suggest that if there's anything we can't trust\nthe government to do, and therefore the government should be allowed\nto do it, then we should change governments.  Down that road lies\ntotal government power.   I've never been a fan of totalitarianism.\n\n\n       This is very likely.\n\n\n       The North American Continent is not Europe, no matter how many\npeople would like it to be.  Drugs are very illegal and they're\nhere.  For years Canada has crowed about its gun control.  If it is\nnecessary to control guns over the whole continent, then Canada should\nhave always had comparable rates to the U.S., yet they still don't.\nUnless you can tell me why the Canadian border is so much more\nmagical than the Mexican border (which is shorter and far more\nheavily patrolled) then I really can't accept that argument.\n\n\n       No, there are approximately 31,000 deaths due to guns in the U.S.,\ntwo-thirds of which are suicides.  (Unfortunately I don't have suicide\nrates for Norway.)  However, this makes the per-gun death rate about\nhalf the per-car death rate.\n\n\n      The problem's been humans since before we had stone axes.  The\nfct of the matter is simply this:  If nobody ever assaulted anybody,\nwhether there is a weapon of any sort around would be totally\nirrelevent.\n\n      Yet weapons are *built*.  I'd suggest, then, that the murderous\nimpulse in humanity pre-dates weapons.\n\n      Anyway, the Bosnians et al. have been making an excellent attempt\nto kill each other for half a thousand years.  Taking away their guns, even\nif we could, would neither halt the killing nor reduce the brutality.\n\n\n\n       In the U.S., approximately 60% of murders are commited with firearms.\n(50% with handguns, 10% with non-handguns.)  The reason I say that guns, per \nse, are not the problem, is that our non-gun rate exceeds most of Europe's\ncountries *entire* violent crime rate.  I don't really think we've got\nmore knives or fists.  \n\n       In any case, I think examples of gun control *applied* to the U.S.\nhave been abkect failures, just like drug prohibition and other forms\nof prohibition.  Until you deal with *why* people are doing what they\nare doing, you won't solve your problem.  And if the problem is \nviolent crime, you shouldn't concentrate on the tools instead.  The\n*vast* majority of guns is never, ever misused.  (On the order of\n99.5% over the entire lifetime of the gun).  This says to me that\nyou can't make the argument that the gun itself causes the misuse.\n\n\n       The situation is not "good" in that people fear for their lives.\nBut recall the scenes of the store-owners during the last riots,\nprotecting their shops with guns.  Would it have been better they,\ntoo, lost their livelihoods?\n\n\n       The problem of poverty and rage in Los Angeles, no it isn't.\nHowever, if that problem becomes a violent action, then yes, it can\nbe appropriate.  Whether or not some person has been hurt by their condition\nwon't make me less dead if they burn down my house with me in it.\n\n       You have to examine which problem you're referring to.  If\nyou're discussing someone violently assaulting you, then it is\na perfectly legitimate response to make them stop.  (Hopefully\nsimply letting them know you're prepared to shoot them would be enough,\nas it was with the above-mentioned store-owners.)\n\n\n       45% of Households have some form of firearm, usually a long gun.\nThat accounts for a level of access for at least 100 million Americans.\nFirearm ownership is most likely among educated, well-off whites, the\ngroup *least* likely to be involved in violent crime.\n\n       You may take that for what it's worth.
What about guns with non-lethal bullets, like rubber or plastic bullets. Would\nthose work very well in stopping an attack?
The Cold War has not ended.  The only thing that has happened is that \nthe two sides have exchanged roles.\n\nThe USA has a higher imprisonment rate (400 per 100,000 population)\nthan any country in Europe by a factor of 10 or so.  In California,\nit is over 600 per 100,000 population.  The prison population in\nCalifornia is now over 100,000, a quadrupling since 1980.  Most of\nthese inmates were convicted under the drug prohibition laws.  Police\nnow confiscate property, without trial, under a "good faith probable\ncause" standard, in the name of depriving the horrible ghastly drug\ndealers of their ill-gotten gains.  Conduct an opinion poll, and a\nmajority will answer "yes" if you ask them whether civil liberties and\ndue process should be diluted in order to Send Our Young People The\nMessage That We Are Serious About Winning The War On Drugs.  I don't\nknow whether anyone has measured such a figure among gun owners, but\nI would expect the same result.  They certainly seem to vote that way.\n\nAccording to Jack Herer's book _The Emperor Wears No Clothes_, over\nTWELVE MILLION YEARS of prison time have been served under the\nmarijuana prohibition laws, by people who were minding their own\nbusiness and causing no harm to others (and less harm to themselves\nthan users of tobacco, with 400,000 confirmed kills/year).  Under\nthe "War on Drugs" campaign of "zero tolerance" due process protections\nhave eroded, and mandatory sentences of ten years without parole have\nproliferated.  By and large, gun owners have voted for the politicians\nwho favor such measures.  And now, all the precedents--not only\nlegal, but political:  "My fellow Americans, we must send our young\npeople the message that we are serious about winning the War On\nMurder"--are going to be applied to the oncoming wave of gun\nprohibition laws.  Gun owners are about to get a taste of the medicine\nthey voted for believing it would be used only on those with different\ntastes in recreational drugs.\n\nWhat goes around comes around.
God forgive me for being an American who pays taxes to a government\nthat commits atrocities like the Waco Massacre of 1993.\n-- \nDave Feustel N9MYI <feustel@netcom.com>

Why thanks for your reply to my post.  By the way, I never, never ever said \nthat it was right to shoot "THOSE kind" of babies.  However it was the Branch\nDavidian people in there that insisted on staying there with their "savior" \n(yeah right budy boy) because he had brain-washed them into believing that \nwhat ever he says is the truth, even if means that they are to give up their\nlives for <<<<HIS>>>> cause.  Therefore it is Davids fault and not the ATF's\nwho gave them 50 to 51 days to get out, this was 50 days to many for me and\nfor many of the rest of the U.S.  I am however sad to hear of the death of any \nchild unlike the sick bastard I supposedly am.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n\n       The "used to kill" is the heart of the misinformation.  It's one\nof those technically accurate phrasings that conveys the wrong impression.\nWhat Mr. Quiqley is more than aware of, I'm sure, is that when people\nread this they think violent arguments where one member of the family\ngrabs a gun and shoots another, thereby creating a tragic situation\nwhich could easily have been avoided had the gun not been there, or\na tragic accident, especially involving a child.\n\n       Unfortunately, that's not the way things stack up.  The majority\nof that 43 "times" (37 I believe) are suicides.  That is, someone \nintentionally took a firearm and shot themselves intending to kill \nthemselves.  And why it's popular to try and blame suicides on guns,\nthe evidence doesn't support this.  Internal studies, as well as\ncomparative studies with other countries, indicate that cultural\nfactors far outweigh whether a person will kill themselves or not.\n(Japan, for instance, has a slightly higher rate than the U.S.  There\npeople jump off buildings.)\n\n       According to the National Crime Survey, 40% of violent crime\nis commited by "non-strangers," which mistakenly has been generalized\nregarding the King County study to mean, "Friends and family."  That\nis, Mr. Quigley, and others who quote this statistic, are banking on\nthe mental image that a "Friend, family member, or child," equates\nto a loving relationship, and that it was cut short in a moment of\nanger.  Unfortunately, all too often husbands beat and kill wives,\nchildren assault parents, or vice-versa.  Most rapes are commited by \nsomeone known to the victim, for instance.  Essentially, that a gun\nwas used against a "friend" or family member doesn't mean they\nweren't trying to hurt the other person.  Crime is highest among\npoor urban families, and those are also the areas most "at risk"\nfor family problems, especially violent ones.  A son in a gang may\nnot be as loving toward his parents if they disapprove than a suburban\nkid might.\n\n       Finally, it hinges on the fallacy that a dead intruder is the\nonly value of a self-defense firearm.  Using the minimum figures I\nworked out using the NCS I got about an 80:1 ratio between deadly\nself-defenses (justifiable homicides) and with-gun self-defenses.\nBetween the FBI Uniform Crime report and the NCS there's an enormous\namount of data and anybody with the calculator can crunch the numbers.\nAs such it is incorrect to assume that a dead body is the only valid\nmeans of determining the success of such a defense, since according\nto the NCS (which has been considered by many to seriously under-report\ndefenses) there were far more successful with-gun defenses than intruders\nkilled.\n\n       Not it also confines itself to the home, where attack by a "friend\nor family member" is far, far more likely, and excludes any defense\nwhich occurs outside the home.  (I believe a large number occur in\nbusinesses.)\n\n\n       I have not seen the exact data for this, so I can't comment.  I\nwill point out Canada's and Japan's suicide rate as indications that\nculture far more than firearm availability affect suicide rates.\n\n       There was also a comparative study between Canada (for what\nit's worth, considering the difficulty of comparing across cultural\nlines) published in the New England Journal of Medicine (I can get the\nexact cite if you need it) that concluded that restrictive firearm laws \nwould not significantly impact the over-all suicide rate.
Chemical weapons are not concidered a *very* effectiv weapon against\nmillitary forces. On civillians on the other hand....\n\nThat's one GOOD reason for banning it.\n\nYou need VAST amounts of chemicals to be affective, so the best reason\nto have/use it is price. (that's why it's called The Poor Mans A-bomb)\n\nAny thoughts on Bio-weapons ??	\n\nIf this discusion is about civillians having chem-weapons;\nWhat should they use them on?? Rob a bank ??\n\n\n\n	This is not a .signature.\n	It's merely a computergenerated text to waste bandwith\n	and to bring down the evil Internet.

I have already called senators, legislators and the Governor demanding\nthat the warrants be unsealed, and that all involved in this atrocity\n(including the President, Attorney General and Governor) be suspended\npending an investigation.\n\nI seriously doubt, however, that anything will ever be done.\n\n\nWelcome to Amerika!
500,000 to 1,000,000 self-defense incidents a YEAR doesn't count with you?\n\n\nMaybe they're just UNLUCKY.  If a rapist pulls a woman into an alley\nin Boston, chances are almost certain that she won't be counted \nas one of those self-defenders because our local constabulary didn't\nconsider it important that she be allowed to arm herself.  Even though\nthe shotgun she owns at home makes her show up in the "gun owner" column.\n\n\nIronic words for somebody who lives in Florida.  The "average threat\nlevel" in Florida has been REDUCED by a liberal CCW policy.  It's well\nknown that your local thugs like to target tourists precisely because \nthey are less likely to be carrying than your natives.  Come on up to\nBoston, or NYC, or Washington DC, and see how much diddlysquat the \n"average threat level in the country" means to a resident there.\n\n\nSometimes this works.  Sometimes it just lands your good neighbors \non the dance card for the next wave of drive-bys.  Someone here once\ntold a story about LA gangs moving into Phoenix.  I've misplaced the\noriginal text, but the story started with one resident calling the \ncops on a gang member.  Sure enough, a few nights later, there was a \ndrive-by performed at the resident's house.  Except that this time,\nunlike in LA, the entire street came out and returned fire, putting\nan end to the car's occupants.  The gang packed up and left.\n\nOf course, in LA, or in a place like Florida after the hurricane,\nyour first problem is to FIND an officer to step up to and tell\nanything.\n\n\nLook, nobody is arguing this.  I have a fire extinguisher at home.  \nThat doesn't mean I can be careless about tossing my burnt matches \non the carpet.  I live carefully, monitor the woodstove, get my flue\ncleaned twice a year, and test my smoke alarms annually.  But if --\nDESPITE all this -- a fire does start, it's too late for any of\nthese things EXCEPT the extinguisher.\n\n\nYou seem to be agreeing with your opponent.  You can't trust your\ngovernment to protect you from abusers and violators -- white-collar,\nblue-collar, epauletted, or tank-shirted.  Ultimately, no one has the\npower to enforce your "rights" but you.  Unless you've given up that \npower.\n\n\nToo many people fit that category, that is true.  Some of us like to\nbelieve that they are uninterested in the facts behind the case for gun \nownership because they've been conditioned to believe that there AREN'T \nany.  You seem content to underestimate the electorate; I'm willing to\ntry to raise their consciousness.\n\n\nI think we can.\n\nHCI was founded in what, 1980?  In the mid-80's, they ran a "One \nMillion Strong!" campaign for two years before reaching this goal.  \nMy understanding is that they "reached" it by the stratagem of including\nwide classes of people other than dues-paying members.  (I can't speak\nauthoritatively on this -- maybe somebody else has details.)  Then they\nstarted running a "Two Million Strong!" campaign for a while -- but they\nlet it slip into unannounced obscurity when it became clear that they\nsimply were never going to reach that level of membership.\n\nIn 1964, just after the commencement of the Dodd Hearings -- the starting\npoint of the modern gun-control movement, the NRA had a mere 625,000 members.  \nBy 1968, barely after the first murmurs of future registration, it had \nabout a million.  Today, it has over three million members, making it the\nthird largest membership organization in the country (next to AARP and AAA).\nAnd its membership is GROWING FASTER than at any previous time.  (Historical\nfigures from Kukla's "Gun Control," pp. 61 and 420.)\n\nAs you say, many of the people in the middle of this debate are bemused\nby their T-bones and MTV.  That leaves hard-core gun-owners against \nhard-core gun banners.\n\nI know a number of ex-HCI members who have recently become NRA members.\nI've never heard of a single one who has gone the other way.\n\nYes, I think we can and will win this one.\n\n\nI think they would be used far less to hammer nails, as well, but,\nlike you, I can't give any citation showing that this utilization is\nCURRENTLY significant at more than an anecdotal level.  If you can, \nI'm waiting.\n--
Tennessee, at least, does not require any sort of safety class to\nget a driver's license.  All that is required is one twenty question\nquiz and to drive a car around the block without crashing.\n\n\n      In all probability, no you don't.  You are required to be licensed\nto drive on public roads.  A license is not necessary on private property.\n\n\n       Most states do not require the registration of cars that are\nnot used on public roads.  Those that do (California I know of) do\nso for tax purposes more than anything else.\n    \n\n       Many states do not currently require this, and most, again,\nonly make this requirement for public roads.  A car sitting unused \nis not required to have insurance.\n\n\n       The two are not the same, as I pointed out above.  There are\nsignificant difference between making rules for *use on public property*\nand *making rules for ownership*.\n\n       The other half of the objection is trust.  Similar things to this\nhave been tried in many local jurisdications across the country, and\nhave been abused in far too many cases.   Safety classes which are\nnever sheduled, never funded, or only one or two is held a year for\na limited number of participants.  Registration lists in New York,\nChicago, and California have been used for confiscation.  *Many* gun\nowners would, in theory, support these planes.  (Although the\nnumbers overwhelmingly show that competence is not the problem, that\nintentional misuse is).  They've simply seen it abused and are leery of\nthe next person who comes down the pike with a "reasonable" suggestion\nthey've already seen abused.
According to WNCI 97.9 FM radio this morning, Dayton, Ohio is operating a\ngun "buy back".  They are giving $50 for every functional gun turned in.\nThey ran out of money in one day, and are now passing out $50 vouchers of\nsome sort.  They are looking for more funds to keep operating.  Another\nmedia-event brought to you by HCI.\n\nIs there something similar pro-gun people can do ?  For example, pay $100\nto anyone who lawfully protects their life with a firearm ?  Sounds a bit\ntacky, but hey, whatever works.
Here's a question:  If most marijuana is domestic and\nproducing it here is economical, why would we expect it to be\nimported?\n\n\n       Yet it was done.  Done quite successfully for a number of years.\n*Somebody* thought it was worth the risk.\n\n\n       Your assumption is that this "low" dollar/pound area is\nsufficiently low as to make gun-running unprofitable.  On what\ndo you base this?  \n\n       And given that smuggling channels are already established,\nand given the economies of scale, would it really add significantly\nmore expense to start smuggling firearms, especially considering\ndoing so would be less hazardous (in terms of getting caught) than\ndrugs?\n\n\n       Now *that* was a jump.  In any case, define "local."  It's\na big country.\n \n\n       Wow, you gotta love the speculation.\n\n       As I posted before, we import billions upon billions of raw\nores across the Mexican border.  Not only that but ships come in and\nout of U.S. harbors every day full stuff.  And customs doesn't even\nhave the extra advantage of being able to sniff them out.  \n\n       I'd be willing to wager that a shipload of handguns would be\nworth more than a shipload of raw ore, *and* you're virtually guaranteed\nto get it past customs, because they'd have to hand search every hold of\nevery ship which came through.\n\n       It's not simply a matter of how much money are they worth, but how\nmuch *more* money are they worth than other goods, based on the likelihood\nof being caught.  Less money than drugs, but also a safer thing to smuggle.
Yup, you said it.  I admire such honesty. ;-)\n\n\nFire an Anschutz .22, then come back and talk to us.  You're letting\nignorance and possibly fear cloud your thinking.  Either that, or this\nis sour grapes because we beat you in the Olympic shooting events.\nFunny, you'd think biathalon would be a natural sport for the norse. ;-)\n\n\nPrecisely.  That makes them the best method of defense for the citizenry.\nNot everybody has the time to train with a gladius, you know, but for\nsome reason those who prey on others seem to have more free time.  To\nextend this a bit further, you need only a certain level of competence\nto beat another with a range weapon.  Getting in their face with a\nweapon and winning is much more difficult, and requires more training\ntime the average citizen just does not have.  I've spent a few years\npracticing with a sword.  I can take the common person armed with one\n(though self-defense isn't the reason I own one).  My kid sister would\nhave an even chance of beating me, gun vs. gun, with only a month of\ntraining.  That makes firearms much better, in our eyes.\n\n\nExcellent point.  Perhaps you aren't so naive after all?\n\n\nTaken into consideration in what respect?  Though quite wrong, let's\nmake it a blanket statement for weapons in general.  This has been\ntaken into consideration.  We call use of them aggrivated assault,\nassault with a deadly weapon, assault with intent to kill, attempted\nmurder, and a whole host of others, and tack on extra prison time.\n\n\nIn Norway I suspect it was about the only weapon available.  You conquered\nyour land (among others) a full millenia before we were thought of, and\nshortly thereafter weapons weren't quite so common.  I suspect that a few\nworld wars made a difference too, since in times of emergency weapons\ntend to be turned in or donated to needy causes.  I'm curious, though,\nwere the weapons used in the crimes bought shortly before the crime, or\nwere they aquired by other means?  Any requirements other than just\nregistering the shotgun?\n\n\n"Come on down to honest Erik's Used Swords!  Here's a slightly-used\nshort sword, *THE* battlefield supremacy weapon of the eleventh\ncentury!  Only $39.95 with trade-in.  Easy financing!"  Sorry, I\ncouldn't resist.  You guys still slicing each other with long knives,\nor is this really not a problem?\n\n\nI'm all for that.  What gets me is that scandanavians (and yes, I'm only\na couple generations off the longship) used to be some of the most\nfeared warriors on the planet a mere millenia ago, yet now seem to\nspend their time sitting in spas and doing a bit of topless sunbathing.\nMaybe you had a bit more time, and a more homogeneous culture, to become\ncivilized with?\n\n\nYes.  We're too damned violent, partially I believe because we are not\na homogeneous culture and don't identify ourselves as "Americans" first\nand foremost.  I'm rather proud of my Norwegian and Danish heritage,\nwhereas I suspect you couldn't care less about that 2% Welsh blood in\nyour veins thanks to a raid in Ireland back in 1055?  The time scale\nand the homogeneous culture are important.  Equally important is a\nbasic philosophical difference in personal versus collective good.\nIn America, the individual is more important than the masses.  Personal\nliberties are prized above all.  This is, sadly, changing of late, but\nI trust you notice how this call for freedom makes laws that restrict\nindividuals for little collective benefit hateful to Americans.  I'd\nhazard a guess that, were America less interested in freedom and\npersonal liberty and more interested in collective good we never would\nhave sent our armed forces anywhere.  One poor effect of this culture\nwe have is that we're looking out for ourselves and it is quite easy\nto identify with only a small segment of the population.  My grandmother\ntells of being discriminated against back in Denmark because she spoke\n"low Dane," whereas others spoke "high Dane."  It was shortly after\nWorld War II, as I remember, that "low Dane" was abolished so there was\none common dialect.  We cannot fathom such a minor thing being a problem,\nbecause we have even more obvious means of identifying an "outsider."\n\n\nTake heart, yours is better than 90% of what gets posted by native speakers.\nAny helpful hints for our educational system?  People have this annoying\ntendency to drop out of school and sell drugs over here.\n\n[ ;-) And what kind of name is Thomas Parsli?  Here, you can use my great\ngrandfather's before he changed it: Christian Aarskog.  That's a\ngreat one for getting mispronounced.  I think that's why he changed it.\nI don't think he needs it anymore ;-) ]
From article <1qvjh9INNh4l@hp-col.col.hp.com>, by dduff@col.hp.com (Dave Duff):\n\n   Brilliant I like it!
Here is a press release from the White House.\n\n President Clinton's Remarks On Waco With Q/A\n To: National Desk\n Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100\n\n   WASHINGTON, April 20 -- Following are remarks by President \nClinton in a question and answer session with the press:\n\n1:36 P.M. EDT\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  On February the 28th, four federal\nagents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law\nagainst the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled\nweaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk.\nBecause the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day\nstandoff ensued.\n\n     The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every\nreasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without\nbloodshed and further loss of life.  The Bureau's efforts were\nultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were\ndealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably\ninsane.\n\n     He engaged in numerous activities which violated both\nfederal law and common standards of decency.  He was, moreover,\nresponsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the\naction against the compound in February.  Given his inclination\ntowards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no\nprovocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal\nagents against the compound.\n\n     This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on\nan operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure on\nKoresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully.\nThe plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even\nin the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause\npermanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people\nin the compound to come outside and to surrender.\n\n     I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  I\ndiscussed it with Attorney General Reno.  I asked the questions I\nthought it was appropriate for me to ask.  I then told her to do what\nshe thought was right, and I take full responsibility for the\nimplementation of the decision.\n\n     Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy.\nMr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal\nagents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his\ncaptives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not\nsurvive.  He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate\nresponsibility for the carnage that ensued.\n\n     Now we must review the past with an eye towards the\nfuture.  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and\nTreasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to\nuncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been\ndne differently.  I have told the departments to involve independent\nprofessional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  I\nexpect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required\nto complete the review.  Finally, I have directed the departments to\ncooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can\ncontinue to be fully accountable to the American people.\n\n     I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney\nGeneral, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on the\nfront lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult\ncircumstances.\n\n     Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorry\nfor the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end\nof this tragedy in Waco.  I hope very much that others who will be\ntempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David\nKoresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over\nthe last seven weeks.  And I hope very much that the difficult\nsituations which federal agents confronted there and which they will\nbe doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future\nwill be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what\nhas been learned now.\n\n     Q  Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why,\nafter 51 days, you decided --\n\n     Q  Mr. President, can you describe for us what it is\nthat Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation\nwith --\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I can't hear you both.  If one will go\nfirst and then the other.\n\n     Q  Sorry.  Can you describe what Janet Reno --\n\n     Q  Mr. President --\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll answer both your questions, but I\ncan't do it at once.\n\n     Q  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about\nthe nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was told by the Attorney General\nthat the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another\nstep in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And she\ndescribed generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted\nto go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause\npermanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it\nvery difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it was\nhoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.\n\n     I was further told that under no circumstances would our\npeople fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going to\nshoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and\nthere would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awful\nlot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials.\nThere were no shots coming back from the government side.\n\n     I asked a number of questions.  The first question I\nasked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasons\nI was given were the following:\n\n     Number one, that there was a limit to how long the\nfederal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the\nquality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be\nneeded in other parts of the country.\n\n     Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had\nnever seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced\nthat no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to\nbe made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult\nmembers to come out.\n\n     Number three, that the danger of their doing something\nto themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with\nthe passage of time.\n\n     And number four, that they had reason to believe that\nthe children who were still inside the compound were being abused\nsignificantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and\nunsafe conditions.\n\n     So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time.\nThe second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had\ngiven consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and\nevaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said\nthat the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were\nconvinced that the chances of bad things happening would only\nincrease with the passage of time.\n\n     The third question I asked was, has the military been\nconsulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco,\nthat's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious\nthat this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military\npeople were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some\nof the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the\nmilitary had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they\nhad, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one\nminor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military\n-- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming\nsignificance.\n\n     Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I\nsaid that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she\nshould proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by that\ntoday.\n\n     Q  Mr. President --\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead.\n\n     Q  Can you address the widespread perception --\nreported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were\ntrying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.  The only\nreason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only\nreason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to\nadd to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather\nlate in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who\nhad been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into\ncustody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events\nto unfold.\n\n     There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people\nspeculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General\non the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday.\nI called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry\nKing Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- it\nis not possible for a President to distance himself from things that\nhappen when the federal government is in control.\n\n     I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprised\nwould be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the\nAttorney General should resign because some religious fanatics\nmurdered themselves.  (Applause.)\n\n     I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this\nlife to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  These\npeople killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They were\nheavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly,\nand they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could to\navoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolate\nthemselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the\nchildren.\n\n     But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno,\nis when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you\nto tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why\nyou believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And she\nsaid, it's because of the children.  They have evidence that those\nchildren are still being abused and that they're in increasingly\nunsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier\nwith time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word for\nthat.  So that is where I think things stand.\n\n     Q  Can we assume then that you don't think this was\nmishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of\npatience?  And if you had it to do over again, would you really\ndecide that way?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assume\nis just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI has\ndone a lot of things right for this country over a long period of\ntime.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the\nWorld Trade Center in lickety-split, record time.  We want an inquiry\nto analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else we\nshould have known?  Is there some other question they should have\nasked?  Is there some other question I should have asked?  Can I say\nfor sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make\nthe outcome come different?  I don't know that.  That's why I want\nthe inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have\nsome independent law enforcement people, not political people, but\ntotally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best\nevidence we have.\n\n     There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of\nfanaticism all across the world.  And we may have to confront it\nagain.  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do,\nparticularly when there are children involved.  But I do think it is\nimportant to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the\npeople who killed others and then killed themselves.\n\n     Q  Mr. President, were there any other options\npresented to you for resolving this situation at any point from\nFebruary 28th until yesterday?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, yes, I got regular reports all\nalong the way.  There were lots of other options pursued.  If you go\nback -- you all covered it very well.  The FBI -- you did a very good\njob of it.  I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursued\nany number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them\nearly on seemed to be working.  Some of the children got out, some of\nthe other people left.  There was a -- at one point, there seemed to\nbe some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the\nauthorities.  And then he would say things and not do them and things\njust began to spin downward.\n\n     Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened\nyesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not\ninvolve other options except whether we should take more time with\nthe present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they\nwanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get\npeople out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves.\nThat's what they thought.\n\n     Q  Did the government know that the children did not\nhave gas masks?\n\n     Q     congressional hearings once the situation -- are\nyou in agreement with that?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  That's up to the Congress.  They can do\nwhatever they want.  But I think it's very important that the\nTreasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring\nin some outside experts.  And as I said in my statement, if any\ncongressional committees want to look into it, we will fully\ncooperate.  There is nothing to hide here.  This was probably the\nmost well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the\ncountry.
If I recall correctly, the bill would provide for concealed carry if\nthe person takes a 15-hr DPS safety course in firearms and pays a $150\nfee for the license.  The bill is apparently veto-proof in the House,\nbut LtGov Bullock has said it will never come to the floor of the\nSenate and Dreamboat Annie has vowed to veto it if it comes to her\ndesk.  *shrug*

:\n:According to an Australian documentary made in the year before the stand off \n:began, Koresh and his followers all believed he was Christ.  Koresh \n:had sex with children and women married to other men in the compound.  \n:These were the "perfect children" resulting from the "great seed" of \n:his "magnified horn".  Ex-members describe him in ways not dissimilar \n:to the way Jim Jones has been described.\n\nI don't know how accurate the documentary was; however, Koresh was never\nconvicted of any crimes against children, nor was the BATF after him for\nchild abuse.  Their purview (in this case) is strictly in firearms violations,\nso this information is irrelevant to the discussion.\n\n:FBI agents have to pass rigorous psychological examinations and background \n:checks.  Plus, those in charge will undoubtedly have to explain their \n:decisions in great detail to congress.  Why would the FBI want to fulfill \n:Koresh's own prophecy?\n\nThose in charge will undoubtedly have to explain *something*, but whether\ntheir answers even remotely resembles the truth we may never know.  And who\nis left alive to care whether the prophecy is fulfilled?  It only holds\nmeaning for the nine who survived.\n\n:>Correction:  The *FBI* said that two of the cult members said this; so far,\n:>no one else has been able to talk to them.\n:\n:So, when they talk to the news reporters directly, and relate the same \n:details, will you believe them?\n\n*IF* they confirm the story, I probably will.

As quoted from <C5J5IM.3C9@cbnewsc.cb.att.com> by rats@cbnewsc.cb.att.com (Morris the Cat):\n\nIf anybody wanted proof of the nonsense of the "you can't build guns" claim,\nthey need look no farther than the Philippines.  Amateur gunsmiths there\nregularly produce everything from .45 automatics to full auto shotguns.  Now\nif this guy wants to claim that the Philippines is either technologically\nsuperior to the US or that their transportation is better than ours, all I\ncan say is that he's living in a fantasy world.
You know, I was reading 18 U.S.C. 922 and something just did not make \nsence and I was wondering if someone could help me out.\n\nSay U.S.C. 922 :\n\n(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), it shall be unlawful for\nany person to transfer or possess a machinegun.\n\n Well I got to looking in my law dictionary and I found that a "person" \nmight also be an artificial entity that is created by government \nand has no rights under the federal constitution. So, what I \ndon't understand is how a statute like 922 can be enforced on \nan individual. So someone tell me how my government can tell\nme what I can or cannot possess. Just passing a law \ndoes not make it LAW. Everyone knows that laws are constitional\nuntil it goes to court. So, has it ever gone to court, not\njust your run of the mill "Ok I had it I am guilty, put me in jail"\n\nHas anyone ever claimed that they had a right to possess and was told\nby the Supreme Court that they didn't have that right?
/ iftccu:talk.politics.guns / mikey@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu (Strider) /  8:51 pm  Apr 12, 1993 /\n\n\nI've been watching this knife verses gun bit for a while now, (even\ncontributed a few comments) but this stuff "I'd rather face a knife than\na gun" has GOT to come from ignorance!  I used to think pretty much the\nsame thing, then I got 'educated.'\n\nPeople do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be, or how\nquickly you can be killed with one.  Most people don't understand that\nit takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick\n(within a minute or so) death.\n\nThe death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentage\npoints of each other.  Many people not realizing how deadly knives are\n'try their luck' and thus more get injured by knives.  A gun is deadly\nonly in a single direction and it's only advantage is that it is a\nremote control weapon.  A contact weapon such as a knife controls a\nspherical area 7 to 10 feet in diameter.\n\nMost people have never seen knife wounds, aside from slicing a finger by\naccident.  From 21 feet or so, a knife is very nearly an even match for\na holstered gun in experienced hands, even if the knife wielder has only\nmoderate skill.  From inside 10 feet or so, a knife is a match for a\nDRAWN gun.  A knife is utterly silent, it never jams and never runs out\nof ammunition.  It is limited only by the speed, dexterity skill and\nability of it's wielder.  Criminals in general are young, fast and\nstrong.  It's interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacks\nused by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled\nslashing attacks of novices.  I've talked to several well trained\nmartial artists.  They have unanimously agreed that if they ever go up\nagainst a knife they simply plan on being cut, hopefully not as bad as\nthe attacker.\n\nPracticing with firearms requires facilities and equipment.  Practicing\nwith knives requires only a small area and something to simulate a\nknife, say a popsicle stick or tooth brush.  Criminals practice their\nknife attacks in prison.\n\nIf you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realize\nthese facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong is\nthe knife ripping through your throat, or in the case of an experienced\nattacker, parts of your body falling off onto the ground.  A 60 year old\nman with arthritis can close that 7 yard distance and gut you in about\none and a half seconds.  Dennis Tueller with a broken leg in a walking\ncast managed it in two.  I've seen people close that distance and strike\nin 1 second.  I'm old, over weight and slow.  I can do it in 1.3\nseconds.  I've seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weapons\nthat you would not believe.  (How about a single stab wound to the chest\nwith a TABLE FORK!  In this case the attacker used the HANDLE, not the\npointed end.)\n\nAdd to this the 'fact' that hand gun 'stopping' power is largely a myth.\nExcept in the case of a central nervous system shot, or a round that\ndestroys the skeletal structure, it takes anywhere from 3 to twelve\nseconds for a bullet wound to 'take effect.'\n\nThis is true of even heart shots.  There is the case of the police woman\nin L.A., the first recorded survivor of a .357 shot to the heart.  That\nlady not only killed her attacker, but chased him down to do it!  All\nfour of her shots, fired after SHE had been shot, struck the perp.  Atta\ngirl!  The bullet entered her on a downward angle, went through the apex\nof her heart, down through the diaphragm, clipped her liver and\ndestroyed her spleen.  It then exited her back leaving a tennis ball\nsized hole.  She died about six times on the operating table, but was\nout of the hospital in 15 days and was back on full duty in eight\nmonths!  She was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest.  She was\non her way home so happened to have her gun.  No, she doesn't think\ncivilians should have the same rights.  Sigh.\n\nThe moral of the story is that even if you DO manage to shoot a knife\nattacker, you'd better be planning on doing some dodging.  A good\nalternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis.  People can often walk\n(a little) on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchor\nthem.  Many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contact\nweapons.  The target is as large as the traditional 'center of mass' and\nis more reliable to STOP somebody with a contact weapon, assuming a\ncaliber powerful enough to 'do the job.'  Hot .38's on up will usually\ndo this.\n\nRemember folks, the idea isn't to 'take em with you' but for you to live\nand them to fail, whatever the consequences for them.  This the reason\n'killing them' isn't our goal, or in many cases even good enough to keep\nus alive.\n\nI don't want to face a violent attack of any sort.  Knowing what I now\nknow, I can't rightly say I'd rather face a knife than an gun.  It would\nhave to depend on the attacker, and if I could pick and choose, I\nWOULDN'T BE THERE.  This is really the bottom line.  Criminals do not\nfear the law.  Criminals do not fear the weapon.  They fear the citizen\nbehind the weapon that has shown the resolution and determination to do\nwhatever it takes.
Woops.  I'm not sure if I screwed up, but this is either forgery or some \nsort of mistake (aborted post that didn't abort) on my part.  \n\nBogus article below if seen in another post should be ignored..  \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n/ iftccu:talk.politics.guns / bressler@iftccu.ca.boeing.com (Rick Bressler) /  3:29 pm  Apr 13, 1993 /\n/ iftccu:talk.politics.guns / papresco@undergrad.math.uwaterloo.ca (Paul Prescod) /  1:49 am  Apr 12, 1993 /\n\nLet's look at this critically:\n1.How many guns did this illegal manufacturing site make compared to\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n<and so on...>

Kratz comments above show otherwise.\n\n\nBingo - now the question is, does the Glock's qualify?  Let's see\nthe evidence that Kratz uses.\n\n\nBut first an aside.  Having an air gun proves nothing.  Moreover,\nmy comments are based on what Kratz writes.  He's free to argue that\nhe babbles in text but actually knows something off-line.\n\n\nHarder than what?  I note that almost all revolvers work the same way,\nso it can't be "harder than revolvers".\n\n\nSure they can.  (Moreover, we know now that Kratz' sample is\nunrepresentative.)  We can look at the reasoning.  It is basically\n"these Glocks are dangerous because they're not like my 1911/S&W third\ngeneration."  Part of that is true, but since those same people don't\nclaim that revolvers, which share the relevant property, are\ndangerous, we see that the argument fails.\n\n\nWhy would I care?  I'm not looking for more bogus reasoning.\n\n\nOne can make hundreds of simple statements without having anyone\n"getting right on your ass".  One merely has to make accurate simple\nstatements.

/ iftccu:talk.politics.guns / vincent@cad.gatech.edu (Vincent Fox) / 10:34 am  Apr 14, 1993 /\n\nThis isn't rec.guns, so maybe this is getting a bet technical, but I\ncan't resist....\n\n\nSometimes.....  Depends on WHY it misfired....\n\n\nI can't imagine doing much combat type shooting single action.....\n\n\nAssuming the cylinder WILL rotate....\n\n\nNever hurts to err on the side of safety, but if you've got one of those\n'new fangled' hammer blocks or transfer bar safeties, it's unnecessarily\nredundant.  I'd rather have the extra round.\n\n\nQuite true.  Speed loaders are a little less convenient to pack around\nthan magazines though.\n\n\nTrue, but this is a training function.\n\n\nCocked and locked for single actions or hammer down on double actions\nare the only carry modes that make sense...  The 80 series Colt's for\nexample are quite safe to carry this way.\n\n\nAgreed.\n\nNow that I've shot off my mouth a bit, let me back some of this up.  It\nis true that a simple misfire on a revolver doesn't cost you much.  On\nthe other hand, I've had all sorts of interesting things happen over the\nyears.  For example, I've had FACTORY ammunition that has had high\nprimers.  A high primer will tie your revolver up somewhere from seconds\nto minutes while you try to pound the action open to clear the problem.\nAn auto?  Jack the slide and continue.\n\nI've had bullets come out of the case, keeping the cylinder from\nturning, see clearing paragraph above.  About the WORST that can happen\nwith a semi auto is a double feed.  This can be cleared in seconds.\n\nMost revolvers are more 'fragile' then semi auto's.  There are all sorts\nof close tolerance parts and fitting involved.  Dropping the gun, or a\nblow to the gun or all sorts of things can take it out of action.  Many\nof the problems that can be cured on the spot with a (quality) semi auto\ntake a gun smith for a revolver.  In short a revolver MAY be less likely\nto malfunction, but as a rule when it does, you're out of the fight.\nThe majority of malfunctions that occur with semi autos does not fall\ninto that category.\n\nVincint makes many good points in this post, but leaves off the opposing\nview of most of them.  A real good starting place is Ayoob's "The Semi\nAuto Pistol for Police and Self Defense."\n\nIn general, I'd agree, the revolver is an excellent first gun and self\ndefense weapon for somebody that does not have the time, and inclination\nthat is necessary for the training and practice needed to use a semi\nauto effectively as a self defense arm.\n\nMost cops are notoriously indifferent to firearms.  If the department\nisn't going to train them, they aren't going to take the time on their\nown.  There is no doubt that training is an issue.  The amount of\ntraining required for effective use of a semi auto is probably several\ntimes that of a revolver.  Many cops don't bother.\n\nFor myself, I'd hate to be limited to one or the other.  I'd rather pick\nwhat fits better with my personal inclination, what I'm wearing that day\nand so on.  Like the Moderator on rec.guns says, buy em all!\n\nThat said, I have to admit that often my advice to people thinking of\nbuying their first defense arm is (right after taking a class) get a\nRuger or Smith revolver....  (Sorry Colt fans.  Colt revolvers are ok\ntoo!)\n\nIf this post had gone the other way, I'd be arguing for revolvers. :-)

: The issue has never been whether tanks were used in Detroit in 1967.  It\n: has been whether they fired their main guns.  \n\nNever?  This is incorrect.  Either you don't read very well or resort\nto falsehoods in an attempt to make a point.\n\nAt the risk of boring and belaboring the point, my claim was\nthe chain was regarding the tanks "last used in Detroit in 48".\nThe text follows.\n\n:  You did not merely claim that\n: tanks were used--you claimed that they fired their main guns to suppress\n: sniper fire and that they were "quite" effective at this.  \n\nIndeed, when Coffman claimed they were only used as APCs, I did say\nI had been told they did fire their main guns.  \n  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n: You continue to\n: back away from this claim and defend something else that nobody is\n: disputing.\n\nWell, the poster who I responded to did dispute the use of tanks\npost-48.  Rude of you to call Gary Coffman a nobody.  \n\n: "Well, it's not the main gun."  Gee, that's only the entire point.  Are you\n: now going to admit that you were wrong?\n\nThat was the entire point to *you*.  What exactly did I claim?\n   --------------------------------------------------\n  "I've heard eye-witness descriptions of tanks using their main guns\nto respond to sniper fire.  Quite effectively."\n   --------------------------------------------------\n\n  I wasn't wrong . . . I've heard those descriptions.  If you're\npaying attention, I've mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own\neyes, but the main gun firing was an account I heard.  That helps\npeople judge whether or not to kick in the, to use your words,\n"bullshit filters".  Stating that I *claimed* this is a falsehood.\n\n  What was it I claimed as fact?  Here's the entire post:\n  --------------------------------------------------\n\nCorrection.  I know they used tanks in Detroit 1968.  I saw em, it\nwas well covered in the news at that time.  Gordon Lightfoot mentions\nit in his song "Black Day in July".\n  --------------------------------------------------\n\n  Since you don't dispute that and claim that nobody else does, that\nmeans I was right.  \n\n: I will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the '67\n: riots.  There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place\n: without it being common knowledge even 26 years later.  The American\n: military firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have\n: been *big* news.\n\n   So one would suppose.  Some folks think in happened in 48.  \n\nAwesley goes on:\n  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.\n\n: To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion\n: grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be\n: perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since\n: it makes your other claim seem more plausible.\n\nJohn, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you're losing it so you\nhave to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said\nnothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you\nneed some help, let me know and I'l take your side of this for a\nwhile.  You're not scoring here, you're boring here. \n\n: If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been\n: screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about\n: it. \n\n   Glad to know you're such an expert.  Nice to hear some an\nauthority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it\nhad happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an\nauthority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged\nmassive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot.\nSome claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but\nthe Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was "several".  I've also\nheard some things about that but I won't dare repeat them.  You'd\nassert that I claimed they were truth.\n\n: Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up. \n\n   Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the \ndifference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26 \nyears ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks.\nSo it would have been an Army cover-up.\n\n   Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building\nwere burnt, some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember, I was and\nam inclined to believe an old sarge or two.\n\n: If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I prefer\n: to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that\n: those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.\n\n   Given the level in destruction in Detroit, I'm quite willing to believe\nthat they did fire their guns.\n\n   Now then, we've bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to read\nthis far and all you've managed to say is that you don't believe the\naccount I cited.\n\n: --John L.

The Swiss population is (and well was) far larger than that. I think\nyour question should be, "...losing sleep over a million expert\nriflemen?" Certainly he could have conquered Switzerland, but\na million armed militiamen (especially in a mountainous area, \nwhere tanks' effectiveness is limited) would have made it a\nreal pain. The question a conqueror would ask, is "is it worth \nthe trouble?" The more difficult an invasion is, the more likely\nthe answer would be "no."

As quoted from <1993Apr5.172734.8744@icd.ab.com> by kdw@icd.ab.com (Kenneth D. Whitehead):\n\n\nThere were some significant differences.  Whereas the Branch Davidians are\nreported to have gotten along rather well with their neighbors, the MOVE\npeople are generally conceded to have gone far out of the way to antagonize\ntheir BLACK neighbors, using loudspeakers to all hours of the night, keeping\nlarge piles of garbage, promoting rat and insect infestation, and allegedly\nthreatening to kidnap their neighbors' children.\n\nStill the same sort of questions regarding use of force remain in that case.
Did they or did they not sustain Miller's conviction? I don't have the\ntext of the case handy. \n\nYes, shotguns had been used in WWI, the Spanish-American War, and the\nUS Civil War. That was not in question. The possession of a sawed-off\nshotgun was, i.e., a weapon altered to improve concealibility.\n\n\nYou are free to produce evidence that I'm not willing to abide with\nall the implications of this. \n\nJust because I don't whole-heartedly endorse the NRA position does not\nmean that I oppose the RKBA. This attitude is what makes the NRA\nunpopular.

Such a measure would also have another benefit. It would relieve the\nvarious states of the thorny problem of what to do with the hundreds\nof millions of dollars hunters pour into the economy annually. I'm\nsure that, to attain sure a lofty, humane, liberal and ecologically\n(not to mention politically) correct goal, the environmental and animal\nrights groups/individuals supporting such a measure would be more than\nwilling to add their names to a list of supporters seeking increased\ntaxation to replace these lost revenues. I am equally confident that\nthese same entities, given their noteworthy record in the area of social\nresponsibility and respect for private property, would feel morally\nand ethically bound to raise the necessary funds to acquire the\nhundreds of thousands of acres of land now held in private hands\nsolely for use as private hunting preserves by the landowner(s). To\ndo less than this would place these same groups/individuals in\nthe ethically untenable (to say nothing of environmentally and\npolitically incorrect) position of sanctioning the logging and\nsubsequent development and urbanization of these former private\nhunting lands, which would no longer be useable by, or of any\nbenefit to, the landowner(s) in such a capacity.
It was around 1969 in the Shenandoah Valley near Woodstock, Virginia.  Me,\nmy wife, a friend, his wife, and his 2 kids were hiking in a totally\ndesolate mountain area.  All of a sudden, large rocks began raining down\non us.  Looking up, we saw at least 3 punks gleefully letting loose rocks\nfrom what was an obvious stash.  They were a couple hundred feet above us.\nMeanwhile, the women and kids were screaming and running for cover and the\npunks were shrieking with laughter.  Me and my friend yelled for them to\nknock it off.  They responded that we should "Get f***ed!".  Me and my\nfriend drew our pistols and fired a couple of times into the trees above\ntheir heads.  They ran.  With no more 3-5 pound rocks coming at our heads,\nwe proceeded on our journey.\n\nSorry, but me and my friend saw no need to let it evolve to a more\n"violent" level than we were already experiencing.  I guess we should\nhave tried harder to understand and cope with the anger that society\nhad instilled in them and was driving them to do such things.  Guess\nthat's a cross I'll have to bear.

Has anyone noticed or commented on the fact that so many of those who\nwere willing, nay demanding, that we wait forever for Mr Hussein and\nIraq, that we use tremendously costly "sanctions", to avoid a loss\nof life, are now at the fore front of those clammoring that we should\nhave smashed those "religious radicals" and we were wasting money allowing\nthis stand off to go on  ?

That really depends upon where you draw the line while defining\nthese weapons, and also on if you intend the law to be reflective of\nmodern practice five months or five centuries down the road.  I'll give\nyou a little hint:  see that manure pile in the farmer's field down the\nroad?  In the USA, that is a weapon of mass destruction, biological in\nnature, because if it gets washed into an open well it will contaminate\nthe aquifers that supply thousands of cities with drinking water.  So,\nwhere do *you* draw the line?  In the USA, the EPA has ruled that\na pile of scrap iron is illegal.  Care to draw a thinner line this time?

The San Francisco Examiner reports that Clinton has issued instructions\nto federal law enforcement that they may not kill or injure anyone to \nresolve the Waco situation.

Hi. I've just finished reading S414, and have several questions about\nthe Brady bills (S414 and HR1025).\n\n1. _Are_ these the current versions of the Brady bill?\n     What is the status of these bills?  I've heard they're "in committee".\n     How close is that to being made law?\n\n2. S414 and HR1025 seem fairly similar.  Are there any important\n   differences I missed?\n\n3. S414 seems to have some serious loopholes:\n  A. S414 doesn't specify an "appeals" process to wrongful denial during\n     the waiting period, other than a civil lawsuit(?)  (S414 has an appeals\n     process once the required instant background check system is established,\n     but not before).\n  B. the police are explicitly NOT liable for mistakes in denying/approving\n     using existing records (so who would I sue in "A" above to have an\n     inaccurate record corrected?)\n  C. S414 includes an exception-to-waiting-period clause for if a person\n     can convince the local Chief Law-Enforcement Officer (CLEO) of an\n     immediate threat to his or her life, or life of a household member.\n     But S414 doesn't say exactly what is considered a "threat", nor does\n     it place a limit on how long the CLEO takes to issue an exception\n     statement.\nTrue?  Have I misunderstood?  Any other 'holes?\n\n4. With just S414, what's to stop a person with a "clean" record from\n   buying guns, grinding off the serial numbers, and selling them to crooks?\n   At minimum, what additional laws are needed to prevent this?\n\n   'Seems at min. a "gun counting" scheme would be needed\n   (e.g., "John Doe owns N guns").  So, if S414 passes, I wouldn't be surprised\n   to see legislation for stricter, harder-to-forge I.D.'s plus national gun\n   registration, justified by a need to make the Brady bill work.\n\nPlease comment.  I'm mainly interested in specific problems with the current\nlegislation--I don't mean to start a general discussion of the merits\nof any/all waiting-period bills ever proposed.
You're getting warmer.  The 'little thing in the trigger' has to be\ndepressed before the trigger can move.  What this means is the damned\nthing won't go off until the trigger is pulled.  This makes it just\nabout (there HAVE been some problems, but we're assuming the gun is\nfunctioning correctly..) as safe as a revolver.  The gun when working\ncorrectly is totally drop safe.\n\nNow, in police work this is a consideration.  There is not a single\ndocumented case I'm aware of where a police officer was killed because\nhe failed to operate the safety on his firearm.  There are quite a few\ndocumented cases where criminals got hold of the cops gun and couldn't\nfigure out how to get the safety off in time to use the gun, thus the\nproprietary nature of the safety (to the criminal at least) very likely\nprevented the office from getting shot.\n\nThe purpose of a safety is to make the gun safe from unintentional fire.\nThis does not mean it should be so complicated as to slow down\nintentional use!  Thus the Glock safety is perfectly adequate from a\n'safety' standpoint, but not necessarily the most desirable from the\nstandpoint of open carry where it is easily grabbed by somebody else.\nBy this criteria it DOES make a lot of sense as a concealed carry piece.\nFrom the standpoint of police use, it is no better (or worse) than a\nrevolver as far as being 'proprietary' to the officer in the method of\nfiring it.\n\nThe ideal solution may someday be biometric sensing of the user so that\nthe firearm can't be used by anybody but it's owner, but for now the\nwide variety of safety systems helps, unless the criminal happens to be\nfamiliar with that particular type of firearm.
I don't know what Traders is claiming, but it appears to me that\nthe Oakland Tribune has censored gun ads in the past.  Likewise\nfor the San Francisco Chronicle, and I have never seen a gun\nad in the San Francisco Examiner.\n\nSpecifically, about a year ago on Thursdays, when Traders placed\nits ads, the Chron. ad would not have any graphics representing\nany handgun sale, though text could list it.  The Trib. would\nrun a graphic of a handgun.  The Examiner would not have a Traders\nad at all.\n\nOver the past year while Oakland politicians have made a lot of noise\nabout measures to fight crime the Trib stopped taking the Traders\nad, then started publishing it, but without any handgun graphic, then\nstopped, then started.  Since the Trib. was sold some months ago it\nhas not had the Traders ad.  During one of these non-ad interludes\na Traders employee told me that the Trib. had refused to take their\nads.\n\nYes, the usual Chron. Thursday ad was there today, with graphics\nrepresenting rifles, safes, etc. as usual.
Not so.  Surveys have shown while the public thinks certain types\nof gun control may be acceptable they do believe they have an\nindividual right to keep and bear arms, and that the police should\nnot have /discretion/ over who may and may not own firearms.\n\n\nBy the end of the Clinton administration a lot of things will be\nscrewed up.  Hell, we'll probably be just like England.\n\n\n"Tough titty" ?  My how eloquent you are.\n\nAs for your claim, I think Clinton has a big fight ahead of him if\nhe thinks he's going to pass some comprehensive gun legislation.\nHe will sign the Brady Bill if it gets to his desk.  We will do\nwhatever we can to either keep that from happening, or modify it\nsuch that it is acceptable to us.\n\n\nSorry, that's not possible.  And that's why we won't give them up\neither.  Legally or illegally, American's will keep their firearms.\nThe number of unregistered weapons in New York City is in the millions.\nThere aren't even close to that number of violent criminals there.\n\n\nIf the gov't was serious about stopping violent crime they would\nkeep violent criminals in jail for a long long time where they\nbelong instead of letting them out on early release.\n\n\nHey, we can go into politics too if we feel like it.\n\n\nI don't believe this one bit.\n\n\nSnore.  Like I take advice on the RKBA from a Brit.  No way.\n\n\nYou watch too much "Star Trek".  Actually, this is an understandable\nattitude from a Brit; you are a subject of the state.\n\n\nNot necessarily.  There are ways of resisting oppression without\ngetting caught by the gov't.\n\n\nThe "abstract criminal" like the ones who killed a relative of mine\nwhile she was working in a carry-out.\n\n\nWhile undesirable, they are sometimes unavoidable.  If you don't want\nto resist a criminal attack by all means do nothing.  I will (a) take\nmy chances resisting violent attack, and (b) stand a better chance of\nbeing unharmed than someone who does nothing.\n\n\nWhat a joke.  Criminals want a disarmed population.  How can you keep\ncriminals from preying on us after our best means of self defense is\ntaken away ?
Oh Christ, here we go again. I'm actually going to assume that\nthis was a serious posting, fool that I am.\n\n \nAnd I suppose I should just take your word for it. Did you ever\nthink that many people who use firearms to protect themselves\nmight not admit to it because of the ridiculous laws which exist\nforbidding concealed carry?\n\n \nI already own a cool jacket. I ride a bicycle to work and park\nit behind my desk. And if my woman decides to go with someone\nelse, I'd be disappointed but killing her new suitor will probably\nnot endear her to me any more than before. Frankly, I've never\nmet a woman worth killing for anyway. (Now, an AR-15 with a chrome\nbarrel, THAT's worth killing for ...!-))\n\n \nDoes this pinhead know something the rest of us don't?\nI'm not too worried about federal martials coming to get my guns.\nThe government can't seem to keep violent criminals in jail since\nthey don't have enough prison space, and the legal system is over-\nburdened anyway. Where are they going to put all the millions of\ngun-owners who won't fork over their weapons? Maybe you'd like to\nvolunteer the services of your humble abode, since you obviously\nfeel sooooo strongly about this.\n\n \nYour argument has been rendered useless. Accept this.

This was posted to the firearms-politics mailing list.\n==============================================================\nHi Folks;\n\nWednesday marked day 2, the beginning of the trial.  Opening\nstatements were given by both the prosecution and the defense,\neach side presenting its version of what happenned last August.\n\nThe prosecution argued that Weaver and his family moved to\nIdaho in 1983 anticipating a battle with the "evil" federal\ngovernment.  The prosecution alleges that Weaver sold federal\nagents "sawed off" shotguns and later failed to appear for\ntrial: Despite repeated "good faith" efforts to get Weaver\nto surrender peacefully, Weaver refused.  The shootout erupted\nwhen Weaver discovered agents on a surveillance mission and\nbegan firing.  According to the prosecution, three people\nwere taking an "offensive action" against an FBI helicopter\nwhen an FBI sniper killed Vicki Weaver.\n\nThe defense argued that Weaver and his family moved to northern\nIdaho in 1983 to practice their religion in peace.  They wanted\nsimply to be left alone.  Weaver was induced by federal agents to\nsell the short-barrelled shotgun (and did not, as the prosecution\nalleged, want to become a "regular supplier").  The defense also\nargued that the federal government sought to arrest Weaver when\nhe wouldn't become an informant [it is not specified explicitly,\nbut I assume that this is a reference to the white separatist\nangle of the story.  We'll know more as things develop].  The\nfailure to appear in court happenned because Weaver was given\nan incorrect court date and then indicted before that date.\nThe shootout occurred when federal agent Arthur Roderick killed\nWeaver's dog that was in proximity to Weaver's son, Samuel.  Weaver\nthen fired in self-defense.  In the ensuing battle, federal\nagent William Degan was killed (when his gun was later found,\nthere were 7 .223 cases nearby and the gun was on semi-automatic:\nHowever, agents were near the body for an extended period of\ntime and could have played with the select-fire - this will\nhave to be more fully explained).  Finally, the defense claims\nthat Vicki Weaver was only going to "look at the body" [not recover?]\nof her son when she was cut-down by an FBI sniper.\n\nProsecution quote: "Weaver wanted that confrontation, and he made\nthat confrontation." -- Asst. U.S. Attorney Kim Lindquist\n\nDefense quote: "The evidence in this case is going to show that\nthis is a case where Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris are charged\nwith crimes they didn't commit in order to cover crimes that\nthe government did commit."  -- Gerry Spence  [nice soundbite!]\n\nNotes: The _Idaho Statesman_ claims that Weaver supporters\nheeded a call from Spence not to repeat yesterday's protests\noutside the courthouse.  However, the local NBC affiliate\nagain had footage on the 10:00 news with 5 supporters including\n"Tim" again.  "Tim" claimed he was a skinhead, who were "ordinary,\nworking class people."  He also claimed he was for "white pride,\nnot white power."\n\nOutside the courthouse the television crew had an impromptu interview\nwith Bo Gritz, who charged that the neo-nazi protestors are exactly\nwhat the government wants to smear Randy Weaver.\n\nIn an affiliated article carried in the _Idaho Statesman_, about\na dozen lawyers were among the 70 or so people packed into the\ncourthouse.  These lawyers were present to watch Gerry Spence\nin action, and to perhaps learn something from him.  Some\ntidbits: Spence flatly told the jurors that he and his son Kent\nwere volunteering their time to represent Weaver because they\nbelieved in him.  Spence, during his 90-minute opening statement,\nrepeatedly walked behind Weaver and placed his hands on the\ndefendants shoulders (Weaver broke down and cried during the\nrecounting of his wife's death), and Spence compared the "sawed\noff" shotgun to driving 56 mph when the limit was 55 (another\ngood one!).\n\nToday (Thursday, April 15th) the prosecution was scheduled to\nbegin presenting evidence.\n\nDrew\n=============================================================
Medical info without a name/body attached is completely useless for\ntreatment.\n\n\nThus making it as secure as cash, for some purposes, but far less\nsecure for others.\n\n\nSure they do.  The prospective sitter may have a nasty habit of molesting\nkids three or four months into the job.  The references may not have\nknown him long enough or may not have picked up on this yet.\n\nRemember, criminal conviction info is public, so if you're going to\nargue for an ID card, other people are going to have a strong argument\nthat it disclose public info.\n\n\nThus making it useless for negative information.\n\n\nYeah right.  How are you going to keep doctors from spilling the\nbeans?  (We already know that you can't keep cops from disclosing\ninfo, but at least that info is typically supposed to be public\nanyway.)\n\n\nThe article discusses technology, not appropriate policy.  It also\nfails to deal with "what happens if the folks with the secrets blab".\n\n-andy
At the risk of starting the 'my gun is better than yours' flame\nwar, I must disagree.\n	\n	There is no secret in handling a Glock.  In fact, it is often\nchosen (besides its other merits) because it shoots like a revolver does\nbasically.  It can limit the training time (read budget $$$) due to the\nfact there are no 'external' safties other than the trigger, hence less\ntraining time required. \n\n	Smith & Wesson (among other types) are chosen due to the fact taht\nthey do have the external safties (hammer drop,as well as mag drop) which\nif properly used have saved many lives when 'Mr. Bad' snatched the gun\nfrom the officer and tried to shoot said officer the gun was on safe and\nwould not fire.  This point had been made in many articles in various \ngun magazines.  If fact, one author (can't remember who) staged a little\ntest where he had a revolver and a S&W on safe laying on a table and asked\npeople with little firearms experience to on his signal, grab the gun and\nshoot a target.  He timed the people using each gun.  The revolver times\nwere pretty close, but some of the times with the S&W were in minutes, or\nthe person just gave up because they could not figure out the saftey.\n\n	You don't often see Colt 45 autos issued due to the light trigger\nwhich can be accidentally fired in a stress situation, opening the issuing\ncity,county, etc.. to lawsuits, bad press, etc..\n\n	Of course any problem can be overcome with enough training, but\nsuch training is not always available to budget crunched departments.  I\nknow if I were a Cop I would want something like a S&W just for the off\nchance of the gun getting taken away.  The safety doesn't guarantee that\n'Mr. Bad' won't figure it out and shoot me, but it could buy enough time\nto draw a second gun and shoot 'Mr. Bad' before it's too late.\n\n	Don't think I am too biassed here just because I have had 3 Glocks\nin my possession at one time, because I have had a .45 as well.  In fact,\nit was my first handgun.  Remember, the ultimate 'safety' is YOU the\noperator, and no safety is going to stop an negligent discharge (note I\ndon't say accidental) if you break the rules of gun handling.\n\n	As per the part of being light weight and looking cool, I agree\n100%.  I wouldn't rule it out as a first purchase.
The letter implies that both warrants were issued before the Feb 28th\nshootout but doesn't say so exlicitly.  ACK!
In some South American countries, after political undesirables disappeared,\nthe family would get a notice of death and a bill for the disposal\nof the body.  You apparently think that would be a good idea.\n\nThe Federal Government initiated this action against Koresh and his\nfollowers, surrounded them for 51 days, engaged in psychological\nwarfare, used heavy military equipment against US citizens on\nUS soil; and now that the compound caught fire while they were\npumping in CS gas after knocking holes in the building; disavows\nall responsibility.  Big Brother is NOT always right.
No it's not.  If you would have read my other post I was accurate.  Here's what\n\n[material from another post]------------------------->  The other point that I\nwould like to make because I know it's true (looked this one up in the Illinois\n                  this is for you Andy-----> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nstatutes before) is that it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon in Illinois.\n^^^^^^^^ <------ Also for you Andy.\n\nAnd then I went on to say:\nThere is no such thing as a CCW for us ordinary folk here.\n[end of quoted material]\n\nOf course I forgot to mention who "us ordinary folk" are so just for Andy I'm\ngoing to go to the library tomorrow and photocopy the part of the Illinois\nstatutes with this information and post it.  Ordinary citizens CAN NOT get a\nlicense to carry a concealed weapon.  There are very few people who can.  I\neven asked my lawyer friend about this and he told me that only certain people\ncan get licenses for concealed carry.  He couldn't remember which people but he\nknew for sure that regular citizens couldn't get that type of license.  He told\nme to go check at the library for the statutes which I did.  I'll post that\ninfo tomorrow night.  Until then.......

Article in this morning's Houston Post...."negotiators send food to\nrebellious inmates as humanitarian gesture"...speaking about the Ohio prison\nriot where they have killed at least one of the hostage guards.\n\nI know it's not the same "group" but the mindset appears to be common to\n"those what rule" here lately....they won't give diddley to the BD's in Waco\nbut they treat criminals as deserving of "humanitarian gestures".\n\nThis is but another indicator that the criminal caste seems to enjoy more\npriviliges in today's society than their victims or other law abiding\ncitizens. What is it that makes the criminal so precious to the "leaders of\nthe system"?\n\nCould it be that the criminal is one of the "tools" the "authorities" are\nusing to "excuse" some of the rights negation they are trying to foist upon\nthe law abiding citizen in the name of crime control....don't solve the crime\nproblem because then the citizen couldn't be held hostage to "our help".\n\nIf the crime problem were solved in favor of the citizen/victim at the\nexpense of the criminal none of the crap such as RICO and gun banning could\nbe used as excuses to work the agenda of those who would control our every\nmove and thought.\n---\n .

gassed.\n\nBut apparently true.  My opinion, only, of course.\n\n\nNo, it is not.  It is possible the FBI planned for this to happen, and the  \ngunfire heard was the FBI keeping the folks inside.  I'm not proposing this as  \nthe way it went down, but just to point out that it's not "undeniable" that if  \nthey walked out yesterday, they would be alive today.\n\n\nMy heart "bleeds" for no one.

I'll point out that the whole point of the difficult amendment\nprocess was to require a super-majority to change the Supreme Law,\nmaking it impossible for a "majority" of the people to simply change\nthe law on a whim.  Simply changing the meaning based on "the\nrepresentatives" of the people effectively destroys the amendment\nprocess.  The State's, you know, are also entitled to a say under\nthat process.\n \n\n       I'll note that that right could be considered protected under\nthe first amendment's protection of peaceful assembly.  Unless\nyou would consider a militia inherently non-peaceful, then they've\nstated the same thing twice.
Note that Bo Gritz was on the Populist party ticket with David\nDuke (for veep) in 1988 until he found out that Duke was leading\nhe ticket, when he withdrew his candidacy.  So Gritz gave up his\nchance to be Vice President of the US just to aviod supporting\nDuke.

Ever since the siege at Waco started the FBI spokesman has been\nstressing how unstable and paranoid David Koresh was.  He stressed how\nlikely it was the the Branch Davidians would commit mass suicide.  He\nwas concerned with the safety of the children.\n \nWhat did the FBI do to defuse the situation,  Did they try to reassure\nKoresh?  DId the FBI offer medical assistance to the BD?  Did the FBI\noffer them a supply of water when the BD pump stoped working?  Did the\npermit Koresh to communicate with anyone outside the compound?\n \nWhat the FBI did was harass the Branch Davidians as much as possible.\nThey kept powerful lights shining on the compound, shut off their\nelectrical power, put their pump out of action, assaulted their ears\nwith loud noise, cut off their communication with the outside and kept\nlimiting their permitter.  The stated goal was to put pressure on\nDavid Koresh.\n \nWas the FBI attempting to get Koresh to surrender or were they hoping\nto get Koresh so mad that he and some of his followers would attack\nthe the tanks.\n \nIt appears that the tactics employed by the FBI did drive Koresh over\nthe edge.  The blame for the deaths should be shared by both the\nfederal experts whose tactics drove Koresh over the edge and the fools\nat the ATF who planed the raid.\n \nStupidity and incompetence of the BATF and the FBI leadership have\nresulted in the needless death of 90 innocent people.\n \nIf every thing had gone as planned 90 people would be alive today.\nInstead the ATF screwed up and caused the death of 90+.

Well, I didn't bother writing to Boxer, Feinstein or Eshoo, the terrible\ntrio who allegly represent me.  Instead, I wrote to Bentsen.  My letter\nwas not exactly strongly-worded; I simply stated that the BATF approach\nwas immoral (military-style assault, firing into a house where they knew\nthere were kids).\n\nAparently, Bentsen forwarded my letter to the BATF and they responded to \nme directly.  It follows the text of your reply pretty closely.  However,\nI intend to send another letter directly to them, in return.\n\n\nThis section is not in the letter that I received.  The parts about ATF\nlogo and steenking badges or their loss of the element of surprise\nwere not included, either.\n\n\nThe same guy with the bad handwriting apparently signed my letter, "for\nRichard L. Garner; Chief, Special Operations Division".
When will you people realize that our right to keep and bear isn't\nprimarily intended to be for protecting against criminals and beasties\nin the wild?  Granted, it is a big part, but we also need military style\nweapons so we can fight off the government when they come to our door.\nWhen ten agents come to my door, it would be nice to be able to shoot\nall of them for 'not upholding the constitution to the best of their\nability'.  It will be a lot harder doing that with the puny weapons you\nlisted above.\n\nPlease read the Federalist papers for all clarification on RKBA.  These\ndocuments have cleared up plenty of misnomers that friends of mine have\nhad.
The FBI released large amounts of CS tear gas into the compound in\nWaco.  CS tear gas is a fine power.  Is CS inflammable.  Grain dust\nsuspended in air can form an explosive mixture, will CS suspended in air\nform an explosive mix? Could large quantities of CS have fueled the\nrapid spread of fire in the compound?\n \nPlease note I am directing all followups to talk.politics.guns
They sure make it sound like that.\n\n\nEven a simpleton knows a baseball bat is considered a deadly weapon. \nIf one cannot run away (e.g. old, infirm, even middle-aged if the\nassailant is younger), a handgun is the most effective means of\ndefense. You won't even have to fire a shot 98% of the time.\n\n\nAny real streetfighter (and there are LOTS of them), with or without a\nknife, will kick the living sh** out of most people "trained in\nunarmed self defense".  For the majority of people, a gun is the most\neffective form of self defense.
The existence of the weapon in and of itself (and this is also\ntrue for biologics and chemical weapons, but for slightly different\nreasons) poses a threat to living critters.  Can you say "neutron\nand other radiation flux due to radioactive decay", boys and girls?
Please tell me what you think would have happened had the people \ncome out with their hands up several weeks ago.\n\n\nMore than someone who would not release children from the compound.\n\nI.e., more than David Koresh/Vernon Howell/"Jesus Christ".\nI saw lengthy excerpts from an Australian documentary made in \n1992 that clearly showed that this was a cult.\n\nI am not pleased with the BATF handling of the affair.  I think they \nbungled it badly from the start.  But I don't think they are \nresponsible for the fire, which started in two different places.
So, your opinion is truth.  I see...  :-)\n\n\nYou can believe that if you wish.  It is undeniable, however, that people \nhave left the compound unharmed and alive earier in the standoff.\n\nAnd since their leader was preaching that they would have an apocalypse, you \ncan not say undeniably that there wouldn't have been a mass suicide if the \nFBI had simply stayed outside and waited another 51 days.\n\n\nI am the heartless bleeding heart?  You are not making sense.\nYou seem to have no concern that someone would keep children inside this \ncompound when they had 51 days to let them out.  That sounds pretty heartless \nto me.\n\nI just heard on the news that some of the survivors regret they hadn't \nstayed in the inferno to prove their loyalty to Koresh.  This makes me \nsad and sick.\n\n\nHave you ever heard of Jonestown?\nThe sad thing is the people inside the compound were the authority \nworshipers and their only authority was Koresh/Howell.   If these \npeople were able to think for themselves, there would likely be a lot \nmore survivors today.  Koresh preached a fiery apocalypse as early as \nlast year.\n\n\nBy all means, the FBI should be investigated, too.  \nBTW, I thought the second ammendment was God.  :-)
As quoted from <1993Apr14.184448.2331@gnv.ifas.ufl.edu> by jrm@gnv.ifas.ufl.edu:\n\nThat depends only on the profit of doing so.  The differences\nin cost of production will determine local vs smuggle.\n\n\nThose of us who have actually made semi-autos (full-autos are easier)\nare getting quite a giggle out of this.  I'd estimate that 5% of\nthe people at my high school couldn't do it.  (I was one of the\nfew who failed shop.)  People who have actually seen me do mechanical\nwork would probably say that 1% is more like it.\n\nStarting with even 90% of the population, you can be sure that\n"enough" people will be motivated.\n\n\nHow much is "through the nose"?  After all, we know quite a bit\nabout how much a gun is worth to a criminal, so if that is dwarfed\nby the price demanded by the "bad" part of that 90%....\n\nThe relevant economic analysis has been made.  The "profit" of\ngun crime is high enough that the price required to push criminals\nout of the market is high enough that everyone will be motivated.\nThat analysis ignored some "improvements" in the criminal gun\nmarket that could make them even cheaper.  (They're not efficiently\nused now, but a "loaner" set up would drive the value still higher\nwithout affecting criminal use.)\n\n-andy
Good question; I don't know what the law considers them.\n\n\nI believe this is what happens in some states.
There are roughly 1200 fatal, firearms-related accidents each year.\nThe large majority involve rifles and shotgun; there are under 500\nfatal handgun accidents each year. I really doubt all of those\noccur while the pistol is holstered, so the number of "self-inflicted\ngunshot wounds by people wearing thigh holsters" is probably\nwell under 250 per year.\n\n\nHandguns designs have included a "hammer block" since around 1960\nor earlier. This is a metal part which physically seperates\nthe cartridge and the firing pin: Even under impact, the gun\ncannot fire. The hammer block is connected to the trigger and\nis pulled out of the way as the trigger is pulled. As a result,\nmodern pistols can fire _only_ if the trigger is pulled (or \nin some cases, if they are cocked by hand and then dropped.) \n\n\nI don't know about animal attacks, but there are 23,500 murders \neach year and under 500 die in the manner you suggest. If only\n2.1% of the murders were killings by "wacko"s, you would be\nwrong. Worse, there are also 102,500 rapes and 1,055,000 aggravated\nassaults each year. These numbers make violent attacks, and \npreventing them, thousands of times more significant than the\naccidents you are worried about.\n\n(These figures, by the way, are from the FBI's "Uniform Crime\nReport" for 1990. I'll stop by a library tomorrow and look at\nthe "National Crime Victimization Survey", which is more\nspecific about where and when the crimes occured.)
And, had not these citizens accepted the moral responsibility to\nprotect their own lives, there could well have been at least\n13 innocent victims lying dead and several criminals still out \nwalking the streets perpetrating their crimes on others.
For goodness sake if they had fired a cruise missile at the compound more\npeople would have come out alive. It was obvious to anyone with the remotest\ncontact with reality that such an outcome was likely (not just possible)\nhowever the fire started. As, Mr Lawnmower, you seem to have already entered\nyour own little virtual reality I guess you can't be expected to understand\nthings in the real universe.

There are, but not any that would help Texans: In many states,\nsuch laws have been found to violate the state constitution. \nBut the federal Second Amendment does not apply directly to the\nstates. It was written to limit the federal government only. \nThe Fourteenth Amendment was written to extend the restrictions\nof the Bill of Rights to the state level. However, the exact\nwording of the Fourteenth Amendment is very vague. The Supreme\nCourt has been dancing around the issue without facing it\ndirectly for over 100 years. In practice, the Bill of Right\n(indirectly applies through the Fourteenth) applies to the\nstate governments only if the Supreme Court has ruled that \nparticular provision. The Court has made no such rulings on\nthe Second Amendment.

I really don't understand all this!  I watched on satellite network feeds as  \nperhaps 90 people died before my eyes, while the two Huey's fanned the flames,  \nand the FBI stopped the firetrucks at the gate. \n\nSomething was VERY wrong with that scene.\n\nPerhaps if I'd watched RAMBO movies, I might've been dulled to the pain of  \nfellow humans dying.\n\nThank GOD I still feel.  I'm very sorry for you who don't.  For you who think  \nthey got what they deserved.  Can you really believe that?  Even if Koresh was  \nthe sadistic mad man they said he was, did the others deserve his fate?   If,  \nin fact, he was mad, wasn't that even more reason to believe he duped his  \nfollowers, and therefore they were innocent, brainwashed, victims?  Is there  \nany scenaro that justifies all that death?\n\nAnd if not, it is clear that the deaths would not have occured if the BATF has  \nnot FUCKED UP initially, and now the FBI got impaitent and pushed Korech over  \nthe edge.\n\nAnd that's if you buy the latest version of the "story" hook, line, and sinker.   \nI have believed all along that they could not let them live, the embarrassment  \nto the BATF and the FBI would've been too severe.\n\nRemember, this was a suspicion of tax-evasion warrant.  There were no  \nwitnesses, except the FBI.  All information filtered through the FBI.  All they  \nhad to do was allow one remote controlled pool camera be installed near the  \nbuilding, and the press could've done their job, and would've been able to back  \nthe FBI's story with close up video, while incurring no risk to the press.   \nUnless they did not want the public to see something.

I was under the impression that to obtain fissionable materials (i.e.,\nplutonium or reactor/weapons-grade uranium) one was required to obtain\na federal permit to own such materials.\n\n\nActually, why bother looking it up?  From the material we covered last\nterm (in 10 weeks) of Ge/Ch 127 (Nuclear Chemistry), I could *derive*\nwhat it would take to build a bomb.  And as far as the explosive charge,\nI (as a chemist) could synthesize a variety of explosives from commonly\navailable chemicals in the garage if I felt like.  The electronics \nbehind the detonator and the shaped charges are a little trickier,\nhowever . . . but not impossible using a few "tricks of the trade."\nAnd if I really wanted to be nasty, I could include a core of \nhydrogen and deuterium . . .\n\nOf course, the hardest part is getting the fissionable material\nto start with, and living long enough to put a bomb together. \n(Plutonium has some *nasty* properties . . .)

Ever hear about cutting off the electricity? That was done.\nHow effective is an electric stove then?
No chance.  If that CS ignited at all, it would have been\nquite similar to a grain bin explosion.  Explosion, I note.  The\nentire compound would have been leveled, not merely burned.  As\nthere was no explosion, there was no CS ignition causing the fire.\n\n	Note: at five miles a decent grain elevator explosion will\nknock you on your butt and your ears will ring for days.
