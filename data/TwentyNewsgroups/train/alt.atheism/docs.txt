I think that domestication will change behavior to a large degree.\nDomesticated animals exhibit behaviors not found in the wild.  I\ndon't think that they can be viewed as good representatives of the\nwild animal kingdom, since they have been bred for thousands of years\nto produce certain behaviors, etc.
(Deletion)\n \n \nYou have given that example. It is not lenient. End of argument.\n \nAnd chopping off the hands or heads of people is not lenient either. It\nrather appears that you are internalized the claims about the legal system\nwithout checking if they suit the description.\n \nAnd wasn't the argument that it takes five men to rape a woman according\nto Islamic law?\n \n \n \nNo, I even believe what I don't like. Can you give better answers than that?\nHave you got any evidence for your probably opposite claims?\n \n \n \nA fact, if memory serves. And most will see the connection between the\nprimitive machism in the Orient and in Islam.\n \n \nAs usually you miss the point. Aids is  neither spread only through sex\nnor necessarily spread by having sex. Futher, the point is, a very important\npoint, the urge for sex is stronger than the fear of AIDS. It is even\nstronger than the religious attempts to channel or to forbid sex. The\nconsequences of suppressing sex are worse than the consequences of Aids.\nPlease note that the idea that everybody would end up with AIDS when sex\nis not controlled is completely counterfactual.
Yes, but whose freedom?  The world in general doesn't seem to value the\nfreedom of Tibetans, for example.
->	First I want to start right out and say that I'm a Christian.  It \n->makes sense to be one.  Have any of you read Tony Campollo's book- liar, \n->lunatic, or the real thing?  (I might be a little off on the title, but he \n->writes the book.  Anyway he was part of an effort to destroy Christianity, \n->in the process he became a Christian himself.\n\nSounds like you are saying he was a part of some conspiracy.  Just what organization did he \nbelong to? Does it have a name?\n\n->	The book says that Jesus was either a liar, or he was crazy ( a \n->modern day Koresh) or he was actually who he said he was.\n\nLogic alert - artificial trifercation.  The are many other possible explainations.  Could have been\nthat he never existed.  There have been some good points made in this group that is not \nimpossible  that JC is an amalgam of a number of different myths, Mithra comes to mind.\n\n->	Some reasons why he wouldn't be a liar are as follows.  Who would \n->die for a lie?  Wouldn't people be able to tell if he was a liar?  People \n->gathered around him and kept doing it, many gathered from hearing or seeing \n->someone who was or had been healed.  Call me a fool, but I believe he did \n->heal people.  \n\n\nLogic alert -  argument from incredulity.  Just because it is hard for you to believe this doesn't\nmean that it isn't true.  Liars can be very pursuasive, just look at Koresh that you yourself site.\nHe has followers that don't think he is a fake and they have shown that they are willing to die.\nBy not giving up after getting shot himself, Koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what \nhe believes.  As far as healing goes.  If I rememer right the healing that was attributed is not\nconsistent between the different gospels.  In one of them the healing that is done is not any more \nthat faith healers can pull off today.  Seems to me that the early gospels weren't that compeling,\nso the stories got bigger to appeal better.\n\n->	Niether was he a lunatic.  Would more than an entire nation be drawn \n->to someone who was crazy.  Very doubtful, in fact rediculous.  For example \n->anyone who is drawn to David Koresh is obviously a fool, logical people see \n->this right away.\n->	Therefore since he wasn't a liar or a lunatic, he must have been the \n->real thing.  \n\n\nOr might not have existed, or any number of things.  That is the logical pitfall that those who\nuse flawed logic like this fall into.  There are bifurcations (or tri, quad, etc) that are valid, because\nin the proceeding steps, the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are \npossible.  Once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are, then arguments among\nthe alternatives can be presentent, and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excluding\nall other possible alternatives.\n\nHowever, if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive, then any conclusions bases on the \nincomplete set are invalid, even if the true choice is one of the original choices.  I have given at \nleast one valid alternative, so the conclusion that JC is the real McCoy just because he isn't one of\nthe other two alternative is no longer valid.\n\n->	Some other things to note.  He fulfilled loads of prophecies in \n->the psalms, Isaiah and elsewhere in 24 hrs alone.  This in his betrayal \n->and Crucifixion.  I don't have my Bible with me at this moment, next time I \n->write I will use it.\n\nJC was a rabbi.  He knew what those prophecies were.  It wouldn't be any great shakes to make\nsure one does a list of actions that would fullfill prophecy.  What would be compeling is if there\nwere a set of clear and explicit prophecies AND JC had absolutely NO knowledge of then,  yet \nfullfilled them anyway.\n\n->	I don't think most people understand what a Christian is.  It \n->is certainly not what I see a lot in churches.  Rather I think it \n->should be a way of life, and a total sacrafice of everything for God's \n->sake.  He loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the \n->same.  Hey we can't do it, God himself inspires us to turn our lives \n->over to him.  That's tuff and most people don't want to do it, to be a \n->real Christian would be something for the strong to persevere at.  But \n->just like weight lifting or guitar playing, drums, whatever it takes \n->time.  We don't rush it in one day, Christianity is your whole life.  \n->It is not going to church once a week, or helping poor people once in \n->a while.  We box everything into time units.  Such as work at this \n->time, sports, Tv, social life.  God is above these boxes and should be \n->carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for \n->ourselves.  \n\nHere I agree with you.  Anyone who buys into this load of mythology should take what it says \nseriously, and what it says is that it must be a total way of life.  I have very little respect for \nXians that don't.  If the myth is true, then it is true in its entirity.  The picking and choosing\nthat I see a lot of leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nJim	  \n\n\n\n\n---\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJames L.

(reference line trimmed)\n\n\n\nWell, I'd say that a murderer is one who intentionally committed a murder.\nFor instance, if you put a bullet into a gun that was thought to contain\nblanks, and someone was killed with such a gun, the person who actually\nperformed the action isn't the murderer (but I guess this is actually made\nclear in the below definition).\n\n\nWhat do you mean by "reasonable?"\n\n[...]\n\nYes, it is bad to include the word being defined in the definition.  But,\neven though the series is recursively infinite, I think the meaning can\nstill be deduced.\n\n\n[math lesson deleted]\n\nOkay, let's look at this situation:  suppose there is a longstanding\nfeud between two families which claim that the other committed some\ntravesty in the distant past.  Each time a member of the one family\nkills a member of the other, the other family thinks that it is justified\nin killing a that member of the first family.  Now, let's suppose that this\nsequence has occurred an infinite number of times.  Or, if you don't\nlike dealing with infinities, suppose that one member of the family\ngoes back into time and essentially begins the whole thing.  That is, there\nis a never-ending loop of slayings based on some non-existent travesty.\nHow do you resolve this?\n\nWell, they are all murders.\n\nNow, I suppose that this isn't totally applicable to your "problem," but\nit still is possible to reduce an uninduced system.\n\nAnd, in any case, the nested "murderer" in the definition of murder\ncannot be infintely recursive, given the finite existence of humanity.\nAnd, a murder cannot be committed without a killing involved.  So, the\nfirst person to intentionally cause someone to get killed is necessarily\na murderer.  Is this enough of an induction to solve the apparently\nunreducable definition?  See, in a totally objective system where all the\ninformation is available, such a nested definition isn't really a problem.

I answer from the position that we would indeed place these people\n  in prison for life.\n\n  That depends not only on their predisposition towards murder, but\n  also in their success rate at escape and therefore their ability\n  to commit the same crimes again.\n\n  In other words, if lifetime imprisonment doesn't work, perhaps\n  it's not because we're not executing these people, but because\n  we're not being careful enough about how we lock them up.\n\n/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\ \n\nBob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM \n\nThey said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away,\nand sank Manhattan out at sea.

(Deletion)\n \nYes, sorry. I have got that wrong. My apology.\n \n \n(Deletion)\n \n \nSo? No fun, but I must have met the minority then.\nAnd "given by god" refers to any action whereby a god\ngod causes or better effects something.\n \n \nRob, I am not intimate with Jewish theology, but I understand\nthat you are a Messianic Jew. Correct me if I am wrong, but\nit appears that the views of Messianic Jews on metaphysics\nis different to that of the majority of Jews. While Jewish\ntheology overall is quite distinct from the Christianic god\nviews, I have heard that it is possible for Jews to attribute\nevil to their god, an no-no for Christians, the Bible is\nstill seen as effect of the interaction of some god with man.\n \n \n(Deletion)\n \nThe context was metaphysics, even when the process of adapting\nthe commandments is not transcendent, the justification of the\nprocess lie in metaphysic specualtion. I wonder how you break\nout of the shackles of having metaphysics in your system.\n \n \n(Deletion)\n \nIs is in a book that commands to commit genocide among other\nreprehensible deeds. The context is repulsive, and it is\nfoul play, IMO, to invoke some relatively enlightened passages\nas an example for the content of the whole book.\n \n \n(Big deletion)\n \nNo, not the interpretation of some laws, but the interpretation of\nthe bible. As in the example that Sodom and Gomorrha mean argue\nwith god. The whole idea that it is metaphorically and yet allows\nyou to argue with a god (whatever that means, that alone is a theo-\nlogic question) is proof of a theology used.\n \n \n \nIt is an important question in the light of what for instance the\npassage witrh Sodom and Gomorrha means. Either there is some connection\nbetween the text, the fact that it exists, and your interpretation of\nit, or it is purely arbitrary.. Further, the question is why is has\none to carry the burden of Biblical texts when one could simply write\nother books that convey the message better. You might answer that one\ncan't becuase  some peculiar Biblical information might be lost, but\nthat holds true of every other book, and the question remains why has\nthe Bible still a special place? Can't it be replaced somehow? Is it\nok to bargain the dangerous content of the Bible against some other\nmessage that is included as well?\n \n \n(Deletion)\n \nSorry, but there are worse systems does not say anything about if\none could not have a better system.\n \n(Deletion)\n \nIf we read two stories in the Bible, one that god commands people\nto kill children for being idolaters and another where god kills\nchildren directly, what is more important to resolve, the message that\nchildren are to be killed or if it has  to be done by god?\n \n \nAnd the argument you have given is a fallacy, while it may not be important\nin the context you have given to find out if god is corporeal or not, it\ncan be crucial in other questions. Religious believers resolve contradictions\nwith that they choose one of the possibilities given in an arbitrary way,\nand have the advantage of being able to attribute their decision to some\ngod.
Could you expand on your definition of knowing? It seems a bit monolithic\nhere, but I'm not sure that you intend that. Don't we need, for example, to\ndistinguish between "knowing" 2 plus 2 equals 4 (or 2 apples plus 2 apples\nequals 4 apples), the French "knowing" that Jerry Lewis is an auteur, and\nwhat it means to say we "know" what Socrates said?
Looking at historical evidence such 'perfect utopian' islamic states\ndidn't survive.

(Deletion)\n \nYou have demanded harsh punishments of several crimes. Repeating\noffenders have slipped in only as justification of harsh punishment at\nall. Typically religious doublespeak. Whenever you have contradictory\nstatements you choose the possibility that suits your current argument.\n \nIt is disgusting that someone with ideas that would make Theodore KKKaldis\nfeel cozy can go along under the protection of religion.
Well, it looks like the folks in soc.religion.islam have loosened up\na bit and are discussing this topic as well as the banking/interest\ntopic.  A few books on the subject have also been mentioned in addition\nto the one you mentioned.  These may be hard to find, but I think I may\ntake a stab at it out of curiosity.  I know the one film I saw on this\nsubject was pretty weak and the only two quotes I have seen which were\nused to show science in the Koran (which I posted here) were also pretty \nvague.  I suspect that these books will extrapolate an awful lot on the\nquotes they have.\n\nAt least one poster on the Islam channel seems to have some misgivings\nabout the practice of using the Koran to decide what is good science.\n\nI wonder if Islam has ever come up with the equivalent of the Christians\n"Creation Science" on any topic.  It would be interesting to find a history\nof scientific interpretations of the Koran, to see if anyone used the Koran\nto support earlier science which has since been discarded.  It is all too\neasy to look at science as it exists today and then "interpret" passages\nto match those findings.  People do similar things with the sayings of\nNostradamus all the time.
I don't think such tools exist either. In addition, there's no such\nthing as objective information. All together, it looks like religion\nand any doctrines could be freely misused to whatever purpose.\n\nThis all reminds me of Descartes' whispering deamon. You can't trust\nanything. So why bother.\n\nCheers,\nKent
I'll take a wild guess and say Freedom is objectively valuable.  I base\nthis on the assumption that if everyone in the world were deprived utterly\nof their freedom (so that their every act was contrary to their volition),\nalmost all would want to complain.  Therefore I take it that to assert or\nbelieve that "Freedom is not very valuable", when almost everyone can see\nthat it is, is every bit as absurd as to assert "it is not raining" on\na rainy day.  I take this to be a candidate for an objective value, and it\nit is a necessary condition for objective morality that objective values\nsuch as this exist.
And that, of course, is the point.   You can't simply divide the\nworld into atheists and non-atheists on the basis of god-belief.\n\nIf all you care about is belief in a supernatural deity, and\nhave nothing to say about behaviour, then belief in a supernatural\nbeing is your criterion.\n\nBut once you start talking about behaviour, then someone's suscept-\nibility to be led by bad people into doing bad things is what you \nare - I assume - worried about.\n\nAnd in that area, what you care about is whether someone is sceptical,\ncritical and autonomous on the one hand, or gullible, excitable and\neasily led on the other.\n\nI would say that a tendency to worship tyrants and ideologies indicates\nthat a person is easily led.   Whether they have a worship or belief \nin a supernatural hero rather than an earthly one seems to me to be\nbeside the point.
I love it, I love it, I love it!! Wish I could fit all that into a .sig\nfile! (If someone is keeping a list of Bobby quotes, be sure to include\nthis one!)\n\n\n\nThe Flat-Earthers state that "the Earth is flat" is a fact. I don't accept\nthis, I think it's an unproven opinion, and I think the Round-Earthers are\nright because they have better evidence than the Flat-Earthers do.\n\nAlthough I can't prove that a god doesn't exist, the arguments used to\nsupport a god's existence are weak and often self-contradictory, and I'm not\ngoing to believe in a god unless someone comes over to me and gives me a\nreason to believe in a god that I absolutely can't ignore.\n\nA while ago, I read an interesting book by a fellow called Von Daenicken,\nin which he proved some of the wildest things, and on the last page, he\nwrote something like "Can you prove it isn't so?" I certainly can't, but\nI'm not going to believe him, because he based his "proof" on some really\nquestionable stuff, such as old myths (he called it "circumstancial\nevidence" :] ).\n\nSo far, atheism hasn't made me kill anyone, and I'm regarded as quite an\nagreeable fellow, really. :)
[deleted]\nthink:\n[deleted]\n                                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nLet me first say that "to believe that no gods exist" is in fact \ndifferent than "not believing in a god or gods". \n\nI will argue that your latter statement, "I believe that no gods exist"\ndoes rest upon faith - that is, if you are making a POSITIVE statement \nthat "no gods exist" (strong atheism) rather than merely saying I don't  \nknow and therefore don't believe in them and don't NOT believe in then\n(weak atheism). Once again, to not believe in God is different than saying  \nI BELIEVE that God does not exist. I still maintain the position, even \nafter reading the FAQs, that strong atheism requires faith.\n\nBut first let me say the following.\nWe might have a language problem here - in regards to "faith" and\n"existence". I, as a Christian, maintain that God does not exist.\nTo exist means to have being in space and time. God does not HAVE\nbeing - God IS Being. Kierkegaard once said that God does not\nexist, He is eternal. With this said, I feel it's rather pointless\nto debate the so called "existence" of God - and that is not what\nI'm doing here. I believe that God is the source and ground of\nbeing. When you say that "god does not exist", I also accept this\nstatement - but we obviously mean two different things by it. However,\nin what follows I will use the phrase "the existence of God" in it's\n'usual sense' - and this is the sense that I think you are using it.\nI would like a clarification upon what you mean by "the existence of\nGod".\n \nWe also might differ upon what it means to have faith. Here is what\n\nfaith \n1a: allegiance to duty or a person: LOYALTY\nb  (1): fidelity to one's promises\n   (2): sincerity of intentions\n2a (1): belief and trust in and loyalty to God\n   (2): belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion\nb  (1): firm belief in something for which there is no proof\n        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n   (2): complete trust\n3: something that is believed esp. with strong conviction; esp: a system \n   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nof religious beliefs\nsyn see BELIEF\n\n\n\nOne can never prove that God does or does not exist. When you say\nthat you believe God does not exist, and that this is an opinion\n"based upon observation", I will have to ask "what observtions are\nyou refering to?" There are NO observations - pro or con - that\nare valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief. All observations\ncan only point you in a direction - a direction that we might even\nbe predisposed to (by predisposed I mean, for example, people whoes \npartents "believe in God" also tend to). To actually draw a conclusion\nabout the "existence" or "non-existence" of God requires a leap - and\nyou have made this leap when you actively say "I believe that God  \ndoes/does not exist". Personally, I think that both statements are\nmisguided. Arguing over the "existence" of God is precisely the wrong way\nto find Him (and yes, I use "Him" because a personal God is the only \nviable concept (IMO) - if a person wants to use "She" go ahead. Of course \nGod is neither He nor She - but we have no choice but to \nanthropomorphise. If you want me to explain myself further I'll be \nglad to.) \n\n\n\nAnd please, if someone does not agree with me - even if they violently \ndisagree - it's in no ones advantage to start name calling. If a person \nthinks I've misunderstood something in the FAQs, or if they they think \nI have not read them well enough, just point out to me the error of my \nways and I correct the situation. I'm interested in a polite and well  \nthought out discussion.
I didn't say it NEVER mentioned Satan, I said it RARELY, if at all.  Please \nexcuse me for my lack of perfect memory or omnipotence.
Actually, it is simple.\n\nA person P has committed a crime C in country X if P was within the borders\nof X at the time when C was committed.  It doesn't matter if the physical\nmanifestation of C is outside X.\n\nFor instance, if I hack into NASA's Ames Research Lab and delete all their\nfiles, I have committed a crime in the United Kingdom.  If the US authorities\nwish to prosecute me under US law rather than UK law, they have no automatic\nright to do so.\n\nThis is why the net authorities in the US tried to put pressure on some sites\nin Holland.  Holland had no anti-cracking legislation, and so it was viewed\nas a "hacker haven" by some US system administrators.\n\nSimilarly, a company called Red Hot Television is broadcasting pornographic\nmaterial which can be received in Britain.  If they were broadcasting in\nBritain, they would be committing a crime.  But they are not, they are\nbroadcasting from Denmark, so the British Government is powerless to do\nanything about it, in spite of the apparent law-breaking.\n\nOf course, I'm not a lawyer, so I could be wrong.  More confusingly, I could\nbe right in some countries but not in others...
But, the goal need not be a subjective one.  For instance, the goal of\nnatural morality is the propogation of a species, perhaps.  It wasn't\nreally until the more intelligent animals came along that some revisions\nto this were necessary.  Intelligent animals have different needs than\nthe others, and hence a morality suited to them must be a bit more\ncomplicated than "the law of the jungle."  I don't think that\nself-actualization is so subjective as you might think.  And, by\nobjectivity, I am assuming that the ideals of any such system could be\ncarried out completely.

Well, I could use the argument that some here use about "nature" and claim\nthat you cannot have superhuman powers because you are a human; superhuman\npowers are beyond what a human has, and since you are a human, any powers\nyou have are not beyond those of a human.  Hence, you cannot have superhuman\npowers.  Sound good to you?\n\nAnyway, to the evidence question: it depends on the context.  In this group,\nsince you are posting from a american college site, I'm willing to take it\nas given that you have a pair of blue jeans.  And, assuming there is some\ncoherency in your position, I will take it as a given that you do not have\nsuperhuman powers.  Arguments are evidence in themselves, in some respects.\n\n\nYep.\n\n\nGood.\n\n\n"Extra" evidence?  Why don't we start with evidence at all?\n\nI cannot see any evidence for the V. B. which the cynics in this group would\never accept.  As for the second, it is the foundation of the religion.\nAnyone who claims to have seen the risen Jesus (back in the 40 day period)\nis a believer, and therefore is discounted by those in this group; since\nthese are all ancients anyway, one again to choose to dismiss the whole\nthing.  The third is as much a metaphysical relationship as anything else--\neven those who agree to it have argued at length over what it *means*, so\nagain I don't see how evidence is possible.\n\nI thus interpret the "extraordinary claims" claim as a statement that the\nspeaker will not accept *any* evidence on the matter.
You misrepresent me, Selim.  The hard evidence for my statements about\nhis lack of objectivity are presented quite clearly in the book\n"Orientalism" by Edward Said.  Edward Said, by the way, is a Christian,\nnot a Muslim.\n\n\nRegarding Bernard Lewis:\n\nHim being a Zionist gives him a political motive for his\ngiving misrepresentations and half-truths about Islam.\n\nRead "Orientalism" by Edward Said -- see the evidence for yourself.\n\nIn fact, I may post some of it here (if it isn't too long).\n\n\nI haven't read Lewis's article, so I can't comment directly upon it, and\nhave only spoken about his writings _in general_ so far, that his\npolitical motives make him a biased writer on Islam.  His anti-Islamic\npolemics, as I understand it, are often quite subtle and are often based\non telling half-truths.\n\nAgain, read "Orientalism" by Edward Said.  I am _not_ asking you to take\nwhat I say on trust, in fact I am urging you not to do so but to get\nthis book (it is a well-known book) and check the evidence out for\n_yourself_.\n\n\nIf slavery is _in reality_ (as opposed to in the practice of some\nMuslims) opposed by Islam, then using slaves for sexual\npurposes is necessarily opposed too.\n\n\nI understand your point of view, Selim -- I think, rather, it is _us_\nwho are not getting through to _you_.\n\nSome of the points you repeat above I have already answered before.\n\nRegarding women, I have made posting after posting on this subject,\nshowing that Islam is not anti-woman, etc.  However, have you been\ncompletely ignoring my postings or just missing them?  I just reposted a\nvery good one, under the title "Islam and Women", reposted from\nsoc.religion.islam.  If this has already disappeared from your site,\nthen please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of this\nexcellent article.  \n\nIMHO, your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient.\n\nRegarding slaves, _my_ posting on slavery -- the second one I made,\nwhich is a repost of an article I wrote early last year -- is based\ncompletely on the Qur'an and contains numerous Qur'anic verses and\nhadiths to support its point of view.\n\nOur approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historical\nstandpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur'an\nand hadiths.  Now, just because people say they are Muslims and perform\na particular action, does that automatically mean that their action is\npart of Islam, even if it is opposed by the Qur'an and Sunnah?  No!  Of\ncourse not.\n\nLet me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this for\nyou.  The Qur'an prohibits drinking.  Now, if a person says "I am a\nMuslim" and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now mean\nthat Islam teaches that people should drink beer?  Of course not, and\nonly an idiot would think so.\n\nDo you see my point?\n\n\nYou are judging Islam here on capitalist terms.  Capitalism is an\nideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise\ntheir wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings.\nTo say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking --\nIslam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be\ncapitalist.  (This does not mean that Islam does not support a\nfree-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of \ncapitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it.)\n\n\nOne can postulate numerous reasons for this.  Your theory is that it is\nbecause Islam is not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.\n\nSelim, I will give you a clear historical example to show you the\nfallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) that\nIslam => lack of education and power.\n\nFor a large part of history, the Islamic world was very powerful.  For a\nsignificant section of history, the Islamic world was the foremost in\nthe sciences.  So to say that Islam is, for example, anti-education is\ncompletely absurd.  You try to blame this situation on Islam -- history\nshows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must be\nother reasons for this situation.\n\n\nWell, Selim, your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent\nof your knowledge of Islam.  I really think you are not\nknowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims are\nfollowing the Qur'an or not.\n\n\nThe Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one\nstage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it is by "following the Qur'an"\nthat Muslims are backwards in education.  Selim, it is _your_ thesis\nthat is anti-historical, for you conveniently overlook this historical\nfact which contradicts your theory. \n\n\nYou have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it.\nSo far, it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education is\nquite contrary to history.  That you are so convinced of your views\nmakes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of\nthis.\n\n\nI think, Selim, you should consider taking your own advice.\n\n\nHere too.\n\n\nSelim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrate\nignorance, not only of Islam but also of Islamic history (particularly\nwith respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so I\nthink).  Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!\n\nSelim, if I remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts that\nyou are an apostate from Islam.  I think you should slow down and start\nthinking clearly about the issues, and start _reading_ some of our\npostings about Islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously\nhave.
Apparently not.\n\nIn response to his claim that it "terrifies" gay people not to be able\nto "indoctrinate children to our lifestyle" (or words to that effect),\nI sent Roger a very calm, carefully-written, detailed letter\nexplaining simply why the BSA policy does, indeed terrify me.  I did\nnot use inflammatory language and left myself extremely open for an\nanswer.  Thus far, I have not received an answer.  I can conclude only\nthat Roger considers his position either indefensible or simply not\nworth defending.\n\n\nIn fact, that's exactly the point: people can control their behavior.\nBecause of that fact, there is no need for a blanket ban on\nhomosexuals.\n\n\nYou tell me.
My own personal and highly subjective opinion is that freedom\nis a good thing.\n\nHowever, when I here people assert that the only "true" freedom\nis in following the words of this and that Messiah, I realise\nthat people don't even agree on the meaning of the word.\n\nWhat does it mean to say that word X represents an objective\nvalue when word X has no objective meaning?
Just what do gay people do that straight people don't?\n\nAbsolutely nothing.\n\nI'm a VERY straight(as an arrow), 17-year old male that is involved in the BSA.\n\nI don't care what gay people do among each other, as long as they don't make\npasses at me or anything.  At my summer camp where I work, my boss is gay.\nNot in a 'pansy' way of gay (I know a few), but just 'one of the guys'.\nHe doesn't push anything on me, and we give him the same respect back, due\nto his position.\n\nIf anything, the BSA has taught me, I don't know, tolerance or something.\nBefore I met this guy, I thought all gays were 'faries'.  So, the BSA HAS\ntaught me to be an antibigot.
Uh oh.  This looks a bit too much like Bobby's "Atheism Is False" stuff.  Are\nwe really going to have to go through this again?  Maybe the universe is\ncyclical!  :)  :(
I'd have to say that I have a problem with any organization, \nreligious or not, where the idea that _simple speech_ such\nas this is the basis for a crime.
See, we are disagreeing on the definition of moral here.  Earlier, you said\nthat it must be a conscious act.  By your definition, no instinctive\nbehavior pattern could be an act of morality.  You are trying to apply\nhuman terms to non-humans.  I think that even if someone is not conscious\nof an alternative, this does not prevent his behavior from being moral.\n\n\nI try to show it, but by your definition, it can't be shown.\n\nAnd, morality can be thought of a large class of princples.  It could be\ndefined in terms of many things--the laws of physics if you wish.  However,\nit seems silly to talk of a "moral" planet because it obeys the laws of\nphyics.  It is less silly to talk about animals, as they have at least\nsome free will.
Yes, I do.  \n\n  My argument is that the sole purpose of the death penalty is to\n  kill people.  That is it's primary (and I would argue only)\n  purpose.  To continue to kill people by a practice that has\n  almost no utility, especially when you know you will be killing\n  innocents, is unconscionable.\n\n  At the very least, the existence of the prison system and our\n  transportation system are based on their merits to society, not\n  their detriments.  We are willing to accept a few lost innocent\n  lives because there is an overwhelming benefit to the continued\n  existence of these systems.  One has to stretch the evidence and\n  the arguments to make the same claim for capital punishment.\n\n  Just in case I wasn't clear again:  We maintain a capital\n  punsihment system that kills innocent people and provides us with\n  no net positive gain.  Why?\n\n  Were you to pin me in a corner and ask, I would have to respond\n  that I don't belief the state should have the right to take life\n  at all.  But I won't open that debate, as it seems others are\n  tiring of this thread on a.a anyway.\n\n\n/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\ \n\nBob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM \n\nThey said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away,\nand sank Manhattan out at sea.
Well, that explains some things; I posted on soc.religion.islam\nwith an attached quote by Bobby to the effect that all atheists\nare lying evil scum, and asked if it was a commonly-held idea\namong muslims.  I got no response.  Asking about the unknown,\nI guess...\n\nKarl\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Could you explain what any of this pertains to? Is this a position\nstatement on something or typing practice? And why are you using my\nname, do you think this relates to anything I've said and if so, what.
"So after 1000 years of sightseeing and roaming around its \n	ok to come back, kill Palastinians, and get their land back, \n	right?"\n\nYes, that's casual antisemitism.    I can think of plenty of ways\nto criticize Israeli policy without insulting Jews or Jewish history.\n\nCan't you?
Is the distinction important?\n\n\nWell, our moral system seems to mimic the natural one, in a number of ways.\n\n\nI don't know.  What is wrong?  Is it possible for humans to survive for\na long time in the wild?  Yes, it's possible, but it is difficult.  Humans\nare a social animal, and that is a cause of our success.\n\n\nIsn't it?  Why don't you think so?\n\n\nNo.  As noted earlier, lack of mating (such as abstinence or homosexuality)\nisn't really destructive to the system.  It is a worst neutral.\n\n\nAgain, the mating practices are something to be reexamined...
That's the entire point!\n\n\nYes!\n\nNatural morality is a morality that developed naturally.\n\n\nHuh?
Good question.  I'm sure some biologist could answer better than I,\nbut animals brains are just set up differently.\n\nAnimals *can* be trained, but if they're instincts serve them well, there is\nno reason to contradict them.
: }Xenophobia, both *de facto* and *de jure* as implemented\n: }in legal systems, is widespread, while the Bible,\n: }although not 100% egalitarian, specifically preaches\n: }kindness to the stranger, and emphasizes in the Book\n: }of Ruth, that a foreigner can join the nation and\n: }give rise to one of the great heroes of the nation.\n: \n: Clearly better than the alternative, but as an American what strikes\n: me as strange about this story is that it should have even been\n: considered an issue.\n\nJim,\n\nThere are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread\nthat are a little confusing. An atheist is one for whom all things can\nbe understood as processes of nature - exclusively. There is no need\nfor any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is\nno purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by\nphysics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is\ndetermnined.\nThis would also have to include human intelligence of course and all\nits products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it\nacquire intelligence, it's just a happy accident. For an atheist, no\nevent can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less\nvalue than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-\nan event can have value. \nThe products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment,\nfrom teaching, training, observation and experience and are only\nsignificant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mental\nprocesses and the images they produce for us are just electrical\nactivity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. The human\nmind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a\nhill.\nHow then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing\nthe values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On\nwhat grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It\nseems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you\nhave to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what\nin nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to\nestablish your values.\nSince every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what\ndifference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or\notherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only\nway an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the\nobjection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn't like it\n- that's it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer\nthat it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries\nno weight in any "absolute" sense.\nThat you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God\nor God's commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\nnervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\nwith a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your\nobjections -seem- well founded is due to the way you've been\nconditioned; there is no "truth" content. The whole of your\nintellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.\nI didn't make these rules, it's inherent in naturalistic atheism and\nto be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any human\nthought, even your own. All of this being so, you have excluded\nyourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,\netc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no\nweight whatsoever.
Pardon me?   *I* am trying to apply human terms to non-humans?\n\nI think there must be some confusion here.   I'm the guy who is\nsaying that if animal behaviour is instinctive then it does *not*\nhave any moral sugnificance.   How does refusing to apply human\nterms to animals get turned into applying human terms?\n\n\nI'm sure you do think this, if you say so.   How about trying to\nconvince me?\n\n\nI've offered, four times, I think, to accept your definition if\nyou allow me to ascribe moral significence to the orbital motion\nof the planets.\n\n\nAh, the law of "silly" and "less silly".   what Mr Livesey finds \nintuitive is "silly" but what Mr Schneider finds intuitive is "less \nsilly".\n\nNow that's a devastating argument, isn't it.
Nope, I've answered each question posed, and most were answered multiple\ntimes.
I have never been to Wisconsin, though I have been to\nneighbor Minnesota. Being a child of the Middle Atlantic (NY, NJ, PA)\nI found that there were few states in the provences that stood\nout in this youngster's mind: California, Texas, and Florida to \nname the most obvious three.  However, both Minnesota and Wisconsin\nstuck out, solely on the basis of their politics.  Both have \nalways translated to extremely liberal and progressive states.\nAnd my recent trip to Minnestoa last summer served to support that\nstate's reputation.  My guess is that Wisconsin is probably the\nsame.  At least that was the impression the people of Minnesota left\nwith me about their neighbors.\n\nThe only question in my head about Wisconsin, though, is \nwhether or not there is a cause-effect relationship between\ncheese and serial killers :)
Well, most hangings are very quick and, I imagine, painless.\n\n\nAnd, hangings and firing squads are allowed today, too.  And, if these\nthings were not considered cruel, then surely a medical execution\n(painless) would not be, either.
The above is probably not the most representative paragraph, but I\nthought I'd hop on, anyway...\n\nWhat strikes me as self-contradicting in the fable of Lucifer's\nfall - which, by the way, I seem to recall to be more speculation\nthan based on biblical text, but my ex RCism may be showing - is\nthat, as Benedikt pointed out, Lucifer had perfect nature, yet he\nhad the free will to "choose" evil.  But where did that choice come\nfrom?\n\nWe know from Genesis that Eve was offered an opportunity to sin by a\ntempter which many assume was Satan, but how did Lucifer discover,\ninvent, create, call the action what you will, something that God\nhad not given origin to?\n\nAlso, where in the Bible is there mention of Lucifer's free will?\nWe make a big fuss about mankind having free will, but it strikes me\nas being an after-the-fact rationalisation, and in fact, like\nsalvation, not one that all Christians believe in identically.\n\nAt least in my mind, salvation and free will are very tightly\ncoupled, but then my theology was Roman Catholic...\n\nStill, how do theologian explain Lucifer's fall?  If Lucifer had\nperfect nature (did man?) how could he fall?  How could he execute an\nact that (a) contradicted his nature and (b) in effect cause evil to\nexist for the first time?
Yes I fully agree with that, but is it "I don't believe gods exist", or\n"I believe no gods exist"? As MANDTBACKA@FINABO.ABO.FI (Mats Andtbacka)\npointed out, it all hinges on what you take the word "believe" to mean.\n\nUnfortunately this is bound up in the definitions of strong and weak\natheism, at least according to the FAQ:\n\n# Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.\n# Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is\n# often referred to as the "weak atheist" position, and the latter as "strong\n# atheism".\n# \n# It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  "Weak\n# atheism" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  "Strong\n# atheism" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not\n# fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are "strong atheists".\n\n(From mathew's "An Introduction to Atheism" version 1.2 last modified 5-Apr-93)\n\nShould the FAQ be clarified to try to pin down this notion of "belief"?\nCan it?
Who has to consider it?  The being that does the action?  I'm still\nnot sure I know what you are trying to say.
Find an encyclopedia. Volume H. Now look up Hitler, Adolf. He had\nmany more people than just Germans enamoured with him.\n\nP.
For example, if it were instinctive not to murder...\n\n\nSo, only intelligent beings can be moral, even if the bahavior of other\nbeings mimics theirs?  And, how much emphasis do you place on intelligence?\nAnimals of the same species could kill each other arbitarily, but they\ndon't.  Are you trying to say that this isn't an act of morality because\nmost animals aren't intelligent enough to think like we do?
: 	Nice cop out bill.\n\nI'm sure you're right, but I have no idea to what you refer. Would you\nmind explaining how I copped out?
Are we talking about me, or the majority of the people that support it?\nAnyway, I think that "revenge" or "fairness" is why most people are in\nfavor of the punishment.  If a murderer is going to be punished, people\nthat think that he should "get what he deserves."  Most people wouldn't\nthink it would be fair for the murderer to live, while his victim died.\n\n\nPerhaps you think that it is petty and pathetic, but your views are in the\nminority.\n\n\nWhere are we required to have compassion, forgiveness, and sympathy?  If\nsomeone wrongs me, I will take great lengths to make sure that his advantage\nis removed, or a similar situation is forced upon him.  If someone kills\nanother, then we can apply the golden rule and kill this person in turn.\nIs not our entire moral system based on such a concept?\n\nOr, are you stating that human life is sacred, somehow, and that it should\nnever be violated?  This would sound like some sort of religious view.\n \n\nOnce a criminal has committed a murder, his desires are irrelevant.\n\nAnd, you still have not answered my question.  If you are concerned about\nthe death penalty due to the possibility of the execution of an innocent,\nthen why isn't this same concern shared with imprisonment.  Shouldn't we,\nby your logic, administer as minimum as punishment as possible, to avoid\nviolating the liberty or happiness of an innocent person?
[Pitt vs. Penn State controversy deleted]\n\nNo.  It wouldn't be sufficient cause to bitch to the system operator if this\nwas just some guy saying that atheists are going to hell.  The point was \nthat recently many messages were posted from that address.  Each of these\nmessages was posted to a different newsgroup, with the apparent intent of\nprovoking the readers of that particular group.  This, along with the fact\nthat these posts were written in all-caps, makes these posts suspect.\nWhoever is using this account is using it irresponsibly.  If it is the\nintended user, they should consider appropriate action.  If it is someone\nelse-- which seems a possibility, then this is also reason to report it.\n	We get many posts in the flavor of the one that started this thread.\nIt is only because I have seen posts on other groups by this user that I\nam considering action.
My point is that you set up your views as the only way to believe.  Saying \nthat all eveil in this world is caused by atheism is ridiculous and \ncounterproductive to dialogue in this newsgroups.  I see in your posts a \nspirit of condemnation of the atheists in this newsgroup bacause they don'\nt believe exactly as you do.  If you're here to try to convert the atheists \nhere, you're failing miserably.  Who wants to be in position of constantly \ndefending themselves agaist insulting attacks, like you seem to like to do?!\nI'm sorry you're so blind that you didn't get the messgae in the quote, \neveryone else has seemed to.
This is fascinating. Atheists argue for abortion, defend homosexuality\nas a means of population control, insist that the only values are\nbiological and condemn war and capital punishment. According to\nBenedikt, if something is contardictory, it cannot exist, which in\nthis case means atheists I suppose.\nI would like to understand how an atheist can object to war (an\nexcellent means of controlling population growth), or to capital\npunishment, I'm sorry but the logic escapes me.\nAnd why just capital punishment, what is being questioned here, the\npropriety of killing or of punishment? What is the basis of the\necomplaint?
New in this version:  challenge #5, plus an addendum summarizing\nCharley's responses to-date..\n-----------------------------------------\n\n*** This is a posting made periodically in an attempt to encourage\n*** Charley Wingate to address direct challenges to his evidently \n*** specious claims.  I'll continue to re-post periodically until\n*** he answers them, publicly indicates that he won't answer them,\n*** stops posting to alt.atheism, the alt.atheism community tells\n*** me to stop, or I get totally bored.  I apologize for the \n*** somewhat juvenile nature of this approach, but I'm at a loss\n*** to figure out another way to crack his intransigence and \n*** seeming intellectual dishonesty.\n***\n*** This is re-post #3.\n\n\nCharley,\n\nI can't help but notice that you have still failed to provide answers\nto substantive questions that have been raised in response to your\nprevious posts.  I submit that you don't answer them because you\ncannot answer them without running afoul of your own logic, and I once\nagain challenge you to prove me wrong.  To make the task as easy for\nyou as possible, I'll present concise re-statements of some of the\nquestions that you have failed to answer, in the hope that you may\naddress them one at a time for all to see.\n\nShould you fail to answer again within a reasonable time period, I\nwill re-post this article, with suitable additions and deletions, at\nsuch time that I notice a post by you on another topic.  I will repeat\nthis procedure until you either address the outstanding challenges or\nyou cease to post to this newsgroup.\n\nI would like to apologize in advance if you have answered any of these\nquestions previously and your answer missed my notice.  If you can be\nkind enough to re-post or e-mail such articles, I will be only too\npleased to publicly rescind the challenge in question, and remove it\nfrom this list.\n\nNow, to the questions...\n\n1. After claiming that all atheists fit into neat psychological\npatterns that you proposed, then semi-retracting that claim by stating\nthat you weren't referring to *all* atheists, I asked you to name some\natheists who you feel don't fit your patterns, to show that you indeed\nwere not referring to all atheists that you are aware of.  You failed\nto do so.  Please do so now.\n\nQuestion: Can you name any a.a posters who do not fit into your\nstereotype?\n\nHere is the context for the question:\n\n\n\n2. You have taken umbrage to statements to the effect that "senses and\nreason are all we have to go by", and when pressed, you have implied\nthat we have an alternative called revelation.  I have repeatedly\nasked you to explain what revelation is and how one can both\nexperience and interpret revelation without doing so via our senses\nand reason.  You failed to do so.  Please do so now.\n\nQuestion: Can you explain what is revelation and how one can\nexperience and interpret it without using senses and inherent\nreasoning?\n\nHere is the context for the question:\n\n\n\nthen later...\n\n\nthen later...\n\n\nthen later...\n\n\n\n3.  You have stated that all claims to dispassionate analysis made by\na.a posters are unverifiable and fantastical.  I asked you to identify\none such claim that I have made.  You have failed to do so.  Please do\nso now.\n\nQuestion: Have I made any claims at all that are unverifiable and\nfantastical?  If so, please repeat them.\n\nHere is the context for the question:\n\n\n\nthen later...\n\n\n\n4.  First you dismissed claims by atheists that they became atheists as\na result of reason, then later you stated that if one accepted the\n"axioms" of reason that one couldn't help but become atheist.  I asked\nyou to explain the contradiction.  Your only response was a statement\nthat the question was incoherent, an opinion not shared by others that\nI have asked, be they atheist or theist.  You have failed to answer\nthe question.  Please do so now.\n\nQuestion: Do you retract your claim that a.a posters have not become\natheists as a result of reason, despite their testimony to that\neffect?  If you don't retract that claim, do you retract the\nsubsequent claim that acceptance of the axioms of reason inevitably\nresult in atheism?\n\nHere is the context for the question:\n\n[First quote]\n[Second quote]\n\n\n5.  First, you claimed that you would (probably) not answer these\nChallenges because they contained too much in the way of "included\ntext" from previous posts.  Later, you implied that you wouldn't\nrespond because I was putting words in your mouth.  Please clarify\nthis seeming contradiction.\n\nQuestion:  Do you prefer to respond to Challenges that include context\nfrom your own posts, or that I paraphrase your positions in order to\navoid "included text"?\n\nHere is the context for the question:\n\n\n\nthen later...\n\n\n\nAs usual, your responses are awaited with anticipation.\n\n--Dave Wood\n\n\np.s., For the record, below is a compilation of Charley's responses to\nthese challenges to date.\n\n3/18/93\n\n3/31/93 (#1)\n\n3/31/93 (#2)
The traditions of the church hold that all the "apostles" (meaning the 11\nsurviving disciples, Matthias, Barnabas and Paul) were martyred, except for\nJohn.  "Tradition" should be understood to read "early church writings other\nthan the bible and heteroorthodox scriptures".

No need to correct it, it stands as it is said.\n \n \n \n \nYou miss the point entirely. Things defined by contradictory language\ndo not exist. Though something existing might be meant, conclusions\ndrawn from the description are wrong, unless there is the possibility\nto find the described, and draw conclusions from direct knowledge of\nthe described then. Another possibility is to drop the contradictory\npart, but that implies that one can trust the concept as presented\nand that one has not got to doubt the source of it as well.\n \n \nNeither am I. But either things are directly sensed (which includes\nsome form of modelling, by the way) or they are used in modelling.\nUsing something contradictive in modelling is not approved of.\nWonder why?
I don't think there is really any question about which god the courts\nmean.

[deletia]\n\n\n      In the deletions somewhere, it mentioned something about chopping\noff of hands being a punishment for theft in Saudi Arabia. Assuming this\nis so (I wouldn't know), and assuming it is done by people fitting your\nrequirement for "muslim" (which I find highly likely), then would you\nplease try to convince Bobby Mozumder that muslims chop people's hands\noff?\n\n      Come back when you've succeeded.

[deletions]\n\nIf this is grounded firmly in Islam, as you claim, then you have just\nexposed Islam as the grounds for terrorism, plain and simple.\n\nWhether you like it or not, whether Rushdie acted like a total jerk or\nnot, there is no acceptable civilized basis for putting someone in fear\nof their life for words.\n\nIt simply does not matter whether his underlying motive was to find the\nworst possible way he could to insult Muslims and their beliefs, got that?\nYou do not threaten the life of someone for words - when you do, you\nquite simply admit the backruptcy of your position.  If you support\nthreatening the life of someone for words, you are not yet civilized.\n\nThis is exactly where I, and many of the people I know, have to depart\nfrom respecting the religions of others.  When those beliefs allow and\nencourage (by interpretation) the killing of non-physical opposition.\n\nYou, or I or anyone, are more than privledged to believe that someone,\nwhether it be Rushdie or Bush or Hussien or whover, is beyond the pale\nof civilized society and you can condemn his/her soul, refuse to allow\nany members of your association to interact with him/her, _peacably_\ndemonstrate to try to convince others to disassociate themselves from\nthe "miscreants", or whatever, short of physical force.\n\nBut once you physically threaten, or support physical threats, you get\nmuch closer to your earlier comparison of rape - with YOU as the rapist\nwho whines "She asked for it, look how she was dressed".\n\nBlaming the victim when you are unable to be civilized doesn't fly.\n\nDew
I apologize for the long delay in getting a response to this posted.\nI've been working reduced hours the past couple of weeks because I had\na son born (the day after Umar's article was posted, btw).  I did\nrespond within a couple of days, but it turns out that a a\ncoincidental news software rearrangement caused postings from this\nsite to silently disappear rather than going out into the world.  This\nis a revision of that original response.\n\n\n[this was in response to the claim that "Rushdie made false statements\nabout the life of Mohammed", with the disclaimer "(fiction, I know,\nbut where is the line between fact and fiction?) - I stand by this\ndistinction between fiction and "false statements"]\n\n\nI had not seen that claim, or I might have been less sweeping.  You\nhave made what I consider factual misstatements about events in the\nbook, which I have raised in the past, in the "ISLAM: a clearer view"\nthread as well as the root of the "Yet more Rushdie [Re: ISLAMIC LAW]"\nthread.  My statement was not that you had not read the book, but that\nyou had not convinced me that you [inter alia] had.  As I said before,\nif you want to defend your position, then produce evidence, and\nrespond to the evidence I have posted; so far you have not.  Of\ncourse, my statement was not directly aimed at you, but broadly at a\nnumber of Muslim posters who have repeated propaganda about the book,\nindicating that they haven't read it, and narrowly at Gregg Jaeger,\nwho subsequently admitted that he hadn't in fact read the book,\nvindicating my skepticism in at least that one case.\n\nSo far, the only things I have to go on regarding your own case are a)\nthe statements you made concerning the book in the "a clearer view"\nposting, which I have challenged (not interpretation, but statements\nof fact, for instance "Rushdie depicts the women of the most\nrespected family in all of Islam as whores"), and b) your claim (which\nI had not seen before this) that you have indeed read it cover to\ncover.  I am willing to try to resolve this down to a disagreement on\ncritical interpretation, but you'll have to support your end, by\nresponding to my criticism.  I have no doubt as to the ability of a\nparticular Muslim to go through this book with a highlighter finding\npassages to take personal offense at, but you have upheld the view\nthat "TSV *is* intended as an attack on Islam and upon Muslims".  This\nview must be defended by more than mere assertion, if you want anyone\nto take it seriously.\n\n\nAnd I appreciate it, but welcome to the club.  I am defending my\nhonest opinion that this book should not be construed as a calculated\n(or otherwise) insulting attack on Islam, and the parallel opinion\nthat most of the criticism of the book I have seen is baseless\npropaganda.  I have supported my statements and critical\ninterpretationa with in-context quotes from the book and Rushdie's\nessays, which is more than my correspondents have done.  Of course,\nyou are more than welcome to do so.
Ideologies also split, giving more to disagree upon, and may also lead\nto intolerance.  So do you also oppose all ideologies?\n\nI don't think your argument is an argument against religion at all, but\njust points out the weaknesses of human nature.\n\n\nI would like a reference if you have got one, for this is news to me.\n\n\nOne must approach the Qur'an with intelligence.  Any thinking approach\nto the Qur'an cannot but interpret the above verse and others like it\nthat women and men are spiritual equals.\n\nI think that the above verse does clearly imply that women have\nsouls.  Does it make any sense for something without a soul to be\nforgiven?  Or to have a great reward (understood to be in the\nafter-life)?  I think the usual answer would be no -- in which case, the\npart saying "For them has God prepared forgiveness and a great reward"\nsays they have souls.  \n\n(If it makes sense to say that things without souls can be forgiven, then \nI have no idea _what_ a soul is.)\n\nAs for your saying that the quote above may not be given a high priority\nin all interpretations, any thinking approach to the Qur'an has to give\nall verses of the Qur'an equal priority.  That is because, according to\nMuslim belief, the _whole_ Qur'an is the revelation of God -- in fact,\ndenying the truth of any part of the Qur'an is sufficient to be\nconsidered a disbeliever in Islam.\n\n\nLook, any approach to the Qur'an must be done with intelligence and\nthought.  It is in this fashion that one can try to understand the\nQuran's message.  In a book of finite length, it cannot explicitly\nanswer every question you want to put to it, but through its teachings\nit can guide you.  I think, however, that women are the spiritual equals\nof men is clearly and unambiguously implied in the above verse, and that\nsince women can clearly be "forgiven" and "rewarded" they _must_ have\nsouls (from the above verse).\n\nLet's try to understand what the Qur'an is trying to teach, rather than\ntry to see how many ways it can be misinterpreted by ignoring this\npassage or that passage.  The misinterpretations of the Qur'an based on\nignoring this verse or that verse are infinite, but the interpretations \nfully consistent are more limited.  Let's try to discuss these\ninterpretations consistent with the text rather than how people can\nignore this bit or that bit, for that is just showing how people can try\nto twist Islam for their own ends -- something I do not deny -- but\nprovides no reflection on the true teachings of Islam whatsoever.

A new alternative to Scouting for those "unacceptable to BSA" for reasons\nof religious or sexual preference:\n\n\nFrom: "BOYD R. CRITZ, III" <71611.365@CompuServe.COM>\nSubject: EnviroLeague\n\n"Birth Announcement" on March 7, 1993, from EARTH Forum, CompuServe\n                       Information Service\n===================================================================\n \n                     FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT\n                     -------------------\n \n                                     (SM)\n                        EnviroLeague\n \nA new youth movement,"EnviroLeague," was recently born, according to its\nfounder, Boyd R. Critz, III (CIS ID# 71611,365), of Peoria, Illinois.\nEnviroLeague exists for the education of youth, both male and female, in\nmatters concerning their values related to and responsibility for our\nenvironment.\n \nIncorporated as an Illinois not-for-profit corporation, its Articles and\ninitial applications for a service mark have now been filed.  According to\nCritz, its draft Bylaws contain the following statement of Mission and\nObjectives:\n \n                           MISSION\n \n   It is the Mission of EnviroLeague and its adult members\n   to foster and implement the improved education of young\n   people in the need to conduct their lives as Stewards\n   of The Earth, to leave The Earth in a better condition\n   than they found it, and to otherwise act as responsible,\n   moral and ethical users of their environment.  To pursue\n   the accomplishment of this Mission, EnviroLeague shall\n   seek to serve as a catalyst, focusing in common cause the\n   separate efforts of all groups desiring the preservation,\n   improvement, and responsible use of the environment in\n   which we must all live.\n \n                         OBJECTIVES\n \n   In pursuit of the Mission of EnviroLeague, its primary\n   objectives shall be:\n       (1)  To establish a Movement involving as many\n            environmentally concerned organizations as\n            possible, said Movement having as its primary\n            focus the education and participatory\n            involvement of young people in appropriate areas\n            of environmental concern;\n       (2)  To develop and provide to such organizations and\n            their branches a full complement of program\n            materials for their use, including suitable\n            uniforms, insignia and other badges, written\n            ideas, syllabi and information, literature and\n            other items as shall seem appropriate and\n            desirable;\n       (3)  To serve as a "clearing house" for the exchange\n            of program ideas, materials and information\n            among said organizations;  and\n       (4)  To assist environmentally concerned\n            organizations to recruit and train the necessary\n            adult leadership for their youth programs.\n \nEnviroLeague will operate through three "Program Divisions" serving youth in\nthe elementary, middle and high school grades, respectively.  Service shall be\nthrough formation of "EnviroLeague Teams," either by EnviroLeague itself or by\nenvironmentally conscious organizations (or their local branches) wishing a\ncharter to use programs developed by EnviroLeague.\n \nEnviroLeague, as it develops, will be controlled by the actual adult leaders\nof each local Team, and will have no nationally imposed obstacles to\nmembership or adult leadership status not based upon relevant improper\nconduct. Organizations accepting a charter may, however, impose certain\nadditional standards for their own use of the program material.  Should such\norganizations do so, EnviroLeague will commit itself to forming, as soon as\npossible, new nearby Teams having no such restrictions, particularly as to\nyouth membership.\n \nEnviroLeague will operate on the principle that youth will have much to\ncontribute to developing its programs.  Thus, the top youth leaders of its\nTeams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing any\nlocal administrative groups, and those for its high school youth may be\ninvolved in similar functions at the national level.\n \nProgram materials are in development at this time.  Copies of the "draft"\nportions of the Mentor's Manual (manual for adult leadership) will be in the\nEARTH Forum, Library 17. These files will be updated as development takes\nplace.\n \nCompuServe is particularly proud that EnviroLeague's founder chose this\nelectronic medium to make the first public announcement of its formation.\nThis announcement is being made simultaneously in both the OUTDOOR and EARTH\nForums.\n \nThe electronic home of EnviroLeague is in CompuServe's Earth Forum - GO\nEARTH - message and library areas 17, both named "EnviroLeague."\n============================================================================\n \nSubsequently, EnviroLeague's Initial Governance Council has held its first\nmeeting.  Boyd Critz was elected as the first EnviroLeague Chief Guardian\n(equivalent to Chairman of the Board or CEO).  He can be reached at home\n(309) 675-4483 in case of real need.  Also, mail can be addressed to:\n       EnviroLeague\n       P.O. Box 418\n       Peoria, IL  61651-0418\n \nThose interested in starting an EnviroLeague Team might just establish\ncontact, to receive a diskette (IBM DOS, ASCII) with initial information.\n--
frank@D012S658.uucp (Frank O'Dwyer) writes ...\n\nWhile I'll agree that these are generally held to be "good things", I\nquestion whether they come very close to being objective values.\nEspecially considering that at one time or another each has been\nviewed as being undesirable.  I doubt you could even come up with\nanything that could be said to be universally "good" or "bad".\n\nAnd when I referred to "the truth" I was using the term\nhypothetically, realizing full well that there may not even be such a\nthing.\n\n\nTrue enough.  But they cannot be said to be anything more than\npersonal morals.  One thing notably lacking in most extremists is any\nsense of _personal_ accountability - the justification for any\nsocially unacceptable behaviour is invariably some "higher authority"\n(aka, absolute moral truth).\n\n\nAn objective truth that says one cannot know the objective truth?\nInteresting notion.   :-)\n\nCertainly one can have as one's morals a belief that compromise is\ngood.  But to compromise on the absolute truth is not something most\npeople do very successfully.  I suppose one could hold compromise as\nbeing an absolute moral, but then what happens when someone else\ninsists on no compromise?  How do you compromise on compromising?\n\n\nAlmost invariably when considering the relative value of one thing\nover another, be it morals or consequences, people only consider those\naspects which justify a desired action or belief.  In justifying a\ncommitement to peace I might argue that it lets people live long &\nhealthy and peaceful lives.  While that much may well be true, it is\nincomplete in ignoring the benefits of war - killing off the most\nagressive member of society, trimming down the population, stimulating\nproduction.  The equation is always more complex than presented.\nTo characterize relative morals as merely following one's own\nconscience / desires is to unduly simplify it.
My argument is mainly a proposal of what I think is a plausible argument\nagainst extra-marital sex -- one which I personally believe has some\ntruth.  My main purpose for posting it here is to show that a\n_plausible_ argument can be made against extra-marital sex.  At this\nstage I am not saying that this particular viewpoint is proven or\nanything like that, just that it is plausible.  To try to convince you\nall of this particular point of view, I would probably have to do a lot\nof work researching what has been done in this field, etc., in order to\ngather further evidence, which I simply do not have time to do now.  \n\nAlso note that I said that I think extra-marital sex is "a prime cause"\n(in my opinion) of the generally greater levels of psychological\nproblems, especially depression, in Western societies.  I am not saying\nit is "the prime cause" or "the only cause", just "a prime cause" --\ni.e. one of the significant contributions to this trend.  I think when\nyou say you think my view is simplistic, you have forgotten this -- I\nadmit that there are probably other factors, but I do think that\nextra-marital sex (and, IMO, subsequent destabilization of the family)\nis a significant factor in the rise in psychological problems like\ndepression in Western society this century.
The amount of energy being spent on ONE LOUSY SYLLOGISM says volumes for the\ntrue position of reason in this group.
Humans have "gone somewhat beyond" what, exactly?    In one thread\nyou're telling us that natural morality is what animals do to\nsurvive, and in this thread you are claiming that an omniscient\nbeing can "definitely" say what is right and what is wrong.   So\nwhat does this omniscient being use for a criterion?   The long-\nterm survival of the human species, or what?\n\nHow does omniscient map into "definitely" being able to assign\n"right" and "wrong" to actions?\n\n\nWell, your "original premises" have a habit of changing over time,\nso perhaps you'd like to review it for us, and tell us what the\ndifference is between an omniscient being be able to assign "right"\nand "wrong" to actions, and telling us the result, is. \n\n\nI'm talking about the morality introduced by you, which was going to\nbe implemented by this omniscient being that can "definitely" assign\n"right" and "wrong" to actions.\n\nYou tell us what type of morality that is.

The first premise and the conclusion are not properly translated as identity\nstatements, since the "is" in those statements is the "is" of predication\nrather than of identity.  Instead, they should be translated using a\npredicate letter.  Using "g" to designate God and "j" to designate Jesus,\nand the predicate letter "E" for the property of being eternal, the\nfirst premise is Eg and the conclusion is Ej.\n    The second premise appears to contain an "is" of identity, in which\ncase it can be properly symbolized as j = g.  But your remark that "Jesus\nis a subset of God" suggests that strict identity is not desired here.\nIf, however, the first premise means that all members making up the set\nGod have the property of being eternal, the same conclusion follows.
I agree fully with the above statement and is *precisely* what I meant\nby my previous statements about Islam not being anarchist and the\nlaw not being _enforcible_ despite the _law_ being applicable. \n\n\n\n\nI disagree with this conclusion about the _applicability_ of the \nIslamic law to all muslims, wherever they may be. The above conclusion \ndoes not strictly follow from the foregoing, but only the conclusion \nthat the fatwa cannot be *enforced* according to Islamic law. However, \nI do agree that the punishment cannot be applied to Rushdie even *were*\nit well founded.\n\n\n\nCertainly putting a price on the head of Rushdie in Britain is a criminal \nact according to Islamic law. \n\n\n\nYes.
My turn to jump in! :)\n\n\nI think you mean circular, not recursive, but that is semantics.\nRecursiveness has no problems, it is just horribly inefficient (just ask\nany assembly programmer.)\n\n\nThe oft-quoted line that says people should be guaranteed life, liberty\nand the pursuit of happiness as inalienable rights, is a complete lie\nand deception, as the very authors of that line were in the process of\nproving.  Liberty is never free, it is always purchased at some cost, \nalmost always at the cost to another.  Whos liberty is more inalienable?\nSimilarly for right of life.  When one person must die if he is to save\nanother, or even a group of others, whos life is more inalienable?  \nThat leads into the classic question of the value of the death penalty, \nespecially for serial killers.  Whos life and liberty is more valuable,\nthe serial killer, or the victim?  According to that beautiful line,\nthose two rights should be completely inviolate, that is, noone should be\nable to remove them.  This _includes_ government.  Admittedly the serial\nkiller has restricted some people's life and/or liberty, but is not his\nown life/liberty inviolate also?  According to the declaration of independence,\nit is.\n\n\nOooh, I like that.  It means that killing an infant is not murder because\nit cannot be against its will.  Reason, an infant has no will as such.\n\nSimilarly for people who are brain dead (easier to see), in a coma, etc.\n\nAlso, under current law, accidental killing is still murder.  How will you\ninclude that?\n\n\nThe only real golden rule in life is, he who has the gold, makes the\nrules.  I.e. Might Makes Right.  That is survival.  Now what is wrong\nwith that?\n\n\nIf you mean the golden rule as I stated, yes, almost every system as\nimplemented has used that in reality.  Sorry, I don't deal as much in\nfiction, as I do in reality.  \n\n\nWELCOME TO OZLAND!!!!!!! :)\n\nWhat is NOT arbitrary?  If you can find some part of society, some societal\nrules, morals, etc. that are not arbitrary, please tell me.  I don't think\nthere are any.\n\nSounds like euphemisms to me.  The difference seems to be, that objective\nis some reasoning that I like, while arbitrary is some reasoning that\nI don't like OR don't understand.
Okay... I argued this thoroughly about 3-4 weeks ago.  Men and women are\ndifferent ... physically, physiologically, and psychologically.  Much\nrecent evidence for this statement is present in the book "Brainsex" by\nAnne Moir and David Jessel.  I recommend you find a copy and read it.\nTheir book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic\nand is well referenced. \n\nNow, if women and men are different in some ways, the law can only\nadequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are\ndifferent by also taking into account the ways in which men and women\nare different.  Maternity leave is an example of this -- it takes into\naccount that women get pregnant.  It does not give women the same rules\nit would give to men, because to treat women like it treats men in this\ninstance would be unjust.  This is just simply an obvious example of\nwhere men and women are intrinsically different!!!!!\n\nNow, people make the _naive_ argument that sexism = oppression.\nHowever, maternity leave is sexist because MEN DO NOT GET PREGNANT. \nMen do not have the same access to leave that women do (not to the same\nextent or degree), and therefore IT IS SEXIST.  No matter however much a\nman _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave, HE NEVER CAN.  And\ntherefore the law IS SEXIST.  No man can have access to maternity leave,\nNO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES TO GET PREGNANT.  I hope this is clear.\n\nMaternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just, because the\nsexism here just reflects the "sexism" of nature in making men and women\ndifferent.  There are many other differences between men and women which\nare far more subtle than pregnancy, and to find out more of these I\nrecommend you have a look at the book "Brainsex".\n\nYour point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious.\nIf men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically\nbecome women!  To have a womb and the other factors required for\npregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is --\nso your argument, when it is examined, is seen to be fallacious.  You\nare saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that \nwomen can have if they also become women -- which actually just supports\nmy statement that maternity leave is sexist.\n\n\nThere is no official priesthood in Islam -- much of this function is\ntaken by Islamic scholars.  There are female Islamic scholars and\nfemale Islamic scholars have always existed in Islam.  An example from\nearly Islamic history is the Prophet's widow, Aisha, who was recognized\nin her time and is recognized in our time as an Islamic scholar.\n\n\nYou have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religions, and\nI dispute it.  I could go on and on about women in Islam, etc., but I\nrecently reposted something here under the heading "Islam and Women" --\nif it is still at your news-site I suggest you read it.  It is reposted\nfrom soc.religion.islam, so if it has disappeared from alt.atheism it\nstill might be in soc.religion.islam (I forgot what its original title\nwas though).  I will email it to you if you like. \n\n\nYour statement that "other religions are no different" is, I think, a\nstatement based simply on lack of knowledge about religions other than\nChristianity and perhaps Judaism.\n\n\nAisha, who I mentioned earlier, was not only an Islamic scholar but also\nwas, at one stage, a military leader.\n\n\nThe Prophet's first wife, who died just before the "Hijra" (the\nProphet's journey from Mecca to Medina) was a successful businesswoman.\n\nLucio, you cannot make a strong case for your viewpoint when your\nviewpoint is based on ignorance about world religions.
I am not Mathew (Mantis) but any (successful) first year logic student will see that you are logically correct, the other poster is logically incorrect.

Even in a world of sadists who all rejected it, the\ncontention remains true, just as '5 + 7 = 12' remains correct even if\nthere is no one left to count.  The problem for the objectivist is to\ndetermine the status of moral truths and the method by which they can be\nestablished.  If we accept that such judgements are not reports of what\nis but only relate to what ought to be (see naturalistic fallacy) then\nthey cannot be proved by any facts about the nature of the world.  Nor\ncan they be analytic, since this would involve lack of action-guiding\ncontent;  'One ought always to do the right thing' is plainly true in\nvirtue of the vords involved but it is unhelpful as a practical guide to\naction (see analytic and synthetic).  At this point the objectivist may\ntalk of 'self-evident truths', but can he deny the subjectivist's claim\nthat self-evidence is in the mind of the beholder?  If not, what is left\nof the claim that some moral judgements are true?  THe subjectivist may\nwell feel that all that remains is that there are some moral judgements\nwith which he would wish to associate himself.  To hold a moral opinion\nis, he suggests, not to know something to be true but to have\npreferences regarding human activity."
Probably we would have much the same problems with only a slight shift in\nemphasis.  Weekends might not be so inviolate (more common to work 7 days\na week in a business), and instead of American Atheists, we would have\nsimilar, religious organizations.  A persons religious belief seems more\nas a crutch and justification for actions than a guide to determine actions.\nOf course, people would have to come up with more fascinating \nrationalizations for their actions, but that could be fun to watch...\n\nIt seems to me, that for most people, religion in America doesn't matter\nthat much.  You have extreemists on both ends, but a large majority don't\nmake too much of an issue about it as long as you don't.  Now, admittedly,\nI have never had to suffer the "Bible Belt", but I am just north of it\nand see the fringes, and the reasonable people in most things tend to be\nreasonable in religion as well.  \n\n\n\nI don't bother according a higher value to my thinking, or just about\nanybodys thinking.  I don't want to fall in that trap.  Because if you \ndo start that, then you are then to decide which is better, says whom,\nwhy, is there a best, and also what to do about those who have inferior\nmodes of thinking.

[ and I don't mean a male lover in a leotard! ]\n\nKeith, \n\nIf the issue is, "What is Truth" then the consequences of whatever\nproposition argued is irrelevent.

One book I have which presents a fairly unbiased account of many religions\nis called _Man's Religions_ by John B. Noss.  It was a textbook in a class\nI had on comparative religion or some such thing.  It has some decent\nbibliographies on each chapter as a jumping off point for further reading.\n\nIt doesn't "compare" religions directly but describes each one individually\nand notes a few similarities.  But nothing I have read in it could be even\nremotely described as preachy or Christian based.  In fact, Christianity\nmercifully consumes only 90 or so of its nearly 600 pages.  The book is\ndivided according to major regions of the world where the biggies began \n(India, East Asia, Near East).  There is nothing about New World religions\nfrom the Aztecs, Mayas, Incas, etc.  Just the stuff people kill each\nother over nowadays.  And a few of the older religions snuffed out along\nthe way.
...\n\nI think this is a big leap sex->depression.  One example is myself,\nwhere no sex->depression :)  But, seriously 1) promiscuity is on a decline,\ndepression is not and 2) it might be more reasonable to say \ndepression->promiscuity.  I think depression is more likely to come\nfrom emotional problems (relationships, family, job, friends) and\npromiscuity is used as an escape.\nSince I see marriage as a civil and religious bond rather than an\nemotional bond, I don't see a problem with sex before (not outside of)\nmarriage so long as you have the same commitment and devotion as\nwhat is expected from a married couple.  Of course, this is just \nmy opinion.
Yes, worshipping Jesus as the super-saver is indeed hero-worshipping\nof the grand scale.

This posts contains too many fallacies to respond too.\n\n	1) The abolishment of divinity requires the elimination of \nfreewill. \n\n	You have not shown this. You have not even attempted to.

Why are only those people in favor of the system to blame.  If society\naccepts such a system, then each member of society is to blame when\nan innocent person gets executed.  Those that are not in favor should\nwork to convince others.\n\nAnd, most members of our society have accepted the blame--they've considered\nthe risk to be acceptable.  Similarly, every person who drives must accept\nthe blame for fatal traffic accidents.  This is something that is surely\ngoing to happen when so many people are driving.  It is all a question of\nwhat risk is acceptable.  It is much more likely that an innocent person\nwill be killed driving than it is that one will be executed.
I wonder how many atheists out there care to speculate on the face of the world\nif atheists were the majority rather than the minority group of the population. \nIt is rather a ridiculous question in some ways, I know, but my newsreader is\ndown so I am not getting any new postings for a bit, so I figure I might as\nwell post something new myself.\n\nAlso, how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a\nhigher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking.  The\ntypical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the\nsame inherent motivation, so one is not, intrinsically, different from the\nother, qualitatively.  But then again a measuring stick must be drawn\nsomewhere, and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core,\nthan the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery; ie, how it\nexpresses its own selfishness.\n\nIdle thoughts...\n\n\nAdam
Sure nails can be cruel.  I'd imagine nails in your eyes would be\n*very* painful.  But, this does not imply that a painless death is\ncruel, which is what you are supposed to be trying to show.
Sure. Yes, I did. You see I don't think that rape and murder should\nbe dealt with lightly. You, being so interested in leniency for\nleniency's sake, apparently think that people should simply be\ntold the "did a _bad_ thing."\n\n\n\nMisjudgments should be avoided as much as possible.\nI suspect that it's pretty unlikely that, given my requirement\nof repeated offenses, that misjudgments are very likely.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReally? Care to give chapter and verse? We could discuss it.\n\n\n \n\nAgain, not all of the Orient follows the Qur'an. So you'll have to do\nbetter than that.\n\n\nSorry, you haven't "put out" enough.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\nThis is an argument for why _you_ don't like religions that suppress\nsex. A such it's an irrelevant argument.\n\nIf you'd like to generalize it to an objective statement then \nfine. My response is then: you have given no reason for your statement\nthat sex is not the business of religion (one of your "arguments").\n\nThe urge for sex in adolescents is not so strong that any overly strong\nmeasures are required to suppress it. If the urge to have sex is so\nstrong in an adult then that adult can make a commensurate effort to\nfind a marriage partner.

TRH> I hope you're not going to flame him.  Please give him the same coutesy you'\nTRH> ve given me.\n\nBut you have been courteous and therefore received courtesy in return.  This\nperson instead has posted one of the worst arguments I have ever seen\nmade from the pro-Christian people.  I've known several Jesuits who would\nlaugh in his face if he presented such an argument to them.\n\nLet's ignore the fact that it's not a true trilemma for the moment (nice\nword Maddi, original or is it a real word?) and concentrate on the\nliar, lunatic part.\n\nThe argument claims that no one would follow a liar, let alone thousands\nof people.  Look at L. Ron Hubbard.  Now, he was probably not all there,\nbut I think he was mostly a liar and a con-artist.  But look at how many\nthousands of people follow Dianetics and Scientology.  I think the \nBaker's and Swaggert along with several other televangelists lie all\nthe time, but look at the number of follower they have.\n\nAs for lunatics, the best example is Hitler.  He was obviously insane,\nhis advisors certainly thought so.  Yet he had a whole country entralled\nand came close to ruling all of Europe.  How many Germans gave their lives\nfor him?  To this day he has his followers.\n\nI'm just amazed that people still try to use this argument.  It's just\nso obviously *wrong*.

If so,\nwhy doesn't every crime carry a death penalty ? That would be effictive\nwouldn't it ???\n\n  The death penalty is a punishment, much like a $50 fine for speeding is\na punishment. Anyway, somebody with murder on the mind doesn't much care\nabout the consequences. I think another problem is that people dont think\nthey will get caught. If I wanted to kill another person, I wouldn't \ncare what the penalty was if I didn't think I would get caught.\n\n  If it was to be strictly a deterrent, it should have been more along \nthe lines of torture.

It amazes me that you have the audacity to say that human creation was not\nthe result of the natural process of evolution (but rather an "act of God")\nand then in the same post say that these other processes (volcanos et al.)\nare natural occurrences.  Who gave YOU the right to choose what things are\nnatural processes and what are direct acts of God?  How do you know that\nGod doesn't cause each and every natural disaster with a specific purpose\nin mind?  It would certainly go along with the sadistic nature I've seen in\nthe bible.\n\n\nAdam & Eve (TWO PEOPLE), even tho they had the honor (or so you christians\nclaim) of being the first two, definitely do NOT represent a majority in\nthe billions and trillions (probably more) of people that have come after\nthem.  Perhaps they were the majority then, but *I* (and YOU) weren't\naround to vote, and perhaps we might have voted differently about what to\ndo with that tree.  But your god never asked us.  He just assumes that if\nyou have two bad people then they ALL must be bad.  Hmm.  Sounds like the\nsame kind of false generalization that I see many of the theists posting\nhere resorting to.

[stuff deleted...]\n\nThat's like saying that, since mathematics includes no instructions on\nhow to act, it is evil.  Atheism is not a moral system, so why should\nit speak of instructions on how to act?  *Atheism is simply lack of\nbelief in God*.\n\n  Plenty of theists\n\nI think the argument that a particular theist system causes genocide\ncan be made more convincingly than an argument that atheism causes genocide.\nThis is because theist systems contain instructions on how to act,\nand one or more of these can be shown to cause genocide.  However, since\nthe atheist set of instructions is the null set, how can you show that\natheism causes genocide?\n--\nDavid Choweller (davec@silicon.csci.csusb.edu)\n\nThere are scores of thousands of human insects who are\nready at a moment's notice to reveal the Will of God on\nevery possible subject.          --George Bernard Shaw.
I'm not saying this at all - it requires no faith on my part to\nsay the car drives because I've seen it drive - I've done more\nthan at in fact - I've actually driven it. (now what does require\nsome faith is the belief that my senses give an accurate representation\nof what's out there....) But there is NO evidence - pro or con -\nfor the existence or non-existence of God (see what I have to\nsay below on this).\n\n\nSorry if I remain skeptical - I don't believe it's entirely a\nconclusion. That you have seen no evidence that there IS a God\nis correct - neither have I. But lack of evidence for the existence \nof something is in NO WAY evidence for the non-existence of something \n(the creationist have a similar mode of argumentation in which if they \ndisprove evolution the establish creation). You (personally) have never \nseen a neutrino before, but they exist. The "pink unicorn" analogy breaks\ndown and is rather naive. I have a scientific theory that explains the \nappearance of animal life - evolution. When I draw the conclusion that \n"pink unicorns" don't exist because I haven't seen them, this conclusion\nhas it's foundation in observation and theory. A "pink unicorn", if\nit did exist, would be qualitatively similar to other known entities.\nThat is to say, since there is good evidence that all life on earth has\nevolved from "more primitive" ancestors these pink unicorns would share \na common anscestory with horses and zebras and such. God, however,\nhas no such correspondence with anything (IMO). There is no physical\nframe work of observation to draw ANY conclusions FROM. \n\n\n\n\nI disagree with you profoundly on this. I haven't defined God as\nexistence - in fact, I haven't defined God. But this might be\ngetting off the subject - although if you think it's relevant\nwe can come back to it. \n\n\nYou are using wrong categories here - or perhaps you misunderstand\nwhat I'm saying. I'm making no argument what so ever and offering no\ndefinition so there is no fallacy. I'm not trying to convince you of\nanything. *I* Believe - and that rests upon Faith. And it is inappropriate\nto apply the category of logic in this realm (unless someone tells you\nthat they can logically prove God or that they have "evidence" or ...,\nthen the use of logic to disprove their claims if fine and necessary).\n\nBTW, an incomplete argument is not a fallacy - some things are not\nEVEN wrong. \n\n\nI don't follow you here. Certainly one can make observations of\nthings that they didn't know existed. I still maintain that one\ncannot use observation to infer that "God does not exist". Such\na positive assertion requires a leap.  \n\n\n\n\nOnce again you seem to completely misunderstand me. I have no\nEVIDENCE that "'god is' is meaningful" at ANY level. Maybe such\na response as you gave just comes naturally to you because so\nmany people try to run their own private conception of God down\nyour throat. I, however, am not doing this. I am arguing one, and\nonly one, thing - that to make a positive assertion about something\nfor which there can in principle be no evidence for or against\nrequires a leap - it requires faith. I am, as you would say, a\n"theist"; however, there is a form of atheism that I can respect -\nbut it must be founded upon honesty.

It's about time.  Why do atheists spend so much time paying attention\nto the bible, anyway?\n\nFace it, there are better things to do with your life!  I used to\nchuckle and snort over the silliness in that book and the absurdity\nof people believing in it as truth, etc.  Why do we spend so little\ntime on the Mayan religion, or the Native Americans?  Heck, the Native\nAmericans have signifigantly more interesting myths.  Also, what\nabout the Egyptians.\n\nI think we pay so much attention to Christianity because we accept\nit as a _religion_ and not a mythology, which I find more accurate.\n\n\nI try to be tolerant.

If you're talking about this intellectual engagement of revelation, well,\nit's obviously a risk one takes.\n\n\nI'm not an objectivist, so I'm not particularly impressed with problems of\nconceptualization.  The problem in this case is at least as bad as that of\ntrying to explain quantum mechanics and relativity in the terms of ordinary\nexperience.  One can get some rough understanding, but the language is, from\nthe perspective of ordinary phenomena, inconsistent, and from the\nperspective of what's being described, rather inexact (to be charitable).\n\nAn analogous situation (supposedly) obtains in metaphysics; the problem is\nthat the "better" descriptive language is not available.\n\n\nThis word "reliable" is essentially meaningless in the context-- unless you\ncan show how reliability can be determined.

Science is the process of modeling the real world based on commonly agreed\ninterpretations of our observations (perceptions).\n\n\nValues can also refer to meaning.  For example in computer science the\nvalue of 1 is TRUE, and 0 is FALSE.  Science is based on commonly agreed\nvalues (interpretation of observations), although science can result in a\nreinterpretation of these values.\n\n\nThe values underlaying science are not objective since they have never been\nfully agreed, and the change with time.  The values of Newtonian physic are\ncertainly different to those of Quantum Mechanics.

What do you think\n: ol' Joe will do if he finds she's been getting around?  So Mary comes up\n: with this ridiculous story about God making her pregnant.  \n: \n\n  Nice attempt Chris . . . verrry close.\n\n  You missed the conspiracy by 1 step. Joseph knew who knocked her up.\nHe couldn't let it be known that somebody ELSE got ol' Mary prego. That\nwouldn't do well for his popularity in the local circles. So what \nhappened is that she was feeling guilty, he was feeling embarrassed, and\nTHEY decided to improve both of their images on what could have otherwise\nbeen the downfall for both. Clever indeed. Come to think of it . . . I\nhave gained a new respect for the couple. Maybe Joseph and Mary should\nreceive all of the praise being paid to jesus.

I pointed out the secession movement in Aceh which has also been\nbrutally dealt with in the past by the Indonesian government.  The\nharshly with all secessionist movements.\nthe evidence, it appears to me that the Indonesian government has dealt\nvery harshly with all secession movements.\n\nI know that the head of the Indonesian armed forces for a very long time\nwas Benny Murdani -- a "Christian".  Indonesia has been heavy handed in\nEast Timor for a long time , even when Murdani was head of the armed\nforces.

Ah, now here is the core question. Let me suggest a scenario.\n\n We will grant that a God exists, and uses revelation to communicate\nwith humans. (Said revelation taking the form (paraphrased from your\nown words) 'This infinitely powerful deity grabs some poor schmuck,\nmakes him take dictation, and then hides away for a few hundred years'.)\n Now, there exists a human who has not personally experienced a\nrevelation. This person observes that not only do these revelations seem\nto contain elements that contradict rather strongly aspects of the\nobserved world (which is all this person has ever seen), but there are\nmany mutually contradictory claims of revelation.\n\n Now, based on this, can this person be blamed for concluding, absent\na personal revelation of their own, that there is almost certainly\nnothing to this 'revelation' thing?\n\n\n Absent this better language, and absent observations in support of the\nclaims of revelation, can one be blamed for doubting the whole thing?\n\n Here is what I am driving at: I have thought a long time about this. I\nhave come to the honest conclusion that if there is a deity, it is\nnothing like the ones proposed by any religion that I am familiar with.\n Now, if there does happen to be, say, a Christian God, will I be held\naccountable for such an honest mistake?\n\n Sincerely,\n\n Ray Ingles               ingles@engin.umich.edu
I disagree with these.  What society thinks should be irrelevant.  What the\nindividual decides is all that is important.\n\n\nI think this is fairly obvious\n\n\nGenerally by what they "feel" is right, which is the most idiotic policy I can\nthink of.\n\n\nBy thinking for ourselves.
Don't listen to this guy, he's just a crank.  At first, this business\nabout being the "one true god" was tolerated by the rest of us,\nbut now it has gotten completely out of hand.\n\nBesides, it really isn't so bad when people stop believing in you.\nIt's much more relaxing when mortals aren't always begging you for favors.
Define perfect then.\n \n \n \nTake your foot out of your mouth, I wondered about that already when I\nwas a Catholic Christian. The fact that the contradiction is unresolvable\nis one of the reasons why I am an atheist.\n \nBelieve me, I believed similar sentences for a long time. But that shows\nthe power of religion and not anything about its claims.\n \n \n \nIt follows from a definition of evil as ordinarily used. Letting evil\nhappen or allowing evil to take place, in this place even causing evil,\nis another evil.\n \n \n \nThe omniscient attribute of god will know what the creatures will do even\nbefore the omnipotent has created them. There is no choice left. All is known,\nthe course of events is fixed.\n \nNot even for the omniscient itself, to extend an argument by James Tims.\n \n \n \nAnd when I am not omnipotent, how can I have free will? You have said\nsomething about choices and the scenario gives them. Therefore we have\nwhat you define as free will.\n \nImagine the following. I can do good to other beings, but I cannot harm them.\nEasily implemented by making everyone appreciate being the object of good\ndeeds, but don't make them long for them, so they can not feel the absence\nof good as evil.\n \nBut whose case am I arguing? It is conceivable, so the omnipotent can do it.\nOr it would not be omnipotent. If you want logically consistent as well, you\nhave to give up the pet idea of an omnipotent first.\n \n(Deletion)\n \nThat the bible describes an omniscient and omnipotent god destroys\nthe credibility of the bible, nothing less.

Yesterday, I got the chance to hear Kurt Vonnegut speak at the\nUniversity of New Hampshire. Vonnegut succeeded Isaac Asimov as the \n(honorary?) head of the American Humanist Association. (Vonnegut is\nan atheist, and so was Asimov) Before Asimov's funeral, Vonnegut stood up\nand said about Asimov, "He's in heaven now," which ignited uproarious \nlaughter in the room. (from the people he was speaking to around the time\nof the funeral)\n\n	 "It's the funniest thing I could have possibly said\nto a room full of humanists," Vonnegut said at yesterday's lecture. \n\n         If Vonnegut comes to speak at your university, I highly recommend\ngoing to see him even if you've never read any of his novels. In my opinion,\nhe's the greatest living humorist. (greatest living humanist humorist as well)\n\n\n   Peace,

Sorry.   Wrong.    This is how banks got started in the first place.\nSooner or later your father and his pals will lend money to someone\nwho eventually goes broke, and then they will realise that they\nhavn't been managing risk very well.   Then they will ask themselves\nwhat it is that they need to quantify risk, and to persuade borrowers\nnot to take on greater loans than they can carry.    And since they\ndon't all want the worry of doing the calculations and handling the\nmoney, some of them will specialise in that.\n\nThen they'll reinvent interest, but like good Muslims, they'll call\nit something else.\n\n\nRiiiight.   That's why John Major opened a new government department\na couple of months ago to help to promote minority business.   Because\nthey can do it all themselves by lending one another cups of sugar.

Secular laws seem to value criminal life more than the victims life,\nIslam places the rights of society and every member in it above \nthe rights of the individual, this is what I call true human rights.\n\n\nAs a Muslim living in a non-Muslim land I am bound by the laws of the land\nI live in, but I do not disregard Islamic Law it still remains a part of my \nlife. If the laws of a land conflict with my religion to such an extent\nthat I am prevented from being allowed to practise my religion then I must \nleave the land. So in a way Islamic law does take precendence over secular law\nbut we are instructed to follow the laws of the land that we live in too.\n\nIn an Islamic state (one ruled by a Khaliphate) religions other than Islam\nare allowed to rule by their own religious laws provided they don't affect\nthe genral population and don't come into direct conflict with state \nlaws, Dhimmis (non-Muslim population) are exempt from most Islamic laws\non religion, such as fighting in a Jihad, giving Zakat (alms giving)\netc but are given the benefit of these two acts such as Military\nprotection and if they are poor they will receive Zakat.\n\n\nAfter the Fatwa didn't Rushdie re-affirm his faith in Islam, didn't\nhe go thru' a very public "conversion" to Islam?

#>So instead of calling it interest on deposits, you call it *returns on investements*\n#>and instead of calling loans you call it *investing in business* (that is in other words\n#>floating stocks in your company). \n#\n#No, interest is different from a return on an investment.  For one\n#thing, a return on an investment has greater risk, and not a set return\n#(i.e. the amount of money you make can go up or down, or you might even\n#lose money).

From what I read, the other fellow told Salameh how to put it together\nover the phone.  The bomb was supposedly some sort of sophisticated\ntype, so to put a (I assume complicated) sophisticated bomb together\nfrom instructions _over the phone_ (!) one must need some brains I would\nexpect.\n\n\n\nI read this in an article in "The Australian Muslim Times", the\nnewspaper (weekly) of the Australian Muslim community.  \n\nIf this is true, perhaps one of the Muslims based in North America (if\nthey see this posting) can elaborate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't deny this fact.\n\nThe thrust of my argument here is that \n\n(a) Salameh is, according to US law, innocent as he has not been found\nguilty in a court of law.  As his guilt has not been established, it is\nwrong for people to make postings based on this assumption.\n\n(b) Islam teaches us _not_ to harm innocents.  If Muslims -- who perhaps\nhave not realized that Islam teaches this -- perform such actions, it is\n_not_ _because_ of the teachings of Islam, but rather _in spite of_ and\n_in contradiction to_ the  teachings of Islam.  This is an important \ndistinction.\n\nI should clarify what Muslims usually mean when they say "Muslim".  In\ngeneral, anyone who calls themselves a "Muslim" and does not do or \noutwardly profess\nsomething in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of Islam\nis considered to be a Muslim.  Thus, one who might do things contrary to\nIslam (through ignorance, for example) does not suddenly _not_ become a\nMuslim.  If one knowingly transgresses Islamic teachings and essential\nprinciples, though, then one does leave Islam.\n\nThe term "Muslim" is to be contrasted with "Mu'min", which means "true\nbeliever".  However, whether a Muslim is in reality a Mu'min is\nsomething known only by God (and perhaps that person himself).  So you\nwill not find the term Mu'min used very much by Muslims in alt.atheism,\nbecause it is not known to anybody (except myself and God), whether I,\nfor example, am a "true believer" or not.  For example, I could just be\nputting on a show here, and in reality believe something opposite to\nwhat I write here, without anyone knowing.  Thus, when we say "Muslims"\nwe mean all those who outwardly profess to follow Islam, whether in\npractice they might, in ignorance, transgress Islamic teachings.  By\n"Muslim" we do not necessarily mean "Mu'min", or "true believer" in\nIslam.
Well, I've said that when an innocent person has been executed, this is\nobjectively a murder.  However, who is at blame is another question.\nIt seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions--\nrealizing the risks--is to blame.\n\n\nYes, but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing\nany raondom activity.  Presumably, you had not isolated yourself totally\nfrom the rest of society because of this.\n\n\nAnd I argue that our law system is a similar risk.  Perhaps an innocent\nperson will be punished someday, but we work to prevent this.  In fact,\nmany criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishment\nof innocents.\n\n\nBut, such accidents are to be totally expected, given the numner of vehicals\non the road.  Again, the blame is on society.\n\n\nYes, but the state is not at fault in such a case.  The state can only do\nso much to prevent false witnesses.\n\n\nOkay, so this is what you call murder.  But, the question is whether or not\nall such "murders" are wrong.  Are you saying that all taking of human life\nis wrong, no matter what the circumstances?\n\n\nBut, this is basically how it works.  Society accepts the risk that an\ninnocent person will be murdered by execution.  And, every member of\nsociety shares this blame.  And, most people's definitions of murder\ninclude some sort of malicious intent, which is not involved in an\nexecution, is it?\n\n\nMurder violates the golden rule.  Executions do not, because by allowing\nit at all, society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter who the\ninnocent victim is.\n\n\nReading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction\nwas moral or not.  But, in an objective system, only the absolute truth\nmatters, and the jury system is one method to approximate such a truth.  That\nis, twelve members must be convinced of a truth.\n\n\nBut then, if we read the minds of these people, we would know that the\nconviction was unfair.\n\n\nYes, while we could objectively determine the difference (if we knew all\npossible information), we can't always determine the difference in our\nflawed system.  I think that our system is almost as good as possible,\nbut it still isn't objectively perfect.  You see, it doesn't matter if\nwe *know* it is fair or not.  Objectively, it is either fair or it is not.\n\n\nBut what we know has no effect on an objective system.\n\n\nWhy are you so sure?\n\n\nWhy is *your* reality important?\n\n\nBut, we can assume that the system is fairly decent, at least most likely.\nAnd, you realize that the correctness of our system says nothing about a\ntotally ideal and objective system.\n\n\nWell, we can have an ideal system, but the working system can not be ideal.\nWe can only hope to create a system that is as close an approximation to\nthe ideal system as possible.\n\n\nYes, we all bear the responsibility.  Most people seem willing to do this.\n\n\nWe must realize the consequences of all our actions.  Why do you keep\nseparating the justice system from the pack?\n\n\nI don't think our country has an objective system, but I think such an\nobjective system can exist, in theory.  Without omniscience, an objective\nsystem is not possible in practice.
Reading newspapers to learn about this kind of stuff is not the best idea in\nthe world.  Newspaper reporters are notoriously ignorant on the subject of\nreligion, and are prone to exaggeration in the interests of having a "real"\nstory (that is, a bigger headline).\n\nLet's back up to 1935.  At this point, we have the Masoretic text, the\nvarious targums (translations/commentaries in aramaic, etc.), and the\nSeptuagint, the ancient greek translation.  The Masoretic text is the\nstandard Jewish text and essentially does not vary.  In some places it has\nobvious corruptions, all of which are copied faithfully from copy to copy.\nThese passages in the past were interpreted by reference to the targums and\nto the Septuagint.\n\nNow, the septuagint differs from the masoretic text in two particulars:\nfirst, it includes additional texts, and second, in some passages there are\nvariant readings from the masoretic text (in addition to "fixing"/predating\nthe various corrupted passages).  It must be emphasized that, to the best of\nmy knowledge, these variations are only signifcant to bible scholars, and\nhave little theological import.\n\nThe dead sea scroll materials add to this an ancient *copy* of almost all of\nIsaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other OT books.  There\nis also an abundance of other material, but as far as I know, there is no\nsign there of any hebrew antecdent to the apocrypha (the extra texts in the\nseptuagint).  As far as analysis has proceeded, there are also variations\nbetween the DSS texts and the masoretic versions.  These tend to reflect the\nseptuagint, where the latter isn't obviously in error.  Again, though, the\ndifferences (thus far) are not significant theologically.  There is this big\nexpectation that there are great theological surprises lurking in the\nmaterial, but so far this hasn't happened.\n\nThe DSS *are* important because there is almost no textual tradition in the\nOT, unlike for the NT.
If you were omniscient, you'd know who exactly did what, and with what\npurpose in mind.  Then, with a particular goal in mind, you sould be\nable to methodically judge whether or not this action was in accordance\nwith the general goal.\n\n\nIn an objective system, there are known goals.  Then, actions are judged\nas either being compatible with these goals, or not.  Simple.  The problem\nwith most systems in current practice is that the goals differ.  That is,\nthe goals of each society are different.\n\nNote that an objective system is not necessarily an inherent one.\n\n\nI've said it many, many times.\n\n\nWhich part do you have a problem with?\n\n\nBut, we can enslave the animals, right?  But just not kill them?  Or\nare you a vegetarian for health reasons?\n\n\nNo.  I fail to see how my *personal* views are relevant, anyway.\n\n\nOf course not.  It seems perfectly valid to kill members of other species\nfor food.  It might be nice, though, if the other animals were not made\nto suffer.  For instance, a cow in a field lives out its life just about\nthe same way it would in the wild.  They seem happy enough.  However,\nthe veal youngsters aren't treated very well.\n\n\nI don't know.  What is the goal of this particular system?  There is no\ninherent system.\n\n\nNope.  Again, it seems okay to kill other species for food.
How about this description: "An object that is, at one time, both a\nEuclidean square and a Euclidean circle"? I hold that no object satisfying\nthis description could exist. The description is inconsistent, and hence\ndescribes an object that could not exist.\n Now, suppose someone pointed to a bicycle, and said, "That object is,\nat one time, both a Euclidean square and a Euclidean circle." This does\nnot mean that the bicycle does not exist, it measn that the description\nwas incorrectly applied.\n \n The atheist says, "The descriptions of God that I have been presented with\nare contradictory, and hence describe something that cannot exist."\n Now, your position (so far as I can gather) is that God exists, but the\ndescriptions atheists have been presented with are simply bad descriptions\nof It.\n This is roughly analogous to someone who has never seen a bicycle, and,\nwhen they ask for a description from people who claim to have seen one,\nare told that it is a "Euclidean circle-square". Can they be blamed for\ndoubting rather strongly that this 'bicycle' exists at all?\n\n\n No kidding. :->\n\n Sincerely,\n\n Ray Ingles               ingles@engin.umich.edu

If one is a vegan (a vegetarian taht eats no animal products at at i.e eggs, \nmilk, cheese, etc., after about 3 years of a vegan diet, you need to start \ntaking B12 supplements because b12 is found only in animals.)

Gregg, I'm really sorry if having it pointed out that in practice\nthings aren't quite the wonderful utopia you folks seem to claim\nthem to be upsets you, but exactly who is being childish here is \nopen to question.\n\nBBCI was an example of an Islamically owned and operated bank -\nwhat will someone bet me they weren't "real" Islamic owners and\noperators? - and yet it actually turned out to be a long-running\nand quite ruthless operation to steal money from small and often\nquite naive depositors.\n\nAnd why did these naive depositors put their life savings into\nBCCI rather than the nasty interest-motivated western bank down\nthe street?

(WEBSTER:  myth:  "a traditional or legendary story...\n           ...a belief...whose truth is accepted uncritically.")\n\nHow does that qualify?\nIndeed, it's almost oxymoronic...a rather amusing instance.\nI've found that most atheists hold almost no atheist-views as\n"accepted uncritically," especially the few that are legend.\nMany are trying to explain basic truths, as myths do, but\nthey don't meet the other criterions.\nAlso...\n\n\nYou accuse him of referencing mythology, then you procede to\nlaunch your own xtian mythology.  (This time meeting all the\nrequirements of myth.)\n\n\nAh, but not everyone "knows" that god exists.  So you have\na fallacy.\n\n\nAnd that makes it true?  Holding with the Bible rules out controversy?\nRead the FAQ.  If you've read it, you missed something, so re-read.\n(Not a bad suggestion for anyone...I re-read it just before this.)\n\n\n...should I repeat what I wrote above for the sake of getting\nit across?  You may trust the Bible, but your trusting it doesn't\nmake it any more credible to me.\n\nIf the Bible says that everyone knows, that's clearly reason\nto doubt the Bible, because not everyone "knows" your alleged\ngod's alleged existance.\n\n\n1) No, they don't have to ignore the Bible.  The Bible is far\nfrom universally accepted.  The Bible is NOT a proof of god;\nit is only a proof that some people have thought that there\nwas a god.  (Or does it prove even that?  They might have been\nwriting it as series of fiction short-stories.  As in the\ncase of Dionetics.)  Assuming the writers believed it, the\nonly thing it could possibly prove is that they believed it.\nAnd that's ignoring the problem of whether or not all the\ninterpretations and Biblical-philosophers were correct.\n\n2) There are people who have truly never heard of the Bible.\n\n3) Again, read the FAQ.\n\n\nBzzt...wrong answer!\nGravity is directly THERE.  It doesn't stop exerting a direct and\nrationally undeniable influence if you ignore it.  God, on the\nother hand, doesn't generally show up in the supermarket, except\non the tabloids.  God doesn't exert a rationally undeniable influence.\nGravity is obvious; gods aren't.\n\n\nNo, human reason hasn't always come back to the existance of\n"God"; it has usually come back to the existance of "god".\nIn other words, it doesn't generally come back to the xtian\ngod, it comes back to whether there is any god.  And, in much\nof oriental philosophic history, it generally doesn't pop up as\nthe idea of a god so much as the question of what natural forces\nare and which ones are out there.  From a world-wide view,\nhuman nature just makes us wonder how the universe came to\nbe and/or what force(s) are currently in control.  A natural\ntendancy to believe in "God" only exists in religious wishful\nthinking.\n\n\nXtianity is no more reasonable than most other religions, and\nit's reasonableness certainly doesn't merit eminence.\nDivine justice...well, it only seems just to those who already\nbelieve in the divinity.\nFirst, not all atheists believe the same things about human\nnature. Second, whether most atheists are correct or not,\nYOU certainly are not correct on human nature.  You are, at\nthe least, basing your views on a completely eurocentric\napproach.  Try looking at the outside world as well when\nyou attempt to sum up all of humanity.
Sorry, Bill, I had to clear this up. There may be good evolutionary\narguments against homosexuality, but these don't qualify.\n\n[deletions]\n[deletions]\n\n Oh? I guess all those social insects (e.g. ants, bees, etc.) which\nhave one breeding queen and a whole passel of sterile workers are on\nthe way out, huh?\n \n\n I refer you to the bonobos, a species of primate as closeley related to\nhumans as chimpanzees (that is, very closely). They have sex all the\ntime, homosexual as well as heterosexual. When the group finds food, they\nhave sex. Before the go to sleep at night, they have sex. After they\nescape from or fight off prdators, they have sex. Sex serves a very important\nsocial function above and beyond reproduction in this species. A species\nclosely related to humans. There is some indication that sex performs\na social function in humans, as well, but even if not, this shows that\nsuch a function is not *impossible*.\n\n Sincerely,\n\n Ray Ingles               ingles@engin.umich.edu

That's very interesting.    I wonder, are women's reactions\nrecorded after a frustrating night with a man?   Is that\nconsidered to be important?
I heard he had asked the FBI to provide him with a word processor.  Does\nanyone know if Koresh has requested that it be WordPerfect5.0?  WP5.0 was\nwritten (and is owned) by Mormons, so the theological implications of\nrequesting (or refusing) WP5.0 are profound!

Sorry, I was, but I somehow have misplaced my diskette from the last \ncouple of months or so. However, thanks to the efforts of Bobby, it is being \nreplenished rather quickly!  \n\n	Here is a recent favorite:\n\n	--\n\n\n       "Satan and the Angels do not have freewill.  \n        They do what god tells them to do. "\n\n        S.N. Mozumder (snm6394@ultb.isc.rit.edu) \n\n\n--\n\n\n       "Satan and the Angels do not have freewill.  \n        They do what god tells them to do. "
[...]\n\nWait a minute, Doug.  I know you are better informed than that.  The US \nhas never invaded Nicaragua (as far as I know).  We liberated Grenada \nfrom the Cubans	to protect US citizens there and to prevent the completion \nof a strategic air strip.  Panama we invaded, true (twice this century).  \nVietnam?  We were invited in by the government of S. Vietnam.  (I guess \nwe "invaded" Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War, eh?)  Mexico?  We have \ninvaded Mexico 2 or 3 times, once this century, but there were no missiles \nfor anyone to shoot over here at that time.  Hawaii?  We liberated it from \nSpain.\n\nSo if you mean by the word "invaded" some sort of military action where\nwe cross someone's border, you are right 5 out of 6.  But normally\n"invaded" carries a connotation of attacking an autonomous nation.\n(If some nation "invades" the U.S. Virgin Islands, would they be\ninvading the Virgin Islands or the U.S.?)  So from this point of\nview, your score falls to 2 out of 6 (Mexico, Panama).\n\n[...]\n\nNo, it's someone who believes in "peace-at-all-costs".  In other words,\na person who would have supported giving Hitler not only Austria and\nCzechoslakia, but Poland too if it could have averted the War.  And one\nwho would allow Hitler to wipe all *all* Jews, slavs, and political \ndissidents in areas he controlled as long as he left the rest of us alone.\n\n"Is it supposed to be bad to be a peace-nik," you ask?  Well, it depends\non what your values are.  If you value life over liberty, peace over\nfreedom, then I guess not.  But if liberty and freedom mean more to you\nthan life itself; if you'd rather die fighting for liberty than live\nunder a tyrant's heel, then yes, it's "bad" to be a peace-nik.\n\nThe problem with most peace-niks it they consider those of us who are\nnot like them to be "bad" and "unconscionable".  I would not have any\nargument or problem with a peace-nik if they held to their ideals and\nstayed out of all conflicts or issues, especially those dealing with \nthe national defense.  But no, they are not willing to allow us to\nlegitimately hold a different point-of-view.  They militate and \nmany times resort to violence all in the name of peace.  (What rank\nhypocrisy!)  All to stop we "warmongers" who are willing to stand up \nand defend our freedoms against tyrants, and who realize that to do\nso requires a strong national defense.\n\nTime to get off the soapbox now.  :)\n\n[...]\n\nRegards,
Or he was just convinced by religious fantasies of the time that he was the\nMessiah, or he was just some rebel leader that an organisation of Jews built\ninto Godhood for the purpose off throwing of the yoke of Roman oppression,\nor.......\n\n\nAre the Moslem fanatics who strap bombs to their backs and driving into\nJewish embassies dying for the truth (hint: they think they are)? Were the\nNAZI soldiers in WWII dying for the truth? \n\nPeople die for lies all the time.\n\n\n\nWas Hitler a liar? How about Napoleon, Mussolini, Ronald Reagan? We spend\nmillions of dollars a year trying to find techniques to detect lying? So the\nanswer is no, they wouldn't be able to tell if he was a liar if he only lied\nabout some things.\n\n\nWhy do you think he healed people, because the Bible says so? But if God\ndoesn't exist (the other possibility) then the Bible is not divinely\ninspired and one can't use it as a piece of evidence, as it was written by\nunbiased observers.\n\n\nWere Hitler or Mussolini lunatics? How about Genghis Khan, Jim Jones...\nthere are thousands of examples through history of people being drawn to\nlunatics.\n\n\nSo we obviously cannot rule out liar or lunatic not to mention all the other\npossibilities not given in this triad.\n\n\nPossibly self-fulfilling prophecy (ie he was aware what he should do in\norder to fulfil these prophecies), possibly selective diting on behalf of\nthose keepers of the holy bible for a thousand years or so before the\ngeneral; public had access. possibly also that the text is written in such\nriddles (like Nostradamus) that anything that happens can be twisted to fit\nthe words of raving fictional 'prophecy'.\n\n             [stuff about how hard it is to be a christian deleted]\n\nI severely recommend you reconsider the reasons you are a christian, they\nare very unconvincing to an unbiased observer.
Then not murdering would have no moral significance, since there\nwould be nothing voluntary about it.\n\n\nYou are starting to get the point.

So that still leaves the door totally open for Khomeini, Hussein\net rest. They could still be considered true Muslims, and you can't\njudge them, because this is something between God and the person.\n\nYou have to apply your rule as well with atheists/agnostics, you\ndon't know their belief, this is something between them and God.\n\nSo why the hoopla about Khomeini not being a real Muslim, and the\nhoopla about atheists being not real human beings?\n\nCheers,\nKent
No it didn't.  The motto has been on various coins since the Civil War.\nIt was just required to be on *all* currency in the 50's.
Do you honestly hold to that tripe Charley? For a start there are enough\ncurrent versions of the Bible to make comparisons to show that what you write\nabove is utter garbage. Witness JW, Mormon, Catholic, Anglican, and Greek\nOrthodox Bibles. But to really convince you I'd have to take you to a good\nold library. In our local library we had a 1804 King James which I compared\nto a brand new, hot of God's tongue Good News Bible. Genesis was almost\nunrecognisable, many of the discrepencies between the four gospels had been\nedited from the Good News Bible. In fact the God of Good News was a much\nmore congenial fellow I must say. \n\nIf you like I'll get the 1804 King James out again and actually give you\nsome quotes. At least the headings haven't changed much.
Well, I've provided examples to show that the trend was general, and you\n(or others) have provided some counterexamples, mostly ones surrounding\nmating practices, etc.  I don't think that these few cases are enough to\ndisprove the general trend of natural morality.  And, again, the mating\npractices need to be reexamined...\n\n\nNo, but mating practices are a special case.  I'll have to think about it\nsome more.\n\n\nIndeed.  But, while the natural system is objective, all objective systems\nare not the natural one.  So, the terms can not be equated.  The natural\nsystem is a subset of the objective ones.\n\n\nI don't claim that homosexuality is immoral.  It isn't harmful, although\nit isn't helpful either (to the mating process).  And, when you say that\nhomosexuality is observed in the animal kingdom, don't you mean "bisexuality?"\n\n\nThis is standard jargon.  Read any textbook.  The "we" forms are used\nthroughout.\n\n\nThat's right.  The goals themselves aren't inherent.\n\n\nYou could, but such would contradict observations.\n\n\nBut a postulate is something that is generally (or always) found to be\ntrue.  I don't think your postulate would be valid.\n\n\nYes, and I think the goals of survival and happiness *do* work.  You think\nthey don't?  Or are they not good goals?
Archive-name: atheism/overview\nAlt-atheism-archive-name: overview\nLast-modified: 5 April 1993\nVersion: 1.2\n\n                                   Overview\n\nWelcome to alt.atheism and alt.atheism.moderated.\n\nThis is the first in a series of regular postings aimed at new readers of the\nnewsgroups.\n\nMany groups of a 'controversial' nature have noticed that new readers often\ncome up with the same questions, mis-statements or misconceptions and post\nthem to the net.  In addition, people often request information which has\nbeen posted time and time again.  In order to try and cut down on this, the\nalt.atheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following\ntitles:\n\n   1.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Overview for New Readers\n   2.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Introduction to Atheism\n   3.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n   4.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Constructing a Logical Argument\n   5.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Atheist Resources\n\nThis is article number 1.  Please read numbers 2 and 3 before posting.  The\nothers are entirely optional.\n\nIf you are new to Usenet, you may also find it helpful to read the newsgroup\nnews.announce.newusers.  The articles titled "A Primer on How to Work With\nthe Usenet Community", "Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Usenet"\nand "Hints on writing style for Usenet" are particularly relevant.  Questions\nconcerning how news works are best asked in news.newusers.questions.\n\nIf you are unable to find any of the articles listed above, see the "Finding\nStuff" section below.\n\n\n                                   Credits\n\nThese files could not have been written without the assistance of the many\nreaders of alt.atheism and alt.atheism.moderated.

Here are\nsome suggestions on what to do if you can't find them:\n\n1. Check the newsgroup alt.atheism.  Look for subject lines starting with\n   "Alt.Atheism FAQ:".\n\n2. Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.\n\n   If you don't find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn't set up\n   correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the\n   problem.\n\n3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].\n   Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you'll find the latest\n   versions of the FAQ files there.\n\n   FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you\n   need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to\n   mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\n\n      send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq\n\n   in the body.\n\n4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article\n   "Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup" carries a list of these\n   sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.\n\n5. If you don't have FTP, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu\n   consisting of the following lines:\n\n      send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/faq\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/logic\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/resources\n\n5. (Penultimate resort)  Send mail to mail-server@mantis.co.uk consisting of\n   the following lines:\n\n      send atheism/faq/faq.txt\n      send atheism/faq/logic.txt\n      send atheism/faq/intro.txt\n      send atheism/faq/resource.txt\n\n   and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files.\n   There's other stuff, too; interesting commands to try are "help" and\n   "send atheism/index".\n\n6. (Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the\n   newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this\n   if you've tried the above methods and they've failed; it's not nice to\n   clutter the newsgroup or people's mailboxes with requests for files.\n   it's better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!  For instance,\n   people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who don't have \n   FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files.

BCCI was motivated by the same motives as other\ninternational banks, with perhaps an emphasis on dealing with\noutlaws and the intelligence services of various governments.\n\n\nBack to childish propaganda again. You really ought to get a life\nrather than wasting bandwith on such empty typing. There are thousands\nof Islamic banks operating throughout the world which no-one ever hears\nabout. If you want to talk about corrupted banks we can talk about\nall the people who've been robbed by American banks.
The recent rise of nostalgia in this group, combined with the\n  incredible level of utter bullshit, has prompted me to comb\n  through my archives and pull out some of "The Best of Alt.Atheism"\n  for your reading pleasure.  I'll post a couple of these a day\n  unless group concensus demands that I stop, or I run out of good\n  material.\n\n  I haven't been particularly careful in the past about saving\n  attributions.  I think the following comes from John A. Johnson,\n  but someone correct me if I'm wrong.  This is probably the longest\n  of my entire collection.\n\n________________________________________________________\n\n\n                                  So that the\n                                  Prophecy be\n                                   Fulfilled\n\n                                     * * *\n\n       In considering the Christian religion, and judging it\naccording to its claims, it is important to look at its claims at\nfulfilling earlier Jewish prophecy.  The scribe Matthew is perhaps\nthe most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in\nthe career of Jesus of Nazareth.  As you will see, Matthew's main\nstrategy is to take various Old Testament passages, often not even\nabout the promised Messiah, and apply them to the circumstances in\nthe New Testament.  We must also bear in mind the question of the\nauthenticity of the accounts.  Since the gospels were written at\nleast 35 years after Jesus was executed, we do not know how much\nhappened exactly as stated.  But, for purposes of analysis, we\nwill take particular claims at face value.\n\nImmanuel:\n\n       We begin, of course, at the beginning.\n\n       (Mt 1.21-22):  "[Mary] will bear a son, and you,\n       Joseph, will name him 'Jesus' (which means G'd is\n       salvation), for he will save his people from their\n       sins."  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had\n       spoken by a prophet:\n\n       [Isaiah 7.1-16]:  In the days of Ahaz (c. 750 BCE),\n       king of Judah, Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made\n       war on Jerusalem (capitol of Judah), but could not\n       quite conquer it.  When the house of David (i.e. Ahaz\n       and his court in Judah) were told of this, ...its\n       heart and the heart of its people shook...   And, the\n       lord G'd said to Isaiah, "go to meet with Ahaz..." \n       ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah,\n       naturally) saying, "Ask a sign of G'd your lord.  It\n       can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven."  But,\n       Ahaz said, "I won't ask; I will not put the lord to a\n       test."  Then (Isaiah) said, "Hear then, O house of\n       David.  Is it not enough for you to weary men, that\n       you must weary my god too?  Therefore, the lord\n       himself will give you a sign:  Behold, a young woman\n       is with child and will bear a son, and name him\n       "Immanuel," which means, "G'd is with us."   He will\n       eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil\n       and choose good.  For, before the child knows how to\n       refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings\n       you dread will have been deserted...\n\nMatthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics. \nFurther, he the Hebrew word "almah," (young woman), as\nspecifically, "virgin."  But, this is not a prophecy about the\nMessiah.  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 years\nlater.  It is not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  In\nshort, it not about Jesus.  Matthew has made use of a verse out of\ncontext, and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  It\nshould be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general\nmanner, a very general one, it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary,\nvirgin or not, was indeed a young woman with child.  Of course,\nthe fit is shady and has problems.  Jesus, while thought of by\nlater Christians to be G'd walking among men, was never called by\nthe name, Immanuel.  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecy\nfor Jesus, it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a second\nclass prophecy.   Not too convincing.\n\nEgypt:\n\n       After Jesus's birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tells about a\nquick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion to Egypt, as if he\nwishes to liken Jesus to Moses.  This was done to escape an\nalleged infanticidal rampage of the king, Herod.\n\n       [Mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of\n       Herod.  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken:\n       "Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son."\n\n\nWhat the lord really said was this.\n\n       [Hosea 11.1]  When Israel was a child, I loved him. \n       And, out of Egypt I called my son.  The more I called\n       them (my people), the more they went from me; they\n       kept sacrificing to the Ba'als, and kept burning\n       incense to idols.\n\nMatthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea's oracle.  But, it\nwas indeed Israel that, once called out of Egypt, wanted to\nreturn.  This is history.  Jesus is certainly not being spoken of\nhere.  And, if we are to draw some kind of parallel here, we wind\nup with a Jesus that flees and resists G'd.   Again, this prophecy\nis just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped.\n\nRachel Weeps:\n\n        While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt, Matthew says that\nKing Herod sought to kill him, and thus ordered the executions of\nall young male children.  Matthew then writes,\n\n       [Mt 2.17-18]   By this, that which was spoken by the\n       prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:\n\n       "A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud\n       lamentation-- Rachel weeping for her children;\n       she refused to be consoled, because they were\n       no more."   \n\nThe reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15, referring to the\ncarrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon (of Assyria) in 722\nBCE.  Rachel, the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel, Ephraim,\nand Manasseh, is said to weep for her descendants who are "no\nmore."  It is metaphorical, of course, since Rachel lived and dies\nbefore the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile.\n       It is interesting to note that it was Leah, not Rachel, who\nwas the ancestor of the Judeans (the land where Jesus and\nBethlehem were).  If anyone should do weeping for her "children,"\nit is Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem is\nthat the legends have it that she was buried north of the city,\n"on the way to Ephrath, (Bethlehem)."\n       As for Herod and his infanticide, it is rather unlikely\nthat such an event actually occurred.  One never knows, but the\nevent is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible,\nnor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time. \nHerod was particularly unliked in his reign, and many far less\nevil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded.  This might be a\nprime example of how events were added to Jesus's life to enhance\nthe message of the church's gospel.\n       Because of the whole story's similarity to the tale of the\ninfant Moses in Egypt, it is highly likely that it is a device set\nup by Matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of Jesus.\nIt is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mention\nthe rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The "children" the prophet\nspeaks of are not dead, but exiled in the Assyrian Empire.  G'd\ncomforts the weeping Rachel, saying that the children will be\nreturned-- he will gather them back together.  Of course, this\nwould not suit Matthew's purpose, as the children he speaks of are\ndead for good.  Again, the "prophecy" Matthew sets up is not even\nthat, and to anyone who bothers to check it out, is not too\nconvincing.\n\nThe Nazarene:\n\n       We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find\nanother Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt, Joseph & wife\ntake the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth, \n\n       [Mt 2.23]  ...that what was spoken of by the prophets\n       might be fulfilled, "He shall be called a Nazarene."\n\nFirst thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name of\nthe prophet(s) this time.  Second, we have to ask who "He" is. \nThere are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene.  Worse,\nthere are no prophecies, period, mentioning a Nazarene.  Still\nworse, there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament at\nall.  In the book of Judges, an angel tells Samson's mother that\nshe will,\n\n       [Judges 13.5]  "...conceive and bear a son.  No razor\n       shall tough his head, for he will be a Nazirite to his\n       god from the day of his birth.  He will deliver Israel\n       from the hands of the Philistines."\n\nThis is of course not a prophecy of Jesus, or the messiah of G'd. \nBut, it is the best that can be found.  Obviously, Matthew has\nbegun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies, in that he is\nsimple making them up now.\n\nBearing our\nDiseases:\n\n       Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses\nand disabilities.\n\n       [Mt 8.17]   This was to fulfil what was spoken by the\n       prophet Isaiah, "He took our infirmities and bore our\n       diseases."\n\nAs expected, the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context,\nand a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme.  We have,\n\n       [Is 53.4]  Surely he, [the suffering servant], has\n       borne our sickness, and carried our pains.\n\nFrom a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah, we know that\nthe prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation\nof Israel, Jehovah's chosen servant and people.  He speaks to the\nIsraelites suffering in exile, in the voice of the gentile nations\nthat look upon it.  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewish\nidentity --an image of a chastised, yet cherished, Israel as the\ninstrument of the nations' salvation by G'd.\n      The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses which\nare the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and\ndiscipline.  They do not speak of a "servant" going around and\nhealing people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on the\nsicknesses and pains of the nations (and individual Jews).  Jesus,\nas we all know, did not take the diseases onto himself.  The\nverses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come, but\nrather something that had already happened.  While it is believed\nthat Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell, he did not bear\nthe illnesses he healed.  So, while someone might want to say\nthat, figuratively, Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in his\nspiritual atonement, he has to admit that Matthew's parallel\nmisses where he intended it to have its effect.\n\n\nSilent Messiah:\n\n      Upon healing multitudes of commoners, it is said that Jesus\nordered them to keep quiet, presumable so that he wouldn't arouse\nthe attention of the local rulers.\n\n       [Mt 12.15-21]  This was to fulfill what was spoken by\n       the prophet Isaiah.   \n\n       "Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved,\n       with whom my soul is pleased.  I will put my spirit on\n       him, and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.  He\n       will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear\n       his voice in the streets.  He will not break a bruised\n       reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings\n       justice to victory, and the gentiles will hope in his\n       name."\n\nThe Isaiah passage quoted reads,\n\n       [Is 42.1-4]  Behold my servant whom I uphold, my\n       chosen, in whom my soul delights.  I have put my\n       spirit on him, and he will bring forth justice to the\n       nations.  We will not cry or lift up his voice, or\n       make it heard in the street.  He will not break a\n       bruised reed, or quench a smoldering wick.  He will\n       faithfully bring forth justice.  He will not fail\n       (burn dimly) or be discouraged (bruised) until he has\n       established justice in the earth.  And the coastlands\n       await his law.\n\nYou see, Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage,\nbecause it does not suit the dealings of Jesus.  Christians could\nnever think of Jesus failing, never would the "light" of mankind\nburn dimly.  But, the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to\nan end when its job is done.  When the gentiles come to embrace\nG'd there will no longer be a chosen people, but rather all will\nbe the children of G'd.  Also, the ending phrase has been changed\nfrom the Judaic "...the coastlands await his law." to the\nChristologic, "the Gentiles will hope in his name."   While the\noriginal proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah, the other rewrites it\nto fit its strange doctrine of "believing in the name."  If one\nhas any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus, one has only\nto read the whole chapter, Isaiah 42, and hear about the beloved\nbut blind and imperfect servant, "a people robbed and\nplundered..."   So, we see that when Matthew's attempt at\n"prophecy" is examined, it crumbles.\n\nThree Days and\nThree Nights:\n\n      Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very\nmouth of the god Jesus himself.  He speaks of his crucifixion and\nresurrection.\n\n       [Mt 12.40]   For as Jonah was in the belly of the\n       whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son\n       of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and\n       three nights.\n\nBefore any further discussion can occur, it is necessary to know\nhow the Jews understood days.  As far as day names went, each was\n24 hours long, lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset\n6pm.  What was referred to as a "day" was the period of light from\n6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  Thus, according to our time\nscale, a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening, and lasted until\n6pm saturday evening.  This is why the Jews celebrate their\nsabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays, instead of Sundays. \n(It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn't forget that\nSaturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week!)  Thus,\nwhen days and nights are referred to together, 12 hour daylight\nportions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  Thus,\nJesus says that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwise\nunresurrected for three days and three nights.\n\n      As the good book tells us, Jesus was crucified on the "ninth\nhour," which is 3pm, Friday afternoon.  He then was put into the\ngrave sometime after that.  Then, Jesus left the grave, "rose,"\nbefore dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the sabbath was\nover).  What this means is that Jesus was, using our time for\nclarity, in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before\n6am Sunday morning.  We could also add a little time before 6pm\nFriday, since the bible is not specific here.  What this means\nusing Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day, two\nnights, and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  Certainly this\nis a problem for Jesus prediction.  There is absolutely no way we\nare even able to have his death involve three days and three\nnights --even using modern time measurements.   We then are led to\nsuspect that this error is another one of Matthew's little\nmistakes, and that the gospel writer put false words into his\ngod's mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction, it is more\nthan unconvincing... it is counter-convincing.\n\nHearing &\nUnderstanding:\n\n     Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in\nparables-- stories in which a deeper meaning could be found, if\nyou were already one of the elect, those chosen to understand the\nmessage of Jesus.  He reasons that those who can understand the\nparables are the ones he wants.  If the people cannot understand\nthem, there is no need to bother with them, since they will not\naccept the "plain" message any better.  Matthew says,\n\n       [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] indeed in\n       fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says, \n\n       "You will indeed hear but never understand; and you\n       will indeed see, but never perceive.  Because this\n       people's heart has grown dull, their ears are heavy of\n       hearing, and they have shut their eyes so the they\n       would not perceive with them, her with their ears, and\n       understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal\n       them."\n\nThe original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works, his\ncall to the ministry.  This is in 740 BCE, when Israel is\nflourishing, right before it falls under the authority of Assyria. \nIsaiah sees the good times ending, and also a vision from G'd,\ncalling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah.\n\n       [Is 6.9-13]  And G'd said, "Go, and say to this\n       people, `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and\n       see, but do not perceive.'   Make the heart of this\n       people fat, make their ears heavy, and shut their\n       eyes, so they will not see with their eyes, or hear\n       with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and\n       turn and be healed."  Then Isaiah said, "How long,\n       lord?"  And he said, "Until the cities lie waste\n       without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the\n       land is utterly desolate, and the G'ds take men far\n       away, and forsaken places are many in the land.  And\n       though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burned\n       again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still\n       stands when the tree is felled." The holy seed is its\n       stump.\n\nHere we see that it is really G'd who causes the people of Israel\nto stop listening to the prophet's warnings, but reaffirms the\npromise made to Solomon's (and David's) seed/lineage.  If you read\nthe rest of Isaiah, you find that this is done to fulfil the plan\nof G'd to use Israel as a servant, a light to the nations.  (Look\nat Isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3)\n     We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portion\nof Isaiah's verse, to suit his own gospel needs.  More than that,\nhe has altered the words, to make it fit the people who didn't\nunderstand Jesus's stories.  And, as we see, Isaiah's verses are\nnot prophecies, but rather commands from G'd to him, in the\npresent.   Once again, Matthew's prophecy falls flat on its face. \n\n     Matthew tries again to make Jesus's parables look like they\nhave the prophetic approval.\n\n       [Mt 13.35]  ...he said nothing to them without a\n       parable.  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the\n       prophet, "I will open my mouth to them in parables.  I\n       will utter that which has been hidden since the\n       foundation of the world."\n\nMatthew really botches up here.  He attempts to quote not from a\nprophet, but from the Psalms.\n\n       [Ps 78.2-4]  I will open my mouth in parable.  I will\n       utter dark sayings of old, things that we all have\n       heard and known, things that our fathers have told us. \n       We will not hide them from their children, but tell to\n       the coming generation the glorious deeds of the\n       lord...\n\nAs was pointed out, the verses in the Psalms do not really come\nfrom a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copies\nof Matthew's gospel even inserted Isaiah's name as this prophet. \nApparently, later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some\nof it up.\n     Perhaps the most significant part of this is that, once\nagain, Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures.  As Jesus\nhas said earlier, he speaks in parables so that some will not\nunderstand them.  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden. \nFurther, they speak of things "known, that our fathers have told\nus."  Jesus deals with things "hidden since the foundation of the\nworld."  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion. \nThis is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms.  No\nwonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And still once again,\nMatthew's artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  But,\nChristians rarely look at this.  Matthew's prophecies aren't the\nonly things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad.\n\n\nExcuses of\nLittle Faith:\n\n       In Mt. 17.14-21, we see that the disciples are able to go\naround casting out demons, except in one case.  Not knowing what\nepilepsy was, the people thought those with the disease were\npossesed with demons.  It is no wonder that the disciples were\nunable to "dispossess" the epileptic.  But, Jesus, perhaps no more\nenlightened than they, is reported to have rebuked them, saying\nthey didn't have enough faith.   This seems strange.  Why was this\ndemon special?  It seems that either a true believer has faith or\nhe does not.  Apparently, enough faith will allow someone to move\nmountains.  Of course, you will find no one, these days that can\nmove real mountains.  No one parts seas.  The only miracles the\nCharismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to\nMexico or some faraway place.  Major miracles are making some old\nwoman's arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T.V.\n\n       And the gods, including Jesus, are always shrouded in\nancient lore and writings, protected from the skeptics in their\nsacred pasts.  They are either dead, sleeping, or hiding in\nheaven, with people rumouring about their imminent return and\ntheir great miracles of days long gone.  Yet, life goes on.  \n\n     Tales of mystics, stories of miracles-- all in a distant time\nor a distant place.  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in the\nold days, Jehovah too.  But, now they are silent.  All the\ntheologians give are various excuses as to why we don't get to see\nGod anymore.\n\n       We're too lazy; we're not zealous enough; we're\n       sinful; it's just his "plan"; we put too many of our\n       own demands on G'd's appearance; if we had the right\n       faith, if we  were willing to meet G'd on his terms...\n\n     Yet, even the most pious of men have not seen G'd.  You, dear\nreader, have not seen G'd.  Not literally, you know that to be\ntrue. (I know that's presumptuous and bold.  But, searching your\nheart, you know what I mean.)  All that we've seen religions do is\nmake people feel good and content about not seeing G'd.  They say\nour little faith does not merit us to see G'd.  Sometimes, they\nsay, "See the love in these people you worship with... see the\nlives of people change... that is seeing G'd."   Thus people get\nlulled to sleep, satisfied with turning G'd into the everyday\nsights.   But, that is not seeing G'd as I am speaking of... it is\nnot seeing G'd the way people used to see.  \n      What we see in the world that is good, is the compassion of\nhuman hearts, the love given and taken by men and women, the\nforgiveness practised by Christian & Atheist alike, beauty created\nby the mind of man.  These are the things that are done; these are\nwhat we see.  But, it is said this is so only because everybody\nhas little faith.\n\nJesus Rides on\nan Ass:\n\n       Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiah\nking, Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into\nJerusalem.  \n\n       [Mt 21.5]  This took place to fulfil what was spoken\n       by the prophet, saying,\n\n       Tell the daughter of Zion, "Behold, your king is\n       coming to you, humble, mounted on an ass, and on a\n       ass-colt."\n\nOf course, the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a little\ndifferently.\n\n       Lo, your king comes to you; he is triumphant and\n       victorious, humble, and riding on an ass, on an ass-\n       colt... he will command peace to the nations.\n\nThere isn't all that much difference here, except that Zechariah\nonly involves one animal  --an ass-colt--  while Matthew reads the\npoetic wording slightly differently.  Thus, he has Jesus call for\nboth a colt and an adult ass.  From Matthew's version, we get a\ncomical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle two\ndonkeys.  This could inevitably lead to a theological,\nproctological dilemma!   We find that in the account written\nearlier by St. Mark, only the colt was called for and brought to\nJesus.  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly, and\nshows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses, he has\nbungled.  Now, excluding many respectable Christians I have met, I\nhave noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses,\nthe situation is often reversed nowadays...\n\n       Then, entering the Jerusalem temple, the priests were\nangered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah.  But,\nJesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done,\n\n       [Mt 21.16]  Haven't you read?  `Out of the mouth of\n       babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.'\n\nIt is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesus\nwas never one to point out such little "prophetic" things AND\nsince, as we might expect, the quote is in error, which seems to\nfit Matthew's track record quite well.  We might ask Jesus or\nMatthew, "Haven't you read?" for the source reads,\n\n       [Psalms 8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord, how majestic is\n       your name in the whole world!   You, whose glory is\n       chanted above the heavens by babes and infants, you\n       have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the\n       enemy and the avenger.\n\nThe passages hardly need comment.  There is no "perfect praise"\nspoken of in the psalm, and what praise is there is given to G'd,\nnot his messiah king, and not Jesus.  As mentioned, it seems to be\njust one more case of Matthew's pen making up convenient prophetic\nscripture.\n\nYHVH said to \nmy lord...:\n\n      Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewish\nmessiah-king is to be descended.  The Jews agree-- it is king\nDavid.  But, then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110,\n\n       "The LORD said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until\n       I put your enemies under your feet."\n\nTaken at face value, Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidic\ndescent.  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  Of\ncourse, the Christian answer is that he agrees, but is trying to\nmake some hidden point, to reveal some mystery about the divine\nnature of the messiah-king.  It's tempting to believe this, if one\nis a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation. \nBut, there are problems.\n       In Jesus's time, the psalm was thought to be about the\nmessiah.  And, it is easy to see why David might refer to the\nmessiah as his superior.  We need only look at the scriptures\nabout the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king,\nbringing the Jews to times even better than those under David's\nrule.  Of course, the Jews listening had no good answer, and the\npassage could indeed refer to a divine messiah, such as the\nChristians worship.  The problem lies in the meaning of this\npsalm, an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus's time had\nalso made.  One must remember that there were various factions\namong the Jews, often as a result of different expectations of the\nmessiah-king.  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists, like\nhis audience, who thought the messiah's advent was imminent, and\nwho interpreted Psalms 110, among others, as being messianic.\nWhat is the problem, then?  Psalm 110 literally reads,\n\n       YHVH's utterance to my lord:\n	"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your\n       footstool."\n\n       YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule\n       in the midst of your foes!  Your people will offer\n       themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the\n       holy mountains.  \n\n       "You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek\n       forever."\n\nThe word "lord" is often mistakenly capitalised by Christian\nbibles to denote divinity in this lord.  But, in the Hebrew, the\nword is "adoni," and no capitalisation exists.  Adoni simply means\n"lord," a generic term as we would use it.  It is used often in\nthe scriptures to refer to kings and to G'd.  It is merely an\naddress of respect.  \n      There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word\nrefers either to divinity or to the messiah-king.  That this is\nsupposed to be written by David is not certain.  The title of the\npsalm translates to either "a psalm of David," or "a psalm about\nDavid."  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court\npoet, about David's covenant and endorsement from G'd.  If the\npsalm had been written by David, it is unlikely that he would be\ntalking about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect king, descended\nfrom David, was not present in David's age.  We have extensive\ntales of David's doings and sayings-- none of which include any\npraises of a messiah.\n     Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after\nDavid was dead, in times of the exile when G'd had put his show of\nfavour for David's kingdom on hold.  \n     The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David was\npromised by G'd a rise to power, victory over his enemies,\nsuccessful judgement among the nations he conquered.  He achieved\nthe priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king,\nenabled to bless the people.   It all fits.\n      We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone,\nthough.  Here, there is not artificial prophecy alluded to, though\nhis use of the scripture is rather questionable.  Still, this\nevent is common to the other gospels too.  So, we let Matthew off\na little more easily this time.  It is interesting to note,\nthough, how Matthew dresses up the event.  The earlier gospel of\nMark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd. \nMatthew has the Pharisees, who became the religious competition of\nan infant Christianity, be the target of Jesus's question.  As we\nmight expect, Matthew writes that the event ends up by\nembarrassing the Pharisees.  Such power is the pen.\n\nMoses & Jesus,\nHad it Together\nAll Along...:\n\n       We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a\npseudo-prophecy in John's gospel.  The gospel story of John\ndeserves special treatment, because it seems to be so far removed\nfrom the real events of Jesus's career as told by even Matthew. \nBut, for the moment, we will just look at one verse.  The early\nchurch leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiah\nking, and on an artificial extension of the original promises made\nby G'd.  When constructing the history of Abraham, Moses wrote of\na promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While this\nwas accomplished eventually, under the rule of king David, the\nChristians who came along later decided that they would claim the\nfulfillment of the promise.  But, to do so, they expanded on the\npromise, preaching about a heavenly kingdom.\n\n       [John 8.56] (J.C. speaking) Your father, Abraham,\n       rejoiced to see My day.  He say it and was glad.\n\nIt would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham, but,\nAbraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah, or anything Christian. \nI have tried, and failed to find any event in the Old Testament\nwhich corresponds to John's little prophecy.  It is par for the\ncourse to see St. John making up Old Testament backings, just like\nhis forerunner Matthew.  Many Christians know that their faith has\nmany of its foundations in such fraud, and it is surprising they\nstill cling to it.\n\nThe Potter's\nField:\n\n      We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem by\none of his followers, Judas Iscariot.   Matthew writes,\n\n       [Mt 27.5-10]  And throwing down the pieces of silver\n       in the temple, [Judas] departed... But, the chief\n       priests, taking the silver, said, "It isn't lawful for\n       us to put it in the treasury, since it is blood\n       money."  So they... bought a potter's field with it to\n       bury strangers in... Then was fulfilled what was\n       spoken by the prophet Jeremiah,\n\n       "And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price\n       of him on whom a price had been set by some of the\n       sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter's\n       field, as the lord directed me."\n\nThis prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament\nScripture.  First, Matthew has made a mistake regarding the name\nof the prophet.  It is Zechariah who utters the verses which\nMatthew makes use of.\n\n       [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weighed out my wages,\n       thirty shekels of silver.  Then YHVH said to me, "Cast\n       them to the treasury," --the lordly price at which I\n       was paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekels of\n       silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of\n       YHVH.\n\nFirst of all, the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer\nof the messiah, or of G'd.  The deal with a shepherd, most likely\na priest, chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people\nshortly before G'd would send Judah and Israel into conflict with\none another.  The word, "treasury," had been replaced by the King\nJames Scholars with "to the potter," precisely because this made\nMatthew's quote fit better.  But, this is a blatant error.  The\ncorrect translation of the Hebrew is indeed "treasury," which also\nmakes perfect sense in Zechariah's context, whereas "potter's\nfield" is totally unrelated.  Whether the mistranslation was\nintentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  However, given\nMatthew's track record, one finds it hard to resist the notion of\nintentional dishonesty.\n      Of course, Matthew would have ample reason for altering the\ntext.  The thirty pieces of silver match Judas's situation, and if\nas most Christians seem to be, the reader is willing to disregard\nthe contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy to\ntoss around.  However, the correct translation of Zechariah\ndirectly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high\npriests.  The high priests would not put the money in the\ntreasury.  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly the\nopposite!  Of course, to the average Thursday-Night Bible student,\nthe "prophecy" as presented by Matthew would be taken at New\nTestament face value.  To those, Matthew's work is convincing\nenough.\n\nWine, Vinegar,\n& Casting Lots:\n\n      Then, Jesus is led away to be crucified.\n\n       [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink,\n       mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not\n       drink it.  And, when they had crucified him, they\n       divided his garments among them by casting lots: that\n       it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet,\n\n       "They parted my garments among them, and upon my\n       vesture did they cast lots."\n\nFirst of all, the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sour\nwine, of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly.  We find\nthat right before Jesus dies, the soldiers themselves give him\nsome to drink --not polluted with gall.\n\n       [Jn 19.28-30]  Jesus... said, "I thirst."  A bowl of\n       vinegar stood there, so they put a sponge full of the\n       vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  When he\n       had received the vinegar, he said, "It is finished;"\n\nBut, Matthew seems to be drawing on, not a passage from the\nprophets, but one from the Psalms.\n\n       [Ps 69.20-28]  I looked for pity, but there was none;\n       and for comforters, but I found none.  They gave me\n       poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and\n       for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add\n       to them punishment upon punishment, may they have no\n       acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the\n       Book of the Living.\n\nOf course, the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his request\nof drink.  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  The psalm\nquoted is about David and his political and military enemies.  It\nis not about the messiah or Jesus.  It is then not surprising that\nwe run into further problem when we see that the "Jesus" in the\npsalm asks G'd for the damnation of the "crucifiers," whereas the\nJesus of the gospels says,\n\n       [Lk 23.34]  Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, the\n       don't know what they do!"\n\nFurther, Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by\nhaving gall (a bitter substance) put into Jesus's drink, not his\nmeat, as the psalm stipulates.\n\n       With the "prophecy" of the vinegar faulty, we naturally\nask, "What of the casting of lots?"  This brings up the 22nd\nPsalm, which deserves discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now to\nsay that the fact that Jesus's clothes were divided as told is no\ngreat thing.  It turns out that this happened often to any felon\nin those days.  As we will soon see, it is perhaps the least\nerroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus.  It does\nindeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of\nJesus's clothes.  For a man so removed from worldly possessions,\nhis ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some\nsuspicions.\n\nThe 22nd Psalm:\n\n      This psalm is attributed to David, as a lament of his\ncondition under the attack of his enemies.  It becomes a song of\npraise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context, parts of it\nseem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  We\nwill examine the primary passages.\n\n       Verse 1-2:  My god, my god! why have you forsaken me?! \n       Why are you so far from helping me, far from the words\n       of my groaning?  Oh, my god, I cry by day, but you\n       don't answer, and by night, but find no rest.\n\nJesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross. \nThis suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus, rather\nthan king David.  Of course, the rest of the first stanza does not\nfit as nicely to Jesus or his execution.  Jesus is not pictured as\ncomplaining about the whole ordeal, he is supposed to be like "the\nlamb led mute before its shearers."  Indeed, Jesus doesn't do much\ngroaning, even when on the cross.  He certainly does not cry by\nboth day and night on the cross.\n\n       6-8:  But, I am a worm, and no man-- scorned by men... \n       All who see me mock at me.  They make faces and wag\n       their heads;  "He committed his cause to YHVH.  So let\n       him deliver him... for he delights in him."\n\nThis seems to fit Jesus's execution pretty well, with the\nexception of the Holy messiah being called a worm.\n\n       12-13:  Many bulls encompass me... they open their\n       mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.\n\n       16-18:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\n       evildoers encir-cle me, they have pierced my hands and\n       feet.  I can see all my bones... They divide my\n       garments among them, and cast lost for my raiment.\n\n       19-21:  But you, YHVH, be not far away!  ...Deliver my\n       soul from the sword, my life from the power of the\n       dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my\n       afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull!\n\nIt would seem quite convincing, and I'm sure the early Christian\nfathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunately,\nthis prophecy has a fatal flaw.  The words "have pierced" really\ndo not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation is,\n\n       16:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\n       evildoers encircles me, like the lion, they are at my\n       hands and feet...\n\nIn Hebrew the phrase "like the lion" and a very rare verb form\nwhich can mean "pierced" differ by one phonetic character.  The\nword in the Hebrew text is literally, "like the lion" (ka'ari),\nwhich makes sense in the context, and even further fits the animal\nimagery employed by the psalm writer.  It is convenience that\nwould urge a Christian to change the word to "ka'aru."   But, to\nadd the needed (yet artificial) weight to the "prophecy" this is\njust what the Christian translators have chosen to do.  While the\ncorrect translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to\nJesus, its absence does not say much for the honesty of the\ntranslators.\n\n       Apart from the erroneous verse 16, the psalm does not lend\nitself to Jesus so easily.  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer being\nsaved from a sword rather than a cross.  This naturally fits the\npsalm's true subject, king David.  As a side note, we now know\nthat crucifixions did not pierce the hands, the palms, but rather\nthe forearms.  This doesn't say much in favour of the traditional\nthought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars on\nhis palms.  But then, facts aren't bound by our religious beliefs.\n\n      Matthew escapes culpability this time, as he does not\nattempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord\nJesus.  But the psalm, like many others, was on the minds of all\nthe gospel writers when they compiled the stories and\ninterpretations of Jesus's life and death.  How much these\nscriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down\nis a question that has serious repercussions for Christian\ntheology.  It is easy to see, for those who are not faithful\nfundamentalists, how some of the events in the New Testament might\nhave been "enhanced" by scribes such as the eager Matthew.  But,\nit does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural\nmatters and prophetic claims.  So far, this has not said good\nthings for St. Matthew.\n\nThe reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus's\ncrucifixion.  John's gospel recount, written about 70 years after\nthe fact, tells us at Jesus's execution,\n\n       [Jn 19.34,37]  But one of the soldiers pierced his\n       side with a spear, and out came blood and water...\n       these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled...\n       "The will look on him whom they've pierced."\n\nOf course, this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of\ncontext.   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation of\nIsrael will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with\nthem.\n\n       [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah...\n       And on that day, I will seek to destroy the nations\n       that come against Jerusalem (in Judah).  And I will\n       pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on\n       Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have\n       pierced, they will mourn, and weep bitterly over him\n       like you weep over a firstborn child.\n\nJohn's attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that\nMatthew's attempts.  Matthew, at least, usually excontexts more\nthan just one passage.  John's errors are grossly obvious and\nblatant here.  It does not speak well for any of the gospel\nwriters, as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their\nreligion were founded.\n\n\nReckoned with\nTransgressors:\n\n       After his arrest, Jesus is quickly executed for claiming\nthe Jewish kingship, messiahship.   According to one version of\nthe gospel tale, Jesus gets executed along with two thieves.\n\n       [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucified two robbers,\n       one on his right, one on his left.  And so the\n       scripture was fulfilled which says,\n\n       "He was reckoned with the transgressors."\n\nHere, Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53,\nabout the servant nation of Israel.  The passage is not about the\nmessiah, for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53, and its\nsurrounding chapters, one sees that the servant is a nation.  The\nverses are also about what this servant has gone through in the\npast, not a prediction of what is to come, in any event.  The\nservant is thought of as a criminal.  This also happens to fit the\ndescription of Jesus.  Had the passage really been about the\nmessiah, it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus between\ntwo thieves would fulfill the "prophecy" in Isaiah.  Jesus would\nmore fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  He was\nconsidered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his\ncareer.   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to\nsteal prophecy, at least in this case, as we see that Mark could\nhave had made a better analogy with general comparisons.\n\n       Mark goes on to tell us how "those who were crucified with\n[Jesus] also reviled him." [15.32]  This is to be expected from a\ncouple of robbers.  Of course in his later recount, St. Luke\ndecides to change some things.  Luke tells us,\n\n       [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminals who was hanged\n       with him railed, "Aren't you the messiah?! Save\n       yourself, and us!"\n\nThis certainly fits with Mark's recount, which tells how the\npeople who crucified Jesus said, "Save yourself!" and that the\nrobbers did the same.  But then Luke goes on,\n\n       But the other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying,\n       "Don't you fear G'd, since you are under the same\n       sentence of condemnation?  And we, indeed justly so,\n       for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds. \n       But, this man has done nothing wrong. And he said,\n       "Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom." \n       And Jesus answered, "Verily I say to you, today you\n       will be with me in paradise."\n\nNow, this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  It stretches\nthe imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking\nhis fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a rather\nstrange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his\npunishment and the justness of his suffering.   Such a man,\napparently noble and of principle, doesn't seem likely to have\nbeen a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created by\nLuke.  Of course, Luke's recount also disagrees with Mark's.  \nLuke has only one criminal revile Jesus, not both.  It is easy\nenough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made\nup, but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free\nwords of G'd do not have this avenue open.  This is yet another\nexample of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage and\nexpand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  In this case,\nthe embroidery creates some embarrassing problems, as we have\nseen.\n\nThe End of the\nWorld--\n       Mt. 24:\n\n       Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and\nembarrassing passages in the New Testament.  It is found in all\nthree of the synoptic gospel stories, and casts some of the most\nunfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesus\nmentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings, and\nhis disciples ask him about this, and about the end of the world\nwhich he has been warning about.\n\n       The disciples: Tell us, when will this [the temple's\n       destruction] be, and what will be the sign of your\n       coming, and of the close of the age?\n\n       Jesus: Take care that no one leads you astray, for\n       many will come in my name, saying, "I am the christ."  \n       ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for\n       this must take place, but the end is not yet.   For,\n       nation will rise against nation... all this is but the\n       beginning of the birthpangs.\n             They will deliver you up... put you to death,\n       and false prophets will arise and lead many astray.\n       ...But he who endures to the end will be saved.  This\n       gospel will be preached throughout the whole world, a\n       testimony to the nations, and then the end will come.\n             So, when you see the desolation spoken of by the\n       prophet Daniel, ...let those who are in Judea flee to\n       the mountains.\n\n             Immediately after the tribulation of those days,\n       the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from\n       heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man\n       in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn,\n       and see the Son of Man coming... and he will send out\n       his angels... and gather his elect...\n             Learn the lesson of the fig tree: as soon as its\n       branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know\n       that summer is near.  So also, when you see all these\n       things, you will know that He is near, at the very\n       gate.  Truly I say to you, this generation will not\n       pass away until all these things take place...\n             But, of the day and hour, no one knows; not the\n       angels, not the Son, but only the Father... Therefore,\n       you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming\n       at an hour you do not expect.\n\nFrom this, it is clear that Jesus thought the world would in\nwithin the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  He tells\nthem that although he doesn't know the exact day or hour, that it\nwill come, and thus they must be ready.  Theologians have wet\ntheir pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error. \nBut, unfortunately, Jesus made himself to explicit.  He told his\ndisciples that their generation would still be around at the End,\nand that they in particular should prepare for it, prepare to be\nswept away.\n      There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant\nnature of the Bible, and said that the phrase, "this generation\nshall not pass away..." really means "this race of people will not\npass away..."  Of course, the word for generation is used many\ntimes to refer to exactly that, the generation of the disciples. \nIt is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek,\nhe didn't learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it is\nquite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples (at\nleast some of them) are supposed to live to the End of the World. \nThe charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking\nat the Apostles' responses.  It becomes abundantly clear from\nRev. 22.7, 1 Peter 4.7, 1 John 2.18, and Rev. 22.20, that Jesus\nmeant exactly what he said.  The End was very near.\n\n       For 2,000 years, Christians have rationalised this 24th\nchapter of Matthew, or ignored its meaning altogether.  For 2,000\nyears, they have waited for their executed leader to come back,\nhearing of wars, and rumours of wars, sure that He is coming soon. \nSurely He must be.  All we must do is wait.  Can you imagine how\ntired He must be, sitting around up there, being holy, waiting for\njust the right moment to spring?\n\n\n       So, shortly after his crucifixion, Jesus of Nazareth,\n(Joshua-ben-Joseph), died.   It is said that after three days, or\nthree days and three nights, or three periods of time, or three\neternal seconds --or three of whatever they can decide makes for\nless trouble-- he was seen again, resurrected, glowing with divine\nradiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wasn't in the best\ninterests of his new religion to stick around, and therefore\ndisappeared from sight into heaven.  So the story goes, anyway. \nAs has been seen, there were many things attributed to Jesus when\npeople got around to writing the gospel stories down.  To them,\nJesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We have\nseen, though, that this matter is quite shaky.  But, throughout\nChurch history, Christians have held fast to faith, in simple\nbelief.  What doctrinal objections could not be solved with\nargumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulness kept away\nfrom question.  To question and investigate has never been the\neasiest way to treat matters.  Thus for 2,000 years, the\nprophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largely\naccepted.  Things may well continue that way for some time. \nPausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianity\nhave been accepted and used (properly or improperly) to support\nwars and persecution, I suppose there is one prophecy of which\nChristianity can securely keep hold.

[...]\n\nNote that I _never_ said that depression and the destruction of the\nnuclear family is due _solely_ to extra-marital sex.

I think the problem here is that I pretty much ignored the part\nabout the Jews sightseeing for 2000 years, thinking instead that\nthe important part of what the original poster said was the bit\nabout killing Palestinians.  In retrospect, I can see how the\nsightseeing thing would be offensive to many.  I originally saw\nit just as poetic license, but it's understandable that others\nmight see it differently.  I still think that Ken came on a bit\nstrong though.  I also think that your advice to Masud Khan:\n\n  #Before you argue with someone like Mr Arromdee, it's a good idea to\n  #do a little homework, or at least think.\n\nwas unnecessary.\n\n\nThroughout all your articles in this thread there is the tacit\nassumption that the original poster was exhibiting casual\nanti-semitism.  If I agreed with that, then maybe your speech\non why this is bad might have been relevant.  But I think you're\nreading a lot into one flip sentence.  While probably not\ntrue in this case, too often the charge of anti-semitism gets\nthrown around in order to stifle legitimate criticism of the\nstate of Israel.\n\nAnyway, I'd rather be somewhere else, so I'm outta this thread.
There are definitely quite a few horrible deaths as the result of both\natheists AND theists.

I can think of a few (Hitler\nclaimed to be a Christian for example) but a more complete list would\nprobably be more effective in showing Bobby just how absurd his statement\nis.\n\n\nOn a side note, I notice you always sign your posts "Peace".

Oops, sorry, my words, not the words of the Qur'an.\n\n\nNote that "(the celestial bodies)" in the above verse is an\ninterpolation (which is why it is in brackets) -- it is the translator's \n(incorrect, IMHO) interpretation.\n\nHere is Maurice Bucaille's translation (he studied Arabic for his\nresearch into the Qur'an and science) of this verse:\n\n"(God is) the One Who created the night, the day, the sun and the moon.\nEach is travelling in an orbit with its own motion." (Qur'an :33)\n\nThe positive aspect of this verse noted by Dr. Maurice Bucaille is that\nwhile geocentrism was the commonly accepted notion at the time (and for\na long time afterwards), there is no notion of geocentrism in this verse\n(or anywhere in the Qur'an).
It is good to remember that every translation is to some extent an\ninterpretation, so (as you point out below) one must really go back to\nthe original Arabic.  Regarding the verses relevant to nature, I prefer\nto use Dr. Maurice Bucaille's translations (in his book, "The Bible, the\nQur'an and Science") for in general his translations are more literal.\n \nMaurice Bucaille translates the portion of the verse you are addressing\nas \n\n"...Each one is travelling with an orbit in its own motion."\n\n(Also note that "the celestial bodies" in the first translation quoted\nby you above is the translator's interpolation -- it is not existent in\nthe original Arabic, which is why it is included in brackets.) \n\n\nYou're right, what the verses _do_ contain isn't all that remarkable.\n\nHowever, Dr. Bucaille (a surgeon, that's how he's a "Dr.") thinks it is\nsignificant that the above verse contains no geocentric ideas, even\nthough geocentrism was all the rage up until the 17th century (?) or so.\n(And this goes for the rest of the Qur'an as well, which has about 750\nverses or so regarding nature, I think I remember reading once.)

[deletions...]\n\n\n\nFirst of all, infinity is a mathematical concept created by humans\nto explain certain things in a certain way. We don't know if it actually\napplies to reality, we don't know if anything in the world is infinite.\n\n\nYou don't know if the universe is actually continuous. Continuum is another\nmathematical concept (based on infinity) used to explain things in a certain\nway.\n\n\nI have a pretty good idea of what infinity is. It's a man-made concept, and\nlike many man-made concepts, it has evolved through time. Ancient Greeks had\na different understanding of it.\n\n\nPrecicely. We don't even know if infinity applies to reality.
Assuming you are presenting it accurately, I don't see how this argument\nreally leads to any firm conclusion.  The material in John (I'm not sure\nexactly what is referred to here, but I'll take for granted the similarity\nto the Matt./Luke "Q" material) IS different; hence, one could have almost\nany relationship between the two, right up to John getting it straight from\nJesus' mouth.\n\n\nThe version of the "usual theory" I have heard has Matthew and Luke\nindependently relying on Mark and "Q".  One would think that if Luke relied\non Matthew, we wouldn't have the grating inconsistencies in the geneologies,\nfor one thing.\n\n\nThis is the part that is particularly new to me.  If it were possible that\nyou could point me to a reference, I'd be grateful.\n\n\n\nBecause it closes up the gap between (supposed) writing and the existing\ncopy quit a bit.  The further away from the original, the more copies can be\nwritten, and therefore survival becomes more probable.\n\n\n\n\nI'm not really impressed with the "theology" argument.  But I'm really\npointing this out as an "if".  And as I pointed out earlier, one cannot make\nthese arguments about I Peter; I see no reason not to accept it as an\nauthentic letter.\n\n\n\nThe best analogy would be reporters talking to the participants, which is\nnot so bad.\n\n\nBut the statement of divinity is not in that section, and in any case, it's\nagreed that the most important epistles predate Mark.
Really>`?\n\n\nNo, gravity is an inherent system.  You don't need any excess information\nother than observations to determine anything.  It is possible to objectively\ndetermine someone's guilt or innocence within an non-inherent system.\nI agree that morality is not necessarily inherent (unless you state that\neverything we do has an evolutionary basis), but this does not mean that\nit cannot be objective in theory.\n\n\nPerhaps it can be objective, but not inherent.  Anyway, as I noted before,\nthe practices related to mating rituals, etc. among the animals are likely\nthe only ones to be considered "immoral" under the previous "definitions"\nof the natural law.  Therefore, some revisions are in order, since the\nclass of activities surrounding mating seem to pose some general problems.\n\n\nIt seens that you are objecting to the notion of an objective system\nbecause perhaps you think that it would imply inherence, which would\nnecessitate some sort of grand design?\n\n\nI think I have.  It is a code of ethics which basically defines undesired\nbehaviors, etc.  An immoral behavior could be unwanted, unproductive,\nor destructive, etc., depending on the goal of the system (that is,\nimmoral to what end?).
While religion certainly has some benefits in a combat situation, what are\nthe benefits of cocaine?
That's right, and this is pretty impossible, right?  It would be ideal if\nwe could believe for a while, just to try out religion, and only then\ndetermine which course of thought suits us best.  But again, this is not\npossible.  Not that religion warrants belief, but the belief carries with\nit some psychological benefits.  There are also some psychological\nburdens, too.\n\n\nWell, if there were some psychological or other benefits gained from racism,\nthey could only be fully understood or judged by persons actually "believing"\nin racism.  Of course, the parallel happens to be a poor one, but you\noriginated it.
I am not aware of any "Turkish Caliphate" viewpoint on this. Can you\nreference?\n\nHowever, I found a quote due to Imam Ali, whom the Shias follow:\n\n"Men, never obey your women in any way whatsoever. Never let them give their\nadvice on any matter whatsoever, even those of everyday life. Indeed, allow\nthem freely to give advice on anything and they will fritter away one's\nwealth and disobey the wishes of the owner of this wealth.\n  We see them without religion, when, alone, they are left to their own\ndevices; they are lacking in both pity and virtue when their carnal\ndesires are at stake. It is easy to enjoy them, but they cause great\nanxiety. The most virtious among them are libertines. But the most\ncorrupt are whores. Only those of them whom age has deprived of any\ncharm are untainted by vice. They have three qualities particular to\nmiscreants; they complain of being oppressed, whereas it is they\nwho oppress; they make oaths, whereas they are lying; they pretend\nto refuse men's solicitations, whereas they desire them most ardently.\nLet us beg the help of God to emerge victorious from their evil deeds.\nAnd preserve us in any case from their good ones."\n\n(Quote from Mas'ud al-Qanawi, ref. A. Bouhdiba, Sexuality in Islam, \np. 118).\n\nI wouldn't consider this quote as being exemplary of the Islamic (TM)\nviewpoint though.  For all we know, the prophet's cousin and\nthe Fourth Khalif Hazret-i Ali may have said this after a frustrating \nnight with a woman.\n\nSelim Guncer
(reference line trimmed)\n\n\n[...]\n\n\nYes.\n\n\nWell, for example, the goal of "natural" morality is the survival and\npropogation of the species.  Another example of a moral system is\npresented within the Declaration of Independence, which states that we\nshould be guaranteed life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  You see,\nto have a moral system, we must define the purpose of the system.  That is,\nwe shall be moral unto what end?\n\n\nWell, murder violates the golen rule, which is certainly a pillar of most\nevery moral system.  However, I am not assuming that our current system\nand the manner of its implementation are objectively moral.  I think that\nit is a very good approximation, but we can't be perfect.\n\n\nWell, "objective" would assume a system based on clear and fundamental\nconcepts, while "arbitary" implies no clear line of reasoning.
This is one of my favorite fallacious points against atheism, i.e. the \n belief that you can't deny anything that you can't prove doesn't exist.\n This is easily nailed by showing that an infinite number of beings are\n conceivable but not observed to exist, does this mean that we would have\n to believe in all of them?  According to the above poster, we must believe\n in objects or beings that haven't been proved not to exist so why stop at\n God?   (there could be a huge number of beings identical to Ronald Reagan\n except for trivial differences, say one is missing a finger, one has blond\n hair,... and they all live  on other planets so we can't see them)  The \n reason no one but atheists bring this up is that none of these christians\n have a vested interest in these unknown beings with the exception of God.\n\n\n How did they shoot themselves in the foot?\n\n\n  There is a big difference here, Stalin didn't say that he stood for a \n  particular moral position (i.e. against murder and terrorism, etc.) and\n  then did the opposite (like the religious movements), he was at least\n  an honest killer.  (This is NOT a support of Stalin but an attack on this\n  viewpoint).  Saying that atheism supports murder and violence just because\n  one man was a tyrant and an atheist is just bad logic, look at all the\n  russians that helped Stalin that weren't atheists - don't they contradict\n  your point?  Besides your point assumes that his atheism was relevant\n  to his murdering people, this is just the common assumption that atheists\n  can't value life as much as theists (which you didn't support).  \n\n\n Ah, and here's another point you didn't get out of the FAQ.  An atheist\n doesn't have to hold the positive view that god doesn't exist, he/she may\n just have the non-existence of the positive belief.  Here's the example:\n \n Strong atheism - "I believe god does not exist"   a positive belief\n\n Weak atheism   - "I don't believe in a god"       a negative belief\n \n these are NOT the same, some one that has never thought of the idea of\n god in their whole life is technically an atheist, but not the kind that\n you are calling unreasonable.  Or let's look at it this way (in sets)\n \n suppose that a given person has a huge set of ideas that I will represent\n as capital letters and these people then either believe that these ideas\n exist as real objects or not.  So if S = santa, then E(S)= no is the person\n not believing in santa but still having the idea of santa.  But notice that\n even E(S) = no  is itself another idea!  This means you have lots of cases:\n \n christian :  (A,E(A)=yes,B,E(B)=no,  . . . G,E(G)=yes......) where G = god\n \n atheist (strong) : (A,E(A). . . . .G,E(G)=no)\n \n atheist (weak) : (A,.....E)     i.e. no G at all in the set\n \n agnostic :  (A,.......G, E(G) = indeterminate, E', ....) \n\n\n\n Nietzsche once said that a man would rather will nonexistence than not\n  will at all but the darwinist way to put this is that humanity always \n  prefers no or yes to a maybe because indecision is not a useful survival\n  trait, evolution has drilled it in us to take positions, even false ones.
Seems he didn't understand anything about realities, liar, lunatic\nor the real thing is a very narrow view of the possibilities of Jesus\nmessage.\n\nSigh, it seems religion makes your mind/brain filter out anything\nthat does not fit into your personal scheme. \n\nSo anyone that thinks the possibilities with Jesus is bound to the\nclassical Lewis notion of 'liar, lunatic or saint' is indeed bound\nto become a Christian.\n\nCheers,\nKent
True.  At first, the news media seemed entranced by all the new gizmos\nthe military was using, not to mention the taped video transmissions from\nthe missiles as they zeroed in on their targets.  But later, and especially\nafter the bunker full of civilians was hit, they changed their tone.  It\nseemed to me that they didn't have the stomach for the reality of war,\nthat innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare.  It's like\nthey were only pro-Gulf-War as long as it was "nice and clean" (smart\nmissiles dropping in on military HQs), but not when pictures of dead,\ndying, and maimed civilians started cropping up.  What naive hypocrites!\n\n\n[ discussion about blanket-bombing and A-bombs deleted.]\n                            ^^^^^^^^^\n\nI should have said here "militarily justified".  It seems from your\ncomments below that you understood this as meaning "morally justified".\nI apologize.\n\n\nI have often wondered about this.  I've always thought that the first bomb\nshould have been dropped on Japan's island fortress of Truk.  A good,\ninpenatrable military target.  The second bomb could've been held back\nfor use on an industrial center if need be.  But I digress.\n\nYes, I have heard that we found evidence (after the war, BTW) that Japan\nwas seriously considering surrender after the first bomb.  Unfortunately,\nthe military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the US's\nulimatum.  Therefore the second bomb was dropped.  Most unfortunate, IMO.\n\n\nI don't regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made\nwhich affect the lives of innocent people.  But I do regret the \ncircumstances which make those decisions necessary, and I regret the\nsuffering caused by those decisions.  \n\n[...]\n\n\nActually, it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted US\nand allied action.  If some back-water country took over some other\nback-water country, we probably wouldn't intervene.  Not that we don't\ncare, but we can't be the world's policman.  Or if a coup had occured\nin Kuwait (instead of an invasion), then we still wouldn't have acted\nbecause there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to\nSaudi Arabia.  But the combination of the two, an unprovoked invasion\nby a genocidal tyrant AND the potential danger to the West's oil \ninterests, caused us to take action.\n\n\n[...]\n\nI'm not setting up a strawman at all.  If you want to argue against the\nwar, then the only logical alternative was to allow Hussein to keep\nKuwait.  Diplomatic alternatives, including sanctions, were ineffective.\n\nWell, in a sense, yes.  They probably had no idea of what end Hitler\nwould lead their nation to.\n\n\nThey suffered along with the rest.  Why does this bother you so much?\nThe world is full of evil, and circumstances are not perfect.  Many\ninnocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others.  It it regretable,\nbut that's The-Way-It-Is.  There are no perfect solutions.\n\n[...]\n\nProbably because we're not the saviors of the world.  We can't police each\nand every country that decides to self-destruct or invade another.  Nor\nare we in a strategic position to get relief to Tibet, East Timor, or\nsome other places.\n\nTell me how we could stop them and I'll support it.  I, for one, do not\nagree with the present US policy of "sucking up to them" as you put it.\nI agree that it is deplorable.\n\n\nAre they?  Or are they supposed to reflect the population of the locale\nwhere the trial is held?  (Normally this is where the crime is committed\nunless one party or the other can convince the judge a change of venue\nis in order.)  I'm not an expert on California law, or even US law, but\nit seems that this is the way the system is set up.  You can criticize\nthe system, but let's not have unfounded allegations of racial \nprejudice thrown around.\n\n\nNo, not at all.  The point is that the fact that there were no blacks\non the first jury and that Rodney King is black is totally irrelevant.\n\n\nGermans, perhaps.  "Peers" doesn't mean "those who do the same thing",\nlike having murderers judge murderers.  It means "having people from\nthe same station in life", presumably because they are in a better\nposition to understand the defendent's motivation(s).\n\n\nOK, granted.  However, you are using this reasoning as part of *your*\nlogical argument in this discussion.  This is not a court of law.\n\nThe media is not totally monolithic.  Even though there is a prevailing\nliberal bias, programs such as the MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour try to give\na balanced and fair reporting of the news.  There are even conservative\nsources out there if you know where to look.  (Hurrah for Rush!)\n\nBTW, I never used the word "conspiracy".  I don't accept (without *far*\nmore evidence) theories that there is some all-pervading liberal\nconspiracy attempting to take over all news sources.\n\n\nHardly.  I didn't say that it's a Good Thing [tm] to kill innocent people\nif the end is just.  Unfortunately, we don't live in a perfect world and\nthere are no perfect solutions.  If one is going to  resist tyranny, then\ninnocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die.  I didn't say\nit is OK -- it is unfortunate, but sometimes necessary.\n\n\nI would agree that it was evil in the sense that it caused much pain\nand suffering.  I'm not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say.  That\nconclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved.\nAnd perhaps it *was* unnecessary as (let's say) we now know.  That doesn't\nmean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didn't see it as\nbeing necessary.  Rarely can one have full known of the consequences of\nan action before making a decision.  At the time it may have seemed\nnecessary enough to go ahead with it.\n\nBut don't assume that I feel the bombing was *morally* justified -- I\ndon't!  I just don't condemn those who had to make a difficult\ndecision under difficult circumstances.\n\n\nYou certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist.\nI, as an absolutist, am in a position to judge, but I defer judgment.\n\n\nWrong.  They were neither moral then nor now.  They seemed necessary to\nthose making the decisions to bring a quick end to the war.  I simply\nrefuse to condemn them for their decision.\n\nOne day I will stand before Jesus and give account of every word and action;\neven this discourse in this forum.  I understand the full ramifications of\nthat, and I am prepared to do so.  I don't believe that you can make the\nsame claim.\n\n\nAnd BTW, the reason I brought up the blanket-bombing in Germany was\nbecause you were bemoaning the Iraqi civilian casualties as being \n"so deplorable".  Yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing\nwasn't accurate enough to hit industrial/military targets in a\ndecisive way by any other method at that time.  But in the Gulf War,\nprecision bombing was the norm.  So the point was, why make a big\nstink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted\n*in spite of* precision bombing, when so many more civilians\n(proportionately and quantitatively) died under the blanket bombing\nin WW2?  Even with precision bombing, mistakes happen and some\ncivilians suffer.  But less civilians suffered in this war than\nany other iany other in history!  Many Iraqi civilians went about their lives\nwith minimal interference from the allied air raids.  The stories\nof "hundreds of thousands" of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk.\nYes, bunk.  The US lost 230,000 servicemen in WW2 over four years\nand the majority of them were directly involved in fighting!  But \nwe are expected to swallow that "hundreds of thousands" of \n*civilian* Iraqis died in a war lasting about 2 months!  And with \nthe Allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that!  \nWhat hogwash.  If "hundreds of thousands" of Iraqi civilians died, \nit was due to actions Hussein took on his own people, not due to \nthe Allied bombing.\n\nRegards,

You know, it just occurred to me today that this whole Christian thing\ncan be blamed solely on Mary.\n\nSo, she's married to Joseph.  She gets knocked up.  What do you think\nol' Joe will do if he finds she's been getting around?  So Mary comes up\nwith this ridiculous story about God making her pregnant.  Actually, it\ncan't be all THAT ridiculous, considering the number of people that\nbelieve it.  Anyway, she never tells anyone the truth, and even tells\npoor little Jesus that he's hot shit, the Son of God.  Everyone else\ntells him this too, since they've bought Mary's story.  So, what does\nMary actually turn out to be?  An adultress and a liar, and the cause of\nmankind's greatest folly...\n\nJust my recently-minted two cents.\n\nChris
Yes, this is also my understanding of the majority of Islamic laws.\nHowever, I believe there are also certain legal rulings which, in all\nfive schools of law (4 sunni and 1 jaffari), can be levelled against\nmuslim or non-muslims, both within and outside dar-al-islam. I do\nnot know if apostasy (when accompanied by active, persistent, and\nopen hostility to Islam) falls into this category of the law. I do know\nthat\nhistorically, apostasy has very rarely been punished at all, let alone\nby the death penalty.\n\nMy understanding is that Khomeini's ruling was not based on the\nlaw of apostasy (alone). It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate\nlong before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no\nprecedent in the Qur'an, hadith, or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly\nlevelling death penalties for apostasy.\n\nI believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of "fasad". This\nruling applies both within and outside the domain of an\nIslamic state and it can be carried out by individuals. The reward was\nnot offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran.\n\n\nI would concur that the thrust of the fatwa (from what I remember) was\nlevelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication\nof the book. However, the charge of "fasad" can encompass a\nnumber of lesser charges. I remember that when diplomatic relations\nbroke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran stressed that\nthe condemnation of the author, and the removal of the book from\ncirculation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the\n"crisis". But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not\nthe main thrust behind the fatwa. Islamic charges such as fasad are\nlevelled at people, not books.\n\nThe Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the\nissuance of the fatwa. Rushdie went on a media blitz,\npresenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of\nsecular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people\ncrazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred. \nFanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost\nhis image and push the book, he was everywhere in the media. Then\nMuslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while\nprotesting against the book. Rushdie appeared momentarily\nconcerned, then climbed back on his media horse to once again\nattack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights. It was at this\npoint that the fatwa on "fasad" was issued.\n\nThe fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie - any actions of\nRushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of\nthe ruling. The book remains in circulation not by some independant\nwill of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers. The fatwa\nagainst the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well. The\ncrime was certainly a crime in progress (at many levels) and was being\nplayed out (and played up) in the the full view of the media.

[why do babies get diseases, etc.]\n\n Here's the (main) problem. The scenario you outline is reasonably \nconsistent, but all the evidence that I am familiar with not only does\nnot support it, but indicates something far different. The Earth, by\nlatest estimates, is about 4.6 billion years old, and has had life for\nabout 3.5 billion of those years. Humans have only been around for (at\nmost) about 200,000 years. But, the fossil evidence inidcates that life\nhas been changing and evolving, and, in fact, disease-ridden, long before\nthere were people. (Yes, there are fossils that show signs of disease...\nmostly bone disorders, of course, but there are some.) Heck, not just\nfossil evidence, but what we've been able to glean from genetic study shows\nthat disease has been around for a long, long time. If human sin was what\nbrought about disease (at least, indirectly, though necessarily) then\nhow could it exist before humans?\n\n[deletions]\n\n Uh... I know of many evolutionary biologists, who know more about\nbiology than you claim to, who will strongly disagree with this. There\nis no evidence that the human genetic code (or any other) 'started off'\nin perfect condition. It seems to adapt to its envionment, in a\ncollective sense. I'm really curious as to what you mean by 'the\ndegeneration of the genetic code'.\n\n\n Umm. Nah, we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses and\nbacteria, and they to us. Only a very small percentage of microlife is\nharmful to humans... and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby\nconstant in size, but the ranks keep changing. For example, bubonic\nplague used to be a really nasty disease, I'm sure you'll agree. But\nit still pops up from time to time, even today... and doesn't do as\nmuch damage. Part of that is because of better sanitation, but even\nwhen people get the disease, the symptoms tend to be less severe than in\nthe past. This seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible\ndied off long ago, and because the really nasty variants 'overgrazed',\n(forgive the poor terminology, I'm an engineer, not a doctor! :-> ) and\ndied off for lack of nearby hosts.\n I could be wrong on this, but from what I gather acne is only a few\nhundred years old, and used to be nastier, though no killer. It seems to\nbe getting less nasty w/age...\n\n\n Now, wait a minute. I have a question. Humans were created perfect, right?\nAnd, you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease. It\nseems unlikely that Satan, who's making the diseases, would also gift\nhumans with the means to fight them off. Simpler to make the diseases less\nlethal, if he wants survivors. As far as I can see, our immune systems,\nimperfect though they may (presently?) be, must have been built into us\nby God. I want to be clear on this: are you saying that God was planning\nahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by building an immune\nsystem that was not, at the time of design, necessary? That is, God made\nour immune systems ahead of time, knowing that Adam and Eve would sin and\ntheir descendents would need to fight off diseases?\n\n\n Here's another puzzle. What, exactly, do you mean by 'perfect' in the\nphrase, 'created... perfect and without flaw'? To my mind, a 'perfect'\nsystem would be incapable of degrading over time. A 'perfect' system\nthat will, without constant intervention, become imperfect is *not* a\nperfect system. At least, IMHO.\n Or is it that God did something like writing a masterpiece novel on a\nbunch of gum wrappers held together with Elmer's glue? That is, the\noriginal genetic 'instructions' were perfect, but were 'written' in\ninferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart?\nIf so, why could God not have used better materials?\n Was God *incapable* of creating a system that could maintain itself,\nof did It just choose not to?\n\n[deletions]\n\n My main point, as I said, was that there really isn't any evidence for\nthe explanation you give. (At least, that I'm aware of.) But, I couldn't\nhelp making a few nitpicks here and there. :->\n\nSincerely,
Of course, if you're planning to pull a Rushdie then declaring one's\nleaving the religion is little to be concerned about compared to one's\nother plans.\n\n\nIn Rushdie's case, the one under discussion, one can. It is tragic that\nin _some_ "Islamic" countries this is so. There are, however, Islamic\ncountries (whose constitutions contains statements that Islamic law is\nto be incorporated), e.g. Kuwait, where one can freely make such\nstatements without fear.\n\n\n\nThis story has become tiresome. The conditions are clear. If you care to\nmake your point clear then make a chronology and show that he had made\npublic statements about leaving Islam prior to his writing of _TSV_. If\nhe did make such statements then he should have made _that_ clear rather\nthan trying to rejoin Islam or go on talking about his personal\nfeelings.
If you force me to do something, am I morally responsible for it?\n\n\nWell, make up your mind.    Is it to be "instinctive not to murder"\nor not?\n\n\nIt's not even correct.    Animals of the same species do kill\none another.\n\n\nSigh.   I wonder how many times we have been round this loop.\n\nI think that instinctive bahaviour has no moral significance.\nI am quite prepared to believe that higher animals, such as\nprimates, have the beginnings of a moral sense, since they seem\nto exhibit self-awareness.\n\n\nSo what?     Are you trying to say that some killing in animals\nhas a moral significance and some does not?   Is this your\nnatural morality>\n\n\n\nAre you blind?   What do you think that this sentence means?\n\n	"There must be the possibility that the organism - it's not \n	just people we are talking about - can consider alternatives."\n\nWhat would that imply?\n\n\nI find the fact that they do to be significant.
It's not really their _decision_ to be tried. The rulings _do_ have\nlegal consequences, but only in Islamic law and not in UK law (this\nshould be obvious). Enforcing a judgment is distinct from the making\nof a judgment. Take for example the judgments of the World Court. This\nis an internationally recognized tribunal whose judgments often have no\nphysical or economic effect but which _are_ important despite the fact\nthat their judgments cannot be enforced\n\n\n\nOf course, have you read any of this thread before this post? \n\n\n\nOf course, it is a sort of anarchism. Anarchism is explicitly against\nIslam. Thank you for your well reasoned response, but it is beside the\npoints I've been making in this thread.
Did you miss my post on this topic with the quote from The Indonesian\nHandbook and Fred Rice's comments about temporary marriages?  If so, \nI will be glad to repost them.  Will you accept that it just may be \na practice among some Muslims, if I do?  Or will you continue to claim\nthat we are all lying and that it is "not practised at all amongst Muslims".\n\nI don't think F. Karner has to tell everyone anything.  Least of all that\nhe is lying.
Most likely the tragic situation in Bosnia is a combination of ethnical\nand religious motives, where religion is just one attribute that separates\nthe groups from each other.\n\nBut I must agree that the sad saga in Bosnia is a terrible example\nof a case where religion is not helping, instead it is used as a weapon\nagainst other humans. And my sympathies are mostly on the Bosnian side,\nit looks like the Serbs are the oppressors, willing to use even\nChristianity as a weapon against their former friends.\n\nCheers,\nKent

I lived in Tokyo for a year and a half, and one of the many reasons why\nI intend to go back indefinitely is the freedom one enjoys when one can\nwalk anywhere (and I mean *anywhere*) at any time of day or night and not\nfeel uneasy, even if one's from an ethnic minority as I was.\n\nClues for Bobby (why do I bother?): (i) Tokyo is a city, and inner Tokyo\nis an inner city; (ii) there is a negligible level of violent crime, and\na street murder will be a lead item on *national* TV news; (iii) the\npopulation is almost universally atheistic.\n\nNext time I go for a stroll around Beirut at night, I'll let you know how\nit compares.\n\n\nCheers\n\nSimon
Anyone who dies for a "cause" runs the risk of dying for a lie.  As for\npeople being able to tell if he was a liar, well, we've had grifters and\ncharlatans since the beginning of civilization.  If David Copperfield had\nbeen the Messiah, I bet he could have found plenty of believers.  \nJesus was hardly the first to claim to be a faith healer, and he wasn't the\nfirst to be "witnessed."  What sets him apart?\n\n\nRubbish.  Nations have followed crazies, liars, psychopaths, and \nmegalomaniacs throughout history.  Hitler, Tojo, Mussolini, Khomeini,\nQadaffi, Stalin, Papa Doc, and Nixon come to mind...all from this century.\nKoresh is a non-issue.\n\n\n\nTake a discrete mathematics or formal logic course.  There are flaws in your\nlogic everywhere.  And as I'm sure others will tell you, read the FAQ!\n\n\n\nOf course, you have to believe the Bible first.  Just because something is\nwritten in the Bible does not mean it is true, and the age of that tome plus\nthe lack of external supporting evidence makes it less credible.  So if you\ndo quote from the Bible in the future, try to back up that quote with \nsupporting evidence.  Otherwise, you will get flamed mercilessly.\n\n\n\nJust like weight lifting or guitar playing, eh?

No, you don't understand.  I said that I don't think people can discuss\nthe subjective merits of religion objectively.

Tammy, is this all explicitly stated in the bible, or do you assume\nthat you know that Ezekiel indirectly mentioned? It could have been\nanother metaphor, for instance Ezekiel was mad at his landlord, so he\ntalked about him when he wrote about the prince of Tyre.\n\nSorry, but my interpretation is more mundane, Ezekiel wrote about \nthe prince of Tyre when we wrote about the prince of Tyre.\n \nCheers,\nKent

Archive-name: atheism/introduction\nAlt-atheism-archive-name: introduction\nLast-modified: 5 April 1993\nVersion: 1.2\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\n\n                          An Introduction to Atheism\n                       by mathew <mathew@mantis.co.uk>\n\nThis article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism.  Whilst I\nhave tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, you\nshould always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  I\nwould encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; some\nrelevant books are listed in a companion article.\n\nTo provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this article\nas an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All the\nquestions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped\nup repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some other\nfrequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.\n\nPlease note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions\nposed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflect\nquestions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christians\nwho proselytize on alt.atheism.\n\nSo when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such as\nChristianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine\nbeing.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of it\nmay not.\n\n"What is atheism?"\n\nAtheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.\nSome atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is\noften referred to as the "weak atheist" position, and the latter as "strong\natheism".\n\nIt is important to note the difference between these two positions.  "Weak\natheism" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  "Strong\natheism" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not\nfall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are "strong atheists".\n\nSome atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit their\natheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than making\nflat-out denials.\n\n"But isn't disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn't exist?"\n\nDefinitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe\nit to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to\nbelieving that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or\nnot.  Which brings us to agnosticism.\n\n"What is agnosticism then?"\n\nThe term 'agnosticism' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the\nMetaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone who\ndisclaimed ("strong") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things\nmust be some cause unknown and unknowable.\n\nThus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for\nsure whether God exists.\n\nWords are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming that\nyou can work out someone's philosophical point of view simply from the fact\nthat she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many people\nuse agnosticism to mean "weak atheism", and use the word "atheism" only when\nreferring to "strong atheism".\n\nBeware also that because the word "atheist" has so many shades of meaning, it\nis very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say for\nsure is that atheists don't believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn't\nthe case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out\nabout the universe.\n\n"So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?"\n\nThere are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why a\nparticular person chooses to be an atheist, it's best to ask her.\n\nMany atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions\nis essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible that\nsuch a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because they\nsee no evidence that God exists.\n\n"But isn't it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?"\n\nThere are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it is\nquite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than\nall other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objects\nobeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarly\nwell-defined is a matter for debate.\n\nHowever, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably\nimpossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of\nGod.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible to\nshow that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.\n\nIf on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing in\nquestion is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalid\nmay require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing\nmight be found, to show that it isn't there.  Such an exhaustive search is\noften impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largest\nprimes, because we can prove that they don't exist.\n\nTherefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist\nunless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most of\nthe time; they don't believe in unicorns, even though they can't conclusively\nprove that no unicorns exist anywhere.\n\nTo assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be\ntested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to\nprove that he doesn't exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes by\ndefault that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.\n\nThose who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God\nexists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to cover\nvarieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst it\nmay be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may be\npossible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religious\nbook does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God described\nby any present-day religion exists.\n\nIn practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is very\nclose to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently different\nthat counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of\nGod are not really applicable.\n\n"But what if God is essentially non-detectable?"\n\nIf God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interaction\nmust be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must be\ndetectable.\n\nIf God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that he\ndoes not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would argue\nthat if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of no\nimportance whether he exists or not.\n\nIf the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites.\nSurely he should still be detectable today?\n\nNote that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientifically\nverifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive some\neffect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish him\nfrom all the other things that don't exist?\n\n"OK, you may think there's a philosophical justification for atheism, but\n isn't it still a religious belief?"\n\nOne of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is "the\nredefinition game".  The cynical view of this game is as follows:\n\nPerson A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points out\nthat it can't be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in the\nstatement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  He\nthen records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed to\nit, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an "agreed fact", but\nuses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure\nredefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seen\nto be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.\n\nThe point of this digression is that the answer to the question "Isn't\natheism a religious belief?" depends crucially upon what is meant by\n"religious".  "Religion" is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman\ncontrolling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and\nworship.\n\n[ It's worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not\n  "religion" according to such a definition. ]\n\nAtheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is it\ncategorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of\n"religious" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of\nhuman behaviour suddenly becoming classed as "religious" as well -- such as\nscience, politics, and watching TV.\n\n"OK, so it's not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is\n still just an act of faith, like religion is?"\n\nFirstly, it's not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one\nactually believes in.\n\nSecondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to\nmake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheists\ntry to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject to\nquestioning if experience throws them into doubt.\n\nScience has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generally\nassumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These are\nthe sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called\n"acts of faith", then almost everything we know must be said to be based on\nacts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.\n\nFaith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something.\nAccording to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts of\nfaith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as\nreligious followers when claiming that something is "certain".  This is not a\ngeneral tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant to\nstate with certainty that the universe exists.\n\nFaith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof.\nSceptical atheism certainly doesn't fit that definition, as sceptical atheism\nhas no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn't really match, as\neven the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (or\nthe lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist.\n\n"If atheism is not religious, surely it's anti-religious?"\n\nIt is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either "for" or\n"against", "friend" or "enemy".  The truth is not so clear-cut.\n\nAtheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense,\nit can be said to be "anti-religion".  However, when religious believers\nspeak of atheists being "anti-religious" they usually mean that the atheists\nhave some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.\n\nThis categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair.\nAtheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.\n\nMost atheists take a "live and let live" attitude.  Unless questioned, they\nwill not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Of\ncourse, this may be in part because atheism is not "socially acceptable" in\nmany countries.\n\nA few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to "convert" others\nwhen possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made little\nimpact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.\n\n(To digress slightly: the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separation\nof church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free to\nworship as they wished.  The institution of "state atheism" came about when\nStalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches in\norder to gain complete power over the population.)\n\nSome atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they see\nreligion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example,\nthe government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned that\nchurch and state should remain separate.\n\n"But if you don't allow religion to have a say in the running of the state,\n surely that's the same as state atheism?"\n\nThe principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall\nnot legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, it\nmeans not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of\nanother, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in\nnature.\n\nReligions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  For\nexample, religious believers have historically been responsible for\nencouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizations\ncampaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as\nreligious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters,\nand so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheists\nare quite happy to see them have their say.\n\n"What about prayer in schools? If there's no God, why do you care if people\n pray?"\n\nBecause people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do things\nthat those who don't pray can't just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer in\nschools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that they\nneed not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief means\nthat it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be\nacceptable to all those present at any public event.\n\nAlso, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonable\nto care about friends and family wasting their time, even without other\nmotives.\n\n"You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about\n atheists?  Why aren't there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don't\n atheists object to the religious charities?"\n\nThere are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can\ncontribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, for\nthe sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary work\nfor charities founded on a theistic basis.\n\nMost atheists seem to feel that atheism isn't worth shouting about in\nconnection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everyday\nmatter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it's somewhat cheap, not to say\nself-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set\nof religious beliefs.\n\nTo "weak" atheists, building a hospital to say "I do not believe in God" is a\nrather strange idea; it's rather like holding a party to say "Today is not my\nbirthday".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical.\n\n"You said atheism isn't anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against\n one's upbringing, a way of rebelling?"\n\nPerhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt to\nforce any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those people\nchoose to call themselves atheists.\n\nIt's also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a\nbacklash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On the\nother hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the\nexpectations of others.\n\nOn the whole, we can't conclude much about whether atheism or religion are\nbacklash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to go\nalong with a group rather than act or think independently.\n\n"How do atheists differ from religious people?"\n\nThey don't believe in God.  That's all there is to it.\n\nAtheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer a\nVerdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts,\nthey may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (Many\nBuddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copy\nof the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!\n\nWhoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists without\nrealising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and\nappearance.\n\n"Unexceptional? But aren't atheists less moral than religious people?"\n\nThat depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of course\natheists are less moral as they don't obey any God.  But usually when one\ntalks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable ("right") and unacceptable\n("wrong") behaviour within society.\n\nHumans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they must\nco-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage most\natheists from "anti-social" or "immoral" behaviour, purely for the purposes\nof self-preservation.\n\nMany atheists behave in a "moral" or "compassionate" way simply because they\nfeel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they care\nwhat happens to others?  They don't know, they simply are that way.\n\nNaturally, there are some people who behave "immorally" and try to use\natheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people who\nbehave "immorally" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their\nactions.  For example:\n\n  "Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ\n   came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was\n   shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited\n   patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive\n   eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,\n   be honor and glory forever and ever."\n\nThe above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992\nby Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee,\nWisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is a\nreligious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?\n\n   A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior\n   deteriorated after "born again" experiences.  While only 4% of respondents\n   said they had driven intoxicated before being "born again," 12% had done\n   so after conversion.  Similarly, 5% had used illegal drugs before\n   conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex\n   before salvation; 5% after.\n                                ["Freethought Today", September 1991, p. 12.]\n\nSo it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moral\nbehaviour.\n\n"Is there such a thing as atheist morality?"\n\nIf you mean "Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?", then the\nanswer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about morality\nwhich are at least as strong as those held by religious people.\n\nIf you mean "Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?", then the answer\nis no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person\nwill behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same "moral rules" as theists,\nbut for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created by\nhumans, according to the way humans feel the world 'ought' to work, rather\nthan seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being.\n\n"Then aren't atheists just theists who are denying God?"\n\nA study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of the\natheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for\nthem.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible\nwith what they observed around them.\n\nAtheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they are\nunbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent time\nstudying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They have\nmade a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.\n\nThis decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of that\nindividual's personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choice\nof atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the only\nchoice that person can honestly make.\n\n"But don't atheists want to believe in God?"\n\nAtheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Many\nof them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the\n"Big Brother" figure might be.\n\nSome atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Should\none believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks of\nsuch an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting to\nbelieve something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief.\n\n"But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are\n unwilling in their souls to see!"\n\nMany, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explained\nabove, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that God\nexists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.\n\nOf course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming that\nall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded.\nComments such as "Of course God is there, you just aren't looking properly"\nare likely to be viewed as patronizing.\n\nCertainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is\nvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are\nbeing sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are not\nwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate is\nfutile.\n\n"Isn't the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?"\n\nMany atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think gives\nmeaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their lives\ncount, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on other\npeople who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life to\npolitical reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.\n\nIt is a natural human tendency to look for "meaning" or "purpose" in random\nevents.  However, it is by no means obvious that "life" is the sort of thing\nthat has a "meaning".\n\nTo put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actually\na sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking "What is the\nmeaning of life?" is as silly as asking "What is the meaning of a cup of\ncoffee?".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is.\n\n"So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?"\n\nThere are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets.\nOr on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.\n\nThat may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but so\nwhat?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, or\nshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?\n\nIn the end, it's a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists are\nunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because\nit makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and consider\nthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that's just\nhard luck.\n\n"Don't atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?"\n\nThe short answer is "No, do you?"\n\nMany atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered many\narguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they have\nfound all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.\n\nThousands of years of religious belief haven't resulted in any good proof of\nthe existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely\nto be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it.\n\n"So why should theists question their beliefs? Don't the same arguments\n apply?"\n\nNo, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism is\nthe sceptical "default position" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheism\nis a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.\n\nAtheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs\nbecause of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers,\nbut to everyone else.\n\n"What sort of harm?"\n\nReligion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It's not\njust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings;\nthink of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on.\nImagine how that effort could be better spent.\n\nMany theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instances\nof ill people being "healed" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicines\nprescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have died\nbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.\n\nIt is arguable that the Catholic Church's opposition to birth control -- and\ncondoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many\nthird-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.\n\nReligious believers have been known to murder their children rather than\nallow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different\nreligion.\n\n"Those weren't REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some\n sort of excuse."\n\nWhat makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it's hard\nto tell.  Look at Christianity: there are many competing groups, all\nconvinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fight\nand kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who's a REAL\nChristian and who isn't, when even the major Christian churches like the\nCatholic Church and the Church of England can't decide amongst themselves?\n\nIn the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone who\ncalls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify his\nactions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christians\nare just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely if\nthe Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can't be\nmuch of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn't he have\nmade it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefs\naren't a perversion of what your God intended?\n\nIf there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then why\nshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so?\nSorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murdered\nothers because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him a\nChristian.\n\n"Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since\n nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely\n that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense."\n\nThat does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue,\npositive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much\nharder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicorns\ndon't exist, but that doesn't make it unlikely that they are myths.\n\nIt is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than\nit is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, "weak" atheists\nwould argue that asserting nothing is better still.\n\n"Well, if atheism's so great, why are there so many theists?"\n\nUnfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how "correct"\nit is, or whether it "works"; consider how many people believe in astrology,\ngraphology, and other pseudo-sciences.\n\nMany atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in\ngods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows the\npeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.\n\nOf course, there's more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world,\nwe find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when\nthere are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have started\nas a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves other\npurposes as well.\n\n"But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say\n something?"\n\nNot really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it's\nworth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of\nconcept of God in the Christian sense.\n\nOf course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it's\nrather odd to use one religion to try and justify another.\n\n"What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded\n that God exists?"\n\nFor every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one who\ndoes not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief is\nnot determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important to\nrealize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the\nsame way that theists view their religious leaders.\n\nA famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, but\nwhen she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Many\nrespected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on\nsubjects which lie outside their fields of expertise.\n\n"So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates\n nothing?"\n\nNot entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question has\nproperties which have helped it so spread so far.\n\nThe theory of memetics talks of "memes" -- sets of ideas which can propagate\nthemselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists view\nreligions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread by\nencouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction by\ndiscouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressure\nto keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Some\nreligious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by\nother memes.\n\nOf course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with\nsuccessful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because of\nthe number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thing\nbecause of the number of people who have caught it.\n\n"Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important\n messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?"\n\nThere are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just a\nfew of them; don't be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some\nreligions.\n\n   There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.\n\n   Be especially sceptical of positive claims.\n\n   If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it's up to you to\n   find it.\n\n   Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.\n\n   Make the most of your life, as it's probably the only one you'll have.\n\n   It's no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change\n   yourself.\n\n   Just because something's popular doesn't mean it's good.\n\n   If you must assume something, assume something it's easy to test.\n\n   Don't believe things just because you want them to be true.\n\nand finally (and most importantly):\n\n   All beliefs should be open to question.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this article.\n\n\nmathew\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: 2.2\n\niQCVAgUBK8AjRXzXN+VrOblFAQFSbwP+MHePY4g7ge8Mo5wpsivX+kHYYxMErFAO\n7ltVtMVTu66Nz6sBbPw9QkbjArbY/S2sZ9NF5htdii0R6SsEyPl0R6/9bV9okE/q\nnihqnzXE8pGvLt7tlez4EoeHZjXLEFrdEyPVayT54yQqGb4HARbOEHDcrTe2atmP\nq0Z4hSSPpAU=\n=q2V5\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----

Does anybody have Bobby's post in which he said something like "I don't\nknow why there are more men than women in islamic countries. Maybe it's\natheists killing the female children"? It's my personal favorite!
Perhaps because you just made it up?
It's not the fact that it can't exist that bothers me.   It's \nthe fact that you don't seem to be able to define it.\n\nIf I wanted to hear about indefinable things that might in\nprinciple exist as long as you don't think about them too\ncarefully, I could ask a religious person, now couldn't I?
Good statement! Should we apply empirical measurements to define exact\nsocial morals? Should morals be based on social rules? On ancient\nreligious doctrines? It seems there will *NEVER* be a common and single\ndenominator for defining morals, and as such defining absolute\nand objective morals is doomed to fail as long as humans have \nthis incredible talent of creative thinking.\n\nCheers,\nKent

No wonder in the light of that you are a probably a theist who tries\nto pass as an agnostic. I still remember your post about your daughter\nsinging Chrismas Carols and your feelings of it well.

As far as I know, tigers are not sentient.  If I were pushed into a pool with\nsome dolphins and they attacked me, I might be inclined to blame the dolphins\nrather than the person doing the pushing, as (a) dolphins are not usually\naggressive and (b) they seem to have well-developed brains and a capacity for\nabstract thought.\n\nAs a matter of fact, tigers rarely attack humans unless the human provokes\nthem.  Of course, if they are in a cage which is far too small, that might\ncount as provocation...
(Attempting to define 'objective morality'):\n\n\n      So long as you keep that "almost" in there, freedom will be a\nmostly valuable thing, to most people. That is, I think you're really\nsaying, "a real big lot of people agree freedom is subjectively valuable\nto them". That's good, and a quite nice starting point for a moral\nsystem, but it's NOT UNIVERSAL, and thus not "objective".\n\n\n      It isn't in Sahara.

Points covered here are ones which are not covered in the\n"Introduction to Atheism"; you are advised to read that article as well\nbefore posting.\n\nThese answers are not intended to be exhaustive or definitive. The purpose of\nthe periodic FAQ postings is not to stifle debate, but to raise its level. If\nyou have something to say concerning one of these questions and which isn't\ncovered by the answer given, please feel free to make your point.\n\nOverview of contents:\n\n   "What is the purpose of this newsgroup?"\n   "Hitler was an atheist!"\n   "The Bible proves it"\n   "Pascal's Wager"\n   "What is Occam's Razor?"\n   "Why it's good to believe in Jesus"\n   "Why I know that God exists"\n   "Einstein and "God does not play dice""\n   "Everyone worships something"\n   "Why there must be a causeless cause"\n   "The universe is so complex it must have been designed"\n   "Independent evidence that the Bible is true"\n   "Godel's Incompleteness Theorem"\n   "George Bush on atheism and patriotism"\n   "I know where hell is!"\n   "Biblical contradictions wanted"\n   "The USA is a Christian nation"\n   "The USA is not a Christian nation"\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSubject: What is the purpose of this newsgroup?\n\nTypical posting:\n\nWhy have a newsgroup about atheism?  Why do atheists organize in groups?  \nWhat is there to discuss?\n\nResponse:\n\nMany things are discussed here, including:\n\n* Whether it is reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upsetting one's\n  family\n* Prayer in schools\n* Discrimination against atheists\n* Sunday trading laws\n* The Satanic Child Abuse myth\n* Whether one should be an overt atheist or 'stay in the closet'\n* How religious societies prey (sic) on new college students\n* How to get rid of unwanted proselytizers\n* Whether religion is a danger to society and/or the individual\n* Why people become atheists\n\nOf course, inevitably alt.atheism tends to attract evangelical Christians\nlooking for someone to convert.  Most readers of the newsgroup don't \nwant to be preached to, although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure \nfrom tearing apart particularly ill-considered or uninformed postings.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Hitler was an atheist!\n\nTypical posting:\n\nHitler was an atheist, and look at what he did!\n\nResponse:\n\nAdolf Hitler was emphatically not an atheist.  As he said himself:\n\n   The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in\n   his own denomination, of making _people_stop_just_talking_\n   superficially_of_God's_will,_and_actually_fulfill_God's_will,_and_\n   not_let_God's_word_be_desecrated._[orig. ital.]\n\n   For God's will gave men their form, their essence, and their\n   abilities.  Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the\n   Lord's creation, the divine will.  Therefore, let every man be\n   active, each in his own denomination if you please, and let every\n   man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who\n   in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his\n   religious community and tries to butt into the other.\n\n   [...]\n\n   Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will\n   of the Almighty Creator: _by_defending_myself_against_the_Jew,_I_am_\n   fighting_for_the_work_of_the_Lord._[orig. ital.]\n\n          -- Adolf Hitler, from "Mein Kampf", trans. Ralph Mannheim.\n\nOf course, someone bad believing something does not make that belief\nwrong.  It's also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed \nto believe in God.  We certainly can't conclude that he's an atheist, \nthough.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: The Bible proves it\n\nTypical posting:\n\nIn the Bible it says that...\n\nResponse:\n\nMost of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the Bible is of questionable\naccuracy, as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were\nrecording oral tradition that existed many years before.  Thus, any claimed\n'truth' in it is of questionable legitimacy.  This isn't to say that The\nBible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before being\naccepted.\n\nMany of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is\nsubject to "interpretation", any claim that a passage 'means' one thing and\none thing only is not legitimate.\n\nNote that this feeling tends to extend to other books.\n\nIt is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other\nequally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Pascal's Wager\n\nTypical posting:\n\nIf you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing --\nbut if you don't believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to\nhell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.\n\nResponse:\n\nThis argument is known as Pascal's Wager.  It has several flaws.\n\nFirstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there are\nmany mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is often\ndescribed as the "avoiding the wrong hell" problem.  If a person is a\nfollower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y's version of hell.\n\nSecondly, the statement that "If you believe in God and turn out to be\nincorrect, you have lost nothing" is not true.  Suppose you're believing in\nthe wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness.\nConsider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in\nfavour of prayer.\n\nAnother flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that \nthe two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of \ncomparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God \nis close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly the\nargument is only likely to convince those who believe already.\n\nAlso, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on \nevidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or \ncost-benefit analysis.\n\nFormally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:\n\n  1. One does not know whether God exists.\n  2. Not believing in God is bad for one's eternal soul if God does\n     exist.\n  3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.\n  4. Therefore it is in one's interest to believe in God.\n\nThere are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as an\nassumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, in\nthe abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This is\nconsidered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has no\ninformation about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information\ncan be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violates\ninformation entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at\nno "cost".\n\nThe alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  The\nproblem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the\nChristian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. The\nargument thus collapses to "If you are a Christian, it is in your interests\nto believe in God" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascal\nintended the argument to be viewed.\n\nThe biggest reason why Pascal's wager is a failure is that if God is\nomniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as\na wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all\nwhether people believe in him.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: What is Occam's Razor?\n\nTypical posting:\n\nPeople keep talking about Occam's Razor.  What is it?\n\nResponse:\n\nWilliam of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam's \nRazor.  In its original form, it said "Do not multiply entities \nunnecessarily."  That is, if you can explain something without supposing\nthe existence of some entity, then do so.\n\nNowadays when people refer to Occam's Razor, they generally express it \nmore generally, for example as "Take the simplest solution".\n\nThe relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations \nfor what we see around us:\n\n1. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, which\ncame into being as a result of natural processes.\n\n2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and \nthere is also a God who created the universe.  Clearly this God must be \nof non-zero complexity.\n\nGiven that both explanations fit the facts, Occam's Razor might suggest \nthat we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one.\nUnfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:\n\n3. There isn't an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there.  \nWe just imagine that there is.\n\nThis third option leads us logically towards solipsism, which many people \nfind unacceptable.\n \n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Why it's good to believe in Jesus\n\nTypical posting:\n\nI want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.\n\nResponse:\n\nPreaching is not appreciated.\n\nFeel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write postings that\nare on a "conversion" theme.  Such postings do not belong on alt.atheism and\nwill be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgroup\ntalk.religion.misc).\n\nYou would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite\nnewsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you would\nhave them do unto you!\n\nOften theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthy\nanalogies or parables.  Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know the\nbasic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell\natheists that God exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it,\nsince it tells us nothing we have not been told before.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Why I know that God exists\n\nTypical posting:\n\nI *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists.\n\nResponse:\n\nJust as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship\nexists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not\nexist.  That evidence varies from person to person.\n\nFurthermore, without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand, many\npeople have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have been\nabducted by UFOs, visited by the ghost of Elvis, and so on.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Einstein and "God does not play dice"\n\nTypical posting:\n\nAlbert Einstein believed in God.  Do you think you're cleverer than him?\n\nResponse:\n\nEinstein did once comment that "God does not play dice [with the universe]". \nThis quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in the\nChristian God.  Used this way, it is out of context; it refers to Einstein's\nrefusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory. Furthermore,\nEinstein's religious background was Jewish rather than Christian.\n\nA better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following:\n"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of\nwhat exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of\nhuman beings."\n\nEinstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an\nobjective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to random\nevents and which would not be dependent upon the observer.  He believed that\nQM was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need for\nstatistical interpretations.  So far no such better theory has been found,\nand much evidence suggests that it never will be.\n\nA longer quote from Einstein appears in "Science, Philosophy, and Religion, A\nSymposium", published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion\nin Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941.  In\n\n  "The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events\n   the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side\n   of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.  For him\n   neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an\n   independent cause of natural events.  To be sure, the doctrine of a\n   personal God interfering with natural events could never be\n   *refuted* [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this\n   doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific\n   knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.\n\n   But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives\n   of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine\n   which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,\n   will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm\n   to human progress.  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers\n   of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal\n   God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past\n   placed such vast power in the hands of priests.  In their labors they\n   will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable\n   of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity\n   itself.  This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably\n   more worthy task..."\n\n\n  "It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,\n   a lie which is being systematically repeated.  I do not believe in a\n   personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.\n   If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the\n   unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our\n   science can reveal it."\n\nThe latter quote is from "Albert Einstein: The Human Side", edited by Helen \nDukas and Banesh Hoffman, and published by Princeton University Press.  \nAlso from the same book:\n\n  "I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics\n   to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind \n   it."\n\nOf course, the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does \nnot in itself imply that Christianity is false.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Everyone worships something\n\nTypical posting:\n\nEveryone worships something, whether it's money, power or God.\n\nResponse:\n\nIf that is true, everyone is a polytheist.  Theists care just as much about\nthose things that atheists care about.  If the atheists' reactions to (for\nexample) their families amount to worship then so do the theists'.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Why there must be a causeless cause\n\nTypical posting:\n\nSets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member, so\nchains of causes must all have a first element, a causeless cause.\n\nResponse:\n\nThe set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound, but has\nno smallest member.\n\nFurther, even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause, that does\nnot imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity, and\nespecially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by\nany particular religion.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: The universe is so complex it must have been designed\n\nTypical posting:\n\nThe presence of design in the universe proves there is a God.  Surely you\ndon't think all this appeared here just by chance?\n\nResponse:\n\nThis is known as the Argument From Design.\n\nIt is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the\nuniverse. Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living\ncreatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the\nnewsgroup talk.origins for a while.\n\nThere is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here.\nHowever, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of\nso-called Scientific Creationism. Furthermore, there is much evidence,\nobservation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the\nuniverse and life on earth.\n\nThe origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of\nsomething as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable that\nsurely it can't have come about by chance; that surely there must be some \nexternal intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos\ndeliberately.\n\nBut if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mind\ncapable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must\nbe immeasurably more unlikely?  The approach used to argue in favour of the\nexistence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist\nposition.\n\nThis leads us to the familiar theme of "If a creator created the universe,\nwhat created the creator?", but with the addition of spiralling \nimprobability.  The only way out is to declare that the creator was not\ncreated and just "is" (or "was").\n\nFrom here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe\njust "is" without introducing a creator?  Indeed Stephen Hawking, in his book\n"A Brief History of Time", explains his theory that the universe is closed\nand finite in extent, with no beginning or end.\n\nThe Argument From Design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called \nWatchmaker Argument.  One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on\nthe beach.  Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that it\nevolved naturally?  Of course one assumes a watchmaker.  Yet like the \nwatch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the \nuniverse too must have a creator.\n\nThe Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above \nthose common to all Arguments By Design.  Firstly, a watchmaker creates \nwatches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have \ncreated the universe from nothing.  These two sorts of creation are \nclearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.\n\nSecondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in \nthe world.  If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear \nreactor, we wouldn't assume it was created by the watchmaker.  The argument \nwould therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a \ndifferent part of creation.\n\nFinally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that \nthe watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore \nstands out from the randomness of nature.  Yet in the second part of the \nargument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not \nrandom, but shows elements of order.  The Watchmaker argument is thus \ninternally inconsistent.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Independent evidence that the Bible is true\n\nTypical posting:\n\nThe events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentary\nevidence.  For example...\n\nResponse:\n\nThe writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary\nevidence.\n\nEarly versions of Josephus's work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus or\nJames; the extant version discusses John in a non-Christian context.  Many\nscholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing, but\nthat this was expanded by Christian copyists.  Several "reconstructions" of\nthe original text have been published to this effect.\n\nMuch information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius (about 320\nC.E.).  It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate\nfalsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as 'the\nfirst thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity.' It is Eusebius who is\ngenerally given the title of authorship for this material.\n\nAside from the New Testament, the biographical information about Jesus is\nmore well-documented.  For further information, please consult the Frequently\nAsked Questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Godel's Incompleteness Theorem\n\nTypical posting:\n\nGodel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the\nBible to be both true and complete.\n\nResponse:\n\nGodel's First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal \nsystem which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary \narithmetic, one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be \nvalid or invalid ('true' or 'false') within that formal system.  (Technically\nspeaking, the system must also be recursive; that is, there must be a decision\nprocedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal \nsystem.)\n\nEssentially, all such systems can formulate what is known as a "Liar \nParadox."  The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is "This \nsentence is false."  Note that if a proposition is undecidable, the formal \nsystem cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.\n\nThe logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claims\nthat Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to\nprove or disprove) the existence of God are worthless in isolation.\n\nOne can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the\nexistence of God, simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom. \nThis is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof, however.\n\nIt may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms\nthat both atheists and theists agree with.  It may then be possible to show\nthat Godel's Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system.  However, that\nwould still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God exists\nwithin the system.  Furthermore, it certainly wouldn't tell us anything about\nwhether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally.\n\nNote also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about\nthe actual existence of God; the formal systems are just abstractions.\n\nAnother frequent claim is that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates\nthat a religious text (the Bible, the Book of Mormon or whatever) cannot be\nboth consistent and universally applicable. Religious texts are not formal\nsystems, so such claims are nonsense.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: George Bush on atheism and patriotism\n\nTypical posting:\n\nDid George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens?\n\nResponse:\n\nThe following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I.\nSherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush, on August 27 1988. Sherman\nis a fully accredited reporter, and was present by invitation as a member of\nthe press corps.  The Republican presidential nominee was there to announce\nfederal disaster relief for Illinois.  The discussion turned to the\npresidential primary:\n\n RS: "What will you do to win the votes of Americans who are atheists?"\n\n GB: "I guess I'm pretty weak in the atheist community.  Faith in\n      God is important to me."\n\n RS: "Surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of\n      Americans who are atheists?"\n\n GB: "No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens,\n      nor should they be considered patriots.  This is one nation under\n      God."\n\n RS: "Do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation\n      of state and church?"\n\n GB: "Yes, I support the separation of church and state.  I'm just not\n      very high on atheists."\n\nUPI reported on May 8, 1989, that various atheist organizations were\nstill angry over the remarks.\n\nThe exchange appeared in the Boulder Daily Camera on Monday February 27,\n1989.  It can also be found in "Free Enquiry" magazine, Fall 1988 issue,\nVolume 8, Number 4, page 16.\n\nOn October 29, 1988, Mr. Sherman had a confrontation with Ed Murnane,\ncochairman of the Bush-Quayle '88 Illinois campaign.  This concerned a\nlawsuit Mr. Sherman had filed to stop the Community Consolidated School\nDistrict 21 (Chicago, Illinois) from forcing his first-grade Atheist son to\npledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as "one nation under God"\n(Bush's phrase).  The following conversation took place:\n \n RS: "American Atheists filed the Pledge of Allegiance lawsuit yesterday.\n      Does the Bush campaign have an official response to this filing?"\n \n EM: "It's bullshit."\n \n RS: "What is bullshit?"\n \n EM: "Everything that American Atheists does, Rob, is bullshit."\n \n RS: "Thank you for telling me what the official position of the Bush\n      campaign is on this issue."\n\n EM: "You're welcome."\n\nAfter Bush's election, American Atheists wrote to Bush asking him to retract\nhis statement.  On February 21st 1989, C. Boyden Gray, Counsel to the\nPresident, replied on White House stationery that Bush substantively stood by\n\n  "As you are aware, the President is a religious man who neither supports\n   atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or\n   supported by the government."\n\nFor further information, contact American Atheist Veterans at the American\nAtheist Press's Cameron Road address.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: I know where hell is!\n\nTypical posting:\n\nI know where Hell is!  Hell is in Norway!\n\nResponse:\n\nThere are several towns called "Hell" in various countries around the\nworld, including Norway and the USA.  Whilst this information is mildly\namusing the first time one hears it, readers of alt.atheism are now \ngetting pretty fed up with hearing it every week.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Biblical contradictions wanted\n\nTypical posting:\n\nDoes anyone have a list of Biblical contradictions?\n\nResponse:\n \nAmerican Atheist Press publish an atheist's handbook detailing Biblical\ncontradictions. See the accompanying posting on Atheist Resources for\ndetails.\n\nThere is a file containing some Biblical contradictions available from the\narchive-server@mantis.co.uk. See the contacts file for more information.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: The USA is a Christian nation\n\nTypical posting:\n\nBecause of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers, shouldn't the\nUnited States be considered a Christian nation?\n\nResponse:\n\nBased upon the writings of several important founding fathers, it is clear\nthat they never intended the US to be a Christian nation.  Here are some\nquotes; there are many more.\n\n  "What influence, in fact, have ecclesiastical establishments had on society?\n   In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the\n   ruins of the civil authority; on many instances they have been seen\n   upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they been\n   the guardians of the liberties of the people.  Rulers who wish to subvert\n   the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient\n   auxiliaries. A just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate it,\n   needs them not."\n      - James Madison, "A Memorial and Remonstrance", 1785\n\n  "I almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of\n   the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved--the Cross.\n   Consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced!"\n      - John Adams, in a letter to Thomas Jefferson\n\n  "History I believe furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people\n   maintaining a free civil government.  This marks the lowest grade of\n   ignorance, of which their political as well as religious leaders will\n   always avail themselves for their own purpose."\n\n      - Thomas Jefferson to Baron von Humboldt, 1813\n\n  "I cannot conceive otherwise than that He, the Infinite Father, expects or\n   requires no worship or praise from us, but that He is even infinitely\n   above it."\n\n      - Benjamin Franklin, from "Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion",\n        Nov. 20, 1728\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: The USA is not a Christian nation\n\nTypical posting:\n\nIs it true that George Washington said that the United States is not in any\nsense founded upon the Christian religion?\n\nResponse:\n\nNo.  The quotation often given is in fact from Article XI of the 1797 Treaty\nof Tripoli (8 Stat 154, Treaty Series 358):\n\n   Article 11\n\n   As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense\n   founded on the Christian Religion, -- as it has in itself no character of\n   enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Musselmen, -- and as\n   the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility\n   against any Mehomitan nation, it is declared by the parties that no\n   pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption\n   of the harmony existing between the two countries.\n\nThe text may be found in the Congressional Record or in treaty collections\nsuch as Charles Bevans' "Treaties and Other International Agreements of the\nUnited States of America 1776-1949", vol. 11 (pp. 1070-1080).\n\nThe English text of the Treaty of Tripoli was approved by the U.S. Senate on\nJune 7, 1797 and ratified by President John Adams on June 10, 1797.  It was\nrecently discovered that the Arabic version of the treaty not only lacks the\nquotation, it lacks Article XI altogether.\n\nThe person who translated the Arabic to English was Joel Barlow, Consul\nGeneral at Algiers, a close friend of Thomas Paine -- and an opponent of\nChristianity.  It is possible that Barlow made up Article XI, but since there\nis no Arabic version of that article to be found, it's hard to say.\n\nIn 1806 a new Treaty of Tripoli was ratified which no longer contained the\nquotation.
Hi Adda,\n\nMost Bible scholars agree that there was one copy of each book at a certain\ntime -- the time when the author wrote it.  Unfortunately, like all works\nfrom this time period and earlier, all that exists today are copies. \n\n\nThere are parts of books, scraps really, that date from around the\nmid second century (A.D. 130+).  There are some complete books, letters,\netc. from the middle third century.  The first complete collection of\nthe New Testament dates from the early 4th century (A.D. 325).  Throughout\nthis period are writings of various early church fathers/leaders who\nquoted various scriptures in their writings.\n\n\nIf you mean that someone discovered thousands of "Bibles" which were all\nperfect copies dating from the last part of the 1st century...No!\n\nIf you mean that there are thousands of early manuscripts (within the\ndates given above, but not letter perfect) and that the most probable\ntext can be reconstructed from these documents and that the earliest\noriginal autographs (now lost) probably were written starting sometime\nshortly after A.D. 50, then yes.\n\n\nFrom the original authors.  We call them Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Peter,\nPaul, James, and one other not identified.\n\n\nAs long as you make it.\n\n\nRegards,
Sorry, I don't follow your reasoning.  You are proposing to punish people\n*before* they commit a crime?  What justification do you have for this?
See, there you go again, saying that a moral act is only significant\nif it is "voluntary."  Why do you think this?\n\nAnd anyway, humans have the ability to disregard some of their instincts.\n\n\nYou are attaching too many things to the term "moral," I think.\nLet's try this:  is it "good" that animals of the same species\ndon't kill each other.  Or, do you think this is right? \n\nOr do you think that animals are machines, and that nothing they do\nis either right nor wrong?\n\n\n\nThose weren't arbitrary killings.  They were slayings related to some sort\nof mating ritual or whatnot.\n\n\nYes it was, but I still don't understand your distinctions.  What\ndo you mean by "consider?"  Can a small child be moral?  How about\na gorilla?  A dolphin?  A platypus?  Where is the line drawn?  Does\nthe being need to be self aware?\n\nWhat *do* you call the mechanism which seems to prevent animals of\nthe same species from (arbitrarily) killing each other?  Don't\nyou find the fact that they don't at all significant?
But you haven't taken into the account of propoganda.  Remember, if you\nasked Germans before WWII if the Jews shoudl be slaughtered, they would\nprobably answer no, but, after the propoganda machine rolled through, at\nleast some were able to tolerate it.\n\nYou see, it only takes a small group of fanatics to whip up a general\nfrenzy.\n\n\nWell, they haven't managed to outlaw abortion due to the possible objectivity\nof the courts.  But, they have managed to create quite a few problems for\npeople that wanted to have an abortion.  They could create similar problems\nfor us.  And, it could be worse.  They can try to stop abortions by blocking\nclinics, etc., but imagine what they'd have to do to stop atheism.\n\n\nSo, you are able to convince them individually, but could you convince a\nwhole room of them?  A whole nation?\n\n\nYes, I'd be glad if it were gone to.  I've never supported it.  However,\nI think that it is a minor problem that can be easily ignored, contrasted\nwith what *could* happen (an what may be likely).\n\n\nWell, I am not clear on the religious convictions of Francis Scott Key (the\nmotto can be attributed to him), but it is at least clear that he believed\nin a god.  And, surely there are a few Christians that think as you say,\nbut I don't think that most do.  Do you think that all Christians actively\ndespise other religions?  Most that I have met haven't and don't do so.\n\n\nWell, I have asked a Hindu, Moselem, and a few Jews, and all of them think\nthat it is applicable to them.  Of course, I can't say that these people\n(just some that I know pretty well) are accurate representations of their\nfaiths.\n\n\nWell, I'd really like to, and I've tried, but I really don't know where to\nget access to _Congressional Records_ from the 1950's.  Can anyone help\nout here?\n\n\nOnly in the sense that neither can probably convinced to change their beliefs.\n\n\n\nSo, are you saying that they redesign the plates each year?\n\nAnyway, your whole argument (conveniently deleted I see) was that the motto\nsomehow costs us all a lot of money.  This is just not correct.\n\n\nThat is to say, the religion of this country, and the non-religion of\nthe USSR.  That was what most of those quotes were about, and some included\nall atheists, in general, as well.  I don't think that any of the quotes\n(although I seem to have lost them) mentioned anything at all about Jesus.\nThey advocated religion over non-religion.  A specific religion was not\nmentioned.\n\n\nSo, you are saying that all Christians must believe that all other religions\nshould be outlawed, just because they think they are wrong?  That's silly.\nI think the Flat-Earthers are wrong, but I don't advocate their banishment.\n\n\nI think that any such cost would be insignificant.  I mentioned the slight\ncost because you said that the motto was costing us a lot of money by\nbeing on our currency.\n\n\nWell, mottos in general don't really have purposes...  I don't think it\nshould be removed because I think the benefit would be outweighed by the\nconsequences.\n\n\nThen you should be concerned with the opinion of the entire congress.\n\n\nWhy not?  It is the majority that put it there.\n\n\nBut do they remember the debate surrounding the motto?  Do they remember\nthat some people intended it to be a message against atheists?  Why don't\nyou include this in your little survey that you were conducting?\n\n[...]\n\nWhat?  Should I ask some scientists the probability that something Einstein\nsaid about relativity is worthy?  I mean, if Einstein said it, there's a\ngood chance that it was right (at least at the time).\n\n\nYou need not agree with them all of the time, but you would certainly think\nthat their decisions would be good evidence in favor of some point.\n\n\nNo, I think that it would be clearly inappropriate for a Supreme Court\nJustice to testify before Congress during the consideration of a\nConstitutional Amendment.\n\nAnd, in order for the Court to rule on something, a case usually must be\npresented.\n\n\nYes, some mushrooms can be planted.  And, I don't appreciate mushrooms on\nmy pizza, either.\n\n\nWho was forced to put the motto there?  What do you mean?
You have only shown that a vast majority ( if not all ) would\nagree to this. However, there is nothing against a subjective majority.\n\n	In any event, I must challenge your assertion. I know many \nsocieties- heck, many US citizens- willing to trade freedom for "security".\n\n\n--- \n\n        " Whatever promises that have been made can than be broken. "
Damn right you can't provide any evidence for it.  \n\n  Rarely are any widespread social phenomenon reducible to such a\n  simple premise.  If they were, psychology would be a hard science\n  with roughly the same mathematical soundness as physics.  \n\n  Your premise may well be right.  It is much more likely, however,\n  that it reflects your socialization and religious background, as\n  well as your need to validate your religious beliefs.  Were I to\n  pretend to have all the answers (and I don't), I would say that the\n  xenophobia, guilt, and intolerance brought about by adherence to \n  fundamentalist religions play just as large a role in depressing\n  the members of our society.\n\n  Your mileage obviously varies.\n\n/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\ \n\nBob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM \n\nThey said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away,\nand sank Manhattan out at sea.
Actually, the story goes that Lucifer refused to bow before MAN as \nGod commanded him to.  Lucifer was devoted to God.\n\nOh yeah, there is nothing in Genesis that says the snake was anything\nmore than a snake (well, a talking one...had legs at the time, too).\n\nI don't think pointing out contradictions in STORIES is the best way\nto show the error in theology:  if they think a supernatural entity\nkicked the first humans out of paradise because they bit into a\nfruit that gave them special powers...well, they might not respond\nwell to reason and logic.  :^)
Which objective system are you talking about?  What is its goal?\nAgain, which brand of morality are you talking about?
Did I claim that there was an absolute morality, or just an objective one?
At the time Ezekiel was written, Israel was in apostacy again and if I'm not \nmistaken, Tyre was about to make war on Israel.  Like I said, the Prince of \nTyre was the human ruler of Tyre.  He was a wicked man.  By calling Satan \nthe King of Tyre, Ezekiel was saying that Satan is the real ruler over Tyre.\n\nDon't think my interpretation is neccessarily the orthodox Christian one, \nalthough most Christian Bible commentaries interpret the King of Tyre as \nbeing a reference to Satan. (I haven't read Ezekiel throughly in a long \ntime.)

Obviously you keep to the\n: Monty Python song:  "Every sperm is sacred".  And if, as *you* say, it has\n: a purpose as a means to limit population growth then it is, by your own \n: arguement, natural.\n\nConsider the context, I'm talking about an evolutionary function. One\nof the most basic requirements of evolution is that members of a\nspecies procreate, those who don't have no purpose in that context.\n\n: \n: |> Another point is that if the offspring of each generation is to\n: |> survive, the participation of both parents is necessary - a family must\n: |> exist, since homosexuals do not reproduce, they cannot constitute a\n: |> family.

As to your\nsecond point, you prove again that you have no idea what context\nmeans.

These days sex is less to do with procreation (admittedly\n: without it there would be no-one) but more to do with pleasure.  In pre-pill\n: and pre-condom days, if you had sex there was the chance of producing children.\n: These days is just ain't true!  People can decide whether or not to have \n: children and when.  Soon they will be able to choose it's sex &c (but that's \n: another arguement...) so it's more of a "lifestyle" decision.  Again by\n: your arguement, since homosexuals can not (or choose not) to reproduce they must\n: be akin to people who decide to have sex but not children.  Both are \n: as "unnatural" as each other.\n\nYet another non-sequitur. Sex is an evolutionary function that exists\nfor procreation, that it is also recreation is incidental. That\nhomosexuals don't procreate means that sex is -only- recreation and\nnothing more; they serve no -evolutionary- purpose.\n\n: \n: |> Since homosexuals have come out the closet and have convinced some\n: |> policy makers that they have civil rights, they are now claiming that\n: |> their sexuality is a preference, a life-style, an orientation, a\n: |> choice that should be protected by law.

I am not\ntelling anyone anything, I am demonstrating that there are arguments\nagainst the practice of homosexuality (providing it's a merely an\nalternate lifestlye) that are not homophobic, that one can reasonably\ncall it perverse in a context even a atheist can understand. I realize\nof course that this comes dangerously close to establishing  a value,\nand that atheists are compelled to object on that basis, but if you\nare to be consistent, you have no case in this regard.\n: \n: |> To characterize any opposition to homosexuality as homophobic is to\n: |> ignore some very compelling arguments against the legitimization of\n: |> the homosexual "life-style".

When the Quran uses the word *din* it means way of individual thinking, behaving,\ncommunal order and protocols based on a set of beliefs. This is often\ninterpreted as the much weaker term religion. \n\nThe atheists are not mentioned in the Quran along with Jews,\nMushriqin, Christians, etc. because the  latter are all din. To have a\ndin you need a set of beliefs, assumptions, etc, to forma a social\ncode. For example the Marxist have those, such as History, Conflict,\netc. That they do not put idols (sometimes they did) to represent\nthose assuptions  does not mean they are any different from the other\nMushriq, or roughly polytheists. \n\nThere cannot be social Atheism, because when there is a community,\nthat community needs common ideas or standard beliefs to coordinate \nthe society. When they inscribe assumptions, say Nation, or "Progress is \nthe natural consequence of Human activity" or "parlamentarian\ndemocracy is doubtlessly the best way of government", however \nthey individually insist they do not have gods, from the Quranic point\nof view they do. Therefore by definition, atheism does not exist. \n"We are a atheist society" in fact means "we reject the din other than\nours". \n\nAtheism can only exist when people reject all the idols/gods/dogmas/\nsuppositions/.. of the society that they part, and in that case that\nis a personal deviation of belief, and Quran tells about such\ndeviations and disbelief. But as I mentioned, from a Quranic point of\nlooking at things, there is no Atheism in the macro level. \n\nI think it took more than one minute.

No, Bobby.  Stalin killed millions in the name of Socialism.  Atheism was a\ncharacteristic of the Lenin-Stalin version of Socialism, nothing more.\nAnother characteristic of Lenin-Stalin Socialism was the centralization of\nfood distribution.  Would you therefore say that Stalin and Lenin killed\nmillions in the name of rationing bread?  Of course not.\n\n\n\nIn earlier posts you stated that true (Muslim) believers were incapable of\nevil.  I suppose if you believe that, you could reason that no one has ever\nbeen killed in the name of religion.  What a perfect world you live in,\nBobby.  \n\n\n\nBobby is referring to a rather obscure law in _The Good Atheist's \nHandbook_:\n\nLaw XXVI.A.3: Give that which you do not believe in a face.  \n\nYou must excuse us, Bobby.  When we argue against theism, we usually argue\nagainst the Christian idea of God.  In the realm of Christianity, man was\ncreated in God's image.

I see, it is not rational, but it is intellectual. Does madness qualify\nas intellectual engagement, too?\n \n \n \nExactly why science uses mathematics. QM representation in natural language\nis not supposed to replace the elaborate representation in mathematical\nterminology. Nor is it supposed to be the truth, as opposed to the\nrepresentation of gods or religions in ordinary language. Admittedly,\nnot  every religion says so, but a fancy side effect of their inept\nrepresentations are the eternal hassles between religions.\n \nAnd QM allows for making experiments that will lead to results that will\nbe agreed upon as being similar. Show me something similar in religion.\n \n \n \nWith the effect that the models presented are useless. And one can argue\nthat the other way around, namely that the only reason metaphysics still\nflourish is because it makes no statements that can be verified or falsified -\nshowing that it is bogus.

Well, it's obvious that you *don't* attempt, otherwise you would be aware\nthat they *don't* all "loudly [claim] to be the One True Christian".\n\nI've tried to avoid using the phrase "is/is not christian" because of these\nownership issues; instead, I've tried the phrase "Nicene christianity" in an\nattempt to identify the vast majority of "christianity" which has roughly\nsimilar viewpoints on the core theological issues.  The JWs do not fall\nwithin this group and in fact espouse a position known as Arianism, which is\nrejected by all the nicene churches and virtually everyone else as well.
.d.\n.d.\nI just thought of another one, in the Bible, so it's definately not because\nof *lack* of religion.  The Book of Esther (which I read the other day for\nother reasons) describes the origin of Pur'im, a Jewish celbration of joy\nand peace.  The long and short of the story is that 75,000 people were\nkilled when people were tripping over all of the peacefull solutions \nlying about (you couldn't swing a sacred cow without slammin into a nice,\npeaceful solution.)  'Course Joshua and the jawbone of an ass spring to\nmind...\n\nI agree with Bobby this far: religion as it is used to kill large numbers\nof people is usually not used in the form or manner that it was originally\nintended for.\n\nThat doesn't reduce the number of deaths directly caused by religion, it is\njust a minor observation of the fact that there is almost nothing pure in\nthe Universe.  The very act of honestly attempting to find true meaning in\nreligious teaching has many times inspired hatred and led to war.  Many\npeople have been led by religious leaders more involved in their own\nstomache-contentsthan in any absolute truth, and have therefore been driven to\nkill by their leaders.\n\nThe point is that there are many things involved in religion that often\nlead to war.  Whether these things are a part of religion, an unpleasant\nside effect or (as Bobby would have it) the result of people switching\nbetween Religion and Atheism spontaneously, the results are the same.  \n\n@Religious groups have long been involved in the majority of the bloodiest\nparts of Man's history.@\n\nAtheists, on the other hand (preen,preen) are typically not an ideological\nsocial caste, nor are they driven to organize and spread their beliefs.\nThe overuse of Nazism and Stalinism just show how true this is:  Two groups\nwith very clear and specific ideologies using religious persecution to\nfurther their means.  Anyone who cannot see the obvious - namely that these\nwere groups founded for reasons *entirely* their own, who used religious\npersecution not because of any belief system but because it made them more\npowerfull - is trying too hard.  Basically, Bobby uses these examples\nbecause there are so few wars that were *not* *specifically* fought over\nreligion that he does not have many choices.\n\nWell, I'm off to Key West where the only flames are heating the bottom of\nlittle silver butter-dishes.\n\n-ciao
Wow, you're quicker to point out heresy than the Church in the\nMiddle ages. Seriously though, even the Sheiks at Al-Azhar don't\nclaim that the Shi'ites are heretics. Most of the accusations\nand fabrications about Shi'ites come out of Saudi Arabia from the\nWahabis. For that matter you should read the original works of\nthe Sunni Imams (Imams of the four madhabs). The teacher of\nat least two of them was Imam Jafar Sadiq (the sixth Imam of the\nShi'ites).

: There are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread\n: that are a little confusing. An atheist is one for whom all things can\n: be understood as processes of nature - exclusively.\n\nThis definition does not include all atheists (see the FAQ). However,\nI (for one) do think there is no need to invoke any divine or\nspiritual explanations. \n\nIt makes a big difference to claim that all things can be understood\nas natural processes, and to claim that our observations do not\nrequire us to postulate any divine intervention, or anything spiritual,\nfor that matter. Humans are not omnipotent, and neither is science.\nHowever, science has one advantage theology doesn't: it is self-\ncorrecting, with nature as its judge. \n\nIt is delightful to see how scientific inquiry is revealing a self-\nconsistent, simple picture of our universe. Science is no longer\na bunch of separate branches, it is one. From particle physics to\npsychology. And no aspect of our life, or our universe, is safe\nfrom its stern and stony eye. Not even our consciousness.\n\n There is no need\n: for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is\n: no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by\n: physics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is\n: determnined.\n\nActually, determinism vs. indeterminism is a philosophical question,\nand science cannot say whether the whole thing is actually somehow\nsuperdeterministic or not. I think the question does not have\nany meaning, as far as individual human beings go. If their apparent\nfree will is an illusion, it does not appear to be so from their\nperspective. Bill, can you say _for sure_ whether you have a free\nwill or not? \n\n: This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all\n: its products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it\n: acquire intelligence, it's just a happy accident.\n\nMaybe. Who are we to tell? It seems intelligence is useful - when\nduring the history of Earth has _one species_ been able to control\none third of the whole biosphere? This can still be a result of \nnumerous happy accidents our genetic machinery blindly replicates\nand preserves. Even that machinery can be result of the same\nprinciple - only the systems that can start replicating will\nsurvive, those which don't don't make it. (Recommended reading: t.o)\n\n: For an atheist, no\n: event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less\n: value than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-\n: an event can have value. \n\nFrom whose perspective? I value events and things subjectively, from\nmy perspective. Nature does not have values, because it does not have\na perspective - values arise from awareness. If I have a subjective\nperspective, it is easy to assume that other people also do, and if\nI think about what it would it be like in their position, I will\neventually discover the Golden Rule. Morality is not necessarily\na gift from heavens, in fact, it may be a product of evolution.\nPerhaps we are aware of ourselves because a sense of identity\nis helpful, allows us to play the roles of others and make us respect\nothers who seem to have identity, too. \n\nBill, have you ever read Aristotle? Try his Ethica Nikomakhea (sp.)\nfor starters.\n\n: How then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing\n: the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On\n: what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It\n: seems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you\n: have to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what\n: in nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to\n: establish your values.\n\nC.S. Lewis tells us that this argument was the main reason why\nhe abandoned his atheism and became Christian. The argument is\nseverely flawed.\n\nSome values, such as the Golden Rule, can have a rational basis. Some\nothers, like the basic idea of wanting to live, has probably its\nroots in the way our brains are wired. Lewis ignored the very real\npossiblity that natural selection could also favour altruistic\nbehaviour, and morality as well. Indeed, as humans evolved better\nand better in building and using tools, they also became better\nat killing each other. It is a logical necessity that evolution could\nonly favour those who knew how to use tools, but not against one's\nown people.\n\nThe Bible reveals quite nicely that the morality of the early Jews\nwas not beyond this. A simple set of rules to hold the people\ntogether, under one god. Their god did not care much about people\nof other nations. \n\nAt the time of the NT, things were quite different - the Jews\nwere under rule of an _empire_, and could no longer simply ignore\nthe Gentiles. A new situation required a new morality, and along\nwith it a new religion was born. (A mutation in a meme pool.)\n\n: Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what\n: difference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or\n: otherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only\n: way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the\n: objection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn't like it\n: - that's it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer\n: that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries\n: no weight in any "absolute" sense.\n\nIt looks like you haven't bothered to read philosophy. Whenever there\nis an observer, there is a subjective point of view, which may \nvalue its existence and happiness (even if that were just a result\nof some physical event), and other's happiness, too, if the observer\ncomes to think about it. In an absolutely objective sense, that is,\nwithout any observers or subjects, moral judgments lose their\nmeaning. \n\nIt is not possible for a value to simply exist without a point of\nview. This includes gods, too, their values are only _their_ \npersonal judgments, not absolute truths, since such truths\ndo not exist. \n\nThe fact that most people do not deliberately want to hurt others\nis a manifestation of the way we have fought for our existence\nby becoming social beings who can think and value others'\nexistence.\n\nMorality is not property of humans alone - chimps, dolphins and\nmany other species show great care for each other. Dolphins have\nsometimes saved humans from drowning, a good deed indeed. \n\n: That you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God\n: or God's commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\n: nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\n: with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your\n: objections -seem- well founded is due to the way you've been\n: conditioned; there is no "truth" content. The whole of your\n: intellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.\n\nThe last statement does not logically follow. In fact, there is\nevery reason to believe our thoughts can model reality very\nwell, and our senses can convey reliable information. Solipsism\nis still a logical possibility, but not a very likely one.\n\nYou are continuously mixing two different views: the subjective\npoint of view (which we all share) and an objective point of view,\n_which does not exist_. Any observer or thinker, any personal being,\nhas its own point of view. It does not matter whether this point\nof view is a result of some physical events or not, it does not\ncease to be subjective. \n\nFrom a non-observers non-point of view, values do not exist. Neither\ndoes pain, or pleasure, or beauty, or love. Such things are \ninherently subjective. \n\nOnce again, if god wants wives to submit to their husbands, or even\nto make a leap of faith into the unknown, or wants to punish us if\nwe don't, I disagree with his morals. I do not think my morals come\nfrom any supreme being - to remove my morals means the same than\nto make me a zombie, a machine without a single thought. If god\ngave us morality to judge, but I disagree with him, it is not my\nfault. He is free to replace my morals. I cannot see what is the\npoint of giving someone a moral system which disagrees with one's\nown and then to get mad at this. \n\nGod must be schizophrenic.\n\n: All of this being so, you have excluded\n: yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,\n: etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no\n: weight whatsoever.\n\nNeither can the opinion of any god, for that matter. I cannot understand\nwhy a subjective opinion of a thing made of matter is in any way\nless credible than an opinion of a thing made of something else.\n\nBill, take note: Absolute values must be independent of _any_ being,\n_including_ gods. If god has a subjective viewpoint, it is his\nown point of view, and his morals are his own. \n\nPetri

No, Mathew is proposing a public defence mechanism, not treating the\nelectronic device as an impropriety on the wearer. What he is saying is that\nthe next step beyond what you propose is the permanent bugging of potential\ncriminals.  This may not, on the surface, sound like a bad thing, but who\ndefines what a potential criminal is? If the government of the day decides\nthat being a member of an opposition party makes you a potential criminal\nthen openly defying the government becomes a lethal practice, this is not\nconducive to a free society.\n\nMathew is saying that implanting electronic surveillance devices upon people\nis an impropriety upon that person, regardless of what type of crime or\nwhat chance of recidivism there is. Basically you see the criminal justice\nsystem as a punishment for the offender and possibly, therefore, a deterrant\nto future offenders. Mathew sees it, most probably, as a means of\nrehabilitation for the offender. So he was being cynical at you, okay?

Archive-name: atheism/logic\nAlt-atheism-archive-name: logic\nLast-modified: 5 April 1993\nVersion: 1.4\n\n                       Constructing a Logical Argument\n\nAlthough there is much argument on Usenet, the general quality of argument\nfound is poor.  This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to\nlogic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.\n\nLogic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [Concise\nOED].  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether\nit is correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course, one does not need to\nstudy logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic\nknowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an\nargument.\n\nNote that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally\napplicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merely\nexplains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is\nthe right tool for the job.\n\nPropositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A\nproposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, "It is\nraining" or "Today is Tuesday".  Propositions may be either asserted (said to\nbe true) or denied (said to be false).  Note that this is a technical meaning\nof "deny", not the everyday meaning.\n\nThe proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular\narrangement of words used to express it.  So "God exists" and "There exists a\nGod" both express the same proposition.\n\nAn argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, "a connected series of\nstatements to establish a definite proposition".  An argument consists of\nthree stages.\n\nFirst of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to\ncontinue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  They\nare the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions. \n\nPremises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as "because",\n"since", "obviously" and so on.  (The phrase "obviously" is often viewed with\nsuspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious\npremises.  If something doesn't seem obvious to you, don't be afraid to\nquestion it.  You can always say "Oh, yes, you're right, it is obvious" when\nyou've heard the explanation.)\n\nNext, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known\nas inference.  In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of\none or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms of\nvalid inference.\n\nThe propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further\ninference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as "implies that" or\n"therefore".\n\nFinally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which\nis affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are often\nindicated by phrases such as "therefore", "it follows that", "we conclude"\nand so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.\n\nFor example:\n\nEvery event has a cause (premise)\nThe universe has a beginning (premise)\nAll beginnings involve an event (premise)\nThis implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference)\nTherefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)\n\nNote that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another\nargument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with\nrespect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.\n\nSometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example,\nthe conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated \nafterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid, if \nsometimes a little confusing.\n\nRecognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or\nconclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever\nproducing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Some\nstatements look like arguments, but are not.  For example:\n\n"If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar,\n or the Son of God."\n\nThis is not an argument, it is a conditional statement.  It does not assert\nthe premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its \nconclusion.  (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we'll\ncome to those later.)\n\nAnother example:\n\n"God created you; therefore do your duty to God."\n\nThe phrase "do your duty to God" is not a proposition, since it is neither\ntrue nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an\nargument.\n\nFinally, causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form "A because\nB".  If we're interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence, the\nstatement is an argument.  If we're trying to establish the truth of B, then\nit is not an argument, it is an explanation.\n\nFor example:\n\n"There must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not\n start." -- This is an argument.\n\n"My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine."\n -- This is an explanation.\n\nThere are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive.  A\ndeductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions\n-- that is, an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must\nalso be true.  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  A valid\nargument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the\nconclusion is true.\n\nAn inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the\ntruth of the conclusion.  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid;\nhowever, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other\narguments, and about how probable their premises are.\n\nThere are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive\nnor inductive.  However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive\narguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.\n\nIt is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does\nnot imply that its conclusion holds.  This is because of the slightly \ncounter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more\ncarefully.\n\nObviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  However, an\nargument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions. \nFor example:\n\n   All insects have wings (premise)\n   Woodlice are insects (premise)\n   Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)\n\nHere, the conclusion is not true because the argument's premises are false. \nIf the argument's premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true. \nThe argument is thus entirely valid.\n\nMore subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises,\nas in:\n\n   All fish live in the sea (premise)\n   Dolphins are fish (premise)\n   Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)\n\nHowever, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid\ninference from true premises.  We can therefore draw up a "truth table" for\nimplication.\n\nThe symbol "=>" denotes implication; "A" is the premise, "B" the conclusion. \n"T" and "F" represent true and false respectively.\n\nPremise Conclusion Inference\n   A        B        A=>B\n----------------------------\n   F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference\n   F        T         T      valid, the conclusion can be true or false.\n\n   T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion\n                             false, the inference must be invalid.\n\n   T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid,\n                             the conclusion must be true.\n\nA sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  A sound \nargument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confuse\nvalid arguments with sound arguments.\n\nTo delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require\nlengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  It is simpler and probably\nmore useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing\nan argument.  These pitfalls are known as fallacies.\n\nIn everyday English the term "fallacy" is used to refer to mistaken beliefs\nas well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  This is fair\nenough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of\ntechnically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or\nconvincing.\n\nSo for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical\nargument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect\nwhen examined more closely.  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being\nmisled by them.  The following list of fallacies is not intended to be\nexhaustive.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)\n\nThe Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the\nthreat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  It\nis often used by politicians, and can be summarized as "might makes right". \nThe force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.\n\nFor example:\n"... Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those who\nrefuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell."\n\nARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM\n\nArgumentum ad hominem is literally "argument directed at the man".\n\nThe Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of trying\nto disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or\npeople making the assertion.  This is invalid because the truth of an\nassertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.\n\nFor example:\n"Atheism is an evil philosophy.  It is practised by Communists and murderers."\n\nSometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by \nshowing, for example, that he is a known perjurer.  This is a valid way of\nreducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not\nargumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witness's\ntestimony is false.  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the\nArgumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).\n\nThe circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person\nargues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of\nthe opponent's particular circumstances.\n\nFor example:\n"It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  How can you argue\notherwise when you're quite happy to wear leather shoes?"\n\nThis is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing\nthe opponent's argument.\n\nThis fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  For \nexample:\n\n"Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing. \nYou're white."\n\nThis particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one alleges that one's\nadversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is\nalso known as "poisoning the well".\n\nARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM\n\nArgumentum ad ignorantium means "argument from ignorance".  This fallacy\noccurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it\nhas not been proved false.  Or, equivalently, when it is argued that\nsomething must be false because it has not been proved true.  (Note that this\nis not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved\ntrue, a basic scientific principle.)\n\nExamples:\n"Of course the Bible is true.  Nobody can prove otherwise."\n\n"Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody has\nshown any proof that they are real."\n\nNote that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is\ngenerally assumed innocent until proven guilty.\n\nAlso, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce\ncertain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can \nvalidly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:\n\n"A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water\nto be present on the earth.  The earth does not have a tenth as much water,\neven if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  Therefore no\nsuch flood occurred."\n\nIn science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has\nnot occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred,\nhowever.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM\n\nThis is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading.  The fallacy is \ncommitted when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a \nconclusion accepted.  For example:\n\n"I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please don't find me\nguilty; I'm suffering enough through being an orphan."\n\nARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM\n\nThis is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People.  To\ncommit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by\nappealing to a large group of people.  This form of fallacy is often\ncharacterized by emotive language.  For example:\n\n"Pornography must be banned.  It is violence against women."\n\n"The Bible must be true.  Millions of people know that it is.  Are you trying\nto tell them that they are all mistaken fools?"\n\nARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM\n\nThis fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It consists of\nasserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more\nlikely it is that that proposition is correct.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM\n\nThe Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win\nsupport for an assertion.  For example:\n\n"Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God."\n\nThis line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference\nto an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a\ndiscussion of that subject.  For example, we can distinguish quite clearly\nbetween:\n\n"Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation"\nand\n"John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent\n computer"\n\nHawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black\nhole radiation to be informed.  Searle is a linguist, so it is questionable \nwhether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.\n\nTHE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT\n\nThe Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a\nparticular case whose "accidental" circumstances mean that the rule is\ninapplicable.  It is the error made when one goes from the general to the\nspecific.  For example:\n\n"Christians generally dislike atheists.  You are a Christian, so you must\ndislike atheists."\n\nThis fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide\nevery moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.\n\nCONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION\n\nThis fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occurs when one\nforms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not\nrepresentative of all possible cases.\n\nFor example:\n"Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christians are\ninsincere."\n\nSWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER\n\nA sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a\nparticular situation in which the features of that particular situation\nrender the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a\nhasty generalization.\n\nNON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\n\nThese are known as False Cause fallacies.\n\nThe fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the\ncause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  For \nexample:\n\n"I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared.  So God\ncured me of the headache."\n\nThe fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to\nbe the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  For \nexample:\n\n"The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism.  Therefore we must avoid\natheism for the same reasons."\n\nCUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\n\nThis fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It asserts that\nbecause two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves\nno room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.\n\nPETITIO PRINCIPII\n\nThis fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the\nconclusion reached.\n\nCIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO\n\nThis fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one\nwishes to reach.  Often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the\nfallacy appears to be a valid argument.  For example:\n\n"Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence any\ngovernment official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job. \nTherefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open\nto blackmail.  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government\noffice."\n\nNote that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the \nconclusion.  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason\nfor the British Secret Services' official ban on homosexual employees. \nAnother example is the classic:\n\n"We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so.  And we know that the\nBible is true because it is the word of God."\n\nCOMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION\n\nThis is the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example is the classic loaded \nquestion:\n\n"Have you stopped beating your wife?"\n\nThe question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not\neven been asked.  This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination,\nwhen they ask questions like:\n\n"Where did you hide the money you stole?"\n\nSimilarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:\n\n"How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?"\nor\n"Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?"\n\nIGNORATIO ELENCHI\n\nThe fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument \nsupports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do\nwith that conclusion.\n\nFor example, a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the\nteachings of Christianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argues at length\nthat Christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he\nargues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true.\n\nSadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse\nemotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more\nfavourable light.\n\nEQUIVOCATION\n\nEquivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different\nmeanings in the same argument.  For example:\n\n"What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that it\nremains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a\nlicense on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable."\n\nAMPHIBOLY\n\nAmphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because\nof careless or ungrammatical phrasing.\n\nACCENT\n\nAccent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  In this case,\nthe meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are\nemphasized.  For example, consider:\n\n"We should not speak ILL of our friends"\nand\n"We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS"\n\nFALLACIES OF COMPOSITION\n\nOne fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts\nof something must apply to the whole.  For example:\n\n"The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very \nlightweight."\n\nThe other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number\nof individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  For example:\n\n"A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  Therefore cars\nare less environmentally damaging than buses."\n\nFALLACY OF DIVISION\n\nThe fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Like\nits opposite, it exists in two varieties.  The first is to assume that a\nproperty of some thing must apply to its parts.  For example:\n\n"You are studying at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich."\n\nThe other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by\neach item.  For example:\n\n"Ants can destroy a tree.  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree."\n\nTHE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT\n\nThis argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful\nevents.  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the\nfirst event.\n\nFor example:\n"If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin\nand we'll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare.  Therefore we cannot\nlegalize marijuana."\n\n"A IS BASED ON B" FALLACIES / "IS A TYPE OF" FALLACIES\n\nThese fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way\nsimilar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.\n\nExamples:\n"Isn't history based upon faith?  If so, then isn't the Bible also a form of\nhistory?"\n\n"Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isn't Islam a\nform of Christianity?"\n\n"Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of\nanimal based on carbon chemistry, so aren't dogs a form of cat?"\n\nAFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT\n\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form "A implies B, B is true, therefore A\nis true".  To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for\nimplication given earlier.\n\nDENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT\n\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form "A implies B, A is false, therefore B\nis false".  Again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is\na fallacy.\n\nNote that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter has\nthe form "A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false", where A does NOT in\nfact imply B at all.  Here, the problem is not that the implication is\ninvalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce\nanything about B.\n\nCONVERTING A CONDITIONAL\n\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form "If A then B, therefore if B then A".\n\nARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM\n\nThis is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply\nbecause it is old, or because "that's the way it's always been."\n\nARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM\n\nThis is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of\nasserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer\nthan something else.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM\n\nThe fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those\nwith more money are more likely to be right.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM\n\nThe fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or\nmore virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This fallacy is the opposite of the\nargumentum ad crumenam.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM\n\nThis is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the\nmore often it is heard.  An "argumentum ad nauseum" is one that employs\nconstant repetition in asserting something.\n\nBIFURCATION\n\nAlso referred to as the "black and white" fallacy, bifurcation occurs when\none presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other\nalternatives exist or can exist.\n\nPLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONS\n\nThis fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex\nquestion.\n\nNON SEQUITUR\n\nA non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises\nwhich are not logically connected with it.\n\nRED HERRING\n\nThis fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue\nbeing discussed, so that everyone's attention is diverted away from the\npoints being made, towards a different conclusion.\n\nREIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION\n\nReification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.\n\nSHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF\n\nThe burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or\nproposition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad\nignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who\ndenies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is\nthe assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.\n\nSTRAW MAN\n\nThe straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else's position so that it\ncan be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position,\nthen to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  It is a\nfallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been\nmade.\n\nTHE EXTENDED ANALOGY\n\nThe fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general\nrule is being argued over.  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two \ndifferent situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a \nclaim that those situations are analogous to each other.\n\nThis fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about \nanti-cryptography legislation:\n\n"I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it."\n\n"Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported\n Martin Luther King."\n\n"Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the\n struggle for Black liberation?  How dare you!"\n\nTU QUOQUE\n\nThis is the famous "you too" fallacy.  It occurs when an action is argued to\nbe acceptable because the other party has performed it.  For instance:\n\n"You're just being randomly abusive."\n"So?  You've been abusive too."
# I hope I gave you a fairly solid answer to this one: I simply don't agree\n# with the embodied version of a Satan who is a separate creation or a force.\n\n\n\n# And there are quite physical descriptions of Heaven and Hell in the\n# Holy Qur'an, the Bible, etc.  There have been times in the spiritual\n# and intellectual evolution of the modern human when these physical\n# descriptions of Heaven, Hell, and Satan were taken quite literally\n# and that *worked* for the time.  As I mentioned in the Tradition\n# cited above, for example, it was sufficient in the absence of a theory\n# about germs and disease spread by worms to simply describe the "evil"\n# which was passed to a consumer of spoiled food as "satanic."\n\n     Which begs the question: if Satan in this case is\n     metaphorical, how can you be certain Allah is not\n     the same way?\n\n# The bottom line here, however, is that describing a spiritual plane\n# in human language is something like describing "color" to a person\n# who has been blind from birth.  You may want to read the book\n# FLATLAND (if you haven't already) or THE DRAGON'S EGG.  The first\n# is intended as a light hearted description of a mathematical con-\n# cept...\n\n[some deleted for space saving]\n\n# When language fails because it cannot be used to adequately describe\n# another dimension which cannot be experienced by the speakers, then\n# such conventions as metaphor, allegory, and the like come to be\n# necessary.  The "unseen" is described in terms which have reference`\n# and meaning for the reader/listener.  But, like all models, a compro-\n# mise must be made when speaking metaphorically: clarity and directness\n# of meaning, equivalence of perception, and the like are all\n# crippled.  But what else can you do?\n\n     This is why I asked the above.  How would you then\n     know God exists as a spirit or being rather than\n     just being metaphorical?  I mean, it's okay to say\n     "well, Satan is just metaphorical," but then you\n     have to justify this belief AND justify that God is\n     not some metaphor for something else.\n\n     I say this because there are many, many instances of\n     Satan described as a being (such as the tormentor in \n     the Old Testament book of Job, or the temptor in the\n     New Testament Gospels).  In the same way, God too is\n     described as a being (or spirit.)  How am I to know\n     one is metaphorical and not the other.\n\n     Further, belief in God isn't a bar to evil.  Let's\n     consider the case of Satanists: even if Satan were\n     metaphorical, the Satanist would have to believe\n     in God to justify this belief.  Again, we have a \n     case where someone does believe in God, but by\n     religious standards, they are "evil."  If Bobby\n     does see this, let him address this question also.\n\n[deleted some more on "metaphor"]\n\n\nStephen\n\n    _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/       _/    * Atheist\n   _/        _/    _/   _/ _/ _/ _/     * Libertarian\n  _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/   _/  _/      * Pro-individuality\n       _/  _/     _/  _/       _/       * Pro-responsibility\n_/_/_/_/  _/      _/ _/       _/ Jr.    * and all that jazz...
This kind of argument cries for a comment...\n\n\n \n: >>...God did not create\n: >>disease nor is He responsible for the maladies of newborns.\n: > \n: >>What God did create was life according to a protein code which is\n: >>mutable and can evolve.  Without delving into a deep discussion of\n: >>creationism vs evolutionism, God created the original genetic code\n: >>perfect and without flaw. \n: >  ~~~~~~~     ~~~~~~~ ~~~~\n\nDo you have any evidence for this? If the code was once perfect, and\nhas degraded ever since, we _should_ have some evidence in favour\nof this statement, shouldn't we?\n\nPerhaps the biggest "imperfection" of the code is that it is full\nof non-coding regions, introns, which are so called because they\nintervene with the coding regions (exons). An impressive amount of\nevidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin; it is\nlikely that early exons represented early protein domains.\n\nIs the number of introns decreasing or increasing? It appears that\nintron loss can occur, and species with common ancestry usually\nhave quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes. \n\nOn the other hand, the possibility that introns have been inserted\nlater, presents several logical difficulties. Introns are removed\nby a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present, but unused,\nif introns are inserted. Moreover, intron insertion would have\nrequired _precise_ targeting - random insertion would not be tolerated,\nsince sequences for intron removal (self-splicing of mRNA) are\nconserved. Besides, transposition of a sequence usually leaves a\ntrace - long terminal repeats and target - site duplications, and\nthese are not found in or near intron sequences. \n\nI seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and\ngenetics before posting "theological arguments" like this. \nTry Watson's Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell, Lodish\n& Baltimore's Molecular Biology of the Cell for starters.\n\n: Remember, the question was posed in a theological context (Why does\n: God cause disease in newborns?), and my answer is likewise from a\n: theological perspective -- my own.  It is no less valid than a purely\n: scientific perspective, just different.\n\nScientific perspective is supported by the evidence, whereas \ntheological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion.\n \n: I think you misread my meaning.  I said God made the genetic code perfect,\n: but that doesn't mean it's perfect now.  It has certainly evolved since.\n\nFor the worse? Would you please cite a few references that support\nyour assertion? Your assertion is less valid than the scientific\nperspective, unless you support it by some evidence.\n\nIn fact, it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps\nmore important than we've thought - for instance, sex might\nhave evolved as defence against parasites. (This view is supported by\ncomputer simulations of evolution, eg Tierra.) \n \n: Perhaps.  I thought it was higher energy rays like X-rays, gamma\n: rays, and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage.\n\nIn fact, it is thermal energy that does most of the damage, although\nit is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action. \n\n: Actually, neither of us "knows" what the atmosphere was like at the\n: time when God created life.  According to my recollection, most\n: biologists do not claim that life began 4 billion years ago -- after\n: all, that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth\n: was created.  It would still be too primitive to support life.  I\n: seem to remember a figure more like 2.5 to 3 billion years ago for\n: the origination of life on earth.  Anyone with a better estimate?\n\nI'd replace "created" with "formed", since there is no need to \ninvoke any creator if the Earth can be formed without one.\nMost recent estimates of the age of the Earth range between 4.6 - 4.8\nbillion years, and earliest signs of life (not true fossils, but\norganic, stromatolite-like layers) date back to 3.5 billion years.\nThis would leave more than billion years for the first cells to\nevolve.\n\nI'm sorry I can't give any references, this is based on the course\non evolutionary biochemistry I attended here. \n\n: >>dominion, it was no great feat for Satan to genetically engineer\n: >>diseases, both bacterial/viral and genetic.  Although the forces of\n: >>natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species, the\n: >>degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this.  \n\nAgain, do you _want_ this be true, or do you have any evidence for\nthis supposed "degeneration"? \n\nI can understand Scott's reaction:\n\n: > Excuse me, but this is so far-fetched that I know you must be\n: > jesting.  Do you know what pathogens are?  Do you know what \n: > Point Mutations are?  Do you know that EVERYTHING CAN COME\n: > ABOUT SPONTANEOUSLY?!!!!!  \n: \n: In response to your last statement, no, and neither do you.\n: You may very well believe that and accept it as fact, but you\n: cannot *know* that.\n\nI hope you don't forget this: We have _evidence_ that suggests \neverything can come about spontaneously. Do you have evidence against\nthis conclusion? In science, one does not have to _believe_ in \nanything. It is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve. But the \nright path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so,\nand not to present one's own conclusions prior to this. \n\nTheology does not use this method. Therefore, I seriously doubt\nit could ever come to right conclusions.\n\n: >>Human DNA, being more "complex", tends to accumulate errors adversely\n: >>affecting our well-being and ability to fight off disease, while the \n: >>simpler DNA of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in \n: >>causing infection and disease.  It is a bad combination.  Hence\n: >>we have newborns that suffer from genetic, viral, and bacterial\n: >>diseases/disorders.\n\nYou are supposing a purpose, not a valid move. Bacteria and viruses\ndo not exist to cause disease. They are just another manifests of\na general principle of evolution - only replication saves replicators\nfrom degradiation. We are just an efficient method for our DNA to \nsurvive and replicate. The less efficient methods didn't make it \nto the present. \n\nAnd for the last time.  Please present some evidence for your claim that\nhuman DNA is degrading through evolutionary processes. Some people have\nclaimed that the opposite is true - we have suppressed our selection,\nand thus are bound to degrade. I haven't seen much evidence for either\nclaim.\n \n: But then I ask, So?  Where is this relevant to my discussion in\n: answering John's question of why?  Why are there genetic diseases,\n: and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require\n: babies to develop antibodies.  Is it God's fault? (the original\n: question) -- I say no, it is not.\n\nOf course, nothing "evil" is god's fault.  But your explanation does\nnot work, it fails miserably.\n \n: You may be right.  But the fact is that you don't know that\n: Satan is not responsible, and neither do I.\n: \n: Suppose that a powerful, evil being like Satan exists.  Would it\n: be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills\n: that affect mankind?  I don't think so.\n\nHe could have done a much better Job. (Pun intended.) The problem is,\nit seems no Satan is necessary to explain any diseases, they are\njust as inevitable as any product of evolution.\n\n: Did I say that?  Where?  Seems to me like another bad inference.\n: Actually what you've done is to oversimplify what I said to the\n: point that your summary of my words takes on a new context.  I\n: never said that people are "meant" (presumably by God) "to be\n: punished by getting diseases".  Why I did say is that free moral\n: choices have attendent consequences.  If mankind chooses to reject\n: God, as people have done since the beginning, then they should not\n: expect God to protect them from adverse events in an entropic\n: universe.\n\nI am not expecting this. If god exists, I expect him to leave us alone.\nI would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed\nfree. This is an interesting philosophical question, and the answer\nis not as clear-cut as it seems to be.\n\nWhat consequences would you expect from rejecting Allah?\n  \n: Oh, I admit it's not perfect (yet).  But I'm working on it.  :)\n\nA good library or a bookstore is a good starting point.\n\n: What does this have to do with the price of tea in China, or the\n: question to which I provided an answer?  Biology and Genetics are\n: fine subjects and important scientific endeavors.  But they explain\n: *how* God created and set up life processes.  They don't explain\n: the why behind creation, life, or its subsequent evolution.\n\nWhy is there a "why behind"? And your proposition was something\nthat is not supported by the evidence. This is why we recommend\nthese books.\n\nIs there any need to invoke any why behind, a prime mover? Evidence\nfor this? If the whole universe can come into existence without\nany intervention, as recent cosmological theories (Hawking et al)\nsuggest, why do people still insist on this?\n \n: Thanks Scotty, for your fine and sagely advice.  But I am\n: not highly motivated to learn all the nitty-gritty details\n: of biology and genetics, although I'm sure I'd find it a\n: fascinating subject.  For I realize that the details do\n: not change the Big Picture, that God created life in the\n: beginning with the ability to change and adapt to its\n: environment.\n\nI'm sorry, but they do. There is no evidence for your big picture,\nand no need to create anything that is capable of adaptation.\nIt can come into existence without a Supreme Being.\n\nTry reading P.W.

(Deletion)\n \nFor me, it is a "I believe no gods exist" and a "I don't believe gods exist".\n \nIn other words, I think that statements like gods are or somehow interfere\nwith this world are false or meaningless. In Ontology, one can fairly\nconclude that when "A exist" is meaningless A does not exist. Under the\nPragmatic definition of truth, "A exists" is meaningless makes A exist\neven logically false.\n \nA problem with such statements is that one can't disprove a subjective god\nby definition, and there might be cases where a subjective god would even\nmake sense. The trouble with most god definitions is that they include\nsome form of objective existence with the consequence of the gods affecting\nall. Believers derive from it a right to interfere with the life of others.\n \n \n(Deletion)

: Mr Connor's assertion that "more complex" == later in paleontology\n: is simply incorrect.

Even those who have reason\nto believe they understand evolution (biologists for instance) tend to\npersonify nature and I can't help but wonder if it's because of the\nlimits of the language or the nature of nature.
Don't be so sure.  Look what happened to Japanese citizens in the US during\nWorld War II.

After all, it seems that the Nazis originally\nonly intended to imprison the Jews; the Final Solution was dreamt up partly\nbecause they couldn't afford to run the camps because of the devastation\ncaused by Goering's Total War.  Those who weren't gassed generally died of\nmalnutrition or disease.

It does\nnot say that it deters an individual from committing a capital crime\nin the first place.\n\nThe true question is whether the threat of death is likely to actually\nstop one from murdering.  (Or commiting treason -- are there any other\ncapital crimes anywhere in the USA?)  That is, if there were no death\npenalty, would its introduction deter a would-be criminal from\ncommitting her/his crime?  I doubt it.\n\nThis is only the first step.  Even if it were a strong deterrent\n(short of being a complete deterrent) I would reject it.  For what\nabout the case of the innocent executed?\n\nAnd even if we could eliminate this possibility, I would reject the\ndeath penalty as immoral. This makes me something of a radical on\nthe issue, although I think there are many opponents of captial\npunishment who agree with me, but who find the innocent executed the\nstrongest argument to make.\n\nI would, if magically placed in charge, facilitate state-aided suicide\nfor criminals who have life-sentences.  This could be a replacement\nfor capital punishment.  Those who don't want to live the rest of\ntheir lives in jail would always have this option.

The number of civilian Iraqi deaths were way over-exaggerated and \nexploited for anti-war emotionalism by the liberal news media.  The\nfacts are that less Iraqis died in the Gulf War than did civilians \nin any other war of comparable size this century!  This was due mostly\nto the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques\nwhich were technically possible only recently.\n\nThe idea that "hundreds of thousands" of Iraqi citizens died is\nludicrous.  Not even "hundreds of thousands" of Iraqi soldiers died,\nand they were the ones being targeted!  Or do you think that the US\nand its allies were specifically out to kill and maim Iraqi civilians?\nEither the smart bombs didn't hit their targets (and we know they did),\nor they were targeting civilian targets (!) which is hardly condusive to\ndestroying Iraq's military potential.  The military mission planners are\nnot fools, they know they have to hit *military* targets to win a war.\nHitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you,\nnot a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their\ntyrant-dictator. \n\nHow about all the innocent people who died in blanket-bombing in WW2?\nI don't hear you bemoaning them!  War is never an exact science, but\nwith smart bombs, it's becoming more exact with a smaller percentage\nof civilian casualties.  Sometimes mistakes are made; targets are\nmisidentified; innocents die.  That's war the way it really is.\nBut the alternative, to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth\nlike it's one big rummage sale, grabbing everything they can get is\nworse.  Like Patrick Henry said some 217 years ago, "I know not what\ncourse others may take -- but as for me, give me liberty, or give me\ndeath!"  War is always the price one must be willing to pay if one\nwishes to stay free.   \n\n\nMathew, your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off-base here.\nYou come off sounding like a complete peace-nik idiot, although I\nfeel sure that was not your intent.\n\nSo the Iraqi war was wrong, eh?  I'm sure that appeasement would have\nworked better than war, just like it did in WW2, eh?  I guess we\nshouldn't have fought WW2 either -- just think of all those innocent\nGerman civilians killed in Dresden and Hamburg.  How about all the poor \nFrench who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent?  We \nshould have just let Hitler take over Europe, and you'd be speaking\nGerman instead of English right now.\n\nTyrants like Hussein *have* to be stopped.  His kind don't understand\ndiplomacy; they only understand the point of a gun.  My only regret is\nthat Bush wimped out and didn't have the military roll into Baghdad, so\nnow Hussein is still in power and the Iraqi people's sacrifice (not to\nmention the 357 Americans who died) was for naught.  Liberating Kuwait \nwas a good thing, but wiping Hussein off the map would've been better!\n\nAnd as for poor, poor Rodney King!  Did you ever stop and think *why*\nthe jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of "not guilty"?\nThose who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those\npolicemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape.\nBut the jury looked at *all* the evidence, evidence which you and I\nhave not seen.  When one makes a judgment without the benefit of a\ntrial where evidence can be presented on both sides, one has simply\nlowered himself to the level of vigilante justice, a state-of-mind\nwhich your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against, but instead tends\nto support in the case against the policemen.  \n\nLaw in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused,\nwhether they be criminals or cops.  One is not found guilty if there is\na reasonable doubt of one's guilt, and only the jury is in a position\nto assess the evidence and render a verdict.  Anyone else is simply\nsuccumbing to verbal vigilantism.\n       \nRegards,
It was no criticism of Islam for a change, it was a criticism of the\narguments used.

Fred Rice answered this already in an early posting:\n"The problem with your argument is that you do not _know_ who is a _real_\nbeliever and who may be "faking it".  This is something known only by\nthe person him/herself (and God).  Your assumption that anyone who\n_claims_ to be a "believer" _is_ a "believer" is not necessarily true."\n\nIn other words it seems that nobody could define who is a true and\nfalse Muslim. We are back to square one, Khomeini and Hussein are \nstill innocent and can't be defined as evil or good Islamic \nworshippers.\n\nCheers,\nKent

+Last night, while watching the 2a.m. rebroadcast of Jerry Springer (a\n+talk show) I heard this Jewel of a thought from a 12 year old racist. \n+The focus of this show was on these kids and their hatred for the Jewish\n+religion, and why.  \n\n[some stuff deleted]\n\n+Interesting (and scary) no?  They went on to say how the Jews had \n+killed their god, and how in the end of time that all the races would\n+go to their homelands (of course, they would remain in America, which\n+is New Jeruselem, as it says in Gen 2??? (what another kid said) but\n+the rest of the races would go home) and then the great battle or plague\n+or whatever Revel. says would happen, and the jews would be killed.\n+\n+The most interesting thing about this was that my roomate is Catholic, \n+and had the KJV of the Bible on his desk.  He immediatly opened it up\n+and began to search for the quoted passages (Gen, Rev, and John) to \n+look for himself, and couldn't find what they said they saw.  I don't\n+know\n\nI saw this show a while back, and when I heard these kids\nquote the Bible to justify their racist claims, I looked up\nthat quote about Jesus hating Jews (since Jesus himself was a\nJew, my curiousity had been piqued by such a claim).\nThe jist of the passage (and I am sorry but I can't recall\nwhich passage it was exactly) was that Jesus was condemning\nthe Pharisees for being corrupt.\nOf course, the Pharisees were Jewish too, but it wasn't Jews\nas a whole that Jesus was condemning, just the powers that be.

: I wonder how many atheists out there care to speculate on the face of\n: the world  if atheists were the majority rather than the minority group\n: of the population. \n\nI've been thinking about this every now and then since I cut my ties\nwith Christianity. It is surprising to note that a large majority of\npeople, at least in Finland, seem to be apatheists - even though\n90 % of the population are members of the Lutheran Church of Finland,\nreligious people are actually a minority. \n\nCould it be possible that many people believe in god "just in case"?\nIt seems people do not want to seek the truth; they fall prey to Pascal's\nWager or other poor arguments. A small minority of those who do believe\nreads the Bible regularly. The majority doesn't care - it believes,\nbut doesn't know what or how. \n\nPeople don't usually allow their beliefs to change their lifestyle,\nthey only want to keep the virtual gate open. A Christian would say\nthat they are not "born in the Spirit", but this does not disturb them.\nReligion is not something to think about. \n\nI'm afraid a society with a true atheist majority is an impossible\ndream. Religions have a strong appeal to people, nevertheless - \na promise of life after death is something humans eagerly listen to.\nCoupled with threats of eternal torture and the idea that our\nmorality is under constant scrutiny of some cosmic cop, too many\npeople take the poison with a smile. Or just pretend to swallow\n(and unconsciously hope god wouldn't notice ;-) )\n\n: Also, how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a\n: higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking.  The\n: typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the\n: same inherent motivation, so one is not, intrinsically, different from the\n: other, qualitatively.  But then again a measuring stick must be drawn\n: somewhere, and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core,\n: than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery; ie, how it\n: expresses its own selfishness.\n\nIf logic and reason are valued, then I would claim that atheistic thinking\nis of higher value than the theistic exposition. Theists make unnecessary\nassumptions they believe in - I've yet to see good reasons to believe\nin gods, or to take a leap of faith at all. A revelation would do.\n\nHowever, why do we value logic and reasoning? This questions bears\nsome resemblance to a long-disputed problem in science: why mathematics\nworks? Strong deep structuralists, like Atkins, have proposed that\nperhaps, after all, everything _is_ mathematics. \n\nIs usefulness any criterion?\n\nPetri

: Exodus 21:22-25:\n\n:        22 And if men struggle with each other and strike a woman with\n:           child so that she has a miscarriage, yet there is no further\n:           injury, he shall surely be fined as the woman's husband may\n:           demand of him; and he shall pay as the judges decide.\n:        23 But if there is any further injury, then you shall appoint\n:           as a penalty life for life,\n:        24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,\n:        25 burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.\n\n: The most straightforward interpretation of these verses is that if\n: men in a fight strike a woman and cause her to miscarry, the penalty\n: is only a fine.  If, however, the woman is injured or dies, the\n: *lex talionis* doctrine of "an eye for an eye" applies.  This is the\n: Jewish interpretation, and is supported by Jewish commentaries on\n: these verses.\n:    This is quite an embarrassment for pro-lifer Christians, so there is\n: of course an alternate explanation.  The alternative interprets the\n: word "miscarriage" to mean "premature birth"--i.e., the child is born\n: alive--and "further injury" to mean injury to either the woman or\n: the fetus.  This is not a straightforward interpretation, it is not\n: (so far as I know) supported by any Jewish commentaries, and it does\n: not appeared to be supported by any other part of the Bible.\n\nWhat if any, historical reference do we have to abortion at this time?  Did\nthe ancient Jew have appropriate reference to understand abortion? (I am\ntruly asking, not making a point veiled as a question).  If there is \nlittle understanding of the medical procedure we know as abortion, it is\nnot surprising the Bible makes little reference to it, as it makes little\nreference to nuclear power and contamination.
: The Bible says there is a God; if that is true then our atheism is\n: mistaken.  What of it?  Seems pretty obvious to me.  Socrates said\n: there were many gods; if that is true then your monotheism (and our\n: atheism) is mistaken, even if Socrates never existed.\n\n\nJim,\n\nI think you must have come in late. The discussion (on my part at\nleast) began with Benedikt's questioning of the historical acuuracy of\nthe NT. I was making the point that, if the same standards are used to\nvalidate secular history that are used here to discredit NT history,\nthen virtually nothing is known of the first century.\n\nYou seem to be saying that the Bible -cannot- be true because it\nspeaks of the existence of God as it it were a fact. Your objection\nhas nothing to do with history, it is merely another statement of\natheism.
##I strongly suggest that you look up a book called THE BIBLE, THE QURAN, AND\n##SCIENCE by Maurice Baucaille, a French surgeon.  It is not comprehensive,\n##but, it is well researched.  I imagine your library has it or can get it\n##for you through interlibrary loan.\n##\n\n  I shall try to get hold of it (when I have time to read of course :-)\n\n##In short, Dr Baucaille began investigating the Bible because of pre-\n##ceived scientific inaccuracies and inconsistencies.  He assumed that\n##some of the problems may have been caused by poor translations in by-\n##gone days.  So, he read what he could find in Hebrew, Greek, Aramaic.\n##What he found was that the problems didn't go away, they got worse.\n##Then, he decided to see if other religions had the same problems.\n##So, he picked up the Holy Qur'an (in French) and found similar prob-\n##lems, but not as many.  SO, he applied the same logoic as he had\n##with the Bible: he learned to read it in Arabic.  The problems he\n##had found with the French version went away in Arabic.  He was unable\n##to find a wealth of scientific statements in the Holy Qur'an, but,\n##what he did find made sense with modern understanding.  So, he\n##investigated the Traditions (the hadith) to see what they had to\n##say about science.  they were filled with science problems; after\n##all, they were contemporary narratives from a time which had, by\n##pour standards, a primitive world view.  His conclusion was that,\n##while he was impressed that what little the Holy Qur'an had to\n##say about science was accurate, he was far more impressed that the\n##Holy Qur'an did not contain the same rampant errors evidenced in\n##the Traditions.  How would a man of 7th Century Arabia have known\n##what *not to include* in the Holy Qur'an (assuming he had authored\n##it)?  \n##\n\n    So in short the writer (or writers) of Quran decided to stay away from\nscience.  (if you do not open your mouth, then you don't put you foot into\nyour mouth either). \n\n   But then if you say Quran does not talk much about science, then one can\nnot make claims (like Bobby does) that you have great science in Quran.\n\n   Basically I want to say that *none* of the religious texts are supposed to\nbe scientific treatises. So I am just requesting the theists to stop making\nsuch wild claims.\n\n--- Vinayak\n-------------------------------------------------------\n                                           vinayak dutt\n                                   e-mail: vdp@mayo.edu\n\n             standard disclaimers apply

This is becoming a tiresome statement.  Coming from you it is \na definition, not an assertion:\n\n   Islam is good.  Belief in Islam is good.  Therefore, being a \n   believer in Islam can produce only good...because Islam is\n   good. Blah blah blah.\n\nThat's about as circular as it gets, and equally meaningless.  To\nsay that something produces only good because it is only good that \nit produces is nothing more than an unapplied definition.  And\nall you're application is saying that it's true if you really \nbelieve it's true.  That's silly.\n\nConversely, you say off-handedly that _anything_ can happen under\natheism.  Again, just an offshoot of believe-it-and-it-becomes-true-\ndon't-believe-it-and-it-doesn't.  \n\nLike other religions I'm aquainted with, Islam teaches exclusion and\ncaste, and suggests harsh penalties for _behaviors_ that have no\nlogical call for punishment (certain limits on speech and sex, for\nexample).  To me this is not good.  I see much pain and suffering\nwithout any justification, except for the _waving of the hand_ of\nsome inaccessible god.\n\nBy the by, you toss around the word knowledgable a bit carelessly.\nFor what is a _knowledgeable believer_ except a contradiction of\nterms.  I infer that you mean believer in terms of having faith.\nAnd If you need knowledge to believe then faith has nothing\nto do with it, does it?
I find these to be intriguing remarks.   Could you give us a bit\nmore explanation here?   For example, which religion is anti-semitic,\nand which aesthetic?
Actually, my atheism is based on ignorance.  Ignorance of the\n  existence of any god.  Don't fall into the "atheists don't believe\n  because of their pride" mistake.\n\n\n/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\ \n\nBob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM \n\nThey said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away,\nand sank Manhattan out at sea.
[...stuff deleted...]\n\nComputers are an excellent example...of evolution without "a" creator.\nWe did not "create" computers.  We did not create the sand that goes\ninto the silicon that goes into the integrated circuits that go into\nprocessor board.  We took these things and put them together in an\ninteresting way. Just like plants "create" oxygen using light through \nphotosynthesis.  It's a much bigger leap to talk about something that\ncreated "everything" from nothing.  I find it unfathomable to resort\nto believing in a creator when a much simpler alternative exists: we\nsimply are incapable of understanding our beginnings -- if there even\nwere beginnings at all.  And that's ok with me.  The present keeps me\nperfectly busy.
It can be painless, so it isn't cruel.  And, it has occurred frequently\nsince the dawn of time, so it is hardly unusual.\n\n\nBut, innocents die due to many causes.  Why have you singled out\naccidental or false execution as the one to take issue with?
Of course B.M. is not incorrect.  He is defending Islam.  When defending\nIslam against infidels you can say anything and no one will dare criticize\nyou.  But when an atheist uses the same argument he is using "petty sarcasm".  So\nB.M. can have his "temporary atheists" whenever he needs them and all the\n"temporary atheists" can later say that they were always good Muslims because\nthey never explicitly rejected Islam.
I hope you're not going to flame him.  Please give him the same coutesy you'\nve given me.

It sounds to me like it's just SCREAMING OUT for parody.

I could give much the same testimonial about my experience as a scout\nback in the 1960s. The issue wasn't gays, but the principles were the\nsame. Thanks for a well put testimonial. Stan Krieger and his kind who\nthink this discussion doesn't belong here and his intolerance is the\nonly acceptable position in scouting should take notice. The BSA has\nbeen hijacked by the religious right, but some of the core values have\nsurvived in spite of the leadership and some scouts and former scouts\nhaven't given up. Seeing a testimonial like this reminds me that\nscouting is still worth fighting for.\n\nOn a cautionary note, you must realize that if your experience with this\ncamp leader was in the BSA you may be putting him at risk by publicizing\nit. Word could leak out to the BSA gestapo.
Your posting provoked me into checking my save file for memorable\nposts. The first I captured was by Ken Arromdee on 19 Feb 1990, on the\nsubject "Re: atheist too?". That was article #473 here; your question\nwas article #53766, which is an average of about 48 articles a day for\nthe last three years. As others have noted, the current posting rate is\nsuch that my kill file is depressing large...... Among the posting I\nsaved in the early days were articles from the following notables:\n\n\nAn interesting bunch.... I wonder where #2 is?
: When the object of their belief is said to be perfect and make the believers\n: act in a certain way and we observe that they don't, we have a contradiction.\n: Something defined contradictorily cannot exist. That what the believe in does\n: not exist. Secondly, there are better explanations for why they believe than\n: the existence of the object of their belief.\n:  \n:  \n: Have you read the FAQ already?\n:    Benedikt\n\nBenedikt,\n\nI can't recall anyone claiming that God -makes- anyone act a particlar\nway, I think that you're attempting to manufacture a contradiction.\nGod is said to require certain behavior, but the only compulsion is\nthe believer's sense of duty. A standard of conduct does exist, but we\nare free to ignore it or misunderstand it or distort it in whatever\nways we find convenient, but our response to God's edicts can in no\nway be used to question God's existence. The behavior of believers is\na completely separate question from that of God's existence; there is\nnothing contradictory here.\n\nTo say that something defined contadictorily cannot exist, is really\nasking too much; you would have existence depend on grammar. All you\ncan really say is that something is poorly defined, but that in itself\nis insufficient to decide anything (other than confusion of course).\n\nYour point that there are better reasons for the phenomenon of belief\nthan the object of belief may lead to a rat's nest of unnecessary\ncomplexity. I think I know what you're implying, but I'd like to see\nyour version of this better alternative just the same.
I have a request for those who would like to see Charley Wingate\nrespond to the "Charley Challenges" (and judging from my e-mail, there\nappear to be quite a few of you.)  \n\nIt is clear that Mr. Wingate intends to continue to post tangential or\nunrelated articles while ingoring the Challenges themselves.  Between\nthe last two re-postings of the Challenges, I noted perhaps a dozen or\nmore posts by Mr. Wingate, none of which answered a single Challenge.  \n\nIt seems unmistakable to me that Mr. Wingate hopes that the questions\nwill just go away, and he is doing his level best to change the\nsubject.  Given that this seems a rather common net.theist tactic, I\nwould like to suggest that we impress upon him our desire for answers,\nin the following manner:\n\n1. Ignore any future articles by Mr. Wingate that do not address the\nChallenges, until he answers them or explictly announces that he\nrefuses to do so.\n\n--or--\n\n2. If you must respond to one of his articles, include within it\nsomething similar to the following:\n\n    "Please answer the questions posed to you in the Charley Challenges."\n\nReally, I'm not looking to humiliate anyone here, I just want some\nhonest answers.  You wouldn't think that honesty would be too much to\nask from a devout Christian, would you?  \n\nNevermind, that was a rhetorical question.

I agree, I reckon it's television and the increase in fundamentalism.. You\nthink its the increase in pre-marital sex... others thinks its because\npsychologists have taken over the criminal justice system and let violent\ncriminals con them into letting them out into the streets... others think\nit's the increase in designer drugs... others think it's a communist plot.\nBasically the social interactions of all the changing factors in our society\nare far too complicated for us to control. We just have to hold on to the\npanic handles and hope that we are heading for a soft landing. But one\nthings for sure, depression and the destruction of the nuclear family is not\ndue solely to sex out of marriage.\n\nJeff.
Not any more so than\n\n      holding people against their will is wrong\n      if you hold people against their will we will punish you\n      our punishment will be to hold you against your will\n\nIs there any punishment which isn't something which, if done by a private\nperson to another private person for no apparent reason, would lead to\npunishment?

That's right.  Humans have gone somewhat beyond this though.  Perhaps\nour goal is one of self-actualization.\n\n\nNow you are letting an omniscient being give information to me.  This\nwas not part of the original premise.\n\n\nWhich type of morality are you talking about?  In a natural sense, it\nis not at all immoral to harm another species (as long as it doesn't\nadversely affect your own, I guess).
That's the craziest thing I ever heard.   Are you serious?\n\n	"it doesn't take much work to be moral?"\n\n\nReally?   And that's why people discuss morality on a daily basis?\nBecause it's a kind of evolutionary hangover, like your little toe?\n\n\nThis must be some novel use of the phrase "based on" with which I\nam not sufficiently familiar.    What do you mean by "based on" and \nwhat is the significance of it for your argument?\n\n\nWell, we can.   What would you like to know about my particular moral\nbeliefs?\n\nIf you raise a topic I've never considered, I'll be quite happy to \ninvent a moral belief out of thin air.
This book is worth a read to get a sensible view of this issue.\n\n\nThe book is in two sections.  Section 1 contains a fairly reasonable\nanalysis of the Bible, showing many inconsistencies between the Bible\nand modern science.  Well we all know that, no surprises.\n\nSection 2 analyses the Koran's version of the Old Testament stories,\nand seems, on the face of it, to present a good case showing the Koran\nis consistent with modern science.  However, it was plain to me, that\nthis consistency was only possible by the vague phraseology of the\nKoran.  Take the flood, for example, the bible is full of detail,\n("forty days and forty nights", "pair of every animal", etc.), we all\nknow this is nonsense.  The Koran's description of the same event is\nso obscure as to make possible an interpretation such as "A big river \nflooded for a few days and caused much damage".  Yes, no contradiction\nbut also not much fact.\n\nThe Koran might be consistent with modern science, but being\nconsistent due to its vagueness compared with other books of that\ntime, does not seem much of an achievement.\n\nThe book concludes by saying something like, the Koran must have had\ndivine inspiration because at the time it was written there were a lot\nof (to us now) ridiculous ideas about the universe, and none of them\ncan be found in the Koran!  Arguing for the greatness of a book by\ntalking about what it does not contain seems absurd in the extreme.\n\nThe above is, of course, from memory so I may have missed some points.\n\n\n\n--
I guess that's why scientists probably aren't mentioned either.  Or\nstock brokers.  Or television repairmen.  \n\nIt's precious to know just how deep the brainwashing from childhood\n( that it takes to progress a religion ) cleans away a very substantial\npart of the reasoning neurons.\n\nBut don't mind me;  I don't exist.
Well, that's the question, isn't it?  The goals are probably not all that\nobvious.  We can set up a few goals, like happiness and liberty and\nthe golden rule, etc.  But these goals aren't inherent.  They have to\nbe defined before an objective system is possible.\n\n\nIt is not too difficult, one you have goals in mind, and absolute\nknoweldge of everyone's intent, etc.\n\n\nOmniscience is fine, as long as information is not given away.  Isn't\nthis the resolution of the free will problem?  An interactive omniscient\nbeing changes the situation.\n\n\nWell, I was speaking about an objective system in general.  I didn't\nmention a specific goal, which would be necessary to determine the\nmorality of an action.
The argument goes as follows: Q-oid quotes appear in John, but not in\nthe almost codified way they were in Matthew or Luke. However, they are\nconsidered to be similar enough to point to knowledge of Q as such, and\nnot an entirely different source.\n \n \n \nWe are talking date of texts here, not the age of the authors. The usual\nexplanation for the time order of Mark, Matthew and Luke does not consider\ntheir respective ages. It says Matthew has read the text of Mark, and Luke\nthat of Matthew (and probably that of Mark).\n \nAs it is assumed that John knew the content of Luke's text. The evidence\nfor that is not overwhelming, admittedly.\n \n \n \nWhen they are from about 200, why do they shed doubt on the order on\nputting John after the rest of the three?\n \n \n \nSure, an original together with Id card of sender and receiver would be\nfine. So what's that supposed to say? Am I missing something?\n \n \n \nThat John was a disciple is not generally accepted. The style and language\ntogether with the theology are usually used as counterargument.\n \nThe argument that John was a disciple relies on the claim in the gospel\nof John itself. Is there any other evidence for it?\n \nOne step and one generation removed is bad even in our times. Compare that\nto reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies.\nNot even to speak off that believers are not necessarily the best sources.\n \n \nIn other words, one does not know what the original of Mark did look like\nand arguments based on Mark are pretty weak.

I disagree: every proposition needs a certain amount of evidence \nand support, before one can believe it. There are a miriad of factors for \neach individual. As we are all different, we quite obviously require \ndifferent levels of evidence.\n\n	As one pointed out, one's history is important. While in FUSSR, one \nmay not believe a comrade who states that he owns five pairs of blue jeans. \nOne would need more evidence, than if one lived in the United States. The \nonly time such a statement here would raise an eyebrow in the US, is if the \nindividual always wear business suits, etc.\n\n	The degree of the effect upon the world, and the strength of the \nclaim also determine the amount of evidence necessary. When determining the \nlevel of evidence one needs, it is most certainly relevent what the \nconsequences of the proposition are.\n\n\n\n	If the consequences of a proposition is irrelvent, please explain \nwhy one would not accept: The electro-magnetic force of attraction between \ntwo charged particles is inversely proportional to the cube of their \ndistance apart. \n\n	Remember, if the consequences of the law are not relevent, then\nwe can not use experimental evidence as a disproof. If one of the \nconsequences of the law is an incongruency between the law and the state of \naffairs, or an incongruency between this law and any other natural law, \nthey are irrelevent when theorizing about the "Truth" of the law.\n\n	Given that any consequences of a proposition is irrelvent, including \nthe consequence of self-contradiction or contradiction with the state of \naffiars, how are we ever able to  judge what is true or not; let alone find\n"The Truth"?\n\n\n\n	By the way, what is "Truth"? Please define before inserting it in \nthe conversation. Please explain what "Truth" or "TRUTH" is. I do think that \nanything is ever known for certain. Even if there IS a "Truth", we could \nnever possibly know if it were. I find the concept to be meaningless.\n\n--\n\n\n       "Satan and the Angels do not have freewill.  \n        They do what god tells them to do. "
: \n[ . . . . . ]\n:\n: Personally, I feel that since religion have such a poweful\n: psychological effect, we should let theists be.  But the problem is that\n: religions cause enormous harm to non-believers and to humanity as a whole\n: (holy wars, inquisitions, inter-religious hatred, impedence of science\n: & intellectual progress, us-&-them attitudes etc etc.  Need I say more?).\n: I really don't know what we can do about them.  Any comments?\n: \n\n  I have always held that there should be no attempt to change a persons\nattitude or lifestyle as long as it makes them happy and does not tax\nanybody else. This seems to be ok for atheists. You don't get an atheist\nknocking on your door, stopping you in the airport, or handing out\nliterature at a social event. Theists seem to think that thier form of\nhappy should work for others and try to make it so. \n\n  My sister is a \nborn again, and she was a real thorn in the side for my entire family\nfor several years. She finally got the clue that she couldn't help.\nDuring that period she bought me "I was atheist, now I'm Xtian" books\nfor my birthday and Xmas several times. Our birthday cards would contain\nverses. It was a problem. I told my mom that I was going to send my\nsister an atheist piece of reading material. I got a "Don't you dare".\nMy mom wasn't religious. Why did she insist that I not send it ??\n\n   Because our society has driven into us that religion is ok to\npreach, non-religion should be self contained. What a crock of shit.\nI finally told my sister that I didn't find her way of life attractive.\nI have seen exactly 0 effort from her on trying to convert me since then.\n\n   I'm sick of religious types being pampered, looked out for, and WORST\nOF ALL . . . . respected more than atheists.

That's not true.    I gave you two examples.   One was the rather\npevasive anti-semitism in German Christianity well before Hitler\narrived.   The other was the system of social ranks that were used\nin Imperail Germany and Austria to distinguish Jews from the rest \nof the population.\n\nNeither of these were very terrible in themselves, but both helped\nto set a psychology in which the gradual disenfranchisement of Jews\nwas made easier.
#In <1qvabj$g1j@horus.ap.mchp.sni.de> frank@D012S658.uucp (Frank O'Dwyer) \n#\n#>In article <C5qGM3.DL8@news.cso.uiuc.edu> cobb@alexia.lis.uiuc.edu (Mike \n#\n#Am I making a wrong assumption for the basis of morals?  Where do they come \n#from?  The question came from the idea that I heard that morals come from\n#whatever is societally mandated.\n\nIt's only one aspect of morality.  Societal morality is necessarily\nvery crude and broad-brush stuff which attempts to deal with what\nis necessary to keep that society going  - and often it's a little\nover-enthusiastic about doing so.  Individual morality is a different\nthing, it often includes societal mores (or society is in trouble),\nbut is stronger.  For example, some people are vegetarian, though eating\nmeat may be perfectly legal.\n\n#\n#>#Merely a question for the basis of morality\n#>#\n#>#Moral/Ethical behavior = _Societally_ _acceptable_ _behavior_.\n#>#\n#>#1)Who is society\n#\n#>Depends on the society.\n#\n#Doesn't help.  Is the point irrelevant?\n\nNo.  Often the answer is "we are".  But if society is those who make\nthe rules, that's a different question.  If society is who should\nmake the rules, that's yet another.  I don't claim to have the answers, either,\nbut I don't think we do it very well in Ireland, and I like some things\nabout the US system, at least in principle.\n\n#\n#>#2)How do "they" define what is acceptable?\n#\n#>Depends.\n#On....  Again, this comes from a certain question (see above).\n\nWell, ideally they don't, but if they must they should do it by consensus, IMO.\n#\n#>#3)How do we keep from a "whatever is legal is what is "moral" "position?\n#\n#>By adopting a default position that people's moral decisions\n#>are none of society's business,\n#\n#So how can we put people in jail? How can we condemn other societies?\n\nBecause sometimes that's necessary.  The hard trick is to recognise when\nit is, and equally importantly, when it isn't.\n\n# and only interfering when it's truly\n#>necessary.\n#\n#Why would it be necessary?  What right do we have to interfere?\n\nIMO, it isn't often that interference (i.e. jail, and force of various\nkinds and degrees) is both necessary and effective.  Where you derive \nthe right to interfere is a difficult question - it's a sort of\nliar's paradox: "force is necessary for freedom".   One possible justification\nis that people who wish to take away freedom shouldn't object if\ntheir own freedom is taken away - the paradox doesn't arise if\nwe don't actively wish to take way anyone's freedom.\n#\n#  The introduction of permissible interference causes the problem\n#>that it can be either too much or too little - but most people seem\n#>to agree that some level of interference is necessary.\n#\n#They see the need for a "justice" system.  How can we even define that term?\n\nOnly by consensus, I guess.\n\n#  Thus you\n#>get a situation where "The law often allows what honour forbids", which I've\n#>come to believe is as it should be.  \n#\n#I admit I don't understand that statement.\n\nWhat I mean is that, while thus-and-such may be legal, thus-and-such may\nalso be seen as immoral.   The law lets you do it, but you don't let yourself\ndo it.  Eating meat, for example.
False dichotomy.  You claimed the killing were *not* religiously\nmotivated, and I'm saying that's wrong.   I'm not saying that\neach and every killing is religiously motivate, as I spelled out\nin detail.\n\n\n\nDoes anyone else see the contradiction in this paragraph?\n\n\n\nSorry, Frank, but what I put in quotes is your own words from your\nposting <1qi83b$ec4@horus.ap.mchp.sni.de>.  Don't tell us now that \nit's a different claim.   If you can no longer stand behind your \noriginal claim, just say so.
They spent quite a bit of time on the wording of the Constitution.  They\npicked words whose meanings implied the intent.  We have already looked\nin the dictionary to define the word.  Isn't this sufficient?\n\n\nBut we were discussing it in relation to the death penalty.  And, the\nConstitution need not define each of the words within.  Anyone who doesn't\nknow what cruel is can look in the dictionary (and we did).
I assume you are posting to encourage comments - how much history has\nTony Campello read?  Not much it seems. \n\n\nIt is good to hear that there are a few reasonable Christians about.\nIf only those christian "scientists" would take note.\n\n(In Australia there is a very strong movement, a bunch of christian \nscientists who believe that every single event in the bible is exactly\ntrue, and that there is a rational explanation for it all that can be justified\nby using the laws of physics.  For example, there are a few chaps who are \ntrying to prove that the age of the universe is 6000 years old, and that the\nerror in conventional calculations is the result of the fact that the speed \nlight has been rapidly decaying over the years, and this has not been \naccounted for. :-] )\n\n\nOr (of course), that he never existed, and the bible was a story, and was never \nintended to become a manifesto for a billion people.  Did Tony follow that one\nup?\n\n\nMillions of people have "died for a lie".  This  point is difficult to \nsubstantiate since it is not well defined (a great many religious arguments\nwork in that way), but consider the many Aztec warriors who sacrificed \nthemselves to their gods in the belief that this act would bring them victory\nof the Spanish invaders.  The list is endless.  The Aztecs lost, BTW.\n\n  \nThat is perfectly reasonable, but it is not grounds for me (or anyone)\nto become a christian.  More to the point, it does not add weight to\nthe claim that Jesus was the "real thing".\n\n\n\nHave you ever seen a documentary about the rise of Nazi Germany?  More to the\npoint, did Tony mention this?  One could hardly call Werner Heisenberg and his\nmany colleagues  fools, or  illogical men, their support of Hitler was based \n(I presume) upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with \nhis principles.  Obviously my argument is invalid if Tony thought that Hitler\nwas sane....\n\n \n\n\nHmmm.... I don't think his arguments warrant the use of a "Therefore..."\n\n\nThis is (unfortunately) what alot of religious discussions I have had with\npeople result in - quoting the bible.  The only reasonable way I think\npeople can look at the bible is to treat the stories as some sort of\nmetaphorical representation of the messages that the authors were trying to\npresent.  If someone tries to interpret parts of the bible literally, he or\nshe will end up in all sorts of shit.   \n\nTony's argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe\nthe events described in the bible took place, but to convince someone, \nwho thinks the bible is total fiction, that Jesus is real by quoting the\nbook is totally pointless.  For example, in mathematics you cannot say "a is\nequal to b because a is equal to b".\n\n  \n\n\nThat would possibly explain why there have so many people being killed \nin religious wars, and why there are hundreds of different versions all\nclaiming to be correct.  \n\nIt \n\nI think if you posted this part to alt.religion you would get more flames\nthan here :-).  I have never really understood why the emotional sentiments\nof a stranger should be of interest to other people. \n\nSomeone famous said that there two evils in life, polititians and churchs, one\nrules by fear of the living, the other by fear of the dead.  If I am pressed I\ncould probably find the exact quotation.

[reply to zazen@austin.ibm.com (E. H. Welbon)]\n \n \n \n \nFor many atheists, the lack of belief in gods is secondary to an\nepistemological consideration:  what do we accept as a reliable way of\nknowing?  There are no known valid logical arguments for the existence\nof gods, nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist.  Most\nphilosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that\nmust be accepted on faith.  Faith is belief without a sound logical\nbasis or empirical evidence.  It is a reliable way of knowing?\n \nThere is probably nothing else most people would accept in the absence\nof any possibility of proof.  Even when we agree to take someone elses\nword "on faith", we just mean that having found this person to be\nreliable in the past, we judge him likely to be a reliable source now.\nIf we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidence\neverywhere else, why assume it will provide reliable knowledge about\ngods?\n \nThe difference between the atheist and the theist is fundamentally then\none of whether or not faith is held to be a reliable way of knowing,\nrather than, as some agnostic posters would have it, whether ones faith\nis in gods or no gods.  The theist believes that faith is an acceptable\nbasis for a belief in gods, even if he rejects faith as reliable at\nother times, for example in his work as a scientist.  The atheist\nbelieves that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliable\nknowledge.  Agnosticism seems to me a less defensible position than\ntheism or atheism, unless one is a sceptic in regards to all other\nknowledge.  Without evidence, why should we believe in gods rather than\nSanta Claus or the Easter Bunny?\n \nI would also like to point out as others have that the atheist doesn't\nrequire absolute knowledge of the lack of gods.  I don't believe that\nthere is any such thing as absolute knowledge.  Atheism is the best and\nsimplest theory to fit the (lack of) facts and so should be held until\ncontrary evidence is found.
Is it just me, or has this part gotten beyond useful?\n\nGregg is not, as I understand his posts, giving any support to the bounty\non Rushdie's life.  If that's correct, end of one point...\n\nGregg is using the concept of legal in a way most Westerners don't accept.\nHis comments about Islamic Law I think make a great deal of sense to him,\nand are even making a _little_ sense to me now - if a person is a member\nof a group (religion or whatever) they bind themselves to follow the ways\nof the group within the bounds of what the group requires as a minimum.\nThe big bone of contention here that I'm picking up is that in the West\nwe have secular governments that maintain, more or less, a level of control\nand of requirements outside the requirements of optional groups.  I think\nthe majority of us reading this thread are in tune (note - I didn't say\n"in agreement") with the idea that you are finally responsible to the\nsecular government,  and within that to the group or groups a person may\nhave chosen.\n\nWith that in mind, it not possible under secular law ("legally" as most\npeople would define the term) to hold a person to a particular group once\nthey decide to separate from it.  Only if the secular authorities agree\nthat there is a requirement of some sort (contractual, etc) is there\nany secular _enforcement_ allowed by a group to a group member or past\ngroup member.\n\nA religion can, and often does, believe in and require additional duties\nof a group member.  And it can enforce the fulfillment of those duties\nin many ways - ostracism is common for example.  But the limit comes when\nthe enforcement would impose unwanted and/or unaccepted onus on a person\n_in conflict with secular law_.\n\nThis is the difference.  In a theocracy, the requirements of the secular\nauthorities are, by definition, congruent with the religious authorities.\nOutside a theocracy, this is not _necessarily_ true.  Religious requirements\n_may_ coincide or may not.  Similiarly, religious consequences _may_ or\nmay not coincide with secular consequences (if any).\n\nRegards,\n\nDew

<In article <31MAR199321091163@juliet.caltech.edu<, lmh@juliet.caltech.edu (Henling, Lawrence M.) writes...\n<<Atheism (Greek 'a' not + 'theos' god)  Belief that there is no god.\n<<Agnosticism (Greek 'a' not + ~ 'gnostein ?' know) Belief that it is\n<<  not possible to determine if there is a god.\n\n<No.  Agnosticism as you have here defined it is a positive belief--a\n<belief that it is not possible to determine the existence of any gods.\n<That's a belief I'm inclined to reject.

Correction: _hard_ atheism is a faith.\n\n\n\nGet a grip, man.  The Stalin example was brought up not as an\nindictment of atheism, but merely as another example of how people will\nkill others under any name that's fit for the occasion.\n\n\n\nSo hard atheism has nothing to prove?  Then how does it justify that\nGod does not exist?  I know, there's the FAQ, etc.  But guess what -- if\nthose justifications were so compelling why aren't people flocking to\n_hard_ atheism?  They're not, and they won't.  I for one will discourage\npeople from hard atheism by pointing out those very sources as reliable\nstatements on hard atheism.\n\nSecond, what makes you think I'm defending any given religion?

Size of armies, duration, numbers of casualties both absolute and as a\npercentage of those involved, geographical area and numbers of countries\ntoo, are all measures of size.  In this case I'd say the relevant\nstatistic would be the number of combatants (total troops) compared to\ntotal casualties from among the total civilian population in the\naffected geographical area.\n\n\nVietnam and Korea might make good comparisons.\n\n\nWestern news in general, but in particular the American "mass media":\nCBS, NBC, ABC, etc.  The general tone of the news during the whole\nwar was one of "those poor, poor Iraqis" along with "look how precisely\nthis cruise missile blew this building to bits".\n\n\nI agree.\n\n\nPerhaps so.  And maybe the atomic bomb was a mistake too.  But that's easy\nto say from our "enlightened" viewpoint here in the 90's, right?  Back\nthen, it was *all-out* war, and Germany and Japan had to be squashed.\nAfter all, a million or more British had already died, hundreds of \nthousands of French, a couple hundread thousand or so Americans, and \nmillions of Russians, not to mention a few million Jews, Poles, and \nother people of slavic descent in German concentration camps.  All \nthings considered, the fire-bombings and the atomic bomb were\nessential (and therefore justified) in bringing the war to a quick\nend to avoid even greater allied losses.\n\nI, for one, don't regret it.\n\n\nSure.  And it's the people who suffer because of them.  All the more\nreason to depose these "entrenched political rulers operating in their\nown selfish interests"!  Or do you mean that this applies to the allies\nas well??\n\n\nI make no claim or effort to justify the misguided foreign policy of the\nWest before the war.  It is evident that the West, especially America,\nmisjudged Hussein drastically.  But once Hussein invaded Kuwait and \nthreatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the world's\noil supply, he had to be stopped.  Sure the war could have been\nprevented by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the West\nbefore Hussein invaded Kuwait, but it is still *Hussein* who is\nresponsible for his decision to invade.  And once he did so, a\nstrong response from the West was required.\n\n\nWell, it's not very "loving" to allow a Hussein or a Hitler to gobble up\nnearby countries and keep them.  Or to allow them to continue with mass\nslaughter of certain peoples under their dominion.  So, I'd have to\nsay yes, stopping Hussein was the most "loving" thing to do for the\nmost people involved once he set his mind on military conquest.\n\nI mentioned it.\n\nIf we hadn't intervened, allowing Hussein to keep Kuwait, then it would\nhave been appeasement.  It is precisely the lessons the world learned\nin WW2 that motivated the Western alliance to war.  Letting Hitler take\nAustria and Czechoslavkia did not stop WW2 from happening, and letting\nHussein keep Kuwait would not have stopped an eventual Gulf War to\nprotect Saudi Arabia.\n\n\nSure.  What was truly unfortunate was that they followed Hitler in\nhis grandiose quest for a "Thousand Year Reich".  The consequences\nstemmed from that.\n\nWhat should I say about them?  Anything in particular?\n\n\n\nSo?  It was the *policemen* on trial not Rodney King!!  And under American\nlaw they deserved a jury of *their* peers!  If there had been black\nofficers involved, I'm sure their would have been black jurors too.\nThis point (of allegedly racial motivations) is really shallow.\n\n\nSo?  It's "hard to imagine"?  So when has Argument from Incredulity\ngained acceptance from the revered author of "Constructing a Logical\nArgument"?  Can we expect another revision soon??  :)  (Just kidding.)\n\n\nI have to admit that I wonder this too.  But *neither* the prosecution\nnor the defense is talking.  So one cannot conclude either way due to\nthe silence of the principals.  \n\n\nOK.  It certainly seemed to me that there was excessive force involved.\nAnd frankly, the original "not guilty" verdict baffled me too.  But then\nI learned that the prosecution in the first case did not try to convict\non a charge of excessive force or simple assault which they probably\nwould have won, they tried to get a conviction on a charge of aggravated\nassault with intent to inflict serious bodily harm.  A charge, which\nnews commentators said, was akin to attempted murder under California\nlaw.  Based on what the prosecution was asking for, it's evident that \nthe first jury decided that the officers were "not guilty".  Note, \nnot "not guilty" of doing wrong, but "not guilty" of aggravated assault \nwith the *intent* of inflicting serious bodily harm.  The seeds of the \nprosecutions defeat were in their own overconfidence in obtaining a \nverdict such that they went for the most extreme charge they could.\n\nIf the facts as the news commentators presented them are true, then\nI feel the "not guilty" verdict was a reasonable one.\n\n\nThanks mathew, I like the quote.  Pretty funny actually.  (I'm a \nMonty Python fan, you know.  Kind of seems in that vein.)\n\nOf course, oversimplifying any moral argument can make it seem\ncontradictory.  But then, you know that already.  \n\nRegards,
Yes, and everyone thinks as you do.  No one thinks that he is going to cause\nor be involved in a fatal accident, but the likelihood is surprisingly high.\nJust because you are the man on the firing squad whose gun is shooting\nblanks does not mean that you are less guilty.\n\n\nYou mean that killing is wrong in all but one situtation?  And, you should\nnote that that situation will never occur.  There are always other options\nthank killing.  Why don't you just say that all killing is wrong.  This\nis basically what you are saying.\n\n\nAre you attempting to be condescending?\n\n\nBut, most people have found the risk to be acceptable.  You are probably\nmuch more likely to die in a plane crash, or even using an electric\nblender, than you are to be executed as an innocent.  I personally think\nthat the risk is acceptable, but in an ideal moral system, no such risk\nis acceptable.  "Acceptable" is the fudge factor necessary in such an\napproximation to the ideal.

What do you mean by omnipotent here?  Do you mean by "omnipotent"\nthat God should be able to do anything/everything?  This creates\na self-contradictory definition of omnipotence which is effectively\nuseless.\n\nTo be descriptive, omnipotence must mean "being all-powerful" and\nnot "being able to do anything/everything".\n\nLet me illustrate by analogy.\nSuppose the United States were the only nuclear power on earth.  Suppose\nfurther that the US military could not effectively be countered by any\nnation or group of nations.  The US has the power to go into any country\nat any time for any reason to straighten things out as the leaders of the\nUS see fit.  The US would be militarily "omnipotent".\n\nBut suppose further that the US holds to a doctrine/philosophy of not\ninterfering in the internal affairs of any nation, such as the current\ncivil war in the former Yugoslavian states.\n\nTechnically (in this scenario) the US would have the power to \nunilaterally go into Yugoslavia and straighten out the mess.  But\neffectively the US could not intervene without violating its own policy \nof non-interference.  If the policy of non-interference were held to\nstrongly enough, then there would never be a question that it would\never be violated.  Effectively, the US would be limited in what it\ncould actually do, although it had the power to do "whatever it wanted".\nThe US would simply "never want to interfere" for such an idea would\nbe beyond the consideration of its leaders given such an inviolate\nnon-interference policy.\n\nGod is effectively limited in the same sense.  He is all powerful, but\nHe cannot use His power in a way that would violate the essence of what\nHe, Himself is.\n\nI hope this helps to clear up some of the misunderstanding concerning\nomnipotence.\n\nRegards,
Koff!  You mean that as long as I put you to sleep first,\nI can kill you without being cruel?\n\nThis changes everything.
This is a good point, but I think "average" people do not take up Christianity\nso much out of fear or escapism, but, quite simply, as a way to improve their\nsocial life, or to get more involved with American culture, if they are kids of\nimmigrants for example.  Since it is the overwhelming major religion in the\nWestern World (in some form or other), it is simply the choice people take if\nthey are bored and want to do something new with their lives, but not somethong\nTOO new, or TOO out of the ordinary.  Seems a little weak, but as long as it\ndoesn't hurt anybody...\n \n\nThese are good quotes, and I agree with both of them, but let's make sure to\nalter the scond one so that includes something like "...let him be, as long as\nhe is not preventing others from finding their peace." or something like that. \n(Of course, I suppose, if someone were REALLY "at peace", there would be no\nneed for inflicting evangelism)\n\n\nWell, it is a sure thing we will have to live with them all our lives.  Their\npopularity seems to come and go.  I remember when I first entered High School,\nI was an atheist (always had been) and so were about 7 of my friends.  At this\ntime, 5 of those 7 have converted, always to Christianity (they were all also\nimmigrants from Taiwan, or sons of immigrants, hence my earlier gross\ngeneralization).  Christianity seems a lot more popular to people now than it\never has before (since I've been noticing).  Maybe it is just my perceptions\nthat are chagning.  Who knows?\nI for one am perfectly willing to live and let live with them, so long as we\nhave some set of abstract rights/agreements on how we should treat each other:\nI have no desire to be hurt by them or their notions.  For all the well-put\narguments on this usenet, it never does any good.  Argumentation does not\nreally seem to apply to Christians (or even some atheists)- it must simply be a\nstep the person takes naturally, almost, "instinctively"...\n\n\nbest regards,\n\n********************************************************************************\n* Adam John Cooper		"Verily, often have I laughed at the weaklings *\n*				   who thought themselves good simply because  *\n* acooper@macalstr.edu				they had no claws."	       *\n********************************************************************************

(Deletion)\n \nNo it in the way it is usually used. In my view, you are saying here that\ndriving a car requires faith that the car drives.\n \nFor me it is a conclusion, and I have no more faith in it than I have in the\npremises and the argument used.\n \n \n \nNo, that's a word game. The term god is used in a different way usually.\nWhen you use a different definition it is your thing, but until it is\ncommonly accepted you would have to say the way I define god is ... and\nthat does not exist, it is existence itself, so I say it does not exist.\n \nInterestingly, there are those who say that "existence exists" is one of\nthe indubitable statements possible.\n \nFurther, saying god is existence is either a waste of time, existence is\nalready used and there is no need to replace it by god, or you are implying\nmore with it, in which case your definition and your argument so far\nare incomplete, making it a fallacy.\n \n \n(Deletion)\n(Deletion)\n \nWhere does that follow?

Well now, we can't judge death until we are dead right?  So, why should\nwe judge religion without having experienced it?

I think many reading this group would also benefit by knowing how\ndeviant the view _as I've articulated it above_ (which may not be\nthe true view of Khomeini) is from the basic principles of Islam. \nSo that the non-muslim readers of this group will see how far from \nthe simple basics of Islam such views are on the face of them. And \nif they are _not_ in contradiction with the basics of Islam, how \nsubtle such issues are and how it seems sects exist in Islam while \nthey are explicitly proscribed by the Qur'an.\n\n\n\n\nIn my opinion considering any human being as having a substance\nor metaphysical fundamentally different from that of any other human\nbeing _is_ a heretical notion and one proscribed by Islam. \n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely! I would be interested in discussing this privately and\nI am interested in hearing how one might try to make the concept of\nerror-free and sinless human beings philosophically consistent with\nthe teachings of the Qur'an. However, _prima facie_ such attemptsa\nare highly susceptible to degenerating into monkery, explicitly\nproscribed by the Qur'an.\n\n\n\nAlaikum Wassalam
I have made this clear elsewhere but will do so again. Khomeini put a \nprice on the head of someone in another country, this makes him a jerk\nas well as an international outlaw. Khomeini advocates the view that\nthere was a series of twelve Islamic leaders (the Twelve Imams) who\nare free of error or sin. This makes him a heretic. In the Qur'an \nMuhammad is chastised for error directly by God; the Qur'an says that\nMuhammad is the greatest example of proper Islamic behavior; thus\nno muslim is free from error. \n\n\n\nPerhaps it seems so to you, but this is hardly the case. There is\nwidespread agreement about matters of Islam. There certainly are\nmany viewpoints on issues which are not particularly Islamic in\nand of themselves, but this is so for any large group of people\nunder the same name. \n\n\nThe Qur'an is not particularly imprecise in wording, though it is true\nthat several interpretations are possible in the interpretations of\nmany words. However, as an entire text the Qur'an makes its meanings\nprecise enough for intelligent people free from power lust to come\nto agreement about them.
What I've been saying is that moral behavior is likely the null behavior.\nThat is, it doesn't take much work to be moral, but it certainly does to\nbe immoral (in some cases).  Also, I've said that morality is a remnant\nof evolution.  Our moral system is based on concepts well practiced in\nthe animal kingdom.\n\n\nBut, this doesn't get us anywhere.  Your particular beliefs are irrelevant\nunless you can share them or discuss them...
I don't think we need to argue about this.\n\n\nYes, but also many people who are not trying to make government recognize\nChristianity as the dominant religion in this country do no think\nthe motto infringes upon the rights of others who do not share their\nbeliefs.\n\nAnd actually, I think that the government already does recognize that\nChristianity is the dominant religion in this country.  I mean, it is.\nDon't you realize/recognize this?\n\nThis isn't to say that we are supposed to believe the teachings of\nChristianity, just that most people do.\n\n\nIf you agree with me, then what are we discussing?\n\n\nNo, but I hear quite a bit about Christmas, and little if anything about\nJesus.  Wouldn't this figure be more prominent if the holiday were really\nassociated to a high degree with him?  Or are you saying that the\nassociation with Jesus is on a personal level, and that everyone thinks\nabout it but just never talks about it?\n\nThat is, can *you* prove that most people *do* associate Christmas\nmost importantly with Jesus?\n\n\nI think the numbers *do* matter.  It takes a majority, or at least a\nmajority of those in power, to discriminate.  Doesn't it?
This thread seems to be arguing the validity of a religious viewpoint\naccording to some utilitarian principle, i.e. atheism/religion is\nwrong because it causes death.  The underlying `moral' is that death\nis `wrong'.  This is a rather arbitrary measure of validity.\n\nGet some epistemology.
Excerpts from netnews.alt.atheism: 15-Apr-93 Re: thoughts on christians\nby Dave Fuller@portal.hq.vi \nI think it'd help if we got a couple good atheists (or even some good,\nsteadfast agnostics) in some high political offices.  When was the last\ntime we had an (openly) atheist president?  Have we ever?  (I don't\nactually know; these aren't rhetorical questions.)  How 'bout some\nSupreme court justices?  \n\nOne thing that really ticked me off a while ago was an ad for a news\nprogram on a local station...The promo said something like "Who are\nthese cults, and why do they prey on the young?"  Ahem.  EVER HEAR OF\nBAPTISM AT BIRTH?  If that isn't preying on the young, I don't know what\nis...\n\nI used to be (ack, barf) a Catholic, and was even confirmed...Shortly\nthereafter I decided it was a load of BS.  My mom, who really insisted\nthat I continue to go to church, felt it was her duty (!) to bring me up\nas a believer!  That was one of the more presumptuous things I've heard\nin my life.  I suggested we go talk to the priest, and she agreed.  The\npriest was amazingly cool about it...He basically said that if I didn't\nbelieve it, there was no good in forcing it on me.  Actually, I guess he\nwasn't amazingly cool about it--His response is what you'd hope for\n(indeed, expect) from a human being.  I s'pose I just _didn't_ expect\nit...  \n\nI find it absurd that religion exists; Yet, I can also see its\nusefulness to people.  Facing up to the fact that you're just going to\nbe worm food in a few decades, and that there isn't some cosmic purpose\nto humanity and the universe, can be pretty difficult for some people. \nHaving a readily-available, pre-digested solution to this is pretty\nattractive, if you're either a) gullible enough, b) willing to suspend\nyour reasoning abilities for the piece of mind, or c) have had the stuff\nrammed down your throat for as long as you can remember.  Religion in\ngeneral provides a nice patch for some human weaknesses; Organized\nreligion provides a nice way to keep a population under control.  \n\nBlech.\n\nChris

No, the argument says John has known Q, ie a codified version of the logia,\nand not the original, assuming that there has been one. It has weaknesses,\nof course, like that John might have known the original, yet rather referred\nto Q in his text, or that the logia were given in a codified version in\nthe first place.\n \nThe argument alone does not allow a firm conclusion, but it fits well into\nthe dating usually given for the gospels.\n \n \n \nNot necessarily, Luke may have trusted the version he knew better than the\nversion given by Matthew. Improving on Matthew would give a motive, for\ninstance.\n \nAs far as I know, the theory that Luke has known Matthew is based on a\nstatistical analysis of the texts.\n \n \n \nYep, but it will take another day or so to get the source. I hope your German\nis good enough. :-)\n \n \n \nI still do not see how copies from 200 allow to change the dating of John.\n \n \n \nYes, but an if gives only possibilities and no evidence.

You don't think these are little things because with twenty-twenty\nhindsight, you know what they led to.
Sorry, you're right.  I did not clearly state it.\n\n\n\nThe most common form of condescending is the rational versus irrational\nattitude.  Once one has accepted the _assumption_ that there is no god(s),\nand then consider other faiths to be irrational simply because their\nassumption(s) contradict your assumption, then I would say there's a\nlack of consistency here.\n\nNow I know you'll get on me about faith.  If the _positive_ belief that God\ndoes not exist were a closed, logical argument, why do so many rational\npeople have problems with that "logic"?\n\nBut you, probably like me, seem to be a soft atheist.

Why?\n\nOne of the big reasons is that many, many people want something\nbeyond this life.  You can pretend that they don't want this, but I for\none can accept it and even want it myself sometimes.\n\nAnd there is nothing unique in this example of why people want a God.\nCan love as a truth be proven, logically?\n\n\n\nJohn the Baptist boasted of Jesus to many people.  I find it hard to see\nhow that behavior is arrogant at all.  Many Christians I know also boast\nin this way, but I still do not necessarily see it as arrogance.  Of course,\nI do know arrogant Christians, doctors, and teachers as well.  Technically,\nyou might consider the person who originally made a given claim to be arrogant,\nJesus, for instance.\n\n\nI speak against strong atheism.

This (frayed) thread has turned into a patented alt.atheism 5-on-1\nping-pong game, and I don't have any strong disagreement, so I'll try\nto stick to the one thing I don't quite follow about the argument:\n\nIt seems to me that there is a contradiction in arguing that the Bible\nwas "enlightened for its times" (i.e. closer to what we would consider\nmorally good based on our standards and past experience) on the one\nhand [I hope this summarizes this argument adequately], and on the\nother hand:\n\n\n}|> }Disclaimer:  I'm speaking from the Jewish perspective,\n}|> }where "the Bible" means what many call the Old Testament,\n}|> }and where the interpretation is not necessarily the\n}|> }raw text, but instead the court cases, commentaries\n}|> }and traditions passed down through Jewish communities.\n}|> \n}|> This seems the crux to me: if you judge the Bible according to a long\n}|> line of traditions and interpretations coming down to the current day,\n}|> rather than on its own merits as a cultural artifact, then of course\n}|> it will correspond more closely with more contemporary values.\n}\n}But if that's how the Bible is actually being used today,\n}shouldn't that be how we should judge it?  If most people\n}use scissors to cut paper, shouldn't Consumer's Reports\n}test scissors for paper-cutting ability, even though\n}scissors may have been designed originally to cut cloth?\n\nThat's possibly a good way to judge the use of the Bible in teaching\nJewish morality today, but it hardly seems fair to claim that this\nhighly-interpreted version is what was "enlightened for its times".\nTo (attempt to) extend the analogy, this is like saying that the\noriginal scissor-makers were unusually advanced at paper-cutting for\ntheir times, even though they only ever cut cloth, and had never even\nheard of paper.\n\nI'm not arguing that the Bible is "disgusting", though some of the\nhistory depicted in it is, by modern standards.  However, history is\nfull of similar abuses, and I don't think the Biblical accounts are\nworse than their contemporaries--or possibly ours.  On the other hand,\nI don't know of any reason to think the history described in the Bible\nshows *less* abuse than their contemporaries, or ours.  That complex\nand benign moral traditions have evolved based on particular mythic\ninterpretations of that history is interesting, but I still don't\nthink it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use it\nto attack condemnation of the original history.

I would be happy to discuss the  issue of the 12 Imams with you, although\nmy preference would be to move the discussion to another\nnewsgroup.  I feel a philosophy\nor religion group would be more appropriate. The topic is deeply\nembedded in the world view of Islam and the\nesoteric teachings of the Prophet (S.A.). Heresy does not enter\ninto it at all except for those who see Islam only as an exoteric\nreligion that is only nominally (if at all) concerned with the metaphysical\nsubstance of man's being and nature.\n\nA good introductory book (in fact one of the best introductory\nbooks to Islam in general) is Murtaza Mutahhari's "Fundamental's\nof Islamic Thought - God, Man, and the Universe" - Mizan Press,\ntranslated by R. Campbell. Truly a beautiful book. A follow-up book\n(if you can find a decent translation) is "Wilaya - The Station\nof the Master" by the same author. I think it also goes under the\ntitle of "Master and Mastership" - It's a very small book - really\njust a transcription of a lecture by the author.\nThe introduction to the beautiful "Psalms of Islam" - translated\nby William C. Chittick (available through Muhammadi Trust of\nGreat Britain) is also an excellent introduction to the subject. We\nhave these books in our University library - I imagine any well\nstocked University library will have them.\n\nFrom your posts, you seem fairly well versed in Sunni thought. You\nshould seek to know Shi'ite thought through knowledgeable \nShi'ite authors as well - at least that much respect is due before the\ncharge of heresy is levelled.

Oh, Bobby. You're priceless. Did I ever tell you that?\n\nMy policy with Bobby's posts, should anyone give a damn, is to flick\nthrough the thread at high speed, searching for posts of Bobby's which\nhave generated a whole pile of followups, then go in and extract the\nhilarious quote inevitably present for .sig purposes. Works for me.\n\nFor the guy who said he's just arrived, and asked whether Bobby's for real,\nyou betcha. Welcome to alt.atheism, and rest assured that it gets worse.\nI have a few pearls of wisdom from Bobby which I reproduce below. Is anyone\n(Keith?) keeping a big file of such stuff?\n\n     "In Allah's infinite wisdom, the universe was created from nothing,\n        just by saying "Be", and it became. Therefore Allah exists."\n           --- Bobby Mozumder proving the existence of Allah, #1\n\n     "Wait. You just said that humans are rarely reasonable. Doesn't that\n      contradict atheism, where everything is explained through logic and\n      reason? This is THE contradiction in atheism that proves it false."\n           --- Bobby Mozumder proving the existence of Allah, #2\n\n              "Plus, to the believer, it would be contradictory\n                    to the Quran for Allah not to exist."\n           --- Bobby Mozumder proving the existence of Allah, #3\n\nand now\n\n   "One thing that relates is among Navy men that get tatoos that say "Mom",\n    because of the love of their mom. It makes for more virile men. Compare\n    that with how homos are raised.  Do a study and you will get my point."\n         -- Bobby Mozumder being Islamically Rigorous on alt.atheism\n\nMmmmm.

(Deletion)\n \nNo cookies, Charlie. The claims that Jesus have been seen are discredited\nas extraordinary claims that don't match their evidence. In this case, it\nis for one that the gospels cannot even agree if it was Jesus who has been\nseen. Further, there are zillions of other spook stories, and one would\nhardly consider others even in a religious context to be some evidence of\na resurrection.\n \nThere have been more elaborate arguments made, but it looks as if they have\nnot passed your post filtering.\n \n \n \nIt is no evidence in the strict meaning. If there was actual evidence it would\nprobably be part of it, but the says nothing about the claims.
: \n: >> Please enlighten me.  How is omnipotence contradictory?\n: \n: >By definition, all that can occur in the universe is governed by the rules\n: >of nature. Thus god cannot break them. Anything that god does must be allowed\n: >in the rules somewhere. Therefore, omnipotence CANNOT exist! It contradicts\n: >the rules of nature.\n: \n: Obviously, an omnipotent god can change the rules.\n\nWhen you say, "By definition", what exactly is being defined;\ncertainly not omnipotence. You seem to be saying that the "rules of\nnature" are pre-existant somehow, that they not only define nature but\nactually cause it. If that's what you mean I'd like to hear your\nfurther thoughts on the question.
At the cost of repudiating the FAQ, I think too much is made of the\nstrong vs weak atheism issue, although in the context of alt.atheism,\nwhere we're continually attacked on the basis that strong atheists\n"believe" in the non-existence of god, I think the separation is a\nvalid one.\n\nTo cover my arse, what I'm trying to say is that there is an\ninfinitely grey area between weak and strong, as well as between\nstrong and the unattainable mathematical atheism (I wish!).  Whereas I\n_logically_ can only support the weak atheist position, in effect I am\na strong atheist (and wish I could be a mathematical one).  To\njustify my strong atheist position I believe I need only show that\nthe evidence presented in favour of any of the gods under scrutiny\nis faulty.\n\nIf I read the FAQ correctly, no argument for the existence of god\n(generic, as represented by mainstream theologians) has ever been\nfound to be unassailable.  To me this is adequate evidence that the\n_real_god_ is undefinable (or at least no definition has yet been\nfound to be watertight), which in turn I accept as sufficient to\nbase a disbelief in each and every conceivable god.\n\nI'm a little fuzzy on the edges, though, so opinions are welcome\n(but perhaps we should change the thread subject).
Look up "irony", Keith.
Well, this particular thread of vituperation slopped its venom over\ninto alt.atheism, where we spend most of our time entertaining\narguments against our belief system, without resorting to accusing\nothers of bigotry.  It's somewhat ironic that our exposure to bigotry\nhappens in this instance to have originated in rec.scouting, since I\nalways understood scouting to teach tolerance and diversity.  I\nunderstand bigotry to be irrational prejudice against other people who\nhappen to be of a different race, religion, ethnic background, sex, or\nother inconsequential characteristics.  All the evidence I've seen\nindicates that sexual orientation and lack of belief in gods are\nexactly such inconsequential characteristics.  Thus, pending further\nevidence, I conclude that those who show prejudice against such people\nare bigots, and organizations that exclude such people are\ndiscriminatory.
I was replying to a person who attempted to justify the fatwa\nagainst Rushdie on the grounds that his work was intentionally\ninsulting. \n\nI think that to take a single sentence from a fairly long\nposting, and to say \n\n	"I don't know if you are doing so, but it \n	seems you are implying....."\n\nis at the very best quite disingenuous, and perhaps even\ndishonest.    If anyone care to dig back and read the full\nposting, they will see nothing of the kind.\n\nI trust you don't deny that Islamic teaching has "something\nto do" with the fatwa against Rushdie?
I'm sure zero-intested economical systems survive on a small-scale,\nco-ops is not an Islamic invention, and we have co-operatives working\nall around the world. However such systems don't stand the corruption\nof a large scale operation. Actually, nothing could handle human\ngreed, IMHO. Not even Allah :-).\n\nCheers,\nKent
Tail-recursive functions in Scheme are at least as efficient as iterative\nloops.  Anyone who doesn't program in assembler will have heard of optimizing\ncompilers.
One thing I think is interesting about alt.athiesm is the fact that\nwithout bible-thumpers and their ilk this would be a much duller newsgroup.\nIt almost needs the deluded masses to write silly things for athiests to\ntear apart. Oh well, that little tidbit aside here is what I really wanted\nwrite about.\n\n      How can anyone believe in such a sorry document as the bible? If you\nwant to be religious aren't there more plausable books out there? Seriously,\nthe bible was written by multiple authors who repeatedly contradict each\nother. One minute it tells you to kill your kid if he talks back and the next\nit says not to kill at all. I think that if xtians really want to follow a\ndeity they should pick one that can be consistent, unlike the last one they\ninvented.\n\n      For people who say Jesus was the son of god, didn't god say not to\nEVER put ANYONE else before him? Looks like you did just that. Didn't god\nsay not to make any symbols or idols? What are crosses then? Don't you think\nthat if you do in fact believe in the bible that you are rather far off track?\n\nWas Jesus illiterate? Why didn't he write anything? Anyone know?\n\n      I honestly hope that people who believe in the bible understand that\nit is just one of the religious texts out there and that it is one of the\npoorer quality ones to boot. The only reason xtianity escaped the middle east\nis because a certain roman who's wine was poisoned with lead made all of rome\nxtian after a bad dream.\n\n      If this posting keeps one person, just ONE person, from standing on a\nstreetcorner and telling people they are going to hell I will be happy.

The church, for example,\nforbids that anyone "produce, describe or use any substance containing...\natoms". \n\nPHILIP K. DICK\n\nPhilip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short \nstories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable.\nHe wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than\ntechnology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he\nremained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:\n\n"Galactic Pot-Healer"\nA fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a\nremote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the\ndeity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is\nunable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.\n\n"A Maze of Death"\nNoteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.\n\n"VALIS"\nThe schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic\nChristianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of\nunknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and\ndismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.\n\n"The Divine Invasion"\nGod invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from\nanother star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be\nassisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.\n\nMARGARET ATWOOD\n\n"The Handmaid's Tale"\nA story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously\nassassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it\n"right" again.  The book is the diary of a woman's life as she tries to live\nunder the new Christian theocracy.  Women's right to own property is revoked,\nand their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the\nradio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished\nretroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the "old world" are\nhunted down and hanged.  Atwood's writing style is difficult to get used to\nat first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.\n\nVARIOUS AUTHORS\n\n"The Bible"\nThis somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, it\nis probably worth reading, if only so that you'll know what all the fuss is\nabout.  It exists in many different versions, so make sure you get the one\ntrue version.\n\n                             Books -- Non-fiction\n\nPETER DE ROSA\n\n"Vicars of Christ", Bantam Press, 1988\nAlthough de Rosa seems to be Christian or even Catholic this is a very\nenlighting history of papal immoralities, adulteries, fallacies etc.\n(German translation: "Gottes erste Diener. Die dunkle Seite des Papsttums",\nDroemer-Knaur, 1989)\n\nMICHAEL MARTIN\n\n"Atheism: A Philosophical Justification", Temple University Press,\n Philadelphia, USA.\nA detailed and scholarly justification of atheism.  Contains an outstanding\nappendix defining terminology and usage in this (necessarily) tendentious\narea.  Argues both for "negative atheism" (i.e. the "non-belief in the\nexistence of god(s)") and also for "positive atheism" ("the belief in the\nnon-existence of god(s)").  Includes great refutations of the most\nchallenging arguments for god; particular attention is paid to refuting\ncontempory theists such as Platinga and Swinburne.\n541 pages.

Examines the way in which\nunbelief (whether agnostic or atheistic)  became a mainstream alternative\nworld-view.  Focusses on the period 1770-1900, and while considering France\nand Britain the emphasis is on American, and particularly New England\ndevelopments.  "Neither a religious history of secularization or atheism,\nWithout God, Without Creed is, rather, the intellectual history of the fate\nof a single idea, the belief that God exists." \n316 pages.

Includes obscure (and often suppressed) opinions from many\npeople.  For some popular observations, traces the way in which various\npeople expressed and twisted the idea over the centuries.  Quite a number of\nthe quotations are derived from Cardiff's "What Great Men Think of Religion"\nand Noyes' "Views of Religion".\n490 pages. ISBN (paper) 0-345-29887-X.\n\nRICHARD SWINBURNE\n\n"The Existence of God (Revised Edition)", Clarendon Paperbacks, Oxford\nThis book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with "The Coherence of\nTheism" (1977) and was concluded with "Faith and Reason" (1981).  In this\nwork, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the\nexistence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely\nupon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and\naesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were\ndecisively rejected in Mackie's "The Miracle of Theism".  In the revised\nedition of "The Existence of God", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he\nmakes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.\n\nJ. L. MACKIE\n\n"The Miracle of Theism", Oxford\nThis (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal\narguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical\nphilosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through\nthe moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements\nof the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those\npositions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,\nsuch as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as "replacements for\nGod" such as Lelie's axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less\nformalistic and better written than Martin's works, and refreshingly direct\nwhen compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.\n\nJAMES A.

The "`little' things" above were in reference to Germany, clearly.  People\nsaid that there were similar things in Germany, but no one could name any.\nThey said that these were things that everyone should know, and that they\nweren't going to waste their time repeating them.  Sounds to me like no one\nknew, either.  I looked in some books, but to no avail.\n\n\nIt has *caused* problems?  Again, no one has shown that things were better\nbefore the motto, or that they'd likely be better after.  I don't think\nthe motto initiates any sort of harassment.  Harassment will occur whether\nor not the motto is present.
If all of those are "is"'s of identity, both syllogisms are valid.\nIf, however, B is a predicate, then the second syllogism is invalid.\n(The first syllogism, as you have pointed out, is valid--whether B\nis a predicate or designates an individual.)
Ok, this is the only thing I will comment on from Stan at this time...\npart of this forum we call rec.scouting is for policy discussions and\nrelated topics.  This is a policy discussion, and involves related \ntopics.  this is not a "fringe" group discussion.  obviously, it \nengenders strong feelings from all sides of the issues at hand. \nWether a particular view is anti-societal or not is your opinion, \nand yours alone, don't try to make it seem otherwise. \nIf you do not wish to engage in this discussion, use a kill file. \nIf you wish to continue in this discussion, please do so, knowing \nfull well the implications that apply.\nI know for myself that I plan on continuing with the discussion when \ni have the wish to have input.  I for one am tired of people trying to \nsay that this is not a matter significant for this group!  It is, and \nquite so. Especially for those of us who feel the impact more closely.
Unfortunately your phrasing is ambiguous.  Re-writing more carefully, we have\n(at least) two possibilities.  The first:\n\nThings called "Mercedes" are cars\nThat girl is called "Mercedes"\nTherefore that girl is a car\n\nThat is entirely valid as a piece of logical deduction.  It is not sound,\nbecause the first statement is false.  Similarly, I would hold that Jim's\nexample is valid but not sound.\n\nAnother possible interpretation of what you wrote is:\n\nThere exists at least one car called "Mercedes"\nThat girl is called "Mercedes"\nTherefore that girl is a car\n\n-- which isn't valid.

This posting is totally uncalled for in rec.scouting.\n\nThe point has been raised and has been answered.  Roger and I have\nclearly stated our support of the BSA position on the issue;\nspecifically, that homosexual behavior constitutes a violation of\nthe Scout Oath (specifically, the promise to live "morally straight").\n\nThere is really nothing else to discuss.  Trying to cloud the issue\nwith comparisons to Blacks or other minorities is also meaningless\nbecause it's like comparing apples to oranges (i.e., people can't\ncontrol their race but they can control their behavior).\n\nWhat else is there to possibly discuss on rec.scouting on this issue?\nNobody, including BSA, is denying anybody the right to live and/or\nworship as they please or don't please,  but it doesn't mean that BSA\nis the big bad wolf for adhering to the recognized, positive, religious\nand moral standards on which our society has been established and on\nwhich it should continue to be based.

I don't think the Book of Mormon was supposedly translated from Biblical \nHebrew.  I've read that "prophet Joseph Smith" traslated the gold tablets \nfrom some sort of Egyptian-ish language.  \nFormer Mormons, PLEASE post.
[deletions]\n[deletions]\n\n As you have presented it, it is indeed an argument from incredulity.\nHowever, from what I have seen, it is not often presented in this manner.\nIt is usually presented more in the form, "And *besides*, I cannot see...\n...nor have I ever been offered a convincing explanation."\n Moreover, it is not unreasonable to ask for an explanation for such\nphenomena. That theism does not provide a convincing explanation is not\nan argument in theism's favor. Especially when different theisms offer \ndifferent explanations, and even different adherents of what is purportedly\nthe same theism give different explanations...\n\n\n Not im my experience. In my experience, the most common reason is the\nlack of evidence in theism's favor. You mileage may vary. :->\n\n\n Oh, heck, I'll be snide this once. :-> It's also fairly easy to attack\narguments that are not made. (I.e. 'strawmen'.)\n\n\n Sage advice indeed.\n\n Sincerely,\n\n Raymond Ingles                       ingles@engin.umich.edu
Ah, the verb "to must".   I was warned about that one back\nin Kindergarten.\n\nSo, why "must" they have such laws?
Then Mr Mozumder is incorrect when he says that when committing\nbad acts, people temporarily become atheists?
This isn't true.  Many people are forced to use the "automobile system."\nI certainly don't use it by choice.  If there were other ways of getting\naround, I'd do it.\n\n\nBut I think that the Court system has been refined--over hundreds of\nyears in the US, Britain, and other countries.  We have tried to make\nit as fair as possible.  Can it be made better (without removing the\ndeath penalty)?  Besides, life imprisonment sounds like a fatal punishment\nto me.
I tend to agree.  I came here when it first started and watched it grow\nfrom the roots on talk.religion.misc.  It seemed to take a while for enough\natheists to come forward to get past the "Let's trash Xians" and such.\nNow there's a stable core, and frankly there's a feeling that this is\n_our_ group.\n\nIf we go mainstream, we're going to be in a lot more places.  And every\nfucking fundy loonie freshman will be dumping on us to find Jeesus! and\nwarn us that we're all going to Hell.\n\nWant to see what we'll get?  Go real alt.fan.brother-jed and imagine that\nthose imbecilic tirades will be here.  All the time.  Every other post.\n\nI'm being selfish.  I find I really learn a lot here and the S/N isn't too\nbad.  The Browns and the Boobys are a distraction, but they are few enough\nthat they even bring in some of the leavening needed to offset them.  But\nI greatly fear that mainstreaming would basically put us at the swamping\nlevel of the Conners of the world.\n\nRegards,\nDew
Oh, Your Highness?   And exactly why "should" the quotation\nmarks enclose "laws," not "must."\n\nIn case you didn't notice, it's the function of the "must"\nthat I wish to ironicise.\n\n\nPerhaps the chimps that failed to evolve cooperative behaviour\ndied out, and we are left with the ones that did evolve such\nbehaviour, entirely by chance.\n\nAre you going to proclaim a natural morality every time an\norganism evolves cooperative behaviour?\n\nWhat about the natural morality of bee dance?
Gregg, so would you consider that Rushdie would now be left alone,\nand he could have a normal life? In other words, does Islam support\nthe notion of forgiving?\n\nCheers,\nKent
If I'm wrong, god is free at any time to correct my mistake.  That\n  he continues not to do so, while supposedly proclaiming his\n  undying love for my eternal soul, speaks volumes.\n\n  As for the trap, you are not in a position to tell me that I don't\n  believe in god because I do not wish to.  Unless you can know my\n  motivations better than I do myself, you should believe me when I\n  say that I earnestly searched for god for years and never found\n  him.\n\n\n/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\ \n\nBob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM \n\nThey said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away,\nand sank Manhattan out at sea.
(References: deleted to move this to a new thread)\n\n\n\n"To put it as simply as possible: *I am not a Muslim*.[...] I do not\n accept the charge of apostacy, because I have never in my adult life\n affirmed any belief, and what one has not affirmed one can not be\n said to have apostasized from.  The Islam I know states clearly that\n 'there can be no coercion in matters of religion'.  The many Muslims\n I respect would be horrified by the idea that they belong to their\n faith *purely by virtue of birth*, and that a person who freely chose\n not to be a Muslim could therefore be put to death."\n    	    	    	    	Salman Rushdie, "In Good Faith", 1990\n\n"God, Satan, Paradise, and Hell all vanished one day in my fifteenth\n year, when I quite abruptly lost my faith.  [...]and afterwards, to\n prove my new-found atheism, I bought myself a rather tasteless ham\n sandwich, and so partook for the first time of the forbidden flesh of\n the swine.  No thunderbolt arrived to strike me down. [...] From that\n day to this I have thought of myself as a wholly seculat person."\n    	    	    	    	Salman Rushdie, "In God We Trust", 1985\n \n\nOnly a functional illiterate with absolutely no conception of the\nnature of the novel could think such a thing.  I'll accept it\n(reluctantly) from mobs in Pakistan, but not from you.  What is\npresented in the fictional dream of a demented character cannot by the\nwildest stretch of the imagination be considered a reflection on the\nactual Mohammad.  What's worse, the novel doesn't present the\nMahound/Mohammed character in any worse light than secular histories\nof Islam; in particular, there is no "lewd" misrepresentation of his\nlife or that of his wives.\n\n\nDon't hold back; he's considered an apostate and a blasphemer.\nHowever, it's not for his writing in _The Satanic Verses_, but for\nwhat people have accepted as a propagandistic version of what is\ncontained in that book.  I have yet to find *one single muslim* who\nhas convinced me that they have read the book.  Some have initially\nclaimed to have done so, but none has shown more knowledge of the book\nthan a superficial Newsweek story might impart, and all have made\nfactual misstatements about events in the book.\n\n\nI'll keep an eye out for it.  I have a counter-proposal: I suggest\nthat you see the Viking hardcover by Salman Rushdie called _The\nSatanic Verses_.  Perhaps then you'll understand.
For the last time, Bobby. Lack of belief in YOUR god does NOT imply\natheism. Just because some moslems aren't moral does not mean they don't\nbelieve in a god named Allah, although their Allah may not do the things\nyour Allah does. If a moslem says he/she believes that a god exists, he/she\nis a theist (though maybe not a TRUE follower of islam).\n\n\n\nJerk.
What are the volumes that it speaks besides the fact that he leaves your \nchoices up to you?\n\n\nI definitely agree that it's rather presumptuous for either "side" to give some\npsychological reasoning for another's belief.\n\nMAC\n\n\n\n\n--\n****************************************************************\n                                                    Michael A.

As to what that headpiece is....\n\n(by chort@crl.nmsu.edu)\n\nSOURCE: AP NEWSWIRE\n\nThe Vatican, Home Of Genetic Misfits?\n\nMichael  A. Gillow, noted geneticist, has revealed  some unusual  data\nafter working undercover in  the Vatican for the past 18 years.   "The\nPopehat(tm) is actually an advanced bone spur.", reveals Gillow in his\ngroundshaking report. Gillow, who had  secretly  studied the innermost\nworkings of the Vatican since returning from Vietnam in a wheel chair,\nfirst approached the scientific community with his  theory in the late\n1950's.\n\n"The  whole hat  thing, that was just a cover  up. The  Vatican didn't\nwant the Catholic Community(tm) to realize  their  leader  was hefting\nnearly  8 kilograms of extraneous  bone  tissue on    the  top of  his\nskull.", notes Gillow in his report. "There are whole  laboratories in\nthe  Vatican  that experiment with tissue  transplants and bone marrow\nexperiments.  What started as a genetic fluke in the mid 1400's is now\nscientifically engineered and bred for. The whole bone transplant idea\nstarted  in  the  mid   sixties  inspired  by   doctor  Timothy  Leary\ntransplanting deer  bone cells into small white rats." Gillow is quick\nto point  out  the  assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II and the\ndisappearance of Dr.  Leary from the public eye.\n\n"When it becomes time to replace the pope", says Gillow, "The old pope\nand the replacement pope are  locked  in a padded  chamber. They  butt\nheads much  like  male yaks  fighting for dominance of the  herd.  The\nvictor emerges and has  earned the privilege of inseminating the choir\nboys."\n\n\nP.
AH! But what, exactly, is "inherently abhorrent" and WHY is it so?\nWhat you're saying is, in effect, "I think some things are repulsive,\nand I know a whole bunch of other people who agree with me, so they\nshould be deemed absolutely immoral now and forever, period".\n\n      Which in and of itself is nice enough; to some extent I agree with\nyou. But I do _not_ agree that things are 'inherently' or 'absolutely'\nimmoral; they are labeled 'immoral' each for its own good reason, and if\nthe reason can even theoretically change, then so can the label.\n\n[...]\n\n      No it doesn't. Humans are to some extent similar, because we all\nbelong to the same species; that that species has evolved is another\nstory altogether. To a certain extent evolution can even lend credence\nto moral absolutism (of a flavour).\n\n[...]\n\n      You're saying morality is what'll keep society alive and kicking.\nIt is, I think, up to a point; but societies are not all alike, and\nneither are their moralities.\n\n\n      Similar != identical.\n\n\n      No, it's falsifiable through finding someoe who was "created\ndifferent", whatever that might be in the "real" world.
[Dan's article deleted]\n\nI found the same add in our local Sunday newspaper.\nThe add was placed in the ..... cartoon section!\nThe perfect place for it ! :-)
But now you are contradicting yourself in a pretty massive way,\nand I don't think you've even noticed.\n\nIn another part of this thread, you've been telling us that the\n"goal" of a natural morality is what animals do to survive.\n\nBut suppose that your omniscient being told you that the long\nterm survival of humanity requires us to exterminate some \nother species, either terrestrial or alien.\n\nDoes that make it moral to do so?
