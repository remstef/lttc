Well, I just got my Centris 610 yesterday.  It took just over two \nweeks from placing the order.  The dealer (Rutgers computer store) \nappologized because Apple made a substitution on my order.  I ordered\nthe one without ethernet, but they substituted one _with_ ethernet.\nHe wanted to know if that would be "alright with me"!!!  They must\nbe backlogged on Centri w/out ethernet so they're just shipping them\nwith!  \n\n	Anyway, I'm very happy with the 610 with a few exceptions.  \nBeing nosy, I decided to open it up _before_ powering it on for the first\ntime.  The SCSI cable to the hard drive was only partially connected\n(must have come loose in shipping).  No big deal, but I would have been\npissed if I tried to boot it and it wouldn't come up!\n	The hard drive also has an annoying high pitched whine.  I've\nheard apple will exchange it if you complain, so I might try to get\nit swapped.\n	I am also dissappionted by the lack of soft power-on/off.  This\nwasn't mentioned in any of the literature I saw.  Also, the location\nof the reset/interupt buttons is awful.  Having keyboard control for\nthese functions was much more convenient.\n	Oh, and the screen seems tojump in a wierd way on power-up.\nI've seen this mentioned by others, so it must be a...feature...\n	Anyway, above all, it's fast.  A great machine at a great price!
To the best of my knowledge there aren't any problems with Quadras and\nblind transfers.  Trouble with blind transfers usually means the programmer\nscrewed up the TIBs or didn't test their driver with the device in question.\nWell designed TIBs poll or loop at every point where delays of >16µsec occur.\nThis usually occurs at the first byte of each block of a transfer but some\ndevices can "hiccup" in the middle of blocks.  If this happens in the middle\nof a blind transfer there is the possibility of losing or gaining a byte\ndepending on which direction the tranfer was going.  In anycase the SCSI Manager\nwill eventually return a phase error at the end of the transaction because\nit is out of sync.  Actual data loss would only occur if the driver didn't\npay attention to the errors coming back.\n\nNote that this effect is not caused by anything actually on the SCSI Bus but\nrather by the transfer loops inside the SCSI Manager.  The problem occurs when\nthe processor bus errors trying to access the SCSI chip when the next byte\nhasn't been clocked yet.  Also note that the Bus Error is dealt with by a bus\nerror handler and doesn't crash the machine...
Help!!!\n\nI have an ADB graphicsd tablet which I want to connect to my\nQuadra 950. Unfortunately, the 950 has only one ADB port and\nit seems I would have to give up my mouse.\n\nPlease, can someone help me? I want to use the tablet as well as\nthe mouse (and the keyboard of course!!!).\n\nThanks in advance.
Yes! what you are saying is absolutey true, but what you fail to mention is the\nfact that the LCIII uses the new 72 pin simms which allow 32 bit access to\neach simm. In the case of the LC III, it only has one simm slot, but accesses will\nbe 32 bits wides.\n***************************************************************************\n The views expressed in this posting those of the individual author only. \n[BBS Number:(613) 848-1346      MacContent is VictoriaÕs first Iconic BBS!]\n***************************************************************************

Hi... what alternatives to the Express modem do Duo owners have (if\nthey want to go at least 9600 baud)?\n\nEvery place in town says they are back ordered, and part of the reason\nI want a laptop mac is so I can use it as a remote terminal from\nwherever I am, but I really would hate to have to wait 2 months to get\na modem in or have to settle with 2400 baud.
According to the official documentation, failure to use the IIfx terminator\ncan not only affect SCSI bus performance but can also damage the bus.\nWhether this is your problem or not I don't know. I have had sporadic SCSI\nproblems with my IIfx since I bought it. (I cannot connect more than three\ndevices, fourth one causes major problems).\n\nFirst thing to do is to try to reformat your drive on someone elses system.\nIf you continue to get errors it is probably the drive. If it formats fine\nthen I would try to format it on your system with no externals. If this \nfails then the SCSI controller on your IIfx needs repair/replacement.\n\nHope this helps.

I have an old Mac Plus. A couple of years ago I bought a shiney new lc.\nIt came with apple's new keyboard (with abd ports). i replaced it with\na mac-pro-plus extended keyboard (which i thoroughly enjoy, thank you\nvery much).\n \nwell, i have this extra keyboard which i would like to use on the plus\nbut there's a little problem. the plus uses an rj-11 jack for keyboard\ninput and the new keyboards don't. i got an extra adb cable from my\nlocal apple dealer (they're such nice people), but they couldn't tell\nme the order of the wires.\n \nthere are four wires in the adb cables: black, white, red, tan. I know\none's a ground, one gets the serial signal, one supplies 5 volts, and\ni forgot what the fourth one does. anyway, if you hook them up wrong\nyou'll fry a board and i <really> don't want to do <that>.\n \nif any brave souls out there have done this before, please e-mail your\nexperience directly to me. i would greatly appreciate it especially\nsince apple's original keyboard is not . . . ergonomically correct.\n \nbtw, i did take apart my new keyboard to see if i could find the\ncorrelation between the wires for the rj-11 jack and the adb since it\nhas both, but no such luck (the connections are soldered inside of\nlittle boxes). Oh, well . . .\n \none more thing: in case you are thinking that the ABD ports on the\nnewer models are different from the connection used on the plus---\nyou're right. however, you can use the telephone cable from the plus\nand connect the mac-pro-plus keyboard via its own rj-11 jack. in\nother words, this little engineering feat i wish to do *is* possible.\nit's merely a matter of finding out the correct order.\n \nomt, when i get this to work, i definitely will post the solution\nso others can, too. thanx for the input.

I have MANY questions for all you experts out there pertaining to apple's\nbuilt-in video.  \n\n#1, Do all macs that have built-in video have the ability to use VGA monitors?\n#2, If so/if not, which macs have this capability?\n#3, Can they drive SVGA as well?\n#4, how big of a vga monitor can they drive?\n#5, how can you tell if an unlabeled monitor is VGA?  By the pinouts?\n    if so, what should it look like?\n\nParticularly, i'm interested in knowing if the si or ci drive VGA, as well\nas the LC's capabilities in driving VGA/SVGA

I can only comment on thermal recalibration in general. Some new\ndrives perform it in order to increase overall integrity of data\nwrites. Basically, the firmware instructs the actuator to perform\na test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physical\ntolerance, since when the media heats up or cools down, *some*\ntrack drift is inevitable, and the drive has to monitor it. This\nbecomes especially critical at very high recording densities, and\nso was used primarily on very large-capacity mechanisms, but it\nseems to be finding its way into more smaller drives as a way of\nboosting the drive's long-term reliability and MTBF ratings.\n\nI first became aware of thermal recalibration when it was pointed\nout that the technique conflicts with prolonged write times when\ndigitizing, say, audio or video to hard disk. Some manufacturers\nexplicitly state that drives with thermal recalibration are NOT\nto be used for applications that have prolonged disk writes.\n\nHope this helps.
Actually, an accelerator such as the Daystar 33 MHz 68040 is cheaper than\nupgrading to a Q700 (25 MHz).  The accelerator costs about $1400 whereas\nthe upgrade costs $2131 (just quoted from my dealer).  However the Q700\nupgrade gives you very fast built in video that supports monitors up to 21"\nwith 8 bit depth and up to 16" at 24 bit depth (with additional VRAM).  It\nalso has a SCSI port capable of a much faster throughput than the CI, which\nmakes a big difference if you have a fast hard drive.\n\n  If the improved video and SCSI features are important to you, you're\nbetter off getting the Q700 upgrade, otherwise save some money and get an\naccelerator.
I just read an article on the SWII. One thing puzzles me: the article says the\nSWII is a serial-only device. Does that mean I'll have to unplug my modem each\ntime I want to print something???

The problem is that the pins in the ADB connector \nare close to each other, and if you happen to bend the\ncable a little while inserting it, you short the ADB\nport.

I have a chance to buy a used PS/2 Appletalk card to create a network with\nmy home machines.  However, the guy who has the card tells me there's a\nDB-9 or DB-15 (can't remember now) on the back of the card, rather than\nthe 8-pin (or 4-pin) mini-din that I expect.  This sounds more like a\nThicknet ethernet card.  Should there be a transciever on it, like on the\nQuadras?  What would be a reasonable price to expect to pay for one of\nthese cards, keeping in mind that it's Micro-Channel Architecture, which\nmeans take your best guess and double it.\nEmail replies would be appreciated, to here or to rrr@ideas.com\nThanks.\n[RICHR]

Okay, I don't use it very much, but I would like for it to keep working\ncorrectly, at least as long as Apple continues to make System software\nthat will run on it, if slowly :-)\n\nHere is the problem:  When the screen is tilted too far back, vertical\nlines appear on the screen.  They are every 10 pixels or so, and seem\nto be affected somewhat by opening windows and pulling down menus.\nIt looks to a semi-technical person like there is a loose connection\nbetween the screen and the rest of the computer.\n\nI am open to suggestions that do not involve buying a new computer,\nor taking this one to the shop.  I would also like to not have\nto buy one of Larry Pina's books.  I like Larry, but I'm not sure\nI feel strongly enough about the computer to buy a service manual\nfor it.\n\nOn a related note:  what does the monitor connector connect to?

The subject says what I would like to do, here are the details:\n\nI have a 512ke with the MacRescue upgrade board that makes it the\nequivalent of a Plus (System 7 and MacEnvy both identify it as such).\n\nThe MacRescue board clips onto the 68000 on the MB.  It also has\na 68000 itself.  Periodically I have to remove the clip (not an\nentirely easy thing to do) and clean the "legs" of the 68000.\nLarry Pina's book asserts that this is occasionally a problem with\nsnap on upgrades:  the 68000's "legs" will oxidize, causing \nunusual system errors.\n\nWell, that's me.\n\nSo, I would like to do something permanent, and I think it would be\nfairly easy to put a socket in where the 68000 currently is, and\nmodify the MacRescue board to plug in.  What I'm not 100% sure of\nis whether it will work.  It seems to me that the two 68000s aren't\nacting independently; so removing one shouldn't have any effect on\nthe performance of my Mac.  I'm about 97% sure.\n\nWill someone provide the extra 3%?
Approximately four months ago, I purchased a Quantum 240LPS HD from La Cie for\n$649. After two months, the drive started having problems. First, there were\nintermittent freezes, then corrupted files and resources, then Silverlining\n5.41 wouldn't even recognize the drive. So I got an RMA from La Cie and\nexchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one.\n\nWell, about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems.\nOften, when I boot up my IIsi I get the flashing question mark. Sometimes, if I\nthen insert the Silverlining (5.42) program I can get it to recognize the drive\nby making it scan over and over for drives. At that point I can restart the\nIIsi and boot from the HD. I've called La Cie again and they've given me\nanother RMA. Their tech support people tell me that if Silverlining doesn't see\nthe drive there's a definite hardware problem.\n\nGiven that this is the second bad drive in four months, I asked La Cie to send\nme a *new* one, but they said "no." Also, within three weeks after I purchased\nmy original drive, La Cie dropped the price on it by over $100.\n\nI can accept that a drive (or two) may be bad. And I know that hardware vendors\nmake a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs. And\nI understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden\nprice fluctuations. Nevertheless, taken together, the convergence of these\nfacts/events have left a bad taste in my mouth. (I should have added above that\nwhen I asked La Cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one\nthey will send_I think the data is still in good shape and I'll have to again\nreinstall everything from floppies_they said it would cost me $250 for data\nrecovery.)\n\nIt seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a\ndiscounted price, and that replacements for new hardware gone bad (still\ncovered under a 90-day warranty) should be new. \n\nI feel a little helpless about all this. I don't mean to necessarily flame La\nCie_their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful.\nBut c'mon. Sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way. (I sent\na letter to La Cie's customer service when the first drive was returned and I\nasked them for a credit on the price difference since I had purchased the drive\nthree weeks before they slashed the price. I told them I would like to apply\nthe credit toward the purchase of another La Cie product. They didn't even \nhave the courtesy to reply one way or the other.)\n\nWhat's the moral of this story? I'm not sure. But I do know I won't buy any\nother products from La Cie in the future.\n\nBill Krauthammer\nf2ehg786@umiami.ir.miami.edu

But, this is using a system designed\n for the 030. So, It stands to reason that a system designed for an 040 ie\n quadra) would do better. So overall I'd figure 040 = 030 * 2.5 or so.\n    Along the same lines the new POwerPC stuff is supposed to run the system\n at the level of a fast quadra, but system 8 or whatever will allow 3 times the\n speed of a 040 in the powerPC based systems. and wait for the 680060. I think\n it laps the pentium.\n\npro-life pro-women
In <C5nGII.BGx@news2.cis.umn.edu> bunt0003@student.tc.umn.edu (Monthian\n\n\nPerhaps the reason is simple--maybe the marketing people who put together\nthe brochures and price lists weren't clear on the FPU issue. \n\nAfterall, Apple's literature is not always 100% correct.

Hi!\nA while back, there was a thread in this group about the use of the IWII\nin Europe (in countries with 50 Hz AC current).  The consensus at the time\nwas that the IWII would not work there.  As I will be moving there this summer,\nI called Apple to make sure and they told me (today) that the IWII (as bought\nin the U.S.) will definitely run on 50 Hz AC current (as long as a step-down\nconverter is employed if 240 V current is used).  The same info, turns out, can\nbe found in the IWII manual (p. 127 in the 1989 version), but I didn't really\ntrust that.  Does anyone have any direct experience to the contrary?  Just \nwondering.

Second Wave makes NuBus card cages that work on the PDS slots of at\nleast three Macs: the SE/30, IIsi and Centris 610. They have not, to\nmy knowledge, announced such a device for the LCII, but they could\nmake one, technologically.\n\nThe PDS card that goes to the cage simply needs the NuBus controller\ncircuitry present on NuBus Macs.\n\nWhy, though, does anyone care about this? dgr has a three-PDS\nadapter for the LC/LCII. They will soon have one for the LCIII. PDS\nis better than NuBus for most people in most applications. Granted,\nthere are more NuBus cards. But, most applications that require a\nNuBus card (like full-motion video capture) shouldn't be done on an\nLC/LCII/LCIII anyway.
Nec Toshiba and Sony (Apple) nearly deliver the same speed.\nAs apples prices are very low (compared to there RAM SIMMS)\nYou should buy what is inexpencive. But think of Driver revisions.\nIt is easier to get driver kits from Apple than from every other\nmanufacturer\n\nChristian Bauer
Well, I also have an LC III.  Popping the top revealed:\n\n	One "socket" for an additional VRAM SIMM\n\n	One "socket" for a 72-pin RAM SIMM\n\n	One socket for a flat-pack FPU\n\n	A processor-direct slot (PDS) identical to the LC/LC II, but with\n	an additional set of connetions to one side (for the full 32-bit\n	data path that the LC/LC II lacked\n\nThat's it.  I guess a board with a PowerPC chip could be made that would fit\nin the PDS, but that's the only place.
I am selling my Global Village Teleport 2400 bps modem w/send fax. It\nconnects to the mac through the ADB port.  The software for sending\nfaxes is included.  I am asking $90.  However, I will consider other\nreasonable offers.  Please E-Mail me.\n\nDave
I hear that the Performa 450 is really an LCIII with an internal modem.  Can\nthe modem part be obtained and installed in an LCIII?  It would be nice if it\nwere actually a powerbook internal modem, but that might be too much to hope\nfor.
I recently aquired a Quantum Q250 harddisk. It is a 50 meg 5.25"\nmechanism. It is SCSI. I have a few questions and a few problems. First\nthere seems to be an extra connector socket on the back that I can't\nfigure out what it is for. The address is set by some jumpers on the\nbottom so I don't think it is for that. Any ideas?\n\nSecond, it would be nice to get a hardware manual for the drive. There are\na lot of jumpers on it that we don't know what they are for.\n\nThird, I have got the drive to format. It took a while to get things to\nwork and most of it is fine for now. The formating initialy was\ntroublesome but seems to be ok. The main problem is if you do a reset on\nthe MacPlus the drive disappears. If I shut the mac off and then back on\nagian then the drive comes up fine. Any ideas.\n\nPlease reply to one of the email addresses below.\n\nThanks
You macinators who have used these voice messaging/FAX/data-modems.  I\nhave a question.  First what brand names do you recommend(I am mostly\ninterested in the voice messaging and FAX part).  Is the voice part as\nreliable and understandable as the sellers claim?  Approximately, how\nmuch hard drive space does an average day of callers take up, if they\nspeak for one minute?  \nAny feed back would be appreciated.  My company is looking at buying\none or two.  Hey, I may buy one myself too.\n\nThanks in advance\nDon
A quick query for Powerbook gurus:\nTom Spearman, in a post on alternative Powerbook battery options\nmentioned that there exist 3 versions of their Powerbook 140-180\nbatteries: a 2.5 amp hour one (M5545/A), a 2.8 amp hour one,\n(M5545/B) and a 2.9 amp hour one (M5545/C). Anyone out there\nknow how to determine which of these a battery is? I looked at my\nbattery and there is no obvious exterior indication. I contacted\nTom Spearman who had gleaned the information from MacUser and he\ndidn't know either. Anyone out there know the answer?\n	Thanks!\n	Christopher Majka\n	nextug@ac.dal.ca
But the interesting comparision is how fast clock-cycle chips\nyou can get - an Alpha is WAY slow at 66 MHz, but blazes at\n200 MHz.\n\n\n\nBut the 68040 is (or will soon be) available in 40 MHz version,\nmaking it "comparable" to a 486DX2-80\n\n\nI think you have that one turned around; they have faster clock\ncycles but less power behind each cycle. Not to mention that the\nIntel instruction stream is BYTE-oriented (longest Intel instruction\nis 15 bytes; what an odd number :-) which makes it hard to do any\nintelligent memory subsystem.\n\nCheers,\n\n					/ h+\n-- \n -- Jon W{tte, h+@nada.kth.se, Mac Hacker Deluxe --

Has anyone had any problems with their Duo Dock not ejecting the Duo\nproperly?\n\nWhen I first got it, the Duo would come out of the Dock a couple of inches\nwhen ejected, and I had to pull it the rest of the way. Nowadays (and I've\nhad the system for 4 months), the Duo doesn't come out *at* *all* - despite\nthe fact that the mechanism makes all the appropriate noises, and I have to\ngrab hold of it and pull it out myself. Is there a simple fix for this, or\ndo I have to return it to my Apple Dealer, where it will languish for weeks\nwhile I have to make do with no colour display, no VRAM, no floppy or\nSCSI etc. \n\n(BTW, it's not that the Duo is locked into the Dock - it just doesn't\nwant to slide out any more).
The Duo Powerbooks seem to park the heads after a few seconds of\ninactivity... is that builtin into the drive logic or is it being\nprogrammed via software, any way to tune the iddle timeout that\nmakes the heads park themselves... I think the heads are being\nparked since after a few seconds of inactivity you can hear the\nclunk of heads parking.

The Mac has a sizeable share of the typesetting market, as in the U.S. A local magazine, Next Magazine (similar to Newsweek here), uses the Mac extensively. I have seen Sir Speedy and other franchises in Hong Kong equipped with Mac-based systems. True, the discount is not as steep as here because customers in Hong Kong cannot buy from gray market, nor are Mac being sold thru mass merchandisers like Apple does here with the Performa lin\n\n\ne. At this point the sale of Mac is handled by one exclusive distributor. On the other hand, you can always get a PC clone or in the earlier days, illegal clones of the Apple IIe.\n\nYour perception of the Mac not being too popular in Hong Kong is simply because most hobbyists and users find it much cheaper to go to one of those basement stores that sell PC clones with probably illegal copies of BIOS than to pay for a Mac.\n\nSimilarly you cannot say Lotus 1-2-3 surely is not well accepted in Hong Kong because the sale is so low. May be it is because of all those places in Kowloon where illegal copies of Lotus 1-2-3 can be bought for $20 and $10 for a professional looking but illegal copies of the manuals.
I can't say for sure with the IIvx -> C650 upgrade, but I wondered the\nsame thing when I ordered my LC -> LC III upgrade.  Turns out the "upgrade"\nis actually an entire CPU minus any disk drives.  You pull the floppy and\nhard drives out of the old one, stick them in the new one, and you've got\nan LC III.\n\nThe IIvx -> C650 may be the same thing.\n\nIt might be something to look into for those people who are unhappy that\nApple only sells Macs pre-packaged with the drives.  Of course, the price\nis quite a bit higher without the trade-in...
} I would like more info on this if anybody has it. Our Exabyte\n} 8500 tapedrive has never been working from the Quadra 950.\n} We have been trying it since September 1992, replaced cabling,\n} inits, I don't know what all. All the "industry experts" we\n} phoned (the tapedrive dealer, our Apple dealer, the software\n} dealer) all say it's our fault, or they don't know. The last\n} thing they said was that we needed a special Quadra SCSI terminator\n} (???). Anybody know more? Thanks,\n\n\nI have been using the PLI (SONY) 3.5" MO drive and now a Sharp color\nscanner using standard SCSI cables and STANDARD $20 terminator on my Q700. \nNo problems.  If you were using a IIfx, that might be another story.\n\nMake sure there is only one terminator in the cabling and it must be at the\nend.  Some boxes have internal terminators; some can be switched out and\nothers are socketted.  These count.  If the box with internal terminations\ncannot be put on the end to terminate the cabling, they have to be\ndisabled, ie, switched out or pulled out of their sockets.  If you have 2\nboxes with internal terminations, the terminations in one box has to be\ndisabled...., etc.  I am sure that this has been covered by the "experts".\n\nMy experience with SCSI boxes that connect to the Mac indicates that they\nmust have some software package for the Mac to 'talk' to them.  My PLI MO\ndrive and Sharp scanner has one for each.\n\nGood luck.
I have an old Mac Plus. A couple of years ago I bought a shiney new lc.\nIt came with apple's new keyboard (with abd ports). i replaced it with\na mac-pro-plus extended keyboard (which i thoroughly enjoy, thank you\nvery much).\n \nwell, i have this extra keyboard which i would like to use on the plus\nbut there's a little problem. the plus uses an rj-11 jack for keyboard\ninput and the new keyboards don't. i got an extra adb cable from my\nlocal apple dealer (they're such nice people), but they couldn't tell\nme the order of the wires.\n \nthere are four wires in the adb cables: black, white, red, tan. I know\none's a ground, one gets the serial signal, one supplies 5 volts, and\ni forgot what the fourth one does. anyway, if you hook them up wrong\nyou'll fry a board and i <really> don't want to do <that>.\n \nif any brave souls out there have done this before, please e-mail your\nexperience directly to me. i would greatly appreciate it especially\nsince apple's original keyboard is not . . . ergonomically correct.\n \nbtw, i did take apart my new keyboard to see if i could find the\ncorrelation between the wires for the rj-11 jack and the adb since it\nhas both, but no such luck (the connections are soldered inside of\nlittle boxes). Oh, well . . .
Add me to the list of bugged 230 owners.\n\nI had a bunch of problems regarding sleep/wakeup/restart with the 230 when\nI first got it, both with and without the techworks ram.  Finally it "died",\nwouldn't start, until I  opened the docking door (which snaps open) and \nthe machine came up fine, but with the clock a few decades off.  Apple \nreplaced the processor board.\n\nNow,\n  twice the machine has frozen (no mouse action)\n  twice the machine has refused to wake up.  Acutally, the backlighting\n    came on, and the disk spins when the power adaptor is plugged in\n    (but not with a good battery).\n    The first time this happened removing both power adaptor and battery\n      for ~1 minute brought the machine back.\n    The second time this happened the machine wouldn't wake up until\n      powered down for about 30 minutes.  The screen had what looked\n      like red horizontal lines accross it.\n    Both timse the file "fax modem preferences" has been corrupted\n      according to disinfectent).\n\nI have removed all the fax and modem software, and the third party memory,\nand am waiting to see if it happens again.\n\nforrest
The previous article referred to the fact that you could only use 20ns SIMMs in\na 50MHz machine, but that you could use 80ns SIMMs in slower machines. I just\npointed out that if you could only use 20ns SIMMs in a 50MHz machine, you can't\nuse 80ns SIMMs in anything faster than a 12.5 MHz machine. Bank switching and\ncaches were not considered in either example (although both would help memory\naccess).\n\n-- \nRavikumar Venkateswar\nrvenkate@uiuc.edu
Hi there!\n\nI wonder if anyone knows and can recommend me a good NuBus display\ncard for driving a 14" multisync (NEC 3D)?\nThe NEC 3D can do horizontal refresh from 15.5 kHz to 38 kHz and\nvertical from 50 Hz to 90 Hz and can do max 1024x768 interlaced,\nthough I am looking for something more like 800x600 or 832x624\nnoninterlaced.\nIt would be very nice to find a card which can be programmed quite\nfreely within these limits and is capable to display at least\n8bits/pixel, preferably more.\n\nIs there anything on the market that comes even close?\n\n\nThanks

I  have one of the original Powerbook 170's (with 4Mb of Ram) and find\nthat 4Mb is a drag when trying to do my work.  So, what is the best way\nto get the maximum RAM for this unit, and what's it going to cost me?\nI'm hoping I can get the latest and best info from real users by posting \nto this group.
I think you will find that the Mac SE can PRINT grayscale images, loaded\nwith the proper software. However, the Mac SE cannot DISPLAY grayscale on\nits screen or any attached video because that ability is not in the ROM.\n\nSo, while you might be able to PRINT grayscale, you'd have a hard time\nSEEING the grayscale image you want to print.\n\nDoug
I am resending this message because my news program may have goofed the first\ntime.\n\nTerry, I recently bought an LCIII and a Datadesk 101E. I don't\nremember trying to rebuild the desktop with it, however it did give me\na strange problem.  When I held down shift during startup to disable\nall extensions, nothing happened. I tried it with another keyboard, using\nthe same adb connector cable- and it worked with the other keyboard.\nThe shift key on the Datadesk keyboard worked well otherwise. I checked\nthe dipswitches and they are fine.  Try disabling your extensions and tell\nme if it works.\n             \nI am annoyed with Datadesk.  I sent them the keyboard in the mail for\ninspection/repair/replacement.  The technician on the phone said they\nhave a 10-14 day turn around time- meaning you should receive the\ninspected/repaired keyboard in that time.  Well, they have had the          \nkeyboard for over 3 weeks and I still have gotten very little info\nfrom them about it. It's annoying because it cost me $12 to send them\nthe keyboard and their technical support line is not toll free. tell me\nif you have a similar experience with them.
I have no experience with this particular hardware, but\njust about every month in Macworld there is an add for\nan combined SE accelerator/Video board.  This item sells\nfor about $1000 and comes with a 25MHz 68030/68882 pair,\neight SIMM slots, and a grayscale 21" monitor.\n\nThis accelerator plugs into the SE's lone expansion port\nand thus no soldering.  You will however, need a long\nTORX wrench to get the case open (but that's not really\na big deal).\n\nDoes that sound like what you were looking for?
Hello all,\n\nIf anyone knows of a place to get the case to hold the power supply and\nmotherboard of a Quadra 950 please let me know.  I have tried some mail\norder places and some local stores.  Both groups would prefer that I part\nwith over $1000 to get just the case.  In my eyes this seems about $600-$700\nto much.  Any comments?  I currently own the guts of a 950.\n\nPlease email me or post to this group w/ info,
I also use Retrospect, but I noticed that Central Point Software's\n"MacTools Backup" also supports the Apple tape drive under 7.x. \nThe Apple tape drive is quite slow, so the advantages of Retrospect\nrelative to the simpler MacTools Backup are less significant than \nmight be the case for someone backing up a large server to a DAT drive.  \n\nUsed Apple tape drives are going for ~$100, so it might make less\neconomic sense to pay an extra ~$140 for Retrospect when MacTools \nis cheaper and includes other worthwhile utilities.\n\nRetrospect is nice, though, and I'm probably going to upgrade to 2.0.
The Quadra 700 goes thru extensive initalize routines of its hardware,\nread's PRAM, obtains all info from last session including the volume\nsetting, and then executes the sound procedure for the startup sound, and\nwait's on the SCSI controller to respond to the boot up code.\n\n\nIf the DRAM produces an error, or a registers cannot be read from a device,\nor the device corrupts that address/data or control paths, then if it is\npossible, the firmware branchs to another sound routine that produces the \n'sad mac' sound.\n\n\nThis is a general breifing of the start up procedure of a typical mac.\nIf you cannot control the volume of the quadra, even at boot up, then i feel\nthere is something incorrect with the logic board. \n\nMy Quadra 700 does not show the problems you are having.
I also returned PB memory last summer for credit, and the sales person warned\nme not to use US mail.  I did (although I did insure the shipment), and \napparently Techworks got it.\n\nMy minor grip with techworks is that they have different price lists for\ndifferent people.  I ordered DUO memory, thinking I got their "best" price\nbecause of my employeer.  I subsequently found out that Apple was offering\ndevelopers memory for less than techworks charged, called up to complain,\nand was told I should have said I was an apple developer and they credited\nmy card for about 16% of the purchase price.   I like techworks quality\nand installation instructions (and they include powerbook tools), but \nfor out-of-CA purchases (no sales tax) chip merchant seems to be a bit less.
: >>My friend recently purchased a LC III and he wants to know if there is\n: >>such a demon called NuBus adapter for his PDS slot? \n\n: > The LC family of Macs can only\n: > use PDS cards. They are not able to use NuBus.\n\n: Ah, but why?  Can some technically-hip Macslinger tell us what the\n: difference is between PDS and Nubus?  \n\n: Is it impossible to make a gadget that plugs into PDS and ends in a\n: Nubus card cage?  At least, Marvin's friend has not been able to\n: locate one and neither have I.  What is the fundamental reason for\n: this?\n\nI think that there do exist NuBus expansion cages (I'm sure I've seen\nthem advertised occassionally), but I think that the main problem is that\nthey cost much more than the difference in price between say a LC and IIvx\nso unless you need lots of NuBus slots its not worth the bother.\n\n(Of course, it may be that these extra boxes are so expensive because\nno one buys them because they are so expensive...)\n\nNuBus technology isn't a special Apple Proprietry thing (I have this\nsneaky feeling that it is licensed from Texas Instruments???) so there\nis no problem building an expansion box.\n\nThe difference between NuBus and PDS is that NuBus is a clever interface\nwith lots of neat toys built in to make sure that lots of cards can work\ntogether on the same computer. PDS (processor direct slot) is just that:\nhere are all the connections to the processor. You can do anything with\nthis and it is as quick as it can be, but there's no cooperation. You\nmay be able to get double PDS slot adaptors but you try plugging 2\nvideo cards in, and just watch them conflict! Of course, the extra \nelectronics in a NuBus slot makes it appreciably more expensive, so\nguess why Apple doesn't put it in it's cheaper machines?\n\nSo, yah pays yer money and yah takes yah choice.

the \n\nNot Quite the point to be considdered here!\nFact: If/When Apple release system 7 (or what ever is current at the time \nof release) then you will see shortly afterwards Apple no longer producing \nHardware...Look at Next with their NextStep486 to see what happens.\nWho is going to pay Apples Prices when they can get the same thing cheaper \nelse where!

This is turning into a FAQ\n\n\nHere is how to violate your Quadra 700 warranty and install your own\nmemory.\n\n1)  Insert usual disclaimer here\n \n2)  Remove the top lid of the machine. You will see the floppy disk and\n    hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static\n    precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do\n    this. Unplug the wall and monitor power supply cords from the back\n	of the mac.\n \n3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the\n    tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.\n    The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the\n    tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may\n    also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power\n    supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you\n    need release.\n \n4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon\n    SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable\n    leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.\n    The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed\n    to release it.\n                                            \n5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount\n\n6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A\n    phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop\n    it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful\n    here.\n\n7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the\n    right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding\n	posteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then\n	lift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.\n\n8)  Congratulations, you have now gained access to your machine's SIMM\n    slots.\n\n9)  The six big slots are for VRAM. One usually must install all six to\n    gain useful video modes. All SIMMS (RAM or VRAM)  installed with their\n	chips facing the front of the motherboard.\n	\n    The four smaller sockets in front are for RAM SIMMS. Install SIMMS in\n	sets of four into these sockets. Be sure you seat the SIMMS squarely\n	and firmly into a fully upright position.\n	\n10) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the\n    tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about\n	1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into\n	place while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.\n    Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks\n    into place.\n	\n11) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY\n    DRIVE CABLE.\n\n12) Replace the phillips head screw\n\n13) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.\n\n14) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount
I have a new 25 MHz Motorola 68040 that I am willing to sell if I get\na good enough offer.  It is still in its static free sealed package.\n\nIf I don't get a good enough offer, I will use it to replace my 68LC040.\n\nAny takers?  \n\nSupposedly you can get one of these for $375.  However, at the moment the\ndemand is higher than the supply so I think $400 is a good round number.\nI will pay shipping, of course.

Is the LCIII\nsupposed to be shipped with IBMs?  Is there a quality difference? \nApparently! :)\n\nSecond, about hard drive position.  I've put the LCIII on its side and\nthe new 160 HD has had no problems at all.  I've even switched back and\nforth between horizontal and vertical and there are no problems.  As far\nas I'm concerned I don't believe HD position is important for drives up\nto 160 meg, in any computer.  Don't know about CD-ROM, though.\n\n\n	"Just like everything else in life, the right lane ends in half a mile."
Is there a fix for this? We have a Quadra 900 that will NOT finish startup\nunless there is a monitor connected. This would be no problem, but since\nwe're running it as a file server, there is no need to have a monitor\nconnected all the time.

Hi. I am looking into buying a Floptical Drive, and was wondering what  \nexperience people have with the drives from Iomega, PLI, MASS MicroSystems,  \nor Procom. These seem to be the main drives on the market. Any advice?\n\nAlso, I heard about some article in MacWorld (Sep '92, I think) about  \nFlopticals. Could someone post a summary, if they have it?\n\nThanks in advance. (Reply by post or email, whichever you prefer.)\n\n--Nizam\n\n--

There's absolutely no reason why differences in the DRAM access time \n_alone_ would cause an incompatibility.  There would have to be another \ndifference between the SIMMs for there to be a problem.  I've often used \nmemory of different speeds with no problems whatsoever.  As long as it's\nas fast (or faster) than the minimum requirement you should be fine.\n\nJust out of curiosity, did you actually try this and see a problem, or \nwere you told it wouldn't work and so never tried it?  Also out of \ncuriosity, do you know exactly who in Cupertino you dealer talked to (as \nI'd like to find out what they're basing this recommendation on).
Nope. The Apple 16" monitor does not support multiple resolutions.\nIt is not a multi-synching monitor.
: Could someone direct me to information on SCSI performance for each Mac?\n: (Max throughput, etc.)\n\nMax thruput on a Centris or Quadra is about 3.3 MB/sec.\nMax thruput on IIci or IIfx or equivalent is about 1.4 MB/Sec\nMax thruput on slower machines is slower.
Here's a question that may be simple enough to answer, but has stumped\nmyself and a few others:\n\nWhat does an external RAM cache card do for you if you already have a large\ncache set (through control panel) in your SIMMs?\n\nEX:  I have a Mac IIci with 20 meg RAM, an external video card (so I don't\nrob my SIMM's), and the default Apple cache card (I believe this is 32K?). \nSay I have my cache set at 2 MEG, what good does a measly 32K do me on the\ncache card?  Could it actually slow things down by dividing the cache\nbetween the card and the SIMM's?  Or does it still speed things up by\nproviding a 'secondary staging' area for data normally passed directly into\nthe SIMM RAM cache?\n\nI'm confused because it seems like cache cards are so low in memory to\nreally do any good compared to what you can set yourself.  Yet, Daystar\nFastCache has numbers which show around a 30% performance boost on some\noperations.  Are the chips on the cache card simply faster than most SIMM\naccesses?\n\nPlease help, I'm trying to find the optimum memory settings for the IIci\nsystem described in the EX above.
Hi, I have been getting a lot of requests for this information so I thought\nI would post it for those interested parties. (Sorry for length).\n\nTo increase the MacIISi speed to 25MHz or 33MHz the clock must be changed\nfrom 40MHz to 50MHz or 64MHz respectively.\nThis is done by going to a static-free work station or putting some\naluminum foil down to work on.\n	1. Open up the Si by lifting the tabs at the back of the case.\n	2. Remove the Hard Disk by disconnecting the power and SCSI cables,\n		spreading the tabs, and lifting the drive out.\n	3. Remove the flopy drive.\n	4. Remove the power supply by spreading the tab in front and lifting\n		the supply straight up and out.\n	5. Remove the fan by pressing the ears together at the back, bottom\n		side of the fan and lifting straight up and out.\n	6. Remove the Mother Board by spreading the tabs on the left and\n		right side of the board and sliding the board forward then\n		lifting the board out. (all connectors on the back of the\n		board must be removed first)\n	7. Desolder the 40MHz clock (the one closest to the memory modules).\n		This is not easy even for a skilled solderer.\n	8. Get an IC socket with the round pins and remove four of the pins\n		by pushing them up from the bottom with long nose pliers.\n	9. Put the four pins in the holes vacated by the clock and solder \n		them in.\n	10.Insert a 50MHz or 64MHz clock.\n	11.Put large power transistor heat sink's on the processor chip and \n		the other large chip just to the right of the processor and\n		figure some way to hold the heat sync's in place. I made a\n		simple clamp by putting a four inch screw up through the hole\n		in the board between the two chips. Mount the screw using\n		insulated washers. Screw a cross member down over the heat\n		sync's to hold them in place. Don't use too much pressure.\n\n	12. Put it all back together and go-for-it.\n\nDisclaimer: this is only the procedure I used and is not authorized by anyone.\n	    You are on your own for this procedure. I'm quite sure it will\n	    void your warentee.
Just my luck.  I did however call my local Apple dealer and he said that\nthe he thinks the serial numbers of the machines that are covered begin\nwith either 70 or 53-56, and maybe one other.

It would also be great for another reason - when not docked, it could serve\nas an ARA server to the large internal HD, your corporate email, etc.  In\na pinch, you would also have two machines, instead of 1.5.\n\nIf they could couple that thought with RocketShare, and let you use both the\n'030 on the PB and the '040 on the dock, it would be a mighty powerful dock.\n\n--
Their should be no difference in the drive itself between IBM-PC and Mac.\nThe two main differences are the formatting of the disk itself (but with\nthe correct software each can read the others) and maybe the cable\n(depends on your SCSI board on IBM-PC).\n\nIf you get some Mac softawre to allow mounting of ANY IBM-formatted disk\nand the correct cable you should br able to mount and read your IBM-PC\nsyquest.\n\ngood luck,\n\n--Paul\n\n-- \n  +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n  | Paul Hardwick  |  Technical Consulting  |  InterNet: hardwick@panix.com |\n  | P.O.

I haven't seen much info about how to add an extra internal disk to a\nmac. We would like to try it, and I wonder if someone had some good\nadvice.\n\nWe have a Mac IIcx with the original internal Quantum 40MB hard disk,\nand an unusable floppy drive. We also have a new spare Connor 40MB\ndisk which we would like to use. The idea is to replace the broken\nfloppy drive with the new hard disk, but there seems to be some\nproblems:\n\nThe internal SCSI cable and power cable inside the cx has only\nconnectors for one single hard disk drive.\n\nIf I made a ribbon cable and a power cable with three connectors each\n(1 for motherboard, 1 for each of the 2 disks), would it work?\n\nIs the IIcx able to supply the extra power to the extra disk?\n\nWhat about terminators? I suppose that i should remove the resistor\npacks from the disk that is closest to the motherboard, but leave them\ninstalled in the other disk.\n\nThe SCSI ID jumpers should also be changed so that the new disk gets\nID #1. The old one should have ID #0.\n\nIt is no problem for us to remove the floppy drive, as we have an\nexternal floppy that we can use if it won't boot of the hard disk.\n\nThank you!

Not a good idea to compare processor power. Doesn't make sense for real\nworld applications.

Can some people with cache cards PLEASE post speedometer numbers they get\nwith the cards. I have only one report, which seems to indicate that\na 32K cache card gives you only about a 1% speedup!!

Gosh, I wish people would read the postings that they are 'following up' to.\n\n\nThe original poster (W G Wright) posted an item saying that he had bought a new\nwizz-bang Laser Printer from Apple (a Select 300 I think) which can print\nGrayScale. He then said that he CANNOT PRINT GRAYSCALE from his SE computer\n(and also that all the 'experts' he has dealt with agree that it is not\npossible).\n\nThis is the one major bugbear about doing a 3rd party SE upgrade (compared to\nApple's SE to SE/30 upgrade): you will never be able to run Color Quickdraw. It\nis Color Quickdraw that controls Color AND Grayscale.\n\nSEs CAN print some COLOUR: this is because Quickdraw - the original, non-colour\nversion, has the right hooks for eight colours. Some of you will remember the\n'SCSIgraph' solution to getting a colour screen for your SE (I think that it\ngave you sixteen colours by dithering or something).\n\nThere is no reason that Apple couldn't release software patches for older\ncomputers (there are lots of Mac Pluses, Classics and SEs that have been\nupgraded to 68020 and 68030 processors which should be perfectly able to deal\nwith Color Quickdraw) - but they wont, and 3rd parties are having a difficult \ntime in duplicating the Mac's ROMs (i.e. Nutek et al.).\n\nJust one Caveat: I would have thought that if you were printing a POSTSCRIPT\nGrayscale image onto a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale printer, that you would be able to\ndo so, whatever Mac you were using. (And I am pretty sure that the Select 300\nis NOT a POSTSCRIPT printer [? correct me if I'm wrong?]).
stuff deleted\nstuff deleted\n\nThe problem mentioned last is a known Quadra SCSI problem, it was heavily\ndiscussed last year and an Apple employee pointed out that there was a\none byte error in the SCSI driver routine for the Quadra's (at least the\n700\nand 900).  System 7.1 should not have that problem, for most people the \nsolution was to get an updated driver from the drive manufactor.  In my\ncase MASS Microsystems wrote a new driver which fixed the problem on my\nQuadra\n700, all that occured early last year.
I think you must be talking about the Syquest 105 (code named Mesa I believe).\nIt is a 3.5" Winchester technology drive pretty much like the other Syquest\ndrives in terms of how it works. According to the latest MacLeak, the \ndrive has a 14.5 ms access time, 1.9 MB/s sustained throughput (these figures\nare from memory so they could be slightly off, but they give you an idea of\nperformance nonetheless). The drive was originally released for the PC\nand just recently was released for the Mac world (don't ask me what the \ndifferences are) and through they are currently in limited supply, according\nto a Syquest rep. they are in the process of ramping up for mass production.\nI have already seen them advertised by a number of manufacturers in MacLeak\nincluding PLI, MassMicro, ClubMac, and MacWarehouse's PowerUser. The PLI\nand MassMicro units are priced at just around $1000; the lesser name brands\nare going for around $750 for an external drive. Cartridges which hold \n105 MB sell for about $80 each. At these prices, the drives and cartridges\nare cheaper and better performing than the 88MB drives.\nCost per megabyte compares favorably with other cartridge drives and Bernoulli\ndrives, but for large amounts of data optical is still cheaper, and more\nreliable.  Personally, I'm excited by the new drive and look forward to \ngetting my hands on one.\n-Chris Wand\n\n--

Here is the MacWeek article describing the DUO ram situation.\n(w/o permission.  I hope that is ok)\n\nJose\n\nBad RAM brings some Duos down. (random access memory boards for Apple\nMacintosh PowerBook Duos) \nMacWEEK v7, n7 (Feb 15, 1993):132.\n\nCOPYRIGHT Coastal Associates Publishing L.P. 1993\n\nBy Raines Cohen\n\n     Austin, Texas - Some third-party memory-expansion cards for PowerBook\nDuos depart from Apple specs in ways that could cause crashes, data loss\nand other problems.\n\n     Technology Works Inc., a RAM and network vendor based here, last week\nissued a warning about three problems it said it had found in Duo RAM\nproducts from some competing vendors, which it declined to identify.\nOther vendors and an Apple spokeswoman confirmed that the problems exist.\n\n     > Self-refresh.  The Duos require a kind of dynamic RAM called\nselfrefreshing, which can recharge itself while the system sleeps.  But\nTechnology Works said some vendors have sold Duo cards with\nnonselfrefreshing DRAM, which can cause the system to lose data or fail to\nwake from sleep.\n\n     Most leading memory manufacturers include the letter V in the part\nnumber stamped on their self-refreshing chips; nonself-refreshing chips\ninstead have an L, according to TechWorks.  The chip label, however, may\nnot tell the whole story.  Newer Technology of Wichita, Kan., said it uses\nnonself-refreshing chips but adds its own circuitry to keep them refreshed\nwhile the Duo sleeps.\n\n     > Speed.  Some RAM-card vendors have put 80-nanosecond DRAM on Duo\ncards rather than the 70-nanosecond type the 230 requires, Technology\nWorks said.  However, some chips labeled as 80- or 85-nanosecond are\ncertified by the manufacturer to run at a higher speed.\n\n     Kingston Technology Corp. of Fountain Valley, Calif., said it offers\nDuo RAM cards with 80-nanosecond chips, but only for the Duo 210, which is\ncompatible with the slower chips.\n\n     > Space.  Technology Works charged and Apple officials confirmed that\nsome third-party cards are too large to fit properly, forcing the corner\nof the Duo keyboard up and preventing the system from starting up normally\nwhen in a Duo Dock.
Hi,\n\nThe subject line says it all.  My system acts weird at times.  All of a\nsudden the system will be corrupt, boot blocks will get chewed, etc.\n\nThis was a really big problem for a while.  I couldn't even format my\ndrive properly.  I installed HDT's driver and things got better.  Now\nall I have to do is reinstall the system.  Could an incompatibility \nexist between it and a Quantum external drive.\n\nI'm looking for a pure hardware solution.  It's not a virus, bad\nsoftware, etc.  Could I have a bad SCSI cable?  Or is the IBM (WDS-80)\njust a screwey drive?\n\nThanks,\n\nChuck\n\n-- \nChuck Williams ==> CS Intern ==> Pacific Northwest Laboratories
My Datadesk Mac 101E keyboard has similar problems. I have found that\nholding down the RIGHT-HAND shift key at startup will work (disable\nextensions), but the left-hand shift key won't (which is unfortunate, since\nthe left one is the one I instinctively reach for).\n\nSimilarly, I have trained myself to hold down the RIGHT-HAND pair of\ncommand-option for desktop rebuilds.\n\nI *is* irritating.\n\nCheers,\nMichael.

I just got a Quadra 800 8/230 and I've noticed that I can't change the\ndesktop color from the beautiful gray.  I thought maybe I should reinstall\nthe OS using the "Install Me First, Macintosh Centris, Quadra..." diskette\nbecause the system file on this diskette is more recent than the one on the\nhard disk.\n\nThe easy install selects "Macintosh Cnetris System Software".  Does anyone\nknow if I should use this or customize and use "System Software for any\nMacintosh"?  Or does it matter?\n\nTHANKS in advance for any suggestions...
Did you remember to clamp ground to the engine block first?
Title says it all.  I'd be particularly interested in the performance\ndifference.  Just how much faster (50%?) is the Centris 610 over the LCIII?\n\n--Tom

I would really like to get one of the new CD300i CDROM\ndrives for my c650, but my local Apple doesn't know \nwhen they will be available.  He doesn't even have a part\nnumber yet.

Hi!\n\n   I'm looking into buying a serial port switcher, because while my Mac has\ntwo serial ports, I have AppleTalk, a modem, a printer, MIDI, and a sound\ndigitizer.  (2 != 5, unfortunately.)\n\n   Specifically, I'm looking at the Axion electronic switcher, because it\nseems to be fairly cheap.  (About $128 at MacZone.)\n\n   Does anyone know anything about it?  I've heard that with most of these\nthings you can still only use 2 serial ports at a time, it just prevents you\nfrom physically swapping cables.  Although I've also heard that programs\nthat use the Comm Toolbox may be able to use as many serial ports as they\nwant; does anyone know if this is true with the Axion switchbox?\n\n   Finally, if the Axion stinks, or if you're using something else that you\nthink is good, I'd be interested in hearing about other products.  I would\nlike to spend under $140, if possible.\n\n   Please reply through mail; I'm not a regular reader of this newsgroup.\nIf there's interest, I can post a summary of replies.\n\nThanks a lot!

I know that Jet Inc makes refills for the Stylewriter and Deskwriter\nink jet cartridges in several colors....but are pre-filled cartridges\nin color available from anyone (or do I have to use-up one cartridge \nbefore I have a chance to print in color?)\n\nAlso, are inks in process colors (cyan, magenta, yellow) available\nto refill cartridges?
There's this old SE here. It's got the older-style fans that remind\nme of a house-ventilator. A cylindrical drum instead of the bladed rotor\nI usually see. Anyway, the SE makes this loud buzzing noise due\nto vibration somewheres. If I remove the screws and loosen the front\nfrom the back, it quiets down.

Yea, thanks to lots of good information in this newsgroup, I was prepared\nfor lots of details (even shipping time ... got my C610 8/230/CD in 5 weeks).\nI guess my biggest disappointment is the lack of detail in the written\nspecs and documentation.  The case load spec is an example -- the setup\nsection says Apple 14" and 16" monitors can go on top, but 21" and other\nbig ones can't.  Why couldn't they publish a maximum load?\n\nNow if I can figure out if there's any hope using the "partition" button\non the hard disk setup utility (do I dare just try it and see what happens?),\nthen maybe I can divide up the wealth among the family members a bit more\nsecurly.  The "getting more information" section of the manual suggested\ntrying other avenues before calling Apple, but didn't mention the net.
Another program which produces this effect is:\n- SpyGlass Transform 2.1 (while contouring a big 257*257 array).\n\nThanks for any information about this problem,

Peter, I'm sure someone out there has a better/easier way to do what you want\nto do, but I'll tell you how we do it where I work. We have about 15 Macs\nnetworked together using Appletalk and PhoneNet connectors. To chat we use a\nprogram called 'Broadcast'.

No.  Plug the printer in the printer port, and the modem in the modem\nport. ;)
The trackbal on my PB140 no longer moves in the horizontal direction.  When I\ncalled the nearest Authorized Apple Service person I was told that it probably\nneeded replacing and that would cost me over $150!  Ouch!\n  Can anyone recommend a less expensive way to fix this problem?  One strange\nsymptom of the problem is that when I take the ball out of the socket and shine\na light into the hole I can make the cursor move horizontally by moving the\nwheel with my finger, it works fine that way but won't work if I turn off the\nlight.  Any suggestions or comments?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBen Roy .......just a poor college student.......internet<br4416a@american.edu>
I have tested this on a 230 and it does work there.  So it would\nseem that the 140 and 170 are out though.  One way to tell is to\ngo and open the PowerBook control panel(7.1).  There is a setting\nthere that allows you to set the time to wake up the Mac.  If it\nis present when you open the control panel, then you can assume that\nSetWUTime will work.
Yes. That is exactly what it means. The LC family of Macs can only\nuse PDS cards. They are not able to use NuBus.

The IIIP has just been superseded by the 4M, which is the one I am using at\nwork.  The quality of the print is execellent, beating 300 dpi printers hands\ndown.  In Australia the price of the 4M is about comparable with that of the\nIII-series, so HP are trying to get people to buy the new one !!!

------ X-posted to comp.sys.mac.hardware and misc.consumers -------\n\nYou've heard about Apple's great new customer "support" program.  Well,\nthink again.  Sometimes the only real support out there is what Apple\ncomputer users can give to each other.  For another example, read on:\n\nIn the March 15th issue of _MacWeek_, Ric Ford described a two-year effort\nby Liam Breck to document and bring to Apple's attention a problem with\ncertain defective mice.  At random, the switches on these mice "stick" in\nthe down position until clicked a second time, apparently regardless of the\nmachine they are used with or the system software involved. Most of the\nreported problem mice were manufactured in Malaysia and have an FCC ID of\nBCGA65431. You'll recognize this "sticky button" symptom immediately if you\nhave such a mouse: the problem is intermittent, but it's not subtle.\n\nLiam Breck recently gave up trying to document this problem, and instead \nsuggested that people contact Apple's Customer Assistance Center directly\n(_MacWeek_ 4/5/93 p. 64). When I called Apple on March 23rd and described\nmy defective mouse, I was eventually given a case number (F83Y) and told\nApple would replace this mouse even though it is a few months out of\nwarranty.  After waiting for three weeks, I called back today wondering\nwhere my new mouse was. This time, I was told that Apple had decided the\nserial number on my mouse (MB13831FC25) is not within the (undisclosed)\nrange Apple is willing to replace, and there is nothing I can do about it.\n\nNothing, that is, unless enough people complain about this problem to make\nit worth Apple's while to fix or replace the entire lot of defective mice.\nPlease, if you have one of these mice, I NEED YOUR HELP! Don't assume you\nknow what causes the problem (there are _lots_ of theories) and start\nhacking around inside your hundred-dollar mouse. Instead, let Apple do it.\nPlease take five minutes to CALL APPLE RIGHT NOW at:\n\n                  United States      1-800-776-2333\n                  Canada             800-665-2775\n                  UK and Europe      33-1-49-01-49-01\n                  Australia          61-2-452-8000\n                  Japan and Pacific  81-3-5411-8500\n\nIf the number isn't toll-free, call collect.  Describe the problem and ask\nfor a replacement mouse.  Even if they refuse, insist that they register\nthe details of your case, including your mouse's serial number.  Be firm.\n\nNetwork managers and user-group leaders especially, please query your user\nbases. Everyone ask your friends and colleagues.  Please don't send mail to\nme or post yet another "sticky-button" report, CALL APPLE DIRECTLY!  If\nenough victims take the trouble to report this well-known problem, Apple\nwill eventually be forced to respond.  If Apple continues to find it easy\nto stone-wall on this issue, don't expect them to offer support when the\nnext, potentially more serious Mac defect is uncovered.
In the May issue of C't Magazine was an article about upgrading 040 models\nof apple. They simply change crystals and add a fan.\nHammerhead: Centris 610 was able to work with 25 MHz (cooler prefered)\n            and for 1000 DM you get an 68040 (33MHz) which works with the\n            appropriate crystal at full speed. (extra cooling required)    \n            Centris 650 like Quadra 700 with extra cooling 33MHz works on\n            most machines and for real power enthusiasts they used a\n            Quadra 950 at 40 MHz wow! But for better description you should\n            get this issue of C't (a german PC magazine!) \n\nChristian Bauer
I remember reading a thread a few days ago that mentioned removing an external\nsyquest drive from its case and dropping it in the internal drive of a Centris.\n. . I was going to do that with my 610, but had a couple of questions.  My\nPLI 80M syquest drive has a wire from the drive to an id# switch on the\noutside of the case.  Where do I connect this switch??  Can the computer just\n"tell" with internal drives?  \n	I noticed that the drive will lay over part of the motherboard (I\ndidn't look closely, but I seem to recall it laying over the ram that's\nsoldered onto the motherboard?  Would that cause problems?\n	One last question!  Is there anywhere to order a faceplate cover?  \nthe drive's front panel is smaller than the space left in the case (the\ndrive's panel is the same size as the spotsBM clone's cases).  Should I just\ncut a hole in the plastic panel that is currently holding tmpty place?
Ben,\n\nSince you're obviously adept enough to understand how the trackball works,\nthe only thing short of repairing it that I can think of is a thorough\ncleaning of all the parts, and then checking for the proper placement of\nthe little blue rollers. Since they aren't fixed in position on their\nstainless steel pins, you might try sliding them into a slightly different\nposition. On my PowerBook 100, I can slide them almost completely out of\ncontact with the trackball. In fact, one of the notes from sumex on fixing\nthe trackball advocates sliding the roller so that its _edge_ contacts the\nball, not the center cylindrical area.\n\nI've done this with my PB100, and it does seem to improve the feel, but\nneeds to be adjusted from time to time. I just popped open one of our\noffice's PB170s, and while there isn't as much latitude for movement, one\ncould still adjust the roller slightly. If your PB140 is the same it might\nhelp.\n\nI would suspect the most likely culprit to be a slippery blue roller. If\nyou can take it out, clean it with a mild soapy solution, or isopropyl \nalcohol. Also, be sure the ball is grease-free.\n\nIf you drop the ball in minus the retaining ring, roll the ball and see\nif it is actually causing the axle to spin. \n\nIf all this still doesn't solve it, then maybe a new one is in order. :-(\nIt could be an electrical connection, in which case replacement would be\nnecessary. But my experience with both mice and trackballs has been that\ndirt has been the normal problem, not an electrical malfunction.\n\nHope this helps,\n\nMurray

The audio will simply select the CD audio when the microphone is removed. \nI don't believe the button un-dims, since there's nothing to select.

Mac IIsi.\n\nI have had my Q700 running with a 66.666 MHz osc for a few months. I have a\nnumber of SCSI devices connected (Quantum LP52, Maxtor 213, Toshiba MK156F via\nEmulex adapter, Pioneer DRM-600) and have had no trouble.\n\nI am using the stock cooling facilities, I considered adding a fan/heat pump,\nbut don't feel they are necessary (for my box anyway). I have a temp meter on\norder and plan to do some measurements when it arrives in a few weeks. Email me\nif you want to see the results.
Battery powered devices like the PowerBook are sometimes more sensitive to \nserial port weirdness.  I had trouble with connecting my Mac Plus to an HP 95LX\nhandheld.  Everything else worked okay on that port, but not the HP. (it runs\non two penlite batteries).  It turned out that the plus (by accident or by \ndesign flaw?) was putting a 4 volt bias on the serial port that was doing \nweird things to the HP (which has only 3v dc!).  The HP worked fine when \nconnected to the printer port.  \n\nDoes your PB screen get dim or anything when connected to the device?  Have you \ntried using the printer port?\n\nGood luck. \n\n--jamie
A professor of mine once said "The difference between a Computer Engineer and\na Computer Scientist is about $5000" meaning the Engineer makes $5000 more than\nthe CS.\nSeriously though the main difference is that most CS people write programs that\npeople will use, i.e. database, graphics, word processors, etc., while an\nengineer writes for machines or control systems, i.e. the "computer" in your\ncar, a flight control system, computer controled devices, etc. In other words\nCS writes SOFTWARE while CSE writes FIRMWARE. \nThese are generalizations but for the most part that is what the difference is.

The screws are Torx screws and the tool isn't to hard to find. It's a\nmatter of finding one with a long enough shaft to do the trick. \n \nNo it is not a good idea to take that fan out.

I've known people to have hard drive\nfailures because of fans that didn't work right....
Hi. I own an LCIII and I recently heard an interesting rumor.\nI heard that the LCIII has a built in slot for a PowerPC chip.\nIs this true? I heard that the slot is not the same as the PDS\nslot.  Is that true?
The IIvx...LCIII performance at a Centris 610 price. The only reason\nto get an IIvx is if you really need the full-size Nubus slots. Keep \nin mind that the 610 supports all Apple monitors and has optional Ethernet.\nThis lessens (but doesn't eliminate) the need for Nubus cards. And unless\nyou're running FPU-intensive software, the 610 will blow the doors off the\nLCIII and the IIvx. The LCIII, on the other hand, is sufficient for most\npeople and has a great price.\n\nIf you haven't guessed, I find halving the bus clock (the IIvx 32MHz uP vs.\n16MHz bus) a throughly bad thing and I hope Apple never does it again.\n-- \n______________________________________________________________________________

Hello all!\n\nFor few past days I've been fighting to get My NEC Multisync 3D\n(predecessor of 3FG) to work properly with the internal video of Mac\nIIvi.\n\nWith a VGA-adapter (as described in Dale Adams' posting about Quadra\nvideo) it works, only some minor interferences occur, small enough not\nto prevent any action on screen to be visible & clear.\n\nBut because the scanrates & stuff of 3D are well enough for emulating\nApple 13" RGB, I first made an adapter, then got one fron the local\ndistributor of NEC.\nWith both adapters I can get a picure, which looks excellent most of\nthe time or every now and then.\nBut with radical changes on screen (opening palettes, large windows\netc.) there are major interferences in sync. The picture either tilts\nsideways or scrables up totally. Even when it is clear, there are some\n"spiky" interferences on horizontal line alignment when accessing\npull-downs etc.\nWith the self-made adapter, almost identical to the VGA one, only\nsense pins differ, it is sometimes impossible to even boot up with a\npicture clear enough to shut down from menu...\nWith the adapter from NEC, everything is well most of the time, but\nsometimes the picture tilts badly sideways or the sync is completely\nlost.

Does GX take the place of 32 bit QD or add to it?

I've had a couple of e-mail responses from people who seem to believe that\nthis sort of thing is not only unsupported, it is downright dangerous.\n\nI have heard of no such warnings from anybody at Apple. Just to be sure, I\nasked a couple of our technicians, one of whom has been servicing Macs for\nyears. There is *no* danger of damaging logic boards by plugging and unplugging\nADB devices with the power on.\n\nSCSI, yes, ADB, no...
The 3FGx has a maximum horizontal scan rate of 49KHz, so driving it\nat 60.24KHz to get 1024 x 768 on the Mac is WAY BEYOND the tolerance            The 4FG is spec'ed at 57KHz, so going 60.24KHz is only 5-6% above\nthe minimally guaranteed figure.\n\nI too doubt if the Damark monitor would sync to a Mac at 1024 x 768.            Like most things, you get what you pay.  That's the deal.\n\n-John Rutirasiri.
Be very careful when you plug in a external monitor and a external speaker.\nMake sure that all the power cords are in the same strip.  If you don't you\ntake a chance of having a very bad audio buzz.  This is caused be a "ground loop" and the only way of getting rid of this loud buzz is to make sure that you \nhave a common ground.                                \nMake sure that all the power cords are going in to the same strip or off the \nsame outlet.  This will assure you of a common ground.
Excuse me but... have not all Macs got a CPU!!!
the Q700 will only do 8bit or 24bit color.  if you want the higher\ncolor depth, it's 2MB's of VRAM altogether for a monitor up to 16".\n\nfor a 21" monitor, you can get 8bit max.\n\nhope this answers your questions.
The Partition button in Apple's HD Setup lets you set up A/UX and other\ntypes of partitions. It WON'T let you create more than one normal mac\nvolume.

Hi everyone. Just the other day, I ordered a VRAM chip for my new LCIII from\nMac Connection. They sent it overnight (very nice) and I got it installed,\nand we found that it didn't work properly. When you put the computer in \nthousands mode, the bottom of the screen (using the new chip) is all flickering\nand fuzzy. So I called them up and I'm going to return it for a new one.\n\nMy question is, how often does such a thing happen with SIMM chips in general?\nDo you often find when ordering chips that a large portion are bad? Is this\na rarity? This is the first chip I've ordered so I have no other experience\nin this area. I'm just curious if anyone else has had the same type of\nexperience.\n\nThat's about it. Please email me, and if people want, I can post a summary.\nThanks all.\n-- \nHillel Sims  -----  simsh@rpi.edu  -----  Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
I have an SE/30 with a 80 meg HD which dates back to April 1989.  When I\noriginally purchased it, I experienced the failure to boot problem.  This\nwas fixed soon after by a ROM upgrade on the hard drive.\n\nLately a similar problem has been occuring.  When the computer is\npowered on the HD light flashes a few times and then I am given\nthe "no disk to boot from" icon.  However, upon turing the\ncomputer off and on again the drive ALWAYS boots up just fine.  \nFurthermore, if instead of turning the power on and off I press the reboot \nbutton the same problem occurs.  But, as I said, turning the power\noff and on always works.\n\nThis problem is different from the 1989 boot problem in that before\nit often required several power off and ons to get it to boot.\n\nDoes anybody have any suggestions as to what the problem is or how\nit can be fixed?\n\nI'm wondering if it's getting old and requires more time to \n"come up to speed" now.  Is there a PRAM or SCSI setting that\nallows me to tell the computer to wait a little longer before \ntrying to access the HD?\n\nThanks!

My company has developed an application for the Mac that emulates a chart\nrecorder - virtual pen traces scroll smoothly across the screen.  As we\ntested the application on a number of computers we discovered some\nsurprising performance differences across products.  The scroll performance\nof the IIsi and LCII was better than the IIfx. This led us to investigate\nColor Quickdraw performance across the Apple line.\n\nThe results:\n\nThe fastest QuickDraw color performing computer Apple makes is the\n(drumroll please) LCIII.  And the Color Classic ranks right up there with\nthe Quadra line.  The Centris line pales in comparison.\n\nDoes anybody know the differences in these computers that explains the\ndisparity in graphics/processor performance?

Hello,\n\n	I remember running across an ad in the back of Mac[User|World]\na few years ago, for a Nubus board that had umpteen SIMM slots, to be\nused to "recycle your old SIMMs," when you upgraded memory.  I don't\nremember who made this board, and I haven't seen it advertised in\nany of the latest Mac magazines.  It mentioned that it included software\nto make the SIMMs on the board act like a RAM disk. As someone who has SIMMS \nhe can't get rid of/use, but hates the waste, this sounds to me like a majorly\ngood idea.  Does anyone out there know what board/company I'm talking about?  \nAre they still in business, or does anyone know where I can get a used one\nif they are no longer made?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Please\ne-mail me, to save net.bandwidth.\n\n\n	Thanks,\n\n	Cap.
terminated\n\nIt is very possible to connect another internal hard disk in any\nmacintosh if you can find the space to put it. I have a IIsi that came\nwith a Quantum 80 meg drive. When I ran into space problems, I slapped in\nanother 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf. Here is what I did.\n \nFirst off, I was concerned about space. Since both drives are Quantum\nquarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for them\nwas stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had a\nproblem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together for\nover two months.\n\nThe next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internal\nhard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. just\nsplice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard\nconnector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don't have a spare\ncable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found\nin any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properly\nsoldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of\nshorts or bad connections.\n\nNext, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard disk\nribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn't word so what\nI did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another\nmale connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again,\nand is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using a\ncrimp on connector is that if this doesn't work, my original cable is not\ndamaged, and I can go back to the original setup.\n\nHaving done all that, I couldn't be bothered to check the dev notes for\npower consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this\nday. \n\nIn a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID's of\nthe drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are\nintact. I did not try this without the terminating resistors but it\nseemed logical that if I am splitting the SCSI chain, that the signal\nshould be terminated at all the ends.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions.
Can anyone tell me what the difference is between a 256K DRAM chip and a\n256K SIMM? I need the former (I think) to add memory to my Laserwriter\nLS. Someone is offering to sell me 256K SIMMS he removed from an SE, but\nI have a feeling this may not be the correct form of memory. The sockets\nin the Laserwriter look like they want the spidery-shaped chips (there\nare 4 sockets, each with, as I recall, 20 pins, arranged in two rows of 10). Believe it or not, I've never actually seen a SIMM. Help appreciated.
The magnet trick will work. Be careful when you apply the white tape to the\nrubber carriage roller, it tells the scanner where the edge is and it can come\noff.\n\nJim
You must not have tried very hard. I just opend mine in about 2\nseconds. Take a look on the bottom, it has a dial that turns to open\nmuch like the older ADB mouses used to have. It's a bit harder to turn\nat first but it is quite simple to open.\n\n\n    Well, if you don't match up the pins correctly you will have some\nproblems. A close look at the socket should give you an idea of the\nproper orientation of the chip.
10). \n\n  A 256K DRAM chip is a 256 kilobit chip whereas a 256K SIMM is a 256\nkilobyte memory module. The SIMM is a PCB with a 30 pin connector edge\nand on the SIMM are 8 256 kilobit DRAM chips (making the total memory 256\nKBytes.\n \n  You are correct assuming that SIMMs will not fit into a LaserWriter.\nApple printers either require 64 pin SIMMs like those in the Mac IIfx or\nspecial memory chips. Contact your Apple dealer to find out exactly what\nkind of chips you need.
If you write a second time to a CD you need to have multi-session capability to\nread the second session.  Whether it is photos or just data or whatever.\n\nHere is a simplified way of looking at it:\nThe first session has the directory structure burned at some tracks.  The\nsecond session has a newer directory structure, but the first directory still\nexists, because you cannot change, only add.  So if you put that in a 'normal'\ndrive and it will only look to the first directory and think it has found all\ndata.  Multisession kindof means that the drive will look for the last\ndirectory written to the disc, older systems look only for 'the' directory, not\ntaking multiple directories into account.

Well folks, after some thought the answer struck me flat in the face:\n\n"Why would Apple release a Duo Dock with a processor of its own?"\n\nHere's why- People have hounded Apple for a notebook with a 68040 processor\nin it. Apple can't deliver that right now because the 040 saps too much\npower, radiates far too much heat, and is too large for a notebook. How\ndoes one get around that without designing a new chipset? Use existing\nPowerBook technology to your best advantage. The Duo Dock gives Apple a\nunique ability to give users that 040 power in a "Semi-Portable" fashion.\nBy plunking the 040 into the Dock, you've got "quadra" power at your desk.\nOn the road, that 33mhz 68030 should be able to handle most of your needs.\nOkay, not the BEST solution, but its an answer to a no-win situation. :-)\nSo, does this mean one will be able to use the PowerBook's processor in\nparallel to the dock's processor? Okay, we're getting REALLY hypothetical\nnow...
Well Bill, There are 2MB soldered on the logic board and 2MB in the RAM\nexpansion slot giving you 4MB. The only thing you can do to upgrade to\nthe maximum Ram is to remove the 2MB expansion and install a 6MB expansion,\ngiving you a total of 8MB which is the max on a 170....You can try calling\nTechWorks, or any other memory vendors out of MacWeek, MacWorld...etc....

I have a Radius Precision Color 24x video card for the Mac that fits in a \nNuBus slot.  The card has 3 Mb of VRAM on it, which means that 24-bit color \nis possible on the card!  The card supports just about any monitor scan\nrate you can think of (I used it at 640x480, 800x600 and 1024x768, but it\ncan go higher).  You can switch resolutions and depth on the fly with a\nsoftware control panel.\n\n  This is the ACCELERATED version of the card, which means all QuickDraw \ncalls are not executed by the CPU but taken over by the video card, freeing\nup the mac processor for other tasks. \n\n  The cheapest I could find this card for when I called around last night\nwas $1738 at Mac's Place.  I will sell it for $1250 + shipping.  It is just\nover a year old and never been any problem.  It comes with software and the\noriginal manuals.\n\n  Hurry!
If you get the Centris 650 with CD configuration, you are getting a Mac with\na 68RC040 processor that has built-in math coprocessor support.  My \nunderstanding is that the "optional fpu" refers to your option of purchasing\nthe Centris 650 4/80 without FPU OR one of the other configurations WITH FPU.\n\nApple does not offer an upgrade from the non-FPU system to become an FPU\nsystem.  And, it is unclear whether the '040 processor on the non-FPU system\n(a 68LC040) can be replaced with a 68RC040 supplied by another vendor.\nApple did send a memo out at one point sating that the Centris 610, which ONLY\ncomes with a non-FPU 68LC040 processor CANNOT be upgraded to support an FPU -\nthe pin configurations of the two chips apparently do not match so you cannot\nswap one for another (again, according to Apple's memo).\n\nHope that helps.
Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzt!! Sorry -- wrong. It would be an\nextremely hot idea...at least with the current Alphas. The available\nAlphas run up to 200 MHz. But they produce quite a bit of heat.

Ok.  I have a record that shows a IIsi with and without a 64KB cache.\nIt's small enough that I will attach it.\n\nI have also measured some real programs with and without the 64 KB\ncache.  The speedup varies a lot from app to app, ranging from 0% to\n40%.  I think an average of 20%-25% is about right.  The subjective\ndifference is not great, but is sometimes noticable.  A simple cache\ncard certainly does not transform a IIsi into something enormously\nbetter.  I do not have an FPU.\n\nThe conventional wisdom says that cache cards from all of the makers\noffer about the same speedup and that there is not much difference\nbetween 32K and 64K caches.

This can be caused by two one of two things.  The first and easiest to fix is\ninterference from something around the monitor, such as another monitor or\nother electrical device.  Try moving the system to another location to fix\nthat problem.\n\nSecond, because of the scan rate of the monitor, it tends to synchronize with\nroom lights and can cause the interference you are seeing.  Try turning off\nall lights in the room(s) around the system and see if that helps.  If not,\ntry moving the system somewhere else.\n\nA third solution would be to get a 14" Apple Color Display - It should not\nhave the same problem the 12" Color is more suceptible to.\n\nYou can try calling Apple's new support number (in the U.S.) at 1-800-SOS-APPLE.\nThis number is for ANYONE who has questions regarding Macintosh setup and\ncompatibility and just went into effect for this extended support on Monday,\nApril 5, 1993.\n\nGood luck -
Does anyone work with the A/ROSE card?\n\nWe have the problem that after certain crashes the card disappears from the\nsystem, and lets crash the Mac then.\n\nOkay, we don't use the card quite like one should, because we simulate\nerrors in the 68000. Before every instruction some specified registers are\nmasked, eg. to simulate a stuck-at-1-error in certain bits.\n\nNormally, the "crash instance" of A/ROSE notices a crash, sets a flag and\nstops working. By reading the mentioned flag the Mac can notice a card\ncrash. That works fine for almost all crashes, but as said, sometimes the\ncard doesn't set the flag and disappears from the system.\n\nThe documentation of A/ROSE does not tell us anything about its behavior\nwhen crashing, and so at the moment we are trying to understand by analyzing\nthe assembler code, and that's both frustrating and lengthy.\n\nSo, can anyone help?\nPlease only reply via email, as I don't read this group.\n-- \n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     _                   Department of Computer Science IV\n    / \     |\/|         University of Dortmund, Germany\n    \_/laf  |  |aennig   e-mail: maennig@veronica.informatik.uni-dortmund.de\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n "In the beginning God created Adam ... ahem! ... atoms.

I think you meant Quadra 800 ..... (but a Centris 800 probably\nwould be a real nice machine... :)  )\n\nBut yeah, it needs 80ns not 60ns.\n\nJoel
Hi.  I think I have a problem with the stereo sound output on my Quadra\n900, but I am not totally sure because my roomate has the same problem\non his PowerBook 170.  Any info or experience anyopne has would be\ngreatly appreciated.\n\nWhen I hook my Quadra up to my home stereo system, the following types\nof sounds (mono, as far as I can tell) all play fine through BOTH\nspeakers:\n\nsystem beeps  (already provided ones such as Indigo and ones I record)\n\nArmor Alley\nSpectre\nSpaceward Ho!\n\n\nBut, the following games only play out of the left channel:\n\nLemmings\nOut of This World  (awesome game, BTW)\nGlider 4.0\nOIDS\n\n\nBut still, STEREO system beeps do play in stereo, through BOTH speakers.\n(The one I'm specifically referrring to is Apocolyptic Beginning, which\nmy roommate downloaded from some ftp site (sumex?))\n\n\nAll of the symptoms are the same on my rommates 170 (he can't run\nOOTW because he doesn't have color).\n\nWe're both running system 7.1\n\n\n\nDoes anyone with Lemmings or the other three games I mentioned above get\nsound out of both speakers on a Mac II class, Quadra, LC, PowerBook 140 or\ngreater, Centris, SE/30, etc... (stereo) machine?\n\nI used to have a Mac II, and I sort of rememeber Lemmings playing in\nstereo on that machine, not just on the left channel.  (I could be\nmistaken, though.  If there were a problem with the Quad 900's and PB\n170's, I am wondering why the system beeps still play in stereo?  If there\nisn't a problem with our machines, I wonder why the 4 games above are\napparantly written to support only one channel of stereo when they\ncould just use mono sounds so the mono sound would at least come out of\nboth speakers  (like Spectre, etc. do)?\n\nQuadra 900's and PowerBook 170's have the same ROMS (to my knowledge),\nso maybe this is a ROM problem?  (if so, though, why wouldn't System 7.1\npatch over this problem?)\n\n\n\n\nThanks for any help you can provide!
All I know is that the Megadrives worked perfectly on both my\nMac Plus and my Powerbook 140.  It was for this reason I assumed\nthe problem had something to do with the Quadra.  Even with the\nQuadra, they mostly worked OK.  The problem occurred when I ejected\na cartridge from a drive: it would start popping up dialog boxes\nsaying "This cartridge must be formatted with Jasmine Driveware"\neven though there was no cartridge in the drive.
Hmm, I don't know where this information concerning the cable and the\nwarranty came from but I ordered mine from Logos Communications, near\nCleveland, and inside was a Mac cable (with the correct pin connections :-))\nand a lifetime warranty.  The whole package was assembled at AT&T Paradyne,\nand every piece (the serial cable, the telephone cable, etc.) had AT&T \npart numbers on them, except the QuickLink software package and the \nCompuServe intro kit.\n\n\nIf anyone's interested, Logos number is (800) 837-7777.  I ordered mine\nlast Wednesday and got my modem on Friday, though it's not to far from\nCleveland to Pittsburgh.. :-)  On the down side they only ship UPS COD.\n\n\n					- Chris
Is it possible, ie via creative cable splicing or whatever, to\nhook a Syquest 44MB removable drive to a Mac?\n\nIs there any difference with the guts of the drive or is it\njust cable differences?\n\nThanks.\n\nRob
Applied Engineering makes a NuBus card called the QuadraLink which is \na board that contains 4 serial ports, which I believe can be used\nsimultaneously.  I'm not a user of one of these, but I have installed\na couple for people at work (I'm a technician).  Hope this helps.

What is hardware handshaking and when do I want to use it? Dan
Excuse me if this is a frequent question, I checked in\nseveral FAQs but couldn't really find anything.\n\nI have a IIsi with the standard 5 meg memory and I want\n(need) to add additional memory.  But I'm on a budget.\nI really don't need more than 10 meg max, so what is\nthe best (performance wise) and most economical way\nto do this?  Someone told me that I should only use\nSIMMs of the same amount of memory, that is 4 1 meg,\n4 2 meg, etc.  What if I just wanted to buy just 1 4 meg\nand use the rest of what I already have?  The manual\nhasn't been very helpful with this.\n\nThanks.
I recently purchased a Centris 610 and am having difficulty getting\nmy computer to recognize my hard disk drive (external) Using both the\ndisk uitily of TMS (Diskwriter) and Jasmine's software, neither one\nwill show the drive.  The drive is the only device connected to the \nscuzzi port. I cant find the manual to the tms pro 120 and seem to\nremember that it is "terminated".  Is there something else that I am\ndoing (or not doing) that does not allow my 610 to recognize my external\ndisk drive?.\n\nthanks in advance for the information.
How many NuBus slots do you have?\n\nApplied Engineering has something called the QuadraLink, which is\na card with 4 serial ports that you get at through the comms\ntoolbox (in addition to the built-in ones) It also comes with\nsoftware for fooling applications to open an AE port when they\nthink they open a built-in port.\n\nThey also have a more expensive card with DMA (better performance)\nand I _think_ they, or someone else, have a card that handles\n8 ports simultaneously.\n\nAs I said, with NuBus, you're green. Learn how to use the Comms\nResource Manager to get at the various installed cards.\n\nCheers,\n\n					/ h+
...\n\n\nMac sound hardware is diverse; some macs play in stereo and\nmix the output (the SE/30 for instance) while others play in\nstereo but ONLY has the left channel for the speaker, while\nsome are "truly" mono (like the LC)\n\nDevelopers know that stuff played in the left channel is\nguaranteed to be heard, while the right channel isn't. Some\nsend data to both, some only send data to the left channel\n(the first is preferrable, of course)\n\nCheers,\n\n					/ h+

I think the original poster meant opening the mouse, not just\nreleasing the ball and getting to the rollers. I found that on the\noriginal ADB mouse, sometimes unscrewing the two halves allowed for\neasier cleaning.\n\nIf the original poster has his answer, I'll ask: How do you open the\nnew ergonomic mouse? By open, I mean split the two halves to get at\nthe guts. It isn't obvious to me based on the 5 minute look I spent\nwith one at the office yesterday as there are no visible screw\nheads.

I currently use an HP DeskJet with Grappler LS ver 1.0, \nand it works on System7.  Course, I only use the SWA Dutch\nand SWA Swiss fonts that came with it, due to the 4x size\nrequirement to print to the HP. (ie: must have 40pnt definition\nto print a 10pnt font)  When I upgraded,  I talked to Orange\nMicro, and they state that ver 1.2 of Grappler LS definitely\nworks with System7.  However, the upgrade was US$40, so I\npassed.\n\nHope this helps?\n\n<marc>\n\n--

1)    I have an old Jasmine drive which I cannot use with my new system.\n My understanding is that I have to upsate the driver with a more modern\none in order to gain compatability with system 7.0.1.  does anyone know\nof an inexpensive program to do this?

So, will it be possible to have a NuBus or PDS PowerPC upgrade, or will it \nrequire a logic board swap? It would be interesting for Apple to come out with\na NuBus PowerPC that allowed use of the CPU's 680x0, like RocketShare. But I \nguess that's getting a bit fantastic!\n\nI was wondering, since MacWeek reported that developers were 'seeded' with\nPowerPCs on a NuBus card.\n\nAlso, any word on machine arrivals or estimated speed? Last I heard, the \nestimates were around 3-4 times the speed of a Quadra in native RISC mode. I\nheard an Apple employee mumble something about the arrival of PowerPC machines\nat a much earlier date that Q1 94, but I doubt it's true.\n\nFinally, is the PowerPC developer's CD 'mini-course' available? I saw it \nadvertised in the developer's university calendar, and I'd like to know if it's\nat all *interesting*.\n\nSean
You're not going to like this, but if memory serves me, postings\nI've read in this newsgroup and elsewhere indicate that there are\nno, repeat no, internal modems for the Duo besides the Express\nModem... at _any_ speed.  Something having to do with the modem\nusing the main CPU for some of its tasks, and Apple not releasing\ndetails on the architecture, or something.  I'm vague on the\ndetails, but the gist was that there are going to be no\nthird-party internal Duo modems.  If I'm wrong, somebody please\ncorrect me on this.  Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.\n\nJoel
1.  Why, or how actually, can a Powerbook have a 640 x 400 pixel\n    display, regardless if it is a 9" or 10", and still keep the\n    72 dpi resolution?  (I assume that it doesn't, and I don't \n    mean to imply they *all* have these dimensions)\n\n\n2.  Any info on price drops or new models (non-Duo) coming up?
I don't know how to say it best but you are gaurenteed that the\nprice of the C650 is going to drop this year.  This week's MacWeek\nreports that Apple is probably planning a drop in August.  My guess\nis that it may come sooner if Apple decides to  change the price\nstructure upon release of the multimedia units this summer.\n\nYour price looks pretty good at about $50 more then I payed for\nmine last month.  I would have rather waited for one of the new\nmachines this sommer (like the Cyclone) but the resale value of my\nIIci would have not been squat by then.  Thus, financing forced me\nto purchase now.  I'm happy with the machine and won't feel\nbetrayed at all when Apple cuts the price to less then $1000 next\nweek (heh).\n\nBottome line:  If the C650 does what you want, buy it.  If you wait\nuntil the Cylcones come out for a price break then you might as\nwell wait for the PowerPCs to come out for another price break and\nthen the units which follow them.  You may save some money but\nyou've lost a lot of time when you could have been using the\ncomputer.  Face it, Apple's prices are going to be in a continuous\nstate of flux.  At least they aren't going to try raising them\nagain (grin).
The little blue roller on the trackball interior is probably rubbing\nagainst its support, just push it down the pin so that it no longer\ntouches it.  I had a similar problem.
Ah, but why?  Can some technically-hip Macslinger tell us what the\ndifference is between PDS and Nubus?  \n\nIs it impossible to make a gadget that plugs into PDS and ends in a\nNubus card cage?

I'm in the market for a laser printer. Used printers are fine, non-apple\nprinters are fine, but whatever printer I get must fit the following:\n\nRequired features:\n\n- PostScript\n\n- 300 dpi\n\n- emough memory to download fonts\n\n- The cheaper, the better.  I'd prefer under $1000.\n\n\nNice things:\n\n- anything over 4 pages per minute\n\n- scsi output for a font disk\n\n- smallish footprint\n\n\n\nDon't Care About:\n\n- PostScript Level II\n\n- networking (its just for me, and always will be)\n\n- color\n\n\nI know about Freedom of Press, but I've also heard that its painfully slow.\nI can tolerate about 4 ppm, but anything slower than that and I'm not going\nto consider the price savings worth it.  I'd be curious to hear people's\nexperience with it, tho. \n\nI also infinitely prefer laser over ink; I used to use HP deskjets in\nmy last job and wasn't impressed with the quality.  I'm a laser bigot\nand the first to admit it. :)\n\n\nI'll be using the printer to layout pages of a book I'm writing.  The\npage will include multiple fonts, PS graphics, scanned line art and\nmaybe greyscale pictures (not sure yet).  The quality doesn't need to\nbe spectacular, but it needs to be clear and readable.\n\n\nPrinters I've been looking at:\n\n\n- used LaserWriters: The plus, the NT, the NTR.  Its my understanding that\n  only the NTR has a SCSI out for a disk. True?\n\n- Personal LaserWriter (LS and NTR).  I have access to the Apple Employee\n  discount (I work for one of Apple's spinoffs), so I can get these reasonably\n  cheaply.  I've heard bad things about the LS; comments?  I'm leaning\n  towards the Personal NTR, cause it has a nice small footprint.\n\n- LaserWriter Select 300.  I hear it doesn't have PostScript, but I haven't\n  seen anything for sure.  I heard mumbles once about a "postscript upgrade."\n  ??\n\n- Used HP LaserJets.  I've worked with the II and IIP on another platform, and\n  they were *painfully* slow.  Are they that bad on the mac?\n\n- I've seen ads for an Epson PS laserprinter that is running quite cheap.\n  Any comments on this printer?  I hate the styling (too many ouput trays),\n  but if its a decent printer I'll consider it.\n\n\nThanks for any comments...

I just bought a select 300 and rushed home to print \nsome grayscale pictures for my kids, when I discovered that\ngrayscale(and photograde) are not available if you are\nusing an SE...even if you are running with an '030 cpu.\nYou won't see this in the printer's docs, and the Apple\nrep didn't mention it to our users group either. It seems\nthat SE ROMs won't support those "features". Okay, I \nguess I should have somehow known that this was the case.\nLet the buyer beware, huh Apple?\n	Be that as it may, I have been thinking about the \nproblem and I'm puzzled. Why  can't a defencieny in the \nROM be made up for in software. I write software for a living\n(on unix platforms) and I don't understand the "it just\ncan't be done" responses I've gotten from those I have\nasked so far.  Isn't Mode32, or somesuch piece of  soft-\nware, just such a fix. \n	Anyway, I was hoping someone knowledgeable\nabout Mac internals could set me straight: is it simply\nimpossible for a mac SE to print grayscale, or could\nsomeone armed with enough info and a little pro-\ngramming experience cook something up that would\nsupplement the ROM's capabilities?\n	Also, how does one know if one's mac can\nsupport the grayscale and photograde that the Select 300\nis supposedly capable of? ( Short of buying the printer\nand trying it out like I did)\n	Thanks for your help.
It would depend on the requirements of the poster's data, for some\npurposes 1/256 resolution (with or without calibration curve).\n\n\nOtherwise the other possibilities would be:\n\n1) get a digital voltameter with serial output & connect to serial\nport on mac, collect data with some communications program.\n\n2) Buy an A/D chip from Analog devices, Burr-Brown, etc, connect to\na parallel to serial converter, use serial port for acquisition\n(nah. too much soldering and trouble shooting :-)\n\n3) Get a board from National Instruments, Data Translation, Omega,\netal.  The finest solution, but possibly the most costly.\n\n\n\nTo the original poster:  if the signal is too large, why not\nuse a voltage divider? Two resistors, cost very cheap...\n--
What I did NOT get with my drive (CD300i) is the System Install CD you\nlisted as #1.  Any ideas about how I can get one?  I bought my IIvx 8/120\nfrom Direct Express in Chicago (no complaints at all -- good price & good\nservice).\n\nBTW, I've heard that the System Install CD can be used to boot the mac;\nhowever, my drive will NOT accept a CD caddy is the machine is off.

I don't know about the specific problem mentioned in your\nmessage, but I definitely had SCSI problems between my\nQ700 and my venerable Jasmine Megadrive 10 cartridge\ndrives.  My solution was to get Silverlining.  None of\nthe loops that involved blind writes worked to the drives;\nin fact the only loop that worked was the "Macintosh\nSoftware" loop (whatever that means).
Well, here are the results of the Mathematica test which I posted to\nthis newsgroup.  The "test" was the following command:\n\n\n\nI was just curious how fast the plot command would be executed on\nvarious Macintosh machines as well as other personal computers and\nworkstations.  The results are posted below:\n\nMachine		System		Math vers.	# of trials	time, min\n\nPB 170		7.0.0 with	2.1		2		2:08\n		tuneup/8MB\n		RAM/5MB for\n		Mathematica\n\nDEC 5000	Ultrix v4.2a	2.1 for		1		0:25\n		DEC RISC	\n					\nIIsi		7.1/cache@96MB	1.2f33Enh.	1		4:30\n		25MHz/5MB RAM/\n		3MB for Math./\n		w/ 68882\n\nC650		7.1/8MB RAM			2		0:32\n\nQ800		8MB/Cache@384/	1.2				1:01\n		4MB for Math.	\n\nSparc		SunOS4.1.3					0:14\nStation		40MB RAM\n\nSGI Iris/4D	R3000 RISC					<0:01\n		processor\n		version\n\nSparc		SunOS4.1.2	2.1 				0:26\nStation2\n\nIIsi		7.1						3:15\n\nNeXT		NeXTSTEP 2.1	1.2				2:38\nCube		68030 based/\n		w/ coprocessor	\n\nNeXT		NeXTSTEP 3.0	1.2		5(ave)		0:52\nCube		68040/25MHz/\n		20 MB RAM\n\nIIsi		17MB/8MB for	2.102 Enha			3:15\n		Math.			\n		w/ 68882\n\nNeXT		16MB RAM/			1 		0:37\n		25 MHz 040/\n		Workspace\n		Manager 2.1\n\nFunny how the IIsi running at 25 MHz is slower than other equivalent\nmachines, lots slower in fact.  Perhaps the version of Mathematica\nmakes a difference or the fact that not much RAM was allocated.\nAnother interesting thing is how fast the SGI did it.  Wow. \n\nBasically, though, I wouldn't draw any conclusions from this data.  It\nseems that Mathematica's speed is dependant on a lot of variables.  I\nwas just curious how different machines would measure up.  \n\nWell, if you have any questions or if I forgot something, just drop me\na line at "cmmiller@iastate.edu".  \n\nChad
In the MacUser article on the new centris and quadra machines mentioned\nthat the C650 and the Q800, and not the C610, had ROM accelerated video.\n\nIt didn't seem to make much difference in their "benchmark" test.\n\nWhat is it?  I don't recall seeing it in Dale Adams post.\n\n-Erik Speckman
terminated\n\nIt is very possible to connect another internal hard disk in any\nmacintosh if you can find the space to put it. I have a IIsi that came\nwith a Quantum 80 meg drive. When I ran into space problems, I slapped in\nanother 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf. Here is what I did.\n \nFirst off, I was concerned about space. Since both drives are Quantum\nquarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for them\nwas stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had a\nproblem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together for\nover two months.\n\nThe next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internal\nhard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. just\nsplice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard\nconnector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don't have a spare\ncable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found\nin any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properly\nsoldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of\nshorts or bad connections.\n\nNext, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard disk\nribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn't word so what\nI did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another\nmale connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again,\nand is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using a\ncrimp on connector is that if this doesn't work, my original cable is not\ndamaged, and I can go back to the original setup.\n\nHaving done all that, I couldn't be bothered to check the dev notes for\npower consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this\nday. \n\nIn a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID's of\nthe drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are\nintact. I did not try this without the terminating resistors but it\nseemed logical that if I am splitting the SCSI chain, that the signal\nshould be terminated at all the ends.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions.
well folks, my mac plus finally gave up the ghost this weekend after\nstarting life as a 512k way back in 1985.  sooo, i'm in the market for a\nnew machine a bit sooner than i intended to be...\n\ni'm looking into picking up a powerbook 160 or maybe 180 and have a bunch\nof questions that (hopefully) somebody can answer:\n\n* does anybody know any dirt on when the next round of powerbook\nintroductions are expected?  i'd heard the 185c was supposed to make an\nappearence "this summer" but haven't heard anymore on it - and since i\ndon't have access to macleak, i was wondering if anybody out there had\nmore info...\n\n* has anybody heard rumors about price drops to the powerbook line like the\nones the duo's just went through recently?\n\n* what's the impression of the display on the 180?  i could probably swing\na 180 if i got the 80Mb disk rather than the 120, but i don't really have\na feel for how much "better" the display is (yea, it looks great in the\nstore, but is that all "wow" or is it really that good?).  could i solicit\nsome opinions of people who use the 160 and 180 day-to-day on if its worth\ntaking the disk size and money hit to get the active display?  (i realize\nthis is a real subjective question, but i've only played around with the\nmachines in a computer store breifly and figured the opinions of somebody\nwho actually uses the machine daily might prove helpful).\n\n* how well does hellcats perform?  ;)\n\nthanks a bunch in advance for any info - if you could email, i'll post a\nsummary (news reading time is at a premium with finals just around the\ncorner... :( )\n--\nTom Willis  \  twillis@ecn.purdue.edu    \    Purdue Electrical Engineering

Apple has patented their implementation of regions, which presumably\nincludes the internal data structure (which has never been officially\ndocumented by Apple).  Apple cannot patent the concept of a region.\n\nI'm guessing that either NuTek reverse-engineered Apple's internal data\nstructure for regions (I dunno if this would hold up in court), or they\ncame up with their own data structure.  If it's the latter, then they\nwon't be able to draw PICT files containing regions.  Besides PICT files,\nthere aren't many places where regions are stored on disk.  (QuickTime\nmovies, perhaps?)  As long as the region isn't being stored on disk and\ntransferred from a Mac to a NuTek clone (or vice versa), it doesn't\nmatter if NuTek uses a completely different internal data structure.\n\nI remember reading that Apple also has a patent on their ADB hardware,\nand that the NuTek clones would therefore be lacking an ADB port.  What\nother patents does Apple have on the Mac?

The Quadralink by AE is a possibly problematical solution to your needs.\nI've used one for the last 4 (?) years on my personal system, but a fatal\nbug has crept into their more recent s/w.

Yes, it is possible to add a second hard drive to a mac IIcx internally. This\nis definitely not a recommended procedure by Apple but I have done the equivalent to my CX after upgrading it to a Quadra 700. The power supply is still the\nstock CX's and it was able to power two Quantum LPS drives, a PLI SCSI \naccelerator, a Micron technologies 24 bit video board, Daystar QuickCache,\nNew Technologies Overdrive and 20 meg of RAM simultaneously.\n\nI added a new mount for the drive by attaching angle brackets to the drive\ntower. The internal SCSI cable was changed to a longer flat ribbon cable onto\nwhich I added an extra connector about midway. The final HD was internally\nterminated and the drive between the motherboard and final HD had its terminator resistor packs removed. Cooling has not been a problem and no SCSI problems\noccur with either the PLI SCSI chain or motherboard SCSI hooked into the two\ninternal hard drives.
Sure. I can give is a shot...\n\n\n    You need to get the 30-pin simms.\n\n\n    If you mean in a "newer, more powerful" Mac system then the answer\nis no. Apple has stated that all new Macs will use the 72-pin SIMMs and\nno longer use the 30-pin SIMMs.
The PowerBook 170 hardware doesn't have a wakeup timer.  Nor does the 140.\nThe Mac Portable had one, and I think the PowerBook 100 had one.

I think this is mostly the fault of the people who write up the\nliterature and price lists being confused themselves. Since there are\ntwo possible processor configurations and one of the them doesn't have\nan FPU it does seem to be an option, even though it really isn't.\n\n\n    Well, then allow me to end your confusion. The C650 ONLY come with\nan LC040 in the base 4/80 configuration. If you are not getting this\nconfiguration then you are getting an FPU.\n\n\n    Good question. I have been wondering that since Feb. 10th.\n\n \n    This is possible, but an option is something that you are supposed\nto be able to request when you want it. What Apple has done is given the\nbuyer a CHOICE between configurations and not an OPTION.\n\n\n    This is not unclear at all. In fact Apple has included in the ROMs\nof those machines with LC040s code to recognize the presence of the full\n040's FPU and use it. Thereby making the upgrade as easy as switching\nchips. You pop the LC040 out and pop in a full '040.\n\n\n    They did? I think I would double-check this. It has been stated\ncountless times in this newsgroup by two of the Centris hardware\ndesigners that the LC040 and the full '040 are pin compatible and that\nthe C610 can be upgraded to a full '040.

Dear Mac-friends,\n\nI've seen the following problem om three Mac IIsi machines\nall with 17 Mb RAM installed (70 or 80 ns SIMMs).\n\nIf the contents of a window are being calculated and updated\na lot of strange horizontal lines are temporarily generated\non the screen.  The lines translate to the top of the screen and\nhave a slightly lower brightness than their surroundings (they\nare a few millimeters apart).\nI admit that they are vague, but they can still be distinguished clearly,\nespecially if the environment (i.e. the rest of the room) is a bit dark.\nApplications which produce this effect are:\n- the previewer of DirectTeX 1.2 (i.e. DVIReader 1.2)\n- Kaleidagraph 2.1.1/FPU\n\nThe machines use their built-in video and drive the old \nApple Hires Monochrome screen (two monitors/cable sets tried).  \nThe effect is independent of the settings in the following control \npanels: Memory (adressing mode, disk cache) \n        and Monitors (nr of greys/colors).\n\nHave you ever seen this effect too ?   Is there a solution ?\n\nThanks,\nFred
or\nthere\n\n\nOkay, I guess its time for a quick explanation of Mac sound.\n\nThe original documentation for the sound hardware (IM-3) documents how to\nmake sound by directly accessing hardware.  Basically, you jam values\ninto all the even bytes from SoundBase to SoundBase+0x170. This was\nbecause\nof how the Mac 128 (and some later machines) generated sound was by\nscanning\nthis block and D/Aing every even byte (the odd bytes went to the floppy on\nsome machines).\n\nWhen the Mac II (and Apple Sound Chip) was invented, it was designed to\ngenerate stereo sound. It was also designed to be compatible with we had\nonce\ndocumented. So storing bytes at the even values at SoundBase meant "I\nwant to\nplay a mono sound" and so it was emulated. But Apple had since retracted\nthe\ndocumentation on SoundBase and decided not to document the lowest layers\nof\nsound generation. So apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you\nwant\nto make stereo sound.\n\nEnter game developers. The sound driver and current sound manager are\ninconveniently lame for making games. Furthermore, people who port from\nthe\nIBM don't want to learn more APIs. So, it has become popular for game\nwriters to write to SoundBase to make sound, since it is very easy.\n\nSince the Mac II, Apple has had many different kind of sound output\nhardware,\nand the only things they have in common are that writing to SoundBase\nworks.\nOn some hardware, (Mac II, IIx, IIcx, IIci at least), writing to SoundBase\ngets you mono sound through both speakers. On some Macs (Quadra\n700/900/950\nat least) writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound on the left channel\nonly.\nBoth are technically correct interpretations of the original\nspecification,\nbut one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons.\n\nIf developers use the Sound Manager (and I think the sound driver), mono\nsounds will (typically) come out through both channels regardless of the\nunderlying hardware. It is possible to specify you want to generate left\nchannel only, but no one does. If developers write to sound base, their\ngames will only come out the left on some games.\n\nThe other problem, the original Mac II only producing left channel sound\non the internal speaker, while the SE/30 mixes both, isn't really related.\nIt is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of\nthe different machines. It only affects true stereo sounds. Sounds which\nare actually mono, will play on the internal speaker, no matter what\nmachine\nyou have.\n\nNow, to more directly address the question, the games you list:\nand also\nHellcats,\nSuper Tetris\nOxyd\n(and many more, these are just what I've tested)\n\nCheat and write to SoundBase and so are only left channel on Quadras.\n\n\nOther games you list:\nand also\nPGA Tour Golf\nCivilization\n(and more, these are again only from personal experience)\n\nUse the sound manager and work fine on all machines.\n\nThe more of the story is to developers: DON'T CHEAT!\nReally, I am absolutely, positively not allowed to do what I am about to\ndo,\nbut I'm going say it anyway.\nStop cheating on sound!\nReally soon, you will be sorry, as even those without external speakers\nwill be disappointed with your sound on future hardware. The grace period\nis about to end.\nThe Sound Manager is understandable now, and works pretty well and will\nwork\neven better soon, so use it.\n\nIn conclusion:\nTo Doug, it isn't a hardware problem, at least, not a bug.\nTo Jon, it isn't a choice to developers as to whether they want to send\nsound\nto both channels. If they do it the right way, it is taken care of\nautomatically. If you cheat, there is not way to make it work on all\nhardware.\n\n\nHave fun.\n\nDisclaimer number 1:\nI don't work on sound here at Apple, I'm just pretty well informed.\nSo don't write me with sound questions.\n\nDisclaimer number 2:\nIf it says up above that I wrote anything like "the grace period is about\nto end" then it is a bug in your news feed, since I am catagorically not\nallowed to say anything like that. You know what I mean.\n\nDisclaimer number 3:\nI don't speak for Apple, just me.

Apple has really confused people with this whole thing. I think\nwe'll be answering this question for about the next year or so. There is\nno "option" to get an FPU on a C650. What you have is a choice of CPUs:\nthere is the 68LC040 that does not have an integrated FPU like the full\n'040 and is only present in the base 4/80 model of the C650 (AppleUSA).\nAnd there is the full '040 which you get when you order anything other\nthan the base 4/80 configuration. Therefore, since you have ordered one\nof the 8MB versions with on-board Ethernet models you will not be\ngetting the LC040. But even if you wanted to have the LC040 you wouldn't\nbe able to order a C650 with 8MB RAM, on-board Ethernet and an LC040.\nIt's not an "option."\n    Also, a note to people out there that have 4/80 C650s and C610s\nthinking that there is an optional FPU, the '040 class chip cannot\nrecognize an external FPU, so there is no socket on the motherboard for\na FPU chip and you cannot go out and purchase an FPU on a PDS card or\nsomething like that. The only way to get an FPU in these machines is to\nreplace the LC040 with a full '040. And if you have a C610, you will not\nneed to worry about a heat sink if you do replace the LC040 with the\nfull '040, but if you have a 4/80 C650 you do need to have a heat sink.

Hi all:\nThanks to you all who have responded\nto my request for info on various kinds of fax modem.\nI'd like to ask a few more questions.\n1.  What are the advantages of buying a global village\nTeleport Gold over other cheaper brands like Supra, Zoom etc?\n2.  I heard that both Supra and Zoom use the same software.\nWhy are there so many complaints about the incompatibility problems\nof Supra?  What kind of incompatibility is it?\n3.  If I decided to buy the Teleport Gold, is there any\npossibility to add a voice option in the near future?\n4.  Has anyone heard of a possible voice option that Supra will offer\nthis coming summer?\n5.  A person did mention a new AT&T modem.  Is it\ngetting good reviews from various Mac Magazines?\n6.  If I want the best, fastest, most economically sound and\npossible voice option, what fax modem should I buy?\n\nSorry for posting so many questions, but I think they're necessary.\nI promise to repost any answers if they're not already posted by a responder.\n\nThanks so much in advance.\n\nRegards,

For the most part, this is a bunch of bunk.  I've got a Computer Engineering\ndegree, yet I've spent the last 7 years writing software that people actually\nuse.  Moreover, the salary distinctions are incorrect; I received 3 job offers\nupon graduation; the two jobs that actually used my hardware experience were\n$7000/year lower!  My advice is to decide which classes and projects most\ninterest you, and pick the major that allows you to take them.

I've just completed a successful upgrade of a an SI to 27.5 mhz. I'm waiting\non delivery of a 62 mhz clock for a final speed trial. Definitely needed the\nheatsink. The CPU was quite hot to the touch at higher speeds until I glued\non a 90 cent Radio Shack sink. \n\nI made a call for reports of failures last week. No reports have arrived\nhere. Locally, in Seattle there is a reported CPU damage due to the user\nslipping with the iron and putting a gash into the board -- not exactly\na problem due to the CPU running too fast.\n\nI think it would be nice to have a poll to report top speeds and system\nconfigurations including PDS and Nubus cards which were used. I'd be happy\nto coordinate and report results
To boorishly reply to myself, I found I did have the Instrutech information\nalready. The specs (to use the term loosely) are as follows:\n\nA/D: 16 bit converter, with 14 bit accuracy to 100 kHz, 12 bit accuracy to\n200 kHz. No specs for S/N, monotonicity, linearity. There are 8 multiplexed\ninputs sharing the single A/D, so that all inputs are not samples at the\nsame time, and in the above conversion specs the all-channel sample rate\nmust be used. Thus, for two channels, you only have 14 unknown quality bits\nat 50 kHz per channel. This is poorer quality than the national\nInstruments, at the same sample rate.\n\nD/A: 16 bit converter. No specs for S/N, monotonicity, linearity. Each of\nthe 4 output channels has its own converter.

Well here is my $0.02 worth.  Advice from a grad student.\n\n	I agree with the gentlemen who wrote the comment before me.\nThe important thing is pick what ever interest you the most and \nlearn as much as possible about it.  \n\n	In my five years of education in this field, though brief \ncompare to alot of people, I had to think about this kind of \nquestion a lot.  Did I make the right decision in going into\nElectrical Engineering as opposed to Computer engineering or\nCS?  The more I go thru school, the more I believe that this\nkind of question is irrelevant.  \n \n	I have come to believe that choosing CS because one \ndoes not like hardware or choosing hardware because one does\nnot like to program is really doing an injustice of building\nand computer and making it useful for something.  Everything\nis interwoven and inseparable.  CS, CE, and EE are all a \npart of a really great discipline and do depend on each other.\n\n	My advice is don't limit yourself, but make a decision\nbased on which major will give you the best opportunities to \nlearn.  That of course depends on the curriculum at your \npersective school.  I would choose a major that allows me to\nexplore as much as possible.  Beside, I don't know why the\nschool would make a student choose a major before her/his\nsophamore year.                  \n\n	Hey you may be so interested in this field that you \ndecided to learn all about the making of computers in which \ncase, you suffer a little more and go to grad school.\n\n	About the money.  Don't look at the averages, if you\nare good, you are going to earn more money than anyone else. \nIf you are a superstar programmer, you will earn millions.  \nLike wise if you are a hotshot computer designers.
Yes, E-Machines makes two mini-docks--the Powerlink Presente and the\nPowerLink DeskNet. The Presenter offers a variety of video-out options, \nincluding NTSC, RGB and SVGA. It also has sound out, floppy drive port\nand a power port. Unfortunately no SCSI port and it blocks the serial port.\n  The DeskNet has the standard ports plus built-in EtherNet. Alas, none of\nthese have an FPU.\n  In the future, RasterOps is putting out a mini-dock, but the name escapes\nme now. It is supposed to support 16-bit color and "Quadra" comparable\nvideo speed. No idea if it has an FPU.\n  Hope this helps...

Is that the low-end configuration?  If it is, it has the 68LC040 (no FPU), as  \nopposed to all the other configurations with a 68RC040 (has an FPU).

I have finally decided to update my SE :-)).\nI am planning on buying a Centris 610-8/230 CD.\nNow, what monitor should I get? Here are a few\nguidelines:\n	My wife uses PageMaker occasionally, I use Excel sometimes\n	and I do alot of Telecommuting from home to work. We both\n	do Word processing. Greater than 14 inches.\n\nI have looked at the Radius Color Pivot. This can be bought for\nunder $1000. I have heard good things about the E-Machines T-16,\nthe older model not the new T-16 II. How about the Super Mac 17T?\nThese both can be had for a little over $1000. Any others??
I had the same question for my 55lb NEC 5FG monitor. The Apple guy said that\ntheir 50lb 16" monitor is OK to put ontop of the Centris and had no coment\nbeyond that. I was going to just put the NEC on the box but then I got to \nthinking - the monitor has a small tilt/swivel base so maybe the weight\nwould be more concentrated than with Apple's (I don't know the area of the \nbase of their tilt/swivel). Additionally, the CDROM drive is in the middle.\nSo I cut a piece of 3/8" thick wood to about 16.25" x 12", covered it in a \ncream covered cloth, and used it as a buffer layer between the Centris's top\nand the monitor!!\n\nMick Mueck  mick.mueck@analog.com

This doesn't sound right to me.  Don't Quadras use the 53C96?  If so, the\nMac has nothing to do with the SCSI timing.  That's all handled by the\nchip.  About the only the timing could be wrong is if Apple programs the\nclock registers wrong on the 96.  That, however, should only really hurt\nsynchronous transfer, which is not used by the Mac SCSI Manager.\n\nFurthermore, disabling blind writes should be meaningless on a Quadra.\nOn Macs that used the 5380, which is a much lower level SCSI chip, the\nMac was responsible for the handshake of each byte transferred.  Blind\nmode affected how the Mac handled that handshake.  On the 5396, the\nhandshake is entirely handled by the chip.
An added advantate of waiting for the DayStar for the SE/30 is that,\njust as with the '030 power cache, the '040 accelerator will plug into\nthe CPU socket, leaving the PDS slot free for a video card or ethernet\ncard.  With DayStar's upgrade path, it's a no lose situation.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEarl D.

Forgive me if this has been asked before... but here goes:\n\nMy friend recently purchased a LC III and he wants to know if there is\nsuch a demon called NuBus adapter for his PDS slot? CompUsa and\nComputerCity Supercenter says they don't carry them.\n\nDoes this mean LC III is incapable of carrying a NuBus board?
You're correct, except that's Quadra 800 not Centris 800.
Excerpts from netnews.comp.sys.mac.misc: 5-Apr-93 Re: HELP INSTALL RAM\nON CEN.. by Jason Harvey Titus@farad \n\n\n\noh boy am i confused, I thought the entire point of the 72 pin simms was\nthat you could use diffrent size simms so you could avoid having to use\nsets.  all horror stories not withstanding.
When Apple came with their demos to Iowa State, I got a chance to run\nSpeedometer3.1 on some of the new Macs.  Both machines were running\nSystem7.1, had a 14" RGB.  Don't know what the caches were set to.\nNeither machine had an FPU  It appears that the Centris610 is quite a\nbit faster than the LC III:\n\n		Centris610		LCIII\n\nCPU		13.01			6.92\nGraf		15.67			7.69\nDisk		2.22			2.44\nMath		25.57			10.19\n\nP.R. Rating	12.91			6.58\n\nSo, there is a comparison.  There is definitely a very noticable speed\ndifference between these two machines according to Speedometer3.1.
..\n\n\n\nHmmm... Sounds vaguely similar to a problem I had a long time ago when I was  \ntrying to use Kermit.  I was building a serial connection between my Duo 210  \nand my NeXT.  I think the problem was in the handshaking.  Basically, you need  \nto make sure that the handshaking protocol is the same on both sides.  A safe  \nplace to start is by selecting NO handshaking on either end.  One problem is  \nthat the Zilog serial chip seems to get permanently wedged if you talk to it  \nwrong, and only a reset will clear it.  I don't know the specifics.  But this  \ncould be a nonlinearity that screws up your attempts at debugging the system.   \nIt could very well be that you are doing things right--eventually-- but one  \nwrong move (like trying a bad handshaking protocol) can screw up any further  \ncorrect actions, until the next machine reset.  I have wedged my Mac and also  \nmy NeXT that way.\n\nNow I can send files back and forth between the Duo and the NeXT without any  \nproblem, and at pretty high speeds too.\n\nI don't know what kind of chip the PC uses, but I think the Zilog 8530 is  \npretty standard.

Sounds about right.\n\nIf there is high demand for a product there is little incentive to\naggresively cut prices.

All present Macs support the use of \n32-bit color through 32-bit color QuickDraw in ROM.  32-bit color QuickDraw \nallows an almost transparent capability to display and edit X-bit images in Y-\nbit color and retain ALL the colors of Y-bit color [Where X and Y \nindependently are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32] regardless of monitor resolution {63 \ndpi [12" color] to 94 dpi [PaletteBook]} or monitor type {including \nautosynchronous VGA, MCGA and SVGA monitors with ranges including 66.7 hz \nvertically and 35 kHz horizontally and only a hardware video adaptor (MacUser \nAug 1992: 158-176).  Older machines that supported color {SE/30, II, IIX, and \nIIcx} had only 8-bit color in ROM and needed a software patch to use 32-bit \ncolor (MacUser Special 1993:28-29).  \nTo keep costs down and speed up most Macs have only 8 or 16 bit display \ncapability built-in, but most of those can be expanded to display 24-bit \ncolor.    Presently QuickDraw is optimized for 72 dpi display; QuickDraw QX \nwill change this.\nIn addition, QuickDraw allows, in Macs with a NuBus slot, more then one \nmonitor to be used in any combination, from two monitors showing the same \nthing to multiple monitors acting as one large large monitor with any degree \nof overlap of the pictures.\nVRAM: Video RAM.  Standard for present non-PowerBook Mac's handling of \n built-in video {from a 32-bit color palette}. VRAM provided runs a 8-bit\n color 640x480 display; expandable to 16-bit color or a 8-bit 832x624 display. \nSound output:  Standard in all Macs since the 128K.  Stereo sound became \n standard with the SE/30.\n\nIBM:  Even though PCs have ROM BIOS definitions of how the operating system \ninteracts with the video hardware (Nan Zou), the use of drivers bypassing \nBIOS, video hareware inconsitancies {see Super VGA below} and nonstanderzation\nof clone BIOS have left resolution of video display hardware, OS and program \ninteraction up to the OS and video hardware in question (Faisal Nameer \nJawdat). In addition, IBM and clone makers never bothered to provide a \nstandard hardware mechanism for software to determine what display mode is \nactually present (Matt Healy) nor a standardized screen-drawing toolbox {like \nMac's QD}. As a result the OS must be very well written to detect some modes, \nespecially with some third party cards or to use them consitantly {At present \nthings are so dependent on the interaction of the program, OS, print driver \nand monitor card that editing 32-bit pictures regardless of color mode, OS, \nand monitor type/card combination as one can do on the Mac is impossible with \nan IBM.  For example, one cannot edit a 32-bit color picture done on a OS/2 \n486 with a SVGA monitor on a 386 with VGA {18-bit color palette} and DOS 5.0 \nand still have ALL the colors one started out with}.\nLater IBM machines will have integrated graphics accelerators, faster \nprocessors, and modular upgradeability and may have built-in sound cards, CD \nROM, and Ethernet (PC Week 12/14/92).  \nMDA: Monocrome Display Adapter\n original character-mapped video mode, no graphics, 80x25 text.\nCGA: Color Graphics Array\n 320x200 4 colors or 640x200 b/w, 16 color palette, bad for the eyes.\nEGA:  Enhanced Graphics Array\n 640x350 16 colors from 64 color palette [and some lower res]; some versions \n could run at 256 colors, bearable on the eyes.\nVGA:  Video Graphics Array*\n 320x200 at 256 colors, 640x480 at 16 colors, and some others, these two are \n the most commonly used.  All modes have a 256K CLUT, from a \n 18 to 24-bit {IBM} or a 32-bit {Mac} color palette.  25.175 MHz Pixel Clock\n (Mel Martinez).  Monitors use analog input, incompatible with TTL signals\n from EGA/CGA etc. \nMCGA:  Multi-Color Graphics Array*\n subset of VGA that provides all the features of MDA & CGA, but lacks some EGA \n and VGA modes, like VGA 640x480x16 (Dictionary of Computer Terms-DCT).  \n Common on the initial PS/1 implementation from IBM and some PS/2 Models.\nSVGA:  Super VGA*\n This is not a standard in the way the others were, but instead was a 'catch \n all' category for a group of video cards.  As such, with each manufacturer \n using their own implementation scheme, SVGA was chaos with people debating\n as to what is SVGA and what is not.  In an effort to make SVGA more of a \n standard VESA was established and is used in the newer units, but things\n are still a mess.  Video is either 512K [~1990] or 1M [today], resolution\n of 800x600 and 1024x768 at 16 and 256 colors are common, newer ones [since \n 1990] have the Sierra HiColor RAMDAC, giving 15-bit 32,768 colors at 800x600, \n some of the very newer ones [~6/92] can do 24 bits per pixel [usually \n at 640x480].  Speedwise, too much variation, some very slow [Western Digital \n Paradise based, for example], some very fast [S3 86C911 based, for example], \n some are so-so [like Tseng ET4000, a very popular chipset].  Some limiting \n factors overcome by 40MHz VL Bus & 386's linear address mapping were: \n 8.33 MHz ISA bus, AT architecture where the CPU looks at the card through a \n 64K "window", etc.\nOther non-SVGA standards: \n8514/a:\n IBM's own standard, interlacing graphics accelerator with graphics functions \n like linedraw, polygon fill, etc. in hardware. Some clone implementations \n from ATI are the fastest video available today, though some clone models do \n not have interlacing. \nTMS34010/34020: high end graphics co-processors, usually >$1000, some\n do 24-bit, speeds up vector-oriented graphics like CAD.\nXGA:  eXtended Graphics Array\n newer and faster than 8514/a, only available for MCA bus-based PS/2s, clones \n are coming out soon.  Emulates VGA, EGA, and CGA (DCT).  Max resolution at \n 1024x768x8b, same as 8514/a, also some 16 bpp modes.\nXGA-2\n Accelerates graphics functions up to 20 times faster than standard VGA in\n Windows and OS/2, including line draws, bit and pixel-block transfers, area\n fills, masking and X/Y addressing. Has an intelligent way to detect and co-\n exist with other XGA-2 cards, so multiple desktops like on the Mac may not be \n far away.  Since this is an architecture, its resolution and color depth \n isn't fixed {IBM implements only 16-bit [65,536] color, while other \n companies can have 24-bit color through IBM technical licenses}. Refresh \n rates up to 75 Hz, ensures flicker free, rock solid images to reduce visual \n discomfort, and is VGA compatible. Up to 1280x1024 on OS/2.\n*some monitor types usable by Mac-See Mac section above for specific details.\n\nExpansion\nBoth Mac & IBM\nSCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.\n Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card \n expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  \n Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal \n terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port \n {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the \n end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. \nSCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}\n and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  Difference is due to SCSI-1 software\n drivers.  "Fast SCSI-1" is a misname for 8-bit SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode\n {see SCSI-2 for details}.\nSCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully\n SCSI-1 compliant and 8-bit SCSI-2 tends to be implemented as a very fast\n SCSI-1 since it does not require the different controller interfaces in  \n hardware and software that 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2 do.  Transfer speeds are\n 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and\n 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst {32-bit/wide and fast}.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 can\n use SCSI-1 software drivers and hardware at 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds and as such\n is limited to 7 devices sometimes it is mistakenly called "fast SCSI-1". \n 16-bit fast SCSI-2 requires a SCSI-2 software driver and SCSI-2 electronics\n but can still use the SCSI-1 ports.  Wide 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 require a\n different SCSI port, electronics, and software driver from SCSI-1 {Which\n makes them more expensive than other SCSI interfaces}.\nMac SCSI: asynchronous SCSI-1 built-in standard since the Plus.  Even though \n Apple developed some specifications for SCSI controlers, the OS SCSI Manager\n needs to be rewritten to take full advantage of the features of both SCSI\n interfaces.  As a result present SCSI-2 Macs use 8-bit SCSI-2 as a fast \n asynchronous SCSI-1.  Presently Quadras are the only Macs with a SCSI-2\n controller chip built-in (Digital Review, Oct 21, 1991 v8 n33 p8(1)) \n though they lack some other parts of the hardware, like the wide SCSI-2 port \n interface.  Since other Macs require a NuBus card to use SCSI-2, older NuBus \n Macs had a bottleneck due to the speed of the NuBus and CPU.  Rumor-some\n Cyclone Macs {June} will come with a wide & fast SCSI-2 port standard \n and have a rewritten OS SCSI manager.\nIBM SCSI:  SCSI-1 is not too wide spread yet, generally not bundled with \n systems, except as add-on {EISA and VESA Local Bus adapters avalable}.\n Like the Mac, 8-bit SCSI-2 is used as a very fast SCSI-1 by most controllers\n out there.  Unlike the Mac, IBM has no exact SCSI controller specifications\n which results in added incompatibilities for SCSI.\n\nMac\nMemory expansion: with a few exceptions the Mac has used non-parity 30-pin \n 8-bit SIMM memory expansion since the Plus.  While 32-pin 9-bit parity SIMMs\n could be used in these Macs, only special IIcis could make use of the parity \n feature {By convension both SIMM types are called 32-pin SIMMs}.  The IIfx \n used 64-pin parity SIMMs.  The LC III, C610/650 and Q800 all use a new \n 72-pin SIMM that is accessable by 32-bits at a time and is used in IBMs.\n The Mac does a complete memory check at startup by writing/reading every\n memory location; if something is seriously wrong with a SIMM the Mac will\n not boot and give a sound chord indicating what the problem is.\n Since Macs made before Feb 15, 1993 managed memory baced on data path, SIMMs \n had to be installed in pairs {16-bit} or in sets of 4 {32-bit}.  The Centris \n 650 and Quadra 800 eliminate this with a new memory management setup that \n allows memory to be upgraded one SIMM at a time.  If the SIMMs are the same \n size are used then the memory is 'interleaved' across the two SIMMs resulting \n in a 10-15% performance boost on RAM access (MacWorld Apr 93: 108-109).\nPrinters, ADBs, and modems: built-in interfaces standard.\nMonitor interface and sound input: built-in on most present macs. \nPDS: Available in SE & all present non-Powerbook Macs. 16-bit {SE, \n Portable, LC, LC II, Classic line} and 32-bit.  Operates at CPU's MHz.  \n Maximum through put: data path in bytes*CPU's MHz {Q700/900 & C650: \n 4 * 25Mhz = 100MB/s; Q800 & Q950: 4 * 33Mhz = 132MB/s}. Standardized with\n the LC and 040 bus designs.  With an adapter one NuBus card can be used in \n IIsi and C610.  Problem: some cards have timing dependency which slows \n through put down.\nNuBus Mac II: 32-bit, 10 MHz bus clock, 1-to-1 transaction/bus cycle ratio,\n and contiguous, hand-shake transactions at ~10-20MB/s; theoretical peak:\n 40MB/s.  Built-in on all Modular Macs except the LC series, C610, and \n Performa 400.  The SE/30 could be adapted to use this and there was even a \n Mac Plus SCSI NuBus.  Supports every possible expansion from CPU to Ethernet \n to DMA.\nNuBus 90: NuBus Mac II back compatable. 20MHz bus clock, avg throughput:\n ~30MB/s; burst mode: 80MB/s.  Future card designs will be 7" instead of the \n old 12".\nQuickRing:  A peer-to-peer bus used in parallel with NuBus 90.  Apple's \n VLBus - "Architecture is identical to that of VLBus" (Byte 10/92:128).\n Burst mode: 350MB/s (Byte 10/92:128). In development.\nCPU expansion: handled either through the PDS or the NuBus.  Unlike PDS,  \n Nubus CPU cards {example-Radius Rocket} allow use of multiple processors at \n the same time.  This is like having two or more Macs in the same box able to \n dual task or joinly process depending on the card or software involved {Each \n NuBus card needs its own memory but most NuBus cards of this type come with \n 8MB RAM SIMMs on the card standard}.\n\nIBM\nMemory expansion:  parity SIMMs, non-parity SIMMs {some newer models do a Mac-\nlike SIMM memory check}, or a dozen or so different types of memory boards.\n\nHD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}: \nMFM:  Modified Frequency Modulation, RLL:  Run Length Limited\n only used with smaller [² 60mb] hard drives.\nIDE:  Integrated Device Electronics \n Asynchronous {~5MB/s max} and synchronous {8.3MB/s max} transfer.\n currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized \n drives. Can have more than one hard drive. \nESDI:  Enhanced Small Device Interface\n ~1.25MB/s throughput. generally considered better interface than SCSI-1 in\n many ways but not common enough for practical consideration.  Outside of\n hard drives, device choices are very limited compared to SCSI-1. \n\nBUS interfaces\n{New 'plug and play' ISA and EISA compatable cards may have problems working \nwith old cards (InfoWorld; PC Week 03/08/93; Vaporware 4/93).}\nISA\n 8 & 16-bit interfaces common. Has 24-bit data path limit {which produces a\n 16MB limit for which there are software workarounds} (PC Mag 4/27/93:105).\n 1.5 MB/s (Byte 3/93:132).  Uses edge-triggered interrupts, can't share them,\n hence comes the IRQ conflict.  Limited busmastering capabilities, some cards\n aren't bandwidth limited {COM  ports, LPT ports, game ports, MIDI card, etc.}\n while others are {video and disk controllers}.  Dominant factor, but it's\n showing its age.  Most ISA motherboard designs are 16-bit\n (PC World Feb 1993: 144-5)}.  \nMCA {Micro Channel}\n IBM's 16 and 32-bit bus; "allows use of more than one CPU in a computer" \n (DCT) and anything can talk to anything, as fast as the two components \n involved can handle it. Never took off because it was incompatible with ISA \n and EISA.  Planned to be bus interface of IBM PowerPC 601 (Carl Jabido).\nEISA {NuBus Mac II is closest Mac equivalent}\n 32-bit, 8.33 MHz, burst mode: 33MB/s.  It also has the ability to \n self-configure cards like MCA and allows multiple bus masters, sharable \n interrupt and DMA channels and multiple CPU use.\nVESA Local Bus: VLB {Sometimes mistakenly refereed to as PDS}\n Local Bus standard. Runs at CPU clock rate,  Burst modes: ~130 MB/s{32-bit}\n 250 MB/s{64-bit} (Byte 10/92:128).  Limited to three slots but allows bus \n mastering and will coexist with either ISA or EISA. Consitered ideal for \n video and disk I/O.  DELL has filled a claim that this violates one of\n their patents (Mel Martinez).\nQuickRing: Apple's faster {350 MB/s burst} version of VLB architecture\n (Byte 10/92:132).  Might show up in some IBM and PowerPC machines\n (Byte 10/92:132-133). In development.\nPCI\n Intel's version of Local Bus that is intended to totally replace \n ISA/EISA/MCA.  In development.\n\nOSes {assumes full installation [print drivers, fonts, Multifinder, etc.]\nand multiple application use.}\nMac\n512K to 1MB of OS and hardware commands have been put into ROM.  This allows \nApple to control its machine by putting key hooks for the Mac OS {QuickDraw, \nmenu commands, print, mouse, SCSI & sound drivers, etc} in ROM, which require \nclone makers to use the ROM chip or read ROM on to disks {Which requires \naccess to the proper Mac since different Macs have slightly different ROM \nchips; Plus vs Classic for example.}  With key hooks for the OS support \ninterface in ROM, programers do not have to worry as much whether the disk OS \nhas the necessary hardware commands or that those commands are consitant and \ntherefore can write smaller programs.  This also allows Apple greater control \nover hardware-software standards and that the disk OS can be smaller and, with \nsome of the tookbox command code in ROM, with lower RAM requirements then a \ntotally disk based OS.  Macs use Masked ROM which is as fast as DRAM (Jon \nWtte).\n6.0.7: Single program usage base requirements: 1 MB and DD floppy, \n cooperatively-multitasking base requirements: 2MB and HD floppy.  \n Features a GUI, cooperative-multitasker [MultiFinder], standard program \n interface, & standard stereo sound support [snd]. Network receiving part of \n AppleShare software is bundled with the OS. Has a 8MB RAM barrier and is a \n 24-bit OS. Some third party products allow 14MB of Virtual Memory as long as \n real RAM is below 8MB.\n6.0.8: 6.0.7 with 7.0.0 print drivers.\n6.0.8L:  System 6 for some Macs that require System 7.0.X.\n7.0.X: Base requirements: 2MB, 40MB Hard Drive, and 68000; De-facto standard \n to run all features well: 4MB, 80MB Hard Drive, and 68030 {lowest present \n non-portable Mac configuration}.  Using up to 10.08MB {This is EVERYTHING on\n system disks} of hard disk space this has 6.0.7 features plus program linking \n within and between computers [IAC], built-in server capabilities {Filesharing \n can be used by older OSes using AppleShare Client software and can be \n accessed by 10 macs max; 4-5 is more speed practical, IAC requires 7.X}, \n Virtual Memory in machines with MMU{1.6 times real RAM for least noticeable \n IIsi speed degradation}, drag and drop, QuickTime & built-in TrueType \n support.  Supports sound input [AIFF and snd formats] for most present \n machines.  Can access up to 1GB of true RAM and 4GB of virtual memory and is \n both a 24 and 32-bit OS.  To use real RAM beyond 8MB it must be in 32-bit \n mode and on older machines requires the 'Mode 32' extension.  Apple's last \n 'free' OS.\n7.1.0: 7.0.1 with WorldScript support, speedier, and less RAM usage than \n 7.0.dot (MacWeek 8/24/92; 9/14/92; PC Week 9/7/92). To run in 32-bit mode \n on older machines it requires the 'Mode 32' or '32-Bit Enabler' extension. \n Marks the start of Apple saling its Mac OS instead of allowing free upgrades\n {Bundled with new machines, $49 for 7.0.X upgrades, $99 otherwise}.\n [The installer has a bug that when upgrading it may keep some old system \n fonts from the previous system inside the system file.  This can eat up any \n RAM benefits and cause other problems.  Apple itself recommends removing all \n fonts from the system file.]\nA/UX 3.0 [UNIX]: Needs 8MB RAM {12-20MB suggested}, 160MB hard drive, and \n a 68030 or 68040 equivalent to run.  This 32-bit preemptive multitasking OS \n is large due to being UNIX and needing translators between it and the Mac \n ROMs.  Price: $709.\nNote: sound output was supported in OSes 3.2 to 6.0.5 by many formats \nincluding the following:  snd, WAVE, ASND, FSSD, QSSN, SMSD, SOUN, dc2d, and \nDCFL.  In 6.0.7 the sound manager was optimized for the sound standards 'snd' \nand AIFF which causes some playback problems for the old formats, though most \nstill play.\n\nIBM\n Machiness have little GUI code, data, and hooks present in hardware for \nprogrammers to work with, so most of the coding must be provided in the OS.  \nSince hard disks were slow the disk OS code is read into RAM.  In addition, \nwhat little ROM code there is also read into RAM {a process called Shadow ROM}  \nThis results in faster implementation since RAM is faster then PROMS or \nEPROMS.  Having most of the OS code on disk has the advantage of being able to \nbetter optimize the code given a certain piece or collection of hardware which \nis harder with a ROM based system due to the 'patches' needed.  In addition it \nreduces the need for and size of patches if a major revision of the hardware \nsupport is needed.\nSide note:  The FTC charged that MicroSoft formed a OS trust by not providing \nall feature documentation for its OSes to developers outside MS and designing \nits Windows and DOS apps to fail under OS/2 ("Undocumented Windows") and \n"There is deliberate code in [Windows] NT Beta which causes the install to \nabort if OS/2 Boot Manager is present" (Gregory Hicks, Info-IBMPC Digest V92 \n#201).  Due to a conflict of intrest by one member the vote of the FTC \njudicial council for action against Microsoft was a tie which resulted in no \naction.  Rumors-the FTC will presue the matter, likely to the point of \nchoosing a new member or whole new council.  In addition the government has \nturned down Microsoft's copyright of "Windows" which would allow it to charge \na fee for developers using their hooks (PC Week 03/08/93).\nMicroSoft OSes\nDOS 5.0: Has a 640K barrier with its own memory manager, a 1 MB barrier \n with third party memory managers.  This 16-bit OS requires that each program \n must provide its own print drivers and be 16-bit {Programs need to be DOS \n Protected Mode Interface (DPMI) compliant and running on a 386dx [32-bit \n Protected Mode] to break these barriers}.  Contains the GUI shell present in\n DOS 4.0.\nDOS 6.0: DOS 5.0 with the added features of a built-in file compresion, disk \n defragmenter, debugger for the CONFIG.SYS file. It needs a $80 module for \n networking {Cost: $50 through 5/93, after that $129.99} \n (Byte April 1993:44-46).\nDOS 7.0: 32-bit DOS. In development (PC Week 04/05/93).\nWindow 3.0: Runs on top of DOS.  Breaks 640K and 1M barriers but still has to \n deal with DOS file structure.  Base requirements: 1MB, floppy and 286; to\n run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx and fast display adapter {> 8-bit}.  Has the\n equivalent of Mac's QD called Windows GDI [Graphics Device Interface].\n This does not have a consistent application interface {Like early Mac\n programs  (1984-1985)} nor a very large program base {compared to DOS} and\n still tends to slow the machine down (Info-IBMPC Digest V92 #186) with speed\n is more dependent on the display adapter then on the CPU (Bill Coleman).\n Window programs tend to be disk and memory hogs compared to their DOS\n counterparts (Byte April 1993:98-108).\nWindow 3.1: A faster version of Window 3.0 with better memory managment. Base \n requirements 1 MB, hard drive and a 286 ;to run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx. \n Apple plans to release its print drivers for this (PC Week 12/28/92).\nWindows for Workgroups:  To run well: 4MB RAM and 386dx (PC World Feb/93:160).  \n Intermediary between Win 3.1 and Windows NT.  It is basically Windows 3.1 \n with built-in peer to peer networking support.\nWindows NT:  Beta release takes about 50MB of disk space [including the \n swap file], and 12MB RAM {Betas are notorious for RAM usage especially in \n the interaction between debuging code and program compliers, hence the \n reports of 24MB requirements}.  Released version supposed to need 8MB RAM \n but, Gates himself now recommends 16MB RAM (PC Week 04/15/92).\n This 32-bit OS has Protected mode multitasking, multithreading, symmetric \n multiprocessing, a recoverable file system, and 32-bit GDI.  Has built in\n networking that is OSF DCE compliant and can handle up to 4GB of RAM.  Even\n though some people see a July 4 release date (InfoWorld Nov 16/92), rumor\n is that the final version will not be available before Oct 1993\n (InfoWorld May 25/92; July 6/92; Vaporware 07/92; 08/92) or 4th quarter 1993\n (PC Week 09/28/92). Windows upgrades will be $295, otherwise $495\n (PC Week 04/15/92; 03/15/93).\nOther OSes\nPC-DOS 6.0: IBM's version of DOS 6.0.  It runs Windows much faster then DOS \n 6.0 due to faster file I/O and video handling (InfoWorld Feb 1, 93).\nDR DOS 6.0: same as DOS 5.0 with some extras {like built-in data compression} \n and memory management enhancements. Still has 640K/1MB barrier.  A later \n version {Novell DOS} of this may use a version of the Mac finder and Apple \n file management system (PC Week 12/14/92; InfoWorld Dec 14/92).\nOS/2 2.0: Unix like features and unix like requirements; 8-16MB RAM,\n 60MB {uses 17-33MB} hard drive, and 386dx CPU. This 32-bit multithreaded, \n multitasking OS can address up to 4GB of RAM but has to use a fast swap file \n to use more than 16 MB RAM on ISA systems using DMA {Direct Memory Access}. \n IBM plans to use Taligent's OOPS in future versions of this \n (InfoWorld Oct 26/92).\nAIX:  IBM's UNIX system, planned to be a subset of PowerOpen and Taligent OS.\nNeXTStep: GUI UNIX to provide NeXT features on IBM machines.  Beta out, final \n version to be out by May 25, 1993.\nSolaris OS for x86: a SunSoft port.  A 32-bit OS with symmetric \n multiprocessing and multithreading, built-in networking capabilities with \n tools to allow remote configuring and adminstration features, and \n communication package.  Client: $795,  50 users server: $1,995, 1000s users\n server: $5,995.  Developer kits-software: $495, hardware: $195.\nMac 7.1 [working name: Star Trek]:  Apple had System 7.0 running off Intel \n Chips and is looking at making a 7.1 version available for IBM \n (ComputerWorld Nov 2/92; MacWeek 03/22/93). At present this is planned to run \n on top of Novell's DR DOS, require a 486 or equivalent to run and that apps \n will need to be recompiled (MacWeek 03/22/93).  Viewed as Novell's answer to \n Windows NT.  The complexity of PC hardware set ups is one reason for slow \n progress {This seems to Apple/IBM's way of leading to the PowerPC line out in \n late 1993/early 1994 and Pink OS in late 1994-early 1995.}\n\nPowerPC\nRumor-IBM will build its PowerPC 601 by late 1993 (InfoWorld June 8 & 15, 92; \nMacWeek 7/13/92; PC Week 3/15/93).  It will have MicroChannel bus and XGA \nvideo (Carl B Jabido), and will run native version AIX and Mac apps (PC Week \n3/15/93); there have been no comments on compatablity of DOS or Windows apps.\nApple's PowerPC 601 machine {Tesseract} is planned to be out Jan 24, 1994 and \nto have MC98601/50 MHz, 4/8MB RAM, a 2.8-Mbyte floppy drive and expected to \nsale near LC line prices {~$2000, down from projections of ~$3000 (MacUser \n9/92:146)}\n(MacWeek 3/22/93).\nPowerOpen [A/UX 4.0]: A 32-bit preemtive multitasking OS planned to run on\n PowerPCs and 68030/40 Macs (MacWeek 7/13/92).  Intel compatibility uncertain\n (See Mac 7.1 above).  Planned base requirements:  68030, 8MB RAM, 80MB hard\n drive (MacWeek 4/19/93). Rumor-ahead of schedule; COULD be out by mid 1993.\n Rumor-this could be the OS for IBM's PowerPC 601 which is due by late 1993.\nPink [Taligent OS]: Expecting delivery in 1994 (Wall Street Journal 1/12/92) \n and may have some parts shipping in OS/2 and AIX in 1993 and Mac OS and \n PowerOpen with the PowerPCs (MacWeek 01/25/93).\nWindows NT: Possible port (MacWeek 04/05/93).  See IBM OS section for details.\nSolaris OS: Version of this Sun Microsystems Inc UNIX OS to run on the\n Power PCs in 1994 (MacWeek 04/05/93).  One of the few OSes to directly state \n that it will run Windows/DOS programs.  IBM OS section for details\nNeXTStep: possible port see IBM OS section for details.\n\nOS Number Crunching (Mel Park)\nMac\n Arithmetic is done in a consistent numerical environment {SANE or Standard \nApple Numerics Environment}. Floating point numbers are 96 bits long when an \nFPU is present and 80 bits otherwise. Exceptions, such as dividing by zero or \ntaking the square root of a negative number, do not cause an abort but are \nhandled in a logically consistent manner. 1/0 produces the internal \nrepresentation for infinity (INF).  1/(1/0) produces zero. The above treatment \nof 1/(1/0) occurs in an FPU-equipped machine even when SANE is bypassed and \nthe FPU programmed directly.\n\nIBM\n Floating point numbers are 80-bits with a hardware FPU, 64-bits when \nemulated.  The way they are handled is dependent on the coding of whatever \ncompiler or assembler was used for a program. On older DOS complilers \nexceptions could cause program aborts; 1/0 and 1/(1/0) would abort to the DOS \nprompt at the point where they occured.  Most present compilers handle this \nbetter.  Result: there is little consistent handling of numbers between DOS, \nWindows and OS/2 programs nor between programs for just one OS.\n\nNetworking [Includes printing]\nWYSIWYG printing can be a problem with either Mac of IBM machines especially \nif one sends TrueType fonts to a older style PostScript printer.\nMac\nHardware: Built-in LocalTalk network port and a built-in printer port.  \nLocalTalk has moderate speeds (230.4 Kb/s) requires special connectors for \neach machine ($15 and up) and can be run off of either the printer port {to \ninclude very old macs} or the network port {standard today}.  Built-in \nEthernet is becoming common but many older Macs require a PDS or Nubus card at \nabout $150-$300 for each machine.  These cards provide three connectors and \ntransceivers {thick, thin, and 10BaseT} for Ethernet.\nThe Macintosh Quadra family and some Centris models includes Ethernet \ninterface on motherboard, with transceivers available. TokenRing has been a \nnetwork option since 1989.\nSoftware: AppleTalk {the suite of protocols} standard with Mac OS, which can \nuse variety of media types.  AppleShare client software included with the OS \nas well and can connect to file servers such as Novell Netware, 3Com 3+Open, \nBanyan Vines, DEC Pathworks, Apple's AppleShare servers, System 7 File Sharing \nmachines, and AFP servers running on variety of UNIX hosts.  MacTCP allows \ntypical TCP/IP communications (telnet, ftp, NFS, rlogin).  A later version \nwill have Unix X/Open Transport Interface (XTI) built-in by the end of 1993 \n(MacWeek 04/12/93).  Third-party software to connect to NFS servers.  DEC \nPathworks provides DECnet support.  Peer-to-peer file sharing software \nbuilt-in to System 7.1 (See OS section).  Full server software is extra. \nPrinting requires connection of the printer and the printer being selected in \nthe chooser.  Changing printers is by selecting a different name in the \nchooser.  The same is true of connecting to servers.\nPrinting bugs:  Monaco TrueType font is different then the screen bitmap font.\n {QuickDraw QX is suppossed to fix this and similar problems.}\n\nIBM  \nHardware: LocalTalk [not widely used], Ethernet,  and TokenRing.\nSoftware: Novell Netware, Banyan Vines, DECNet, Windows/Work Groups, AppleTalk \nprotocols, and AppleShare {subset of AppleTalk}.\nEach of the MS-DOS networking schemes are, in general, totally incompatible \nwith the others. Once you have chosen one, you are pretty much locked-in to \nthat product line from then on.  Windows/Work Groups is a little more \nforgiving and removes some of this problem.  Novell Netware is the biggest, \n{~80 percent of the corporate market.} and in general is more powerful and \noffers better control/management/security than AppleShare, but it's also more \ncomplex to set up and manage.  This will change due to the use of the Mac \nfinder and file management system by Novell. (PC Week 12/14/92 & 12/28/92;  \nInfoWorld Dec 14/92; MacWeek 3/22/93)\nPrinting {Very OS dependent}\nDOS: If it's a single user, then you plug the printer into the parallel port, \n and don't worry about it {Tweeking may be needed with poorly written \n software}.  Network Printing is not controlled by the system, but is mostly \n implemented by the actual program, therefore performance varies from one \n software program to the next.\nWindows 3.x: supports standard drivers and can do a good job of showing "jobs" \n in the print queue, but it always lists printers as "active"... even if they \n are not.  This becomes a problem if there are several incompatible printers \n on the same net, because there's no way for software to reliably determine \n which printer is active right now.  Windows for Workgroups is more Mac-like \n and intelligent about this.\nOS/2: Mac-like; the os deals with printers, with apps making calls to the OS.\nPrinting bugs: due to poor programing some programs for all the above OSes do \nnot have WYSIWYG printing.  This is the fault of the programs in question and \nnot that of the OS involved.\n\nPrice issue: This is very dynamic with Mac providing more build-in features \nthan IBM and IBM being more 'get only what you need' then Mac and price wars \nby both worlds.\nThe IBM machines' modualar nature prevents any kind of true hardware \nstandarization, which in turn requires OSes and programs to be very complex to \nhandle ALL the variation in hardware.  When one adds all the standard Mac \nhardware features to an IBM {built-in input/output sound support, SCSI, PDS,  \nbuilt-in monitor support, built-in networking, standard mouse interface, and \nNuBus 90 in higher machines} the Mac tends to be cheaper then an equivalent \nequipted IBM machine {Especially since some IBM monitors can be used with Macs \nwhich cuts some more of the Mac's cost (MacUser Aug 1992:158-176)}.\n Some prices using some of the info in this sheet and MacUser April 1993.\nAll Macs below come with a PDS slot, VRAM, and SCSI-1 built in.

Hello,\n  I just got some SIMMs,  at least one of which does not work. I don't know if \nthere is a software that can test SIMMs thoroughly or I could just rely on the \nRAM test performed by my computer during the start up. When I installed a dead \nSIMM into an LC or  an LC II, there would be a strange music and no display on \nthe screen. Why? I need your help! Thanks in advance
I am continuing to collect user results to produce a more comprehensive\nreport on IIsi clock oscillator upgrades. I you have attempted the modification\nplease drop me a note with details of your experience. The more reports \nobtained, the more accurate the numbers I will generate.\n\nIf possible, please include the following:\n  1) Top speed achieved\n  2) System configuration at top Mhz setting\n       a) speed rating of the CPU (the last two digits printed on CPU #)\n       b) presence of additional heat sinks\n       c) Nubus & FPU cards used\n       d) floppy drive functionality on both 800 and 1.4 M disks\n  3) Damage incurred during modification\n  4) Damage due to higher speed use\n  5) Average length of time the CPU is on. (i.e. 8 hours a day)\n  6) Unusual other modifications to the usual procedure
From: push@media.mit.edu (Pushpinder Singh)\nSubject: re: Centris 610 Video Problem - I'm having it also!\nDate: Sat, 17 Apr 1993 03:17:45 GMT\n \n \nI'm having exactly the same problem.  Again, it's fine when I switch to 16\ncolors or a smaller monitor.  My configuration is:\n \nModel: Centris 610 with 4 MB/80 HD, 512 VRAM, no cards\nMonitor: MAG MX15F with 16" monitor adaptor (for resolution of 832*624)\n \nI just discovered the problem a little while ago after plugging in my\nnew MAG monitor.  It seems to appear either when scrolling through a\nwindow or when using Alpha or Word and I enter <return>.\n \nMy guess is bad VRAMs as well.  I really hope it isn't a design flaw.  Is\nanyone at Apple listening?\n \nPushpinder Singh\npush@media.mit.edu\n \n***********************************\n\n    Try finding an init called Basic color monitor.  This should clear\nup some probs with Centris 610's and vga type monitors.  I know it\nexists, somewhere I have a binhexed copy, but I don't know where and\nnever got around to installing it.  I have this problem on my sony 1604.
I'm considering buying one of these to offload the internal video\nin my IIci and to get 24 bit color capability on my 13" monitor. What's\nthe deal on them?\n\n1) Do they come with varying amounts of RAM? If so, what is the max\nand min? How much do I need for 640 x 480 x 24 bits?\n\n2) What bit depths are supported? One, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24?\n\n3) Are all these cards accelerated or just some? Is it true that\nmodern accelerated video cards are (at least in general) faster? What\nbit depths are accelerated, all or just 24 bit? I've heard that some\napplications actually run *slower* with this card if they write directly\nto the screen (or something like that). Is this a frequent problem?\nHow much slower is it?\n\n4) Didn't I read (when System 7 first came out) that the card was\nincompatible? If so, how was this corrected (Finder patch, some INIT,\nor other)? Has it been kept compatible with 7.1? Are there many other\napps that it is incompatible with (games or important (i.e., non-\nMicrosloth) apps, for example)?\n\n5) If you have a strong opinion on it's value for someone in my position,\nlet me know what you think a reasonable price is to pay for it.\n\nThanks a lot for you input.\nRick
The problem is this:\nAfter starting up my machine it gives a high pitched sound once at the desktop also it only does it when the mouse is up or a menu is not showing.\n\nas if I click the mouse the noise goes away for the amount of time the mouse is down. also this problem only happens for about 5-10 minutes.
After reading reports from Germany of success in accelerating a Quadra\nor Centris simply by changing the clock oscillator, I decided to test the\nclaim. I pulled out my Variable Speed Overdrive and the motherboard's\n50 mhz clock chip. I put a socket in the clock's place and inserted a\n64 mhz TTL clock oscillator I had left over from working on some SI's.\nI can't believe it. It actually works. I'm not getting SCSI timing errors\neither. This is only after a short run time but I'll keep posting results.\nDid I spend all that money on the VSO for nothing? If this keeps working,\nthe lack of a double boot in itself will be worth the effort.
I agree completely, but there was only a refund for people who bought the GC\nwith a Quadra. I have seen an alpha version of an extension from Apple called\n8.24 GC QuickTime Video which offloads QuickTime compression/decompression\nfrom the cpu to the AM29000 on the card. So it seems it can be done even though\nin a developer article it states that the GC can't be programmed - but they\nasked that any suggestions be sent in anyway...
Noooooooo!  I've been servicing Macs for years too, and I've had to\nrepair a number of motherboards that had been damaged this way.  It's\nrare, but it does happen.\n\nMind you, this doesn't mean you shouldn't do it.  The parts that can\nblow (the ADB power fuse and RF filter) aren't too expensive, so IF you\nhave a someone around who can do component-level repair, it may be worth\nthe risk (especially if you're around Seattle, 'cause you might get to\npay *me* to fix it :-))..  On the other hand, if your only repair option\nis the Apple-standard logic board swap (major $$$$), you should probably\nplay it safe.\n\n\nSCSI: yes, ADB: yes, Floppies: yes...  They can all cause trouble.
Excerpts from cmu.comp.sys.mac: 5-Apr-93 Re: SE Serial Port Speed???? by\nSamuel John Kass@andrew. \nactually a 14.4 kbps modem using standard compression (v3.2 v4.2.bis?)\ncna reach 57,600 bps, however I have not seen any server modems that\nhave hardware compression.

I've got the official word on the LaserWriter Pro 600 memory\nupgrade.\n\nI just got off of the phone with the quite friendly Donna Rossi\nat Apple Customer Assistance.

For those\nwho don't know, the extra 4-meg will allow printing at 600dpi \nor greyscale (at 300dpi).\n\nIf the dealers have questions, they should be directed to their\nhardware support numbers and/or Apple Customer Assistance \n1-800-776-2333, 408-996-1010 (corporate number).\n\nRegards,\n\nGlenn
it can  \nposition.   \nnow, but  \nplease  \n\nSunny,\n\nI asked this question a while ago while contemplating placing my 650 on \nit's side.  I received a response from someone at Seagate (Sorry I \ntrashed the message) stating that most newer drives (Seagates at the \nleast) can very well compensate for gravity.  This means that a \nhorizontally formatted drive can be later placed vertically with no data \nintegrity problems.  The only way that newer drives cannot work is if you \nhave varying forces (shaking, bouncing, etc) so don't place the drive on \nit's side on a rocking chair :).  What constitutes a 'newer' drive I \ndon't know, try calling your drive manufacturer.  I have a Quantum LP240S \ninternal, and since I got it a month ago, I am guessing it's 'newer'.

I have tried almost everything under the sun to get a null modem connection\nbetween a Mac Duo 210 and a PC. I have used MacKermit and VersaTerm on\nthe Mac side. I have used Procomm, Kermit, and Softerm (on OS/2) on\nthe PC (or PS) side. I have used non-Hardware handshaking and hardware\nahdshaking cables. And know MY hands are shaking from the effort. Nothing\nhas allowed file transfers from the Mac to the PS.\n\nIn general, I can type back and forth with no trouble, but only if both sides\nare set to speeds OVER 9600 baud. I cannot send files from the Mac to the\nPS at all, and file transfers from the Duo to the PS are not possible.\nWhen I do a straight ascii send, I can send from the PS to the Duo flawlessly.\nI can send Binhex files this way quite fast, and I know that the\ntransmission is error free.\nBut straight ascii sent from the Mac to the PS is full of errors.\nUnless, of course, I do text pacing so slow that it is like human\ntyping. (well, like 2-3 times faster than human typing).\n\nI would like to hear from ANYONE who has been able to transfer files\nfrom a Duo 210 to a PS via modem or null modem. If you can do it, please\ntell me your EXACT combination of hardware and software. Obviously, I am\ntalking of a true serial port modem, not the express modem. Maybe some\nkind soul with access to a modem and a Duo 210 can check this out for me.\n\nRight now, I am of the opinion that it won't work at high speeds because\nof the power interrupts on the Duo, and it won't work at low speeds\nbecause of some crazy reason I don't understand.\n\nCould I hear from someone attesting that they can really pump information\nout the serial port of a Duo 210 fast? Like via a modem or via a\nsys-ex dump?\n\nCould anyone with a Duo help me out?? I am going absolutely INSANE.\nI wanna know if the problem is MY Duo, or all Duo 210s, or all Duos,\nor just me.\n\nYes, I have checked the cable 1,000,000 times. And not only can I type\nback and forth, but Zterm alerts the users if s/he uses hardware handshaking\nand CTS is down. So I know that hardware handshaking is working. And also,\nAccording to Zterm port stats, the buffer never overflows.\n\nPlease help me figure out what's going on...

I had the same problem with my 512 a long time ago.  Resoldering\nthe joints on the motherboard (all of them) fixed it.  Turns out\nthat continuous heating and cooling caused annular (ring-shaped)\ncracks to develop in the solder, effectively cutting the video\ncircuitry off.  If you're not a solder-jockey you might want to\nhave someone else do it -- I took mine to an electrical engineer\nbuddy -- but it was a 20-minute job, tops.\n\n-Kelley-\n-- \n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nThomas Kelley Boylan, PowerPC, IBM Austin, kelleyb@austin.ibm.com

I'm having a real tough time finding out the proper adapters to use a VGA\nmonitor (an IBM 8513 sold w/ many PS/2's to be exact) on the Mac LC III. \nAll of the vendors I have called say that the internal video will not work\non a true VGA monitor but will work on a IBM Compatible multisync like the\nsony's or the NEC monitors.  I thought the VGA capability of LCIII was very\nattractive because it allowed you to use inexpensive VGA monitors.  Am I\nconfused or are these vendors just not up to speed?  Has anyone used an\nLCIII with a non multisync VGA monitor and if so where did you get your\nadapter (please be specific w/ vendor and cat #)?  I would prefer to get a\napple monitor for these LCIII's (it's unseemly to see the finder inside an\nIBM bezel) but the more money we save on monitors the more LCIII's we can\nafford and the more PS/2's we can get rid of!

We have a user that has Word 5.0 and is using symbols such as pi and\nother mathematic sysmbols, plus doing fractions, etc.\n\nThe document shows up on the screen with no problems, looks fine.\n\nWhen she tries to print it on a IIg the pi changes to an upside down\ncaret, and several other symbols change to double quotes at bottom of\ncharacter, plus some little circles appear between words of the fractions\ninstead of spaces.\n\nThis happens on a IIg laser printer.  Tried it on serveral macs and two\ndifferent IIg's.\n\nPrints fine on an NT and NTX laser printers.\n\nWhat's wrong???\n\nThanks for any help in advance,\n\nGary\n\n-- \n\n***************************************************************************\n\nGary Weis\nUniversity Computer Center\n400 Hal Greer Boulevard\nHuntington, West Virginia  25755-5320\n\nPhone:  (304) 696-3205\nFax  :  (304) 696-3601\n\nInternet:  Gary@marshall.wvnet.edu\nBitnet  :  Gary@marshall\nUCC Net :  Gary
HELP!\n\n	I just received my Falcon 2.2.1 upgrade from Spectrum Holobyte today.\nMy SE is running Sys 7.0.1 with 4mb of RAM. Like the instructions said, I only\ninstalled Disk 2 (The program...no start up screen or music).\n\n	I just downloaded Macsbug from ftp.apple.com like it said, and\ninstalled it in my System folder. I restarted the mac an hour later, and it \nwouldn't completely boot off the internal HD. I get the "happy mac", then it\ndisappears, only to reappear and repeat the cycle continuously. I never even\nget the "Welcome to Macintosh" message. Norton utilities fixed about 12 new\nproblems, but the same thing still happened.\n\n	What do I do?\n\n	Please e-mail to "orly@aludra.usc.edu"\n\n\n		THANKS IN ADVANCE!!!\n\n\n		Victor Orly\n\n;
I'm having exactly the same problem.  Again, it's fine when I switch to 16\ncolors or a smaller monitor.  My configuration is:\n\nModel: Centris 610 with 4 MB/80 HD, 512 VRAM, no cards\nMonitor: MAG MX15F with 16" monitor adaptor (for resolution of 832*624)\n\nI just discovered the problem a little while ago after plugging in my\nnew MAG monitor.  It seems to appear either when scrolling through a\nwindow or when using Alpha or Word and I enter <return>.\n\nMy guess is bad VRAMs as well.  I really hope it isn't a design flaw.  Is\nanyone at Apple listening?
I'm thinking about upgrading my 030 50MHz to the 040 33version.  Has anyone\nhad any experience with the accelerator, and if so - what do you think?\nAny problems, what are the speedometer results?, is it much faster than\nthe 50MHz?  Basically, I'd appreciate hearing all about this product.  Please\nrespond via email, and I'll summarize if there's a big response.  thanks\nin advance, Andrew
Just a quick summary of recent findings re. high speed modems. Top three\ncontenders seem to be AT&T Paradyne, ZyXEL, and US Robotics. ZyXEL has the\nbiggest "cult following", and can be had for under $300, but I ignored it\nbecause I need something with Mac software, which will work without any\ntweaking.\n\nThe AT&T Dataport earns nearly unanimous praises for reliability. They are\nbackordered at the moment, probably because of the special $299 price in\neffect until May. Its fax capabilities are worse than that of the other two\nmodems. WARNING: AT&T ads say that the modem comes with a Mac kit (cables &\nall), and has lifetime warranty. This applies *only* when you order\ndirectly from Paradyne! I called ElekTek (one of the distributors), and\nthey wanted to charge me $16 for cable, and gave only 1 year warranty...\n\nUSR Sportster for the Mac is also highly (but not as highly) recommended;\nit's only $250 from ClubMac, and if you are willing to roll your own cable\nand don't care about the FAXstf software, you can get the generic model\nfrom PC outlets for $190.\n\nAll this assuming that you don't have a rich uncle, and can't afford a\nMotorola Codex...  :-(    I ended up ordering the Dataport; we'll see how\nit works in two weeks or so.
No, he's not missing anything.  You're right that some models of the 650 ship in\nthe USA without FPU or Ethernet.  Per Ejeklint is also right -- *all*, I repeat,\n*ALL* Centris 650's sold here in New Zealand and, I assume, Europe have the FPU\nand Ethernet.
I'm looking for a Cache card for my IIsi. I can spend $250 Max for it,\n	what i need is 64 kb cache with a fpu socket and a dual slot adapter.\n	Or at least a passe_through connector so i can keep my graphic card.\n	I need your advice about the best card i can buy. How much performance\n	increase i should expect, does the performance increase between the\n	32 and 64 kb Cache worths the price difference ?. And what's the best\n	price i can get for such a card (i really need to spare each possible\n	$). \n	I have an Ethernet card for the LC with fpu. I don't think it would\n	work for the IIsi but the fpu is socketed. Do you think i can take the\n	fpu out of the card and put it in the empty fpu socket ?. Would it work\n	at 20 Mhz ?. If not, how much should i pay for an extra fpu ?.

Hi there,\n\nDoes anyone know why Apple has an ambiguous message for\nC650 regarding fpu?  In all Mac price lists I've seen, every C650\nhas the message "fpu: optional".  I know from what we've discussed in this\nnewsgroup that all C650 have the fpu built in except the 4/80\nconfiguration.  Why would they be so unclear about this issue in their\nprice list?\nI'm planning to buy the C650 8/230/cd pretty soon, but I'm now getting\nconfused with whether it comes with fpu or not.\nWhy say "optional" if it's built in?\nPlease, anybody help me understand this game.\n\nRegards,
The si has a single expansion slot, that can be either PDS or Nubus, but not\nboth together. The card lies parallel to and above the motherboard & HD and\nrequires an adaptor slot to do this. There are Nubus and PDS adaptort cards.\nThus, what kind of slots you have depends on what kind of adapter card you\nhave. With the exception of the Radius rocket, all NuBus cards I know of work\nin the si. PDS slots and thus cards are Mac specific, thus not all PDS cards\nwork in all Macs.

the\nboot\nreboots\n\nThis problem is usually a low +5 Vdc from the power supply, there is an  \nadjustment for this on the supply. If the voltage is still unstable or low  \nthen the culprit is probably a bad rectifier at CR20.
Could someone please tell me what a \n\nLaserWriter IINTX upgrade kit is.\n\nIts a small box, which has a bag inn it , seemingly\ncontaining 6 chips (look like ROMS) and a IINTX manual.\nThe installation instructions are most informative and say, in full,\n"This product must be installed by an Apple ........."\n\nSO what does this do ? At first I thought it might be a NT to NTX\nupgrade, but I thought that required an entirely new board.\n\nAny info appreciated.
Apple does not authorise sales through Mail Order.  As a result mail order\ncompanies have to obtain their machines by the grey market.\n\nThis market is supplied with machines from authorised resellers who have\nmore machines than they can sell.  They come into this state of affairs\nby overordering either accidentally or deliberatly to get a better\nwholsale price from Apple.  In either case they often obscure the serial\nnunber to protect their identity.  As a result the warranty is void.\n\nYou may save on sales tax but you have to pay for shipping.\n\nI should also point out that mail order companies cannot get lower prices\nthatn the high volume authorised dealers unless they buy below dealer\ncost.  As a result the only way they can sell cheaper is by cutting costs\nand trimming margins.  Unfortunatly they dont seem to be doing too well. \nThe lowest prices I have been quoted mailorder do not beat the lowest\nprices available from authorised local dealers.\n\nThey are even further away from educational prices.
wouldany one know afair price for an LC Color card in Aussie dollars??\njust wondering...
Hi everyone. I recently posted about how I received a bad vram chip for my\nnew LCIII, and someone responded that it may not actually be bad, but it may\nbe a 512K LC vram chip, and thus doesn't work properly with my computer. So\nI'm wondering if anyone can interpret these codes for me, so I can figure\nout what type of chip MacConnection sent me.\n\n		 2515251\n\nOn the back of the card, it says 0593\n\nI believe from the numbers that means it is an 80ns chip, but I can't figure\nout what the size is supposed to be. If anyone can help, I'd be grateful.\nPlease email me your response. Thanks a lot!\n\n-- \nHillel Sims  -----  simsh@rpi.edu  -----  Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
The Logitech ScanMan 32 is a nice unit, compact and effective it will\nbring in graphics with surprisingly good quality. Note that its effective\nresolution in grey scale mode is only about 72 dpi. If you don't intend\nto magnify a graphic, it works fine. A true 256 level gray scanner would\nwork better for images.
While there may not be a part number for the CD300i drive, I have seen\na part number for the bezel kit (a new front panel with the slot in it\nthrough which you insert the CD). The document (which I got from the\n2/10/93 announcement at our Apple office) states the drive kit and bezel\nkits are separate items and the bezel kit has an SRP of $149 fro the C650.\nThe external unit may be a better deal after all.
So far I have only seen pictures of the new ergonomic keyboard,\nbut it seems that the 'b' is placed on the left part after the split.\nHowever, when I learned typing in school some years ago, I was taught\nto write 'b' with my right hand.

I would be very wary of retail outlets selling as cheap as educational prices!\nI went for a retailer, actually mail order (CDA computers), because its price\nwas better thant the campus computer store. I found out why later on when I\ntried to get a repair done at an Apple registered repair center - the CPU was a\nresale. The serial number had been removed and replaced with a non-standard\nnumber (probably from CDA computers). Consequently, the Apple repair man could\nnot do ANY warrenty repairs. So I ended up with just a 90day warrenty from CDA\nover the Apple 12month warrenty. Boy, was I pi**ed! Moral of the story, CAVEAT\nEMPTOR.\n\nHowever, if you go with a reliable, trustworthy mail order firm (if they exist\n- maybe someone could enlighten us with their experiences), you will probably\nget a better price than your local educational outlet simply because mail order\nout of state does not REQUIRE sales tax yet. Though for how much longer remains\nto be seen. The addition in sales tax on a CPU purchase will probably wipe out\nan educational discount. Again CAVEAT EMPTOR, some mail order companies DO\ninclude sales tax on purchases even if they are out of state, so check!
The docs say that it's a SCSI Manager bug, if this changes things at all...
The Sound Driver is pretty ok, since it's fast. Sound Manager used by the\nbook is *useless*. Disposing of sound channels as soon as sound has completed\nis out of the question for games with smooth animation. (It's too slow.)\n\nThe Sound Driver is so much snappier than Sound Manager. Unfortunately,\nSystem 7 supports it poorly, making programs crash occasionally.\n\n\nWell, I want my code to work on old systems too. I don't know about sys 7.1,\nbut at least on 6.0.7, there are bugs in the Sound Manager that causes\nchannels to hang (with no error message). This happends when I keep a\nchannel open for long periods - necessary for performance - and play many\nsounds, stopping sounds halfway. Callbacks seems not to be reliable.\nThen only way I can safely tell if a sound has stopped playing is to\ninspect private variables in the channel (QHead, I think it was), and the\nonly way I have found to tell if a channel is hung is to inspect an\n*undocumented* flag and modify it.\n\nAm I happy with this? Nope. I consider writing to SoundBase simply to get\nrid of the bugs.\n\nAny better suggestions? (Silent games is not among the acceptab|e solutions.)
There's only one physical size for VRAM SIMMs (unlike DRAM SIMMs which \ncome in many, many sizes and pinouts), although they do come with \ndiffering amounts of VRAM on them.  The ones you need are 256KB SIMMs, are \norganized as 128K x 16, and have two 128K x 8 VRAM chips on them.  This is \nthe only size which the Quadra and Centris machines can use.\n\n\nTwo.\n\n\nBoth SIMM slots must be filled; putting a SIMM in only one slot does \nnothing for you.\n\n\n80 ns for the Q800 and C650, 100 ns for the C610.\n\n\nThere are certain VRAM chip manufacturers whose parts are not compatible \nwith the Quadra and Centris video hardware.  Make sure that the source you \nget them from guarantees compatiblity.  In general, if it works in a Q950,\nit will work in a Q800.\n\n\nTrust me.  ;-)
Officially, no. From experience (yours now included!), yes. Quantums seem to\nbe the most problem-free brand on the Mac.\n\n\nIt should not matter for the hard drive or the Mac.  Well, as long as it\ndoesn't fall over.   ;)\n\n\nDoug

Well, although this may be an uncommon occurrence (or not) I had a "bad"\nexperience with TechWorks.  This past summer I upgraded (increased) the memory in\na powerbook and a ci.   When I called to place the order for the PB RAM, I was\ntold by the sales person that they would give me a $50 rebate if I would return\nthe original RAM (which was also TechWorks RAM.)  I followed the instructions for\nreturning the old RAM, expecting to see a credit on my VISA within a few weeks.\n\nWell, months went by, and no credit.  After many calls (almost none of which were\never returned - arghhh) I finally found someone who told me "Why we never\nreceived your old chips."  I then explained I the procedure that I had\nfollowed to return them, to which the person replied "You mean you sent them\nUS Mail?" (which I had, per the original sales person's instructions.)  I was\ntold that they their loss of US mail shipments is not uncommon (come on) and that\nI should have sent the stuff via FedEx, etc.  I reasoned that I had done exactly\nwhat I had been told to, but they would not budge, the people I spoke with were\nabsolutely no help.  I sent letters, copies of the original receipts, attempted\nto trace the package through the US mail, made *many* more phone calls to\nTechWorks, all to no avail (I wouldn't give-up because I was so disgusted.)\nSales/support people, supervisors, there was nothing I could do to pursuade them\nto "make it right."\n\nI finally (in total disgust) wrote a letter to my credit card company, asking\nthem to investigate the problem.   Three weeks later, the credit miraculously\nappeared on my statement.  I have not (in recent memory) been so disgusted with\nthe service that I received from a company.  In all fairness, they had no way of\nknowing that was not trying to rip them off, but I went to *such* great lengths\nto prove to them that this really happened.  Oh well, c'est la vie.  I will never\nbuy another product from them again.

Shure it is temperature dependent, but this does not clean all your\nproblems.\nBased on some exp. I must say that the connections between the power supply\nand the Monitor and Main Board are usable to this failure, Ram simms can be\nbadly connected due to some corrosion and the powersupply can be in the\nlast\nphase (lower Voltage).\n\nSo you can do following if you are used to such technical terms.\n1) Clean all mentioned contacts with contact spray\n2) readjust the 5 Volt level of your powersupply\n3) use a calm fan and think of preventing dust blowinÔ through the floppy!\n   (a fixed piece of paper can prevent this)\nif you don't know how to do it beg a friendly technician!\n\nChristian Bauer

Jeff,\n  I have answers to both of your questions.  First, I recommend the Sony\nCPD-1320 monitor.  It is a 14" Trinitron VGA monitor, but it is designed\nspecifically for use with the LC.  It works only with Macs with specific video\ncapabilities which means only the LC's and anything after the ci.  All it\ntakes is a MAC<->VGA cable (I recommend one from James Engineering which is\nabout $20).  These cost about $335 as compared to the much higher prices of\ncomparable monitors because they are not multisynch.  I have used one for half\na year and I love it.  \nSecond, I have used Syex and found them to be decent.  I had a backorder on a\nSupra modem which I cancelled.  They were helpful in explaining the reasons\nwhy there were delays and they had Supra's number ready for me.  The only\ncomplaint was that they did not always return my calls.  \nI have been told that the CPD-1320 is selling for $339 from J&R's\n(800)221-8180.  I think Syex is a little more, but I don't know.\n\n-David
Huh?  If I buy a 128M optical, I might lose my friends?  Why - do they\nsmell bad?\n\n:-)\n\n\n\nOn a serious note, I have heard the tales about SyQuest failures.  But I\nam curious about Jon's comments on cartridge wear for the the Bernoullis.\nCan someone elaborate?  Is there a general consensus that the 128M opticals\nare the most reliable?  I am mostly concerned about media failures, as\nopposed to drive mechanism failures.
It must be... ...I type it with my left hand.  Personally, I would have\na real problem with my keyboard opened up like that, because I tend to\nshare some keys with both hands, particularly if I'm doing something else\nwith one hand (like using the cursor keys, mouse, or glass of Jolt).
I have the a CD-Technology drive with the Toshiba mechanism, and it is\nsupposedly the fast and best now.  It has an access of 200ms and a data\ntransfer rate 300Kb/sec.  It is multisession photo-cd compatible.  It is\navailable from educorp for $599, the CD-Technology one, and comes with two\nmail in coupons for two free CDs.  I'm not sure if the cd's are good, since\nI've only had the drive a little less than a month and had the cd's shipped\nto my home address in california instead of here in maryland.  The\nCD-technology drive has a separate power supply separated from the drive,\nwhich supposedly gives it a longer life, and keeps it cleaner with no fan to\nattract dust.  A Toshiba brand drive is also available, but I think the\nCD-Technology is better, since you get the same mechanism, and at a slightly\nlower price with two free CDs.\n\nThe Apple 300/330i Drive, Sony Mechanism, is around a 300ms access time I\nthink, and a data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  I know it is the slowest of the\nthree mentioned here.  It is not widely available, except through the apple\ncatalog, which is bad at a price of only $599.  It is also multi-session photo\ncd compatible. I think the external model comes with 7 free cds, some of\nwhich are pretty good.\n\nThe NEC drive has been out the longest.  it has an access time of 280ms and\na data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  it is available from many vendors around\n$600 dollars, including Educorp.  It wasn't multi-sesssion photo-cd compatible\nbefore, but I hear that the current version that is shipping is.  Owners of\nthe older drives can get an upgrade.  It does not come with any free cd's\nunless you buy it in a bundle.\n\nOf the three CD-Rom drives above, i think the best choices would be the\nApple drive and the CD-technology(toshiba) drive.  The apple drive for it's\ncompatibility with apple products and the cd-technology(toshiba) for it's\nspeed and performance. \n\nBTW, the models of the drives are:\n\nApple: AppleCD 300 or AppleCD 300i (internal)\n\nCD-Technology:  CD-T3401 (the Toshiba brand name model I'm not sure, but it\nis also something like with 3401)\n\nNEC:  CDR-74\n\n\nI'm very happy with my drive.  And have had no compatibility problems\nwhatsoever.  If I am wrong about any of the above, do correct me, but I am\npretty sure of myself, even when I think I'm not.\n\nAlso, some of you out there might notice that I have the same last name as\nthe president of CD-Technology which happens to be in southern california,\nmy hometown.  However, I AM NOT a relative nor do I know the guy.  Liu is\njust a common chinese name, especially in southern california, with the\nenormous chinese community.

I would like to know what people's opinions are about the \n"real world" differences are between a C650 with and without \na coprocessor...\n\nI don't use anything like Mathamatica, Maple, etc. I don't use\nSpreadsheets (at least no sheets with complicated anything), I\ndon't use 3D CAD apps (although I used to), \n\nI DO:  use 3D renderers, EXTENSIVE communications, I run a BBS,\nI write software, I write papers, etc...\n\nBTW, just for kicks, this is what I was told by my local Apple\nRep about upgrading a 68LC040 to a 69RC040 on a C650:\n"Well, Apple built in an extra socket for the coprocessor chip.\n That way, you just plug in the coprocessor, and it works."\nI then heartily laughed and hung up the phone.\n\nthanks,\n\n-nate
Dear Netters,\n\nMy sister has an Apple 12" Color Display hooked up to an LC.\n\nProblem:  There is an annoying, horizontal, ghost-like stripe that \nprecesses vertically about once per second.  It is about 1 cm high.\nShe is in grave danger of going insane because of it.\n\nAny ideas of what it might be and how I might cure it for her?\n\n-Joe Betts\nbetts@netcom.com
The third-party media adapters are usually cheaper (at least in Toronto) than\nApple's. I bought the adapters from Asante instead of Apple.\n\n\nThat's not true. Only the DECstation 5000/200 comes with a Thinwire\n(BNC, coaxial) Ethernet connector. The 5000/25, 5000/133 and 5000/240\nall have a single 15-pin AUI Ethernet connector only. I distinctly\nremembered this because when got the 5000/200 first and I thought all\nof them are going to be Thinwire. I eventually had to go back and ordered\nDESTAs (DEC's oversized version of an AUI-to-BNC adapter that MUST be used\nwith a transciever cable) for the rest of the stations.\n\nMy advise to the very original poster (Beverly?) is:\n\n(1) If all you want is to create a LAN with two workstations and won't add\n    machines to it EVER, go for Thinwire regardless of the media type. Going\n    for UTP (unshielded twisted pair) wiring requires a concentrator which\n    means extra money and I believe these units come with at least 6 ports.\n    As for Thicknet, it's a nightmare and cabling is expensive. Avoid it\n    unless you have no choice (e.g. the two machines are two floors parts).\n\n(2) On the Mac side, you will need:\n    - one Thinwire media adapter (from Apple or third-party).\n    - MacX (make sure you get version 1.2; 1.1.7 won't run on System 7.1).\n    - MacTCP (which comes with MacX; if you get MacX v1.2, you should be\n      getting MacTCP v1.1.1 with it. Don't use earlier versions on a Centris).\n    - you may or may not need a 25ohm terminator depending on the\n      Thinwire media adapter. So just ask the sales if the adapter is\n      self-terminated or not.\n    - configure MacTCP to use "Ethernet".\n\n(3) On the DECstation side, you will need:\n    - for a Model 200, you will only need a T-connector.\n    - for Models 25, 125, 133, 240, you will need an AUI-to-BNC adapter.\n      Get one that can be plugged in directly to the AUI port of the\n      DECstation. This way you save the cost of a transciever cable\n      (a 15-pin AUI male to a 15-pin AUI female cable).\n    - get a 25ohm terminator.\n\nYour two-machine network will look like this:\n\n\n       ##T----------------------------------------------[]\n      +-----+                                           |\n      |     |                                           |\n      +-----+                                         +-----+\n                                                      |     |\n                                                      +-----+\n    DECstation                                        Centris\n     5000/200                                           650\n                              OR\n\n       ##T----------------------------------------------[]\n        {=}                                             |\n      +-----+                                           |\n      |     |                                         +-----+\n      +-----+                                         |     |\n                                                      +-----+\n    DECstation                                        Centris\n5000/25,125,133,240                                     650\n         \n   ##    -> 25ohm terminator\n   T     -> T connector\n   ---   -> Thinwire (RG58 coaxial cable)\n   {=}   -> AUI-to-BNC (i.e. Thick-to-Thin) adapter\n   []    -> Thickwire media adapter (assuming self-terminated)\n   |\n   |\n\nAndy
Greetings!!\n\n	I'm planning to upgrade my Mac IIsi:\n\n		(1) from the present 5Megs to 17Megs;\n	and	(2) add a Math-Coprocessor.\n\n	Technology Works, of Austin (Texas) comes quite highly recommended by \nsome Mac magazines.  I was just wonderring if anyone could share with me \nanything about Tech Works (both good and bad experiences); or give any advice\nabout other mail-order companies that I may consider.\n\n	Your reply would be very much appreciated.  Thanks in advance.
Hi.  I am working on a project for my marketing class and I'd like to\nask your help.  The assignment is to come up with a product and create a\nmarketing plan for it.  Technical issues are not terribly important at\nthis point.  Well, my group's plan is to market a "full page" monitor\nfor laptop computers.  It would be a third-party product to be installed\nby authorized repair centers (like Newer Technology's PaletteBook\nscreen).  The idea is that the screen would fold in such a way that you\nwould get twice the screen height of a normal screen (remember,\ntechnical issues aside!).  In fact, by adjusting the fold of the screen\nand the monitor configuration, you could have regular OR "full" height. \nThe screen would probably be monochrome.\nThe motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be very\npopular among business people.  Business people also commonly use word\nprocessing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenient\nto see a large portion of the document.  Because of the target users and\napplications, color screens aren't really a neccessity.  We could\nhopefully keep the cost between $2000 and $3000.\n\nNow, please don't write this off as completely ridiculous.  I really\nneed some constructive feedback.  So, if you would, please reply to me\nvia email and let me know:\n1. If you would consider buying a "full page" laptop screen\n2. How much you would be willing to pay for it\n3. Any helpful commentaries on the idea\n\nAlso, if you take this idea and make a lot of money off it (doubtful,\nbut who knows!), please send me some.\n\nThanks in advance!!!
Sorry if this is a FAQ.  I don't normally read comp.sys.mac.hardware.\nI am purchasing a couple of Centris 650's.  I configured the systems\nas follows:\n\n	Eight (8) Mb RAM\n	Ethernet\n	1 Mb VRAM\n	Math CoProcessor option\n\nMy purchasing agent told me about the math coprocessor option and sent\nme the Apple summary documentation to prove it.  I ordered the coprocessor\noption, but I'm really not sure that we needed it.  I thought the '040 chip\nhad a math coprocessor built into it.  Has Apple had a math coprocessor chip\narchitectured to keep up with the speed of the '040 chip in the Centris 650?\nI am concerned that I may have set up a hardware bottleneck.  Please send your\nresponses to:  David_Anthony_Guevara@cup.portal.com.  I will summarize if there\nis enough interest.  Thanks!
I have to increase the memory in a Plus or SE (I'm not sure which since\nI haven't seen it yet). I did this a few years ago but I no longer have the\ninstructions. I forget which resistor needs to be cut to go from 1 to 4 Mbs.
I think this kind of comparison is pretty useless in general.  The\nprocessor is only good when a good computer is designed around it adn the\ncomputer is used in its designed purpose.  Comparing processor speed is\npretty dumb because all you have to do is just increase the clock speed\nto increase speed among other things.\n\n	I mean how can you say a 040 is faster than a 486 without \ngiving is operational conditions?  Can you say the same when \nyou are running a program that uses a lot of transidental functions.\nKnowing that 040 does not have transidental functions building in to \nits FPU and 486 does, can you say that 040 is still faster?\n\n	Anyway, I hope people do not decided upon wether a computers\nis good or not solely on its processor.  Or how fast a processor is\nbased on its name, because one can alway do a certain things to a\nprocessor to speed it up.  \n\n	But if we restrict our arguements to, for example, pure\nprocessor architectural issues.  Or how one processor will work\nwell and another will not based on its design, then we can get\nsomewhere with our discussions.  \n\n- Chung Yang
Yes, quite a number of people it seems from discussions I've had (me\nincluded). I bought my machine a couple of weeks ago as well and\nstarted to experience these problems.\n\nApple Australia via my dealer said that this problem has a number of\npotential causes - Faulty applications, faulty third party hardware\n(modems, memory etc), system software, PRAM corruption and power\nmanager corruption, and the Duo hardware itself.\n\nNone of the above are relevant in my case except the last two maybe\n(no applications were running, the system software was re-installed, I\nhave no additional hardware). I have found that clearing PRAM appears\nto help for a while at least (hold down command option P and R on\nstartup). Unfortunately the problem returns suggesting that PRAM is\nbeing corrupted by something (system software bug ? - I don't have any\nnon-issue inits in my system). Apparently the Power Manager can be\nreset by "holding the reset and interrupt buttons while powering up" -\nApple's advice - but since the Duo does not have an interrupt button\nI'm not sure what they mean in this case. This may also help if\nsomeone can decipher Apple's advice for me.\n\nBeyond this Apple suggest that " you should follow the technical\nprocedures to check the hardware of this Duo". Since so many others\nappear to be having the same problem it would seem to me that there\nhas been a system software bug introduced somewhere along the line -\nand quite recently too - since it only seems to be recent Duo 230\npurchasers who have this problem.\n\nAny more comments from others in the same boat are welcome,\nparticularly Apple Duo engineers :-)\n\ncheers\n\nbrucet
A week or so ago, I posted about a problem with my SE/30:  I have 20 megs\nor true RAM, yet if I set my extensions to use a large amount of memory\n(total of all extensions) then my system will crash before the finder\ncomes up.  What I meant was having a large amount of fonts load, or\nsounds, or huge disk caches with a control panel other than Apple's\nmemory control panel.  Apple's cache is at 64K, mode 32 is on, and\nso is 32 bit addressing.  All extensions work by themselves or with the\nothers until I increase the memory used by some of them (with methods\nmentioned above).\n\nWell, here's my latest followup...  I ran NOWs System Profile and got\nthis information:\n\n%%% Memory info %%%\n\nPhysical RAM size: 20480K.\nLogical RAM size: 20480K.\nSize of Low Memory Area: 8K.\nVirtual Memory: Inactive.\nAddressing mode: 32bit mode in use.\n32 bit System zone: Absent.\nParity RAM: Not capable.\nGrowable System Heap: True.\nTemporary memory support: Present.\nTempory Memory Support: Real and tracked.\n\nNote that 32 bit System zone is absent.  Could this be the problem?\nHow can I turn this on?  Any ideas?\n\nCan anyone help?
It clearly depends on the type of questions you are asking but in many\ncases it will do fine. The critical information from the neuron is in\nthe firing frequency (maximum about 100 action potentials per\nseconds), and not in the amplitude of the signal or in details of the\nsignal shape. So the resolution of about 0.4 % you get with an 8 bit\nconvertor is more then sufficient.\n\nAC coupling does not have to be a problem either, since in many cases\nyou are not interested in the DC level. My pre amplifier is AC coupled\nalso. The critical point is the lowest frequency that will pass. If\nthe cutoff point is to high, the action potentials will be slightly\ndistorted. But even that normally does not matter since it is the\noccurrence of the spike that is important. \n\nHowever, I do want to know what exactly I can expect before I start\nbattling with the toolbox to get it going. As yet I have no clue were\nto start looking for the technical specifications.
I too have been watching the IIsi speedup reports and plan to upgrade in\nthe next few weeks.  The plan I have is to build a small board with a few\ndifferent crystals on it and to be able to switch between the different\nspeeds using a front pannel switch.  This way I can get the speed when\nI want but I can also run at slower (stock) speeds it I experience any\ncompatability problems with any applications.  I don't expect to be able\nto switch clock speeds with the system running, but if I can switch\nwithout any lock-up problems, then I could switch to 33MHz when needed\nand put it back to idle (20 MHz) when not needeed.  This would further\nreduce the wear-and-tear on the CPU even with a heat sink.  Of course\nI would not want to run the different clock signals through the switch\nbut use a chip or two on the board to select the frequency desired and\nroute it directly to the mother board.\n\nI haven't started probing around inside my si yet.  Does anyone know the\nvoltage level to power the crystal oscilators?

I would like more info on this if anybody has it. Our Exabyte\n8500 tapedrive has never been working from the Quadra 950.\nWe have been trying it since September 1992, replaced cabling,\ninits, I don't know what all. All the "industry experts" we\nphoned (the tapedrive dealer, our Apple dealer, the software\ndealer) all say it's our fault, or they don't know. The last\nthing they said was that we needed a special Quadra SCSI terminator\n(???). Anybody know more? Thanks,
Complete Q700 are best obtained from your dealer or some recent\ncopy of MacWorld or MacUser.  My foggy memory suggests that the most relevant\ncomparison factors vis-a-vis a IIci are as follows:\n\n  25 MHz 68040\n  16 Mhz data path (don't recall this for sure, but it's slower\n      than Q 950 style machines for sure).\n  Ethertalk card on-board\n  Audio in/out\n  4 MB RAM on motherboard\n  4 SIMM slots\n  2 NuBus slots.\n  More flexible build-in video than the CI.  Uses VRAM.\n\nIn comparison, a IIci with an accelerator won't give you\n  audio or ethernet  or the same video options.\n  With a 68040 accelerator, CPU performance can be comparable but I\n  think it ends up costing more.
Terry, hi.  I recently bought an LCIII and a Datadesk 101E.  I can't\nremember trying to rebuild the desktop with it, however it did give me\na strange problem.  When I held down shift during startup to disable\nall extensions, nothing happened. I tried it with another keyboard, using\nthe same adb connector cable- and it worked with the other keyboard.\nThe shift key on the Datadesk keyboard worked well otherwise. I checked\nthe dipswitches and they are fine.  Try disabling your extensions and tell\nme if it works.\n\nI am annoyed with Datadesk.  I sent them the keyboard in the mail for\ninspection/repair/replacement.  The technician on the phone said they\nhave a 10-14 day turn around time- meaning you should receive the\ninspected/repaired keyboard in that time.  Well, they have had the\nkeyboard for over 3 weeks and I still have gotten very little info\nfrom them about it. It's annoying because it cost me $12 to send them\nthe keyboard (they do not refund the money) and their costumer service\nlines are toll calls. Tell me if you have a similar experience.\n\n-David
Could someone please post any info on these systems.\n\nThanks.\nBoB\n-- \n---------------------------------------------------------------------- \nRobert Novitskey | "Pursuing women is similar to banging one's head\nrrn@po.cwru.edu  |  against a wall...with less opportunity for reward"
Hi there!\n\nCould some kind soul tell me what is the price of LC/IIvi/IIvx\ncompatible 512kb VRAM SIMMs in the US nowadays? The price over here\n(Finland) is so ridiculously high (about $185 each in USD) that I\nthink it is worth the trouble to try to get them overseas.\n\nThanks
Does one exist, who makes it, and how much?\nThanks:)
I had asked everyone about problems installing a 4 meg\nsimm and an 8 meg simm in my Centris 610, but the folks at the\nlocal Apple store called the folks in Cupertino and found that\nyou can't have simms of different speeds in one machine, even\nif they are both fast enough - ie - My 80 ns 8 meg and 60ns 4\nmeg simms were incompatibable...  Just thought people might\nwant to know.....\n					Jason.
According to the (seen several times) postings from Dale Adams of Apple\nComputer, both the 610 and the 650 require 80ns SIMMS - NOT 60 ns.  Only\nthe Centris 800 requires 60 ns SIMMs.
: Is there a fix for this? We have a Quadra 900 that will NOT finish startup\n: unless there is a monitor connected. This would be no problem, but since\n: we're running it as a file server, there is no need to have a monitor\n: connected all the time.\n\nI've seen a control panel made for this. I don't remember the name, where I\nsaw it, or on what Quadra models it will work. But I do know it exists :)\n\n/Mats

Hi, I bought a while ago a Cache Card w/ FPU from Techworks. It was 219$.\nI think that was the cheapest I ever saw.
No problems.
I thought NEC and Toshiba CD-ROM mechanism have an average \naccess time of less than 200 ms.  While the SONY-APPLE CD-ROM \ndrive has an access time of 300 ms for the doublespin models.
The internal HD in my LC disappeared for a day last week, and I'd like to\nhear any (reasonable) theories folks can suggest for what happened.\n\nIt is an LC, with 10MB of RAM and an 80MB internal drive, running system\n7.1, with a few SCSI devices in a (so far as I know) properly terminated\nchain.\n\nI had shut down the system for a day-- I was out of town and we sometimes\nhave thunderstorms this time of year-- and upon restarting got a blinking\nquestion mark.  I booted from a floppy and saw that my external HD seemed\nokay, but there was no sign of the internal.\n\nI installed a system folder on the external and was, indeed, able to boot\nfrom it.  I tried things like Disk First Aid and Silverlining, to inquire\nabout the internal drive.  They either could not find it or got errors in\ntrying to talk to it. (Silverlining claimed it was a Connor drive, but it\nis a Quantum... )\n\nWell, I'd backed things up, so I was able to work.  But, at some point I\nnoticed that the internal had reappeared.  Now, Disk First Aid says that\nall's well, etc.  Things seem to be fine.\n\nBut, what happened?  Was this a warning that something (the internal HD\nor something else) is about to die?  I'm definitely nervous.\n\nAnd, if this is a signal that the internal HD is sick, is it true that I\ncan only put up to a 127MB drive inside an LC?  Some folks have claimed\nthere's a limitation in the LC (other'n size or power) while others (and\nthat includes LaCie, over the phone) say anything that fits is okay.
Thanks, Steve, for your helpful and informative comments on Mac stereo\nsound.\n\nToo bad some developers aren't addressing the problem.\n\nThis did make my trusty old Mac II superior to the Quadra I replaced\nit with in one way though!  :)\n\n\nThanks,

With a little luck, I could own a C650 sometime in the near future, and\nso I was just wondering if someone could clear these two questions up for me:\n\n1.  What speed SIMMS does the C650 need/want?  (I know that it needs 80ns\nVRAM...not sure for the main RAM.)\n\n2.  I've heard two conflicting stories about the total expandibility of the\nC650's RAM...132 and 136 megs.  Which is true?  (Perhaps another phrasing\nwould be better:  does the 8 meg version come with all 8 megs on the logic\nboard, or 4 megs + a 4 meg SIMM?)\n\nJust wondering....
Hello all.\n	I am thinking about buying an external monitor for my SE/30 and was\nwondering if anyone out in netland has any advice for me.\n	I am mostly thinking about a 14" color monitor and an 8 bit card that\ncan switch between 640*480 and something higher (like 800*600).  I read an\nold report on a card from Lapis that could do this, but could not use the\nexternal monitor as the main screen (with menubar) which to me is a major draw-\nback.  Has this perhaps been fixed? Or can any other cards do this (like the\nMicron Xceed) ?\n	Also which monitor should I buy?  At the moment I am leaning towards\nthe Sony 1304, 1304s or 1320 (what exactly is the difference between these?)\nbut are there any other good cheap monitors I should know about?  Doesn't the\nmonitor have to be multisync to support cards that can switch resolutions?\n\nPlease send me e-mail and I'll summarize.\n\nI would also greatly appreciate getting the e-mail addresses of any mail order\ncompanys that sell monitors or cards.\n\nThanks in advance
My wife has one of these.  I have not had much chance to fiddle with\nit, but in comparison to our Laserwriters with Canon engines, she\ncomplains that the print is too light for her taste.  The difference\nis quite apparent even when the print setting on the Select 310 is\nadjusted to the darkest possible level.  I don't find it\nobjectionable, and indeed rather like it, but be warned that some\npeople don't care for it and it is considerably different.
Note that if you get the external CD300 for your Centris or Q800 you will\nmiss out on the sound mixing feature unless you are willing to run a wire\nfrom the motherboard sound input connector to the stereo output on the CD. \nConnecting to the sound input port on the back of the computer won't do\nunless you can live with mono.

I'm a system and network admin. One of my users has a Duo 230\n([*]specifications below) that has been having slowdown problems.\nLeaving the Duo on for several hours causes it to slow down\nunacceptably.

Apple doesn't make such a card, though I suppose a third party could.  One\nbig problem is that there isn't room for a standard NuBus card inside the\nLC III.\n\nnoah
Hi all,\n\nI just got a La Cie 240 meg external hard drive.  Speed tests show that it's\nsubstantially faster that my internal 105 meg Quantum HD.  Supposedly the 105\nand the 240 (both LPS drives) are roughly rated the same speed.  Why such a \nlarge difference?\n\nMarc.
What do I need to do to be able to run an NEC 3FGx in 800x 600 mode\non my IIci?  Can it be done with the right video card?  If so, which\nvideo card?

I've just installed a 5.25" tape backup in my C610; lot of the issues\nare the same.  So, to answer your questions...\n\n\n\nYou probably want to hard-wire the SCSI ID with shorting jumpers.  Put\nit at a convenient number like "1".  You *could* cut a hole in the\nback of the machine to route the ID switch, but why go through the\nhassle?  You probably won't be needing to frequently change the ID of\nyour internal drive.\n\n\nYeah, when I first installed the tape drive I was a little concerned\ntoo.  But it's no problem, the device is designed to fit just fine\nwith the overhang.  It shouldn't reach back beyond the ROM/RAM/VRAM\nSIMMs, though.\n\n\nYou can special-order parts to mount the device from your local Apple\ndealer.  The relevant parts are:\n\n  922-0358  blank bezel faceplate\n  922-0850  CD-ROM carrier [i.e., generic 5.25" device mounting bracket]\n\nNote Apple's unfortunate choice of name for the slide-in bracket to\nmount a 5.25" device.  The service techs I talked to said, "Oh sure,\nwe stock those."  Of course they were thinking of the CD caddies to\nhold a CD disk when you stick it in the drive.\n\nAs far as I can tell, Apple does not sell a bezel faceplate already\ncut out for a standard 5.25" device.  (Why not?  They advertise\nthese machines as being able to accept any standard device in the\n5.25" bay, why not provide the faceplate?)   They do sell a cutout for\ntheir CD-ROM drive (of course), but that's of no use.\n\nI'm going to hack up the extra bezel I ordered to make a cutout for my\ntape drive, which is a standard 5.25" device.\n\nGood luck with your SyQuest.
Also, has anyone heard any rumors that the new docks (the ones with the CPU\n:-) will be better designed that this first batch?  I love my Duo, but\ninstalling cards in the dock is not much fun.\n\n-Bob
Even the 68000 can fetch two bytes at a time.\n\nThe new instruction in the 68040 is MOVE16 which fetches 16 bytes\nat a time instead of 4 which the 68030 has; that means 4 24bit\npixels instead of one.\n\nCheers,\n\n					/ h+\n-- \n -- Jon W{tte, h+@nada.kth.se, Mac Hacker Deluxe --
Does anyone have any experience using LCIII with MIDI?

I am going to be getting a C650 soon, but I don;t want Apple \nto come out with the Cyclones and the Tempest in a month\nand have the price drop on the system I want.  I have negotiated a \ngood deal with a supplier for a C650 8/80 and I would like to jump on it,\nbut, again, I don't want the price drop to smuther me.  BTW, the deal\nI have is a C650 8/80 with mouse for $2295... does anyone know of a better\ndeal?\n\nthanks,
I have noticed this exact same phenomenon occurs with my LCIII.  Perhaps it is\na quirk of the new machines?
My boss is considering the purchase of a Powerbook or Duo. He is leaning\ntowards a 180, because of the math coprocessor (for Mathematica), but would\nget a Duo if he could find a Mini-Dock with a coprocessor. Have any\nthird-parties announced such a beast?
Can someone please help me understand the current situation\nregarding SIMMS?\n\nI have a IIsi which I will probably keep for another 2 years.\n\nI would like to add more memory, ie go from 5 MB to 17 MB.\n\nI know that I will need 4 x 4MB, 80ns or faster SIMMS.\n\nWhich SIMMS, 30 pin or 72 pin?\nWould the SIMMS I get today be usable in 2 years with a \nnewer, more powerful system?\n\nAny insight would be appreciated.\n\nThanks.\n\nRob
ith\nork?\n\n\n\n \nSure thing - You'll have to get an FDHD upgrade kit from Apple, which\nincludes a HD floppy drive, 2 different chips (the SWIM chip was mentioned\nin another post) and a different floppy drive cable. Get the Apple kit\nthrough your dealer.
Is there a workaround which will enable me to print to a HPLJ4 from my\nPowerbook 100? (Actually I'm going to a 4M which will have an Ethernet card in\nthe LocalTalk slot!!!GRRRRR). Is there some hardware which will enable me to\nthis easily (kind of plug and play!).

Frankly, I think this model is a screwup.  It does not have PostScriptlevel\n2, only has 13 fonts, and does not even have  fine print or photograde, or\ngrayshare.  Even the 300 model has this!

mile."\n\nRavi,\n\n	Its not a good idea to have a horizontally formatted hard disk in a  \nvertical position.  If the drive is formatted in a horizontal position, it can  \nnot completely compensate for the gravitational pull in a vertical position.   \nI'm not saying that your hard disk will fail tomorrow or 6 months from now, but  \nwhy take that chance?

Hi there,\n\n\nI have a question regarding Quadras VRAM. I have tried to find info on this\nbut I could not get precise answers.\n\nOn one hand, we have a Quadra 950 with a 16" monitor, which is capable of\n32-bit color. How much VRAM does it have?\nOn the other hand, we have a Quadra 800 with a 16" monitor, which is capable\nof 8-bit color only, so it must have 512 Ko of VRAM.\n\nI would like to take VRAM SIMMs for the 950 and put them in the 800 so that\nboth machines have 16-bit color capability.\nIs it possible, and if yes, how many VRAM SIMMs should I take from the 950?\nFrom the documentation I have, the Quadra 800 must get 1 Mo VRAM to have\n16-bit color, is that correct?\n\nBonus question: where do VRAM SIMMs hide? From the 950 documentation, they\nseem to be *behind* the power supply. Do I really have to take off the power\nsupply to access the VRAM SIMMs?\n\n\nThanks for your help!
What phony names? My name is clearly visible in the headers, and I\nsing the post with my account name. If you have a problem with that,\nthen you will have to get over it. I've used this account name for over\n10 years and the people who have been reading newsgroups for the last 7\ngenerally recognize "Hades" as my account name. I have no intention of\nchanging the way I post.\n\n\n    It isn't Apple's responsibility to tell its customers how to fool\naround with it's hardware. That is what Apple Service Techs get paid to\ndo. I personally like the design of the Q800, and applaud Apple for\ncoming up with a good way to make use of the front space for all of\nthose drive bays. I like it a lot better than the 900/950 design, except\nfor those people who need Drive Arrays. I do, however, agree with you\nabout the LW Pro design.\n\n\n    Again, its's not Apple's place to make it easy for non-certified\nservice people to fool around with Apple hardware, even if they did buy\nit. Of course you are free to do what you want to your Mac, just don't\nget upset when your Apple Service Rep tells you that your warranty is no\nlonger valid.\n\n\n    This sounds like the kind of problem I had when I installed 4MB\nSIMMs into an LC, back before low-profile 4MB SIMMs were readily\navailable. The standard 4MB SIMMs would contact the top of the case and\nmake it a bit difficult to close the LC, but it did close and work just\nfine. One of the nice things about Logic-Boards is that they are\ngenerally quite flexible and can withstand a fair amount of pressure.
I have a 512k VRAM chip for sale. Worked fine in my LCII and will give 256\ncolors on 640 x 480 size screen. Asking $50. I'll cover postage.

Readers,\n\nI own a Mac IIsi and am considering upgrades (cards, hard drive, etc).\nCan you tell me what the power limitations are for 1) the PDS slot\nand 2) the hard drive power feed. Secondly, Can you tell me if there\nis a separate limit for each, or if instead, there is a single limit\nfor both combined?\n\nPlease drop me a line if you know the answers to these questions.\nThanks,
I am having trouble with SCSI on a Mac IIfx. The machine is 3 years old\nand I have been using the same hard drive (internal Maxtor LXT-200S) for\ntwo and a half years. The disk recently crashed. I reformatted (Silverlining\n5.42), but during the reformat I received random write errors during testing.\nThe error message reported was like:\n\nSector 0: Write error detected after testing good - sector not mapped out.\n\nThis occurred randomly all over the hard disk (which makes me suspect the\ndiagnostic's reference to Sector 0 ??? ). On the third reformat and after\nreinstalling the SCSI read/write loops I was able to get through passes\n2,3, and 4 with no errors. (Pass 1 for some reason reported a lot of errors,\nbut still mapped out no sectors.) I decided to go ahead and try to resinstall\nSystem 7 and reload my data from a backup. This proceded normally; however,\nI now have sub-optimal performance. Symptoms include:\n\n   o Frequent crashes\n   o Instances of extremely sluggish disk access requiring a reboot to\n       correct.\n   o Instances of not finding the disk on the SCSI chain on reboot.\n       - If I boot from Norton Utl. after this occurs, it cannot find the\n         disk either.\n       - The only thing that fixes this is recycling the power. It sometimes\n         requires several attempts.\n\nQUESTIONS:\n\n   1) Has anyone had this type of problem before?\n   2) Is the problem with the fx motherboard (And its non-standard\n      SCSI implementation) or with my Maxtor Disk? Is there some\n      diagnostic software that would help me make this determination?\n   3) Is it a termination problem? I currently have external Syquest\n      and an external DataFrame XP60 on the chain. The XP60 is at the\n      end, and has internal termination; so I am not using the IIfx\n      terminator. I do have the SCSI filter installed on the internal\n      drive. I have run with this exact steup for 2 1/2 years with\n      one previous disk crash requiring a reformat (about a year ago).\n      I also have symptoms if I disconnect the external devices;\n      so I don't see how SCSI termination would now be an issue. Of\n      course who knows :-<\n\nHelp would be much appreciated.
I just hooked up my Mac IIsi to a relatively old (1 year?) Asante EN/SC\nadapter. The 10Base-T connection works like a charm. I installed the\nnewest drivers from Asante's ftp server.\n\nThe problem begins when I attach one more device to the SCSI chain -\nspecifically a 50MB drive. I power up the drive, then the Mac. The Mac\ntests memory, etc. Just before the "happy Mac face" normally shows up, the\npower light on the EN/SC goes out, and the boot process stops. So I can use\nthe network, or the external drive, but not both at once. This makes the\nAsante box pretty much unusable.\n\nIt doesn't look like a purely electrical SCSI problem, because if I turn\non the drive just a second or so too late, so that it doesn't get noticed\nduring the initial SCSI polling, the Mac boots normally and the adapter\nworks, even though the hard disk is powered on and connected. The Mac has\n*never* once failed to boot from its internal drive up to now (and I've had\nit for over a year).\n\nHere is what I tried: changing the SCSI ID's of the EN/SC and the disk --\nseveral permutations; changing the order of devices, i.e. the EN/SC at the\nhead or tail of the chain; overterminating with an external terminator\n(both devices have internal ones); underterminating, i.e. removing internal\nresistors from the hard disk; trying another EN/SC box; trying another\nidentical drive; trying several different SCSI cables.\n\nHas anybody seen this? More importantly, does anyone have a solution?\nThanks a lot.    E.
The CD300 (external) is already shipping and has been shipping for quite awhile  \nnow.  Demand for the units are high, so they are pretty rare.  I've seen them  \nlisted for around $525-550 at local computer stores and the campus Mac  \nreseller.  I've also heard rumors that they are bundled with a couple of CD's,  \nbut I can't confirm it.
Just wondering if anyone had info/experience with a video/fpu for a mac LC,\njust thinking of adding a second monitor, most likely grayscale.
The PowerBook 170 4/40 with Fax/Data modem is available thru CitiBank's\nCitiDollars catalog for $1995.00 + $19.95 S/H (+ 500 CitiDollars).\n\nThe modem is 2400 bps data, 9600 bps fax (send only).
I think all Powerbooks use the same 2 Meg upgrade, but the\n4 Meg and 6 Meg upgrades are different for the PB100 than\nfor the other PBs.
>With that in mind...\n\nI just recently purchased the GCC BLP Elite and I really like it.  My\nneeds\nare much the same as what you describe.

I've had my Duo 230 for a few weeks now and suffer from both\nof the above problems. I reinstalled my system software twice\nin an effort to combat the problems - thinking they were\nsystem software problems. Initially reinstalling the system\nseemed to help but not anymore. Occasionally when I try to\nwake up the Duo I get a solid screen of horizontal lines on\nthe screen - it freezes.\n\nI also get the high-pitched hiss occasionally - but only at\nstartup.\n\nI've called the apple hotline (800 SOS-APPL) three times\nalready and finally they agreed something is astray after my\nDuo's screen would go dim and the hard drive spun down by\nitselft and put itself to sleep. This problem only occured\ntwice. Apple sent me a box to ship my Duo to be looked at in\nNew York but the problem now is intermittent and I can't\nafford to be without my Duo at this time.\n\nAnyone out there with these same problems?
I have been playing with my Centris 610 for almost a week now.  I must say\nthis machine is really fast!  The hardware turn-on feature is annoying, but\nI got PowerKey from Sophisicated Circuits and it works like a charm.\n\nHowever, I still have a few complaints:\n- when I restart the machine every time, the screen image (the desktop\n  pattern) jerks up and down for a few times.\n- the Quantum 170 drive is noisy\n\nOverall, I highly recommend it:  it is fast, affordable and looks great!\n\n--
The Toshiba has a 200ms access time, the NEC has a 280ms access\ntime, right around the Sony/Apple. Access time is, of course,\nsomewhat important, but not as vital in the case of CDs as data\ntransfer rate.\n\nAll the drives are double-speed drives with maximum data transfer\nrates of 300K/second. Any is a good choice. Apple's is very cheap\nwhen included with new Macs and I agree with Christian's comment\nabout drivers.\n\nPlus, Apple's is bootable on the Centris and Quadra 800. A very nice\nfeature if you need to install System software. I don't know if the\nNEC or Toshiba are bootable on those machines.
To display Millions of colors on a 16" monitor you need 2MB of VRAM\nin the Q950.\n\n\n    Correct. This is the amount of on-board VRAM that the Q800 comes\nwith.\n\n\n    Yes this is possible. Technically, you only need to take out 2 of\nthe VRAM SIMMs but leaving in the other two will not get you anything\nbecause the 950 cannot really do anything with 1.5MB of VRAM. It only\nknows 1MB and 2MB.\n\n\n    Yes, this is correct. You get to 1MB by putting 2 256k VRAM SIMMs\ninto the VRAM SIMM slots on the Q800's motherboard.
Can the internal hard drive of the MacPortable upgraded to larger capacity? What is the specs? A 3-1/2" drive? LPS model?\n\nIs there any third party modem greater than 2400 bps? With FAX option?\n\nP.S. I notice the MacPortable batteries are avalable thru the Apple Catalog.
Question for those familiar with Quadra VRAM:\n\nI put 2 256K VRAM SIMMs in my Quadra 700 (in the 2 slots closest to the\nRAM SIMM slots) and I got no results whatsoever.  I have been told that\nthe built-in video should support at least 16bit and maybe 24bit color on\na Macintosh Color Display.  However, the Monitors control panel still\nlists 8bit (256 colors) as the highest possible.\n\nDoes it make any difference which slots you put the SIMMs in?\nDo you have to do something to activate them?\nDo you have to do something to the Monitors control panel?\n\nBTW, I am running System 7.1 with 8 Megs of RAM.
For a good display, you *must* get an active matrix panel and a *very*\nbright overhead projector designed to be used with an LCD panel (i.e.\nstage must not get too hot). I tried out a Proxima Ovation unit and liked\nit, but I needed a brighter projector (I used it with a 3M 920). It is\nalso too expensive for what you get, IMHO. Prices of active matrix panels\nare rumoured to drop substantially sometime this year (something to do\nwith tarrifs being lifted I think). \n\nIn Canadian dollars, the Proxima Ovation models ranged in price from about\n$5000 to $7000 and a good overhead projector about $1000 to $1500. For\nthat kind of money, you can get a brighter image from a three beam\nprojector, but sacrifice portability.
I just recently bought a 4 MB ram card for my original mac portable \n(backlit) and have since had some bizarre crashes. It happens when I put \nthe machine to sleep and wake the machine up. sometimes it will just \nfreeze the cursor and lock the machine up forcing me to push the reset \nswitch. Other times it will give me the usual bomb box with the error \nmessage of "Co processor not installed". \n\nI know one solution is NOT to put the machine to sleep, but does anyone \nhave any ideas on what could be causing this or better yet what might fix \nit? The memory card is Psuedostatic ram and goes into the PDS Slot. That \nprobably figures into the problem. the manufacturer is King Memory (Not \nkingston) from irvine, CA. They say the problem is in my machine. \n\nAny Ideas? -- Gene Wright.

Because SCSI works well with removable media, and works well with large\ncapacity devices. The floppy interface you suggest handles the former, but\nit doesn't have any hooks for dealing with the latter... you'd have to kludge\nit. Plus, it's extremely low performance. AND, SCSI has gobs of room for\nexpansion compared with a floppy (I can just see it, let's stick a 5.25",\na 3.5", a tape drive, and a MO drive, all on the floppy interface. The\npossibilities for unexpected collisions are enormous).
Any new reports about iisi clock upgrade to 25 mhz,  33 mhz?\nAny failures?
Regarding the post for information about the Mac Portable and the \nPowerbook 100, here are a couple of the answers:\n(1) Does the Mac Portable support Appletalk? Yes\n(2) What CPU is in the Mac Portable? A low power version of the 68000 \nrunning at 15.87 Mhz.\n(3) Does the Mac Portable run system 7? Yes, although it does use up a \nlot of memory.\n(4) Is memory still availabe for the Portable? There are several vendors \nthat still make RAM for the Portable. There are two options: Some vendors \nsell memory that plugs into the RAM Slot inside the portable. Others sell \nmemory that plugs into the Processor Direct Slot. Either way, the most \nmemory you can address is either 8 or 9 megabytes, depending on whether \nthe Portable is Backlit or not. King Memory and Peripherials in Irvine \nCalifornia is the cheapest place I know of for Portable memory. 2MB - \n$140, 4 MB, $250, and 7 MB $415. I still see several ads in macuser that \nare selling 4 MB modules for $450. Wide variety in pricing here.\n(5) What is the internal HD? Its a Conner CP-3045 40 MB HD with an \naverage access time of about 25 ms.\n(6) Is the screen better that the PB 100? Heavens yes! The PB 100 is a \nbacklit PASSIVE matrix screen which means it fades out on you if you move \nyour head a few degrees left or right. The Portable has a backlit or \nnon-backlit ACTIVE Matrix screen which I think is a joy to read.\n\nOther things to consider - Where to get the portable and how much to pay \nfor it? A good supplier has been SelectTerm in Mass. They were willing to \nsell a 2MB Non-backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for about \n$650. Or a 4 MB Backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for \nabout $900. \n\nThe answer is call around for a good while or you'll pay too much.\n\nI'm still looking for an internal FAX modem for the portable? Anybody got \none they want to sell? -- Good Luck, Gene Wright

Radius speculated, publicly, that they could provide a PowerPC-based\nRocket for existing Macs. It would have the plus of RocketShare and\nthe minus of NuBus accelerators - no true boot off the accelerator,\nNuBus bottleneck to video and other I/O.\n\nApple, it seems, will not compete with third parties here -- except\nperhaps for not-yet-available Macs like Cyclone, where a PowerPC\nslot might be advertised. Look for Daystar and such to make PowerPC\naccelerators.\n\nOne potential problem with any accelerator, though, is that it will\nneed a ROM companion and Apple has licensed only Radius, with\nRocketshare, to use any of its proprietary code.\n\nApple is, between the lines, trying to let us know that PowerPC Macs\nwill have simplified logic boards due to the magical nature of RISC\nand that these boards should be much cheaper to build than those in\nexisting 68040 Macs. Perhaps, then, we'll see groundbreaking\nprices in Mac-logic board upgrades, much the same way we've seen\nmuch cheaper high-performance CPUs this year.\n\nFirst generation PowerPCs, 98601s, will also hopefully have socketed\nCPUs so that they'll be chip upgradeable to 98604s a year later.\nThis should be possible in much the same way that 486s can be pulled\nfor clock doublers. If there is too much technical   baggage (which\nI doubt since the external busses are the same size/width) to do\nthis, perhaps we can have CPU daughterboard, a la Powerbook, as\nstandard to facilitate better CPU upgrades. This is an area where\nApple has fallen far behing the Intel-based world. Perhaps catchup\nis in order.\n\nBy the way, last week's PC week had an excellent story on PowerPC,\nPentium, MIPS R4000, DEC Alpha (the big four on the microprocessor\nfront for the forseeable future). Worth reading for technojunkies.\nAlso, the latest PC has a cover story on Pentium. Read it, and all\nthe other stories about how Intel is unstoppable and preeminent\nright now.\n\nOnce anyone is this secure, they are due to fall. Intel's market\nposition will never again be as dominant as it is today (especially\nif AMD gets the go ahead to sell its 486s this week as it appears it\nmight). The competition from all fronts is gearing up for an awesome\nbattle. Apple users should be excited that PowerPC, while not\nguaranteed dominance, is a guaranteed winner, even if its one of\nseveral.
Some kind soul told me that I could change the serial port buffer size\nof Zterm via ResEdit. He did not tell me HOW I could change it using\nResEdit, and I have lost his e-mail address.\n\nCould he or any one else please tell me what to do?\n\nI assume that the relevant resource is zSet, but I do not know, and\nI have no template for that resource. If you have a TMPL for the correct\nresource, I would be grateful to receive it. That way, I could play around\na bit and maybe get my Duo to do something useful with its serial port.\n(other than Appletalk).\n\nBTW, I believe that when the port stats says that maximum in buffer is\n3074 bytes, that that means increasing the buffer will help, if you are\nusing hardware handshaking. I can cram text data pretty fast into my Duo,\nand can monitor that CTS is being lowered, but the buffer never gets beyond\n3074 (out of 4096) bytes. Makes sense to me.
To use the grayscale features, I believe you need a Mac equipped\nwith colour quickdraw. I was told this somewhere or other, but it's\nnot mentioned in "Apple Facts" (guide for apple sellers), in the\npress release or in the technical specs.
We're about ready to take a bold step into the 90s around here by accelerating\nour rather large collection of stock MacPlus computers. Yes indeed, difficult\nto comprehend why anyone would want to accelerate a MacPlus, but that's another\nstory. Suffuce it to say, we can get accelerators easier than new machines.\nHey, I don't make the rules...\n\nAnyway, on to the purpose of this post: I'm looking for info on MacPlus\nacelerators.  So far, I've found some lit on the Novy Accelerator and the\nMicrMac MultiSpeed Accelartor. Both look acceptable, but I would like to hear\nfrom anyone who has tried these.  Also, if someone would recommend another\naccelerator for the MacPlus, I'd like to hear about it.\n\nThanks for any time and effort you expend on this!
I have a Lightening Scan Pro 256 hand scanner.  It came with scanning/editing\nsoftware, OCR software, and some plug-in modules for Photoshop et al.  The\nscanner was a tad on the pricey side ($480), but the scans are incredibly\naccurate, in 256 level, 300 dpi grayscale.  It also has dithered and line art\nsettings when grayscale isn't desired.  Great scanning software, easy to use.  I\nfrequently write letters to my neices, and spontaneouly include a scanned image\nin the note.  Hope this helps!

Here is the story:\nI have a network with 4 Macs on Localtalk. One of them has an\nEthernet Card, and is currently connected to a NeXT (don't laugh\nI got it for the price of a Mac IIsi). The NeXT is connected\nto the internet over SLIP running on a 9600 baud modem.\n\nCurrently, we can telnet from the Mac w/ Ethernet to the NeXT,\nand then telnet out again to the rest of the world.\n\nWhat we want to know is if there is some sort of hardware that\nwill route telnet sessions from the Localtalk Macs to the NeXT\nvia the Ethernet Mac. From what we have heard, AIR doesn't do\nthe trick.\n\nSoftware solutions would be good too, but my impression is that\nthere aren't going to be any.\n\nOur immediate interest is to be able to get to the NeXT and telnet\nout again. The SLIP connection doesn't allow us to assign IP numbers\nto machines, so everyone shares that 1 number...oh well...\n\nthanks in advance.

I've had the board for over a year, and it does work with Diskdoubler,\nbut not with Autodoubler, due to a licensing problem with Stac Technologies,\nthe owners of the board's compression technology. (I'm writing this\nfrom memory; I've lost the reference. Please correct me if I'm wrong.)\n\nUsing the board, I've had problems with file icons being lost, but it's\nhard to say whether it's the board's fault or something else; however,\nif I decompress the troubled file and recompress it without the board,\nthe icon usually reappears. Because of the above mentioned licensing\nproblem, the freeware expansion utility DD Expand will not decompress\na board-compressed file unless you have the board installed.\n\nSince Stac has its own product now, it seems unlikely that the holes\nin Autodoubler/Diskdoubler related to the board will be fixed.\nWhich is sad, and makes me very reluctant to buy Stac's product since\nthey're being so stinky. (But hey, that's competition.)\n--
I really want to buy a powerbook and would like one that can run \nMathematica. So I need a coprocessor but I can not afford a PB180.\n(who can?)  Is it possible to put a MCP in a PB160?

I want to achieve an overall throughput rate of around 5 megabytes / sec\nfor very large data transfers.  (Around 5 MB.)\n\nI have a Quadra 950. \nI have a NuBus network card that can pump data in to mac memory at 8.5 MB/s.\n         (using block-mode transfers)\nI have a high-speed disk array (no asynchronous PB calls) that can\n         achieve 6.8 MB/s.\n\nLet's say all transfers go from disk to buffer to network card.\n\nIt is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer,\nthen transfer all the data from the buffer to card.  (6.8 MB/s then 8.5 MB/s\nresult in an overall 3.8 MB/s.  Too slow!)\n\nSo I tried the following scheme: For an n-megabyte transfer, \n\nStep 1:                                Load the 1st MB from disk to buffer.\nStep 2: Asynch send 1st MB out card,   Load the 2nd MB from disk to buffer.\nStep 3: Asynch send 2nd MB out card,   Load the 3rd MB from disk to buffer.\n        ...\nStep n: Asynch send the n-1 MB out card, Load the nth MB from disk to buffer.\nStep n+1: Send the nth MB out card.\n\nEven though the code apparently does execute the card transfer asynchronously,\nand the card does not use the Mac cpu at all,  (It is using the buffer, tho')\neach of the steps 2 through n take as long as if the two transfers were\nexecuted one after another.  So there is no improvement in the rate.\n\nWhy?\n\nIs the mac RAM dual-port?  (So the NuBus card and the disk driver can both\naccess data at the same time.)\nIs the problem that the two devices, card and disk driver, both have to use\nthe same bus to mac RAM?\n\nIs there anything I can do?
Don't believe the hype. There is no such thing as a PowerPC slot.
Anyone out there have a Sony 1304S?\n\nI have one, and it's very nice, however - If I run it in 16" mode, the\npicture won't\ngo very big. I end up with about 1" gap either side, and .5" top &\nbottom. I suspect\nan internal adjustment would fix this. Anyone tried it?\n\nAnother problem is sub-brightness: Areas that are meant to be black (or\noff the main\nraster) are not very black. The real raster is quite visible when the\nscreen is blanked.\nThis is not too severe, but it is just not as good as other Trini screens\nI have\nused. If I turn the brightness/contrast down so that the raster is not\nvisible, the\nreal image virtually disappears!\n\nThe raster size is just right if I use 1024*768, but 100dpi+ is a bit too\nmuch!\n\nOh, and I am using a RasterOps 24XLi card.\n\n\nThanks\n\nMarcus Bointon\nmarcus@meridian.demon.co.uk\n-------------------------------------------------------\n   Marcus Bointon                   Tel 081 852 6662 \n   marcus@meridian.demon.co.uk      Fax 081 244 5422\n"I used Windows for a week once, but I feel better now"
There is one reason: market size.\n\nThe market size for color quickdraw for accellerated plusses and\nSEs (which don't go beyond 4 MB anyway) is just too small; the\nextra cost would belike $1,000 and with that money, you can buy a\ncolor classic instead.\n\nCheers,\n\n					/ h+\n-- \n -- Jon W{tte, h+@nada.kth.se, Mac Hacker Deluxe --

This model is one of the two low-cost laser printers that Apple just\nintroduced.  I'm thinking of getting one to use at home.  Have any of you\nhad any experience with this printer?   Does it have Level-2 PostScript?\nIf you've bought one, are you happy with it?
It's my understanding that, when you format a magneto-optical disc, (1) the\nformatting software installs a driver on the disc, (2) if you insert the\ndisc in a different drive, then this driver is loaded into the computer's\nmemory and then controls the drive, and (3) if this driver is incompatible\nwith the drive, then the disc can not be mounted and/or properly read/written\nIs that correct?
Does anyone know who makes a cable or adapter that is wired according to\nApple's specs that forces the external output on LC's and the Powerbook's\n160/180 and Duo 230 into a true VGA style output signal? The NEC Adapter does\nnot do this since their monitors are multisync they just route the signal into\nthe correct pinout but do not switch the Macs output into VGA mode.\n\nDo I have to make one of these or does someone already have one made-up??\n\nThe following is the Apple spec for the LC cpu VGA Cable adapter. I'm assuming\nthat the Powerbooks/Duos will work with the same adapter(?);\n\n\nMacintosh LC to VGA\n \nThe Macintosh LC can supply a 640 x 480, VGA timed signal for use with VGA\nmonitors by using an adapter cable.  The standard Macintosh LC supports VGA to\n16 colors, and with the optional 512K VRAM SIMM, the VGA monitor is supported\nto 256 colors.\n \nNote:     The Macintosh LC supplies signals capable of driving TTL level\n          inputs.  However, some low impedance input VGA monitors do not work\n          with the Macintosh LC.\n \nTo connect a Macintosh LC to a VGA monitor, you need to make an adapter cable\nfrom the Macintosh LC video connector to the VGA monitor.  Following is the\npinout description for the adapter cable:\n \nMacintosh LC        VGA\nVideo Connector     Pin     Signal Name\n---------------     ----    -----------\n1                   6       Red ground\n2                   1       Red video signal\n5                   2       Green video signal\n6                   7       Green ground\n9                   3       Blue video signal\n13                  8       Blue ground\n15                  13      /HSYNC\n12                  14      /VSYNC\n14                  10      HSYNC ground\n7,10                nc      SENSE1 & SENSE2 tied together\n \nVGA monitors are identified by shorting pin 7 to pin 10 on the Macintosh LC\nvideo connector.  The Macintosh LC grounds pin 7 on its video connector, which\nresults in pulling down pin 10 and gives the correct monitor ID for a VGA\nmonitor.
Does anyone know how to reach Micron?

The original Mac II had an Apple MMU chip installed which performs a subset\nof the 68851's functions.  If you look underneath your front left floppy\nbay you will find three chips, all approximately the same size.  One will\nbe the 68020, the next the 68881, and the third, approximately the same\nsize, will be the Apple chip.  It is easy to spot because it has a 'hump'\nin the middle of it.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n                         -----------\n                        /           \\n         ---------------             ---------------\n         |                                         |\n         |                                         |\n\nThat and the Apple logo should make it easy to find.
Have you tried the library?\nSince you go to WPI (so do I), go to AK and look on the first floor, a \nprofessor has posted an IEEE (i believe) spec sheet on the 68060 which\nis around 10 pages long.  I'm sure the library has the info you request, It's\njust a matter of finding it.\n\n\nHope this helps,\nBret Chase
Also, if someone would recommend another\n\nTry looking at the Brainstorm Accelerator for the Plus.  I believe it is\nthe best solution because of the performance and price.  Why spend $800\nupgrading a computer that is only worth $300 ????\n  The brainstorm accelerator is around $225.  It speeds up the internal\nclock speed to 16MHz.  That may not seem like much but it also speeds up\nSCSI transfers.  I think that feature is unique to brainstorm.\nCheck it out.
