I think I can. Largely as a result of efforts by people reading this group\nwriting letters and making phone calls the following has happened:\n\n1. NASA reprogrammed funds to keep NASP alive in 1991.\n2. Efforts to kill DC-X and the SSRT progam where twice twarted\n   (Feb. and June of last year).\n3. Gouldin kept his job in spite of heavy lobbying against him.\n\nThis may not be what Mark was thinking of but it shows that the\nreaders of sci.space DO have power and influence.\n\n  Allen
Background: The Orion spacedrive was a theoretical concept.  It\nwould be a drive using thermonuclear explosions to drive a spacecraft.\nThe idea was that you'd detonate devices with somewhere from one to\nten megatons yield behind a "pusher plate" attached to the main\nspacecraft.  The shock wave from the explosions would transfer\nmomentum to the ship.\n\n  Now, in an atmosphere I can see this.  The energy of the explosion\nheats the atmosphere, which expands explosively and slams a shock wave\ninto the pusher plate.  But in a vacuum, only two things I can see are\ngoing to hit the plate: fission/fusion products (barium, krypton,\nhelium, neutrons, evaporated bomb casing) and electromagnetic\nradiation (gammas mostly, some light/heat from irradiated fission\nproducts).\n\n  Would this work?  I can't see the EM radiation impelling very much\nmomentum (especially given the mass of the pusher plate), and it seems\nto me you're going to get more momentum transfer throwing the bombs\nout the back of the ship than you get from detonating them once\nthey're there.\n\n  I must be missing something.  Would someone enlighten me via email?\n\n  Thanks.\n\n-- \n	--Jim

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE           Contact:  OASIS (310) 364-2290\n\n   15 April 1993                                Los Angeles, CA\n\n     LOCAL NATIONAL SPACE SOCIETY CHAPTERS SPONSOR TALK BY L.A.\n  ADVOCATE OF LUNAR POWER SYSTEM AS ENERGY SOURCE FOR THE WORLD\n\n   On April 21, the OASIS and Ventura County chapters of the National \nSpace Society will sponsor a talk by Lunar Power System (LPS) co-\ninventor and vice-president of the LPS Coalition, Dr. Robert D.\nWaldron.  It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell Science\nCenter in Thousand Oaks, CA.\n\n   Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space\nMaterials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell\nInternational in Downey, California.  He is a recognized world\nauthority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written or\ncoauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial\nmaterials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. David\nCriswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.\n\n   Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal\nexperts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build\nthe Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with a\npotential to power the globe.\n\n   For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half\nfrom California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific\nconcept of a solar power system based on the Moon.\n\n   The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar\nsurface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted\nthrough orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormous\nsource of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth's ever\nincreasing demand using proven, basic technology.\n\n   OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Space\nIndustrialization) is the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the\nNational Space Society, which is an international non-profit\norganization that promotes development of the space frontier.\nThe Ventura County chapter is based in Oxnard, CA.\n\n       WHERE:  Rockwell Science Center Auditorium, 1049 Camino\n               Dos Rios, Thousand Oaks, CA.
Well, pardon me for trying to continue the discussion rather than just\ntugging my forelock in dismay at having not considered actually trying\nto recover the energy from this process (which is at least trying to\ngo the 'right' way on the energy curve).  Now, where *did* I put those\nsackcloth and ashes?\n\n[I was not and am not 'pretending' anything; I am *so* pleased you are\nnot surprised, though.]\n\n\nNote that I didn't say it was perpetual motion, or even that it\nsounded like perpetual motion; the phrase was "sounds almost like\nperpetual motion", which I, at least, consider a somewhat different\npropposition than the one you elect to criticize.  Perhaps I should\nbeg your pardon for being *too* precise in my use of language?\n\n\nI will believe that this process comes even close to approaching\ntechnological and economic feasibility (given the mixed nature of the\ntrash that will have to be run through it as opposed to the costs of\nseparating things first and having a different 'run' for each\nactinide) when I see them dump a few tons in one end and pull\n(relatively) clean material out the other.  Once the costs,\ntechnological risks, etc., are taken into account I still class this\none with the idea of throwing waste into the sun.  Sure, it's possible\nand the physics are well understood, but is it really a reasonable\napproach? \n\nAnd I still wonder at what sort of 'burning' rate you could get with\nsomething like this, as opposed to what kind of energy you would\nreally recover as opposed to what it would cost to build and power\nwith and without the energy recovery.  Are we talking ounces, pounds,\nor tons (grams, kilograms, or metric tons, for you SI fans) of\nmaterial and are we talking days, weeks, months, or years (days,\nweeks, months or years, for you SI fans -- hmmm, still using a\nnon-decimated time scale, I see  ;-))?\n\n\n-- \n"Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live\n in the real world."   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden
Announce that a reward of $1 billion would go to the first corporation \n   who successfully keeps at least 1 person alive on the moon for a\n   year. \n\nAnd with $1B on offer, the problem of "keeping them alive" is highly\nlikely to involve more than just the lunar environment! \n\n"Oh Dear, my freighter just landed on the roof of ACME's base and they\nall died.

And $1b is probably far too small a\nreward to encourage what would be a very expensive and high risk\nproposition.)

The gravity maneuvering that was used was to exploit 'fuzzy regions'.  These\nare described by the inventor as exploiting the second-order perturbations in a\nthree body system.  The probe was launched into this region for the\nearth-moon-sun system, where the perturbations affected it in such a way as to\nallow it to go into lunar orbit without large expenditures of fuel to slow\ndown. The idea is that 'natural objects sometimes get captured without\nexpending fuel, we'll just find the trajectory that makes it possible". The\noriginator of the technique said that NASA wasn't interested, but that Japan\nwas because their probe was small and couldn't hold a lot of fuel for\ndeceleration.\n\n	This from an issue of 'Science News' or 'The Planetary Report' I\nbelieve, about 2 months ago(?).
Here are some recent observations taken by the Hubble Space Telescope:\n\n     o The Faint Object Spectrograph (FOS) was used to make ultraviolet\n       observations of both the planet Pluto, and its moon Charon. The\n       peakups were successful. The observations were executed as\n       scheduled, and no problems were reported.\n\n     o Observations were made using the High Speed Photometer of the Planet\n       Uranus during an occultation by a faint star in Capricornus. These\n       observations will help in our understanding of the planet's\n       atmospheric radiative and dynamical processes. This event occurred\n       close to the last quarter moon, and special arrangements had to be\n       made to modify the lunar limit tests to allow these observations.\n       The observations are currently being reviewed, and all the\n       observations looked okay.

Well, first you work out how much cold gas you need, then make the\ntanks big enough.\n\nWorking out how much cold gas is another problem, depending on\nvehicle configuration, flight duration, thruster Isp (which couples\ninto storage pressure, which may be a factor in selecting tank\nwall thickness etc.)
Let's see. These aren't, in a strict sense, amateur rockets. That term\ndenotes rockets, the engines of which are constructed by the user. The\nrockets you describe are called HPR, or high power rockets, to\ndistinguish them from (smaller) model rockets. They use factory-made\nammonium perchlorate composite propellants in phenolic plastic engines\nwith graphite nozzles. The engines are classified by impulse. A "D"\nengine, for example, can have no more than 20 newton-seconds of impulse.\nAn "F" engine can have no more than 40 ns. Each letter corresponds to a\ndoubling of the maximum impulse. So far, engines up to size "O" are\navailable pretty much off the shelf. Engines of size H and above are\nshipped as Class B explosives, and as such are controlled. Engines of\nsize F and below are shipped as Class C explosives, and are not as\ncontrolled. Class F engines, BTW, are not HPR engines, but model rocket\nengines. (Class G engines go in and out of legal limbo.)\n\nThere is an HPR Society, The Tripoli Rocket Society, I believe, which\nholds events at various sites throughout the year, with all legalities\n(FAA waiver included) taken care of. The National Association of\nRocketry is more concerned with engines below H, though it is involved\nin HPR as well. These societies certify users of HPR rockets, and\ncompanies will not sell to uncertified individuals.\n\nBottom Line: It's legit. I suggest you send for a catalog - but forget\nthe dynamite, will ya?

I was at an interesting seminar at work (UK's R.A.L. Space Science\nDept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale Solar Sail\nproposed as a student space project. The guy giving the talk was keen to\ngenerate interest in the project. I'll typein the handout he gave out at\nthe meeting. Here goes : \n\n			The Microlight Solar Sail\n			-------------------------\n\n1. Introduction\nThe solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure of\nsunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such a\nvehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.\n\nHowever it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most\npeople realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per\nsquare kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized\nfabric which would be necessary to transport a 'conventional' type\nspacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hte\nidea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.\n\n2.Design\nRecent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: a\ntiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely\nbe electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude control\nmethods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a\npanel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.\n\nThe key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at\nEdinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data\ngathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and\ncommunication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface\nof the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost of\nthe mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.\n\n3.Missions\nThe craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example:\na) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor\ngroups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit\nrate.\nb) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobserved\nareas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail to\nreflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receive\nsunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm that\nvolatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these\nlocations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar\nbase, BTW]\nc) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet\nnucleus. Impacting at low speed, a thin wire probe attached to the craft\ncauses it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edged\ntube, like performing a biopsy. Returning to Earth, the sail acts as an\nideal re-entry parachute: load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensures that heat\nis reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300\ndeg C. The material sample is recovered, enclosed in a small insulating\ncontainer.\n\nContact: Colin Jack                              Tel. 0865-200447\nOxford Mathematical Designs, 131 High Street, Oxford OX1 4DH, England\n\n--------------------------------\n\nThis guy would love to hear from anyone interested in this project or\nseeking details or anything, and would be most happy to send you more\ninformation.\n\n	Andy\n\n\n\n--
Can someone please remind me who said a well known quotation? \n\nHe was sitting atop a rocket awaiting liftoff and afterwards, in answer to\nthe question what he had been thinking about, said (approximately) "half a\nmillion components, each has to work perfectly, each supplied by the lowest\nbidder....." \n\nAttribution and correction of the quote would be much appreciated.

Sounds liek what the FED has to do is sign a 50 or more year lease to use\ncertain parts of a space station that is built and designed and such by a\ncommerical company or consortium of companies (such as like Alyeska) for a\nsmall amount of rent in return for certain incentives and such.. Such as tax\nand other right off and also a monopoly on certain products.. The commerical\nbuilders would have certain perks given to them to make there end easier (taxes\n, contracts, regulatory concesions and such..)\n\nIs it workable, just might work..\n\nAfter all, if China can lease out Hong Kong and the people of Hong Kong can\nmake money, this could work..

Hi,\n  \n  I'm writing a science fiction script and I'm looking for some\nanswers to questions regarding the Moon and Earth. My starting point\nis an impossible situation.  [I checked with a professor at berkeley\nand his response was a VERY helpful "can't happen".] If you enjoy\nplaying with unusual ideas and are willing answer some questions\nplease contact me via e-mail (jennise@dgi.com).\n\n  I get extremely annoyed when screen and tele-plays ignore basic\nfacts about computers that I'm determined to be as scientifically\naccurate as I can.\n\n\n  Sorry for being vague, but I'd like to protect my idea as much as I\ncan until I'm ready to sell it (hopefully).
Nope, you're confusing separate programs.  Atlas was the first-generation\nUS ICBM; Titan I was the second-generation one; Titan II, which all the\nTitan launchers are based on, was the third-generation heavy ICBM.  There\nwas essentially nothing in common between these three programs.\n\n(Yes, *three* programs.  Despite the similarity of names, Titan I and\nTitan II were completely different missiles.  They didn't even use the\nsame fuels, never mind the same launch facilities.)

The CU people have been, and continue to be big ozone scientists. So \nthis is consistent. It is also consistent with the new "Comercial \napplications" that NASA and Clinton are pushing so hard. \n\nDid anyone catch the rocket that was launched with a movie advert \nall over it? I think the rocket people got alot of $$ for painting \nup the sides with the movie stuff. What about the Coke/Pepsi thing \na few years back? NASA has been trying to find ways to get other \npeople into the space funding business for some time. Frankly, I've \nthought about trying it too. When the funding gets tight, only the \ninnovative get funded. One of the things NASA is big on is co-funding. \nIf a PI can show co-funding for any proposal, that proposal has a SIGNIFICANTLY\nhigher probability of being funded than a proposal with more merit but no \nco-funding. Once again, money talks!
Hmmmm....  The prefix "peri-" is Greek, not Latin, so it's usually used\nwith the Greek form of the name of the body being orbited.  (That's why\nit's "perihelion" rather than "perisol", "perigee" rather than "periterr",\nand "pericynthion" rather than "perilune".)  So for Jupiter I'd expect it\nto be something like "perizeon".)   :^)
Actually, the "ether" stuff sounded a fair bit like a bizzare,\nqualitative corruption of general relativity.  nothing to do with\nthe old-fashioned, ether, though.  maybe somebody could loan him\na GR text at a low level.\n\ndidn't get much further than that, tho.... whew.
How about transferring control to a non-profit organisation that is\nable to accept donations to keep craft operational.
Any lunar satellite needs fuel to do regular orbit corrections, and when\nits fuel runs out it will crash within months.  The orbits of the Apollo\nmotherships changed noticeably during lunar missions lasting only a few\ndays.  It is *possible* that there are stable orbits here and there --\nthe Moon's gravitational field is poorly mapped -- but we know of none.\n\nPerturbations from Sun and Earth are relatively minor issues at low\naltitudes.  The big problem is that the Moon's own gravitational field\nis quite lumpy due to the irregular distribution of mass within the Moon.

Better idea for use of NASA Shuttle Astronauts and Crew is have them be found\nlost in space after a accident with a worm hole or other space/time glitch..\n\nMaybe age Jemison a few years (makeup and such) and have her as the only\nsurvivour of a failed shuttle mission that got lost.. \n\nHeh of late, they way they have been having shuttle problems in the media,\nanything can happen.. \n\nImagine a Astronaut/Crew member to find themselves in the 24th Century as the\nobject of interest of an alien civilization, maybe rescued or helped by the ST\nEnterprise...  I know Vegr and such was okay, but this could be better..
I think if there is to be a prize and such.. There should be "classes"\nsuch as the following:\n\nLarge Corp.\nSmall Corp/Company (based on reported earnings?)\nLarge Government (GNP and such)\nSmall Governemtn (or political clout or GNP?)\nLarge Organization (Planetary Society? and such?)\nSmall Organization (Alot of small orgs..)\n\nThe organization things would probably have to be non-profit or liek ??\n\nOf course this means the prize might go up. Larger get more or ??\nBasically make the prize (total purse) $6 billion, divided amngst the class\nwinners..\nMore fair?\n\nThere would have to be a seperate organization set up to monitor the events,\numpire and such and watch for safety violations (or maybe not, if peopel want\nto risk thier own lives let them do it?).
This is ok in my opinion as long as the stuff *returns to earth*.\n\n\nIf this turns out to be true, it's time to get seriously active in\nterrorism. This is unbelievable! Who do those people think they are,\nselling every bit that promises to make money? I guess we really\ndeserve being wiped out by uv radiation, folks. "Stupidity wins". I\nguess that's true, and if only by pure numbers.\n\n	Another depressed planetary citizen,\n	hoover
The problem with Commercial Titan is that MM has made little or no attempt\nto market it.  They're basically happy with their government business and\ndon't want to have to learn how to sell commercially.\n\nA secondary problem is that it is a bit big.  They'd need to go after\nmulti-satellite launches, a la Ariane, and that complicates the marketing\ntask quite significantly.\n\nThey also had some problems with launch facilities at just the wrong time\nto get them started properly.  If memory serves, the pad used for the Mars\nObserver launch had just come out of heavy refurbishment work that had\nprevented launches from it for a year or so.\n\nThere have been a few CT launches.  Mars Observer was one of them.  So\nwas that stranded Intelsat, and at least one of its brothers that reached\norbit properly.
Depends. If you assume the existance of a working SSTO like DC, on billion\n$$ would be enough to put about a quarter million pounds of stuff on the\nmoon. If some of that mass went to send equipment to make LOX for the\ntransfer vehicle, you could send a lot more. Either way, its a lot\nmore than needed.\n\nThis prize isn't big enough to warrent developing a SSTO, but it is\nenough to do it if the vehicle exists.\n\n  Allen

[Excellent discussion of DC-X landing techniques by Henry deleted]\n\n\nThe DC-X will not take of horizontally.  It takes of vertically. \n\n\nFor several reasons.  Vertical landings don't require miles of runway and limit\nnoise pollution.  They don't require wheels or wings.  Just turn on the engines\nand touch down.  Of course, as Henry pointed out, vetical landings aren't quite\nthat simple.\n\n\nWell, to be blunt, yes.  But at least you're learning.\n\n\nThe Soyuz vehicles use parachutes for the descent and then fire small rockets\njust before they hit the ground.  Parachutes are, however, not especially\npractical if you want to reuse something without much effort.  The landings\nare also not very comfortable.  However, in the words of Georgy Grechko,\n"I prefer to have bruises, not to sink."

The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE\n    archive in SPACE/FAQ/manifest. The portion of his manifest formerly\n    included in this FAQ has been removed; please refer to his posting or\n    the archived copy. For the most up to date information on upcoming\n    missions, call (407) 867-INFO (867-4636) at Kennedy Space Center.\n\n    Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news\n    frequently.\n\n\n    WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?\n\n    The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks\n    (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).\n\n    The "Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual," ASC G&C 2102,\n\n	"During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is\n	commanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower\n	clearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)\n	orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a\n	negative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other\n	advantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort\n	maneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of\n	the horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining\n	downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target\n	in second stage."\n\n    This really is a good answer, but it's couched in NASA jargon. I'll try\n    to interpret.\n\n    1)	We wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.\n\n    2)	Then, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack\n	between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the\n	"relative wind") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line\n	between the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly\n	negative angle ("a negative q-alpha").	This causes a little bit of\n	"downward" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z\n	direction) and this force "alleviates structural loading."\n	We have to be careful about those wings -- they're about the\n	most "delicate" part of the vehicle.\n\n    3)	The new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more\n	mass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or\n	to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be\n	the case if we didn't roll ("performance gain").\n\n    4)	The new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated\n	flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort\n	maneuvers, the Return To Launch Site ("decreased abort maneuver\n	complexity").\n\n    5)	The new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio\n	antennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio\n	antennae on the Orbiter ("improved S-band look angles").\n\n    6)	The new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a\n	helpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.\n\n    7)	The new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is\n	more nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east\n	(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity\n	in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:\n	velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.\n	The Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its\n	velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.\n\n    This all begs the question, "Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give\n    this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to\n    achieve that attitude?"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers\n    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one\n    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main\n    Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime\n    launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is\n    fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the "top"\n    [Orbiter side] and the "bottom" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The\n    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented\n    basically the same way they were for the Saturn V's.  (A side note: the\n    Saturn V's also had a roll program.  Don't ask me why -- I'm a Shuttle\n    guy.)\n\n    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.	He added that the "roll\n    maneuver" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.\n    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons\n    stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping\n    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw\n    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total\n    maneuver is really expressed as a "quaternion," a grad-level-math\n    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element\n    array.\n\n\n    HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT\n\n    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite\n    dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72\n    degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed\n    over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from\n    California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.\n    shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite\n    for these viewers.\n\n    If you can't get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.\n    It's worth asking if yours doesn't.\n\n    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is\n    frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press\n    conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle\n    missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying\n    much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions\n    are not being covered.\n\n\n    AMATEUR RADIO FREQUENCIES FOR SHUTTLE MISSIONS\n\n    The following are believed to rebroadcast space shuttle mission audio:\n\n	W6FXN  - Los Angeles\n	K6MF   - Ames Research Center, Mountain View, California\n	WA3NAN - Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Greenbelt, Maryland.\n	W5RRR  - Johnson Space Center (JSC), Houston, Texas\n	W6VIO  - Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, California.\n	W1AW Voice Bulletins\n\n	Station    VHF	   10m	   15m	   20m	  40m	 80m\n	------	 ------  ------  ------  ------  -----	-----\n	W6FXN	 145.46\n	K6MF	 145.585			 7.165	3.840\n	WA3NAN	 147.45  28.650  21.395  14.295  7.185	3.860\n	W5RRR	 146.64  28.400  21.350  14.280  7.227	3.850\n	W6VIO	 224.04		 21.340  14.270\n	W6VIO	 224.04		 21.280  14.282  7.165	3.840\n	W1AW		 28.590  21.390  14.290  7.290	3.990\n\n    W5RRR transmits mission audio on 146.64, a special event station on the\n    other frequencies supplying Keplerian Elements and mission information.\n\n    W1AW also transmits on 147.555, 18.160.

dillon comments that Space Food Sticks may have bad digestive properties.\n\nI don't think so.

I haven't seen any speculation about it. But, the Salyut KB (Design Bureau) \nwas planning a new LH/LOX second stage for the Proton which would boost\npayload to LEO from about 21000 to 31500 kg. (Geostationary goes from\n2600 kg. (Gals launcher version) to 6000 kg.. This scheme was competing\nwith the Energia-M last year and I haven't heard which won, except now\nI recently read that the Central Specialized KB was working on the \nsuccessor to the Soyuz booster which must be the Energia-M. So the early\nresults are Energia-M won, but this is a guess, nothing is very clear in \nRussia. I'm sure if Salyut KB gets funds from someone they will continue \ntheir development. \n\nThe Centaur for the Altas is about 3 meters dia. and the Proton \nis 4 so that's a good fit for their existing upper stage, the Block-D\nwhich sets inside a shround just under 4 meters dia. I don't know about\nlaunch loads, etc.. but since the Centaur survives Titan launches which\nare probably worse than the Proton (those Titan SRB's probably shake things\nup pretty good) it seems feasible. EXCEPT, the Centaur is a very fragile\nthing and may require integration on the pad which is not available now.\nProtons are assembled and transported horizontially. Does anyone know \nhow much stress in the way of a payload a Centaur could support while\nbolted to a Proton horizontally and then taken down the rail road track\nand erected on the pad?  \n\nThey would also need LOX and LH facilities added to the Proton pads \n(unless the new Proton second stage is actually built), and of course\nany Centaur support systems and facilities, no doubt imported from the\nUS at great cost. These systems may viloate US law so there are political\nproblems to solve in addition to the instabilities in the CIS you mention.

That was certainly partially the case with Apollo,\n   but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing\n   military, scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than\n   just a "we have the money, why not?" approach.\n\nAh, but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is not\nwasted on the moon. It's not like they'd be using $1000 (1000R?) bills\nto fuel their moon-dozers. The money to fund a lunar base would be\nspent in the country to which the base belonged. It's a way of funding\nhigh-tech research, just like DARPA was a good excuse to fund various\nfields of research, under the pretense that it was crucial to the\ndefense of the country, or like ESPRIT is a good excuse for the EC to\nfund research, under the pretense that it's good for pan-European\ncooperation.\n\nNow maybe you think that government-funded research is a waste of\nmoney (in fact, I'm pretty sure you do), but it does count as\ninvestment spending, which does boost the economy (and just look at\nthe size of that multiplier :->).
Of course; sorry for the misunderstanding.  I was referring to the fact\nthat far more aeronautical development took place in the '30's.  For much\nof the '20's, the super-abundance of Jennies and OX-5 engines held down the\nindustry.  By 1926, many of the obsolete WWI aircraft had been retired\nand Whirlwind had their power/weight ratio and reliability up to the point\nwhere long-distance flights became practical.  It's important to note that\nthe Atlantic was flown not once but THREE times in 1927:  Lindbergh,\nChamberlin and Levine, and Byrd's _America_.  "When it's time to railroad,\nyou railroad."\n\n\n  Not off the top of my head; I'll have to dig out my reference books again.\nHowever, I will say that the most common arrangement in Prince Henry the\nNavigator's Portugal was for the prince to put up part of the money and\nmerchants to put up the rest.  They profits from the voyage would then be\nshared.\n\n\n  The problem is that the amount of prize money required to inspire a\nMoon Base is much larger than any but a handful of individuals or corporations\ncan even consider putting up.  The Kremer Prizes (human powered aircraft),\nOrteig's prize, Lord Northcliffe's prize for crossing the Atlantic (won in\n1919 by Alcock and Brown) were MUCH smaller.  The technologies required were\nwithin the reach of individual inventors, and the prize amounts were well\nwithin the reach of a large number of wealthy individuals.  I think that only\na gov't could afford to set up a $1B+ prize for any purpose whatsoever.\n  Note that Burt Rutan suggested that NASP could be built most cheaply by\ntaking out an ad in AvWeek stating that the first company to build a plane\nthat could take off and fly the profile would be handed $3B, no questions\nasked.
Piper lived in my town (Williamsport, PA) when he killed himself.  It\nwas in the early '60's.  He had had more than a few books published by\nthat time, but he was down on his luck financially.  Rumor was that he\nwas hunting urban pigeons with birdshot for food.  He viewed himself as\na resourceful man, and (IMO) decided to check out gracefully if he\ncouldn't support himself.  The worst part is that John Campbell, the\nlong-time editor of Astounding/Analog SF magazine had cut a check for\nPiper's most recent story, and said check was in the mail.  If Campbell\nhad known Piper's straits, I'm sure he would have phoned to say hang on.\nCampbell was like that.\n\nI wish it had happened differently.  I always enjoyed Piper's stuff.
Hmm.  $1 billion, lesse... I can probably launch 100 tons to LEO at\n$200 million, in five years, which gives about 20 tons to the lunar\nsurface one-way.  Say five tons of that is a return vehicle and its\nfuel, a bigger Mercury or something (might get that as low as two\ntons), leaving fifteen tons for a one-man habitat and a year's supplies?\nGee, with that sort of mass margins I can build the systems off\nthe shelf for about another hundred million tops.  That leaves\nabout $700 million profit.  I like this idea 8-)  Let's see\nif you guys can push someone to make it happen 8-) 8-)\n\n[slightly seriously]
But Allen, if you can assume the existence of an SSTO there is no need\nto have the contest in the first place.

TRIAD, the first drag-free satellite, was designed and built by the \nJohns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory and launched 2 Sept 1972.  The \nsatellite was in three sections separated by two booms.  The central section \nhoused the DISCOS Disturbance Compensation System, which consisted of a proof \nmass of special non-magnetic alloy housed within a spherical cavity.  The \nproof mass flew a true gravitational orbit, free from drag and radiation \npressure.  Teflon microthrusters kept the body of the satellite centered \naround the proof mass, thereby flying the entire satellite drag free.\n\n     TRIAD was one of the APL-designed Navy Navigation Satellites.  The \n2nd-generation operational navigation satellites flying today (NOVA) use a \nsingle-axis version of DISCOS.  TRIAD was also the sixth APL satellite to be \npowered by an RTG (APL flew the first nuclear power supply in space, in 1961).\n\n     Further info on TRIAD, DISCOS, etc. can be found in "Spacecraft Design \nInnovations in the APL Space Department," Johns Hopkins APL Technical Digest, \nVol. 13, No. 1 (1992).

[...]\n\nHow ironic.
No.  The idea was suggested around here during discussions of possible\nnear-term commercial space activities.  One of the folks involved in those\ndiscussions, a\nspacecraft engineer named Preston Carter, passed the suggestion on to \nsome entreprenurial types, and Mike Lawson is apparently going ahead with\nit.  Preston is now at LLNL, and is working with Space Marketing on \nthe sensors that might be carried.\n\nActually, that sounds unlikely.  I don't know what the launch vehicle\nwould be, but I would expect it to go on a commercial launcher --\ncertainly not on the Shuttle -- and the fraction of the cost paid to NASA\nfor, e.g.,  launch support would probably \ncover NASA's incremental costs pretty well.\n\n\nNo, as noted, LLNL is involved in lightweight sensor design, per \nClementine and related programs.  I'm sure folks around here would like to \nsee a demonstration of a modern inflatable structure, but after all, \nthe U.S. did the Echo satellites long ago, and an advertising structure\nwould not be much closer to an inflatable space station than Echo was\n(or a parade balloon, for that matter).\n\nWhile I happen to personally dislike the idea, mostly because I've got\na background in astronomy, it's hardly vandalism -- it would be a short-lived\nintrusion on the night sky, doing no permanent damage and actually hurting\nonly a small subset of astronomers.  On the other hand, it would certainly\ndraw attention to space.   \n\nWhich, unfortunately, this is not likely to contribute much to.\n\n\nAs far as I know, it's a purely commercial venture.\n\nI gather it is being very seriously discussed with possible advertisers.\nCommercial projects, however, generally don't get "funding" -- they\nget "customers" -- whether it will have customers remains to be seen.\n\nNahh.

This is turning into 'what's a moonbase good for', and I ought\nnot to post when I've a hundred some odd posts to go, but I would\nthink that the real reason to have a moon base is economic.\n\nSince someone with space industry will presumeably have a much\nlarger GNP than they would _without_ space industry, eventually,\nthey will simply be able to afford more stuff.
A related question (which I haven't given that much serious thought \nto): at what lattitude is the average length of the day (averaged \nover the whole year) maximized? Is this function a constant=\n12 hours? Is it truly symmetric about the equator? Or is\nthere some discrepancy due to the fact that the orbit is elliptic\n(or maybe the difference is enough to change the temperature and\nmake the seasons in the southern hemisphere more bitter, but\nis far too small to make a sizeable difference in daylight\nhours)?\n\nI want to know where to move.

Forwarded from Doug Griffith, Magellan Project Manager\n\n                     MAGELLAN STATUS REPORT\n                         April 23, 1993\n\n1.  The Magellan spacecraft continues to operate normally, gathering\ngravity data to plot the density variations of Venus in the\nmid-latitudes.  The solar panel offpoint was returned to zero degrees\nand spacecraft temperatures dropped 2-3 degrees C.\n\n2.  An end-to-end test of the Delayed Aerobraking Data readout\nprocess was conducted this week in preparation for the Transition\nExperiment.  There was some difficulty locking up to the data frames,\nand engineers are presently checking whether the problem was in\nequipment at the tracking station.\n\n3.  Magellan has completed 7277 orbits of Venus and is now 32 days\nfrom the end of Cycle 4 and the start of the Transition Experiment.\n\n4.  Magellan scientists were participating in the Brown-Vernadsky\nMicrosymposium at Brown University in Providence, RI, this week.  This\njoint meeting of U.S. and Russian Venus researchers has been\ncontinuing for many years.
I posted this over in sci.astro, but it didn't make it here.\nThought you all would like my wonderful pithy commentary :-)\n\nWhat? You guys have never seen the Goodyear blimp polluting\nthe daytime and nightime skies?\n\nActually an oribital sign would only be visible near\nsunset and sunrise, I believe.  So pollution at night\nwould be minimal.\n\nIf it pays for space travel, go for it.  Those who don't\nlike spatial billboards can then head for the pristine\nenvironment of Jupiter's moons :-)
For the purpose of a contest, I'd bet some things could be cut.  Like fuel\nfor re-entry, any kind of heat shielding, etc., etc.  Even still, if the\ncontest participants had to fund DC-1 development, it probably wouldn't be\nworth it to develop DC-1 (just for the contest).  Just give me the cheapest\nheaviest lift man rated (or at least under 6 or so Gs) booster...  If I\ndon't have to pay for DC-1 development, great!, I'll use it.\n\nBut back to the contest goals, there was a recent article in AW&ST about a\nlow cost (it's all relative...) manned return to the moon.  A General\nDynamics scheme involving a Titan IV & Shuttle to lift a Centaur upper\nstage, LEV, and crew capsule.  The mission consists of delivering two\nunmanned payloads to the lunar surface, followed by a manned mission. \nTotal cost:  US was $10-$13 billion.  Joint ESA(?)/NASA project was $6-$9\nbillion for the US share.\n\nI didn't find a mention of how long the crew could stay, but I'd bet that\nits  around 30 days.  And the total payload delivered was about 30 metric\ntonnes.  So if you ignore the scientific payload, hitch a ride in the crew\nhabitation module (no return trip...), and toss in a few more tonnes for\nthe additional consumables to last another 11 months, then you *might* be\nable to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes (and in case its not obvious,\nthat's a wild ass guess).  A pretty boring visit, since every trip outdoors\neats up a bit of LOX.  And I'm not certain if a home brewed (or\ncollege-brewed) life support system could last a year.  But let's round\nthis up to 19.4 tonnes (convient, since the GD plan talks about 9.7 ton\npayloads delivered to the lunar surface.  This adds up to two Centaurs, two\nLEVs, two Shuttle flights... All to put a single man on the moon for a\nyear.   Hmmm.  Not really practical.  Anyone got a cheaper/better way of\ndelivering 15-20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade?  Anyone\nhave a more precise guess about how much a year's supply of consumables and\nequipment would weigh?\n\nAnd I was wondering about the GD LEV.  Is it reusable?  Or is it discarded\nto burn up on return to LEO?  If its not discarded, could it be refueled? \nHenry: Do you know anything about the GD LEV?  I noted that it uses RL-10\nengines.  Aren't they reusable/restartable?  Would a LEV fit in a DC-1? \nI've forgotten (if I ever knew) what the cargo bay dimensions are for the\nDC-1.\n\nAll in all, I'm not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on the\nmoon for a year is wise and/or useful.  How about:  A prize for the first\nnon-government sponsered unmanned moon landing, then another for a manned\nmoon landing, then yet another for a system to extract consumables from\nlunar soil, another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle, and so forth.  Find\nsome way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure...  Having a single goal\nmight result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appeared\nto win.  And for those that didn't give up, I find something a little scary\nabout a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters.  I'd\nlike to see as much a reward for co-operation as for competition.\n\nLastly, about ten or fifteen years back I seem to recall that there was an\nEnglish space magazine that had an on-going discussion about moonbases on\nthe cheap.  I recalled it discussed things like how much heat the human\nbody produced, how much lunar material it'd need for protection from solar\nflares, etc.  Unfortunately I don't remember the name of this magazine. \nDoes this ring a bell to anyone?
I attended a colloquium at Goddard last fall where the head of the \noperations section of NASA was talking about what future missions\nwere going to be funded.  I don't remember his name or title off hand\nand I have discarded the colloquia announcement. In any case, he was \nasked about that very matter: "Why can't we spend a few million more\nto keep instruments that we already have in place going?"\n\nHis responce was that there are only so many $ available to him and\nthe lead time on an instrument like a COBE, Magellan, Hubble, etc\nis 5-10 years minumum.  If he spent all that could be spent on using\ncurrent instruments in the current budget enviroment he would have\nvery little to nothing for future projects.  If he did that, sure\nin the short run the science would be wonderful and he would be popular,\nhowever starting a few years after he had retired he would become\none of the greatest villans ever seen in the space community for not\nfunding the early stages of the next generation of instruments.  Just\nas he had benefited from his predicessor's funding choices, he owed it\nto whoever his sucessor would eventually be to keep developing new\nmissions, even at the expense of cutting off some instruments before\nthe last drop of possible science has been wrung out of them.

It was a test of the first reusable tool.\n\n\nPointy so they can find them or so they will stick into their pants better, and\nbe closer to their brains?
I was reading Popular Science this morning and was surprised by an ad in\nthe back.  I know that a lot of the ads in the back of PS are fringe\nscience or questionablely legal, but this one really grabbed my attention.\nIt was from a company name "Personal Missle, Inc." or something like that.\n\nAnyhow, the ad stated that they'd sell rockets that were up to 20' in length\nand engines of sizes "F" to "M".  They also said that some rockets will\nreach 50,000 feet.\n\nNow, aside from the obvious dangers to any amateur rocketeer using one\nof these beasts, isn't this illegal?  I can't imagine the FAA allowing\npeople to shoot rockets up through the flight levels of passenger planes.\nNot to even mention the problem of locating a rocket when it comes down.\n\nAnd no, I'm not going to even think of buying one.  I'm not that crazy.\n\n\n-Paul "mine'll do 50,000 feet and carries 50 pounds of dynamite" Dokas
INteresting question about Galileo.\n\nGalileo's HGA  is stuck.   \n\nThe HGA was left closed,  because galileo  had a venus flyby.\n\nIf the HGA were pointed att he sun,  near venus,  it would\ncook the foci elements.\n\nquestion:  WHy couldn't Galileo's  course manuevers have been\ndesigned such that the HGA  did not ever do a sun point.?\n\nAfter all,  it would normally be aimed at earth anyway?\n\nor would it be that an emergency situation i.e. spacecraft safing\nand seek might have caused an HGA sun point?
+\n+I love the idea of an inflatable 1-mile long sign.... It will be a\n+really neat thing to see it explode when a bolt  (or even better, a\n+Westford Needle!) comes crashing into it at 10 clicks a sec.  \n+\nPageos and two Echo balloons were inflated with a substance\nwhich expanded in vacuum. Once inflated the substance was no longer\nneeded since there is nothing to cause the balloon to collapse.\nThis inflatable structure could suffer multiple holes with no \ndisastrous deflation.
Glad to see Griffin is spending his time on engineering rather than on\nritual purification of the language.  Pity he got stuck with the turkey\nrather than one of the sensible options.

----- News saved at 23 Apr 93 22:22:40 GMT\n  \n\n\n\nWell, I'm working on it, but getting a little impatient. So far, \nI've made it through Egyptian, Chinese, and Greek cultures, and\nup through the Rennaisance. But so far, these insights just don't \nseem to be gelling. Perhaps it's in an appendix somewhere.
Lot's of these small miners  are no longer miners.  THey are people living\nrent free on Federal land,  under the claim of being a miner.  The facts are\nmany of these people do not sustaint heir income from mining,  do not\noften even live their full time,  and do fotentimes do a fair bit\nof environmental damage.\n\nThese minign statutes were created inthe 1830's-1870's  when the west was\nuninhabited  and were designed to bring people into the frontier.  Times change\npeople change.  DEAL.  you don't have a constitutional right to live off\nthe same industry forever.  Anyone who claims the have a right to their\njob in particular,  is spouting nonsense.   THis has been a long term\nfederal welfare program,  that has outlived it's usefulness.
Press Release No.19-93\nParis, 22 April 1993\n\nUsers of ESA's Olympus satellite report on the outcome of\ntheir experiments\n\n"Today Europe's space telecommunications sector would not\nbe blossoming as it now does, had OLYMPUS not provided\na testbed for the technologies and services of the 1990s". This\nsummarises the general conclusions of 135 speakers and 300\nparticipants at the Conference on Olympus Utilisation held in\nSeville on 20-22-April 1993. The conference was organised by\nthe European Space Agency (ESA) and the Spanish Centre for\nthe Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI).\n\nOLYMPUS has been particularly useful :\n-      in bringing satellite telecommunications to thousands of\n       new users, thanks to satellite terminals with very small\n       antennas (VSATs). OLYMPUS experiments have tested\n       data transmission, videoconferencing, business television,\n       distance teaching and rural telephony, to give but a few\n       examples.\n\n-      in opening the door to new telecommunications services\n       which could not be accommodated on the crowded lower-\n       frequency bands; OLYMPUS was the first satellite over\n       Europe to offer capacity in the 20/30 GHz band.\n\n-      in establishing two-way data relay links  OLYMPUS\n       received for the first time in Europe, over several months,\n       high-volume data from a low-Earth orbiting spacecraft and\n       then distributed it to various centres in Europe.\n\nWhen OLYMPUS was launched on 12 July 1989 it was the\nworld's largest telecommunications satellite; and no other\nsatellite has yet equalled its versatility in combining four\ndifferent payloads in a wide variety of frequency bands.\n\nOLYMPUS users range from individual experimenters to some\nof the world's largest businesses. Access to the satellite is\ngiven in order to test new telecommunications techniques or\nservices; over the past four years some 200 companies and\norganisations made use of this opportunity, as well as over\n100 members of the EUROSTEP distance-learning\norganisation.\n\n\n\nAs the new technologies and services tested by these\nOLYMPUS users enter the commercial market, they then\nmake use of operational satellites such as those of\nEUTELSAT.
SSF is up for redesign again.  Let's do it right this\ntime!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:\n\n[1] microgravity/vacuum process research\n[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)\n[3] spacecraft maintenence \n\nThe old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to\ncentralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet\ntheir targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users \ntook most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to \ntie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization\nand miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these\ntwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement\nin commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial \nusers have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the \nconstellation.  \n\nFirstly, different functions are broken down into different \nconstellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:\nthus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,\ncomsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task\nis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,\nproviding for redundancy and full coverage where needed.\n\nSSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments\nand are also prime candidates for constellization.\n\n[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:\nCOMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for\nshort-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is\ninexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities \non Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab\nto a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.\nWe might also expand the research program to take advantage of \ninteresting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt \nor gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can\nbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a \nstation is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.\n\n[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,\nbut also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation\nenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelter\nof LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since\nastronauts will have little practical use in the space program\nuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using\nastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,\nand the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation\ntether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity\nin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the\nradiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,\nEarth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support\nmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR\ninterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,\nfollow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,\ntesting out the actual environment at low cost before $billions\nare spent on astronauts.\n\n[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in \nClarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated\nrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can\npractice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck\nsolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,\ninject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be\nspun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat\ncompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.\n\nBy applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting\nrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we\nhave radically improved the capability of the program while\ngreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,\nwe can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study\nlife's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety \nof space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum\nresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose\norbits.\n\nN.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration\nas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  \nMars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously \nwe can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used\nto fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and\nsample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can\nbe used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology\ngreenhouses on Mars at low cost.
They exist.  Even photosynthetic varieties.  Not economical at this\ntime, though.
I love the idea of progressive developmental prizes, but the assumption\nhas\nbeen all along that only the U.S. Gummint could fund the prizes.  It\nwouldn't and couldn't do such a thing ... BUT ...\n\nAn eccentric billionaire COULD offer such a prize or series of prizes.\n\nAnyone know H. Ross Perot or Bill Gates personally?
The General Chairman is Paul Bialla, who is some official of General\nDynamics.\n\nThe emphasis seems to be on a scaled-down, fast plan to put *people*\non the Moon in an impoverished spaceflight-funding climate. You'd\nthink it would be a golden opportunity to do lots of precusor work for\nmodest money using an agressive series of robot spacecraft, but\nthere's not a hint of this in the brochure.\n\n\nYou're not hanging out with the Right People, apparently.
Hi all,\n\nI really thought that by now I would have seen something\nabout this, but I haven't, so here goes:  Last night on\nthe evening news, the anchorperson said something to the\neffect that one of the SSRBs that was recovered after the\nrecent space shuttle launch was found to have a wrench of\nsome sort rattling around apparently inside the case.  There\nwas no elaboration as to where specfically the item was\nfound, of what type of wrench it was, but the anchorperson\ndid say something about a NASA official commenting that\nthere would be an inquiry into how the thing got in the SSRB.\n\nHas anybody else on the net whose info sources may be \nbetter than mine heard anything about this?  It seems rather\nweird.

(818) 354-5011\n\nContact:  Mary A. Hardin\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              April 15, 1993\n#1506\n\n     Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory report the\nsuccessful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed to\nmeasure and study chemicals in the Earth's ozone layer.\n\n     The April 3 flight from California's Barstow/Daggett Airport\nreached an altitude of 37 kilometers (121,000 feet) and took\nmeasurements as part of a program established to correlate data\nwith the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).  \n\n     The data from the balloon flight will also be compared to\nreadings from the Atmospheric Trace Molecular Spectroscopy\n(ATMOS) experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttle\nDiscovery.\n\n     "We launch these balloons several times a year as part of an\nongoing ozone research program.  In fact, JPL is actively\ninvolved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three\nimportant ways," said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator on\nthe balloon research campaign.  \n\n     "There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite," he\ncontinued.  "The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists,\nand the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truth\nfor those activities, as well as data that is useful in its own\nright."\n\n     The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more\npieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically the\nmid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring. \nUnderstanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps\nscientists construct more accurate computer models which are\ninstrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.\n\n     The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPL\ninstruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures\nozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere;\na submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave\nradiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fourier\ntransform infrared interferometer which monitors how the\natmosphere absorbs sunlight. \n\n     Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three-\nhour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130\nkilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to ground\nstations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m.\nPacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commanded\nto separate from the balloon.\n\n     "We needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared\nmeasurements," Margitan explained, "and we also needed to fly in\ndarkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear."\n\n     It will be several weeks before scientists will have the\ncompleted results of their experiments.  They will then forward\ntheir data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard Space\nFlight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARS\nscientists.    \n\n     The balloon was launched by the National Scientific Balloon\nFacility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under a\ncontract from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon was\nlaunched in California because of the west-to-east wind direction\nand the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.\n\n     The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less than\none-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubic\nmeters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with\nhelium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  The balloons weigh\nbetween 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).  The\nscientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) pounds\nand is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.\n\n     The JPL balloon research is sponsored by NASA's Upper\nAtmosphere Research Program and the UARS Correlative Measurements\nProgram.
They aren't going to leave a loophole as glaring as space mining.  Quite a\nfew of those people are, when you come right down to it, basically against\nindustrial civilization.  They won't stop with shutting down the mines here;\nthat is only a means to an end for them now.\n\nThe worst thing you can say to a true revolutionary is that his revolution\nis unnecessary, that the problems can be corrected without radical change.\nTelling people that paradise can be attained without the revolution is\ntreason of the vilest kind.\n\nTrying to harness these people to support spaceflight is like trying to\nharness a buffalo to pull your plough.  He's got plenty of muscle, all\nright, but the furrow will go where he wants, not where you want.

When I was at the Texas Star Party a few years ago, the sky was so dark\nthat Venus did, indeed, cause light pollution until it set.\n\nEven if the billboard were dark it could cause a problem.  Imagine observing an\nobject and halfway through your run, your object was occulted!\n\nI would guess that most of the people stating positive opinions are not \nfanatically serious observers.\n\nIt is so typical that the rights of the minority are extinguished by the\nwants of the majority, no matter how ridiculous those wants might be.\n \nGeorge Krumins\n--
Has anyone heard of or Played Buzz Aldrin's Race into Space?\n\nDoes anyone know when it is expected to be released...?
Unfortunately, things have been boding ill (is that a legitimate conjugation?)\nfor a while.  While the Office of Exploration had some great ideas, they never\ngot much money.  I've heard good things about Griffin, but it's hard to want\nhim back in a job where he couldn't do anything.\n\n\nThe group examining the Freedom-based space station redesign proposals is \nheaded by Michael Griffin, "NASA's cheif engineer" in the words of Space News.\nI believe this is him.
I would just like to point out that it is much easier to place an\nobject at orbital altitude than it is to place it with orbital\nvelocity.  For a target 300 km above the surface of Earth,\nyou need a delta-v of 2.5 km/s.  Assuming that rockets with specific\nimpulses of 300 seconds are easy to produce, a rocket with a dry\nweight of 50 kg would require only about 65 kg of fuel+oxidizer.\nA small dispersal charge embedded in about 20 kg of sand or\nbirdshot (depending on the nature of the structure) would be\nthe payload.  I am sure the whole project is well within\nthe capability of the amateur rocketry community.\n\nIt sounds like a good Science Fair project--'Reduction\nof Light Pollution Through Applied Ballistics'.\nOr, it could be part of the Challenge Prize being discussed\nhere: $1 billion for the first person to spend 1 year\non the moon, $1 million for the first erradication of\nan orbital eyesore/CCD burner.  I wouldpledge $1000\nfor the first person to bring it down, and I am sure\nthere are at least 999 other astronomers, nature lovers,\nor just plain people of good taste who would do likewise.\n\nOf course, a  Gerald Bull solution might be simpler.\n(Either the solution Gerald Bull would apply--the use\nof a large caliber gun; or the solution which was applied\nto Gerald Bull--the use of a small caliber gun.)
Where does the shadow come from?  There's nothing close enough to block\nsunlight from hitting them.  I wouldn't expect there to be anything block\nour view of them either.  What am I missing?
Joint Press release ESA/UN No 18-93\nParis, 19 April 1993\n\nUN/ESA joint training course on satellite applications\nto be held in Italy, 19-30 April\n\nThe United Nations and the European Space Agency (ESA)\nare jointly organising a training course on the applications of\nsatellite data gathered by the European Remote Sensing\nSatellite (ERS-1), to be held in Frascati, Italy, from 19 to 30\nApril. The training course will discuss the applications of\nsatellite data concerning natural resources, renewable energy\nand the environment.\n\nThe training course, organised for the benefit of francophone\nAfrican experts, will be hosted by ESRIN, the European Space\nAgency's establishment in Frascati, which is responsible for\ncoordination with the users of data from ESA's remote sensing\nsatellite. Twenty-four experts in the field of remote sensing,\nselected from 19 francophone countries from northern, western\nand central Africa, and three regional African centres, will\nattend the two-week session. The course will focus on remote\nsensing techniques and data applications, particularly ERS-1\ndata.\n\nThe ERS-1 satellite, developed by ESA and launched in 1991\nwith the European Ariane launcher, carries an advanced radar\ninstrument and is the first in a series of radar remote sensing\nmissions that will ensure availability of data beyond the year\n2000. The aim of the training course is to increase the\npotential of experts using the practical applications of radar\nremote sensing systems to natural resources, renewable energy\nand the environment, with particular emphasis on applications\nto geology and mineral prospecting, oceanography and near-\ncoastal areas, agriculture, forestry and meteorology.\n\nThe education and practical training programme was\ndeveloped jointly by the United Nations and ESA. The\nfacilities and the technical support, as well as lecturers and\ninformation documents for the training course, will be\nprovided by the Agency. Lecturers at the training course will\ninclude high-level experts from other European and African\norganisations active in remote sensing applications. Funds for\nthe training course are being provided by the United Nations\n\n\n\nTrust Fund for New and Renewable Sources of Energy; the\nprimary contributor to that Fund is the Government of Italy.
Good thing i stuck in a couple of question marks up there.\n\nI seem to recall, somebody built  or at least proposed a wasp waisetd\nPassenger civil transport.  I thought it was a 727,  but maybe it\nwas a DC- 8,9???   Sure it had a funny passenger compartment,\nbut on the other hand  it seemed to save fuel.\n\nI thought Area rules  applied even before transonic speeds,  just\nnot as badly.
Or have different classes of competetors.. and made the total purse $6billion\nor $7billion (depending on how many different classes there are, as in auto\nracing/motocycle racing and such)..
>Very cost effective if you use the right accounting method :-)\n\n   Sherzer Methodology!!!!!!\n\nHell, yes. I'm not going to let a bunch of seven suits tell\nme what the right way to estimate cost effectiveness is, at\nleast not until they can make their mind up long enough\nto leave their scheme stable for a fiscal year or two.\n\n\nSeriously though. If you were to ask the British government\nwhether their colonisation efforts in the Americas were cost\neffective, what answer do you think you'd get? What if you asked\nin 1765, 1815, 1865, 1915 and 1945 respectively? ;-)
There was a Science fiction movie sometime ago (I do not remember its \nname) about a planet in the same orbit of Earth but hidden behind the \nSun so it could never be visible from Earth. Turns out that that planet \nwas the exact mirror image of Earth and all its inhabitants looked like \nthe Earthings with the difference that their organs was in the opposite \nside like the heart was in the right side instead in the left and they \nwould shake hands with the left hand and so on...\n\n C.O.EGALON@LARC.NASA.GOV\n\nC.O.Egalon@larc.nasa.gov
Called "gas".\n\n\nThe balloons were in sufficiently low orbit that they experienced\nsome air resistance.  When they were finally punctured, this \npreasure (and the internal preasure that was needed to maintain\na spherical shape against this resistance) caused them to\ncatastrophically deflated.  The large silvered shards\nthat remained were easily visible for some time before\nreentry, though no longer useful as a passive transponder.

You're assuming that the low-cost delivery system has to be a separate\nproject.  But why?  If you are spending hundreds of millions of dollars\nin hopes of winning a billion-dollar prize, it is *cheaper* to develop\nyour own launch system, charging its entire development cost against\nyour contest entry, than to try to do it with existing launchers.  No\nother demand is necessary.\n\n\nYou're assuming that it's going to take a decade to build a new launch\nsystem.  But why?  The Saturn V took less than six years, depending on\nexactly when you date its start.  Pegasus took about three from project\nstart to first flight.  Before SDIO chickened out on orbital development,\nthe target date for an orbital DC-Y flight was 1996.  If you really want\nspeed, consider that the first prototypes of the Thor missile (still in\nservice as the core of the Delta launcher) shipped to the USAF less\nthan 18 months after the development go-ahead.
Many of you at this point have seen a copy of the \nLunar Resources Data Purchase Act by now. This bill, also known as the Back to \nthe Moon bill, would authorize the U.S. \ngovernment to purchase lunar science data from private \nand non-profit vendors, selected on the basis of competitive bidding, with an \naggregate cap on bid awards of $65 million. \n        If you have a copy of the bill, and can't or don't want to go through \nall of the legalese contained in all Federal legislation,don't both - you have \na free resource to evaluate the bill for you. Your local congressional office, \nlisted in the phone book,is staffed by people who can forward a copy of the\nbill to legal experts. Simply ask them to do so, and to consider supporting\nthe Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act. \n        If you do get feedback, negative or positive, from your congressional \noffice, please forward it to: David Anderman\n3136 E. Yorba Linda Blvd., Apt G-14, Fullerton, CA 92631,\nor via E-Mail to: David.Anderman@ofa123.fidonet.org. \n        Another resource is your local chapter of the National Space Society. \nMembers of the chapter will be happy to work with you to evaluate and support \nthe Back to the Moon bill. For the address and telephone number of the nearest \nchapter to you, please send E-mail, or check the latest issue of Ad Astra, in \na library near you.\n        Finally, if you have requested, and not received, information about\nthe Back to the Moon bill, please re-send your request. The database for the\nbill was recently corrupted, and some information was lost. The authors of the \nbill thank you for your patience.
There has been something bothering me while watching\nNASA Select for a while.  Well, I should'nt say\nbothering, maybe wondering would be better.  When\nthey are going to launch they say (sorry but I forget\nexactly who is saying what, OTC to PLT I think)\n"Clear caution & warning memory.  Verify no unexpected\nerrors. ...".  I am wondering what an "expected error" might\nbe.  Sorry if this is a really dumb question, but\ninquiring minds just gotta know............
You're assuming that "go solar" = "photovoltaic".  Solar dynamic power\n(turbo-alternators) doesn't have this problem.  It also has rather less\nair drag due to its higher efficiency, which is a non-trivial win for big\nsolar plants at low altitude.\n\nNow, you might have to replace the *rest* of the electronics fairly often,\nunless you invest substantial amounts of mass in shielding.\n\n\nReferences?  Such treaties have been *proposed*, but as far as I know,\nnone of them has ever been negotiated or signed.
Actually, that is no longer true. In the last few years Congress has\nammended laws to provide whatever is needed. Note that both Spacehab\nand Comet are funded this way.\n\nThe problems aren't legal nor technical. The problem is NASA's culture.\n\n  Allen
Comet P/Helin-Roman-Crockett also spent some time as a temporary\nsatellite to Jupiter a few years ago if you believe the calculations\nby Tancredi, G., Lindgren, M. and  Rickman, H.(Astron. Astrophys., \n239, pp. 375-380, 1990).\n-- \n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------
I once read an article on  Computer technology  which stated that \nevery new computer technology was actually lower and slower then what it\nreplaced.  Silicon was less  effective then the germanium  products\nthen available.   GaAs  was less capable then Silicon.  Multi-processors\nwere slower then  existent single processors.\n\nWhat the argument was, though was that these new technologies promised either\ntheoretically future higher performance  or lower cost or higher densities.\n\nI think that the DC-1  may g=fit into this same model.\n\nELV's can certainly launch more weight  then  a SSRT,  but \nan SSRT offers the prospect of  greater cycle times and  lower costs.\n\nThis is kind of a speculative posting,  but I thought i'd throw it out as\na hjistorical framework  for those interested in the project.
As for advertising -- sure, why not?  A NASA friend and I spent one\n   drunken night figuring out just exactly how much gold mylar we'd need\n   to put the golden arches of a certain American fast food organization\n   on the face of the Moon.  Fortunately, we sobered up in the morning.\n\nHmmm. It actually isn't all that much, is it? Like about 2 million\nkm^2 (if you think that sounds like a lot, it's only a few tens of m^2\nper burger that said organization sold last year). You'd be best off\nwith a reflective substance that could be sprayed thinly by an\nunmanned craft in lunar orbit (or, rather, a large set of such craft).\nIf you can get a reasonable albedo it would be visible even at new\nmoon (since the moon itself is quite dark), and _bright_ at full moon.\nYou might have to abandon the colour, though.\n\nBuy a cheap launch system, design reusable moon -> lunar orbit\nunmanned spraying craft, build 50 said craft, establish a lunar base\nto extract TiO2 (say: for colour you'd be better off with a sulphur\ncompound, I suppose) and some sort of propellant, and Bob's your\nuncle.  I'll do it for, say, 20 billion dollars (plus changes of\nidentity for me and all my loved ones). Delivery date 2010.\n\nCan we get the fast-food chain bidding against the fizzy-drink\nvendors? Who else might be interested?\n\nWould they buy it, given that it's a _lot_ more expensive, and not\nmuch more impressive, than putting a large set of several-km\ninflatable billboards in LEO (or in GEO, visible 24 hours from your\nkey growth market). I'll do _that_ for only $5bn (and the changes of\nidentity).
Hmmm. I seem to recall that the attraction of solid state record-\nplayers and radios in the 1960s wasn't better performance but lower\nper-unit cost than vacuum-tube systems.\n\n	Mind you, my father was a vacuum-tube fan in the 60s (Switched\nto solid-state in the mid-seventies and then abruptly died; no doubt\nthere's a lesson in that) and his account could have been biased.
Well, I guess I'm left wondering just who all the 'light fascists'\nthink *they* are.  Yes, I understand the issues.  I don't even\nparticularly care for the idea.  But am I the only one that finds the\nsort of overreaction above just a *little* questionable?  You must\nfind things like the Moon *really* obnoxious in their pollution.\n\nA few questions for those frothing at the mouth to ask themselves:\n\n	1) How long is this thing supposed to stay up?  Sounds like it\nwould have a *huge* drag area, not a lot of mass, and be in a fairly\nlow orbit.\n\n	2) Just what orbital parameters are we talking about here?\nWhat real impact are we talking about, really?  How many optical\nastronomers are *really* going to be impacted?\n\n	3) Which is more important; adding a few extra days of\n'seeing' for (very few) optical astronomers or getting the data the\nsensors are supposed to return along with the data for large\ninflatables (and the potential there for an inflatable space station)?\nThe choice would seem to be one or the other, since the advertising is\nbeing used to help fund this thing.\n\n	4) If your answer to 3) above was "the astronomers", then feel\nfree to come up with some other way to fund the (to my mind) more\nimportant research data that would be gained by this WITHOUT SPENDING\nANY MORE OF MY MONEY TO DO IT.  In other words, put up or shut up.\n\n\nProbably so.  I'm just not sure we agree about who the 'stupid' are. \n\n\nYeah, me too.\n\n-- \n"Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live\n in the real world."   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden

Speech by Pete Worden\n                                    \n          Delivered Before the U.S. Space Foundation Conference\n                                    \n                       Colorado Springs, Colorado\n                                    \n                             April 15, 1993\n\n\n     What a delightful opportunity to cause some trouble.  For\nproviding me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S.\nSpace Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket\nTechnology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How to\nlower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind --\nand I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for\nour generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.\n\n     Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of a\ntorch from one technical generation to another.  It is a new\nthing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things\nfrom past masters.\n\n     When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so called\nexperts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no\nsense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of\nthe Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it,\n"defies the best principles of launching payloads into space." \nWell Dr. Rachtin -- you've made us mad!  What are these\nprinciples that SSRT defies?\n\n     Well I'll tell you.  It violates the principle that you need\na giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the\n"fact" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it\nviolates the truism that you cant do anything significant for\nless than many billions of dollars.\n\n     It took some of the last generation's experts to teach us\nsome new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun's first rocket was not a\nSaturn V.  General Schriever's ICBM's didn't take ten years to\ndemonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn't cost $1 billion.\n\n     It took one of the great engineers of the 1950's to remind\nus of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was a\nsenior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better,\ncheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a\nsingle stage reusable space launch system since the 1960's. \nBecause he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a\nlittle, Test a little.\n\n     Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We\ndidn't solicit a bunch of requirements -- they'd just change\nevery few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The\nALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better\nknown as "Shape Shifter" than "Space Lifter."  We didn't spend a\nlot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When's the\nlast time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn't\ntake a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in\n18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted of\none very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the\nthreat that he'd get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if\nit ran over cost or schedule.\n\n     As I described what SSRT is -- and isn't keep in mind its\nonly a first step.  There are several more steps -- and steps\nthat can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  But\neach step should follow the same principles -- a small management\nteam -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest\nbudget.\n\n     Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve:\n(See charts)\n\n     I'm embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last\ngeneration -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950's\nand 1960's.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope that\ncan't see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we\ncould do is soft-land on Earth!\n\n     But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a\nlittle, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable\nand routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers among\nyou -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermal\nprotection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land\nhorizontally, etc, etc.\n\n     I say to you -- we'll see you at White Sands in June.  You\nbring your view-graphs, and I'll bring my rocketship.  If we do\nwhat we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.  [ not\nincluded in the speech:  If we fail -- you still have your\nprogram offices, staff summary sheets, requirement analyses, and\ndecade long programs.]
Todays New York TImes just wrote about a pact being negotiated \nbetween us and the Russians  to develope  High Temperature\nGas Cooled Fission Reactors using Re-Cycled Weapons Grade plutonium\nfrom Warhead stockpiles.   THe fuel will be pelletized in ceramic\nfor safety,  and then after depletion will be sufficiently\ncontaminated with by-products to make extraction of the remaining\nplutonium hazardous enough to deter re-use.\n\nApparently the project will be led by General Atomics of San Diego\nwith funding from the US GOvernment.  THe pilot plant will be built\nand operated by the russians.
Sorry, _perijoves_...I'm not used to talking this language.
Forwarded from John Spencer (spencer@lowell.edu):\n\nThere will be two eclipses of Iapetus by Saturn and its\nrings, in May and July.  Please spread the word!  Here's some\ninformation about the events, and then a couple of messages from Jay\nGoguen of JPL appealing for thermal observations of the eclipse to\nlearn more about the thermal properties of Iapetus.  He might also have\nsome money available...\n\nJohn Spencer, 1993/04/21\n\nIapetus will be eclipsed by the shadows of Saturn's rings and Saturn\nitself on 1993/05/01-02 (18:27-13:43 UT) and again on 1993/07/20-21,\n(21:16-09:38 UT).  Timing is as follows;\n\n     1993 May 1-2\n\n        A-ring ingress  18:27\n               egress   19:30\n        B-ring ingress  19:51\n               egress   21:42\n        C-ring egress   23:00\n        Saturn ingress  23:59\n               egress   10:02\n        B-ring ingress  10:28\n               egress   12:19\n        A-ring ingress  12:40\n               egress   13:43\n\n     1993 July 20-21\n\n        Saturn ingress  21:16\n               egress   05:08\n        A-ring ingress  05:13  (grazing)\n               egress   09:38\n\nTimes could be 30 minutes later according to an alternate ephemeris,\nand photometric observations are important for refining Iapetus'\norbit.  Because the Sun's size projected on the rings as seen from\nIapetus is 3100 km it's unlikely that we will learn anything new about\nthe rings themselves from the observations.  See Soma (1992), Astronomy\nand Astrophysics 265, L21-L24 for more details.  Thanks to Andy Odell\nof Northern Arizona University for bringing the events to my\nattention.\n\nTHERMAL OBSERVATIONS?\n\n\n  To me, the interesting thing to do would be thermal IR of the 20 July\n  disappearance into the shadow of the planet to measure thermal inertia,\n  etc.  Unfortunately, the 21:30 UT of this event renders it inaccessible,\n  except from Russia.  Even from Calar Alto, Saturn is rising through 3\n  airmasses at 23:00 UT.  Do you know anyone in Russia or Ukraine with\n  a big telescope and 10 um instrumentation that's looking for something\n  to do?  I'd be willing to make a personal grant of >$100 for the data.\n\n  Jay\n\nand again:\n\n  please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetus planet\n  disappearance to do so at thermal wavelengths.  My impression would\n  be that it's not an easy observation.  Iapetus will be faint and\n  getting fainter in eclipse, so you'll need a big telescope that's a\n  good IR telescope and reasonable 10 - 20 um instrumentation.  I don't\n  think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are\n  well placed for observation.  We need SOFIA for this one.  One\n  possibility would be the IR telescope in India, but it's only a 1.2 m.\n\njay
With the continuin talk about the "End of the Space Age" and complaints \nby government over the large cost, why not try something I read about \nthat might just work.\n\nAnnounce that a reward of $1 billion would go to the first corporation \nwho successfully keeps at least 1 person alive on the moon for a year. \nThen you'd see some of the inexpensive but not popular technologies begin \nto be developed. THere'd be a different kind of space race then!
> Why Paul, it's obvious.\n   > Once chlorine chemistry has been banned on Earth,\n   > as is being advocated by some groups, Ti prices will\n\n   > :-) :-) :-) \n\n   Well, there already is a sulfate process for TiO2 purification.  The\n   chlorine process is cleaner, however, and for that reason is achieving\n   dominance in the marketplace.\n\nDarn, caught by the white hot heat of technological progress again...\n\n   Most Ti is used in pigment, btw (as the oxide), where it replaced\n   white lead pigment some decades ago.  Very little is reduced to the\n   metal.\n\nSpoilsport. Hence the need for increasing fashion\nemphasis on anodise Ti jewelry...\n\n   > Seriously, I'd say there is a flaw in Gary's analysis\n   > in that he assumes an export oriented economy, maybe\n   > the lunatics will just want some native Ti for local\n   > use...\n\n   Which merely evades the issue of why those lunatics are\n   there at all (and, why their children would want to stay.)\n\nI did not evade the issue at all. I clearly stated that\nthis would be from diabolical foresight in establishing\na sheltered industrial base for the upcoming Great War ;-)\nVery cost effective if you use the right accounting method :-)
Careful.  Making statements about how solid state is (generally) more\nreliable than analog will get you a nasty follow-up from Tommy Mac or\nPat.  Wait a minute; you *are* Pat.  Pleased to see that you're not\nsuffering from the bugaboos of a small mind.  ;-)\n\n-- \n"Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live\n in the real world."   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden

ETHER IMPLODES 2 EARTH CORE, IS GRAVITY!!!\n\n  This paper BOTH describes how heavenly bodys can be stationary, \nether sucking structures, AND why we observe "orbital" motion!!\n\n  Ether, the theoretical propogation media of electro-magnetic \nwaves, was concluded not to exist, based on the results of the \nMichelson-Moreley experiment conducted a century ago. \n\n  I propose that those conclusions are flawed, based on the fact \nthat the experiment was designed to look for a flow parallel to the \nearth's surface, not perpindicular. (Due to the prevailing assumption \nthat the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind)\n\n  The reversal of the that conclusion, a pivotal keystone in the \ndevelopment of modern scientific thought, could have ramifications \nof BIBLICAL proportions through out the WORLD!!\n\n  REMEMBER: Einstien said Imagination is greater than knowledge!!\n\n  \n1\n  I dream like this: ether based reality\n \n  The ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality. Creations \nstart as a lattice placed into the ether. Given a spin, the lattices\nboth drag the fluid, like a margarita blender, and ingest it, \nconverting it, distilling localized mass, time and energy. \n(non-spinning lattice = "dark matter")\n\n  The earth isn't exactly spinning, around the sun. Picture an image \nof a galaxy; we haven't any videos of them spinning. Picture us \nbeing stationary, and the sun's image being dragged across the sky by \nthe spinning ether field. (Picture an onion, each layer of which is \nspinning a little faster than the next. A thread shot at the inner \nkernel would be stretched diagonally sideways, its head being in a \nfaster shell than its tail, until it finally intersected the ground \nof the inner kernel, its direction vector being straight down, but \nits "foot print" being a line, not a point. [sunrise, sunset])\n  \n  The moon isn't exactly orbiting us. It is a parasite, (non self \nspin sustaining ) being dragged in the earth's ether field, which is \nitself in the sun's much more powerful field. Our seasons are the \nwobble of earth's axis, like a top slowing down. The "orbit" of the\nearth around the sun is all of the stars' images being dragged around\nby the sun's ether feild.\n\n  The earth, moon and sun are about the same size and "distance" \napart. Its just that the time between them varies greatly, because \nthe "path" is not the same. The moon's lattice in the ether is like \nsticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half \nturn. The sun's lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has \ngot the whole plate of noodles wound up. The piece of light going to \nthe moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a "j" hook at \nthe end. The piece of light going to the sun has to go around the \nwhole plate, like a needle in a record, before it gets there. \n\n  With a pencil, compass, and rule, draw a diagram of how the moon \ncan be about as big as "earth's" shadow upon it, and at other times \ntotally eclipse the sun. Look in the sky. except for your Knowledge, \nwould you guess that they are about the same size, just because they \nlook about the same size?\n\n   O .     - -                 E     O   O   O   S\n E       /     \            \n    M    |      |      OR                M    \n         \ _ _ /                         \n       S                           \n       \n  The full moon, quarter moon etc. is the difference between rate\nof ether spins. What we are looking at is a rotating "turntable view" \nof the moon, only half of which is facing the sun. ( I've seen a \nhalf moon within about 120 degrees (of sky) of the sun, during the \nday. Try and draw that "earth shadow.") Its only the moon's image \nwhich appears to orbit us. No matter where it is, the light part is \nthe part facing the sun, and the dark part is the half facing away \nfrom the sun, even when it appears to be behind us.\n\n  "Light-Years" between galaxies is a misnomer. The distance is \ncloser to zero, as time and matter are characteristics of this phase \nof reality, which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion. \n(defining edge = 0 ether spin) What we are seeing could be \nessentially happening now. The "piece" of light may have experienced \nmany years, but the trip could be very quick, our time.\n\n  To time travel or warp space I might consider learning to \nde-spin myself. (phase out my mass) Good luck trying to design \na propulsion system to drag around a space-time locality. (its like \ntrying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within)\n\n  To find out about all of this, I recommend studying history. I'd \nlook in the book of life. (or holy grail etc.) Brain waves just \nmight carry decipherable data. I'd start looking on some part of the \nspectra said to be unusable, due to all the background noise. (4+ \nbillion humans?) I'd totally isolate myself, record me thinking DOG \nbackwards, and learn to read what I got. (Microsoft Holy Grail card \nfor Pentium!)\n\n  Next, concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time-bound \nmedia, the ether, and that it is I who move forward (in time). I \nwould try to temporarily locally reverse the flow, (of time, which \nI'd start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism, pole to pole. \n[Why not?]) perhaps by passing a LARGE, FLAT DC current through a \ntwo foot diameter. coil or choke or something, and seeing what I \ncould get with my machine's receiver next to it.  \n\n  If you don't think you'll live to see it, consider this: QUIT \nPUTTING THE REPRODUCTIVE KEYS OF OTHER LIFE IN YOUR BODY! All of \nlife's data could be written on the wind, (ether) not just our \nthoughts. DNA could be a little receiver or file access code. By \neating SEEDS, we could be jamming our reception, or receiving plant \ninstructions. Try eating seed bearing fruit. Maybe those Greek or \nbiblical guys did live hundreds of years. I'm curios to see what \nthey did and ate. Don't worry if your hair stops growing. (Maybe we \ndon't need to eat at all, the cosmos are formed from nothing, and \nthat is creating matter! I only need enough to bounce around. Where \ndid the household concept 'immortal' come from? Wheat is a weed, it \nis programmed to pull from the soil, reproduce like hell, and then \ndie)\n\n  Warning about writing to the past:\nI had a little dream of being in a world, in the near parallel \nfuture, lying along a path of history which we have diverged from. \nThere were; twelve telepathic, glowing beings, who looked like an \nOscar award and who had always been, a dark one who looked like us, \nand then myself. The dark one was in the process of making the \nothers into gods, (he had to teach them what that meant) by \n"advising" them in their past. Basically, he manipulated them into \nreproducing, and raising their children on his seed. He said that \nthe little ones who looked different were a sub-species, meant to \nprovide service. He carefully combed through history, rewriting it \nin his favor, pulling like a weed anything that compromised his \ncontrol. He enticed recruits by sending them his visions, saying \nthat there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve \nsouls: kill or be killed. The amount of control he could exert was \nfinite, though, as at every change he made, a void would appear in \nour reality. The universe one day ended 100 meters from us: it \nseemed odd, but we couldn't remember how else it should be. Then \nsome of the twelve were no more. Finally, when he could prune no \nmore, and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips, he stepped \nthrough his portal to the past, to bask, over and over, in all that \nhe had created. I made a few more changes, and lost my body, \nexisting only on the wind. \n\n  MORAL: Its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls \nwhose will's are not in harmony with yours (Golden Rule - treat \nothers as you wish to be treated) I.E., you could end up along a \nlonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown-nosers for \nplaymates. (its not eternal, there's more than one way back) \n\n Accepting rides to the past:\nOnce here, the one who looks like us sells rides, he can make you a \nPrince, or a Queen, or you can live as a god in ancient Greece. Go \nahead, repeat the third grade as often as you like, Adam henry. \nI Hope you like inspecting your socks. Careful though, if he likes \nyour work, but thinks you're getting wise, he can direct you to cross \npaths with your old self, and you'll vanish as you rewrite your own \ncourse of history, none the wiser.\n\n  As we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped \nback in time, his hierarchy will lose its direction. He can still \nmake changes while he's here, its just that that is work, and with \nevery 'adjustment', this becomes less the world he cultivated, which \nloosens his grip, and his organization is suddenly one branch less. \nBut he can't see the change. The basic nature of man is good. He had \nto apply his hand to achieve his world. As he now tightens his hand \nto retain what he built, the more sand slips through his fingers. \n\n  How about public computer access to the I.R.S. ? Its our country, \nour money, and they're spending it on us, RIGHT? Imagine this: \nWashington marks the next cost at 8, IRS collects 10, gives 5 to \ncongress, and just absolutely buries 5. Congress borrows 2. The banks \nare making, what, a 30% margin (interest) on our government? Big \ncorporations are ecstatic if they can do a 10% margin. What do the \nbanks do with it? Hold some on a carrot to the world, sure, but \nmostly, bury it. WHY? Food production is 2% GNP?, construction 6% ? 14 \nhours to build your auto?  The people are spending all of their time \nto buy back a tenth of what they produce. Have we been deceived? If \nwe are more efficient, why is it getting harder to get by? What if \nthe point is just to keep the people busy making widgets? \n\n  In that other reality, I shouted to the twelve, "its chaos!" They \nsaid, "no, its order." He defined chaos as that which is he was not \nable to control.\n\n  Rain forest: The problem could be that all the water in its canopy \nwould hide the  location of an indigenous people who have no \nlanguage. (telepathic; and 'vanishing' the closest knowledge of death)\n(think of the spine as a transceiver, if it is on the ground and \npointed up, you can locate it from above) These people are probably \nnaive as children, but very, very tough to kill. Also, They should \nbe able to tell you stories about the dark one that I talk about. \nThey can hear him. I think that Ham and world band radio old timers \nmight have a story to tell on this. These people would be on a \ndifferent frequency than us as they aren't eating seeds.\n\n  Famine relief: When I make my diet almost all whole wheat, I get a \nhuge belly, lose muscle mass, sleep A LOT, and get sick. When I eat \nonly fresh fruit, I get more energy, a Hollywood-flat belly, and \nneed a lot less sleep.\n\n  UN. Peace Keeping; There is fighting and killing all over. The \ntroops go in when there is no bread on the shelf. (its OK to kill \neach other, just make sure there is enough to eat.)\n\n  Somalia: What is disturbing is energetic, gun carrying, three foot \ntall sixteen year-olds, who eat nothing but some roots that they \nsuck on. It is not so much that their growth is stunted, it is that \nthey aren't dying at a rate of 50 of 60 years per life. \n\n  Women with children, Babes in arms: Historical references to women \nand children as a single unit could mean that infants were not cut \nfrom the umbilical cord. (and hence, were not breast fed) I think \nthat there may be some very interesting results to this, such as \nmother-child telepathy, and blue blooded infants. There are examples \nof this practice in the aquatic mammal kingdom to investigate.\n\n  That guy is the master of illusion, and the ultimate liar. He \ntells it first, and then just follows the thread of time in which \nthe people are willing to buy it. (in which he can make it so) He'll \nplay a poker face up until he thinks he's cornered, and then he'll \nwhine, beg and grovel. All it means to him is that you're willing to \nlive on the ground work that he has laid, that is, that he was \nright, and he didn't over play his hand, and he won't need to go \nback and try another thread of time. You have ultimate control over \nyour destiny, just don't live along a path that leads to a reality \nin which you don't want to be a part of.
The Proton has been used in 2, 3, and 4 stage versions.  The two stage version\nwas used for the first 3 launches, while the 3 and 4 stage versions are used\ntoday.  The four stage version is used mostly for escape (and geosynchronous?)\norbits, while the 3 stage version is used for low earth orbits.  Since this is\nthe version that launched Mir and the Salyuts (and the add-on modules for Mir),\nas long as Centaur is smaller than Mir (which I believe it is), it should fit\nunder the shroud.\n\nI vaguely recall that the Russians are developing a LH2/LOX upper stage for the\nProton.
There are actually only two of us.  I do Henry, Fred, Tommy and Mary.  Oh yeah,\nthis isn't my real name, I'm a bald headed space baby.
It's my understanding that the freezing will start to occur because of the\ngrowing distance of Pluto and Charon from the Sun, due to it's\nelliptical orbit. It is not due to shadowing effects. \n\n\nPluto can shadow Charon, and vice-versa.\n\nGeorge Krumins\n--
If I read you right, you're saying in essence that, with a larger\neconomy, nations will have more discretionary funds to *waste*\non a lunar facility. That was certainly partially the case with Apollo, \nbut real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing military,\nscientific, or commercial reason for being rather than just a "we have \nthe money, why not?" approach.\n\nIt's conceivable that Luna will have a military purpose, it's possible\nthat Luna will have a commercial purpose, but it's most likely that\nLuna will only have a scientific purpose for the next several hundred\nyears at least. Therefore, Lunar bases should be predicated on funding\nlevels little different from those found for Antarctic bases. Can you\nput a 200 person base on the Moon for $30 million a year? Even if you\nuse grad students?\n\nGary

I note that you make no such case as you claim can be 'even more\neasily made'.  Yes, the argument can (and has) been made that current\ngovernment policy creates even larger market barriers than there were\nin the first place, but there is no such term as 'government failure',\nsince the government can change policies whenever it pleases.  The\nmarket doesn't do that and is governed by (relatively) well-understood\nforces.  This libertopican bilge about 'moral arguments' about\ntaxation, etc., is, at bottom, so much simplistic economic thinking.\nIt can only be 'justified' by cliche derision of anyone who knows more\nabout economics than the libertopian -- which is what invariably\nhappens.  Tripe a la Tommy, the new libertopian dish.\n\n\n\nWherever do you get this inflated idea of your own importance?\n\n-- \n"Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live\n in the real world."   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden

No\nusage of materials from areas of planetary importance.\n\n\nYes: We should *do* this rather than talk about it.

I have attached a copy of an announcement I picked up during my trip to\nMoscow last week.  I have several friends at the Moscow Aviation\nInstitute who have asked me to post this announcement.  (I have done\nsome editing, but the contents is unchanged from the original\nannouncement.) \n\nFor those of you not familiar with the Moscow Aviation Institute, it is\nthe leading Russian school of higher education dedicated to the training\nof aircraft and spacecraft designers.  It specializes in airframe\ndesign, powerplant design, control systems, and power systems.\nVirtually all of the major former Soviet airframe designers (Tupolev,\nSu, Iluchine, Migoyan, etc.) were schooled at MAI.\n\nI had the opportunity to tour the two museums that are maintained at\nMAI.  The aircraft include Mig23, Su 27, Yak 38, the cockpit of an\nF-111(!), among others.  It was a fascinating and eye opening\nexperience, expecially given the fact that the museum was, until a year\nor so ago, closed to virtually everyone.  I also had the opportunity to\nsee some of the experiments being conducted with plasma drive engines\nfor future space craft use.\n\nIf you have any questions about the Institute, or the program, I would\nbe glad to try and answer them.

Forwarded from Neal Ausman, Galileo Mission Director\n\n                                 GALILEO\n                     MISSION DIRECTOR STATUS REPORT\n                               POST-LAUNCH\n                           April 16 - 22, 1993\n\n\nSPACECRAFT\n\n1.  On April 19, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer\n(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\nproperly.\n\n2.  On April 19, a Command Detector Unit Signal-to-Noise Ratio (CDUSNR) test\nand a Radio Frequency Subsystem Automatic Gain Control (RFSAGC) test were\nperformed using the LGA-1 (Low Gain Antenna #1) over DSS-63 (Madrid 70 meter\nantenna) and DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna), respectively.  Data analysis\nis in process.  These tests are periodically performed to provide detailed\ninformation relative to the telecom command hardware integrity.\n\n3.  On April 19, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to\n264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\n\n4.  On April 21, the first of two suppressed carrier/DSN (Deep Space Network)\nadvanced receiver characterization tests was performed over DSS-14 (Goldstone\n70 meter antenna).  The spacecraft modulation index was varied from 43 degrees\nto 90 degrees for a range of ground receiver bandwidth settings.\n\n5.  The AC bus imbalance measurement has not exhibited significant change\n(greater than 25 DN) throughout this period but the DC bus imbalance\nmeasurement has.  The AC measurement reads 20 DN (4.5 volts).  The DC\nmeasurement has ranged from 43 DN (4.6 volts) to 138 DN (16.2 volts) and\ncurrently reads 138 DN (16.2 volts).  These measurements are consistent with\nthe model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.\n\n6.  The Spacecraft status as of April 22, 1993, is as follows:\n\n       a)  System Power Margin -  68 watts\n       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin\n       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner\n       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 21 degrees\n           off-sun (lagging) and 5 degrees off-earth (leading)\n       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1\n       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within\n           acceptable range\n       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range\n       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,\n           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS\n       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within\n           acceptable range\n       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours\n           Time To Initiation - 184 hours\n\n\nTRAJECTORY\n\n     As of noon Thursday, April 22, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory\nstatus was as follows:\n\n	Distance from Earth         169,747,800 km (1.14 AU)\n	Distance from Sun           286,967,900 km (1.92 AU)\n	Heliocentric Speed          91,200 km per hour\n	Distance from Jupiter       532,735,900 km\n	Round Trip Light Time       18 minutes, 58 seconds\n\n\nSPECIAL TOPIC
You totally forgot the original post that you posted Allen. In that post\nyou stated that the "wrap" was on top of and in addition to any overhead.\nGeez in this post you finally admit that this is not true.\n\n\nCome your little ol buns down here and you will find out who is doing\nwhat and who is working on integration. This is simply an ad hominum\nattack and you know it.\n\n\nOf course there is a fee. It is for administration. Geez Allen any\norganization has costs but there is a heck of a difference in  legitimate\ncosts, such as libraries and other things that must be there to support\na program and "wrap" as you originally stated it.You stated that wrap\nwas on top of all of the overhead which a couple of sentences down you\nsay is not true. Which is it Allen?\n\n\nAs you have posted on this subject Allen, you state that wrap is over and\nabove overhead and is a seperate charge. You admit here that this is wrong.\nNasa has a line item budget every year. I have seen it Allen. Get some\nnumbers from that detailed NASA budget and dig out the wrap numbers and then\nhowl to high heaven about it. Until you do that you are barking in the wind.\n\n\nIntegration could be done better at the centers. Apollo integration was \ndone here at Msfc and that did not turn out so bad. The philosophy of\nReston is totally wrong Allen. There you have a bunch of people who are\ncompletely removed from the work that they are trying to oversee. There\nis no way that will ever work. It has never worked in any large scale project\nthat it was ever tried on. Could you imagine a Reston like set up for \nApollo?\n\n\nOh you are full of it Allen on this one. I agree that JSC screwed up big.\nThey should be responsible for that screw up and the people that caused it\nreplaced. To make a stupid statement like that just shows how deep your\nbias goes. Come to MSFC for a couple of weeks and you will find out just\nhow wrong you really are. Maybe not, people like you believe exactly what\nthey want to believe no matter  what the facts are contrary to it. \n\n\nI agree that integration is the single most important part of a  successful\nlarge scale effort. What I completly disagree with is seperating that\nintegration function from  the people that are doing the work. It is called\nleadership Allen. That is what made Apollo work. Final responsibility for\nthe success of Apollo was held by less than 50 people. That is leadership\nand responsibility. There is neither when you have any organization set up\nas Reston is. You could take the same people and move them to JSC or MSFC\nand they could do a much better job. Why did it take a year for Reston to\nfinally say something about the problem? If they were on site and part of the\nprocess then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place.\n\nThere is one heck of a lot I do not know Allen, but one thing I do know is that\nfor a project to be successful you must have leadership. I remember all of the\nturn over at Reston that kept SSF program in shambles for years do you? It is\nlack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem. Lack of\nleadership from the White House, Congress and at Reston. Nasa is only a\nsymptom of a greater national problem. You are so narrowly focused in your\nefforts that you do not see this.\n\n\nNo, I am saying that if they were located at JSC it never would have \nhappened in the first place.\n\nI have the time to reitereate one more timet that if the leadership that is\nat reston was on site at JSC the problem never would have happened, totally\nignoring the lack of leadership of congress. This many headed hydra that\nhas grown up at NASA is the true problem of the Agency and to try to \nchange the question to suit you and your bias is only indicative of\nyour position.
He also ignores a few other things.  While organics would become\nsignificantly more expensive were all the oil to disappear (and thus\nsome things would no longer be economically feasible), oil is hardly\nan irreplaceable resource any more than most other consumables.  As\nsupply decreases, prices rise and alternatives become more\ncompetetive.  He also needs to consider that there has been an\nestimated 30 years of reserves pretty much as long as anyone has cared\nabout petroleum; whatever the current usage rate is, we always seem to\nhave about a 30 year reserve that we know about.\n\n[I'm not sure that last figure is still true -- we tend not to look as\nhard when prices are comparatively cheap -- but it was certainly true\nduring hte 'oil crisis' days of the 70's.]\n\n-- \n"Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live\n in the real world."   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden
Yes, long before Star Trek.  Before Einstein, in fact.\n\nVulcan as a planet inside Mercury was hypothesized to explain a perturbation\nof Mercury's orbit that could not be explained by the known planets.  But\nEinstein's theory of relativity explained Mercury's motion, and analysis\nof Mercury's motion now shows there are _not_ any planets inside its orbit.
An excellent reference for non-technical readers on the ORION system is\n"The Starflight Handbook", by Eugene Mallove and Gregory Matloff, ISBN\n0-471-61912-4.

They have a few problems. The biggest technical problem is the need to find\ntwo satellites going to the same rough orbit for a luanch.\n\nThey also don't show much interest in commercial launches. There is more\nmoney to be made churning out Titan IV's for the government. After all,\nit isn't every day you find a sucker, er, customer who thinks paying\nthree times the commercial rate for launch services is a good idea!\n\n  Allen
Could it be Public Missile, Inc in Michigan?\n\nFrom the description of ad here, it sounds like they're talking about\n"High Power Rocketry", an outgrowth of model rocketry.  This hobby\nuses non-metallic structural compoments and commerically manufactured\nengines ranging in impulse classification from G to P.  The hobby\nhas been flourishing from early 1980s and is becoming increasing popular.\nTechnically this is not consider amateur rocketry.\n\nAny rocket with a liftoff weight greater than 3.3 pounds OR using a\ntotal impulse of G or greater, REQUIRES an FAA waiver to launch.\nTypically, a group of people get an FAA waiver for specified period\nof time (ie week, weekend, etc.) at a designated site and time, and\nall of the launches are then covered under this "blanket waiver".\nThere is also a "High Power Safety Code" which designates more\nspecific rules such as launch field size, etc.\n\nFinally, in order to purchase any of the larger (Class B) rocket \nmotors you need to certified through either the National Association\nof Rocketry or Tripoli Rocketry Association. Certification procedures\nrequire a demonstarted handling and "safe" flight at a total impulse\nlevel.\n\nFor more information, watch rec.models.rockets newsgroup.
McDonnell Douglas rolls out DC-X\n\n ...\n\n\n   SSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60\n   million for the DC-X -- can't itself afford to fund full development of a\n   follow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for\n\nThis is a little peculiar way of putting it, SDIO's budget this year\nwas, what, $3-4 billion? They _could_ fund all of the DC development\nout of one years budget - of course they do have other irons in the\nfire ;-) and launcher development is not their primary purpose, but\nthe DC development could as easily be paid for by diverting that money\nas by diverting the comparable STS ops budget...\n\n- oh, and before the flames start. I applaud the SDIO for funding DC-X\ndevlopment and I hope it works, and, no, launcher development is not\nNASAs primary goal either, IMHO they are supposed to provide the\nenabling technology research for others to do launcher development,\nand secondarily operate such launchers as they require - but that's\njust me.
Fred.\n\n	Try reading a bit.  THe government does lots of multi year\ncontracts with Penalty for cancellation clauses.  They just like to be\ndamn sure they know what they are doing before they sign a multi year\ncontract.   THe reason they aren't cutting defense spending as much\nas they would like is the Reagan administration signed enough\nMulti year contracts,  that it's now cheaper to just finish them out.\n\nLook at SSF.  THis years funding is 2.2 Billion,  1.8 of which will\ncover penalty clauses, due to the re-design.

prb@access.digex.com (Pat) Pontificated: \nWhat I was getting at in my post is whether or not it might be\npossible to put enough brains on board future deep-space probes\nfor them to automatically avoid such things as looking at the\nsun or going into an uncontrolled tumble.  \n\nI heard once that the voyagers had a failsafe routine built in\nthat essentially says "If you never hear from Earth again,\nhere's what to do."  This was a back up in the event a receiver\nburnt out but the probe could still send data (limited, but\nstill some data).  \n\nSince this would be a shutdown that may never be refunded for\nstartup, if some type of cosmic BEM took out the probe, it might\nnot be such a big loss.  Obviously you can't plan for\neverything, but the most obvious things can be considered.

As published in "US Industrial Outlook 1993" \n(which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space \nbusiness are currently projected to be about $4,890 M. \n   In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had \nshown double digits growth rates, this year's projected results are \ndriven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are \nprojected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7 \nsatellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also \nprojects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year, \nand while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to \n$450 M, future sales will be "adversely affected by the downward \nrevision in Department of Defense launch plans."                           \n   Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries, \nrevenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to \nincrease to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from \nbroadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products \nand sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%). \n\n US COMMERCIAL SPACE REVENUES     1989  1990   1991 1992(r) 1993(e)\n Commercial satellites             900 1,000  1,100  1,300     670\n Satellite services                750   800  1,200  1,500   1,900\n   Fixed                          (700) (735)(1,115)(1,275) (1,520)\n   Mobile                          (50) ( 65)(   85)(  225) (  380)\n Satellite ground equip            790   860  1,350  1,400   1,560\n   Mobile equipment                (40)  (85)  (280)  (352)    ???\n Commercial launches               150   570    380    450     450\n Remote sensing data and services  125   155    190    215     250\n Private microgravity research lab  --    --     --     --      60\n                                 ===== =====  ======  =====   =====\n   TOTAL ANNUAL REVENUES         2,715 3,385   4,220  4,815   4,890\n        (r) = revised data for 1992   (e) = estimated data for 1993\n   [Commentary: This is the first look at how the US commercial \nspace industry is expected to do in 1993.  In general, not a bad \nreport -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite \nmanufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth \n$100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual \nprojection.  If we look forward over several years, this market \nsector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very \nsuccessful in regaining international market share in the satellite \nbusiness. \n   Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in \nthe next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid-\nyear.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including \nsuch items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals) \nappears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually \npublishes a listing of  "Space Business Indicators" in mid-year, and \nthe next revision of commercial space revenues should be released \nthen.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if \nthe mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the \nnumbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth. \n   Looking beyond this year's data, future markets look quite \npromising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top \n$3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct \nbroadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite \nstation sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year \nthrough the mid 1990's.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic \nfor near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for \nsubstantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the \nnext 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative \nassumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and \nsatellite direct broadcasting services.  I don't believe all of the \ncurrent players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite \nmarket and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will \nbe financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive \nas currently projected.) \n   It should also be noted this year's DoC data is the first \nrelease to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research \nfacilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for \nthe Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space \nShuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first \nsales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.] \n\n2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS\n   McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta \nlaunch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola \nInc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to \nlaunch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO \ncommunications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas \nwas awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract. \n   The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium \nconstellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium \nsatellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be \nlaunched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle \nlaunches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be \nlaunched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.  \nAdditional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a \nplanned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although \ndetails of the launch services contract were reported to be \nnegotiation, and not yet final. \n   The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of \ntheir Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5 \nmillion, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36 \nlaunches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These \nlaunches will deploy the next generation of the USAF's Global \nPositioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other \nprograms.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is \nexpected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected \nto request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.  \nUnder this contract the USAF can also request "launch on demand" \nservices from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to \noccur within 40 days of the request. \n    [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should \nprovide an excellent business base for MDC's Delta launch program \nthrough the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have \na potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and \nsustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts \nfor international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA \nMedium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping \nMDC as a viable commerical launch company. \n    However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these \ncontracts.  Motorola's Iridium LEO communications constellation has \nnot yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for \noperation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing \nand financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these \napprovals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.  \nBut, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year. \n   Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of \nseveral Congressional actions which have slowed the production of \nthe GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III \nprogram in favor of the USAF NLS/"Spacelifter" program.  At this \ntime, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future \nfunding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts \nis being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy \nreviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and \nCongress propose cancellation of all "ELV upgrade" programs \n(including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed "Spacelifter" \nprogram.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year's budget \ndeliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to \nfind in the shrinking US Defense budget.] \n \n3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC "GO-AHEAD"\n   The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing \nsatellite was approved in early February by the US Department of \nCommerce's Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to \nWorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and \noperate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral \nimages of the Earth. \n   [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture \nby WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the \noperating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the \nrequest of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new \nventure as a "Star Wars" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to \nprovide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into \ndigital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable \ncustomers for this service include exploration geologists, \nagricultural planners, and urban planners.  \n   It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the \n1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last \nNovember, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote \nsensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to \nthis act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to \nall users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures \nwould have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices. \n   There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote \nsensing ventures working their way through the system at different \nstages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite \nsystems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing \ndata market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large, \ngovernment-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures \nsuch as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use \ninnovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the \nmargin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures \nappearing in the next year or so.] \n                 \n4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD'S SPACE BIZ "STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT" \n   Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General \nDynamic's Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker, \ndespite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent \nanalyst's report Morgan Stanley said "We are more than ever \nconvinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical \n95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash-\ngenerating unit."  Based upon discussions with GD's corporate \nmanagement, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are \ncleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and \n$100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD's projection of \ncapturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market. \n   [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has \nhurt General Dynamic's Space Systems Division.  Since GD has \nrestructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses, \nmany market pundits have been speculating GD's space business might \nbe next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD's Space \nSystems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current \nproblems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected \nto be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of \nabout $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space \nlaunch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability \nof their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits \nfrom those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur \nprogram is back on track, this division will continue to show \nsubstantial losses. \n   In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation \nis not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.  \nTo do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional \nmanagement would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.  \nIn GD SSD's case, to get the division back on track, the management \nteam will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with \nthe Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would \nindicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch \noperations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince \ncustomers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would \nhave substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in \nmarketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for \nthis might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly \nMcDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash \nflow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction \n(Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed), \nor have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the \n$700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of \nchange for any company.] \n \n5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND\n   Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is \nprojecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990's.  In early \nFebruary, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which \ndetailed their projection of the space transportation market for the \nnext decade. \n   Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant \nposition and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54 \ninternational and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane \nholds contracts for 31, General Dynamics' Atlas vehicle holds 14 \ncontracts, McDonnell Douglas' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall's Long \nMarch vehicle holds 2 launch contracts. \n   Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can \ncompete are projected to come from communications satellites with \nthe remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and \nscientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand \ngrowth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region. \n   Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of \nindividual satellite operators into regional or national groups will \ncontinue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with \nlarger communications payloads carrying more transponders. \nArianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications \nsatellites should increase by 20 % over today's average level, to \nabout 3000 kg in GEO. \n   Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain \nstrong over the next three years, but in the second half of the \ndecade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace \nbases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder \ndemand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques \nappear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing \nor near-term transponders. \n   One of the significant possible changes in the market was \nidentified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian \nlaunch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term, \ninvestors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade \noff between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and \nother new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities \nand service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal. \n   [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and \nI reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.  \nComparing the two surveys, there aren't outstanding differences in \nthe numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new \ndata compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical \ntransponders on orbit.\n   I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space-\nbased communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While \nfiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the \nestablished point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing \ndemand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to-\nmultipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space \ntransponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability \nservice, but only from established point A to established point B. \nTo establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable \nbetween the points, and while there are improved network solutions, \ninstalling a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost \nmillions or billions of dollars.  \n   For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground \nnetwork structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective \nsolution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is \ncheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of \nthousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite \nnetwork.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and \nhas kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is \ngrowing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced, \nit becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to \nhandle the increase in traffic. \n   Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still \ngrowing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But \nsatellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current \ngeneration satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of \non-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from \nlast generation's satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch \ndemand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite \nlaunches over longer intervals. \n   And as last note; Arianespace didn't flag it this year, but it \nlooks like the space transportation market will be rather over-\nsupplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual \ncommercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites \nper year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up \nto about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of \nabout 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8, \nJapan's H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia's Proton capable of 8, and other \nsystems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per \nyear.  That's a lot of capability for a small market. \n   We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial \nlaunches.]\n\n6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT \n   The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has \nspawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety \nrules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt \nthe mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation \nof range safety rules.  \n   In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of \ntwo abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure \ntypically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at \nWallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute \nbefore the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was \noverridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the \ncommunications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the \nvalid abort call. \n   Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort \ncommand receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an \ninvestigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to \nlaunch constraint rules, and was not obeyed. \n   Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety \nBoard (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This \ninvestigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an \nincident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their \ninvestigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at \nlines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used \nin the launch. \n  [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an \ninvestigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested \nby the Department of Commerce's Office of Commercial Space \nTransportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.  \n   At the time of writing this column, some of the initial \ninvestigations have been concluded, and some of the results are \nstarting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four \ndifferent communications channels were in use during the test. After \nthe abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test \ndirector and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops \nIsland gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.  \nAccording to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch. \nSomehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the \nNASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying \nthe Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing \nexplainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the \nbest set being that clear lines of communications and clear \ndefinition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and \nunderstanding of the mission rules were not established before the \nlaunch.  \n   As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these \nprocedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.   \nThis case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has \nbeen called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they \ndo with commercial aircraft problems).  \n   I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with \nprocedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance \nof guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how \nspecific lines of authority should be delineated.] \n\n7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED\n   Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new \nsmall space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.  \nTwo versions of the launcher are being marketed: the "Aerokosmos" \nwinged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the "Severkosmos", \nlaunched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is \nprojected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to \nan 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430 \nkg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used \nwith these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called \n'Sineva'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military \nestablishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of \nspacecraft and which has participated in the development of the \nBuran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia \nfacility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow. \n   [Commentary: There's very little released information on this new \nventure.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking \nfor hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house \nknowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous \ncommercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union. \n   This one's a little different in that they are offering variants \nof ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can't identify any key customers being \ntargeted or substantial financial backing.]\n\n8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING\n   In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the \nresults of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial \nrocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland \nMissile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary \nstudy recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch \nsite, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected \nlow investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic \nconsiderations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal \nfor other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses. \n   [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the \nKingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still \nproceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland \nfound without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if \nsubstantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected \nreturns were too low to justify the cost of development.  \n   This might point out some key discriminators in judging the \nfeasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:\n  - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage \nsufficient to recover setup costs?\n  - Is there a market advantage of using the site?\n  - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?\n  - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the \ninvestment?  \n   Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at \nWoomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore \nPlatform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against \nthese criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying \non hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]\n\n9- SPAIN'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING\n   In one of his last official acts, former President Bush \nauthorized space technology transfer for several joint space \nventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed \nuse of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that \nregulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch \nvehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first \nlaunch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as \na small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into \nLEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system, \nincluding 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.  \nOriginated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in \ndevelopment funding, and will use technology from Argentina's Condor \nlaunch vehicle as well as from the US. \n   [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity \nin providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small \npayloads from European firms or organizations currently use either \nAriane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.  \nHowever, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout \nprogram is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the \nItalian government and space industry regarding any follow-on \nsystem).  \n   This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch \nsystem.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of \nsuch a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies \nhave been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche \nAerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the \nSwedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to \nfind any other European development work with even a rumor of \nfunding for hardware. \n   Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the \nArgentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting \nrumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space \nlauncher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled \nthe country in the 1970's and early 1980's. \n   What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally \ntransferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new \ncivilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de \nAtividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described \nas originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket \nprogram in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German \nfirms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq \nin the mid-1980's.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and \ntested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package \nlagged that of the propulsion system. \n   It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first \nscientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B \nsatellite will study the Earth's upper atmosphere and includes \ncooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has \nyet been selected, but OSC's Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air \nlaunched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this \ncontract.] \n\n10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP\n   PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in \nlate February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract \nfrom the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro's PA-2 \nlaunch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar \nSatellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish \nSpace Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and \noffering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According \nto PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya \nlaunch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully-\nenclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like \nthe PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as "the main \nalternative rocket supplier" for the small satellite launch service \nto be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the \nSwedish satellite was not specified. \n   [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and \nfunding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a \nsmall, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From \nPacAstro's literature, the engines designed for the PA-series \nrockets are built of "off the shelf" components based upon the Lunar \nMOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a \n225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.  \n   PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its \nfirst three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and \n2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired \nTRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary \nengineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder \nclosely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same \nbuilding).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering, \nlaunch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support. \nSumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the \nboard of directors.  \n   PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least \n$550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been \nsearching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to \ndesign, build and launch their first set of vehicles. \n   The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help \nbring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need \nmuch more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real \nhardware.] \n\n11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED\n    In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications \nventure between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.  \nAs reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC), \nheadquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist \nParty, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China \nGreat Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional \ncommunications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite \nsystem cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the \nsatellite's communications channels.  \n   [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the \nrelease of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid \nJanuary).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of \nTaiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg \nscientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional \nsatellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has \nbeen helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530 \nM) through 2006.  \n   I haven't been able to establish any relationship between this \nventure and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.  \nWhile Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the \ncurrent Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two \nseparate sastellite ventures. \n   The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is "Asiasat-\n2", but I don't thinks this has any relationship with the existing \nHong Kong-based "Asiasat" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and \nother Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational \nmodel.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing \nventure -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to \nTaiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later \nsatellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between \nTaiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture \nthrough a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to \nproceed. \n   In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with \nsubstantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This \nis just another indicator to add to the list.] \n\n12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES\n   South Korea's Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently \nannounced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and \nanother US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for \nadvanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been \nspecifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with \nmanufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by \n1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea's \naerospace technology to the level of the world's top 10 countries by \n2000.                                 \n   [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its \nnational aerospace industry, specifically including space \nactivities. I'm noting this as a flag that potential new players are \ncoming into the commercial space market. \n   As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications \nsatellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995 \non Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide \ntelevision and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula, \nsouthwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea. \n   South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on \nAriane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US \n$8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of \nthis year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely "made in Korea."  \nUribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment-\nmonitoring micro-satellite. \n   This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth \nobservation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System) \nproject, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean \ngovernment, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with \noptical and microwave sensors.\n   South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel \nmilitary effort to establish the capabilities for building and \nlaunching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a \ngovernment panel had been established to oversee such an effort, \nfunded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an  \nexpected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the \nKorean peninsula.       \n   In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean \nis also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing \naerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is \noffsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as \npart of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of \nconsumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports \nsatellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has \nannounced teaming for production of OSC's Orbcomm user terminals.).  \n   This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.  \nConsidering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector \nfor commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a \nSouth Korean push into space technologies may change the composition \nof commercial space market there over the next decade.] \n\n13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH\n   As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the \nresults of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and \ninvestments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of \nMarch.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the \nmarket as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+% \nof the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a \ngeneral increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The \nincrease in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which \nis a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this \ntrend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite \nwell, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms \nwhich are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its \nresults in all of 1993.  We'll keep an eye on these ....\n\n   INDEX RESULTS THROUGH MARCH\n                           Beginning  Beginning      1 Jan 93 to\n                           1992       1993           31 Mar 1993\n                           -------    --------       --------\n   S&P 500                 416        436  (+4.7%)   452  (+3.7%)\n   Space Tech Index        267        304 (+13.6%)   373 (+22.7%)\n   Comm'l Space Tech Index 167        194 (+16.3%)   222 (+14.2%)\n   Space Tech Pure Plays   147        169 (+15.4%)   197 (+16.2%)\n\n\nFINAL NOTES - \n    What?  This column's already full?  And I still have bunches of \ncommercial space developments to report on.  As I said at the start \nof this, column there's been a lot of interesting happenings - but \nI'll have to put them into the next issue.  \n   Looking ahead, I've got several articles in the works on new \nhappenings with Iridium and the LEO communications satellite market, \nmore news on international launchers appearing (and disappearing) on \nthe market, new international commercial space ventures,  and other \ninteresting developments. \n   And as always, I hope you folks find this stuff useful and \ninteresting -- Any and all comments are welcome.
The HGA isn't all that reflective in the wavelengths that might "cook the\nfocal elements", nor is its figure good on those scales--the problem is\nthat the antenna _itself_ could not be exposed to Venus-level sunlight,\nlest like Icarus' wings it melt.  (I think it was glues and such, as well\nas electronics, that they were worried about.)  Thus it had to remain\nfurled and the axis _always_ pointed near the sun, so that the small\nsunshade at the tip of the antenna mast would shadow the folded HGA.\n(A larger sunshade beneath the antenna shielded the spacecraft bus.)
{Description of "External Tank" option for SSF redesign deleted}\n\n\nYo Ken, let's keep on-top of things! Both the "External Tank" and\n"Wingless Orbiter" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign\noptions list. Today's (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports\nthat O'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have\nbeen dropped, such as using the "giant external fuel tanks used\nin launching space shuttles," and building a "station around\nan existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed."\n\nCurrently, there are three options being considered, as presented\nto the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in\ntoday's Times).\n\nOption "A" - Low Cost Modular Approach\nThis option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,\nthere are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting\nthe SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and\nReston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective\nteams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this\noption are:\n  -  Uses "Bus-1", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that's\n     qualified for STS and ELV's. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C\n     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this\n     for the Air Force.\n  -  A "Power Station Capability" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.\n     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle\n     flies in an "arrow mode" to optimize the microgravity environment.\n     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power\n     source for 30 day missions.\n  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term\n     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the\n     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing\n     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International\n     Partners' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The\n     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.\n     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.\n  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and\n     add another 20 kW of power\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,\n     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return\n     Vehicle).\n\nOption "B" - Space Station Freedom Derived\nThe Option "B" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.\nThis option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we\nhave all come to know and love :)\n\nThis option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for\nuse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option "A"). Also, the \nnumber of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,\nfor both options "A" and "B".\n\nThe build-up occurs in six phases:\n  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power\n     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when\n     it visits.\n  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist\n     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is\n     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by\n     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes\n     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the\n     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).\n  -  A "Two Fault Tolerance Capability" is achieved after 14 flights,\n     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal\n     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.\n  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,\n     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the\n     assembly in 24 flights.\n\nMost of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, \nwith the exception of the data management system, which has major\nchanges.
Sorry, not so -- the changes in sunrise and sunset times are not\nquite synchronized.  For example, neither the earliest sunrise nor the\nlatest sunset comes on the longest day of the year.

Others claim to be staying of their own free\nwill, but Jobs' persuasive manner makes this hard to confirm.\n\nIn conversations with authorities, Jobs has given conflicting\ninformation on how heavily prepared the group is for war with the\nindustry.  At times, he has claimed to "have hardware which will blow\nanything else away", while more recently he claims they have stopped\nmanufacturing their own.\n\nAgents from the ATF (Apple-Taligent Forces) believe that the group is\nequipped with serious hardware, including 486-caliber pieces and\npossibly Canon equipment.\n\nThe siege has attracted a variety of spectators, from the curious to\nother cultists.  Some have offered to intercede in negotiations,\nincluding a young man who will identify himself only as "Bill" and\nclaims to be the "MS-iah".\n\nFormer members of the cult, some only recently deprogrammed, speak\nhesitantly of their former lives, including being forced to work\n20-hour days, and subsisting on Jolt and Twinkies.  There were\nfrequent lectures in which they were indoctrinated into a theory of\n"interpersonal computing" which rejects traditional roles.\n\nLate-night vigils on Chesapeake Drive are taking their toll on\nfederal marshals.  Loud rock and roll, mostly Talking Heads, blares\nthroughout the night.  Some fear that Jobs will fulfill his own\napocalyptic prophecies, a worry reinforced when the loudspeakers\ncarry Jobs' own speeches -- typically beginning with a chilling "I\nwant to welcome you to the 'Next World' ".
Wasn't there a "plain" flavor too?  They looked more like some\nkind of extruded industrial product than food -- perfectly\nsmooth cylinders with perfectly smooth ends.  Kinda scary.\n\n\nAn other post described it as like a "microwaved Tootsie Roll" --\nwhich captures the texture pretty well.  As for taste, they were\nlike candy, only not very sweet -- does that make sense? I recall\nliking them for their texture, not taste. I guess I have well\ndeveloped texture buds.\n\n\nIt was obligatory to eat a few while watching "Captain Scarlet".\nDoes anybody else remember _that_, as long as we're off the\ntopic of space?\n\nShag\n\n--
It doesn't make a whole lot of difference, actually, since they weren't\nbuilding spares of the station hardware anyway.  (Dumb.)  At least this\nis only one launch to fail.
This claim was made when someone spotted training film footage spliced into\nthe footage of the actual spacewalk.

Sure.  Contact the World Space Foundation.  They're listed in the sci.space\nFrequently Asked Questions file, which I'll excerpt.\n\n    WORLD SPACE FOUNDATION - has been designing and building a solar-sail\n    spacecraft for longer than any similar group; many JPL employees lend\n    their talents to this project. WSF also provides partial funding for the\n    Palomar Sky Survey, an extremely successful search for near-Earth\n    asteroids. Publishes *Foundation News* and *Foundation Astronautics\n    Notebook*, each a quarterly 4-8 page newsletter. Contributing Associate,\n    minimum of $15/year (but more money always welcome to support projects).\n\n	World Space Foundation\n	Post Office Box Y\n	South Pasadena, California 91301\n\nWSF put together a little paperback anthology of fiction and\nnonfiction about solar sails: *Project Solar Sail*.  I think Robert\nStaehle, David Brin,  or Arthur Clarke may be listed as editor.\n\nAlso there is a nontechnical book on solar sailing by Louis Friedman,\na technical one by a guy whose name escapes me (help me out, Josh),\nand I would expect that Greg Matloff and Eugene Mallove have something\nto say about the subject in *The Starflight Handbook*, as well as\nquite a few references.\n\n\nCheck the following articles in *Journal of the British Interplanetary\nSociety*:\n\nV36 p. 201-209 (1983)\nV36 p. 483-489 (1983)\nV37 p. 135-141 (1984)\nV37 p. 491-494 (1984)\nV38 p. 113-119 (1984)\nV38 p. 133-136 (1984)\n\n(Can you guess that Matloff visited Fermilab and gave me a bunch of\nreprints?

Here is a way to get the commericial companies into space and mineral\nexploration.\n\nBasically get the eci-freaks to make it so hard to get the minerals on earth..\nYou think this is crazy. Well in a way it is, but in a way it is reality.\n\nThere is a billin the congress to do just that.. Basically to make it so\nexpensive to mine minerals in the US, unless you can by off the inspectors or\ntax collectors.. ascially what I understand from talking to a few miner friends \nof mine, that they (the congress) propose to have a tax on the gross income of\nthe mine, versus the adjusted income, also the state governments have there\nnormal taxes. So by the time you get done, paying for materials, workers, and\nother expenses you can owe more than what you made.\nBAsically if you make a 1000.00 and spend 500. ofor expenses, you can owe\n600.00 in federal taxes.. Bascially it is driving the miners off the land.. And\nthe only peopel who benefit are the eco-freaks.. \n\nBasically to get back to my beginning statement, is space is the way to go\ncause it might just get to expensive to mine on earth because of either the\neco-freaks or the protectionist.. \nSuch fun we have in these interesting times..
Any prize like this is going to need to be worded carefully enough that\nyou cannot get it without demonstrating sustained and reliable capability,\nrather than a lucky one-shot.  It can be done.

Well thank you dennis for your as usual highly detailed and informative \nposting.   \n\nThe question i have about the proton, is  could it be  handled at\none of KSC's spare pads, without major  malfunction,  or could it be\nhandled at kourou  or Vandenberg?   \n\nNow if it uses storables,  then  how long would it take for the russians\nto equip something at cape york?\n\nIf  Proton were launched from a western site,  how would it compare to the\nT4/centaur?   As i see it, it should lift  very close to the T4.
As I heard the story, before Albert came up the the theory\no'relativity and warped space, nobody could account for\nMercury's orbit.  It ran a little fast (I think) for simple\nNewtonian physics.  With the success in finding Neptune to\nexplain the odd movments of Uranus, it was postulated that there\nmight be another inner planet to explain Mercury's orbit.  \n\nIt's unlikely anything bigger than an asteroid is closer to the\nsun than Mercury.  I'm sure we would have spotted it by now.\nPerhaps some professionals can confirm that.

------- Blind-Carbon-Copy\n\nTo: spacenews@austen.rand.org, cti@austen.rand.org\nSubject: White House outlines options for station, Russian cooperation\nDate: Tue, 06 Apr 93 16:00:21 PDT\nFrom: Richard Buenneke <buenneke@austen.rand.org>\n\n4/06/93:  GIBBONS OUTLINES SPACE STATION REDESIGN GUIDANCE\n\nNASA Headquarters, Washington, D.C.\nApril 6, 1993\n\nRELEASE:  93-64\n\n        Dr.  John H.  Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology\nPolicy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the\nRedesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance\nto the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space\nstation.\n\n        A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a\nhigh option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Each\noption would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development,\noperations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research\noperations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program\nreserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.\n\n        Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA\nbudget for the President's new technology investment.  As a result,\nstation options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting\nreductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station\noption of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA\nbudget over the next 5 years.\n\n        Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of\nthe advisory committee.  Generally, the members-designate focused upon\nadministrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They also\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the\nStation Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory\ncommittee to consider.\n\n        Gibbons also announced that the United States and its\ninternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- have\ndecided, after consultation, to give "full consideration" to use of\nRussian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.\n\n        To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the\nredesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign\nteam can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR\nand the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems.\nThe U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of\nthe Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  The\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing\nstation costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes.\nCareful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving\nthat goal.\n\n        Gibbons reiterated that, "President Clinton is committed to the\nredesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the\nscience, the technology and the jobs that the space station program\nrepresents.  However, he also is committed to a space station that is well\nmanaged and one that does not consume the national resources which should\nbe used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation."\n\n        NASA Administrator Daniel S.  Goldin said the Russian\nparticipation will be accomplished through the East-West Space Science\nCenter at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald\nSagdeev.

I've been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I've \ntranscribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means\ninfallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is \ngranted to copy this without restriction.\n\nMichael Sternberg, Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT, was invited to speak at an\ninformal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois.\nACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control, Disarmament and\nInternational Security.  RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because the\ncompany is using Russian launchers and satellites.  I think it also helped that\nhis daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.\n\nThe concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tonga\nto visit a friend.  While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king,\nwho happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which \nthe king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million,\nHis Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thought\nthere probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous\nsatellite slots.  While this isn't entirely off the wall, it was very unusual,\nseeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot of\nslots.\n\nThe whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl\nHilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinions\nsupporting Tonga's case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from \n70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside).\nAccording to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in the\nworld because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and \nthe Pacific Rim. \n\nRIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a tax\nhaven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, to\nfill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have\ncost approximately $2 billion.  It's not easy to raise that kind of money.\nEventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began \nnegotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in \nMoscow in such harsh terms that I don't think I'll visit there for a long time.\nBesides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the way\nthat people operate.  For example "everybody can sell you everything."  \nEveryone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the\nonly ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.\n\nEventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost\nof $150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternberg\nsays that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who \nwent to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos was\nout of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  He\nagain described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually,\nhe worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the \nRussian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessions\nbefore signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to \nallow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.\n\nThe next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied \nMechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in \nSiberia (can't figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has built\nabout 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented that\nsiberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honest\npeople who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At this\npoint there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on\nboth siberians and midwesterners :-)\n\nSternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is \napparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite that\nwould sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them \nspecifications, they'll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellites\nthat RIMSAT will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  This\ncompares to $810,000 t/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1\nmillion compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their \nsatellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They \nhave the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can give\nyou their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they are\ngetting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into place\nnow.\n\nTidbits:\n\n*  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not big\nbusiness because big business is just like what they have over there, except\nthat "we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier."\n\n*  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launch\nwithin 9 months.\n\n*  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20, which is a huge retirement\nfund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia,\nand a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says is\nsort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.\n\n*  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worried\npartly because we aren't used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvarying\nmonolith.  Italy gets a new government "every two weeks" but we don't worry \nbecause we're used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing what\nreally goes on in Russia we won't worry about their stability as much.\n\n*  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering\nmoney.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting\n25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the "equivalent" value in \nrubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian\nbank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that\nthe only the contractors get swindled by the government.\n\n*  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western \nsatellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same type\nof satellites, which was rather reassuring.\n\n*  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive\ntechnology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites have\na lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites compare\nwell with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much \nshorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the \ndifference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition,\nshorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer\ntechnology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of date\nhardware.
Well said.\n \n\nOkay, Del, so Michael was being unfair, but you are being unfair back.  \nHe is taking college courses now, I presume he is studying hard, and\nhis postings reveal that he is *somewhat* hip to the technical issues\nof astronautics.  Plus, he is attentively following the erudite\ndiscourse of the Big Brains who post to sci.space; is it not\ninevitable that he will get a splendid technical education from\nreading the likes of you and me? [1]\n\nLike others involved in sci.space, Mr. Adams shows symptoms of being a\nfledgling member of the technoculture, and I think he's soaking it up\nfast.  I was a young guy with dreams once, and they led me to get a\ntechnical education to follow them up.  Too bad I wound up in an\nassembly-line job stamping out identical neutrinos day after day...\n(-:\n\n[1] Though rumors persist that Del and I are both pseudonyms of Fred\nMcCall.
In fact, you can all direct your ire at the proper target by ingoring NASA \naltogether.  The rocket is a commercial launch vechicle - a Conestoga flying \na COMET payload.  NASA is simply the primary customer.  I believe SDIO has a\nsmall payload as well.  The advertising space was sold by the owners of the\nrocket, who can do whatever they darn well please with it.  In addition, these\nanonymous "observers" had no reason to be startled.  The deal made Space News\nat least twice. \n\n\n\n\nI think its only fair to find that out before everyone starts having a hissy\nfit.  The fact that they bothered to use the conditional tense suggests that\nit has not yet been approved.
I can tell you that when AMSAT launched some birds along a Spot satellite\n(French), that during installation of some instruments on Spot 2, there\nheavily armed legionaires who had a `take no prisoners' look on there faces.\nSpot satellites are completely capable of doing some very good on orbit\nsurveillance.\n\nBMc\n--

The\n    publication was enormously successful: we distributed 2000 copies to\n    space enthusiasts across the country and even sent a few to people in\n    Great Britain, Australia, and Ecuador. Due to the tremendous response to\n    the first edition, PPS has published an expanded, up-to-date second\n    edition of the guide.\n\n    The 40-page publication boasts 69 listings for summer and full-time job\n    opportunities as well as graduate school programs. The second edition of\n    "Space Jobs" features strategies for entering the space field and\n    describes positions at consulting and engineering firms, NASA, and\n    non-profit organizations. The expanded special section on graduate\n    schools highlights a myriad of programs ranging from space manufacturing\n    to space policy.

Bussard, Journal of\n	Propulsion and Power, Vol. 6, No. 5, Sept.-Oct. 1990\n\n	    Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion\n	    systems, with propulsion thrust-power-input-power ratio (the\n	    thrust-power "gain" G(t)) much greater than unity. Gain values\n	    of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are\n	    always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8). With these, "high-thrust"\n	    interplanetary flight is not possible, because system\n	    acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local\n	    gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100\n	    times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer\n	    "high-thrust" flight capability. One performance example shows a\n	    53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with\n	    19% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle. Another shows\n	    the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in\n	    Earth/moon space.\n\n	"The QED Engine System: Direct Electric Fusion-Powered Systems for\n	Aerospace Flight Propulsion" by Robert W.

Koloc, Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion\n	Energy, special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY, March 1989.\n\n	    Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron\n	    flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times\n	    larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma\n	    pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds\n	    could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities\n	    and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and\n	    other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKtm\n	    innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure\n	    efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically\n	    compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power\n	    conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens\n	    of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the\n	    multi-gigawatt electric output size. Engineering advantages\n	    indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost. [I\n	    strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously. Bob\n	    Hirsch, the primary proponent of the Tokamak, has recently\n	    declared Koloc's PLASMAKtm precursor, the spheromak, to be one\n	    of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather\n	    than Tokamak.

It was more than a theoretical concept; it was seriously pursued by\nFreeman Dyson et al many years ago. I don't know how well-known this is,\nbut a high explosive Orion prototype flew (in the atmosphere) in San\nDiego back in 1957 or 1958. I was working at General Atomic at the time,\nbut I didn't learn about the experiment until almost thirty years later,\nwhen \nTed Taylor visited us and revealed that it had been done. I feel sure\nthat someone must have film of that experiment, and I'd really like to\nsee it. Has anyone out there seen it?

Oddly, enough,  The smithsonian calls the lindbergh years\nthe golden age of flight.  I would call it the granite years,\nreflecting the primitive nature of it.  It was  romantic,\nswashbuckling daredevils,  "those daring young men in their flying\nmachines".  But in reality, it sucked.  Death was a highly likely\noccurence,  and  the environment blew.  Ever see the early navy\npressure suits,  they were modified  diving suits.  You were ready to\nstar in "plan 9 from outer space".   Radios  and Nav AIds were\na joke,  and engines ran on castor oil.  They  picked and called aviators\n"men with iron stomachs",  and it wasn't due to vertigo.\n\nOddly enough, now we are in the golden age of flight.  I can hop the\nshuttle to NY for $90 bucks,  now that's golden.\n\nMercury gemini, and apollo were romantic,  but let's be honest.\nPeeing in bags,  having plastic bags glued to your butt everytime\nyou needed a bowel movement.  Living for days inside a VW Bug.\nRomantic,  but not commercial.   The DC-X  points out a most likely\nnew golden age.  An age where  fat cigar smoking business men in\nloud polyester space suits will fill the skys with strip malls\nand used space ship lots.\n\nhhhmmmmm,  maybe i'll  retract that golden age bit.   Maybe it was\nbetter in the old days.  Of course, then we'll have  wally schirra\ntelling his great grand children, "In my day,  we walked on the moon.\nEvery day.

All of this talk about a COMMERCIAL space race (i.e. $1G to the first 1-year \nmoon base) is intriguing. Similar prizes have influenced aerospace \ndevelopment before. The $25k Orteig prize helped Lindbergh sell his Spirit of \nSaint Louis venture to his financial backers.\n\nIf memory serves, the $25k prize would not have been enough to totally \nreimburse some of the more expensive transatlantic projects (such as \nFokker's, Nungesser and other multi-engine projects). However Lindbergh \nultimately kept his total costs below that amount.\n\nBut I strongly suspect that his Saint Louis backers had the foresight to \nrealize that much more was at stake than $25,000.\n\nCould it work with the moon? Who are the far-sighted financial backers of \ntoday?

I might suggest giving the management some more mumble time by asking\nthe very leading question (in two or three parts)\n   What are your long term expectations of space market, what projects\nspecifically are they funding by internal funds and at what levels\nand what competition do you expect in this  area. (This last point\nis always worth hitting upper management with "gently" if you want \nthem to think and as hard as you can if you have a good case that\nthere really is competion)

Archive-name: space/controversy\nLast-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:06 $\n\nCONTROVERSIAL QUESTIONS\n\n    These issues periodically come up with much argument and few facts being\n    offered. The summaries below attempt to represent the position on which\n    much of the net community has settled. Please DON'T bring them up again\n    unless there's something truly new to be discussed. The net can't set\n    public policy, that's what your representatives are for.\n\n\n    WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS\n\n    Despite a widespread belief to the contrary, the Saturn V blueprints\n    have not been lost. They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on\n    microfilm.\n\n    The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings, it\n    is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960's vintage hardware (like\n    guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB\n    have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch\n    from.\n\n    By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify\n    the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean\n    sheet design.\n\n\n    WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE\n\n    Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access\n    for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an\n    opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being\n    "scooped" by people uninvolved in the mission. However, NASA frequently\n    releases examples (in non-digital form, e.g. photos) to the public early\n    in a mission.\n\n\n    RISKS OF NUCLEAR (RTG) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES\n\n    There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to\n    block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium\n    thermal sources being dangerous. Numerous studies claim that even in\n    worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental\n    reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small.\n    Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2\n    RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather\n    satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months\n    with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar\n    module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which\n    was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in\n    the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are\n    expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10\n    half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].\n\n    To make your own informed judgement, some references you may wish to\n    pursue are:\n\n    A good review of the technical facts and issues is given by Daniel\n    Salisbury in "Radiation Risk and Planetary Exploration-- The RTG\n    Controversy," *Planetary Report*, May-June 1987, pages 3-7. Another good\n    article, which also reviews the events preceding Galileo's launch,\n    "Showdown at Pad 39-B," by Robert G. Nichols, appeared in the November\n    1989 issue of *Ad Astra*.

Studies\n    indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in\n    absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The\n    remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted\n    study, Charles Jackman.\n\n    The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the\n    stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was\n    organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space\n    Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia\n    (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space\n    Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and\n    Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects\n    of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.\n\n    The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:\n\n       Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms/year\n	  Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms/year\n	  Shuttle sources:	  725,000 kilograms/year\n\n    The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are\n    launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the\n    total stratospheric chlorine sources.\n\n    The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would\n    be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability\n    associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.\n\n    The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed\n    by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally\n    averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and\n    Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch\n    schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be\n    increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about\n    the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons\n    do at the present time.\n\n    Theoretical results of this study have been published in _The Space\n    Shuttle's Impact on the Stratosphere_, MJ Prather, MM Garcia, AR\n    Douglass, CH Jackman, M.K.W.

Holding your\n    breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to\n    watch out for when ascending, and you'll have eardrum trouble if your\n    Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal\n    experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no\n    immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do\n    not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.\n\n    Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly "the bends", certainly some\n    [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)\n    start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from\n    lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,\n    you're dying. The limits are not really known.\n\n    References:\n\n    _The Effect on the Chimpanzee of Rapid Decompression to a Near Vacuum_,\n    Alfred G. Koestler ed., NASA CR-329 (Nov 1965).\n\n    _Experimental Animal Decompression to a Near Vacuum Environment_, R.W.\n    Bancroft, J.E. Dunn, eds, Report SAM-TR-65-48 (June 1965), USAF School\n    of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Texas.\n\n\n    HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED\n\n    The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is\n    a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example.\n    What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank\n    came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the\n    astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin\n    team's medical/forensic report.\n\n    The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the\n    water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks\n    underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team\n    examined them, they were sent off to be buried.\n\n\n    USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT\n\n    You can't use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit\n    because it can't get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry\n    enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.\n\n    Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of\n    that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in\n    the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly\n    specialized for travel between Earth's surface and low orbit. Taking it\n    higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would\n    be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit\n    spacecraft.\n\n    [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]\n\n\n    THE "FACE ON MARS"\n\n    There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid\n    face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery:\n    35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often\n    published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13\n    (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).\n\n    Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is\n    artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an\n    extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the\n    resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a\n    smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere\n    on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don't\n    know the address) to study the Face.\n\n    The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution\n    camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this\n    question in a few years. In the meantime, speculation about the Face is\n    best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors, not sci.space or\n    sci.astro.\n\n    V. DiPeitro and G.

Lindbergh's flight took place in '27, not the thirties.\n\n\nCould you give examples of privately funded ones?\n\n\nYour logic certainly applies to standard investment strategies.  However, the\nconcept of a prize for a difficult goal is done for different reasons, I \nsuspect.  I'm not aware that Mr Orteig received any significant economic \nbenefit from Lindbergh's flight.  Modern analogies, such as the prize for a\nhuman powered helicopter face similar arguments.  There is little economic\nbenefit in such a thing.  The advantage comes in the new approaches developed\nand the fact that a prize will frequently generate far more work than the \nequivalent amount of direct investment would.  A person who puts up $ X billion\nfor a moon base is much more likely to do it because they want to see it done\nthan because they expect to make money off the deal.
The Apollo fire was harsh, A Saturn V explosion would have been\nhurtful but The Soviets winning would have been crushing. That could have\nbeen *the* technological turning point for the US turning us\nfrom Today's "We can do anything, we're *the* Super Power" to a much more\nreserved attitude like the Soviet Program today.\n\nKennedy was gone by 68\69, the war was still on is the east, I think\nthe program would have stalled badly and the goal of the moon\nby 70 would have been dead with Nasa trying to figure were they went wrong.\n \n\nI speulate that:\n+The Saturn program would have been pushed into\nthe 70s with cost over runs that would just be too evil. \nNixon still wins.\n+The Shuttle was never proposed and Skylab never built.\n+By 73 the program stalled yet again under the fuel crisis.\n+A string of small launches mark the mid seventies.\n+By 76 the goal of a US man on the moon is dead and the US space program\ndrifts till the present day.

Gamma Ray Spectrometer Random Access Memory\nwas successfully reloaded on Monday, April 19.  To prepare for\nMagnetometer Calibrations which were rescheduled for execution in Flight\nSequence C9 on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week, a reload of Payload\nData System Random Access Memory will take place this morning\nbeginning at 10:30 AM.\n\nOver this weekend, the Flight Team will send real-time commands to\nperform Differential One-Way Ranging to obtain additional data for\nanalysis by the Navigation Team.  Radio Science Ultra Stable Oscillator\ntesting will take place on Monday .\n\nThe Flight Sequence C9 uplink will occur on Sunday, April 25, with\nactivation at Midnight, Monday evening April 26.  C9 has been modified to\ninclude Magnetometer Calibrations which could not be performed in C8 due\nto Contingency Mode entry on April 9.  These Magnetometer instrument\ncalibrations will allow the instrument team to better characterize the\nspacecraft-generated magnetic field and its effect on their instrument.\nThis information is critical to Martian magnetic field measurements\nwhich occur during approach and mapping phases. MAG Cals will require\nthe sequence to command the spacecraft out of Array Normal Spin state\nand perform slew and roll maneuvers to provide the MAG team data points\nin varying spacecraft attitudes and orientations.

Seems that the Mile-Long Billboard and any other inflateble space\nobject/station or what ever have the same problems. (other than being a little\nbit different than the "normal" space ideas, such as trusses and shuttles)\n\nBut also dag and such.. Why not combine the discussion of how and fesibility to\nthe same topic?\n\nI personnelly liek the idea of a billboard in space. But problem. How do you\nservice it? fly a shuttle/DC-1 to near it and then dismount and "fly" to it?\nOr what?? or havign a special docking section for shuttle/DC-1 docking?\n\nAlso what if the billboard springs a leak? Self sealing and such??\n\n\nJust thinking (okay rambling)..\n\nAlso why must the now inflated billboard, not be covered in the inside by a\nharder substance (such as a polymer or other agent) and then the now "hard"\nbillboard would be a now giant docking structure/space dock/station??

I know "Poker Flats" here in\nAlaska, thou used to be only sounding rockets for Auroral Borealous(sp and\nother northern atmospheric items, is at last I heard being upgraded to be able\nto put sattelites into orbit. \n\nWhy must people in the US be fixed on using NASAs direct resources (Poker Flats\nis runin part by NASA, but also by the Univesity of Alaska, and the Geophysical\nInstitute). Sounds like typical US cultural centralism and protectionism..\nAnd people wonder why we have the multi-trillion dollar deficite(sp).\nYes, I am working on a spell checker..
Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are seen coming equally from all directions.\nHowever, given the number of bright ones, there are too few faint\nones to be consistent with being equally dense for as far\nas we can see--it is as if they are all contained within\na finite sphere (or a sphere with fuzzy edges) with us at the\ncenter.  (These measurements are statistical, and you can\nalways hide a sufficiently small number of a different\ntype of GRB with a different origin in the data.  I am assuming\nthat there is only one population of GRBs).\n\nThe data indicates that we are less than 10% of the radius of the center\nof the distribution.  The only things the Earth is at the exact center\nof are the Solar system (at the scale of the Oort cloud of comets\nway beyond Pluto) and the Universe.  Cosmological theories, placing\nGRBs throughout the Universe, require supernova-type energies to\nbe released over a timescale of milliseconds.  Oort cloud models\ntend to be silly, even by the standards of astrophysics.\n\nIf GRBs were Galactic (i.e. distributed through the Milky Way Galaxy)\nyou would expect them to be either concentrated in the plane of\nthe Galaxy (for a 'disk' population), or towards the Galactic center\n(for a spherical 'halo' population).  We don't see this, so if they\nare Galactic, they must be in a halo at least 250,000 light years in\nradius, and we would probably start to see GRBs from the Andromeda\nGalaxy (assuming that it has a similar halo.)  For comparison, the\nEarth is 25,000 light-years from the center of the Galaxy.\n\n\nThe aren't concentrated in the known spacelanes, and we don't\nsee many coming from Zeta Reticuli and Tau Ceti.\n\n\nThere are more than 130 GRB different models in the refereed literature.\nRight now, the theorists have a sort of unofficial moratorium\non new models until new observational evidence comes in.
"Space Station Redesign Leader Says Cost Goal May Be\nImpossible"\n\nToday (4/6) the Washington Post ran an article with the\nheadline shown above. The article starts with "A leader\nof the NASA team in charge of redesigning the planned\nspace station said yesterday the job is tough and may\nbe impossible." O'Connor is quoted saying whether it is\npossible to cut costs that much and still provide for\nmeaningful research "is a real question for me."\nO'Connor said "everything is fair game," including\n"dropping or curtailing existing contracts with the\naerospace industry, chopping management of the space\nstation program at some NASA facilities around the\ncountry, working closely with the Russian space station\nMir, and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement the\nmanned space shuttle fleet."\n\nO'Connor says his team has reviewed 30 design options\nso far, and they are sorting the serious candidates\ninto three categories based on cost.\n\nThe Post says O'Connor described the design derived\nfrom the current SSF as a high cost option (I believe\nKathy Sawyer, the Post writer, got confused here. I\nlistened in on part of O'Connor's briefing to the press\non Monday, and in one part of the briefing O'Connor\ntalked about how the White House wants three options,\nsorted by cost [low, medium, and high]. In another part\nof the briefing, he discussed the three teams he has\nformed to look at three options [SSF derivative @ LaRC,\nmodular buildup with Bus-1 @ MSFC, and Single Launch\nCore ["wingless Orbiter"] @ JSC. Later, in response to\na reporters question, I thought I heard O'Connor say\nthe option based on a SSF redesign was a "moderate"\ncost option, in between low & high cost options. Not\nthe "high cost" option as Sawyer wrote).\n\nThe article goes on to describe the other two options\nas "one features modules that could gradually be fitted\ntogether in orbit, similar to the Russian Mir. The\nother is a core facility that could be deposited in\norbit in a single launch, like Skylab. That option\nwould use existing hardware from the space shuttle -\nthe fuselage, for example, in its basic structure."
Sterrenkundig symposium 'Compacte Objecten'\n                                             op 26 april 1993\n\n\nIn het jaar 1643, zeven jaar na de oprichting van de\nUniversiteit van Utrecht, benoemde de universiteit haar\neerste sterrenkundige waarnemer. Hiermee ontstond de tweede\nuniversiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld. Aert Jansz, de eerste\nwaarnemer, en zijn opvolgers voerden de Utrechtse sterrenkunde\nin de daaropvolgende jaren, decennia en eeuwen naar de\nvoorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek. Dit jaar is het 350\njaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond.\n\nDe huidige generatie Utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studenten\nsterrenkunde, verenigd in het Sterrekundig Instituut Utrecht,\nvieren de benoeming van hun 'oervader' middels een breed scala\naan feestelijke activiteiten. Zo is er voor scholieren een\nplanetenproject, programmeert de Studium Generale een aantal\nvoordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de Dies\nNatalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt. Er\nstaat echter meer op stapel.\n\nStudenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan een\nsterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. De onderwerpen van het\nsymposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het\nhuidige Utrechtse onderzoek: het onderzoek aan de zogeheten\n'compacte objecten', de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren.\nBij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht de\ndeelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van\nde stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. In de\neerste, inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. Lamers een\nbeknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren,\nwaarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens een\nhalf uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten\nzullen ingaan. Na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tot\nhet stellen van vragen. Het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt op\neen apart vel.\nHet niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaars\nstudenten natuur- en sterrenkunde. OOK ANDERE BELANGSTELLENDEN\nZIJN VAN HARTE WELKOM!\n\nTijdens de lezing van prof. Kuijpers zullen, als alles goed\ngaat, de veertien radioteleskopen van de Radiosterrenwacht\nWesterbork worden ingezet om via een directe verbinding tussen\nhet heelal, Westerbork en Utrecht het zwakke radiosignaal van\neen snel roterende kosmische vuurtoren, een zogeheten pulsar,\nin de symposiumzaal door te geven en te audiovisualiseren.\nProf. Kuijpers zal de binnenkomende signalen (elkaar snel\nopvolgende scherp gepiekte pulsen radiostraling) bespreken en\ntrachten te verklaren.\nHet slagen van dit unieke experiment staat en valt met de\ntechnische haalbaarheid ervan. De op te vangen signalen zijn\nnamelijk zo zwak, dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10\nmiljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30\nWatt een seconde te laten branden! Tijdens het symposium zal\ner niet zo lang gewacht hoeven te worden: de hedendaagse\ntechnologie stelt ons in staat live het heelal te beluisteren.\n\nDeelname aan het symposium kost f 4,- (exclusief lunch) en\nf 16,- (inclusief lunch). Inschrijving geschiedt door het\nverschuldigde bedrag over te maken op ABN-AMRO rekening\n44.46.97.713 t.n.v. stichting 350 JUS. Het gironummer van de\nABN-AMRO bank Utrecht is 2900. Bij de inschrijving dient te\nworden aangegeven of men lid is van de NNV. Na inschrijving\nwordt de symposiummap toegestuurd. Bij inschrijving na\n31 maart vervalt de mogelijkheid een lunch te reserveren.\n\nHet symposium vindt plaats in Transitorium I,\nUniversiteit Utrecht.\n\nVoor meer informatie over het symposium kan men terecht bij\nHenrik Spoon, p/a S.R.O.N., Sorbonnelaan 2, 3584 CA Utrecht.\nTel.: 030-535722.

To All -- I thought the net would find this amusing..\n  \nFrom the March 1993 "Aero Vision" (The newsletter for the Employees\nof McDonnell Douglas Aerospace at Huntington Beach, California).\n  \n  SPACE CLIPPERS LAUNCHED SUCCESSFULLY\n  \n  "On Monday, March 15 at noon, Quest Aerospace Education, Inc.\n  launched two DC-Y Space Clippers in the mall near the cafeteria.\n  The first rocket was launched by Dr. Bill Gaubatz, director and\n  SSTO program manager, and the second by Air Force Captain Ed\n  Spalding, who with Staff Sgt. Don Gisburne represents Air Force\n  Space Command, which was requested by SDIO to assess the DC-X for\n  potential military operational use.  Both rocket launches were\n  successful.  The first floated to the ground between the cafeteria\n  and Building 11, and the second landed on the roof of the\n  cafeteria.\n  \n  Quest's Space Clipper is the first flying model rocket of the\n  McDonnell Douglas DC-X.  The 1/122nd semi-scale model of the\n  McDonnell Douglas Delta Clipper has an estimated maximum altitude\n  of 300 feet.  The Space Clippers can be used in educational\n  settings to teach mathematics and science, as well as social\n  studies and other applications.  The Space Clipper is available\n  either in the $35 Space Clipper outfit, which includes everything\n  needed for three launches, or as individual rockets for $12 each.\n  Both are available through hobby shops or by calling 1-800-858-\n  7302."\n  \nBy the way -- this is not an endorsement to buy the product nor is\nit an advertisement to buy the product.

LARSONIAN Astronomy and Physics\n\n               Orthodox physicists, astronomers, and astrophysicists \n          CLAIM to be looking for a "Unified Field Theory" in which all \n          of the forces of the universe can be explained with a single \n          set of laws or equations.  But they have been systematically \n          IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years! \n\n               The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson's comprehensive \n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he \n          calls the "Reciprocal System", is built on two fundamental \n          postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of \n          space and time: \n    \n               (1) "The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE \n          component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE \n          UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME." \n    \n               (2) "The physical universe conforms to the relations of \n          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are \n          ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN." \n    \n               From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE \n          Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of \n          translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-\n          rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward \n          SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light \n          (which Larson called "UNIT VELOCITY" and "THE NATURAL \n          DATUM"). \n      \n               At each step in the development, Larson was able to \n          MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the \n          REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles \n          [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star \n          clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white \n          dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET \n          DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY \n          BURSTS). \n          \n               And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom, \n          Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-\n          atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility \n          and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of \n          matter. \n\n               All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy \n          complex mathematics, in his books. \n    \n\n\n          BOOKS of Dewey B. Larson\n          \n               The following is a complete list of the late Physicist \n          Dewey B. Larson's books about his comprehensive GENERAL \n          UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe.  Some of the early \n          books are out of print now, but still available through \n          inter-library loan. \n    \n               "The Structure of the Physical Universe" (1959) \n    \n               "The Case AGAINST the Nuclear Atom" (1963)\n    \n               "Beyond Newton" (1964) \n    \n               "New Light on Space and Time" (1965) \n    \n               "Quasars and Pulsars" (1971) \n    \n               "NOTHING BUT MOTION" (1979) \n                    [A $9.50 SUBSTITUTE for the $8.3 BILLION "Super \n                                                            Collider".] \n                    [The last four chapters EXPLAIN chemical bonding.]\n\n               "The Neglected Facts of Science" (1982) \n     \n               "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION" (1984)\n                    [FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL astrophysical\n                                                            mysteries.] \n      \n               "BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER" (1988)\n\n               All but the last of these books were published by North \n          Pacific Publishers, P.O. Box 13255, Portland, OR  97213, and \n          should be available via inter-library loan if your local \n          university or public library doesn't have each of them. \n\n               Several of them, INCLUDING the last one, are available \n          from: The International Society of Unified Science (ISUS), \n          1680 E. Atkin Ave., Salt Lake City, Utah  84106.  This is the \n          organization that was started to promote Larson's Theory.  \n          They have other related publications, including the quarterly \n          journal "RECIPROCITY". \n\n          \n\n          Physicist Dewey B. Larson's Background\n    \n               Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer \n          (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he \n          died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in \n          Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He \n          developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \n          physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE \n          chemical properties based only on the elements used. \n    \n               Larson's lack of a fancy "PH.D." degree might be one \n          reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is \n          NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider \n          to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same \n          time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX \n          physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer, \n          well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC \n          ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC.. \n     \n               Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally \n          test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.  \n          He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER \n          researchers' experimental and observational data.  And in \n          many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER. \n    \n               A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX \n          physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking \n          for a "unified field theory" that works, but have been \n          IGNORING one for over 30 years now! \n    \n               "Modern physics" does NOT explain the physical universe \n          so well.  Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of \n          quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who \n          agree.  And remember that "epicycles", "crystal spheres", \n          "geocentricity", "flat earth theory", etc., ALSO once SEEMED \n          to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG. \n    \n    \n               Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior, \n          was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory, and was (or \n          still is) President of Larson's organization, "THE \n          INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE", and Editor of \n          their quarterly Journal "RECIPROCITY".  He moved to \n          Minneapolis after retiring. \n    \n\n\n          "Super Collider" BOONDOGGLE!\n          \n               I am AGAINST contruction of the "Superconducting Super \n          Collider", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS \n          WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of "scientific" \n          value. \n    \n               Most physicists don't realize it, but, according to the \n          comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist \n          Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY \n          particles ("mesons", "hyperons", ALLEGED "quarks", etc.) \n          which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab, \n          Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are \n          CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly \n          disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible \n          with their environment. \n    \n               A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a \n          few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not \n          seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE \n          CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW! \n    \n               Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3 \n          BILLION cost?!!  Don't we have much more important uses for \n          this WASTED money?! \n    \n     \n               Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed \n          location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some \n          kind of "fire ants" eating the insulation off underground \n          cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water \n          with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of \n          the "Supercollider"?! \n    \n          \n               Naming the "Super Collider" after Ronald Reagon, as \n          proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be \n          named after a leading particle PHYSICIST. \n      \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Anti-Matter\n          \n               In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \n          physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of \n          opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more \n          to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the \n          photons of which they are made, in relation to the \n          vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light, \n          which Larson calls "Unit Velocity" and the "Natural Datum". \n     \n               In Larson's Theory, a positron is actually a particle of \n          MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet, \n          the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their \n          respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each \n          other. \n      \n               In Larson's Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical \n          universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension \n          of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our \n          MATERIAL half. \n       \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Relativity\n          \n               The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury \n          has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the \n          rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this \n          advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational \n          perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, \n          etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to \n          help "prove" Einstein's "General Theory of Relativity". \n    \n               But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results \n          CLOSER to the 43 seconds than "General Relativity" can, by \n          INSTEAD using "SPECIAL Relativity".  In one or more of his \n          books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH \n          ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury. \n    \n               Larson TOTALLY REJECTED "General Relativity" as another \n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of "Special \n          Relativity", including the parts about "mass increases" near \n          the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on \n          doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than \n          1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT, \n          although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.). \n     \n               In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \n          physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead \n          of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured \n          from our material half of the physical universe.  The one \n          dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low \n          relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are \n          NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and \n          the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR. \n          [Larson often used the term "COORDINATE TIME" when writing \n          about this.] \n    \n     \n               In regard to "mass increases", it has been PROVEN in \n          atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near \n          the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is \n          ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists \n          are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson's Theory, \n          mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is \n          actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS \n          BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.  \n          The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward \n          SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of \n          the so-called "Big Bang" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL \n          FANTASY). \n    \n                                    \n          \n          THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\n\n               I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book "THE UNIVERSE \n          OF MOTION", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific \n          Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456 \n          pages, indexed, hardcover. \n    \n               It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL \n          UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that \n          author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago. \n    \n               It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical \n          mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and \n          multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of \n          the "3-degree" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-\n          ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white \n          dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc.. \n    \n               It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL \n          looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with \n          OPEN MINDS! \n    \n               The following is an example of his Theory's success: \n          In his first book in 1959, "THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL \n          UNIVERSE", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING \n          GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding \n          them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson's \n          comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he \n          had an immediate related explanation for them also. \n    \n\n \n          GAMMA-RAY BURSTS\n\n               Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching \n          their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were \n          originally thought to originate from "neutron stars" in the \n          disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in \n          Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions \n          uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT \n          correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of \n          directional coincidence). \n    \n               Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the \n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by \n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of \n          his book "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION", published in 1984, the \n          gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the \n          ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls \n          the "Cosmic Sector".  Because of the relationship between the \n          anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and \n          the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can \n          pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at \n          random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do \n          not correspond with known objects, and come from all \n          directions uniformly.) \n    \n               I wonder how close to us in space a source location \n          would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most \n          life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to \n          stop it! \n    \n               Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which \n          are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were \n          actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS! \n    \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation\n          \n               About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the \n          vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox \n          astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory \n          theory about how they form or why there are so many of them. \n    \n               But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY \n          CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of \n          the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey \n          B. Larson. \n    \n               I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is \n          detailed in Chapter 7 of his book "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION" \n          and in some of his other books. \n    \n               First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate \n          energy by "fusion".  A small fraction comes from slow \n          gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE \n          ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each \n          element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the \n          element is, the lower is this limit.  A star's internal \n          temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and \n          absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually \n          reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and \n          lighter elements. \n    \n               When the internal temperature of the star reaches the \n          destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I \n          SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron \n          present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms \n          and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some \n          of his books [better than I can]. \n    \n               When the star explodes, the lighter material on the \n          outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less \n          than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center \n          portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to \n          the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The \n          explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and \n          it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN \n          SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while. \n    \n               Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall \n          back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown \n          outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The \n          material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a \n          WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward \n          the "MAIN SEQUENCE" from opposite directions on the H-R \n          Diagram. \n    \n               The chances of the two masses falling back into the \n          exact same location in space, making a single lone star \n          again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY \n          system, orbiting each other. \n     \n               According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE \n          DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the \n          material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown \n          outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to \n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about "degenerate matter", "neutron \n          stars", "black holes", etc.. \n    \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Solar System Formation\n\n               If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the \n          exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single \n          white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL "mini" white dwarf \n          stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably \n          still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected \n          by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS! \n      \n               In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all \n          this information, and other principles of his comprehensive \n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive \n          his own version of Bode's Law. \n          \n\n\n          "Black Hole" FANTASY!\n\n               I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently \n          completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO "black \n          holes" merging together into a SINGLE "black hole", and \n          concluded that the new "black hole" would have MORE MASS than \n          the sum of the two original "black holes". \n    \n               Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED \n          FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of "black \n          holes", etc.! \n    \n               After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson's books about \n          his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \n          universe, especially his book "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION", it is \n          clear to me that "black holes" are NOTHING more than \n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is \n          just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the "black \n          hole" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want \n          to "prove" their theory. \n    \n    \n               By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is \n          being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and \n          astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking's severe physical \n          problem somehow makes him "wiser".  It does NOT! \n    \n               I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist \n          Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread \n          publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson's \n          Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of \n          Unified Science). \n          \n          \n          \n          ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION\n\n               I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection \n          with UFO's and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to \n          find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed. \n    \n               I found a possible clue about why they might work on \n          pages 112-113 of the book "BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER", by \n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of \n          Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \n          universe.  I quote one paragraph: \n    \n               "As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development \n          of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally \n          different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.  \n          The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It \n          was brought out in Volume I [Larson's book "NOTHING BUT \n          MOTION"] that there are physical processes in operation which \n          produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that, \n          although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in \n          many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities \n          for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are \n          limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of \n          free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the \n          universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged \n          state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension \n          space, because they are inherently rotating units of space, \n          and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open \n          space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently \n          in the same location with respect to the natural reference \n          system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the \n          stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron, \n          like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by \n          the progression of the natural reference system.  All \n          material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons \n          similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.  \n          Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later, \n          whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The \n          electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth \n          therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level." \n          \n               Note that in Larson's Theory, UNcharged electrons are \n          also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a \n          particular frequency (above the "unit" frequency) spinning \n          around one axis at a particular rate (below the "unit" rate).  \n          ("Unit velocity" is the speed of light, and there are \n          vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light, \n          according to Larson's Theory.)  [I might have the "above" and \n          "below" labels mixed up.] \n    \n               Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-\n          LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of \n          light! \n    \n               If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION \n          fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these \n          electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a \n          charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to \n          achieve propulsion. (In Larson's Theory, an electrical charge \n          is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular \n          frequency (above the "unit" frequency) superimposed on the \n          rotation of the particle.) \n      \n               The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to \n          confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is \n          generated in clouds. \n\n\n\n          SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics\n\n               The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \n          universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has \n          been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in \n          his first book "THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE". \n    \n               It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan, \n          and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call \n          "science" (or "physics", or "astronomy", etc.), as well as \n          the "scientific" literature and the "education" systems, to \n          TOTALLY IGNORE Larson's Theory has they have. \n    \n               Larson's Theory has excellent explanations for many \n          things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such \n          as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars. \n    \n               Larson's Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY \n          discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals, \n          in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles \n          of Larson's Theory should be included in all related courses \n          at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and \n          elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a \n          worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed. \n    \n          \n\n               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., \n          please consult my CITED SOURCES (especially Larson's BOOKS). \n\n\n\n               UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this \n          IMPORTANT partial summary is ENCOURAGED.

In reference to the limits of acceleration with guns launching solid\nrockets as payloads.  Thiokol provided me with samples and data on\na reinforcement to solid motor grains for high accelerations.  Solid\nmotor propellants usually have a substantial percentage of \naluminum in the mix.  For example, the Space Shuttle SRBs are 16 percent\nAluminum.  The technique is to use a 'foamed aluminum' structure.\nThe structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles (an I suspect\nsome bubbling process is used to form it).  In other words, if you made\na bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum, then froze it, this is what\nyou get.  It forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires in\nall directions.  The remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated into\nthe voids, and you get aluminum-reinforced solid propellant.  The\nfoamed-aluminum makes up about 6 percent of the total propellant,\nso there is still aluminum particles in the bulk grain.  The major\nimprovement is the higher resistance to grain cracking, which is the\nprincipal failure mode for solid propellant.\n\nDani Eder

Any comments on the absorbtion of the Office of Exploration into the\nOffice of Space Sciences and the reassignment of Griffin to the "Chief\nEngineer" position?  Is this just a meaningless administrative\nshuffle, or does this bode ill for SEI?\n\nIn my opinion, this seems like a Bad Thing, at least on the surface.\nGriffin seemed to be someone who was actually interested in getting\nthings done, and who was willing to look an innovative approaches to\ngetting things done faster, better, and cheaper.  It's unclear to me\nwhether he will be able to do this at his new position.\n\nDoes anyone know what his new duties will be?\n--\n_______________________________________________________________________________
As an Amateur Radio operator (VHF 2metres) I like to keep up with what is \ngoing up (and for that matter what is coming down too).\n \nIn about 30 days I have learned ALOT about satellites current, future and \npast all the way back to Vanguard series and up to Astro D observatory \n(space).  I borrowed a book from the library called Weater Satellites (I \nthink, it has a photo of the earth with a TIROS type satellite on it.)\n \nI would like to build a model or have a large color poster of one of the \nTIROS satellites I think there are places in the USA that sell them.\nITOS is my favorite looking satellite, followed by AmSat-OSCAR 13 \n(AO-13).\n \nTTYL\n73\nJim

Archive-name: space/intro\nLast-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:10 $\n\n    FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ON SCI.SPACE/SCI.ASTRO\n\n    INTRODUCTION\n\n    This series of linked messages is periodically posted to the Usenet\ngroups sci.space and sci.astro in an attempt to provide good answers to\nfrequently asked questions and other reference material which is worth\npreserving. If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked\nquestions that you would like included in this posting, send email to\nleech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech).\n\n    If you don't want to see the FAQ, add 'Frequently Asked Questions' to\nyour KILL file for this group (if you're not reading this with a newsreader\nthat can kill articles by subject, you're out of luck).\n\n    The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down\nby rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available in\nthe Ames SPACE archive in FAQ/faq<#>.\n\n    Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. The\npoint of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing old\nanswers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressing\nthan rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are provided\nbecause they give more complete information than any short generalization.\n\n    Questions fall into three basic types:\n\n    1) Where do I find some information about space?\n\n    Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask\n    for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS (by email) if you must. There\n    are other sources, use them, too. The net is a place for open ended\n    discussion.\n\n    2) I have an idea which would improve space flight?\n\n    Hope you aren't surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been\n    thought of before. Again, contact a direct individual source for\n    evaluation. NASA fields thousands of these each day.\n\n    3) Miscellanous queries.\n\n    These are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of\n    FAQ postings.\n\n\n    SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE\n\n    Read news.announce.newusers if you're on Usenet.\n    Minimize cross references, [Do you REALLY NEED to?]\n    Edit "Subject:" lines, especially if you're taking a tangent.\n    Send mail instead, avoid posting follow ups. (1 mail message worth\n	100 posts).\n    Internet mail readers: send requests to add/drop to SPACE-REQUEST\n	not SPACE.\n    Read all available articles before posting a follow-up. (Check all\n	references.)\n    Cut down attributed articles (leave only the points you're\n	responding to; remove signatures and headers). Summarize!\n    Put a return address in the body (signature) of your message (mail\n	or article), state your institution, etc. Don't assume the\n	'reply' function of mailers will work.\n    Use absolute dates. Post in a timely way. Don't post what everyone\n	will get on TV anyway.\n    Some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping:\n	keep lines under 80 characters for those using ASCII terminals\n	(use carriage returns).\n\n\n    INDEX TO LINKED POSTINGS\n\n    I've attempted to break the postings up into related areas.

In spite of my great respect for the people you speak of, I think their\ncost estimates are a bit over-optimistic. If nothing else, a working SSTO\nis at least as complex as a large airliner and has a smaller experience\nbase. It therefore seems that SSTO development should cost at least as\nmuch as a typical airliner development. That puts it in the $3G to $5G\nrange.\n\n\nTrue it and the contest would result in a much larger market. But I\ndon't think it would be enough to attract the investors given the\nrisks involved.\n\nIf you could gurantee the SSTO costs and gurantee that it captures\n100% of the available launch market, then I think you could\ndo it.\n\n  Allen
Why do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cuts.  For\nexample, Why couldn't Magellan just be told to go into a "safe"\nmode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if\nmaybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy\ngets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.  \n\nFor that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments\n"turned off" rather than just "safed".  Was it political (i.e.\nas along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging\ncongress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them pesky\nscientists out of the bureaucrat's hair....  \n\nI've heard the argument that an active but "uncontrolled"\nspacecraft causes "radio noise."  I find that hard to believe\nthat this could be a problem in a properly designed "safe" mode.\nThis safe mode could be a program routine which causes the\nspacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a\n(week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth.\nAt that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can\ncontinue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to\nthe safe mode for another time period. As we would know when the\nspacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could be\nprepared if necessary.  \n\nAs another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is\nbeam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it,\ngreat, if not, so it's lost and no big deal.\nBy making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps\nsomeone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the\ndata even if they're not willing to contact the spacecraft.\n\nI see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which\ncould have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to\nplaces which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit,\nexiting the solar system, etc).   \n\nPerhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby,\netc) should consider designing in a "pause" mode in case their\nspacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of\nthe primary mission. Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo could\nhave some kind of routine written in for the post mission\n"drift" phase.\n\nSo any holes in all this?
Other idea for old space crafts is as navigation beacons and such..\nWhy not?? If you can put them on "safe" "pause" mode.. why not have them be\nactivated by a signal from a space craft (manned?) to act as a naviagtion\nbeacon, to take a directional plot on??

------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOcean Reconnaissance Launch Surprises West\nSpace News, April 5-11, 1993, p.2\n[Excerpts]\n     Russia launched its first ocean reconnaissance satellite in 26 months \nMarch 30, confounding Western analysts who had proclaimed the program dead. \n     The Itar-TASS news agency announced the launch of Cosmos 2238 from \nPlesetsk Cosmodrome, but provided little description of the payload's mission. \n     However, based on the satellite's trajectory, Western observers \nidentified it as a military spacecraft designed to monitor electronic \nemissions from foreign naval ships in order to track their movement. \n     Geoff Perry of the Kettering Group in England... [said]  Western \nobservers had concluded that no more would be launched. But days after the \nlast [such] satellite re-entered the Earth's atmosphere, Cosmos 2238 was \nlaunched. \n\n"Cosmos-2238" Satellite Launched for Defense Ministry\nMoscow ITAR-TASS World Service in Russian  1238 GMT 30 March 1993\nTranslated in FBIS-SOV-93-060, p.27\nby ITAR-TASS correspondent Veronika Romanenkova\n     Moscow, 30 March -- The Cosmos-2238 satellite was launched at 1600 Moscow \ntime today from the Baykonur by a "Tsiklon-M" carrier rocket. An ITAR-TASS \ncorrespondent was told at the press center of Russia's space-military forces \nthat the satellite was launched in the interests of the Russian Defense \nMinistry.
From article <C5owCB.n3p@world.std.com>, by tombaker@world.std.com (Tom A Baker):\n\n\nMy understanding is that the 'expected errors' are basically\nknown bugs in the warning system software - things are checked\nthat don't have the right values in yet because they aren't\nset till after launch, and suchlike. Rather than fix the code\nand possibly introduce new bugs, they just tell the crew\n'ok, if you see a warning no. 213 before liftoff, ignore it'.
They recycled a lot of models and theme music for UFO.  Some of the\nconcepts even showed up in SPACE: 1999.
George.\n\n	It's called a democracy.  The majority rules.  sorry.\nIf ytou don't like it, I suggest you modify the constitution to include\na constitutional right to Dark Skies.   The theory of government\nhere is that the majority rules,  except in the nature of fundamental\ncivil rights.   If you really are annoyed,   get some legislation\nto create a dark sky zone,  where in all light emissions are protected\nin the zone.  Kind of like the national radio quiet zone.  Did you\nknow about that?  near teh Radio telescope  observatory in West virginia,\nthey have a 90?????? mile EMCON zone.  Theoretically they can prevent\nyou from running light AC motors, like air conditioners and Vacuums.\nIn practice, they use it mostly to  control  large radio users.
...\n\nHow can you tell they're identical?\n\nYou got one of them "Star Drek: The Next Syndication" neutrino\nscanners?
Well it rolled out two weeks ago. As we speak it is at White Sands getting\nready. I would have called my sources for the latest but they are all out\nof town (in NM).\n\nAs for the future, there is at least $5M in next years budget for work\non SSRT. They (SDIO) have been looking for more funds and do seem to have\nsome. However, SDIO is not (I repeat, is not) going to fund an orbital\nprototype. The best we can hope from them is to 1) keep it alive for\nanother year, and 2) fund a suborbital vehicle which MIGHT (with\nmajor modifications) just make orbit. There is also some money for a\nset of prototype tanks and projects to answer a few more open questions.\n\nBetter news comes from the new Spacelifter effort. The USAF managers of\nthis program are very open to SSTO and will have about $50M next\nyear for studies. This would be enough to bring DC-Y to PDR.\n\nNow not all of this money will go to DC but a good case could be made\nfor spending half on DC.\n\nPublic support is STILL critical. Meet with your Congressperson (I'll\nhelp you do it) and get his/her support. Also call your local media\nans get them to cover the flight tests.\n\n   Allen
I've been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I've \ntranscribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means\ninfallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is \ngranted to copy this without restriction.\n\nNote for newbies:  The Delta Clipper project is geared towards producing a\nsingle staget to orbit, reusable launch vehicle.  The DC-X vehicle is a 1/3\nscale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in SSTO.  It is \ncurrently undergoing tests.  The DC-Y vehicle would be a full scale \nexperimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit.  It has not yet been funded.\n\nOn April 6th, Rocky Nelson of MacDonnell Douglas gave a talk entitled \n"Optimizing Techniques for Advanced Space Missions" here at the University of\nIllinois. Mr Nelson's job involves using software to simulate trajectories and\ndetermine the optimal trajectory within given requirements.  Although he is\nnot directly involved with the Delta Clipper project, he has spent time with \nthem recently, using his software for their applications.  He thus used \nthe DC-Y project for most of his examples.  While I don't think the details\nof implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers (I hope\nthey aren't - I fell asleep during that part), I think that many of you will\nbe interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples.\n\nThe first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar orbit.  The\nmain restriction is that acceleration must remain below 3 Gs.  I assume that\nthis is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints, but I\ndid not verify that.  The Delta Clipper Y version has 8 engines - 4 boosters\nand 4 sustainers.  The boosters, which have a lower isp, are shut down in \nmid-flight.  Thus, one critical question is when to shut them down.  Mr Nelson\nshowed the following plot of acceleration vs time:\n                  ______\n3 G         /|   /      |\n           / |  /       |          As ASCII graphs go, this is actually fairly \n          /  | /        |	   good.  The big difference is that the lines\n2 G      /   |/         |          made by the  /  should be curves which are\n        /               |          concave up.  The data is only approximate, as\n       /                |          the graph wasn't up for very long.\n1 G   /                 |\n                        |\n                        |\n0 G                     |\n\n             ^          ^\n           ~100 sec    ~400 sec\n\n\nAs mentioned before, a critical constraint is that G levels must be kept below\n3.  Initially, all eight engines are started.  As the vehicle  burns fuel the\naccelleration increases.  As it gets close to 3G, the booster engines are \nthrotled back.  However, they quickly become inefficient at low power, so it\nsoon makes more sense to cut them off altogether.  This causes the dip in \naccelleration at about 100 seconds.  Eventually the remaining sustainer engines\nbring the G level back up to about 3 and then hold it there until they cut\nout entirely.\n\nThe engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit.  The trajectory is aimed\nfor an altitude slightly higher than the 100nm desired and the last vestiges of\nair drag slow the vehicle slightly, thus lowering the final altitude to \nthat desired.\n\nQuestions from the audience:  (paraphrased)\n\nQ:  Would it make sense to shut down the booster engines in pairs, rather than\n    all at once?\n\nA:  Very perceptive.  Worth considering.  They have not yet done the simulation.    Shutting down all four was part of the problem as given.\n\nQ:  So what was the final payload for this trajectory?\n\nA:  Can't tell us.  "Read Aviation Leak."  He also apparently had a good \n    propulsion example, but was told not to use it.  \n\nMy question:  Does anyone know if this security is due to SDIO protecting\nnational security or MD protecting their own interests?\n\nThe second example was reentry simulation, from orbit to just before the pitch\nup maneuver.  The biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating, and \nthe parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange.  He showed graphs\nof heating using two different models, to show that both were very similar,\nand I think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very accurate.\nThe end result was that for a polar orbit landing at KSC, the DC-Y would have\nabout 30 degrees of crossrange and would start it's reentry profile about \n60 degrees south latitude.\n\nI would have asked about the landing maneuvers, but he didn't know about that\naspect of the flight profile.

Since the DC-X is to take off horizontal, why not land that way??\nWhy do the Martian Landing thing..  Or am I missing something.. Don't know to\nmuch about DC-X and such..

Why would you want to do that? The goal is to do it cheaper (remember,\nthis isn't government). Instead of leasing an expensive launch pad,\njust use a SSTO and launch from a much cheaper facility.\n\n  Allen
Voyager  has the unusual  luck to be on a stable trajectory out of the\nsolar system.   All it's doing is collecting  fields  data,  and routinely\nsquirting it down.  One of the mariners is also in stable\nsolar orbit,  and still providing similiar  solar data.  \n\nSomething  in a planetary orbit,  is subject to much more complex forces.\n\nComsats, in "stable " geosynch  orbits,  require  almost daily\nstationkeeping operations.   \n\nFor the occasional  deep space bird,  like PFF  after pluto,  sure\nit could be left on  "auto-pilot".  but things like  galileo or\nmagellan,  i'd suspect they need enough  housekeeping that\neven untended they'd  end up unusable after a while.\n\nThe better question  should be.\n\nWhy not transfer  O&M of all birds to a separate agency with continous funding\nto support these kind of ongoing science missions.\n\npat\n\n	When ongoing ops are mentioned,  it seems to  always quote  Operations\nand Data analysis.  how much would it cost to collect the data\nand let it be analyzed  whenever.  kinda like all that landsat data\nthat sat around for 15 years before someone analyzed it for the ozone hole.

The following are my thoughts on a meeting that I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly\nhad with an aide of Sen. Patty Murrays.  We were there to discuss SSTO, and\ncommercial space.  This is how it went...\n\n\n\nAfter receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO,\nI called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) Patty\nMurray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heard\nthe gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour.\nLater in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.\n\nWe got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide,\nwho scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were not\nbozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to \nmake sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.\n\nWell, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talking\nto him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening.\nWe covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.  \nMost of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was another\nwoman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic that\nwe brought up.\n\nBut, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate\naligned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space.\nSo, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to\nLEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming \nfeasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that.\nWe hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourism\npaper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees the\natmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smog\nover L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is \nmore pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to \nunderstanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education \nwhereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out that\nthey havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to other\nfields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday \nwould provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.\n\nWe hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business\nangle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personal\ncommunicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs provided\nin those sectors.\n\nJobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc..\nWe mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.\n\nWe left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order\nto make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.\n\nWe ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are\nproceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that the\nresults from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan),\nand most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts along\nthe lines of lowering the cost to LEO.\n\nIn the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data \nPurchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was VERY interested in it.\nHe asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it,\nand contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actually\nhappen immediatly there.\n\nThe last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we\nknew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that they\ncould feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn't know\nthe answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people who\nreally did know the answers.\n\nThen finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  He\nsaid that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, this\nwould be something that she would be very interested in, although they\ndo have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in the\nstate 1 week out of 6 these days.\n\nAll in all we felt like we did a pretty good job.

No. I estimate a 99 % probability the Gehrels referred to\nis Thomas Gehrels of the Spacewatch project, Kitt Peak observatory.\n\nMaybe in the 24th century they could do gamma ray spectroscopy on\ndistant asteroids with an orbiting observatory, but here in the\nprimitive 20th we have to send a probe there to get gamma ray\nspectroscopy done.\n\n\nYou have the info on Mayan Television yet?

Every aircraft has flight constraints for speed/AOA/power.  When\ngraphed, these define the 'flight envelope' of that aircraft,\npresumably so named because the graphed line encloses (envelopes) the\narea on the graph that represents conditions where the aircraft\ndoesn't fall out of the sky.  Hence, 'pushing the envelope' becomes\n'operating at (or beyond) the edge of the flight (or operational)\nenvelope'. \n\nNote that the envelope isn't precisely known until someone actually\nflies the airplane in those regions -- up to that point, all there are\nare the theoretical predictions.  Hence, one of the things test pilots\ndo for a living is 'push the envelope' to find out how close the\ncorrespondence between the paper airplane and the metal one is -- in\nessence, 'pushing back' the edges of the theoretical envelope to where\nthe airplane actually starts to fail to fly.  Note, too, that this is\ndone is a quite calculated and careful way; flight tests are generally\ncarefully coreographed and just what is going to be 'pushed' and how\nfar is precisely planned (despite occasional deviations from plans,\nsuch as the 'early' first flight of the F-16 during its high-speed\ntaxi tests).\n\nI'm sure Mary can tell you everything you ever wanted to know about\nthis process (and then some).\n\n-- \n"Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live\n in the real world."   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden
Will someone tell an ignorant physicist where the term "Level 5" comes\nfrom? It sounds like the RISKS Digest  equivalent of Large, Extra\nLarge, Jumbo... Or maybe it's like "Defcon 5..."\n\nI gather it means that Shuttle software was developed with extreme\ncare to have reliablility and safety, and almost everything else in\nthe computing world is Level 1, or cheesy dime-store software.  Not\nsurprising.  But who is it that invents this standard, and how come\neveryone but me seems to be familiar with it?

Neil Gehrels is Prof. Tom Gehrels son.

The difficulties of a high Isp OTV include:\nLong transfer times (radiation damage from VanAllen belts for both\n the spacecraft and OTV\nArcjets or Xenon thrusters require huge amounts of power so you have\nto have either nuclear power source (messy, dangerous and source of\nradiation damage) or BIG solar arrays (sensitive to radiation, or heavy)\nthat make attitude control and docking a big pain.\n\nIf you go solar, you have to replace the arrays every trip, with\ncurrent technology. Nuclear power sources are strongly restricted\nby international treaty.\n\nRefueling (even for very high Isp like xenon) is still required and]\nturn out to be a pain.\n\nYou either have to develop autonomous rendezvous or long range teleoperation\nto do docking or    ( and refueling) .\n\nYou still can't do much plane change because the deltaV required is so high!\n\nThe Air Force continues to look at doing things this way though. I suppose\nthey are biding their time till the technology becomes available and\nthe problems get solved.  Not impossible in principle, but hard to\ndo and marginally cheaper than one shot rockets, at least today.\n\nJust a few random thoughts on high Isp OTV's. I designed one once...
The Japanese are still on the learning curve as far as nuclear power goes.\nThis means that unlike the Germans (who do great things all by themselves)\nthe Japanese tie up with foreign companies. The major one is Mitsubishi\n(who else) who have a sharing agreement with GE I think. No chance of a\nnew design.\n\n\nSodium has *lots* of chemical problems. Like it eats stainless steel. Very\nslowly but it gets there in the end. Not what I call a desired property.\nAs for design difficulties, what does sodium do there? It is a bitch and\nit is only its chemical properties (flwed though they are) that means it\ngets used. Two loops? That's not a design problem? Isolation from air and\nwater? That doesn't cause design problems? In comparison BWR's a dream rides!\n\n\nDon't get none of that in a Liquid Sodium Breeder! More steel, more complexity.\n\nJoseph Askew

Exactly. Some of the SPACE:1999 effects remain first-rate even today. \n \n\nLater on, the Andersons tried to shed their reputation as creators of some\nof the worst pseudo-scientific shows in TV history by flying "Into Infinity."\nThis was a one-off thing done as part of BBC's "educational SF" series "The\nDay After Tomorrow." The Anderson episode dealt with a spaceship capable of\nreaching the speed of light ("lightship Altares"), the four-man crew eventually \njourneyed into a black hole and ended up on the far side of the galaxy (I\nthink). I saw this as a 9-year-old back in 1976 and liked it very much, but\nthen again I was a fan of SPACE:1999 so I guess I was easily satisfied in those\ndays:-)\n---\nDoes anyone know if "Into Infinity" has been released on video? I have some\nSPACE:1999 shows on VHS and know that Thunderbirds etc. also are available in\nEngland.

Actually, there are people who will tell you that it *would* be enough\nto do SSTO development, if done privately as a cut-rate operation.  Of\ncourse, they may be over-optimistic.\n\nYou can also assume that a working SSTO would have other applications\nthat would help pay for its development costs.\n\nI'd be inclined to make the prize somewhat larger, but $1G might be enough.
We are not at the end of the Space Age, but only at the end of Its\nbeginning.\n\nThat space exploration is no longer a driver for technical innovation,\nor a focus of American cultural attention is certainly debatable; however,\ntechnical developments in other quarters will always be examined for\npossible applications in the space area and we can look forward to\nmany innovations that might enhance the capabilities and lower the\ncost of future space operations. \n\nThe Dream is Alive and Well.
I know people hate it when someone says somethings like "there was an article \nabout that somewhere a while ago" but I'm going to say it anyway.  I read an\narticle on this subject, almost certainly in Space News, and something like\nsix months ago.  If anyone is really interested in the subject I can probably\nhunt it down given enough motivation.
I hate to pour cold water on this, but currently seawater extracted\nuranium, even using the new, improved fiber absorbers from Japan, is\nabout 20 times more expensive than uranium on the spot market.\nUranium is *very* cheap right now, around $10/lb.  Right now, there\nare mines closing because they can't compete with places like Cigar\nLake in Canada (where the ore is so rich they present safety hazards\nto the mines, who work in shielded vehicles).  Plenty of other sources\n(for example, uranium from phosphate processing) would come on line before\nuranium reached $200/lb.\n\n"Demand and supply balance will collapse" is nonsense.  Supply and\ndemand always balance; what changes is the price.  Is uranium going\nto increase in price by a factor of 20 by the end of the century?\nNot bloody likely.  New nuclear reactors are not being built\nat a sufficient rate.\n\nUranium from seawater is interesting, but it's a long term project, or\na project that the Japanese might justify on grounds of\nself-sufficiency.

Two developments have brought these type of activities back to\nthe forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a\n20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from\nthe Mir Space Station.  While this "Banner" reflector was blank,\nNPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner\nreflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-\nbased video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV\ncommercial, as filmed from the Mir.\n   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the\nsame company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga\nbooster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the "Environmental\nBillboard".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the\nUniversity of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the "Environmental\nBillboard" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to\n804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,\ndeployed by the inflatable 'frame'.\n   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for\nmaintaining the billboard on orbit will carry "ozone reading\nsensors" to "continuously monitor the condition of the Earth's\ndelicate protective ozone layer," according to Mike Lawson, head of\nSMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum\nexposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth's\natmosphere. According to IMI, "as the biodegradable material burns,\nit will release ozone-building components that will literally\nreplenish the ozone layer." The remaining spacecraft will monitor\nthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns\nup and "adds to the ozone supply."\n   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several\nmillions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI\nestimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who\nwatched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising 'unit' cost\n$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being\npromoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996\nSummer Olympics in Atlanta.\n  \nBut back to Brian's questions:\n  \n    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my\nestimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus\n$10-15 M for a launch), then it's probably real.  They are claiming to\ntailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for\noptimum advertising impact so they probably can't piggy back upon\nsomeone else's planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated\nlaunch.  That's a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.\n    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as\nwell.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use\nof launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don't think the\nlegal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,\nand no, I don't really like the idea of this additional light\npollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal\nchallenges and court fights would probably remove any positive\naspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the\nadvertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change\npositive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the\nspace advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an\nidiot?)\n   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it's in a low\nenough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would\nonly be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before\ndawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just\nafter dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that's the time\nof worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still\nbe a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)\n    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There\nwere about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga\nadvertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for\nonly a $500,000 commitment.  I haven't heard of any serious funding\nfor this, but I'm sure they are shopping the venture around looking\nfor some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I\nam confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.\n  \n   And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be\nmy guest.  I don't have posting privileges to that area (or at least\nI don't THINK I do...).\n -------------------------------------------------------------------\n Wales Larrison                            Space Technology Investor

Well, there already is a sulfate process for TiO2 purification.  The\nchlorine process is cleaner, however, and for that reason is achieving\ndominance in the marketplace.\n\nMost Ti is used in pigment, btw (as the oxide), where it replaced\nwhite lead pigment some decades ago.  Very little is reduced to the\nmetal.\n\n\nWhich merely evades the issue of why those lunatics are\nthere at all (and, why their children would want to stay.)
Hello. I am looking for a program (or algorithm) that can be used\nto compute sunrise and sunset times.\n\nI would appreciate any advice.
(excerpts from posting on this topic) \n\n\n(I've seen satellites at midnight - they're not only in twilight.) :o) \n\n\nNow my comments: \n\nI'd like to add that some of the "protests" do not come from a strictly \npractical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for \nresearch activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I \nwould complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may \nnever have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - \nunsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars \nas profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and \na pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time \n- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. \nAny lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  \nWhole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there \nand becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief \nin an afterlife.  \n\nThe Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks \nand Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light \ncrossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people \nis still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating \nthe scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or \nthousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  \nBut there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. \n\nYes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live \nin a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport \ncurrently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The \nimpact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists \nthat has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped \ninto shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life \nforms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels \n(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains \none weekend, "getting away from it all" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, \nmalls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed \nthe hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 \nmiles to the east.  (Their 'security light' didn't help matters \nmuch either.)  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of \nhigh air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. \n\nBut there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't \nfouled in some way.  (I mean they've been TRYING this forever - \nlike, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don't watch \ncommercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, \ntruck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  \nIf ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at \nleast consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last\nbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  \n\nTo be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage \nof HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at \n8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the \nlocal meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I'll be trying to see it \nif I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could \nbe called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky \nwhile complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that \nas it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, \neven if it can't ever be perfectly achieved.
[On the issue of 'burning' nuclear wastes using particle beams...]\n\n\n\nI sometimes wonder if your newsfeed gives you different articles than\neveryone else, Pat.  Just a *few* corrections:\n\n1) I never 'defended' 20kHz power, other than as something reasonable\nto GO LOOK AT.\n\n2) I have also never opposed a *research project* into feasibility of\nthe spalling reactor approach to 'cleaning' nuclear waste -- I simply\ndoubt it could be made to work in the Real World (tm), which ought to\nbecome clear fairly quickly during a research program into feasibility\n(sort of like what happened to 20 kHz power -- it proved to have a\ndown-side that was too expensive to overcome).\n\nI figure 2 things wrong in a single sentence is a high enough fault\ndensity for even you, Pat.\n\n\n\n-- \n"Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live\n in the real world."   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden

You're assuming that their normal rotation carries all areas of the surface\ninto sunlight.  Not so.  Even on Earth, each pole gets several weeks without\nsunlight in mid-winter.  Pluto and Charon have much more extreme axial\ntilt and a much longer orbit.  Pluto's north pole, for example, gets over\na century of darkness followed by over a century of perpetual light.\n\nAt the moment, we're in luck -- Pluto and Charon are just past their\nequinox, when the Sun was just on the horizon at both poles (of each).\nIf we get probes there soon, only the immediate vicinity of one pole\n(on each) will be in long-term shadow.  This will get steadily worse the\nlonger we wait.

What  evidence  indicates that Gamma Ray bursters are very far away?\n\nGiven the enormous  power,  i was just wondering,  what if they are\nquantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by?\n\nWhy would they have to be at  galactic ranges?   \n\nmy own pet theory is that it's  Flying saucers  entering\nhyperspace :-)\n\nbut the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they\nare  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes,  i just wondered\nif any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.
Well they don't export anywhere near 50% of their GNP. Mexico's perhaps\nbut not their own. They actually export around the 9-10% mark. Similar\nto most developed countries actually. Australia exports a larger share\nof GNP as does the United States (14% I think off hand. Always likely to\nbe out by a factor of 12 or more though) This would be immediately obvious\nif you thought about it.\n\n\nIt is their import routes that count. They can do without exports but\nthey couldn't live without imports for any longer than six months if that.\n\n\nToo true!

If I'm not mistaken, this is the usual sort of precaution against loss of\ncommunications.  That timer is counting down continuously; if it ever hits\nzero, that means Galileo hasn't heard from Earth in a suspiciously long\ntime and it may be Galileo's fault... so it's time to go into a fallback\nmode that minimizes chances of spacecraft damage and maximizes chances\nof restoring contact.  I don't know exactly what-all Galileo does in such\na situation, but a common example is to switch receivers, on the theory\nthat maybe the one you're listening with has died.
Also remember that every dollar spent keeping one spacecraft in safe mode\n(probably a spin-stabilized sun-pointing orientation) is a dollar not\nspent on mission analysis for a newer spacecraft.  In order to turn the\nspacecraft back on, you either need to insure that the Ops guys will be\navailable, or you need to retrain a new team.\n\nHaving said that, there are some spacecraft that do what you have proposed.\nMany of the operational satellites Goddard flies (like the Tiros NOAA \nseries) require more than one satellite in orbit for an operational set.\nExtras which get replaced on-orbit are powered into a "standby" mode for\nuse in an emergency.  In that case, however, the same ops team is still\nrequired to fly the operational birds; so the standby maintenance is\nrelatively cheap.\n\nFinally, Pat's explanation (some spacecraft require continuous maintenance\nto stay under control) is also right on the mark.  I suggested a spin-\nstabilized control mode because it would require little power or \nmaintenance, but it still might require some momentum dumping from time\nto time.\n\nIn the end, it *is* a political decision (since the difference is money),\nbut there is some technical rationale behind the decision.

Forwarded from Neal Ausman, Galileo Mission Director\n\n                                GALILEO\n                     MISSION DIRECTOR STATUS REPORT\n                             POST-LAUNCH\n                         April 9 - 15, 1993\n\nSPACECRAFT\n\n1.  On April 9, real-time commands were sent, as planned, to reacquire\ncelestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna (LGA-2)\nswing/Dual Drive Actuator (DDA) hammer activities.\n\n2.  On April 9, the EJ-1 (Earth-Jupiter #1) sequence memory load was uplinked\nto the spacecraft without incident.  This sequence covers spacecraft activity\nfrom April 12, 1993 to June 14, 1993 and includes a window for the Radio Relay\nAntenna (RRA) slew test on April 28, 1993.  The command loss timer was set to\n11 days as a part of this sequence memory load.\n\n3.  On April 12 and 15, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss\ntimer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\n\n4.  On April 12, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer\n(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\nproperly.\n\n5.  On April 12, an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) test was performed to verify\nthe health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experiment\ndata; long term trend analysis is continuing.\n\n6.  On April 14, a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine the\noptimal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when transmitting at 40bps.  Preliminary\nanalysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulation\nindex is near the optimal level.\n\n7.  On April 15, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) and Magnetometer (MAG) instrument.\nPreliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.\n\n8.  On April 15, a periodic RPM (Retro-Propulsion Module) 10-Newton thruster\nflushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushed\nduring the activity.  Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal.\n\n9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant\nchanges (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads\n19 DN (4.3 volts).  The DC measurement reads 111 DN (12.9 volts).  These\nmeasurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special\nanomaly team.\n\n10. The Spacecraft status as of April 15, 1993, is as follows:\n\n       a)  System Power Margin -  60 watts\n       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin\n       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner\n       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 18 degrees\n           off-sun (lagging) and 6 degrees off-earth (leading)\n       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1\n       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within\n           acceptable range\n       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range\n       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,\n           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS\n       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within\n           acceptable range\n       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours\n           Time To Initiation - 260 hours\n\n\nGDS (Ground Data Systems):\n\n1.  Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance test\nfor the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13, 1993, using CTA-21\n(Compatibility Test Area 21).  The purpose of this test was to verify\nthe flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller\n(TGC) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly (TCA).  The TGC/TCA is the replacement\nfor the current Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA).  Seven different telemetry\nrates were run for this test; all ran well on both the MTS (MCCC Telemetry\nSubsystem) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps.  The\n10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the TGC/TCA was\nnot metering the data correctly.  Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTS\ndata from this test are being conducted. MVT (Mission Verification Test) of\nthe TGC/TCA system is expected to begin May 16, 1993.\n\n\nTRAJECTORY\n\n     As of noon Thursday, April 15, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory\nstatus was as follows:\n\n	Distance from Earth         152,606,000 km (1.02 AU)\n	Distance from Sun           277,519,800 km (1.86 AU)\n	Heliocentric Speed          93,400 km per hour\n	Distance from Jupiter       543,973,900 km\n	Round Trip Light Time       17 minutes, 4 seconds\n\n\nSPECIAL TOPIC

I have 19 (2 MB worth!) uuencode'd GIF images contain charts outlining\none of the many alternative Space Station designs being considered in\nCrystal City.  Mr. Mark Holderman works down the hall from me, and can\nbe reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail at\nmholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov.\n\nMark proposed this design, which he calls "Geode" ("rough on the\noutside, but a gem on the inside") or the "ET Strongback with\nintegrated hab modules and centrifuge."  As you can see from file\ngeodeA.gif, it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of much\nof the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  The\nwhite track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte\nManipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS)\npod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting\ncan occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the mass\nproperties of the Station change during assembly.\n\nThe inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because\nit can approach closer to the Station's CG and at a structurally strong\npart of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces are\nlimited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of the\ndocking system.\n\nThe ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additional\nlaunch mass.  We've always had the ability to put an ET into orbit\n(contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we've never\nhad a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to\n(performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventual\nde-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent the\nresidual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit from\nimpact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy a\nKevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating\nthe local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providing\nfurther micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember,\nit supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as the\nnucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.\n\nThe white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment\nGyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be used\nfor gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit system\nwhich can be used at the end of the Station's life to perform a\ncontrolled de-orbit (so we don't kill any more kangaroos, like we\ndid with Skylab).\n\nThe centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could be\nused for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity\non humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device\nfor the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted on\none of the modules, opposite the ET and the solar panels.\n\nThis design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical,\ndata and communication systems, getting leverage from the SSF work\ndone to date.\n\nMark proposed this design at Joe Shea's committee in Crystal City,\nand he reports that he was warmly received.  However, the rumors\nI hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter\nseems more likely.\n\nPlease note that this text is my interpretation of Mark's design;\nyou should see his notes in the GIF files.  \n\nInstead of posting a 2 MB file to sci.space, I tried to post these for\nanon-FTP in ames.arc.nasa.gov, but it was out of storage space.  I'll\nlet you all know when I get that done.\n\n-- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office\n      kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov  (713) 483-4368
I assume that can only be guessed at by the assumed energy of the\nevent and the 1/r^2 law.  So, if the 1/r^2 law is incorrect (assume\nsome unknown material [dark matter??] inhibits Gamma Ray propagation),\ncould it be possible that we are actually seeing much less energetic\nevents happening much closer to us?  The even distribution could\nbe caused by the characteristic propagation distance of gamma rays \nbeing shorter then 1/2 the thickness of the disk of the galaxy.\n\nJust some idle babbling,\n-- \n\n   Jim Batka  | Work Email:  BATKAJ@CCMAIL.DAYTON.SAIC.COM | Elvis is\n              | Home Email:  JBATKA@DESIRE.WRIGHT.EDU      |   DEAD!

Well, lets see....I took a class on this last fall, and I have no\nnotes so I'll try to wing it...  \n        Here's how I understand it. Remember from stellar evolution that \nblack holes and neutron stars(pulsars) are formed from high mass stars,\nM(star)=1.4M(sun).  High mass stars live fast and burn hard, taking\nappoximately 10^5-10^7 years before going nova, or supernova.  In this time,\nthey don't live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane, so any\nof these (if assumed to be the sources of GRB's) will be in the plane of the\ngalaxy.  \n        Then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from the\nvarious satellites around the solar system, (Pioneer Venus has one, either\nPion. 10 or 11, GINGA, and of course BATSE) and we do distribution tests on our\ncatalog.  These tests all  show, that the bursts have an isotropic\ndistribution(evenly spread out in a radial direction), and they show signs of\nhomogeneity, i.e. they do not clump in any one direction.  So, unless we are\nsampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy, we are sampling the UNIVERSE.\nNot cool, if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things.  Now, I\nsuppose you are saying, "Well, we stil only may be sampling from inside the\ndisk."  Well, not necessarily.  Remember, we have what is more or less an\ninterplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay out\nto beyond Pluto(pioneer 11), so we should be able, with all of our detectors de\ntect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite.  Here's an \nanalogy:  You see a plane overhead.  You measure the angle of the plane from\nthe origin of your arbitrary coordinate system.  One of your friends a mile\naway sees the same plane, and measures the angle from the zero point of his\narbitrary system, which is the same as yours.  The two angles are different,\nand you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst, and maybe\nfind a source.  To my knowledge, no one has been able to do this.  \n        I should throw in why halo, and corona models don't work, also.  As I\nsaid before, looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts, (short\ntimescales, high energy) black holes, and pulsars exhibit much of this type of\nbehavior.  If this is the case, as I said before, these stars seem to be bound\nto the disk of the galaxy, especially the most energetic of the these sources.\nWhen you look at a simulated model, where the bursts are confined to the disk,\nbut you sample out to large distances, say 750 mpc, you should definitely see\nnot only an anisotropy towards you in all direction, but a clumping of sources \nin the direction of the  galactic center.  As I said before, there is none of\nthese characteristics.
The "face" is an accident of light and shadow.  There are many "faces" in\nlandforms on Earth; none is artificial (well, excluding Mount Rushmore and\nthe like...).  There is also a smiley face on Mars, and a Kermit The Frog.\n\nThe question of life in a more mundane sense -- bacteria or the like -- is\nnot quite closed, although the odds are against it, and the most that the\nmore orthodox exobiologists are hoping for now is fossils.\n\nThere are currently no particular plans to do any further searches for life.\n\n\nMars Observer, currently approaching Mars, will probably try to get a better\nimage or two of the "face" at some point.  It's not high priority; nobody\ntakes it very seriously.  The shadowed half of the face does not look very\nface-like, so all it will take is one shot at a different sun angle to ruin\nthe illusion.
According to a Software engineering professor here, what was actually rated\nlevel five was an ibm unit which produced part of the software for the shuttle,\nby not means all of it. \n\nInteresting note: 90% of the software development groups surveyed were at\nlevel 1. The ibm shuttle groups was the *only* one at level 5!
But with cheaper fuel from space based sources it will be cheaper to \nreach more orbits than from the ground.\n\nAlso remember, that the presence of a repair/supply facility adds value\nto the space around it. If you can put your satellite in an orbit where it\ncan be reached by a ready source of supply you can make it cheaper and gain\nbenefit from economies of scale.\n\n  Allen

McDonnell Douglas rolls out DC-X\n\n        HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. -- On a picture-perfect Southern\nCalifornia day, McDonnell Douglas rolled out its DC-X rocket ship last\nSaturday.  The company hopes this single-stage rocket technology\ndemonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO)\nrocket ship.\n\n        The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White Sands\nMissile Range in New Mexico this week.  Flight tests will start in\nmid-June.\n\n        Although there wasn't a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast for\nSSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60\nmillion for the DC-X -- can't itself afford to fund full development of a\nfollow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for\na sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister government\nagencies.\n\n        SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs for\norbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  However, recent\nchanges in SDI's political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTO\nless of a priority.  Today, the agency is more interested in using DC-X as\na step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.\n\n        SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies,\nsaid Col.  Simon "Pete" Worden, SDIO's deputy for technology.  But Worden\ndeclined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the\nprogram. "I didn't make colonel by telling my contractors how much money I\nhave available to spend," he quipped at a press conference at McDonnell\nDouglas Astronautics headquarters.\n\n        While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program's orbital\nobjective, agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the "better,\nfaster, cheaper" approach to hardware development.  The agency believes\nthis philosophy can produce breakthroughs that "leapfrog" ahead of\nevolutionary technology developments.\n\n        Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a "build a little, test a\nlittle" approach can produce results on time and within budget.  He said\nthe program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months --\nshowed how today's engineers could move beyond the "miracles of our\nparents' time."\n\n        "The key is management," Worden said. "SDIO had a very light hand\non this project.  We had only one overworked major, Jess Sponable."\n\n        Although the next phase may involve more agencies, Worden said\nlean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be\ncrucial. "It's essential we do not end up with a large management\nstructure where the price goes up exponentially."\n\n        SDIO's approach also won praise from two California members of the\nHouse Science, Space and Technology Committee. "This is the direction\nwe're going to have to go," said Rep.  George Brown, the committee's\nDemocratic chairman. "Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren't\nsustainable....NASA hasn't learned it yet.  SDIO has."\n\n        Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher, Brown's Republican colleague, went further.\nJoking that "a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team,"\nRohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it\nwere left to the civil space agency.\n\n        Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district includes McDonnell\nDouglas, also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional, multi-staged\nrockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. "Let's not\nbuild fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  Let's build a spaceship!"\n\n         Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO's sponsorship, he said the\nprivate sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology.\n\n        McDonnell Douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with its\nC-17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs, were more cautious\nabout a large private secotro commitment. "On very large ventures,\ncompanies put in seed money," said Charles Ordahl, McDonnell Douglas'\nsenior vice president for space systems. "You need strong government\ninvestments."\n\n        While the government and industry continue to differ on funding\nfor the DC-XA, they agree on continuing an incremental approach to\ndevelopment.  Citing corporate history, they liken the process to Douglas\nAircraft's DC aircraft.  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for\nthe DC-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could\neventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).\n\n        Flight tests this summer at White Sands will "expand the envelope"\nof performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  The\nfirst tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticle\ntake-off and landing.  The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to\n5,000 feet.  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000\nfeet.\n\n        Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.  The final\ntests will include a "pitch-over" manever that rotates the vehicle back\ninto a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing.\n\n        The flight test series will be supervised by Charles "Pete"\nConrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing.\nNow a McDonnell Douglas vice president, Conrad paised the vehicles\naircraft-like approach to operations.  Features include automated\ncheck-out and access panels for easy maintainance.\n\n        If the program moves to the next stage, engine technology will\nbecome a key consideration.  This engine would have more thrust than the\nPratt & Whitney RL10A-5 engines used on the DC-X.  Each motor uses liquid\nhydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds of\nthrust\n\n        Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages, the A-5 model\nhas a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-on\nthrottling capability.  It also is designed for repeat firings and rapid\nturnaround.\n\n        Worden said future single-stage rockets could employ\ntri-propellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet Union.\nThe resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and\nthen switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes.

Thanks for the information!\n\nI assume p is the semi-major axis and e the eccentricity.  The peri-\nhelion and aphelion are then given by p(1-e) and p(1+e), i.e., about\n2.90 and 3.95 AU respectively.  For Jupiter, they are 4.95 and 5.45 AU.\nIf 1977 was after the temporary capture, this means that the comet\nended up in an orbit that comes no closer than 1 AU to Jupiter's --\nwhich I take to be a rough indication of how far from Jupiter it could\nget under Jupiter's influence.\n\n\nWhere 1 Jupiter radius = 71,000 km = 44,000 mi = 0.0005 AU.  So the\n1970 figure seems unlikely to actually be anything but a perijove.\nIs that the case for the 1973 figure as well?\n-- \nMark Brader, SoftQuad Inc., Toronto		"Remember the Golgafrinchans"\nutzoo!sq!msb, msb@sq.com					-- Pete Granger
If gamma ray bursters are extragalactic, would absorption from the\ngalaxy be expected?  How transparent is the galactic core to gamma\nrays?\n\nHow much energy does a burster put out?  I know energy depends on\ndistance, which is unknown.  An answer of the form _X_ ergs per\nmegaparsec^2 is OK.
I've heard of sillier things, like a well-known utility company\nwanting to buy an 'automated' boiler-cleaning system which uses as many\noperators as the old system, and which rumour has it costs three million\nmore per unit.

a\n\nWhat about positional uncertainties in S-L 1993e?   I assume we know where\nand what Galileo is doing within a few meters.   But without the\nHGA,  don't we have to have some pretty good ideas, of where to look\nbefore imaging?  If the HGA was working,  they could slew around\nin near real time (Less speed of light delay).  But when they were\nimaging toutatis????  didn't someone have to get lucky on a guess to\nfind the first images?   \n\nAlso, I imagine S-L 1993e will be mostly a visual image.  so how will\nthat affect the other imaging missions.  with the LGA,  there is a real\ntight allocation of bandwidth.   It may be premature to hope for answers,\nbut I thought i'd throw it on the floor.

SEI Level 5 (the highest level -- the SEI stands for Software\nEngineering Institute).  I'm not sure, but I believe that this rating\nonly applies to the flight software.  Also keep in mind that it was\n*not* achieved through the use of sophisticated tools, but rather\nthrough a 'brute force and ignorance' attack on the problem during the\nChallenger standdown - they simply threw hundreds of people at it and\ndid the whole process by hand.  I would not consider receiving a 'Warning'\nstatus on systems which are not yet in use would detract much (if\nanything) from such a rating -- I'll have to get the latest copy of\nthe guidelines to make sure (they just issued new ones, I think).\n\nAlso keep in mind that the SEI levels are concerned primarily with\ncontrol of the software process; the assumption is that a\nwell controlled process will produce good software.  Also keep in mind\nthat SEI Level 5 is DAMNED HARD.  Most software in this country is\nproduced by 'engineering practicies' that only rate an SEI Level 1 (if\nthat). \n\n-- \n"Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live\n in the real world."   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden
If Comet Shoemaker-Levy 1993e is in Jovian orbit, and if the comet\nis still hanging around when Galileo arrives, then I'm sure it will\nbe added to the list of targets.

It probably won't be too much different than\nwhat was done with Gaspra.\n\n\nGalileo did not image Toutatis.  That came from Earth-based radar.

In fact, you probably want to avoid US Government anything for such a\nproject.  The pricetag is invariably too high, either in money or in\nhassles.\n\nThe important thing to realize here is that the big cost of getting to\nthe Moon is getting into low Earth orbit.  Everything else is practically\ndown in the noise.  The only part of getting to the Moon that poses any\nnew problems, beyond what you face in low orbit, is the last 10km --\nthe actual landing -- and that is not immensely difficult.  Of course,\nyou *can* spend sagadollars (saga- is the metric prefix for beelyuns\nand beelyuns) on things other than the launches, but you don't have to.\n\nThe major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply (for\nmore than a brief visit, at least) is low-cost transport to Earth orbit.\nFor what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs, you can develop\na new launch system that will be considerably cheaper.  (Delta Clipper\nmight be a bit more expensive than this, perhaps, but there are less\nambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.)  Any plan for doing\nsustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting\nmoney in a big way.\n\nGiven this, questions like whose launch facilities you use are *not* a\nminor detail; they are very important to the cost of the launches, which\ndominates the cost of the project.

nsmca> So some of my ideas are a bit odd, off the wall and such, but\nnsmca> so was Wilbur and Orville Wright, and quite a few others..\n\nThis is a common misconception.  There was nothing "off the wall"\nabout the Wright Brothers.  They were in correspondance with a number\nof other experimenters (Octave Chanute, Lillienthal, etc), they flew\nmodels, they had a wind tunnel.  In short, they were quite mainstream\nand were not regarded as odd or eccentric by the community.\n\nI suggest you read The Bishop's Boys or the biography by Harry Gates?\nCombs?  (I can never remember which it is--the guy that had the FBOs\nand owned Learjet for a while).  These are both in print and easily\nobtainable.  The Bishop's Boys is in trade paperback, even.\n\nEven better would be the multi-volume set of the Wrights' writings,\nbut this is out of print, rare, and hideously expensive.
There was a recession, and none of the potential entrants could raise any\nmoney.  The race organizers were actually supposed to be handling part of\nthe fundraising, but the less said about that the better.
The European Space Agency has involvement with remote earth \nobservation, and I presume this includes surveillance (optical etc.).\nSo it's not just the US/USSR(ex) who are in the game.\n\nBut what *is* the game? What can be done with space observation?\nThe military functions of missile spotting, troop spotting etc. are well\ndocumented, but what about anything else?\n\nThe biggest eg I can think of is to get a  metal sensing sat over a\npaying country and scan their territory for  precious metals.\n\nMore importantly, if radar can spot water vapour (clouds), presumably\na radar based sat will be capable of spotting rivers,open water and \n*underground water* from space. This would be a positive life saver\nfor African or other drought affected countries. Implementing a\nclean water and irrigation program would be of imense benifit to such\ncountries and should cut down mortalities considerably.\n\nSo how about it? Is there a charity or government agency that would\npay for a third world country to have their minerals and water deposits\nmapped?\n\nOr is this still sci-fi?\n\nMail replies would be great.\n\nThought for the day: Thermal energy needs water to make steam so sstick\nit in the ocean!
Just a pointer to the article in the current Science News article\non Federal R&D funding.\n\nVery briefly, all R&D is being shifted to gaining current \ncompetitive advantage from things like military and other work that\ndoes not have as much commercial utility.
I have a nice quote that I like (or as close as I can remember it).\n\nIf I say something that you think is crazy, ask me what I mean before you think\nits crazy.. \n\nSo some of my ideas are a bit odd, off the wall and such, but so was Wilbur and\nOrville Wright, and quite a few others.. Sorry if I do not have the big degrees\nand such, but I think (I might be wrong, to error is human) I have something\nthat is in many ways just as important, I have imagination, dreams. And without\ndreams all the knowledge is worthless.. \n\nSorry my two cents worth. Or is it two rubles worth?\n\nThe basic quote idea is from H. Beam Pipers book "Space Vikings". Its a good\nbook on how civilization can fall, and how it can be raised to new heights.
Apollo was done the hard way, in a big hurry, from a very limited\ntechnology base... and on government contracts.  Just doing it privately,\nrather than as a government project, cuts costs by a factor of several.
Well, we got some responses and are doing some interviews with interesting\nresponders. However, just in case the other posting was overlooked by an\nincredibly talented person ... Mea Culpa for posting this here for Mike,\nbut we're looking for someone special:\n\n   Tandem Computers is currently looking for a software wizard to help\n us architect & implement a fault-tolerant generalized instrumentation\n subsystem as part of our proprietary operating system kernel (TNS\n Kernel). The TNS Kernel is a proprietary, loosely-coupled parallel,\n message-based operating system. The TNS Kernel has wide connectivity\n to open standards.\n   In this key individual contributor role, you will work with other\n developers working on various components of the Transaction Management\n Facility.\n   Your background needs to encompass some of the following 4 categories\n (3 of 4 would be excellent):\n   Category 1.

Archive-name: space/astronaut\nLast-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:02 $\n\nHOW TO BECOME AN ASTRONAUT\n\n    First the short form, authored by Henry Spencer, then an official NASA\n    announcement.\n\n    Q. How do I become an astronaut?\n\n    A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it's probably\n    impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying\n    passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have\n    so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you're better off hoping to\n    win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet\n    experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you\n    want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle "mission\n    specialist".\n\n    If you aren't a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that,\n    the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly\n    exceeds the supply.  NASA's problem is not finding qualified people,\n    but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.	It is not enough\n    to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason,\n    many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.\n\n    Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands\n    dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer\n    programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-\n    seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in\n    another seems to be a frequent winner.\n\n    Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight.	(DO NOT get a\n    radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows\n    what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term\n    effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other\n    significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical,\n    you should be okay; if you can't, your chances are poor.\n\n    Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in\n    appearance and actions; you've got a tough selling job ahead, trying\n    to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you\n    are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you\n    will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is\n    a significant part of the job, and NASA's image is very prim and\n    proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie.\n    Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point,\n    and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.\n    Keep your nose clean.\n\n    Get a pilot's license and make flying your number one hobby;\n    experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.\n\n    Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988,\n    43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were\n    a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut).\n    If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job\n    at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant "you\n    do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first".\n\n    Think space:  they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance\n    to demonstrate motivation.\n\n    Keep trying.  Many astronauts didn't make it the first time.\n\n\n\n\n    NASA\n    National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n    Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center\n    Houston, Texas\n\n    Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates\n    ==================================================================\n\n    Astronaut Candidate Program\n    ---------------------------\n\n    The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a need for\n    Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates\n    to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a\n    continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.\n\n    Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be\n    considered.\n\n    All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in\n    Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation\n    program.\n\n    Space Shuttle Program Description\n    ---------------------------------\n\n    The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated\n    that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming\n    routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in\n    the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then\n    returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and\n    flight crew.\n\n    The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment\n    and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation\n    of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials\n    processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will\n    eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space\n    station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher\n    orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space\n    Shuttle's capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include\n    government agencies and private industries.\n\n    The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,\n    and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are\n    assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA\n    astronauts.\n\n    Pilot Astronaut\n\n    Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.\n    During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,\n    crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the\n    commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the\n    pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing\n    the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other\n    payload operations.\n\n    Mission Specialist Astronaut\n\n    Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,\n    have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations\n    in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and\n    experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to\n    have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed\n    knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and\n    objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the\n    experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission\n    specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling\n    using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific\n    experimental operations.\n\n    Astronaut Candidate Program\n    ===========================\n\n    Basic Qualification Requirements\n    --------------------------------\n\n    Applicants MUST meet the following minimum requirements prior to\n    submitting an application.\n\n    Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidate:\n\n    1. Bachelor's degree from an accredited institution in engineering,\n    biological science, physical science or mathematics. Degree must be\n    followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible,\n    professional experience. An advanced degree is desirable and may be\n    substituted for part or all of the experience requirement (master's\n    degree = 1 year, doctoral degree = 3 years). Quality of academic\n    preparation is important.\n\n    2. Ability to pass a NASA class II space physical, which is similar to a\n    civilian or military class II flight physical and includes the following\n    specific standards:\n\n	 Distant visual acuity:\n	      20/150 or better uncorrected,\n	      correctable to 20/20, each eye.\n\n	 Blood pressure:\n	      140/90 measured in sitting position.\n\n    3. Height between 58.5 and 76 inches.\n\n    Pilot Astronaut Candidate:\n\n    1. Bachelor's degree from an accredited institution in engineering,\n    biological science, physical science or mathematics. Degree must be\n    followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible,\n    professional experience. An advanced degree is desirable. Quality of\n    academic preparation is important.\n\n    2. At least 1000 hours pilot-in-command time in jet aircraft. Flight\n    test experience highly desirable.\n\n    3. Ability to pass a NASA Class I space physical which is similar to a\n    military or civilian Class I flight physical and includes the following\n    specific standards:\n\n	 Distant visual acuity:\n	      20/50 or better uncorrected\n	      correctable to 20/20, each eye.\n\n	 Blood pressure:\n	      140/90 measured in sitting position.\n\n    4. Height between 64 and 76 inches.\n\n    Citizenship Requirements\n\n    Applications for the Astronaut Candidate Program must be citizens of\n    the United States.\n\n    Note on Academic Requirements\n\n    Applicants for the Astronaut Candidate Program must meet the basic\n    education requirements for NASA engineering and scientific positions --\n    specifically: successful completion of standard professional curriculum\n    in an accredited college or university leading to at least a bachelor's\n    degree with major study in an appropriate field of engineering,\n    biological science, physical science, or mathematics.\n\n      The following degree fields, while related to engineering and the\n    sciences, are not considered qualifying:\n      - Degrees in technology (Engineering Technology, Aviation Technology,\n	Medical Technology, etc.)\n      - Degrees in Psychology (except for Clinical Psychology, Physiological\n	Psychology, or Experimental Psychology which are qualifying).\n      - Degrees in Nursing.\n      - Degrees in social sciences (Geography, Anthropology, Archaeology, etc.)\n      - Degrees in Aviation, Aviation Management or similar fields.\n\n    Application Procedures\n    ----------------------\n\n    Civilian\n\n    The application package may be obtained by writing to:\n\n	NASA Johnson Space Center\n	Astronaut Selection Office\n	ATTN: AHX\n	Houston, TX 77058\n\n    Civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis. When NASA\n    decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be\n    given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is\n    made. Applications received after that date will be retained and\n    considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually\n    of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate\n    continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants\n    who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from\n    consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the\n    preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be\n    requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as\n    supervisors and references may be contacted.\n\n    Active Duty Military\n\n    Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their\n    respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application\n    procedures will be disseminated by each service.\n\n    Selection\n    ---------\n\n    Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required\n    for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.\n    Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered\n    will be notified of the outcome of the process.\n\n    Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the\n    selection of additional candidates during a one year period following\n    their establishment.\n\n    General Program Requirements\n\n    Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be\n    assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston,\n    Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and\n    evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or\n    scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to\n    ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut\n    training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills\n    required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot\n    astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during\n    their candidate period.\n\n    Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does\n    not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut\n    will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and\n    evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the\n    training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become\n    permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for\n    a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not\n    selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA\n    depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that\n    time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a\n    specified tour of duty.\n\n    NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified\n    minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates.\n    Therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.\n\n    Pay and Benefits\n    ----------------\n\n    Civilians\n\n    Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal\n    Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS-11 through GS-14,\n    and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements\n    and experience.\n\n    Other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and\n    participation in group health and life insurance plans.\n\n    Military\n\n    Selected military personnel will be detailed to the Johnson Space Center\n    but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and\n    other similar military matters.

Some time ago I sent the following message:\n   Every once in a while I design an orbital space colony.  I'm gearing up to\n   do another one.  I'd some info from you.

Dennis, I have worked on or written proposals worth tens of millions\nof $$. Customers included government (including NASA), for profit and\nnon-profit companies. All expected a wrap (usually called a fee). Much\nof the work involved allocating and costing the work of subcontractors.\nThe subcontractors where universities, for-profits, non-profits, and\neven some of the NASA Centers for the Commercialization of Space. ALL\ncharged fees as part of the work. Down the street is one of the NASA\ncommercialization centers; they charge a fee.\n\nNow, I'm sure your a competent engineer Dennis, but you clearly lack\nexperience in several areas. Your posts show that you don't understand\nthe importance of integration in large projects. You also show a lack\nof understanding of costing efforts as shown by your belief that it\nis reasonable to charge incremental costs for everything. This isn't\na flame, jsut a statement.\n\nYour employer DOES charge a fee. You may not see it but you do.\n\n\n\nWell there you are Dennis. As I said, they simply include the fee in\ntheir overhead. Many seoparate the fee since the fee structure can\nchange depending on the customer.\n\n\nIntegration, Dennis, isn't overhead.\n\n\nDennis, Reston has been the only NASA agency working to reduce costs. When\nWP 02 was hemoraging out a billion $$, the centers you love so much where\ndoing their best to cover it up and ignore the problem. Reston was the\nonly place you would find people actually interested in solving the\nproblems and building a station.\n\n\nWhen you have a bit more experience Dennis, you will realize that\nintegration isn't overhead. It is the single most important part\nof a successful large scale effort.\n\n\nThe story you refer to said that some NASA people blamed it on\nCongress. Suprise suprise. The fact remains that it is the centers\nyou support so much who covered up the overheads and wouldn't address\nthe problems until the press published the story.\n\nAre you saying the Reston managers where wrong to get NASA to address\nthe overruns? You approve of what the centers did to cover up the overruns?\n\n\nYou should know Dennis that NASA doesn't include transport costs for\nresuply. That comes from the Shuttle budget. What they where saying\nis that operational costs could be cut in half plus transport.\n\n\nI do hope you can find the time to tell us just why it was wrong of\nReston to ask that the problems with WP 02 be addressed.\n\n  Allen
I like option C of the new space station design.. \nIt needs some work, but it is simple and elegant..\n\nIts about time someone got into simple construction versus overly complex...\n\nBasically just strap some rockets and a nose cone on the habitat and go for\nit..\n\nMight be an idea for a Moon/Mars base to..
There are no Mariner craft from which we are still receiving data.  I believe\nyou are referring to one or more of Pioneers 6 through 9 (launched from\nDecember 1965 through November 1968), which were put into solar orbits to study\ninterplanetary space.  I recall reading that at least one of them was still\nfunctioning 25 years after launch.
I was suggesting that the minority of professional and amateur astronomers\nhave the right to a dark, uncluttered night sky.\n\nLet me give you an example.  When you watch TV, they have commercials to pay\nfor the programming.  You accept that as part of watching.  If you don't like\nit, you can turn it off.  If you want to view the night sky, and there is a\nfloating billboard out there, you can't turn it off.  It's the same \nreasoning that limits billboards in scenic areas.\n\nGeorge.\n\n	It's called a democracy.  The majority rules.  sorry.\nIf ytou don't like it, I suggest you modify the constitution to include\na constitutional right to Dark Skies.   The theory of government\nhere is that the majority rules,  except in the nature of fundamental\ncivil rights.\n\nI say: \n	Any reasonably in-depth perusal of American history will show\n	you that many WASPs have continued the practices of prejudice,\n	discrimination, and violence against others of different\n	races, religions, and beliefs, despite the law.\n\nIf you really are annoyed,   get some legislation\nto create a dark sky zone,  where in all light emissions are protected\nin the zone.  Kind of like the national radio quiet zone.  Did you\nknow about that?  near teh Radio telescope  observatory in West virginia,\nthey have a 90?????? mile EMCON zone.  Theoretically they can prevent\nyou from running light AC motors, like air conditioners and Vacuums.\nIn practice, they use it mostly to  control  large radio users.\n\nI say:\nWhat I'm objecting to here is a floating billboard that, presumably,\nwould move around in the sky.  I, for one, am against legislating\nat all.  I just wish that people had a bit of common courtesy, and\nwould consider how their greed for money impacts the more ethereal and\naesthetic values that make us human.  This includes the need for wild\nand unspoiled things, including the night sky.\n\nGeorge
I once thought it would be easiest fitting a sine to the times. But not.\nThis gave  discrepancy of upto six minutes. If you fit a sine series\nyou'll get a very good fit after just three or four terms though. This\npresumably has to do with the eccentricity of the Earths orbit.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nWow! I knew Uranus is a long way off, but I didn't think it was THAT far away!
I was assuming that there won't be a moon base unless it makes a\nprofit, actually.  If it does, well, that gives a larger GNP which\nleads to being able to spend more money on your military, including\ngosh-wow space stuff.  (assuming it's profitable, rather than paying\nfor itself.)\n\nYou might be able to _run_ one for that; put it there, hardly.\n\nWhy do you think at least a couple centuries before there will\nbe significant commerical activity on the Moon?
Could you use some sort of mechanical chest compression as an aid.\nSorta like the portable Iron Lung?   Put some sort of flex tubing\naround the 'aquanauts' chest.  Cyclically compress it  and it will\npush enough on the chest wall to support breathing?????\n\nYou'd have to trust your breather,  but in space, you have to trust\nyour suit anyway.
Even worse, the city of Atlanta has a proposal before it to rent space on this\norbiting billboard.  Considering the caliber of people running this city, \nthere's no telling what we're going to have leering down at us from orbit.
If the  new  Kuiper belt object *is*  called 'Karla', the next\none  should be called 'Smiley'.
That would not explain why widely separated detectors, such as on Ulysses\nand PVO and Ginga et al., would see a burst at the same time(*).  In fact, be-\nfore BATSE, having this widely separated "Interplanetary Network" was the\nonly sure way to locate a random burst.  With only one detector, one cannot\nlocate a burst (except to say "It's somewhere in the field of view.").  With\ntwo detectors, one can use the time that the burst is seen in each detector\nto narrow the location to a thin annulus on the sky.  With three detectors,\none gets intersecting annuli, giving two possible locations.  If one of these\nlocations is impossible (because, say, the Earth blocked that part of the \nsky), voila, you have an error box.\n\nBATSE, by having 8 detectors of its own, can do its own location determination,\nbut only to within about 3 degrees (would someone at GSFC, like David, like\nto comment on the current state of location determination?).  Having inde-\npendent sightings by other detectors helps drive down the uncertainty.\n\nYou did touch on something that you didn't mean to, though.  Some believe\n(in a reference that I have somewhere) that absorption-like features seen\nin a fraction of GRBs can actually be caused by the detector.  It would be\na mean, nasty God, though, that would have a NaI crystal act like a 10^12 Gauss\nneutron star...but this is getting too far afield.

I believe the reason is that the lung diaphram gets too tired to pump\nthe liquid in and out and simply stops breathing after 2-3 minutes.\nSo if your in the vehicle ready to go they better not put you on \nhold, or else!! That's about it. Remember a liquid is several more times\nas dense as a gas by its very nature. ~10 I think, depending on the gas\nand liquid comparision of course!

Did the Russian spacecraft(s) on the ill-fated Phobos mission a few\nyears ago send back any images of the Martian moon?  If so, does anyone know if\nthey're housed at an ftp site?\n  Thanks.
Thanks Ron and Peter for some very nice maps.\n\nI have an advice though.  You wrote that the maps were reduced to 256\ncolors.

From the article "What's New" Apr-16-93 in sci.physics.research:\n\n........\nWHAT'S NEW (in my opinion), Friday, 16 April 1993  Washington, DC\n\n1. SPACE BILLBOARDS! IS THIS ONE THE "SPINOFFS" WE WERE PROMISED?\nIn 1950, science fiction writer Robert Heinlein published "The\nMan Who Sold the Moon," which involved a dispute over the sale of\nrights to the Moon for use as billboard. NASA has taken the firsteps toward this\n hideous vision of the future.  Observers were\nstartled this spring when a NASA launch vehicle arrived at the\npad with "SCHWARZENEGGER" painted in huge block letters on the\nside of the booster rockets.  Space Marketing Inc. had arranged\nfor the ad to promote Arnold's latest movie. Now, Space Marketing\nis working with University of Colorado and Livermore engineers on\na plan to place a mile-long inflatable billboard in low-earth\norbit.  NASA would provide contractual launch services. However,\nsince NASA bases its charge on seriously flawed cost estimates\n(WN 26 Mar 93) the taxpayers would bear most of the expense. This\nmay look like environmental vandalism, but Mike Lawson, CEO of\nSpace Marketing, told us yesterday that the real purpose of the\nproject is to help the environment! The platform will carry ozone\nmonitors he explained--advertising is just to help defray costs.\n..........\n\nWhat do you think of this revolting and hideous attempt to vandalize\nthe night sky? It is not even April 1 anymore.\nWhat about light pollution in observations? (I read somewhere else that\nit might even be visible during the day, leave alone at night).\nIs NASA really supporting this junk?\nAre protesting groups being organized in the States?\nReally, really depressed.\n\n             Enzo
Hi all,\n\n    I'm trying to get mailing addresses for the following\ncompanies.  Specifically, I need addresses for their personnel\noffices or like bureau.  The companies are:\n\n	- AMROC\n	- Orbital Sciences Corp. (sp?)\n	- Spacehab, Inc.  (I know this one is somewhere in \n		 	   Seattle, WA, or at least part of it is.)\n	- Space Industries, Inc.  (Somewhere in Houston)\n	- Space Enterprises Inc.\n\nIf anybody could point me in the right direction on this, I\nwould be most appreciative.  I prefer an email response, but I\nwill post a summary if sufficient interest exists.\n\nThanks,
If you are really interested in these orbits and how they are obtained\nyou should try and find the following paper:\n\n     Hiroshi Yamakawa, Jun'ichiro Kawaguchi, Nobuaki Ishii, \n     and Hiroki Matsuo, "A Numerical Study of Gravitational Capture\n     Orbit in the Earth-Moon System," AAS-92-186, AAS/AIAA Spaceflight\n     Mechanics Meeting, Colorado Springs, Colorado, 1992.\n\nThe references included in this paper are quite interesting also and \ninclude several that are specific to the HITEN mission itself.
Wishful thinking mostly. It's more likely that the Moon will never\nbe the site of major commercial activity. As far as we know it has no\nmaterials we can't get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids\nand comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in low\ngrade fusion reactors. Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch, \nand it's position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it's heat \nsink capacity could offer some military utility for "high ground" military\nweapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. If space \ntravel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as \nMt. Everest and the Antarctic have become, but that's a very minor \nactivity in the global scope of things.\n\nLuna has an inconvienent gravity field. It's likely too low to prevent\ncalcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. Yet it's\ntoo high to do micro-G manufacturing. Space based colonies and factories\nthat can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Luna\nhas a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbital\nsites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offers\na source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink,\nand shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and\nheavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravity\nwells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.\n\nWe don't use 2/3rds of the Earth now, the seafloors, and we virtually\nignore Antarctica, a whole continent. That's because we don't have to\ndeal with those conditions in order to make a buck. Luna is a much more\nexpensive place to visit, or to live and work. I think we'll use the\neasier places first. That pushes Lunar development back at least a few\ncenturies, if not much longer.\n\nLuna's main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio\nastronomy observatory, shielded from the noisy Earth. Or as the site\nof a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system for\ndefending Earth, or bombarding it as the case may be. The first is\nunlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument.\nThe second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good\nenough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe for\nconventional warfare again. There's little glory in watching from a\nbunker as machines fight each other over continental ranges. Little\nultimate profit either.\n\nGary
The following press release was distributed April 1 by\nNASA Headquarters.\n\nSpace Station Redesign Advisory Members Named\n\nAlong with Dr. Charles M. Vest, recently named by Vice President\nAlbert Gore to head the advisory committee on the redesign of the\nSpace Station, NASA has announced the names of representatives\nfrom government and industry and academic experts from across the\ncountry to participate in an independent review of the redesign\noptions being developed by NASA.\n\n"I am extremely honored to have been selected to lead this\nimportant review panel. America's future in science and\ntechnology and as a world leader in space demands our utmost\nattention and care," said Vest. "We have assembled a diverse\npanel of experts that, I believe, will bring the appropriate\nmeasures of insight, integrity and objectivity to this critical\ntask."\n\nThe advisory committee is charged with independently assessing\nvarious redesign options of the space station presented by NASA's\nredesign team, and proposing recommendations to improve\nefficiency and effectiveness of the space station program. Space\nstation international partners also are being asked to \nparticipate and will be named at a later date. The advisory\ncommittee will submit its recommendations in June.\n\nAdvisory committee members named today include:\n\nDr. Charles Vest              Dr. Bobby Alford\nPresident, MIT                Executive VP & Dean of Medicine\n                              Baylor College of Medicine\n\nMr. Jay Chabrow               Dr. Paul Chu\nPresident, JMR Associates     Director, Texas Center for\n                              Superconductivity\n                              University of Houston\n\nDr. Ed Crawley                Dr. John Fabian\nProf of Aero & Astro          President & CEO\nMIT                           ANSER\n\nMaj.

Their Hiten engineering-test mission spent a while in a highly eccentric\nEarth orbit doing lunar flybys, and then was inserted into lunar orbit\nusing some very tricky gravity-assist-like maneuvering.  This meant that\nit would crash on the Moon eventually, since there is no such thing as\na stable lunar orbit (as far as anyone knows), and I believe I recall\nhearing recently that it was about to happen.
I think this is a little inaccurate, based on Feynman's account of the\nsoftware-development process *before* the standdown.  Fred is basically\ncorrect:  no sophisticated tools, just a lot of effort and painstaking\ncare.  But they got this one right *before* Challenger; Feynman cited\nthe software people as exemplary compared to the engine people.  (He\nalso noted that the software people were starting to feel management\npressure to cut corners, but hadn't had to give in to it much yet.)\n\nAmong other things, the software people worked very hard to get things\nright for the major pre-flight simulations, and considered a failure\nduring those simulations to be nearly as bad as an in-flight failure.\nAs a result, the number of major-simulation failures could be counted\non one hand, and the number of in-flight failures was zero.\n\nAs Fred mentioned elsewhere, this applies only to the flight software.\nSoftware that runs experiments is typically mostly put together by the\nexperimenters, and gets nowhere near the same level of Tender Loving Care.\n(None of the experimenters could afford it.)
What  evidence  indicates that Gamma Ray bursters are very far away?\n\nTheir distribution is very isotropic and the intensity distribution,\ncrudely speaking, indicates we're seeing an edge to the distribution.\n\n   Given the enormous  power,  i was just wondering,  what if they are\n   quantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by?\n\n   Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges?   \n\nNow, in the good old days before GRO data, it was thought the\ngamma bursters were neutron stars in the galaxy, it was expected that\nGRO would confirm this by either showing they were a local population\n(within a few hundred light years) or that they were in the galactic\nhalo. (Mechanism was not known but several plausible ones existed)\n(also to be fair it was noted that the _brightest_ burster was\nprobably in the LMC, suggesting theorists might be wrong back then...)\n	As the Sun is not at the center of the galaxy a halo\npopulation should show anisotropy (a local disk population is\nruled out completely at this stage) - to avoid the anisotropy you\nhave to push the halo out, the energy then gets large, the mechanism\nof getting NS out that far becomes questionable, and we should start\nto see for example the Andromeda's bursters.\n	The data is consistent with either a Oort cloud distribution\n(but only just) - but no one can think of a plausible source with\nthe right spectrum. Or, it can be a cosmological distances (hence\nisotropy) and the edge is "the edge of the Universe" ;-)\nIf at cosmological distances you need very high energy (to detect)\nand a very compact source (for spectrum), ergo a neutron star\ncolliding with another neutron star or black hole. Even then getting\nthe spectrum is very hard, but conceivable.\n\n	If we know anything about physics at that level,\nthe bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmic\nstrings, wrong spectrum for one thing.\n\nThe situation is further complicated by recent claims that\nthere are two classes of sources ;-)  [in the colliding NS\nthey'd actually probably fit relatively easily into the\nNS-NS and NS-BH collision scenarios respectively]\n\n   my own pet theory is that it's  Flying saucers  entering\n   hyperspace :-)\n\n   but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they\n   are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes,  i just wondered\n   if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.\n\nIf you can think of one, remember to invite me to Stockholm...

My understanding is that the 'expected errors' are basically\n   known bugs in the warning system software - things are checked\n   that don't have the right values in yet because they aren't\n   set till after launch, and suchlike. Rather than fix the code\n   and possibly introduce new bugs, they just tell the crew\n   'ok, if you see a warning no. 213 before liftoff, ignore it'.\n\nGood grief. And I thought the Shuttle software was known for being\nwell-engineered. If this is actually the case, every member of the\nprogramming team should be taken out and shot.\n\n(given that I've heard the Shuttle software rated as Level 5 in\nmaturity, I strongly doubt that this is the case).

This was known as *Journey to the Far Side of the Sun* in the United\nStates and as *Doppelganger* in the U.K.  It was produced by the great\nteam of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson (whose science was usually a bit\nbetter than this).  It may have been their first production using live\nactors-- they were better known for their technophilic puppet shows,\nsuch as *Supercar*, *Stingray*, and *Thunderbirds*.  Later, they went\non to do more live-action SF series: *UFO* and *Space: 1999*.\n\nThe astronomy was lousy, but the lifting-body spacecraft, VTOL\nairliners, and mighty Portugese launch complex were *wonderful* to\nlook at.

SSRT ROLLOUT\n\n                Speech Delivered by Col. Simon P. Worden,\n                     The Deputy for Technology, SDIO\n                                    \n                  Mcdonnell Douglas - Huntington Beach\n                              April 3,1993\n\n     Most of you, as am I, are "children of the 1960's."  We grew\nup in an age of miracles -- Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles,\nnuclear energy, computers, flights to the moon.  But these were\nmiracles of our parent's doing.  For a decade and more the pundits\nhave told us - "you've lost it!"  The "me" generation is only\nliving on the accomplishments of the past.\n\n     You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists.  We\nlisten in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  Living\nhistory they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tell\nof it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as\nGeneral Bernie Schriever told of his team's work - and yes struggle\n- to build this nation's Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.\n\n     What stories can we tell?  Blurry-eyed telescopes?  Thousand\ndollar toilet seats?  Even our space launch vehicles hearken only\nof that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen.\nSchriever's ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that the\nbest new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman and\nPoseidon ballistic missiles.\n\n     Well - The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing. \nThis event is proof.  To our technological parents: We've listened\nto your stories.  We've caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit. \nAnd we've learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  Let\nme honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus\nbehind this history - Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatest\nengineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Your\ninsight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporated\ninto today's most successful launch vehicle - The Delta.\n\n     You told us in the 60's that a new form of launch vehicle - a\nsingle stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  You\nadvocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple, as are\nall great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  You\nconvinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weld\nits components into place.  Most important - you reminded us of a\nprime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from the\ngeneration before you - the generation that built transcontinental\naviation in the 1920's and 30's - build a little and test a little\nand Max, you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner who\nstarted this program for the SDI.\n\n     Douglas Aircraft didn't start with a DC-10.  They didn't even\nstart with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little, tested a\nlittle - even sold a little and made a little money - before they\nmoved on to the next step.  They didn't take a decade or more\nbefore putting the first "rubber on the road."  Max Hunter - you\ndidn't take ten years to build Thor, and by God we're not going to\ntake ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusable\naerospace transportation is real.\n\n     We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  same\nteam here today but a few years to show through the Strategic\nDefense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us -\nlaunched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in about\na year apiece.  This, more than anything else signaled our\ncommitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the Soviet\nUnion.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored\nthe importance of our work in bringing about a new international\nrelationship.\n\n     But it is the same team which is now  putting in place the\nframework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the\nnext generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.\n\n     We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  This\nsummer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the\nfirst time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next three\nyears a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use space\nrapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  And\nyes - we'll make a little money off it too!\n\n     Then - and only then - we'll spend another three years to\nbuild a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 of\nspace will be a reality!  We may even be able to use some of the\nrocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries. \nWhat a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts to\ncounter SDI merge to power mankind's next step to the stars!\n\n     To be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap to\nthe final answer.  Robert Goddard's first rockets weren't Saturn\nV's!  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extra\ndollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital\nsystem - we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed the\nway.  Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocket\nexhausts.  There is no short-cut.  If we expect to reshape the\nworld again - we must do it one brick at a time.  Minds on tasks at\nhand!
If not for the lack of extraneously capitalized words, I'd swear that\nMcElwaine had changed his name and moved to Cal Poly.  I also find the\nchoice of newsgroups 'interesting'.  Perhaps someone should tell this\nguy that 'sci.astro' doesn't stand for 'astrology'?\n\nIt's truly frightening that posts like this are originating at what\nare ostensibly centers of higher learning in this country.  Small\nwonder that the rest of the world thinks we're all nuts and that we\nhave the problems that we do.\n\n[In case you haven't gotten it yet, David, I don't think this was\nquite appropriate for a posting to 'sci' groups.]\n\n-- \n"Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live\n in the real world."   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden

I don't have to "try reading a bit", Pat.  I *work* as a government\ncontractor and know what the rules are like.  Yes, they sign some\n(damned few -- which is why everyone is always having to go to\nWashington to see about next week's funding) multi-year contracts;\nthey also aren't willing to include sufficient cancellation penalties\nwhen they *do* decide to cut the multi-year contract and not pay on it\n(which can happen arbitrarily at any time, no matter what previous\nplans were) to make the risk acceptable of something like putting up a\nprivate space station with the government as the expected prime\noccupant.\n\nI'd like a source for that statement about "the reason they aren't\ncutting defense spending as much as they would like"; I just don't buy\nit. The other thing I find a bit 'funny' about your posting, Pat, is\nthat several other people answered the question pretty much the same\nway I did; mine is the one you comment (and incorrectly, I think) on.\nI think that says a lot.

Yes, the Phobos mission did return some useful data including images of Phobos\nitself. The best I've seen had a surface resolution of about 40 meters. By\nthe way, the new book entitled "Mars" (Kieffer et al, 1992, University of\nArizona Press) has a great chapter on spacecraft exploration of the planet.\nThe chapter is co-authored by V.I. Moroz of the Space Research Institute in\nMoscow, and includes details never before published in the West. Don't\nknow of any ftp sites with images though.
>Does anyone know how to size cold gas roll control thruster tanks\n   >for sounding rockets?\n\n   Well, first you work out how much cold gas you need, then make the\n   tanks big enough.\n\nOur sounding rocket payload, with telemetry, guidance, etc. etc. and a\ntelescope cluster, weighs around 1100 pounds.  It uses freon jets for\nsteering and a pulse-width-modulated controller for alignment (ie\nduring our eight minutes in space, the jets are pretty much\ncontinuously firing on a ~10% duty cycle or so...).  The jets also\nneed to kill residual angular momentum from the spin stabilization, and\nflip the payload around to look at the Sun.\n\nWe have two freon tanks, each holding ~5 liters of freon (I'm speaking\nonly from memory of the last flight).  The ground crew at WSMR choose how\nmuch freon to use based on some black-magic algorithm.  They have\nextra tank modules that just bolt into the payload stack.\n\nThis should give you an idea of the order of magnitude for cold gas \nquantity.  If you really need to know, send me email and I'll try to get you\nin touch with our ground crew people.\n\nCheers,\nCraig

There is an interesting opinion piece in the business section of today's\nLA Times (Thursday April 15, 1993, p. D1).  I thought I'd post it to\nstir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate.  Let me preface it by\nsaying that I largely agree that the "Space Age" in the romantic sense\nof several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space station\nmiss the point at this time.  Reading, for example, "What's New" -\nthe weekly physics update we get here on the net - it's clear that the\nromance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation of\nmatter: by which I include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (with\nits spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing things\npeople are doing with individual atoms these days.  To a large extent, I\nthink, the romance some people still have with space is a matter of\nnostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our "mind\nchildren" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); but\nI think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting about\nwhat we can do *now*.   \n\nAnyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all...\n\n\nSPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEW\n\nMicheal Schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at MIT)\n\nAt 35, America's Space Age won't have to suffer through the angst of a\nmidlife crisis.\n\nThe reason is that the Space Age is already dead.  The technologies no\nlonger define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion\n-dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic\nrewards.  \n\nSpace exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America's science\nand technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace is not a\nmeaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, our\ntechnology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion\npolicy.  \n\nTo be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologies\nfor telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probes\nwould be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of\nscientific and industrial innovation is now dead.\n\n.....\n\nBefore the change in administrations, it would have been foolish to\nwrite an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressively\nsupported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billion\nto build space station Freedom alone.\n\nEven as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains,\nOffice of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspoken\npublic champion of big-ticket space expenditures.  The reality that much\nof the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescope\nto the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressively\nimplemented did not seem to matter much.\n\nPolitical inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherent\nvision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollar\nspace budgets.\n\nIndeed, with few notable exceptions, such as Voyager, the post-Apollo\nera is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space exploration\nwith programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.  \n\n......\n\nWhile the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded Daniel\nGoldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration, it seems clear that space exploration is not being\npositioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America's\ntechnological prowess.  The space station budget has - rightly - been\nslashed.  Space is virtually ignored when the Administration champions\nits competitiveness agenda.\n\n......
Is it right??? That is new stuff for me. So it means that  you just can \nnot put a sattellite around around the Moon for too long because its \norbit will be unstable??? If so, what is the reason??? Is that because \nthe combined gravitacional atraction of the Sun,Moon and Earth \nthat does not provide a stable  orbit around the Moon???\n\n C.O.EGALON@LARC.NASA.GOV\n\nC.O.Egalon@larc.nasa.gov

Who says there is no mineral rights to be given? Who says? The UN or the US\nGovernment? \nMajor question is if you decide to mine the moon or Mars, who will stop you?\nThe UN can't other than legal tom foolerie.. Can the truly inforce it?\n\nIf you go to the moon as declare that you are now a soverign nation, who will\nstop you from doing it. Maybe not acknowledge you? \n\nWhy can't a small company or corp or organization go an explore the great\nbeyond of space? what right does earth have to say what is legal and what is\nnot.. Maybe I am a few years ahead on this.. It is liek the old Catholic Church \nstating which was Portugals and what was Spains, and along came the Reformation\nand made it all null and void.. \n\nWhat can happen is to find a nation which is acknowledged, and offer your\nservices as a space miner and then go mine the asteroids/mars/moon or what\never.. As long as yur sponsor does not get in trouble..\nBasically find a country who wants to go into space, but can't for soem reason\nor another, but who will give you a "home".. Such as Saudia Arabia or\nwhatever..\nThere are nations in the World who are not part of the UN, got to them and\noffer your services and such.. I know that sound crazy, but. is it..\nAlso once you have the means to mine the moon (or whatever) then just do it.\nThe UN if done right can be made to be so busy with something else, they will\nnot care.. \nIf your worried about the US, do the same thing..\n\nWhy be limited by the short sighted people of earth.. After all they have many\nother things to worry about that if someone is mining the Moon or MArs or what\never..\nBasically what I am saying is where is that drive of yeasteryears to go a\nlittle bit farther out, to do jus ta  little bit more, and to tell the crown to\npiss off.. If my ancestors thought the way many today think, Id have been born\nin Central Europe just north of the Black Sea..\n\nI just read a good book, "Tower of the Gods" Interesting..

I have two books, both NASA Special Publications, on the Voyager \nMissions. One is titled "Voyages to Jupiter" the other "Voyage to Saturn" \nThese were excellent books put together after the encounters with each \nplanet. \n\nThe question is: Did NASA ever put together a similar book for either the \nUranus encounter or Neptune? If so, what SP number is it and where can it \nbe obtained? If not, why didn't they?
: I love the idea of an inflatable 1-mile long sign.... It will be a\n: really neat thing to see it explode when a bolt  (or even better, a\n: Westford Needle!) comes crashing into it at 10 clicks a sec.  \n\n: <BOOM!>  Whooooooooshhhhhh......  <sputter, sputter>\n\n: <okay, PRETEND it would make a sound!>\n                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nJust a thought... (let's pretend it IS INFLATED and PRESSURIZED) wouldn't\nthere be a large static electricity build up around the puncture?\nIf the metalization is behind a clear sandwich (ie. insulated) then the \ndeflating balloon would generate electrical interference - "noise"\n\nBy the way, any serious high velocity impact would simply cut a "Bugs\nBunny" hole through the wall, highly unlikely to "BOOM", and the fabric\nwould almost certainly be ripstop.
I found it very interesting that Atlas depended on pressure to\nmaintain tank geometry....leads me to the question: ? have any \nof the SSTO concepts explored pressurized tankage such that the\nlaunch configuration would be significantly different from the\nreentry one?

Wow.  I was beginning to think that I had made that up.  I remember that\nmovie (it was about 1.5 hours long).  I don't think they ended up anywhere\nin the known universe.  \n\nI remember they got a message halfway out to Proxima Centauri, that Earth\ntransmitted a day after they launched, timed to catch up with them at the\nhalfway point.  I thought it was neat, I think I was all of 10 at the time.\n\n \nSpace:1999 has just come out with 4 episodes released in American stores.\nI will look for the Into Infinity show, I never did know that was the\nname of it, I thought the show was called "the day after tomorrow", and\nthat was it.
Actually, the idea, like most good ideas, comes from Jules Verne, not\n_The Gods Must Be Crazy._  In one of his lesser known books (I can't\nremember which one right now), the protagonists are in a balloon gondola,\ntravelling over Africa on their way around the world in the balloon, when\none of them drops a fob watch.  They then speculate about the reaction\nof the natives to finding such a thing, dropped straight down from heaven.\nBut the notion is not pursued further than that.
Are breathable liquids possible?\n\nI remember seeing an old Nova or The Nature of Things where this idea was\ntouched upon (it might have been some other TV show).  If nothing else, I know\nsuch liquids ARE possible because...\n\nThey showed a large glass full of this liquid, and put a white mouse (rat?) in\nit.  Since the liquid was not dense, the mouse would float, so it was held down\nby tongs clutching its tail.  The thing struggled quite a bit, but it was\ncertainly held down long enough so that it was breathing the liquid.  It never\ndid slow down in its frantic attempts to swim to the top.\n\nNow, this may not have been the most humane of demonstrations, but it certainly\nshows breathable liquids can be made.

Say it here.\n\nI like the idea of having atleast a russian team.\n\n\nSome prefer using new technology, others old or ..\n\nThe basic idea of the New Moon Race is like the Solar Car Race acrossed\nAustralia..

From another space forum\n    When workers at the Kennedy Space Center disassembled the STS-56\n solid rocket boosters they were surprised to find a pair of pliers\n lodged into the outside base of the right hand SRB.  The tool survived\n the trip from the launch pad up to approximately a 250,000 foot\n altitude, then down to splashdown and towing back to KSC.\n\n    NASA spokesperson Lisa Malone told the media,\n\n    "It's been a long time since something like this happened.  We've\n lost washers and bolts (before) but never a tool like this."\n\n    The initial investigation into the incident has shown that a\n Thiokol Corp. technician noticed and reported his pliers as missing on\n April 2nd.  Unfortunately, the worker's supervisor did not act on the\n report and Discovery was launched with its "extra payload".  NASA\n officials were never told of the missing tool before the April 8th\n launch date.\n\n    The free-flying pliers were supposed to be tethered to the SRB\n technician.  When the tool was found in an aft section of the booster,\n its 18-inch long rope was still attached.  The pliers were found in a\n part of the booster which is not easily visible from the launch pad.\n\n    A spokesperson for the Lockheed Space Operations Company said that\n the Shuttle processor will take "appropriate action".  Thiokol is a\n subcontractor to LSOC for work to prepare Shuttle hardware for launch.\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\nKarl Anderson	\nDEV/2000: Configuration Management/Version Control\n\nDept 53K/006-2		Rochester, Minnesota 55901\n253-8044		Tie 8-453-8044\nINTERNET: karl@vnet.ibm.com\nPRODIGY: CMMG96A

NASA Headquarters distributed the following press\nrelease today (4/6). I've typed it in verbatim, for you\nfolks to chew over. Many of the topics recently\ndiscussed on sci.space are covered in this.\n\nGibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign Guidance\n\nDr. John H. Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and\nTechnology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of\nthe Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space\nStation on April 3, three budget options as guidance to\nthe committee in their deliberations on the redesign of\nthe space station.\n\nA low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7\nbillion and a high option of $9 billion will be\nconsidered by the committee. Each option would cover\nthe total expenditures for space station from fiscal\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for\ndevelopment, operations, utilization, Shuttle\nintegration, facilities, research operations support,\ntransition cost and also must include adequate program\nreserves to insure program implementation within the\navailable funds.\n\nOver the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within\nthe NASA budget for the President's new technology\ninvestment. As a result, station options above $7\nbillion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in\nthe rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space\nstation option of $9 billion would require $2 billion\nin offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.\n\nGibbons presented the information at an organizational\nsession of the advisory committee. Generally, the\nmembers-designate focused upon administrative topics\nand used the session to get acquainted. They also\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation\non the process the Station Redesign Team is following\nto develop options for the advisory committee to\nconsider.\n\nGibbons also announced that the United States and its\ninternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese, and\nCanadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give\n"full consideration" to use of Russian assets in the\ncourse of the space station redesign process.\n\nTo that end, the Russians will be asked to participate\nin the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting\nbasis, so that the redesign team can make use of their\nexpertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the\npossible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and\nsystems. The U.S. and international partners hope to\nbenefit from the expertise of the Russian participants\nin assessing Russian systems and technology. The\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop\noptions for reducing station costs while preserving key\nresearch and exploration capabilities. Careful\nintegration of Russian assets could be a key factor in\nachieving that goal.\n\nGibbons reiterated that, "President Clinton is\ncommitted to the redesigned space station and to making\nevery effort to preserve the science, the technology\nand the jobs that the space station program represents.\nHowever, he also is committed to a space station that\nis well managed and one that does not consume the\nnational resources which should be used to invest in\nthe future of this industry and this nation."
Great speculation - I remember being proud on behalf of all the free\nworld (you think that way when you are seven years old) that we had\ngot there first. Now I'm almost sorry that it worked out that way.\n\nI guess the soviets would have taken the victory seriously too, and\nwould almost certainly not have fallen victim to the complacency that\novertook the US program. Perhaps stretching to match US efforts would\nhave destabilized them sooner than it did in fact - and in the tradition\nof Marvel Comics 'What If', this destabilization in the Brezhnev era might\nhave triggered the third world war. Hmm, maybe it was a giant leap after all.
I read it refered to as the "parabolic cross-section" rule;\nthe idea was that if you plot the area of the fuselage cross-\nsection as a function of the point fore-and-aft along the \nfuselage, a plot that is a **paraboloid** minimizes somethin' \nor 'nother (to be technical about it).

When the Lunar Society's $500M estimate of the cost of a lunar colony was\nmentioned at Making Orbit, somebody asked Jerry Pournelle "have you talked\nto Bill Gates?".  The answer:  "Yes.  He says that if he were going to\nsink that much money into it, he'd want to run it -- and he doesn't have\nthe time."\n\n(Somebody then asked him about Perot.  Answer:  "Having Ross Perot on your\nboard may be a bigger problem than not having the money.")
I thought that under emergency conditions,  the STS  can\nput down at any good size Airport.  IF it could take a C-5 or a\n747, then it can take an orbiter.   You just need a VOR/TAC\n\nI don't know if they need ILS.\n\npat
Things could be worse. A lot worse! In the mid-eighties the\nteen/adult sci-fi comic 2000AD (Fleetway) produced a short story\nfeaturing the award winning character "Judge Dredd". The story\nfocussed on an advertising agency of the future who use high powered\nmulti-coloured lasers/search lights pointed at the moon to paint\nimages on the moon. Needless to say, this use hacked off a load of lovers,\nromantics and werewolfs/crazies. The ad guys got chopped, the service\ndiscontinued. A cautionary tale indeed!\n\nMarvin Batty.
This sounds like another of Ali AbuTaha's 57 different "real causes" of\nthe Challenger accident.  As far as I know, there has never been the\nslightest shred of evidence for a "harmonic resonance" having occurred.\n\nThe windshear-induced maneuvering probably *did* contribute to opening\nup the leak path in the SRB joint again -- it seems to have sealed itself\nafter the puffs of smoke during liftoff -- but the existing explanation\nof this and related events seems to account for the evidence adequately.

I don't know a whole lot on Proton, but given that it is a multi stage\nrocket,  up to 4 stages, it may not really need the Centaur,  plus\nit may end up seriously beating on said centaur.   \n\nAlso, the centaur is not small,  unless the Proton has an oversize\nshroud you may not be able to get the centaur in under it.\n\nDennis,  you know much about this?
My poor old physics intuition will be very surprised if these tiny\n masses, sitting very close to Jupiter, play any role whatsoever in the\n problem.   Or, to put it more technically, the extra "volume" they add\n to the phase space of possible capture trajectories is negligible.\n \n Jupiter is 2E27 kg, while the Galilean satellites are around 1E23.\n \n Also, as I said, the few references that I've looked at do not\n mention outgassing or breakup as important processes.  The important\n thing is a Jupiter-Sun-comet "reverse slingshot" that leads to a\n weakly Jupiter-bound orbit for the comet (at least a temporary one).

Several people have enquired about the availability of the book about the\nGreat 72" reflector built at Birr Castle, Ireland in 1845 which remained the\nlargest in the world until the the start of the 20th century.\n\n"The Astronomy of Birr Castle" was written by Patrick Moore who now sits on\nthe committee which is going to restore the telescope.

This book is the definitivie history of\nhow one man, the Third Earl of Rosse, pulled off the most impressive\ntechnical achievement, perhaps ever, in the history of the telescope, and\nthe discoveries made with the instrument.\n\nPatrick Moore is donating all proceeds from the book's sale to help restore\nthe telescope.

SOmebody mentioned  a re-boost of HST during this mission,  meaning\nthat Weight is a very tight  margin on this  mission.\n\nHow will said re-boost be done?\n\nGrapple, HST,  stow it in Cargo bay,  do OMS burn to high altitude,  \n\nunstow  HST,   repair  gyros,  costar install,  fix solar arrays,\n\nthen return to earth?\n\nMy guess is  why  bother with  usingthe shuttle to reboost?\n\nwhy not  grapple,  do all said fixes,   bolt a small  liquid  fueled\nthruster module  to  HST,   then let it make the re-boost.  it has to be\ncheaper on mass then usingthe shuttle as a tug.   that way, now that\nthey are going to need at least 5  spacewalks,  then they can carry\nan EDO pallet,  and  sit on station and even  maybe do the  solar array\ntilt  motor  fix.
I don't think you're going to be able to see the differences from a sphere\nunless they are greatly exaggerated.  Even the equatorial bulge is only\nabout 1 part in 300 -- you'd never notice a 1mm error in a 30cm globe --\nand the other deviations from spherical shape are much smaller.

From the "JPL Universe"\nApril 23, 1993\n\nVLBI project meets with international space agencies
Reading from a Amoco Performance Products data sheet, their\nERL-1906 resin with T40 carbon fiber reinforcement has a compressive\nstrength of 280,000 psi.  It has a density of 0.058 lb/cu in,\ntherefore the theoretical height for a constant section column\nthat can just support itself is 4.8 million inches, or 400,000 ft,\nor 75 Statute miles.\n\nNow, a real structure will have horizontal bracing (either a truss\ntype, or guy wires, or both) and will be used below the crush strength.\nLet us assume that we will operate at 40% of the theoretical \nstrength.  This gives a working height of 30 miles for a constant\nsection column.  \n\nA constant section column is not the limit on how high you can\nbuild something if you allow a tapering of the cross section\nas you go up.  For example, let us say you have a 280,000 pound\nload to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity in\ncalculation).  This requires 2.5 square inches of column cross\nsectional area to support the weight.  The mile of structure\nbelow the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb, so at 1 mile \nbelow the payload, the total load is now 289,200 lb, a 3.3% increase.\n\nThe next mile of structure must be 3.3% thicker in cross section\nto support the top mile of tower plus the payload.  Each mile\nof structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way\nto the bottom.  We can see from this that there is no theoretical\nlimit on area, although there will be practical limits based\non how much composites we can afford to by at $40/lb, and how\nmuch load you need to support on the ground (for which you need\na foundation that the bedrock can support.\n\nLet us arbitrarily choose $1 billion as the limit in costruction\ncost.  With this we can afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb of composites,\nassuming our finished structure costs $100/lb.  The $40/lb figure\nis just for materials cost.  Then we have a tower/payload mass\nratio of 35.7:1.  At a 3.3% mass ratio per mile, the tower\nheight becomes 111 miles.  This is clearly above the significant\natmosphere.  A rocket launched from the top of the tower will still\nhave to provide orbital velocity, but atmospheric drag and g-losses\nwill be almost eliminated.  G-losses are the component of\nrocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity,\nbut which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity.  Thus\nthey represent wasted thrust.  Together with drag, rockets starting\nfrom the ground have a 15% velocity penalty to contend with.\n\nThis analysis is simplified, in that it does not consider wind\nloads.  These will require more structural support over the first\n15 miles of height.  Above that, the air pressure drops to a low\nenough value for it not to be a big factor.\n\nDani Eder
I am sure  Mary or Henry can describe this more aptly then me.\nBut here is how i understand it.\n\nAt Speed,  Near supersonic.  The wind behaves like a fluid pipe.\nIt becomes incompressible.  So wind has to bend away from the\nwing edges.   AS the wing thickens,  the more the pipes bend.\n\nIf they have no place to go,  they begin to stall,  and force\ncompression, stealing power from the vehicle (High Drag).\n\nIf you squeeze the fuselage,  so that these pipes  have aplace to bend\ninto,  then drag is reduced.   \n\nEssentially,  teh cross sectional area of the aircraft shoulf\nremain constant for all areas of the fuselage.  That is where the wings are\nsubtract, teh cross sectional area of the wings from the fuselage.

Brian Yamauchi asks: [Regarding orbital billboards...]\n  \n    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the\nCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:\n  \nSPACE ADVERTISING\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization's logos on the\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\n   This has not been considered "paid advertising" but rather\n"public relations", since the restrictions have been such that only\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\na 10' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980's which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger's upcoming movie "The Last\nAction Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission's Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation."   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a "commercial launch" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL "BILLBOARDS"\n   Orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in "The Man Who Sold the Moon".  Several\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the "Eiffel\nII" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\norbit to celebrate the French Republic's Bi-centennial.\n                                                (cont)

:Just a bit off, Phil.  We don't reprocess nuclear fuel because what\n:you get from the reprocessing plant is bomb-grade plutonium.  It is\n:also cheaper, given current prices of things, to simply fabricate new\n:fuel rods rather than reprocess the old ones, creating potentially\n:dangerous materials (from a national security point of view) and then\n:fabricate that back into fuel rods.\n\nFabricating with reprocessed plutonium may result in something that may go\nkind of boom, but its hardly decent bomb grade plutonium.  If you want bomb\ngrade plutonium use a research reactor, not a power reactor.  But if you want\na bomb, don't use plutonium, use uranium.

I gues it is Keesler. The others do not ring the bell but they might be \ninvolved as well. Sometime ago Keesler was here at Langley teaching \na course on space debris and, if my memory does not fai,l I think there\nwas even a reference to a book on the subject.\n\nC.O.Egalon@larc.nasa.gov

One\n/thing you absolutely must do in such an engine is to guarantee that\n/the propellants ignite as soon as they mix, within milliseconds.  To\n/do otherwise is to fill your engine with a high explosive mixture\n/which, when it finally does ignite, blows everything to hell.\n\nDefinitely! In one of the reports of an early test conducted by Rocketdyne at \ntheir Santa Susanna Field Lab ("the Hill" above the San Fernando and Simi \nValleys), the result of a hung start was described as "structural failure" of \nthe combustion chamber.  The inspection picture showed pumps with nothing below\n, the CC had vaporized!  This was described in a class I took as a "typical\nengineering understatement" :-)

COMET (Commercial Experiment Transport) is to launch from Wallops Island\nVirginia and orbit Earth for about 30 days. It is scheduled to come down\nin the Utah Test & Training Range, west of Salt Lake City, Utah. I saw\na message in this group toward the end of March that it was to launch \non March 27. Does anyone know if it launched on that day, or if not, \nwhen it is scheduled to launch and/or when it will come down.\n\nI would also be interested in what kind(s) of payload(s) are onboard.\n\nThanks for your help.
DFW was designed with the STS in mind (which really mean very little).  Much of\ntheir early PR material had scenes with a shuttle landing and two or three\nothers pulled up to gates.  I guess they were trying to stress how advanced the\nairport was.\n\nFor Dallas types:  Imagine the fit Grapevine and Irving would be having if the\nshuttle WAS landing at DFW. (For the rest, they are currently having some power\nstruggles between the airport and surrounding cities).
ARIANESPACE FLIGHT 56\n\n(Flight V.56 was originally intended to carry the Hughes HS-601 series \nGalaxy IV satellite, but the payload was withdrawn just prior to flight.)\n\nThe 56th Ariane launch is now scheduled to place the ASTRA 1C and ARSENE \nsatellites into an improved geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), with \ninclination reduced to 5 degrees and apogee altitude increased by 150 km.\nThis will be the 28th launch of an Ariane 4 and the first in the 42L \nconfiguration, with 2 liquid strap-on boosters (PAL).  It will be launched\nfrom the newly refurbished Ariane launch complex ELA 2, in Kourou - French \nGuiana.\n\nThe launch vehicle performance requirement for this mission is 3,147 kg\nof which 2,944 kg represents the satellite mass.

This is a three-stage liquid fueled launcher with two liquid \nfueled strap-on boosters.  The first stage (L220) is built by Aerospatiale,\nand is powered by 4 liquid fueled Viking V engines.  The second stage (L33)\nis built by MBB Erno and is powered by a single Viking IV engine.  Both the\nViking IV and V engines are manufactured by SEP.  The first and second stages\nuse a biliquid UH25/N2O4 fuel. The third stage (H10) is built by Aerospatiale,\nand is powered by a cryogenic H2/O2 fueled HM-7B engine built by SEP. The two\nstrap-on boosters (PAL) are each powered by a Viking VI engine, also built \nby SEP, which use the same biliquid fuel as the first and second stages.  \nThe fully assembled launch vehicle stands 56 meters high on the pad.  \nIt uses the Type 01 Ariane Short payload fairing.\n\n\nFlight Profile:\n\n +02:21  Liquid strap-on booster jettison\n +03:11  First stage separation\n +03:18  Second stage ignition\n +04:10  Fairing jettison\n +05:21  Second stage separation\n +05:26  Third stage ignition\n +17:30  Third stage shutdown / orbit injection\n +19:56  ASTRA 1C separation\n +22:36  Cyclade adapter separation\n +24:26  ARSENE separation\n +28:47  End of Ariane mission 56\n\n\nPAYLOADS:\n\nASTRA 1C is the third spacecraft in the fleet of "Societe Europeenne\ndes Satellites" to broadcast direct TV to homes all over Europe.\nBuilt by Hughes, it will be the second HS-601 launched by Ariane.\n\n  Total mass at lift-off .... 2,790 kg\n  Mass at GEO insertion ..... 1,700 kg\n  Dry mass .................. 1,180 kg     \n  On-board power ............ 3,300 W (end of life)\n  Nominal lifetime .......... 15 years     \n  Span of solar panels ...... 21 m\n  On-Orbit position ......... 19.2 degrees east, over Africa.\n\n Transmission capacity:  \n   34 channels in Ku-band, via 18 transponders.\n\n In-flight operations:\n   Solar array deployment ............ about 6 days after lift-off\n   First of 3 apogee motor firings ... about 40 hours after lift-off \n                                       at 4th apogee\n\n\nARSENE is the first spacecraft built by the European Space Industry\nfor the benefit of the world amateur radio community.  \n\n  Total mass at lift-off .... 154 kg\n  Mass at GEO insertion .....  98 kg\n  Dry mass ..................  97 kg     \n  On-board power ............ 42 W (end of life)\n  Nominal lifetime .......... 3 years     \n  Spacecraft dimensions ..... 1.1m x .96m\n  Orbital parameters ........ 20000/36000 km, 0 inclination, period 17:30.\n\n Transmission capacity:  \n   S-band:  1 transponder at 2.446 ghz\n   VHF/UHF: 145/435 mhz \n\n\nLAUNCH COVERAGE:\n\nAll Ariane missions are broadcast live via satellite from Kourou. \nCoverage begins at 30 minutes before launch and continues until \nall payloads have been deployed.

I would like to find out about space engineering employment and educational\nopportunities in the Tucson, Arizona area.  E-mail responses appreciated.\nMy mail feed is intermittent, so please try one or all of these addresses.
Ah, there's the rub.  And a catch-22 to boot.  For the purposes of a\ncontest, you'll probably not compete if'n you can't afford the ride to get\nthere.  And although lower priced delivery systems might be doable, without\ndemand its doubtful that anyone will develop a new system.  Course, if a\nlow priced system existed, there might be demand...  \n\nI wonder if there might be some way of structuring a contest to encourage\nlow cost payload delivery systems.  The accounting methods would probably\nbe the hardest to work out.  For example, would you allow Rockwell to\n'loan' you the engines?  And so forth...\n\n\nThis depends on the how soon the new launch system comes on line.  In other\nwords, perhaps a great deal of worthwhile technology (life support,\nnavigation, etc.) could be developed prior to a low cost launch system. \nYou wouldn't want to use the expensive stuff forever, but I'd hate to see\nfolks waiting to do anything until a low cost Mac, oops, I mean launch\nsystem comes on line.\n\nI guess I'd simplify this to say that 'waste' is a slippery concept.  If\nyour goal is manned lunar exploration in the next 5 years, then perhaps its\nnot 'wasted' money.  If your goal is to explore the moon for under $500\nmillion, then you should put of this exploration for a decade or so.\n\nCraig
Great! I'll visit the National Air and Space Museum at the end of the\nmonth with my wife, who was also working at General Atomic at the time.\nOnce again netnews has enriched my life.
So how much would it cost as a private venture, assuming you could talk the\nU.S. government into leasing you a couple of pads in Florida?
Nick Haines sez;\n   >(given that I've heard the Shuttle software rated as Level 5 in\n   >maturity, I strongly doubt that this [having lots of bugs] is the case).\n\n   Level 5?  Out of how many?  What are the different levels?  I've never\n   heard of this rating system.  Anyone care to clue me in?\n\nThis is a rating system used by ARPA and other organisations to\nmeasure the maturity of a `software process' i.e. the entire process\nby which software gets designed, written, tested, delivered, supported\netc.\n\nSee `Managing the Software Process', by Watts S. Humphrey, Addison\nWesley 1989. An excellent software engineering text. The 5 levels of\nsoftware process maturity are:\n\n1. Initial\n2. Repeatable\n3. Defined\n4. Managed\n5. Optimizing\n\nThe levels are approximately characterized as follows:\n\n1. no statistically software process control. Have no statistical\n   basis for estimating how large software will be, how long it will\n   take to produce, how expensive it will be, or how reliable it will\n   be.  Most software production is at this level.\n\n2. stable process with statistical controls, rigorous project\n   management; having done something once, can do it again. Projects\n   are planned in detail, and there is software configuration\n   management and quality assurance.\n\n3. The process is defined and understood, implementation is\n   consistent. This includes things like software inspection, a\n   rigorous software testing framework, more configuration management,\n   and typically a `software engineering process group' within the\n   project.\n\n4. Statistical information on the software is systematically gathered\n   and analysed, and the process is controlled on the basis of this\n   information. Software quality is measured and has goals.\n\n5. Defects are prevented, the process is automated, software contracts\n   are effective and certified.
This might a real wierd idea or maybe not..\n\nI have seen where people have blown up ballons then sprayed material into them\nthat then drys and makes hard walls...\n\nWhy not do the same thing for a space station..\n\nFly up the docking rings and baloon materials and such, blow up the baloons,\nspin then around (I know a problem in micro gravity) let them dry/cure/harden?\nand cut a hole for the docking/attaching ring and bingo a space station..\n\nOf course the ballons would have to be foil covered or someother radiation\nprotective covering/heat shield(?) and the material used to make the wals would\nhave to meet the out gasing and other specs or atleast the paint/covering of\nthe inner wall would have to be human safe.. Maybe a special congrete or maybe\nthe same material as makes caplets but with some changes (saw where someone\ninstea dof water put beer in the caplet mixture, got a mix that was just as\nstrong as congret but easier to carry around and such..)\n\nSorry for any spelling errors, I missed school today.. (grin)..\n\nWhy musta  space station be so difficult?? why must we have girders? why be\nconfined to earth based ideas, lets think new ideas, after all space is not\nearth, why be limited by earth based ideas??
Too bad they didn't  give him a tour of the CGRO data?\n\nI think he'd be fascinated by the Gamma ray bursters.  The mind of\nhawking might even propose a mechanism.\n\n\nSO what's a drag free satellite?   coated with WD-40?  carries an\naluminum-gold  set of grateful dead albums?   inquiring minds\nwant to know?\n\nAnd why would MO  carry any features for being drag free?  I thought\naero-braking was a possible MO  experimental activity?
This isn't inherently bad.\n\nThis isn't really light pollution since it will only\nbe visible shortly before or after dusk (or during the\nday).\n\n(Of course, if night only lasts 2 hours for you, you're probably going\nto be inconvienenced. But you're inconvienenced anyway in that case).\n\nFinally: this isn't the Bronze Age, and most of us aren't Indo\nEuropean; those people speaking Indo-Eurpoean languages often have\nmuch non-indo-european ancestry and cultural background. So:\nplease try to remember that there are more human activities than\nthose practiced by the Warrior Caste, the Farming Caste, and the\nPriesthood.\n\nAnd why act distressed that someone's found a way to do research\nthat doesn't involve socialism?\n\nIt certianly doesn't mean we deserve to die.
Posted to the Internet by wmiler@nyx.cs.du.edu\n \n000062David42      041493003715\n \n             The Lunar Tele-operation Model One (LTM1)\n             =========================================\n                        By David H. Mitchell\n                          March 23, 1993\n \nINTRODUCTION:\n \nIn order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations, a\nreal miniature lunar-like environment is being constructed on which to test\ntele-operated models. These models are remotely-controlled by individuals\nlocated world-wide using their personal computers, for EduTainment\npurposes.\nNot only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation and\ntele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of\ninformation\non methods of operating in space, including, but not limited to, layout of\na\nlunar colony, tele-operating machines for work and play, disseminating\neducational information, providing contests and awards for creativity and\nachievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in\nTwenty-First century remote learning methods.\n \nBecause of the nature of the LTM1 project, people of all ages, interests\nand\nskills can contribute scenery and murals, models and structures,\ninterfacing\nand electronics, software and graphics. In operation LTM1 is an evolving\nplayground and laboratory that can be used by children, students and\nprofessionals worldwide. Using a personal computer at home or a terminal at\na participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models at\nthe\nLTM1 base for experimental or recreational purposes. Because a real\nfacility\nexists, ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the\nconstruction\nof the lunar model, its operation and new features to be added as suggested\nby the users themselves.\n \nThis has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups:\n - tele-operations and virtual reality research\n - radio control, model railroad and ham radio operation\n - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers\n - art and theater\n - bbs and online network users\n - software and game developers\n - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets, cars and trains\n - children\n - the child in all of us\n \nLTM1 OVERALL DESIGN:\n \nA room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. The walls are used\nfor murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth.\nThe "floor" is the simulated lunar surface. A global call for contributions\nis hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design and\ncreation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, and\nmachine-lets.\n \n The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets:\n 1. An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land;\n 2. A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and\n 3. A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.\n \n Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on\n it. A personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture\n content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent\n to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals.\n \nThe first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trains\nwith TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and control\nelectronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. The user will\nreceive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their\ndata link to LTM1.\n \nNext, an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a\nservo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the\nSSTO\nto be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunar\nlandscape and land.\n \nFinally, some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped\nbulldozerlets. The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operators\nworldwide\nto receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and\ntakeoff, traveling and doing work. The entire system is based on\ncommercially\navailable items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the\ninterface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced\nham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers.\n \nBy taking a graphically oriented communications program (Dmodem) and adding\na tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can be\nprovided in under 80 man hours.\n \nPLAN OF ACTION:\n \nThe Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by\nproviding a host computer network and Internet access to that network.\nDiaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction\nof the lunar model. Diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can be\nmodified and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agrees to provide "rail stock"\nfor the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical\ncommunications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets.\nAn initial "ground breaking" with miniature shovels will be performed for\na live photo-session and news conference on April 30, 1993. The initial\nmodels will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be started for\nhistorical purposes. It is not expected that this event will be completely\nserious or solemn. The lunar colony will be declared open for additional\nbuilding, operations and experiments. A photographer will be present and\nthe photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distribution\nworld-wide to major online networks and bbs's. A press release will be\nissued\ncalling for contributions of ideas, time, talent, materials and scale\nmodels\nfor the simulated lunar colony.\n \nA contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then\nbe\nannounced. Universities will be invited to participate, the goal being to\nfind instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of\nthe lunar colony model. Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at that\ntime\nthe results of the class work will be added to the model. Contributors will\nthen be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they return\nto\ntheir campus.\n \nA monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via\nconventional means to the media. Any major new tele-operated equipment\naddition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media.\nHaving a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photo\nopportunity for the television community. Especially since the "action"\nwill\nbe controlled by people all over the world. Science fiction writers will be\ninvited to issue "challenges" to engineering and human factors students at\nuniversities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform\nlunar tasks. Using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1/6 gravity may be\nsimulated to some extent to try various traction challenges.\n \nThe long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education,\nexperimentation\nand remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 has the potential of being a\nlong\nterm global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic\nexample of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited\nto space EduTainment. All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can\nlead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars!\n \nCONCLUSION:\n \nEduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment. Anyone who has\never enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a\nglobally available layout for recreation, education and experimentation\npurposes. By creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only create\nworld-wide publicity, but also a method of trying new ideas that require\nreal\n(not virtual) skills and open a new method for putting people's minds in\nspace.\n \n \nMOONLIGHTERS:\n \n"Illuminating the path of knowledge about space and lunar development."\nThe following people are already engaged in various parts of this work:\nDavid42, Rob47, Dash, Hyson, Jzer0, Vril, Wyatt, The Dark One, Tiggertoo,\nThe Mad Hatter, Sir Robin, Jogden.\n \nCome join the discussion any Friday night from 10:30 to midnight PST in\n \nDiaspar Virtual Reality Network.

WHile we are on the subject of the shuttle software.\n\nwhat ever happened to the hypothesis  that the shuttle flight software\nwas a major factor in the loss of 51-L.  to wit,  that during the\nwind shear event,  the Flight control software  indicated a series\nof very violent engine movements that shocked and set upa harmonic\nresonance  leading to an overstress of the struts.
The home office number for ENVIRONET is (301) 286-5690 (note area\ncode change).  A friend of mine used to use it to get LDEF data, but\nhe had to apply for a login name and password.  I have a call in for\nmore info, which I hope to get in the morning.
Interesting is rigth.. I wonder if they will make a mention of her being an\nastronaut in the credits.. I think it might help people connect the future of\nspace with the present.. And give them an idea that we must go into space..
I am doing a political science paper on the funding of NASA and pork-barrel \npolitics.  I would be interested in information about funding practices and\nhistories of some of the major programs (Apollo, STS, SSF, etc) and the\nfunding of SSTO to contrast.  Could someone please recommend some sources\nthat would be useful?  Thank you.
;From the article "What's New" Apr-16-93 in sci.physics.research:\n;\n;........\n;WHAT'S NEW (in my opinion), Friday, 16 April 1993  Washington, DC\n;\n;1. SPACE BILLBOARDS! IS THIS ONE THE "SPINOFFS" WE WERE PROMISED?\n;What about light pollution in observations? (I read somewhere else that\n;it might even be visible during the day, leave alone at night).\n;Is NASA really supporting this junk?\n;Are protesting groups being organized in the States?\n;Really, really depressed.\n;\n;             Enzo\n\nI wouldn't worry about it.  There's enough space debris up there that\na mile-long inflatable would probably deflate in some very short\nperiod of time (less than a year) while cleaning up LEO somewhat.\nSort of a giant fly-paper in orbit.\n\nHmm, that could actually be useful.\n\nAs for advertising -- sure, why not?  A NASA friend and I spent one\ndrunken night figuring out just exactly how much gold mylar we'd need\nto put the golden arches of a certain American fast food organization\non the face of the Moon.  Fortunately, we sobered up in the morning.
...\n\nFunny.  A bit disturbing.  Forging a posting seems somewhat unethical, even\nif the subject is as notorious as McElwaine.\n\nFollowups should definitely not go to sci.space.
Tom's right about this.  It's only a grantable right if the granter has\nthe will and the ability to stop anyone from taking it away from you.\nNever mind the legal status.\n\n\nNick's right about this.  It's always easier to obtain forgiveness than\npermission.  Not many people remember that Britain's King George III\nexpressly forbid his american subjects to cross the alleghany/appalachian\nmountains.  Said subjects basically said, "Stop us if you can."  He\ncouldn't.\n\n\nThat's how the USA started.  Of course, that's also how the Bolivarian\nRepublic started (ca. 1800-1820) in central america.  It didn't have\nquite the staying power of the USA.  I'm sure there are more examples of\ngoing far away and then ignoring authority, but none jump to mind right\nnow.\n\n\nOr do as some whaling nations do: define whatever activities you want to\ncarry out as "scientific research" which just coincidentally requires\nthe recovery of megatonnes of minerals (or whatever), then go at it.\n\n\nLute Keyser had just this sort of arrangement with Libya (I think) in\nthe late '70's for his commercial space launch project (one of the very\nearliest).  It was killed by Soviet propaganda about NATO cruise\nmissiles in Africa, which made Libya renege on the arrangement.
I know someone had long talks about Solar Sails early this year and late last\nyear..Also about Solar Sailing. Not sure who captured it if possible..\n\nI think it was one of the regulars who had most or all the data?\n\nI think I started the latest round or the late last year round.. But the topic\nhas been around here, off and on for a year or two..
I am looking for a source of orbital element sets\nother than UAF/Space Command.  I believe there is\none on CompuServe.  Please let me know what other\npossible sources there are and how I can reach \nthem.  Thanks much.
The situation in this regard has changed considerably in recent years.\nSee the discussion of "high-power rocketry" in the rec.models.rockets\nfrequently-asked-questions list.\n\nThis is not hardware you can walk in off the street and buy; you need\nproper certification.  That can be had, mostly through Tripoli (the high-\npower analog of the NAR), although the NAR is cautiously moving to extend\nthe upper boundaries of what it considers proper too.\n\nYou need special FAA authorization, but provided you aren't doing it under\none of the LAX runway approaches or something stupid like that, it's not\nespecially hard to arrange.\n\nAs with model rocketry, this sort of hardware is reasonably safe if handled\nproperly.  Proper handling takes more care, and you need a lot more empty\nair to fly in, but it's basically just model rocketry scaled up.  As with\nmodel rocketry, the high-power people use factory-built engines, which\neliminates the major safety hazard of do-it-yourself rocketry.
Ok, so how about the creation of oil producing bacteria?  I figure\nthat if you can make them to eat it up then you can make them to shit it.\nAny comments?
Hiya \n\nI'm a VERY amuture astronomer in Adelaide Australia, and today, I heard some\nvery interesting and exciting news from a local program on TV. As I couldn't\nfind anything on it on the news server, I have posted this. However, if it is\nold information, tell me, and ill sue the TV station for saying they are \n'Up to date' ;-)\n\n(Also, my news server could be slow. . so . . .!!!\n\nI only caught the end of the article, so all the information on the topic\nis not known to me at the moment.\n\nThe news is of a small 'psudo' planet outside the orbit of pluto found in a \nHawiian obsevatory, supposably 'recently' - acording to the report.\nIt was meant to be about 150miles in diamater, and a faily large distance \nfrom the plutos orbit.  (it had a computer drawing, and the orbit distance\nfrom pluto was about the same as neptune to pluto when they are furthest\napart.  This is all I found out about it. OH it is called Karna.

The Centaur that is being built for T4 would be a better bet to integrate \nonto the Proton as the T4/Centaur is designed for the Extremely Harsh \nenvorinment of the T4 launch. It is also closer to 4 m in diameter. \n\nYou've hit on the real kicker, however. The Centaur is pressure stabilized. \nIt cannot hold up its own weight without pressure in the tanks. Additionally, \nthe pressure difference between the two tanks must be maintained to ~+/- 5 psi. \nThat is rather tight to be rocking and rolling on the train. The pressure \nstabilization is how centaur achieves the performance. On numerous occasions\n(when I was there 88-91) the AF wanted to see what it would take to make \na non-pressure stabilized centaur. The answer -- a centaur not worth launching. \n\nThe Atlas/Centaur does not require on-pad integration, however the T4/Centaur\ndoes. I believe the on-pad integration is to a great extent due to the \ncleanliness requirements and PFL configuration, so maybe something can be \ndone there........\n\n\n\nThe addition of LOX/LH facilities is critical as the centaur tops off as it \nlifts off. A LHe facility is also needed. I don't know what the proton uses \nfor fuel, but since they are derived from ICBM's I would suspect that they \nuse storable propellants which don't have the ullage problem that cryo's \ndo. If there is no cryo at the sight at all, the addition of these systems \ncould be big $$, not to mention the real tech transfer issues involved with \nproviding centaur GSE to Russia. That issue alone might be enough to kill \nthis idea.
Well, if you're going to get upset with this, you might as well direct\nsome of this moral outrage towards Glavcosmos as well.  They pioneered\nthis capitalist application of booster adverts long before NASA.\n(Sign of the times: a Sony logo on a Soyuz launcher...)\n\n\nThis sounds like something Lowell Wood would think of.  Does anyone\nknow if he's involved?\n\n\nThis may be the purpose for the University of Colorado people.  My\nguess is that the purpose for the Livermore people is to learn how to\nbuild large, inflatable space structures.\n\n\nIf this is true, I think it's a great idea.\n\nLearning how to build to build structures in space in an essential\nstep towards space development, and given that Freedom appears to be\nshrinking towards the vanishing point, I question whether NASA's space\nstation is going to provide much, if any, knowledge in this area.\n(Especially if a design such as Faget's wingless orbiter is chosen...)\nIf such a project also monitors ozone depletion and demonstrates\ncreative use of (partial) private sector funding in the process -- so\nmuch the better.\n\n\nAnd does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\nnews blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\nidea" stage or does it have real funding?\n\n\nNot yet.  Though, if this project goes through, I suppose The Return\nof Jeremy Rifkin is inevitable...\n--\n_______________________________________________________________________________

Afraid I can't give any more info on this.. and hoping someone in greter\nNETLAND has some details.\n\nA short story in the newspaper a few days ago made some sort of mention\nabout how the Japanese, using what sounded like a gravity assist, had just\nmanaged to crash (or crash-land) a package on the moon.\n\nthe article was very vague and unclear.  and, to make matters worse, I\ndidn't clip it.\n\ndoes this jog anyone's memory?

Kerry-- I'm guessing a little at this, because it's been a few years \nsince I saw the info, but you will probably want to look at Air Defense \nArtillery as a specialty, or possibly Signals.  The kind of thing you're \nlooking for is SDI-type assignments, but it'll be pretty prosaic stuff.\nThings like hard-kill ATBM missiles, some of the COBRA rigs -- that kind \nof thing.  \n\nHope that gives you some ideas on where to look, though.
First I've heard of it. Offhand:\n\nGriffin is no longer an "office" head, so that's bad.\n\nOn the other hand:\n\nRegress seemed to think: we can't fund anything by Griffin, because\nthat would mean (and we have the lies by the old hardliners about the\n$ 400 billion mars mission to prove it) that we would be buying into a\nmission to Mars that would cost 400 billion. Therefore there will be\nno Artemis or 20 million dollar lunar orbiter et cetera...\n\nThey were killing Griffin's main program simply because some sycophants\nsomewhere had Congress beleivin that to do so would simply be to buy into\nthe same old stuff. Sorta like not giving aid to Yeltsin because he's\na communist hardliner.\n\nAt least now the sort of reforms Griffin was trying to bring forward\nwon't be trapped in their own little easily contained and defunded\nghetto. That Griffin is staying in some capacity is very very very\ngood. And if he brings something up, noone can say "why don't you go\nback to the OSE where you belong" (and where he couldn't even get money\nfor design studies).
...text of options "A" and "B" deleted...\n\n\nOnly 10KW?\n\n\nHa!  "North America Modular SPACE STATION construction" :-)\nSame apprach, same reasoning: "construction occurs under assembly\nline conditions, no random weather problems interupting site-work\non your home - better quality control" -- sounds like first "-"\npoint above :-)\n\nSomehow I have a strange attraction for this idea (living in\na modular home maybe has altered my mind).  The only thing\nthat scares me is the part about simply strapping 3 SSME's and\na nosecone on it and "just launching it."  I have this vision\nof something going terribly wrong with the launch resulting in the\ncomplete loss of the new modular space station (not just a peice of\nit as would be the case with staged in-orbit construction).

Suppose the Soviets had managed to get their moon rocket working\nand had made it first.  They could have beaten us if either:\n\n* Their rocket hadn't blown up on the pad thus setting them back,\n\nand/or\n\n* A Saturn V went boom.\n\nIf they had beaten us, I speculate that the US would have gone\nhead and done some landings, but we also would have been more\ndetermined to set up a base (both in Earth Orbit and on the\nMoon).  Whether or not we would be on Mars by now would depend\nupon whether the Soviets tried to go.  Setting up a lunar base\nwould have stretched the budgets of both nations and I think\nthat the military value of a lunar base would outweigh the value\nof going to Mars (at least in the short run).  Thus we would\nhave concentrated on the moon.

Actually, they are legal! I not familiar with the ad you are speaking of\nbut knowing Popular Science it is probably on the fringe.  However, you\nmay be speaking of "Public Missle, Inc.", which is a legitimate company\nthat has been around for a while.\n\nDue to advances in composite fuels, engines are now available for model\nrockets using similar composites to SRB fuel, roughly 3 times more \npowerful than black powder motors.  They are even available in a reloadable\nform, i.e. aluminum casing, end casings, o-rings (!).  The engines range\nfrom D all the way to M in common manufacture, N and O I've heard of\nused at special occasions.\n\nTo be a model rocket, however, the rocket can't contain any metal \nstructural parts, amongst other requirements.  I've never heard of a\nmodel rocket doing 50,000.  I have heard of > 20,000 foot flights.\nThese require FAA waivers (of course!).  There are a few large national\nlaunches (LDRS, FireBALLS), at which you can see many > K sized engine\nflights.  Actually, using a > G engine constitutes the area of "High\nPower Rocketry", which is seperate from normal model rocketry.  Purchase\nof engines like I have been describing require membership in the National\nAssociation of Rocketry, the Tripoli Rocketry Assoc., or you have to\nbe part of an educational institute or company involved in rocketry.\n\nAmatuer rocketry is another area.  I'm not really familiar with this,\nbut it is an area where metal parts are allowed, along with liquid fuels\nand what not.  I don't know what kind of regulations are involved, but\nI'm sure they are numerous.

Ethnocentric USian that I am, I've assumed that we and the\nxUSSR were the only countries with significant capabilities to track\nnon-cooperative objects in low Earth orbit. Grazing in a couple of \ndatabases recently,  I found that Japan has some optical capabilities\nalong this line, and also uses a radar designed for other purposes\nfor orbital debris surveys (it isn't clear whether the radar can \ndetermine orbital elements for the objects it detects).

Radio Atmospheric Science Center.\nIn International Council of Scientific Unions, Middle Atmosphere Program.\nHandbook for MAP, Vol. 20 5 p\nPublication Date: Jun. 1986\n      As the first attempt among MST (mesosphere stratosphere \ntroposphere) type radars, the MU (middle and upper atmosphere) radar \nfeatures an active phased array system. Unlike the conventional large \nVHF radars, in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed \nto individual antenna elements, each of 475 solid state power amplifier \nfeeds each antenna element. This system configuration enables very fast \nbeam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the \nantenna into independent subarrays, because phase shift and signal \ndivision/combination are performed at a low signal level using \nelectronic devices under control of a computer network. The antenna \nbeam can be switched within 10 microsec to any direction within the \nzenith angle of 30 deg. Since a precise phase alignment of each element \nis crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system, careful \ncalibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna \nelement was carried out. Among various aircraft which may be used for \nthis purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of being able to \nmake a long term monitoring with the same system. An antenna pattern \nmonitoring system for the MU radar was developed using the scientific \nsatellite OHZORA (EXOS-C). A receiver named MUM (MU radar antenna \nMonitor) on board the satellite measures a CW signal of 100 to 400 \nwatts transmitted from the MU radar. The principle of the measurement \nand results are discussed.

Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design\n    team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.\n\n\n    ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into\n    Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20\n    Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas\n    scintillation proportional counters.\n\n\n    CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint\n    NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian\n    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini\n    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.\n    After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA\n    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon\n    arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an\n    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens\n    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of\n    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours\n    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the\n    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter\n    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan\n    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and\n    targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the\n    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn's atmosphere,\n    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn's\n    satellites, and characterize Titan's atmosphere and surface.\n\n    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its\n    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that\n    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These\n    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain\n    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to\n    peer through Titan's clouds and determine if there is liquid on the\n    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will\n    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.\n\n    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the\n    first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of\n    Saturn's satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan\n    atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan\n    Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true\n    nature of Saturn's rings.\n\n	 Key Scheduled Dates for the Cassini Mission (VVEJGA Trajectory)\n	 -------------------------------------------------------------\n	   10/06/97 - Titan IV/Centaur Launch\n	   04/21/98 - Venus 1 Gravity Assist\n	   06/20/99 - Venus 2 Gravity Assist\n	   08/16/99 - Earth Gravity Assist\n	   12/30/00 - Jupiter Gravity Assist\n	   06/25/04 - Saturn Arrival\n	   01/09/05 - Titan Probe Release\n	   01/30/05 - Titan Probe Entry\n	   06/25/08 - End of Primary Mission\n	    (Schedule last updated 7/22/92)\n\n\n    GALILEO - Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe, in transit.

The satellite also\n    will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.\n\n\n    ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over\n    its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields\n    experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for\n    various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.\n\n    Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of\n    the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from\n    that planet by sliding over Jupiter's north pole in a gravity-assist\n    manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted\n    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun's south pole\n    in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its\n    perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that's right, a solar-studies spacecraft\n    that's always further from the Sun than the Earth is!\n\n    While in Jupiter's neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and\n    radiation environment. For a short summary of these results, see\n    *Science*, V. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992).

I'm attempting to track changes based\n    on updated shuttle manifests; corrections and updates are welcome.\n\n    1993 Missions\n	o ALEXIS [spring, Pegasus]\n	    ALEXIS (Array of Low-Energy X-ray Imaging Sensors) is to perform\n	    a wide-field sky survey in the "soft" (low-energy) X-ray\n	    spectrum. It will scan the entire sky every six months to search\n	    for variations in soft-X-ray emission from sources such as white\n	    dwarfs, cataclysmic variable stars and flare stars. It will also\n	    search nearby space for such exotic objects as isolated neutron\n	    stars and gamma-ray bursters. ALEXIS is a project of Los Alamos\n	    National Laboratory and is primarily a technology development\n	    mission that uses astrophysical sources to demonstrate the\n	    technology. Contact project investigator Jeffrey J Bloch\n	    (jjb@beta.lanl.gov) for more information.\n\n	o Wind [Aug, Delta II rocket]\n	    Satellite to measure solar wind input to magnetosphere.\n\n	o Space Radar Lab [Sep, STS-60 SRL-01]\n	    Gather radar images of Earth's surface.\n\n	o Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer [Dec, Pegasus rocket]\n	    Study of Stratospheric ozone.\n\n	o SFU (Space Flyer Unit) [ISAS]\n	    Conducting space experiments and observations and this can be\n	    recovered after it conducts the various scientific and\n	    engineering experiments. SFU is to be launched by ISAS and\n	    retrieved by the U.S. Space Shuttle on STS-68 in 1994.\n\n    1994\n	o Polar Auroral Plasma Physics [May, Delta II rocket]\n	    June, measure solar wind and ions and gases surrounding the\n	    Earth.\n\n	o IML-2 (STS) [NASDA, Jul 1994 IML-02]\n	    International Microgravity Laboratory.\n\n	o ADEOS [NASDA]\n	    Advanced Earth Observing Satellite.\n\n	o MUSES-B (Mu Space Engineering Satellite-B) [ISAS]\n	    Conducting research on the precise mechanism of space structure\n	    and in-space astronomical observations of electromagnetic waves.\n\n    1995\n	LUNAR-A [ISAS]\n	    Elucidating the crust structure and thermal construction of the\n	    moon's interior.\n\n\n    Proposed Missions:\n	o Advanced X-ray Astronomy Facility (AXAF)\n	    Possible launch from shuttle in 1995, AXAF is a space\n	    observatory with a high resolution telescope. It would orbit for\n	    15 years and study the mysteries and fate of the universe.\n\n	o Earth Observing System (EOS)\n	    Possible launch in 1997, 1 of 6 US orbiting space platforms to\n	    provide long-term data (15 years) of Earth systems science\n	    including planetary evolution.\n\n	o Mercury Observer\n	    Possible 1997 launch.\n\n	o Lunar Observer\n	    Possible 1997 launch, would be sent into a long-term lunar\n	    orbit.

Archive-name: space/data\nLast-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:07 $\n\nONLINE AND OTHER SOURCES OF IMAGES, DATA, ETC.\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n    A wide variety of images, data, catalogs, information releases, and\n    other material dealing with space and astronomy may be found on the net.\n    A few sites offer direct dialup access or remote login access, while the\n    remainder support some form of file transfer. Many sites are listed as\n    providing 'anonymous FTP'. This refers to the File Transfer Protocol on\n    the Internet. Sites not connected to the Internet cannot use FTP\n    directly, but there are a few automated FTP servers which operates via\n    email. Send mail containing only the word HELP to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com\n    or bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu, and the servers will send you instructions\n    on how to make requests.\n\n    The sources with the broadest selection of material are the NASA Ames\n    SPACE archive and the National Space Science Data Center.\n\n    Don't even ask for images to be posted to the net. The data volume is\n    huge and nobody wants to spend the time on it.\n\n\nVIEWING IMAGES\n\n    The possible combinations of image formats and machines is forebodingly\n    large, and I won't attempt to cover common formats (GIF, etc.) here. To\n    read PDS and VICAR (and many other) formats on Unix systems running X,\n    use XV 2.11, available by anonymous FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu\n    (18.24.0.12) in contrib/xv-2.11.tar.Z and the other standard X11 FTP\n    sites.\n\n    The FAQ for the Usenet group alt.binaries.pictures discusses image\n    formats and how to get image viewing software. A copy of this document\n    is available by anonymous FTP from the Usenet FAQ archives at\n    pit-manager.mit.edu (18.72.1.58), in directory\n    pub/usenet/alt.binaries.pictures.\n\n\nONLINE ARCHIVES\n\n    NASA AMES\n\n    Extensive archives are maintained at NASA Ames and are available via\n    anonymous FTP or an email server. These archives include many images and\n    a wide variety of documents including this FAQ list, NASA press\n    releases, shuttle launch advisories, and mission status reports. Please\n    note that these are NOT maintained on an official basis.\n\n    FTP users should connect to ames.arc.nasa.gov (128.102.18.3) and look in\n    pub/SPACE. pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the\n    archive (the index is about 200K by itself).\n\n    To access the archives by email, send a letter to\n    archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). In the\n    subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:\n\n	send SPACE Index\n	send SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91.\n\n    The capitalization of the subdirectory names is important. All are in\n    caps. Only text files are handled by the email server at present; use\n    one of the FTP email servers described in the introduction to this\n    section for images or programs.\n\n    The Magellan Venus and Voyager Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus CD-ROM image\n    disks have been put online in the CDROM and CDROM2 directories. The\n    disks will be rotated on a weekly basis. Thousands of images are\n    available in these collections.\n\n    The GIF directory contains images in GIF format. The VICAR directory\n    contains Magellan images in VICAR format (these are also available in\n    the GIF directory). A PC program capable of displaying these files is\n    found in the IMDISP directory (see the item "VIEWING IMAGES" below).\n\n    The NASA media guide describes the various NASA centers and how to\n    contact their public affairs officers; this may be useful when pursuing\n    specific information. It's in MISC/media.guide.\n\n    Any problems with the archive server should be reported to Peter Yee\n    (yee@ames.arc.nasa.gov).\n\n\n    NASA ASTROPHYSICS DATA SYSTEM\n\n    The ADS is a distributed data retrieval system which is easy to use and\n    provides uniform access to ground-based and space-based astronomy data\n    from NASA data centers across the country. It currently has over 140\n    data catalogs of radio, infrared, optical, UV, and X-ray data which can\n    be queried by position or any other parameter in the catalog. The ADS\n    also provides tools to manipulate and plot tabular results. In addition,\n    ADS has a Beta version of an Abstracts Service which allows users to\n    query over 125,000 abstracts of astronomy papers since 1975 by authors,\n    keywords, title words, or abstract text words.\n\n    ADS use requires direct Internet access. For more info and to sign up to\n    become a user, email ads@cuads.coloradu.edu. The User's Guide and\n    "QuickStart" Guide are available by anonymous FTP to sao-ftp.harvard.edu\n    in directory pub/ads/ADS_User_Guide (PostScript files).\n\n    Contact Carolyn Stern Grant (stern@cfa.harvard.edu).\n\n\n    NASA JET PROPULSION LAB (MISSION INFORMATION AND IMAGES)\n\n    pubinfo.jpl.nasa.gov (128.149.6.2) is an anonymous FTP site operated by\n    the JPL Public Information Office, containing news releases, status\n    reports, fact sheets, images, and other data on JPL missions.

The system is specifically designed for\n    teachers. The data base is arranged to provide easy access to current\n    and historical information on NASA aeronautics, space research, and\n    technology transfer information. Also included are suggested classroom\n    activities that incorporate information on NASA projects to teach a\n    number of scientific principles. Unlike bulletin board systems, NASA\n    Spacelink does not provide for interaction between callers. However it\n    does allow teachers and other callers to leave questions and comments\n    for NASA which may be answered by regular mail. Messages are answered\n    electronically, even to acknowledge requests which will be fulfilled by\n    mail. Messages are generally handled the next working day except during\n    missions when turnaround times increase. The mail system is closed-loop\n    between the user and NASA.\n\n    SpaceLink also offers downloadable shareware and public domain programs\n    useful for science educators as well as space graphics and GIF images\n    from NASA's planetary probes and the Hubble Telescope.\n\n    You can dial in at (205)-895-0028 (300/1200/2400/9600(V.32) baud, 8\n    bits, no parity, 1 stop bit), or telnet to spacelink.msfc.nasa.gov\n    (128.158.13.250, also known as xsl.msfc.nasa.gov) if you're on the\n    Internet. Anonymous FTP capability (password guest) is now available.\n\n    Most of this information is also available from the Ames server in\n    directory SPACELINK.\n\n\n    NATIONAL SPACE SCIENCE DATA CENTER (NSSDC)\n\n    The National Space Science Data Center is the official clearinghouse for\n    NASA data. The data catalog (*not* the data itself) is available online.\n    Internet users can telnet to nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov (128.183.36.23) and\n    log in as 'NODIS' (no password).

Every time you read about a shuttle landing they mention the double sonic  \nbooms.  Having taken various relevant classes, I have several ideas of where  \nthey come from, but none of them are very convincing.  Exactly what causes  \nthem?  Are they a one time pheneomenon, or a constant one like the supersonic  \nshockwave that is constantly produced by a plane, but you hear only when it  \ngoes over you?\n\n---\n---------------------------------------------------------------------

Phil> Didn't one of the early jet fighters have these?  I also think\nPhil> the germans did some work on these in WWII.\n\nThe NACA came up with them before World War II.  NASA is directly\ndescended from the NACA, with space added in.\n\nYou'll notice that I didn't mention sweep wings even though the\nX-5, tested at what's now Dryden, had them.  We did steal that one\ndirctly from the Germans.  The difference is that swept wings don't\nchange their angle of sweep, sweep wings do.  Perhaps the similarity\nof names has caused some confusion?  747s have swept wings, F-111s\nhave sweep wings.\n\n\nPhil> A lot of this was also done by the military...\n\nAfter NASA aerodynamicists proposed them and NASA test teams\ndemonstrated them.  Richard Whitcomb and R.T. Jones, at Langley\nResearch Center, were giants in the field.\n\nDryden was involved in the flight testing of winglets and area\nruling (in the 70s and 50s, respectively).  It's true that we\nused military aircraft as the testbeds (KC-135 and YF-102) but\nthat had more to do with availability and need than with military\ninvolvement.  The YF-102 was completely ours and the KC-135 was\nbailed to us.  The Air Force, of course, was interested in our\nresults and supportive of our efforts.\n\nDryden flew the first digital fly by wire aircraft in the 70s. No\nmechnaical or analog backup, to show you how confident we were.\nGeneral Dynamics decided to make the F-16 flyby-wire when they saw how\nsuccessful we were.  (Mind you, the Avro Arrow and the X-15 were both\nfly-by-wire aircraft much earlier, but analog.)\n\nPhil> Egad! I'm disagreeing with Mary Shafer!  \n\nThe NASA habit of acquiring second-hand military aircraft and using\nthem for testbeds can make things kind of confusing.  On the other\nhand, all those second-hand Navy planes give our test pilots a chance\nto fold the wings--something most pilots at Edwards Air Force Base\ncan't do.
Lets hear it for Dan Goldin...now if he can only convince the rest of\nour federal government that the space program is a worth while\ninvestment!\n\nI hope that I will live to see the day we walk on Mars, but\nwe need to address the technical hurdles first!  If there's sufficient\ninterest, maybe we should consider starting a sci.space group \ndevoted to the technical analysis of long-duration human spaceflight.\nMost of you regulars know that I'm interested in starting this analysis\nas soon as possible.
The sightings were apparently spurious.  There is no planet inside of\nthe orbit of Mercury.\n\nThe idea of Vulcan came from the differences between Mercury's observed\nperihelion precession and the value it should have had according to\nNewtonian physics.  Leverrier made an extensive set of observations\nand calculations during the mid 19th century, and Simon Newcombe later\nimproved on the observations and re-calculated using Leverrier's system\nof equations.  Now Leverrier was one of the co-discoverers of Neptune\nand since he had predicted its existence based on anomalies in the orbit\nof Uranus his inclination was to believe the same sort of thing was\nafoot with Mercury.\n\nBut alas, 'twere not so.  Mercury's perihelion precesses at the rate\nit does because the space where it resides near the sun is significantly\ncurved due to the sun's mass.  This explanation had to wait until 1915\nand Albert Einstein's synthesis of his earlier theory of the electrodynamics\nof moving bodies (commonly called Special Relativity) with Reimanian \ngeometry.  The result was the General Theory of Relativity, and one of\nit's most noteworthy strengths is that it accounts for the precession\nof Mercury's perihelion almost exactly.  (Exactly if you use Newcomb's\nnumbers rather than Leverrier's.)\n\nOf course not everybody believes Einstein, and that's fine.  But subsequent\nefforts to find any planets closer to the sun than Mercury using radar\nhave been fruitless.\n\n-Bill Gawne\n\n "Forgive him, he is a barbarian, who thinks the customs of his tribe\n  are the laws of the universe."                       - G.

Ed Campion\nHeadquarters, Washington, D.C.                             April 23, 1993\n(Phone:  202/358-1780)\n\nKyle Herring\nJohnson Space Center, Houston\n(Phone:  713/483-5111)\n\nRELEASE:  93-76\n\nHUBBLE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSION SCHEDULED FOR ELEVEN DAYS\n\n	The December flight of Endeavour on Space Shuttle mission STS-61 to\nservice the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has been scheduled as an 11 day\nmission designed to accommodate a record five spacewalks with the capability\nfor an additional two, if needed.\n\n	The decision to schedule five extravehicular activities, or EVAs, was\nreached following extensive evaluations of underwater training, maneuver times\nrequired using the Shuttle's robot arm based on software simulations and actual\nEVA tasks on previous missions.\n\n	"Basically what we've done by going to five EVAs rather than three is\nto repackage our margin so that we have the capability to respond to the\ndynamics, or unknowns, of spacewalks," Mission Director Randy Brinkley said.\n"It improves the probabilities for mission success while providing added\nflexibility and adaptability for reacting to real-time situations."\n\n	In laying out the specific tasks to be completed on each of the\nspacewalks, officials have determined that changing out the gyros, solar arrays\nand the Wide Field/Planetary Camera (WF/PC) and installing the Corrective\nOptics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) are priority objectives\nduring the mission.\n\n	"When we looked at accomplishing all of the tasks, highest through\nlowest priority, and recognizing that the major tasks -- gyros, solar arrays,\nWF/PC and COSTAR -- would consume most of the time set aside for each\nspacewalk, five EVAs were deemed appropriate," said Milt Heflin, Lead Flight\nDirector for the mission.\n\n	While the five spacewalks will be unprecedented, the use of two\nalternating spacewalk teams will alleviate placing more stress on the crew than\nprevious missions requiring two, three or four EVAs.\n\n	"We have paid close attention to lessons learned during previous\nspacewalks and factored these into our timeline estimates for five EVAs,"\nHeflin said.  "In planning for all Space Shuttle missions, it is necessary to\nformulate a work schedule that represents as realistic a timeline as possible\nto accomplish the mission objectives."\n\n	Planning currently calls for at least five water tank training sessions\nthat include support from the Mission Control Center, called joint integrated\nsimulations, lasting between 10 and 36 hours.  In addition, many stand alone\nunderwater training "runs" will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk.\n\n	Various refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will be\nmade based on actual training experience during the months prior to the\nmission.  Also, lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flight\nwill be valuable in assisting the STS-61 crew in its training techniques.\n\n	Endeavour's June flight and Discovery's July mission both will include\nspacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the HST mission.\nThe evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between the\nactual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks at\nthe Johnson Space Center, Houston, and the Marshall Space Flight Center,\nHuntsville, Ala.\n\n	Also, the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gaining\nfurther insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand the\nexperience levels among the astronaut corps, the flight controllers and\ntrainers.\n\n	Designed to be serviced by a Space Shuttle crew, Hubble was built with\ngrapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures.\n\n	The telescope was launched aboard Discovery in April 1990.  At that\ntime the NASA mixed fleet manifest showed the first revisit mission to HST in\n1993 to change out science instruments and make any repairs that may have\nbecome necessary.
Hi,\n    I was reading through "The Spaceflight Handbook" and somewhere in\nthere the author discusses solar sails and the forces acting on them\nwhen and if they try to gain an initial acceleration by passing close to\nthe sun in a hyperbolic orbit. The magnitude of such accelerations he\nestimated to be on the order of 700g. He also says that this is may not\nbe a big problem for manned craft because humans (and this was published\nin 1986) have already withstood accelerations of 45g. All this is very\nlong-winded but here's my question finally - Are 45g accelerations in\nfact humanly tolerable? - with the aid of any mechanical devices of\ncourse. If these are possible, what is used to absorb the acceleration?\nCan this be extended to larger accelerations?
I would guess not.  Dr. Neil Gehrels of CGRO is the son of Dr. Tom\nGehrels of the University of Arizona.  Since he's long had research\ninterests in asteroids and other solar-system astronomy, Tom is the\none more likely to have discovered  a comet (and thus had his name\nattached to it).\n\nTom Gehrels is a leader in the Spacewatch project, which has recently\nincreased mankind's discovery rate on near-Earth asteroids (they're\nfinding a couple every month).  For much more on this interesting guy,\nread his autobiography, *On a Glassy Sea*.
The gravity data is collected in real-time and it not recorded to the tape\nrecorder.  However, you only need to collect the gravity every 3rd or 4th\norbit, so there is no real data loss if the Moon blocks transmission for\na short while.
Hey!  My dad has an old hangar and Judy has some old rockets in her attic,\nlet's put on a Lunar program! . . .  Sounds good, but . . .\nLet's play a game - What would be a reasonable reward?  What companies would\nhave a reasonable shot at pulling off such a feat?  Just where in the\nbudget would the reward come from?  Should there be a time limit?  Would a\nstraight cash money award be enough or should we throw in say . . . \nexclusive mining rights for the first fifty years? You get the idea.\n\nI'd like to play but I don't have a clue to the answers.
Sounds similar to something Wally Schirra said.
The Apollo astronauts also trained at (in) Meteor Crater in the Flagstaff\narea (Arizona).  There is now a museum with a space shop.\nCaution: they ease you by 6$. Compared to a KSC visit it's not worth.
The Apollo program cost something like $25 billion at a time when\nthe value of a dollar was worth more than it is now. No one would \ntake the offer.

As far as we know it has no\n > materials we can't get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids\n > and comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in low\n > grade fusion reactors.\n\nI don't know what a "low grade" fusion reactor is, but the major\nproblem with 3He (aside from the difficulty in making any fusion\nreactor work) is that its concentration in lunar regolith is just so\nsmall -- on the order of 5 ppb or so, on average (more in some\nfractions, but still very small).  Massive amounts of regolith would\nhave to be processed.\n\nThis thread reminds me of Wingo's claims some time ago about the moon\nas a source of titanium for use on earth.  As I recall, Wingo wasn't\ncontent with being assured that titanium (at .5% in the Earth's crust,\naverage) would not run out, and touted lunar mines, even though the\nmarket price of ilmenite concentrate these days is around $.06/pound.\nThis prompted me to look up large potential terrestrial sources.\n\nOn the moon, titanium occurs in basalts; "high-Ti" basalts (Apollo 11\nand 17) have 8-14% titanium dioxide (by weight).  This is nice, but...\nterrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched in\ntitanium.  They very often have 3% TiO2, frequently have 4%, and\nsometimes even 5% TiO2 (again, by weight).  These flood basalts are\n*enormous* -- millions of cubic kilometers, scattered all over the\nworld (Siberia, Brazil, the NW United States, Ethiopia, etc.).  If\neven 1% of the basalts are 5% TiO2, this is trillions of tons of TiO2\nat concentrations only a factor of 2-3 less than in lunar high-Ti\nbasalts.  It is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the moon\ncould be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of the\nore (never mind the richer, but less common, terrestrial ores being\nmined today).
DC-X as is today isn't suitable for this. However, the followon SDIO\nfunds will. A reusable sounding rocket was always SDIO's goal.\n\n\nSo did I. There is a lot going on now and some reports are due soon \nwhich should be very favorable. The insiders have been very bush briefing\nthe right people and it is now paying off.\n\nHowever, public support is STILL critical. In politics you need to keep\nconstant pressure on elected officials.\n\n  Allen
Also in pure speculation:\n\nParity errors in memory or previously known conditions that were waivered.\n   "Yes that is an error, but we already knew about it"\n\nAny problem where they decided a backup would handle it.\n\nAny problem in an area that was not criticality 1,2,3..., that is, any\n   problem in a system they decided they could do without.\n\nI'd be curious as to what the real meaning of the quote is.
There was an interesting article in Scientific American some time ago\nabout breathing liquid. (It was a few months before _The Abyss_ came out.)\nAs far as I can remember, they mentioned three things that were difficult\nto do at once with a substitute breathing fluid:\n  - low viscosity --- if it's too difficult to force the fluid in & out \n    of the lungs, you can't extract enough oxygen to power your own\n    breathing effort (let alone anything else)\n\n  - diffusion rate --- obviously, not all the air in your lungs is\n    expelled when you breathe out; and the part that isn't expelled\n    is the part that's nearest the walls of the alveoli. (alveolus?)\n    So the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done\n    by diffusion of the gas through the fluid. Apparently oxygen\n    tends to diffuse more readily than CO2, so even if you can get enough\n    oxygen in, you might not be able to get enough CO2 out.\n\n  - oxygen/CO2 capacity --- you have to be able to dissolve enough\n    gas per unit volume. \n\n  Oh, and of course, your new breathing fluid must not irritate the lungs\nor interfere with their healing or anything like that...
Actually, the reboost will probably be done last, so that there is a fuel\nreserve during the EVAs (in case they have to chase down an adrift\nastronaut or something like that).  But yes, you've got the idea -- the\nreboost is done by taking the whole shuttle up.\n\n\nSomebody has to build that thruster module; it's not an off-the-shelf\nitem.  Nor is it a trivial piece of hardware, since it has to include\nattitude control (HST's own is not strong enough to compensate for things\nlike thruster imbalance), guidance (there is no provision to feed gyro\ndata from HST's own gyros to an external device), and separation (you\ndon't want it left attached afterward, if only to avoid possible\ncontamination after the telescope lid is opened again).  You also get\nto worry about whether the lid is going to open after the reboost is\ndone and HST is inaccessible to the shuttle (the lid stays closed for\nthe duration of all of this to prevent mirror contamination from\nthrusters and the like).\n\nThe original plan was to use the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle to do the\nreboost.  The OMV was planned to be a sort of small space tug, well\nsuited to precisely this sort of job.  Unfortunately, it was costing\na lot to develop and the list of definitely-known applications was\nrelatively short, so it got cancelled.
Archive-name: space/probe\nLast-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:19 $\n\nPLANETARY PROBES - HISTORICAL MISSIONS\n\n    This section was lightly adapted from an original posting by Larry Klaes\n    (klaes@verga.enet.dec.com), mostly minor formatting changes. Matthew\n    Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on\n    Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material\n    posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).\n\nUS PLANETARY MISSIONS\n\n\n    MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)\n\n    MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed\n    minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground\n    stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the\n    onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in\n    the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the\n    Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed\n    to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a\n    transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted\n    from the expression "R-dot-bar sub n" (nth smoothed value of derivative\n    of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations\n    of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.\n\n    MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December\n    of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a\n    very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world\n    with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide\n    (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).\n\n    MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective\n    shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary\n    space. Unable to collect the Sun's energy for power from its solar\n    panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in\n    solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.\n\n    MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and\n    took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it\n    flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere\n    much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from\n    this preliminary scan that Mars was a "dead" world in both the\n    geological and biological sense.\n\n    MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that\n    planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information\n    that Venus' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times\n    that of Earth's, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface\n    of an ocean.\n\n    MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work\n    done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away\n    the concept of Mars as a "dead" planet, first made from the basic\n    measurements of MARINER 4.\n\n    MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket\n    launcher autopilot failed.\n\n    MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to\n    orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no\n    other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian\n    surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once\n    flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup\n    images of Mars' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.\n\n    MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe\n    did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in\n    ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,\n    plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four\n    Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974\n    to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed\n    Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than\n    thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which\n    makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.\n\n\n    PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)\n\n    PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph\n    the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide\n    new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new\n    data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft\n    had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on\n    October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.\n\n    PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first\n    U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally\n    designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead\n    studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to\n    36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6\n    through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,\n    and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would\n    have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.\n\n    PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER\n    11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to\n    study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through\n    1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever\n    to do so.\n\n    PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER\n    12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made\n    the first radar studies of the planet's surface via probe. PIONEER Venus\n    2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere\n    in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the\n    atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the\n    surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day\n    probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before\n    its batteries failed.\n\n\n    RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)\n\n    RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They\n    were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems\n    left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.\n\n    RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an\n    instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the\n    launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.\n    RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the\n    camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.\n\n    RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but\n    suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,\n    the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.\n\n    RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost\n    all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon\n    and drifted off into solar orbit.\n\n    RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send\n    back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact\n    with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras\n    did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first\n    U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.\n\n\n    LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)\n\n    LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image\n    various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO\n    missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our\n    understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.\n    All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were\n    essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.\n    probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar\n    surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.\n\n\n    SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)\n\n    The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar\n    module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the\n    soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered\n    in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing\n    vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was\n    strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.\n\n    Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the\n    first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images\n    and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from\n    SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,\n    the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored\n    the Tycho crater region in 1968.\n\n\n    VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)\n\n    VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on\n    a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June\n    19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse\n    Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for\n    Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes\n    found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of\n    its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars' sky was\n    pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is\n    pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the\n    thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and\n    boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.\n\n    The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran\n    out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a\n    weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep\n    functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command\n    had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until\n    further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the\n    engineers' efforts through May of 1983.\n\n    An interesting side note: VIKING 1's lander has been designated the\n    Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the\n    lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,\n    D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until\n    it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.\n\n    VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit\n    on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in\n    Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its\n    sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording\n    one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in\n    1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut\n    down on April 12, 1980.\n\n    The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.\n\n\n    VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)\n\n    VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March\n    5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched\n    August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,\n    1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and\n    by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare\n    once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to\n    outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,\n    but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.\n\n    Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their\n    satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered\n    that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and\n    aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major\n    surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous\n    volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.\n\n    When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets\n    and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep\n    the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive\n    jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle\n    is known). Titan's atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas' appearance was\n    startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.\n    The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,\n    kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.\n\n    VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,\n    continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly\n    monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was\n    found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational\n    axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on\n    Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10\n    satellites and one more ring were discovered.\n\n    In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,\n    including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright\n    patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were\n    discovered. Neptune's magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a\n    canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What's liquid at 38K?)\n\n    The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their\n    on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets\n    beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the\n    location of the heliopause.\n\n\nSOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS\n\n    Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and\n    Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:\n\n\n    SOVIET LUNAR PROBES\n\n    LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first\n	     craft in solar orbit.\n    LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.\n    LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.\n    ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3. Was\n	     also a test for future Mars missions.\n    LUNA 9 - First probe to soft land on the Moon in 1966, returned images\n	     from surface.\n    LUNA 10 - First probe to orbit the Moon in 1966.\n    LUNA 13 - Second successful Soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966.\n    ZOND 5 - First successful circumlunar craft. ZOND 6 through 8\n	     accomplished similar missions through 1970. The probes were\n	     unmanned tests of a manned orbiting SOYUZ-type lunar vehicle.\n    LUNA 16 - First probe to land on Moon and return samples of lunar soil\n	      to Earth in 1970. LUNA 20 accomplished similar mission in\n	      1972.\n    LUNA 17 - Delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the Moon's\n	      surface, LUNOKHOD 1, in 1970. A similar feat was accomplished\n	      with LUNA 21/LUNOKHOD 2 in 1973.\n    LUNA 24 - Last Soviet lunar mission to date. Returned soil samples in\n	      1976.\n\n\n    SOVIET VENUS PROBES\n\n    VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions\n	       lost enroute in 1961.\n    VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with\n	       VENERA 3. Probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in\n	       February of 1966. No images were returned.\n    VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface.\n	       Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe\n	       became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.\n    VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending\n	       through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before\n	       reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles\n	       similar in 1969.\n    VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet\n	       in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in\n	       1972.\n    VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975. Was also the\n	       first probe to orbit Venus. VENERA 10 accomplished similar\n	       mission.\n    VENERA 13 - Returned first color images of Venusian surface in 1982.\n		VENERA 14 accomplished similar mission.\n    VENERA 15 - Accomplished radar mapping with VENERA 16 of sections of\n		planet's surface in 1983 more detailed than PVO.\n    VEGA 1 - Accomplished with VEGA 2 first balloon probes of Venusian\n	     atmosphere in 1985, including two landers. Flyby buses went on\n	     to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in\n	     March of 1986.\n\n\n    SOVIET MARS PROBES\n\n    MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased\n	     enroute the following year.\n    ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian\n	     surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.\n    MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian\n	     surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red\n	     Planet in 1971.\n    MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander\n	     signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.\n    MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to\n	     fire, probe went on into solar orbit.\n    MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in\n	     1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S.\n	     probe MARINER 9.\n    MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.\n    MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit\n	     with its flyby bus.\n    PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars' largest\n	       moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to\n	       human/computer error.\n    PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did\n	       enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week\n	       before scheduled Phobos landing.\n\n    While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even\n    interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have\n    yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,\n    Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a\n    Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been\n    planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now\n    the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their\n    space program remains to be seen.\n\n\nJAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS\n\n    SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on\n    January 8 1985, and approached Halley's Comet within about 7 million km\n    on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to\n    measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of\n    which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on\n    January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth's. The closest\n    approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The\n    geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for\n    a Japanese spacecraft.\n\n    During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail\n    passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby\n    will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth's radius)), and the third\n    October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).\n\n\n    HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,\n    1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten\n    once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first\n    lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget\n    satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to\n    orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.\n\n    The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An\n    apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists\n    to lose track of it. Hagoromo's rocket motor fired on schedule on March\n    19, but the spacecraft's tracking transmitter failed immediately. The\n    rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt\n    camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.\n\n    Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and\n    performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth's atmosphere. Hiten\n    made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,\n    1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon's surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and\n    fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into\n    lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the\n    approach:\n\n	Apoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km\n	Periapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km\n	Inclination	: 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane)\n	Period		: 4.7 days\n\n\nPLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES\n\n    I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three\n    groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,\n    and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means\n    complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your\n    research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can\n    add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.\n\n    Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it\n    would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in\n    order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in\n    this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date\n    general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra\n    background. Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good\n    public and university library. Some of the more recently published works\n    can also be purchased in and/or ordered through any good mass- market\n    bookstore.\n\n    General Overviews (in alphabetical order by author):\n\n      J.

Good university libraries will carry\n    these books, and they are easily found simply by knowing which mission\n    you wish to read about. I recommend these works after you first study\n    some of the books listed above.\n\n    Some periodicals I recommend for reading on space probes are NATIONAL\n    GEOGRAPHIC, which has written articles on the PIONEER probes to Earth's\n    Moon Luna and the Jovian planets Jupiter and Saturn, the RANGER,\n    SURVEYOR, LUNAR ORBITER, and APOLLO missions to Luna, the MARINER\n    missions to Mercury, Venus, and Mars, the VIKING probes to Mars, and the\n    VOYAGER missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.\n\n    More details on American, Soviet, European, and Japanese probe missions\n    can be found in SKY AND TELESCOPE, ASTRONOMY, SCIENCE, NATURE, and\n    SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN magazines. TIME, NEWSWEEK, and various major\n    newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions,\n    but also show you what else was going on with Earth at the time events\n    were unfolding, if that is of interest to you. Space missions are\n    affected by numerous political, economic, and climatic factors, as you\n    probably know.\n\n    Depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go, you\n    might also wish to join The Planetary Society, one of the largest space\n    groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration. Their\n    periodical, THE PLANETARY REPORT, details the latest space probe\n    missions. Write to The Planetary Society, 65 North Catalina Avenue,\n    Pasadena, California 91106 USA.\n\n    Good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration. I\n    personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas\n    in this field, and the benefits human society has and will receive from\n    it are incredible, with many yet to be realized.\n\n    Larry Klaes  klaes@verga.enet.dec.com
In the Air Force world at least, the crisis escalates when scale\nmodels of the plane in question (i.e. about to be sacrificed) begin to\narrive in key Senators and Congresspersons' offices.\n\nOf course it is assumed that coffee mugs and other decorative junk has\nbeen tried earlier.\n\nSpiros

Not quite true.  One of the instruments on Mars Observer will be searching\nfor potential fossil sites.
As for SF and advertising in space.

Everbody has been defining envelope.\nWhy was the world "envelope" chosen, rather than say "shell", \nor "boundary".  In analogy with the envelopes of airships perhaps?\n\nActually, "shell" might be good.  Push the shell too hard and\nit (the aircraft?) breaks.
Portuguese launch complex??? Gosh.... Polish are for American in the \nsame way as Portuguese are for Brazilians (I am from Brazil). There is \na joke about the Portuguese Space Agency that wanted to send a \nPortuguese  astronaut to the surface of the Sun (if there is such a thing).\nHow did they solve all problems of sending a man to the surface of the \nSun???

Hum, do you enjoy putting words in my mouth? \nCome to Nome and meet some of these miners.. I am not sure how things go down\nsouth in the lower 48 (I used to visit, but), of course to believe the\nmedia/news its going to heck (or just plain crazy). \nWell it seems that alot of Unionist types seem to think that having a job is a\nright, and not a priviledge. Right to the same job as your forbearers, SEE:\nKennedy's and tel me what you see (and the families they have married into).\nThere is a reason why many historians and poli-sci types use unionist and\nsocialist in the same breath.\nThe miners that I know, are just your average hardworking people who pay there\ntaxes and earn a living.. But taxes are not the answer. But maybe we could move\nthis discussion to some more appropriate newsgroup..
I doubt there are good prospects for  a self armoring system\nfor venus surface conditions (several hundred degrees, very high\npressure of CO2, possibly sulfuric and nitric acids or oxides\nbut it is a notion to consider for outer planets rs where you might\npick up ices under less extream upper atmosphere conditions buying\ndeeper penetration.  A nice creative idea, unlikly but worthy of\nthinking about.
The SDIO has "contracted" with the NRL (Naval Research Laboratory) to fly the Clementine Mission.  BTW we call it DSPSE (Deep Space Project Science Experiment).\n\nThe NRL is building the spacecraft, designing the detailed mission and doing the\nintegration and operations (with help from, JPL & Goddard & prob. some folks I\nhave left out...don't be mad).\n\nI am on the TAMP (Trajectory Analysis & Mission Planning) team and am responsable\nfor the IV&V of the traj that Goddard/CSC are designing.\n\nAs for why SDIO is doing it, some of the reasons are:\n\n   1)  the safety constraints are too tight to try to run the LIDAR in LEO\n\n   2)  in LEO we don't get any new radiation data on the sensors, we will get\n       that data on our 9 passages through the Van Allen (sp?) Belts\n\n   3)  since we are going out there...why not piggy-back some general science\n\n   4)  the intercept problem is a lot easied over LONG distances and LONG times\n\nI am sure there are some things I have forgotten, and some I haven't been told\nbut, those are the reasons we all talk about.\n\n--

Seems like a lot of trouble to go to. Its probably better to   \ninvest in newer launch systems. I don't think a big cost advantage\nfor using Russian systems will last for very long (maybe a few years). \nLockheed would be the place to ask, since you would probably have to buy \nthe Proton from them (they market the Proton world wide except Russia). \nThey should know a lot about the possibilities, I haven't heard them\npropose US launches, so I assume they looked into it and found it \nunprofitable. \n\n\nYes...\n\n\nComparable to the Zenit I suppose, but since it looks like\nnothing will be built there, you might just as well pick any\nspot.\n\nThe message is: to launch now while its cheap and while Russia and\nKazakstan are still cooperating. Later, the story may be different.
Doug-- Actually, if memory serves, the Atlas is an outgrowth of the old \nTitan ICBM.  If so, there's probably quite a few old pads, albeit in need \nof some serious reconditioning.  Still, Being able to buy the turf and \npad (and bunkers, including prep facility) at Midwest farmland prices \nstrikes me as pretty damned cheap.
This sounds a bit high to me.  Still higher accelerations have been endured\n*very briefly*, during violent deceleration.  If we're talking sustained\nacceleration, I think 30-odd gees has been demonstrated using water immersion.\n\nI doubt that any of this generalizes to another order of magnitude.
What would all of you out there in net land think of the big 6 (Martin\nMariatta, Boeing, Mcdonell Douglas, General Dynamics, Lockheed, Rockwell)\ngetting together, and forming a consortium to study exactly what the market\nprice pints are for building reusable launch vehicles, and spending say\n$3million to do that.  Recognizing that most of the military requirements\nfor launch vehicles are pulled out of a hat somewhere (say, has the shuttle \never really used that 1200mi crossrange capability?  You get the idea, figure\nout how many, how often, where to, etc...)\n\nThen taking this data, and forming a sematech type company (bad example, I\nknow... but at least its an example...)  To develop between 3 and 5 craft\ndesigns.  Then to take all of those designs, and figure out EXACTLY what\nthe technologies are, and demonstrate those technologies, in order to \neliminate designs that can't be built today.  And lets say that this\nportion again funded by the GOV cost about $20 million.\n\nAnd from here all of these companies went their separate ways, with the\nintention of taking all of the market data and the design data to wall\nstreet, and saying "I want to build this vehicle, and here are the numbers\nthat show %20 ROI, fund me...)\n\n\nNow many of you think that this is a joke, but I have it on good authority that\njust this project is shaping up in the background. It seems that the aerospace\ncompanies have learned that everyone yelling similar but different things\nends up in many programs that do nothing much and get canceled (NASP, NLS,\nALS, DCY?, etc...)  They need to work more in the japaneese, and european\nspirit of initial cooperation.  They have also learned that design requirements\nthat are phony (I.E. some generals idea of what a space vehicle ought to be)\nends up getting chopped up in congress, because it is not a REAL requirement.\n\nAny feedback?
Archive-name: space/net\nLast-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:15 $\n\nNETWORK RESOURCES\n\nOVERVIEW\n\n    You may be reading this document on any one of an amazing variety of\n    computers, so much of the material below may not apply to you. In\n    general, however, systems connected to 'the net' fall in one of three\n    categories: Internet, Usenet, or BITNET. Electronic mail may be sent\n    between these networks, and other resources available on one of these\n    networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to\n    special 'servers'.\n\n    The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of\n    several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them.\n\n    One mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central\n    distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In\n    addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for\n    Internet users, and SPACE on BITNET), there are a number of more\n    specialized mailing lists described below.\n\n    A second mechanism is Usenet 'netnews'. This is somewhat like a bulletin\n    board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews\n    separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a\n    'group name'. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are\n    called 'sci.space.news', 'sci.space', 'sci.space.shuttle', 'sci.astro',\n    and 'talk.politics.space'. Contributors 'post' submissions (called\n    'articles' in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends\n    it to other nearby machines. Similarly, articles sent from nearby\n    machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so\n    that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet\n    sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was\n    posted.\n\n    Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and\n    BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not\n    accessible as mailing lists. If you can receive netnews, its more\n    flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make\n    it the preferred option.\n\nMAILING LISTS\n\n    SPACE Digest is the main Internet list, and is now being run by the\n    International Space University (in only its second change of management\n    in over a decade).

I've been following discussions about the Delta Clipper program, and I\nhave one small question.  As I understand it, the DC-X derived orbital\nvehicle (DC-Y & 1) is to reenter the atmosphere sort of sideways, not\ncompletely nose-first.  So why is the DC-Y look symmetric in every drawing\nI've seen?  I would think that an asymmetric design, sort of like \nwingless Orbiter, may work better, since less shielding is required on the\ntop side.  Can anybody explain?  \n\n- Ken Kobayashi\nkkobayas@husc.harvard.edu\n\n--
I've seen a film of it, my memory may be faulty, but as I\nremember it the vehicle was slightly over a meter long, with a\nthick baseplate 30-40 cm in diameter. I think the narrative said\nit was propelled by dynamite sticks. There were four detonations\nwithin about 2 s, the second coming after about 2 m of flight in.\nMax altitude seemed to be on the order of 50 m, but that is hard \nto judge.
Exactly when will the hover test be done, and will any of the TV\nnetworks carry it.  I really want to see that...
Let us hope that the performance of the spacecraft follows the\nsentiments of the first verse (miner) rather than the second (lost and gone\nforever).
The current mining regulations and fees were set in the 1800's!\nWhat the so-called "eco-freaks" want to do is to simply bring those\nfees in line with current economic reality.  Currently, mining companies\ncan get access to minerals on public lands for ridiculously low prices --\nsomething like $50!  The mining lobby has for decades managed to block\nany reform of these outdated fees.  In fact, the latest attempt to reform\nthem was again blocked -- President Clinton "compromised" by taking the\nmining fee reforms out of his '94 budget, and plans to draft separate\nlegislation to fight that battle.\nIf you want to discuss this further, I suggest you take this to talk.environment.
I am puzzled by the term "concept." Drag free may already have\nbeen flown. It was the idea behind putting up a spacecraft that would\nmore accurately respond to motions from the Earth's gravity field and\nignore drag. It was proposed many years ago and involved a ball\nfloating between sensors whose job it was to signal to little\nadjustment jets to keep the ball away from them. The ball itself would\nthen be in a drag free condition and respond only to gravity\nanisotropies, whereas the spacecraft itself would be continuously\nadjusting its position to compensate for drag.
In the April edition of "One Small Step for a Space Activist",\nAllen Sherzer & Tim Kyger write:\n  "Another problem is what are called 'wraps' (or sometimes\n   the 'center tax'). When work for a large program like\n   Freedom or Shuttle is performed at a NASA center, the\n   center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts\n   to a slush fund. This money is used to fund work the\n   center manager wants to fund. This sum is estimated to\n   be over a third of the funds allocated. Think about\n   that: Of the $30 billion cost of Freedom, fully $10\n   billion won't be spent on anything having anything\n   to do with Space Stations! Now, maybe that $10 billion\n   was wisely spent (and maybe it wasn't), but the work done\n   with it should stand on its own merits, not distorting\n   the cost of other projects. Congress has no idea of the\n   existense of these wraps; Congress has never heard the\n   term 'center tax'. They look at the Station they are\n   getting and the price they are paying and note that\n   it doesn't add up. They wonder this blissfully unaware\n   that a third of the money is going for something else."\n\nMy dear friends, your mixing fact and fiction here. A couple\nof weeks ago, when I first read this in your posting, I\ntalked with one of the cost experts here in Space Station\nat Headquarters [if you wondering why I didn't post a\nresponse immediately, I do have a real job I'm supposed\nto be doing here at Headquarters, & digging up old 20 kHz\ndata & looking into Sherzer/Kyger claims rates pretty low\non the totem pole of priority. Also, I spent last weekend\nin Kansas City, at the National Science Teachers \nAssociation conference, extolling the virtues of SSF\nto 15,000 science teachers.]\n\nFirst off, yes, the concept of 'center tax', or 'wrap' does\nexist. If I recall the numbers correctly, the total 'tax'\nfor the SSF program for this fiscal year is around $40 Million.\nThis was computed by adding up the WP-1, WP-2, and WP-4\ncenter 'taxes'. With the SSF budget for this fiscal year at\n$2.2 Billion, my calculater says the tax percentage is\n04/2.2 = 1.8%\n\nOver the life of the SSF program, using your figure of $30\nbillion for the cost of SSF, a tax at a 1.8% rate comes to\n$540 million. This is alot less than $10 billion, but I\nwill concede it's still an appreciable amount of pocket\nchange.\n\nI should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1/3 could\nbe close to the actual rate. The tax is only charged on funds\nthat are spent at the center (kind of like McDonalds at some\nstates, where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat\nthe food at the restaurant, but you don't if you get it\ntake-out). For example, at WP-4, the vast bulk of the funds\nwe receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract, and are *NOT*\nsubject to the center tax (I don't have the numbers in\nfront of me, but I'd guess at least 95% of the WP-4 funds\ngo to Rocketdyne). So, you could be right about a tax\nrate of 1/3, but it's only applied to funds spent at the\ncenter, and not to the prime contracts.\n\nThis leads to the obvious question "What is the government\ndoing with SSF funds that don't go to the prime contractors?\n(i.e. ok, WP-4 gets a slice of the $30 billion pie. A\nbig portion of this slice goes to Rocketdyne. What happens\nto the balance of the funds, which aren't eaten\nup by the center tax?)"\n\nAt WP-4, we call these funds we spend in-house supporting\ndevelopment funds (as they are supporting the development\nwork done by Rocketdyne). We have used these funds to\nsetup our own testbed, to checkout the electrical\npower system architecture. Our testbed has a real life\nsolar array field (left over from solar cell research\nresearch a few years back), with lead-acid car batteries\n(to simulate the Nickel-Hydrogen batteries on SSF), DC\nswitchgear, DC-DC converter units, and simulated\nloads. Data from the testbed was used in a recent\nchange evaluation involving concerns about the stability\nof the power system.\n\nWe have also used the supporting development money to\npurchase Nickel Hydrogen batteries, which are on life\ntesting at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility in\nIndiana. As a side point, 6 of the battery cells on\ntest recently hit the four year life test milestone.\n38 cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles (the\non-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year).\n\nAs a final example, my 'home' division at Lewis used\nthe supporting development funds to purchase personal\ncomputers and work stations, for performing system\nanalyses (like modeling of the performance of the\nelectrical power system, availability calculations\nusing a Monte-Carlo simulation, setting up a \ndatabase with information on weight of the power\nsystem elements).\n\nFinally, the money raised by the 'tax' does not all\ngo into a 'slush fund.' At Lewis, the director\ndoes control a small discretionary fund. Each year,\nany individual at Lewis can submit a proposal to\nthe director to get money from this fund to look\nat pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter.\n\nMost of the tax, however, goes to fund the 'general'\nservices at the Center, like the library, the \ncentral computer services division, the Contractor \nwho removes the snow, etc. Thus, it is rather\ndifficult to determine what percentage of the\nSSF budget doesn't go for SSF activities. To get\nan accurate figure, you would have to take\nthe annual expenditure for the library (for example),\nand then divide by the amount of the library funds\nused to support SSF (which would be hard to\ncompute by itself - how would you figure out\nwhat percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for\n1 year is 'billable' to SSF, would you base it on\nthe person-hours SSF employees spend reading AV-week\nversus the rest of the center personnel). You would\nthen have to compare this estimate of the SSF\nportion of the library expense with the portion of\nthe tax that goes to support the library. Who knows,\nmaybe SSF overpays on the tax to run the library, but\nwe underpay for snow removal? Talk about\na burecratic nightmare!

In my first posting on this subject I threw out an idea of how to fund\nsuch a contest without delving to deep into the budget.  I mentioned\ngranting mineral rights to the winner (my actual wording was, "mining\nrights.)  Somebody pointed out, quite correctly, that such rights are\nnot anybody's to grant (although I imagine it would be a fait accompli\nsituation for the winner.)  So how about this?  Give the winning group\n(I can't see one company or corp doing it) a 10, 20, or 50 year\nmoratorium on taxes.
Allen, sometimes I think you're OK.  And sometimes you tend to rashly leap into\nmaking statement without thinking them out. \n\nWanna guess which today?\n\nYou'd need to launch HLVs to send up large amounts of stuff.  Do you know \nof a private Titan pad?
Actually, Hiten wasn't originally intended to go into lunar orbit at all,\nso it indeed didn't have much fuel on hand.  The lunar-orbit mission was\nan afterthought, after Hagoromo (a tiny subsatellite deployed by Hiten\nduring a lunar flyby) had a transmitter failure and its proper insertion\ninto lunar orbit couldn't be positively confirmed.\n\nIt should be noted that the technique does have disadvantages.  It takes\na long time, and you end up with a relatively inconvenient lunar orbit.\nIf you want something useful like a low circular polar orbit, you do have\nto plan to expend a certain amount of fuel, although it is reduced from\nwhat you'd need for the brute-force approach.
There is the Army Ballistic Missile Defense Organization.\n\nThey were the precursors to SDIO.  and still exist under\nthat umbrella.  Army Signal Corp's  and DCA  defense Comm Agency\noops  DISA, they just changed names  do space work.  that's\nthe point of all those defense comm sats.
It wasn't especially prominent, as I recall.  However, quite possibly it's\nno longer on display; NASM, like most museums, has much more stuff than it\ncan display at once, and does rotate the displays occasionally.

One consideration to remember is that if you don't turn it off now,\nyou may not be able to later.  This isn't a case of reaching over and\nflipping a switch; much of the spacecraft has to be working correctly\nto execute a "turn off" command successfully.  Spacecraft do malfunction\nin their old age.  The big concern is not radio clutter from idle\nspacecraft, but radio clutter from malfunctioning spacecraft that can\nno longer be turned off.
The company was probably "Public Missiles, Inc" of Michigan.\n\n\nYup.\n\n\nNope, it's not illegal. It is, however, closely regulated.

Depending on the\nlocation, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL. \n- The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft\nwithin the operating radius around the launch site.\n- Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited.\n- The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace that\nunmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.\n\nMost of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year)\nare held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over the\nwestern deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popular\nsince it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).\n\nThe two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members'\nuse, to insure safety. Depending on motor size, the launcher setback is\nfrom 50 to 500 or more feet. \n\nBy the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an "F" motor are exempt from\nmost Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101, Subpart\nC, for details.\n\nAs for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to\n50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typical\nrocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute,\nor multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. Many rockets also carry\neither a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launches\nin the eastern US, where there are more obstructions.\n\nCamera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common.\n\n\nWhy not? It's a lot of fun...check out the traffic on rec.models.rockets\nfor information about the model (3 lb and under) and high power (everything\nbigger) rocket hobbies. As with all dangerous activities, the key is to\npractice safety. I've been flying consumer rockets ranging up to 4-5 lbs\ntakeoff weight for 27 years, and still have all my extremities intact.\n\n\nThat's another thing. NO EXPLOSIVE WARHEADS OF ANY KIND ARE ALLOWED ON THESE\nROCKETS. NONE! Please forgive me for shouting, but that's one of the biggest\nmisconceptions people have about our hobby. \n\nTrue. But it will not be related to the rocket hobby, unless I get \nhit while crossing a road with a rocket in my hand.
Why use a ground launch pad. It is entirely posible to launch from altitude.\nThis was what the Shuttle was originally intended to do! It might be seriously\ncheaper. \n\nAlso, what about bio-engineered CO2 absorbing plants instead of many LOX bottles?\nStick 'em in a lunar cave and put an airlock on the door.
A brief political/cultural item.\n\nRadio station WGMS in Washington is a classical music station with\na large audience among high officials (elected and otherwise).  \nImagine a radio station that advertises Mercedes Benzes, diamond\njewelry, expensive resorts and (truthfully) Trident submarines.\n\nThis morning I heard a commercial for the space station project.\nDidn't catch the advertiser.\n\nGuess they're pulling out all the stops.

The commercial uses of a transportation system between already-settled-\nand-civilized areas are obvious.  Spaceflight is NOT in this position.\nThe correct analogy is not with aviation of the '30's, but the long\ntransocean voyages of the Age of Discovery.  It didn't require gov't to\nfund these as long as something was known about the potential for profit\nat the destination.  In practice, some were gov't funded, some were private.\nBut there was no way that any wise investor would spend a large amount\nof money on a very risky investment with no idea of the possible payoff.\n  I am sure that a thriving spaceflight industry will eventually develop,\nand large numbers of people will live and work off-Earth.  But if you ask\nme for specific justifications other than the increased resource base, I\ncan't give them.  We just don't know enough.  The launch rate demanded by\nexisting space industries is just too low to bring costs down much, and\nwe are very much in the dark about what the revolutionary new space industries\nwill be, when they will practical, how much will have to be invested to\nstart them, etc.
The Command Loss Timer is a timer that does just what its name says;\nit indicates to the probe that it has lost its data link for receiving\ncommands.  Upon expiration of the Command Loss Timer, I believe the\nprobe starts a 'search for Earth' sequence (involving antenna pointing\nand attitude changes which consume fuel) to try to reestablish\ncommunications.  No-ops are sent periodically through those periods\nwhen there are no real commands to be sent, just so the probe knows\nthat we haven't forgotten about it.\n\nHope that's clear enough to be comprehensible. \n\n-- \n"Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live\n in the real world."   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden

Now, I had put a Wink at the end of my suggestion indicating it was\nintensely sarcastic.  I can't help it if everyone got all serious.\n\nRoss.\n\n	I never saw your original posting.  it dropped on the floor\nsomewhere.  I just saw the trickle down, thought it was intensely\nstupid,  not knowing anything about the joke, mentioned arbitron\nand left it with an equally stupid joke.  Bill in his ever increasing\ndevotion to thoroughness dug up  several  arbitron stats.\n\nI myself think the arbitron stats are  severely methodologically impaired,\nbut are a good measure of proportion.  I don't think anyone\nknows how many people read news anymore.
It may be that they just didn't mention it, or that they actually haven't \nthought about it.  I got the vague impression from their mission proposal\nthat they weren't taking a very holistic aproach to the whole thing.  They\nseemed to want to land people on the Moon by the end of the decade without \nexplaining why, or what they would do once they got there.  The only application\nI remember from the Av Week article was placing a telescope on the Moon.  That's\ngreat, but they don't explain why it can't be done robotically. \n\n\n\nBut I'm a _member_.  Besides Bill, I hang out with you :)
If all of these things have been detected in space, has anyone\nlooked into possible problems with the detectors?\n\nThat is, is there some mechanism (cosmic rays, whatever) that\ncould cause the dector to _think_ it was seeing one of these\nthings?
The problem is, you can't raise adequate amounts of money that way.\nThe Viking Fund tried.  They did succeed, in a way, but only because\nof the political impact of their fundraising.  The actual amount of\nmoney they raised was fairly inconsequential; it would not have kept\nthe Viking lander going by itself.
[Stuff deleted] \n\n\nI'm glad to see that someone is working on this.  However, it would be nice if\nhe got his units right.
I should probably re-post this with another title, so that\nthe guys on the other thread would see that this is a practical\nuse of "temporary orbits..."\n\nAnother possible temporary orbit:
Okay, lets get the record straight on the Livermore gas gun.  \nThe project manager is Dr. John Hunter, and he works for the\nLaser group at Livermore.  What, you may ask, does gas guns\nhave to do with lasers? Nothing, really, but the gun is physically\nlocated across the road from the Free Electron Laser building,\nand the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls)\nfrom which the gun firings are controlled.  So I suspect that the\noffice he works for is an administrative convenience.\n\nI visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun.\nAt the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing, where I work,\nbut I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),\n\nThe gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamber\nabout 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe).\nThe chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several\nhundred m/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the piston\nis hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tens\nof atmospheres.\n\nThe piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until\na stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi.\nThe barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch\nbore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they\nintersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrel\ncould be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to\nmove the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being used\nin testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter\nand about 50 cm long.\n\nAll of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen\ngas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the\nbarrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with a\nsheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  The\nplastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped\nin the barrel ahead of the projectile.  \n\nThe gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic\nwater jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plastic\nprojectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing,\nthe projectile vaporizes.\n\nThe testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is\nabout 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 km\nif fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gun\nto Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they can\nfire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFB\nto follow the projectiles.\n\nThe design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4\nkm/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s,\nand the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last test\nthey blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think it\nhad to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, but\nI haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).\n\nThere are people waiting to test scramjet components in this\ngun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12=\n4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.\n\nThis gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basically\na proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful-\nsized payloads into space.  This would require on the order of\n100 kg projectiles, which deliver on the order of 20 kg\nuseful payload to orbit.\n\nDani Eder
I've just read Richard Langley's latest "Navstar GPS Constellation Status".\n\nIt states that the latest satellite was placed in Orbit Plane Position C-3.\nThere is already one satellite in that position. I know that it's almost\nten years since that satellite was launched but it's still in operation so\nwhy not use it until it goes off?\n\nWhy not instead place the new satellite at B-4 since that position is empty\nand by this measure have an almost complete GPS-constellation\n(23 out of 24)?\n\n/Thomas\n================================================================================\nEricsson Telecom, Stockholm, Sweden
Reported yesterday in the Washington Post (Kathy Sawyer, writer):\n\nThe article plays down the Russian role in US space.\n\nGibbons (science advisor to Clinton) sent Goldin a letter indicating\nNASA should not limit redesign options to those compatible with Mir\norbit.\n\nThe White House thinks expectations for Russian cooperation have been\nraised too high.\n\nThe article reports that some think the spending and schedule limits\nfor space station are so stringent that the redesign is nearly\nimpossible.  That's why some think Goldin has begun looking at \nRussian hardware.\n\nGoldin states NASA will present all options to the administration \nwhich will then have decision making power.\n\nGoldin and the White House have totally ruled out using Energia to\nboost the station.

I had spacefood sticks just about every morning for breakfast in\nfirst and second grade (69-70, 70-71).  They came in Chocolate,\nstrawberry, and peanut butter and were cylinders about 10cm long\nand 1cm in diameter wrapped in yellow space foil (well, it seemed\nlike space foil at the time).  \n\nThe taste is hard to describe, although I remember it fondly.  It was\nmost certainly more "candy" than say a modern "Power Bar."  Sort of\na toffee injected with vitamins.  The chocolate Power Bar is a rough\napproximation of the taste.  Strawberry sucked.\n\nMan, these were my "60's."

Re: Space billboards\n\nEven easier to implement than writing messages on the Moon, once upon\na time a group of space activists I belonged to in Seattle considered\na "Goodyear Blimp in orbit".  The idea was to use a large structure\nthat could carry an array of lights like the Goodyear Blimp has.\nPlaced in a low Earth orbit of high inclination, it could eventually\nbe seen by almost everyone on Earth.  Only our collective disapproval\nof cluttering up space with such a thing stopped us from pursuing\nit.  It had quite feasible economics, which I will not post here\nbecause I don't want to encourage the idea (if you want to do such\na thing, go figure it out for yourself).\n\nDani Eder
I don't care who told you this it is not generally true. I see EVERY single\nline item on a contract and I have to sign it. There is no such thing as\nwrap at this university. I also asked around here. Ther is no wrap at \nMarquette, University of Wisconsin Madison, Utah State, Weber State or\nEmbry Riddle U. I am not saying that it doees not happen but in every instance\nthat I have been able to track down it does not. Also the president of our\nUniversity who was Provost at University of West Virgina said that it did\nnot happen there either and that this figure must be included in the overhead\nto be a legitimate charge.\n\n\nI did they never heard of it but suggest that, like our president did, that\nany percentage number like this is included in the overhead.\n\n\nNo Allen you did not. You merely repeated allegations made by an Employee\nof the Overhead capital of NASA. Nothing that Reston does could not be dont\nbetter or cheaper at the Other NASA centers  where the work is going on.\nKinda funny isn't it that someone who talks about a problem like this is\nat a place where everything is overhead.\n\n\nWhy did the Space News artice point out that it was the congressionally\ndemanded change that caused the problems? Methinks that you are being \nselective with the facts again.\n\n\nIf it takes four flights a year to resupply the station and you have a cost\nof 500 million a flight then you pay 2 billion a year. You stated that your\n"friend" at Reston said that with the current station they could resupply it\nfor a billion a year "if the wrap were gone". This merely points out a \nblatent contridiction in your numbers that understandably you fail to see.\n\nDennis, University of Alabama in Huntsville.
I'm not very impressed by the old so-called "prospecting" work from\nLPI, it has almost all been geared towards industrially silly processes on\nthe moon as an excuse to put astronauts there.   [...]\n\nTranslation:  It doesn't support the Nick Szabo Vision of the Future\nto Which You MUST Subscribe...\n\nFred, we're all supporting what each of us thinks should be done, to some\ndegree.  If you have a problem with what Nick thinks should be done,\naddress it, instead of just complaining about his doing so.\n\nYou really don't get what the 'complaints' are about, do you?\n  [not incredibly clear explanation of complaints...something between\n   feelings regarding Nick's method, and judgments about his meaning]\n\nT\n\nF\n\n*** Fred's issue #1;  Nick's alleged trashing of others ***\n\nI only got it when you stopped trashing, and made your point patently,\ninstead of 'allegorically'.  That was my point all along, Fred.\n\n\n\n\n\nI see we are dealing with a problem in a conflict of interpretations, not\nleast of which is your belief that only you can adequately judge what is\nand is not debate.  Suffice to say that I disagree with you on that last\npoint.  Why don't you take a poll, Fred, if you want some psuedo-objective\npoint-of-view?\n\nAnd, as usual, you defend your insults with "he started it."  "Yeah, I\ntook some of his research and called it my own, but he started it."  "So\nwhat if I stole his car, he stole my lawnmower first."  Besides that, I\nthink it's still open to interpretation whether Nick actually did start it.\nSo your defense, besides being lame, and contradicting the first part of\nthe sentence in which it occurs, may not even apply anyway.\n\nYour defense reminds me of the guy that broke the borrowed tool:  "I\nnever borrowed it, I already gave it back, and it was broken when you\ngave it to me."  Make up yer mind, Fred!\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, I try to address what I think you meant, for which I am rewarded\nwith a denial of sorts, and a smart remark.  Then, I point out that I am\nnot clear what you did mean, rather than risking your childish ire, wrongly\ninterpreting you a second time, and I'm stupid for it.  I just can't win,\ncan I, Fred?  You've got a great point here somewhere, it's just that\nbetween stupid people that you must insult, and your jealous guarding of\nyour valuable opinions, you never actually get around to making it.\n\n\n*** Fred issue #2;  Nick's alleged meaning ***\n\nToo bad the plan only exists in your mind, instead of Nick's, or you\nwould have a really good point.  Instead you have provided a good reason\nto ignore your insults, since they are based on incorrect interpretations\nthat you have made about others.  Forgive me for giving your insults more\nmeaning than they ever should have had.\n\nMy reading of what Nick actually said is that "people aren't required in\nall parts of all space processes", so your taking issue with his opinions\nregarding people in the space program, I read as "People are required in\nall parts of all space processes."  So, help me out, here, Fred, since I'm\nso patently stupid.  Did you read Nick wrong?  Or are you going to eat\nyour terminal now?  If the latter, I sure hope it's one of those Cheeto and\nstring models that all the computer mags have been raving about :-)\n\nThe point is, _I_ am not stupid because of _your_ incorrect assumption.  I'd\nonly be stupid if I insulted you for having made it.  But, alas, that's your\njob, Fred.\n\nAnd, finally, your style is confusing, since you tried to make two points,\nsimultaneously, with an allegory/insult.  Sadly, one point addressed a 'plan'\nthat only existed in your mind, and the other took issue with behaviors that\nyou do as much as anyone.\n\n\nNo, no, I finally got it.  You don't like the plan that Nick's posts made\nyou imagine.  And you don't like Nick's obnoxious behavior, even though\nit's no worse than your own.  Thanks for taking the time with someone as\ndense as myself.\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, Socrates.  How could it be otherwise?\n\n\nWho cares who came on the net first?  If you do, consider that you saw\nme come on after a brief haitus, before which I was on for about 2 years.\nIf you had seen me on the net first, you'd remember when Nick and I went\ndown exactly the same road regarding rude, unneccesary behavior.  It's\njust amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior that's\nno worse than your own.\n\nLet's see here, my complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical,\nwhile your flames against people you decide are flamers isn't, and my\ncomplaints about your name-calling are immature, while your name-calling\nisn't.  Yeah, right.  Maybe if you called me some more names, I might\nsee it better, Fred.\n\n"Net.ghod wannabe"?  Naturally, Fred, you've correctly interpreted my\nmotivations, when yours are impossible to judge from your actions (as\nyour insulting of people that try, proves).  I didn't really care about\npeople that fill the net with personal garbage, what I really wanted was to\nimpress everyone.  I only put my complaints with your behavior on private\nmail, not because it belongs there, but because I thought you were such a\njerk that you'd bring it back to the Net, playing right into my hands.\nAlas, I had no idea what an intellectual master you were, turning tables and\nbringing the history of these posts to the net, for the noble and valuable\npurpose of embarassing me.  Whether I should feel stupid because I tried\nto make suggestions to such a superior intellect, or becuase I tried to\ncommunicate like an adult with a self-righteous ass, still isn't clear.\n\nWell, Fred, you exposed me.  Now I'll never be able to get a(nother) job\nwith NASA, since they all know that I'm stupider than Fred McCall.  Well,\nI just hope you're happy.  Please leave me alone, now.  I just don't\nhave the heart to attempt keeping up with one so far above me.  Maybe Nick\nor Pat can approach your high standards, but I'm dropping it now.\n\n-Tommy Mac\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTom McWilliams 517-355-2178 wk   \\ As the radius of vision increases,\n18084tm@ibm.cl.msu.edu 336-9591 hm \\ the circumference of mystery grows.

Other idea for old space crafts is as navigation beacons and such..\n   Why not??\n\nBecause to be any use as a nav point you need to know -exactly- where\nit is, which means you either nail it to something that doesn't move\nor you watch it all the time.  Neither of which is possible on a\ndeactivated spacecraft.  Then you have to know exactly how far away\nfrom it you are; this may or may not be possible with the hardware on\nboard. \n\nApart from which, there is absolutely no need for navigation beacons.

Sounds\nlike a good idea to me, since the taxpayers would bear _all_ of the\nexpense if they didn't do the advertising.\n\n\nGreat idea, they should have done it long ago.\n\n\nI can't believe that a mile-long billboard would have any significant\neffect on the overall sky brightness.  Venus is visible during the day,\nbut nobody complains about that.  Besides, it's in LEO, so it would only\nbe visible during twilight when the sky is already bright, and even if\nit would have some miniscule impact, it would be only for a short time\nas it goes zipping across the sky.\n\n\nNo doubt.  People are always looking for something to protest about, so\nit would be no surprise.\n\n\nWell, look on the, er, bright side.  Imagine the looks on the faces of\npeople in primitive tribes out in the middle of nowhere as they look up\nand see a can of Budweiser flying across the sky... :-D\n\n--
Hey!? What happened to the solar sail race that was supposed to be\nfor Columbus+500?
