[Would I kid you?]\n\n\nDoes one man's words encompass the majestic vision of thousands\nof individuals?  Quoting a man is not the same as quoting the\nOrder.  Taken out of context, words can be interpreted much\ndifferently than had one applied them within the confines of\ntheir original expression.\n\nI think this is the case regarding Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior \nof the Order to which I belong.  When he included that bit\nfrom Merlinus X' he did us all a service.  He showed us the extremes\nto which Order members have been known to go in their fervor.\nI have little knowledge regarding Reuss' background, but surely\nhe was an unusual man, and he was an important force in the Order \nfor many years.\n\nYet as people change so do Orders change, and while we look back\nso carefully at the dirty laundry of O.T.O. remember that this is\nonly the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassed\nwhich extend beyond any one individual.  I hope to show that there\nwas and is much room for a difference of opinion within the Order\nitself, perhaps by testing the limits myself.\n\n\nLet us examine this issue a bit more closely....\n\n"In 1895, Karl Kellner (1850-1905), a wealthy Austrian industrialist\nand paper chemist, as well as a high-grade Mason, founded the Ordo\nTempli Orientis.  Kellner had traveled widely in the East, where he\nmet three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices.  \nKellner's efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by Franz\nHartmann, Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss, who had worked together\nprior to joining the O.T.O.  The Order was first proclaimed in 1902\nin Reuss's Masonic publication, 'Oriflamme'.  On Kellner's death,\nReuss succeeded him as Outer Head [O.H.O.].  The 'Jubilee' edition of\nthe 'Oriflamme', published in 1912, announced that the Order taught\nsecret of sexual magic.\n \n"Theodore Reuss was an interesting character.  Born June 28, 1855 in\nAugsburg, he entered Masonry in 1876.  He was a singer, journalist and\npossibly a spy for the Prussian political police, infiltrating the Socialist\nLeague founded by Karl Marx's daughter and her husband.  Reuss was\nlater associated with William Wynn Westcott, a leader of the Golden\nDawn, who later introduced him to John Yarker.  Yarker chartered Reuss to\nfound the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany.  After several\nattempts to concretize various Masonic Rites, Reuss settled on the\ndevelopment of the O.T.O.\n\n"The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss' leadership.\nFor example, he chartered Papus in France, Rudolph Steiner in Berlin\nand H. Spencer Lewis in the USA.  In 1912, the historic meeting between\nReuss and Crowley occurred.  Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him and\naccused him of revealing Order secrets.  When Crowley looked at it afresh,\nthe initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for\nthe first time.  Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all\nthe English speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invoked\nwhen publishing the material of the Equinox.\n\n"Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering a\nstroke and named Crowley his successor.  All was well until 1925 when\n_The Book of the Law_ was translated into German.  There was a break\nin the continuity of the Order.  Manyk members split with the new O.H.O.\nover the book, which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order.\nHe had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss's request, deeply\ninfusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation."\n\n_An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O._, by Ad Veritatem IX'\n\nWithin _Equinox III:10_, Edited by \n  Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior, Rex Summus Sanctissimus,\n    Caliph of the United States of America,\n      Published by Samuel Weiser, 1990.\n\n\n\nThere are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this\nmaterial in _Equinox III:10_.  And this is the real point, is it not?\nWhy did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own\norganization?  Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle\nof Thelema?  Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very\ncomplex pictures with no easy answers?  A picture which leaves room\nfor very many interpretations.\n\nIt is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of O.T.O. derived\nout of the dribble of faltering Masonry, purchased by clever hucksters\nwith an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them.  And I\ncan take that all the way down to our present Caliph, whose feeble\nsupport of the 'Law of Thelema' is laughable at best.\n\nWould I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way?  \nWill I?  \nI think not.\nWhy?  Because my Frater will see it as a perspective, an interjection\nI am using as an example.  My illustration shows that we may express things\nin the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be\nquite difficult to apprehend at first.\n\nSo it may be with OTO and Merlinus X'.  Please look O.T.O. more carefully.\nI do not support Reuss's words myself, as I am not qualified to assess\nthem, and I am critical of their pomposity.  If I who am a member of\nthe Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, then\nwhat can this say about the health of the Order?  Does it mean that\nthe Order has 'gone soft' and abandoned its moral principles?  Or\ndoes it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of\nuniversal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmatic\nrequirement?  How shall we resolve these two possibilities?\n\n\nI find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis.\nThey are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane\nor usual information.  They are quite often artists and geniuses.  \nHaving met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area (many who are or\nwere very heavily involved with the Order), I can vouch for the integrity\nof the organization as it stands.\n\nI have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta.  In these moments \nI followed my intuition, and I've found little to stop me from requesting\na Second initiation from a different O.T.O. body.  I'm happily participating\nin social groups (Feasts or Initiations) and have come to know the Gnostic\nMass well enough for my tastes.\n \n\nThis doesn't make me an authority on Order politics and explanations, however.\nI can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on my\nlimited contact with other members.\n\nI urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far.  There are many\nways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved with\nthe Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom\nand the preservation of individual vision.\n\nI welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response\nto other posts in this thread.\n\n\nInvoke me under my stars.  Love is the law, love under will.\n\nI am I!

I produced an error last week about CHORION:\n\n\nI abhor publishing trash (I abhor it of myself even more than I do from\nothers, but since I do not present myself as an authority on the subject, I do\nnot feel dishonest, though I do openly admit ignorance and incompetence in\nthis example).  Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of research\nspecifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is not\nas tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and I still am\nnot competent with it, but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turns\nout that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich "Greek Lexicon" renders\neach verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical\norder.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax is\nfar from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makes\nthings a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 is\nindeed "chorion." \n\nNow I've checked several Greek-English lexicons:\n\n	"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament," Louw and Nida\n	"Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament"\n	"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament," Grimm\n	"Word study Concordance," Tynsdale\n	"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other \n	 early Christian Writings," Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\n	"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon," Perschbacher\n\nIn each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:\n\n	A space, place, region, district, field, area, "country place," \n	land, farm, estate, "a bit of tillage", and similar meanings.\n\nNowhere do any of these books mention anything about "grave." As some of these \nbooks go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books \nare all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I \nthink it more likely that Mr Archer's investigations into "contradictions" to \nbe once again, as your friend said it, "lacking in substance," and thus Archer \nis again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would \nhave honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found them\nto support Mr Archer's contentions). \n\nBy the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson's) is the definition of\n"agros," the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word\n"agros" is defined as "a field in the country." Chorion is specifically noted\nas a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how silly\nBullinger's exegisis was, which stated that the word for "field" in Matthew\n(ie: agros) is different from the word for "field" in Acts (ie: chorion), and\nthus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you already\nadmit how stupid Bullinger's exegisis is, but this was a small serendipity\nwhich drives the point home). \n\nSo as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise\n(eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this \nparticular issue closed.  See Mr DeCenso, now you can go on to answer\nquestions about the denials of Peter, the day of the Crucifixion, Tyre, and \nthe fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in\ndiscussing the "Potter's Field."\n \n				Later,\n\n				Dave Butler
This deserves framing.  It really does.  "[Atoms] aren't even real."\n\nTell me then, those atoms we have seen with electron microscopes are\natoms now, so what are they?  Figments of our imaginations?  The\nevidence that atoms are real is overwhelming, but I won't bother with\nmost evidence at the moment.
Absolutely. Lewis didn't care for the 1921 O.T.O. charter from Reuss. He had\nin mind something completely diferent. Crowley and Lewis were very\ndifferent persons, as you probably know.\n\n\nNo. My overstatement, sorry :-)
: medtronic.COM (Dale M. Skiba) entirely missed my point in my previous\n\n: COMMENT:\n\n: Shortly after that post, I realized two things:  I was running a fever of\n: over 102, and that I probably should not have gone directly from reading\n: alt.slack to posting on this august newsgroup.\n\n: >: >it is not ad hominen to point out that Mr Archer willingly prints blatant\n: >: lies\n: >: >in defense of Bible inerrancy, and thus is worthless as an expert witness.\n\n: >: Okay, Im game, give us a listing of blatant lies from _Encyclopedia of\n: >: Biblical Difficulties_ or other Archer writings.\n\n: >That would be interesting.

OK, lets _see_ the list...\n\nThis was an open question.  I assumed that if Mr. Archer is a chronic\nliar, someone whould have documented it.   This assumption is based on\nhow talk.origins regulars have documented numerous cases of Creationist\ndeceptions (such as Duane Guish and his friends).\n\nNo long list of Archer mistakes has yet been given, so this may be just\nan isolated incident...

I responded to Jim's other articles today, but I see that I neglected\nto respond to this one.  I wouldn't want him to think me a hypocrite\nfor not responding to *every* stupid article on t.r.m.\n\n[dictionary definitions of "not" "disagree" and "agree" deleted]\n\nOh, but I'm weary of trying to wade through Jim's repertoire of \nred herrings and smoke screens.\n\nLet's see what we get when we run all four articles posted by Jim today\nthrough the 'discord' filter (a Markov chain program that Steve Lamont\nwas kind enough to send me):\n\n	Taking action? A white geese be held\n	as an accomplice to be held as\n	a decision upon the door\n	A black and white goose waddles past\n	the eyes of the door. \n	Hits it with the confidence interval for \n	that individual is held responsible \n	for that, that individual \n	may be held as a \n	getaway car may be held \n	as an uncountably large number \n	of the driver of something \n	and agree.\n\n	A black goose \n	waddles past the person imprisoned?\n\n	White goose waddles past the \n	confidence interval for the population \n	of geese be axed, \n	fine.\n	And white goose \n	waddles past the door.\n\nDoes running Jim's articles through 'discord' make them more\ncoherent?  Less coherent?\n\nOr has 'discord' turned Jim's articles into an angst-ridden poem\nabout making choices in a world filled with uncertainty, yet being\nheld responsible for the choices we make?  Do the geese symbolize\nan inner frustration with ambiguity, a desire that everything be\nblack and white, with no shades of gray?  Does the "getaway car"\ntell us that to try to renounce the existential nature of our\nbeing is not to "get away" from responsibility for our actions,\nbut rather to take the role of the passive accomplice, the\n"driver" of the getaway car, as it were?  Does the juxtaposition\nof man and machine, car and driver, reveal a subtext: an internal\nconflict between determinism and moral responsibility?\n\nOr am I reading too much into a collaboration between Jim and\na random number generator?

You refer to\n     differing interpretations of "create," and say that many Christians may\n     not agree. So what? That is really irrelevant. We do not base our faith\n     on how many people think one way or another, do we? The bottom line is\n     truth, regardless of popularity of opinions.\n\n     Also, I find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created\n     and eternally existent are equivalent, you say "granted the Mormon\n     belief..." You can't grant your conclusion and then expect the point to\n     have been addressed. In order to reply to the issue, you have to address\n     and answer the point that was raised, and not just jump to the\n     conclusion that you grant.\n\n     The Bible states that Lucifer was created.  The Bible states that Jesus\n     is the creator of all. The contradiction that we have is that the LDS\n     belief is that Jesus and Lucifer were the same.\n\nra> >     Your point that we all are brothers of Jesus and Lucifer is also\nra> >     heretical, since we are not innately brothers and sisters of Christ.\nra> >     We are adopted, "For ye have not received the spirit of bondage\nra> >     again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby\nra> >     we cry, Abba, Father."

Mormons believe that we are "adopted" into the House of\nra> Israel through baptism and faith in Christ, although some have expressed\nra> belief that this does evince a physical change in our bodies.\n\n     The Mormon belief is that all are children of God. Literally. There is\n     nothing symbolic about it. This however, contradicts what the Bible\n     says. The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God:\n\n          The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the \n          kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked [one];\n          (Matthew 13:38)\n\n          I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which \n          ye have seen with your father. (John 8:38)\n\n          Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not \n          born of fornication; we have one Father, [even] God.  Jesus said \n          unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I \n          proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he \n          sent me.  Why do ye not understand my speech? [even] because ye \n          cannot hear my word.  Ye are of [your] father the devil, and the \n          lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the \n          beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in \n          him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a \n          liar, and the father of it. (John 8:41-44)\n\n          And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, [thou] child of \n          the devil, [thou] enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease \n          to pervert the right ways of the Lord? (Acts 13:10)\n\n          Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this \n          world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit \n          that now worketh in the children of disobedience: (Ephesians 2:2)\n\n          In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the \n          devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he \n          that loveth not his brother. (1 John 3:10)\n\n     One becomes a child of God...\n\n          But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the\n          sons of God, [even] to them that believe on his name: (John 1:12)\n\n          Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that\n          we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us\n          not, because it knew him not.  Beloved, now are we the sons of God,\n          and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when\n          he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he\n          is. (1 John 3:1-2)\n\n     ...when he is born again through faith in Jesus Christ:\n\n          Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of\n          the will of man, but of God. (John 1:13)\n\n          Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus\n          Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,\n          (Ephesians 1:5)\n\n          Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should\n          be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. (James 1:18)\n\n          For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of\n          God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear;\n          but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba,\n          Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we\n          are the children of God: (Romans 8:14-16)\n\n          Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one\n          that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. (1 John 4:7)\n\n          Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and\n          every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is\n          begotten of him.

I don't mean to be snotty about this,\nra> but the fact is that the Bible is so differently interpreted by different\nra> groups of Biblical scholars (what do you think of the Jehovah's\nra> Witnesses, for example?) that to make reference to the "Jesus of the\nra> Bible" is simply ridiculous.  Whose "Jesus of the Bible" do you mean?\n\n     This is really a red herring. It doesn't address any issue raised, but \n     rather, it seeks to obfuscate. The fact that some groups try to read \n     something into the Bible, doesn't change what the Bible teaches. For \n     example, the fact that the Jehovah's Witnesses deny the Deity of Christ \n     does not alter what the Bible teaches [ "Looking for that blessed hope,\n     and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus\n     Christ;" (Titus 2:13),"Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus\n     Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through\n     the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:" (2 Peter 1:1)] \n     on the Deity of Christ.\n\n     We first look to the Bible to see what it teaches. To discount, or not \n     even address, what the Bible teaches because there are some groups that \n     have differing views is self-defeating. To see what the Bible teaches, \n     you have to look at the Bible.\n\nra> >     "Our Lord's mortality was essential to his own salvation" (_The\nra> >     Promised Messiah_, p. 456), "He had to work out his own salvation by\nra> >     doing the will of the Father in all things" (ibid., p.54), "he had\nra> >     to be baptized to gain admission to the celestial kingdom" (_Mormon\nra> >     Doctrine_, p.71).\nra>\nra>    Welcome to the wonderful world of Mormon paradoctrine, Robert.

When I mentioned that the Mormon belief is\n     that Jesus needed to be saved, I put forward some quotes from the late\n     apostle, Bruce McConkie. The curious part is that no one addressed the\n     issue of `Jesus needing to be saved.' Rick comes the closest with his "I\n     have my own conclusions" to addressing the point.\n\n     Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of\n     Bruce McConkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine.' I don't\n     think that it matters if McConkie's views were canon. That is not the\n     issue.  Were McConkie's writings indicative of Mormon belief on this\n     subject is the real issue. The indication from Rick is that they may \n     certainly be.
I think the passage you're looking for is the following.\n\nMatthew 5:17    "Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the \nprophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them. \nMatthew 5:18   For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, \nnot an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law until all is accomplished. \nMatthew 5:19   Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments \nand teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he \nwho does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of \nheaven. \nMatthew 5:20   For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of \nthe scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. \n\nThere are several problems with this.  The most serious is that the\nLaw was regarded by Jews at the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but\nnot on Gentiles.  There are rules that were binding on all human\nbeings (the so-called Noachic laws), but they are quite minimal.  The\nissue that the Church had to face after Jesus' death was what to do\nabout Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ.  The decision not to\nimpose the Law on them didn't say that the Law was abolished.  It\nsimply acknowledged that fact that it didn't apply to Gentiles.  This\nis a simple answer, which I think just about everyone can agree to.\n(A discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recorded\nin Acts 15.)\n\nHowever there's more involved.  In order to get a full picture of the\nrole of the Law, we have to come to grips with Paul's apparent\nrejection of the Law, and how that relates to Jesus' commendation of\nthe Law.  At least as I read Paul, he says that the Law serves a\npurpose that has been in a certain sense superceded.  Again, this\nissue isn't one of the abolition of the Law.  In the middle of his\ndiscussion, Paul notes that he might be understood this way, and\nassures us that that's not what he intends to say.  Rather, he sees\nthe Law as primarily being present to convict people of their\nsinfulness.  But ultimately it's an impossible standard, and one that\nhas been superceded by Christ.  Paul's comments are not the world's\nclearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading.  But the\ninteresting thing to notice is that even this radical position does\nnot entail an abolition of the Law.  It still remains as an\nuncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed.\nFor its purpose of convicting of sin, it's important that it not be\nrelaxed.  However for Christians, it's not the end -- ultimately we\nlive in faith, not Law.\n\nWhile the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the\nend I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The\nquoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest\nof the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the\nLaw.  The "not an iota or dot" would suggest a rather literal reading,\nbut in fact that's not Jesus' approach.  Jesus' interpretations\nemphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial\ndetails.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude\ntowards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat\n5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish\ndiscussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a\ntenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that\nreally matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and\nplates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who\nuse them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and\nthe discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific\nview of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the\nLaw in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it.\nPaul's conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being\nsuperceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the\n"ceremonial law", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite\nconcerned about maintaining moral standards.\n\nThe net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being\nsuperceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe\nthey are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is\nembroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters\nresponding to specific situations, he's looking at the aspect of the\nLaw that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish\nceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards\nof conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems\nto be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and\nhuman relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later\nto give Paul so much trouble.
I understand and sympathize with your pain.  What happened in Waco was a very\nsad tradgedy.  Don't take it out on us Christians though.  The Branch\nDavidians were not an organized religion.  They were a cult led by a ego-maniac\ncult leader.  The Christian faith stands only on the shoulders of one man,\nthe Lord of Lords and King of Kings, Jesus Christ.   BTW, David Koresh was NOT\nJesus Christ as he claimed.\n\nGod be with you,\n\nMalcolm Lee  :)
No matter how "absurd" it is to suggest that a common moral system created by\nmankind is absolute, it is not contrary to reason to suggest that a common\nmoral system created by mankind is sensible. In fact, for the Bible to be of\nany use to mankind as a moral code, it must be interpreted by mankind and a\nworkable moral system created for everyday use.\n\nThe Jewish Talmud is the result of centuries of Biblical scholars analysing\nevery word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it. The Children of\nIsrael were given a very strict set of Moral, Civil, Judicial and Ceremonial\nLaws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance\nof moral dilemma in their Society. For a Christian, the situation is no better.\n\nIt seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo-\nChristian God is that which is contained in the Bible (which we can see from\nthe diverse opinions in the Christian newsgroups is not clear). There may well\nbe an absolute morality defined by the Judeo-Christian God for mankind to\nfollow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was\nwritten down by man.\n\nThis leads to the problem of defining morality for our society. If we take the\ndivine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many\ndifferent ways (as an example, consider the immolation of heretics in the\nfifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allows a man to do\nthat to another man under the precept to administer Justice). If we take an\nagnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit\nsociety (with all the danger that this implies). Alternatively, we could take\nthe basis of the Judeo-Christian morality and interpret/extend this to create\nand justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables\nthe people to live Righteously (as many Christian and Non-Christian philosophers\nhave done).\n\nWhatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society, I\nthink the important aspect is the result.\n\nDavid.\n\n---\nOn religion:
frank@D012S658.uucp (Frank O'Dwyer) writes ...\n\nTo the degree that relativism is a more accurate decription of the\ntruth than is objectivism, it provides more power and ability to\ncontrol events.\n\nAssuming, for the moment, that morals _are_ relative, then two\nrelativists can recognize that neither has a lock on the absolute\ntruth and they can proceed to negotiate a workable compromise that\nproduces the desired results.\n\nAssuming that there is an absolute morality, two disagreeing \nobjectivists can either be both wrong or just one of them right; there\nis no room for compromise.  Once you beleive in absolute morals,\nyou must accept that you are amoral or that everyone who disagrees\nwith you is amoral.\n\nGiven a choice between a peaceful compromise or endless contention,\nI'd say that compromise seems to be "better".

...\n\n	It's amazing how everyone automatically blames one side or the other.\n	One thing for sure:  Koresh will have no chance to defend himself\n	against the statements (lacking in fact or COurt sponsored verification)\n	made  by agents who participated in the situation that killed him.\n\n		I don't know they murdered him; I also don't know\n		that the Branch Davidians set a fire and suicidede.\n\n		It is SICK of BATF or FBI spokepeople to make such\n		comments in advance of forensic pathology.\n\n	Stephen:  thank you.  God speed.  \n\n\n	Yah.\n\n\n	BINGO.  Am I the only one  to notice:\n	a)	No peaceful attempt to serve a warrant.\n	b)	Six months to develop a scene and six days to end it?\n	c)	.... ah God:\n\n			25 children\n			at least 64 adults\n			plus 6 at the beginning\n			and more BATF agents\n\n			all dead.\n\n\n	Has anyone asked themselves these questions:\n\n	1)  Have you seen the ENTIRE video sequences taken during the\n	  opening rounds?  I seem to recall missing several key parts:\n		a)  The first five minutes of day one; only the shooting\n		  part comes out.\n		b)  What happened to the Feds video units?  You mean they do\n		  not carry helmet cams?  Wonder why not?\n	2)   How is it you can have camera crews with live transmission\n	  video present and NOT have an uninterrupted record?\n\n		a)  You realize the units carry ittle bitty 8mm backups?\n			That hold 90 minutes per unit?  And there are\n			twounits on the professional handhelds (so no\n			tape turnover gaps)?\n		b)  Until all views are seen, it is premature to point\n			fingers in either direction.\n\n	As you well point out, Stephen.\n\n\n	More on this below.\n\n\n	Yes.  But it is so hard toremain human under the full\n	pressure of hazard, game playing, and life.\n\n\n	More to the point:  when someone dies (almost like it was intended\n	that way), both sides will kill to maintain their innocence --\n		a contradiction in terms.\n\n\n	True.  Usually I pick the unpopular side and point out\n	from the evidence seen what might have alternatively happened.\n\n\n	This requires someone interested in God's Will.  Please note\n	that the outstanding _overt_ problem in this country today\n	is one where the Government:\n\n		wants Caesar's coin to pay off the debt.\n\n\n	Yes:  The AMerican People.

If anyone thinks blaming Koresh -- or the BATF\n	helps this any at all, is sick.  and wrong.\n\n		The reason you can tell that the BATF may not be entirely\n		straight on this is that the leaders at press conferences\n		havew made ANY comments about even the POSSIBILITY that\n		Koresh or his followers caused this.\n\n		The BATF agentss are more concerned with their repuations\n		and morals ("not my fault, Koresh did it!") than they\n		are with:\n\n			25 dead children.\n\n	Same goes for Koresh & his followers - who are all (mostly) dead.\n\n\n	More on power and favoritism.  (My personal opinion).\n\n	Look to history:  whenever privilege has replaced whatever\n	token of objective law and justice a society has had,\n\n		Hitlerrs have followed.\n\n\n	You do your name sake proud, Stephen.\n	Its hard, but please keep on keeping on:\n		each voice in the wilderness now will\n		save a generation unborn from horror\n\n\n	The day I _need_ a gun or abomb to protect myself in this\n	society is the day that society is already beyond redemption\n\n		and that aint' redundant, if you have any Christian\n		belief aytall.\n\n	... and the day that I cannot peacefully enjoin others in the\n	act that Thoreau called Civil Disobedience to rectify the\n	wrongs that my society practises, without undue harm or\n	punishment befalling me, is the day that society has ceased to\n	be a human society, and become a society of animals.\n\n		We are _very_ cclose to that.\n\n\n	Six years fighting an unjust COurt issue:  still struggling to be\n	patient.\n\nFor those who like contrary questions:\n\n	NB:  I was not there.

I do hate liars or the six letter variety of same.\n	The official side has its advocates already; lets balance the\n	equation and asj a few questions on the other side, for the sake\n	of an old saw the BATF abd FBI seem to want to bypass:\n\n		innocent until proven guilty.\n	not\n		innocent until presumed guilty.\n\n	1)  Where are the video tapes from the tanks?  ALL of them.\n\n		Don't tell me they do not exist.  They are standard\n		equipment.\n\n	2)  So you think Koresh fired the place, because of the explosion?\n\n		a)  Tear gas comes with an aerosol to spread it.  This\n		  aerosol is DELIBERATELY made to be as non-flammable\n		  as possible.  It is as non-flammable as possible.\n\n			.... gotcha!\n\n		  ... when in isolation from other substances.\n\n		  WHy was a pipe deliveryu system used rather than remote\n		  launchers?  WHy did the FBI not announce "this window,\n		  blown in plus tear gas, five minutes; then the wall come\n		  down", and maintain a left to right sequence?\n\n		b)  Most aerosols also have a secondary compound, that when\n		  mixed in, becomes a VERY flammable (and difficult to trace)\n		  suspension, with a VERY special property:  exposure to\n		  brief eruptions of high heat (muzzle blasts) or long\n		  exposure to low heat (matches, a stove) will NOT tend\n		  to ignite.\n\n			What other chemicals come up in the forensics?\n			Who else will be allowed to test the site?\n\n		c)  After a few minutes to hours (ifdesired, the combnation\n		  rate can be controlled as desired), the mixture can be made\n		  to become veryignitable onb exposure to a temperature\n		  above a certain point (a tracer round) for a certain\n		  heat quantity (a small explosive charge) or for a length\n		  of time (start a wall fire and wait).\n\n			Check your military records; look at the tapes.\n			Why were tanks (large capacity delivey systems),\n			tear gas (why not somnorifics?), and now (why\n			the hurry. was there still a comm channel open\n			to the outside?).\n\n			Do you see any trace of fire coming BACK to the\n			compound in the videos?

These laws written for the Israelites, God's chosen people whom God had\nexpressly set apart from the rest of the world.  The Israelites were a\ndirect witness to God's existence.  To disobey God after KNOWing that God\nis real would be an outright denial of God and therefore immediately punishable.\nRemember, these laws were written for a different time and applied only to \nGod's chosen people.  But Jesus has changed all of that.  We are living in the\nage of grace.  Sin is no longer immediately punishable by death.  There is\nrepentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.  And not just\nfor a few chosen people.  Salvation is available to everyone, Jew and Gentile\nalike.\n\nGod be with you,
#In article <93109.231733ISSCCK@BYUVM.BITNET> "Casper C. Knies" <ISSCCK@BYUVM#.B\n#>As a Latter-day Saint, I found John's statement *not at all* ludicrous...\n#>\n#>Please allow me to explain myself.  In 1838, the governor of Missouri,\n#>governor Boggs, issued his so-called "Mormon extermination order."  The\n#>only crime ("illegal activity") the Latter-day Saints had committed, was\n#>their religious affiliation, their anti-slave stance (Missouri still\n#>allowed slave practices), and their growing numbers/influence in Missouri.\n#>\n#>I guess the Mormons "got what they deserved," because they refused to bow\n#>to the will of (corrupt and evil) secular authorities. This "disobedience"\n#>brought upon them persecution, murder, and finally forced expulsion from\n#>their lands and settlements...\n#\n#It is significant to remember that these secular positions were held by\n#"average" people, and that at the time, almost all Americans were pretty\n#homogeonously Christian. It was largely the mainstream Christian's disgust\n#at such practices as polygamy which resulted in their irrational hatred.\n\nTrue, but that is exactly the "problem": the Mormon extermination order\nwas issued not just by a Christian, it was ALLOWED under the Constitution\nof the United States, which was instituted precisely to prevent incidents\nlike this "order" from occurring in the first place...  As I indicated in\nan earlier posting, your "irrational hatred" is clearly evidenced by\nindividuals like Robert Weiss (who could have been Gov. Boggs' Lieutenant;\nhe would have fitted right in, drewling et al), and seems a modern-day\noccurrence, based on results (slander, persecution, misrepresentation,\nlies, denying Mormons representation in their own user group, etc. etc.\n\nIn intent and purpose, what really has changed?\n\n#The situation is not entirely different today.  Many irrational feelings\n#and beliefs are justified through religion.  I don't think most of them\n#are started because of religion, but religion certainly helps justify and\n#perpetuate prejudices and practices by providing a neat justification\n#which discourages critical thought.\n\nTrue, as evidenced by numerous examples, as I am sure you're aware.\n\n#>In any regard, Mormon history alone indicates that secular authorities (and\n#>I don't even discuss how Uthan's were suckered into allowing part of their\n#>lands in becoming nerve-gas and atomic bomb testing grounds...) is far from\n#>being trusted or righteous.  Have things really changed for the better?  I\n#>may be a born cynic, but I have NO reason whatsoever that such has been the\n#>case. In the early 1980s, I believe, the late President Kimball (lds church\n#>leader) strongly protested federal attempts to locate the MX-"Peace Keeper"\n#>missile maze from being built in Utah (yet another "inspired" decision from\n#secular authorities).  Fortunately, his opposition was influential enough\n#for the feds to back off.\n#\n#Do you mean that the "secular authorities" are some continuous group of\n#people with the common and uninterrupted goal of harrassing/eradicating the\n#Mormons?  Do you honestly believe that the main reason for using Utah for\n#nuclear testing etc.. was to "get them thar Mormons"?  And what about the\n#majority of Uthan's who aren't Mormons?  You seem to be searching for enemy\n ^^^^^^^^\n(Correction: the majority of Utahn's ARE Mormon (60-70% I believe, up to a\n 100% in many cities and settlements throughout the Western states.)\n\n#conspiracies.  It is paranoid to believe that everything that affects you\n#badly must have been done primarily for that purpose.\n\nWhat I mean is that secular authorities are to be watched, as we believe\nthat Satan has been given some power and dominion over the earth to divert\ntruth, judgment, and justice.  In addition, we believe that the adversary\nhas power to influence the unjust and idolatrous (greed for money would be\na good example) in order to bring about persecution, war, oppression, and\nevil combinations.  As an intelligent being, don't you suppose that the\ndestroyer would yield his influence foremost on those with political power?\n\nAs far as Utah is concerned, what I pointed out were some horrible examples\nof environmental nightmares imposed upon by secular authorities, which have\nbrought death, disease, (i.e. the "downwinders") and environmental contami-\nnation.  I am hardly "paranoid," I am just not "expecting" too much from a\nsecular government that may not share our values and faith, and which indeed\n(as Gov. Boggs et al.) may be out to harm and destroy us.  As a matter of\nfact, prophecies in my church indicate that in future years, (global)\npersecution against Mormons will so increase in intensity and scope, that\n(paraphrasing) "all those who wish to escape persecution and murder must\nflee to Zion."

Seems to be, barring evidence to the contrary, that Koresh was simply\nanother deranged fanatic who thought it neccessary to take a whole bunch of\nfolks with him, children and all, to satisfy his delusional mania. Jim\nJones, circa 1993.\n\n\nNope - fruitcakes like Koresh have been demonstrating such evil corruption\nfor centuries.
#In <mcclaryC5snpq.KB1@netcom.com> mcclary@netcom.com (Michael McClary)\n#        Just thought I'd clear up a few of the murky areas...\n#\n#>Actually, after surviving being driven out of Nauvoo, and later Carthage,\n#>the Mormons DID fortify Utah.  They still arm themselves to "defend the\n#>faith", and stockpile food as well.  They have been involved in quite a\n#>lot of illegal activity - including multiple (and often underage) wives\n#>for the leaders - a practice still in vogue with some splinters of their\n#>sect.  The parallels between Koresh and Joseph Smith are striking.\n#                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nBy "they," you mean the leaders of the lds church?  I grant you that when\nJoseph Smith was still alive, plenty of "accusations" were filed, most of\nwhich had little bearing with reality, as evidenced by various verdicts.\nI have studied lds history for 15 years now, and I have yet to see prove\nthat the lds leadership was involved, in quote: "illegal activities."\nPlural marriage, yes, but your charge of "underage" wives sounds like it\ncould have originated from a tabloid, and discredits the high moral\nstandards which characterized these leaders and families, unlike, as it\nappears, those of David Koresh.\n\n#        Joseph Smith started the sect.  After he and his brother Hyram\n#were murdered in a Nauvoo, Il. jail cell, church membership split over\n#who to follow.  Initially, Smith was considered a prophet (just like\n#Mohammed, a rather interesting parallel considering Muslims consider\n#Christ to be a prophet the same as Jews, I'm led to understand.  Make\n#no mistake, this was no messiah we're talking about in Smith).  The\n\nAnd neither did he claim he was.  As the church reflects the moral\naptitude of its leaders (and especially those of Joseph Smith), I have\nnothing but the highest respect for this inspired man, whose only "crime"\nwas that he refused to deny that he had seen a vision...  Many have tried\nto explain the "Smith phenomenon" away, but the bold presence of an 8.5\nmillion member strong church stands as a witness that Joseph Smith's\ntestimony had enough resilience and power to carry on the message.\n\n#thought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handed\n#down father to son.  After Joseph Smith died, his son was only\n#entering his teens.  Brigham Young and a few others claimed to have\n#been bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death.  The\n#Council of Twelve, the Church governing body, wasn't of much help\n#here, and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects.\n#Brigham Young took his followers to Salt Lake.  The rest waited\n#for Smith Jr. to grow up enough to assume leadership.  The other\n#claimants to the leadership were soon ignored, like Mike Dukakis. ;-)\n\n"The rest" were apostates and excommunicated members of the Church,\nwhile the great majority of the membership, the Twelve, and the various\nauxiliary organizations, chose to accept Brigham Young as the new\nprophet and leader of the Church.  If you knew your lds scriptures and\ndoctrine, you would have known that Brigham Young was the FIRST in\nline to fill the prophet Joseph Smith's vacancy: he was the senior\napostle in the Quorum, and various comments made by Joseph indicated\nthat it was Brigham who would lead the latter-day exodus to the West.\n\nOther rightful "heirs" were either dead (Hyrum Smith) or excommunicated\n(Oliver Cowdery), and while persecutions abounded and intensified,\nJoseph Smith had already given orders to look for a new place, an empty\nland beyond the boundaries of the United States (at that time).  This\n"Rekhabite" principle (pseudographia) was well understood and antipated\nby the great majority of lds faithful, and was not questioned by them.\n\nGranted, a couple of "do-it-yourselfers" stayed behind, unwilling to\nsacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown, but\nthis also was necessary to separate the tares from the wheat.  The\nchurch benefitted from this purification process: they became even\nmore unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world.\n\n#        Both sects practiced the "1-year food stockpile" doctrine,\n#and this being frontier and farming country most carried or at\n#least owned weapons.  There is little evidence that they were a\n#militaristic sect, given that they tended to move on rather than\n#face large-scale opposition.  Brigham Young, having suffered a\n#great deal getting to Salt Lake, seems to have been quite\n#justified in making military training a good thing.  Remember,\n#this was far beyond where even the US Army went, and these people\n#had nobody to turn to save themselves.\n#\n#        Just a little context to put this all in perspective.\n\nBTW, since when is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (one of\nthe largest denominations in the country) a "sect"???  It didn't "splinter"\nfrom any other religion, as did say, the Southern Baptists or Methodists.\n\n#>So what did the Mormons get?  It seems that J. Edgar Hoover was very\n#>impressed with the way they kept secrets.  (They're pledged to defend\n#>secrets with their lives and atone for sin with blood.  Many actually\n#>do - even to the point of suicide.)\n\nWhat a balloney.  Suicide is sinful and against the law of God.  I am\nnot comfortable with this alleged "cosiness" with Mammon: I assure you\nthat *many* among us reject this attitude categorically.  Period.  Our\nONLY true allegiance is to our God and to the leaders which He has\nappointed to represent Him.  In any regard, to read this TRASH (about\nsuicide and "atone for sins with blood") is yet another insulting\nmisrepresentation of what my church believes in and stands for...\n\n#\n#        The RLDS, the Reorganized LDS, are friendly rivals of the LDS\n#and delight in telling stories about them, which generates quick retorts\n#from the LDS members and everybody has a grand time.  At no time have\n#I ever even heard this hinted at.  I'm taking it with a salt block.\n\nMake it a really big salt mountain with a glacier on top.\n\n#>  So he hired virtually no one but\n#>Mormons, until the FBI was almost exclusively staffed by members of the\n#>Church of Later Day Saints.  Though J. Edgar is finally gone, the FBI\n#>personnel (especially the field agents) are still heavily Mormon.\n#>I have often wondered how this might affect the FBI's treatment\n#>of religious organizations a Mormon would consider heretical.\n\nPreposterous.  Even if this were true (reliable data, please), I\nam convinced that those officers would perform to the highest codes\nof honor and conduct (that's why they were selected for in the\nfirst place, remember?).  Besides, one of our Articles of Faith\nSTRONGLY states the principle of freedom of religion, and that all\npeople are free to worship "*how*, *where*, or *what* they may."\n\n#        If it's true, there would be little affect.  LDS and RLDS\n#philosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the true\n#Church as set down by Jesus, but that God will judge each on his\n#own merits.  In addition, the RLDS also contend (and the LDS may\n#as well) that ignorance of the True Way (tm) is an excuse.  You\n#can only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejected\n#it.  In short, LDS and RLDS suffer everybody from Lutherans to\n#Buddhists, secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong they\n#will not be penalized for ignorance.  It is more likely that Hoover\n#liked them because of their rather strict upbringings which forbade\n#alcohol, tobacco, hot drink (like coffee or tea), and the like.\n#These people are the "salt of the Earth" and as such are more\n#easily made to follow orders and have few vices to be used against them.\n\nA good explanation, I can accept that.  You are right that lds people\nare sometimes a little too cosy with Mammon's "orders" (the late\npresident Kimball, for example, was an exception with his strong\nopposition of the selection of the MX "Peace Keeper" missile maze\nin Utah).\n\n#        That's my somewhat educated guess, anyway.  Both sects have\n#splinter groups that don't mirror the masses, but these are small\n#and rare, and hardly worth noting their common ancestry.\n#\n#        None of this has any relevance to guns, though.  When a\n#man's religion is used to deny him the right of self-protection with\n#the weapons suitable for the job, he'll find an ally in me.\n#\n#< Dan Sorenson, DoD #1066 z1dan@exnet.iastate.edu viking@iastate.edu >\n#<  ISU only censors what I read, not what I say.

A question regarding the Islamic view towards homosexuality came up in a\ndiscussion group that I participate in, and I'd like to ask the question here,\n\n"What is the Islamic view towards homosexuality?"
Is there any difference in saying \n\n"Absolute Truth exists, but some people think its a lie"\n\nand\n\n"Truth is relative" ?\n\nI think there is:  in both examples, the first statement is a\nfundamental disagreement between at least two people; the \nsecond statement is agreed upon by all.\n\nTo put it another way, someone who says objective values exist\ndoes not agree that values are subjective.
Nut or not, he was clearly a liar.  He said he would surrender after\n  local radio stations broadcast his message, but he didn't.  Then he\n  said he would surrender after Passover, but he didn't.\n\n  None of which excuses the gross incompetence and disregard for the\n  safety of the children displayed by the feds.   As someone else\n  pointed out, if it had been Chelsea Clinton in there you would \n  probably have seen more restraint.
[...lots of stuff about intellectual errors deleted...]\n\nThis is cute, but I see no statement telling me why your church is the true \nchurch. I do presume that you know or at least believe that yours is true. \nAttempting to ream my faith without replacing it with something "better" is \na real good way to loose a person completely from Christ.\n\nThis is the greatest reason I see that these attacks are not motivated by \nlove. They only seek to destroy there is no building or replacing of belief. \nThis is not something Christ did. He guided and instructed He didn't \nseek to destroy the faith He found, He redirected it. \n\nThis is what I see when people say they "love" <insert favorite group here>. \nAnd I have to laugh at the irony.
Bill, I have taken the time to explain that biblical scholars consider the\nJosephus reference to be an early Christian insert.  By biblical scholar I mean\nan expert who, in the course of his or her research, is willing to let the\nchips fall where they may.  This excludes literalists, who may otherwise be\ndefined as biblical apologists.  They find what they want to find.  They are\nnot trustworthy by scholarly standards (and others).\n\nWhy an insert?  Read it - I have, a number of times.  The passage is glaringly\nout of context, and Josephus, a superb writer, had no such problem elsewhere \nin his work.  The passage has *nothing* to do with the subject matter in which \nit lies.  It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears.\n\nUntil you can demonstrate how and why the scholarly community is wrong about\nthe Josephus insert, your "proof" is meaningless and it should not be repeated\nhere.  What's more, even if Josephus happened to be legitimate, it would "prove"\nnothing.  Scholars speak of the "weight of evidence."  Far more independent\nevidence would be required to validate your claim.  Until forthcoming, your\nbelief is based on faith.  That's OK, but you exceed your rights when you pass\nfaith off as fact.\n\nAs for the gospels, there are parallels, but there are also glaring\ninconsistencies and contradictions.  Shouldn't a perfect canon be perfect? \nShouldn't there be absolutely no room for debate?  I suggest you read _Gospel \nFictions_ by Randel Helms, and _The Unauthorized Version_ by Robin Fox (for \nHerb Huston, no known kinship or familial relationship, but we do indeed share \nan evolutionary ancestry).\n\nThe fact that there are inconsistencies, gaps and contradictions does not deny\nyour position.  On the other hand, neither do the gospels "prove" your faith. \nIndependent evidence is necessary, and I know of none (which we have already\ndiscussed, and so far you have not provided any).  Until then, its faith. \nMoreover, you have committed a fundamental error in logic.  You have attempted\nto "prove" your claim with that which you want to prove.  Its no different than\nsaying "I am right because I say so."  \n\nYour logic is full of circles.  It reminds me a bit of the 1910 Presbyterian \nGeneral Assembly.  The assembly defined five fundamentals (this is where\n"fundamentalist" came from) of orthodox Protestant Christianity, to wit: 1)\nJesus performed miracles, 2) Jesus was born of a virgin, 3) Jesus was bodily\nresurrected, 4) Jesus' crucifixion atoned for human sin, and - here is the\nclincher - 5) the bible is the inerrant word of God.  Presbyterians construe\n"inerrant" broadly as spritually inerrant.  Fundamentalists take the\nfirst four as literally true, and then validate them with a literally inerrant\nbible, which contains the first four, and which is the only thing known to \ncontain the first four.  \n\nSmoke and mirrors and wands and hand waving if ever there was!\n\nIts faith, Bill.  You don't have any more or better truths than anyone else. \nWhatever works for you.  Just don't foist it on others. \n\nRegards,
A lot of people won't agree with me.  That's their right and I respect that.\nHowever, to the point, Jews are also covered by the saving grace of Jesus\nChrist.  There are Jews who have become Christians.

Walter-\n\nI tried several times in the past to communicate with you and Susan, but\nyou ignored me, and I don't honestly believe my letters were mean.

As my Lord advised, that if you are unwelcome in\na city then brush the dust of your feet and go on.\n\nIf anyone cares about the topic they write to me direct, if not, well,\nmay God bless you as well.
Brian K., I am pleased with your honesty.  And to be honest as well, I\nbelieve you have not asked my god to come to you.  Why do I say this?\nBecause by the things you write on the net, and the manner with which\nyou write them, you show me that you made up your own god and are\nattempting to pass him off as the real thing.  I got news for you.\nYours doesn't at all sound like mine.  Your god doesn't come to you\nbecause your god doesn't exist.\n\n\nI am sorry Brian, but when I read your postings, I do not see an open mind.\nWhat I do see is misunderstanding, lack of knowledge, arrogance and mockery.\n\n\nBe true to yourself then.  Have an open mind.  And so end the mockery.  Gain \nknowledge of the real God.  Put your presumptions aside.  Read the\nBible and know that there is, truly is, a reason for everything and\nthere exists a God that has so much love for you that the depth of it goes beyond\nour shallow worldly experience.  A person who commits himself  \nto seeking God, will find God.  Jesus stands at your door and knocks.  But a\nperson who half-heartedly opens the Bible, or opens it with purpose to find \nsomething to mock, will find, learn and see nothing.  The only thing one\nwill gain with that attitude is folly.\n\nBe careful to not jump the gun, for at first glance, there are many passages\nin the Bible that will seem bizarre and absurd.  Be assured that even\nthough they seem alien at first, be confident that they are not.\nBe assured that beyond your present comprehension, there lies such\ndeep reasons that once you see them, you will indeed be satisfied. \nI will personally guarantee that one.  As Jesus put it, "You will never\nbe thirsty again.  Your cup will even flow over."\n\n\nFrom King Solomon (970 B.C. to 930 B.C.):\n\n    "It is the glory of God to conceal a matter;\n     to search out a matter is the glory of kings."\n\n\nJesus says in John 6:44 & 55:\n\n   "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him."\n\n\nAnd in John 3:16:\n\n   "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,\n   that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal\n   life."\n\n\nYou are included in "whosoever".  And I also pray that the Father is\ndrawing you, which it seems He is doing else you wouldn't be posting\nto talk.religion.misc.  Remember Brian, you could be a St. Paul in the\nmaking.  Paul not only mocked Christians as you do, but also had pleasure\nstoning them.  Yet God showed him mercy, saved him, and Paul became\non of the most celebrated men in the history of God's church.\n\nYou see Brian, I myself better be careful and not judge you, because\nyou could indeed be the next Paul.  For with the fervor that you attack\nChristians,  one day you might find yourself one, and like Paul,\nproclaim the good news of Jesus with that very same fervor or more.\n\nOr you could be the next Peter.  What Jesus said to Peter, Jesus would \nprobably say to you: "Satan would surely like to have you."  Why so?\nBecause Peter was hard-headed, cynical and demonstrated great\nmoments of stupidity, but once Peter committed himself to a task\nhe did with full heart.  Peter was the only apostle to have the\nfaith to walk on water as Jesus did.\n\nYou asked "Why not believe in Zeus?"  Zeus didn't offer eternal life.\nYou got nothing to gain by believing in Zeus.
Tony   \n\nI appreciate the narrow-mindedness of the view expressed in\nthe text you quoted.  I also appreciate your being amused\nby such determined ignorance.  Without taking anything away\nfrom your mirth, I want to say that these views sadden me.\nI can only hope that that sort of narrow-mindedness will\ndie with the generations that have promoted it.  Teach \nyour children well.\n\n<wet blanket mode off>\n\nPax.\n\nJohn
Brian K., guess what?  You missed the point.  On a scale from cold to\nhot, you are at 0 degrees Kelvin.\n\n\nThen as you understand it, what is it?\n\n\nYes.  I agree with that.  But what does that have to do with Jesus?\nPunishment you say?  Jesus did not regard his death as punishment. \n\n\nGood.  I wouldn't either--not the way you understand it.  \n\n\nAsk Jesus himself.  He himself said why in John 12:23-32.  It\nisn't a mystery to anyone and there certainly is no need for\na persuasive argument.   Read Jesus's own reply to your\nquestion.\n\nJesus gives more reasons in John 16:7.  But one obvious reason\nwhy Jesus died, (and as with everything else, it has nothing do with\nhis punishment) was that he could rise to life again--so that\nwe would "stop doubting and believe" (John 21:27).  The fact\nthat Jesus rose from the dead is my hope that I too will rise\nfrom the dead.  It is an obvious point.  Do not overlook it.\nWithout this obvious point, I would have no hope\nand my faith would be vanity.\n\nWhy did Jesus suffer in his death?  Again, ask Jesus.  Jesus\nsays why in John 15:18-25.   That's no mystery either.  "The\nworld hates him without reason."  It is a direct proclamation\nof how far we humans botch things up and thus, how much we\nneed a Saviour.

I'm curious about this statement, is it a known understanding amongst\nChristian believers that people who don't understand the Christian\ndoctrines are enjoying this state?

I became aware of the claim years ago.  So I decided to check it out, on my\nown.  But, then, that was in BN times (Before Net).  So, here are some \nreferences.  See Robin Lane Fox's _The unauthorized version_, (p.284) where \nLane Fox writes, "... the one passage which appears to [comment on Jesus' \ncareer] is agreed to be a Christian addition."\n\nIn my Re:Albert Sabin response (C5u7sJ.391@sunfish.usd.edu) to Jim Lippard (21\nApril 93), I noted that consensus is typically indicated subtly as in Elaine \nPagel's _The gnostic gospels_ (p.85), to wit:  "A comment *attributed* to\nJosephus reports ... [emphasis mine]".  Scholars sometimes do not even mention\nthe two Josephus entries, another subtlety reflecting consensus.\n\nSo far as I can deduce, today's consensus is built on at least three things: \n1) the long passage is way out of context, 2) Origen did not know about the\nlong passage, and 3) the short and long passages are contradictory. \nI don't know the references wherein the arguments which led to consensus are\norginally developed (does anyone?).\n\nBiblical scholars as I defined them include theologians and historians.  The\nformer, like the latter, incorporate historical, social, technological and\nideological contexts as well as theology.  So the distinction is blurred.  I \ndidn't elaborate on that.  Sorry.  (In turn, historians are compelled to\nincorporate theology).\n\nCan't say about the number of copies.  These were, however, BG times (Before \nGutenburg).  A hundred first editions seems exceedingly high; counting on one \nhand seems more reasonable.  Perhaps those mss. without the long insert (if any,\nbecause anything is possible) have been destroyed.  Such a practice is \ncertainly not foreign to religions.  Anyway, all we have are mss. which have \nthe two entries.  Lippart (in the message noted above) talks about an Arabic \nms.  But here the ms. date is critical.\n\n:-)

You keep saying that. I do not think it means what you think it\nmeans.\nPerhaps you should explain what you think "science has it's basis\nin values" means.

No.  There are two problems here:\n\n(1) Peter died two millenia ago.  The original letters he wrote have\nlong since decayed into dust.  If he were alive today and I could\nquestion him, then this might lend credibility to your claims (but\nprobably not much, because after all, I've heard people claim with all\nsincerity that they've spoken with Elvis recently).  But after his\ndeath, Peter's writings were transcribed by monks for centuries, and I\nfind it hard to believe that one of them somewhere didn't decide to\nchange the wording of something to make it (in his opinion) a little\neasier to understand.\n\n(2) Even if Peter did witness the miracles of Jesus two millenia ago,\nthat doesn't mean that your deity is what the Bible says it is (God\nmight just be Satan, trying to convince everyone that he's a nice\nguy), or even that your deity is still alive and active in the world\ntoday.\n\nNice try, but it just isn't enough to convince me, especially since\nyour wild claims about your deity seem to fly in the face of the way\nI've observed the world to work.  Please find something more compelling.
And does it not say in scripture that no man knows the hour of His coming, not\neven the angels in Heaven but only the Father Himself?  DK was trying to play\nGod by breaking the seals himself.  DK killed himself and as many of his\nfollowers as he could.  BTW, God did save the children.  They are in Heaven,\na far better place.  How do I know?  By faith.\n\nGod be with you,
John 12:24-26: "Most assuredly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat\nfalls onto the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it\nproduces much grain.\n  "He who loves his life will lose it, and he who hates his life in\nthis world will keep it for eternal life.\n  "If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there My\nservant will be also.  If anyone serves Me, him My Father will honor."\n\nWhy would I want an eternal life if I hate this one?\n\nIf we were created by a deity, why would that deity not wish us to\nenjoy what he has given us?\n\nWhy would I want to live forever?  The challenge in my life is that I\nwill die, and that I must give my life the meaning I wish it to have\nbefore that happens.  My time is here and will someday pass; I will be\ncontent to live on in the memories of my friends, and once they too\nare dead, then I will no longer have any reason to exist.\n\nIn short: even if your deity *does* exist, that doesn't automatically\nmean that I would worship it.  I am content to live my own life, and\nfend for myself, so when I die, I can be proud of the fact that no\nmatter where I end up, it will be because of *my* actions and *my* choices.\n\nIf your god decides to toss me into a flaming pit for this, then so be\nit.  I would much rather just cease to exist.  But if your god wants\nmy respect and my obedience, then it had better earn these; and if it\ndoes, then they will be very strong and true.\n\n\nJesus wasn't the only one who rose from the dead -- I think it was\nOsiris who did the same, as well as a few characters from Greek or\nNorse legend, if memory serves.\n\nBut still: WHY would I want to rise from the dead?  Why do *you* want to?\n\n\nIf your god wants to win my devotion, then it knows what it can do --\nprovide some way for me to believe without having to resort to blind\nfaith that could be applied equally well to any religion.\n\n\nThat's precisely it.  I neither see nor know Zeus either, nor Odin.\nShall I offer them the same devotion I offer Jesus?\n\n\nYou've got to understand my point-of-view: I see Christians spouting\nBible verse all the time as if it were some sort of magic spell that\nwill level all opposition.  Truth is, it's not.  Robert has never\ndemonstrated that he actually understands what the verses imply; he\njust rattles them off day by day.  Some brazenly fly in the face of\ncommon sense and reality, and I point these out where I can.\n\nBut even more than that, even when Christians *do* try to explain the\nverses in their own words, they do so from a Christian point of view,\nwhich is that every human being would want to be a Christian if only\nhe or she understood the Christian message properly, and then all\nstrife and suffering on the earth would end.  Here's the problem with\nthat: substitute "Moslem" or "Buddhist" or "Satanist" instead of\n"Christian", and it means the same thing.\n\nChristanity is a very nice belief set around a very nice book.  But if\nyou want to make me believe that it has any bearing on the REAL WORLD,\nyou've got some convincing to do.\n\n\nAnd in my opinion, you're bumbling about blindly making up entities\nwhere there aren't any, and depriving yourself of a true understanding\nand enjoyment of your life.  As long as you keep your beliefs to\nyourself, I'll keep my beliefs to myself -- but as soon as you start\nwaving them around, expect me to toss in my opinions, too.

(Frank DeCenso)\n\n\nHow incredibly fucking stupid.  Of *course* the text is referring to the city\nitself (buildings, bricks, mortar, etc.)  Otherwise it makes no sense to\nrefer to the future of Tyre as being reduced to nothing but a _place_ to spread \nfishing nets.

THE DIVINE MASTERS       \n      \n               Most Christians would agree, and correctly so, that \n          Jesus Christ was a Divine Master, and a projection of God \n          into the physical world, God Incarnate. \n          \n               But there are some very important related facts that \n          Christians are COMPLETELY IGNORANT of, as are followers of \n          most other world religions. \n           \n               First, Jesus Christ was NOT unique, John 3:16 NOTWITH-\n          STANDING.  There is ALWAYS at least one such Divine Master \n          (God Incarnate) PHYSICALLY ALIVE in this world AT ALL TIMES, \n          a continuous succession THROUGHOUT HISTORY, both before and \n          after the life of Jesus. \n    \n               The followers of some of these Masters founded the \n          world's major religions, usually PERVERTING the teachings of \n          their Master in the process.  Christians, for example, added \n          THREATS of "ETERNAL DAMNATION" in Hell, and DELETED the \n          teaching of REincarnation. \n       \n               Secondly, and more importantly, after a particular \n          Master physically dies and leaves this world, there is \n          NOTHING that He can do for ANYbody except for the relatively \n          few people that He INITIATED while He was still PHYSICALLY \n          alive.  (THAT IS SIMPLY THE WAY GOD SET THINGS UP IN THE \n          UNIVERSES.)                             \n\n               Therefore, all those Christians who worship Jesus, and \n          pray to Jesus, and expect Jesus to return and save them from \n          their sins, are only KIDDING THEMSELVES, and have allowed \n          themselves to be DUPED by a religion that was mostly \n          MANUFACTURED by the Romans. \n      \n               And emotional "feelings" are a TOTALLY DECEIVING \n          indicator for religious validity. \n    \n               These things are similarly true for followers of most \n          other major world religions, including Islam. \n     \n               Thirdly, the primary function of each Master is to tune \n          His Initiates into the "AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM" or "SOUND \n          CURRENT", (referred to as "THE WORD" in John 1:1-5, and as \n          "The River of Life" in Revelation 22:1), and to personally \n          guide each of them thru the upper levels of Heaven while they \n          are still connected to their living physical bodies by a \n          "silver cord". \n    \n               True Salvation, which completes a Soul's cycles of \n          REincarnation in the physical and psychic planes, is achieved \n          only by reaching at least the "SOUL PLANE", which is five \n          levels or universes above the physical universe, and this \n          canNOT be done without the help of a PHYSICALLY-Living Divine \n          Master. \n    \n               One such Divine Master alive today is an American, Sri \n          Harold Klemp, the Living "Eck" Master or "Mahanta" for the \n          "Eckankar" organization, now headquartered in Minneapolis, \n          (P.O. Box 27300;  zip 55427). \n    \n               Another Divine Master is Maharaj Gurinder Singh Ji, now \n          living in Punjab, India, and is associated with the "Sant \n          Mat" organization. \n      \n               One of the classic books on this subject is "THE PATH OF \n          THE MASTERS" (Radha Soami Books, P.O. Box 242, Gardena, CA  \n          90247), written in 1939 by Dr. Julian Johnson, a theologian \n          and surgeon who spent the last years of his life in India \n          studying under and closely observing the Sant Mat Master of \n          that time, Maharaj Sawan Singh Ji. \n    \n               Several of the Eckankar books, including some authored \n          by Sri Paul Twitchell or Sri Harold Klemp, can be found in \n          most public and university libraries and some book stores, or \n          obtained thru inter-library loan.  The book "ECKANKAR--THE \n          KEY TO SECRET WORLDS", by Sri Paul Twitchell, is ANOTHER \n          classic. \n    \n               Many Christians are likely to confuse the Masters with \n          the "Anti-Christ", which is or was to be a temporary world \n          dictator during the so-called "last days".  But the Masters \n          don't ever rule, even when asked or expected to do so as \n          Jesus was. \n    \n               People who continue following Christianity, Islam, or \n          other orthodox religions with a physically-DEAD Master, will \n          CONTINUE on their cycles of REincarnation, between the \n          Psychic Planes and this MISERABLE physical world, until they \n          finally accept Initiation from a PHYSICALLY-LIVING Divine \n          Master. \n    \n          \n    \n          RE-INCARNATION\n          \n               The book "HERE AND HEREAFTER", by Ruth Montgomery, \n          describes several kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation \n          as a FACT OF LIFE, including HYPNOTIC REGRESSIONS to past \n          lives [about 50% accurate; the subconscious mind sometimes \n          makes things up, especially with a bad hypnotist], \n          SPONTANEOUS RECALL (especially by young children, some of \n          whom can identify their most recent previous relatives, \n          homes, possessions, etc.), DREAM RECALL of past life experi-\n          ences, DEJA VU (familiarity with a far off land while travel-\n          ing there for the first time on vacation), the psychic read-\n          ings of the late EDGAR CAYCE, and EVEN SUPPORTING STATEMENTS \n          FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including Matthew 17:11-13 (John the \n          Baptist was the REINCARNATION of Elias.) and John 9:1-2 (How \n          can a person POSSIBLY sin before he is born, unless he LIVED \n          BEFORE?!).  [ ALWAYS use the "KING JAMES VERSION".  Later \n          versions are PER-VERSIONS! ] \n          \n               Strong INTERESTS, innate TALENTS, strong PHOBIAS, etc., \n          typically originate from a person's PAST LIVES.  For example, \n          a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually \n          results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE.  \n          And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to \n          another person being met for the first time in THIS life, \n          because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS \n          INCARNATION. \n\n               The teaching of REincarnation also includes the LAW OF \n          KARMA (Galatians 6:7, Revelation 13:10, etc.).  People would \n          behave much better toward each other if they knew that their \n          actions in the present will surely be reaped by them in the \n          future, or in a FUTURE INCARNATION! \n\n\n\n          "2nd COMINGS"\n\n               If a Divine Master physically dies ("translates") \n          before a particular Initiate of His does, then when that \n          Initiate physically dies ("translates"), the Master will meet \n          him on the Astral level and take him directly to the Soul \n          Plane.  This is the ONE AND ONLY correct meaning of a 2nd \n          Coming.  It is an INDIVIDUAL experience, NOT something that \n          happens for everyone all at once.  People who are still \n          waiting for Jesus' "2nd Coming" are WAITING IN VAIN. \n    \n          \n          \n          PLANES OF EXISTENCE\n\n               The physical universe is the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN \n          major levels of existence.  Above the Physical Plane is the \n          Astral Plane, the Causal Plane, the Mental Plane, the Etheric \n          Plane (often counted as the upper part of the Mental Plane), \n          the Soul Plane, and several higher Spiritual Planes.  The \n          Soul Plane is the FIRST TRUE HEAVEN, (counting upward from \n          the Physical).  The planes between (but NOT including) the \n          Physical and Soul Planes are called the Psychic Planes. \n    \n               It is likely that ESP, telepathy, astrological \n          influences, radionic effects, biological transmutations [See \n          the 1972 book with that title.], and other phenomena without \n          an apparent physical origin, result from INTERACTIONS between \n          the Psychic Planes and the Physical Plane. \n    \n               The major planes are also SUB-DIVIDED.  For example, a \n          sub-plane of the Astral Plane is called "Hades", and the \n          Christian Hell occupies a SMALL part of it, created there \n          LESS THAN 2000 YEARS AGO by the EARLY CATHOLIC CHURCH by some \n          kind of black magic or by simply teaching its existence in a \n          THREATENING manner.  The Christian "Heaven" is located \n          elsewhere on the Astral Plane.  Good Christians will go there \n          for a short while and then REincarnate back to Earth. \n          \n          \n          \n          SOUND CURRENT vs. BLIND FAITH\n\n               The Christian religion demands of its followers an \n          extraordinary amount of BLIND FAITH backed up by little more \n          than GOOD FEELING (which is TOTALLY DECEIVING). \n       \n               If a person is not HEARING some form of the "SOUND \n          CURRENT" ("THE WORD", "THE BANI", "THE AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM"), \n          then his cycles of REINCARNATION in this MISERABLE world WILL \n          CONTINUE. \n    \n               The "SOUND CURRENT" manifests differently for different \n          Initiates, and can sound like a rushing wind, ocean waves on \n          the sea shore, buzzing bees, higher-pitched buzzing sound, a \n          flute, various heavenly music, or other sounds.  In Eckankar, \n          Members start hearing it near the end of their first year as \n          a Member.  This and other experiences (such as "SOUL TRAVEL") \n          REPLACE blind faith. \n    \n\n\n               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., \n          please consult my CITED SOURCES (3 books, 2 addresses). \n\n\n\n               UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this \n          IMPORTANT Information is ENCOURAGED.

I was curious to check out how many San Jose Mercury News mentioned\nTyre (1990-92). Here's the outcome from the research (condenced versions,\ncopyright San Jose Mercury news):\n\n---\n  Bombings in the two largest cities in southern Lebanon killed 11 people\nand \nwounded 80 others. A car bomb blew up in Tyre, killing 10 people and\nwounding \n75. A man was killed and five others seriously wounded in an explosion in \nNabatiye.\n---\n  An Israeli navy patrol boat attacked and sank a rubber guerrilla boat off\n\nsouthern Lebanon early today, killing the two men aboard, the army command \nsaid.\n  \n     It said in a communique that a Dvora patrol boat opened fire on the \nmotorized rubber dinghy north of Tyre after identifying it as hostile. The\narmy \nsaid no one on the Israeli boat was injured. The affiliation of the slain \nguerrillas was not immediately known.\n---\n  Rival factions of the guerrilla group led by terrorist mastermind Abu\nNidal \nbattled Sunday in Tyre, Lebanon, with machine guns and rocket-propelled \ngrenades, killing at least four people and wounding 15, police said.\n---\n Lebanon's mainstream Shiite Muslim militia said Thursday that it had \nuncovered a network of tunnels in a southern Lebanese village where it said\npro-\nIranian kidnappers had held Western hostages.\n  \n     Officials of the militia, Amal, led local journalists through the\ncatacomb-\nlike alleys and showed them two cells with iron doors at the village, \nKawthariyet al Siyad, near Tyre, the ancient port city, about 40 miles\nsouth of \nBeirut.\n  \n     The officials said they were certain that U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William\nR. \nHiggins was detained there shortly after he was seized by gunmen on a road \noutside Tyre in February 1988.\n--------------\n...anyway, I counted 20 articles during these 3 years of reporting. I also\nfound out the possible reason why the numbers for the inhabitants of the\ncity is defined between 14000 and 24000. It seems that Tyre is one of the\nplaces\nwhere people from Libanon flee to during more extensive bombings, so\nthere's\na constant flow of refugees entering and leaving Tyre (articles mentioned\nthousands of people entering and leaving this place).\n\nI counted 0 articles for my home town, Kristinestad, so from now I will\nconsider this place to be a fishing village :-).\n\nCheers,\nKent
I think that you are changing the meaning of "values" here. Perhaps\nit is time to backtrack and take a look at the word.\n\nvalue n. 1. A fair equivalent or return for something, such as goods\nor service. 2. Monetary or material worth. 3. Worth as measured in \nusefulness or importance; merit. 4. A principle, standard, or quality\nconsidered inherently worthwhile or desirable. 5. Precise meaning, as\nof a word. 6. An assigned or calculated numerical quantity. 7. Mus. \nThe relative duratation of a tone or rest. 8. The relative darkness or\nlightness of a color. 9. The distinctive quality of a speech or speech\nsound. \n\nIn context of a moral system, definition four seems to fit best. In terms\nof scientific usage, definitions six or eight might apply. Note that\nthese definitions do not mean the same thing.\n\nIn my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a\nreach. Science has its basis in observable fact. Even the usages of the\nword "value" above do not denote observable fact, but rather a standard\nof measurement. I would conclude that science does not have its\nbasis in values, and so your statement above fails. In fact, if one\nconcludes that a scientific set of measurements (values) are based on\nsystems derived from observation, then it must follow that in a\nscientific context, there is no such thing as there is no such thing as\n"objective values."\n\nBack to the present. This has nothing to do with a moral system anyhow.\nJust because the word "values" is used in both contexts does not mean\nthat there is a relationship between the two contexts.\n\nIf one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must\nfirst start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering\nthe meaning of the word "objective" I doubt that this will ever happen.\n\nSo, back to the original question:\n\nAnd objective morality is.....?\n\nIf you can provide an objective foundation for "morality" then that will\nbe a good beginning.

:\n (lots of stuff about the Nicene Creed deleted which can be read in the\n  original basenote.  I will also leave it up to other LDS netters to\n  take Mr. Weiss to task on using Mormon Doctrine to declare the difinitive\n  word on what the LDS Church teaches as doctrine.  Hopefully the LDS \n  netters will be amiable in their explanation.)\n\nSince it would do no good to rebut what Mr. Weiss has stated on the origin\nof the Nicene Creed and its status as devine and inspired (I say "no good"\nbecause it cannot be proved through discussion or debate as to whether or not \nthe authors of the Creed were inspired), I leave you (it will be some time \nbefore I post again) with the following thought authored by Eugene England, \nProfessor of English at Brigham Young University.  Mr. England wrote the \nfollowing as part of a book review section in This People's magazine (Spring \n1993 edition):\n\n  "I conclude with a little sermon because I believe we will not be a Mormon--\n  or human--family until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other \n  with terms like feminist or patriarchal, liberal or conservative (Christian \n  or non-Christian -- Hal 8^).  When we are tempted to draw a circle around\n  a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it American, then exclude\n  those who don't fit, it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central\n  defining characteristic of a good American might be "one who doesn't draw\n  exclusive circles" -- that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the \n  central American ideal is by excluding others.  And when we are tempted to\n  draw a circle around "Mormon" or "Christian," to decide who is "orthodox"\n  and who isn't by how much they agree with us, it might be well to consider\n  that the central pillar of Christ's "orthodoxy" is our ability to love\n  unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family.\n\n  "I recently spent some time in a "Christian" bookstore in California. The\n  service was excellent, the clerks and customers all smiling, neat, and\n  well-scrubbed, and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural\n  commentaries, sentimental fiction, and collections of evangelistic sermons.\n  But I was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking \n  others, often viciously---whether the political left, our modern American\n  culture, or other religions.  A whole section was devoted to "Cults and the\n  Occult," and as you might expect, Mormonism was right there under the same\n  rubric and indictment (often by the same authors) as Satanism.  And I found\n  I could either rent or buy (in English or Spanish) copies of The God Makers\n  (that absurdly inaccurate, even libelous, but very popular and dangerous\n  anti-Mormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations\n  of the Nazi films that scapegoated Jews in the 1930s).\n\n  "It seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to\n  Christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety ("Perfect\n  love casteth out fear," I John 4:18).  I have always been pleased that the\n  LDS Church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths, though I find a \n  disheartening increase in willingness of individual Mormons to engage in the\n  same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoating---and even threats of coercive\n  action---as the "religious right wing" has launched this year against the\n  political left and American cultural and religious styles they don't like.\n  It is a fearful irony that in so doing Mormons take common cause with the\n  very people who have most slanderously attacked Mormons---people who would,\n  if they had power, forcefully restrict Mormons' rights along with those of\n  others they believe to be evil."\n\n\nThe above "sermon" was addressed to the LDS audience who usually subscribe\nto This People's magazine, but would certainly apply to all of us who\nrely on the mercies and grace of Jesus Christ to bring us back into His\narms.  \n\nEven though the LDS Church claims devine authority to exercise the principles \nof the restored gospel---as in the days of Christ, the Church does not claim \nperfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do \nnow lead the Church.  I, for one, do not wish to be labelled "Christian", if \nthose who profess themselves as Christians attack my beliefs because they are \nintollerent (for example) of the way my religion may interpret Biblical \nscriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication \nthan mainstream Christianity would give it.  Once again, being in the \nmajority does NOT in and of itself PROVE anything except that your collective \nvoice is louder.  That's really all the critics of the LDS Church have to stand\non in terms of the kind of Biblical interpretation used as proof to counter \nthe LDS Church' interpretation!  Using someone elses biased research of truths \nand non-truths (whose to say what the mixture is?) as an authoritative tool to \ndisprove or discredit is not being fair to anyone, least of all themselves. \nLet us simply agree to disagree, and share beliefs through adult discussion \nand conversation, thereby uplifting everyone.
Who said Christians want to conform to the teachings of Jesus?
How do you know? Were you there?\n\nWhile obviously Koresh was a nut case, the (typical) inability of the\ngovernment/media to get its story straight is quite disturbing. On\ntuesday night, NBC news reported that the FBI did not know the place\nwas burning down until they saw black smoke billowing from the\nbuilding. The next day, FBI agents were insisting that they saw Davidians\nsetting the fire. The FBI was also adamantly denying that it was possible\ntheir battery of the compound's wallks could have accidentally set the\nblaze, while also saying they hadnt been able to do much investigating\nof the site because it was still too hot. So how did they KNOW they\ndidnt accidentally set the fire.\n\nSounds like the FBI just burned the place to the ground to destroy\nevidence to me.
Well, there are two approaches we can take here.  One is to ask you what this\nobjective morality is, assuming it's not a secret.\n\nThe other is to ask you what you think is wrong with relativism, so that we\ncan correct your misconceptions :-)

I hope I didn't award custody, Rich.  I purposely used "handle" in order to \navoid doing so - i.e., that happens to be what religions do (of course there are\naberrations like "scientific" creationism).  I used "best" in part to indicate \nthat science currently has a time of it with why and who, so these domains are\nmostly ignored.  I also attempted to be brief, which no doubt confused the\nmatter.  As an aside, for science I should have written "how and when".  Nobody\nseems to argue over what.\n\n\nSeems to me that the answer would vary from individual to individual.  I'm not\ntrying to be evasive on this, but from a societal perspective, religion works.\nOn the other hand, sometimes it is abused and misused, and many suffer, which\nyou know.  But the net result seems positive, this from the anthropological\nperspective on human affairs.  You might call me a neo-Fruedian insofar as I \nthink the masses can't get along without religion.  Not that generally they are \nincapable; they just don't, and for myriad reasons, but the main one seems to \nbe the promise of immortality.  Very seductive, that immortality.  Therefore \nit seems that theologians are better equipped than the others you mention for \ndispensing answers to "who and why".  I suggest that this holds regardless of \nthe "truth" in their answers to who and why simply because people believe.  \nIn the end, spiritual beliefs are just as "real" as scientific facts and \nexplanation (CAUTION TO SOME: DO NOT TAKE THIS OUT OF CONTEXT).  \n\n\nNo.  In fact, I don't think it is closed now, at least for some individuals. \nIsn't there a group of theoretical physicists who argue that matter was \ncreated from nothing in a Big Bang singularity?  This approach might \npresuppose an absence of who and why, except that it seems it could be argued \nthat something had to be responsible for nothing?  Maybe that something doesn't\nhave to be supernatural, maybe just mechanistic.  But that's a tough one for\npeople today to grasp.  In any case, theory without empirical data is not \nexplanation, but then your question does not require data.  In other words, \nI agree that theorizing (within scientific parameters) is just as scientific \nas explaining.  So the answer is, who and why are not closed to scientists, but \nI sense that science in these realms is currently very inadequate.  Data will \nbe necessary for improvement, and that seems a long way off, if ever.  Pretty \nconvoluted here; I hope I've made sense.  \n\n\nI agree generally.  But I prefer to put it this way - the *questions* of how, \nwhen, who and why were not open to inquiry.  During the Enlightenment, \nreason was reponsible for questioning the theological answers to how and when, \nand not, for the most part, who and why.  Science was thus born out of the \nnaturalists' curiosity, eventually carting away the how and when while largely \nleaving behind the who and why.  The ignorant, the selfish, the intolerant, and\nthe arrogant, of course, still claim authority in all four domains.\n\n\n\nMuch obliged.  Funny how facts tend to muddle things, isn't it?  Well, I am\nsure there are plenty of "scientific" creationist "rebuttals" out there \nsomewhere, even if they have to be created from nothing.\n\n[just for the record, again, AMH = anatomically modern humans] \n\nBest regards :-),
I'm having trouble receiving News at the moment due to an overloaded\nNews server. I think that I can post out reasonably quickly, though.\n\nI'm in a couple of threads at the moment which may be pending replies.\nIf anyone wants a reply from me over something I've posted then I\nsuggest sending an e-mail copy of the point to me so that I can reply by\nNews.\n\nThis is one way to shut me up!!\n\nCheers,\n\nDavid.\n\n---\nOn religion:
[ a lot of religious opinions and quotations from the Bible and from \nmany Catholic theologians and Papal Bulls ]\n\n[ which, although introduced with a smiley, was not as funny as it\nmight have been (notable exception: subject headers such as "ONE'S \nDICK IS ONE'S INSTRUMENT OF REDEMPTION." ]\n\n[ and indeed, the posting seemed to be more a vehicle for the\nreligious text than for any "literary/moral analysis" ]\n\nI am surprised and saddened. I would expect this kind of behavior\nfrom the Evangelical Born-Again Gospel-Thumping In-Your-Face We're-\nThe-Only-True-Christian Protestants, but I have always thought \nthat Catholics behaved better than this.\n\nFriend Dennis, I urge you to follow the example of your fellow\nCatholics, of who I count many dozens as my friends, and practice\nyour faith through good example and decent living and respect\nfor the common humanity of others. Please do not stoop to the\nlevel of the E B-A G-T I-Y-F W-T-O-T-C Protestants, who think\nthat the best way to witness is to be strident, intrusive, loud,\ninsulting and overbearingly self-righteous.\n\nThe imagery in the Song of Solomon is a little bit dated (get it? \nMiddle East - date palms - oh, never mind) but apparently acceptable, \non a steaminess level, to be accepted as part of the canon. From\nthis fact I derive that erotica itself is not incompatible with\nCatholic doctrine.\n\nIs there such a thing as Catholic erotica? Not necessarily a love\nstory between people of that faith, but a love story that is not\nexploitative, does not seek redemption through penis size, pays\nproper respect to the dignity of each partner, and is still erotic\nenough to have a place on a.s.s.\n\nI would submit that the _Darknites_ series of stories qualify, also\nmost of the _Journal Entries_, and _Rings I and II_.\n\nI would guess that your aim is to cut down on the pornography and\nincrease the erotica. I actually agree with you that nearly all of\nthe "I've got an enormous dick, and I shot my wad all over her face"\nstories are crap. I count them as noise, which makes my take on the\nsignal-to-noise ration much lower than many other people's.\n\nSince you are one of the few posters here who can actually write \ndecent prose, could you write a few stories for us instead of\noverwhelming us with commentary?  \n\n-- \nThank you.
I told some friends of mine two weeks ago that Koresh was dead.  The FBI and\nthe BATF could not let a man like that live.  He was a testimonial to their\nstupidity and lies.    \n\nNow before everyone gets crazy with me, let me say that Koresh was crazy as \na bed bug, but out government was crazier...and they lied to us.\n\nThey told us compound had been under survaillance for quite some time.  Yet, \nwhoever was watching the place failed to see that Koresh went jogging and into\ntown on a regular basis.  Everyone in the area claimed to have seen him and \nwondered why they didn't pick him up then.  There are two possible answers.\nFirst, they didn't see him.  What kind of survaillance is that?  Second, they\ndidn't care.  They wanted a confrontation.  They wanted publicity and they got\nit.\n\nAfter the first battle, they told us that they did not know he knew they were\ncoming.  They also said it would have been foolish to go in knowing that.\nWell, we know now that they intercepted the informants call and went in anyway.\n\nDid they explore all of the possibilities for ending the seige?  According to\nthem they did, but according to the Hartford Courant, the woman that raised\nKoresh (His Grandmother) was not allowed to go in and see him.                 \n The FBI agent who she spoke with was Bob Ricks and according to the paper he\n\n"A lot of people think if you just talk to them logically they will come out.\nHis grandmother raised Vernon Howell; (Koresh's Real name)  she didn't raise\nDavid Koresh."\n\nSomeone who raises you and loves you does not speak to you strickly on a\nlogical level.  There is also an emotional level on which they can reach you.\n\nHere's another one.  All during this operation the FBI has been claiming that\nthey feared a mass suicide and that is one of the reasons that something must\nbe done.  Now they claim they never thought he would do it?\n\nI knew they were going to do something when they started talking about how\nmuch money this was costing.  That was the start of the "Justification" part\npart of the plan.  That's when I knew it would come soon.\n\nBut, back to the plan.  It is considered "Cruel and Unusal Punishment" to\nexecute criminals in the minds of many people, but look at what's acceptable.\n\nThey knew the parents (adults) had gas masks.  They did not know, or were not\nsure, if the children had them.  So the plan was to pour the gas into the \ncompound.  The mothers, seeing what the gas was doing to their children were\nsupposed to run out and that would only leave the men to deal with.\n\nI spent two years in the army and like everyother veteran I went through CBR\n(Chemical, Biological Radiological) warfare training.  Part of that training\nis going into a room filled with the same stuff that the children were\nsubjected to.  To make the stuff really interesting the gas also has a chemical \nagent that irritates the skin.  You think its on fire.\n\nI have no doubts the children would become hysterical.  Its not the kind of\nthing you never want to do again.  This was the plan, the final solution.\n\nWe waited 444 days for our hostages to come home from Iran.  We gave these\npeople 51 days.  \n\nI stated on several occasions that there was absolutely nothing in this whole\nthing that the government could point to as a success.  Well, FBI agent Ricks\nchanged my mind.  Again a newclip from the Hartford Courant:\n\n"And while expressing regret at the loss of life, he suggested that the\noperation had been at least a modified success because not a single federal\nshot had been fired and not a single federal agent had been hurt."\n\nIt took 17 dead children to get us that new definition of success.\n\nOne more thought.  The government claimed that they believed he had automatic\nweapons on the premises. \n                                                      \n        HE HAD A LICENSE FOR THE 50 CALIBER MACHINE GUN!\n\nTHEY KNEW DAMN WELL HE HAD ONE. THEY ALSO KNEW HE HAD IT LEGALLY!\n\nStill, without the element of surprise they sent in agents to get him.\nFor all of this my President takes full responsibility.  What a guy!\nI hope he gets it.
Your last remark is a contradiction, but I'll let that pass.\n\nI was addressing the notion of the Great Commission, which\nyou deleted in order to provide us with dull little homilies.\nThank you, Bing Crosby.  Now you go right on back to sleep\nand mommy and daddy will tuck you in later.\n\nOh, and how convenient his bible must have been to Michael\nGriffin, how convenient his Christianity.  "Well, I'll just\nskip the bit about not murdering people and loving the sinner\nand hating the sin and all that other stuff for now and\nconcentrate on the part where it says that if someone is doing\nsomething wrong, you should shoot him in the back several times\nas he tries to hobble away on his crutches."\n\nI'll leave the "convert or die" program of the missionaries and\ntheir military escorts in the Americas for Nadja to explain as\nshe knows much more about it than I.\n\nMust be awfully convenient, by the way, to offer platitudes\nas you have done, David, rather than addressing the arguments.
(hudson)\n(me)\n\n/(hudson)\n/So. Why is someone elses will such a big deal if morality is all relative.\n\n\nI don't believe I ever said that morality was all relative.\n\nWhat I said was that I can make my mind up on my own, thank you, and that \nyou don't have the right to tell others what to think.\n\nI think that you will find that in most moral systems, there is \na respect for human life and the dignity of the person.  It is all the\nstuff besides these points that forms the core of the disagreement between \nprimitive moral absolutists like yourself and the rest of us.\n\n\n\n/(hudson)\n/Maybe (the insane lover of pain might reason) if other people experienced\n/enough pain, they might learn to enjoy it, too.  \n\nFine.  There is still the clinical definition of crazy.  And this also\ninvolves a violation of free will, because the insane lover of your\nlittle example would be inflicting pain on a non-willing subject.\n\nTry again.\n\n\n\n\n(hudson)\n(me)\n\n/(hudson)\n/You have to have some sort of premise about choice or self-awareness.\n\n\nNo, you do not.  I demonstrated to you the example of the football\nteam which doesn't require premises about freedom of choice or \nsentience/self-awareness.
The observation that the Tree of Life would rotate clockwise in the\nnorthern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the southern probably doesn't\ngive enough consideration to the feebleness of the Coriolis force compared\nto, say, the phototropism of vegetation.  A much more likely explanation\nis the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, because\nthe sun progresses across the sky that way.  (Although that's not the\nhistorical way it happened; clocks were first made as little imitation\nimages of the sun moving thru the heavens.  So it's more valid to talk of\nthe clock going sunwise, but do the engineers listen to me?  Of course\nnot.)  Anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether the\nanti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents Evil, or\nbecause it is the Sun's twin-opposite, the Moonwheel.  The use of anti-Sun\nto represent Evil may be because humans are so strongly visually-oriented,\nbut I'm not going to try to settle THAT one just now.\n-- Diccon Frankborn (dickeney@access.digex.com)

Almost one third of the world's population claim to be Christian.  But\nany similarity between their beliefs and lifestyle to the first century\nmodel is purely coincidental.  At Luke 18:8 it states, "...nevertheless,\nwhen the son of man returns, will he really find the faith on the earth?"

I agree, which is why I've asked for help with it.\n\nThe reason I'm working on this list is because I've recently had one\ntoo many Christians tell me "the Bible contains no contradictions\nwhatsoever."  They believe that it's true, and that it describes\nreality perfectly, and even predicts history before it happens.\n\nBefore I can carry on any sort of meaningful conversation with these\npeople, I've got to SHOW them, with concrete evidence, that the Bible\nis not nearly as airtight as they thought.  I hope to do that with\nthis list.\n\nSpecifically: when I bring up the fact that Genesis contains two\ncontradictory creation stories, I usually get blank stares or flat\ndenials.  I've never had a fundamentalist acknowledge that there are\nindeed two different accounts of creation.

You might be sure, but you would also be wrong.
The primary problem in human nature is a "fragmentation of being."\nHumans are in a state of tension, a tension of opposites. Good and\nevil are the most thought provoking polarities that come to mind.\n\nThe Bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation of\nbeing. The warring opposites within us are a product of man's\nrebellion against God, which is described so vividly in the pages of\nthe Scriptures.\n\nMan was created with the order to become a god. Those were the words\nof St.  Basil in the fourth century. What he was trying to say was\nthat God created man to be a partaker of the divine nature. In the\nEastern Orthodox Church, this is called "theosis," or "deification."\n\nOne can also say that man was created to be whole, i.e. spirit, soul,\nand body operating in unison. The story of Adam and Eve is a picture\nof the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness. Theirs\nwas a harmonious relationship with each other, the world, and the\nCreator. That innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed God,\ntheir natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly\nirreconcilable halves. Immediately, guilt and fear was manifested in\ntheir lives. They become bound to hardship, toil, and suffering.  This\nis symbolized in their exile from the paradisiac state.\n\nThe beast in the jungle does not possess moral consciousness. If it\nwere to receive this self-awareness, the knowledge of good and evil,\nits paradisiac state would also be destroyed.\n\nWas it the intention of the Creator to leave man in this state of\ninnocence all the days of his existence on earth? Or was the gaining\nof self-awareness carefully staged by God, who did not desire that His\nmasterpiece, mankind, be a blissful idiot?\n\nGod must have known that, for mankind to achieve any kind of moral\nvalue, he must pass through a confrontation with the opposites. There\nis no other way to achieve union with God.\n\nJesus Christ is the answer to the problem of the warring polarities.\nHe was the perfectly integrated individual, reconciling the opposites,\nand making it possible for us to be integrated, i.e. to become God,\nnot in His essence, but in His energies.\n\nThe opposites is THE Christian problem. The Apostle Paul describes it\nwith the utmost precision in Romans 7:15-24. And he follows with the\nanswer to his dilemma in vs 25.
Isn't that interesting?!  In the Jewish tradition you are incredibly\nwrong!  They originate in the Torah and with Jewish ancestors,\nspecifically the Patriarch Abraham (z"l).  That knowledge was sent East\nto India and China when Abraham gave "gifts" (the commentators to Jewish\nscripture say this was the knowledge of the occult arts) to all the rest\nof his children when he sent them away to the East.  This assured that\nIsaac only, who remained with Abraham, would inherit his most important\nspiritual gifts, what eventually became Judaism.\n\nSo you see, other religions can have very parochial views too.  By the\nJewish view, you are very mistaken, your scripture are not scripture,\nyour gods are not gods, your practices a jumble of errors that lead\npeople to idol worship and away from God.  That doesn't stop us from\nrespecting you to the extent of not trying to convert you or proselytize\nyou and being willing to dialog in a respectful manner.  We're content\nto let you live the way you care to live as long as you leave us be.  We\nare happy to co-exist as long as you give us the same right.\n\nBut your incredible rudeness and violent nature seems to preclude that.\nToo bad.  Is this typical of your religion?\n\n\nYou are a most presumptuous fellow!  How dare you presume that the\n"typical" New Ager doesn't acknowledge God and is selfish.  What trite,\nself-righteous, ego-ful garbage!  There are Buddhists, Christians, Jews,\nand those of many other religions here on this newsgroups for whom your\nwords are simple slander.\n\n\nOf course, from the Jewish perspective you are incredibly wrong.  We'd\nsay that there is no "godhead" -- just created beings who may be\nenjoying a good laugh at your expense.\n\n\nSo not only are we selfish, we are also thieves and liars!  And you\nexpect any of us to pay attention to you and your "religion?"  Why not\ncall us more name?   Maybe then we'll all convert in gratefullness!\n\n\nYou delude yourself.
Hello.\n\n\nI just read my first newspaper in a while and noticed an article on a\n'messianic cult' leader named 'David Koresh'.\n\nI'd like to know more about this and what is going on with them.\n\nPlease email me as I don't normally read this newsgroup.  Thanks.
No, and Im especially unhappy that these 70+ people died in an assault\non private property with government armored vehicles.\n\nI am also unhappy (or actually, very suspicious) that the FBI was dismissing\nout of hand any chances that they might have accidentally set the blaze \nthemselves. I mean, I guess we are just supposed to believe that\nramming modified tanks into the walls of a building and injecting\ntoxic gases into the building are just routine procedures, no WAY\nanything could go wrong.
As a matter of fact, yes I do or at least I strive to.  I will not\nbe so proud as to boast that my faith is 100%.  I am still human\nand imperfect and therefore, liable to sin.  Thankfully, there is\nopportunity for repentence and forgiveness.\n\nGod be with you,

Satan and his followers have\nrebelled against God, and are not "children (=followers/redeemed) of God,"\nbut it doesn't mean that they were not once created by God, but chose to\nseparate themselves from those who chose to follow God and His plan of\nsalvation.\n\n#\n#        The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the\n#        kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked "one";\n#        (Matthew 13:38)\n\nkingdom are those who have remained valiant in their testimony of Jesus\n(and have shown "works of repentance, etc.), and the children of the\nwicked one are those who rebelled against God and the lamb.  The issue\nof satan's spirit-offspring (and those who followed him) has not been\naddressed in this and other verses you copied from your Bible.  You\npurposefully obscured the subject by swamping your "right" with non-\nrelated scriptures.\n\n(...lots of nice scriptures deleted (NOT Robert W. copyrighted) though...)\n\n#ra> > We are told that, "And this is life eternal, that they might know\n#ra> > thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent."\n#ra> > (John 17:3).

First get your lds-facts straight before you dare preaching to us\nabout "the only true God," whom you interpret according to your own likes\nand dislikes, but whose image I cannot reconcile with what I know about\nHim myself.  I guess your grandiose self-image does not allow for other\nfaiths, believing in the divinity of Jesus Christ, but in a different\nway or fashion than your own.  Not that it really matters, the mission\nand progress of the lds church will go on, boldly and nobly, and no mob\nor opponent can stop the work from progressing, until it has visited\nevery continent, swept every clime, and sounded in every ear.\n\n#  This is really a red herring. It doesn't address any issue raised, but\n#  rather, it seeks to obfuscate. The fact that some groups try to read\n#  something into the Bible, doesn't change what the Bible teaches.\n\nSigh.  "What the Bible teaches"?  Or: "what the bible teaches according to\nRobert Weiss and co.?"  I respect the former, I reject the latter without\nthe remotest feeling that I have rejected Jesus.  On the contrary.  And by\nthe way, I do respect your interpretations of the Bible, I even grant you\nbeing a Christian (following your own image of Him), as much as I am a\nChristian (following my own image of Him in my heart).\n\n(...)\n\n#  Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of\n#  Bruce McConkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine.' I don't\n#  think that it matters if McConkie's views were canon. That is not the\n#  issue.  Were McConkie's writings indicative of Mormon belief on this\n#  subject is the real issue. The indication from Rick is that they may\n#  certainly be.\n\nThe issue is, of course, that you love to use anything to either mis-\nrepresent or ridicule the lds church.  The issue of "official doctrine"\nis obviously very important.  McConkie's views have been controversial\n(e.g. "The Seven Deadly Heresies" has made me a heretic!  ;-) at best,\nor erroneous at worst ("blacks not to receive the priesthood in this\ndispensation").  I respect him as someone who has made his valuable\ncontribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personal\ninterpretations (his book "Mormon Doctrine" is oftentimes referred to\nas "McConkie's Bible" in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  I rather\nlook to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley's books!\n(The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkie\nwas a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of\nGod than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted\ndoctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and\nspeculation.  But having said this, I find McConkie (even in his most\nbiased and speculative moments) far more thought-provoking than the\ntrash coming from your proverbial pen.

Yes, that's true, but you have to be clear exactly what is\nan uninterpreted observation. It's pretty low level stuff.\n'The sun shines' is already a LOT higher level than that. We\ncan agree that 'I perceive brightness' perhaps.\n\nHuh? What do you mean 'all in the same situation?' Let's take me\nand Dennis Kriz as examples. We're in pretty different situations,\nbut I think we can agree as to whether it's day or night. I don't\nthink we can agree as to whether or not abortion is morally\nacceptable. Yet we are certainly in the same difference of\nsituations with respect to each other. Looks like weasel-words\nto me, Frank. \n\nThat's up to you, I guess.\n\nThis 'different situations' stuff is pretty confusing, Frank. How\ndo we decide if we are in the same situation? You mind explaining?\n\nHuh? I don't think so. I think that people disagree about\nfundamental goals.\n\n-Ekr
The trouble with trying to find out the truth is that Roehm and his\nbuddies were ACCUSED OF being flaming faggots, one of the pretexts for the\nNight of Long Knives in which Roehm and most of the SA wing of the NSDAP\nwere purged.  Since the accusers thereafter controlled the records,\nanything bearing on the subject -- true or not -- has to be considered\ntainted evidence.  The available data suggest that Roehm and his crowd,\nthe SA -- Sturmabteilung, "Storm Troopers" -- left the world a better\nplace when they departed, but concrete particulars are still no more than\nmore or less shrewd guesses.  \n-- Diccon Frankborn

/(hudson)\n/If someone inflicts pain on themselves, whether they enjoy it or not, they\n/are hurting themselves.  They may be permanently damaging their body.\n\nThat is true.  It is also none of your business.  \n\nSome people may also reason that by reading the bible and being a Xtian\nyou are permanently damaging your brain.  By your logic, it would be OK\nfor them to come into your home, take away your bible, and send you off\nto "re-education camps" to save your mind from ruin.  Are you ready for\nthat?  \n\n\n\n\n\n/(hudson)\n/And why is there nothing wrong with it?  Because you say so?  Who gave you\n/the authority to say that, and set the standard for morality?\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause: \nI am a living, thinking person able to make choices for myself.\nI do not "need" you to show me what you think is the way; I have observed\ntoo many errors in your thinking already to trust you to make up the\nrules for me.\n\nBecause:\nI set the standard for my *own* morality, and I permit you to do \nthe same for yourself.  I also do not try to force you to accept my rules.\n\nBecause:\nSimply because you don't like what other people are doing doesn't give you\nthe right to stop it, Hudson.  We are all aware that you would like for \neveryone to be like you.  However, it is obnoxious, arrogant thinking like \nyours, the "I-know-I'm-morally-right-so-I-can-force-it-on-you" bullshit \nthat has brought us religious wars, pogroms against Jews, gay-bashing,\nand other atrocities by other people who, like you, "knew" they were\nmorally right.\n\n\n\n\n\n(me)\n\n/(hudson)\n/Aren't you?  Aren't you indicating that I should not tell other people what\nto do?  Aren't you telling me it is wrong for me to do that? \n\nIt is not a moral standard that I am presenting you with, Hudson.  It is\na key to getting along in life with other people.  It is also a point of\nrespect:  I trust other people to be intelligent enough to make their\nown choices, and I expect the same to be returned.  You, on the other\nhand, do not trust them, and want to make the choice for them--whether\nthey like it or not.\n\nIt is also a way to avoid an inconsistency:  if you believe that you have \nthe right to set moral standards for others and interfere in their lives, \nthen you must, by logic, admit that other people have the same right of \ninterference in your life.  \n(Yes, I know; you will say that your religion is correct and tells you that\nonly agents acting in behalf of your religion have the right of interference.\nHowever, other people will say that you have misinterpreted the Word of\nGod and that *they* are the actual true believers, and that you are\nacting on your own authority.  And so it goes).\n\n\n\n\n\n(hudson)\n/Who gave\n/you the authority to set such a moral standard for me to tell me that I \n/cannot set a moral standard for others?\n\n\nYou can set all the standards that you want, actually.

In fact, it is the combination of the two\nstatements I was addressing, and not just the one, and for you to\ncharacterize that as "ignoring" the instruction to spread the\nword is a good example of what a dishonest little fellow you are."\n\nOf course, Matt 10:15 [quoted above] makes no mention of "instruction\nto spread the word."\n\nAll these quotes btw are from:\n\nMessage-ID: <1993Apr13.121624.3400@cbnewsj.cb.att.com>\n\n\nAnd I claim it correctly, because my question went:\n\n"Do you, too, measure\nthe goodness of a post by its entertainment value, and care not\na whit for such mundane things as truth and falsehood?"\n\nand the closest Dean came to an answer was:\n\n"Peter, Peter, Peter.  You're just so stupid, pretentious, dull,\nand generally unworthy of the value you place on yourself that\nthe sport is all there is."\n\nOf course, this does NOT answer my question, which has to do with posts\nin GENERAL and not my posts in particular.  Surely even Dean knows this,\nyet he brazenly asserts otherwise, reinforcing his claim with an insult:\n\n"So I now restore the answer to your question\nthat you deleted.  If you're still unable to figure it out, ask\na nice kid at the local junior high to help you.  It really\ndoesn't take much sophistication to understand."\n\nOn top of which, I doubt that the "answer" is at all representative\nof Dean's true frame of mind.  The insults you have seen quoted thus\nfar are but a small sample of the stream that oozes out of Dean's \nmind throughout the 284-line post from which these quotes were taken.\nOne wonders whether Dean's mind is so warped as to find sport in all\nthis.\n\nHe even dredges up a falsified account of\nevents that transpired earlier on another thread:\n\n"You made an ass of yourself by claiming that it\n				^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nwas in the tradition of Lent to make public announcements of\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nthe "sins" of other individuals."\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nFalse.  I said it was the tradition to recall and atone for one's sins.\nThat I made public announcements of the "sins" of others\n--"sins", BTW, that were a matter of public record, documented in\nthe posts of others-- is a different matter.\n\nMany of the individuals involved are so nearly amoral that\nthey do not see as sins what morally upright people see as sins, so\nI pointed some of them out.  And I expressly set up a whole thread,\nYOUR TURN, to let people point out MY sins to me.\n\nDean again:\n\n"You made an ass of yourself\nby saying that my statement of the tradition of tzedukkah was\nsomehow an attempt to "paint Jews as plaster saints," thereby\nrevealing your inability to understand the discussion as well\nas showing your dislike for people saying positive things\nabout Jews, and now you show your intellectual dishonesty by\nrepeatedly ignoring the simple argument being made, and then\nclaiming I am ignoring the very argument I acknowledge."\n\nActually, what happened was that Dean made it seem like ANY Jew\nwho gave alms or did other acts of charity in public was a hypocrite\naccording to Jewish customs.  In doing so, he was caricaturing\nJewish customs as being almost impossibly demanding, as well as\nimplicitly slandering all Jews who make public their acts of charity.\n\nI went very easily on Dean for this, giving him the benefit of\nthe doubt in a post following my initial crack about "plaster saints", \nsuggesting that he had been merely careless in his wording.\n\nIn an astonishing act of ingratitude, Dean now serves up an incredibly\ndistorted picture of what took place between us, and using it as\nthe basis of one insult after another.
The same way that any theory is proven false.  You examine the predicitions\nthat the theory makes, and try to observe them.  If you don't, or if you\nobserve things that the theory predicts wouldn't happen, then you have some \nevidence against the theory.  If the theory can't be modified to \nincorporate the new observations, then you say that it is false.\n\nFor example, people used to believe that the earth had been created\n10,000 years ago.  But, as evidence showed that predictions from this \ntheory were not true, it was abandoned.

However, I see no problem in Tony Rose's\nexplanation of Judas' death...\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\n \nHOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THE INACCURACY BETWEEN JUDAS HANGING\nHIMSELF IN MATTHEW 27:5 AND "FALLING HEADLONG HE BURST OPEN"\n=============================================================\n \nThis question of the manner in which Judas died is one with which we are\nconstantly confronted in our travels. Many people point to the apparent\ndiscrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious, irreconcilable error.\nSome have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant Bible is\ndestroyed by these contradictory accounts. However, this is not the case at\nall.\nMatthew relates that Judas hanged himself, while Peter tells us he fell and\nwas crushed by the impact. The two statements are indeed different, but do\nthey necessarily contradict each other?\nMatthew does not say that Judas did not fall; neither does Peter say that\nJudas did not hang himself. This is not a matter of one person calling\nsomething black and the other person calling it white. Both accounts can be\ntrue and supplementary.\nA possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the\nedge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there\nfor some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas\nfell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process.\nThe fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this\nexplanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the\nvalley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see\nrocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular.\nThere are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.\nTherefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on\nthis way down, tearing his body open. It is important to remember that we are\nnot told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced\nwas the decomposition of his body before his fall.\nLouis Gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself.\nThis individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed a\npistol at his head. He then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window at\nthe same time.\nOn the other hand, a person could say that this man took his life by shooting\nhimself, while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumping\nform the tall building. In this case, both are true, as both are true in the\ncase of Matthew's and Peter's accounts of the death of Judas. It is merely a\nsituation of different perspectives of the same event.\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\n \nYour only reason for rejecting this is, I believe, your attempt to discredit\ninerrancy.  You haven't related how this is IMPOSSIBLE or highly unlikely.\nHere's what you said in an earlier post...\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\nDB [quoting Tony Rose]...\n \n"The added text in this version is so heavy that, assuming you are truly so\nopposed to such tactics, you should find it not credible.  But you seem to\nfind Tony Rose's eisegesis satisfactory, while clearly rejecting David\nJoslin's."\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\n \nHere, you discredit Tony's explanation based on what you deem too "heavy" for\nthe passages.  But you haven't addressed why you feel that way.  You can say\nit's a vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction, but that doesn't tell me it\ndidn't happen, nor have you shown why you reject that possibility.\n \nQuestions:  Is Matthew lying or is Luke lying?  Or are they both lying?  Or\nare either or both of them misinformed?  Why do you think there is such an\nalleged contradiction?  I do not think you have ever told us what you believe\nin this respect.\n \nDB...\n"At present though, Mr DeCenso only asks two questions of me:\n \n \nActually I find question (1) to be a rather stupid request, but I will answer\nit because he now restricts himself to two points.  First I would point out\nthat hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life.  In fact it is a\nbit of a fluke when someone survives hanging (except in fantasy cowboy\nmovies), and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging."\n \nMY REPLY...\nI work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect.  Today, I got a\ncall re: a child that attempted suicide by hanging himself because his mother\nis on crack.  He failed in his attempt and is in a child's psych ward at a\nlocal hospital.  Hanging attempts are not always successful.\n \nTo assume that because most hangings are successful, this one was also is\n"begging the question", if I may quote you.\n \n[Last night, listening to _The Bible Answer Man_ broadcast, The Christian\nResearch Institute's show, one of the scholars on there used several of these\nterms that you use.  I am not all that familiar with them.  The man on the BAM\nshow teaches Comparative Religion and Logic.  It was interesting]\n \nDB...\n"This is so prevalent that, so that to say a man hung himself with no other\nqualifiers is synonymous with stating that he killed himself."\n \nMY REPLY...\nQualifiers are important at times, as we'll see in an OT passage I'll mention\nbelow.\nDoes hanging ALWAYS have this outcome?  Did Matthew, who is the only source we\nhave re: Judas hanging himself, state that Judas died as a result?  To say it's\nsynonymous means it has the same meaning as.  A boy (age 14) hung himself.  But\nhe lived.  This is only one of probably thousands of documented cases we can\ndiscover.\n \nDB...\n"Now I am not alone in this thought; in fact, since Mr DeCenso so respects\nChristian scholarly (including Greek scholars) opinion, I did some research."\n \nMY REPLY...\nThank you, Dave.\n \nDB...\n"Interestingly, not one of the Christian references I read, interpreted the\nhanging as being anything but a fatal suicide.              ^^^^^^^^^^^\n \nMY REPLY...\n[^^^ above, mine]\nSo it's OK to use Christian sources to back your points?  What about Tony's\nposition.  Do you value it or even consider it as a valid possibility?\n \nAlso, is it possible that the sources you read may be wrong, or lying, or\ndeceived in other parts of their books?  If so, should we do, as we have done\nwith Archer, toss them to the side and not value anything they say, including\ntheir "interpretation" of the hanging of Judas?  I am sure _you_ would find\nsome errors and maybe even some deception in those sources.\n \nYou also noted they "interpreted" the hanging as meaning he died.  Although\nthat is very possibly true, do you find that in the text itself?  Remember,\nthat's the first criteria we must examine.\n \nDB...\n"This included:\n \n    "The Biblical Knowledge Commentary" by Woodward and Zuck"\n \nMY REPLY...\nWhich I own.

But Matthew does not state death as being a result.\n \nThe Greek word is APAGCHO.  Matthew 27:5 is it's only occurrence in the New\nTestament.\n \nIn the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus),\nit's only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : "Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice was\nnot followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house, to his\ncity. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died; and he\nwas buried in his father's tomb."             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n \nNotice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel "hanged himself" [Gr. Sept.,\nAPAGCHO], but it explicitly adds, "and died".  Here we have no doubt of the\nresult.\nIn Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died.\n \nAlso, there is nothing in the Greek to suggest success or failure.  It simply\nmeans "hang oneself".\n \nDB...\n"But Mr DeCenso, you are more than welcome to disagree and show more reputable\n                                                                     ^^^^^^^^^\nChristian scholars that insist that the hanging was not successful."\n \nMY REPLY...\n[^^^above, mine]\n"Reputable"?  You mean ones that have never erred?\nAs far as   insisting that the hanging was unsuccessful, that can't be done,\neven by me. ^^^^^^^^^\n \nAs I said in an earlier post...\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\nAlthough I still agree with Tony's exegesis as being the most probable\nexplanation regarding Judas' death (taking into account several criteria),\nI've recently noticed some new things in Matthew.\n \nMAT 27:5-8 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed,\nand went and hanged himself. But the chief priests took the silver pieces and\nsaid, "It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the\nprice of blood." And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's\nfield, to bury strangers in. Therefore that field has been called the Field of\nBlood to this day.\n \nFirst of all, notice that the text does not say that Judas died as a result of\nhanging. All it says is that he "went and hanged himself." Luke however, in\nActs, tells us that "and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all\nhis entrails gushed out." This is a pretty clear indication (along with the\nother details given in Acts - Peter's speech, the need to pick a new apostle,\netc.) that at least after Judas' fall, he was dead. So the whole concept that\n                                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nMatthew and Luke both recount Judas' death is highly probable, but not clear\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\ncut.\n^^^\n_____________________________________________________________________\n \nI also wrote...\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\nMY REPLY...\n \nHere we have a stickler, Dave, that I have to say I just recently noticed.\nLet's look at the passage in Matthew:\n \nMAT 27:4 saying, "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood." And they said,\n"What is that to us? You see to it!"\n \nMAT 27:5 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed,\nand went and hanged himself.\n \nMAT 27:6 But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, "It is not\nlawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood."\n \nMAT 27:7 And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field,\nto bury strangers in.\n \nMAT 27:8 Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.\n \nNotice verse 5..."Then he...went and hanged himself."\nMatthew does not say Judas died, does it?  Should we assume he died as a\nresult of the hanging?                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nWhat does Acts say?\nACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and\nfalling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.\n \nACT 1:20 "For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place be\ndesolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.'\n \nHere we may have a graphic explanation of Judas' death....So, my line of\nreasoning to dispel your contradiction myth re:the "two" accounts of Judas'\ndeath is this...Matthew doesn't necessarily explain how Judas died; he does\n                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nsay Judas "hanged himself", but he didn't specifically say Judas died in the\nhanging incident.               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nHowever, Acts seems to show us his graphic demise.  Therefore, there is no\ncontradiction between Matthew and Acts re: Judas' `death'.\n \n.......\n \nMY REPLY...\n...we do know from Matthew that he did hang himself and Acts probably records\nhis death.  Although it's possible and plausible that he fell from the hanging\nand hit some rocks, thereby bursting open, I can no longer assume that to be\nthe case.  Therefore, no contradiction.  Matthew did not say Judas died as a\n                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nresult of the hanging, did he?  Most scholars believe he probably did, but...?\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n______________________________________________________________________\n \nI quoted all that to show that I highly regard the scholars' explanations, but\nin looking at the texts initially, we can't assume Judas died.  It is, however,\nhighly probable.                            ^^^^^^\n \nDB...\n"By the way, while all agree that Judas died from the hanging, the books had\ndifferent ways of dealing with the contradiction we are discussing.  One\nsimply ignored it entirely and simply referred back to Matthew's version as\nthe correct version in both Matt and Acts.  "The Biblical Knowledge Commentary"\nsuggested the hypotheses that Judas hung and then when he rotted, his belly\nexploded (which doesn't explain his headlong fall), or that his branch or rope\nbroke, and he fell to his death and his gut gushed out (which doesn't explain\nhow a hanging man, would fall headlong rather than feet first)."\n \nMY REPLY...\nThe outcome of any fall is dependent upon many factors...how high the person\nwas suspended before the fall, any obstructions such as tree branches that may\nhave deviated the fall, how steep an incline of rocky surfaces the victim fell\nupon, thus possibly rolling or bouncing of several rocks, etc.  In a\nsuperficial examination of the Acts passage and the Matthew passage, we are not\ngiven a lot of info on the geographical specifics, but Tony in the above quoted\npost gave us some...\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\nA possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the\nedge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there\nfor some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas\nfell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process.\nThe fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this\nexplanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the\nvalley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see\nrocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular.\nThere are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.\nTherefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on\nthis way down, tearing his body open.\n_____________________________________________________________________\n \nDB...\nNow truthfully, I do not see what is comforting about Matthew confusing the\nsource of the Potter's field prophesy, but on the other hand the author is\ncorrect: Matthew does make that confusion.  Of course a Biblical inerrantist\nwho claim that every word of the Bible is guaranteed true by God, will have to\nthereby add one more contradiction to the death of Judas (ie: where the\nprophesy of the Potter's field came from)."\n \nMY REPLY...\nPlease, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss\nthis with you.\n \nDB...\nAs to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that the\nmoney with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather\nthan some other source.  I would point out that in Acts, where it specifically\nmention "the reward of iniquity" [Acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions\nwhat act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16 "...concerning\nJudas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus.").  Now I would point out\nthat when the Bible describes an act of "iniquity," and then immediately\ndiscusses "*the* reward of iniquity," it would be rather inane to suggest that\nit was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed."\n \nMY REPLY...\nDave, we are getting somewhere, aren't we!\n \nACT 1:15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples\n(altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said,\nACT 1:16 "Men and brethren, this Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy\nSpirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide\nto those who arrested Jesus;\nACT 1:17 "for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry."\nACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and\nfalling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.\nACT 1:19 And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that field\nis called in their own language, Akel Dama, that is, Field of Blood.)\nACT 1:20 "For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place be\ndesolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.'\n \nNotice that in verse 16, the word "iniquity" is not used.  Rather, it states\nthat Judas "became a guide to those who arrested Jesus".\nBut the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, "for he was numbered with us and\nobtained a part in this ministry."  What part did Judas play in their ministry?\n         ^^^^^^\nJOH 12:6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a\nthief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it.\nJOH 13:29 For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus had\nsaid to him, "Buy those things we need for the feast," or that he should give\nsomething to the poor.\n \nSo, now we know what part Judas played - he was a treasurer, per se.\nRight after Peter stated that Judas played a part in this ministry (treasurer,\naccording to John), THEN Luke adds the parenthetical explanation of "wages of\niniquity" - money that should have been put into the ministry, but was stolen\nby Judas to purchase a field.  I believe this is a better exegetical\nexplanation of what the "wages of iniquity" are.  What do you think, Dave?\n \nDB...\n"Now since I have given you clear answers (and even references), perhaps you\ncould unequivocally state what type of inerrantist you are (instead of asking\nme what type I think you are, as you did to Mr Joslin)."\n \nMY REPLY...\nI will gladly admit that I am a Complete Inerrantist, although I do not have\nthat big a problem with the Limited Inerrancy view.\n\nFrank

Not to worry.  The Masons have been demonized and harrassed by almost \nevery major Xian church there is.  For centuries now.  And still they \nstand.  They wil withstand the miserable Southern Boobtists, I am sure.\nThey may even pick up a little support as people start to listen to the \nBoobtists and realize that subtracting the obvious lies and claims of \nSatanism that the Masons sound pretty good by comparison.  One thing is \nknown.  A sizable proportion of Southern Babtists are Masons!  And the \nMasons have already fired back in their own magazines against the \nBoobtist Witch-hunt.\n  Since the Consrervatives have already been a divisive element with \ntheir war on Boobtist moderates and liberals, they may now start in on \ntheir Mason/Boobtist brothers and hasten their own downfall as more and \nmore Southern Boobtists realize their church can't stand being run by a \nhandful of clowns looking for holy civil wars and purity tests and drop \n'em out of the leadership positions they have taken over.\n  So as far as I am concerned, the louder, ruder, and more outrageous \nan Anti-Masonic Crusade these old goats mount, the better.\n\nPop some pocorn and get a center row seat.  The circus is about to begin.\nAnd, Oh Look!  HERE COME THE CLOWNS!\n\n\nPope Charles    Slack!
: In my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a\n: reach. Science has its basis in observable fact. \n\nI'd say that what one chooses to observe and how the observation is\ninterpreted and what significance it's given depends a great deal on\nthe values of the observer. Science is a human activity and as such,\nis subject to the same potential for distortion as any other human\nactivity. The myth that scientists are above moral influence or\nethical concern, that their knowledge can be abstacted whole and pure\nfrom nature untainted by the biases of the scientist, is nonsense.\n\nBill\n\n: If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must\n: first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering\n: the meaning of the word "objective" I doubt that this will ever happen.\n\n: So, back to the original question:\n\n: And objective morality is.....?\n\nThis may be an unfortunate choice of words, almost self-contradictory.\nObjective in the sense used here means something immutable and\nabsolute while morality describes the behavior of some group of\npeople. The first term is all inclusive, the second is specific. The\nconcept supposedly described may have meaning however. \nIf there is a God as described by the Christians (for instance), then\nHe has existence apart from and independent of humankind; His\nexistence is outside of our frame of reference (reality). If this\nbeing declares a thing to be so, it is -necessarily- so since He has\ndefined Himself as omnipotent and, if His claims are to be believed,\nHe is at least omnipotent relative to us. God is intrinsically\nself-defined and all reality is whatever He says it is - in an\nobjective sense.\nIf God determines a standard of conduct, that standard is objective.\nIf human beings are held accountable for their conformance to that\nstandard while permitted to ignore it, they substitute a relative\nmorality or mode of conduct, giving the term morality a nebulous,\nmeaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending to\nmisunderstand. The standard is objective and the conduct required to\nmeet that standard is therefore objectively determined.\nJust because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality is\ninfinitely malleable, doesn't mean that the objective standard itself\ndoesn't exist. Morality has come to mean little more than a cultural\nnorm, or the preferred conduct of "decent" people, making it seem\nsubjective, but it is derived from an absolute, objective, standard.\nIronically, this objective standard is in perfect accord with our true\nnature (according to Christianity at least), yet is condemned as being\ncontrary to human nre, oppressive and severe. This may be due as

Looking at [1] we find that during Roman times "Tyre vied with Sidon\nfor first place in the intellectual life of the period"; that Tyre was\nthe seat of a Christian bishop, eventually with 14 dioceses under it;\nthat "the most magnificent church of its kind in all Phoenecia" was the\nbasilica built in Tyre ca. 314; that Tyre was well known for its\nexports of glassware, wine, white marble, and dyed cloth; that Tyre,\nalong with other seaports, "provided outlets for South Arabian, Indian\nand even Chinese trade"; that Tyre had to accomodate its growing\npopulation by "following a perpendicular, rather than horizontal, line\nof growth" (because it was running out of land to build on); that Tyre\nestablished colonies of its own.  None of this sounds like a "small\nfishing village" by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nCenturies later, under the Abbasids, Tyre had "opulent and flourishing\nbazaars" and buildings of 5-6 stories.  During this period, Tyre was\n"noted for its export of sugar, beads, and, as of old, glassware."\nDuring the Crusades, Tyre was the second-most flourishing city held\nby Franks.  (There is a lot more, but I got tired of writing.)\n\nIn [2] we read the following description of modern Lebanon: "other\n*major cities* in Lebanon include Tripoli, Sidon, Tyre, Baalbek and\nZahlah."  [my emphasis]  This source also discusses the impact of\nthe Lebanese Civil War, and the Israeli military actions (1978, 1982)\non the trading ports of Tyre and Sidon.  It notes that after Israel's\nwithdrawel in 1984, "Tyre appeared to enjoy a revival of its local\neconomy."\n\nIf Tyre is such an insignificant little fishing village at present,\nwhy is it always called a city (or, above, a "major city")?  Why\ndoes it show up on all the maps?   When population figures for cities\nin Lebanon are given, why is Tyre always one of the cities on the\nlist (even if the list is only a dozen cities long)?\n\n[1] Philip K. Hitti, _Lebanon in History: From the earliest times to\nthe present_, NY, St. Martins, 1967.  \n\n[2] Federal Research Division, Library of Congress, _Lebanon: a\ncountry study_, edited by Thomas Collelo, 1989.\n\n\nA one-horse town?  Sounds like a lot of work for one horse.\n(Anyway, Tyre is connected by roads to the mainland.  They\nmay even use cars these days. :-) \n\nThe 1991 Encyclopedia Britannica says "Pop. (1982 est.) 23,000."  \nMost other references give figures in the 14-17 thousand range.\n(One atlas gives the population of Tyre as 60,000; the same\nsource give comparatively high figures for Sidon and Beirut, also,\nso I doubt that it is a typo.  Perhaps these were figures for\nthe cities and their surrounding areas.)  I don't doubt that the\npopulation of Tyre has fluctuated over the last few decades.  In\nparticular, the 1982 Israeli military action hurt Tyre quite a bit.   \n\n\nI thought you were talking about times that Tyre was destroyed.\nDon't most, if not all, of these apply not just to Tyre but to \nthe other cities in the area?  Sidon, for example?  Can you make\na case for Tyre having been singled out?\n\n\nThey had a good deal of autonomy under the Seleucids. From [2]:\nTyre "receiv[ed] the rights [of autonomy] from Antiochus Ephiphanes\nand from 125 BC onward enjoy[ed] complete autonomy. She started a\nlarge series of coins, occasionally in gold ..."\n\nThe descriptions of Tyre under the Romans don't seem to fit\nyour characterization, either.  And under the Abbasids it seems\nto have been allowed to flourish.  I still think you are stretching\nwhen you try to describe Tyre as having been nothing but a small\nfishing village.\n\n\nA Christian apologist whose standards of scholarship are quite low.\nHe happens to quote the same source you quote (Nina Jidejian,\n_Tyre through the Ages_, Beirut, Dar El-Mashreq Publishers, 1969).\nThe same sentence, in fact.  He defends the fulfillment of the\nprophecy using the same argument you are using, an argument that\nI haven't seen in print anywhere else, which is why I jumped to\nthe conclusion that you were quoting Josh.\n\n(I tried to find the Jidejian book, but it isn't listed in Books\nin Print.  Can you tell me more about it? Her descriptions are so\nmuch at odds with everything else I've read; I'm curious to know why.)
ZOROASTRIANISM\nSAN JOSE, CA, USA\nMonday April 5, 1993\nSan Jose Mercury News, Page 1\n     [Reproduced without permission]\n\n_3,700-year tradition still glows - \n           'Assimilation in U.S. threatens ancient Zoroastrian religion'_\n\nBy Jeanne Huber, Mercury News Staff Writer\n\n   HIGH ON A HILLSIDE above San Jose, flames leap up 24 hours a day from a\ngleaming brass urn in a temple - one of only four in the United States -\ndedicated to one of the world's most ancient religions.\n\n   With the flames go the prayers of about 1,200 Bay Area Zoroastrians that\ntheir faith will survive this land.\n\n   "There is a fear - a real fear, too," said Silloo Tarapore of Lafayette.\n"We have one generation to do it or to die."\n\n   Many immigrant groups struggle to maintain an identity in a strange land.\nBut for Zoroastrians, it is an especially poignant concern.\n\n   Their religion has been around for perhaps 3,700 years, a heritage so deep\nit scarcely seems comprehensible in a state where "historical sites" are\nsometimes less than 100 years old.  It was the religion of the great Persian\nEmpire under kings Cyrus and Darius.  And tradition says that when Christ\nwas born about 500 years later, he was honored by a visit from three\nZoroastrian priests, the Magi.  Scholars say many key beliefs of Christians,\nJews and Muslims can be traced to the teachings of Zoroaster, the\nZoroastrian prophet.\n\n   Yet, with only about 150,000 Zoroastrians in the entire world, they are \na miniscule minority in every country in which they live.  Survival as a\npeople is very much on their minds.\n\n   Ironically, local Zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited tolerance\nof the United States may do what hundreds of years of persecution followed\nby nearly 1,000 years of benign religious segregation could not do: cause\ntheir young people to stop thinking of themselves as Zoroastrians.\n\n   Zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion, and they\nactually shun the notion of trying to win converts.  So if their children\nbecome totally assimilated, they say, it's their children - rather than\nthe world at large - who will be the losers.\n\n   "It's important to have an identity," said Maneck Bhujwaia of San Jose,\na leader among Zoroastrians who came here from India.  "It's important\nfor everybody - Irish, Scottish, Americans.  It gives meaning to life.\nYou don't have to depend on the majority community to give you respect.\nYou can fall back on your own identity."\n\n   For Zoroastrians, there's much to be proud of.\n\n   Their prophet, Zoroaster, seeking to make sense of a culture in which\nanimal sacrifice to multiple gods was common, preached that there was\nonly one god, a good one.  Zoroastrians call their god Ahura Mazda, which\ntranslates as Lord of Wisdom and Light.\n\n_Good vs. evil_\n\n   Zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil, with\nthe good eventually winning.  Men and women could join in the battle for\ngood, he said, and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequences\nsuch as shame and sorrow if they did wrong.  He preached honesty, charity,\nkindness to animals, respect for the environment, hard work, equality of\nmen and women - basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions.\n\n   But Zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not to\nfollow him blindly.  He demanded they think for themselves.  In fact,\nJoseph Campbell, the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myths,\ntraced the Western emphasis on individual thought to the Zoroastrians.\n\n   Zoroastrians have many words for thought.  Their motto, leaded into a\nstained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes of\nMount Hamilton, is "Good thoughts, good words, good deeds."\n\n   So it's not surprising that Zoroastrians value education highly.  In India,\nwhere a contingent of Zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escape\npersecution by Muslims in Iran, Zoroastrians claim 100 percent literacy;\nthe overall statistic in India is just 60 percent.\n\n   About half of the Bay Area Zoroastrian community came here from India\nand Pakistan, mostly to study at universities.  The other half fled from\nIran after the 1979 revolution made that a fundamentalist Islamic state\nwhere others had no rights.\n\n   Local Zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on "good\ndeeds" has improved life in every country they inhabit.  In San Jose,\nthe recent restoration of the Hotel Sainte Clarie came about because\nManou Mobedshahi, a San Francisco-based hotelier, passed the boarded-up\ndowntown landmark on his way to and from the temple.  At the temple's\ndedication, the chief guest of honor was the mother of Zubin Mehta, the\nZoroastrian conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\n   The temple exists because of another good deed: the decision by an\nIranian emigre, the late Arbab Rustom Guiv, to buy land for six temples\nin North America.  Besides the 10-acre site off Crothers Road on Mount\nHamilton, he paid for land in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Toronto,\nand Vancouver.  Until his gifts, there were no Zoroastrian temples on\nthis continent.\n\n   Local Zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple, and the\nproperty already had a large house that they have converted to a\ncommunity center.\n\n   The temple, dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet \nZoroaster, is a simple structure with gleaming white walls, vaulted \nceilings and oak floors, partially covered with huge Oriental carpets.\n\n   Its central feature is the fire, set in the middle of a partly-glassed-\nin area at the center of the building.  Although Zoroastrians are \nsometimes called "fire worshippers," they actually consider fire just \na symbol of God.  "It helps us concentrate, just like Christians use the \ncross and Muslims use the Holy Book," Bhujwala said.\n\n   The biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring.  For all\nIranians, including Zoroastrians, the New Year begins on the first day of\nthe season because of its symbolism as the start of new life.  With\nZoroaster's birthday just six days later, the combination of religious\nand secular holidays creates something on par with what most of the\nUnited States celebrates between Christmas and Jan. 1.\n\n  For this year's celebration of the prophet's birthday, about 500 people\ncame to worship and revel.\n\n   "The good things in life are not forbidden," Esfandiar Anoushiravani,\na leader of the Iranian members, had said beforehand, and what followed\nproved him right.\n\n   Inside the temple, worshipers filled every chair and sat or stood\naround the edges of the room as about a half-dozen priests chanted\nthanksgiving prayers around a table laden with braziers of smoking\nsandalwood, glasses of milk and water, and a tray heaped with dried fruit\nand nuts.\n\n   Kids crowded around, grabbing handfuls of the treats.  "People eat the\nfruit," Tarapore said.  "It's a way to participate in the ceremony."\n\n_Santa Claus, sort of_\n\n   The gathering even had a Santa Claus, Iranian style.  With flowing white\nhair and a bag of gifts for the children, this Amownaroz wore green\nsymbolic of spring) and red.\n\n   He was ushed in by a sort of spring clown, Hajefyrouz, who danced and\nplayed a tambourine.\n\n   The Zoroastrians from India were charmed.  "This is all new for us, too,"\none told a visitor who asked what was going on.\n\n   A visitor, John A. Sabanovich of Folsom, said he became intrigued with\nthe religion years ago while on business trips to Iran.  Zoroastrians have\nno procedure for accepting converts - a result, some say, of their\ncenturies of persecution in Iran followed by their promise to the Hindu\nking who allowed them into India that they would not interfere with his\npeople's religion.\n\n   But that does not stop Sabavich from joining in the celebrations at the\nSan Jose temple whenever he can.\n\n   "When I first heard about this religion," he said, "I thought, my God,\nthis is what a religion should be.  They think for themselves and do good.\n\n   "People who don't have a tradition, something to lean on, what's the\ndifference with the lower animals?"
A good point.  What helps to keep such things going is the public\nattitude that one should have "faith""; that some authority from\non high should not be subjected to mere reason.  Couple this with a\nvariety of personality quirks, mojor and minor mental illnesses, and\nego of would-be leaders, and you get all the variety of cults and \nreligions that people subscribe to.
Naw, the owners of WordPerfect are Mormons, and by Tony Rose's\nand Robert Weiss' standards, Mormons aren't Christians.  :-)

There were many injustices in the middle ages.  And this is truely sad.\nI would hate to see a day when churches put people to death or torchured\nthem for practicing homosexuality, or any other crime.  The church is not\ncalled to take over the governments of the world.  It may be that homosexuals\ntreated cruelly today, but that does not mean that we should teach \nChristians to practice homosexual immorality.  Do you think that we should\nalso teach Christians to practice divination and channelling because\nthe witches in the middle ages were persecuted.\n\n\n\nAnd you accuse me of judging?  When did you look into my heart and see\nif I have love.  I have been writing that we should not teach Christians\nto practice homosexual immorality, and you pretend to have divine knowledge\nto look into my heart.  I can't say that I love homosexuals as I should-\nI can't say that I love my neighbor as I should either.  I don't know\nvery many homosexuals as it is.  \n\nBut Jesus loves homosexuals, just as He loves everyone else.  If His love\nwere conditional, I not know Him at all.  Yes.  We should show love to \nhomosexuals, but it is not love to encourage brothers in the church to \nstumble and continue in their sin.  That is a very damaging and dangerous \nthing.\n\n\nThat is slander.   I could just as easily say  that NAMBLA has been able\nto implement legislation to make child molesting easier because of\nthe tearing down of societies morality due to people accepting homosexuality\nas normal, and that this is what you are embracing.  I do believe\nthat homosexual sex is immoral, that does not mean I endorse using violence\nagainst them.  There is a problem of hatred in the church.  But there\nis also the problem of what has been called "unsanctified mercy."\nMany in the conservative churches have seen the moral breakdown in \nthis country and the storm on the horizon, and have gotten militant in \nthe flesh.  This is truely sad.  Yet others in other churches have \nembraced immorality in society, and have pointed to the carnality in the\nconservative churches to justify their actions.  \n\n\nCertainly we should not use a bullwhip to drive people from Jesus.\nBut we shouldn't water down the gospel to draw people in.  Jesus didn't\ngo out of His way to show only what might be considered positive aspects\nto draw people in.  He told one man to sell all He had.  He told\nanother not to say good bye to His family.  His words were hard at times.\nWe should present people with the cost of the tower before we allow them\nto begin construction.  many people have already been innoculated to the\ngospel.\n\nLink Hudson.
First off, let me congratulate you for not posting a flame about "You sick\nperverts, you are immoral, you are all going to hell.", which seems to be the\nusual "religious" post found on the alt.sex.* hierarchy.  Hopefully, you won't\nget flamed, either.\n\nYou will, however, be argued with.  I personally think that your project is\nbuilt on unsteady ground.\n\nFirst, I do not believe that there is any way to find an "objective morality". \nMorality and value are inherently subjective - they represent the beliefs of a\nperson or a group of people.  They can be widely held, perhaps even\noverwhelmingly held, but they are never and _can_ never be objective.\n\n\nSecond, I do not accept the assumptions that you make here.  If, as you say,\nyou are trying to be objective, then why accept a morality to begin with by\nusing the Christian Bible?  You're defeating your own purpose by doing so.\n \n\nThird, call me a pessimist, but you won't stop the flamage.  There will always\nbe people who pop upin alt.sex.* to tell us how sick and twisted and evil we\nall are.  Just out of curiosity, do alt.sex readers show up unprovoked in the\nreligion groups to tell you all that you are narrow-minded, censoring,\noverbearing totalitarianists?\n \n\nHm.  Let me provide an example.  Four people get together over dinner, to\ndiscuss morality: you, me, a rather conservative Moslem, and a sociopath.  I\nstart off by saying that I think it's immoral to force people to have sex with\nyou.  You agree, but also say that it is immoral to have sex with someone of\nyour own gender.  (Just a note: I really don't know your views on\nhomosexuality, I am just using this as a common view of morality for the\npurposes of this example.)  The Moslem says that it is immoral for women to\nhave their faces uncovered.\n\nThe sociopath, who has become bored, kills all three of us and eats us, but\nfeels no guilt because he has done nothing wrong morally in his own mind. \n                                                                         \n\n	(Evidence deleted)\n\nI'm not going to accept your evidence for this.  You ask us to accept "The Word\nof God" that everything good comes from God.  This is only a valid argument for\na person who shares your beliefs.\n\nStill, I must say that cataloging the major themes and motifs in erotica could\nbe interesting for other reasons than yours, so good luck with this next part.\n\n\nHmmm...do I detect just a wee bit of condescence here?\n                                                      \n                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n				not very objective. \n\n\nOne could construe this to mean that beautiful people are better, or "more\ngood" than non-beautiful people.  I would hope that people relize that this is\nnot necessarily true.\n                     \n                    ^^^^\n      Might I suggest the word "penis"? It seems more in line with the tone of\nyour post. \n          \n\nBravo!  I respect you and your sense of humor, sir. \n\n                                                 \nYes, and this theme is usually what the better stories are about.  However,\nthey are not always selfish - I could point to examples in the work of Elf\nSternberg, for example.\n\n\nIt serves the same purpose as it does in pornographic movies: it affirms the\nvirility of the male involved, as well as assuring the reader that he (the\ncharacter) has orgasmed.                      \n\n\nYour Whole Picture [TM] unfortunately only applies to people who accept your\nchurch.\n         \nIn addition, if sex is for procreation, then\n\n1)	Why did God make it pleasurable, so that people would want to do it,\nrather than building it in as instinct?\n2)	Why did God make it fallible?  Not every sexual encounter results in\npregnancy, even among Catholics.  Does this mean that they have sinned?\n \n \nGranted.\n\n\nPornography would not tend in those directions if there were not a demand for\nit.  Many people have violent fantasies that they would never act out in real\nlife, but will think about and read about and mull over.\n\nLater,\n						Jeff
In response to: Whitten@Fwva.Saic.Com (David Whitten):\n\n\n\nAnd you responded:\n\n\nOf course.  The feast WAS the Seder, and the accounts of it are very clear\non this point.\n\nThe difference is the connection between the bread and wine and the body\nand blood of god.  This is an old association of the Tammuz/Osiris/Mithras\nline, and not really related to Judaism.  In any case, I didn't really\nintend to argue the point.  I saw a possible association and pointed it\nout, but I haven't the foggiest notion what really happened.
Not entirely.  Its not a premise, its a conclusion.  Second, that scientists\n(for the most part) exlude the possibility is not a problem, its a necessity. \nScientists are empircists, not theologians.\n\n\nSo do scientists, and long before you did.  Clearly you have a deep and \nfundamental misunderstanding of science.\n\n\nAbsolutely and utterly false (except for some were AMHs). Lucy (Australopithecus\nafarensis, ca. 3 to 3.25 mya) is 40% complete, and about 80% taking into \nconsideration bilateral symmetry.  Lucy walked upright and bipedally, just \nlike humans, and the two share a remarkably similar dental pattern.  Her\ncranial morphology is unlike humans or modern apes.  There are hundreds of \nother specimens of this and other species, of which only some are *partially* \nreconstructed.  They exist Bill.  You can touch them, feel them, hold them.  \nBut forget hominids.  The earth, the universe, the cultural record all look and \ntest out as ancient indeed.  They are not reconstructions.  Has God has tricked\nus here too?  It won't go away, Bill.\n  \n\n\nSo *you* and other fundamentalists say.  What about the billions who don't \nsay so?  Beware of people who say they have the truth, Bill, and reconsider\neach time you think you do.\n\n\nThat was not your point, Bill.  Your point above was God *has* the power ....\nScientists generally agree with that.  That's a far cry from saying God did.\nPlease attempt to understand your own posts.\n \n\nI have your info, and I have replied - several days ago.  Hope you have it.  \nSomehow your post above appeared at my server only today.

As many people have mentioned, there is no reason why insurers could not\noffer a contract without abortion services for a different premium.\nThe problem is that there is no guarantee that this premium would be\nlower for those who chose this type of contract.  Although you are\nremoving one service, that may have feedbacks into other types of covered\ncare which results in a net increase in actuarial costs.\n\nFor an illustrative example in the opposite direction, it may be possible\nto ADD services to an insurance contract and REDUCE the premium.  If you\nadd preventative services and this reduces acute care use, then the total\npremium may fall.

That is insofar as what I think *will be* the effect on\nmy perceptions of a time lapse (with or without my input to the Universe)\nversus what my perceptions actually turn out to be.\n\nBut values are about whether I like (in the loosest sense of the word) the \nperceptions :-)\n\n\nI don't see why.\n'Usefulness' in science is synonomous with 'accuracy' - period.\nTarot predictions are not useful because they are not accurate - or\ncan't be shown to be accurate.\nScience is useful because it is apparently accurate.\n\nValues - objective or otherwise - are beside the point.\n\nNo?
It is true that Mormons believe that all spirits (including Jesus,\nLucifer, Robert Weiss) are in the same family.  It does not mean\nthat Jesus was created, but rather that Lucifer and Robert Weiss\nwere not.  I agree that this is a "heresy".  So what?  \nThe sweating of blood in Gethsemene is\nnot a basic Mormon doctrine.  Jesus did not perform the atonement\nin Getheseme alone, as some anti-Mormons are trying to teach.  \nAs far as the "unpardonable sin" whatever that is, it is Biblical,\nand not specifically Mormon.  It is also called the sin against\nthe Holy Ghost.  Most Bible scholars (other than conservative\nones) do not believe Jehovah and Elohim were always the same.\nI'm sure you've heard of the J and the E texts?  I don't\nknow what you mean by "That He needed to be saved".  Jesus?\nJehovah?  Elohim?  In Mormon doctrine, Jesus was sinless,\nand thus did not "need to be saved".  \n\n\n-- \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGordon Banks  N3JXP      | "Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and\ngeb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon."
In <lsjc8cINNmc1@saltillo.cs.utexas.edu> turpin@cs.utexas.edu (Russell Turpin)\n\n\nI regard love as no more or less "benign" than any other Christian does.\nYou are merely expressing "approval" of the consequences I find therein.\nWhich says more about our politics and cultural trappings than about my\n(or any) religion.  "Love" is a highly ambiguous word, of which Christians\ncan write both the "gentle" words Paul uses of it in 1 Corinthians -- in\na passage that even the "conservatives" will quote at you :-) -- and the\nwords of T. S. Eliot in his Pentacost Hymn, "Love is the unfamiliar Name\nthat wove the intolerable shirt of flame ..."\n\nThis is in any case rather to the side of what I was attempting to raise\nin my note, as will become more evident below.\n\n\nblechhh.  I think you are misreading me, rather seriously.  Though,\ngiven my principle that one CANNOT force one's own notion of "sin" on\nanother, and my unshakeable "disestablishmentarianism", Russel Turpin\nand others (believers and unbelievers alike) are under no threat of my\nlegislating my own understanding of Christian love.\n\n\nYou misread.  I can do (and have repeatedly done) a complete bill of\naccusation against the Inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form\nas anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human\nbeings (in the first place) and to respect for (let alone love of) "God"\nin near succession.  Please go back to my quoted words above:\n\nThe "possibility that always exists" is that I (or, to revert to proper\ntime sequence, my predecessors over the last several centuries) could\npersuade "Christian B" of my case that the Inquisition *does* indeed\nconstitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love.  I must also note\nthat the majority of Christians HAVE been so persuaded.  By Christian\nargumentation, as well as by secular [both Christian and non-Christian]\nprohibitions.\n\nWhat Mr. Turpin alludes to is a trickier point:\n\n	A.  I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved\n	    in the Inquisition.\n\n	B.  The Inquisitor responds that Mother Church must, however\n	    painful this *seems*, "discipline" her children for their\n	    own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls (or\n	    if the tortured heretic will not recant, than by bad example\n	    "deterring" others from the same loss-of-soul.)\n\n	A.  I point out that this "justification" of a failure in love\n	    depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of\n	    philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable.\n\n	B.  Burns me at the stake.\n\nMy rhetoric has failed, but the point I am making is sustained.  What is\ngoing on here has a *lot* to do with "cultural baggage."  In this case,\nthe baggage includes a (nearly universal, and absolutely secular) belief\nthat an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most\nbelievable if taken under torture.  The elimination of Inqisitorial\npractice (in those places where it *has* been eliminated, or at least\ngreatly reduced) has very little, if anything, to do with the discussion\nof sin in the exchange between A and B.\n\nMr. Turpin is pointing out that, if I am A versus the Grand Inquisitor's B,\nthen my persuasion is not very likely to work.  I know this; and in what-\never personal agony, I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defense\nattorney.  So, "one possibility" fails in this case -- as it will fail in\nmay others.  At the other extreme, the "persuasion" will succeed when it\nproperly SHOULD not, if it entails mistaken assumptions I share with the\nInquisitor.  And that is potentially an even more troubling case, in that\nmany of the victims of Inquisition will have "accepted" that they were in\nfact sinful (in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty\nof charges brought against them.)\n\nThe point is that the "persuasion" breaks down when the parties do NOT\nshare enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main\nthrust of the Inquisition, against "heresy", it is *bound* to break down\nin precisely the "worst" cases.  The "conservative" (I don't think that\nis the right word, BTW) will take refuge in what I attribute to B above,\nthat he is "justified" in causing harm because he *thinks* that works to\na "greater good."  But this is a violent and extravagant REFUSAL to follow\nthe gospel, as if one's theories about "sin" entitled one to cast aside\nJesus' words on dealing with sinners (cf. Matthew 5:39ff).\n\nI am a "radical" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.\n\n\nWell, the whole *point* of making these the "base" commandments is that\nthey *aren't* reducible to rules.  A set of rules is a moral code or a\nlaw code or an algorithm for acting.  Such things can be very helpful\nto individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a\npersonal involvement in and responsibility for one's actions.  The Great\nCommandment is, more than anything else, a call to act *as if you were\nGod and accepting ultimate responsibility* in your every action.  A\ndemand that I, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keeps popping\nup nonetheless (along with the reassurance that it is more important\nthat I be open to trying this, than succeeding at it).  "Conservatives"\nmay twist this "act as if you were God" to mean "lay down rules for other\npeople and be as nasty to them as possible if they don't keep YOUR rules."\nThey are so insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a\nlot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such idiocy\nIS how God acts.  That, after all, is the standard accusation "against\nGod" by the atheists here and elsewhere.  That the "conservatives" have\nconfused THEIR manipulative, hoop-jumping notions of coercing other\npeople with the Nature of God is almost the entire content of standard\nAmerican atheism -- and I quite agree with it on this point.\n\n\nAnd different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged\n*different* "ethical systems" (or in some cases, none).  As a result,\nit is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular\n(or infamous) with Christianity.  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH.\nIt does not have a QU'RAN.  Specifically Christian scripture has very\nlittle, if anything, in the way of "commandments" -- so little that\nthe "Christians" who desperately *want* commandments go "mining" for\nthem with almost no support (and thus almost no obvious limitation :-))\nfor their efforts.  The one, single, thing in the gospels which Jesus\nspecifically "gives" as "a commandment" to us is "love one another."\n\n	[I will be expanding on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson\n	 that I hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that\n	 SOME Christians infer LOTS of commandments from the NT; I'll\n	 point out what has to be going on in these inferences, and why\n	 there is a huge amount of "cultural baggage" involved.]\n\nYou are quite right that this is "goo" if one is looking for an ethical\nsystem.\n\nBut why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our\nsociety is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?  It\nmay be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems\n-- in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again.\n\n\nI think you are begging the question. Why don't I and the (myriads\nof) other Christians like me tell you something about Christianity?\n[Nor is this very new in Christianity -- you might want to look up\nthe origins and fundamental doctrines of the Quakers, from the 17th\ncentury onwards, and they are not at all the first to understand the\ngospel in a manner that is congenial to my case.]

sandvik@newton.apple.com (Kent Sandvik) writes...\n\n\n\nKS, I see you're wanting Malcolm's response. Allow me one last inter-\njection then please:\n\nDistinguishing among the religious Jews, you've excepted the Messianic\nfor obvious reasons. Specifically, are you saying it's these religious \nJews, who trace their lineage back to Abraham by blood and orthodoxy, \nrather than by faith, who won't agree?  Orthodox Jews?  \n\nAs to the a/a (if I understand your direction), the issue remains \nunproven I suspect, considering how atheists and agnostics so often \nlook to reason. Atheist, it is reasonable to conclude will not agree.\nFor agnostics, a poll seems in order. Who knows?  Myself, I'm not so \nsure the atheists can be counted out. \n\nFor the orthodox, I wonder how many would follow Moses, or Abraham,\nor David in accepting God's Word? Is the particular covenant to which\none adheres, more important than God promisimg? I reckon for many it\ndepends on the ongoing dialogue. Under these considerations, you might \nunderstand why I think it's premature to assert who will and won't agree.
I addressed most of the key issues in this very long (284 lines) post\nby Dean Kaflowitz in two posts yesterday.  The first was made into the\ntitle post of a new thread, "Is Dean Kaflowitz terminally irony-impaired?"\nand the second, more serious one appeared along the thread\n\n"A Chaney Post, and a Challenge, reissued and revised"\n\nboth only in talk.abortion, but I am posting its contents into\ntalk.religion.misc as soon as I exit here.\n\nThis should be enough for us to thrash out for the next week or so.  The\nsecond post really grapples with the main bones of contention between us.\nThe first is more lighthearted and tells about such things as \nKaflowitzDebatingPoints [tm], which he continues to rack up on both\ntalk.abortion and talk.religion.misc, while setting follow-ups to \ntalk.abortion alone.  His lame excuse for the latter policy is that\nhe gets a prompt as to where to set follow-ups, and does not follow\ntalk.religion.misc much; this suggests that he is being hypocritical in not\nalso setting his Newsgroups line to talk.abortion alone.
There were some recent developments in the dispute about Masonry among\nSouthern Baptists.  I posted a summary over in bit.listserv.christia, and\nI suppose that it might be useful here.  Note that I do not necessarily\nagree or disagree with any of what follows: I present it as information.\n\n *\n\nFor a short summary:  a Southern Baptist named Larry Holly wrote a book\nclaiming that Freemasonry is a religion incompatible with Christianity.\n(Mr Holly's father rejects Christianity, and Mr Holly blames that on the\nMasons.)\n\nThe SBC's Home Missions Board includes an interfaith witness department,\nwhich studies other religions and how to teach them about Christ.  A few\nyears ago, they were ordered to produce a report on Masonry: they concluded\nthat it was not a religion, and therefore was outside their speciality.\nHowever, Mr Holly led a movement of people who oppose Masonry, and\nlast year the Convention again ordered the HMB to study Masonry.  (I got the\nfeeling that they were saying "You got the wrong answer last time, try to\ndo better and get the answer we want.")\n\nAnyway, there's been a bit of infighting and some inappropriate actions, but\nthe dust has settled and the report is in.  Nobody is entirely happy with it,\nbut everybody seems willing to live with it.  Both sides are saying things\nsuch as: "This was the best we were going to get in the current environment."\n\nThe report commends the Masons for the charity work they do, such as the\nhospitals and burn centers they operate, as well as efforts to help the\nelderly and prevent drug abuse.  The report acknowledges that many well-\nknown Christians are and have been Masons, and notes that many teachings\nof Masonry are "supportive of Christian faith and practice".  Examples of\nthe latter include belief in God, emphases on honesty and integrity, and\nthat some Masonic lodges incorporate explicit Christian beliefs.\n\nOn the other hand, they note that some aspects of Masonry are incompatible\nwith Southern Baptist principles.  These included the use of titles which some\npeople consider sacrilegious, the taking of certain oaths (even though they\nare not meant seriously), the "undeniably pagan and/or occultic" writings of\nsome Masonic leaders, the implication in some Masonic writings that salvation\ncan be achieved by good works, and the racial discrimination practiced by many\nMasonic lodges.  (I note with some chagrin that Baptist churches as a whole\naren't really in a place to speak on this last point.)\n\n\nThe report concludes that Masonry is not a religion, and says that membership\nshould not be endorsed or censured, but left to the discretion of individuals.\nThis was in part because there is variation among different Masonic Lodges,\nand while one may include elements strongly against Christianity, another may\nnot.  Many Southern Baptists have strong convictions about the priesthood of\nthe believer and the autonomy of the local church, and this history probably\ninfluenced how the report came out.\n\n *\n\nThe information above was gleaned from "The Religious Herald", a publication\nof the Baptist General Association of Virginia, and "Baptists Today", which\ndoes not have any direct links to a religious organisation.  (Autonomy is a\nbig issue among some Baptists.  8-)\n\nBecause I have neither the report itself, nor whatever Masonic documents are\nrelevant to these issues, none of the above comes with a guarantee.  Your\nmileage may vary.  Void where prohibited.\n\n\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\n\nMilton:  "We use only the finest baby frogs, dew picked and flown from Iraq,\n          cleansed in finest quality spring water, lightly killed, and then\n          sealed in a succulent Swiss quintuple smooth treble cream milk\n          chocolate envelope and lovingly frosted with glucose."

Not to be too snide about it, but I think this Christianity must\n   be a very convenient religion, very maliable and suitable for\n   any occassion since it seems one can take it any way one wants\n   to go with it and follow whichever bits one pleases and\n   reinterpret the bits that don't match with one's desires.  It\n   is, in fact, so convenient that, were I capable of believing\n   in a god, I might consider going for some brand of Christianity.\n   The only difficulty left then, of course, is picking which sect\n   to join.  There are just so many.\n    \n   Dean Kaflowitz\n\nYes, Christianity is convenient.  Following the teachings of Jesus\nChrist and the Ten Commandments is convenient.  Trying to love in a\nhateful world is convenient.  Turning the other cheek is convenient.  So\nconvenient that it is burdensome at times.\n\nDave.

O Arjuna, become transcendental to these three modes. Be free\nfrom all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be\nestablished in the self.\n  \n                                PURPORT\n\n All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three\nmodes of material nature. They are meant for fruitive results, which\ncause bondage in the material world. The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive\nactivities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of\nsense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane. Arjuna,\nas a student and friend of Lord Krsna, is advised to raise himself to\nthe transcendental position of Vedanta philosophy where, in the\nbeginning, there is brahma-jijnasa, or questions on the supreme\ntranscendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are\nstruggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of\nthe material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get\nrid of the material entanglement. When the activities for sense\ngratification, namely the karma-kanda chapter, are finished, then the\nchance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the\nUpanisads, which are part of different Vedas, as the Bhagavad-gita is a\npart of the fifth Veda, namely the Mahabharata. The Upanisads mark the\nbeginning of transcendental life.\n\n As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in\nthe material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities\nsuch as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating\nsuch dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This\ntranscendental position is achieved in full Krsna consciousness when one\nis fully dependent on the good will of Krsna.\n\nBhagavad-Gita As It is\nBooks of A.C.

I have recently become aware\nthat my health insurance includes coverage for illness and injuries\nsuffered by Christians.  It disturbs me deeply to know that my premiums\nmay be used to pay for that which I sincerely believe is divine\npunishment for their sinful conduct.  In addition these folks are able to\navail themselves of such alternative therapies as Lourdes, Fatima,\nMorris Cerullo, Benny Hinn, etc.  In any case as "Jesus Saves' I feel\nthat there is no reason for them to be covering their bets at my\nexpense.  I would like to request that I be exempted from Christian\ncoverage with my health premiums reduced accordingly.
Another dodge.  Oh well.  I'm no match for your amazing repertoire\nof red herrings and smoke screens.  \n\nYou asked for an apology.  I'm not going to apologize for pointing out\nthat your straw-man argument was a straw-man argument.  Nor for saying\nthat your list of "bible contradictions" shows such low standards of\nscholarship that it should be an embarrassment to anti-inerrantists,\njust as Josh McDowell should be an embarrassment to the fundies.  Nor\nfor objecting various times to your taking quotes out of context.  Nor\nfor pointing out that "they do it too" is not an excuse. Nor for calling\nyour red herrings and smoke screens what they are.\n\nI'm still not sure why you think I'm a hypocrite.  It's true that I\nhaven't responded to any of Robert Weiss' articles, which may be due in\npart to the fact that I almost never read his articles.  But I have\nresponded to both you and Frank DeCenso (a fundie/inerrantist.)  Both\nyou and Frank have taken quotes out of context, and I've objected to\nboth of you doing so.  I've criticized bad arguments both when they\nwere yours and I agreed with the conclusion (that the Bible is not\ninerrant), and when they were Frank's and I disagreed with the\nconclusion.  I've criticized both you and Frank for evading questions,\nand for trying to "explain me away" without addressing the objections\nI raise (you by accusing me of being hypocritical and irrational, Frank\nby accusing me of being motivated by a desire to attack the Bible.) I\ndon't see that any of this is hypocritical, nor do I apologize for it.\n\nI do apologize, however, for having offended you in any other way.\n\nHappy now?
Take a second look at "non-toxic, non-flammable":\n\n		MACE (sold tothe public) is supposedly nontoxic.\n		Whatthey do not tell you is that if you get mace directly\n		on the linings of the lungs (such as a direct snort to\n		the face) above certain quantities, it reacts similarly\n		to a mustard gas inhalation.\n\n			I know:  my father and grandfather were exposed\n			to poison gas in WWI and WWII; Dad went through\n			the side effects of any WEAPON, including those\n			"non-toxic" aerosols.\n\n		WHat the label ACTUALLY means is ::\n\n			usually, it wont kill you\n			it may give you permanent CSS asthsma\n			but that's better than blowing a hole in your\n				head ...\n\n		ALL aerosols are flammable IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH OXYGEN\n		AND HIT IT WITH THE RIGHT IGNITER.  SOme of the most\n		non-flammable substances known will BOOM or SEARFLAME\n		if you hit it with the right combo.\n\n\n		Let's take one:  a trash can fire.  Makes black smoke;\n		already burned right?  Can't go boom, right?  Wrong.\n\n		Suck that smoke (made up of paper that has carbonized,\n		or burned about 35% of the fuel in it) into an air\n		conditioning return, mix with about 5:1 air, and light\n		a match.  200 feet of conduit is about the same, when\n		filled with that smoke mixture, as oh, say 200 pounds TNT\n\n			THAT is why the fire codes say NO OPEN CEILING\n			TILES IN BUILDINGS.  Because 3-5 stories of\n			a building have blown OUT by "nonflammable _smoke_"\n\n	So:\n		Take a little "nonflammable aerosol"\n		Mix with gasoline or kerosene fumes\n\n			NO electricity, remeber?  A bit of heating\n			on the WACO plains?  Boil water to drink\n			since the water was cut off?\n\n		liberally mix and allow to settle for 1-4 hours\n\n		Fumes vent down into the bus underground, and the Davidians\n		move the children UPSTAIRS to a saferoom (they had one,\n		armor plated, remember?) to BREATH, because kids get sick\n		and die from tear gas.\n\n		and along comes a tracer, a spark, what have you:\n\n			everyone burns to death.\n\nTry thinking before opening mouth: it may not have happened the\nway the Gmen say it did.

Superficially a good answer, but it isn't that simple.  An awful lot of the\nstarvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic\npolicies of the Western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical\nWesterner.  For instance, some third-world countries with terrible\nmalnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can\nbe fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  They\nhave to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans\nwe encouraged them to take out.  Fund-raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarre\nidea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they've got.\n\nPerhaps it's more accurate to say that there's a Western ethic against\nWestern infanticide.  All the evidence suggests that so long as the children\nare dying in the Third World, we couldn't give a shit.  And that goes for the\nsupposed "Pro-Life" movement, too.  They could save far more lives by\nfighting against Third World debt than they will by fighting against\nabortion.  Hell, if they're only interested in fetuses, they could save more\nof those by fighting for human rights in China.\n\nAnd besides, Suzanne's answer implies that non-Western countries lack this\nethic against infanticide.  Apart from China, with its policy of mandatory\nforced abortion in Tibet, I don't believe this to be the case.
I assume you have evidence that he was responsible for the deaths?\n \n\nAgain, I'd like to see some evidence.\n \n\nOnce again, where's your proof? Suicide is considered a sin by Branch\nDavidians.  Also, Koresh said over and over again that he was not going to\ncommit suicide.  Furthermore, all the cult experts said that he was not\nsuicidal.  David Thibedeau (sp?), one of the cult members, said that the fire\nwas started when one of the tanks spraying the tear gas into the facilities\nknocked over a lantern.\n \n\nEvidence please?\n\n\nI'd like to point out that the Bible says "Do not commit murder." The NKJ\ntranslation mistranslates.  Self-defense was never considered murder.  The\nreason why they were stockpiling weapons is because they were afraid the\ngovernment would try something.  Their fears were obviously well founded.\n--Ray Cote
Let me begin by saying I think this is the world's first religion to use\nthe net as its major recruitment medium.  Therefore, even if this\nreligion does not take off, its founding members will be very important\nhistorically as this method of soliciting membership will eventually become \ncommon.\n\nThe basis of this religion is to apply various aspects of current conventional\nmorality to the characters in Genesis and Exodus but assume that the Bible's\naccounts of the facts and historical events is correct.\n\nFor example,\n\nStory of Adam and Eve:\nAdam and Eve are in Garden of Eden naked and ignorant.  Have unlimited\nsupply of food provided, but no clothing, jobs, or knowledge.  God says\nnot to eat fruit of tree of knowledge.  They do anyway, then try to hide \nin bushes.  God finds them and forces them out of Garden.\n(There are several different stories on what they were doing while naked in\nthe bushes that might have angered God.)\n\nTraditional Philosophy:\n1. The only reason you need knowledge or a job is to eat.  If someone else will\nprovide you with food, then you can be stupid and unemployed and it's OK. This\nis why married women usually didn't work until recent decades.\n2. Authority figures, such as God, whoever was behind the Vietnam War, Hitler \nand slaveowners, are always right and should be blindly followed without \nquestion by ordinary people, who can't make decisions for themselves.\n\nInterpretation of events based on Traditional Philosophy:\nThey were not supposed to eat the fruit.  They should have done whatever God\ntold them to.  Like small children, they had their needs provided for and were\nobligated to do whatever their "Father" said to.  Being forced to leave the \nGarden and work in order to obtain food was a punishment.\n\nLessons from Traditional Interpretation:\n1.  Ignorance is good.  Knowledge is bad, but tempting.\n2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read "welfare") is ideal.  Get-\nting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn is punishment.\n3.  Public nudity is good.  Covering up is bad.\n4.  Authority figures are intrinsically right.  Normal people are dumb and \nshould do whatever they are told without question.  They should not think for \nthemselves.\n5.  People in subordinate positions are especially obligated to refrain from\nlearning.  For example, it should be illegal for slaves to learn to read.\n\n1990's philosophy:\n1.  People should seek education and employment outside the home, unless\nnamed "Hillary Clinton" or "Murphy Brown".\n2.  People should use common sense.  They should not kill other people \n(binding of Issac, wars, Holocaust, etc.) just because they are told to.\n\nInterpretation of events based on current philosophy:\nThey were supposed to eat the fruit.  God gave wanted them to seek knowledge\nrather than be handed it on a silver platter.  Once they had gained knowledge\nand (by seeking it) showed their ability to make mature decisions for them-\nselves, they no longer needed to be treated like little children and were \nREWARDED by being allowed into the "real world."\n\nLessons from new interpretation:\n1.  Ignorance is bad.  Knowledge is good, but must be sought.\n2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read "welfare") is at best\na temporary measure.  Getting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn\nis ideal.\n3.  Public nudity is bad.  Covering up is good.\n4.  Authority figures are often wrong.  Normal people are intelligent and\nshould consider whether the instructions are really a good idea and "alter\nor abolish" bad governments.  They should think for themselves.\n5.  People in subordinate decisions are often discouraged from knowledge\nbut should seek it anyway, and all the harder.  For example, poor children \nwithout good schools should work especially hard in order to make a better\nlife for their children (and themselves).\n\nI have tentatively named this new philosophy "The Church of Eveism" because\nEve's decision to eat the apple is man[sic]kind's first good decision, instead\nof its first bad one, as traditionally believed.  She is therefore clearly\na protagonist.  God at first appears evil, for telling people not to seek \nknowledge but on deeper analysis is also a protagonist.  As God rewarded the\ndecision to defy him, and provided the tree in the first place, the intention\nand desire were clearly to have the knowledge be obtained, but to delay it \nuntil it was actively sought.\n\n---End serious discussion.

I would like to add my support for a misc.taoism discussion group.\nI applaud the enthusiam shown by the person posting <79899@cup.portal.com> \n"Thyagi@cup.portal.com" (I read in alt.magick), but I differ\nwith him/her in believing that at least some minimal parameters \nshould be agreed upon.\n\n\n\nBut if we don't limit it to *something*, the discussion degenerates into\na big amorphous glob. \n\nOther questions Thyagi proposes are:\n\n\nIt seems to me that these questions more properly fall into the\ncategory of "general metaphysics". I would prefer any misc.taoism\nto deal more closely with topics and works more closely associated\nwith at least "semi-orthodox" Taoism: with established classic works \ndefinitely included and works like Mantak Chia's argued about! \n\nI think "neo-Taoism" should be excluded or get its own group (what I\nmean by this is "Humpty-Dumpty Taoism", in which Taoism means whatever \na poster says it means.) This "alt.taoism" could also be a refuge \nfor debates about what "Taoism *REALLY* means" or speculations on sexual\nalchemy, etc..\n\ne.g. (from Thyagi again):\n\nKent gloomily predicts (quoting from Thyagi's article):\n\n\nI think that discussions of this nature are not completely out of\nplace. What's happening is that that the term "Taoism" is becoming\ncompletely polluted and trivialized like the words "magic", "Alchemy", \n"Zen," etc., by writers appropriating the word to mean whatever they \nwant. This is seen by the spate of new age books entitled "The\nTao of" this, that, and everything else. (With respect to some exceptions\nlike the books by Jou, Tsung-Hwa.)\n\nAny other comments/ideas? I look forward to seeing them. On balance,\nI say let misc.taoism rip and let the chips fall where they may. If\nit just gets filled up with college freshmen asking about the\nTao of Sex then it will have been a failure and people will post to\nthese groups just as they do now.\n\n--

The interesting notion is that (I watched TV tonight) Koresh never\nclaimed officially to be Jesus Christ. His believers hoped that \nhe would be, but he never took this standpoint himself.\n\nHe was more interested in breaking the seven seals of Revelation,\nand make sure that Armageddon would start. Well it did, and 19\nchildren died, and no God saved them.\n\nKent
-*----\n\nThe two commandments *are* rules; they are merely rules that are\nso vague that they are practically devoid of meaning.  Michael\nSiemon acknowledges this every time he writes that the resolution\nof an argument over them turns on secular and cultural\nassumptions that are independent of these rules.\n \n\nThe commandment to love your neighbor as yourself can be viewed,\nin part, as reminding man that he is not God and cannot act as if\nhe has "ultimate responsibility." Indeed, many traditions present\nan interpretation where believers are supposed to interpret\nloving one's neighbor as following various other rules, and\nrelying on their god to make things come out right, precisely\nbecause it would be wrong for man to assume such "ultimate\nresponsibility." Once again, we are confronted with good sounding\ngoo that means whatever the reader wants it to mean. \n\n\nAnd who is to say that this interpretation is "twisted"?  There\nare many passages in the Bible that in their most straightforward\nreading show the Christian god behaving in just this way.\nMichael cannot refer to "base" claims or base commandments to\nshow that such readings are "twisted," because this divergence in\nunderstanding occurs even in trying to interpret the "base"\nclaims and commandments.  In addressing conservative Christians,\nMichael will necessarily draw upon secular and cultural notions\nthat these conservative Christians will reject.  \n\n\nBut these base commandments are too vague to serve as  "a\nprinciple for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems." The meaning of\nthese base commandments for any believer derives from the secular\nand cultural notions that the believer brings to them, from how\nthe believer mixes their demands with straightforward readings of\nother Biblical passages, from a particular sectarian tradition,\nor from some combination of these things.  These commandments\nlack sufficient substance in themself to serve as a basis for\ncriticizing ethical systems.  What meaning they have comes from\nthe ethical system the believer brings to these commandments. \n\n\nJesus explicitly states that this summarizes Jewish law, which\nwould seem to bring in all of it if we properly understand what\nit means to love God and love our neighbors.  There are *many*\nparables and teachings the gospels attribute to Jesus that are\nstraightforwardly read as ethical commandments.  The Pauline\nepistles are similarly full.  If it is not clear that these all\ncome together in a sensible understanding of ethical behavior,\nthe problem is *not* a lack of raw material. \n\n-*----\n\nNo, Michael, the conservative Christians also take the gospel \nseriously.  What differentiates you is the way you interpret the\ngospel.\n\n\nIn a sense, the wide variety of interpretations does tell us\nsomething about Christianity.  It tells us that the New Testament\nauthors left a sufficiently vague hodge-podge that it can serve\nas the source text for many, vastly different beliefs about the\nnature of the Christian god and about what men should and\nshouldn't do. \n\nThe irony here is that there is *nothing* in Christianity per\nse that Michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and\ngays.  *Every* Christian principle he turns to this cause is\neffective only through the extra-Christian principles through\nwhich Michael interprets his religion, and the homophobes apply\nthe *same* Christian principles, with equal justification, to\ntheir cause.  In short, it is the extra-Christian principles that\nmake Michael's Christianity beneficial, and I suspect they would\nbe as beneficial, perhaps moreso, without being filtered by\nChristian interpretation.  \n\nMichael paints a picture of "standard American atheism" as the\nrejection of the evil in many conservative Christian\ninterpretations of the Bible.  But I think it is even more\ndamaging to Christianity to note that the New Testament presents\nsuch a vague hodge-podge of notions about the nature of God and\nthe nature of the good (except, of course, when it is ordered by\nan interpretation that relies on extraneous principles).  Here, I\nthink we should apply a Christian parable, where a cold drink can\nhave its value and a hot drink can have its value, but the\nlukewarm we should spit out.

Ref: Encyclopedia of Religion, Mircea Eliade\n\nMAGI: \n\n[Sneak Preview: Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting\n ground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous\n _Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which\n most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the\n second century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\n the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\n to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12).]\n\n  The Old Persian word magu, rendered in Greek by magos, is of uncertain \netymology. It may originally have meant "member of the tribe," as in the\nAvestan compound mogu-tbish ("hostile to a member of the tribe"). This meaning\nwould have been further resticted, among the Medes, to "member of the priestly\ntribe" and perhaps to "priest" (Benveniste, 1938; Boyce, 1982). The term is\nprobably of Median origin, given that Herodotus mentions the "Magoi" as one of\nthe six tribes of the Medes.\n  For a variety of reasons we can consider the Magi to have been members of a\npriestly tribe of Median origin in western Iran. Among the Persians, they were\nresponsible for liturgical functions, as well as for maintaining their\nknowledge of the holy and the occult. Most likely, the supremacy of the Median\npriesthood in western Iran became established during the time of the Median\nmonarchy that dominated the Persians from the end of the eighth century\nthrough the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyrus the\nGreat (550 BCE). The Persians were indebted to the Medes for their political\nand civil institutions as well. Even if hypotheses have been advanced\nconcerning the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period\n(Boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of Median origin. This is\ndemonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian, mentioned by\nDarius I (522-486 BCE) in the inscription at Bisutun (Iran), as well as by\nGreek sources. Indeed, Herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of\nthe Medes against the Persians through the conspiracy of the Magi.\n  The fact that the Magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the\nsacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the\npossibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions. This seems to be\nattested by the Elamite tablets at Persepolis.\n  There is a theses, put forth by Giuseppe Messina, that denies that the Magi\nare members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of\nthe priesthood - a priesthood of purely Zoroastrian origin. This thesis is\nuntenable; on the other hand, the hypothesis that their name is related to the\nAvestan term magavan, derived from the Gathic maga (Vedic, magha, "gift"), is\nnot without foundation (Mole, 1963). The meaning of maga can probably be found,\nin conformity with the Pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept of\npurity, or separation of the "mixture" of the two opposed principles of spirit\nand matter. The maga, which has been erroneously interpreted as "chorus," from\nthe root mangh, which is said to mean "sing the magic song" (Nyberg, 1966) and\nhas been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica, seems to be an\necstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision. In any case, though\nthere may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan terms\nmagavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and the\nAvestan priesthood. The Avesta ignores the Median or Old Persian term, despite\na recent hypothesis proposed by H.W. Bailey; Old Persian inscriptions ignore\nthe Avestan term for "priest," athravan (Vedic, athravan), even if this is \nperhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablets of Persepolis \n(Gershevitch, 1964).\n  The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history; the\nPahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation. The latter in\nparticular derives from an older form, magupati ("head of the Magi"). During\nthe Sasanid period (third to seventh centuries CE), which saw the formation of\na hierarchically organized church, the title mobadan mobad ("the high priest of\nhigh priests") came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical\nhierarchy.\n  The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage, or khvaetvadatha (Av.; Pahl.,\nkhwedodah). They also performed a characteristic funeral rite: the exposure of\nthe corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it.\nThe corpse was not supposed to decompose, lest it be contaminated by the demons\nof putrefaction. This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian\ncommunity and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the\nParsis in India. Stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especially for this\nrite. During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was\nin vogue only among the Magi; the Persians generally sprinkled the corpse with\nwax, then buried it. The practice was widespread, however, among the peoples\nof Central Asia.\n  The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship: it was impossible to\noffer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus. During the performance of a\nritual sacrifice, the Magus sang of the theogony (the Magi were possibly the\ncustodians of a tradition of sacred poetry, but we know nothing about the\nrelationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta) and was\ncalled upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future. The Magi were also\nknown for the practice of killing harmful, or "Ahrimanical," animals (khrafstra)\nsuch as snakes and ants. They dressed in the Median style, wearing pants,\ntunics, and coats with sleeves. They wore a characteristic head covering of\nfelt (Gr. tiara) with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose\nand mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their\nbreath (Boyce, 1982). The color of these caps, in conformity with a tradition\nthat is probably of Indo-European origin, according to Georges Dumezil, was\nthat of the priesthood: white.\n  In all likelihood, during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in\npossession of a well-defined body of doctrine, and it is probable that they\ngradually adopted Zoroastrianism; they were most likely a clergy consisting of\nprofessional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally\ninclined to eclecticism and syncretism. Nonetheless, they must have been\njealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions. By virtue of this\nthey were the educators of the royal princes. The wisest of them was responsible\nfor teaching the prince the "magic of Zarathushtra, son of Horomazes" and thus\nthe "cult of the gods." Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with\nthe education of the prince so that he would learn to be just, courageous, and\nmaster of himself.\n  During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of great\ninfluence, although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor. Despite\nseveral dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of\nGaumata the Magian - in which, according to Herodotus (who calls himself\nSmerdis), the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation -\nthe Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media,\nin Persia, and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed\nas a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration.\n  No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi. They were\nrenowned as followers of Zarathushtra (Zoroaster); as the teachers of some of\nthe greatest Greek thinkers (Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato); as the wise men\nwho arrived, guided by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in\nBethlehem; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India. But they were\nalso known as the Chaldeans, the priesthood of Babylon, known for its occultism;\nthis was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek,\nlike "goes," "expert in the magic arts" (Bidez and Cumont, 1938). Indeed, the\nChaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts, especially astrology, and\nhad a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge.\n  To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views, it\nis necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-called\nwestern Magi, who were later hellenized. In the Achaemenid period both must\nhave been at least in part Zoroastrian, but the western Magi (those of the\nIranian diaspora in Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia), who came in\ncontact with diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner or later and in\nvarying degrees, been influenced by syncretic concepts.\n  The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and, depending on their\nvarying concerns, would emphasize one or the other aspect of them. Classical\nhistorians and geographers, including Herodotus and Strabo, document their\ncustoms, while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines: dualism,\nbelief in the hereafter, Magian cosmology and cosmogony, and their theology\nand eschatology. Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magi\neven speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus. In doing so they are repeating what the\nMagi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods, when they adopted\nZoroastrianism. At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own and\nplaced themselves under his venerable name.\n  Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the\neastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting those\nelements of the archaic religion that refused to die. It has been said quite\noften, in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the\nZoroastrian tradition, that the Vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, "the law-abjuring\ndaivas"), part of the Avesta, should be attributed to them. (This collection of\ntexts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and\npractices.) Nonetheless, the hypothesis is hardly plausible, since the first\nchapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda, the\nsupreme god of Zoroastrianism, but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman (Pahl.;\nGathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), the other supreme god and the ultimate source of\nall evil and suffering - does not mention western Iran, Persia, or Media (the\nland of Ragha mentioned in the text cannot be Median Raghiana). Furthermore, it\nhas been noted (Gershevitch, 1964) that if the authors had been Magi the\nabsence of any reference to western Iranian institutions, including their own\npriesthood, would be very strange.\n  The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the\ncorpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us, from the second half of the\nfirst millennium BCE on. This has been their principal merit. We can attribute\ndirectly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed, known to\nus especially from Greek sources and, in part, from the Pahlavi literature of\nthe ninth and tenth centuries CE. According to this formulation, the two poles\nof the dualism are no longer, as in the Gathas, Spenta Mainyu ("beneficent\nspirit") and Angra Mainyu ("hostile spirit") but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra\nMainyu (Gershevitch, 1964). [See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu.] This trans-\nformation was of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro-\nastrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the Magi with the\nMesopotamian religious world. In this new dualism - which was that later known\nto the Greeks (Aristotle, Eudemus of Rhodes, Theopompus, and others) - we can\nsee the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism, to which\nwe give the name Zurvanism. [See Zurvanism.]\n  Thanks to their adherence to Zoroastrianism, the Magi played an enormously\nimportant role in the transmission of Zarathushtra's treachings, as well as in\nthe definition of the new forms that these would assume historically. Their\nnatural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of\nZoroastrian ideas in the communities of the Iranian diaspora. The Greeks began\nto study their doctrines and to take an interest in them (Xanthus of Lydia,\nHermodorus, Aristotle, Theopompus, Hermippus, Dinon), even writing treatises\non the Persian religion, of which only the titles and a few fragments have\nsurvived. In the Hellenistic period, the Magi were seen as a secular school of\nwisdom, and writings on magic, astrology, and alchemy were lent the authority\nof such prestigious names as Zarathushtra, Ostanes, and Hystaspes, forming an\nabundant apocryphal literature. (Bidez and Cumont, 1938).\n  Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting\nground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous\n_Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which\nmost likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the\nsecond century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\nthe Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\nto Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12). [See Saoshyant.]\n  The Sasanid period saw the Magi once again play a determining role in the\nreligious history of Iran. Concerned to win back the western Magi (de Menasce,\n1956), and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism as the national religion of\nIran, the priests of Iranian sanctuaries in Media and Persia were able to\nestablish a true state church, strongly hierarchical and endowed with an\northodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures. The leading figures\nin the development of a state religion and of Zoroastrian orthodoxy were Tosar\nand Kerder, the persecutors of Mani in the third century.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nWhen are we going to hear a Christian answer to this question? \n\nIn paraphrase:
You are correct. See today's (4/21) Washington Post. The gas the\nFBI used is most certainly fatal in high concentrations. Of course,\nnon-toxic tear gas is an oxymoron; the whole point of tear gas is\nthat it is toxic, and its toxic effects cause people to seek\nfresh air.
Actually, jon, that is quite true.  Christian people have caused\n"objective morality" to look very "relative."  After all, that was the\npoint of the original question in this thread, i.e. can we toss out\nChristianity because it is so obviously inconsistent with its own\nprinciples?  If you will bear with me, I will attempt to explain this\napparent inconsistency from at least one Christian's viewpoint:\n\nIf God exists and is the creator of mankind as the Bible claims, then\nHe has a pretty well-defined concept of what makes people tick\nphysically, emotionally, etc.  GOD has an "objective" morality for us.\nThat is to say, He has no trouble understanding what is good for (or\ndetrimental to) the creature He created. \n\n	Galatians 2:10-- For we [mankind] are His workmanship, created in\n	Christ Jesus for good works [a morality], which God prepared\n	beforehand [a well-defined design], that we might walk in them.\n\nHowever, contrary to what many people assume (including the Pharasees\nof the Bible,) God's morality cannot be completely codified in a list\nof rules and regulations.  To some extent, every activity of a\nperson's life creates a new situation to which morality must be\napplied.  There never could be enough volumes to codify God's\n"objective" morality for us. \n\nThroughout history, mankind has tried to reduce morality to a list of\nrules (objectivity, if you please.)  In the Old Testament, we have\nboth principles and specific rules.  By the time of Jesus, most of the\nprinciples were obscured by the emphasis men had placed on the rules.\nVolumes of additional rules had been made to try to codify the\napplication of the principles.  We [mankind] weren't comfortable with\nthe "subjectivity" of principles. \n\n	For reference see Matthew 5 where Jesus explains the difference\n	between the Law and the principles of the Law.  For example, in\n	verses 21-22:  "You have heard that the ancients were told,\n	'You shall not commit murder'...and 'Whoever commits murder shall\n	be liable to the court.'  But I say to you that everyone who is\n	angry with his brother shall be liable to the court..."\n\nThe "objective morality" of God gets blurred by our inept\ninterpretation of it.  We [Christians] have made our biggest errors\nwhen we have allowed any one person or group of people decide EXACTLY\nwhat God intended for us.  If we [Christians] would stay committed to\nseeking God's will instead of trying to prove we already had it all\nfigured out, we might do a better job of allowing others to find God's\n"objective morality" for themselves.  If Jesus is who he said he\nwas/is (and that's the fundamental question,) then HE IS "objective\nmorality."

And what implied "good" are you doing for other\nChristians?\n\nAt least some of what you are teaching has been demonstrated as\nwrong.  Has it ever occured to you that you may be doing more harm\nthan good to your fellow Christians?\n\nBTW, I used to think like Frank does.  I went to a fundamentalist\nchurch for a while.  I didn't start to really think about what\nthey were saying until I noticed a "God's Science" phamphlet\nthere.  I read it and noticed that the authors of it knew virtually\nnothing about Science.  I asked church members some questions about\n"theories" from the phamphlet and got only deceptive answers.  I\nbegan to notice a very similar style of "answers" for theological\nquestions as well.  The only conclusion I could reach was that\nthese peoples' beliefs about the Bible were about as valid as\ntheir beliefs in their God's Science phamphlet.\n\n: If there are still people out there who think that my purpose here\n: is to "attack the Bible," (an accusation Frank once made) I would point\n: out that I have also criticized people who have posted "bible\n: contradictions" that turn out to be silly, out of context, or easily\n: (and legitimately) reconciled.  I'm not attacking the Bible, but \n: intellectual dishonesty *about* the Bible, from either side.\n\nIf one of the primary purposes of Christians is to seek out truth,\nhow can people condemn you for doing this?
JOB 26:7  He stretcheth out the north over the empty  place,  and\nhangeth the earth upon nothing.
Lev 17:11: For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given\n  it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is\n  the blood that makes atonement for the soul.\n\nThe Old Testament was very big on the "eye for an eye" business.  It\nmakes sense that Leviticus would support physical injury to "repay"\nmoral wrongdoing.\n\nI know about sanctification.  I've been taught all about it in Sunday\nschool, catechism class, and theology classes.  But even after all\nthat, I still can't accept it.  Maybe I'm still not understanding it,\nor maybe I'm just understanding it all too well.\n\nFrom the bottom of my heart I know that the punishment of an innocent\nman is wrong.  I've tried repeatedly over the course of several years\nto accept it, but I just can't.  If this means that I can't accept the\npremise that a god who would allow this is 'perfectly good', then so\nbe it.\n\n\nIf you can explain to me why the death of Jesus was a *good* thing,\nthen I would be very glad to hear it, and you might even convert me.\nBe warned, however, that I've heard all the most common arguments\nbefore, and they just don't convince me.
There has been a lot of discussion about Tyre.  In sum, Ezekiel prophesied\nthat the place would be mashed and never rebuilt; as there are a lot of\npeople living there, it would appear that Ezekiel was not literally correct.\n\nThis doesn't bother me at all, because I understand the language Ezekiel used\ndifferently than do so-called Biblical literalists.  For example, it sometimes\nhappens that someone says "My grandson is the cutest baby!" and then turns\naround and sees the granddaughter and says "Oh!  Isn't she the cutest thing!?"\n\nThis person is not literally claiming to have lined up all the babies in the\nworld according to cuteness and discovered his own grandchildren tied for\nfirst.  Rather, he is trying to express his emotions using words that are very\nobject-oriented.  Because this example is one that is common to many people,\nnobody misunderstands the intent of the statements; the Bible, however, is\noften at the mercy of people who assume that everything within must be exactly\nliterally true.  For those people, the existence of Tyre is a problem; for me,\nit is not.\n\n\nTurning to the latest person trying to defend Ezekiel, we read this from\nJohn E King:\n\n\nNo, it implies nothing of the kind.  If you had nothing but the prophecy from\nEzekiel, and you were told you interpret it literally, you would never say\n"Oh, he means that there will be houses and businesses and plants and stuff\nlike that."  You would read "I will make you a bare rock" and "You will never\nbe rebuilt", and you'd conclude that Tyre would be a bare rock.  The only way\nto get from `fishing nets' to `houses and buildings and a medium-large\npopulation' is if you KNOW that all that latter stuff is there.\n\nIn other words, your answer means that Ezekiel misled everybody who read the\nprophecy at the time it was written.  There is no way that, given a literal\nreading, they could read this passage and conclude "medium-size city".\n\nYou seem to feel that "Never be rebuilt" means "be rebuilt" -- maybe so, but\nit is hardly a `clear implication'.\n\n\n\n\nWell, no.  That's only a bit less than the population of Annapolis, where I'm\nfrom.  You know, the Naval Acadamy, the state capital, George Washington\nresigned his commission in the statehouse?  Annapolis may not be New York, but\nit's at least a two-horse town.\n\nBut supposing 22,000 people is a "small town" -- it's still 22,000 people\nMORE than Ezekiel predicted.\n\n\nAnd you've said nothing about the other problem.  In chapter 26, Ezekiel\npredicts that Nebuchadnezzar will will destroy Tyre and loot all their\nvaluables.  However, Nebuchadnezzar did NOT destroy Tyre, and in chapter 29\nEzekiel even quotes God as saying "he and his army got no reward from the\ncampaign he led against Tyre."\n\nLet's ignore Alexander for a moment, and just pay attention to chapter 26.\nEzekiel says N. would destroy Tyre, and N. did NOT destroy Tyre.  Ezekiel says\nthat N. would plunder their valuables, but N. did NOT plunder their valuables.\n\nRegardless of what you think about Tyre _now_, the fact is that N. died before\nthe place was destroyed.  Ezekiel said N. was going to do it, and N. did not.\n\n *\n\nThis post is, of course, pointless.  Inerrantists have an amazing ability\nto rewrite the Bible as needed to fit whatever they want it to say.\n\nFor example, I expect Mr King to respond to the comments about Ezekiel 26\nby pulling some "clear implications" out of hat.\n\nWhen Ezekiel said that N. would "demolish your towers", that clearly implied\nthat the walls would still be standing so people would know where the towers\nused to be.  And when Ezekiel said that N. would "demolish your fine houses\nand throw your stones, timber and rubble into the sea", that clearly implied\nthat N. would never set foot on the island.  And when Ezekiel wrote that N.\nwould "build a ramp up to your walls", that clearly implies that N. would\nspend 13 years stomping around on the mainland and never get close to the\nwalls.\n\nSee?  A few "clear implications" that are totally contrary to the text, and\nyou can reconcile anything you want.

: I will clarify my earlier quote.  God's laws were originally written for \n: the Israelites.  Jesus changed that fact by now making the Law applicable to\n: all people, not just the Jews.  Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of\n: Heaven through the saving grace of God.  I never said that the Law was made\n: obsolete by Jesus.\n\nJust for reference, here's the earlier quote:\nMalcolm Lee (mlee@post.RoyalRoads.ca) wrote in reference to Leviticus 21:9\nand Deuteronomy 22:20-25:\n: These laws written for the Israelites, God's chosen people whom God had\n: expressly set apart from the rest of the world.  The Israelites were a\n: direct witness to God's existence.  To disobey God after KNOWing that God\n: is real would be an outright denial of God and therefore immediately\n: punishable.\n: Remember, these laws were written for a different time and applied only to\n: God's chosen people.  But Jesus has changed all of that.  We are living in\n: the age of grace.  Sin is no longer immediately punishable by death.  There\n: is repentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.  And\n: not just for a few chosen people.  Salvation is available to everyone, Jew\n: and Gentile alike.\n\nThese are two conflicting statements.  To say one is a clarification of the\nother is a breach of logic.  I don't mind people shifting their position on\nan issue.  It irritates me when it is said under the premise that no change\nwas made.  What about Deuteronomy 22:20-25?  Is it wrong now?  Did Jesus\nchange that?\n\n: If anything, He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made.  In the\n: following verses, Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon\n: the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended.\n\nSure he does this.  However, he doesn't address the notion of stoning\nnon-virgin brides, because this needs no clarification.  Are you going to\ndeny that Deuteronomy 22:20-25 is not patently clear in its intent?\n\n: I think you will agree with me that there are in today's world, a lot of\n: modern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe\n: in it.  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart?\n\nI'll agree that there is a lot of modern day Pharisees that know the Bible\nfrom end to end and don't believe in it.  Depending on how they use this\nknowledge, they can be scary.  They can argue any position they desire, and\nback it up with selected parts of the Bible.  Such Pharisees include David\nKoresh and Adolph Hitler.  I will qualify this by saying *I don't know* if\nthey actually believed what they were preaching, but the ends certainly\nmade the means look frightening.\n\nHowever, just as scary are those that don't know much of the Bible, but\nbelieve every word.  In fact, this is probably scarier, since there are far\nmore of these people, from what I've seen.  In addition, they are very easy\nto manipulate by the aforementioned Pharisees, since they don't know enough\nto debate with these people.\n\n: Christianity is not just a set of rules; it's a lifestyle that changes one's\n: perspectives and personal conduct.  And it demands obedience to God's will.\n\nNo, it demands obedience to a book.  If God came down and personally told\nme how I should behave, then I would say that I would be doing God's will\nby doing it.  However, if preachers, pastors, and evangelists tell me to\nobey the will of a book written by people who have been dead for close to\ntwo millenia (even longer for the OT), even if I follow everything in it\nwith my heart, I could scarcely be honest with myself by saying I'm doing\nthe will of God.\n\n: Some people can live by it, but many others cannot or will not.  That is\n: their choice and I have to respect it because God respects it too.\n\nWell, if God respects it so much, how come there is talk in the Bible about\neternal damnation for non-believers?  I see little respect eminating from\nthe god of the Bible.  I see a selfish and spiteful god.\n\n: God be with you,\n\nNot yours, thanks ;)\n\n: Malcolm Lee  :)\n\nRob Lanphier\nlanphi872@snake.cs.uidaho.edu\nlanph872@uidaho.edu\n\nAnd for the curious, here is my earlier post:
Stop! Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that \nthe first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi \nparty, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red\nherring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of \nthe histories I've read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using \nhomosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that\nHitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse\nofficial history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts\nright. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in\na coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of\nhomosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it\nis possible that the histories I've read have not mentioned this, but I doubt\nit - would it be in Hitler's best interest to admit to the world that his\nformer right hand man was a homosexual?). \n\nAnyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references \nto the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the \nnight of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even \nthe Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case, \nthis does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the \n1920's.\n\n\nAh, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the\nparanoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with \nhomosexuality (at least, not according to what I've read), I'd like to know \nwhat tainted "evidence" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made \nby persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those \naccusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the \n1920's and 30's, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in \ntime and plant "tainted" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers \nwhich were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being \nobvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter\ndo you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in \nthese matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a \nfalse accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point \nhere seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof \nfalls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework \nbefore making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.\n\n\nThis is just about the *only* thing we agree on. \n\nI suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and \nhis SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling\nseems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this\nmust be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what\nlies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this\nis not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If \nyou really think that historians are so incompetent, why don't you write them \nand ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can't tell from \ntheir footnotes? I'm a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and\ntracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not my\nspecialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would\ncast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I'm not going to waste my time\ntrying to debunk someone's paranoia. Do the research yourself.\n\n\nGiven that you already consider all evidence "tainted", what on earth would\nconstitute concrete particulars? And since when have concrete particulars been\nconsidered "shrewd guesses"?\n\nI suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (Irving et al) -\nhistorians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious \nfootnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually \nprovide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail. This is the place \nto start looking. Assuming that one really wants to know the truth.\n\nI'll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already. My\napologies - we seem to have gone off on a bit of a tangent. I forget which gods\nare responsible for keeping strings within appropriate newsgroup subject\nboundaries...
And he went out to meet Asa,\n	And said unto him,\n	Hear ye me, Asa,\n	And all Judah and Benjamin;\n	The LORD is with you, while ye be with him;\n	and if ye seek him, he will be found of you;\n	but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.
I would like to apologize for the typos in the previous post.\n\nIn retrospect I would also like to quote another source: Douglas C.\nHaldeman from his 1991 book _Homosexuality_\n\nTHERAPY INEFFECTIVE\n\nRecently the founders of yet another prominent "ex-gay" ministry, Exodus\nInternational, denounced their conversion therapy procedures as ineffective.\nMichael Busse and Gary Cooper, cofounders of Exodus International and lovers\nfor 13 years, were involved with the organization from 1976 to 1979.  The\nprogram was described by these men as "ineffective . . . not one person was\nhealed."  They stated that the program often exacerbated already prominent\nfeelings of guilt and personal failure among the counselees; many were\ndriven to suicidal thoughts as a result of the failed "reparative therapy."\n\nThe previous article quoted in the last posting is from THE ADVOCATE, June\n30, 1992 called "The Ex-Ex-Gay" by Robert Pela.\n\nSome personal thoughts:\n\nIt is of no great astonishment that there is a concerted effort by a major\nportion of the Church to control and mandate change of a minority among\nits ranks.  This was the momentum behind the Spanish Inquisition, only all\nthey required was a confession of faith (after much torture) and then, to\nsave their souls they would dispatch them to heaven through death.  Even\nlater, the Bible was used vigorously to defend slavery, oppression and\nsegragation of African-Americans, even to the justification of lynchings.\nToday's scholars are just a bit more slick in their approach.  The tool is\nstill coersion, but now it is mostly by means of brainwashing and mind\ncontrol, convincing people that they should see themselves as less than\nGod sees them, then maintaining a cultic hold on them until it is felt\nthier mind-conditioning is complete.  Sure, no one is "physically" forced\nto stay in this "reparative therapy" but sheer social pressure is enough for\nmany to keep themselves in this new found bondage of self-hate.\n\nAs an abolitionist I advocate the abolishment of oppression and persecution\nagainst gays in all facets of civil life.  A person should be judged by\nthe contibution, or non-contribution to the society in which they live,\nnot by some high-brow standard of conformity imposed by those who haven';t\na clue what is in their heart.\n\nFor those who seek more information about Gays and groups that accept them\nplease contact your nearest chapter of PFLAG (Parents & Friends of Lesbians\nAnd Gays) who will be more than happy to assist you.  This is a group of\npeople comprised of Gays, Lesbians and Bisexuals, their parents and friends\nwho have formed a support group for help and understanding.  Try talking to\na parent of a gay son or daughter and learn some "first-hand" real life and\nloving understanding.  God's love and understanding for Gay people is no\nless abundant.

The Nicene Creed\n\nWE BELIEVE in one God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible.\nAnd in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father before all worlds, God of God, Light of Light, Very God of Very God, begotten not made, being of one substance with the Father by whom all things were made; who for us men, and for our salvation, came down from heaven and was incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the Virgin Mary, and was made man, and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate.  He suffered and was buried, and the third day rose again according to the Scriptur\n\n\n\n\n\nes, and ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of the Father.  And he shall come again with glory to judge  both the quick and the dead, whose kingdom shall have no end.
But as many as received him,\n	to them gave he power\n	to become the sons of God,\n	even to them that believe on his name:

I would hardly consider the BD's to be Christian.  They were acting in\ndirect contradiction to scripture.  Jesus' Second Coming is something\nthat everyone will know of.  Jesus also predicted that there will be\nfalse Messiahs who will use His name.  His prophecy has been fulfilled.\n\n\nI agree with you there.\n \n\nMe too.  I have already given my life to God.  If God tells me to lay\ndown my life, it will be to save another life.\n \n\nDo you judge all Christians by the acts of those who would call\nthemselves Christian and yet are not?  The BD's contradicted scripture\nin their actions.  They were NOT Christian.  Simple as that.  Perhaps\nyou have read too much into what the media has portrayed.  Ask any\ntrue-believing Christian and you will find that they will deny any\nassociation with the BD's.  Even the 7th Day Adventists have denied any\nfurther ties with this cult, which was what they were.\n\nDo you judge all Muslims by the acts committed by Saddam Hussein, a \nsupposedly devout Muslim?  I don't.  Saddam is just a dictator using\nthe religious beliefs of his people to further his own ends.\n\nGod be with you,\n\nMalcolm Lee   :)
OK, here's at least one Christian's answer:\n\nJesus was a JEW, not a Christian.  In this context Matthew 5:14-19 makes\nsense.  Matt 5:17 "Do not think that I [Jesus] came to abolish the Law or\nthe Prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill."  Jesus lived\nunder the Jewish law.  However, He was the culmination of the promises\nof the Prophets.  He came to *fulfill* the prophecies and fully obey\nGod's purposes.\n\nVerse 18 says "For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass\naway, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law,\nuntil all is accomplished."  The key to this verse IMHO is the last \nphrase.  Jesus, as the fulfillment of the law, "accomplished" what the \nLaw was supposed to accomplish.  \n\nVerse 19:  "Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments,\nand so teaches others, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven;\nbut whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the\nkingdom of heaven."  Taken in the context of Jesus teaching Jewish \npeople about living lives under the law, this makes sense.\n\nIn general, it appears that Jesus is responding to some criticism he \nmust have received about "doing away with the Law."  That was not \nJesus' intent at all.  He had come to earth to live the Law as it \nshould be lived and fulfill the promises made by God to his \npeople all the way back to Eve [Gen 3:15-The serpent will bruise your \nheel, but *He* will bruise his head.]  Jesus appeared to be "doing \naway with the Law" because he did not honor the traditions of men as \nequal to the Law of God.  He regularly locked horns with the religious \nleaders of the day because he would not conform to *their* rules, only \nGod's Law.\n\nIn the Matthew passage Jesus is defending his dedication to the Law \nand defending himself against his accusors.  Almost the entire Sermon \non the Mount (Matt. 5-7) is dedicated to helping the Jewish people \nunderstand the true intent of the Law, sweeping away the clutter which \nhad been introduced by the Pharasees and their traditions.\n\nIn Galatians 3:23-26, Paul describes the relationship of Jesus to the \nLaw in this way:\n\n[23] But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being \nshut up to the faith which was later to be revealed.  [24] Therefore \nthe Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, that we may be \njustified by faith.  [25]  But now that faith has come, we are no \nlonger under a tutor.  [26] For you are all sons of God through faith \nin Christ Jesus.\n\nI believe this says that after Christ was revealed, the Law had \nserved it's purpose, i.e. "our tutor to lead us to Christ," and\nnow, "we are no longer under a tutor."  The law has been "fulfilled" \nas Christ said he would do.\n\nGod, the author of the old Law, and the Christ/Man, Jesus, are the same\npersonality.  Therefore, the old Law and the new Testament (the "last\nwill and testament" of Jesus) are based on the same moral principles. \nIt makes sense that many of the principles in the old Law are\nre-expressed in Christianity. \n\nOn the other hand, now that the Law has fulfilled it's purpose and \nChristians relate to God through Christ, not the Law, it also makes \nsense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to \nrepresent the "mysteries" of this new relationship.  i.e. Baptism \nrepresenting Christ's death, burial, and resurrection (Rom. 6:3-8),\nThe Lord's supper as a memorial to His sacrifice (I Cor. 11:26), and\nSunday as a day of worship commemorating His resurrection (Matt 28:1ff,\nActs 20:7)\n\nOK, That's one Christian's explanation.  I don't claim to have all\nthese issues completely settled even in my own mind and I welcome\nother Christians to offer other alternatives.\n\nPlease excuse the long posting.  Thanks for your interest if you have read \nthis far...

Atoms are not objective.  They aren't even real.  What scientists call\nan atom is nothing more than a mathematical model that describes \ncertain physical, observable properties of our surroundings.  All\nof which is subjective.  \n\nWhat is objective, though, is the approach a scientist \ntakes in discussing his model and his observations.  There\nis no objective science.  But there is an objective approach\nwhich is subjectively selected by the scientist.  Objective\nin this case means a specified, unchanging set of rules that\nhe and his colleagues use to discuss their science.\n\nThis is in contrast to your Objective Morality.  There may be an\nobjective approach to subjectively discuss your beliefs on\nmorality.  But there exists no objective morality.\n\nAlso, science deals with how we can discuss our observations of \nthe physical world around us.  In that the method of discussion\nis objective ( not the science; not the discussion itself ).\n\nScience makes no claims to know the whys or even the hows sometimes\nof what we can observe.  It simply gives us a way to discuss our\nsurroundings in a meaningful, consistent way.\n\nI think it was Neils Bohr who said (to paraphrase) Science is what\nwe can _say_ about the physical world.

You could argue that if you wanted, but I think a more reasonable \nargument would point out the fact that the remembrance feast was\nvery similar to the Pesach (Passover) meal during Seder, a very\nJewish ritual.\n \nThe fact that there appears to be an abuse in the early Church of\npeople eating too much (a very real concern with some Passover meals)\nand not treating the meal with respect, shows the simplifying of the\nritual to just bread and wine to be a way of dealing with the\ninherent problems of people's human nature, and trying to keep the\nessentials of the remembrance aspects.

The first means that some aspect of reality contains objective values.\nThe second means that values are a reference to some preference of the\nindividual.  In the first case, it is possible that some future discovery\nmight invalidate certain views re what objective values are.\n\n--
For those missing the context of this thrilling discussion between\nJim and I, Jim wrote the following to me in e-mail after I pointed out\nthat he (Jim) had taken a quote out of context:\n\nHe directed a similar accusation of hypocrisy, again based on a lack of\nresponse to an article by Robert Weiss, toward Stephen.\n\nI pointed out that I did, in fact, agree that both Robert Weiss and\nJim Meritt took quotes out of context.  Hence, I find it difficult to\nunderstand why Jim thinks I am a hypocrite.  Needless to say, I don't\nhave time to reply to *every* article on t.r.m. that takes a quote\nout of context.  \n\nI asked Jim the following:\n\nJim replied by saying \n\nBut today we find four articles from Jim, one of which has the subject\n"Silence is concurrence":  \n\n\nWhich is, of course, a complete red herring.  Taking quotes out of\ncontext isn't a crime.  I don't have time to read every article on\nt.r.m., and I'm certainly under no obligation to reply to them all.\n\nDoes "silence is concurrence" imply that Jim thinks that because I\ndidn't respond to Weiss' articles I must condone Weiss' taking quotes\nout of context?  Jim doesn't want to give a direct answer to this\nquestion; read what he has written and decide for yourself.\n\n\nBut back to the context of my conversation with Jim.  Jim's next \ngambit was to claim that he was using inductive logic when he\nconcluded that I was being a hypocrite.  I challenged him to provide\nthe details of that logic that led him to an incorrect conclusion.\nToday we find another obscure article (posting it twice didn't help\nmake it more clear, Jim), titled "Inductive Logic":\n\n\nMore red herrings.  Could Jim mean that he has read an uncountably large\nnumber of my articles?  Could Jim mean that because I "axed" his articles,\nbut not Weiss' articles, he wants to conclude inductively ...\nWell, I can't see where he is going with this.\n\nBut I can help him with his induction.  I've written roughly 80\narticles since January.  The vast majority of them are discussions with\nFrank DeCenso and other inerrantists, where I take the position that\nthey are making bad arguments.  Some are discussions with Jim Meritt\nwhere I take the position that he is making bad arguments (a straw man\nargument earlier, and taking quotes out of context more recently.)\n\nThink hard about this Jim.  See the pattern?  Think harder.  Run it\nthrough your induction engine and see what pops out.

I live in Colorado, and have never heard of such a group.  Obviously claims \nthat their posters are appearing "all over Colorado" are a tad overdone... \n\n\nHardly.  Saying that homosexuality is a sin is a far cry from \n"Working for a fag-free America".  Saying that I wouldn't want \na homosexual babysitting for my kids doesnt mean I endorse \n"Against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash".  \n\n\nAnd now we have homosexual advocates telling us that if we don't teach \nour kids that homosexuality is natural and a perfectly acceptable \nalternative lifestyle, then they will have it done for us.  No, thanks. \n\n\nAbsolutely.  And the message is always, "go and sin no more".  Not, \nGo and do whatever "feels good". \n\n\n\nThis sounds real nice, but struck me as a little odd.  You're \npresenting yourself as if you were a straight Xian, who is sticking\nhis neck out and taking on the challenge of speaking out in support \nof gays in the church.  But I was under the impression that you\nyourself are gay.  That's all well and fine, but presenting yourself \nas sticking out your neck to help "repressed others" seems a bit \nuntruthful under the circumstances....

Yes, this is certainly one of the traditional ideas about the Mithraic\ncult (although not the only one.)  It had many elements that seem\nto have been borrowed by Catholicism (e.g. the Mass, communion, the\nsharing of a sacred meal, consecration of bread and wine, etc.)\n\nFor quite an amusing novel that uses this same idea, check out:\n\nThe Covenant of the Flame\nby David Morrell.\n\nIt has some quite interesting occult bits, and lots of killing.\nI won't spoil it by revealing the ending, but I will say that it\nis relevant to Mithraism.
So it was a complete non-sequitur, is that it?     How does coming\nup with a derisory deal tell us anything about the existence of\n"objective" values.\n\nYou're asking us to accept that the deal you offered would be turned\ndown, and we believe that, not because we appeal to objective values\nbut becasue we know, or think we know, something about people.\n\nAll the people we know exhibit *subjective* values that would lead\nthem to reject a deal of $1 for all of the land in America.\n\nGreat.   Now, so what?
Okay, I'll bite. I should probably leave this alone, but what the heck...\n\n\nBut didn't he credit the actual flag design to a party member - some dentist or\nother? I believe he gives such credit in Mein Kampf.\n\n\nWell, I'm no expert, but all of the histories of Nazi Germany assert this. They\nmake reference to several scandals that occurred long before "the night of the\nlong knives". The impression that I got was that homosexuality in portions of\nthe SA was common knowledge. Also, a book (by a homosexual author whose name\nescapes me at the moment) called "Homosexuals in History" asserts that Roehm\nand Heines were homosexuals, as well as others in Roehm's SA circle.\n\n\nWell, you're the one who is in Germany. If you don't believe the history books,\nlook up the primary sources yourself. Those of us outside of Germany do not\nhave access to these. You do. It seems to me that there were plenty of\ndocumented instances - several scandals, the fact that on the "knight of the\nlong knives" several SA members (including Heines) were found sleeping\ntogether, etc. Also I believe some people were complaining about the SA's\nhomosexual activities (seducing young boys, etc). The histories that I've \nread make a very convincing case. None of this sounds like urban legend to me. \n\n\nI know next to nothing about Irving and nothing about Funk. What precisely do\nyou know, that would contradict all of the other history books that I have\nread concerning the existence of homosexual Nazis? Are you trying to say that \nall historians are taking part in an anti-homosexual smear? What about \nhomosexual writers who agree with the official history? Don't you think they \nwould have found out the truth by now if Roehm and Heines were not homosexuals?\nI would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from Nazism. No one \nshould use any connection between the two to bash homosexuals in any case. \n\n\nIf you are going to challenge *all* historians on this point (not just Irving),\nthen the burden of proof is on you. Track down the references. Find out where\nthe stories originate from. Again, you are the one in Germany, close to\narchival material - most people on the net are not.\n\n\nEh? What is your agenda here? To prove that the Nazis were heterosexuals, so\nthat you can bash heterosexuals? Does it bother you that some of the Nazis\nmight have been homosexuals? Does this make all homosexuals bad if this is\ntrue? Of course not. And what about bisexuals? Are they half-Nazis?\n\nI don't know why it would be so difficult to believe that some Nazis were\nhomosexuals. The German officer corps before WW1, for instance, was notorious\nfor its homosexuality. There were numerous scandals which rocked the German\ngovt. during the late 19th and early 20th century. Many of the Kaiser's friends\nwere prosecuted - the Kaiser was no homosexual, but the Germany army had a long\ntradition of tolerating homosexuality, going far back into Prussian history -\nback to Frederick the Great at least, who was himself a homosexual. Roehm was a \nproduct of this Prussian officer tradition, and the old German army (like the\nEnglish public school system), being a well known center of homosexuality,\nwould have been quite willing to overlook Roehm's homosexuality.\n\nIn addition, some Nazis complained of homosexuality in the Hitler Youth. The\nHitler Youth swallowed up all pre-Nazi youth groups, and some of the various \npre-war Vandervogel, Bund, and Volkish youth groups were known to promote \nhomoerotic ideals and friendship, and in many cases, homosexuality itself. So \nit seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual Nazis, \nregardless of the official Nazi dogmas concerning the "evils" of homosexuality.\nWhy should this suprise anyone? Homosexuality has always existed, in all \nsocieties - it would be most unusual if the Nazis were an exception.\n\nNo, I don't have any sources for you, as I think the only kind of proof you\nwill accept would be citations from archival material, and I do not have access \nto these. Nor do I intend to reread every book on the Nazis and on modern\nhomosexuality that I have ever read - I don't have the time. Nothing is\nstopping you, however, from chasing down those sources. Until you prove\notherwise, though, I will stick with the established histories.
/(hudson)\n/Yes you do.  Who is to say that it is immoral for onesself to experience\n/pain or to be hurt in some other way.  Maybe unpleasant, but that doesn't\n/say anything about morality.\n\nIt violates free will, Hudson.\n\n\n\n(me)\n\n/(hudson)\n/Why is making someone a less productive member of society immoral?\n\nHudson, you are screwing up again.  Morality does not (I say again, DOES\nNOT) define only "right and wrong".  It also defines "acceptable social\nbehavior", without any overtones of good and evil.  Picking up your trash\nis not really a right/wrong moral issue in the eternal sense of Good\nand Evil.  Yet it is moral in the sense that it is acceptable social\nbehavior".  \n\nYour definition of the word "morality" is what is causing you to trip over \nyourself here.\n\n\n\n\n/(me)\n/And since\n/>I, selfish being that I am, want to maximize my gains from society, I will\n/>not do anything to another member of society if that action might cut down\n/>on how much benefit I can derive from society.\n\n/(hudson)\n/Why is your benefit somehow related to morality.\n\nAgain, your definition is causing you to shoot yourself in the foot.\n\n\n\n\n\n/(hudson)\n/What about if someone feels that their own personal benefit is enhanced\n/more than it would be damaged by depleting the overall resources of society?\n/Maybe something might hurt society, but it would help him immensly?\n\nThat is irrational thinking.  \n\nThere may also be people out there who think that death by atomic \ndestruction is  a sublime and wonderful thing. I am not going to let them\nexecute that idea just because they want to do it. \n\nSimply because I let people make up their minds about what morals they\nhave doesn't prevent me from spotting and stopping a madman when I see\none, Hudson.  And even then, I will only stop him when he interferes \nwith me and my life.  That is the difference between me and you:  you\nwant to interfere in people's lives even when they aren't affecting\nyou.  \n\n\n\n\n\n/(hudson)\n/The central character in Dostoevsky's novel, Crime and Punishment, \n/(R something or other) reasoned that if killed this old Jewish woman and\n/stole her money to educate and establish himself financially, he could\n/make a great contribution to society.  He reasoned that she was not of \n/much profit to society.  She just collected rents, and hoarded money.\n\n\nOne of the central points of any (that's ANY) moral system is that is\nhas to be internally consistent.  \n\nBy killing her, the character had to accept the premise that the ends\njustify the means.  If he accepted that premise, then (in order to be\nconsistent), he must accept the idea that some day another person may\napply the same standard to HIS life.  Now, if he is unwilling to accept\nthis premise (which he will not be willing to accept), then he has\nbehaved inconsistently with his own moral standard.\n\n\n\n\n\n/(me)\n/[football example deleted]\n\n/(hudson)\n/Now suppose a freshman on the bench will only get to play if one of the\n/players in the field/on the court is injured (or killed.)  This freshman\n/wants to play in the big game so a talent scout can see him.  If he hurts\n/a player on the team, it might slightly lessen the chances of the team to\n/win, but he might gain great personal benefit.  So, operating on purely\n/selfish (immorally selfish) motives, he arranges for a sniper to shoot a\n/team player in the leg.  He gets to play in front of the talent scout.\n\n/Did that freshman behave morally?\n\n/Selfish intentions may sometimes generate (apparently) moral actions, but\n/not always.\n\n\n\nTwo problems right off the bat:\n\n1.  The problem with your analogy is that it doesn't address the goal\nthat I started with:  winning the game.  Playing in front of the talent\nscout != winning the game.  Try creating the same analogy and keep the\nultimate goal the same, will you?
And I maintain:\n\nSome people do not want to enter into the light and the knowledge that\nthey alone are their own masters, because they fear it; they are too\nafraid of having to face the world on their own terms.  And so, by\ntheir own choice, they will remain in darkness, sort of like bugs\nunder a rock.  However, some people, but not many, will not like the\ndarkness.  Sometimes it gets too cold and too dark to be comfortable.\nThese people will crawl out from under the rock, and, although blinded\nat first, will get accustomed to the light and enjoy its warmth.  And,\nafter a while, now that they can see things for what they really are,\nthey will also see the heights which they can reach, and the places\nthey can go, and they will learn to choose their own paths through the\nworld, and they will learn from their mistakes and revel in their\nsuccesses.\n\nThey will see that there is much much more to the world than just the\nnarrow experiences under the rock.  They will discover that life under\na rock was incredibly yucky, and that life on their own terms is great\n-- so great that they will want to tell everyone else about it.\n\nDo you see my point?  I think you're the one under the rock, and I'm\ngetting a great tan out here in the sunlight.  My life has improved\nimmesurably since I abandoned theism -- come and join me!  It will be\na difficult trip at first, until you build up your muscles for the\nlong hike, but it's well worth it!\n\n\nLook, you just practically equated Odin and Zeus?  They're as much\ndifferent as your god is from them...\n\nDon't you see?  I'm not going to accept ANYTHING that I can't witness\nwith my own eyes or experience with my own senses, especially not\nsomething as mega-powerful as what you're trying to get me to accept.\nSurely if you believe in it this strongly, you must have a good\n*reason* to, don't you?\n\n\nWhen did I say that?  I say that I would rather CEASE EXISTING instead\nof being subject to the whims of a deity, but that if the deity\ndecided to toss me into the fiery pits because of who I am, then so be it.\n\n\nNope -- most people are Christian.  Most people are fond of feeling\nthat they are imperfect, of believing that the world is an undesirable\nplace, of reciting magical mystical prayers to make the world nice and\nholy again, of doing just as their priests tell them, like good little\nsheep.  You enjoy darkness, and you're proud of it.\n\nYou may know the Bible well -- but have you read any of the Koran?  Or\nZen writings?  Or Hare Krishna literature?  If you haven't, then how\ncan you say you have an open mind?\n\n\nNope.  You make decisions, enjoy your successes, and accept your\nfailures; then you die.  If you are content with the life you've led\nas you reflect back on it in your final moments, then you've led a\ngood life.\n\n\nPlease do.\n\n\nI'm sorry, I don't feel that sacrificing Jesus was something any god\nI'd worship would do, unless the sacrifice was only temporary, in\nwhich case it's not really all that important.\n\nForget the Bible for a minute.  Forget quoting verses, forget about\nwho said what about this or that.  *Show me.*  Picture just you and me\nand a wide open hilltop, and convince me that you're right.
There's another point to be made. Those who have been inside burning\nhouses know that if they want to stay alive, it's better to run out\nfrom the building. We had one case where an FBI agent *had to \ndrag out a women* from the burning house, she run back in when\nshe saw the forces arriving. It is a good indication of the fanatical\nmind that the followers had -- including having they children burned\ninstead of saving these innocent victims of the instance.\n\nCheers,\nKent
Jesus:\n\n\n\n\nBlack and white.  A spade is a spade.  There is no hidden\nagenda behind this, so stop trying to look for one.   It is an\neasy and as straight forward as it reads.\n\nKent, I am not accusing you of evil things.  Jesus is accusing you.\nAnd it is not only you that He is accusing.  He is accusing everyone.\nMe, you and everyone in the world is guilty.  Whether one\nsees the light or does not seen the light has nothing to do with \nwhether we do evil things.  We do them regardless.  \n\nJesus uses the word "men".  I am included.  Jesus is not soloing you out.\nJesus is making a general statement about out the sad state of man.\nChristians are not immuned from doing evil things.  A Christian \nis just a person in whom the Holy Spirit indwells.  A Christian \ncan see the evil he is doing--because his evil has been brought\nout into the light.  Jesus is not saying that just because evil has been\nexposed, that the Christian will stop doing evil.  If you haven't\nseen Jesus's light, your evil deeds simply haven't been\nexposed to the His light.  You may shed some light on your\nown.  Your human spirit shines at perhaps 1 candela.  But the\nHoly Spirit shines at a Megacandela.  The Holy Spirit can\nshine light into places inside us where we didn't even know\nexisted. \n\nSo do you see Jesus's point?  Christians are not perfect.  Nonchristians\nare not perfect.  Nonchristians do not want to come into the\nLight of Jesus because they will see all the problems in their lives,\nand they will not like the sight.  It is an ugly thing to see how far\nwe have fallen from Jesus's perspective.  Do you think you want to\nknow how really ignorant you are?  Do you think Brian Kendig wants\nto know?  Do you think I want to know?  Ego verses the truth,\nwhich do you choose?\n\n\nAnd I watched Koresh too, an imposter who thought he saw the light, \nwho made sure that the 19 children burned to death, sadly, as part\nof his delusion.  It is even sadder that the people who\ndied with him chose to die with them, and that ignorance was\ntheir downfall to death. \n\nAnd Kent, don't you bury yourself underneath a rock with an\nexcuse like bringing up Koresh--as if Koresh actually had truth in him.\nDavid Koresh was no light and no excuse for\nyou to stay away from the real Jesus Christ.  David Koresh, who\nclaimed to be Jesus, was a fraud.  It was obvious.  David Koresh\nwas born in America. Jesus was born in Bethlehem.  Koresh wasn't\neven a good imposter having missed an obvious point as that.\n\nJesus warned of such imposters in the end-times.  David\nKoresh wasn't anything new to Jesus.  Jesus told us to be\naware of imposters 2000 years ago.  \n\nSo the next time an imposter makes a scene and claims to\nbe Jesus.  Ask the obvious.  Where were you born?  Was your\nmother's name Mary?  If the Branch Davidians asked that\nsimple question, they would have labeled Koresh a liar\nright from the start.  The wouldn't have followed Koresh.\nThey wouldn't have died.  But look what happened.  Their\nignorance cost them their lives.  Their choice to be ignorant\ncost them a lot.\n\nKent, since you studied the Bible under Lutheranism, do you\nnot remember what tactic Satan used to try to tempt Jesus?  \nDid not Satan quote the Bible out of context?  Do you\nremember what tactic the serpent of Genesis used to tempt\nEve?  Did he not misquote God?  What Satan used on Eve and succeeded, \nwas the same ploy he tried on Jesus.  But in Jesus's case,\nJesus rebuked Satan back with the Bible _in_ context.  It\ndidn't work with Jesus.  \n\nDoes what Satan did to Eve in the Garden and what Satan\ntried to do with Jesus in the desert remind you of what\nKoresh did to his followers?  Who did Koresh emulate?\nWho was Koresh's teacher?  Koresh did to his followers what\nSatan did to Eve.  Did not Koresh kill his followersr?  Did\nnot Satan cause Adam and Eve to die as well?  Did not\nthe cult followers believe Koresh even though they knew\nthe real Christ was born in Bethlehem?   Did not Eve\nchoose to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and\nevil despite knowing that it would cause her death?  God\nheld them all responsible--deceiver and the rebeller.  None \nof them had an excuse.

God being unknowable, I can't comment on His motives, but it would be\ndistressing if He allowed us to misunderstand Him through no fault of \nour own.  For sanity's sake we must assume, if we believe in Him at all,\nthat His message comes through somehow.  The question is whether it comes \nthrough immediately to every individual, or is contained in a complex \ncanon that must be interpreted by experts in consultation with one another, \nor is transmitted directly through appointed representatives who are free\nto interpret, extend and modify the canon.  If God's message is indeed\nmediated, the further problem arises as to whether the individual under-\nstands the mediated message fully and clearly.  Since the responsibility \nfor understanding lies ultimately with the individual, we must assume that \nGod in His benevolence guides each individual to the appropriate source \nfor that individual, whereof the person may or may not drink. \n \n \n \nYour example is complicated in our age by the thin line between morality\nand politeness.  You might have said "burp", for burping and swearing carry\nabout the same stigma today.  If you are talking about "taking the Lord's \nname in vain" as a serious transgression, then this example is more a case of \nhypocrisy than of varying moral codes.\n \nIf there is an absolute moral code, propositions or laws in that code apply\nabsolutely and universally, by definition.  Conceivably some moral codes\ncould be subsets of the universal code, as you say at the outset.  So, for\nexample, God's code could include, "Thou shalt not create Beings without\na hospitable planet to live on", but this law would be inapplicable to us.\nNevertheless, we would be entitled to suppose that all laws applicable\nto us are also applicable to God.\n \nBut when you begin to ask what laws might appear in God's moral code, you have\na sense of the absurdity of the question.  Does God make laws for Himself to\nfollow?  Perhaps God is not the sort of being to which the category "morality"\ncan be sensibly applied.

I'm sorry, I thought we were discussing heresy.  I assumed that heresy\nmeant a departure from orthodoxy, in which case generally accepted belief is\nindeed an important issue.  In this case, the definition of the word "create"\nis of great importance, since creation is the issue being discussed.\n\n\n  I should have said "given the Mormon belief."  If you disagree with the\nMormon belief that creation is more a function of organization of eternally\nexistent substance than one of ex nihilo creation, then that is the important\npoint.\n\n\n  Correction: you interpret the Bible to mean something very specific by\nsuch terms.\n\n   It always cracks me up when anti-Mormons presume to tell Mormons what they\nbelieve.  Mormons do, in fact, believe that all people, including Christ and\nLucifer, are children of God in the sense that we were all created (or\norganized or whatever) by Him.  We also believe that being "offspring" of\nGod has a symbolic sense when applied to being spiritually "born again" of\nHim.  Thus the same word can be used to convey different meanings.  This is\nhow language works, Robert, and it's why making someone an offender for a\nword is dangerous.\n\n\n<...>\n\n   On the contrary, Robert, it is not a red herring at all to show that those\nwho rely wholly on the Bible cannot seem to agree on what it says.  You say\nthat one must simply "look at the Bible" to see what it teaches, but centuries\nof people doing just that have sho0wn that no one is really sure what it says.\nAre we to believe that you are the only one who really understands the\nscriptures?\n\n\n  Let me clarify this one more time.  You did not refer to the Mormon belief\nthat Jesus needed to be saved, but rather to McConkie's belief in same.  We\nkeep trying to point out to you that Bruce McConkie is not the source of\nMormon doctrine, and you keep ignoring it. (see below)\n\n\n  On the contrary, Robert, if you are quoting McConkie's words as Mormon\ncanon then the question of whether they are canon or not is of *great*\nimportance.  The fact is that they are not.  Whether or not they indicate\ngeneral Mormon belief would only be ascertainable by interviewing a large\nnumber of Mormons.
Actually, they generally claim that (b) their particular interpretation of\nscripture/revelation *is* this objective morality.  That there are two\nconflicting versions of this objective morality does tell us something about\n(a).  It tells us at least one fake objective morality exists.\n\nThe next logical step is to deduce that any given religion's objective\nmorality could be the fake one.  So caveat emptor.\n\n\nmathew

Well, when you crosspost to talk.origins, what do you expect?
Let us explore this interesting paragraph point by point, sentence by\nsentence.\n\n\n1) We are talking about origins, not merely science.\n\nOrigins of what?  Are we speaking of the origins of life, the human\nspecies, the universe, physical law, biological diversity or what?\n\n2) Science cannot explain origins.\n\nThis is a false statement unless it is carefully qualified.  It depends\non what origins we are talking about.\n\n3) For a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of origins\nis to say that there is no higher truth than science.\n\nAgain, this is a false statement.  To begin with, the notion of "higher\ntruth" is distinctly dubious.  Many people believe that there are ways\nto ascertain truth that are not in the repetoire of science; they even\nbelieve that there are ways that are more reliable and certain.  Many\nbelieve that there are truths that cannot be expressed using the language\nof science.  Let it be so.  These truths are neither "higher" or \n"lower"; they are simply true.\n\nMore to the point, restricting one's discussion of origins to science\ndoes not reject other sources of knowledge; it simply restricts the\nscope of discussion.\n\n4) This is a false premise.\n\nIf this is intended as asserting that the previous sentence was false\nthen (4) is actually true.  However the context identifies it as another\nfalse [or at least theologically unsound] statement.\n\n5) By the way, I enjoy science.\n\nOn the evidence Mr. Rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of science\nto enjoy science in any meaningful sense.  One might just as well say\nthat one enjoys literature written in a language that one cannot read.\nHowever one cannot mark this sentence as false -- to follow the analogy,\nperhaps he likes the pretty shapes of the letters.\n\n6) It is truly a wonder observing God's creation.\n\nLet us not quibble; count this one as true.\n\n7) Macroevolution is a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent\nreligion [guaranteed within three percent error :) ]\n\nStill another false statement.  However one can make it come out true\nwith the following contextual modification:\n\n"Macroevolution, as misunderstood by Rawline, is a mixture of 15 percent\nof what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as science, and 85 percent of\nwhat Rawlins erroneously thinks of as religion."\n\n-----\n\nIt is distinctly noticeable that Mr. Rawlins fails miserably to touch\non truth except when he reports personally on what he feels.  [I do\nhim the justice of assuming that he is not misinforming us as to his\npersonal reactions.]  One can account for this by the hypothesis that\nhe has an idiosyncratic and personal concept of truth.

Jim doesn't want to give a direct answer to this\n}question; read what he has written and decide for yourself.\n\nTelepathy again?  You claim to know what I "want".\n\n}But back to the context of my conversation with Jim.  Jim's next \n}gambit was to claim that he was using inductive logic when he\n}concluded that I was being a hypocrite.  I challenged him to provide\n}the details of that logic that led him to an incorrect conclusion.\n\nNo.  YOu asked specifically what was wrong with yours.\n\n}Today we find another obscure article (posting it twice didn't help\n\nMaybe to the ignorant.  I accept your classification.\n\n}More red herrings.  Could Jim mean that he has read an uncountably large\n}number of my articles?  \n\nDo you know what "uncountably large" means?  It does not appear so.\n\n}Could Jim mean that because I "axed" his articles,\n}but not Weiss' articles, he wants to conclude inductively ...\n}Well, I can't see where he is going with this.\n\nI am not suprised.\n\n}But I can help him with his induction.  I've written roughly 80\n\nThat does not appear to be the case.  The appearance of your "Argument"\nis more like that Captain Kirk would have gotten from Mr. Spock - written\nby a stagehand at Paramount.\n\n}Think hard about this Jim.  See the pattern?

I will clarify my earlier quote.  God's laws were originally written for \nthe Israelites.  Jesus changed that fact by now making the Law applicable to\nall people, not just the Jews.  Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of\nHeaven through the saving grace of God.  I never said that the Law was made\nobsolete by Jesus.\n\nIf anything, He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made.  In the\nfollowing verses, Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon\nthe Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended.  If you'll notice, He\nalso reams into the Pharisees for mucking up the Law with their own contrived\ninterpretations.  They knew every letter of the Law and followed it with their\nheads but not their hearts.  That is why He points out that our righteousness\nmust surpass that of the Pharisees in order to be accepted into the kingdom\nof Heaven.  People such as the Pharisees are those who really go out of their\nway to debate about the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin.\nThey had become legalistic, rule-makers - religious lawyers who practiced the\nletter of the Law but never really believed in it.  \n\nI think you will agree with me that there are in today's world, a lot of\nmodern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe\nin it.  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart?\n\nChristianity is not just a set of rules; it's a lifestyle that changes one's\nperspectives and personal conduct.  And it demands obedience to God's will.\nSome people can live by it, but many others cannot or will not.  That is their\nchoice and I have to respect it because God respects it too.\n\nGod be with you,
You're admitting a lot more than that.  You are admitting that\nyour morals are situational.   You are admitting that the actions\nof other people and the situation you are in help to determine\nhow you judge the moral significance of one of your own actions.\n\nIf you employ X degree of force, that's not moral, but if you employ\nX degree of force, but previously someone else has employed Y degree\nof force, and the situation is thus-and-so, that *is* moral.\n\nThis is quite different from saying "Employing force on other people\nis immoral, period.   Unfortunately, from time to time we are obliged\nto do this immoral thing for reasons of self-preservation, and so\nwe have to bear the moral consequences of that.\n\nFor what it's worth - and yes, I know you claim to be an agnostic -\nit's this ability to re-label things from "immoral" to "moral" \nthat I find one of the *least* attractive qualities of the religious\nmind.
Up to that point I thought you were talking about the\nRosicrucian Order... :-)  [No offense intended!]
There is a rite like this described in Joseph Campbell's\n_Occidental_Mythology_.  He also described levels of initiation, I think\n6?  I don't know where Campbell got his info, but I remember thinking he\nwas being a little eclectic.\n\n\nQuite a bit.  If you haven't read Campbell, give him a try.

Jesus also recognized other holy days, like the Passover.  Acts 15 says \nthat no more should be layed on the Gentiles than that which is necessary.\nThe sabbath is not in the list, nor do any of the epistles instruct people\nto keep the 7th day, while Christians were living among people who did not\nkeep the 7th day.  It looks like that would have been a problem.\n\nInstead, we have Scriptures telling us that all days can be esteemed alike\n(Romans 14:5) and that no man should judge us in regard to what kind of\nfood we eat, Jewish holy days we keep, or _in regard to the sabbath. (Col. 2.)\n\n\nI don't think that the Sabbath, or any other command of the law is totally\nirrelevant to modern Christians, but what about Collosions 2, where it says\nthat we are not to be judged in regard to the keeping of the sabbath?
Mr. Clinton said today that the horrible tragedy of the Waco fiasco\nshould remind those who join cults of the dangers of doing so.\nNow, I began scratching my head thinking (a bad sign :-), "don't the \nmainstream religions (in this case Christianity...or the 7th day \nadventist in particular) just keep these guys going ? Isn't Mr. Clinton \ncondemning his own religion ? After all, isn't it a cult too ?"
What are the consequences of the homophobic ranting of the\nself-righteous?  Well, I just noted this on another group,\nand thought I'd pass it along.

The writer reflects that the\nbehavior reported reminds him of some Christian groups he has\nknown.  I believe that the writer is a (non-homosexual) Christian:\n\n+	There is a very effective technique used to promote\n+	unit cohesion among the Soldiers of the Lord.  It is\n+	called "witnessing"...  I've seen this process used well\n+	and poorly; the near devil worship I mention was a group \n+	... that was using the witnessing to get people lathered\n+	up to go kill homosexuals or at least terrorize them off \n+	campus as it was clearly God's will that they do so.\n\nI have deleted the specifics of the location, as I do not\nbelieve it characteristic of the place (a state in which I\nspent my formative first 10 years), though it *does* have,\nunfortunately, a subpopulation that this remark fits to a tee.

#Rick Anderson replied to my letter with...\n#\n#ra> In article <C5ELp2.L0C@acsu.buffalo.edu>,\n#ra>\n\n(...)\n\n# Just briefly, on something that you mentioned in passing.

The bottom line is\n# truth, regardless of popularity of opinions.\n\nIt may be "irrelevant" to you and *your* personal beliefs (or should I say\n"bias"?), but it is relevant to me and many others.  You're right, "the\nbottom line IS truth," independant from you or anyone else.  Since you\nproclaim "truths" as a self-proclaimed appointee, may I ask you by what\nauthority you do this?  Because "it says so in the Bible?"  --Does the\nBible "say so," or is it YOU, or someone else, who interprets whether a\nscripture or doctrine conforms to your particular liking or "disapproval"?\n\nExcuse moi, but your line of "truths" haven't moved me one bit to persuade\nme that my beliefs are erroneous.  Of all the "preachers" of "truth" on\nthis net, you have struck me as a self-righteous member of the wrecking\ncrew, with no positive message to me or any other Latter-day Saint...\nBTW, this entire discussion reminds me a lot of the things said by Jesus\nto the pharisees: "ye hypocrite(s) . . . ye preach about me with your lips,\nbut your hearts are far removed from me..."\n\n# Also, I find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created\n# and eternally existent are equivalent, you say "granted the Mormon\n# belief..." You can't grant your conclusion and then expect the point to\n# have been addressed.

Look who's talking: "jumping to conclusions?"  You wouldn't do\nthat yourself, right?  All YOU address is your own convictions, regardless\nwhether we come up with any Biblical scriptures which supports our points\nof view, because you reject such interpretations without any consideration\nwhatsoever.\n\n#\n# The Bible states that Lucifer was created.

The Bible\nindeed does teach that not all are children of God in the sense that they\n"belong to" or follow God in His footsteps.  Satan and his followers have\nrebelled against God, and are not "children (=followers/redeemed) of God,"\nbut it doesn't mean that they were not once created by God, but chose to\nseparate themselves from those who chose to follow God and His plan of\nsalvation.\n\n#\n#        The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the\n#        kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked "one";\n#        (Matthew 13:38)\n\nkingdom are those who have remained valiant in their testimony of Jesus\n(and have shown "works of repentance, etc.), and the children of the\nwicked one are those who rebelled against God and the lamb.

I guess your grandiose self-image does not allow for other\nfaiths, believing in the divinity of Jesus Christ, but in a different\nway or fashion than your own.

"What the Bible teaches"?  Or: "what the bible teaches according to\nRobert Weiss and co.?"  I respect the former, I reject the latter without\nthe remotest feeling that I have rejected Jesus.  On the contrary.  And by\nthe way, I do respect your interpretations of the Bible, I even grant you\nbeing a Christian (following your own image of Him), as much as I am a\nChristian (following my own image of Him in my heart).\n\n(...)\n\n#  Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of\n#  Bruce McConkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine.'

The issue of "official doctrine"\nis obviously very important.  McConkie's views have been controversial\n(e.g. "The Seven Deadly Heresies" has made me a heretic!  ;-) at best,\nor erroneous at worst ("blacks not to receive the priesthood in this\ndispensation").  I respect him as someone who has made his valuable\ncontribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personal\ninterpretations (his book "Mormon Doctrine" is oftentimes referred to\nas "McConkie's Bible" in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  I rather\nlook to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley's books!\n(The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkie\nwas a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of\nGod than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted\ndoctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and\nspeculation.  But having said this, I find McConkie (even in his most\nbiased and speculative moments) far more thought-provoking than the\ntrash coming from your proverbial pen.

/(emery)\n/The one single historic event that has had the biggest impact on the\n/world over the centuries is the resurrection of Jesus.  \n\nThis is hardly possible, as the majority of people in the world were\nborn, lived their life, and died, without ever knowing anything about\nChrist.  The majority of the rest of the world have decided that he \nis not who Emery thinks he is.\n\n\n\n/(emery)\n/Why were the writers of the New Testament documents so convinced that\n/Jesus really did rise from the dead?\n/We have four gospel accounts.  \n\nI am leaving out all "proofs" of Emery's which rely on quoting the\nbible as proof.  Circular reasoning, etc.  There have been occasions\nalready stated many times for later generations of Xtians to change,\nedit, or otherwise alter the bible to fit their political gospel.\nAnd if we accept the bible as true just because the bible says it\nis true, then (to be fair) we have to do the same to the Bhagavad-Gita\nand the Koran, both of which contradict the bible.\n\nEnough said.\n\n\n\n/(emery)\n/Yet we have no reason to believe these disciples to be immoral and dishonest.\n/We have no historic information that would lead us to the conclusion that\n/these people were not God-fearing people who sincerely and whole-heartedly\n/believed that the resurrection of their Lord Jesus was a real event.\n/And for what gain would they lie?  To make a stand at that time meant \n/persecution, imprisonment, and perhaps even death.\n\nAgain, this is only the biblical account and there is no independent proof\nof any of this happening.  It just isn't there.\n\nBesides, simply being sincere or willing to die for your faith does not\nmake your faith correct.  There are Muslims dying in Bosnia right now;\ndoes the fact that they are willing to die for Islam mean that Islam is\nthe correct religion?\n\n\n\n\n(emery)\n/History bears out the persecution of Christians.  Roman historian, Cornelius \n/Tacitus, Govenor of Asia, in A.D. 112, writing of Nero's reign, alluded to \n/the torture of Christians in Rome:\n\n\nAll you have proven is that these people were tortured for their faith.  That\ndoes not prove that their faith is true or correct; it just means that they\nwere sincere in their beliefs. \n\nBeing willing to die for what you believe doesn't make your belief the truth.\nIt's not that easy.  And minority religions have always suffered torture;\nMuslims suffer torture and harassment in India and Bosnia today.  All religions\nare harassed in China today.  You haven't proven anything so far.\n\n\n\n/(emery)\n/With all the suffering and persecution that it meant to be a believer, it\n/would be quite probable that at least one of those in the supposed conspiracy\n/would come forward and confess that the whole thing was a big hoax.  \n\nNot if they didn't believe that it was a hoax.  \n\n\n/(emery)\n/Yet not one did.  It seems rather reasonable that the disciples did not make\n/up the resurrection but sincerely believed that Jesus had actually risen\n/from the dead; especially in light of the sufferings that came upon those\n/who believed.\n\nThe followers of Muhammad firmly believed in the miracles that the Koran\nsays Muhammad performed.  They were attacked and slaughtered for their\nbeliefs.  They didn't denounce Muhammad or Islam.  If you are correct,\nthen that means Islam is the true faith.

Tony-\n\nWhile I honestly believe you believe you are doing a "good thing" by posting\nthat piece of propaganda, I believe the more people believe that the more they\nwill feel justified in their blatant persecution of gay oriented people.  I\nhave seen the film called "The Gay Agenda" and along with my church we found\nit to be horrifying.  Not because of what was actually shown (cleaver use of\neditting can create any image one wants to portray), rather becaseu we are familia\nfamiliar with how widely it was actively distributed and how many naive people\nare actually believing the garbage found within it.  The truth is that neither\nyou nor I can fully speak for anyone who calls themself gay, but knowing as\nmany as I do and knowing their testimonies and witnessing thier faith and life\nI have to say that the report you posted is a very biased report, something\nobviously claimed against gays as well.  The truth is that unless YOU are\ninnately gay you cannot know what harm you are causing.  I speak as an\nabolitionist who supports affirming gay rights in our society.  I do not\nsupport wild sex or any other misrepresentations perpetrated by Christian\nFundamentalist extremists, but I know people who are not the sexual deviants\nyour report paints them to be.  It is no mistake that the APA removed\nhomosexuality from it's list of mental illnesses, it is also no mistake that\nthere are many Christians and homophobes who long to bring it back to the list.\nI do not feel threatened by gays, I don't understand why others are.\n\nThe following is an article concerning two of the more popular ex-gay min-\nistries:  Exodus International & Homosexuals Anonymous.\n\nTHE FOUNDER OF AN "EX-GAY" SUPPORT GROUP CHOOSES HOMO OVER HETERO\n\nby Robert Pela (from Gay oriented magazine ADVOCATE)\n\nIn December 1985, David Caligiuri received one of The Advocate's homophobia rewaa\nawards: the A Prayer A Day Keeps the Lust Away citation.  As director of FREE\nINDEED, a national ex-gay ministry, Caligiuri was singled out for offering\ndiscontented gays and lesbians "a way out of the homosexual death-style"\nthrough prayer.  "I'd like to give the award back," Caligiuri now laughs, "I'm\nno longer deserve it."\n  Caligiuri's eight year involvement with the national "ex-gay" movement peaked\nwith his founding of the Phoenix chapter of Homosexuals Anonymous (HA) as well\nas Free Indeed.  He has since abandoned his pulpit and now says that the ex-\ngay movement is a fruitless effort based on deception.  "There's no reality\nin it," he says, "I was selling a product, and my product was a lie."\n  Headed up by national ministries like Exodus International and Courage, the\norganizations of the ex-gay movement rely on the tenents of born-again\nChristianity to convince disatisfied homosexuals -- usually young gay men who\nare just coming out -- that they can shed their sexuality by suppressing their\nsexual urges and embracing Christianity.  "We offer support to people who are\nseeking to leave the sin of homosexuality," explains Bob Davies, director of\nExodus.  He ventures that "about 80% of those seeking to abandon their homo-\nsexuality are men."\n  "Anybody who is involved in the ex-gay ministry is misguided and is wasting\ntheir time," says Lisa Seeley, a former "redeemed lesbian" who worked with\nCaligiuri as HA and appeared with him on the Sally Jessy Raphael show.  "These\norganizations are for people who are spiritually and emotionally wounded."\n  "It's possible to change your identity or your behavior," says sex educator\nBrian McNaught, author of _On Being Gay_. "But it's really impossible to\nchange your orientation.  These people are no longer calling themselves gay,\nbut they continue to have same-sex erotic feelings."\n  Caligiuri says he founded Free Indeed after an ominous week in 1981 when all\nhell broke loose in his personal life.  A few days after his lover ended both\ntheir romance and their business partnership, Caligiuri was sexually assaulted\nby a man he picked up in a bar.  "I was really drunk," he recalls, "and I\nwent home with this guy.  He tied me up and raped me.  He left me tied up all\nnight, and the next morning he raped me again."\n  When Caligiuri was eventually freed by the attacker, he returned home to the\nhome he shared with his ex-lover.  "He had another man there with him,"\nCaligiuri recalls.  "I thought at this time, 'If this is what being gay is\nabout, I don't want to be this way anymore."\n  Caligiuri vowed that if he could find a way out, he would share his discovery\nwith others.  He organized an antigay contingent to demonstrate at Phoenix's\ngay pride parade in June 1985, and a few months later Free Indeed held its\nfirst public protest.  At a meeting to promote a gay civil rights ordinance,\nFree Indeed members loudly blasted gays, telling them ther were sinners headed\nfor hell.\n  Free Indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls a week, thanks\nin part to a deceptive listing in the local yellow pages.  "We were listed\nunder Lesbian and Gay Alternative Services," Caligiuri says, "so people\nthought we were a gay information switchboard.  People would call to find out\nwhere the local bars were, and we'd preach to them about the sins of homo-\nsexuality."  Ruses like this are typical of the movement, Caligiuri says,\nadding, "They'll do anything to reach these people."\n  "David used to go on radio and say really stupid things," recalls Peter\nKelly, a counselor at Phoenix's Catholic diocese AIDS program, "like that\nhe knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors."\n  Caligiuri's family first found out about his ministry when they saw him on\nRaphael's syndicated talk show in 1985.  "They were relieved," he recalls.\n"They figured that if they had to have a gay person in the family, better\nthat I should be a 'reformed' gay person."\n  But Caligiuri was hardly reformed.  "By the time I appeared on Sally's\nshow," "I'd started having sex with men again.  Men would call our hotline\nand tell me about thier latest sin: sex with their pastor, sex with their\nfather.  I was horny all the time."\n  Unable to risk going to gay bars, where he might be recognized from his\nnumerous television appearances, Caligiuri says he "used to go to bookstores\nand get blowjobs."  When he wasn't working the bookstores, he was sleeping\nwith other "reformed" homosexuals.\n  "I didn't realize it at first, but a lot of the HA leaders were having sex\nwith one another," Caligiuri says.  "We'd go to conferences in other cities,\nand we'd be paired up in hotel rooms.  Everybody was sleeping with everybody\nelse."\n  By the time he appeared on 'AM Philadelphia' television show in May 1988,\nCaligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times a week.  When the show's\nhost asked him if he ever "acted on temptation," his answer was a lie.\n  Caligiuri's duplicity began to take it's toll on him, however.  He was\nsuffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis, a dibilitating\nyeast infection, and this led to his escape from the sect.  "I was too sick\nto go to church," he explains.  "The more time I spent away from those people\nthe more I began to feel like myself.  I began to remember who I used to be."\n  Late in 1991, Caligiuri turned Free Indeed phone lines over to a local\nchurch and closed the ministry's doors.  "I'd convinced myself that there\nis no need in the world for ex-gay people," he says.\n  Today, Caligiuri, 31, is studying alternative spiritualities ("I'm interest-\ned in belief systems that aren't judgemental."), considering romance ("But\nnot with a CHristian!"), and searching for a new project to devote himself to.\n"I feel compelled to commit myself to gay causes," he says.  "I want to\neventually stop feeling guilty about what I did and make up for the damage I\nmay have brought to our community."\n\n---end article---\n\nCaligiuri's tory is by no means unique and I have read several other articles\nof former leaders and founders of 'ex-gay' ministries who have said very similar th\nsimilar things.  Fortuantely not all of them have left Christianity, but have\ncome to realize that God loves them despite the attitudes of others.  Some,\nlike Chris Glaser, director of the Presbyterian "Lazarus Project" of West\nHollywood Presbyterian Church have actually been working with the gay community\nto bring them into the sheepfold of Christ and encouraging real ethical values\nof sexuality within the sphere of being gay.  I have also, as I said talked and become\nand become close friends with many who once attended such groups as "Love In\nAction" and others, who either once claimed to have been "reformed" or who\nwere too honest with themselves to live a lie, no matter who was disappointed\nin them.  Some were even encouraged to marry as a way of "sealing" their\nnew heterosexuality, only to eventually start hitting the bars, bathhouses\nand bookstores, since these were usually activities under the concealment of\nnight and one-night-stands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous "sin"\nthrough a committed relationship.  This is a horrible trap which the CHurch\nhas dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people, and the very inno-\ncent victims in these cases are the wives and children of such marriages.  Yet\nthe church insists that there are only two options they are willing to allow\ngay people: 1) heterosexuality or 2) celebacy.  This is sad.  What is also\nmrtifying, is in the cases of those who cannot suppress their desires and\nfear for thier sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church forces on\nthem, they may even opt for 'suicide' or surgical dampering of the brain\nfunctions.  In the past lobotomies and heavey drug suppressants were common-\nplace.  There are now becoming available more and more literature on the\nthreat of coercive Christianity toward gays, such as Sylvia Pennington's\n_"Ex-Gays?  There Are None_. and others.  There are also a great many fact\nbased books being written to help people trapped in this confusion such as\nMaury Johnston's _Gays Under Grace_, and Chris Glaser's _Come Hom!_.  I\nseriously recommend those for people seeking help for this persecution and\nself-acceptance.
First of all as far as I know, only male homosexuality is explicitly\nmentioned in the bibles, so you're off the hook there, I think. In\nany event, there are *plenty* of people in many denominations who\ndo not consider a person's sexual identification of gay/lesbian/bisexual\nas an "immoral lifestyle choice"\n\n\nThis is another misconception. You are not being told the whole story.\n\nMy former minister is a lesbian, and I know personally and\nprofessionally several openly gay and lesbian ministers. I am\na Unitarian-Universalist and like most others in my denomination,\nam pro-choice. You needn't go looking to the Unitarian Universalists\n(which is a liberal religion) for acceptance of your sexual\nidentification and pro-choice views, however; there are many of us\nwho believe in spirituality AND freedom of conscience.\n\nGood Luck on your journey!
Paradise and salvation are not the same thing.  Salvation is better.  Refer\nto John 14:2.
Bill, I find it rather remarkable that you managed to zero in on what is\nprobably the weakest evidence.\n\n  What is probably the most convincing is the anti-Christian literature put out\nby the Jewish councils in the second century.  There are enormous quantities of\ndetailed arguments against Christianity, many of the arguments still being used\ntoday.  Despite volumes of tracts attacking Christianity, not one denies the\nexistance of Jesus, only of his activities.\n\n  I find this considerably more compelling than Josephus or the harmony of the\ngospels (especially considering that Matthew and Luke probably used Mark as a\nsource).
IF it were'nt for the sin of men, none of this killing would have been \nnecesarry, He is KIND and LOVING, but also RIGHTEOUS, \nSIN MUST BE PUNISHED.\n\nBefore Jesus, man had to take the sins on himself.\nBut Jesus died and took it all upon Him, so now we also have a FORGIVING GOD.

Do you question the existence of Alexander the Great, Tilgrath Pilisar III,\nNero, Caligula, Josephus, Cyrus the Great, Artexerxes?   Their documents\nhave decayed to dust too.  Brian, why another excuse? \n\n\nPeter wrote a bit of the Bible.  What Peter says about God is what\nthe Bible says.   \n\n\nConsider the Bible a court recording.  Over the period of thousands of\nyears, various people come up and testify of their experience with the\nliving God.  Up comes Abraham the wealthy rancher.  Up comes Moses,\nonce the high official of Egypt.  Up comes Elijah, a priest.  Up comes\nDavid, a mere shepherd who became King.  Up comes the pagan King \nNebuchanezzar.  Up comes the pagan King of Persia, Cyrus.  Up comes\nNehemiah, cupbearer to the King of Persia.  Then Matthew, an IRS agent\ntakes the stand.  Up comes Luke, an M.D.  Then Paul a Jew who use\nto kill Christians for fun.  Up comes John, a 17 year old boy.  Up\ncomes Peter, a fishermen.  Up comes James, the brother of Jesus himself.\nUp comes hundreds of others.  You hear testimony from fishermen, IRS\nagents, priests, Kings.  The court hearing lasts thousands of years\nwith people coming up and testifying about the God who calls himself\n"I am." \n\nWhile you are listening to all this stuff, you realize that\nKing David could have never known John, Solomon could have never known\nMatthew, Nehemiah could have never known Peter.  You realize that all these\npeople are independent witnesses, and so, you rule out collaboration.  Yet\nall of the witnesses tell of the same God.   Each testifier tells\nof his own experiences with the living God.  Each experience is\ndifferent, but each experience has enough cross-over to unmistakenly\nreveal that each one of these people is talking about the very same God.\nWhat Daniel did not know about God, the 3rd Highest Official of\nBabylon, God revealed to John 600 years later--but with a different\nperspective.  No two testimonies are identical.  Each testimony\ndares to venture off what is already known.  Yet each witness's\ntestimony, even though different from those prior, consistently\ndescribes harmoniously fitting facets of the character of the same God.  \n\nNow.  As we stare gazing at the computer, you got this seeming fanatic\non the other end of the net, saying, I know this God  "I am".  He has\nrevealed himself to me too.  He also calls himself Jesus (John 8:58).\nPlease believe me.  I am telling the truth.  It is wonderful to know him.

What an exciting thread (finally!)\n\nMitra is Sanskrit for Friend, as such He started out as an avatar of Lord Visnu\n mentioned first in the Vedas. Later he seems to have risen to chief prominence\n worshipped by the Persians. Associated with the Sun but NOT the Sun, he is\n the lord of contract honor and obedience, therefore naturally worshipped by\n soldiers. He was ordered by the Sun to slay the bull of heaven and He reluct-\n antly agreed because of His obligation...the blood of that bull spilled and\n grew all earth life...then Mitra and the Sun sat down to eat.\n\nWorship of Lord Mitra ended in Persia with the ascension of the Zoroastrians.\n\nHundreds of years later He was rediscovered and thrown into the Official Roman\n Pantheon (tm) for some semi-tricky reason, I forget why. But all references of\n Him ended abruptly when He was stricken from same, so apparently His worship\n was some sort of vehicle for advancement in the bureaucracy, like membership\n in the Communist Party was in the Soviet Bloc. The sociology of religion in\n ancient times is fascinating!\n\nOh, His B-day was 25 Dec. Ahem.\n\nI am not sure if the mystery cult really lasted after His was booted from the\n Roman Imperial God Roster or what. It contained mostly soldiers, with 7 levels\n of initiation. They worshipped underground in caverns in pews. The bull horns\n in those temples were for scaring away or impaling evil spirits, I'm not sure\n that they had Mithraic significance or not.\n\nI don't know that the ritual meal was of a cannibalistic nature as is the\n Christian masses. But eating deities goes way back to Old Kingdom Egypt.\n\nSomeone mentioned bullfighting. Did Mithraists sacrifice bulls? I forget. More\n likely, for a religious source, might be the shower of bull's blood enjoyed\n by the worshippers of Cybele on the Day of Blood? Cybele worship extended all\n throughout even up to France bigtime.

"Finally, brethern, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is\nright, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute,\nif there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise, let your\nmind dwell on these things."  Phil. 4:8.
[...stuff deleted...]\n\nAndy-- I think we do agree, given your clarification of how we were \neach using the terms fact and theory.  I'll only add that I\nthink perhaps I feel more strongly about separating them,\nthough your usage is quite valid.\n\n\nI'll add here that any falsification or rejection does not in any way\nreduce its current usefulness.  So long as it accurately predicts or \ndescribes things we can observe.\n\nNot to be a pain in the ass, but is there any reason you don't\njust say _the theory of evolution_ rather than the _fact of evolution\nis still a theory_.  I'm asking because this whole thread got started\nbecause I was bothered by a post that referred to _the fact of evolution_,\nbasically leaving off the phrase _is still a theory_.  Without a \nclarification, like the one you just gave, just saying _the fact of\nevolution_ has a very different meaning to me.\n\nI'm not sure I agree here.  Again, it may be because I feel stronger\nabout separating terms.  I was trying to say that the _theories_\nproposed to explain the _mechanisms_ and the _mechanisms_ themselves\nare the only realities here.  It is the existence of mechanisms, not \nthe things themselves, that are so predictive as to be considered \nfact (as you would say).  There aren't really little planetary particle \nsystems called atoms out there.  Or I should say, and more to my original \npoint, it would be a leap of faith to say there are, because we observe only \nthe mechanisms.  There is no need to _believe_ there are _actually_\natoms out there as we have decided to think about them.  It's enough\nto discuss the mechanisms.  At any rate, I'm not sure I am being \nany clearer than before, but I thought it was worth a shot.\n\nThe bottom line, though, is I think we agree on two fundamental ideas:\n\n   1. --evolution is a theory supported by observational evidence (my way)\n      --the fact of evolution is a theory supported by observational\n        evidence (your way)\n\n   2. --creation is just an opinion.  If a theist wants to call it\n        a theory then he can.  I won't:  it has no supporting evidence \n	and it neither predicts nor supports any observations that can\n        be made.  With no mechanisms to talk about, there really isn't\n	much to say.\n\nDo you agree?
I'm not sure what you mean by 'saving face' unless you are confusing\nthe FBI with the BATF who are the ones who were in charge of the\noriginal search warrant.\n \nIndependant Negotiators? What was there to negotiate? Any sort of plea\nbargin has to be brought to the court, the negotiators can't negotiate\ncharges or sentences. FBI negotitators did make a deal for the\nDividians to come out. Koresh showed he was not negotiating in good\nfaith and there is no reason to believe independent negotiators\nwould have done any better.
That is because two creation stories is one of the worst examples of \na difficulty with the Bible.  "were formed" can also be translated "had been\nformed" in chapter two without any problems.  So the text does not demand\nthat there are two creation stories.

Dear Rob,\n\n\nSometimes I do come across condesending, and I am sorry I come across that\nway at times.  Thank you for the reproach, I really do appreciate it.  I'll\ntry to get better.\n\nRob, at the same time, I have also learned that some people respond to the gentle\napproach while others respond only at a harsh rebuke.  Brian K., so far,\nonly responds to the latter.  And I am glad he responds at all.   In both\ncases of approach,  my intention is to be loving.  I am making no excuse\nfor myself if I am coming across condesending.  I apologize for that.\n\nRob, sometimes Brian K. comes across as honest. I know this.  But Brian K. \nvasillates back and forth.  One post looks honest; the next is\nan excuse.  Now he wants me to explain the universe in 50 words or less.  \nI think Brian Kendig is really trying but he is too comfortable with\nhis set of excuses.  \n\nI just want Brian K. to be honest with himself.  If he really wants\nto know, he will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuses\nwhich have nothing to do with my God.   I wish Brian would read the\nBible for himself and come to his own decisions without being\nsidetracked with the temptation to mock God.\n\nFrom my perspective Rob, when I look at Brian Kendig, I see a man\nstanding out in the middle of a highway.  Off into the distance I \nsee a Mack truck heading right for him, but Brian K. is faced away\nfrom the oncoming truck.  He doesn't see it.   Here's is how I see\nthe dialog:\n\n\nMe:  "Brian K, please step aside before you get run over." \n\nBK:  "There is no truck."\n\nMe:  "Turn around at look."\n\nBK:  "No."\n\nMe:  "Look!  You will be healthier if you do take a look at\n     the oncoming truck."\n\nBK:  "No. Explain to me why trucks exist."\n\nMe:  "Turn around or you will run over."\n\nBK:  "No. I won't because I like hiking and tomorrow is Tuesday."\n\nMe:  "You blind fool!  Why do you choose ignorance? You have nothing\n      to lose if you look.  But if do not look, you will certainly lose your life."\n      I do not want to see you squashed all over the road.\n\nBK:  "It is my life to lose.  I rather not look.\n      Besides, a truck running over me will not harm me."\n      And by the way, I really have an open mind."\n\n\nSo is my motivation to belittle Brian, or to love Brian the best I know how?   \n\nI do not wish to single Brian Kendig out.  Because millions if not\nbillions of people fall into the same category.  Perhaps all people\nfall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives.  I have.\nI can now see the truck behind Brian.\n\nMy hope is that Brian will look and will see the ramifications of the\ntruck coming towards him.  My hope is that Brian will want to step out\nof the way.  My fear, though,  is that Brian will instead choose to glue himself\nto the middle of the highway, where he will certainly get run over.  But if\nhe so chooses, he so chooses, and there is nothing I can do beyond that\nto change his mind.   For it is his choice.   But at this very moment,\nBrian hasn't gotten even that far.  He is still at the point where he\ndoes not want to look.  Sure he moves his eyeball to appease me, but his\nhead will not turn around to see the entire picture.  So far he is\nsatisfied with his glimpse of the mountains off in the distance.
Or perhaps it's because they think that all governmental bodies should be in\nthe business of suppressing all beliefs other than their own, or else they're\nsome sort of Satanic Humanist Conspiracy.\n\nIt's the old "if you're not for us you're against us" bit.
Do you consider Neo-Nazis and white supremists to be Christian?  I'd hardly\nclassify them as Christian.  Do they follow the teachings of Christ?  Love\none another.  Love your neighbour as yourself.  Love your enemies.  Is Jesus\nChrist their Lord and Saviour?  By the persecution of Jews, they are violating\nall the precepts of what Christ died for.  They are in direct violation of\nthe teachings of Christ.  Even Jesus who was crucified by the Jewish leaders\nof that time, loved His enemies by asking the Father for forgiveness of their\nsins.  I am a Christian and I bear no animosity towards Jews or any one else.\nThe enemy is Satan, not our fellow man.\n\nGod be with you,

Again, you missed Jesus's point.  If you read the surrounding passages\nyou would understand what Jesus means by "life in the world."  But\nas is, you bumbled around, asserted your standard axiom that the Bible is bunk,\nand came up with the wrong idea.  Also, you do not know exactly\nwhat Jesus means by eternal life.  \n\nBrian K., do you expect to jump in the middle of the quantum mechanics\nbook and understand Hermite polynomials having not read the surrounding\nmaterial?  Why do you such with the Bible?  For an idea what Jesus\nmeans by the world, look up references to it in your concordance.  For\na good description, the whole Book of Ecclesiastes is game.  For \neternal life, check out John 17:3, John 3:15-16.  You will find that\neternal life is quite different than what you think.  Eternal life\nstarts NOW--an infinitely high quality of life living in fellowship\nwith God.\n\n\n\nIf my diety exists, you would not just cease to exist.  Jesus talks of\nhell in Luke 16:19-31.  \n\n\n\n\nThe truth is, is that it is not some sort of magic spell.  The truth\nis is that you do not understand it, and enjoy not understanding it.\n\n\n\nWrong again.  Christianity is supposed to be relationship.  You\ndo not even know what Christianity is and you are arguing against\nit.
DROPLET VOL 1, No 11, Part 3\n\nD R O P L E T\nFrom The Vast Ocean Of The Miraculous Qur'an\n\nTranslations from the Arabic and Turkish Writings of \nBediuzzaman Said Nursi, The Risale-i Noor\n\nVOL 1, No 11, Part 3\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n   		 NINETEENTH LETTER  \n\n		 MU'JIZAT-I AHMEDIYE RISALESI \nA TREATISE ON THE MIRACLES OF MUHAMMED SAW, Part 3       \n\n(continued from Droplet Vol 1, No 11, Part 2)\n\n   THIRD SIGN:  The miracles of Muhammad (SAW)\nare extremely varied.  Because his messengership is\nuniversal, he has been distinguished by  miracles that\nrelate to almost all species of creation.\n    Just as the supreme aide of a renowned ruler, arriving\nwith many gifts in a city where various people live, will be\nwelcomed by a representative of each people who\nacclaims him and bids him welcome in his own language\nso, too, when the supreme messenger of the Monarch of\nPre- and  Post-Eternity  (Ezel and Ebed  Sultani) honored the\nuniverse by coming as an envoy to the inhabitants of the\nearth, and brought with him the light of truth and spiritual\ngifts sent by the Creator of the universe and derived from\nthe realities of the whole universe, each species of\ncreation -from water, rocks, trees, animals and human\nbeings to the moon, sun and stars- welcomed him and\nacclaimed his prophethood, each in its own language, and\neach bearing one of his miracles.\n    Now it would require a voluminous work to mention all\nhis miracles.  As the punctilious scholars have written\nmany volumes concerning the proofs of His prophethood,\nhere we will briefly point out only the general category\ninto which fall fhe miracles that are definite and accepted\nas accurate reports.\n    The evidences of the prophethood of Muhammad\n(SAW) fall into two main categories:  \n\n    The first is called irhasat and includes the paranormal \nevents that happened at the time of his birth, or before his \ndeclaration of prophethood.  \n\n    The second group pertains to all the remaining evidences \nof the prophethood, and contains two subdivisions: \n\n    1) Those wonders that were manifested after\nhis departure from this world in order to confirm his\nprophethood, and \n	2) Those that he exhibited during the era\nof his prophethood.  The latter has also two parts:  \n	2.1) The evidences of his prophethood that became manifest\nin his own personality, his inner and outer being, his moral\nconduct and perfection, and \n    2.2) The miracles that: related to substantial matters.  \nThe last part again has two branches:  \n	2.2.1) Those concerning the Qur'an and spirituality, and \n	2.2.2) Those relating to matter and creation.  This last \nbranch is again divided into two categories:  \n	2.2.2.1) The first involves the paranormal happenings \nthat occured during his mission either to break the \nstubbornness of the unbelievers, or to augment the\nfaith of the belivers.  This category has twenty different\nsorts, such as the splitting of the moon, the flowing of\nwater from the fingers, the satisfying of large numbers with\na little food, and the speaking of trees, rocks and animals\nEach of these sons has also many instances, and thus\nhas, in meaning, the strength of confirmation by\nconsensus.  \n	2.2.2.2)  As for the second category, this\nincludes events lying in the future that occured as he had\npredicted upon Allah (SWT)'s instructions.  Now starting\nfrom the last category, we will summarize a list of them.(1)\n\n(1) Unfonunately, I could not write as I had intended\nwithout choice, I wrote as my head dictated, and I could\nnot completely conform to the order of this classification.
Well, looking at the videos it seems that this fire started in various\nplaces at the same time, which would indicate that this was a planned\naction. I'm sure FBI and BATF didn't *deliberately* start a possible\nfire, having a sniper kill Korresh would have been a far easier \nmethod.

Seems that ignorance has you\nmastered.  How about sexual sins?  Gotta any of those secret desires\nin your head that you harbor but can get control of?   Do you dehumanize\nwomen when they walk past you?  Do you degrade them to a sex object in\nyour head?  Are you the master of that kind of thinking?  Do you insult\npeople unknowingly, then regret it later.  Yet do it again the next\ntime opportunity presents itself?  Are you truly the master of yourself?\n\nI have admitted that I am not the master of my thought life at all times.\nThat I sometimes say things I do want to say, and then repeat my mistake\nunwantingly.  I have admitted to myself that I cannot control every aspect\nof my being.  There are times I know I shouldn't say something, but\nthen say it anyway.  There are times I simply forget a lesson.\nI, in fact, am not my own master.  I need help.  Jesus promised me\nthis help.  And I took him up on his offer.  I have willfully let\nJesus be my master because Jesus knows what is better for me than\nI myself do.  And why not?  Does not the creator know his creation\nbetter than the creation?  Does Toyota know what's better for the\nCorolla than the Corolla?\n\n\nThen I guess ignorance is bliss for you.  Because Brian, you enjoy\nnot having a clue about the Bible.   \n\n\n\nCan you witness motherly love with your senses?  How does caring and\nconcern for you register with your senses?  If nothing registers\nto you other than what you can see, taste, smell, hear and touch,\nthen you better become a Vulcan and fast.  You better get rid\nof your emotions.\n\nAnd I do have a good reason to believe what I do.\n\n\n\nThe topic was about my God and your lack of knowledge about what my\nGod says.   My God says that you will not CEASE EXISTING.  You have\nlife forever.  You can choose to either live it in hell in eternal\ntorment where there is no communication whatsoever, or can choose to \nlive it in paradise with God.  That is what my God says.  And that\nwas the issue.  Your made-up theism is what it is--made up.  It's\nwishful thinking.\n \n\nIs this the religion of Kendigianism?  Most people are not Christian.  Most\npeople, including Christians,  are not fond of feeling that they\nare imperfect.  Is "the world an undesireable place" a doctrine\nof Kendigianism?  It has nothing to do with my God.  Does\nKendigism have magical mystical prayers as a part of its worship?\nMine doesn't.  Does Kendigianism believe that the world will be holy again?  \nMine doesn't.  Does Kendigianism also dictate that one must obey what the\npriest tells them like good little sheep?  Mine doesn't.  Is this\na bunch of lies you tell yourself so that you can justify being \nignorant of the Bible?\n\nBrian, following Christ has nothing to do with the doctrines of Kendigianism.\nYou would find any of your doctrines in the Bible.   I don't follow Kendigianism.\nI follow Christ.   Also, to try to again show you your ignorance\nof Christ and the Bible in regards to "priests",  have you not read about\nthe sole Melchizedek priest in Hebrews 7 and 8?  Have you not read what the\npurpose is of the Old Testament Levitical priesthood and why there should\nNOT be priests today?  Yes, guess what?  The Catholics messed up.  I do\nnot follow Catholicism or any "ism."  I follow Christ.\n\n\nWhy would you want to live a good life?\nTo you, you die and that's it.  Don't contradict yourself.  You have\nno reason to live a good life.  It doesn't do you any good in the\nend.  Your life doesn't do anybody else any good  either because\neveryone dies anyway.  So you have no reason to lead a good life. Leading\na good life is meaningless.   Why do you do such a meaningless thing?\n\n\nHas the resurrection sunk in?  Jesus is alive.  Jesus is NOT dead.\nJesus was sacrified to fufill the Old Testament sacrificial system\nin its every detail.  Jesus's death was like a seed.  He needed\nto fall to the ground so that many new lives would take root.  Did\nyou miss the entire John passage as well?  \n\n\n\nForget that I am a person.  Forget that I know how to type.  Forget\nthat I know how to put a sentence together.  Forget that I know\nhow to send e-mail.   Forget my existence.  Proove to me that I\nexist.  .
Yep, that's pretty much it. I'm not a Jew but I understand that this is the\nJewish way of thinking. However, the Jews believe that the Covenant between\nYHWH and the Patriarchs (Abraham and Moses, in this case) establishes a Moral\nCode to follow for mankind. Even the Jews could not decide where the boundaries\nfall, though.\n\nAs I understand it, the Sadducees believed that the Torah was all that was\nrequired, whereas the Pharisees (the ancestors of modern Judaism) believed that\nthe Torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding of\nthe required Morality in all its nuances (->Talmud).\n\nThe essence of all of this is that Biblical Morality is an interface between\nMan and YHWH (for a Jew or Christian) and does not necessarily indicate\nanything about YHWH outside of that relationship (although one can speculate).\n\n\nThe trouble with all of this is that we don't really know what the "created\nin His image" means. I've heard a number of different opinions on this and\nhave still not come to any conclusion. This rather upsets the Apple Cart if\none wants to base a Life Script on this shaky foundation (to mix metaphors\nunashamedly!) As to living by Christ's example, we know very little about\nJesus as a person. We only have his recorded utterances in a set of narratives\nby his followers, and some very small references from comtemporary historians.\nRevelation aside, one can only "know" Christ second-hand or worse.\n\nThis is not an attempt to debunk Christianity (although it may seem that way\ninitially), the point I`m trying to make is that we only really have the Bible\nto interpret, and that interpretation is by humanity. I guess this is where\nFaith or Relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness.\n\n\nNo. There may be an absolute moral code. There are undoubtably multiple\nmoral codes. The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral\ncode. As an example, a parent may tell a child never to swear, and the child\nmay assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told\nthe child that it is "wrong". Now, the parent may swear like a trooper in\nthe pub or bar (where there are no children). The "wrongness" here is if\nthe child disobeys the parent. The parent may feel that it is "inappropriate"\nto swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front of\nanimals. The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that\nhe is of the same type as the parent (and may be a parent later in life) but\nyou get the gist of it? Incidentally, the young child considers the directive\nas absolute until he gets older (see Piaget) and learns a morality of his own.\n\nDavid.\n\n---\nOn religion:
Slight semantical difference.  The LDS Church does own a heck of\na lot however.  They are the largest land holder in MIssouri\n(where they think Christ will appear at the second coming).

I think this is a weak argument.  The fact is, there are *two* references to\nJesus in _Antiquities of the Jews_, one of which has unquestionably at least\nbeen altered by Christians.  Origen wrote, in the third century, that\nJosephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah, while the long passage\nsays the opposite.  There is an Arabic manuscript of _Antiquities of the\nJews_ which contains a version of the passage which is much less gung-ho\nfor Jesus and may be authentic.\n   There is no question that Origen, in the third century, saw a reference\nto Jesus in Josephus.  There are no manuscripts of _Antiquities_ which\nlack the references.\n\nIt is possible that it was fabricated out of whole cloth and inserted, but\nI don't think it's very likely--nor do I think there is a consensus in\nthe scholarly community that this is the case. (I know G.A. Wells takes\nthis position, but that's because he takes the very small minority view\nthat Jesus never existed.  And he is a professor of German, not of\nbiblical history or New Testament or anything directly relevant to\nthe historicity of Jesus.)

He either set\nthe fire himself or told his followers to do so.  Don't make him out to\nbe a martyr.  He did not "get killed", he killed himself.\n\n\nThe evil was inside the compound.  All that "thou shalt not kill" stuff.
Let's see, if Alexander destroyed Tyre, and people move back, and\nthey construct houses, and after a while 14000 people live there\nand still call it Tyre, it is not considered to be rebuilt.

You appear to be stunningly ignorant of the underlying concept of health\ninsurance.
: \n: Seriously, though, Griffen didn't save the lives of children, and he did\n: destroy the life of a man, so on the most superficial of levels, he's scum.\n: \n\nI almost agree, but Griffen is not scum.  Scum has no guilt or freedom to\nchoose anything.  Griffen does.  God did not make scum when he made Griffen.\nHe made a precious person and this person chose to do wrong.  The same goes\nfor Dr. Gunn.\n\n: But if you are to examine it more closely, Griffen would have preferred that\n: these children were born -- yet AFTER their birth, did Griffen have any \n: assistance to offer them?  Did Griffen intend to support them, educate them,\n: raise them up to be useful citizens?  Did he have any intent whatsoever\n: to help these children after birth?\n: \n\nHere's the real problem.  Americans have become so insensitive to the needs\nof others and so completely wrapped up in themselves that they cannot see\nstraight or think clearly enough to make even the slightest and most obvious\nmoral decisions based on reality.\n\nIf a man abandons a woman to care for their child on her own, he is not\nconsidered to be a very respectable or decent man by anyone.  This man has\nfled his responsibility, has behaved like a lazy coward, and has turned\naway from his responsibility to his wife and child.\n\nHowever, if a woman decides to kill her unborn child to release her burden,\nshe is not thought of in the same way.  When the man abandons, the woman\nsuffers but the child is free to grow up and live a happy and normal life.\nWhen the woman abandons, the child is diced or killed with saline or vacuumed\nout, and the man has no choice, and the man sometimes suffers so badly that\nhe wishes he could trade places with his child.\n\nThs root of this whole problem is selfishness--the arrogance that says, "My\nfeelings and desires are supreme and your well being is not worth dung."\nAnd when you come down to it, this is the substance of what hell is made of.\nIt's the reason a loving God can throw selfish people to the devil and his\ndemons for all of eternity.  Let any one of us unrepentant into heaven, and\nwe'll ruin it the first chance we get.\n\n: Now, I don't really know the answer to these questions, but I've got a real\n: good guess.\n: \n\nAnd, it's probably right.\n\n: And I wouldn't call *that* 'benevolent', either.\n: \n\nIt is a move in the right direction.  As it is now, we don't see our\nresponsibility because we kill it and get it out of sight.  The media\nbacks us completely.  Real responsibility does not sell.  The only\n"responsibility" that sells in the marketplace is that which is just\nenough to make us "feel responsible" without showing anything that\nmight show us our own true irresponsibility.  We want to "feel" like\ngood people, but we want nothing with *being* good people.  Just give\nme the freedom to say "I'm good", and the rest of the world can burn.\nRape and kill my children and throw my parents to the places where\npoor old folks rot until they're dead.  I'll hate my brother and sister\nif I wish and I'll cheat on my wife or husband.  Screw the government,\nbecause it screws me, and don't talk to me about giving to the church\nbecause church people are all a bunch of money grubbing hypocrites.\nBut, I'm a good person.  At least I admit what I do.  At least I love\nmyself and we all know that is the greatest love in the world--not that\na man lay down his life for his brother...That sounds too "christian".\n\nAt the root, this is the substance of what hell is made of.\n\nWe've become a self indulgant, backslidden society no longer responsible\nto our children, to our parents, to our families, to our government, or\nto our God.  This is the root behind justification of every evil, of every\ncorruption in government, of every slanderous remark, of every lie, and\nof every murder.  Society cannot continue to live like this long.  it will\nhave to destroy itsself soon, and perhaps in the end, that will be the\nbiggest blessing this world can hope to see.\n\nWhy do people see so much evil in trying to turn this situation around?\n\n--\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n	"I deplore the horrible crime of child murder...\n	 We want prevention, not merely punishment.\n	 We must reach the root of the evil...\n	 It is practiced by those whose inmost souls revolt\n	 from the dreadful deed...\n	 No mater what the motive, love of ease,\n		or a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent,\n		the woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed...\n	 but oh! thrice guilty is he who drove her\n		to the desperation which impelled her to the crime."

Kermit Tensmeyer quoted from a few sources and then wrote something.\nI will attempt to construct a facsimile of what was previously said, and \nthen address Kermit's offering.\n\nJohn Redelfs originally wrote...\n\n  jr> I learned that a man cannot frustrate justice by repenting on his\n  jr> death bed because repentance is more than a feeling of remorse.  It\n  jr> requires faith in Christ proven by following him, by keeping his\n  jr> commandments.  Such cannot be accomplished on ones deathbed.\n\nTom Albrecht responded...\n\n  ta> So Jesus must have lied to the thief on the cross.\n\nJohn Redelfs wrote back that...\n\n  jr> Paradise and salvation are not the same thing.  Salvation is better.\n  jr> Refer to John 14:2.\n\nI responded to John that...\n\n  rw>    I don't see the effort to equate salvation with paradise.\n  rw>\n  rw>    Rather, I see implied the fact that only those who are saved\n  rw> may enter paradise.\n\nTo which Kermit wrote...\n\nkt> Incomplete reference:\nkt>\nkt> See also the discussion: Did Jesus go into Hell in the BibleStudy group\nkt> for the arguments that Paradise and Hell(sheol) are places after death\nkt> The discussion (no LDS were involved as far as I could see) argued using\nkt> standard Christian argument from the Bible that pretty much support the\nkt> LDS position.\nkt>\nkt>    Christ went to paridise after his death and burial.\nkt>\nkt>    He taught the prisoners and freed them from Darkness.\nkt>\nkt>    When he was resurrected, he had not yet ascended to his father.\nkt>\nkt> The arguement centered around what was or wasn't the proper biblical\nkt> terms for those places.\n\n     I respond.\n\n     The question that was raised was not if Jesus went to infernal Paradise\n     before entering into heaven. No one has made a point for or against \n     that issue, nor have they compared the LDS position against orthodox\n     belief. The infernal paradise is held to be Abraham's bosom (Luke 16), \n     the place of the righteous dead in sheol (equivalent to hades).\n\n     The point that was raised by John was that someone could not repent\n     on their death bed. Tom Albrecht pointed to a Biblical example that was\n     contradictory to what John's position put forward. The thief on the \n     cross was promised by Christ to be with Him in Paradise, the abode of \n     the righteous dead. John's position possibly needs to be reworked.\n     Kermit needs to address the topic at hand.
[...Dr. England's story deleted, it was a nice read the first time \nthrough...]]\n\n\n	It isn't so much a matter of 'interpretation' of Bible texts \nthat sets Mormonism apart from orthodoxy as it is a matter of \n*fabrication*.\n\n	About 20 years ago, _National Lampoon_ had some comic strips \nin them that were drawn by Neal Adams. They were called "Son o' God" comics. \nIt was a parody of the Jesus in the Bible. In the comic, there were a \ngroup of thirteen Jewish kids from Brooklyn, and when one of them said \nthe magic word, he turned into "Son o' God." He went from a myopic, \ncurly headed, yarmulke wearing boy to a replica of the stylizied \nportraits of Jesus --- with long flowing brown hair and gentile \nfeatures.	\n\n	Now, if someone were to profess faith in this NatLamp Jesus, \nand claim that they were a Christian because they believed in this \nNatLamp Jesus, we would have to say that this was fallacious since \nthis Jesus was a fabrication, and did not really exist.\n\n	This is the exact same thing that the LDS do when they claim \nthat they are Christian. They profess faith in Jesus, but the Jesus \nthat they profess to have faith in is as much a fabrication as the \nNatLamp Jesus was.

Good question.  I don't have a nice concise answer, though.  What about the\nchild whose parents are crushed emotionally because he/she starts a carerr\ndoing something they greatly dislike.  It is the same kind of harm, and\nis probably "caused" by the same thing:  The desire of the child to be \ntrue to his or her self.\n\nWhat is more important, being true to yourself or burying that truth within\nyou in order to maintain peace in the family?\n\nhard question, no good answer.

<Moral Driver distinctions deleted>\n\n\nCompare the Driver to an urge such as Jealousy, where there is an urge\nand an "object". The jealousy does not technically exist until the object\nis apparent. However, the capacity to be jealous is presumably still there\neven though it is not detectable.\n\nYour description of the Unbilical took me three passes to understand (!) but\nI get the gist and I have to tentatively agree. I think our two definitions\ncan sit side by side without too much trouble, though. I haven't attempted to\ndefine the reason behind the Moral Driver (only hinted through the essence of\neach Moral). Your definition hints that animals are also capable of a\nsimilar morality - Simians have a similar Social Order to ourselves and it is\neasy to anthropomorphize with these animals. Is this possible or have I\nmisunderstood?\n\n\nMy p.s. thoughts falls roughly in line with John Stuart Mill and\nhis writings on Utilitarianism. I have no particular plan (except to do\nmy bit - personal ethics AND social work). My opinion (for what it is worth)\nis that the Authority for each Moral must be increased somehow, and that this\nwill probably take several generations to be effective. I don't think that the\nlist of Morals has changed for Society significantly, though . The Authority element\nmay come from our authority figures and roles models (see Eric Berne and his\ntransactional analysis work [+ Mavis Klein] for references) and this is what\ngives rise to a deterioration of moral standards in the long term.\n\nI've had some more thoughts on my definitions:\n\nI've was thinking that I should add Moral Character to the list of definitions\nin order to get a dynamic version of the Moral Nature (ie. the interplay of\nthe Moral Code and associated Authorities). A suitable analogy might be a\ngraphic equaliser on a HiFi system - the Moral Nature being the set of\nfrequencies and the chosen 'amplitudes', and the Moral Character being the\nspectrum over time.\n\nConscience is a little more difficult because I can't define it as the\nreasoning of a person between actions in the context of his Moral Nature\nbecause Conscience seems to cut in most of the time unbidden and often\nunwanted. I think Conscience is manifest when a decision is made at a given\ntime which compromises one's Moral Nature. My Conscience fits in more with\nFreud's SuperEgo (plus the Moral Driver) with the stimulous being the\nurges or Freud's Id. The reasoning that I mentioned before is Freud's Ego,\nI suppose. If the Moral Driver is part of the Id then the reason why\nConscience cuts in unbidden is partially explained. The question is "what\nprovides the stimulous to activate the Moral driver?". I think I need some\nmore time with this one.\n\nThat's about it for now!\n\nDavid.\n\n---\nOn religion:
Sorry, but it doesn't matter what _you_ think, I am a Christian, who happens to\nbelong to the LDS Church.  [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints].\n\nI don't usually read t.r.m.  It is truly informative to stop by, and see that there\nare still people in the world like those that forced my ancestors into the deserts\nof Utah, and then out of the country entirely.  (My grandmother was born in Mexico,\nwhere her family had moved to escape religious persecution in the US).  I'm willing\nto admit that members of other churches are Christians, if they believe in Christ and\n(try to) follow his teachings, even though they have different interpretations of \nthe bible.  And yet these other churches often go out of their way to define whether\nor not I am considered to be Christian.  Could someone mail me a set of rules/beliefs\nthat must be followed to be a Christian?  Does this set of rules exclude other large\nbodies of believers?  \n\nI know, this is a waste of everyone's time, this has probably been discussed N times,\netc.  I guess I'm more sensitive to this 'demonization' after what went on in Texas.

sm[?]>a real Christian unless you're born again is a very fundamental biblical\nsm[?]>conversion and regeneration are 'probably' part of some small USA-based cult\n\n\nSome of these "cults", which seems like a rather dismissive term\nto me, are pretty big here in the USA.  Most of them\nare quite respectable & neiborly & do not resemble Branch Davidians\nin the least; confusing them is a mistake.  What about "live &\nlet live", folks?  I'm sure we can uncover a few extremist loonies\nwho are Catholic -- the anti-abortion movement in the USA seems to have a\nfew hard cases in it, for example.\n\n\nI have to agree Matthew with this; I have certainly encountered a lot\nof anti-Catholic-religion propaganda & emotion (& some bigotry) from\nmembers of certain religious groups here.  They also practice their\nmissionary work with zeal among Catholics in the United States, but to\nsomeone who is or was raised Catholic such rhetoric is pretty\noff-putting.  It may work better in an environment where there's a lot\nof popular anti-clericalism.\n\nFollow-ups set elsewhere, this no longer seems very relevant to Celtic issues\nto me.
Very well put.  And, in the case of someone who calls himself a Christian\nbrother yet continues in his sin (and claims that his sin is not a sin at \nall, but perfectly acceptable), what should be done?  Should Christians \njust ignore a sinful lifestyle in order to not offend the person?  By \nreaffirming that the lifestyle is sinful according to the Bible, are \nthey using "a bullwhip to drive people from Jesus"? \n\nFrankly, I find the occurance of a homosexual Christian attempting to \npass himself off as a 'straight' Christian in order to have other \nChristians accept his chastisement better a *lot* more serious than \npeople reaffirming that the Bible teaches homosexuality is a sin.
Tony-\n\nI read your post, it was nothing new, I had seen much the same in other\ntypical"Christian" anti-gay sentimental literature.  Gay people are and will\ncon- tinue to be persecuted as long as such propaganda petpetuates.  You may\nbe unaware of all the statistica "findings" concerning African-Americans that\nhave been published and used by various groups to re-enforce their own bias\nagainst African-Americans.  We usually think of the KKK in these instances,\nbut there are many other groups.  Of course, the vast majority of the public\nscoff at such findings and documents today, but that was not always the case.\nFortunately African-Americans had "whites" who supported their 'cause' and\npublic sentiment was eventually (if not entirely) turned around.  There was\neven a Civil War, and anti-negro sentiment increased.  In fact, until laws\nwere put in place to protect the inalienable rights of Blacks it was pretty\nmuch legal to discriminate against them.\n\nI know many gays and I will NOT turn my back on them or their right to be free\nform discrimination.  You may think that I have been deceived or something,\nthat is your perogative.  My church, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)\nopenly affirms the rights of oppressed people of all segments of society,\nincluding gays.  We believe the Gospel message of preaching to all creation\nand making disciples.  We believe in the Lord's great commandment to Love,\nand we beleive in standing up for the oppressed, even if it is not popular\nto do so.  I really like my church for last reason the most.  I can find a\nchurch almost anywhere in the valley that stands for the Gospel and believes\nin the commandment of Love (though I'm hard-pressed to find many who actually\nsho Love), but not many are willing to champion the oppressed, especially\nwithin their own community.  I may have lost face with the greater Christian\ncommunity for the unpopularity of my beliefs, but so did the abolitionists\nagainst the oppression of African-Americans.  Many were even killed and\ntreated as runaway slaves for being "nigger-lovers" and such.  I guess I've\ndecided the challenge is worth it.\n\nIn my talks with gay men and women I have heard tragic story after tragic\nstory centering around failed marriages, wives and husbands who are straight\nwho have been hurt in the process, etc.  Funny thing is, I don't know of one\ncase where the parents, ex-wives, or even children have continued to reject\ntheir gay family member (son, daughter, ex-husband, father, etc.) after they\nbegan to take part in some form of support group, like PFLAG.\n\nI'm apalled by the legislation which passed in Colorado, and am equally out0\nraged that such slimey people as Louis Sheldon (from the Tradition Values\nCoalition) have been actively working in the Christian underground to garner\nsupport within several (8 I believe) states this coming November for more\noppressive legisation against gays.\n\nPerhaps you don't get it, and maybe you never will.  Many didn't get it in the\nMiddle Ages and the proclaimed God's will be done as they massacred thousands\nin witch hunts and inquisitions.\n\nThe message that comes through, loud and clear, by proponents against gay\nrights and against gays in general, is that there is a strong dislike, even\nhatred for gays, whether you want to call it such or not (it doesn't change\nthe results).  The major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end, the\nfinal effect of posts like that of yours and Mr. Hudson is that YOU have a\n"conditional" love for gays.  Condition:  Change and we'll love you. This is\nsure strange coming from a group who claim that God has an "unconditional"\nlove, one that calls people "just as they are."  Sure there are things that\nwill 'naturally' change, and habits (like alcoholism, wife beating, etc.) that\nneed to be changed through some sort of therapy.  But then there are things\nlike left-handedness, etc. that no amount of beating it out of people, is\ngoing to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to "other\npeople's expectations." In the process this coerced conformity causes many\npeople a great deal of harm, especially when it is caused by people who have\nnothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about their\nown sense of pseuper-spirituality.\n\nThis is sad, but I thoroughly believe that one day it will change.  It may be\nunpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis has to do with\nsomething very personal like 'sexuality' (a taboo subject even today), but I\nfirmly believe in the rights of individuals to be free from impose regulation\non thier bedrooms.  It's funny that most straight people have successfully\nremoved restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation,\nbut we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression...as though it\nhelps us maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society.\nGay people are not criminals.\n\nAnother interesting thing happened recently.  A very prominent charismatic\nchurch in the Silicon Valley (here) had two of it's pastors arrested for self-\nadmitted charges of pederasty (men having sex with boys).  This had apparently\nbeen going on for some time (a couple years?), but since the charges were\nvoluntary, and the church worked closely with the police, so I imagine that\nwas how they managed to downplay it in the media.  How could such a thing\nhappen when the church, itself, has an ex-gay ministry?  One of my friends\nrecently told me he was "approached" by someone who is going through the\nreparitive therapy there, and he was thoroughly convinced that the request for\ndinner was not an invitation to attend the ministry.\n\nThese are difficult times we live in, but providing hostile environments and\ncreating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence is not\nthe call of the Christian community.  The results of the passing amendment in\nColorado has created an organization who's posters are appearing all over\nColorado called "S.T.R.A.I.G.H.T." (I forget the whole definition off hand,\nbut the last part was Against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash) and their motto\nis "Working for a fag-free America" with an implicit advocation for violence.\n\nThis is sick, and it seems to be what you and Mr. Hudson, and others are\nembracing.\n\nWe Christians have a LOOOOOOOOOONG tradition of coersion and oppression\ntowards those we feel don't 'measure up', and constant beratement from\norganizations like The Christian Research Institute, while they do have a good\npurpose also, their major work seems to be finding new and better ways of\nexcluding people.\n\nThe Gospel I believe is not so negative, rather it seeks ways to "include"\npeople.  I have several of Dr. Martin's books and find them quite helpful,\nespecially concerning 'cults.' But it seems that CRI, has become a cult unto\nitself.  Why don't we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring people\nto Jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them away?\n\nWhatever
IMO, a Christian has no need of weapons.  I know it is very contrary to the\nAmerican NRA ethos of the right to bear arms, but Christians should rely on\nthe strength of God to protect them.  Note that I say *should*.  We are\ninherently insecure but I feel that that is not proper justification to be\narmed to the teeth.  A Christian should not have to rely on physical weapons\nto defend himself.  A Christian should rely on his faith and intelligence.\nFor instance, I have the faith that God will protect me but God also gave\nme the intelligence to know not to go walking down that dark alley at night.\nTo jump off a cliff and say that God will save me would be putting God to the\ntest.  And who are we to test God?\n\nGod be with you,

Mr DeCenso, in spite of requiring Scholarly opinion on the hanging of Judas,\nrejects that the scholarly opinion of the those scholars and then rephrases\nthose scholars opinion on the subject:\n\n\nand \n\n\nActually, if you do further research as to the Greek word "apacgw," you will\nfind that it does denote success.  Those scholars did indeed have an excellent\nreason to assume that the suicide was successful.  As I pointed out, I\nrecently checked several Lexicons:\n\n	"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament," Louw and Nida\n	"Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament"\n	"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament," Grimm\n	"Word study Concordance," Tynsdale\n	"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other \n	 early Christian Writings," Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\n	"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon," Perschbacher\n\nA couple simply stated "hanged oneself", and a couple were more explicit \nand stated that "apacgw" means specifically "kill yourself by hanging." A\ncouple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for "apacgw" is\n"strangle, throttle or choke" (which pretty much invalidates the guy who\nsuggested to David Joslin that Judas was hung upside down).  One of the best\nreferences though, "Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New\nTestament," not only stated the translation, it gave both the root words, the\nliteral translation, related greek words which use the same roots, and also\nother presented specific examples of the word in greek literature (to give\nfurther context).  \n\nThe word "apagchw" has two root words: "gchw" is the "to strangle" root, and\nthe root word "apo" means literally "away." This root words is included in\nwords which denote a transition.  It can mean a transition in place (eg: the\ngreek word "apagello" means to send a message).  "Apo" can also denote a\nchange in state and specifically the change from life to death.  Robinson\nspecifically makes comparison to the word "apokteiuo," which means "to kill."\nIn literal meaning the word "apacgw" means "to throttle, strangle to put out\nof the way," and implicitly denotes a change in life state (ie: away from\nlife, to death).  So while the word "apacgw" does mean "to hang," it\nspecifically denotes a death as well.  Thus Robinson is quite specific when he\nstate that it means "to hang oneself, to end one's life by hanging." He then\nnotes the the use of "apacgw" in Homers Odessy 19:230 to denote context.  He\npresents that example of "apacgw" as being used to explicitly mean "suicide by\nhanging." Now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling, without the\nadded denotation of "death," and as you insist that the Bible was written by\nGod, and every word is precicely correct, you are stuck with the complete\nmeaning of "apacgw" (ie: Since the word "apacgw" was used, then death is\ndenoted as the result). \n\nBy the way, I note that Mr DeCenso also presents an example of "apacgw":\n\n\nNote Mr DeCenso, as you say, the Septuagint was a translation from Hebrew to\nGreek, and you have not shown the original meaning of the Hebrew (ie" the the\nHebrew say "and died"), and thus whether it was simply echoed in the Greek. \nIt should also be pointed out that, regardless of the added "and died", the\ncorrect translation would still be "apacgw," as the man did indeed die from\nstrangulation (redundant, but correct).  Further, we have evidence that the\nSeptuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited (which included versions\nwhich contradicted each other), and such editing was not even necessarily\nexecuted by Greeks.  Thus I am not sure that you can use the Septuagint as it\nnow stands, as a paragon of ancient greek.  So, what you really need to prove\nyour point Mr DeCenso, is an example, in ancient greek, of someone committing\n"apacgw" and surviving.  Otherwise I would see you as simply making worthless\nassertions without corresponding evidence. \n\nNow I would note Mr DeCenso, that everytime I go out of my way to research it\none of your apparently contrived exegisis, I pretty much find it false.  Thus,\nI think that if you are going to add to the text, something over and above\nwhat the source clearly says, then you had better have an explicit Greek or\nhistorical source to justify it. \n\nBy the way, as to Mr Rose's statement about trees around the Potter's Field:\n\n\nUnless Mr Rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old, or that\nthere are 2000 year old stumps there, or has a 2 thousand year old description\nof the area which mentions such trees, then it is inappropriate for him to\nassert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two\nthousand years ago (after all, things change). \n\nNow as to your other argument, ie: that the money Judas used is not the same\nas the 30 silvers:\n\n\nTrue, Peter (or the author of Acts) does not specifically call Judas' betrayal\n"an iniquity," but for that matter, neither does John specifically call Judas'\nactions "an iniquity" either.  Further John 13:29 did not say that Judas took\n\n    "Some thought that because, Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling\n     him "Buy what we need for the feast"; or that he should give something\n     to the poor, So after receiving the morsel he immediately went out, and\n     it was night."\n\nNote that it is said that Judas left, it does not say that he took the money\nbox.  Thus when I see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose\nthe a an unproven iniquity, mentioned by another author, in a different\nbook, written at a different time, over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by\nthe author of acts.  I find this forced and contrived. \n\nOf course this particular argument becomes moot, since we have have seen\nevidence that "apacgw" means suicide.  You see, since Judas' hanging was\nsuccessful, he could not have spent the money mentioned in John 13:29, because\nMatthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day (ie:\nPassover), and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself\nthe next day.  Thus the money which bought the "Field of Blood" would have to\nhave been the 30 pieces of silver (Of course he got the 30 pieces of silver\nthat night as well, and thus couldn't have spent that either.  Oh dear, I\nbelieve that the house of cards is comming down). \n\nMaybe we should at this point, discuss now whether Jesus was crucified on\nFriday or Saturday as that is now part of the argument about Judas.\n\nBy the way, as to where the prophesy of the Potter's field came from (ie: the\nmention of it in Matthew), you say:\n\n\nI am reminding you now to discuss it now. It's all part of the same verse we\nare discussing, and I wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestepping \nthese issues.\n \n				Later,\n\n				Dave Butler\n\n	A wise man proportions his belief to the evidence.\n				David Hume, Philosopher\n				An Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding

I recently read an article in a local paper written by an Islamic\n  person who was upset with the way Islam has been portrayed by western media.\n  When a terrorist action takes place in the middle east, it is always played\n  up as an Islamic Terrorist.

Where does it say in the bible that Christians are supposed to persecute\nJews?  Isn't it love your enemies instead?  They may say they are "Christian"\nbut do their actions speak differently?  Do you believe what everyone tells\nyou?  I don't.  I came to believe in God by my own investigation and conclusions.\nAnd ultimately by my own choice.  Salvation, however, was granted only through\nthe grace of God.\n\n\nTo be a Christian is to model oneself after Jesus Christ as implied by the\nvery name Christian.  If you say you believe in your head but do not feel in\nyour heart, what does that say of your belief?\n\n\nWhite supremists and Neo-Nazis are NOT any brand of Christian.\n\n"If you hate your whom you can see then how can you love God whom you cannot\n see?"\n\nWhat does this belief entail?  Believing in Christ and having your sins\nforgiven in His name does NOT give a Christian a free licence to sin.  To\nrepent of a sin is to ask forgiveness of that sin and TRY NOT to do it\nagain.  I am a Christian, but if you lump me in with racists and accuse me\nof being such, then are you not pre-judging me?  BTW, I am of Chinese racial\nbackground and I know what it is to be part of a visible minority in this\ncountry.  I don't think that I would be favourably looked upon by these\nWhite supremist "Christians" as you call them.\n\nAnyone can say what they believe, but if they don't practice what they preach,\nthen their belief is false.  Do you concur?\n \n\nNazis and racists in general are the ones that come to my immediate attention.\nWhat I believe is that such people may be using the bible to mask their racial\nintolerance and bigotry.  They can do as they do and hide behind Christianity\nbut I tell you that Jesus would have nothing to do with them.\n\n\nNo arguement there.\n\n\nThe only point I'm trying to make is that those who call themselves Christian\nmay not be Christian.  I ask that you draw your own conclusions by what they\ndo and what they say.  If they are not modelled after the example of Jesus\nChrist then they are NOT Christian.  If they have not repented of their sins\nand accepted Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Saviour then they are \nNOT Christian.  These are the only criteria to being a Christian.\n\nMay God be with you,
The problem is, your use of the word "objective" along with "values."\nBoth definitions three and four are inherently subjective, that is\nthey are particular to a given individual, or personal. You see,\nwhat one person may see as worthwhile, another may see as worthless.\n\n\nAgain, your form of measurement in this sentence, that being of "worth"\nis subjective. \n\n\n\nWhen I find that my usage of a word is different than the usage of\nthat word given by another person, I try to find a standard against\nwhich to judge that usage. In most cases, the dictionary is the standard\nI use. Here is a definiton of objective:\n\nobjective ADJ. 1. Of or having to do with a material object as \ndistinguished from a mental concept. 2. Having actual existance.\n3.a. Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice. b. Based on\nobservable phenomenon.\n\nBy this definition, science does not have an objective worth, since the\nphrase "objective worth" is an oxymoron. However you asked something a \nlittle differently this time, you asked for an objective basis for a\nnotion. The fact that the use of science as an intellectual tool is\nresponsible for changes in our world (the changes are material, and\nthus "objective") would provide an objective _basis_ for an argument.\nHowever, the conclusion arrived at from that argument (that science is \n"good") is subjective.\n\nI think that the problem here is one of word usage. Take a little time\nand read the definitions of these words: objective, subjective, worth,\nvalue, morality, good, evil. I believe that if you think about the \nmeaning of them for a while, you will have to conclude that there is no\nsuch thing as an objective morality.
/(hudson)\n/If all morality were relative- big hairy deal.\n\nAs I said, you appear to be the only person saying that all morality\nis relative.  Most people I know do hold some absolutes in their\nmoral system.\n\nI >>personally<< believe that the dignity of the individual and the right\nof free will are absolutes.  I recognize that there are some moral\nsystems around which don't accept this; I reject them as dangerous\nand anti-social (nazism, some forms of communism, fundamentalist\nxtianity--no, that's not a slam).  But for the most part, almost\nevery moral system agrees on these two points.\n\n\n\n\n(me)\n\n\n/(hudson)\n/Generally, Christians believe in a Creator-Creation distinction.  Other\n/religions believe in one big whole.   I don't accept yor premises.\n\nToo bad.  I know I'm right, so I get to enforce my view upon you whether\nyou like my premise or not.  And since you can't prove otherwise, there\nisn't even an intellectual basis for your resistance to accepting my\nviewpoint.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/(hudson)\n/I don't think so.  once morality becomes relative, it degenerates.  I am\n/saying that reasoning that it is generally evil to hurt other people is bad.\n/(though I don't think it is sufficient.)  \n\n\nWell, then answer me this:   you seem to be opposed to moral relativism\n(as you call it) because it has the capacity to degenerate.  Obviously,\nthen, you would advocate a nonrelative (absolute) moral system.\n\nWhose absolutist moral system do we choose?  \n\nHow do we come to this decision?\n\nWhat about people who disagree with the chosen moral system?\n\n\n\n\n\n/(hudson)\n/But if morality is considered to\n/be relative, and this rule isn't based on anything, but is just an arbitrary\n/rule, people might abandon it.\n\nFine.  I can agree with most of what you typed here.  However, just because\nmorality gets based on something nonrelative does NOT mean that we have to\npick your xtianity as its base.

[horror story about FBI ruining a guy's life for the hell of it omitted]\n\n\nSo, is this a real story or a work of fiction?  How about some\nsources?  When, where, and in what newspaper did you get all this\nfrom?  Or is it all hypothetical?
If no-one looks at the results, or acknowledges their correctness, in what\nmeaningful sense can the chip be said to "work"?? Does flibozity exist?\nBy "flibozity", I mean a particular, extremely complex configuration of \nphysical phenomena, which no-one, absolutely NO-ONE cares about in the \nslightest. Does it exist, Eric?\n\nGetting back to the question of whether the DES chip "works", doesn't "work" \nmean something like "achieving the desired/expected effect"? Note the way \nintentionality subtly underlies that definition. Even if we take the \ndefinition as "expected", instead of "desired", can you deny that conformance \nto expectations is itself a value of sorts, namely the scientific values of \naccuracy-of-prediction and reproducibility-of-results?\n\nThe phenomenologist Husserl, for one, considered Intentionality to be the\nprimary ontological "stuff" from which all other ontology was built --\nperceptions, consciousness, thoughts, etc. Frank is by no means alone in\nseeing intentionality (or "values", as he puts it) underlying all human\nexperience, even the so-called "objective" experiences, such as \nmeasurements of the natural world, or the output of your DES chip.
The following is an introduction as to who is Muhammad SAW\nas will be covered with this treatise.\n\nMUHAMMAD peace and blessings of Allah be upon him (SAW)\nis the last prophet of Islam.  He is the Prophet who is revealed\nthe last Holy Scripture, Qur'an, by Allah SWA (all praise be to Him)\nthrough the Arch Angel Gabriel.  He is the seal of all prophets\ntill the day of judgement as stated in the Qur'an by Allah\nSWA (all praise be to Him).  Muhammad SAW lived between\n571-632 AC.  All other prophethoods claimed after Muhammad SAW,\nis a treason against Islam, against Qur'an, against the message\nof Allah SWA.  Muhammad SAW is from the seed of Ishmael, another\nmessenger of Allah and son of Abraham also a messenger of Allah.\nHe is the Messenger that previous holy scriptures foretold his\ncoming.  The above mentioned verse from the Qur'an is from \nChapter 33, Verse 40 whose rough translation is as follows:\n\n	Muhammad is not the father of any of your men,\n	but (he is) the messenger of Allah, and the seal\n	of the prophets, and Allah has full knowledge of\n	all things.\n\n---------------------\nCommentary on the above verse:  When a document is sealed,\nit is complete, and there can be no further addition.  The \nHoly Prophet Muhammad SAW closed the long line of Messengers.\nAllah's teaching is and will always be continuous, but there\nhas been and will be NO Prophet after Muhammad SAW.  The later\nages will want thinkers, and revivers, not Prophets.  This is not\nan arbitrary matter.  It is a decree full of knowledge and wisdom,\n"for Allah has full knowledge of all things."\n\n----------------------\nDROPLET VOL 1, No 11, Part 2\n\nA   D R O P L E T\nFrom The Vast Ocean Of The Miraculous Qur'an\n\nTranslations from the Arabic and Turkish Writings of \nBediuzzaman Said Nursi, The Risale-i Noor\n\nVOL 1, No 11, Part 2\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n   		 NINETEENTH LETTER  \n\n		 MU'JIZAT-I AHMEDIYE RISALESI \n(A TREATISE ON THE MIRACLES OF MUHAMMED SAW)       \n\n(continued from Droplet Vol 1, No 11, Part 1)\n\n   SECOND  SIGN:   The  Noble  Messenger  (SAW)\ndeclared His prophethood, and presented to humanity a\ndecree as the Glorious Qur'an and manifest miracles\nwhich number, according to the scholars, one thousand.\nThe occurrence of those miracles in their entirety is as\ncertain as the fact that He declared himself prophet.  In\nfact, as a shown by the words of the  most obstinate\nunbelievers quoted in various places of the Wise\nOur'an, even they could not deny the occurrence of His\nmiracles, but only called them -hasha wa kella!-(Allah forbids) \nsorcery, in order to satisfy themselves, or to deceive their\nfollowers.  The miracles of Muhammad (SAW) have the\ncertainty of confirmation by consensus of Ulema (scholars\nof Islam) to the hundreth degree.\n   The Miracle is the conformation by the CREATOR of\nthe universe of His declaration of Prophethood; it has the\neffect of the words,'You have indeed spoken the truth !'\n   Suppose that you said in the assembly of a ruler,\nwhile being observed by Him, 'The true ruler has\nappointed me to such and such position.  'At a time when\nyou were asked to prove your claim, the word 'Yes'\nuttered by the ruler would sufficiently support you.  Or, if\nthe ruler changed his usual practice and attitude at your\nrequest, this would confirm your claim even more soundly\nand more definitely than would the word 'Yes.'\n   In the same way, ALLAH's Most Noble Messenger\nclaimed: 'I am the envoy of the CREATOR of this\nuniverse.  My proof is that He will change His unbroken\norder at my request and my prayer.  Now look at my\nfingers:  He makes them run like a fountain with five\nspigots.  Look at the moon: by a gesture of my finger, He\nsplits it in two.  Look at that tree: to affirm me, and to bear\nwitness to me, it moves and comes near to me.  Look at\nthis food: although it is barely enough for two or three\nmen, it satisfies two or three hundred.  'Further he shows\nhundreds of similar miracles.  However, the evidences  of\nthe veracity of this high being and the proofs of his\nprophethood are not restricted to his miracles.  All his\ndeeds and acts, his words and behavior, his moral\nconduct and manners, his character and appearance\nprove to the attentive his truthfulness and seriousness.\nIndeed, many people  such  as  Abdullah  b. Salam,  the\nfamous scholar of the Children of Israel, came to belief\nmerely by seeing him, and said, 'No lie can hide in this\nface, nor can any fraud be found in it!'\n   Although many of the  researchers have concluded\nthat the proofs of the prophethood of Muhammad and his\nmiracles number about one thousand, there are\nthousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of proofs  of\nhis prophethood.  And hundreds of thousands of\ntruth-seeking men (muhakkikiin) with varying opinions\nhave affirmed his prophethood in an equal number of\nways.\n   The Wise Our'an alone demonstrates thousands of\nthe proofs of his prophethood, in addition to its own forty\naspects of miraculousness.  Since prophethood is as a\nphenomenon of humanity, and hundreds of thousands of\nindividuals who claimed prophethood and performed\nmiracles have lived and passed away; then, the\nprophethood of Muhammad (SAW) is of a certanity\nsuperior to that of the prophethood of all the others.  For\nwhatever evidences, qualities  and attributes  became the\nmeans of the prophethood and messengership of all the\nmessengers such as Jesus (AS) and Moses (AS), they\nare all owned in a more perfect and comprehensive\nfashion by Muhammad (SAW).  And since the causes and\nmeans of prophetic authority exist more perfectly in the\nperson of Muhammad (SAW), this authority is to be found\nin him with more certanity than all the other prophets.
The Roman Catholic conservatives are coming out in the open to line\nup with Pat Robertson and his ultra Right Wing Christian Coalition.\nFormer Secretary of Education William Bennet, a Roman Catholic, stood\nbeside the Christian Coalition's spokesman Ralph Reed at a March 3\nconference in Washington.  The purpose of the conference was to\npublish results of a Christian Coalition poll which was designed\nto prove that the Republican party would lose major support if it\nbacked away from the "Family Values" positons of the '92 convention.\n\nConservative Catholics have swung behind Robertson's organization\nwith political expertise, legal assistance and high tech communications\nsupport.\n\nThe Catholic Campaign for  American, designed as a Catholic version\nof the Moral Majority, was founded by Marlene Elwell and Tom Wykes.\nMs. Elwell has been with Robertson since the days of his Freedom\nCouncil in 1985 and worked for him in his presidential bid in 1988.\n\nMs. Elwell was hired by Domino's Pizza magnate, Tom Monaghan, in 1989\nto manage Legatus, a "nonpolitical", Catholic businessmen's group.\nMembership is limited to Catholics who head corporations with a least $4\nmillion in annual revenues.  Relying on a network of wealthy contacts\nat Legatus, Elwell and Wykes had little trouble forming and funding the\nCatholic Campaign.\n\nThe Campaign's list of national committee members includes U.S. Rep.\nRobert K. Dornan, Phyllis Schlafly of the Eagle Forum, the lovely\nPat Buchanan and Rev. Richard J. Neuhaus.   Also on the national\ncommittee is Keith Fournier, a Catholic who heads Pat Robertson's\nAmerican Center for Law and Justice.  Another Catholic, Thomas\nPatrick Monaghan, senior counsel of Robertson's ACLJ, is also an\nactive supporter of the Catholic Campaign.\n\nThe board of directors includes Frank Shakespeare, broadcasting exec\nand former U.S. ambassador to the Pope, Wall Street executive Frank\nLynch, former Reagan official Richard V. Allen, Bishop Rene Gracida\nof Corpus Christi and Mary Ellen Bork, wife of unsuccessful Supreme\nCourt nominee Robert Bork.\n\nIn the Winter 1992 issue of _Campaign Update_ the organization's\nquarterly newsletter, Rocco L.
