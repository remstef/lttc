Does anyone know of a non-word password generator program\nfor PC's?? i.e. it will produce a nonsense word but still\nbe pronouncible. e.g. lisgollan\n\nWanted to "force" users to adopt more secure passwords,\nbut still be memorable!\n\nThanks - George Bolt
The system, or 'family', key would appear to be cryptographically\nuseless, since *every* chip must know it and be able to remove its\neffects from the bitstream.  I daresay that it will be widely known\nalmost immediately after this system is deployed, and since it's been\npointed out that there is not a separate decrypt key -- the same key\nis used for both encryption and decryption -- there goes any benefit\nto the use of a system-wide key in SkipJack.
If we do not trust the NSA to be a registrar of Clipper Chip key halves,\nI would not trust Mitre either.  Mitre does lots of work for NSA, at least\nin the Trusted Product Evaluation Program (evaluation of commercial off the\nshelf software for its efficacy in safeguarding classified information), and\nI assume in other, less open, programs.\n\nThere are at least two other FFRDCs (Federally Funded Research and Development\nCorporations) that work for NSA: Aerospace Corporation and the Institute for\nDefense Analysis.  Now, if NSA were to be untrustworthy (a position that I\nam neutral about, for purposes of this posting), it would be in a position to\nexert economic pressure upon Mitre to release key halves on demand.  It could\njust say, "If you don't cooperate with us, we'll place all our evaluation\ncontracts with Aerospace and IDA."\n\nI am not saying that people at NSA, Mitre, Aerospace, or IDA are dishonest\nfolk.  But since they are people, and people occasionally go bad, the\nsystem works better if organizations that you are depending upon to be\nindependent really are.\n\nAnd, of course, I speak for myself, not my employer.
In light of my recent paranoia concerning government proposals, I'd love to\nsee a UNIX-based encryption scheme that:\n\n1) Kept some files encrypted on the host machine (say, all the files in your\n   home directory)\n2) Used a key system that could not be compromised by eavesdropping over a\n   modem line.\n\nIt seems that this would require modifications to a shell program and a\nway of telling whether a file was encrypted or not, among other things.\n\nI'd love to know about potential security holes in such a system.\n\nDoes such a system exist?  If it were made easy-to-use and readily\navailable, I think it would be a Good Thing(tm).  I realize that this\nwould probably just involve putting a nice front-end on a readily available\nand very secure encryption scheme, but it should be done.
The stragegy of the government is interesting.  The real fear comes from\nthem doing more than this.\n\nThis is a voluntary program, and thus harder for us to object to on\nthe surface.\n\nTheir strategy is a business one rather than legal one.  They are\npushing to get a standard in place, a secret standard, and if they\nget it as a standard then they will drive competitors out of the market.\nIt will be legal to sell better, untapable encryption that doesn't have\nregistered keys, but it will be difficult, and thus not a plan for\nmost phone companies.\n\nYou see, with clipper chip phones you'll be able to talk to any\ncellular company, or other phones or ports because they will follow\nthe standard.  AT&T has already announced a clipper chip encryption\nproduct.  The government has marketed hard to get major vendors to\nuse these chips.   If they get enough market share, they will rule.\n\nAnd thus there will be very little market for systems that can't be\ntapped by the police.  The public isn't that concerned about it now,\nafter all.  They freely do calls that anybody with an old TV can listen\nto today!  They won't pay big extra bucks for proprietary phones that secure\nthem only from the police.\n\nWell, some people will buy these phones, but they will only work with\nother proprietary phones, so the market will be small and the phones\nexpensive.  Unless they are made in numbers large enough to sell them\ncheap, only the Mob will buy them.\n\nAnd this means that the FBI will want to track the customer lists of\nbetter encryption phones, because "the only reason a person would want\none is to evade the police."\n\nInteresting.
How can the government tell which encryption method one is using without\nbeing able to decode the traffic? i.e., In order to accuse me of using an\nunauthorized strong encryption technique they would have to take both\nkeys out of escrow, run them against my ciphertext and "draw a blank".
Not to pick on Mr. May in particular, of course, but isn't this\nkind of the domino theory? When one little country falls, its neighbor\nwill surely follow, and before you know it, we're all mining salt\nin Siberia for not turning in our Captain Crunch Secret Decoder Rings.\n\n	Surely the hypothesis relying on the least wild assumptions is\nto take this at face value. Our lads at the fort were asked to cook up\nsomething that's pretty secure, with a key that can be escrowed neatly,\nand they did. The government plans to sell this thing, for the reasons\nthey state. Yes, those evil guys in the FBI can probably, with some\neffort, abuse the system. I got news for you, if the evil guys in\nthe FBI decide they want to persecute you, they're gonna, and you're\ngonna hate it. Fact is, the FBI doesn't want to listen to your phone\ncalls, and if they do, and if you're using triple-DES, they'll just\nget a parabolic microphone and point it at your head.\n\n	This is pretty clearly an effort by the government to do exactly\nwhat they're saying they're doing. As is typical with governments,\nit's mismanaged, and full of holes and compromises. As is typical\nwith our government, it's not too bad, could be worse.\n\n	My interpretation.\n\n	Andrew\n\n                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Well, I'm not a lawyer, but from what I can tell this is completely\nand utterly untrue.\n\nYou see, this country has this thing called a "constitution".\n\nIf you legitimately aquire the device, and you yourself are\nnot a government employee or otherwise encumbered, I don't think they\ncan stop you from revealing anything about the device you can\ndetermine. Remember the Pentagon Papers precedent? The First Amendment\napplies here.\n\nThe U.S. does NOT have an official secrets act. We do have laws that\nwill punish you for revealing what classified information you learned\nin your capacity as a government official, contractor, etc, and we\nhave laws that prohibit stealing such information. However, if they\nsell you the chip, I can't see that they can make reverse engineering\nit and revealing the details illegal.\n\n--\nPerry Metzger		pmetzger@shearson.com
This is the one part that really scares me. Without\nthe keys, it can likely be determined if a person\nis using the "State Approved" encryption method,\nand if not then that persons life is forfet, and\nthe profits go to making more busts, and more \nprofit. \n\n"Power corrupts.

How ever, due to irritations like the 24 hr\nday etc, I would say 'Manafacturing Conscent' first, them th last parts of\n'Detering Democracy' ie the bits about the "domestic 3rd world".

With E-Mail, if they can't break your PGP encryption, they'll just\ncall up one of their TEMPEST trucks and read the electromagnetic emmisions\nfrom your computer or terminal.

[... a bunch of well-meaning (maybe) cynnical text about screw-thread\n	sizes, the rights of people to have their own standards,\n	and the non-right of the gov. to regulate screw-threads...]\n\nWell, as funny as your little comment may seem, it has very little to\ndo with your personal privacy as a citizen, and about the governemnt\nbeing able to look at everything you have ever typed into a computer\nat one point or another.\n\nThis "Clipper Chip" stuff is the seeds for nightmares to make the \nNightmare on Elmstreet cheese-on-celluloid movies look like episodes\nof Mr. Roger's Neighborhood.\n\nIF the gov establishes a cryptography standard that has to be used by\neveryone, and everyone's personal key is divided into two segments\nand stored at two separate, albeit easy to find places, and that key is\nonly 80 bits to begin with, we are screwed (pardon the allusion to the \naffore-mentioned article)!\n\nthe gov, I believe, as do many others probably already have the cracking chips\nfor this Clipper Chip made.  Hell, they probably based the encoder on the \nchip that cracks it, that way it's easier to break the code, but since it is a \nclassified algorythm, no one knows that they can crack it so easily.\n\nI, for one, and quite scared of this kind of thing, and plan to support \norganizations (and even disorganizations) who are fighting against this\nClipper Chip in any way that I can.\n\nI do not want the government to be able to have access, even with a search\nwarrant, to my keys... and I don't want those keys to be only 80 bits long\nto begin with!\n\n-nate sammons
Mr. Ward, before you start blathering about your skill "interpreting"\nthe Constitution, it might be helpful to learn to read.  After a review\nwith a high school English teacher emphasizing participial phrases, you\nmight start with the Second Amendment, and follow it up with:\n\n 97th Congress, 2nd Session, Committee Print, *The Right To Keep and\n Bear Arms*, of the Subcomittee on the Constitution of the Committee on\n the Judiciary, United States Senate, 97th Congress, Second Session,\n February, 1982.  GPO No. 88-618-O\n\nThis authoritative, heavily researched and annotated document clearly\nturns your "interpretation" into specious claptrap, which is a polite\nway of saying utter bullshit.  In spite of your false assertion to the\ncontrary, the Second Amendment DOES protect the right of the individual\ncitizen, in his capacity as an individual, to keep and bear arms.\n\nAnd, Mr. Holland, IMHO, blatantly and harmfully false information,\nasserted as fact and globally distributed, deserves globally\ndistributed rebuttal in the forum in which it is posted.\n\n(And besides, this site doesn't carry t.p.g...:-)\n\nharryb%phred@data-io.com\nphred!harryb@data-io.com\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nNo free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.  The strongest\nreason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is,\nas a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.\n					--Thomas Jefferson
( Below is my response to Dr. Denning's letter to Steven Bellovin. Comments\n  are invited. - Paul )\n\nIn alt.privacy.clipper, Steve Bellovin posted your message to\nhim, which included a brief passage concerning selection of agencies\nas escrow agencies.\n\nI am glad to see that the proposal as written states that the escrow\nagencies won't be law enforcement agencies. I would argue, however,\nthat *one* of the escrow agencies shouldn't be federal at all.\n\nAs a private citizen, I would feel much more "secure in my person and\npapers" knowing that an organization committed to individual civil\nliberties- the ACLU and the NRA come to mind- was safeguarding half of\nmy key. Both the ACLU and the NRA are resistent to government pressure\nby the simple expedient fact that they are not supported, funded, or\novertly controlled by the government.\n\nOf those federal and federally funded candidate agencies that you\nmentioned, I have the following comments:\n\n	- SRI, Rand, Mitre, and national labs: I agree that they have\n        great experience safeguarding sensitive information. I am not\n        convinced that they would adequately safeguard _this_\n	information, since in any case requiring disclosure, there's\n      	likely to be sigificant pressure for disclosure- possibly\n 	*wrongful* disclosure.\n\n	- GAO: perhaps. I would like to see more concrete evidence of\n 	their fidelity and ability.\n\n	- *TREASURY*? Surely you're joking. Perhaps you'd ask BATF\n	to safeguard keys. Maybe the Federal Reserve would be a \n	better choice.\n\nEver since last fall's "trial balloon" was posted in sci.crypt, your\nname has been synonymous with those who place a great deal of trust in\nthe ability of government agencies and agents to act within the law.\n\nI agree with you in part: those agencies and agents *almost always*\nact properly. However, there have been enough cases where _sworn\nagents of the Federal Government_ have acted wrongly to make me feel\nthat having two federal agencies as key repositories is unacceptable.\n\n\nRespectfully,\n-Paul Robichaux\n (not speaking for NTI, BCSS, or NASA)
You can find the salient difference in any number of 5th amendment\nrelated Supreme Court opinions. The Court limits 5th amendment\nprotections to what they call "testimonial" evidence, as opposed to\nphysical evidence.\n\nThe whole question would hinge on whether a crypto key would be\nconsidered "testimonial" evidence. I suppose arguments could be made\neither way, though obviously I would hope it would be considered\ntestimonial.
[Sarcastic text deleted, No value judgement implied]\n\n\nAt first I was going to complain that your analogy was completely\nirrelevant.  But then I remembered something.\n\nRemember that move to get the U.S. to the metric system all those\nyears ago?  As far as I know we were supposed to be there by now.\n\nThe government sold it as better for the people, easier to be in\ntune with the rest of the world.  They had decided it was for\nour own good.\n\nThen, when the plan was released, it soon became apparant that the\ngovernment were a bunch 'o' thickies.\n\nThink about it, change all the railroad track widths, signs,\nscrews, abolish the old regime.\n\nAt the cost of millions of dollars.\n\nYour point is well taken.  You think there is nothing to worry\nabout, you could care less who designs your cryptography, any\nmore than who designs your screws or the system of measurement\nyou use.\n\nSit back, that's right, just relax, we'll take care of all your\nneeds Mr. Molitor.
Please note that Bill Clinton probably has little if anything to do\nwith the design, implementation or reasoning behind this chip or behind\nany "moves" being made using this chip as a pawn.\n\nRemember, when you elect a president of the united states, it's not\nthe case that all the Republicans, etc. in the NSA and FBI and CIA\nimmediately pack their bags and get replaced by a team of fresh young\nDemocrats.  Most of the government -- say, 96% -- is appointed or\nhired rather than elected.  Since this Clipper device has been in\nproduction for over six months, it probably has little or no \nfoundation in the currently elected Democratic Executive body.\n\n\nCould be.  However, the sky hasn't fallen yet, Chicken Little.
I was thinking about this, also. It's quite possible the\nsystem transmits, in clear, the serial number of the device being\nused. That way they can start a tap, get the serial number, and use\nthe warrant for the first tap to get the key.\n\n	If they tap someone who's apparently using encryption, but\ndon't find that prefix, then they'll assume it's an "un-authorized"\nencryption scheme.\n\n--\n	May the Kloo Gnomes be generous to you.
I think a new organization would be a much better idea, as the NRA\ncarries as much undesireable baggage for me as the EFF and CPSR do\nfor others.\n\nAre any hot-shot, reputable organizers reading this message?  If an\neffective group comes into existence, it can count on me signing up.
It might be nice to:\n\n1. cut out the ad hominem attacks on Prof. Denning, Mr. Sternlight,\netc.  If you have something objective to say about their views, go\nahead and say it (subject to point 2.).  Personal attacks reflect more\non the attacker more than on the attackee.  Throw light, not heat!\n\n2. restrict the discussion to appropriate newsgroups. I submit that\ncomp.org.acm and comp.org.ieee are not appropriate for this\ndiscussion.  You have now made subscribers to these newsgroups aware of\nthe issue.  If they want to know more or participate in the discussion,\nthey can easily join sci.crypt, comp.security.misc, alt.security, or\ncomp.org.eff.talk.\n--
It occurs to me that if they get a wiretap order on you, and the escrow\nhouses release your code to the cops, your code is now no longer secure.\n\nIt's in the hands of cops, and while I am sure most of the time they are\ngood, their security will not be as good as the escrow houses.\n\n\nWhat this effectively means is that if they perform a wiretap on you,\nat the end of the wiretap, they should be obligated to inform you that\na tap was performed, and replace (for free) the clipper chip in your\ncellular phone so that it is once again a code known only to the\nescrow houses.\n\nDo the police normally reveal every tap they do even if no charges are\nlaid?   In many ways, it would be a positive step if they had to.\nJudges set time limits on warrants, I assume.  At the end of the time\nlimit they should have to renew or replace your chip.\n\n\nThat's if we go with this scheme, which I am not sure I agree with.
You're drifting off topic.  In any case, if you check on any of the\ntopics devoted to gun rights issues, you will find ample evidence that\nthe "misinformation" is your assertion that the term "the people" in\nthe Second Amendment has mysteriously taken on a meaning diametrically\nopposite the meaning of the exact same term in the First and Fourth\nAmendments.
I hope there are some silicon jocks on the committee who can follow\nthe algorithm through to hardware.  While I doubt the NSA would pull\nany monkey business on this point -- they have to expect that the\nchip will be reverse-engineered sooner or later -- it's an obvious\nopportunity to introduce additional holes.
Yes, but they'll be encrypted with Cripple Chip encryption, the\nencryption algorithm so great it's TOP SECRET and so unbreakable\nthey WON'T EVEN LET YOU LOOK AT IT!\n\nDoesn't that make you feel SECURE?
It seems to me that all discussions about Clipper security are almost \nirrelevant - if I cannot choose the key, but have to use a key chosen for\nme by the foundry, the security of the WHOLE UNIVERSE OF USERS is as good\n(or as bad) as the security of VLSI Technologies Inc.\n\nIt is a trivial effort to run any ciphertext agains ALL THE KEYS EVER \nMANUFACTURED - after all we are talking about 1 to 100 million keys that\nwill ever be manufactured. The key depositories can be as secure and\nincorruptible as they wish to be, nobody cares anyway...:-(\n\nNow if someone would convince me that the shipping docks of VTI, ATT and\nothers are impenetrable (remember: the chips have to ship with the key - \nyou or the dealer are going to submit it to the authorities eventually)\nI'd be a bit happier. But do we really believe that the various governments\n(including ours) won't have the full lists of all the keys ever manufactured?\n\nDid I miss something here?\n\nMy own opinions, quite obviously...\n--
I don't have the wiretap statute handy.  But here's what the law says\non pen registers.  This is all from Title 18 of the U.S. Code.  Note\nhow vague S. 3125(a)(1)(B) is....  I haven't had a chance to check\nout 50 U.S.C. 1801 yet.\n\n----\n\n18 USC  S. 3121 Pen Registers (as of 4/93)\n\n\nS. 3121. General prohibition on  pen register  and trap and trace device\nuse; exception\n\n   (a) In general. Except as provided in this section, no person may\ninstall or use a  pen register  or a trap and trace device without first\nobtaining a court order under section 3123 of this title or under the\nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.).\n\n.....\n\nS. 3125.  Emergency  pen register  and trap and trace device\ninstallation\n\n   (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter , any\ninvestigative or law enforcement officer, specially designated by the\nAttorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, the Associate Attorney\nGeneral, any Assistant Attorney General, any acting Assistant Attorney\nGeneral, or any Deputy Assistant Attorney General, or by the principal\nprosecuting attorney of any State or subdivision thereof acting pursuant\nto a statute of that State, who reasonably determines that--\n\n   (1) an emergency situation exists that involves--\n\n   (A) immediate danger of death or serious bodily injury to any person;\nor\n\n   (B) conspiratorial activities characteristic of organized crime,\n\n   that requires the installation and use of a  pen register  or a trap\nand trace device before an order authorizing such installation and use\ncan, with due diligence, be obtained, and\n\n   (2) there are grounds upon which an order could be entered under this\nchapter to authorize such installation and use "may have installed and\nuse a  pen register  or trap and trace device if, within forty-eight\nhours after the installation has occurred, or begins to occur, an order\napproving the installation or use is issued in accordance with section\n3123 of this title."\n\n   (b) In the absence of an authorizing order, such use shall\nimmediately terminate when the information sought is obtained, when the\napplication for the order is denied or when forty-eight hours have\nlapsed since the installation of the  pen register  or trap and trace\ndevice, whichever is earlier.
This has now been thrown out by the courts.  (The "Progressive" case.)\n\n\nThis is outright illegal.  It DOES violate the first amendment.  If you\nwould, give a case in which your "speed trap" example has been upheld by\nthe courts.
I've recently moved from Unix to a DOS box and have a number of files \nthat I used crypt to "protect".  Does anyone know of a DOS version of \ncrypt?  I've found one, but it insists on six letter keys and I used \nsome shorter ones.  Thanks for your help.  -- Doug
If Brad's analysis is correct, it may offer an explanation for why the\nencryption algorithm is being kept secret.  This will prevent competitors\nfrom coming out with Clipper-compatible phones which lack the government-\ninstalled "back door."  The strategy Brad describes will only work as long\nas the only way to get compatible phones is to have ones with the government\nchips.\n\n(It would be nice, from the point of view of personal privacy, if Brad\nturns out to be right.  As long as people still have the power to provide\ntheir own encryption in place of or in addition to the Clipper, privacy\nis still possible.  But the wording of several passages in the announcement\nmakes me doubt whether this will turn out to be true.)
But what about second sources for pin-compatible non-Clipper algorithm\nchips that also have escrowed keys?  If a "reputable firm" produces a\nchip (with escrowed key) that is a pop-in replacement for the Clipper\nchip in my phone, and uses an algorithm that is widely known and evaluated\nand "trusted," then what's the problem?\n\nThe Clipper is going to be reverse engineered anyway by any organization\nwith sufficient resources (can you say "billions of cocaine dollars?") so\nthose drug dealers they're so worried about will be slipping through the\ncracks.  We law-abiding (non-incredibly-wealthy) citizens, naturally, will\nnot have this recourse.  But claiming that the algorithm can't be\nreleased to prevent people from using non-key-escrowed chips is plain\ndeceitful... analysis of the chip output will provide information on\nthe necessary headers and whatnot, so the "bad guys" could build chips\nusing a *different* algorithm and still not escrow their keys.\n\nOr, they could just buy bunches of cheap phones at K-mart every week,\nand play Swap-the-Clipper-Chip with their cellular phone every day.

Hmm, here are a couple:\n\n1) If the algorithm becomes known, it will be easy to produce\npin-compatible non-crippled chips that provide -real- encryption and\nprivacy, because their keys are only in their users' hands.\n\n2) Since SkipJack is a symmetric key cypher, it needs some way to\nagree on a session key. The released information says that any\nprotocol may be used (e.g., DH). From a theoretical point of view,\nthis is probably true. However, from a practical point of view, those\nchips must have some kind of key exchange protocol built-in. What if\nit is good old RSA? This will mean that the producer will have to pay\nlots of bucks to PKP. By keeping the details secret this can be\navoided...\n\nRegards,\nVesselin
No. The LAPD officers were tried first by the State of California\non charges of police brutality, and secondly by the Federal Government\non depriving RK of his civil rights - a different crime.\n\n    The scenario I outline is more similar to the Oliver North trial.\nOllie confessed to treason (aiding an enemy of the US) during Senate\nhearings, under immunity. The team which was later to prosecute him on\ncriminal charges had to sequester itself from all reports of ON's\nimmunized testimony. ON's lawyer brought up the probability that at\nleast someone on the team had heard about the Senate testimony, and it\nwas a strong factor against the prosecution, which is one of the\nreasons this ON is still walking around free today.
From: pmetzger@snark.shearson.com (Perry E. Metzger)\n\n	You obviously haven't read the information about the system. The chips\n	put out serial number infomation into the cypher stream to allow\n	themselves to be identified. The system does not rely on registering\n	people as owning particular phone units.\n\nAnd probably as a back door to allow re-generation of the secret key.\n\nHave we determined yet that S1 and S2 don't ever change?
Quoting strnlght@netcom.com (David Sternlight) in article <strnlghtC5t3nH.Is1@netcom.com>:
I don't know, but I'm as willing to speculate as anyone.\n\nSeveral people have suggested that the chips use public-key cryptography.\nAnother possibility is to use Diffie-Hellman key exchange, or some other\nalgorithm which has a similar effect.  DH allows both ends to agree on\na session key which they use with symmetric cryptography (something\nlike DES) for the encryption.\n\nHow could the "back door" keys work in this system?  I can see a few\npossibilities.  One is that the DH-like algorithm has the property that\nthe session key can be deduced by an eavesdropper who knows the back door\nkeys for one (or possibly both) communicants.  Perhaps the random numbers\nused in the DH are seeded by the back door key, or some such.\n\nAnother possibility, as was suggested here earlier, is that the chips\nsimply broadcast the session key, encrypted with the chip's own\ninternal secret key.  In this system the back door keys are secret keys\nusable for decrypting this session key broadcast.  Actually the chip's\nsecret key doesn't need to be a public key in this usage, but can be\nidentical to the secret back-door key.  (This proposal seems most\nstraightforward to me.)\n\nStill another possibility is that the encryption algorithm used for the\nmessage itself has a "dual key" property, that possession of either of\ntwo keys can be used to decrypt it.  One key would be the session key from\nthe DH exchange, and the other would be the back door key for the chip.\n\nIt's worth noting that one of the proposals Dorothy Denning raised\nduring her amazingly prescient on-line discussion last November and\nDecember was a variation on Diffie-Hellman in which a third party would\nparticipate in deriving the session keys.  This doesn't quite fit into\nwhat we know of how Clipper works but it hints that those who had early\nknowledge of Clipper (or whose thinking was somehow synchronized with\nClipper designers) may have had Diffie-Hellman on their minds.
brad@clarinet.com (Brad Templeton):\n}And yes, this has to be a public key system or it would be almost\n}impossible to handle.  It might not be RSA, but that does not mean\n}that PKP doesn't get paid.  Until 1997, PKP has the patent on the\n}general concept of public key encryption, as well as the particular\n}implementation known as RSA.\n\nHmm, my first thought was that they're using Diffie-Hellman exponential\nsession key exchange, or an equivalent.  However, the Diffie-Hellman\npatent, like the Hellman-Merkle one on public key systems, claims\nall equivalents, so the basic point stands.\n\nInterestingly, a quote from Jim Bidzos showed up in the media real\nsoon after the announcement, and he sounded very pissed.  Maybe he hadn't\nyet realized that PKP might have just struck gold?  All they have to\ndo is get someone to admit the general scheme that the Clipper uses.\n---\nJef
Now why would anyone "post" anything encrypted? Encryption is only of \nuse between persons who know how to decrypt the data.\n\nAnd why should I care what other people look at? \n\nWhat does concern me is the continued erosion of my constitutional\nrights. ( Amendments I, II, IV, and V to note a few. )
Gee. Say they feed the 80-bit key through Snefru-8 and take the first 60\nbits of the result, then use those 60 bits as the real key. How do you\nfigure out that each key is one of 2^20 ``equal'' keys? You can try a\nbirthday attack, but if the key can be changed only once a second then\nyou will need several lifetimes to get reliable statistics. Somehow I\ndon't think you could catch the NSA at this sort of skulduggery.
[..stuff deleted]\nOh, but can Big Brother afford such things in these times of tight\nbudgets?\n\nI don't know how many folks noticed it, but Dorothy "Trust Me" Denning gave\na real clue to the current state of the art at NSA on decrypto machines when\nshe said the NSA told her they didn't even want to be the holder of any\npart of the key.  \n\nNow why is that?  I doubt there is a trapdoor in Skipjack.  (But we will\nnever know).  And I doubt the NSA would promote a mass market chip they\ncouldn't compromise.  Ergo, NSA is now capable of compromising (probably\nwith brute force keysearch) engines of the complexity of Skipjack.  Look\nat the specs.  Why, I bet they have thousands of little chips chugging\naway in their crypto busters... Maybe even tens of thousands.  Complexity?\nNot much more than a 3090.  How many such machines will fit into Fort Meade?\n\nI think PGP2.3 should have 256 bit IDEA keys...
It does give privacy, just not absolute privacy.  The announcement was very \nup front about this, and about allowing wiretaps.  How is this "fooling" \nanyone?\n\n\nSure.  The two don't interoperate.  You couldn't talk to, say, a Cylink phone \nfrom a Clipper phone.  I would expect even multiprotocal phones to come with \nindicators saying which kind of link encryption is in use...\n\n\nSo start a company and build them.  This is still mostly a capitalist \neconomy...\n\n\nI agree.  Go for it.
Some sick part of me really liked that phrase....
Note:     The following was released by the White House today in\n          conjunction with the announcement of the Clipper Chip\n          encryption technology.\n\n                           FACT SHEET\n\n                  PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENT\n\nThe President has approved a directive on "Public Encryption\nManagement."  The directive provides for the following:\n\nAdvanced telecommunications and commercially available encryption\nare part of a wave of new computer and communications technology. \nEncryption products scramble information to protect the privacy of\ncommunications and data by preventing unauthorized access. \nAdvanced telecommunications systems use digital technology to\nrapidly and precisely handle a high volume of communications. \nThese advanced telecommunications systems are integral to the\ninfrastructure needed to ensure economic competitiveness in the\ninformation age.\n\nDespite its benefits, new communications technology can also\nfrustrate lawful government electronic surveillance.  Sophisticated\nencryption can have this effect in the United States.  When\nexported abroad, it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence\nactivities critical to our national interests.  In the past, it has\nbeen possible to preserve a government capability to conduct\nelectronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law\nenforcement and national security interests, while at the same time\nprotecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens.  As\nencryption technology improves, doing so will require new,\ninnovative approaches.\n\nIn the area of communications encryption, the U. S. Government has\ndeveloped a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through\nencryption that is substantially more robust than the current\ngovernment standard, but also permits escrowing of the keys needed\nto unlock the encryption.  The system for the escrowing of keys\nwill allow the government to gain access to encrypted information\nonly with appropriate legal authorization.\n\nTo assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect\nand decrypt, under legal authority, electronically transmitted\ninformation, I hereby direct the following action to be taken:\n\nINSTALLATION OF GOVERNMENT-DEVELOPED MICROCIRCUITS\n\nThe Attorney General of the United States, or her representative,\nshall request manufacturers of communications hardware which\nincorporates encryption to install the U.S. government-developed\nkey-escrow microcircuits in their products.  The fact of law\nenforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from\nthe American public.  All appropriate steps shall be taken to\nensure that any existing or future versions of the key-escrow\nmicrocircuit are made widely available to U.S. communications\nhardware manufacturers, consistent with the need to ensure the\nsecurity of the key-escrow system.  In making this decision, I do\nnot intend to prevent the private sector from developing, or the\ngovernment from approving, other microcircuits or algorithms that\nare equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key-\nescrow system.\n\nKEY-ESCROW\n\nThe Attorney General shall make all arrangements with appropriate\nentities to hold the keys for the key-escrow microcircuits\ninstalled in communications equipment.  In each case, the key\nholder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent\nunauthorized release of the keys.  The keys shall be released only\nto government agencies that have established their authority to\nacquire the content of those communications that have been\nencrypted by devices containing the microcircuits.  The Attorney\nGeneral shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which\nan agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such\ncommunications.\n\nPROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES\n\nThe Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other appropriate\nU.S. agencies, shall initiate a process to write standards to\nfacilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted\nwith key-escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems\nthat process sensitive but unclassified information.  I expect this\nprocess to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of\na final standard within six months of this directive.
Could somebody provide an overview of the proposed systems using the\nchip?  (Ought to see if ATT has a spec sheet)  Skipjack sounds like a\nnormal digital encryption algorithm, so the data path will have to be\n	voice --> digitize --> compress --> encrypt \nCompression will be necessary to fit the data on the wire, unless\nthey want to wait for ISDN (that we should be so lucky...).  Feeding\npre-encrypted data into the compressor will cause it to chuckle at\nyou; you'd have to tap into the guts of the phone and hack either\nthe compressed data stream, or selected parts of the output stream\nbefore it hits the modem.  Unless you want to pay for two fast\nmodems on top of the encryption, and just plug the box in between\nyour phone and the wall.
Thank you very much. After reading the text some distinct questions\narised to me, which I guess will also be asked by other people. Perhaps\nwould it be interesting to find an answer to these questions ?\n\n\n\nshorter or longer ?\n\n\n\n\nFirst question: When will the LawEnforcmentField be transmitted, and how\ndoes the remote Clipper Chip handle it? Is it transmitted periodically\nin the stream of encrypted blocks, or just at the beginning ? Does the\nphone at the other side discard those packets via a protocol whatsoever,\nor tries it to turn them into voice-output ? (Which would not be disturbing)\n\n\n\nSecond question: Why!?!? Why is such a strange procedure used, and not\na real RNG ? This turns those S1,S2 in a kind of bottleneck for system-\nsecurity.\n\n\n\nSo no (technical) provision will be taken to place a 'timeout' on these\nwarrants? This would be a unique possibility to realize such a technical\nrestriction, by letting the escrow-agencies perform the decoding of the\nsession key. Just take modem-lines instead of secure fax. Is this such\na bad idea ?\n\n\n\nWow! (How does the randomizer work?) Are the SHA (and Key exchange) secret,\nor publicly known ? Key-Exchange is DH, I guess ?\n\nIt seems that those who are opposed to this chip shall have a tough time,\nyour government realy means to act. :-(\n\nFriendly greetings,\n	   Germano Caronni
Of course, nothing prevents you from buying a new lock with cash\nand installing it yourself. Even modifying the core to match some\narbitrary key is not difficult to do at home. I once knew someone who\nhad fixed his locks in this way - his house, office and cars all took\nthe same key (which he took GOOD care of :-)\n\n\n\n    Very bad (yours, that is). Have you ever had a safety deposit box?\nThey work on a two-key system. The bank clerk has one, and you have\nthe other (they are different keys). The bank does NOT keep a copy of\nyour key. If you lose it, they have to drill out the lock, and replace\nthe door. This is a time consuming and expensive process (which they\nwill be happy to charge to your account :-).\n\n     This process is exactly analogous to having a private key which\nis NOT in a escrow system, and the state having to crack your cipher\nto get the data.\n\n     Please do not use false analogies.
The points raised about checking what is actually -in- the chip, as\n	opposed to what is allegedly programmed therein, raise yet another trust\n	issue.  Even if we assume that these "trusted agents" are really entering\n	a wide range of S1 and S2 seeds (rather than using the same one all the\n	time to reduce the key search space to 30 bits), I assume they are not\n	doing so by picking up an iron filing and poking it into the circuitry\n	at carefully selected points to encode data.  They would presumably be\n	punching numbers into a computer, which for all they know could program\n	the chips in a manner completely independent of the S1 and S2 values they\n	are feeding into the system.\n\nS1 and S2 are clearly the backdoor - we should assume they are all\ncompromised.  If they're not compromisable, why the hell not use a\nhardware true random number source.  There isn't a random number\nsource *anywhere* in this proposal.  The whole thing is deterministic\nfrom the day the serial number is stamped on the chip.\n\nNope, it can't be trusted.  This is all about two levels of access -\nthe (possibly honest) key escrow that police forces have to use, and\nostensibly the FBI; and the back door that lets the NSA decode *everything*\non the fly - and maybe some back-handers to the FBI when they want a\nwarrantless tab in exchange for favours.
I feel like Winston Churchill in 1941 :( ...... but,\nthe privacy Clipper will, TO THE EXTENT KEY ESCROW IS LEGITIMATE, stop\nmost of the abuse of wiretaps by local cops, company cops, angry husbands/\nwives, etc...  It is going to be hard for the keystone cops, the\nProctor&Gamble cops, etc. to bypass even a product as flawed as the ClipJob.\n\nNow I admit, I am hard pressed to find anything else good to say about it\nexcept that, if it actually takes off, someone will certainly come up with\na REAL crypto chip (pin compatable!) that we can buy... Unless, of course,\nBig Brother makes it illegal to have real crypto 'cause good honest law\nabiding citizens will be HAPPY to let the government listen to their\nevery word.... "Me? Did I say THAT?"\n\n        "I am not a crook." - President Richard M. Nixon\n                              ^^^^^^^^^
Thousands?  Tens of thousands?  Do some arithmetic, please...  Skipjack\nhas 2^80 possible keys.  Let's assume a brute-force engine like that\nhypothesized for DES:  1 microsecond per trial, 1 million chips.  That's\n10^12 trials per second, or about 38,000 years for 2^80 trials.  Well,\nmaybe they can get chips running at one trial per nanosecond, and build\na machine with 10 million chips.  Sure -- only 3.8 years for each solution.\n\nIDEA uses 128-bit keys.  Shall I bother doing the calculations for you?\nHint:  multiply 3.8 years by 2^(128-80).  And you can't do IDEA at that\nspeed; key setup takes much too long.  I wouldn't be surprised if that\nwere the case for Skipjack, too, though there's no way of knowing just\nyet.  DES used only xor because that's what was feasible with mid-70's\ntechnology.  Modern chips can do a lot more.
[...]\n\nMaybe 300 such pairs suffice to reconstruct S1 and S2? By such a back-\ndoor (in the encryption algorithm perhaps) it would be possible (for  \nthe manufacturer) to get the keys of all chips that were programmed in \none session. This would not, btw, enable anybody else to retrieve the \nkeys in the same way because they'll never get a bunch of 300 (N,U) \npairs with identical S1 and S2. (Note that these have to be constant \nfor the whole batch by the very nature of the procedure, i.e., they \nhave to be typed in manually by the `random number supplying agents'!)\n\nAnd I was wondering why they'll always do 300 chips in one session ... \nSince the procedure described by Ms Denning imposes high costs on the \nproduction of every chip (at least three persons for one hour each, \nplus the cost of a laptop finally blown to pieces in a spectacular, \nHollywood-like bonfire; add travelling expenses, drinks and lighting, \ndivide the sum by 300) there won't be a larger demand -- not from the \nprivate sector anyway. \n\nAnd let me mention one other thought that certainly has occurred to all \nthe notoriously paranoid people in this group before: Who is going to \nverify that _no_ interested party will perform tempest attacks on the \nvault?? \n\nWhere there's so much smoke and mirrors -- there can't be a nice, honest \nfire but something really worth hiding ...
Why doing it in such a rough manner? It is much more professional to\nsteal the chip from the phone and even to replace it with a\npin-compatible do-nothing chip that does not encrypt at all. Chances\nare that the victim will not notice anything, especially if it is done\nprofessionally.\n\n\nNo, because the Feds will still be able to decrypt the conversations.\nTrue, they'll blame the wrong guys, but nevertheless one cannot say\nsomething like "The drugs arrive tommorrow on the ship 'Terminus'"\nwhen the Feds are listening, even if they cannot identify who the\nspeaker is.\n\nNo, the criminals will just use some secure encryption. The new\nproposal does not stop criminals; it ensures that the government will\nbe able to wiretap the average citizen and stops the casual snooper.\nTo me, it also clearly looks as a step towards outlawing any other\nstrong encryption devices.\n\nRegards,\nVesselin
The actual algorithm is classified, however, their main thrust here is\nfor cellular phones, and encryption is only over the radio end, not\nend to end, I think.   End to end will come later.\n\nAnd of course you have to identify yourself to the phone company, and\nsince the phone company complies with court orders, they will know the\nmagic number of your chip when they sign out a warrant on you, and\nthen can present the warrant to the key escrow house.
This way to detect pre-encryption may be defeated ; one can do  \ntransformation of the spectrum of encrypted signal just by adding some \npre-arranged (in the beginning of communication) function.\nI think so. Say, you can do FFT of your encrypted signal.\nJust thinking ... \n\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      For PGP2.1 public key finger mkagalen@lynx.dac.northeastern.edu
Agreed.  This is like the Bay of Pigs fiasco (planned by the Eisenhower\nAdministration but given the final green light by Kennedy).\n  To be sure, hen it all went down, Kennedy was at least man enough to take\nfull responsibility, which is not what I expect from Slick Willie Clinton....
Archive-name: ripem/attacks\nLast-update: 31 Mar 93 21:00:00 -0500\n\nSOME POSSIBLE ATTACKS ON RIPEM\n------------------------------\n\nThis is a living list of potential weaknesses to keep your eyes open\nfor when using RIPEM for secure electronic mail.  It does not go into\ngreat detail, and is almost certainly not exhaustive.  Obviously, many\nof the weaknesses are weaknesses of cryptographically secured mail in\ngeneral, and will pertain to secure mail programs other than RIPEM.\nIt is maintained by Marc VanHeyningen <mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu>.  It\nis posted monthly to a variety of news groups; followups pertaining\nspecifically to RIPEM should go to alt.security.ripem.\n\nCRYPTANALYSIS ATTACKS\n---------------------\n\n- Breaking RSA would allow an attacker to find out your private key,\n  in which case he could read any mail encrypted to you and sign\n  messages with your private key.\n\n  RSA is generally believed to be resistant to all standard\n  cryptanalytic techniques.  Even a standard key (about 516 bits with\n  RIPEM) is long enough to render this impractical, barring a\n  huge investment in hardware or a breakthrough in factoring.\n\n- Breaking DES would allow an attacker to read any given message,\n  since the message itself is encrypted with DES.  It would not allow\n  an attacker to claim to be you.\n\n  DES has only 56 bits in its key, and thus could conceivably be\n  compromised by brute force with sufficient hardware, but few agencies\n  have such money to devote to simply read one message.  Since each\n  message has a different DES key, the work for each message would\n  remain high.\n\nKEY MANAGEMENT ATTACKS\n----------------------\n\n- Stealing your private key would allow the same benefits as breaking\n  RSA.  To safeguard it, it is encrypted with a DES key which is derived\n  from a passphrase you type in.  However, if an attacker can get a copy\n  of your private keyfile and your passphrase (by snooping network\n  packets, tapping lines, or whatever) he could break the whole scheme.\n\n  The main risk is that of transferring either the passphrase or the\n  private key file across an untrusted link.  So don't do that.  Run \n  RIPEM on a trusted machine, preferably one sitting right in front of\n  you.  Ideally, your own machine in your own home (or maybe office)\n  which nobody else has physical access to.\n\n- Fooling you into accepting a bogus public key for someone else could \n  allow an opponent to deceive you into sending secret messages to him\n  rather than to the real recipient.  If the enemy can fool your\n  intended recipient as well, he could re-encrypt the messages with\n  the other bogus public key and pass them along.\n\n  It is important to get the proper public keys of other people.\n  The most common mechanism for this is finger; assuming the opponent\n  has not compromised routers or daemons or such, finger can be \n  given a fair amount of trust.  The strongest method of key\n  authentication is to exchange keys in person; however, this is\n  not always practical.  Having other people "vouch for you" by\n  signing a statement containing your key is possible, although \n  RIPEM doesn't have features for doing this as automatically as\n  PGP.  RIPEM does generate and check MD5 fingerprints of public keys\n  in the key files; they may be exchanged via a separate channel for\n  authentication.\n\nPLAYBACK ATTACKS\n----------------\n\n- Even if an opponent cannot break the cryptography, an opponent could\n  still cause difficulties.  For example, suppose you send a message\n  with MIC-ONLY (a PEM mode which does not provide disclosure protection)\n  to Alice which says "OK, let's do that." Your opponent intercepts\n  it, and now resends it to Bob, who now has a message which is\n  authenticated as from you telling him to do that.  Of course, he may\n  interpret it in an entirely different context.  Or your opponent\n  could transmit the same message to the same recipient much later,\n  figuring it would be seen differently at a later time.  Or the\n  opponent could change the Originator-Name: to himself, register \n  your public key as his, and send a message hoping the recipient\n  will send him return mail indicating (perhaps even quoting!) the\n  unknown message.\n\n  To defeat playback attacks, the plaintext of each message should \n  include some indication of the sender and recipient, and a unique\n  identifier (typically the date).  A good front-end script for RIPEM\n  should do this automatically (IMHO).  As a recipient, you should be\n  sure that the Originator-Name: header and the sender indicated within\n  the plaintext are the same, that you really are a recipient, and that\n  the message is not an old one.  Some this also can and should be\n  automated.  The author of this FAQ has made a modest attempt at\n  automating the process of generating and checking encapsulated\n  headers; the programs are included in the standard distribution in\n  the utils directory.\n\nLOCAL ATTACKS\n-------------\n\n- Clearly, the security of RIPEM cannot be greater than the security of\n  the machine where the encryption is performed.  For example, under\n  UNIX, a super-user could manage to get at your encrypted mail,\n  although it would take some planning and effort to do something like\n  replace the RIPEM executable with a Trojan horse or to get a copy of\n  the plaintext, depending how it's stored.\n\n  In addition, the link between you and the machine running RIPEM is\n  an extension of that.  If you decrypt with RIPEM on a remote machine\n  which you are connected to via network (or, worse yet, modem), an\n  eavesdropper could see the plaintext (and probably also your\n  passphrase.)\n\n  RIPEM should only be executed on systems you trust, obviously.  In\n  the extreme case, RIPEM should only be used on your own machine,\n  which you have total control over and which nobody else has access\n  to, which has only carefully examined software known to be free of\n  viruses, and so on.  However, there's a very real trade-off between\n  convenience and security here.\n\n  A more moderately cautious user might use RIPEM on a UNIX workstation\n  where other people have access (even root access), but increase\n  security by keeping private keys and the (statically linked, of\n  course) executable on a floppy disk.\n\n  Some people will keep RIPEM on a multi-user system, but when dialing\n  in over an insecure line, they will download the message to their\n  own system and perform the RIPEM decryption there.  However, the\n  security provided by such a mechanism is somewhat illusory; since\n  you presumably type your cleartext password to log in, you've just\n  given away the store, since the attacker can now log in as you and\n  install traps in your account to steal your private key next time\n  you use it from a less insecure line.  This will likely remain the\n  situation as long as most systems use the rather quaint mechanism of\n  cleartext password authentication.\n\n  I find it nice to put a brief statement of how carefully I manage my\n  security arrangement in my .plan next to my public key, so that\n  potential correspondents can be aware what level of precautions are\n  in place.  Some people use two keys, a short one which is not\n  carefully managed for ordinary use and a longer one which is treated\n  with greater care for critical correspondence.\n\nUNTRUSTED PARTNER ATTACKS\n-------------------------\n\n- RIPEM's encryption will ensure that only a person with the private key\n  corresponding to the public key used to encrypt the data may read the\n  traffic.  However, once someone with that key gets the message, she\n  may always make whatever kind of transformations she wishes.  There \n  exist no cryptographic barriers to a recipient, say, taking an\n  ENCRYPTED message and converting it to a MIC-ONLY message, signed by\n  you and readable by anyone, although RIPEM does not provide this\n  functionality.  Indeed, the latest PEM draft I have seen specifically\n  states that such transformations should be possible to allow\n  forwarding functions to work.
Hmmmm.  I think, with really large keyspaces like this, you need to\nalter the strategy discussed for DES.  Attempt decryption of several\nblocks, and check the disctribution of the contents.  I don't think it's\nat all feasible to keep 2**80 encryptions of a known plaintext block on\n*any* amount of tape or CD-ROM.  And certainly not 2**128 such encrypted\nblocks.  (Anyone know a cheap way of converting every atom in the solar\nsystem into a one bit storage device?)\n \n   Actually, a keysearch of this kind shouldn't be much worse than the\nsimpler kind in terms of speed.  It's just that you have to do it over\nfor *every* encrypted message.\n \n   Dumb question:  Has anyone ever done any serious research on how many\nlegitimate ASCII-encoded 8-byte blocks there are that could be part of\nan english sentence?  For attacking DES in ECB mode, it seems like a\ndictionary of this kind might be pretty valuable....
[Text deleted, no value judgement implied]\n\n\nMore than shocking.  What this says to me is no less than that government\nis very interested in monitoring the public.  This does more than scare me,\nit mortifies me.\n\nPGP and RIPEM must become widespread enough to resist what Mr. Finney has\n[IMHO correctly] identified as the next logical step.  What was once an\nacademic discussion with regard to concealing cyphertext, has now become\na real consideration.\n\nThe rhetoric that the clinton administration seems obsessed with, harmony,\neither or propositions, tension, tells me that they know how difficult\nit will be to sell this proposition.\n\nThe phrase I hear more and more is "I can't believe this is actually happening\nhere."

Reasonably fancy.\n\nStandard "voice" circuits run at 56kbps inter-exchange in the US.\nTherefore, you need to achieve 4:1 to get standard voice quality.\n\nIf you're willing to give up some quality, you need only 2:1.  This is still\nacceptable from a speech standpoint; it will be a little less faithful to\nthe original, but certainly intelligable.  That's all you really need for\nthis application.

Even if what Brad says turns out to be accurate, you can bet that the\nAdministration will have made it "very clear" to the vendors that "it\nwould very much be in their best interests" to institute a "voluntary"\npolicy of refusing to sell anything but Clinton Cripple equipped equipment\nto anyone other than "Authorized government agencies and Law Enforcement",\nor individuals and corporations who "have been been determined by the\nAdministration to have a valid need on a case-by-case basis" for an\neffective system.\n\nNote that this is very much like the language used in many gun control\nbills/laws the Administration is pushing for, or otherwise supporting.\nThe logic and actual rationale (as opposed to the excuses that get fed\nto the media) is the same in both cases, only the items or technology\nin question are different.\n\nI think this is no accident.  It comes from the same philosophy that\nthe government rules/controls the people, not the people controlling\nthe government, that the unconnected citizens are not sophisticated enough\nto know what is best for them, so the government must tell the people\nwhat they need or do not need ... "we know best...".  And the idea that\nthat a commoner can defend himself against government eavesdropping\nor unlawful attack is totally unacceptable to people with this outlook.\n\n\nCombine this all with pushing for national identity cards with 'smart\nchips' to encode anything they please (internal passport) under the\nguise of streamlining the State People's Health Care System, and with\n(you can be certain) more jewels yet to come, and one sees an extremely\nominous trend.  So what if "1984" will be ten years late... it still is\nturning out to be an amazingly accurate prophecy... unless a LOT of\npeople wake up, and in a hurry.\n\nOne should ALWAYS have every red warning light and bell and danger flag\ncome up when the government seeks to set itself apart in regard to\nrights, etc.  from the unconnected/unprivileged citizen (or should we\nnow be saying 'subject' instead?)...  Why SHOULDN'T the average person\nhave a good, secure system of data security, not dependent on nebulous\n'safeguards' for maintaining that security?  Why SHOULDN'T the average\nperson be able to defend himself from an agency gone rogue?  0I am sure\nthe Feds could break into any data they really wanted to (but it would\ntake some WORK), and using the same logic, one should not be allowed to\nhave a good safe, unless a duplicate of the key(s) or combination are\nsubmitted for 'safekeeping' by the government?  I don't really see a\ndifference, philosophically.  Encrypted data sure won't evaporate, not\nwith such high-tech tools as a TAPE RECORDER...
One presumes the system could work as follows:\n\na) Blank clips are manufactured by Mykotronx and VLSI.  The number\nproduced is carefully audited and they are shipped to the first\nescrow house.\n\nIt programs the chips with its half the key, and prints out a paper slip\nwith the key half and non-secret chip serial number.   The reams of paper\nare filed in locked boxes in the vault, a fuse is burnt in the chip so\nthat the key is now unreadable.\n\nThe chip then goes to the next escrow house, where the same thing is\ndone.  This continues through N escrow houses, perhaps, could be more than\n2.\n\nThe last one provides the chip to the cellular phone maker.\n\nAnd yes, this has to be a public key system or it would be almost\nimpossible to handle.  It might not be RSA, but that does not mean\nthat PKP doesn't get paid.  Until 1997, PKP has the patent on the\ngeneral concept of public key encryption, as well as the particular\nimplementation known as RSA.

I must admit that this point has been running through my mind for most of\nthe discussion: one the dice are out there, it won't be long before someone\ndecaps it and, after a bit of work, has full details of the Clipper\nalgorythm.  This isn't trivial to do, but then again, it is not impossibly\ndifficult either.  Any half way decent VLSI design student should be able\nto take a photograph of a technology s/he is familiar with, and given a\ndescription of the input, output, control and supply lines, figure out \nthe function of various subsystems on the die.  Indeed, this is not an\nuncommon exercise performed during training (because it makes you think\nabout design decisions made by other designers.\n\nI could speculate that these chips are going to be manufactured using\n"tamperproof" carriers (unlikely - such techniques are *very* expensive\nand this thing is supposed to be relatively cheap to produce), or that\nthere will be some legal or legislative framework to prevent publication\nof the algorythm (unlikely - please correct me if I am wrong but aren't these\nsupposed to be sold internationally?).  I suppose that the most likely\nreason the algorythm is remaining secret for the moment is that some idiot\nbureaucrat, untrammeled by the realities of the situation, decided that\n"well, we should keep it a secret because it is supposed to be secret,\nisn't it?"\n\nJust some random thoughts...

Since the wiretap chip is being distributed internationally,\nallowing the U.S. government to spy on foreign governments,\ncompanies and people as as well as to wiretap domestic citizens,\nthis is a world-wide issue.  Please put DISTRIBUTION: WORLD on the \nDistrubution: line.  Thank you.\n\n\n\nYou don't care that people are being lied to, fooled into believing\nthe chip gives "privacy" when it fact it allows wiretaps?  You\ndon't give a shit about anybody's privacy except your own?  (And\nnot even your own; are you so smart that you know when you're talking to\nsomebody who has a wiretap chip on their phone instead of a privacy\nchip with private keys?)\n\n\n"Simply?" "Everyone" should have this attitude?   The only people\nwho can have this attitude are the most hard-core\ncomputer hackers, who never make phone calls away from their\ncomputer, who apparently never call anybody except another computer \nhacker, or perhaps another spook (U.S. classified agents refuse to use\ntheir own system, only oblivious civilian dupes get that dubious privilege).\nOnly spooks and hard-core hackers need privacy, huh?\n\nWe *do* need an alternative to NSA-bugged telephones, but\nwe're talking inexpensive *telephones* here, including hand-sized\ncellulars, that need strong crypto, real privacy.  Make-shift\ncomputer hacker rigs that require living by your computer to\ntalk privately over the phone are just a dumb stunt that doesn't \ndo anything for anybody's privacy in the real world.  \n\nWhat we need is a true *privacy chip*.  For example, a real-time \nvoice-encryption RSA, put it into a silicon compiler and spit out ASIC.  \nPut this chip on the market as a de facto standard for international \nbusiness, diplomats, and private communications.  If the U.S. bans \nit, we make it somewhere else and import it.  The Japanese, German,\nDutch, Taiwanese, Korean, etc. electronics companies don't want the \nNSA spying on them.

Here's a simple way to convert the Clipper proposal to an unexceptionable\n   one: Make it voluntary.\n\n   That is--you get high quality secure NSA classified technology if you agree\n   to escrow your key. Otherwise you are on your own.\n\nThat's the disturbing part - use of other products IS voluntary, for now,\nand the press releases talk about the White House's unwillingness to\ndecide that citizens have a right to good commercial crypto gear,\nand about how commercial alternatives will be permitted as long as\nthey provide key escrow services.  That's a clear implication that\nthey're considering banning alternatives.\n\nAdditionally, use of real alternatives ISN'T totally legal -\nyou're not allowed to export really good crypto equipment except to\nthe government's friends (e.g. the Australian government)\nyou can only export even BAD crypto equipment with their permission,\nand the regulators who control the cellular telephone companies make\nsure there are only two competitors, so Joe's Garage Cellular can't\nstart offering a secure service.

In previous postings by Hellman, Bellovin, etal it was\nreported the Big Brother (Clipper) chip will encrypt plaintext in\n64 bit blocks as is done with DES.  The users key K which can be\nderived from RSA, Diffy-Hellman, etc. is used to encrypt\nplaintext M and is then used to form a "three part message".\n     This three part message consists of E[M; K], K encrypted\nwith some other key, and the chip serial number.  This three part\nmessage is then encrypted by still another key.\n     My question is: What is a message?\n     For example, say we are dealing with an encrypted digitized\nvoice application.  The speech waveform is sampled and digitized\nand then some number of samples are grouped into a 64 bit block.\nThis block is then encrypted and transmitted over a non-secure\ncommunications link.\n     Where is the three part message?  Is something appended to\neach 64 bit block?  Is a header sent at the beginning of the\nsession?\n     If the header is sent at the beginning of the session, how\ndo they insure the equipment manufacturer using the chip does\njust that?  Can just anyone manufacture products using the chip?\nIs a facility clearance required to manufacture?\n     Any ideas?
Another objection occurred to me.  There was a comment about how\nsupposedly there would only be one decode box, operated by the FBI.\nThis is flat ridiculous, and I don't believe it for a millisecond.\nEven *if* they in fact only build one (or two or some other small\nnumber) of these, that won't stop others from building one.  Make\nit work like two Clipper-chip phones, one listening to each side\nof the recorded conversation.  I'll have to have another look at\nthe specs posted so far, but offhand I didn't see anything that\nwould preclude this sort of thing.....
While I didn't try the expansion personally, I know of at least two\nother people who did and got the same results.  Your allegation is\nincorrect at best.
The recent discussion in this news group suggests that a key search attack  \nagainst DES is quite feasible now. But normally DES is applied in CBC or CFB  \nmode where one chooses a random init vector of 8 bytes. Questions:\n\n - Makes it sense to handle the init vector as an additional key? Then we have  \na 56 + 64 = 120 bit key.\n \n - If yes: Is anything known about the security of this key scheme? Can we  \nbreak it faster than by exhaustive search through the 120 bit key space?

My betting is that that too is classified.\n\n   Unless there has been a _major_ change in the law, there's no such beast\n   as a "classified patent."  Patents exist to encourage communications and\n   develop the state of the art. \n\nWhile there aren't classified patents, there are "patent secrecy orders".\n\nSuppose you invent a voice scrambler for CB radio, and apply for a patent.\nThe Patent Office decides the NSA might be interested, gives them a copy\nof your application, and you get a nice note back saying your patent\napplication has now been classified for national security reasons and\nyou're no longer allowed to make and sell it.  \nI'm picking this example because it happened in the late 1970s.\nIt was probably some analog scrambler, and would have probably\nviolated FCC rules anyway, but it did get classified.\n\nOr suppose you publish a paper on your Really Spiffy Algorithm and\nthen file a patent application.  Since it's been published,\nthey can't gain anything by classifying it, though you can't get\npatents in most countries other than the US, where patent laws are different.\n\nObviously a system of classified patents would be highly bogus\n"You can't sell that widget, because there's a classified patent on it.\nYou're not allowed to see the patent, or know who owns the design,\nso just give us all your money and work in progress and maybe we won't throw\nyou in jail for espionage."  Some countries might have that kind of\nsystem :-(, but we don't have that here.  Quite.  Yet.
I would think that you could reduce the defense of using non-clipper\nbased encryption technologies to defending freedom of expression \n(IE, free speech).  That you have to right to express whatever you\nwant in whatever form your little heart desires so long as you do\nnot impinge on the rights of others.\n\nEncrypted text/sound/video is just another form of expression of that\nparticular text/sound/video.  Just like digitized sound is another \nmeans of expression of sound -- streams of 100100101111 instead of\ncontinuous waveforms.\n\nAlso, it shouldn't be up to the government at all.  Encryption \n_Standards_ can be decided upon by Independent Standards Orgainizations\n(apologies for the acronym).  One can note how well this has worked\nwith ISO and the Metric System, SAE, etc.  Independent entities \nor consortia of people/industries in that particular area are far\nmore qualified to set standards than any One government agency.\nConsider for example what the Ascii character set would have looked\nlike if it was decided by the government.\n\nI hope this helps folks to formulate their defenses.  I'm still working\non mine and hope to be faxing my congressmen soon...
I don't find this a credible argument, for two reasons.  One you have\nsupplied below: unless I care about entering the USA at any time in the\nfuture (eg. the Taiwanese backyard cloners - who BTW have been known to\ndecap custom silicon and reproduce it on daughterboards when pirating\nhigh-profit arcade machines and the like - who wouldn't care less), I am not \ngoing to care much about US confidentiality, am I?  Only people like the\nreal me, who does care about travelling to various countries for business\nreasons, will sit up and follow laws like this, but I would contend that\nwe're not the main threat.\n\nI also have grave doubts whether an algorythm widely distributed in silicon\ncould possibly be called "classified."  It's like handing out military\nsecrets to the whole world in envelopes marked "don't open me."  I can\nimagine several credible defences which could be employed if it came to\na trial.  One would be the stupidity of the government's actions.\n\n\nAmusing thought: could they have employed an algorythm which is infeasable\nfor a fast software implementation, but which is easy in custom hardware?\nIn DES, the extensive use of permutation tables (trivial in hardware: you\njust swap bus lines), but relatively slow in software have had a big effect\non the speed difference between hardware and software implementations of\nthat cipher (indeed, I suspect that Lucifer's designers were well aware that\nit would be, and approved.)  Certain algorythms (usually parallel search\nalgorythms) can be very slow in software, yet can fly in custom hardware.\nI have no proof of their employment in Clipper -- it is pure conjecture.  \nHowever, as a software implementation of this cipher is something that its \ndesigners would have been trying to avoid at all costs, then the inclusion \nof such techniques seems credible.\n\nHmmm... I also wonder what Intergraph thinks about the use of the name\n"Clipper" for this device. :)
Archive-name: cryptography-faq/part09\nLast-modified: 1993/4/15\n\n\nFAQ for sci.crypt, part 9: Other Miscellany\n\nThis is the ninth of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ. The parts are\nmostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.\nWe don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.\nNotes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.\n\nThe sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu \nas /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography \nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers \nevery 21 days.\n\n\nContents:\n\n* What is the National Security Agency (NSA)?\n* What are the US export regulations?\n* What is TEMPEST?\n* What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?\n* What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch?\n* Is RSA patented?\n* What about the Voynich manuscript?\n\n\n* What is the National Security Agency (NSA)?\n\n  The NSA is the official security body of the U.S. government. It\n  was given its charter by President Truman in the late 40's, and\n  has continued research in cryptology till the present. The NSA is\n  known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world,\n  and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the\n  world. Governments in general have always been prime employers of\n  cryptologists. The NSA probably possesses cryptographic expertise many\n  years ahead of the public state of the art, and can undoubtedly break\n  many of the systems used in practice; but for reasons of national\n  security almost all information about the NSA is classified.\n\n  Bamford's book [BAMFD] gives a history of the people and operations of\n  the NSA. The following quote from Massey [MAS88] highlights the\n  difference between public and private research in cryptography:\n\n  ``... if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government,\n  one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted\n  behind closed doors. Without doubt, the number of workers engaged\n  today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of\n  those engaged in open research in cryptology. For only about 10\n  years has there in fact been widespread open research in\n  cryptology. There have been, and will continue to be, conflicts\n  between these two research communities. Open research is common\n  quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open\n  exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in\n  scholarly journals. But can a government agency, charged with\n  responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations,\n  countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break? Can\n  a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might\n  undermine the effectiveness of his own government's code-breakers?\n  One might argue that publication of a provably-secure cipher would\n  force all governments to behave like Stimson's `gentlemen', but one\n  must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with\n  political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most\n  scientific fields. The wonder is not that some conflicts have\n  occurred between government agencies and open researchers in\n  cryptology, but rather that these conflicts (at least those of which\n  we are aware) have been so few and so mild.''\n\n* What are the US export regulations?\n\n  In a nutshell, there are two government agencies which control\n  export of encryption software. One is the Bureau of Export\n  Administration (BXA) in the Department of Commerce, authorized by\n  the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Another is the Office\n  of Defense Trade Controls (DTC) in the State Department, authorized\n  by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). As a rule\n  of thumb, BXA (which works with COCOM) has less stringent\n  requirements, but DTC (which takes orders from NSA) wants to see\n  everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to BXA.\n\n  The newsgroup misc.legal.computing carries many interesting\n  discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export, what\n  people think about those laws, and many other complex issues which\n  go beyond the scope of technical groups like sci.crypt. Make sure to\n  consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in\n  jail; if you are lucky, your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at\n  least heard of the ITAR.\n\n* What is TEMPEST?\n\n  TEMPEST is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer\n  equipment. It was created in response to the discovery that\n  information can be read from computer radiation (e.g., from a CRT) at\n  quite a distance and with little effort.\n\n  Needless to say, encryption doesn't do much good if the cleartext\n  is available this way.\n\n* What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?\n\n  (Thanks to Jim Gillogly for this information and John King for\n  corrections.)\n\n  The story in a pamphlet by J. B. Ward (1885) goes: Thomas\n  Jefferson Beale and a party of adventurers accumulated a huge mass\n  of treasure and buried it in Bedford County, Virginia, leaving\n  three ciphers with an innkeeper; the ciphers describe the\n  location, contents, and intended beneficiaries of the treasure.\n  Ward gives a decryption of the second cipher (contents) called B2;\n  it was encrypted as a book cipher using the initial letters of the\n  Declaration of Independence (DOI) as key. B1 and B3 are unsolved;\n  many documents have been tried as the key to B1.\n\n  Aficionados can join a group that attempts to solve B1 by various\n  means with an eye toward splitting the treasure:\n\n  The Beale Cypher Association\n  P.O. Box 975\n  Beaver Falls, PA 15010\n\n  You can get the ciphers from the rec.puzzles FAQL by including the\n  line:\n\n  send index\n\n  in a message to netlib@peregrine.com and following the directions.\n  (There are apparently several different versions of the cipher\n  floating around. The correct version is based on the 1885 pamphlet,\n  says John King <kingj@hpcc01.corp.hp.com>.)\n\n  Some believe the story is a hoax. Kruh [KRU88] gives a long list of\n  problems with the story. Gillogly [GIL80] decrypted B1 with the DOI\n  and found some unexpected strings, including ABFDEFGHIIJKLMMNOHPP.\n  Hammer (president of the Beale Cypher Association) agrees that this\n  string couldn't appear by chance, but feels there must be an\n  explanation; Gwyn (sci.crypt expert) is unimpressed with this\n  string.\n\n* What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch?\n\n  The ACA is an organization devoted to cryptography, with an emphasis\n  on cryptanalysis of systems that can be attacked either with\n  pencil-and-paper or computers. Its organ ``The Cryptogram'' includes\n  articles and challenge ciphers. Among the more than 50 cipher types in\n  English and other languages are simple substitution, Playfair,\n  Vigenere, bifid, Bazeries, grille, homophonic, and cryptarithm.\n\n  Dues are $15 for one year (6 issues); more outside of North America;\n  less for students under 18 and seniors. Subscriptions should be sent\n  to ACA Treasurer, 18789 West Hickory St., Mundelein, IL 60060.\n\n* Is RSA patented?\n\n  Yes. The patent number is 4,405,829, filed 12/14/77, granted 9/20/83.\n  For further discussion of this patent, whether it should have been\n  granted, algorithm patents in general, and related legal and moral\n  issues, see comp.patents and misc.legal.computing. For information\n  about the League for Programming Freedom see [FTPPF]. Note that one of\n  the original purposes of comp.patents was to collect questions such as\n  ``should RSA be patented?'', which often flooded sci.crypt and other\n  technical newsgroups, into a more appropriate forum.\n\n* What about the Voynich manuscript?\n\n  nelson@reed.edu (Nelson Minar) says there is a mailing list on the\n  subject.  the address to write to subscribe to the VMS mailing list\n  is: <voynich-request@rand.org>\n\n  the ftp archive is: rand.org:/pub/voynich
I agree.  This is the danger I see, not the system itself.  That is to say, \nthis is a political issue, not a technical one.

The Cryptography \nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers \nevery 21 days.\n\n\n\nContents:\n\n* What is cryptology? Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key?\n* What references can I start with to learn cryptology?\n* How does one go about cryptanalysis?\n* What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance?\n* What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem?\n* If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it\n  guaranteed analysis-proof in practice?\n* Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are\n  relatively easy to break?\n\n\n* What is cryptology? Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key?\n\n  The story begins: When Julius Caesar sent messages to his trusted\n  acquaintances, he didn't trust the messengers. So he replaced every A\n  by a C, every B by a D, and so on through the alphabet. Only someone\n  who knew the ``shift by 2'' rule could decipher his messages.\n\n  A cryptosystem or cipher system is a method of disguising messages so\n  that only certain people can see through the disguise. Cryptography is\n  the art of creating and using cryptosystems. Cryptanalysis is the art\n  of breaking cryptosystems---seeing through the disguise even when\n  you're not supposed to be able to. Cryptology is the study of both\n  cryptography and cryptanalysis.\n\n  The original message is called a plaintext. The disguised message is\n  called a ciphertext. Encryption means any procedure to convert\n  plaintext into ciphertext. Decryption means any procedure to convert\n  ciphertext into plaintext.\n\n  A cryptosystem is usually a whole collection of algorithms. The\n  algorithms are labelled; the labels are called keys. For instance,\n  Caesar probably used ``shift by n'' encryption for several different\n  values of n. It's natural to say that n is the key here.\n\n  The people who are supposed to be able to see through the disguise are\n  called recipients. Other people are enemies, opponents, interlopers,\n  eavesdroppers, or third parties.\n\n* What references can I start with to learn cryptology?\n\n  For an introduction to technical matter, the survey articles given\n  in part 10 are the best place to begin as they are, in general,\n  concise, authored by competent people, and well written. However,\n  these articles are mostly concerned with cryptology as it has\n  developed in the last 50 years or so, and are more abstract and\n  mathematical than historical. The Codebreakers by Kahn [KAH67] is\n  encyclopedic in its history and technical detail of cryptology up\n  to the mid-60's.\n\n  Introductory cryptanalysis can be learned from Gaines [GAI44] or\n  Sinkov [SIN66]. This is recommended especially for people who want\n  to devise their own encryption algorithms since it is a common\n  mistake to try to make a system before knowing how to break one.\n\n  The selection of an algorithm for the DES drew the attention of\n  many public researchers to problems in cryptology. Consequently\n  several textbooks and books to serve as texts have appeared. The\n  book of Denning [DEN82] gives a good introduction to a broad range\n  of security including encryption algorithms, database security,\n  access control, and formal models of security. Similar comments\n  apply to the books of Price & Davies [PRI84] and Pfleeger [PFL89].\n\n  The books of Konheim [KON81] and Meyer & Matyas [MEY82] are quite\n  technical books. Both Konheim and Meyer were directly involved in\n  the development of DES, and both books give a thorough analysis of\n  DES. Konheim's book is quite mathematical, with detailed analyses\n  of many classical cryptosystems. Meyer and Matyas concentrate on\n  modern cryptographic methods, especially pertaining to key management\n  and the integration of security facilities into computer systems and\n  networks.\n\n  The books of Rueppel [RUE86] and Koblitz [KOB89] concentrate on\n  the application of number theory and algebra to cryptography.\n\n* How does one go about cryptanalysis?\n\n  Classical cryptanalysis involves an interesting combination of\n  analytical reasoning, application of mathematical tools, pattern\n  finding, patience, determination, and luck. The best available\n  textbooks on the subject are the Military Cryptanalytics series\n  [FRIE1]. It is clear that proficiency in cryptanalysis is, for\n  the most part, gained through the attempted solution of given\n  systems. Such experience is considered so valuable that some of the\n  cryptanalyses performed during WWII by the Allies are still\n  classified.\n\n  Modern public-key cryptanalysis may consist of factoring an integer,\n  or taking a discrete logarithm. These are not the traditional fare\n  of the cryptanalyst. Computational number theorists are some of the\n  most successful cryptanalysts against public key systems.\n\n* What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance?\n\n  In a nutshell: If f(x) = y and you know y and can compute f, you can\n  find x by trying every possible x. That's brute-force search.\n\n  Example: Say a cryptanalyst has found a plaintext and a corresponding\n  ciphertext, but doesn't know the key. He can simply try encrypting the\n  plaintext using each possible key, until the ciphertext matches---or\n  decrypting the ciphertext to match the plaintext, whichever is faster.\n  Every well-designed cryptosystem has such a large key space that this\n  brute-force search is impractical.\n    \n  Advances in technology sometimes change what is considered\n  practical. For example, DES, which has been in use for over 10 years\n  now, has 2^56, or about 10^17, possible keys. A computation with\n  this many operations was certainly unlikely for most users in the\n  mid-70's. The situation is very different today given the dramatic\n  decrease in cost per processor operation. Massively parallel\n  machines threaten the security of DES against brute force search.\n  Some scenarios are described by Garron and Outerbridge [GAR91].\n\n  One phase of a more sophisticated cryptanalysis may involve a\n  brute-force search of some manageably small space of possibilities.\n\n* What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem?\n\n  The security of a strong system resides with the secrecy of the key\n  rather than with an attempt to keep the algorithm itself secret.\n\n  A strong cryptosystem has a large keyspace, as mentioned above.  The\n  unicity distance is a measure which gives the minimum amount of\n  ciphertext that must be intercepted to uniquely identify the key and\n  if for some key, the unicity distance is much longer than the amount\n  of ciphertext you intend to encrypt under that key, the system is\n  probably strong.\n\n  A strong cryptosystem will certainly produce ciphertext which appears\n  random to all standard statistical tests (see, for example, [CAE90]).\n    \n  A strong cryptosystem will resist all known previous attacks. A\n  system which has never been subjected to scrutiny is suspect.\n\n  If a system passes all the tests mentioned above, is it necessarily\n  strong? Certainly not. Many weak cryptosystems looked good at first.\n  However, sometimes it is possible to show that a cryptosystem is\n  strong by mathematical proof. ``If Joe can break this system, then\n  he can also solve the well-known difficult problem of factoring\n  integers.'' See part 6.  Failing that, it's a crap shoot.\n\n* If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it\n  guaranteed analysis-proof in practice?\n\n  Cryptanalytic methods include what is known as ``practical\n  cryptanalysis'': the enemy doesn't have to just stare at your\n  ciphertext until he figures out the plaintext. For instance, he might\n  assume ``cribs''---stretches of probable plaintext. If the crib is\n  correct then he might be able to deduce the key and then decipher the\n  rest of the message. Or he might exploit ``isologs''---the same\n  plaintext enciphered in several cryptosystems or several keys. Thus\n  he might obtain solutions even when cryptanalytic theory says he\n  doesn't have a chance.\n\n  Sometimes, cryptosystems malfunction or are misused. The one-time pad,\n  for example, loses all security if it is used more than once! Even\n  chosen-plaintext attacks, where the enemy somehow feeds plaintext into\n  the encryptor until he can deduce the key, have been employed. See\n  [KAH67].\n  \n* Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are\n  relatively easy to break?
It seems likely to me that that a large subset of encrypted communications\nwould be archived to tape so they could be read if sometime in the future\nprobable cause arises and a warrant is obtained.  I can even imagine this\nbeing found legal and constitutional, since nothing is actually listened to\nuntil a valid warrant is issued and the keys are obtained.\n\nImagine archiving all pay-phone conversations, so if someone turns out\nto be a drug dealer, you can listen to all their past drug deals.  And\narchive calls to/from suspected Mafia members, potential terrorists,\nradicals, etc.  Imagine the convenience for the police of being able to\nget a warrant now and listening to all the calls the World Trade Center\nbombers made in the past year.\n\nSince archiving would be such a powerful tool and so easy to do, why\nwouldn't it happen?
I guess the cryptowranglers read this group too.  But of\ncourse I knew that because it is so easy to do.  There is\nnot a single doubt in my mind that every byte that passes\nevery significant gateway or 'bone is captured for the\ncolligation of data about __________?  (Maybe your name is here).\n\nMaybe we should start a newsgroup for the distribution of encrypted \nposts intended of members of affinity groups with a shared private\nkey.  For example at the coming up Cypherpunks meeting, a private\nkey corresponding to that particular meeting could be passed out\nby a moderator.  Minutes, followup comments to other participants,\nand so on could be posted to the alt.encrypted group for the use\nof the people who attended. Communiques intended by the group for\nnon-attendees could of course just be signed using the private key\nbut otherwises not encrypted.\n\nStarting a alt.encrypted newsgroup rather than just maintaining\nmailing lists is better for several reasons.  First, it would be\neasier to archive for people who might join a group "late" and\nwho might like to easily read earlier posts; second, traffic analysis\nto know exactly to whom an affinity message is directed would be foiled;\nthree, a newsgroup is much more public and would serve to publicize\navailable privacy measures on the internet.\n\nAnd it would be fun to accumulate a secret keyring full of such\nkeys -- it beats giving out t-shirts as a door prize.\n\nWe could send a copy of alt.encrypted directly to Judge William\nSessions or Admiral Studeman to save them the time of having it\ncollected for them.
It already does.
April 16, 1993\n\nINITIAL EFF ANALYSIS OF CLINTON PRIVACY AND SECURITY PROPOSAL\n\nThe Clinton Administration today made a major announcement on\ncryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of\nmillions of Americans.  The first part of the plan is to begin a\ncomprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as\nexport controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to\nrobust encryption, and law enforcement issues posed by new technology.\n\nHowever, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has already\nreached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before any\npublic comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the\nAdministration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone\nequipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the\nNational Security Agency.  The so-called "Clipper Chip" is an 80-bit,\nsplit key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips\nmanufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow agents would\nstore users' keys, and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon\npresentation of a valid warrant.  The encryption scheme used is to be\nclassified, but the chips will be available to any manufacturer for\nincorporation into its communications products.\n\n     This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .\n\nFirst, the Administration has adopted a solution before conducting an\ninquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper Chip may not be the most secure\nproduct. Other vendors or developers may have better schemes.\nFurthermore, we should not rely on the government as the sole source for\nthe Clipper or any other chips.  Rather, independent chip manufacturers\nshould be able to produce chipsets based on open standards.\n\nSecond, an algorithm cannot be trusted unless it can be tested. Yet, the\nAdministration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified.  EFF\nbelieves that any standard adopted ought to be public and open.  The\npublic will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is\nopen to independent, expert scrutiny.  \n\nThird, while the use of the use of a split-key, dual escrowed system may\nprove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement\nneeds, the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is\nadopted.  What will give people confidence in the safety of their keys? \nDoes disclosure of keys to a third party waive an individual's Fifth\nAmendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries?  These are but a few\nof the many questions the Administrations proposal raised but fails to\nanswer.\n\nIn sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance\nof these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy\nand security.  However, the "Clipper Chip" solution ought to be\nconsidered as part of the inquiry, and not be adopted before the\ndiscussion even begins.\n\nDETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:\n\nESCROW\n\nThe 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of whom\nhold 40-bits of each key.  The manufacturer of the communications device\nwould be required to register all keys with the two independent escrow\nagents.  A key is tied to the device, however, not the person using it.\n\nUpon presentation of a valid court order, the two escrow agents would\nhave to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents.  According to\nthe Presidential Directive just issued, the Attorney General will be\nasked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the Administration\nhave suggested that one non-law enforcement federal agency (perhaps the\nFederal Reserve), and one non-governmental organization could be chosen,\nbut there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet.\n\nCLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS\n\nThe Administration claims that there are no back doors -- means by which\nthe government or others could break the code without securing keys from\nthe escrow agents -- and that the President will be told there are no\nback doors to this classified algorithm.  In order to prove this,\nAdministration sources are interested in arranging for an all-star crypto\ncracker team to come in, under a security arrangement, and examine the\nalgorithm for trap doors.  The results of the investigation would then be\nmade public.\n\nThe Clipper Chipset was designed and is being produced and a sole-source,\nsecret contract between the National Security Agency and two private\nfirms:  VLSI and Mycotronx.  NSA work on this plan has been underway for\nabout four years.  The manufacturing contract was let 14 months ago.\n\nGOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER\n\nIn order to get a market moving, and to show that the government believes\nin the security of this system, the feds will be the first big customers\nfor this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service, VP Al\nGore, and maybe even the President.  At today's Commerce Department press\nbriefing, a number of people asked this question, though:  why would any\nprivate organization or individual adopt a classified standard that had\nno independent guaranty of security or freedom from trap doors?\n\nCOMPREHENSIVE POLICY INQUIRY\n\nThe Administration has also announced that it is about to commence an\ninquiry into all policy issues related to privacy protection, encryption,\nand law enforcement.  The items to be considered include:  export\ncontrols on encryption technology and the FBI's Digital Telephony\nProposal.  It appears that the this inquiry will be conducted by the\nNational Security Council.  Unfortunately, however, the Presidential\nDirective describing the inquiry is classified.  Some public involvement\nin the process has been promised, but they terms have yet to be specified.\n\nFROM MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:\n\nJerry Berman, Executive Director (jberman@eff.org)\nDaniel J. Weitzner, Senior Staff Counsel (djw@eff.org)\n\nFull text of the Press releases and Fact Sheets issued by the\nAdministration will be available on EFF's ftp site.
Having read the various "Clipper" announcements on the net over the last few \ndays and a LOT of uninformed speculation about the chip, its uses,\ngovernment plots, etc, I have the following questions.\n\n  1) What does the "Clipper chip" actually implement? Just the Skipjack\n	cryptographic algorithm? Or does it also implement a "chip to chip"\n	communications protocol? If it does implement a communications\n	protocol, can it be used as just a "crypt chip" also.\n\n  2) Where can the chip specifications and spec sheets be obtained?\n\n  3) Who may purchase them and under what conditions?\n\n  4) Are there restrictions as to how the chip may be used in a system?\n\n  5) The security of the algorithm and the encrypted communications does\n	not appear to require that the "Family key" be a secret. Why is\n	it a secret? What happens when the "family key" becomes well known?\n	If it's a secret to make traffic analysis more difficult, does\n	the "Law enforcement message" contain any random information?\n	How much and how random is it?\n\n  6) Can the chip be programmed to reveal the "Unit key"? The chip "serial\n	number"? Any of the programming parameters?\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRaymond S. Brand					rbrand@usasoc.soc.mil

For those of you looking for information on MS-DOS 6.0's\nfile system compression API:\n\nToday I called Microsoft's DOS 6.0 hotline at (800)228-7007.\nThey told me that the DOS 6.0 Resource Kit had the specifications\nfor the compression interface.  The Resource Kit costs $19.95,\nplus tax and $5 shipping.\n\nI ordered a copy and will post further when I get it and know more\nabout it.  I am posting now because the order turnaround is 15 \nworking days.  \n\nIf anyone knows for sure where's there's a good\nsource of info on this API, please speak up.  I am \nslightly skeptical about the Resource Kit's likelihood\nof having detailed programming info.\n\nMark R.  mrr@ripem.msu.edu

As promised, I spoke today with the company mentioned in a Washington\nTimes article about the Clipper chip announcement. The name of the company\nis Secure Communicatiions Technology (Information will be given at the end\nof this message on how to contact them).\n\n   Basically they are disturbed about the announcement for many reasons that\nwe are. More specifically however, Mr. Bryen of Secure Communications\nbrought to light many points that might interest most of the readers.\n\n   His belief is that AT&T was made known of the clipper well before the\nrest of the industry. This is for several reasons, several of which are:\n\n - A company of AT&T's size could never be able to make a decision to use\n   the new chip on the SAME DAY it was announced.\n\n - Months ago they proposed using their own chip for AT&T's secure telephone\n   devices. AT&T basically blew them off as being not interested at all.\n   This stuck them as strange, until now...\n\n\n   Also I spoke with Art Melnick, their cryptographer, he expressed several\nconcerns over the new Clipper Chip:\n\n  - The obvious backdoor will be able to let many people decrypt the code.\n\n  - Once the key is released to authorities the security of the crypto\n    system is lost forever. These keys can end up in the hands of any agency\n    of the government.\n\n  - The fact that the escrowed keys never change means that the algorithm\n    is vulnerable over time to an attacker.\n\n  - The classified algorithm may hide another backdoor. But he feels that\n    it is probably to keep people from forging fake serial numbers, or\n    changing the keys themselves.\n\n  - Additionally he feels that the NSA has probably spent enough time and\n    money in working on a way to keep this chip from being reversed\n    engineered, that he feels that reverse engineering it will be very\n    difficult to do. He feels that they have developed a suitable technique\n    to protect the chip from this attack. Also he feels that the chip is\n    hardware encoded with the algorithm and not microcoded onto the chip.\n\nAdditonally I spoke with Mr. Melnick about their algorithm. He couldn't tell\nme much about their new agorithm because it hasn't been patented yet.\nHowever he told me a little:\n\n - The algorithm will be released for public review after patents have been\n   granted for it. This is so the crypto community can see that it is\n   secure.\n\n - The algorithm is called NEA for New Encryption Algorithm.\n   The details were sketchy because now it is held as a trade secret\n   until the patent was issued, but I was told that it will incorporate\n   the following:\n\n    - It will have fast encryption of data (Exact specs not given, but\n      Mr. Melnick stated "Much faster than what an RS-232 can put out.")\n\n    - It is a symmetric cipher, just like IDEA and DES.\n\n    - It will use 64 bit data blocks for encryption (like DES and IDEA).\n\n    - The key length was not given to me, but Mr. Melnick states that\n      it is _adujustable_ and is "More than adequate for security."\n\n    - The algorithm is written in C and Assembler in software form, and\n      can be ported to many platforms (Unlike the the Clipper Chip which\n      is hardware ONLY and cannot be made into software) This I\n      consider a definite plus for the NEA for widespread use.\n\n    - The algorithm will accomodate public key distribution techniques\n      such as RSA or Diffie-Hellman. This will also be supported in the\n      hardware chip.\n\n    - Right now the projected cost of the NEA chip will be about 10 dollars\n      for each!! (Clipper will run 25 each chip [that is if it is produced\n      enough, which probably won't happen]).\n\n    - They currently sell a program called C-COM that uses the algorithm\n      and a special streaming protocol that does not divide the encrypted\n      data into "blocks." This could prevent plaintext attacks if you know\n      what the block header is. This program operates at all supported\n      RS-232 speeds and uses the software implementation of the algorithm.\n\n    - Most importantly: IT DOES NOT HAVE A BACKDOOR!!\n\n\n\nRight now the company is afraid that the new clipper chip will put them out\nof business. This is a very real possibility. So they really need help in\nstopping the clipper chip from becoming a standard. If you want to contact\nthem, they can be reached at..\n\nSecure Communications Technology\n8700 Georgia Ave. Suite 302\nSilver Spring, MD\n\n(301) 588-2200\n\nI talked to Mr. Bryen who represents the company. He can answer any\nquestions you have.\n\n\n\n\nAny factual errors occurring in this write up are my own and I apologize for\nthem ahead of time.
Misinterpretation, though it should be a crime in itself, is what\nUnited States lawyers use to make their bread and butter.\n\n  In Manchester, CT a few years ago, a small company wanted to run a\ngame system galled "LaserGames," similar in many aspects to Photon\n(tm). Three lawyers and about a hundred citizens found an ancient law\nin Manchester's books which clearly from context was designed to\nprohibit travelling carnivals by enumerating the features of a carnival\nwhich they felt at the time made the prohibition obvious. Among these\nthings was "shooting galleries," which is what the lawyers for the\nopposition to LaserGames wanted to harp upon. The judge took the two\nwords from this law, completely out of context, and ruled that\nLaserGames could not operate in Manchester.\n\n  Keep in mind that most travelling carnivals use projectile weapons in\ntheir shooting galleries, and not light beams. Clearly from context,\nLaserGames got shafted, but if the two words are applied, their denial\nof operating permission was justified.\n\n  If I had the text of the law I'd post it, but I'm afraid I don't\nremember it all well enough to even try. That little bit with the two\nwords stuck well, though.
Not at all. Two weeks ago I registered a concern about some programming\nthat was being conducted by a student organisation here at the\nUniversity of Texas at San Antonio.  As a result, I was interrogated\nby the capus police, who also attempted to create a positive-identification\nfile (photo, fingerprints, etc.). I refused to permit this, and filed a\ncomplaint with the University administration.  The Vice-President for\nBusiness Affairs (the 'boss' of the campus police) stated that he had no\ninterest in the legal/Constitutional implications of those actions.
Marc is not spoofing.  Try it yourself.  At least, the commands work\nexactly as he described (i.e. they do not work.)\n\n- Josh.
I have an idea as to why the encryption algorithm needs to be keep secret,\nand some things that i think it implies. (Of course these could all be\nwrong.....) \n\nfrom \n\n                     THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY\n                               Dorothy Denning\n                           Revised, April 21, 1993\n\n.\n.\n.\n\nThe Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block\nencryption algorithm called "Skipjack."  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys\n(compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling\n(compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of\noperation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic\nCodebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.\n\nEach chip includes the following components:\n\n   the Skipjack encryption algorithm\n   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips\n   N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)\n   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip\n\n.\n.\n.\n\nENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP\n\nTo see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T\ntelephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and\nwe both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure\nconversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K\nwith the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place\nwithout the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can\nbe used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.\n\nOnce the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to\nencrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The\ntelephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two\nvalues:\n\n   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and \n   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field , \n\nwhich are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement\nfield thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U\nconcatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family\nkey F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after\nan authorized wiretap has been installed.\n\n------------------\n\nsuppose i knew how the algorithm worked and knew the N for my chip, but\ndid not know F, then by cryptanalysis i might be able to determine F from\nif law enforcement field \n   E[E[K; U] + N; F]\nnot knowing N would might make this much harder.\n\nNow suppose that I know F, (either legitimately or not),\nIf I know K (either because I am involved in the conversation, or I know U\nfor a party in the conversation), I may now be able to determine U for the\nother party.\n\nIf I know F I can also defeat the law enforcement field, since I could\nmake my own, with a different K then the one I am using. Knowing F also\nallows traffic analysis to be performed. So I might not know what you are\nsaying but I could know who you are saying it too.\n\nNow I admit that someone trying to compute U will not have lots of\nmessages to work from, but since we have no way of knowing that the key\ngeneration method does not (deliberately?) generate weak keys, or for that\nmatter that the published method is in fact used, perhaps the U's will be\nchosen from know weak keys for the system.\n\nObviously the compromise of F would be a disaster, both to law enforcement\nfor whom this whole thing is designed, and for the people who believe that\nit is giving them security. F is but one number, and I sure that alot of\npeople (more then 1) know what it is (and if some "panel of experts" is\ngoing to check it over for flaws then many more will know F, forget\ngrinding chips, bribery and blackmail work just fine.\n\nSo, am I wrong? Or are these problems.
I hate to follow up to my own posting, but I should perhaps clarify\nsome things so I won't get flamed.\n\nFirst of all, when I'm talking about ``factoring the modulus'' or a\n``breakthrough in factoring'', what I really mean is a breakthrough in\nthe cryptanalysis of RSA.  I know that factoring and breaking RSA are\nnot proven to be equivalent; it's just so damn convenient not to\nrepeat this every time.\n\nI also have to admit that I don't really know if the ``non-group''\nproperty of a cipher is essential only for key chaining.  I have\nthought about it a little while, but I can't find a way that a\ncryptanalyst could exploit a group structure.  That, of course, means\nnothing at all.\n\nThen I wrote,\n\n\nWhat I meant was that as long as the only advantage of the\ncryptanalyst is a faster computer, then we will probably have RSA for\na long time to come, because even if 1024-bit moduli somehow could be\nbroken with fast computers (not with a new algorithm), then people\nwould simply use longer moduli.  Both users and cryptanalysts benefit\nfrom better technology in the same way.\n\nHope this keeps the flames away...  Have fun.
I don't think they're paying for it.\n\n\nUseful?  I find his estimate of the annual value to law enforcement\nof $5 million quite useful, if rough (e.g. wiretaps may be\npreferentially used on otherwise-hard-to-catch criminals, resulting\nin an underestimate).  This comes to twenty cents a head over the\nU.S. population.  I would find some rigorous numbers on this quite\nuseful -- it would make for nice slogans: "Your privacy is worth\n$0.37", or whatever it turns out to be.
Right on the heels of the Clinton "registered encryption key" debacle comes:\n\n\n\n\n\nWonder how much of that extra money goes into coming up with\nencryption schemes they can easily crack?
Unless there has been a _major_ change in the law, there's no such beast\nas a "classified patent."  Patents exist to encourage communications and\ndevelop the state of the art. \n\n(The 17-year lock is a nuisance, but historically has been pretty trivial.\nIt's only in an industry which doubles performance every three years (or\n18 months, for some hardware) that 17 years is an eternity).\n\nThe same thing applies in civilian development: you can't patent something \n_and_ declare it a "trade secret."  However, you can (and should) mark all\nsoftware (including proprietary code) "unpublished copyright" so that it\never does get exposed you still have some legal protection.\n\n(Post-Berne this isn't required, since everything is "born copyrighted."\nBut it takes a while for people to learn the new rules).
It means that the EFF's public stance is complicated with issues irrelevant\nto the encryption issue per se. There may well be people who care about\nthe encryption issue who don't care to associate themselves with the\nnetwork erotica issue (or may even disagree with the EFF's position).

The average amerikan today seems to think that the government should be\nable to eavesdrop on everyone (else).

I'd *desparately* prefer it if we didn't rehash the same arguments\nthat went on ad infinitum last time.  That's especially true for\nsci.crypt.  For that matter, I've created alt.privacy.clipper, since\nthe traffic is appearing in *many* different groups right now.\n\nI'm going to focus here on some technical aspects of the plan, hence my\nfollowup to sci.crypt.  Frankly, if you're not an absolutist, your\nfeelings may turn on some of these issues.  For example -- with an\n80-bit key, simply splitting it into two 40-bit pieces is much less\nacceptable than other schemes, because it means that if just one\nrepository is, shall we say, overly pliable, a would-be eavesdropper\nwould need to recover just 40 more bits of key.  I need not point out\nin this newsgroup that that's pretty easy to do by exhaustive search.\nA slightly more complex scheme -- XOR-ing the key with a random number,\nand then with its complement -- would produce two 80-bit subkeys,\nneither of which is useful alone.  That variant is much more resistant\nto attack.  Clearly, one can get even more sophisticated, to protect\nthe subkeys even more.\n\nOther thoughts...  Some people have noted the size and complexity of\nthe databases necessary.  But the id strings the phones emit could be\ntheir back door key, double-encrypted with the escrow repositories'\npublic keys.  For that matter, they could do that only with session\nkeys, and have no back door at all.  In that case, the FBI would have\nto bring every intercept to the repositories to be decrypted.  This\nwould answer many of the objections along the lines of ``how do you\nmake sure they stop''.\n\nWe can even combine that with a variant of the digital telephony back\ndoor -- have the switch do the tap, but with a digitally-signed record\nof the time, phone number, etc, of the call.  That provides proof to\nthe escrow agents that the tap was done in compliance with the terms of\nthe warrant.\n\nI can suggest other variations, too.  Suppose each Clipper chip had 100\npublic key pairs.  Each would be used ~10 times, after which you'd need\nmore keying material.  (Not a bad idea in any event.)  This could be\nused to enforce time limits, or rather, usage limits, on each warrant;\nthe keys the repository agents would deliver wouldn't last for very\nlong.\n\nI suspect that the cryptographic algorithm itself is secure.  Apart from\nthe obvious -- why push a weak algorithm when you've already got the\nback door? -- I think that the government is still genuinely concerned\nabout foreign espionage, especially aimed at commercial targets.  This\nscheme lets the spooks have their cake and eat it, too.  (I've heard\nrumors, over the years, that some factions within NSA were unhappy with\nDES because it was too good.  Not that they couldn't crack it, but it\nwas much too expensive to do so as easily as they'd want.)  They're keeping\nthe details secret so that others don't build their own implementations\nwithout the back door.

I'm quite astonished, shocked, and appalled at this serious frontal \nassault on emerging American freedoms.  The Clinton administration \nnor any other government agency has any legitimate role whatsoever \nin regulating cryptography. To do so is tantamount to regulating \n`acceptable' speech, and is blatantly unconstitutional. Perhaps we \nshould rename this year `1984' in honor of such an illustrious \nproposal.  Let the Crappy Chip live in infamy, and the adminstration\nreceive great shame and discredit for this bizarre misadventure.\n\nI am outraged that my tax money is being used to develop technology\nto restrict my freedoms far beyond reasonable measures.  The U.S.\ngovernment will have my full uncooperation and disobedience on any\nserious threat to my liberties such as this, and I call on everyone\nwith an interest in a sensible government to resist and defy this \nproposal.  The administration does not seem to understand that they\nare merely a subservient instrument to implement the will of the\npublic, and hence anyone involved in this proposal in this respect is \nwholly negligent and remiss in performing their lawful duty.\n\n\nIt seems to me that U.S. Diplomatic communications should be \ntappable by the U.N. whenever any countries produce a warrant to\nthe U.N.  In fact, I think we should stop paying the NSA billions\nof dollars a year to produce unbreakable codes for this reason.\nThese actions violate the sovereignity of international law. (I hope\nMr. Clinton is shrewd enough to recognize my sarcasm and satire here.\nBut if he isn't, it's a modest and reasonable proposal, so he should\nfind merit with it nevertheless.)\n\nCryptography is neutral technology. If everybody has strong \ncryptography (including policemen, bureacrats, businessmen, \nhousewives, thugs and hoodlums), we have a sustainable \nequilibrium.  Anything less is an unworkable anti-egaltarian \narrangement, intrinsically antithetical to American freedoms, and\nguaranteed to collapse under its own weight of inherent \nimpracticality. We don't need to compromise on issues of freedom.\n\n\nFor too long our government has demonstrated itself to be \nincreasingly hostile and a serious obstacle to economic vitality \nand protecting Americans.\n\n\nIt is not possible for the Federal Government\nto ``act quickly'' or develop ``consistent, comprehensive\npolicies'' PERIOD.  And even if by some grandiose miracle such\na thing were possible, it would only be an efficient way to\ndeprive American citizens of fundamental and inalienable rights.\n\nThe administration has to be committed to leaving private \nindustries alone, esp. on this issue.  The government has no \nlegitimate role in regulating the content of communications.\nLaw enforcement agencies must be prepared to forfeit their\nsurveillance bludgeon; they are soon and inevitably to be \ndisarmed of it. \n\n\nNo such laws can be constitutionally sound, and this is equivalent\nto a veiled threat, which I don't appreciate.  This kind of \nextortion tends to agitate me and others into radicalism. I will\ntrade threats for threats, and violation for violation.\n\n\nIf the administration did say this, it would find itself \nimpeached for reckless and outrageous disregard of essential,\nestablished, entrenched, and explicit constitutional privacy \nguarantees. The administration would have no legal standing \nwhatsoever; such an action would be egregiously illegal and\ncriminal, and wholly untolerated and disregarded by vast \nsegments of the population.\n\n\nThe U.S., comprised of a vast majority of people fanatically \ncommitted to preserving their privacy in the face of an \nincreasingly totalitarian government, is saying just that.  \nTake your chips and give them to NSA employees as Christmas bonuses.\nWe can run any algorithm on our computers we damn well please, \nand we will make any chips we please, and we will send any bit \npattern over our data highways we please. And if you try to stop \nus, you will be gradually or abruptly dissolved into nothingness.\n\n[privacy vs. law enforcement]\n\nThis is an outright Dingaling Denning lie.  The two aims of\nprivacy and surveillance are intrinsically and fundamentally \nincompatible, and you have to work for the NSA to think otherwise. \nAmericans are about to discover ways, through the use of technology, \nto preserve their inalienable but forgotten freedoms that have slowly \nbeen eroded away by an increasingly distant and unresponsive and \n*unrepresentative* government.\n\n--
My MDC cipher (which uses any one-way hash function as a CFB-mode stream\ncipher, the current implementation uses MD5) uses a key of up to 2048 bits\n(that is, you can use a 1-bit key if you want and copy it over the entire\n2048-bit range, or you can use the entire 2048 bits).  Runtime is\nindependant of key size, the system runs slightly slower than MD5 itself.\nI presume RC2 and RC4 use a similar system (or possibly they just hash an\narbitrary-length key down to n bits, maybe 128, using something like MD5).
Whew!  Take it easy on the guy.  Maybe he's going to do this in his\nspare time.  Maybe he's going to do this to see how much a wiretap\n*really* costs.  Maybe he's going to do this so he can add to the\nopposition to Clipper.  I don't know fully why he might do this, but\nmaybe we shouldn't start flaming at the drop of a hat.
David,\n\n  As an economist, I'm sure you can see the flaws in this logic. If the (naive)\nmarket is flooded with proprietary, but weak, encryption, then truly strong \nencryption will be unable to compete. Suppose the govt had a secret TV broadcast\nstandard, and then sold TVs below cost. Private industry has a better standard,\nbut it's not as widespread due to the govt early flooding of the market\nwith cheap proprietary sets. Even though the industry's technology is better,\nthe programming is being broadcast to the govt's unduplicatable standard.\nWho could compete?\n\n  The other flaw, of course, is that making something voluntary today ensures\nthat it will be voluntary in the future. I went to renew my CA drivers license\nlast week and was required not only to give my SSN, but to PRODUCE AN SSN\nCARD to veryify the number!  Note that a federal law once said that no state\nor local govt could ever require the use of SSNs for drivers license registration\n(specifically!).\n\n   I do not trust the govt that says "trust me on this even though we could\nhave an arrangement that doesn't require your trust."  Something is big\ntime fishy. If you look more carefully, you'll see it.\n\n  -mel
Imagine if this were available during the 1992 elections; instead of\nclumsily searching through the Clinton passport file, they could have \njust done a "voice-grep" (as someone stated earlier) on his telephone\nconversations for the last 10 years.\n\nI'm not a lawyer and I don't even play one on TV, but intuitively there's\nsomething wrong with having one's words archived for possible future\nuse against you.  This possibility frightens me more than any of the\ntalk about the Clipper Chip, right to cryptography, etc.\n\n\nI'm afraid it just might.\n\n-nhy\n\n--

As long as "you are on your own" means that you can use your own encryption,\nI'm sold.
I have a bunch of questions about the encryption scheme\nreferenced in the Subject of this message.  What is the relative data\nprivacy provided by the above sequence as compared with straight DES?\nDoes the addition of compression then encrypting make the cyphertext\nsignificantly harder to crack using current methods than straight DES?\nWould running crypt after DES provide greater data privacy?  Is it\nimportant to remove the (constant) compress header before encryption?\nThank you, net, for your wisdom.
A lot of us out here in the hinderland will trust the Japanese\nbefore we'll trust the NSA, the President, or those stupid\nFortune 50 companies you're so proud of.\n\n\n\nAnd since the Japanese corps aren't part of our "government/governors"\nthey may be more trusted out htere than you are.\n\n\nPeople are getting tired of this "be patriotic, do whatever we say\nwithout question, and pay more taxes" attitude that comes from\nAmerica's political party...\nor should that be caste?
It is incompetent, like almost anything you have posted here, so\nyou'll be flamed, sorry.\n\n\n%/$( your "20 years of background in two Fortune 50 companies"; I've\nlived 30 years under a totalitarian regime, and boy, I *can* recognize\na totalitarian plot when I see one...\n\n\nI am sure that -you- would be happy to use anything "they" tell you is\nsecure; we're talking about the intelligent people here... Or the\ncriminal ones, if you don't like the previous sentence... :-) Or those\nwho don't want their privacy to be guaranteed to be invadable by the\ngovernment - any current and future government, mind you...\n\n\nEven if you ignore the nonsense of the above statement for a moment,\nand even if you are happy with such system and the current escrow\nagencies NOW, what guarantees that you'll be happy with them TOMORROW,\nwhen the government changes? Or when the current government throws\naway the sheep skin? All the sheep who are reasoning like you will get\ncaught by surprise, but it will be too late, because then cryptography\nthat is not guaranteed to be breakable by the government will already\nhave been outlawed... After all, you've already got privacy that is\nsaid to be breakable only by the law enforcement agencies, so if you\nare law-abiding, you have no reasons to use a stronger one, right? So,\nif you are using a stronger one, you have something to hide from the\nlaw enforcement agencies, right? Something unlawful, right? Therefore,\nstrong crypto is a clear idndication that you are doing something\nunlawful.\n\n\nConsidering the level of competence in cryptology that you have\ndemonstrated in your messages, you would trust just anything... And\nno, this is not an ad hominem attack; it's an attack against the\ncontents of your messages <grin>.\n\n\nAnd how do you know that these experts are not corrupted? And how do\nyou know that they will not make a mistake? And how do you know that\nthe version of the algorithm they will be let to examine is the same\nas the one that will be really used?\n\nRegarding the mistake - even the few information "they" have let out\nhas revealed a serious security hole in the protocol - the 80-bit key\nis split in two 40-bit ones, thus the whole system is easily\nbreakable, if you have only one of the keys.\n\n\nThe Swiss or the Japanese are motivated by simple greed; NSA is\nmotivated by their wish to control the people. That's why the drug\ndealers have their accounts in Swiss banks, instead of in American\nones. For some reason, they do trust the Swiss banks more... Guess\nthey'll trust the Swiss encryption more too... I see IDEA becoming\nsuddenly popular... :-)\n\n\nIt's not surprising at all, but not because of the reason you give.\nIt's because it is obvious that the US government has put a lot of\nmoney behind this program and it will support it. Thus, most\ncorporations will try to get their piece from the pie by supporting it\ntoo. The same good old greed. Strong encryption is not widely\navailable now not because of some plot, but because the companies\ndon't see much money in it. It will be available even less, if the\ncompanies can see any penalties associated with it...\n\n\nYeah, just as I predicted, you are here again, to support the new\nsystem.\n\nRegards,\nVesselin
This doesn't handle superencrypted traffic. If the clipper\ndoesn't impose any unfortunate performance side-effects there's no\nreason not to use it to superencrypt a stream of triple-DES encrypted\ntraffic. That way your traffic looks "normal" and perhaps anyone\ndesiring to listen in won't even bother, since they know nobody's\ngoing to really trust crypto that has classified internals for\nimportant stuff.
er, excuse me but since the escrow agencies aren't yet chosen, how can you\nsay they have a "history of untrustworthy behavoir[sic]"?\n\nI'm sure each of us can think of agencies without such a history. Price\nWaterhouse has kept the secret of the Academy Awards for many years, even in\nthe face of an aggressive press. The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee\nhas successfully kept decisions from leaking for the statutory period until\npublication. Even the Department of Agriculture has successfully kept crop\nforecasts from leaking prematurely.\n\nFrankly, I'd trust the above (not the D of A, of course since they might be\nsubject to political pressure) far sooner than the ACLU, EFF, or CPSR which,\nthough not exactly government apologists, have no particular track record\nfor internal security that I know of.\n\nDavid
1. I don't think they are classified.\n\n2. I could independently invent about half a dozen right off\nthe top of my head. If I had studied Advanced E & M a little better,\nI could probably come up with a _very_ good system.\n\n...
Archive-name: cryptography-faq/part02\nLast-modified: 1993/4/15\n\n\nFAQ for sci.crypt, part 2: Net Etiquette\n\nThis is the second of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ. The parts are\nmostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.\nWe don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.\nNotes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.\n\nThe sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu \nas /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography \nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers \nevery 21 days.\n\n\nContents:\n\n* What groups are around? What's a FAQ? Who am I? Why am I here?\n* Do political discussions belong in sci.crypt?\n* How do I present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt?\n\n\n* What groups are around? What's a FAQ? Who am I? Why am I here?\n\n  Read news.announce.newusers and news.answers for a few weeks. Always\n  make sure to read a newsgroup for some time before you post to it.\n  You'll be amazed how often the same question can be asked in the same\n  newsgroup. After a month you'll have a much better sense of what the\n  readers want to see.\n\n* Do political discussions belong in sci.crypt?\n\n  No. In fact some newsgroups (notably misc.legal.computing) were\n  created exactly so that political questions like ``Should RSA be\n  patented?'' don't get in the way of technical discussions. Many\n  sci.crypt readers also read misc.legal.computing, comp.org.eff.talk,\n  comp.patents, sci.math, comp.compression, et al.; for the benefit of\n  people who don't care about those other topics, try to put your\n  postings in the right group.\n\n  Questions about microfilm and smuggling and other non-cryptographic\n  ``spy stuff'' don't belong in sci.crypt either.\n\n* How do I present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt?\n\n  ``I just came up with this neat method of encryption. Here's some\n  ciphertext: FHDSIJOYW^&%$*#@OGBUJHKFSYUIRE. Is it strong?'' Without a\n  doubt questions like this are the most annoying traffic on sci.crypt.\n\n  If you have come up with an encryption scheme, providing some\n  ciphertext from it is not adequate. Nobody has ever been impressed by\n  random gibberish. Any new algorithm should be secure even if the\n  opponent knows the full algorithm (including how any message key is\n  distributed) and only the private key is kept secret. There are some\n  systematic and unsystematic ways to take reasonably long ciphertexts\n  and decrypt them even without prior knowledge of the algorithm, but\n  this is a time-consuming and possibly fruitless exercise which most\n  sci.crypt readers won't bother with.\n\n  So what do you do if you have a new encryption scheme? First of all,\n  find out if it's really new. Look through this FAQ for references and\n  related methods. Familiarize yourself with the literature and the\n  introductory textbooks.\n\n  When you can appreciate how your cryptosystem fits into the world at\n  large, try to break it yourself! You shouldn't waste the time of tens\n  of thousands of readers asking a question which you could have easily\n  answered on your own.\n\n  If you really think your system is secure, and you want to get some\n  reassurance from experts, you might try posting full details of your\n  system, including working code and a solid theoretical explanation, to\n  sci.crypt. (Keep in mind that the export of cryptography is regulated\n  in some areas.)\n\n  If you're lucky an expert might take some interest in what you posted.\n  You can encourage this by offering cash rewards---for instance, noted\n  cryptographer Ralph Merkle is offering $1000 to anyone who can break\n  Snefru-4---but there are no guarantees. If you don't have enough\n  experience, then most likely any experts who look at your system will\n  be able to find a flaw. If this happens, it's your responsibility to\n  consider the flaw and learn from it, rather than just add one more\n  layer of complication and come back for another round.\n\n  A different way to get your cryptosystem reviewed is to have the NSA\n  look at it. A full discussion of this procedure is outside the scope\n  of this FAQ.
Stupid me. I believed the Democrats stood for principles of personal\nprivacy while it was the Neanderthal Republicans that wanted into every\naspect of our lives. \n\nClinton is just more clever than the other guy. Looks like gun control for\nprivacy technology. One small step at a time.\n\nWait a minute....  Let me think about this.\n\nHmmm, I feel better now. I believe the White House when they tell us\nthis first step is, in fact, the final step. All is OK. We've nothing to fear.\nThey're here to help us. \n\nGod bless America.\n-- \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJohn Hesse           |          A man,     \njhesse@netcom.com    |                 a plan, \nMoss Beach, Calif    |                         a canal, Bob.

The final stages of denial... I can hardly imagine what the result\nwould have been if the Clinton administration had actually supported\nthis plan, instead of merely acquiescing with repugnance as they've so\nobviously doing.  I don't believe the chip originated with the Clinton\nadministration either, but the Clinton administration has embraced it\nand brought it to fruition.\n\nBoth of the major parties have what they consider excellent reasons\nfor limiting your freedoms and violating your privacy, and even seem\nto feel that they're doing you a favor.  If this is really surprising\nto anyone it means they've been willfully ignoring quite a bit of\nprevious evidence.  There's only one political party (not calling\nanarchists a party) that considers your freedom and privacy goals\nworthy in and of themselves.  If you're voting for the big two, you're\nsupporting a reduction of those rights (given their goals and their\nhistories), regardless of whether you personally support that\nreduction.  To paint Clinton and Gore as unwitting tools is really\nstretching things.

I have a question that is a slight variation on the previously mentioned\nexamples that perhaps people could give me some pointers on (it has been a\ncouple of years since my Con Law class in college so I hope I am not\nmissing something obvious here...)\n\nBasic Scenario:\n\n	I set up a bbs that uses public-key encryption and encryption of\n	files on disk.  The general setup is designed so that when users \n	connect they send a private key encrypted using the system public\n	key and the user's public-private keypair is used to wrap the\n	one-time session keys used for encrypting the files on disk.  The\n	result of this is that even if I reveal the system private key it\n	is impossible for anyone to gain access to the files stored on the\n	machine.  What is possible is for someone to use the revealed\n	system private key to entice users into revealing thier personal\n	private keys during the authentication sequence.\n\nQuestions:\n\n	Does the fact that the system private key does not provide any\n	information useful for a search give me any protection as far as\n	being coerced to reveal the key?  (I doubt it myself..)\n\n	It seems providing the system private key does not mean that I am\n	assisting in "entrapment" (the users would send thier key anyway\n	and are not being enticed into doing something they would not\n	otherwise do) but is there any other hook that can be used?\n\n	Would the user private-key enticement require wiretap approval?\n\nAny answers or general musings on the subject would be appreciated...\n\njim
It depends on the algorithm used. 128-bit secret keys for RSA are\ndefinitively not secure enough.\n\nRegards,\nVesselin

HMMM... that brings up a neat idea.  \n\nUnfortunately, it's SOOO neat, I think I ought to patent it.\n\nSo I can't tell you about it.\n\nSorry.  :-)\n\n	-Bill\n\nCopyright 1993 William S. Yerazunis (aka Crah the Merciless)\nAll rights reserved, no responsibility taken.
Philip,\nI think your ideas are well taken and constructive.  Thanks for\narticulating them in this forum.\n\n\nAs a flaming libertarian paranoid extremist (:-), I'at a loss for\nspecific objections that don't sound frighteningly technical.  Any\nsuggestions?  Perhaps somebody could post a list of these?\n\n \nOne way to do this might be to suggest that these companies should be\nimplementing their own schemes, not being limited to the govt's\nscheme.\n\nI find that most of my reasons for opposition to the CLipper scheme\nare algoritm insecurity and mistrust of the govt/NSA.  These are hard \nto sell in letters to the editor and to nontechnical people.  Any\nhints or advice.  Maybe a small FAQ-type thing "Why should I Hate\nClipper" would be a good idea.
What???  This is an incredible statement!  The NSA tried to suppress\npublic key crypto and RSA, and yet they claim to encourage use of\nstrong crypto for US citizens.\n\nWould you trust a black-box from the NSA versus an "open system" from\nelsewhere?\n\n/-----------------------------------\\n\-----------------------------------/
...\n\nI seriously doubt that any practical implementation of this proposal would\nplace the onus on the individual to register keys.  Realistically, the\nClipper-Chip will probably emit an ID code which will serve as the identifier\nwhen requesting the key fragments.  The chip manufacturer would register\nthis identifier code vs. key combination when the chip is made and the\n(uninitiated) end-user can therefore remain completely outside the loop.\nThe chip could be used in a cellular phone, a modem, or other device --\nit really makes no difference:  When the authorities detect the use of this\nencryption standard during surveillance, they would then capture the ID\nand apply for the key in order to decrypt the data.
Ok, so there are in fact two distinct components transmitted by the\nchip; the real message encrypted with the "conventional" key, and the\nserial number and encrypted "conventional" key encrypted with the\n(IMHO kind of bogus, as the whole concept of "one key that millions of\npeople use which can't be changed" doesn't seem reasonable) "family\nkey".\n\nSuppose I analyze the output of this chip and I'm able to determine\nwhich bits are the encrypted packet which contains the serial number\nand session key.  Suppose I also design a simple algorithm based on\nthis information which takes the data containing the encrypted session\nkey and twiddles a bit (or several) before it's sent down the line.\n\nMind you, I'm sure the NSA thought of this along with a dozen other\nattacks I can't imagine, and the system is probably somehow designed\nso that manipulation of this information will cause a compliant\nreceiving chip to somehow fail to decrypt successfully.  But how?\nWhat if the two parties agree in advance on some kind of consistent\nbit-twiddling scheme, so the decryption chip sees the restored\n"proper" bitstream but an eavesdropper gets a E[K; UK] packet that's\nwrong?\n\nI suppose this could be easily defeated if the chip "sends" that\ninformation out many times in slightly different ways, making it\neffectively impossible to be certain you know all the information\nbeing sent.
I know that at least one person on that list says the first he heard\n   of Clipper was in the Friday morning newspaper! And another has\n   already fired off a letter of protest to NIST.\n\n   My point? I suspect this list, interesting as it is for various\n   reasons, does not represent the cabal that put this proposal together.\n   Some of them, yes. Others, no. \n\nI received mail from Mitch Kapor saying that he did not ask to be on\nthe list, and does not know why he was added.  I'm sure the same\napplies to others on the list.  So, I guess my initial theory was\nright, that the clipper list was just someone's idea of a bad joke.  I\nguess I should be happy it wasn't a conspiracy.\n\n		Marc
Being a browser of this group for some time,\n  and being very concerned about the clipper chip proposal,\n    I am hoping someone with more knowledge can help out.\n\nWho would be the most influential people to write to, protesting \nthe obvious next step hinted at by this proposal ?\n (Heads of what committees, etc.)\n\nWhat are the major flaws in the plan ?\n (From a cryptological standpoint)
I don't doubt that this will be the attitude of many corporate leaders.\nIt's understandable--most corporate execs don't know much about cryptology,\nand it's easy to get taken in by someone peddling snake oil.  And, the\nproposed scheme *is* a major improvement in telephone security to what\nexists now.\n \n   The problem is that, with any security scheme of this kind, you have to\nconcern yourself with the weakest link in the chain.  I suspect that NSA\nhas put a fairly strong encryption algorithm in this wiretap chip of theirs,\nprobably at least as strong as (say) DES in OFB-mode.  Unfortunately, the\nexistence of the key-registry system seems to make possible all kinds of\npossible attacks at a small fraction of the expense of trying to build (say)\na DES keysearch machine.\n \n   As originally described, it sounded like any police / court combination\ncould acquire the key for a given chip.  I hope that's not the case, since\nit would imply a glaring hole.  (How much does it cost to find *one* crooked\njodge and *one* crooked cop?  Especially for a foreign intelligence agency\nor organized crime boss?)  However, even if more intelligent schemes are used\nto allow access to the unencrypted phone conversations, there will be weak-\nnesses.  They may be very expensive, and very difficult.  But who would\ntrust his/her confidential information to an encryption scheme that, for\n(say) $100,000 could by cracked one time in a hundred?  (DES, for all the\ncomplaints about a 56-bit key, would probably cost several million dollars\nto build a keysearch machine for.)\n \n   How many million dollars would the confidential phone messages of\nthe GM headquarters be worth to Nissan, Chrysler, or Audi?  How about\nhome phones of major execs and important engineers and designers?\n"Gee, Mr Jones, I understand you've had some financial problems lately.\nMaybe I can help..."\n \n \n   Indeed, if NSA really designed the algorithm to be secure, it's very likely\nas secure as IDEA or 2-key DES.  However, the system as a whole isn't resistant\nto "practical cryptanalysis."  In _The Puzzle Palace_, Bamford describes how\nseveral NSA employees were turned by foreign (presumably KGB) agents, despite\nsecurity measures that I doubt any Big 8 accounting firm could match.  And\nNSA confidential data was *not* subject to being requested by thousands of\npolice organizations and courts across the land.

(A ``block\n  cipher'' just means a cipher that encrypts a block of data---8 bytes,\n  say---all at once, then goes on to the next block.) The notion of\n  product ciphers is due to Shannon [SHA49]. Examples of modern\n  product ciphers include LUCIFER [SOR84], DES [NBS77], SP-networks\n  [KAM78], LOKI [BRO90], FEAL [SHI84], PES [LAI90], Khufu and Khafre\n  [ME91a]. The so-called Feistel ciphers are a class of product\n  ciphers which operate on one half of the ciphertext at each round,\n  and then swap the ciphertext halves after each round. LUCIFER,\n  DES, LOKI, and FEAL are examples of Feistel ciphers.\n\n  The following table compares the main parameters of several product \n  ciphers:\n\n  cipher   |   block length   |   key bits   |   number of rounds\n  LUCIFER          128               128                16\n  DES               64                56                16\n  LOKI              64                64                16\n  FEAL              64               128            2^x, x >= 5\n  PES               64               128                 8\n\n* What makes a product cipher secure?\n\n  Nobody knows how to prove mathematically that a product cipher is\n  completely secure. So in practice one begins by demonstrating that the\n  cipher ``looks highly random''. For example, the cipher must be\n  nonlinear, and it must produce ciphertext which functionally depends\n  on every bit of the plaintext and the key. Meyer [MEY78] has shown\n  that at least 5 rounds of DES are required to guarantee such a\n  dependence. In this sense a product cipher should act as a ``mixing''\n  function which combines the plaintext, key, and ciphertext in a\n  complex nonlinear fashion.\n\n  The fixed per-round substitutions of the product cipher are\n  referred to as S-boxes. For example, LUCIFER has 2 S-boxes, and DES\n  has 8 S-boxes. The nonlinearity of a product cipher reduces to a\n  careful design of these S-boxes. A list of partial design criteria\n  for the S-boxes of DES, which apply to S-boxes in general, may be\n  found in Brown [BRO89] and Brickell et al. [BRI86].\n\n* What are some group-theoretic properties of product ciphers?\n\n  Let E be a product cipher that maps N-bit blocks to N-bit blocks.\n  Let E_K(X) be the encryption of X under key K. Then, for any fixed K,\n  the map sending X to E_K(X) is a permutation of the set of N-bit\n  blocks. Denote this permutation by P_K. The set of all N-bit\n  permutations is called the symmetric group and is written S_{2^N}.\n  The collection of all these permutations P_K, where K ranges over all\n  possible keys, is denoted E(S_{2^N}). If E were a random mapping from\n  plaintexts to ciphertexts then we would expect E(S_{2^N}) to generate\n  a large subset of S_{2^N}.\n\n  Coppersmith and Grossman [COP74] have shown that a very simple\n  product cipher can generate the alternating group A_{2^N} given a\n  sufficient number of rounds. (The alternating group is half of the\n  symmetric group: it consists of all ``even'' permutations, i.e., all\n  permutations which can be written as an even number of swaps.)\n  Even and Goldreich [EVE83] were able to extend these results to show\n  that Feistel ciphers can generate A_{2^N}, given a sufficient number\n  of rounds.\n\n  The security of multiple encipherment also depends on the\n  group-theoretic properties of a cipher. Multiple encipherment is an\n  extension over single encipherment if for keys K1, K2 there does\n  not exist a third key K3 such that\n\n  E_K2(E_K1(X)) == E_(K3)(X)                (**)\n\n  which indicates that encrypting twice with two independent keys\n  K1, K2 is equal to a single encryption under the third key K3.  If\n  for every K1, K2 there exists a K3 such that eq. (**) is true then\n  we say that E is a group.\n\n  This question of whether DES is a group under this definition was\n  extensively studied by Sherman, Kaliski, and Rivest [SHE88]. In their\n  paper they give strong evidence for the hypothesis that DES is not a\n  group. In fact DES is not a group [CAM93].\n\n* What can be proven about the security of a product cipher?\n\n  Recall from above that P_K is a permutation produced by E under\n  some key K. The goal of the designer of E is to ensure that P_K\n  appears to be a random element of S_{2^N}, the symmetric group.\n  Let R be an element of S_{2^N} selected randomly. We will say that P_K\n  and R are indistinguishable if an observer given P_K and R in some\n  order cannot distinguish between these two permutations in polynomial\n  time. That is, with time bounded resources, the observer cannot\n  determine which of the permutations is produced by E: the optimal\n  decision is no better than simply guessing.\n\n  Luby and Rackoff [LUB88] have shown that a class of Feistel ciphers\n  are secure in this sense when the round mapping is replaced by\n  random boolean functions.\n\n* How are block ciphers used to encrypt data longer than the block size?\n\n  There are four standard "modes of operation" (and numerous non-standard\n  ones as well).  The standard modes of operation are defined in the U.S.\n  Department of Commerce Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 81,\n  published in 1980.  See the question about "ECB" below for more details.\n\n  Although they are defined for the DES block cipher, the "modes of\n  operation" can be used with any block cipher.\n\n* Can symmetric block ciphers be used for message authentication?\n\n  One may use a symmetric cryptosystem block cipher to prove to himself\n  that he did or did not generate a message, and to prove to himself \n  whether his message was altered or unaltered since generation.  But one\n  cannot prove these things to another without revealing the key, and \n  thereafter that key cannot be used to prove anything about any messages\n  that were authenticated using that key.\n  \n  See ANSI X3.106-1983 and FIPS 113 (1985) for a standard method of message\n  authentication using DES.\n\n* What exactly is DES?\n\n  DES is the U.S. Government's Data Encryption Standard - a product \n  cipher that operates on 64-bit blocks of data, using a 56-bit key.  \n\n  It is defined in FIPS 46-1 (1988) [which supersedes FIPS 46 (1977)].\n  FIPS are Federal Information Processing Standards published by NTIS.\n  DES is identical to the ANSI standard Data Encryption Algorithm (DEA)\n  defined in ANSI X3.92-1981. \n\n* What is triple DES?\n\n  Triple DES is a product cipher which, like DES, operates on 64-bit \n  data blocks.  There are several forms, each of which uses the DES\n  cipher 3 times.  Some forms use two 56-bit keys, some use three.\n  The "DES modes of operation" may also be used with triple-DES.\n\n  Some people refer to E(K1,D(K2,E(K1,x))) as triple-DES.\n\n  This method is defined in chapter 7.2 of the ANSI standard X9.17-1985\n  "Financial Institution Key Management" and is intended for use in\n  encrypting DES keys and IVs for "Automated Key Distribution".  Its\n  formal name is "Encryption and Decryption of a Single Key by a Key\n  Pair", but it is referenced in other standards documents as EDE.\n\n  That standard says (section 7.2.1): "Key encrypting keys may be a single\n  DEA key or a DEA key pair.  Key pairs shoud be used where additional\n  security is needed (e.g., the data protected by the key(s) has a long\n  security life).  A key pair shall not be encrypted or decrypted using a\n  single key."\n\n  Others use the term "triple-DES" for E(K1,D(K2,E(K3,x))) or\n  E(K1,E(K2,E(K3,x))).\n\n  One of us (Carl Ellison) keeps advocating DES triple use in the form\n  E(K1, TRAN( E(K2, TRAN( E(K3, COMPRESS( x )))))), where each DES instance\n  has its own key and IV (for CBC mode) and TRAN has been posted on\n  sci.crypt.  (It is a large-block transposition program taking its key\n  from the data stream itself, so that it is not an encryption program on\n  its own part.)\n\n* What is differential cryptanalysis?\n\n  Differential cryptanalysis is a statistical attack that can be\n  applied to any iterated mapping (ie. any mapping which is based on\n  a repeated round function). The method was recently popularized by\n  Biham and Shamir [BIH91], but Coppersmith has remarked that the\n  S-boxes of DES were optimized against this attack some 20 years ago.\n  This method has proved effective against several product ciphers,\n  notably FEAL [BI91a].\n\n  Differential cryptanalysis is based on observing a large number of\n  ciphertexts Y, Y' whose corresponding plaintexts X, X' satisfy a\n  known difference D = X+X', where + is componentwise XOR. In the\n  basic Biham-Shamir attack, 2^{47} such plaintext pairs are required\n  to determine the key for DES. Substantially fewer pairs are required\n  if DES is truncated to 6 or 8 rounds. In these cases, the actual key\n  can be recovered in a matter of minutes using a few thousand pairs.\n  For full DES this attack is impractical because it requires so many\n  known plaintexts.\n\n  The work of Biham and Shamir on DES revealed several startling\n  observations on the algorithm. Most importantly, if the key\n  schedule was removed from DES and a 16*48 = 768-bit key was used,\n  the key could be recovered in less than 2^{64} steps. Thus\n  independent subkeys do not add substantial security to DES.\n  Further, the S-boxes of DES are extremely sensitive in that\n  changing even single entries in these tables yields significant\n  improvement in the differential attack.\n\n  Adi Shamir is quoted to say (NYTimes Oct 13 1991), ``I would say\n  that, contrary to what some people believe, there is no evidence\n  of tampering with the DES so that the basic design was weakened.''\n\n* How was NSA involved in the design of DES?\n\n  According to Kinnucan [KIN78], Tuchman, a member of the group that\n  developed DES at IBM is quoted as saying, ``We developed the DES\n  algorithm entirely within IBM using IBMers. The NSA did not\n  dictate a single wire!'' Tuchman and Meyer (another developer of\n  DES) spent a year breaking ciphers and finding weaknesses in\n  Lucifer. They then spent two years strengthening Lucifer. ``Their\n  basic approach was to look for strong substitution, permutation,\n  and key scheduling functions ... IBM has classified the notes\n  containing the selection criteria at the request of the NSA....\n  `The NSA told us we had inadvertently reinvented some of the deep\n  secrets it uses to make its own algorithms,' explains Tuchman.''\n  \n  On the other hand, a document called ``Involvement of the NSA in\n  the development of DES: unclassified summary of the United States\n  Select Committee on Intelligence'', printed in the IEEE\n  Communications Magazine, p53-55, 1978, states: ``In the development\n  of DES, NSA convinced IBM that a reduced keysize was sufficient;\n  indirectly assisted in the development of the S-box structures; and\n  certified that the final DES algorithm was, to the best of their\n  knowledge, free from any statistical or mathematical weakness.''\n\n  Clearly the key size was reduced at the insistence of the NSA.\n  The article further states that the NSA did not tamper with the\n  algorithm itself, just the parameters, which in some sense\n  resolves the apparent conflict in the remarks of Meyer and Tuchman\n  presented above.\n\n* Is DES available in software?\n\n  Several people have made DES code available via ftp (see part 10 for\n  pathnames): Stig Ostholm [FTPSO]; BSD [FTPBK]; Eric Young [FTPEY];\n  Dennis Furguson [FTPDF]; Mark Riordan [FTPMR]; Phil Karn [FTPPK].\n  A Pascal listing of DES is also given in Patterson [PAT87].\n\n  FIPS 46-1 says "The algorithm specified in this standard is to be\n  implemented ... using hardware (not software) technology.  ...\n  Software implementations in general purpose computers are not in\n  compliance with this standard."  Despite this, software\n  implementations abound, and are used by government agencies.\n\n* Is DES available in hardware?\n\n  The following paragraphs are quoted from messages sent to the editors.\n  We don't vouch for the quality or even existence of the products.\n\n  encryption/decryption device for use on standard, digital 64Kbps PCM\n  telecom data streams.

This is a very curious thing to say. STU-IIIs (NSA-designed secure\ntelephones cleared for classified traffic) are already readily\navailable to law enforcement agencies. Word has it they're standard in\nevery FBI office, for example.  Something like several hundred\nthousand of these phones exist in all. They are clearly the US government\nstandard.\n\nSo why does the DoJ need to buy new phones that, unlike STU-IIIs, will\nnot be certified for classified traffic, and in all likelihood will\nnot be compatible with existing STU-IIIs?\n\nUnless, of course, they're gearing up for large scale decryption of\ncivilian Clipper users, and they need compatible hardware...
Getting rid of the keys is actually pretty easy to do automatically on\na communications link, as opposed to storage where the keys have to be\nretained somehow as long as the owner wants to be able to retrieve the\ndata.\n\nThe right way to do communications security is to generate a random\nsession key with Diffie Hellman, use it for a while and then destroy\nit. Once it's gone, there's no getting it back, and no way to decrypt\nrecordings of the conversation.\n\nTo make sure you aren't being attacked by a man in the middle, you\nhave to authenticate your DH exchanges. The AT&T secure phone does\nthis by displaying the DH key so you can compare them verbally over\nthe phone. This is nice and simple, but it relies on user awareness\nplus the inability of the man in the middle to duplicate the users'\nvoices.\n\nA better way is to authenticate the exchanges with RSA. Since you'd\nnever use RSA for actual encryption, compromising your RSA secret key\nwould only allow someone to impersonate you in a future conversation,\nand even that only until you revoke your public key.  They would still\nnot be able to decrypt recordings of prior conversations for which the\nsession keys have been destroyed.\n\nI'm convinced that this is how the government's own secure phones\n(the STU-III) must work. Neat, eh?
My choice for the escow house would be the Smithsonian, and someplace on\nthe west coast.  My biggest concern isn't that the escrow house could\nbe compromised (it will be), but the fact it has been compromised will\nbe kept secret.  \n\nThe keys could be kept under glass, with 24-hour C-SPAN coverage.  If you\nthought your key had been stolen just turn on the cable, and wait until\nthe roving camera reachs the musuem case with your key.  Or if you think the\nC-SPAN satellite has been compromised, take a tour of the Smithsonian\nyourself, and view the seal on your key.

Rather than use technology to accommodate\n   the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\n   law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\n   industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\n\n   Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\n   protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\n   protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\n   technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\n   unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\n   by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\n\n   A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the "Clipper Chip" has\n   been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\n   new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\n   relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\n   an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\n   using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\n   commercial use today.\n\n   This new technology will help companies protect proprietary\n   information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\n   and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\n   electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\n   ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\n   intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \n\n   A "key-escrow" system will be established to ensure that the\n   "Clipper Chip" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\n   Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique\n\n\n				   2\n\n\n   "keys," numbers that will be needed by authorized government\n   agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\n   device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\n   in two "key-escrow" data bases that will be established by the\n   Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\n   government officials with legal authorization to conduct a\n   wiretap.\n\n   The "Clipper Chip" technology provides law enforcement with no\n   new authorities to access the content of the private\n   conversations of Americans.\n\n   To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\n   Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\n   devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\n   government will be offered access to the confidential details of\n   the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\n   their findings.\n\n   The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\n   encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\n   privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\n   criminals and terrorists.  We need the "Clipper Chip" and other\n   approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\n   to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\n   to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\n   trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\n   the President has directed government agencies to develop a\n   comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\n\n	--   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\n	     employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\n\n	--   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\n	     calls and data, under proper court or other legal\n	     order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\n\n	--   the effective and timely use of the most modern\n	     technology to build the National Information\n	     Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\n	     the competitiveness of American industry in the global\n	     marketplace; and \n\n	--   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\n	     high technology products.\n\n   The President has directed early and frequent consultations with\n   affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\n   privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\n\n\n\n				   3\n\n   The Administration is committed to working with the private\n   sector to spur the development of a National Information\n   Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\n   technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\n   information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\n   ("information superhighways") will transmit video, images, HDTV\n   programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone\n   system transmits voice.\n\n   Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important\n   role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\n   quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\n   its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\n   protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting\n   them from those who break the law.\n\n   Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \n   The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new\n   encryption technology are also available.  \n\n   For additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\n   Standards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\n\n   ---------------------------------\n\n\n   QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S\n   TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\n\n\n\n\n   Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\n	agencies to listen in on phone conversations?\n\n   A:   No.  "Clipper Chip" technology provides law enforcement with\n	no new authorities to access the content of the private\n	conversations of Americans.\n\n   Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\n	a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\n	encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\n	decipher the message?\n\n   A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\n	court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\n	would then present documentation of this authorization to\n	the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\n	obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\n	smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\n	stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\n	escrow system.\n\n   Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\n\n   A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\n	entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\n	Administration have yet to determine which agencies will\n	oversee the key-escrow data banks.\n\n   Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\n	how strong the security is?  \n\n   A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\n	systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\n	remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\n	system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of\n	cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\n	potential users that there are no unrecognized\n	vulnerabilities.\n\n   Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\n\n   A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\n	Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\n	this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\n	President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\n	officials.\n\n   Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\n\n   A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\n	encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\n	as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\n	briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\n	decisions related to this initiative.\n\n   Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\n\n   A:   The government designed and developed the key access\n	encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\n	microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\n	manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\n	manufacturer that produces them.\n\n   Q:   Who provides the "Clipper Chip"?\n\n   A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\n	California, and will sell the chip to encryption device\n	manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\n	to other vendors in the future.\n\n   Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \n\n   A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\n	the "Clipper Chip" into their devices.\n\n   Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\n	solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\n	willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\n	powerful encryption devices?\n\n   A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\n	considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\n	mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\n	that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\n	than others readily available today, but it is just one\n	piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\n	encryption technology, which the Administration is\n	developing.\n\n	The Administration is not saying, "since encryption\n	threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\n	we will prohibit it outright" (as some countries have\n	effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that "every\n	American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\n	unbreakable commercial encryption product."  There is a\n	false "tension" created in the assessment that this issue is\n	an "either-or" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\n	and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\n	balanced approach such as is proposed with the "Clipper\n	Chip" and similar encryption techniques.\n\n   Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\n	Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from\n	that of the Bush Administration?  \n\n   A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\n	technology in telecommunications and computing and are\n	committed to working with industry and public-interest\n	groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'\n	privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\n	enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\n	and terrorism.\n\n   Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\n	the government hardware?
Just a question. \n      As a provider of a public BBS service - aren't you bound by law to gurantee\n      intelligble access to the data of the users on the BBS, if police comes\n      with sufficent authorisation ? I guessed this would be  a basic condition\n      for such systems. (I did run a bbs some time ago, but that was in Switzerland)\n\nThe US doesn't yet have many laws covering BBSs - they're not common carriers,\nthey're not phone companies, they're just private machines or services\noperated by businesses.  There's no obligation to keep records.\nAs Perry Metzger points out, if the police come with a search warrant,\nyou have to let them see what the warrant demands, if it exists,\nand they generally can confiscate the equipment as "evidence"\n(which is not Constitutionally valid, but we're only beginning to\ndevelop court cases supporting us).  A court MAY be able to compel\nyou to tell them information you know, such as the encryption password\nfor the disk - there aren't any definitive cases yet, since it's a new\nsituation, and there probably aren't laws specifically covering it.\nBut the court can't force you to *know* the keys, and there are no\nlaws preventing you from allowing your users to have their own keys\nfor their own files without giving them to you.\n\nEven in areas that do have established law, there is uncertainty.\nThere was a guy in Idaho a few years ago who had his business records\nsubpoenaed as evidence for taxes or some other business-restriction law,\nso he gave the court the records.  Which were in Hebrew.\nThe US doesn't have laws forcing you to keep your records in English,\nand these were the originals of the records.  HE didn't speak Hebrew,\nand neither did anybody in the court organization.  Don't think they\nwere able to do much about it.\n\nIt might be illegal for your BBS to deny access to potential customers\nbased on race, religion, national origin, gender, or sexual preference;\nit probably hasn't been tested in court, but it seems like a plausible\nextension of anti-discrimination laws affecting other businesses.
The people on usenet are clearly a special bunch.  We live the net, which\nis the future of our culture.  Usenetters have rapid electronic access to\ninformation.  Society in general must depend on CNN.  \n\nI can only hope we can make this information accessable by the public before\nthe radical fringe, which _is_ the majority, destroys the fabric of\nthis country.  Freedom is never easily won.
I'd lay long odds that it was the other way around.  Clinton didn't\njust pull this plan out of any bodily orifices; the NSA has to have\nbeen working on it for years.  While it's possible that Denning (and\nother prominent people) just happened to start arguing for such a\nsystem, it seems more likely that there was a suggestion involved.\nIf this guess is wrong, I apologize.
IMHO, encryption is (also) protected under the SECOND amendment of\nthe Constitution of the United States.\n\n\n\nI am not surprised that this administration is doing this.\nI could have told you so.\n\n\n\nPrivacy has ALWAYS been something that has the effect of restricting\nout ability to prosecute criminals.  We are supposed to have the\npresumption of innocence.\n\nI have the right to pull the curtains over my windows and close my\ndoor, and the police may not come in.  If I perform a crim in my home,\nthey will have to find out by means other than simply looking.\n\nEncryption is to my data as the window curtains are to my home.\nSimple enough?\n\n\n\nAnd yet the people vote for these people because they come out a lie\nto them about promising to fix things.\n\n\n\nYou mean they might have to go back to actually WORKING to do their job?\nOh heavens.\n\n\n\nPerhaps the FIRST amendment.  Definitely the SECOND and FIFTH.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, the vast segments of the population are misinformed.\nThey just haven't appended -SR to the name of out country, yet.\n\n\n\nI seriously doubt that the NSA thinks that privacy and surveillance are\ncompatible.  I doubt of any smart person in any other agency thinks\nso, either.  The PROBLEM is that they simply hold PRIVACY to be of no\nvalue at all.
Actually the govrnment is telling you that if you want to use their\n"product" the manufacturer (actually better yet, some "trusted" pair\nof escrow agencies) has to have the key.\n\nMost of us already are in this situation--our car makers have keys to our\ncars (or can get them quickly from the VIN  number), and I have no doubt\nthat if presented with a court order, they'd surrender copies to the\ngovernment.\n\nChances are that many locksmiths have the code numbers for house locks\nthey've installed, and in an emergency can cut keys; thus they'd also\nprovide such keys to the government pursuant to a court order.\n\nThe state has no difficulty gaining access to your safe deposit box if they\nhave a court order.\n\nBad analogy.\n\nThis is not to argue for or against the proposal, but rather better\ndistinctions are required in thinking about it than "house key, safe-deposit\nkeys, etc.".\n\nDavid
Hmm, followup on my own posting... Well, who cares.\n\nFirst let me try to work out the facts that we get to know about the\nClipper-Chip, from what Hellman and Denning were able to tell us:\n\nThe chip itself is not confined to (digital) telephony, but performs\ngeneral encryption in a symmetric manner.  The chip supports CFB OFB\nECB (and whatever the fourth mode of operation for DES is), the algorithm\nconsists of 32 rounds of *whatever*, and takes 80-Bit keys. Input data\nseems to be 64 Bit? Yes.\nSo if two people want secure communication (whatever that means when \nClipper is involved) they have first to agree on ONE secret key. \n(Or is it one key per direction ?)\nThey can exchange this key via DH-schemes or however.\nSomehow the two feed their so won secret key into the Clipper-chip\nwhich is now ready to work.\nThe clipper chip carries an unique Serial-Number (30 Bit's), and 160 Key-Bits.\nThese 160 key-bits seem to have been gained by encrypting the serial-number\nwith 160 seed-bits. (The seed-bits seem not to be stored in the chip)\nAt beginning of communication (and perhaps at certain invtervals whithin??)\nbefore sending the fist real 64-bit output of the first encryption the Clipper\nchip put's out packets (I guess 3) which represent the serial number,\nand the session key. This might look like\nX{ E[K; chipkeyK1+K2], serial number}\nwhere X is a transformation of these 3? Packets involving a family-key.\nThis family(sp?)-key is equal for ALL chips. (X might be a simple XOR ???)\nAfter that, the (digital?) phone-call can be done as usual, every packet\nbeing encrypted and decrypted by Clipper.\n\nDenning describes how K1 and K2 shall be generated, using a seed of 160\nBit's.\n\nNow, leaving alone politics, which does not concern me as much as you, not\nbeing an American Citicien(tm) [ :-) ] , there are some weak points in this\nscheme, which might be exploited by several parties.\n\nAs far as I know about the generation of K1,K2 ; S1 and S2 look like the \nobvious backdoor. They could be used to generate the chip-keys by knowing\nthe serial-number (and also the family-key) of the chip. I really can't\nimagine why these seeds would be needed otherwise, as true random-sources\nfor the generation of the K1,K2 can be bought for not to much money.\n\nThen, the escrows. Each of them will get 80 bit of a 160-Bit key. Security\ncould (as little as existant) be maximized by giving them 160-bits\neach, which have to be xored together to give the K1,K2. Now let's simply\nassume the escrows are trustworthy, and can't be fooled by criminals or\nlaw enforchemnt agencies. (And there will be no quarrel between escrows\nand l.e.a which would hinder the l.e.a in doing their duties, and so on\nand so on) Once the keys are surrendered, the corresponding\nchip is compromised forever. Not very clever, IMHO [ :-)) ].\nHow about sending in the encrypted session-keys for each phone-call that\nthe police (or whoever) want's to listen to? Escrows could then simply decode\nthis session-key and send it back to police. (And would naturally not do this\nafter the warrant has expired...) This would be a better technical solution,\nbut I guess politics will not work that way.\n\nApparently (as Miss Dennings stated) the only one performing actually decodes\nof intercepted messages shall be the FBI. Great. So local guys can not inter-\ncept (understand) your traffic anymore. Does this mean that the FBI monopolizes\nthe right to do legal wiretaps ? (How is law over there, I have no idea who\nis allowed to tap, and who not) This certainly means that watched communi-\ncations will be routed automatically from the service-providing company\nto the FBI, if the communicaiton is a watched one. And this means as far\nas I understand it that the family-key has to be known by each switching-\ncompany, and those providing cellular-phone servies etcetc. So the family-key\nwill not be very secret, and thus serial-numbers of calls will be readable\nby anybody who cares. I _like_ traffic-analysis!\n\nWhat do you guess, what happens, if you use the chip in ECB mode, and the\nfirst few packets of the chip are somehow lost or garbled? So the session\nkey would not be actually broadcasted over the line? Hmmm. Shouldn't be so\ndifficult to do *that* :^)\n\nAnd now a last point, for the other side. After all I have read and heard about\nClipper (not the programming language for dBase, is it ? [:-)]) it seems\nto have many advantages, which shold not be overseen!\n\n\nNow an afterthought to your rights. Please note that I have no idea what I am\ntalking about!!!\n\nFrom: grady@netcom.com (1016/2EF221)\n\nIf this text is actually in your Bill of Rights, who can overrule this ?\nBut: 'Freedom of speech' is not 'Secrecy of speech'\n\nMaybe you need to extend your Amendment #4  to cover information and\ncommunication too ?\n\nI am not very sure in what position your government actually is *legally*\nwhen it tries to ban cryptography (and arms) Amendment say you may have them,\nbut not under what conditions. Hmm, tricky situation :-(\n\nActually it will make not much sense to discuss that topic in sci.crypt...\nDiscussion of technical details and vulnerabilites of the system are highly\nsuggested and appreciated :-)\n\nFriendly greetings,\n\n	Germano Caronni\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: Everything in here is derived from things I heard and read from\nother persons, so everything could be wrong.

Perhaps one way of getting away from this cripple chip that the U.S.\ngovernment seems to be pushing would be to come up with a good alternative.\nFor example, how about a scheme using RSA, and some hybrid of DES-CFB and\nanother strong stream cipher (Maybe IDEA-CFB)?  This could be substantially\nthe same as the cripple chip, except that instead of key-registration, the\npolice could demand that you give up your secret key to them (with a court-\nissued warrant).  Then, they could read the last few months of wiretapped\nmessages you've sent, and assuming you've committed no crimes, you could\ngenerate a new key pair and go about your business.  I find that I'd be\nwilling to pay RSA for the right to use such a system, especially given the\nalternative.  If you were unwilling to give up your secret key, then you'd\nprobably stay in jail (has anyone got a real legal precedent for this?).\n   This would allow court-issued warrants to be used to gather information\non suspected criminals, but it couldn't be done in secrecy, and there\nwould be enormously less likelihood of corruption or theft of escrowed keys.\n(Maybe someone from the law-enforcement or intelligent community will correct\nme, but this doesn't *seem* like such a big loss in terms of law-enforcement\ncapabilities.)\n \n   Any comments?

Presumably, the key split is so that no one group controls the privacy\nof the key, and that it would be infeasible to illicitly gain access from\nboth agents.\n\nHowever, if one agent wishes to break the crypto without the cooperation\nof the other agent, a 40-bit key is not going to stand in the way of a\nbrute force attack.  If an agency (for example, the NSA) were to hold one\nof the two key-halves, then I don't imagine they really need the other half of\nthe key to start listening in.\n\nOr was that the point?   <grin>\n\n\n(This is not to imply, at all, that I like the idea of the rest of the\nsystem.)
It also falls within the purview of the ACLU, but that doesn't mean\nthe ACLU (or the EFF) would be the most effective instrument to \n"win the hearts and minds" in favor of access to cryptography. \n\nIt's precisely slogans like "cryptography makes censorship impossible"\nwhich stand to torpedo any attempt to generate a broad consensus in favor\nof encryption.  It is not true, and in the context of a public debate it\nwould be a dangerous red herring.  Advocates of strong crypto had better\nprepare themselves to answer such charges in pragmatic terms that laypeople\nand politicians can sympathize with. The usual mumblings about\nConstitutional amendments are not enough.
Simple -- if you have a choice between:\n\n 1. American manufacturers peddling Cripple Chips with a secret untested\n     algorithm whose keys are held by people with a history of untrustworthy\n     behavoir, or\n\n 2. Japanese (to pick the obvious example) manufacturers peddling encryption\n     chips with an algorithm that has faced public scrutiny and keys under\n     the control of the user,
I suspect that the decisive element in the political battle will be the\nFUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) factor.\n  If the people who would be end users of the Cripple Chip hear of the whole\ndebate only vaguely -- the government says it's solid; other people in the\nfield say it's Swiss cheese -- the balance of doubt could shift against the\nFeds.  Any attempt to limit other forms of encryption could then be presented\nas the government covering its own butt by protecting its poor product from\nsuperior competition.\n  Comments?
As usually, you are not reading. The proposal -does- say that it is a\n"voluntary program". This doesn't make it more desirable, though...\n\n\n"Secure"? How do you know? Because NSA is trying to make you believe it?\n"Trust us." Yeah, right.\n\n"Otherwise you are on your own"? How do you know that tomorrow they\nwill not outlaw encrypring devices that don't use "their" technology?\nBecause they are promising you? Gee, they are not doing even that -\nread the proposal again.\n\nRegards,\nVesselin
It has been done already!\n\nIn the UK the Atari ST box was shipped with 360K disks in the first few\nyears and then later 720K disks. In order to make life less complicated,\nmany freebie disks on mags were double formatted like this. Side 0 of the\ndisk had 360K on it and could be read  by any ST. It also had a flip-side\nprogram. This would swap the sides around so that side 1 became side 0.\n\n--
Better yet, instead of thrashing around on the DOS file system, take\nit a step further.  Write yourself a minimal "file system" program that\nis used to create/delete files, en/decrypt them to ramdisk, list a\ndirectory. Put the util, password protected, on a floppy.\n\n   The catch is that the storage space used by this util is NOT part\nof the DOS file system.  Instead, defrag your disk, thus packing all\nallocated clusters into clusters 0-n.  Then use the back end of the\npartition to hold your 'stealth' file system.  Or, leave a small 2nd\npartition on the disk that is not assigned to DOS.  Another approach\nmight be to use a directory that contains a set of invariant files (DOS\nsystem files, for instance).  Due to DOS allocating a minimum storage \nunit of a "cluster" there is unused physical space on the disk between\nthe tail end of each file and the end of its associated cluster. These\ndead spaces could be concatenated and used to hold your stealth file\nsystem.\n\n   Now you have a situation where no encrypted data "appears" on your\ndisk at all :-).
and\nand\n\nabout Coca-Cola and Pepsi Cola and what they can teach us.\n\n\nSurely, if we must use pop patent law examples to discuss RC2 and RC4,\nit would make more sense to consider the case of RC Cola?
(quoting someone else here) \n\n\n								Yeah!\n\n	The algorithm is classified because a military contract (or similar\ngovernment equivalent to military) has been let for this "proprietary"\ndesign that the Feds say that NSA developed.  Is there a patent?  Is that\npatent publicly available?  My betting is that that too is classified.\n\n	If the algorithm were made public, or reverse-engineered, it would\ncompromise not only the goal of Justice of being able to read every chip\nusers cypto-data but would reduce profits for the selected chip maker.\n\n	Wouldn't that just be too bad?
Ergo, if your life is sufficiently boring, you have no need for privacy?\n\n(This is not meant to be personal, just the logical conclusion of your\nstatement.)

Helsingius?\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nIDENTITY\n========\n\n_____\n<1.1> What is `identity' on the internet?\n\n  Generally, today people's `identity' on the internet is primarily\n  determined by their email address in the sense that this is their\n  most unchanging 'face' in the electronic realm.   This is your\n  login name qualified by the complete address domain information,\n  for example ``ld231782@longs.lance.colostate.edu''.  People see\n  this address when receiving mail or reading USENET posts from you\n  and in other situations where programs record usage.  Some obsolete\n  forms of addresses (such as BITNET) still persist.\n\n  In email messages, additional information on the path that a message\n  takes is prepended to the message received by the recipient.  This\n  information identifies the chain of hosts involved in the\n  transmission and is a very accurate trace of its origination.  This\n  type of identify-and-forward protocol is also used in the USENET\n  protocol to a lesser extent.  Forging these fields requires\n  corrupted mailing software at sites involved in the forwarding and\n  is very uncommon.  Not so uncommon is forging the chain at the\n  origination point, so that all initial sites in the list are faked\n  at the time the message is created.  Tracing these messages can be\n  difficult or impossible when the initial faked fields are names of\n  real machines and represent real transfer routes.\n\n_____\n<1.2> Why is identity (un)important on the internet?\n\n  The concept of identity is closely intertwined with communication,\n  privacy, and security, which in turn are all critical aspects of\n  computer networks. For example, the convenience of communication\n  afforded by email would be impossible without conventions for\n  identification.  But there are many potential abuses of identity\n  possible that can have very severe consequences, with massive\n  computer networks at the forefront of the issue, which can\n  potentially either exacerbate or solve these problems.\n\n  Verifying that an identity is correct is called `authentication',\n  and one classic example of the problems associated with it is\n  H.G.Well's ``War of the Worlds'' radio broadcast that fooled\n  segments of the population into thinking that an alien invasion was\n  in progress.  Hoaxes of this order are not uncommon on Usenet and\n  forged identities makes them more insidious.  People and their\n  reputations can be assaulted by forgery.\n\n  However, the fluidity of identity on the internet is for some one of\n  its most attractive features. Identity is just as useful as it is\n  harmful.  A professor might carefully explain a topic until he\n  finds he is talking to an undergraduate. A person of a particular\n  occupation may be able to converse with others who might normally\n  shun him.  Some prejudices are erased, but, on the other hand, many\n  prejudices are useful!  A scientist might argue he can better\n  evaluate the findings of a paper as a reviewer if he knows more\n  about the authors.  Likewise, he may be more likely to reject it\n  based on unfair or irrelevant criteria.  On the other side of the\n  connection,  the author may find identities of reviewers useful in\n  exerting pressure for acceptance.\n\n  Identity is especially crucial in establishing and regulating\n  `credit' (not necessarily financial) and `ownership' and `usage'. \n  Many functions in society demand reliable and accurate techniques\n  for identification. Heavy reliance will be placed on digital\n  authentication as global economies become increasingly electronic. \n  Many government functions and services are based on identification,\n  and law enforcement frequently hinges on it.  Hence, employees of\n  many government organizations push toward stronger identification\n  structures.  But when does identification invade privacy?\n\n  The growth of the internet is provoking social forces of massive\n  proportions. Decisions made now on issues of identity will affect\n  many future users, especially as the network becomes increasingly\n  global, universal, widespread, and entrenched; and the positive or\n  adverse affects of these actions, intended and inadvertent,  will\n  literally be magnified exponentially.\n\n_____\n<1.3> How does my email address (not) identify me and my background?\n\n  Your email address may contain information that influences people's\n  perceptions of your background.  The address may `identify' you as\n  from a department at a particular university, an employee at a\n  company, or a government worker.  It may contain your last name,\n  initials, or cryptic identification codes independent of both.  In\n  the US some are based on parts of social security numbers.  Others\n  are in the form 'u2338' where the number is incremented in the\n  order that new users are added to the system.\n\n  Standard internet addresses  also can contain information  on your\n  broad geographical location or nationhood.  However, none of this\n  information is guaranteed to be correct or be there at all.  The\n  fields in the domain qualification of the username are based on\n  rather arbitrary organization, such as (mostly invisible) network\n  cabling distributions.  The only point to make is that early fields\n  in the address are more specific (such as specific computer names\n  or local networks) and the later ones the most general (such as\n  continental domains).  Typically the first field is the name of the\n  computer receiving mail.\n\n  Gleaning information from the email address alone is sometimes an\n  inspired art or an inconsistent and futile exercise.  (For more\n  information, see the FAQs on email  addresses and known\n  geographical distributions below.)  However, UNIX utilities exist\n  to aid in the quest (see the question on this).\n\n  Common Suffixes\n  ---------------\n\n  .us    United States\n  .uk    United Kingdom\n  .ca    Canada\n  .fi    Finland\n  .au    Australia\n\n  .edu   university or college\n  .com   commercial organization\n  .org   'other' (e.g. nonprofit organization)\n  .gov   government\n  .mil   military site\n \n_____\n<1.4> How can I find out more about somebody with a given email address?\n\n  One simple way is to send email to that address, asking.  Another\n  way is to send mail to the postmaster at that address (i.e.\n  postmaster@address), although the postmaster's job is more to help\n  find user ID's of particular people given their real name and solve\n  mail routing problems.  The sysadmin (i.e. `root@address') may also\n  be able to supply information.  Users with related email address\n  may have information.  However, all of these methods rely on the\n  time and patience of others so use them minimally.\n\n  One of the most basic tools for determining identity over the\n  internet is the UNIX utility 'finger'.  The basic syntax is:\n\n    finger user@here.there.everywhere\n\n  This utility uses communication protocols to query the computer\n  named in the address for information on the user named.  The\n  response is generated completely by the receiving computer and may\n  be in any format.  Possible responses are as follows:\n\n  - A message `unknown host' meaning some aspect of the address is\n    incorrect, two lines with no information and '???'.\n  \n  - A message 'In real life: ???' in which case the receiving computer\n    could not find any kind of a match on the username. The finger\n    utility may return this response in other situations.\n  \n  - A listing of information associated with multiple users. Some\n    computers will search only for matching user IDs, others will\n    attempt to find the username you specified as a substring of all\n    actual full names of users kept in a local database.\n  \n  At some sites 'finger' can be used to get a list of all users on the\n  system with a `finger @address'.  In general this is often\n  considered weak security, however, because `attackers' know valid\n  user ID's to `crack' passwords.\n\n  More information on the fields returned by `finger' is given below. \n  More information on `finger' and locating people's email addresses\n  is given in the email FAQ (such as the WHOIS lookup utility).  Just\n  as you can use these means to find out about others, they can use\n  them to find out about you.  You can `finger' yourself to find out\n  what is publicly reported by your UNIX system about you.  Be\n  careful when modifying `finger' data; virtually anyone with\n  internet access worldwide can query this information.  In one\n  amazing case, the New York Times writer J. Markoff uncovered the\n  identity of R. Morris, author of the Internet Worm,  through\n  the use of an anonymous tip and 'finger'.  See the book Cyberspace\n  by K. Hafner and J. Markoff.\n\n_____\n<1.5> Why is identification (un)stable on the internet?\n\n  Generally, identity is an amorphous and almost nonexistent concept\n  on the Internet for a variety of reasons.  One is the inherent\n  fluidity of `cyberspace' where people emerge and submerge\n  frequently, and absences are not readily noted in the `community'. \n  Most people remember faces and voices, the primary means of casual\n  identification in the 'real world'.  The arbitary and cryptic \n  sequences of letters and digits comprising most email addresses are\n  not particularly noticeable or memorable and far from a unique\n  identification of an individual, who may use multiple accounts on\n  multiple machines anywhere in the world.\n\n  Currently internet users do not really have any great assurances\n  that the messages in email and USENET are from who they appear to\n  be. A person's mailing address is far from an identification of an\n  individual.  \n  \n  - Anyone with access to the account, e.g. they know the password,\n    either legitimately or otherwise, can send mail with that address\n    in the From: line.\n  \n  - Email addresses for an individual tend to change frequently as\n    they switch jobs or make moves inside their organizations. \n\n  - As part of current mailing protocol standards, forging the From:\n    line in mail messages is a fairly trivial operation for many\n    hackers.\n    \n  The status and path information prepended to messages by\n  intermediate hosts is generally unforgeable. In general, while\n  possible, forgeries are fairly rare on most newsgroups and in\n  email.  Besides these pathological cases abve there are many basic\n  problems with today's internet protocols affecting identification\n  on the internet:\n\n  - Internet mail standards, described in RFC-822, are still evolving\n    rapidly and not entirely orderly.  For example, standards for\n    mail address `munging' or `parsing' tend to vary slightly between\n    sites and frequently mean the difference between finding\n    addresses and bouncing mail.\n  \n  - Domain names and computer names are frequently changed at sites,\n    and there are delays in the propagation of this data.\n  \n  - Addresses cannot be resolved when certain critical computers\n    crash, such as the receiving computer or other computers involved\n    in resolving names into addresses called `nameservers'. \n  \n  - A whole slew of problems is associated with  `nameservers'; if\n    they are not updated they will not find name addresses, and even\n    the operation of what constitutes `updating' has different\n    interpretations at different sites.\n  \n  The current internet mailing and addressing protocols are slightly\n  anachronistic in that they were created when the network was\n  somewhat obscure and not widespread, with only a fraction of the\n  traffic it now sees.  Today a large proportion of internet traffic\n  is email, comprising  millions of messages.\n\n_____\n<1.6> What is the future of identification on the internet?\n\n  Some new technologies and standards are introducing facial images\n  and voice messages  into mail and these will improve the sense of\n  community that comes from the familiarity of identification.\n  However, they are not currently widespread, require large amounts\n  of data transfer, standardized software, and make some compromises\n  in privacy.\n\n  Promising new cryptographic techniques may make 'digital signatures'\n  and 'digital authentication' common (see below).  Also, the trend\n  in USENET standards is toward greater authentication of posted\n  information.  On the other hand, advances in ensuring anonymity\n  (such as remailers) are forthcoming.  See below.\n\n\nPRIVACY\n=======\n\n_____\n<2.1> What is `privacy' on the internet?\n\n  Generally, while `privacy' has multiple connotations in society and\n  perhaps even more on the internet, in cyberspace most take it to\n  mean that you have exclusive use and access to your account and the\n  data stored on and and directed to it (such as email), and you do\n  not encounter arbitrary restrictions or searches.  In other words, \n  others may obtain data associated with your account, but not\n  without your permission.  These ideas are probably both fairly\n  limiting and liberal in their scope in what most internet users\n  consider their private domains.  Some users don't expect or want\n  any privacy, some expect and demand it.\n\n_____\n<2.2> Why is privacy (un)important on the internet?\n\n  This is a somewhat debatable and inflammatory topic, arousing\n  passionate opinions.  On the internet, some take privacy for\n  granted and are rudely surprised to find it tenuous or nonexistent.\n  Most governments have rules that protect privacy (such as the\n  illegal search and seizure clause of the U.S. constitution, adopted\n  by others) but have many that are antithetical to it (such as laws\n  prohibiting secret communications or allowing wiretapping). These\n  rules generally carry over to the internet with few specific rules\n  governing it.  However, the legal repercussions of the global\n  internet are still largely unknown and untested (i.e. no strong\n  legal precedents and court cases).  The fact that internet traffic\n  frequently passes past international boundaries, and is not\n  centrally managed, significantly complicates and strongly\n  discourages its regulation.\n\n_____\n<2.3> How (in)secure are internet networks?\n\n  - `Theoretically' people at any site in the chain of sites with\n    access to hardware and network media that transmits data over the\n    Internet  could potentially monitor or archive it. However, the\n    sheer volume and general 'noise' inherent to this data makes\n    these scenarios highly improbable, even by government agencies\n    with supposedly vast funding and resources.\n  \n  - Technologies exist to `tap' magnetic fields given off by\n    electrical wires without detection.  Less obscurely, any machine\n    with a network connection is a potential station for traffic\n    detection, but this scenario requires knowledge and access to\n    very low-level hardware (the network card) to pursue, if even\n    possible.\n  \n  - A company Network General Inc. is one of many that manufactures\n    and markets sophisticated network monitoring tools that can\n    'filter' and read packets by arbitrary criteria for\n    troubleshooting purposes, but the cost of this type of device is\n    prohibitive for casual use.\n\n  Known instances of the above types of security  breaches at a major\n  scale (such as at network hubs) are very rare. The greatest risks\n  tend to emerge locally.  Note that all these approaches are almost\n  completely defused with the use of cryptography.\n    \n_____\n<2.4> How (in)secure is my account?\n\n  By default, not very.  There are a multitude of factors that may\n  reinforce or compromise aspects of your privacy on the internet. \n  First, your account must be secure from other users. The universal\n  system is to use a password, but if it is `weak' (i.e. easy to\n  guess) this security is significantly diminished.  Somewhat\n  surprisingly and frighteningly to some, certain  users of the\n  system, particularly the administrator, generally have unlimited\n  access regardless of passwords, and may grant that access to\n  others.  This means that they may read any file in your account\n  without detection.\n\n  Furthermore, not universally known, most UNIX systems keep fairly\n  extensive accounting records of when and where you logged in, what\n  commands you execute, and when they are executed (in fact, login\n  information is usually public). Most features of this `auditing' or\n   `process accounting' information are enabled by default after the\n  initial installation and the system administrator may customize it\n  to strengthen or weaken it to satisfy performance or privacy aims. \n  This information is frequently consulted for troubleshooting\n  purposes and may otherwise be ignored.  This data tracks\n  unsuccessful login attempts and other 'suspicious' activities on\n  the system. A traditional part of the UNIX system that tracks user\n  commands is easily circumvented by the user with the use of\n  symbolic links (described  in 'man ln').\n  \n  UNIX implementations vary widely particularly in tracking features\n  and new sophisticated mechanisms are introduced by companies\n  regularly. Typically system adminstrators augment the basic UNIX\n  functionality with public-domain programs and locally-developed\n  tools for monitoring, and use them only to isolate `suspicious'\n  activity as it arises (e.g. remote accesses to the 'passwd' file, incorrect\n  login attempts, remote connection attempts, etc.).\n  \n  Generally, you should expect little privacy on your account for\n  various reasons:\n  \n  - Potentially, every keystroke you type could be intercepted by\n    someone else. \n\n  - System administrators make extensive backups that are completely\n    invisible to users which may record the states of an account over\n    many weeks. \n\n  - Erased files can, under many operating systems, be undeleted. \n\n  - Most automated services keep logs of use for troubleshooting or\n    otherwise; for example FTP sites usually log the commands and\n    record the domain originations of users, including anonymous\n    ones.\n\n  - Some software exacerbates these problems.  See the section on\n    ``X Windows (in)security''.\n\n  Indepedent of malevolent administrators are fellow users, a much\n  more commonly harmful threat. There are multiple ways to help\n  ensure that your account will not be accessed by others, and\n  compromises can often be traced to failures in these guidelines:\n\n  - Choose a secure password.  Change it periodically.\n  - Make sure to logout always.\n  - Do not leave a machine unattended for long.\n  - Make sure no one watches you when you type your password.\n  - Avoid password references in email.\n  - Be conservative in the use of the .rhost file.\n  - Use utilities like `xlock' to protect a station, but be\n    considerate.\n\n  Be wary of situations where you think you should supply your\n  password.  There are only several basic situations where UNIX\n  prompts you for a password: when you are logging in to a system or\n  changing your password.  Situations can arise in which prompts for\n  passwords are forged by other users, especially in cases where you\n  are talking to them (such as Internet Relay Chat).  Also, be  aware\n  that forged login screens are one method to illegitimately obtain \n  passwords.\n\n\n  (Thanks to Jim Mattson <mattson@cs.ucsd.edu> for contributions\n  here.)\n\n_____\n<2.5> How (in)secure are my files and directories?\n\n  The most important privacy considerations are related to file\n  rights, and many lapses can be traced to their misunderstood nature\n  or haphazard maintenance. Be aware of the rights associated with\n  your files and directories in UNIX. If the `x' (`execute') right on\n  your parent directory is off for users, groups, and other, these\n  users cannot gain information on anything in your directories. \n  Anything less may allow others to read, change, or even delete\n  files in your home directory. The rights on a directory supersede\n  the rights associated with files in that directory. For a\n  directory, 'x' means that access to the files (or subdirectories)\n  in the directory is possible -- if you know their names.  To list\n  the contents of the directory, however, requires the 'r' right.\n \n  By default most accounts are accessable only to the owner, but the\n  initial configuration varies between sites based on administrator\n  preference.  The default file mode specifies the initial rights\n  associated with newly created files, and can be set in the shell\n  with `umask'.  The details of rights implementations tend to vary\n  between versions of UNIX.  Consult man pages on `chmod' and `ls'.\n\n  Examples\n  --------\n\n    traver.lance % ls -ld ~\n    drwx------ 15 ld231782     1536 Jan 31 21:22 /users/ld231782/\n\n  Here is a listing of the rights associated with a user's home\n  directory, denoted by `~'.  The columns at the left identify what\n  rights are available. The first column identifies the entry as a\n  directory, and the next three columns mean that read, write, and\n  execute rights, respectively, are permitted for that user.  For\n  directories, the `x' right means that contents (file and\n  subdirectory names) within that directory can be listed. The\n  subsequent columns indicate that no other users have any rights to\n  anything in the directory tree originating at that point.  They\n  can't even `see' any lower files or subdirectories; the hierarchy\n  is completely invisible to them.\n\n    traver.lance % ls -l msg\n    -rw-r--r--  1 ld231782   35661 Jan 29 23:13 msg\n    traver.lance % chmod u=rw,g=,o= msg\n    traver.lance % ls -l msg\n    -rw-------  1 ld231782   35661 Jan 29 23:13 msg\n\n  Here the modes on the file `msg' were changed to take away rights\n  from `group' and `other'. \n  \n  Note that `ls -l <file>' requires both the 'r' right to get the list\n  of files and subdirectories, and the 'x' right to access the files\n  and subdirectories in order to get their size, etc. For example,\n  suppose the directory `foo' has rights dr--r--r--,  the following\n  is possible:\n\n    ls foo\n\n  These commands would fail independent of file rights:\n  \n    ls -l foo\n    ls -l foo/file\n    cat foo/file\n    cd foo\n\n  If the directory `foo' has rights d--x--x--x, the following are\n  possible if it is known beforehand that `foo' contains an 'r'\n  readable file named `file':\n  \n    ls -l foo/file\n    cat foo/file\n    cd foo\n  \n  The following commands fail:\n  \n    ls foo\n    ls -l foo\n  \n\n  (Thanks to Uwe Waldmann <uwe@mpi-sb.mpg.de> for contributions here.)\n\n_____\n<2.6> How (in)secure is X Windows?\n\n  X Windows is the primary software developed by the MIT Athena\n  project which is funded by U.S. government grants to develop\n  applications to harness the power of networks in enhancing\n  computational tasks, particularly the human-computer interface. \n  The software implements a client-server interface to a computer via\n  graphical windows. In this case the `client' is the application\n  requesting or utilizing  graphical resources (such as windows or a\n  mouse) and the `server' is the machine that provides them.  In many\n  situations the client is an application program running on the same\n  machine as the server.\n\n  The great utility of X Windows comes from its complete dissociation\n  of the client and server so that windows may be `broadcast' to a\n  server at a remote location from the  client. Unfortunately this\n  dynamic power also introduces many deep, intricate, and complicated\n  security considerations.  The primary security and privacy issue\n  associated with X Windows is that much more sensitive data may be\n  sent over a network, and over wider regions, than in the case where\n  the human is situated near the host computer.  Currently there is\n  no encryption of data such as screen updates and keystrokes in X\n  Windows.\n\n  Due to either intentional design decisions or unintentional design\n  flaws,  early versions of the X Window system are extremely\n  insecure. Anyone with an account on the server machine can disrupt\n  that display or read it electronically based on access to the\n  device unix:0.0 by any regular user.   There are no protections\n  from this type of access in these versions.   The problem arises\n  because the security is completely based on machine addresses\n  rather than users, such that any user at a `trusted' machine is\n  himself trusted. Quoting from X documentation (man Xsecurity):\n  \n  > Any client on a host in the host access control list is allowed\n  > access to the X server. This system can work reasonably well in\n  > an environment where everyone trusts everyone, or when only a\n  > single person can log into a given machine...This system does not\n  > work well when multiple people can log in to a single machine and\n  > mutual trust does not exist. \n  \n  With the access control list, the `xhost' command may prevent some\n  naive attempts (i.e. those other than the direct-access unix:0.0\n  evasion); the syntax as typed on the host machine is  ``xhost\n  +[name]'' where [name] is the domain name or internet address of an\n  authorized client machine. By default clients running nonlocal to\n  the host are disabled.  Public domain programs to disrupt a display\n  momentarily (such as 'flip' or slowly mirror the screen image, or\n  cause pixels to 'melt' down to the bottom) have been circulating on\n  the internet among hackers for several years and played as pranks\n  on unsuspecting or inexperienced users.  Much more serious security\n  breaches are conceivable from similar mechanisms exploiting this\n  inherent weaknesses.  (The minimal, easily-bypassed `trusted'\n  security mode of `xhost' has been jokingly referred to as ``X\n  Hanging Open, Security Terrible.''). \n\n  New versions of the X Window system (X11R5 and higher) by default \n  make server access as secure as the file system using a .Xauthority\n  file and 'magic cookies'.  Remote machines must have a code in the\n  .Xauthority file in the home directory that matches the code\n  allowed by the server.  Many older programs and even new\n  vendor-supplied code does not support or is incompatible with\n  `magic cookies'. The basic magic cookie mechanism is vulnerable to\n  monitoring techniques described earlier because no encryption of\n  keys occurs in transmission.  X11R5 also includes other\n  sophisticated encryption mechanisms.  Try `man Xsecurity' to find\n  out what is supported at your site.  Even though improved security \n  mechanisms have been available in X Windows since ~1990, local\n  sites often update this software infrequently because installation\n  is extremely complex.\n\n\n  (Thanks to Marc Vanheyningen <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu>, \n  Jim Mattson <mattson@cs.ucsd.edu>, and Bill Marshall\n  <marshall@cs.iastate.edu> for contributions here.)\n\n_____\n<2.7> How (in)secure is my email?\n\n  By default, not very.  The characters that you are reading are\n  almost certainly encoded in ASCII, the American Standard Code for\n  Information Interchange that maps alphabetic and symbolic\n  characters onto numeric codes and vice versa.  Virtually every\n  computer system uses this code, and if not, has ways of converting\n  to and from it.  When you write a mail message, by default it is\n  being sent in ASCII,  and since the standard is virtually\n  universal, there is no intrinsic privacy.  Despite milleniums worth\n  of accumulated cryptographic knowledge, cryptographic technologies\n  are only recently being established that afford high priority to\n  privacy as a primary criteria in computer and network design.  Some\n  potential pitfalls in privacy are as follows:\n\n  - The most serious threats are instances of immature or unscrupulous\n    system operators reading private mail in the `spool files' at a\n    local site (i.e. at the source or destination of the message),\n    such as a university. \n  \n  - System administrators may also release files to law enforcement\n    agencies, but conventions and protocols for warrants involving\n    computer searches have still not been strongly established and\n    tested legally.\n\n  - Note that bounced messages go to postmasters at a given site in\n    their entirety.  This means that if you address mail with an\n    incorrect address it has a good chance of being seen by a human\n    other than the recipient.\n\n  - Typically new user accounts are always set up such that the local\n    mail directory is private, but this is not guaranteed and can be\n    overridden.\n\n  - Finally, be aware that some mailing lists (email addresses of \n    everyone on a list) are actually publicly accessable via mail \n    routing software mechanisms.  This `feature' can be disabled.\n\n  Most potential compromises in email privacy can be thoroughly\n  avoided with the use of strong end-to-end cryptography, which has\n  its own set of caveats (for example, unscrupulous administrators\n  may still be a threat if the encryption site is shared or\n  nonlocal).  See the sections on ``email privacy'' and ``email\n  policies.''\n\n_____\n<2.8> How am I (not) liable for my email and postings?\n\n  As punishment or whatever, your system administrator can revoke\n  certain `privileges' such as emailing, USENET posting or reading\n  certain groups, file transferring, remote communications, or\n  generally any subset of capabilities available from your account. \n  This all is completely at the discretion of the local administrator\n  and under the procedures followed at a particular site, which in\n  many cases are haphazard and crisis-oriented.  Currently there are\n  virtually no widespread, uniform guidelines or procedures  for\n  restricting use to any internet services, and local administrators\n  are free to make arbitrary decisions on access.\n\n  Today punitive measures are regularly applied in various situations.\n  In the typical scenario complaint(s) reach a system adminstrator\n  regarding abuses by a user, usually but not necessarily preceded by\n  complaints to the user in email, regarding that person's\n  objectionable email or postings.  `abusive' posters to USENET are\n  usually first given admonitions from their system administrators as\n  urged by others on the `net'. (The debate persists endlessly on\n  many newsgroups whether this is also used  as a questionable means\n  of attacking or silencing `harmless crackpots' or censoring\n  unpopular opinions.)\n  \n  System administrators at remote sites regularly cooperate to\n  'squelch' severe cases of abuse.  In general, however, by tradition\n  Usenet readers are remarkably tolerant of diverse views and uses of\n  the system, but a colorful vocabularly of slang helps describe\n  their alternatives when this patience is sapped: the options\n  wielded by the individual user are to simply advance to the next\n  message (referred to as ``hitting the `n' key''), or to `plonk'\n  annoying posters (according to the Hacker's Dictionary, the sound a\n  jerk makes at the end of a fall to the bottom of a kill file).\n\n  In cases where punitive actions are applied, generally system\n  administrators are least likely to restrict email.  USENET postings\n  are much more commonly restricted, either to individual users or \n  entire groups (such as a university campus).  Restrictions are most\n  commonly associated with the following `abuses':\n\n  - harassing or threatening notes, `email terrorism'\n  - illegal uses, e.g. piracy or propagation of copyrighted material\n  - `ad hominem' attacks, i.e. insulting the reputation of the\n    poster instead of citing the content of the message\n  - intentional or extreme vulgarity and offensiveness\n  - inappropriate postings, esp. binary files in regular groups\n    `mail-bombing': inundating mail boxes with numerous or massive\n    files\n\n  Major problems originate from lack of distinctions in private and\n  official email or postings.  Most users have internet access via\n  accounts at businesses or universities and their activities on the\n  internet can be construed as representative of their parent\n  organizations. Many people put disclaimers in their `signatures' in\n  an attempt dissociate their identity and activities from parent\n  organizations as a precaution. A recent visible political case\n  involves the privacy of electronic mail  written by White House\n  staff members of the Bush administration.  Following are some\n  guidelines:\n\n  - Acquaint yourself with your company or university policy.\n  - If possible, avoid use of your company email address for private\n    communication.\n  - Use a disclaimer.\n  - Keep a low profile (avoid `flamewars' or simply don't post).\n  - Avoid posting information that could be  construed to be\n    proprietary or `internal'.\n\n  The following references are available from ftp.eff.com\n  (see also the section on ``internet use policies''):\n\n  /pub/academic/banned.1991\n  /pub/academic/banned.1992\n  ---\n    Computer material that was banned/challenged in academia in 1991\n    and 1992 including USENET hierarchies.\n\n  /pub/academic/cases\n  ---\n    This is an on-line collection of information about specific\n    computers and academic freedom cases. File README is a detailed\n    description of the items in the directory.\n\n  /pub/academic/faq/netnews.liability\n  ---\n    Notes on university liability for Usenet.\n\n_____\n<2.9> How do I provide more/less information to others on my identity?\n\n  The public information of your identity and account is mostly\n  available though the UNIX utility `finger' described above. \n  \n  - You have control over most of this information with the utility\n    `chfn', the specifics vary between sites (on some systems use\n    `passwd -f').\n   \n  - You can provide unlimited information in the .plan file which is\n    copied directly to the destination during the fingering. \n    \n  - A technique that works at some sites allows you to find out who is\n    'finger'ing you and even to  vary the .plan file sent to them.\n    \n  - Your signature is determined by the environment variable SIGNATURE\n    \n  - USENET signatures are conventionally stored in the .signature file\n    in your home directory.\n    \n  Providing less information on your online identity is more difficult\n  and involved.  One approach is to ask your system adminstrator to\n  change or delete information about you (such as your full name). \n  You may be able to obtain access on a public account or one from\n  someone unrelated to you personally.  You may be able to remotely\n  login (via modem or otherwise) to computers that you are not\n  physically near.  These are tactics for hiding or masking your\n  online activities but nothing is foolproof.  Consult man pages on\n  the 'chmod' command and the default file mode.  Generally, files on\n  a shared system have good safeguards within the user pool but very\n  little protection is possible from corrupt system administrators.\n\n  To mask your identity in email or on USENET you can use different\n  accounts. More untraceable are new `anonymous posting' and\n  remailing services that are very recently being established.  See\n  below.\n\n______\n<2.10> Who is my sysadmin?  What does s/he know about me?\n\n  The requirements and screening for getting a system administration\n  job (and thereby access to all information on a system) vary widely\n  between sites and are sometimes frighteningly lax, especially at\n  universities.  Many UNIX systems at universities are largely\n  managed by undergraduates with a background in computing and often\n  `hacking'.  In general, commercial and industrial sites are more\n  strict on qualifications and background, and government sites are\n  extremely strict.\n\n  The system adminstrator (root user) can monitor what commands you\n  used and at what times.  S/he may have a record (backups) of files\n  on your account over a few weeks. S/he can monitor when  you send\n  email or post USENET messages, and potentially read either.  S/he\n  may have access to records indicating what hosts you are using,\n  both locally and elsewhere.  Administrators sometimes employ\n  specialized programs to  track `strange' or `unusual' activity,\n  which can potentially be misused.\n\n______\n<2.11> Why is privacy (un)stable on the internet?\n\n  For the numerous reasons listed above, privacy should not be an\n  expectation with current use of the internet.  Furthermore, large\n  parts of the internet are funded by the U.S. NSF (National Science\n  Foundation) which places certain restrictions on its use (such as\n  prohibiting commercial use).  Some high-level officials in this and\n  other government agencies may be opposed to emerging techniques to\n  guarantee privacy (such as encryption and anonymous services).\n\n  Historically the major threats to privacy on the internet have been\n  local. Perhaps the most common example of this are the widespread\n  occurrences of university administrators refusing to carry some\n  portion of USENET newsgroups labelled as `pornographic'. The\n  `alternative' hierarchy in the USENET system, which has virtually\n  no restrictions on propagation and new group creation, is\n  frequently targeted (although this material may appear anywhere).\n\n  From the global point of view traffic is generally completely\n  unimpeded on the internet  and only the most egregious offenders\n  are pursued.  For example,  verbatim transcriptions of copyrighted\n  material (such as newspaper or magazine articles) are posted to\n  USENET with regularity without major consequences (some email\n  complaints may ensue).  More astonishing to some is that currently\n  significant portions of USENET traffic, and less so internet\n  traffic, is comprised of sexually-explicit digitized images almost\n  entirely originating from copyrighted material (newsgroups such as\n  `alt.sex' regularly have the  highest traffic).\n  \n______\n<2.12> What is the future of privacy on the internet?\n\n  Some argue that the internet currently has an adequate or\n  appropriate level of privacy.  Others will argue that as a\n  prototype for future global networks it has woefully inadequate\n  safeguards.  The internet is growing to become a completely global,\n  international superhighway for data, and this traffic will\n  inevitably entail data such as voice messages, postal mail, and\n  many other items of extremely personal nature. Computer items that\n  many people consider completely private (such as their local hard\n  drives) will literally be inches from global network connections.\n  Also, sensitive industrial and business information is exchanged\n  over networks currently and this volume may conceivably merge with\n  the internet.\n  \n  Most would agree that, for these basic but sensitive uses of the\n  internet, no significant mechanisms are currently in place to\n  ensure much privacy. New standards are calling for uniform\n  introduction of `privacy enhanced mail' (PEM) which uses encryption\n  technologies to ensure privacy, so that privacy protection is\n  automatic, and may significantly improve safeguards.\n\n  The same technology that can be extremely destructive to privacy\n  (such as with  surreptitious surveilance) can be overwhelmingly\n  effective in protecting  it (e.g. with encryption). Some government\n  agencies are opposed to unlimited privacy in general, and believe\n  that it should lawfully be forfeited in cases of criminal conduct\n  (e.g. court-authorized wiretapping).  However, powerful new\n  technologies to protect privacy on computers are becoming\n  increasingly popular, provoking some to say that ``the cat is out\n  of the bag'' and the ``genie can't be put back in the bottle''.  In\n  less idiomatic terms, they believe that the spread of strong\n  cryptography is already underway will be socially and technically\n  unstoppable.\n  \n  To date, no feasible system that guarantees both secure\n  communication and government oversight has been proposed (the two\n  goals are largely incompatible). Proposals for ``registration'' of\n  secret keys (by D. Denning on sci.crypt, for example) have been met\n  with hot controversy at best and ridicule and derision at worst,\n  mainly because of concerns for the right to privacy and objections\n  of inherent feasibility.  Electronic privacy issues, and\n  particularly the proper roles of networks and the internet, will\n  foreseeably become highly visible and explosive over the next few\n  years.\n\n\nANONYMITY\n=========\n\n_____\n<3.1> What is `anonymity' on the internet?\n\n  Simply stated, anonymity is the absence of identity, the\n  ultimate in privacy. However, there are several variations on\n  this simple theme.  A person may wish to be consistently\n  identified by a certain pseudonym or `handle' and establish a\n  reputation under it in some area, providing pseudo-anonymity.\n  A person may wish to be completely untraceable for a single\n  one-way message (a sort of `hit-and-run'). Or, a person may\n  wish to be openly anonymous but carry on a conversation with\n  others (with either known or anonymous identities) via an\n  `anonymous return address'.  A user may wish to appear as a\n  `regular user' but actually be untraceable.  Sometimes a user\n  wishes to hide who he is sending mail to (in addition to the\n  message itself). The anonymous item itself may be directed at\n  individuals or groups.  A user may wish to access some\n  service and hide all  signs of the association. \n  \n  All of these uses are feasible on the internet but are currently\n  tricky to carry out in practice, because of all the tracking\n  mechanisms inherent to operating systems and network protocols. \n  Officials of the NSF and other government agencies may be opposed\n  to any of these uses because of the potential for abuse. \n  Nevertheless, the inherent facelessness of large networks will\n  always guarantee a certain element of anonymity.\n\n_____\n<3.2> Why is `anonymity' (un)important on the internet?\n\n  Anonymity is another powerful tool that can be beneficial or\n  problematic depending on its use.  Arguably absence of\n  identification is important as the presence of it.  It may be the\n  case that many strong benefits from electronic anonymity will be\n  discovered that were unforeseen and unpredicted, because true\n  anonymity has been historically very difficult to establish.\n\n  One can use anonymity to make personal statements to a colleague\n  that would sabotage a relationship if stated openly (such as\n  employer/employee scenarios).  One can use it to pass information\n  and evade any threat of direct retribution.  For example,\n  `whistleblowers' reporting on government abuses (economic, social,\n  or  political) can bring issues to light without fear of stigma or\n  retaliation. Sensitive, personal, potentially damaging information\n  is often posted to some USENET groups, a risky situation where\n  anonymity allows conversations to be carried on completely\n  independent of the identities of the participants.  Some police\n  departments run phone services that allow anonymous reporting of\n  crimes; such uses would be straightforward on the network.\n  Unfortunately, extortion and harassment become more insidious with\n  assurances of anonymity.\n\n_____\n<3.3> How can anonymity be protected on the internet?\n\n  The chief means, as alluded to above, are masking identities in\n  email and posting. However, anonymous accounts (public accounts as\n  accessable and anonymous as e.g. public telephones) may be\n  effective as well, but this use is generally not officially\n  supported and even discouraged by some system adminstrators and NSF\n  guidelines.  The nonuniformity in the requirements of obtaining\n  accounts at different sites and institutions makes anonymous\n  accounts generally difficult to obtain to the public at large.\n\n  Many communications protocols are inherently detrimental to\n  anonymity.  Virtually every protocol in existence currently\n  contains information on both sender and receiver in every packet.\n  New communications protocols will likely develop that guarantee\n  much higher degrees of secure anonymous communication.\n\n_____\n<3.4> What is `anonymous mail'?\n\n  One approach to `anonymizing' mail has been to set up an `anonymous\n  server' that, when activated by email to its address, responds by\n  allocating and supplying an `anonymous ID' that is unique to the\n  person requesting it (based on his email address).  This will vary\n  for the same person for different machine address email\n  originations. To send anonymous mail, the user sends email directed\n  to the server containing the final destination. The server\n  `anonymizes' the message by stripping of identification information\n  and forwards the message, which appears to originate from the\n  anonymous server only from the corresponding anonymous user id. \n  This is the `interactive' use of anonymity or pseudonymity\n  mentioned above.\n\n  Another more `fringe' approach is to run a `cypherpunk' remailer\n  from a regular user account (no root system privileges are\n  required). These are currently being pioneered by  Eric Hughes and\n  Hal Finney <hal@alumni.caltech.edu>. The operator runs a process on\n  a machine that anonymizes mail sent to him with certain\n  characteristics that distinguish it from his regular incoming mail\n  (typically fields in the header). One has been implemented as a \n  PERL script running on UNIX.  Several of these are in existence\n  currently but sites and software currently are highly unstable;\n  they may be in operation outside of system administrator knowledge.\n  The remailers don't generally support anonymous return addresses. \n  Mail that is incorrectly addressed is received by the operator. \n  Generally the user of the remailer has to disavow any\n  responsibility for the messages forwarded through his system,\n  although actually may be held liable regardless.\n\n  These approaches have several serious disadvantages and weaknesses:\n  \n  - The anonymous server approach requires maintaining a mapping of\n    anonymous ID's to real addresses that must be maintained\n    indefinitely.  One alternative is to allow `deallocation' of\n    aliases at the request of the user, but this has not been\n    implemented yet.\n\n  - Although an unlikely scenario, traffic to any of these sites could\n    conceivably be monitored from the `outside', necessitating the\n    use of cryptography for basic protection,.\n\n  - Local administrators can shut them down either out of caprice or\n    under pressure from local, network, or government agencies.\n  \n  - Unscrupulous providers of the services can monitor the traffic\n    that goes through them.\n\n  - Most remailers currently keep logs that may be inspected. \n\n  - The cypherpunk approach tends to be highly unstable because these\n    operators are basically  network users who do not own the\n    equipment and are accountable  to their own system\n    administrators, who may be unaware of the use and unsympathetic\n    to the philosophy of anonymity when the operation is discovered,\n    regarding it as illicit use. \n\n  - In all cases, a high degree of trust is placed in the anonymous\n    server operator by the user.\n\n  Currently the most direct route to anonymity involves using SMTP\n  protocols to submit a message directly to a server with arbitrary\n  field information.  This practice, not uncommon to hackers, and the\n  approach used by remailers, is generally viewed with hostility by\n  most system administrators.  Information in the header routing data\n  and logs of network port connection information may be retained\n  that can be used to track the originating site.  In practice, this\n  is generally infeasible and rarely carried out.  Some\n  administrators on the network will contact local administrators to\n  request a message be tracked and its writer admonished or punished\n  more severely (such as revoking the account), all of this actually\n  happening occasionally but infrequently.\n\n  See the sections ``known anonymous mail and posting sites'' and \n  ``responsibilities associated with anonymity''.\n\n_____\n<3.5> What is `anonymous posting'?\n\n  Anonymous servers have been established as well for anonymous Usenet\n  posting with all the associated caveats above (monitored traffic,\n  capricious or risky local circumstances, logging).  Make sure to\n  test the system at least once by e.g. anonymous posting to\n  misc.test (however some operators don't recommend this because many\n  sites `autorespond' to test messages, possibly causing the\n  anonymous server to allocate anonymous IDs for those machines). \n  See the ``responsibilties associated with anonymous posting''\n  before proceeding.\n\n  Another direct route involves using NNTP protocols to submit a\n  message directly to a newserver with arbitrary field information.\n  This practice, not uncommon to hackers, is also generally viewed\n  with hostility by most system administrators, and similar\n  consequences can ensue.\n\n  See the sections ``known anonymous mail and posting sites'' and \n  ``responsibilities associated with anonymity''.\n\n_____\n<3.6> Why is anonymity (un)stable on the internet?\n\n  As noted, many factors compromise the anonymity currently available\n  to the general internet community, and these services should be\n  used with great caution.  To summarize, the technology is in its\n  infancy and current approaches are unrefined, unreliable, and not\n  completely trustworthy.  No standards have been established and\n  troubling situations of loss of anonymity and bugs in the software\n  are prevalent.  Here are some encountered and potential bugs: \n  \n  - One  anonymous remailer reallocated already allocated anonymous\n    return addresses. \n  - Others passed signature information embedded in messages\n    unaltered. \n  - Address resolution problems resulting in anonymized mail bounced\n    to a remailer are common.\n  - Forgeries to the anonymous server itself are a problem,  possibly\n    allowing unauthorized users to potentially glean anon ID - email\n    address  mappings in the alias file.  This can be remedied with\n    the use of passwords.\n  - Infinite mail loops are possible with chaining remailers.\n  \n  Source code is being distributed, tested, and refined for these\n  systems, but standards are progressing slowly and weakly.  The\n  field is not likely to improve considerably without  official\n  endorsement and action by network agencies.  The whole idea is\n  essentially still in its infancy and viewed with suspicion and\n  distrust by many on the internet, seen as illegitimate or favorable\n  to criminality.  The major objection to anonymity over regular\n  internet use  is the perceived lack of accountability to system\n  operators, i.e. invulnerability to account restrictions resulting\n  from outside complaints.  System adminstrators at some sites have\n  threatened to filter anonymous news postings generated by the\n  prominent servers from their redistribution flows.  This may only\n  have the effect of encouraging server operators to create less\n  characteristically detectable headers.  Probably the least\n  problematic approach, and the most traditional to Usenet, is for\n  individual users to deal with anonymous mail however they prefer,\n  e.g. ignoring it or filtering it with kill files.\n  \n_____\n<3.7> What is the future of anonymity on the internet?\n\n  New anonymous protocols effectively serve to significantly increase\n  safeguards of anonymity.  For example, the same mechanism that\n  routes email over multiple hosts, thereby threatening its privacy,\n  can also be used to guarantee it. In a scheme called `chaining' an\n  anonymous message is passed through multiple anonymous servers\n  before reaching a destination.  In this way generally multiple\n  links of the chain have to be `broken' for security to be\n  compromised. Re-encryption at each link makes this scenario even\n  more unlikely.  Even more significantly the anonymous remailers\n  could be spread over the internet globally so that local weaknesses\n  (such as corrupt governments or legal wiretapping within a nation)\n  would be more unlikely to sacrifice overall security by message\n  tracing. However, remailers run by corrupt operators are possible.\n  \n  The future of anonymous services on the internet is, at this time,\n  highly uncertain and fraught with peril. While specific groups seem\n  to benefit significantly from anonymous posting capabilities, many\n  feel that unlimited newsgroup scope for anonymous posting is a\n  disruptive and dangerous idea and detracts from discussions in\n  `serious' groups.   The introduction of unlimited group anonymity\n  may have fundamental repercussions on Usenet conventions and\n  distribution mechanisms such as moderated and `alt' groups have had\n  in the past. For example, as part of new group creation, the\n  charter may specify whether `anonymous' posting is (un)welcome. \n\n  Nevertheless, the widespread introduction and use of anonymity may\n  be inevitable. Based on traffic statistics, anonymous services are\n  in huge demand. Pervasive and readily available anonymity could\n  carry significant and unforeseen social consequences.  However, if\n  its use is continued to be generally regarded as subversive it may\n  be confined to the underground.  The ramifications of widespread\n  introduction of anonymity to Usenet are still largely unknown. It\n  is unclear whether it will provoke signficant amounts of new\n  traffic or, instead of expansion, cause a shift where a greater\n  portion of existing traffic is anonymized.  Conceivably the\n  services could play a role in influencing future mainstream social\n  acceptance of Usenet.\n\n\n* * *
Actually, many of us have noted this. We have noted that the program\n	started at least 4 years ago, that the contracts with VLSI Technology\n	and Microtoxin were let at least 14 months ago, that production of the\n	chips is well underway, and so forth.\n\n	Nobody I know has claimed Clinton intitiated the program. But he chose\n	to go ahead with it.\n\nPerhaps the NSA realised that *no-one* would even contemplate falling for\nthe dual-escrow bluff while under the Bush administration and *had* to\nwait for a Democrat govt to con into promoting this because people *might*\njust believe they were honest.  (Didn't work, did it? :-) )
I may be an anarchist nutcase, but I wouldn't have frothed overmuch\nhad the government proposed a secure encryption standard.  In fact,\nif the NSA had come up with a privacy chip rather than a wiretap\nchip, I would have been happy.  They *could* have done this -- set\nup an ANSI committee, picked a secure cryptosystem, defined a\nprotocol and interface, and said, "Hey, start building them."\n\nInstead we have a deliberately brain-dead version of a cryptosystem\nthat has not even been peer reviewed.  Yes, the NSA owns some smart\npeople.  But if they pulled a FEAL, well, AT&T is going to be left\nwith a lot of dud phones on its hands.\n\n\nHeh heh.  The government already gave it up for us.  Remember in the\nannouncement they described this scheme as balancing the two\nextremes of having no privacy and claiming that citizens had a\nConstitutional right to encryption?  \n\nSo much for Clinton's support of the "right of privacy".
Archive-name: ripem/faq\nLast-update: Sun, 7 Mar 93 21:00:00 -0500\n\nABOUT THIS POSTING\n------------------\nThis is a (still rather rough) listing of likely questions and\ninformation about RIPEM, a program for public key mail encryption.  It\n(this FAQ, not RIPEM) was written and will be maintained by Marc\nVanHeyningen, <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu>.  It will be posted to a\nvariety of newsgroups on a monthly basis; follow-up discussion specific\nto RIPEM is redirected to the group alt.security.ripem.\n\nThis month, I have reformatted this posting in an attempt to comply\nwith the standards for HyperText FAQ formatting to allow easy\nmanipulation of this document over the World Wide Web.  Let me know\nwhat you think.\n\nDISCLAIMER\n----------\nNothing in this FAQ should be considered legal advice, or anything\nother than one person's opinion.  If you want real legal advice, talk\nto a real lawyer.\n\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\n---------------------\n\n1)  What is RIPEM?\n\n RIPEM is a program which performs Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) using\n the cryptographic techniques of RSA and DES.  It allows your\n electronic mail to have the properties of authentication (i.e. who\n sent it can be confirmed) and privacy (i.e. nobody can read it except\n the intended recipient.)\n\n RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>.\n Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,\n which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.\n\n2)  How can I get RIPEM?\n\n RIPEM contains the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is\n considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution\n to people who are not citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. or\n Canada.  Therefore, the following request is quoted from the README\n file:\n\n #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution\n #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,\n #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.\n\n Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is\n included with the distribution.  You should read it before using\n RIPEM.\n\n The best way to get it is to ask a friend for a copy, since this will\n reduce the load on those sites that do carry it (not to mention the\n humans that run them.)  Naturally this requires that you trust the\n friend.\n\n RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent residents\n in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README file for\n info.  Last I looked, this site contains only the source tree, and\n does not contain compiled binaries or the nice Mac version.\n\n RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its "home site" on\n rpub.cl.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the\n U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out\n how to obtain access, ftp there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file\n GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are\n available here in addition to the full source tree.\n\n3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?\n\n Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of\n Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to\n Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice\n Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports\n are expected, and help of users is invited.\n\n4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?\n\n Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend\n on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users\n guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM\n with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.\n Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU\n Emacs.\n\n If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one\n in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,\n and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.\n\n5)  What is RSA?\n\n RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means\n that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to\n decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,\n you may publish your encryption, or public key widely and keep your\n decryption, or private key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public\n key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to\n decrypt it.  (Note that the "message" sent with RSA is normally just\n the DES key to the real message. (See "What is DES?")\n\n Note that the above only provides for privacy.  For authentication,\n the fingerprint of the message (See "What is a fingerprint, like\n MD5?") is encrypted with the sender's private key.  The recipient can\n use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message\n must have come from the sender.\n\n RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who\n invented it.  To find out more about RSA, ftp to rsa.com and look in\n pub/faq/ or look in sci.crypt.\n\n6)  What is DES?\n\n DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or\n secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to\n encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.\n\n RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts\n your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the\n recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,\n allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.\n\n DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a\n key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it\n should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large\n corporation or government agency.  It is not unlikely that future\n RIPEMs will strengthen the symmetric cipher, possibly by using\n multiple encryption with DES.\n\n7)  What is PEM, and how does RIPEM relate?\n\n PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a system for allowing easy transfer of\n encrypted electronic mail.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these\n documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.\n\n RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM\n specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not\n handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.\n\n8)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys?\n\n For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know\n your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message\n received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important\n that this information be accurate; if a "bad guy" convinces her that\n his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.\n\n RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server,\n the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are\n described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution.\n None of them provide perfect security.\n\n9)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?\n\n RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS identifier describing various\n characteristics about the key, so the first bunch of characters in\n your key may be the same as those of lots of other people's keys.\n This does not mean your keys are similar, but only that they are the\n same class of key, were generated with the same program, are of the\n same length, etc.\n\n10)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?\n\n MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.\n It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,\n of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not\n possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a\n different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,\n instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key,\n only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.\n\n MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often\n used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a\n passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.\n\n MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in\n RFC 1321.\n\n11)  What is PGP?\n\n PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.\n PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently.\n PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.\n\n Some major differences between PGP and RIPEM:\n\n - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without\n   a direct network connection.\n\n - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability of\n   working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be compatible\n   with anything other than PGP (in fact, PGP 1.0 is not compatible with\n   PGP 2.0.)\n\n - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSA Data Security\n   Inc.  RSAREF comes with a license which allows noncommercial use.\n   PGP uses its own implementation of RSA which is not licensed; thus,\n   PKP, the firm holding the U.S. patents on the RSA algorithm, claims\n   that it is a infringement of that patent to make, use or sell PGP in\n   the U.S. or Canada.  In acknowledgement of this, PGP's original\n   author, Phil Zimmermann, says in the documentation:\n\n   #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency, \n   #you shouldn't actually run PGP on your computer, because Public\n   #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is\n   #contraband.  \n\n - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside\n   the U.S. and Canada.  However, PGP already exists on many ftp sites\n   in Europe and other places.\n\n Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is\n recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.\n\n Note that the above facts, both regarding patent and export\n restrictions, are somewhat controversial; many people think it\n shouldn't be that way, and some people interpret various documents\n differently.  Unfortunately, discussions of it on the net inevitably\n seem to produce more heat than light, and probably belong in\n misc.legal.computing.  (See:  "DISCLAIMER")\n\n12)  What about RPEM?\n\n RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM,\n but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in\n an attempt to avoid the patent on RSA.  It was written by Mark\n Riordan, the same author as RIPEM.\n\n Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many\n (including Rabin), Public Key Partners (PKP) claimed that their patent\n was broad enough to cover any public-key cipher whose strength rested\n in the difficulty of factoring products of large primes, not just RSA.\n This claim is not universally accepted by any means, but was not\n challenged for pragmatic reasons.\n\n RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.\n\n13)  What is MIME?\n\n MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is\n described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup\n comp.mail.mime.  How PEM should interact with MIME is not yet entirely\n clear; some people use the stopgap solution of having a MIME type\n application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM messages as MIME ones.  I\n hope some standards will emerge.  Draft Internet documents exist on\n the matter.\n\n14)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...
Thanks for posting this and making it available. This post will be LONG, I will\ncomment on most of it, and am reluctantly leaving all of the original in place\nto provide context.\n\nPlease note that an alt. group has been set up for the Clipper stuff.\n\n                                                     ^^^^^^^^^\nHum, AT&T, VLSI and Mykotronx are 'industry'?\nWonder what happened to IBM, this should be right up their street.\nAnd a mandateed scheme is voluntary? Mr Orwell would love this.\n\n                                                 ^^^^^^^^^\n\nTelephone encryption and scrambleing are years behind digital ones like RSA,\nIDEA, or even DES. The above, while literaly true, is a clasic straw-man claim\nin the context of non-real-time circuits such as E-mail and the like.\n\n\nI would modestly propose that a mandated use of ISDN would do more for commun-\nications than this lot.\n\n\nNormmaly DES.\n\n                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nNote the use of the word "business" in the above. The whole tenor of this\nrelease seems to be establishing a ground rule that only "business" use\nis legitimate for debate. If you want the nothings you drop in your wife's\near to remain secret and private, that is not even on the agenda for debate.\nNote that there is NO role for you to contain private info in this. The only\nreference is to information already in the hands of others. The 'unauthorized\nrelease' bit is also drawing a long bow. Most of these cases are by people who\nhave legitimate access abusing it, and revealing, or often selling the info.\nThese people are, of course, in this proposal, the people who will have the\nkeys.\n\nThe criminals also use lawers, courts, the CIA, white-house officials and pens\nto go about their business. When will they be outlawed as well? Yeah, several\nof them would be a better idea than CLipper!\n\nThem again, the protections of law and the courts have been seriously erroded\nover the last decade ofr so.\n\n                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nNSA\n\n\nYeah, this bit is VERY true.\n\n\nNote the repeated mixing of telephone scrabeling and encryption. A demo\nof the above claim on an ordanary POTS would be a good nights entertainment\nI suspect. Note also the 'many'. not 'all', as the general tone implies.\n\n                                ^^^^^^^^^\n                                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThe case record seems to indicate that what is needed is a brutal tightening\nof the current abuses. I have not heard, yet, of a case that was impeaded by\nthe use of secure encryption by the men in black. The other side, abuse by law\nenforcers is well documented, even by govt agencies. And the phone vs other coms\nis blurred yet again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLets run that line twice. Not **VERY** carefully what it says. The stated\npurpose of the key eschrow is to make the use of Clipper compulsory. Note the\nword "ensure". As to 'protect', or 'law-abiding', I will leave to you.\nSo to the person who asked if it included the outlawing of other encryptions,\nthe answer in this press release is, YES.\n\n\nJust as they only can wiretap now with a warrent. \n\n\nJust makes sure that the illegal ones are preserved.\n\n\nWhere do you find many experts. Any ex KGB people looking for a contract? :-)\nAnd as a later posting asks, what of the STU-IIIs they already have. It will\nbe very interesting to see if the military and US embasies start to use it.\nAfter all, it is secure, isn't it. The govt will answer that point by its own\nactions.\n\n                                                ^^^^^^^^\n\nAgain, personal use seems to be a unaskable question.\n\n                                                  ^^^^^\n\nAh, so warrents are not always needed it seems.\n\n\nThe ITARs seem to slightly impeed this.\n\n\nNote that all this wonderfull stuff will be in secret. Only the 'proper people'\nwill be able to express an opinion, hence only the desired result will emerge.\n\n\nEncryption and codes have been around for millenia. They are generaly in\nequilibrium with the technology of the time. The systematic study of cyphers\nhas resulted in a swing in favor of the encrypter, AT THE MOMENT. I have no\ndoubt that the factoring problem will fall in time. Probably fofr practical\npurposes by the middle of the next century.\n\n\nIt is a little hard to critisise a non-proposal.\n\n\nNote we drop back to 'phone-mode' again. If this is a true answer, it can be\nrephrased as " It sucks big time.

Hmmm, this gave me an interesting idea.  How about this argument:\n\n1)  Second Amendment gives us the right to keep and bear arms.\n\n2)  Strong cryptography is "arms", according to the U.S. government (that's\n    why it's so hard to export).\n\nTherefore, we have a constituitional right to strong cryptography!  \nQ.E.D.\n\nHowever, it's likely to be as hard or harder to exercise this right as it\nis getting to exercise the other rights that the government is slowly\nrestricting.  Maybe the NRA _would_ be the best existing organization?\n(Although I think a new one might be better, but perhaps would take too long\nto start up.  I would certainly join.)

Gee, I guess they should also have such a repository for house keys,\ncar keys, safety deposit keys, ... :-(\n\nrdl
The description of the chip's operation evidently leaves out some of the\nkey management aspects.  Either the K_P is the secret key corresponding\nto a public key which is broadcast at message initiation, or it is the\nresult of a Diffie-Hellman key exchange or something similar.  Either\nway there must be some protocols beyond those described here.  It isn't\nclear whether they are implemented in the Clipper wiretap chip or must\nbe provided by other system components.
Clipper might be a good way to cover the use of another layer of\nencryption.\n\nCurrently, when you send an encrypted message, an opponent can usually\ntell 1) that you are using encryption 2) which encryption method you\nare using [because that information is usually in the clear].\n\nWith clipper, most opponents will only know that you are sending\nclipper-text, they won't know that your clipper-text is itself\nencoded.\n\nOnly those few opponents who get your clipper-keys will know\nthat your message is double encrypted.\n\n... kind of like a safety deposit box containing a lock box.\n\nSo, don't just think of replacements for clipper, also think of front\nends.\n\n- Carl
How are you sure of that?  Weren't there some recent studies that\nfound corelations between not-yet announced decisions and market changes?\n\nAren't there continuing early rumors of their deliberations?\n\n\n\nSheesh!  Remember the big scandal a year or two (or 3?) ago about\nexactly such leaks?
Have you read the applicable part of the Constitution and interpreted it IN \nCONTEXT?  If not, please do so before posting this misinterpretation again.\nIt refers to the right of the people to organize a militia, not for individuals \nto carry handguns, grenades, and assault rifles.
I think I should also point out that the mystical DES engines\n	are known plaintext engines (unless you add a ton of really smart\n	hardware?)\n\nAssume the ton of smart hardware.  It doesn't really have to be that smart.
This is a very good point.  AT&T obviously knew and participated in the\ndevelopment of the Clipper chip.  This amounts to unfair business practice and\ngives AT&T an early monopoly on the market [hopefully a non-existant market].\nOther companies that compete with AT&T in the cellular market (Motorola, NEC, etc)\nhave grounds to file a complaint over this.\n\n\nIt would seem that the one fact that the government has overlooked in this\nwhole fiasco is the economic standpoint.  As others have mentioned, the most\ndifficulty the Clipper chip faces is an economic one.  Let's face it, the\naverage consumer doesn't care or know that the Clipper is a bad idea.  If\nthere is a perceived need for cellular encryption, then the companies will\nprovide one.  Most likely, a standard will emerge.  But if the Clipper is\ntoo expensive (and $25 a chip is way too much) then they will develope their\nown or buy a cheaper one.  I give SCT my full support, and hope the\nClipper chip goes the way of the Beta video tape format.\n\nAlso hope they get sued over re-using the name Clipper.\n\n-- \n ---------------------------------------Cyberspace:--------------------------

For a good discussion of cryptographically "good" random number\ngenerators, check out the draft-ietf-security-randomness-00.txt\nInternet Draft, available at your local friendly internet drafts\nrepository. \n\nA reasonably source of randomness is the output of a cryptographic\nhash function (e.g., MD5), when fed with a large amount of\nmore-or-less random data. For example, running MD5 on /dev/mem is a\nslow, but random enough, source of random bits; there are bound to be\n128 bits of entropy in the tens (or hundreds) of megabytes of data in\na modern workstation's memory, as a fair amount of them are system\ntimers, i/o buffers, etc.
> :Thousands?  Tens of thousands?  Do some arithmetic, please...  Skipjack\n   > :has 2^80 possible keys.\n   > \n   > We don't yet know if all 80 bits count.\n\n   That doesn't worry me at all; they're not going to cheat at something\n   they can get caught at.  And key size is one of the things that can be\n   verified externally.  Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the\n   chip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to the\n   output.  We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output\n   bits should vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change.\n\n   If they were out to build a weak cryptosystem, it might be the case that\n   some of the bits are much less powerful than others, in the sense that\n   they only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast,\n   DES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible; the 50% output\n   change rate appears as early as round 5.  Again, though, I don't think\n   NSA is going to cheat that crudely; they're likely to get caught.\n\nConsider a cryptosytem that starts out by XORing bits 23 and 47, and\nnot using either of these bits except through this XOR. This system\nmakes early use of every bit. but an exhaustive key search would now\nonly have 2^79 keys to search. Your test by varying single key bits\nwouldn't turn up anything interesting.\n\n   Remember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see\n   the cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES-like, a biased\n   subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb.\n\nThe algorithm I suggest above would stick out like a sore thumb, but\nI'm sure I could design a system with a more subtle key redundancy\nwhich was well-hidden, but would still make an exhaustive key search\ntake far less than 2^80 encryptions. I don't believe your claim that\nthe real keysize can be verified externally.
Archive-name: ripem/faq\nLast-update: 31 Mar 93 22:00:00 -0500\n\nABOUT THIS POSTING\n------------------\nThis is a listing of likely questions and information about RIPEM, a\nprogram for public key mail encryption.  It (this FAQ, not RIPEM) was\nwritten and will be maintained by Marc VanHeyningen\n<mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu>.  It will be posted to a variety of\nnewsgroups on a monthly basis; follow-up discussion specific to RIPEM\nis redirected to the group alt.security.ripem.\n\nWHAT'S NEW\n----------\nI am now running a World Wide Web archive of RIPEM information.  It\ndoes not contain much of anything that isn't available elsewhere, but\nit has convenient pointers to the most current version of this FAQ and\nsome other stuff.  The URL is "http://cs.indiana.edu/ripem/dir.html".\n\nThis month's version has a fair amount of new pointers to information\non patents and stuff like that.  I've also reordered a few things to\nhave a more sensible ordering.  I hope I don't have to edit this again\nsoon. :-)\n\nDISCLAIMER\n----------\nNothing in this FAQ should be considered legal advice, or anything\nother than one layperson's opinion.  If you want real legal advice,\ntalk to a real lawyer, preferably one with experience in patent law,\nexport regulations, or whatever area of law is in question.\n\nLIST OF QUESTIONS\n-----------------\n1)  What is RIPEM?\n2)  How can I get RIPEM?\n3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?\n4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?\n5)  What is RSA?\n6)  What is DES?\n7)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?\n8)  What is PEM?\n9)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys?\n10)  Isn't it a bad idea to use patented algorithms in standards like PEM?\n11)  What about RSADSI/PKP?\n12)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?\n13)  What is PGP?\n14)  What about RPEM?\n15)  What is MIME?\n16)  What is TIS/PEM?\n17)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...\n\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\n---------------------\n\n1)  What is RIPEM?\n\n RIPEM is a (not yet complete, but useful) implementation of Privacy\n Enhanced Mail (PEM).  RIPEM allows your electronic mail to have the\n four security facilities provided by PEM: disclosure protection\n (optional), originator authenticity, message integrity measures, and\n non-repudiation of origin (always).  (See: "What is PEM?")\n\n RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>.\n Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,\n which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.\n\n The current version of RIPEM is 1.0.5; the current version of the\n Macintosh port of RIPEM is 0.7.\n\n2)  How can I get RIPEM?\n\n RIPEM uses the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is\n considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution\n to persons who are not citizens or permanent residents in the U.S or\n Canada without an export license.  No such license has been obtained\n (nor would one likely be granted unless the RSA key exchange were\n shortened to 512 bits and the symmetric cipher changed to something\n weaker than DES.  There are some suggestions that this situation may\n change now that Clinton is in office.)  The author requests in the\n README file that this law not be violated:\n\n #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution\n #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,\n #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.\n\n Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is\n included with the distribution.  You should read it before using\n RIPEM.\n\n RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent\n residents in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README\n file for info.  Note that the non-RSAREF portion of RIPEM is not a\n product of RSA Data Security, Incorporated; they merely are helping\n distribute it.\n\n RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its "home site" on\n ripem.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the\n U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out\n how to obtain access, FTP there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file\n GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are\n available here in addition to the full source tree.\n\n3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?\n\n Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of\n Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to\n Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice\n Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports\n are expected, and help of users is invited.\n\n4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?\n\n Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend\n on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users\n guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM\n with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.\n Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU\n Emacs.\n\n If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one\n in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,\n and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.\n\n5)  What is RSA?\n\n RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means\n that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to\n decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,\n you may publish your encryption, or public, key widely and keep your\n decryption, or private, key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public\n key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to\n decrypt it.  Note that the "message" sent with RSA is normally just\n the DES key to the real plaintext. (See "What is DES?")\n\n Note that the above only provides for disclosure protection.  For\n originator authenticity, message integrity, and non-repudiation of\n origin services to be implemented, the fingerprint of the message\n (See "What is a fingerprint, like MD5?") is encrypted with the\n sender's private key.  The recipient, or a dispute-resolving\n authority, can use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm\n that the message must have come from the sender and was not altered.\n\n RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who\n invented it.  To find out lots more about RSA and modern cryptography\n in general, ftp to rsa.com and look in pub/faq/.  Some information\n also may be in sci.crypt.\n\n6)  What is DES?\n\n DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or\n secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to\n encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.\n\n RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts\n your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the\n recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,\n allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.\n\n DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a\n key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it\n should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large\n corporation or government agency.  It is not likely that the PEM\n standard will incorporate support for other symmetric ciphers in the\n near future, because there is a strong feeling that PEM should be\n stable so it can become utilized widely without early problems with\n interoperability.\n\n7)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?\n\n MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.\n It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,\n of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not\n possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a\n different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,\n instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key,\n only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.\n\n MD5s can also be exchanged directly for authentication; for example,\n RIPEM public keys include an MD5 of the public key in the file, so\n parties wishing to confirm their keys are authentic via a separate\n channel merely need exchange MD5s of keys and verify their accuracy.\n\n MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often\n used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a\n passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.\n\n MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in\n RFC 1321.\n\n There have been some recent suggestions that MD5 may not be as strong\n a hash as was originally believed; presumably some other hash\n function will be used if this is accepted as true.\n\n8)  What is PEM?\n\n PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a standard for allowing transfer of\n encrypted electronic mail generated over a long period of time by a\n working group of experts.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these\n documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.\n\n RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM\n specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not\n handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.\n\n9)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys?\n\n For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know\n your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message\n received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important\n that this information be accurate; if a "bad guy" convinces her that\n his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.\n\n RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server,\n the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are\n described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution.\n None of them provide perfect security.  The PEM standard calls for\n key management by certificates; the addition of this feature to RIPEM\n is planned, but chicken-egg issues still exist.\n\n10)  Isn't it a bad idea to use patented algorithms in standards like PEM?\n\n This issue has been considered in the standards process.  RFC 1310,\n the specification for Internet standards, has a discussion (section\n 6) on what specifications for nondiscriminatory availability must be\n met for a patented method to be included in a standard.  RFC 1421\n addresses this issue with regard to the patents covering public-key\n cryptography.\n\n This does not, of course, mean that all questions are settled or that\n everyone is in agreement.  An interesting exchange on the use of\n patented algorithms in standards with regard to public-key\n cryptography is in the League for Programming Freedom archive\n (available via FTP: ftp.uu.net:/doc/lpf) in the files bidzos.letter\n and bidzos.response.  (Amusingly, the LPF files on ftp.uu.net are\n compressed with a patented algorithm.)\n\n11)  What about RSADSI/PKP?\n\n RSA Data Security, Inc. (RSADSI) is a California-based company\n specializing in cryptographic technologies.  Public Key Partners is a\n firm which holds exclusive sub-licensing rights of the following U.S.\n patents and all of their corresponding foreign patents:\n\n      Cryptographic Apparatus and Method\n      ("Diffie-Hellman")............................... No. 4,200,770\n\n      Public Key Cryptographic Apparatus\n      and Method ("Hellman-Merkle").................... No. 4,218,582\n\n      Cryptographic Communications System and\n      Method ("RSA")................................... No. 4,405,829\n\n      Exponential Cryptographic Apparatus\n      and Method ("Hellman-Pohlig").................... No. 4,424,414\n\n PKP claims these four patents cover all known methods of public key\n cryptography.  The two businesses are rather closely related (for\n example, the same person, Jim Bidzos, is president of both of them.)\n PKP has licensed this technology to a considerable number of\n companies (IBM, DEC, Motorola, AT&T, Lotus...) for use in their\n products.  PKP has also threatened and filed lawsuits defending their\n patents.\n\n RIPEM was originally created with no connection to RSADSI other than\n its use of the RSAREF library, and for no reason other than its\n author's desire to see widespread use of public-key cryptography.\n However, after the ball started rolling, people at RSADSI got\n interested.  RSADSI decided to carry RIPEM on its FTP site, and some\n people there started making their own RIPEM keys and contributing\n code.  RIPEM even won the "Best Application Built on RSAREF in 1992"\n award.\n\n12)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?\n\n RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS (Public-Key Cryptography\n Standards) identifier describing various characteristics about the\n key, so the first bunch of characters in your key may be the same as\n those of lots of other people's keys.  This does not mean your keys\n are similar, but only that they are the same class of key, were\n generated with the same program, are of the same length, etc.\n\n13)  What is PGP?\n\n PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.\n PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently.\n PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.\n\n A few major differences between PGP and RIPEM:\n\n - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without\n   a direct network connection.\n\n - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability\n   of working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be\n   compatible with anything other than itself.\n\n - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSADSI which\n   comes with a license allowing noncommercial use.  PGP uses its own\n   implementation of RSA.  PKP claims that it is a violation of its\n   patents to "make, use or sell" PGP in the U.S. or Canada without\n   either a license or written permission.  (See: "DISCLAIMER")\n   (See: "What about RSADSI/PKP?")  Phil Zimmermann, the author of\n   PGP, stopped distributing it after being threatened with legal\n   action; he believed that a licensing scheme could be arranged, but\n   it hasn't happened and there seems little prospect of it happening\n   in the future.  He acknowledges in the PGP User's Guide:\n\n   #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency, \n   #you shouldn't actually run PGP on your computer, because Public\n   #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is\n   #contraband.\n\n - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside\n   the U.S. and Canada without an export license.  However, PGP\n   already exists on many ftp sites in Europe and other places.\n\n Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is\n recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.\n Unfortunately, it's not distributed separately from the program,\n which can be difficult to find in the U.S. on FTP sites due to\n liability concerns.\n\n14)  What about RPEM?\n\n RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM,\n but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in\n an attempt to avoid the patents on public-key systems.  It was\n written by Mark Riordan, who later wrote RIPEM.\n\n Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many\n (including Rabin), PKP claimed that their patents were broad enough\n to cover the cipher employed.  This claim is not universally\n accepted, but was not challenged for pragmatic reasons.\n\n RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.\n\n15)  What is MIME?\n\n MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is\n described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup\n comp.mail.mime; a FAQ exists on it.  How PEM should interact with\n MIME is not yet entirely clear; some people use the stopgap solution\n of having a MIME type application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM\n messages as MIME ones.  I hope some standards will emerge.  Draft\n Internet documents exist on the matter.\n\n16)  What is TIS/PEM?\n\n Trusted Information Systems is working on a version of Privacy\n Enhanced Mail for general availability.  Last I heard, it was\n rumored to be integrated into an existing mail user agent (MH)\n rather than a stand-alone system, and in beta test.  I don't know\n much more than that.\n\n17)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...
This announcement is somewhat disconcerting; it doesn't do anything\nevil in and of itself, but bodes badly for the future of open\nalgorithms and standards in information security.  I won't start\npanicking until/unless DES or RSA or stuff like that is prohibited, but\nI'm a little anxious.  (No doubt it won't be long before someone posts\nexplaining how this just a small part of some far-ranging and\nlong-lived NSA-PKP-IRS-FBI-CIA-HandgunControlInc-Clinton conspiracy to\nsubvert freedom, democracy, and mathematics.)  My feeling is that the\nadministration probably isn't that worried about things like DES and\nRSA and PGP and RIPEM, since they'll never be used by a group much\nwider than us computer geeks.\n\nThe fact that this just came out now suggests one of two things:\n\n1.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, and it only just\n    now happened to be ``ready'' to release to the world at this time.\n\n2.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, but wasn't able\n    to get the Bush administration to go along with this plan.  (I\n    find it unlikely that this would have been because of a sympathy\n    for the unescrowed use of cryptography; more likely the\n    administration felt that even escrowed, secret-algorithm and, for\n    all we know, trivially breakable cryptography should not be made\n    widely available.)\n\nThus said clipper@csrc.ncsl.nist.gov (Clipper Chip Announcement):\n\nThe majority of the discussion involving this "Clipper Chip" seems to\npertain to the encryption of telephone conversations.  Does anyone\nknow if that means this chip is designed to work primarily with analog\nsignals?  The language sort of suggests this, but it's hard to say.\n\nThe main thing I just don't get is whether this chip implements\nsymmetric or asymmetric cryptographic techniques.  Anybody know?\n\nI'm guessing symmetric, but they don't get very clear about it.  If it\nis symmetric, how is it useful for anything other than link-level\nencryption with an identical chip at each end?  How can you negotiate\na per-session key using symmetric cryptography without using a trusted\nthird party who knows your key?  (Or does it even use a per-session\nkey?)\n\nIf it's asymmetric, what about PKP's patents, which they claim cover\nall methods of doing asymmetric cryptography?  Are they getting\nroyalties, or is hiding infringement the real reason for keeping the\nalgorithm secret? :-)

A Unix tool of cryptographic significance is available\nfor anonymous ftp.\n\n"agrep 2.0.4" -- a fast approximate pattern-matching tool\n\nsource code project available from:\n\ncs.arizona.edu \n\nin directory "agrep"\n\nagrep is a very fast fuzzy search tool with a tremendous\nnumber of powerful search options.  The one most obviously\napplicable to cryptography (key selection) is to be able to\nspecify the "similarity" of matches in the data.\n\nFor example say you make up a password/phrase of "qimwe7l".\nOf course you rightly suspect that this key itself is not\nin any dictionary or word list.  But how *close* is it to\nen entry that could be varied by some "crack" program to\nbrute-force search for it?\n\nYou use agrep to find out.  Looking with argument for none,\none or two errors, no matches.  Good so far.  But \n\nagrep -3 "qimwe7l" bigwordandphraselist\n\nfinds that the pattern "qimwe7l" is too close to the\npattern "imsel" (part of "himself" and a host of others),\nto be of any cryptographic value as a key.\n\nAn error of level two corresponds to a simple transposition of\nletters like "teh" for "the".  A minimally acceptable password\nwould have to pass as *least* level 3 in order not immediately\nruled-out as even a remote possibility of being a good password.\n(In real cryptographic use, my personal passphrases clear at\n*least* level 8 on my rather large [>80 meg] word and phrase lists.)\n\n\nAnd for searching for key words in human-typed data (lots o'\ntypos) the tool is unexcelled.  For example, For example,\nsay I want to find out what people think about Gibson's\nSF book "Neuromancer" in the huge SF-Lover's archives.\nEven with an error distance specification as small as\nof "1" I will find all those people who think the title\nwas "Necromancer" or other common typos.  Why miss anything?\n\nAlso, the program can look for up to 30,000 patterns IN PARALLEL\nat Boyer-Moore (sublinear) speeds.  Great for a NSA wannabe\nto look for your name, terrorists names, special Tagalog or\nreligious words, etc. in the news or e-mail spool directories.\n\nYou can even search for ciphertext by using, say, 30,000\nrandom three-byte combinations and eliminate all texts that\ndon't score the X chi-square 'birthday' hits on message size Y.\n\nYou think some crypto-terrorist is try to foil you by changing\nthe pattern on you?  No problem.  Try agrep -p NSA to find\nNSA, National Security Agency, NSecAg, No Such Agency,\nNational Scrabble Association, N*S*A, etc.\n\nYou can also specify "fixed" areas: looking for license\nplate XYZ123 when you know that the letters are correct,\nyou might say:\n\nagrep -2 <XYZ>123 licenseplatedatabase\n\nwill find all plates starting with XYZ with up to two errors\n(addition, substitution, deletion) in the number area.  You can\nalso "weight" the relative "cost" for substiutions, additions,\nor deletion errors.  For example, when searching DNA patterns\nfor a particular protein combination, you might know that\nsome kinds of damage cause the "A" nucelotide to drop out more\nthan other errors... you could adjust for this bias by setting\n-Dc where you set the "deletion cost" to count as "c" errors.\n\nA steganographic use (I even used "agrep -2 "<steg>eograp" E"\njust now to find the correct spelling!) would be to intentionally\nintroduce errors of a certain type and magnitude into a plaintext\nand then later recover the orginal it via an agrep pipe.  Lots of\npossibilities here when only outlaws can have ciphertext...\n\nAlso with agrep's powerful extraction options it makes it easy\nto abstract the "hits" into a useful form.  For example,\n\nagrep -d "^From" 'PGP;(passphrase|Zimmerman|NSA)'\n\nsays output the entire mail record, delimited by 'From'\nthat contains 'PGP' and contains either 'passphrase',\n'Zimmerman', or 'NSA'.\n\nAnd agrep has been measured an order-of-magnitude faster\nthan the second-best similarity tool publicly available.\n\nAs usual, I will be glad to e-mail the source and docs\nto those who reqest them by e-mail IF they cannot do\nan anonymous FTP.\n\nGet this now.\nIt is too powerful to stay in the hands of the NSA.\n\n\nGrady Ward, vendor to the NSA (and proud of it)

I recently published a new privacy-protecting off-line electronic cash\nsystem as a technical report at CWI. Being a PhD-student at David\nChaum's cryptography-group, our group has a long history in research\nin the field of privacy-protecting cash systems.\n\nThe report is called CS-R9323.ps.Z, contains 77 pages, and can be\nretrieved from\n\nftp.cwi.nl   (192.16.184.180)\n\nfrom the directory pub/CWIreports/AA.\nThe postscript-file is suitable for 300dpi laserprinters.\n\n====================================================================\nABSTRACT (from coverpage): We present a new off-line electronic cash\nsystem based on a problem, called the representation problem, of which\nlittle use has been made in literature thus far. Our system is the\nfirst to be based entirely on discrete logarithms.  Using the\nrepresentation problem as a basic concept, some techniques are\nintroduced that enable us to construct protocols for withdrawal and\npayment that do not use the cut and choose methodology of earlier\nsystems. As a consequence, our cash system is much more efficient in\nboth computation and communication complexity than any such system\nproposed previously.\n  \nAnother important aspect of our system concerns its provability.\nContrary to previously proposed systems, its correctness can be\nmathematically proven to a very great extent. Specifically, if we\nmake one plausible assumption concerning a single hash-function, the\nability to break the system seems to imply that one can break the\nDiffie-Hellman problem. \n  \nOur system offers a number of extensions that are hard to achieve in\npreviously known systems. In our opinion the most interesting of these\nis that the entire cash system (including all the extensions) can be\nincorporated in a setting based on wallets with observers, which has\nthe important advantage that double-spending can be prevented in the\nfirst place, rather than detecting the identity of a double-spender\nafter the fact. In particular, it can be incorporated even under the\nmost stringent requirements conceivable about the privacy of the user,\nwhich seems to be impossible to do with previously proposed systems.\nAnother benefit of our system is that framing attempts by a bank have\nnegligible probability of success (independent of computing power) by\na simple mechanism from within the system, which is something that\nprevious solutions lack entirely. Furthermore, the basic cash system\ncan be extended to checks, multi-show cash and divisibility, while\nretaining its computational efficiency.\n====================================================================\n\nCryptographers are challenged to try to break this system!  \n\nI made a particular effort to keep the report as self-contained as\npossible.  Nevertheless, if you have any questions, please e-mail to\nme and I will try to reply as good as I can. Any comments are also\nwelcome!\n\nStefan Brands,

The problem with "Let's assume" reasoning is that, taken to the extreme\n(and you're close), you arrive at "Let's assume this is perfectly OK."\n\nThe assumptions you make are big ones. If the system is really secure, then\nwhy does the government have to keep the algorithm secret?  There are plenty\nof encryption algorithms that don't depend upon nondisclosure to be secure,\nso why in the world use one that does?  There are reasons, of course, but\nI certainly can't think of any honest ones.\n\nNext, you assume we can "trust" the escrow houses. But the last time I checked,\nEVERY SINGLE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT has experienced unauthorized disclosure,\ncorruption, and even fabrication, of supposedly secure data. The govt is\nsaying "Yeah, but NOW we're serious, so you can trust us."  Bullcrypt. \n\nAnd finally, although you didn't state it explicitly, you implicitly assume\nthat the warrant mechanism in this country is safe and reasonable. The case\nin Ventura County of a man shot and killed by officers serving a deliberately\nfraudulant warrant tells me that the govt has a long ways to go on this\nscore.\n\nRemember that all this is to catch the drug dealers, right?  As others\nhave pointed out, the current proposal will, if deployed, render truly secure\nencryption much more expensive and inconvenient than Uncle Sam's brand.\nWho will be able to afford, and be sufficiently motivated, to purchase this\nexpensive, inconvenient higher protection?  Somebody with lots of extra\ncash...\n\nThe following is more true than ever:\n\n  "When [strong] encryption is outlawed, only outlaws will have [strong]\nencryption."
[...]\n[...]\n\nSo what? Justices William Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, John Paul\nStevens, and Byron White are associated with a plurality Supreme Court\ndecision that prevented the removal of "anti-American, anti-Christian,\nanti-Semitic, and just plain filthy" books from a public high school\nlibrary [_Board of Education v. Pico_ (1982)]. Does this mean that\nthey could no longer defend free expression and privacy?\n\n- Carl
I received the following two notes from Martin Hellman with details\non how Clipper will work.  They are posted with his permission.  The\nimplications of some details are fascinating.\n\n-------\nDate: Sat, 17 Apr 93 23:05:23 PDT\nFrom: "Martin Hellman" <hellman@isl.stanford.edu>\nTo: (a long list of recipients)\nSubject: Clipper Chip\n\n\nMost of you have seen the announcement in Friday's NY Times,\netc. about NIST (National Institute of Standards & Technology)\nannouncing the "Clipper Chip" crypto device. Several messges\non the net have asked for more technical details, and some have\nbeen laboring under understandable misunderstandings given\nthe lack of details in the news  articles. So here to help out\nis your friendly NSA link: me. I was somewhat surprised Friday\nto get a call from the Agency which supplied many of the missing\ndetails. I was told the info was public, so here it is (the cc of this\nto Dennis Branstad at NIST is mostly as a double check on my\nfacts since I assume he is aware of all this; please let me know\nif I have anything wrong):\n\nThe Clipper Chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in \nSilicon. Each chip will have two secret, 80-bit keys. One will be the \nsame for all chips (ie a system-wide key) and the other will be unit \nspecific. I don't know what NIST and NSA will call them, but I will \ncall them the system key SK and unit key UK in this message. \nThe IC will be designed to be extremely difficult to reverse so \nthat the system key can be kept secret. (Aside: It is clear that \nthey also want to keep the algorithm secret and, in my opinion, \nit may be as much for that as this stated purpose.) The unit key \nwill be generated as the XOR of two 80-bit random numbers K1 \nand K2 (UK=K1+K2) which will be kept by the two escrow \nauthorities. Who these escrow authorities will be is still to be \ndecided by the Attorney General, but it was stressed to me that \nthey will NOT be NSA or law enforcement agencies, that they \nmust be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased. \nWhen a law enforcement agency gets a court order, they will \npresent it to these two escrow authorities and receive K1 and \nK2, thereby allowing access to the unit key UK.\n\nIn addition to the system key, each user will get to choose his \nor her own key and change it as often as desired. Call this key \nplain old K. When a message is to be sent it will first be \nencrypted under K, then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK, \nand the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part \nmessage which will then be encrypted under the system key SK \nproducing\n\n     E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}\n\nWhen a court order obtains K1 and K2, and thence K, the law \nenforcement agency will use SK to decrypt all information \nflowing on the suspected link [Aside: It is my guess that \nthey may do this constantly on all links, with or without a \ncourt order, since it is almost impossible to tell which links \nover which a message will flow.] This gives the agency access to \n\n     E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number\n\nin the above message. They then check the serial number \nof the unit and see if it is on the "watch list" for which they \nhave a court order. If so, they will decrypt E[K; UK] to obtain K, \nand then decrypt E[M; K] to obtain M.\n\nI am still in the process of assessing this scheme, so please do \nnot take the above as any kind of endorsement of the proposed \nscheme. All I am trying to do is help all of us assess the scheme \nmore knowledgably. But I will say that the need for just one court \norder worries me. I would feel more comfortable (though not \nnecessarily comfortable!) if two separate court orders were \nneeded, one per escrow authority. While no explanation is\nneeded, the following story adds some color: In researching\nsome ideas that Silvio Micali and I have been kicking around,\nI spoke with Gerald Gunther, the constitutional law expert\nhere at Stanford and he related the following story: When\nEdward Levi became Pres. Ford's attorney general (right\nafter Watergate), he was visited by an FBI agent asking\nfor "the wiretap authorizations." When Levy asked for\nthe details so he could review the cases as required by\nlaw, the agent told him that his predecessors just turned\nover 40-50 blank, signed forms every time. Levi did not\ncomply and changed the system, but the lesson is clear: \nNo single person or authority should have the power to\nauthorize wiretaps (or worse yet, divulging of personal\nkeys). Sometimes he or she will be an Edward Levi\nand sometimes a John Mitchell.\n\nMartin Hellman\n\n----\n\nDate: Sun, 18 Apr 93 11:41:42 PDT\nFrom: "Martin Hellman" <hellman@isl.stanford.edu>\nTo: smb@research.att.com\nSubject: Re: Clipper Chip\n\nIt is fine to post my previous message to sci.crypt \nif you also post this message with it in which:\n\n1. I ask recipients to be sparse in their requesting further info \nfrom me or asking for comments on specific questions. By\nthis posting I apologize for any messages I am unable to\nrespond to. (I already spend too much time answering too much\ne-mail and am particularly overloaded this week with other\nresponsibilities.)
And if Richard Nixon had had this kind of toy, he wouldn't have had\nto send people into the Watergate.\n\nBut that's not really the issue.  The real issue is whether this \nwill be used to justify a ban against individuals' use of private \n(i.e., anything else) encryption methods.\n\nUnrelated question...isn't the term "Clipper," as neat as it is,\nalready taken by Intergraph?
What is the expected run time (+/- a factor of 10) on a 486DX/50\nusing the best known algorithm for finding the shortest path\nsolution for Rubicks Cube from a randomly chosen position?\n\nI have read the FAQ and followed the recent discussion on Rubicks\nCube but I don't believe this question has been answered.  Notice\nthat I am specifically looking for an algorithm that finds the \nSHORTEST path, not just any solution.\n\nIt seems to me that the underlying assumption is that such a program\nwould need to do a brute force search though 10^20 positions.  That\nseems an unreasonably pessimistic assumption to me and I want to \nknow if someone has significantly improved on that.\n\nI have some ideas of my own on how to approach this problem, but\nbefore I spend to much time developing them I wanted to know if\nsomeone else has already done the work.\n\nADMINISTRIVIA:  I have posted this to three groups and attempted\nto set the followup to rec.puzzles which seems to me to be the\nplace to continue this discussion.  I will cross post a summary\nwhen and if it becomes appropriate.  Email replies gladly accepted.
This may be a stupid question, but how does the government know which keys\nto ask for?\n\nWill owners be required to REGISTER their phones, faxes, modems, etc.,\nand inform the government when they are moved to a different phone number?\nWill there be penalities if the public does not do this?  Will identification\n(the National Health Care ID, perhaps) be required when purchasing a\nClipper-equipted phone?\n\nOr will each chip transmit identifying information at the start of\na conversation?  Identification which could be used to automatically\nlog who calls whom?  (The _phone_ company keeps records, but this \ninformation would be accessable by a well-placed van near a microwave\nrelay station).\n\nThis raises the question of how the two phones agree on a communications\nencryption key.  Will it be something that is derived from information\nexchanged at the start of the conversation -- and hence derivable by\nan eavesdropper?
And this means that the FBI will want to track the customer lists of\n	better encryption phones, because "the only reason a person would want\n	one is to evade the police."\n\nThey don't have to track customer lists - they merely have to digitally\nlisten to any phone line and eliminate any that don't have the clipper\nheader/signature.  (No-one has said how it will be modulated - want a bet\nit's a non-standard and hence easily recognisable baudrate?)\n\nDevices to scan exchanges and detect modems etc already exist.  I've seen\nthem advertised in the trade press.\n\nOnce you eliminate crippled crypto devices and ordinary data modems, what's\nleft is crypto worth looking more closely at.  I guess any substitute scheme\nwill have to be v32bis or v.fast to disguise it, though then they just start\nlooking at the data too...\n\nWhatever happens though, the effect of this new chip will be to make private\ncrypto stand out like a sore thumb.
And some people thought that I am exaggerating when claiming that the\nCripple Chip is just a first step in a totalitarian plot against the\ncivil liberties in the USA... It seems that I've even been an optimist\n- the things are happening even faster than I expected.... That's\nanother of the dirty tricks they used to apply on us under the\ncommunist regime - do something secret, THEN tell the people about is\n(after the fact, when nothing can be done any more), and of course,\nexplaining them how much better the situation is now...\n\nIn my previous messages I wrote that the Americans should wake up and\nfight against the new proposal. Now it seems to me that it is already\ntoo late - it has already happened, the civil liberties have been\nviolated, no, stollen from the American people, while the most part of\nthis people has been sleeping happily... :-((( Too sad...\n\nRegards,\nVesselin
Hmmm.  "Check your facts."  Good advice.  Let's check Mr. Cain's\nfacts a bit, shall we?\n\n\n\nFACT:  It is unlawful to distribute code implementing RSA without a license\nto do so from PKP, whether or not one is charging for it.  Furthermore,\nany use of RSA, other than for research purposes allowed under US patent\nlaw, is similarly unlawful.  Therefore, the "average citizen" cannot use\nRSA to encrypt message traffic in the US without a license from PKP.\n\nThere is no licensed, freely available product in the US that uses RSA\nencryption other than RSAREF (and hence RIPEM), at least as far as I am\naware.  If you know of another, please post it here.\n\n\nFACT:  The last contact I had with RSA Data Security, Inc was with some\nguy trying to sell me a license (unsolicited, I might add) for TIPEM.\nCost: $15K plus 2-5 percent royalties.\n\nI suppose it is a matter of opinion as to whether or not these terms count\nas "mucho bucks" or "incredibly reasonable."  Either way, however, this\ndefinitely falls into the "routines *they* tell you to (use)".\n\n\nFACT:  There are no restrictions (yet!) on the use of cryptography under\nUS law, although this is beginning to look like it will change.  The only\nimpediments to widespread use of RSA cryptography in the US are PKP's\npatents.\n\n	Mr. Cain, please shut up until you get your facts straight.\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n	"Better than the whole world be destroyed and crumble to dust than\na free man deny one of his desires."\n		-Benito Mussolini, Italian anarchist and poet.

Use to Government standard option for more careful\noverwriting...\n\nRegards,\nVesselin
I totally agree.  But how do you propose we take government back?  They\nobviously don't listen to the people or want the people to know who is\nresponsibile for what (a person telnetted the site of the Clipper chip\nrelease, to see what the entity 'clipper' was, and got a few lists.\nBUt when another person tried a bit later, the commands were disabled)\nDoes not sound like an Administration that wants to have any accountability\nor information they don't control given to the people.  The secret\ndevelopment and implimentation of the Clipper Chip decision further\nbacks that up.  You can bet unaurhorized encryption methods and software\nwill be considered 'terrorist tools' and also subject to civil forfeiture,\nalong with the systems that are running it.  YOU WATCH, SEE IF I AM WRONG.\n\nThe government is not going to be very cooperative about the people taking\nit back.  And they have all the resources, unlimited access to the media\nfor propeganda, and almost all the guns (soon to be ALL the guns if\nClinton's agenda succeeds)...   Those that do not play ball?  Waco\nmight be a good example of what to expect...  The warrant (just released)\nstated the reason for the raid was the BDs spent a very large sum\nfor weapons, over an undetermined amount of time.  I don't recall\nspending a lot of money on guns, etc being illegal ... yet, that is.\n\nClinton might go down in history as the worst thing to ever happen to\nthe US of A. ...

It would be in a different location, so a directional antenna could\nprobably lock in on just the one monitor. Failing that, a phased array\ncould likely seperate the signals. Admittedly, this is expensive, but\nso is all the rest of this stuff anyway.\n\n--\nPerry Metzger		pmetzger@shearson.com
dwight tuinstra posts a very interesting message in which he comments on the\neffects of the Clipper chip on state and local police. Actually, reading\nbetween the lines, it could be a very good thing for civil liberties in one\nrespect, since it will at least prevent cowboy cops and cowboy state and\nlocal agancies from reading your traffic if they tap it illegally.\n\nThere has been extensive discussion in the eff forum, for example, about\ninadmissible taps being used to develop information that could then lead to\nadmissible evidence.  This might put a stop to such things, which must from\ntime to time be simple fishing expeditions.\n\nDavid
Agreed.  Remember, I don't even think of Clipper as encryption in any real \nsense--if I did, I'd probably be a lot more annoyed about it.\n\n\nThat's not for Clinton (or anyone under him) to say, though.  Only the \nfederal and supreme courts can say anything about the constitutionality.\nAnything the administration or any governmental agency says is opinion at \nbest.
Just doing a quick reality check here - is this for real or did someone\ninvent it to provoke a reaction from people?  It sounds more like the\nsort of thing you'd have heard, suitably rephrased, from the leader of a \ncertain German political party in the 1930's....
Read this through once or twice.  Then replace "prince" with\n"government" or "president", as appropriate, and read it again.  \n\n[From Chapter XX of _The Prince_, by N. Macchiavelli, as translated by\nDaniel Donno.]\n\n	In order to keep their lands secure, some princes have\ndisarmed their subjects; others have prompted division within the\ncities they have subjugated.  Some have nurtured animosities against\nthemselves; others have sought to win the approval of those they\ninitially distrusted.  Some have erected fortresses; others have\ndestroyed them.  Now, although it is impossible to set down definite\njudgements on all of these measures without considering the particular\ncircumstances of the states where they may be employed, I shall\nnevertheless discuss them in such broad terms as the subject itself\nwill allow.\n\n	To begin with, there has never been a case of a new prince\ndisarming his subjects.  Indeed, whenever he found them disarmed, he\nproceeded to arm them.  For by arming your subjects, you make their\narms your own.  Those among them who are suspicious become loyal,\nwhile those who are already loyal remain so, and from subjects they\nare transformed into partisans.  Though you cannot arm them all,\nnonetheless you increase your safety among those you leave unarmed by\nextending privileges to those you arm.  Your different treatment of\nthe two categories will make the latter feel obligated to you, while\nthe former will consider it proper thoat those who assume added duties\nand dangers should receive advantages.  \n\n	When you disarm your subjects, however, you offend them, by\nshowing that, either from cowardliness or from lack of faith, you\ndistrust them; and either conclusion will induce them to hate you.\nMoreover, since it is impossible for you to remain unarmed, you would\nhave to resort to mercenaries, whose limitations have already been\ndiscussed. Even if such troops were good, however, they could never be\ngood enough to defend you from powerful enemies, and doubtful\nsubjects.  Therefore, as I have said, a new prince in a newly acquired\nstate has always taken measures to arm his subjects, and history is\nfull of examples proving that this is so.\n\n	But when a prince takes posession of a new state which he\nannexes as an addition to his original domain, then he must disarm all\nthe subjects of the new state except those who helped him to acquire\nit; and these, as time and occasion permit, he must seek to render\nsoft and weak.  He must arrange matters in such a way that the arms of\nthe entire state will be in the hands of soldiers who are native to\nhis original domain.\n\n	...
May as well look at one piece of this at a time.  This paragraph:\n\n\nmeans they aren't planning to make it public, as was done with DES.  As it\nsays in both sci.crypt FAQs, there's no way we are going to achieve the\nsame level of comfort with Clipper that we finally have with DES if we\ncan't actually get our hands on the bits and watch them flow around.  Even\nthe best experts aren't going to think of everything: look how long it\ntook Biham and Shamir to get a handle on just how good DES is... and for\nall we know there's still more to learn.
Don't get fooled by exponents 2^80 (possible keys) is not in the\nsame league with 10^80 (particles in the universe).  2^80 < 10^25.\nRemember Avagadro's number?  There are about that many elementary\nparticles (not molecules) in one mole.  Pretty small universe!  Or if\nyou can put 5 Gigabytes on one tape, you would need about 10 trillion\ntapes (allowing several bytes per entry).  Still more than all of the\nexisting magnetic media on the planet, but wait a few years.  (I'm\nincluding existing audio and video cassettes in the total.  Ten\ntrillion is about 2,000 per person worldwide...  Gives new meaning to\nthe suspicions of hiden messages.)\n\n--\n\n					Robert I. Eachus
So in a few years there could be millions of these chips in the USA, all\nnetworked together? Sounds like a good science fiction story - the government\nwants to crack foreign DES (or whatever) messages, so they con the public into\nindividually buying all of the components and installing them. Soon the US\ncould be covered by the largest parallel computer in the world, built on top of\nour current phone net.
As far as I know ISDN (call it Swissnet here, and it's being plugged in) it's\n8 bit 8000Hz (gives you one channel of 64kBit/sec) I guess you should not go\nbelow a sampling rate of 6000 Hz if you want to have same quality as on an\nanalog-line. Anybody knows compression-algorithms & -factors for voice ?\n\nGreetings,\n\n	Germano Caronni
: There are chips which perform the voice compression/expansion.  They can't\n: be expensive, because they exist in many phones connected to PBXs or on the\n: PBX line cards, as well as in a lot of equipment which compresses\n: voice-grade circuits to save the cost of long-distance, leased T1s or\n: satellite circuits.\n\n: I can't remember the generic term for these chips.  My impression is that\n: this was a big deal 10 years ago, but circuits have gotten so cheap that\n: it isn't done much now.\n\nCodecs.  They have to get about 6:1 compression on 8 bit samples to squeeze\nthem down v32bis.  I played around with the lossless 'shorten' program\nlast night, but it only managed 2.5:1.  I've got some specimen CELP code\nbut it's not obvious that it runs in real time; I think it's just proof-of-\nconcept code, and I have some mucking about with file formats to do before\nI can put my own sample through it.\n\nLooks like the current option is to use a voice-mail modem with built-in\nDSP chip to do this in hardware.  That means two modems for a system,\nputting the cost at $600 upwards.  Ouch.  Maybe soon we'll be able to\ndo it in software on high-powered games consoles - isn't the 3DO an\nAcorn RISC machine inside?  That cpu runs like shit off a shovel... and\nwill be nicely mass-market too.
What are the typical sizes for keys for commercial secret key algorithms?\nI know DES is 56 bits ("tripple DES" is 112 bits) and IDEA is 128 bits.  Is\nthere anything made in the US that has 128 bit keys?  Anything anywhere\nthat has larger keys?  I've heard that RC2 can be scaled to arbitrarily\nlarge keys, but is this actually implemented anywhere?\n\nFinally, can anyone even concieve of a time/place where 128 bit keys aren't\nsufficient?  (I certainly can't - even at a trillion keys a second, it\nwould take about 10 billion years to search just one billionth of that keys\nspace.)

Yow - get some sleep Brad!  You mean that people (i.e. life-is-cheap\nterrorists & drug-dealing warlords) who want to communicate in privacy will\nprefer to break into my house, kill or kidnap me, and steal my telephone,\nrather than:\n\n        - Spending $15 at K-mart to buy a new phone.\n\n        - Purchasing a load of phones from the black market / flea market /\n          super market.\n\n        - Talking (*gasp*) face-to-face.\n\n        - Walking down to any one of millions of pay phones.\n\n        - Using messengers.\n\n        - Going to excruciating effort to think of code phrases like "I had\n          a blowout on the freeway today".\n\n    Look, this system does nothing to threaten folks who _know_ they're\nbeing wiretapped, since it's trivial to find other avenues of communication;\nthey'd have no reason to resort to extreme measures, since a plethora of\nsimple alternatives are easily available to them.\n\n    Among all the legitimate reasons to damn the proposed system, I don't\nthink we need to worry about terrorist commie drug warlord assasin thugs\nmurdering our families, kicking the dog and leaving the toilet seat up just\nto steal a $15 telephone.  The system is more like urine testing:  it\ncatches some small number of very stupid people, has no effect on the "bad\nguys" with at least three neurons working in unison who wish to subvert it,\nand penalizes most heavily those who have no cause to be subject to it.
I must respectfully disagree with this assertion, Brad.  The government is\nnotoriously sloppy with physical, communications, and information security.  They\ncan't keep their computers safe, and they're "trying".  Read "DEA is\nNot Adequately Protecting National Security Information" [GAO/IMTEC 92-31] for an\nexcellent example of what I'm talking about.\n\nPrivate sector organizations tend to be even more lax in their security measures.\nI believe that the escrow organizations will be penetrated by foreign\nintelligence services within months, if not weeks, of their selection.  Private\norganizations that lack the resources of a full-fleged intelligence service will\ntake longer - perhaps on the order of one to two years.  Nonetheless, the\npenetrations will take place, without question.
THIS President.  (And I could easily be wrong.)
Since the AT&T wiretap chip is scheduled to be distributed \ninternationally, allowing the U.S. government to spy on foreign \ngovernments, companies and people as as well as to wiretap domestic \ncitizens, this is a world-wide issue.  Thus Distribution: world.\n\n\n\nWhy do we hackers care about the Clipper chip?  Do we give a shit\nabout anybody's privacy accept our own?  And perhaps not even our\nown; are we so smart that we always know when we're talking to\nsomebody who has a wiretap on their phone?\n\nI find the "call thru your computer" ideas may reflect this attitude.\nIdeas that are of, by, and for hackers, and don't help anybody in the\nreal world, aren't going to do anybody much good, including ourselves\nwhere voice phones are concerned.\n\nWe *do* need an alternative to NSA-bugged telephones, but\nwe're talking inexpensive *telephones* here, including hand-sized\ncellulars, that need strong crypto, real privacy.  Make-shift\ncomputer hacker rigs that require living by your computer to\ntalk privately over the phone are just a dumb stunt that doesn't \ndo anything for anybody's privacy in the real world.  \n\nWhat we need is a true *privacy chip*.  For example, a real-time \nvoice-encryption RSA, silicon compile it and spit out ASIC.  \nPut this chip on the market as a de facto standard for international \nbusiness, diplomats, and private communications.  If the U.S. bans \nit, we make it somewhere else and import it.  The Japanese, German,\nDutch, Taiwanese, Korean, etc. electronics companies don't want the \nNSA spying on them.  U.S. workers lose more jobs to government fascist\nstupidity.
I agree with this assessment.  Furthermore, its promotion as\nproviding greater protection than bare voice is quite true, as far\nas it goes.  However, the only way for it to fulfill its stated goal\nof letting LE wiretap "terrorists and drug dealers" is to restrict\nstronger techniques.  \n\nWiretap targets presently use strong encryption, weak encryption, or\n(the vast majority) no encryption.  The latter two classes can be\ntapped.  With weak encryption in every phone, the no-encryption\nclass is merged into the weak-encryption class.  Will the\nintroduction of Clipper cause targets presently enjoying strong\nprivacy to give up on it?  that is, to rely for privacy on a system\nexpressly designed to deny it to people like them?  I doubt it.  The\nmere introduction of this scheme will give the government *nothing*.\n\nThe stated goal of preventing the degradation of wiretapping\ncapabilities can be fulfilled by restriction of domestic\ncryptography, and only by this restriction.  "Clipper" appears to be\nno more than a sop, given to the public to mute any complaints.  We\nwould find this a grossly inadequate tradeoff, but I fear the public\nat large will not care.  I hate to even mention gun control, but\nmost people seem to think that an `assault weapon' (as the NYT uses\nthe word) is some sort of automatic weapon, .50 caliber maybe.  Who\nwants to have such a thing legal?  Well, people know even less about\ncryptology; I suspect that strong cryptography could easily be\nlabeled "too much secrecy for law-abiding citizens to need".\n\n\nWhat they say is opinion, but what they do is what matters, and will\ncontinue unless overturned.  And the courts are reluctant to annul\nlaw or regulation, going to some length to decide cases on other\ngrounds.  Furthermore, Congress can get away with quite a bit.  They\ncould levy a burdensome tax; this would place enforcement in the\nhands of the BATF, who as we've seen you really don't want on your\ncase.  They could invoke the Commerce Clause; this seems most\nlikely.  This clause will get you anywhere these days.  The 18th was\nrequired because the Supreme Court ruled a prohibitory statute\nunconstitutional.  In 1970 Congress prohibited many drugs, with a\ntextual nod to the Commerce Clause.  The Controlled Substances\nAct of 1970 still stands.  I think the government could get away\nwith it.
That's nothing.  They wouldn't let the British buy Inmos Transputer systems\nbecause of security concerns.  And we designed the damn things!
Lets hope. Years ago a Telecom tech refused to tap a line unless he saw the \nwarrant. The managment type who told him to do it fired him. The appeal\nagainst the dismissal was lost.\n\n\nGood luck.
Not necessarily --- they could release the details of the algorithm\nwithout releasing the "system key" (called SK by Hellman).  That would\nmake most people happy, and with some sort of verification procedure\nbefore key exchange, the "official" chips would only work with other\n"official" chips.  In other words, secrecy of SK makes "physically\nidentical clone versions" impossible;  secrecy of the algorithm shouldn't\nbe necessary.\n\nOf course, revealing the algorithm opens them up to attacks on SK ---\nsince all units share this key, compromising it may be a big deal.\nPersonally, I wouldn't feel too comfortable knowing that one "secret"\n80-bit number held in many places was all that guaranteed my security.\nOf course, compromise of SK doesn't necessarily mean that the system\nis compromised, but it's impossible to tell whether or not that's true\nwith a secret algorithm.\n\nIncidentally, what's to keep a "secret algorithm" from using the secret\nSK as the main key, with UK being only marginally important.  Then\na court order for UK may not even be necessary to do a wiretap.
That sounds like an old _Dragnet_ episode.\n\n  "Joe and I went to the apartment of Prime Suspect.  Nobody answered the\n  door, but his landlord gave us permission to search the apartment."\n\nPerhaps that worked in California in the 60's, but as I understand the\nlaw landlords do _not_ have authority to grant permission to search space\nrented by a third party, provided the lease is not in default, etc.\n(I'm not even sure if they can provide the master key, when shown a search\nwarrant, since the _subject_ of the search is supposed to be notified).\n\nAt this point the question becomes: did the user "rent" the disk space\nher encrypted file occupies?  If she did, it _should_ fall under the same\nbody of case law that applies to apartments, storage lockers, etc.  (As\nto whether any court would recognize this fact....)  If she did not (i.e.,\nno compensation exchanged), I don't know how it would be treated -- there\ndoesn't seem to be a non-cyberspace equivalent.
You are so correct - Clinton did not initiate it.  He just cast it in\nGRANITE by implimenting, NOT stopping the DECISION.  I also stated in another\npost I don't give a damn what administration does it, I still find it\ntotally unacceptable, and whoever impliments it or rams it down our throats\nought to be run out of office.\n\nAlso, Bush was not trying to deprive us of our Second Amendment rights.\nClinton is BUSTING HIS BUTT in that regard.  That reveals a total difference\nin philosophy.  Clinton appears to support the idea of TOTAL people\ncontrol.  Eavesdropping whenever they feel like it, no real security\nfor the common person, and no ability to defend oneself against illegal\nattack, from whatever source.  "Trust us, we will protect (and control)\nyou... if we don't find it inconvenient..."\n\nClinton has also shown his utter contempt for public disclosure and\naccountability, as well.  He had plenty of time to change the policy.\n\nHE DIDN'T.  HE EXPANDED ON IT.\n\nI bet had Bush been in office, you would be in there howling louder\nthan I.
:    Indeed, if NSA really designed the algorithm to be secure, it's very likely\n: as secure as IDEA or 2-key DES.  However, the system as a whole isn't resistant\n: to "practical cryptanalysis."  In _The Puzzle Palace_, Bamford describes how\n: several NSA employees were turned by foreign (presumably KGB) agents, despite\n: security measures that I doubt any Big 8 accounting firm could match.  And\n: NSA confidential data was *not* subject to being requested by thousands of\n: police organizations and courts across the land.\n\nAh yes, don't anyone mention Ronald William Pelton[*], heh heh heh.  How\nembarrassing.
People took this article seriously?  I mean, I know it's the\nNet and all, but the prankster didn't even have Clinton's sound-bites\nright.
The protocol/key-management description published so far is either\n	incomplete or incorrect. It leaves me with no idea of how the system\n	would actually _work_. I hope the CPSR FOIA request succeeds so that\n	we get full details.\n\nWouldn't it be easier just to ask denning@cs.georgetown.edu? ;-)
:    Does Dorothy Denning read this group?  If not, is someone on the group\n: forwarding questions like these to her, or Martin Hellman, or anyone else\n: who's seen more details about the chip?\n\nOf course she does; it's just she's been toasted so often for being\nan NSA patsy that she's keeping her head down.  You can always mail\nher directly as denning@guvax.acc.georgetown.edu,\ndenning@cs.cosc.georgetown.edu or denning@cs.georgetown.edu
This won't work if there is a checksum on the keys you don't know about.\nNeither will registering a clipper chip and then substituting a\n"counterfeit" one if the serial number contains a checksum.\n\nChances are the government has thought of this, and "just anyone" won't be\npermitted access to enough of the internals to make a "fake" clipper chip.\nChances are that the government has classified some details of the internals\nat a very high level, and manufacturers are required to observe security\nsafeguards and clearances corresponding to that level.\n\nWhile not perfect, it would prevent Joe Hacker from rolling his own spoofing\nchip, since not many counterfeiters can survive a background investigation.\nSome of the more notorious self-styled dissidents here, for example, have\nalready got their heads so high above the tall grass that they'd have little\nchance of getting a clearance.\n\nOf course it's not impossible that someone do this, but probably extremely\ndifficult. Chances are there will also be very heavy criminal penalties for\nphony clipper chips, on some national security/classified info grounds or\nother, thus making the game not worth the candle.
[...]\n\n\n[...]\n\n\nQuite interesting.  How does the US administration intend to persuade\nnon - US governments to let the NSA eavesdrop on them?  Or should U.S.\ncompanies install these chips in communication systems sold abroad\nwithout the customer's knowedge or consent, or not at all?
True, but will traditional encryptions schemes, when further encrypted\nby Clipper, be _more_ vulnerable to attacks such as partially known\nplaintext?
You've overlooked a fundamental Truth:\n\n	both headcount and budget of any government agency are\n	monotonic increasing functions.\n\nGiven that Truth, you need to look for what the agency can do to occupy\nall those people and spend all that money when crypto is unbreakable.\n\nPerhaps they could talk the world's telephone companies into making equipment\nthey could break into and tap.\n\nMaybe they could convince people that distributed computing was a good idea\nso that even the internal state of a process would be available for access\nby wiretapping.\n\nMaybe....

Some thoughts:\n\nHas any work been done on encapsulating encrypted data inside "non-encrypted"\ndata files?  Many file formats can be written with "gaps" in them to hide\nother data.  New file formats could be designed to have alternate data hidden\nby dispersing it amongst the "legitimate" data.  The hidden data would only\nshow up with the right key(s), and a file with hidden data would be\nindistinguishable from one without.  So, only the correct key(s) would reveal\nthe presence of an "illegal" document.\n\nIf I devise a custom file compression algorithm and only I and a friend have\nthe uncompressor, and otherwise the file appears to be total gigerish, do I\nhave the right to transmit the file?  Will we have to "escrow" all our data\nfile formats?  Are gangs required to escrow their hand signals, colors and\ncatch phrases?
Just a question. \nAs a provider of a public BBS service - aren't you bound by law to gurantee\nintelligble access to the data of the users on the BBS, if police comes\nwith sufficent authorisation ?

[...]\n[...]\n\nI just found out from my source that this article was a joke.  Heh heh..  \nIt seemed pretty damn convincing to me from the start -- I just didn't\nnotice the smiley at the end of the article, and there were a few other\nhints which I should of caught.\n\nAnyway -- I guess this 'joke' did turn out to resemble Clinton's true \nfeelings at least to some extent.  \n\nSorry about that...
Note: I am *not* a cable freak, so I might have completely\nmisunderstood what you said.  Also, my math is frequently noted for\nbeing wrong, so you'll better check the calculations yourself.\n\nI assume that 14.4K means 14.4K Bits.  So if we assume one start and\none stopbit, and no protocol overhead, the effective number of bytes\nper second is 1.44K.\n\nLet's also assume that you do not want to transmit your speech in\nstereo, so that you can send 1,440 samples/sec.  This corresponds to a\nNyquist frequency of 720 Hz, which should be too low, especially if\nyou think about the 8-bit low quality sound.  Furthermore, your D/A\nconverter will probably not present you with a signal that has been\ncut off at 720 Hz, but will instead alias in all the higher\nfrequencies.  (Although you can definitely build a filter to overcome\nthat problem.)\n\nOn the other hand, speech should be easily compressible.  For example,\nyou could form power spectra, or you could simply band-pass filter and\nthen linearize the fourier transforms.  It won't be CD quality sound,\nbut it'll be discernible.  The power spectrum method is very good in\nthat respect.  I have once programmed such a software compressor, and\ncompression rates of 90% with relative errors due to linearization of\nless than 5% were common.  Although I must say that these were musical\nsounds, not speech.\n\nHave fun.
Not necessarily.  I've been thinking about this, and if this chip/scheme\nis to provide any real security, there must be some sort of key exchange,\neither using a public-key encryption scheme, or using a key exchange scheme\nlike Diffie-Hellman.  If there's an out-of-band transmission of a shared\nsession key, then what protects that band from eavesdropping?  If the phone\ncompany or some other online central authority generates a session key and\nsends it to both users, then what's the point of going to the trouble of\nhaving some complicated key-depositories?  Just ask the phone company for\na copy of the session key for each call.\n \n   Now, it's probably not practical for each user to keep an online copy of\nevery public key used by anyone anywhere, right?  So, probably, there will\nbe some way of getting these keys verified.  This might be a digitally-\nsigned (by the chip manufacturer) copy of the public key in this unit,\nstored by this unit.  It might also be an online directory with access to\neveryone's public keys.  (This would introduce another weakness to the\nsecurity of the scheme, of course.)  Presumably, if you don't use your\ndesignated key, you can't get a verified connection to other standard chips.\n \n   It might be useful to have a modified chip, which would allow you to\nuse either the original public/private key pair, or some other key pair\nand verification scheme.  Unfortunately, this would not allow you to call\nmost people and establish secure communications....
There was an interesting column on the editorial page of the Dallas\nMorning News on Saturday by Walter Williams, who I believe is a\nprofessor at Georgetown (I wonder if he knows of Dorothy "you're not in\nKansas anymore" Denning).  The article was titled "Government slowly\neroding our liberties", and in it he tells a story attributed to the\nlate Leonard Read who\n\n        explained that if you wanted to take liberty away from\n        Americans, you had to know how to cook a frog.  Mr. Read\n        said you can't cook a frog by boiling a pot of water and\n        then throwing the frog in.  His reflexes are so quick that\n        as soon as his feet touch the water, he will leap away.\n        You must put the frog in a pot of cold water and heat it\n        up bit by bit.  By the time the frog realizes he's being\n        cooked, it is too late.  It is the same with Americans.\n        If anyone tried to take our freedoms all at once, we\n        would naturally rebel and suppress the tyrant.  But as\n        with successful frog cooking, our liberties can be taken\n        a little bit at a time.\n\nThe last line of the article says, "It's not too late for us, but the\nwater is getting pretty warm."  I'd have toagree that it's warm and the\nClipper is keeping the temperature on an upward course.\n\nNOTE: followups redirected to alt.privacy.clipper
Generally, an organization has influence in proportion to:\n\n	The narrowness of its objectives\n	The number of members\n	The strength of belief of its members\n\nThis is why the pro- and anti-abortion groups are so strong: narrow objectives,\nlots of interested members who are real passionate.\n\nFor this reason, mixing with the NRA is probably a bad idea.  It diffuses\nthe interests of both groups.  It may well diminish the Passion Index\nof the combined organization.  It is not clear it would greatly enlarge\nthe NRA.\n\nSo, I believe a new organization, which may cooperate with NRA where the\ntwo organization's interest coincide, is the optimum strategy.\n\nlew
I have lurked here a bit lately, and though some of the math is\nunknown to me, found it interesting. I thought I would post an article I\nfound in the Saturday, April 17, 1993 Toronto Star:\n\n                  'CLIPPER CHIP' to protect privacy\n\n   Washington (REUTER) - President Bill CLinton announced yesterday a\nplan to plant a new "Clipper Chip" in every government telephone and\ncomputer line to prevent eavesdropping.\n\n   Eventually the chips, developed by the government's National\nInstitute for Standards and Technology, would be used by commercial and\nprivate electronics communication users.\n\n   The White House said that to assure privacy, each device containing\nthe encryption devices would be assigned two unique "keys" - numbers\nthat will be needed by government agencies to decode messages.\n\n   The attorney-general has been assigned the task of arranging that the\nkeys are deposited in two "key-escrow" data bases. Access to them would\nbe limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a\nwiretap, the White House said in a statement.\n\n                              -30-\n\n\n Dan McKinnon
This actually supports Bill's speculation - IF there is a backdoor in\nRSAREF and IF PKP is supported secretly by the NSA, then it is more\nthan natural that they will welcome ANY public-key implementation that\nuses RSAREF and will strongly oppose themselves against ANY\nimplementation that doesn't.\n\nI personally cannot see how one could put a backdoor in a\nlong-precision modular arithmetic library that comes in source, but,\nof course, the fact that -I- cannot see it means nothing...\n\nRegards,\nVesselin

All they\ncare about is wether or not what they are using is secure or not. That,\nafter all IS the bottom line. \n\n	Second, if I look at all the people I know who use any form\nof encryption at all, and this group spans people from the morons who\nstill insist that the DES is a good and secure standard, to people \nlooking at trying to improve upon existing strategies, I can not think\nof anyone of them who would approve blindly of a strategy that leaves\ntheir methods open to abuse. The Clipper does this, because people make\nmistakes by nature, and the US government is made up of people who are\njust as vulnerable to mistakes as everyone else. \n\n	Third, since most of the people I know are at least marginaly\nfamiliar with the vulnerabilities present in current software encryption\nstratigies, I can't see how most of them are going to blindly trust that\nsomeone will not figure out a good way to compromise the Clipper Chip.\nThat despite any strengths or weaknesses that may exist in it. So, I can \nnot see a high degree of confidence developing in the chip.\n\n	Fourth, when it comes to criminal abuse, sure there are many stupid\npeople out there. And yes, some will be open to being caught via the \nbuilt in back door of the Clipper Chip. However, anyone who is going to\ndo any serious investigation of how best to secure their data is going\nto run into that problem pretty damned fast and, I would assume, start\nlooking around for other easily obtainible methods of encryption. \n\n\n	If nothing else were avalible, none of this would be an issue. However,\nthe truth is that most private encryption users that I've ever run into\nsimply do not give a damn about the legal status of RSA or PGP or anything\nelse. If it works, they use it. This is not going to change either. I do\nnot think for a moment that anyone with serious criminal intent will be\nslowed down by the advent of the Clipper Chip. It is all to easy to \nconvert encrypted data into unintellgible garbage as it is, if anything,\nthe Clipper Chip just adds another tool to the user.\n\n\n	The bottom line here is that people will use what works, and\nunavoidibly, I'm sure most criminals would rather face an encryption\nrelated charge than one which could potentialy lead to death penalty\ncharges in the case of criminals who murder as part of their conspiricy.\n	The other thing that has struck me since the advent and wide \nuseage of public encryption has begun is that quite simply the cat is\nout of the bag (Or if you have an interest in snooping, Pandora's Box\nhas been opened), and this is not going to change. I've seen a blindness\nto this that I've found utterly stunning, and the Clipper Chip, along\nwith the way it has been presented only confirms this to me to a larger\ndegree.\n\n\n			Sincerly,\n\n			Tim Scanlon\n\n--
I'm not sure it is a major limiting move... in the academic circles\nI've seen, arguing for increased government intervention and\nmanagement is almost always a plus (not the least because it usually\nmeans more high paying jobs for academics as "advisors").  Also\nconsider that it looks like Denning has some decent NSA / government\nconnections, which is always a plus for an academic institute that\nwants more government funding and work tossed their way.\n\nDespicable, yes; career limiting, well, the publicity probably\noutweighs the drawbacks.  And there are a whole bunch of people who\nthink the whole thing is just peachy keen. If it's only going to be\nused against drug dealers, child pornographers, and terrorists, well\nit must be good. :p
Archive-name: cryptography-faq/part07\nLast-modified: 1993/4/15\n\n\nFAQ for sci.crypt, part 7: Digital Signatures and Hash Functions\n\nThis is the seventh of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ. The parts are\nmostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.\nWe don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.\nNotes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.\n\nThe sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu \nas /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography \nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers\nevery 21 days.\n\n\nContents:\n\n* What is a one-way hash function?\n* What is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.?\n* What are MD4 and MD5?\n* What is Snefru?\n\n\n* What is a one-way hash function?\n\n  A typical one-way hash function takes a variable-length message and\n  produces a fixed-length hash. Given the hash it is computationally\n  impossible to find a message with that hash; in fact one can't\n  determine any usable information about a message with that hash, not\n  even a single bit. For some one-way hash functions it's also\n  computationally impossible to determine two messages which produce the\n  same hash.\n\n  A one-way hash function can be private or public, just like an\n  encryption function. Here's one application of a public one-way hash\n  function, like MD5 or Snefru. Most public-key signature systems are\n  relatively slow. To sign a long message may take longer than the user\n  is willing to wait. Solution: Compute the one-way hash of the message,\n  and sign the hash, which is short. Now anyone who wants to verify the\n  signature can do the same thing.\n\n  Another name for one-way hash function is message digest function.\n\n* What is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.?\n\n  There is a horrendous mishmash of terminology in the literature for a\n  very small set of concepts. When an algorithm depends on a key which\n  isn't published, we call it a private algorithm; otherwise we call it\n  a public algorithm. We have encryption functions E and decryption\n  functions D, so that D(E(M)) = M for any message M. We also have\n  hashing functions H and verification functions V, such that V(M,X) = 1\n  if and only if X = H(M).\n\n  A public-key cryptosystem has public encryption and private\n  decryption. Checksums, such as the application mentioned in the\n  previous question, have public hashing and public verification.\n  Digital signature functions have private hashing and public\n  verification: only one person can produce the hash for a message,\n  but everyone can verify that the hash is correct.\n\n  Obviously, when an algorithm depends on a private key, it's meant to\n  be unusable by anyone who doesn't have the key. There's no real\n  difference between a ``shared'' key and a private key: a shared key\n  isn't published, so it's private. If you encrypt data for a friend\n  rather than ``for your eyes only'', are you suddenly doing\n  ``shared-key encryption'' rather than private-key encryption? No.\n\n* What are MD4 and MD5?\n\n  MD4 and MD5 are message digest functions developed by Ron Rivest.\n  Definitions appear in RFC 1320 and RFC 1321 (see part 10). Code is\n  available from [FTPMD].\n\n  Note that a transcription error was found in the original MD5 draft\n  RFC. The corrected algorithm should be called MD5a, though some\n  people refer to it as MD5.\n\n* What is Snefru?
Or just dig a deep enough hole in the ground. 50 feet should do it.
I can see high-voltage type display devices being vulnerable (CRTs,\nplasma displays, etc.)  But Jason beat me to this question.  What\nabout EM radiation from low-voltage items like LCD displays?
To me, a larger problem is that once disclosed, your keys could be used\nto decrypt any previously recorded conversations. I gather that from this\nproposal a warrant would be required to get the keys, but not to collect\nconversations! Consider the scenario where an agency collects preemptively\nall encrypted conversations for certain people likely to be targets (and\nnot necessarily "legitimate" targets), then arranges for some unrelated\nincident that can trigger a warrant:\n\n   "Your honor, we know that the suspect has received calls from noted \ncrime figure Bugsy Butthead [said calls arranged by the agency] and we must \ntherefore have this warrant to determine whether this suspect, in a\nsensitive govt post, is corrupt."\n\n  I suppose that it is conceivable that there are session keys involved\nsomewhere, but that doesn't seem likely; if there are, why wouldn't the\ntechnical overview mention them when it goes to such details as the number\nof bits held by each escrow authority?\n\n  This scheme is full of holes, and stinks to high heaven.\n\n  -mel
1. Do a straight encryption of your keyrings and put the\n        results with misleading names somewhere they won't be noticed\n        (eg. in the \windows directory; nobody knows what half those\n        files are).\n\n     2. Do a straight encryption of a .BAT file that will decrypt\n        the keyrings to RAMdisk and will set PGPPATH to point at it.\n\n     3. Set up another .BAT file to decrypt and execute the first\n        (again on RAM disk). Have it take the name of the target file\n        as an argument so that there is no link between this file and\n        the (non-existent) batch file referred to by the rest of the\n        system. Comment it so it looks like a test script for fooling\n        around with PGP. Set PGPPATH to the PGP directory.\n\n     4. Leave the original keyrings that came with PGP in the\n        directory with PGP; a good indication that you are playing\n        with, but haven't made serious use of PGP. Add a set of keys\n        with your name and a really simple passphrase. Never use it,\n        or use it as your widely published key for low-security\n        e-mail.\n\n     5. When needed, run the second .BAT file. Make sure all\n        intermediate and plainfiles are generated on RAMdisk.\n\n     6. When you hear the concussion grenade, hit the power switch.\n        \n        Cheers,\n                Marc\n\n---\n Marc Thibault        | CIS:71441,2226     |  Put another log\n marc@tanda.isis.org  | NC FreeNet: aa185  |  on the fire.\n\n-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\nVersion: 2.0

It always amazes me how quick people are to blame whatever\nadministration is current for things they couldn't possibly have\ninitiated.  This chip had to take *years* to develop, yet already\nwe're claiming that the Clinton administration sneaked it in on us.\nBullshit.  The *Bush* administration and the career Gestapo were\nresponsible for this horror, and the careerists presented it to the\nnew presidency as a fait accompli.  That doesn't excuse Clinton and\nGore from criticism for being so stupid as to go for it, but let's lay\nthe body at the proper door to start with.
There are some issues which come to mind when one considers\nthe law enforcement aspects of the use of the Big Brother\n(Clipper) chip.\n     The drug dealers and terrorists aren't going to let\nthemselves be caught by using this type of encryption.  In 1985\nthe New York Times reported that government investigators broke\nup a narcotics ring that was operating highly sophisticated\nequipment capable of allowing the leaders of the ring to\neavesdrop on the law-enforcement agents who were trying to arrest\nthem.\n     A Mr. Deely, an NSA official, said "There are a lot of\nmedium-sized countries that would have been proud to have the\nsignals intelligence operation of this group."\n     For every John Gotti there are probably many more people who\nhave the sophistication to know what the risks of unsecure\ncommunications are.  The press given to the Big Brother chip will\nonly increase their numbers.\n     Even if there is some benefit to law-enforcement through the\nuse of Big Brother, it must be weighed against the constitutional\nand civil liberties questions involved.\n     For example, in some areas of the world torture is used as\nan investigative tool by the local "law-enforcement" people.  I\nsuspect it is an effective means of obtaining information and\nshortening many investigations.  It probably also helps keep the\nconviction rate high.\n     The fact that the torture tool is not used in this country\n(even with a court order obtained by showing "probable cause") is\nbecause we have rightly balanced the questions of expediency and\nwhat is ethically and morally right.\n     I think that the same question of expediency versus morality\nshould come into play when considering the use of Big Brother.  I\nvote for morality.\n     I am quite disturbed by what I interpret as a veiled threat\nto prohibit the use of all encryption if this Big Brother chip is\nnot put into wide spread use.  After a quick reading of the White\nHouse press release I came away with that impression.\n     To most of the American public, the word "hacker" has\nrightly or wrongly come to mean "high tech adolescent vandal".\nIt has struck me that most of the people posting to sci.crypt\nregarding this issue are intelligent, thoughtful individuals who\nhave genuine concerns about the privacy and constitutional issues\nsurrounding Big Brother.  I hope that the use of Big Brother does\nnot become mandatory and other encryption become illegal.  I\nwould hate to see this become some kind of high tech Volstead\nAct.\n     The high speed digital communications revolution is coming\nat us with the speed of an SST.  The times they are a changing,\nand just as IBM is learning that they can't do business the same\nway they have done it for the past 40 years, maybe NSA should\nevaluate another approach.\n     EFF, who have correctly questioned the cryptographic\nstrength of Big Brother, may need to send a stronger message out\nregarding the constitutional issues involved.\n     Al Gore may want to think this one through a little more.\n     And as for Dorothy Elizabeth Robling Denning: En quoi cela\nvous concerne, cheri?
<\n< > I wonder if she landed such a fat fee from cooperation with the NSA in\n< >the design and propoganda stages that she doesn't care any more? \n<\n<  Which is to say: is the NSA -totally- perfidious, or does it at least\n<have the redeeming virtue of taking care of its own? <g>\n\nOf course they take care of their own ... very well ... until the person\nhas 'outlived his/her/undefined usefulness'... then 'elimination' becomes\na consideration...  :-)
:>It looks like Dorothy Denning's wrong-headed ideas have gotten to the\n:>Administration even sooner than we feared.\n:\n:I'd lay long odds that it was the other way around.  Clinton didn't\n:just pull this plan out of any bodily orifices; the NSA has to have\n:been working on it for years.  While it's possible that Denning (and\n:other prominent people) just happened to start arguing for such a\n:system, it seems more likely that there was a suggestion involved.\n:If this guess is wrong, I apologize.\n\nI'm sure Dorothy Denning is an honest person and wouldn't lie to us.\nSimply think up a question to ask her about her involvement, but be\nvery careful to phrase it in such a way that there can be no Jesuitical\nevasion or a true but wholly misleading answer.\n\nIn this country, MI5 are *experts* at answering these questions; for\ninstance there was a British journalist (Jonathon Moyle) killed in South\nAmerica a couple of years ago.  Parliament asked "Was he an MI5 employee"\n"No." - turns out afterwards he wasn't paid, therefore wasn't an employee.\nThey could equally have said he wasn't an agent - he went abroad on his\nprivate business with no brief from MI5, but was interviewed and debriefed\nat length only *on his return*.
From: "dan mckinnon" <dan.mckinnon@canrem.com>\n\n	   I have lurked here a bit lately, and though some of the math is\n	unknown to me, found it interesting. I thought I would post an article I\n	found in the Saturday, April 17, 1993 Toronto Star:\n\n	                  'CLIPPER CHIP' to protect privacy\n\nPolitics is of course Dirty Pool, old man, and here we have a classic\nexample: the NSA and the administration have been working on this for\na *long* time, and in parallel with the announcement to us techies, we\nsee they're hitting the press with propoganda.\n\nIt's my bet the big magazines - Byte, Scientific American, et all - will\nbe ready to run with a pre-written government-slanted story on this in\nthe next issue.  ('Just keep us some pages spare boys, we'll give you\nthe copy in time for the presses')\n\nWe *must* get big names in the industry to write well argued pieces against\nthis proposal (can you call it that when it's a de facto announcement?) and\nget them into the big magazines before too much damage is done.\n\nIt would be well worth folks archiving all the discussions from here since\nthe day of the announcement to keep all the arguments at our fingertips.  I\nthink between us we could write quite a good piece.\n\nNow, who among us carries enough clout to guarantee publication?  Phil?\nDon Parker?  Mitch Kapor?
Legal or not, I've seen it done.  Phone records were obtained\nin order to *establish* probable cause, rather than as a result of it.\nIn other words, for a fishing expedition.\n\n \n\nAnd does the phone company require written, subpoena-able evidence\nof probable cause in order to process the request?  I suggest that\nthe officer was disinterested in pursuing your case -- even if you\ncould prove the offender had called you at a certain time, your \nchances of winning a harassment suit on the strength of this evidence\nare nil.  My contact with several people who have dealt with cases\nof extreme phone harassment (several thousand calls in one case) teaches \nme that police in this area are quite lethargic about pursuing such matters.
[a list of large-integer arithmetic packages elided]\n\nI thought I would note that except Lenstra's packages, none of the\nlarge-integer packages are in the public domain. As an alternative,\na straightforward *PD* implementation of Knuth's algorithms may be\nfound as a part of Uof Arizona's ICON distribution.\n\noz
That doesn't worry me at all; they're not going to cheat at something\nthey can get caught at.  And key size is one of the things that can be\nverified externally.  Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the\nchip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to the\noutput.  We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output\nbits should vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change.\n\nIf they were out to build a weak cryptosystem, it might be the case that\nsome of the bits are much less powerful than others, in the sense that\nthey only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast,\nDES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible; the 50% output\nchange rate appears as early as round 5.  Again, though, I don't think\nNSA is going to cheat that crudely; they're likely to get caught.\n\nRemember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see\nthe cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES-like, a biased\nsubkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb.  The committee\ncan and should run lots of tests, and retain the output.  This can be verified\nlater against the chip.  And yes, the civilian community has at least some\nsecure storage facilities that I don't think even NSA can get into without\nit being noticed, until Fort Meade gets its transporter working again.\n(Oops -- I don't think I was supposed to talk about that...)  The committee\nmembers can even retain secure copies of the code -- in two halves, which\nyou have to XOR together to recover the program...\n\nSeriously, there are, I think, problems with this whole scheme.  But the\npeople who invented it aren't stupid, and they've been in the crypto game\nand the smoke-and-mirrors game far longer than most of us.  They're not\ngoing to lie in ways that can be detected easily, since their credibility\nis the *only* thing they can use to sell this system.  If they've lied\nabout the civilian committee, no one will believe them about the absence\nof other back doors.  If they've lied about the key size, no one will\nbelieve that they haven't copied the programming disk with the U keys.\nIf they've lied about obvious aspects of the strength of the cryptosystem,\nno one will believe the escrow agencies aren't in cahoots with them.\n\nThat isn't to say that they aren't lying about all those other things\nanyway.  And I'm certainly not claiming that NSA can't build a cryptosystem\nwith a back door that the committee can't find -- look how long it took\nfor folks to believe that the S-boxes weren't sabotaged.  It's entirely\npossible that the committee will release an ambiguous report, for just\nsuch reasons.  But that's a subtle point (i.e., one you can't explain to\na Senator...).\n\n\nI don't like the unit key generation process any better than you do.\nHowever -- S1 and S2 are supposed to be under control of the same\nescrow agents.  If they can't be trusted to keep the seed values secure,\nthey can't be trusted to keep the half-keys secure.\n\nI still don't know if or when S1 and S2 change.  I thought I had seen\nsomething about them being constant, but I just reread Denning's technical\ninformation post, and it doesn't say anything, one way or the other.
Try reading between the lines David - there are *strong* hints in there\nthat they're angling for NREN next, and the only conceivable meaning of\napplying this particular technology to a computer network is that they\nintend it to be used in exclusion to any other means of encryption.\n\nDon't be lulled by the wedge because its end looks so thin.
If there are many as..., er, people in the USA who reason like the\nabove, then it should not be surprising that the current plot has been\nallowed to happen...\n\nRegards,\nVesselin
Nah.  Nothing sucks like a VAX :)...
I am eager to hear the legal theory behind restricting exchange of\ncryptographic data and encrypted messages, given the first admendment;\nthe theory behind regulating the *personal* encryption of one's personal\n*thoughts and feelings* seems even less tenable.\n\nPerhaps if we make a *treaty* with, say, Iceland, to restrict crypto\nparaphernalia can a good "end run" around the Constitution happen...\n(Treaties -- as someone pointed out -- has the force of any other "law of\nthe land".  Like the Bill of Rights.)\n\n\n    Amendment 1\n\n    Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or\nprohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech,\nor of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to\npetition the Government for a redress of grievances.\n\n    Amendment 2\n\n    A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State,\nthe right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\n\n    Amendment 3\n\n    No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the\nconsent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed\nby law.\n\n    Amendment 4\n\n    The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and\neffects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated,\nand no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or\naffirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the\npersons or things to be seized.\n\n    Amendment 5\n\n    No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous\ncrime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in\ncases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in\nactual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be\nsubject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb;\nnor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against\nhimself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process\nof law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just\ncompensation.\n\n\nWell -- at least for a few minutes we had some privacy...
Here are four pseudo-random character generators, based on\nirreducible trinomials.  Each contains 16 separate trinomials,\none of which is selected on initialization (there are 64\ndistinct trinomials between the 4 PRCGs).  The PRCGs are\ninitialized with a 32-bit seed, and a 4-bit trinomial-\nselector.\n\nI would like to get comments on these by anyone who is\ninterested enough to look them over.

What is the status of cruptology for private citizens throughout the\nworld? or, more clearly, is there a listing of countries and their\npolicies on citizens encrypting electronic data?  \n\nI'm curious how the Europeans handle this, for instance.
Notwithstanding all the legitimate fuss about this proposal, how much\nof a change is it?  ATT's last product in this area (a) was priced over\n$1000, as I suspect 'clipper' phones will be; (b) came to the customer \nwith the key automatically preregistered with government authorities. Thus,\naside from attempting to further legitimize and solidify the fed's posture,\nClipper seems to be "more of the same", rather than a new direction.\n   Yes, technology will eventually drive the cost down and thereby promote\nmore widespread use- but at present, the man on the street is not going\nto purchase a $1000 crypto telephone, especially when the guy on the other\nend probably doesn't have one anyway.  Am I missing something?\n   The real question is what the gov will do in a year or two when air-\ntight voice privacy on a phone line is as close as your nearest pc.  That\nhas got to a problematic scenario for them, even if the extent of usage\nnever surpasses the 'underground' stature of PGP.
This isn't true.  Today's criminals regularly use all sorts of unsafe\nmethods, from cordless phones to cellular phones to plain old copper\nwire analog phones that you can put alligator clips on to plan and\nexecute their crimes.\n\nIt is amazing how stupid they are, which is why the FBI was so keen on\nthe digital telphony law, and its successor the clipper chip.  They're\nhoping here that most crooks will remain stupid, feel safe using clipper\nchip phones and get caught.
It has actually come up (or it will in a week or two) in NZ.  I'll post the\noutcome when the trial finishes (which could take months BTW).  Overall it\nlooks like you can't be forced to reveal a password, if anyone can provide\na convincing legal argument to the contrary (ie an actual court case) I'd\nbe most interested...\n\nPeter.
In <1993Apr17.032828.14262@clarinet.com>, brad@clarinet.com sez:\n\nUnder the relevant federal law, 18 USC sec. 2518(8)(d), the\nauthorizing judge must notify the targets within 90 days after the tap\nperiod (with extensions) expires.  This is the "normal" practice.\n\nOf course, no wiretap law would be complete without the Unless Clause,\nwhich in subsection 8(d) reads like this: "On an ex parte showing\n[i.e., by the gov't without opposition, since that would obviously\ninvolve notice to the targets] of good cause to a judge of competent\njurisdiction the serving of the inventory required by this subsection\n[the order itself; dates of interception; etc.] *may be postponed*"\n(emphasis added).\n\n\n[Followups directed to a few select groups.]
Whats the difference between a V.32bis modem and a V.32bis modem?\n\nI'm not being entirely silly here: what I'm pointing out is that the\nmodems that they have already approved for data transmission will work\njust fine to transmit scrambled vocoded voice.\n\n--\nPerry Metzger		pmetzger@shearson.com
For example, I don't own a cordless phone.  With Clipper, I would.  If the \n   local men in blue really want to listen to me talk to my friends or order \n   pizza, I'm no worse off than I am now, and I don't have to worry about\n   local kids or nosy neighbors.\nI do tend to agree.  Sigh.\n\n   So, where can I buy a DES-encrypted cellular phone?  How much does it cost?\n\nOf course, if we didn't have government monopolies on cellular phone service,\nthere probably *would* be some available.\n\n   > How can you reconcile the administrations self proclaimed purpose of \n   > providing law enforcement with access to encrypted data without making \n   > the clipper system the only crypto available in the U.S... ?\n   The Second and Fourth Amendments do come to mind.  \n\nThe Second Amendment is especially apt, given the ITAR definitions of\ncrypto equipment as munitions, and the gun-control people's increasing\nability to define things as "assault weapons" and make them illegal.\nTriple-DES is obviously used for "assault phones", while\nCripple will be legal, and Triple-Cripple may fall into the gray area\nof "illegally upgrading to an assault phone"...

Secrecy in Clipper Chip\n\nThe serial number of the clipper chip is encrypted with the system key and\ntransmitted as one part of a three part message.\n\nPresumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else, differential\nanalysis).\n\nPostulate if you will, a chip (or logic) sitting between the clipper chip\nand its communications channel.  The purpose of this chip is twofold:\n    \n	1) Transmit Channel\n\n	    The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with\n	    a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number\n	    unrecoverable with just the system key\n\n	2) Recieve Channel\n\n	    The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number\n	    with a secondary keying variable (assuming the serial number\n	    is necessary for local operation).\n\nThis has the net result of hiding the serial number.  This gets more\ninteresting when the number of serial numbers issued becomes large,\nmaking it difficult to distinguish between valid serial numbers and\na spoofed serial number.  Without knowing the system key, you could\nlie about the serial number, but risk detection of the lie.\n\nIF you had the system key and the encryption algorithm you could\nsuccessfully lie with a lower probability of detection by emulating the\nformat of your own serial number.

Well, almost.... If I only had to solve the problem for myself, and were\nwilling to have to type in a second password (the secret key) whenever I\nlogged in, it could work. However, I'm trying to create a solution that\nanyone can use, and which, once installed, is just as effortless to start up\nas the non-solution of just using xhost(1) to control access. I've got\nreligeous problems with storing secret keys on multiuser computers.\n\n\nThanks for the pointer! It was good reading, and I liked the idea of using\nseveral unrelated sources with a strong mixing function. However, unless I\nmissed something, the only source they suggested (aside from a hardware RNG)\nthat seems available, and unguessable by an intruder, when a Unix is\nfresh-booted, is I/O buffers related to network traffic. I believe my\nsolution basically uses that strategy, without requiring me to reach into\nthe kernel.\n\n\nI heard about this solution, and it sounded good. Then I heard that folks\nwere experiencing times of 30-60 seconds to run this, on\nreasonably-configured workstations. I'm not willing to add that much delay\nto someone's login process. My approach (etherfind|compress, skip 10K) takes\na second or two to run. I'm considering writing the be-all and end-all of\nsolutions, that launches the MD5, and simultaneously tries to suck bits off\nthe net, and if the net should be sitting __SO__ idle that it can't get 10K\nafter compression before MD5 finishes, use the MD5. This way I could have\nguaranteed good bits, and a deterministic upper bound on login time, and\nstill have the common case of login take only a couple of extra seconds.
The original one-way encryption I put into Multics about 1968 (as suggested\n\nby Joe Weizenbaum) was invertible.  An Air Force tiger team demonstrated \nthis to me in May 1973.  I then asked an expert (who requested anonymity) \nwhat I should use instead; the expert's suggestion was to treat the \n8-byte password as both key and data for the LUCIFER encryption algorithm, \nwhich is similar or identical to DES.  This method or something stronger \nshould take care of (a).  Issue (b) is discussed in comp.security.misc: \nlonger passwords and quality control on what users can choose as passwords\nare the common tactics.
[...]>\n[...]>\n\nIf the data isn't there when the warrant comes, you effectively have\nsecure crypto.  If secret backups are kept...then you effectively have\nno crypto.  Thus, this poster is essentialy arguing no crypto is better\nthan secure crypto.\n\nIf the data isn't there when the warrant comes, then the government will\njust have to use normal law enforcement techniques to catch crooks.  Is\nthis so bad?   BTW, bugging isn't YET a normal law enforcement technique.\nWith the privacy clipper, it WILL become a normal technique.\n/Jim
My thoughts on why the algorithm is secret :\n\n   The chip is (regretably) likely to become a standard.   There will\n   be many applications where economic factors dictate use of this\n   chip, like it or not.\n\n   If the alrogithm is public, and the code is as secure (absent the \n   access to escrowed keys) as represented, an enterprising sort \n   would make "compatible crypto chips for which no key had been\n   escrowed".  This is likely what the release was refering to when \n   they refered to the secrecy of the algorithm protecting the\n   security of the escrow system.

Send mail to help@penet.fi for information.\n \n  Hal Finney has contributed an instruction manual for the cypherpunk\n  remailers on the ftp site soda.berkeley.edu (128.32.149.19):\n  pub/cypherpunks/hal's.instructions. See also scripts.tar.Z (UNIX\n  scripts to aid remailer use) and anonmail.arj (MSDOS batch files to\n  aid remailer use).\n\n  ebrandt@jarthur.claremont.edu\n  -----------------------------\n    Anonymized mail.

Request information from above address.\n\n  phantom@mead.u.washington.edu \n  -----------------------------\n    Experimental remailer with encryption to server.  `finger' site\n    address for information.\n\n  Notes\n  =====\n  \n  - Cypherpunk remailers tend to be unstable because they are often\n    running without site administrator knowledge. Liability issues\n    are wholly unresolved.\n  \n  - So far, all encryption is based on public-key cryptography and PGP\n    software (see the question on cryptography). \n\n  - Encryption aspects (message text, destination address, replies)\n    vary between sites.\n\n  - Multiple chaining, alias unlinking, and address encryption are\n    mostly untested, problematic, or unsupported at this time.\n\n_____\n<8.2> What are the responsibilities associated with anonymity?\n\n  \n  Users\n  -----\n\n  - Use anonymity only if you have to. Frivolous uses weaken the\n    seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others.\n  - Do not use anonymity to provoke, harass, or threaten others.\n  - Do not hide behind anonymity to evade established conventions on\n    Usenet,  such as posting binary pictures to regular newsgroups.\n  - If posting large files, be attentive to bandwidth considerations.\n    Remember, simply sending the posting to the service increases\n    network traffic.\n  - Avoid posting anonymously to the regular hierarchy of Usenet; this\n    is the mostly likely place to alienate readers. The `alt'\n    hierarchy is preferred.\n  - Give as much information as possible in the posting (i.e.\n    references, etc.) Remember that content is the only means for\n    readers to judge the truth of the message, and that any\n    inaccuracies will tend to discredit the entire message and even\n    future ones under the same handle.\n  - Be careful not to include information that will reveal your\n    identity or enable someone to deduce it.  Test the system by\n    sending anonymized mail to yourself.\n  - Be aware of the policies of the anonymous site and respect them. \n    Be prepared to forfeit your anonymity if you abuse the privilege.\n  - Be considerate and respectful of other's objections to anonymity.\n  - ``Hit-and-run'' anonymity should be used with utmost reservation.\n    Use services that provide anonymous return addresses instead.\n  - Be courteous to the system operator, who may have invested large\n    amounts of time, be personally risking his account, or dedicating\n    his hardware, all for your convenience.\n\n  Operators\n  ---------\n\n  - Document thoroughly acceptable and unacceptable uses in an\n    introductory file that is sent to new users.  Have a coherent and\n    consistent policy and stick to it. State clearly what logging and\n    monitoring is occurring. Describe your background, interest, and\n    security measures. Will the general approach be totalitarian or\n    lassaiz-faire?\n  - Formulate a plan for problematic ethical situations and anticipate\n    potentially intense moral quandaries and dilemmas. What if a user\n    is blackmailing someone through your service? What if a user\n    posts suicidal messages through your service? Remember, your\n    users trust you to protect them.\n  - In the site introductory note, give clear examples  of situations\n    where you will take action and what these actions will be (e.g.\n    warn the user, limit anonymity to email or posting only, revoke\n    the account, 'out' the user, contact local administrator, etc.)\n  - Describe exactly the limitations of the software and hardware.\n    Address the bandwidth limitations of your site. Report candidly\n    and thoroughly all bugs that have  occurred.  Work closely with\n    users to isolate and fix bugs. Address all bugs noted below under\n    ``(in)stability of anonymity''.\n  - Document the stability of the site---how long has it been running?\n    What compromises have occured? Why are you running it? What is\n    your commitment to it?\n  - Include a disclaimer in outgoing mail and messages.  Include an\n    address for complaints, ideally appended to every outgoing item. \n    Consult a lawyer about your liability.\n  - Be committed to the long-term stability of the site. Be prepared\n    to deal with complaints and `hate mail' addressed to you.  If you\n    do not own the hardware the system runs on or are not the system\n    adminstrator, consult those who do and are.\n  - Be considerate of providing anonymity to various groups.  If\n    possible, query group readers.\n  - Keep a uniformity and simplicity of style in outgoing message\n    format that can be screened effectively by kill files.  Ensure\n    the key text `Anon' is  somewhere in every header.\n  - Take precautions to ensure the security of the server from\n    physical and  network-based attacks and infiltrations.\n\n  Readers\n  -------\n  \n  - Do not complain, attack, or discredit a poster for the sole reason\n    that he is posting anonymously, make blanket condemnations that\n    equate anonymity with cowardice and criminality, or assail\n    anonymous traffic in general for mostly neutral reasons (e.g. its\n    volume is heavy or increasing).\n  - React to the anonymous information unemotionally.  Abusive posters\n    will be encouraged further if they get irrationally irate\n    responses.  Sometimes the most effective response is silence.\n  - Notify operators if very severe abuses occur, such as piracy,\n    harassment, extortion, etc.\n  - Do not complain about postings being inappropriate because they\n    offend you personally.\n  - Use kill files to screen anonymous postings if you object to the\n    idea of anonymity itself.\n  - Avoid the temptation to proclaim that all anonymous postings\n    should be barred from particular groups because no `possible' or\n    `conceivable' need exists.\n\n  References\n  ----------\n  \n  See e.g. ftp.eff.org:/pub/academic/anonymity:\n\n  > This article is an excerpt from an issue of FIDONEWS on individual\n  > privacy and the use of handles.  It accepts the need of a system\n  > operator to know the name of a user; but suggests that the use of\n  > a handle is analogous to a request to withhold the name in a\n  > letter to the editor.

Not perfect and won't\n  > kill followups. \n  \n  Note that anonymous server operators have the capability to mask\n  anonymous postings under which the above method will not work; so\n  far this practice is not widespread, but it may become more common\n  as a countermeasure to widespread anonymous filtering.\n  \n_____\n<8.4> What is the history behind anonymous posting servers?\n\n  Originally anonymous posting services were introduced for\n  individual, particularly volatile newsgroups, where anonymity is\n  almost the preferred method of communication, such as talk.abortion\n  and alt.sex.bondage.  One of the first was one by Dave Mack\n  started in ~1988 for alt.sex.bondage. Another early one was\n  wizvax.methuen.ma.us run by Stephanie Gilgut (Gilgut Enterprises)\n  but was disbanded due to  lack of funds.  The system provided\n  anonymous return addresses. n7kbt.rain.com (John Opalko) took up\n  the functions of this server, including reinstating the anonymous\n  alias file. The group ``alt.personals has been chewing through\n  servers like there's no tomorrow.''\n  \n  Spurred by the disappearance of `wizvax' and interested in\n  researching the idea, Karl Kleinpaste\n  <Karl_Kleinpaste@godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu> developed his own system\n  from scratch in six hours. By this time the idea of extending the\n  server to new, more `mainstream'  groups was starting to emerge,\n  and he explored the possibility partly at the specific request  by\n  multiple users for anonymity in other groups. ``The intended\n  advantage of my system was specifically to allow multiple group\n  support, with a single anon identifier across all.  This was\n  arguably the single biggest deficiency of previous anon systems.'' \n  K. Kleinpaste posted a message on rec.nude asking users whether an\n  anonymous service would be welcome there, and judged a consensus\n  against it. \n\n  K. Kleinpaste introduced what he calls a ``fire extinguisher'' to\n  `squelch' or `plonk' abusive users in response to complaints, and\n  used this in three cases. Nevertheless, after a few months of\n  intense traffic he was eventually overwhelmed by the abuses of his\n  server. ``Even as restricted as it was, my system was subjected to\n  abuses to the point where it was ordered dismantled by the\n  facilities staff here. Such abuses started right after it was\n  created.''\n\n  In ~Nov 1992, Johan Helsingius (julf@penet.FI) set up the most\n  controversial anonymous site to date. anon.penet.fi is based on\n  scripts and C code written by K. Kleinpaste and supports anonymized\n  mail, posting, and return addresses. He initially wanted to confine\n  the service to Scandinavian users but expanded it to worldwide\n  accessability in response to 'lots' of international requests.\n  \n  J. Helsingius policy of allowing anonymous posting to every Usenet\n  newsgroup has been met with strong and serious ideological\n  opposition (e.g. by news adminstrators in news.admin.policy).\n  Because of the relative newness and recent emergence of the medium,\n  abuses by anonymous posters  tend to have higher visibility than\n  ``routine'' abuses. His total commitment to preservation of\n  anonymity is also controversial.\n\n  For example, in a highly controversial and publicized case in ~Feb\n  1993,  an anonymous user posted a supposed transcript of desperate\n  crew dialogue during the Challenger shuttle disaster via\n  anon.penet.fi to sci.astro. Despite that the transcript had been\n  posted in the same place up to a year earlier (then\n  non-anonymously) and actually originated not with the poster but a\n  New York news tabloid, subsequent responses consisted largely of\n  vociferous outrage at the poster's use of anonymity, reverberating\n  through many newsgroups. \n  \n  The original poster, using the same anonymous handle, later conceded\n  that the story ``seemed likely to have been fabricated,''\n  suggesting the plausible possibility that the original intent was\n  not to provoke outrage but gauge reactions on the authenticity of\n  the story (albeit crudely), free of personal risk from perceived\n  association with the item.  The ensuing commotion generated queries\n  for the original article by late-entering readers. The anonymous\n  user later posted deliberately offensive comments at his\n  detractors.\n\n  Despite piercingly irate and outraged complaints, and even the vocal\n  opposition and verbal abuse of K. Kleinpaste and eminent news\n  operators, J. Helsingius has largely avoided use of the ``fire\n  extingisher'' and the ``group bouncer'' mechanisms that limit the\n  scope of the service. As of ~March 1993 the anon.penet.fi site is\n  best described as `inundated': it has registered over 13,000 users\n  in its initial three months of operation, forwards ~3000 messages a\n  day, and approximately 5% of all Usenet postings are anonymized\n  through the site. The immense popularity is probably largely due\n  to the capability for `global' anonymity which has allowed users to\n  find creative uses in diverse areas not previously envisioned.\n\n  Johan Helsingius has been subject to extraordinary pressure to\n  dismantle his server in ~Feb 1993. At one point K. Kleinpaste\n  threatened publicly to organize a sort of vigilante group of irate\n  news operators to  send out revocation commands on all messages\n  originating from the site.  J. Helsingius has also alluded to\n  threats of flooding the  server.  The server has crashed several\n  times, at least once due to a saturation `mailbombing' through it\n  by an anonymous user.  Mr. Helsingius reports spending up to 5\n  hours per day  answering email requests alone associated with the\n  service's administration. In response to the serious threats he\n  disabled global group access temporarily for one week and\n  encouraged his users to defend the service publicly.\n  \n  Based on fast-moving dialogue and creative suggestions by\n  ``cypherpunks,'' J. Helsingius has identified many security\n  weaknesses and valuable new features for the service, and is\n  currently in the process of code development and testing. He is\n  planning on upgrading the IBM compatible 386 machine to a 486 soon\n  to handle the voluminous load and is  considering integrating a new\n  system with very sophisticated functionality, including multiple\n  email aliases, alias allocation control, public-key encryption,\n  etc.\n\n  A very sophisticated anonymous posting system was set up in Dec.\n  1992 by D. Clunie <dclunie@pax.tpa.com.au> that used cryptography\n  in both directions (to/from) the server for the highest degree of\n  confidentiality seen so far.  However, it was running on a public\n  access account, and he had to shut it down after only several\n  weeks, upon receiving requests and conditions apparently ultimately\n  originating from NSF representatives. D. Clunie has released the\n  software to the public domain.\n\n  Recently the idea of a newsgroup devoted to `whistleblowing' on\n  government abuses has received wide and focused attention, and\n  group formation is currently underway.  In the basic scenario the\n  group would allow people to post pseudonymously using remailers,\n  and even establish reputations based on their authentifiable\n  digital signatures. The traffic may eventually reach reporters in\n  the mainstream news media.  deltorto@aol.com has volunteered to\n  attack multiple aspects of this project, including distributing\n  easy-to-read documentation on posting, anonymization, and\n  encryption.\n\n  See also sections on ``views on anonymous posting'' below and ``what\n  is going on with anon.penet.fi?'' in this document.\n  \n  (Thanks to Carl Kleinpaste\n  <Karl_Kleinpaste@godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu>, David Clunie\n  <dclunie@pax.tpa.com.au> and Johan Helsingius <julf@penet.fi> for\n  contributions here.)\n\n\n_____\n<8.5> What is the value of anonymity?\n\n  KONDARED@PURCCVM.BITNET:\n    \n  > I think anonymous posts do help in focusing our attention on the\n  > content of one's message.

Instead of reading between the lines, try to think a little bit. OK,\nif that's way too difficult to you, here are some hints.\n\nIndeed, the new proposal imposes some additional burocratic burden on\nthe local police, if they badly want to tape the magic cookie recipie\nthat your mom is telling you on the phone.

I think I should also point out that the mystical DES engines\nare known plaintext engines (unless you add a ton of really smart\nhardware?)\n\n	The 'plaintext' is digitized voice, and exists for a very short\ntime, probably in a couple inches of copper, tops. It's flatly not\navailable -- your bug in my office can hear my voice, and even digitize\nit, but it's going to get a different bitstream.\n\n	It is horribly naive to suppose that regular folks can figure\nout how to crack skipjack, or clipper based telephones. I'm certainly\nnot devoting a great deal of thought to it.
I think this to be inaccurate. One can buy TEMPEST equipment commercially.\nEven Macs.\n\nDavid
It just occurred to me why the algorithm is secret.  If it were\npublished, one could then build physically identical clone versions\nof the chip that would interoperate with official Clipper chips.  But\nthe cloner wouldn't provide the keys to the escrow houses.  Hmmn.\n\nOr is there a technical hack that I've missed?  E.g. how about if the\nchips were made unprogrammed but serialized, and then shipped to the\ntwo escrow houses who programmed in their halves of the keys, but\nin a way that requires that secret keys known only to the escrow houses\nbe installed as well, without which clone versions wouldn't\ninteroperate?  This is getting awfully complicated, but that's\ncrypto for you.

And in Russia, capitalists were persecuted for trading goods on the\nblack market.

The computer, err, government, is your friend.  Have a nice day (under\npenalty of law).
Without getting into the *really* *thorny* questions about reverse\nengineering and all of that, let me just point out that there already\nexist gate arrays and suchlike that have what's known as a security fuse\nwhich can be programmed after you've verified all other programming --\nthis makes it impossible to read out the programming of the device\n(again, ignoring the reverse engineering questions).  Speaking from\nexperience here: I had to completely reinvent one of my designs some\nsix or seven years ago when the disk file was zapped, the backups were\nall bad, and the devices were unreadable because of the security fuses.\nMade me appreciate the value of printouts.  ;-)\n\nSo on this point at least there's not so much worry.\n\nBut whether or not we can get the chips made reliably and securely is\nreally secondary to the question of whether use of the chip is itself\nlikely to be secure, methinks.
WRONG:  I don't think even PKP claims this one.  It is not unlawful to\ndistribute code implementing RSA.  It appears to be unlawful to use it, so\nI agree with your last sentence.\n\n\nYes, that's correct.
: Here is a disturbing thought.\n....good stuff elided....\n: Don't pretend that no one unauthorized will ever get their hands on\n: the escrow databases.\n: \n.......\n: secret. The escrow databases aren't the sorts of secrets that our\n: teachers told us about, but they are the sort of big secrets they\n: would lump into this category. Imagine trying to replace 100 million\n: Clipper chips.\n\nSounds to me like a *great* gimmick for a replacement market...every\nso often issue a "Clipper Alert" announcing that some key backup tapes\nare missing, that some Drug Lords got 'em, whatever. Then the owners\nof these $1200 Clipperphones have to trot down to their local Key\nEscrow Agency and buy new chips and have them programmed.\n\nMicrotoxin, the Clipper supplier, will make a killing...maybe this was\nthe real idea. (Anybody know if Janet Reno has stock in Microtoxin,\nVLSI Technology, or AT&T?)\n\nCould be a good opportunity to undermine this with some\ndisinformation: float rumors that the key database has been stolen.\nAll the chips need replacing. It angers people, undermines confidence\neven more, and kills sales.\n\nAfter the Waco Massacre and the Big Brother Wiretap Chip, any tactic\nis fair.\n\n-Tim May
Nothing but errors and omissions here!
I somehow started to doubt technical competence of the\npeople who designed the system.  Why on the Earth split the\n80-bit key in 40-bit parts to keep them in escrow separately\n(having 40 bit and large volumes of data voice links produce\nit should be relatively easy to break it) when they simply\ncould keep 80-bit sequences in N (N>=2) independent places\nand then XOR all the partial keys to get the actual key (N-1\nsequences should obviously be selected randomly and Nth is the\nactual key XOR-ed with the random sequences).\n\n(Or is it a conspiracy? 1/2 :-)
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\n\n\n\nThe point you all seem to have missed was covered when the UK cellphone\nscrambling system was discussed.  Incidentally, my MP has responded to\nmy questions on that issue, and it appears that the UK and other `approved'\ncountries will get the secure A5 encryption, and `dodgy' countries will\nget A5X.  Existing mobile equipment will drop to clear mode when used with\nA5X systems, but newer equipment will use A5/A5X/clear depending on the\ncapabilities of the base station.\n\nThe cops/feds do *not* need to be able to get hold of your private key to\nlisten in to cellular conversations.  Encryption is not end-to-end, but \ncellphone to base-station - it *has* to be this way so that cellular users\nand fixed installations can talk to each other.  For cellular to cellular\ncalls, the transmission is decrypted at the base-station, passed to another\nbase-station and re-encrypted.  The cops/feds can listen to the unscrambled\ncall *provided* they get a warrant to tap into the cellular provider's\nequipment.  The only reason for wanting a crackable system is so they can\nlisten without having to obtain a warrant.\n\nBut, maybe the Clipper system is secure, and they really do need a warrant\nto get the key out of escrow before they can listen in using a scanner (see\nabove - they don't *have* to go down this route anyway).  I have my doubts,\nbut even if true once they have the key they will *never* again need a\nwarrant to tap into that particular phone whenever they want.  `Well, Judge,\nit appears he wasn't a drug-dealer after all, so naturally we'll stop\nlistening in'...\n\nYou have every reason to be scared shitless.

With all the talk about this Clipper chip, I have developed one question...\n\n			HOW DOES IT WORK???\n\nIf you use this, then how does it get decrypted on the other end? Does the\nother party (receiving the phone call/mail/etc) have to know some code to \nundo it? Do I use a different method for calling one party than I would for \nanother?. If the other party can decrypt it, doesn't that mean that someone\nelse could also? I assume that if everyone has a different key, the only use\nwould be storing secure data for later retrieval by the same key. This seems\nlike a fundamental question to me, but I have very little experience with\ncryptosystems, other than DES. If someone could give me an explanation as\nto how it would be used (remember that I have had little experience with\nthis sort of thing) it would be very much appreciated.
ONLY IF this chip catches on. Which means alternatives have to be\ndeveloped. Which will only happen if Clipper is discredited.

Hate to mess up your point, but it is incredibly easy to learn how\nto make a nuclear weapon.  The hard part is getting the radioactives to\nput in it.  Have you ever read Tom Clancy's _The Sum of All Fears_?  It\ndescribes in great detail how a Palestinian terrorist group constructed a\nnuclear bomb using stolen (actually found) plutonium, with some help from\nan East German nuclear physicist.  For some non fiction, read Tom Clancy's\narticle _Five Minutes Till Midnight_.  It shows how a terrorist group could\nconstruct a nuke using Neptunium, a low grade radioactive waste product\ndumped in toxic waste sites and forgotten about.  He also claims information\non constructing a nuke is easily found in any large library.  Sounds\nkind of scary, doesn't it? :-(\n\n\n	Don't know whether you could get busted for warning of a speedtrap.\n\nDoug Holland\n\n--
[...]\n\n(the date I have for this is 1-26-93)\n\nnote Clinton's statements about encryption in the 3rd paragraph..  I guess\nthis statement doesen't contradict what you said, though.\n\n--- cut here ---
I wish I could agree with you.  Ask yourself this.  Why would any private\nsector entity wish to buy a crypto system that was KNOWN to be at least\npartially compromised? (Key escrows in this instance)  Why would any\nprivate sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that had not been properly\nevaluated?  (i.e. algorythm not publically released)\nThe answer seems obvious to me, they wouldn't.  There is other hardware out\nthere not compromised.  DES as an example (triple DES as a better one.)\n\nMy suspicion is that the prices will drop dramatically on these non clipper\nsystems.  If not we're in trouble.\n\nGiven that the Clinton administration is not entirely stupid (although we'd like\nto think so) I cannot believe that they have failed to realize this.\nThey know their initiative will fail, much as crippled DES was never taken\nseriously.  The only way their moves can work is by coercion.  You know\nlittle about politics if you don't realize that this is just a first step\nin the next move, it makes NO sense otherwise.  The next move, banning\nor SEVERLY crippling crypto not using the "Clipper" system is easily\njustified "Why would anyone want other encryption unless they were trying\nto subvert the government?  We've provided you with a very secure alternative\nso use it or go to jail/be fined/whatever."\nHow can you reconcile the administrations self proclaimed purpose of providing\nlaw enforcement with access to encrypted data without making the clipper system\nthe only crypto available in the U.S... ?  You simply can't, and the administration\nknows it.  Anyone who wanted to keep the govt. out of their hair, be it for\ndrug dealing or whatever, would just buy still available non-clipper systems.\n\nDon't sell our crafty Clinton types short, they can't be THAT stupid.\nEither banning non clipper crypto is the next answer or the administrations\ncollective I.Q. is about that of a potato.\n\nWhy do you think AT&T jumped on so fast?  They know it's going to be big,\nand NOT because it's better.  Right on the face of it, noone will buy the\nstuff that doesn't have to.  AT&T must know this too, THINK MAN, why the\nhell would they jump the gun?\n\n\nI really wonder.\n\nTo wit:  The letter I just sent to Clinton:\n\nThe White House\nOffice of the Press Secretary c/o:\nPresidential Comment Line (fax)\n(202) 456-2461\n \nApril 17, 1993\n \nSir and/or Madam:\n \n \nI must object most strongly to the administrations evolving position on encryption and\ncryptography.  I am shocked at the Clinton regimes increasing lean towards a authoritarian approach with regard to privacy and freedom from government oversight in day to day life.\n \nIt is apparent to me that those who drafted the "Clipper Chip Proposal" (which is, incidentally, gaining notoriety as the "Big Brother Proposal") are either incredibly ignorant or very sly indeed.  Anyone knowledgeable in the nuances of cryptographic development and research must understand that a key step in the development of a new algorithm, especially one destined for standardization, is the full disclosure of the algorithm to the private and academic sectors.  The proper evaluation of an algorithm dep\n\n\n\n\n\nends on careful scrutiny by these sectors, and only such scrutiny can provide true public confidence in the security of the algorithm.  The assumption that a new algorithm will be accepted based on assurances from "experts" without full disclosure is plain ignorance.\n \nIn addition, the assumption that an algorithm will be marketable over other technology, such as DES, when it is characterized by key escrow is lunacy.  It seems an easy step in the logic chain that probable consumers will prefer to purchase equipment not crippled by government key escrow, no matter how "tamper proof" the key escrows might be.\n \nI cannot believe that even the least educated policy maker would have failed to realize these flaws.  I can only assume then that the drafters of the "Clipper Chip Proposal" knew very well the difficulties of selling a crippled system to the private sector.  The only way this proposal makes any sense, or has any chance of succeeding is in coercion.  Even the language of the proposal makes it painfully clear that the next logical step is the outlawing of other encryption devices and hardware that do not uti\n\n\n\n\n\nlize the "Big Brother Chip."\n \nUnfortunately the public at large is not educated enough on the issue to realize what they are losing.  I expect the Big Brother proposal to encounter little resistance from the American people who you will have so efficiently duped once again with pretty words like "harmony," "right to encryption," and "voluntary."\n \nIt mortifies me that the phrase that seems to be used more and more often to characterize the Clinton administration is "I can't believe it's happening here."  More startling is a question a colleague of mine posed and the realization that everyday it becomes more and more relevant; "When is the Reichstag fire planned for?"\n \n \n						Most Concerned,\n \n						[Signature]\n						Shaen Logan Bernhardt I\nuni@acs.bu.edu
Read it again yourself, then re-apply the admonition you gave to the\nprevious poster to yourself, as well.  The first clause is not a condition,\nit is a reason for explicitly supporting the right WHICH EXISTS, MILITIA\nOR NOT, that the people have a right to keep and bear arms.  This is\nNOT a right granted by the Constitution, it is a right presumed to exist\nby default.  The Constitution mentioning a right is to prevent the\ngovernment from removing that right by stating very clearly the government\nshall NOT infringe (mess with, block, limit) that right.  Remember the\nConstitution is a bunch of negative things - things the government CANNOT\ndo.  All rights, etc not epxressly given to the government go to the\nstates and the PEOPLE (the same people the other 9 Amendments in the\nBill of Rights talk about).\n\nSince I am sure you will summarily reject my interpretation, I am\nappending a linguistic analysis by one far more expert than myself (and\nyou, I suspect).  I am sure you will find his qualifications adequate.\nIf that isn't enough I can send you the Senate Subcommitee to the\nJudiciary on the Constitution report on the same thing...  There are\nsome things in there that Big Brother types, like Biden, etc must have\nreally had to swallow hard to admit.\n\nI think you will find that people that seriously study the Constitution\nand state what it means will say the same thing.  Those who come up\nwith 'new improved meanings' are those who are trying to subvert the\nConstitution for a given agenda.  Like Clinton and his Clinton Cripple,\nGun Control, People Control, and Control Control, and the whole nasty\nmess.\n\nPlease tell us how this person is in error, won't you? (And please back it\nup with some proof, since I am backing my assertion up with independent\nproof, and have a BUNCH MORE I can provide...).\n\nNOTE:  Followups set to talk.politics.guns\n\n--------- Begin included article -------\n\n			THE UNABRIDGED SECOND AMENDMENT\n\n			      by J. Neil Schulman\n\nIf you wanted to know all about the Big Bang, you'd ring up Carl Sagan,\nright ?  And if you wanted to know about desert warfare, the man to call\nwould be Norman Schwarzkopf, no question about it.  But who would you call\nif you wanted the top expert on American usage, to tell you the meaning\nof the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ?\n\nThat was the question I asked A.C. Brocki, editorial coordinator of the Los\nAngeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at Houghton\nMifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the\nforemost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system.  Mr.\nBrocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud, a retired professor\njournalism at the University of Southern California and the author of\n"American Usage and Style: The Consensus."\n\nA little research lent support to Brocki's opinion of Professor Copperud's\nexpertise.\n\nRoy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades\nbefore embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at\nUSC.  Since 1952, Copperud has been writing a column dealing with the\nprofessional aspects of journalism for "Editor and Publisher", a weekly\nmagazine focusing on the journalism field.\n\nHe's on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, and Merriam\nWebster's Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert.  Copperud's\nfifth book on usage, "American Usage and Style: The Consensus," has been in\ncontinuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981, and is the winner\nof the Association of American Publisher's Humanities Award.\n\nThat sounds like an expert to me.\n\nAfter a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introduced\nmyself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested, I sent\nthe following letter:\n\n"I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in\nEnglish usage, to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution, and extract the intent from the text.\n\n"The text of the Second Amendment is, 'A well-regulated Militia, being\nnecessary for the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep\nand bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'\n\n"The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the\nsentence, 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a\nfree State', is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause, with respect\nto the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence, 'the\nright of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'\n\n"I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into\nconsideration issues of political impact or public policy, but be restricted\nentirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent.  Further,\nsince your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation\nregarding the consequences of the Second Amendment, I ask that whatever\nanalysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to\nstand behind with your reputation, and even be willing to testify under\noath to support, if necessary."\n\nMy letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment,\nthen concluded:\n\n"I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task\nwith this letter.  I am doing so because, as a citizen, I believe it is\nvitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment.\nWhile I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of\nits results, I ask that you do this because of that importance."\n\nAfter several more letters and phone calls, in which we discussed terms for\nhis doing such an analysis, but in which we never discussed either of our\nopinions regarding the Second Amendment, gun control, or any other political\nsubject, Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which I have\ninserted my questions for the sake of clarity):\n\n[Copperud:] "The words 'A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the\nsecurity of a free state,' contrary to the interpretation cited in your\nletter of July 26, 1991, constitutes a present participle, rather than a\nclause.  It is used as an adjective, modifying 'militia,' which is\nfollowed by the main clause of the sentence (subject 'the right', verb\n'shall').  The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for\nmaintaining a militia.\n\n"In reply to your numbered questions:\n\n[Schulman:] "(1) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep\nand bear arms solely to 'a well-regulated militia'?"\n\n[Copperud:] "(1) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear\narms, nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by\nothers than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respect\nto a right of the people."\n\n[Schulman:] "(2) Is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms' granted\nby the words of the Second Amendment, or does the Second Amendment assume a\npreexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms, and merely state\nthat such right 'shall not be infringed'?"\n\n[Copperud:] "(2) The right is not granted by the amendment; its existence\nis assumed.  The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be\npreserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia."\n\n[Schulman:] "(3) Is the right of the people to keep and bear arms\nconditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia, is, in fact\nnecessary to the security of a free State, and if that condition is not\nexisting, is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,\nshall not be infringed' null and void?"\n\n[Copperud:] "(3) No such condition is expressed or implied.  The right to\nkeep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence\nof a militia.  No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the\nright to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated\nmilitia as a requisite to the security of a free state.  The right to keep\nand bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence."\n\n[Schulman:] "(4) Does the clause 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary\nto the security of a free State,' grant a right to the government to place\nconditions on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms,' or is such\nright deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence?"\n\n[Copperud:] "(4) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional, as\npreviously stated.  It is invoked here specifically for the sake of the\nmilitia."\n\n[Schulman:] "(5) Which of the following does the phrase 'well-regulated\nmilitia' mean: 'well-equipped', 'well-organized,' 'well-drilled,'\n'well-educated,' or 'subject to regulations of a superior authority'?"\n\n[Copperud:] "(5) The phrase means 'subject to regulations of a superior\nauthority;' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian\ncontrol over the military."\n\n[Schulman:] "(6) (If at all possible, I would ask you to take account the\nchanged meanings of words, or usage, since that sentence was written 200\nyears ago, but not take into account historical interpretations of the\nintents of the authors, unless those issues can be clearly separated."\n\n[Copperud:] "To the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in the\nmeaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the\namendment.  If it were written today, it might be put: "Since a\nwell-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state, the\nright of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.'\n\n[Schulman:] "As a 'scientific control' on this analysis, I would also\nappreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the Second\nAmendment to the following sentence,\n\n"A well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the security of a free\nState, the right of the people to keep and read Books, shall not be\ninfringed.'\n\n"My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be,\n\n"(1) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way\nthe words modify each other, identical to the Second Amendment's sentence?;\nand\n\n"(2) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the people\nto keep and read Books' _only_ to 'a well-educated electorate' -- for\nexample, registered voters with a high-school diploma?"\n\n[Copperud:] "(1) Your 'scientific control' sentence precisely parallels the\namendment in grammatical structure.\n\n"(2) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the\npossibility of a restricted interpretation."\n\nProfessor Copperud had only one additional comment, which he placed in his\ncover letter: "With well-known human curiosity, I made some speculative\nefforts to decide how the material might be used, but was unable to reach\nany conclusion."\n\nSo now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage what\nmany knew all along: the Constitution of the United States unconditionally\nprotects the people's right to keep and bear arms, forbidding all\ngovernments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right.\n\nAs I write this, the attempted coup against constitutional government in the\nSoviet Union has failed, apparently because the will of the people in that\npart of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the\nold guard's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power.\n\nAnd here in the United States, elected lawmakers, judges, and appointed\nofficials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States\nignore, marginalize, or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely.\nAmerican citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms, owning\narms of forbidden sorts, or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements\nregarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an\nabridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms,\nguaranteed by the Constitution.\n\nAnd even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), staunch defender of the\nrest of the Bill of Rights, stands by and does nothing.\n\nit seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to\npreserve that right.  no one else will.  No one else can.  Will we beg our\nelected representatives not to take away our rights, and continue regarding\nthem as representing us if they do?  Will we continue obeying judges who\ndecide that the Second Amendment doesn't mean what it says it means but\nmeans whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak ?\n\nOr will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice, as the Constitution\nof the United States promises us we can, and pledge that we will defend\nthat promise with our lives, our fortuned, and our sacred honor ?\n\n(C) 1991 by The New Gun Week and Second Amendment Foundation.\nInformational reproduction of the entire article is hereby authorized\nprovided the author, The New Gun Week and Second Amendment Foundation are\ncredited.

At the company I worked for previously, I received a file that was des encryped\nand the person that had sent it, went on vaction.  Rather than wait two weeks\nI set up a straight frontal attack with one key at a time.  It only took two(2)\ndays to crack the file.  No, I don't have any faith in DES.\n\nA.G.
The willingness of the majority of the people to give up their freedom in \nexchange for a sense of safety is hardly limited to the USA, and is an \nendemic problem in any human society of any appreciable size.  The structure \nof the US government does try to combat this tendency to some extent, but \nfighting entropy is always a losing battle.  Most people would rather have \ncomfort than freedom.  The paradox is that you can't really have the former, \nin the long term, unless you have the latter.\n\nOne of the reasons that I probably come across to some people as a weird \ncross between a libertarian and an "establishment tool" is that I end up \ntaking an utterly pragmatic view of government.  I don't get up in arms when \nthe government fails to protect the interests of the people, because in my \nlifetime it never has--therefore, I have no expectation that it will.  \n\nAs a result, I protect my own interests rather than expecting the government \nto be "fair".  I will use strong cryptography when I think it is needed, \nwhether or not it is legal at the time.  Same thing with anything else the \ngovernment would rather not see in private hands--that's their problem.  \nWhat's important to me is using the right tool for the job.  If it's legal, \nso much the better.  If it is not, but does not violate my (very strong) \nsense of personal ethics, I will use it anyway as long I think it is worth \nit.  Expecting the government to actually protect the interests of its \ncitizens, except by accident, is utter folly.  Even Jefferson, one of the \nmajor architects of the American system of government, figured that in a \ncouple hundred years it would become so corrupt and self-serving that it \nwould be time dismantle it and try again, by revolution if necessary.  I \nagree, and while I don't go around trying to spark one, I'll certainly \nparticipate if it happens when I'm around.  There is a reason I am such a \nstrong supporter of individual rights while being so cynical about politics.  \nI've already written off politics.\n\nAnd yes, this may get me in trouble some day.  If so, so be it.  I drive \nfaster than 55 MPH, too.
Some countries have laws about importing crypto gear--I believe the U.S.\ndoes. Without a license the above scheme won't work (at least not legally)\nin such countries, including at least France and the U.S.\n\nDavid
After IBM had invented the DES and the NBS had advertised for proposals,\nbut before IBM had decided to respond, I argued strenuously that they \nshould not; they should keep it proprietary. \n\nThe biggest proponent of proposing was Dr. Lewis Branscomb.  Dr. Branscomb\nwas the IBM Chief Scientist and had come to IBM from NBS.  Fortunately\nfor all of us, Dr. Branscomb understood the answer to the above question\nmuch better than I.  He realized how difficult it would be to gain\nacceptance for any cryptographic mechanism.  Because of the necessary\ncomplexity, publicity would not be sufficient and neither would \nauthority.  In fact, it has taken both of those plus more than 15 \nyears.\n\nWe have also had independence.  The DES was solicited by NBS, invented\nand proposed by IBM, and vetted by NBS.  It has also been examined and\nvetted by experts like Adi Shamir, who are not subject to influence by\nany of these.\n\nEven now, there are still people posting on this list who do not trust\nthe DES in spite of all the time, all of the analysis, and all of the\npublic scrutiny.\n\n(Of course, it is just this point that NIST misses when it attempts to \ngain acceptance for a novel mechanism, developed in secret, on the basis\nof authority alone.)\n\nWe had a long thread here about whether or not the NSA can "break" the\nDES.  That is a silly question.  At some cost and in some time they\ncan "break" anything.  The important question is at what cost and in\nwhat time.\n\nThe fundamental strength of the DES and RSA are not nearly so important\nas what we know about their strength.  As long as we understand the\ncost and duration for an attacker, then we can use them in a safe way.\nAt this point, we may never replace either because of the inability of\nany successor to overcome this knowledge gap.\n\nDES and RSA are among the most significant inventions of the century\nand the most important inventions in the history of cryptography.\nWe are damned lucky to have them.
False, as federal courts have affirmed on many occasions.  This is getting \nout of sci.crypt territory, though...
Looking for PostScript or Tex version of a paper called:\n	"PUBLIC-KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY"\n\nWritten by:\n	James Nechvatal\n	Security Technology Group\n	National Computer Systems Laboratory\n	National Institute of Standards and Technology\n	Gaithersburg, MD 20899\n\n	December 1990\n\nThe version I obtained is plain text and all symbolic character\nformatting has been lost.
From: andersom@spot.Colorado.EDU (Marc Anderson)\n\n	>Also.. how about a box that you plug your phone into, which would allow\n	>encrypted voice communications with someone who has a similar box?  \n	>(digitizing input speech, transmitting, and decrypting on the other end).  I \n	>don't know how a public-key system could work in this regard, but it might \n	[...]\n\n	heh heh... I posted this just before reading all the Clinton Chip messages..\n	I guess they beat me to it..  Anyway, I think it would be a great idea to\n	develop such a product, perhaps in the underground, as it would otherwise\n	probably become illegal pretty quickly here...\n\nIt's really very feasible and shouldn't be too expensive - all that's needed\nis a box with a phone jack on one side, a DSP in the middle to do codec\nfunctions of speech->compressed bytestream, and an RS232 on the other side.\n\nYou'd plug your phone into it, plug the RS232 into your computer, and have\na good old fashioned normal modem on your other RS232 port.  The CPU in the\nmiddle would do the encryption with a version of pgp modified to work on\na byte stream.\n\nWith v32bis or better modems to carry the bytestream, it should work. \nQuality would only be marginally lower than a normal telephone.\n\nAt the very highest price, you could use one of those voice-mail compatible\nmodems to do the digitisation - that puts an upper bound of about $500 on\nthe cost of such a box.  In practice, you really ought to be able to get\nthe price well below $100 - I could do it now in software on my cheap&nasty\nhome RISC box (Acorn Archimedes) with the digitising microphone I bought\nfor 25 pounds, if I knew how to write good speech compression software\n(which I don't).\n\nThe reason it won't work of course is that hardly anyone will have one -\nthe only consumer equipment to have encryption will use the wiretap chip.\nEconomics, I'm afraid.\n\nHowever... we can get about 2Kcps throughput on the internet even with\nthe bottleneck of a v32bis modem.  When we get ISDN for all (ha ha ha)\nand the new NREN, it might then be trivial to run compressed speech\nover a tcp/ip connection on the Internet.  Perhaps we should start\nthinking now of a standard to keep voice on the internet compatible\nfor everyone, and side-step the clipper stuff and use internet for\nall our phone calls in future :-)  [1/2 joking]
:It occurs to me that if they get a wiretap order on you, and the escrow\n:houses release your code to the cops, your code is now no longer secure.\n\nA very good point!\n\n:It's in the hands of cops, and while I am sure most of the time they are\n:good, their security will not be as good as the escrow houses.\n\nWhy should we expect the cops to be honest!  They're underpaid\nfor the risks they face every day.  The media dumps on the all\nthe time and blames them for all sorts of discrimination,\nbrutality....  How can we expect them to be more than human?\n\nBesides there are lots of cases of police abuses ranging from\nprotection scams to outright robbery (when I worked in D.C. there\nwas a breakin at a local Radio Shack and the alarm company heard the\ncops responding to the call over the audio pickup in the store:-).\n\n:What this effectively means is that if they perform a wiretap on you,\n:at the end of the wiretap, they should be obligated to inform you that\n:a tap was performed, and replace (for free) the clipper chip in your\n:cellular phone so that it is once again a code known only to the\n:escrow houses.\n\nThen you would know that Big Brother had been listening.  Does he\nreally want to let you know?\n\n:Do the police normally reveal every tap they do even if no charges are\n:laid?   In many ways, it would be a positive step if they had to.\n:Judges set time limits on warrants, I assume.  At the end of the time\n:limit they should have to renew or replace your chip.\n\n:That's if we go with this scheme, which I am not sure I agree with.\n\nI'm completely against anything that makes it easier for the\ngovernment to encroach on the rights of individuals.  The\nfounders of this country spent a lot of effort limiting the power\nof the government and specifying exactly what the governments\nrights were (and this didn't include a gov't spy in every\nbedroom).  IMHO, there are entirely too many things going on\ntoday designed to preserve the government organism at the expense\nof individuals.  Look around and reread 1984 and many early\nHeinlein books.  Aren't there many parallels between the thought\npolice (can you spell Waco Texas?), and Heinlein's ``Crazy Years''?\n\nBill
I think you'd have to do some massive data compression just to\nfit a bit of key information on each primary particle of the known\nuniverse.\n	But, hey, it's fun to imagine.
> Clipper might be a good way to cover the use of another layer of\n  > encryption.\n\n  But, if you are making custom equipment in any case, why not just\nroll your own Clipper implementation and report the wrong keys to the\nEscrow agency?  (Tells us who is going to be in the chip business if\nthis thing goes through--NSA, and those with something to hide from\nNSA.)\n\n  If anyone can verify that your phone is not using the key registered\nto that serial number, either:\n\n  1) They have a court ordered wiretap.  But what are they going to\ndo?  Tell the judge that this individual really does have privacy?\nAll they know is that the keys are not enough, but not why.\n\n  2) They have a court ordered wiretap on a phone in this series.\n(This part is really scary.  Since the "expectation" is that all\nchips in a particular batch will uses seeds based on the same S1 and\nS2 and the serial number, getting the keys for one of a batch may give\naccess to all.)\n\n  3) There is a backdoor which allows all messages to be deciphered\nwithout the keys.  I find this one especially threatening since the\nscheme seems very open to known plaintext attacks.  (What I need to\ndecipher is the data in the header.  If I talk to someone who has one\nof these phones, presumably there will be an automatically negotiated\nkey generated.  I'm not trying to decipher the record of the\nconversation to know what was said, I use it as a known plaintext to\nrecover the backdoor represented by the header, but I know what the\nheader says for conversations I participate in.  Even worse, if the\nphones in a series have related keys, I can buy a phone/chip from the\nsame production lot.  Then I can recover its keys, either elegantly by\ntalking to myself, or by brute force analysis of the actual chip, then\napply the key generation process with those seeds to find the target\nkeys.)\n\n    Hmmm!  I don't think I want to ever come close to these phones.\nEven DES is starting to look good.  Two cans and a string will provide\nmuch better security.\n\n\n\n--\n\n					Robert I. Eachus
And in other parts of the world, European "Socialists" would be known as\nfascist capitalist pigs.  Get your head out of your labels and think carefully\nfor once:\n\nAccording to the EFF announcement on this thing, the NSA has been developing\nthis turkey for *four* years.  The manufacturing contract was let *14 months\nago*.  Anyone out there who believes that the fact that Clinton's name was\non this White House announcement means that Bush or any other Republican is\na staunch supporter of personal privacy is a fool.
Excerpts from the Clipper announcement, with some questions:\n\n\n\nIn these two sections the phrases `or other legal order' and `normally a\ncourt order' imply there is some other way or ways of doing a legal\nwiretap. What is/are these? How do they affect the way people who trust the\nsystem of court orders to protect them feel about this escrow system?\n\nThe second section shows the sequence of events.\nThe law enforcer, armed with his warrant, attaches his headphones to the\nline with his croc-clips (remember, these are the folk who couldn't cope\nwith digital telephony) and hears a load of modem-like tones (we are\ntalking analogue telephony here).\nWhat next? What modulation scheme do these Clipper boxes use?\nIs it possible to record the tones for use after the keys are obtained?\nI thought it was quite difficult to record a modem session at some\nintermediate point on the line. Maybe they have taken a crash course\nin data comms and have a unit that demodulates the tones and stores the\ndigital stream for decryption later. This would still suffer from the\nsame problems as trying to record the tones as the demodulator would not\nbe at one end of the line. If calls can't be recorded for decryption later\nit would be quite easy to foil the system by buying lots of Clipper units\n(these are supposed to be cheap mass market items) and using them in turn.\n\nHow tolerant is the modulation scheme to errors? These things are proposed\nfor use by US corporations to secure their foreign offices, where phone\nline quality may well be poor. It seems hard enough to me to get digitised\nspeech of any quality into something a modem can handle without having to\nadd lots of error correction to keep the decryption in sync.\n\n\nThis raises an intersting question in the UK. Here it is illegal to connect\nanything to a public telecomms network without it being approved by a body\ncalled BABT. It has been stated, either here or in the uk.telecom group,\nthat they will not approve equipment that does encryption. I don't know\nif this is true or not, but this would make a good test case.\nPerhaps `friendly' countries, and the UK may still qualify, will get\nto fish in the escrowed key pool as well.
My earlier argument that "Clipper will encourage state and local cops \nto commit criminal acts" is largely moot, now that we've learned that \nthe FBI will perform the actual tap.  [It will encourage the *FBI* to\ncommit (even more) criminal acts, but that's not the point here.]\n\nBut this gives another avenue of attack on the Clipper proposal.  When\nthe EFF/ACLU/CPSR FOIA requests are made, they should ask for details\non the bureaucratic and equipment infrastructure that is proposed (or \neven already budgeted) for the FBI to service tapping requests -- for now\nand the projected future. \n\nFrom these figures, estimate the number of Clipper-tap requests the FBI\nis expecting.  Publish this figure.  Compare it on a per-capita basis\nwith the amount of tapping now known or suspected.\n\nAlso estimate how expensive it would be for the FBI to install more\nClipper-tapping stations, and how rapidly they could be built and\ninstalled ... ie, get the "plus or minus" epsilon for the near future.\n\nMight be a mite disturbing for J. Q. Public to know these things.\n\nAnd despite all the technical details [BTW, thanks to those who've been\nproviding them!], we still don't know \n\n1) how the tapping requests will be transmitted and authenticated (though\n   it isn't too hard to guess a good scheme).\n\n2) how the results will be securely transmitted (Fed Ex the audio tapes?)\n\n3) how privacy will be re-established when an investigation is complete.
How about this:  The\nTelCo has your Clipper key.  The TelCo\nhas your intended partner's key, if he is\nusing one.  Whenever you call, the message\ngets decrypted and reencrypted wihtout\ny key exchange.  I know it's a stupid\nsystem, but for the feds, it'd be\ngreat.  The point of this isn;t to\ntake over the crypto market, BTW.  Clinton\ndoen not want people to have any sort of crypto at\nall (just like Busch).  But he needs some support\nfor the "technology initiative" garbage he's\npushing (industrial policy stuff) and a computer\nhip designed by the gov't is just the thing.\n\nWho's going to thing about the (literal) Billions of\nDollars it took for a government agency to design?
In most cases information you come by properly is yours to use as you wish,\nbut there are certainly exceptions.  If you write a paper which includes\nsufficiently detailed information on how to build a nuclear weapon, it is\nclassified.  As I understand the law, nuclear weapons design is\n_automatically_ classified even if you do the work yourself.  I believe you\nare then not allowed to read your own paper.\n\nA less serious example: if you tell drivers about a speed trap they are\nabout to run into, you can be fined, even though you might argue that you\nbroke no law when you discovered the location of the policeman.  The charge\nis interfering with a police officer, which is quite similar what you would\nbe doing by reverse engineering the Clipper chip.\n\nDon't tell me that you think this violates the Constitution -- find some\ncourt cases which have struck down such laws.  Many people would not be\ncomforted by the fact that the government violated their rights when it\nimprisoned them.
I'm definitely going to write my Congressman, and nobody's ever\ngoing to make me respect a law that violates my freedom of speech, and\nif the feds try to enforce this law on me, I will protect my freedoms, with\nforce if it ever comes to that. (Hopefully, it won't)\n\nDoug Holland\n\n--

Here is a revised version of my summary which corrects some errors\nand provides some additional information and explanation.\n\n\n                     THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY\n\n                               Dorothy Denning\n\n                           Revised, April 21, 1993\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nOn April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bring\ntogether the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program\nto provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of\nlaw enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption\nchip called the "Clipper Chip" together with a split-key approach to\nescrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from\nboth are needed to reconstruct a key.\n\n\nCHIP CONTENTS\n\nThe Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block\nencryption algorithm called "Skipjack."  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys\n(compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling\n(compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of\noperation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic\nCodebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.\n\nEach chip includes the following components:\n\n   the Skipjack encryption algorithm\n   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips\n   N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)\n   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip\n\nThe chips are programmed by Mykotronx, Inc., which calls them the\n"MYK-78."  The silicon is supplied by VLSI Technology Inc.  They are\nimplemented in 1 micron technology and will initially sell for about\n$30 each in quantities of 10,000 or more.  The price should drop as the\ntechnology is shrunk to .8 micron.\n\n\nENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP\n\nTo see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T\ntelephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and\nwe both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure\nconversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K\nwith the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place\nwithout the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can\nbe used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.\n\nOnce the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to\nencrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The\ntelephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two\nvalues:\n\n   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and \n   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field , \n\nwhich are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement\nfield thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U\nconcatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family\nkey F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after\nan authorized wiretap has been installed.\n\nThe ciphertext E[M; K] is decrypted by the receiver's device using the\nsession key:\n\n   D[E[M; K]; K] = M .\n\n\nCHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW\n\nAll Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (Secure Compartmented\nInformation Facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains\na laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips\nare programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at\nMykotronx.\n\nAt the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key\nescrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters a secret, random\n80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters a secret, random\n80-bit value S2. These random values serve as seeds to generate unit\nkeys for a sequence of serial numbers.  Thus, the unit keys are a\nfunction of 160 secret, random bits, where each agent knows only 80.\n  \nTo generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is\nfirst padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.\nS1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a\n64-bit block R1:\n\n        R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .\n\nSimilarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and\nN3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:  \n\n        R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] \n        R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .\n\nR1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The\nfirst 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The\nrest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2\nare the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow\nagencies.\n\nAs a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are\nwritten onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a\nfile for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part\nU1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third\ndisk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent\n2 takes the second disk.  Thus each agent walks away knowing\nan 80-bit seed and the 80-bit key parts.  However, the agent does not\nknow the other 80 bits used to generate the keys or the other 80-bit\nkey parts.  \n\nThe third disk is used to program the chips.  After the chips are\nprogrammed, all information is discarded from the vault and the agents\nleave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no\ninformation is left behind.\n \nThe protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the\nroom instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,\nand the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to\nthe escrow agencies. \n\nThe escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not\nbe the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or\nboth may be independent from the government.\n\n\nLAW ENFORCEMENT USE\n\nWhen law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they\nwill first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get\naccess to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in\nplace and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with the\nClipper Chip.  The law enforcement field is first decrypted with the\nfamily key F, giving E[K; U] + N.  Documentation certifying that a tap\nhas been authorized for the party associated with serial number N is\nthen sent (e.g., via secure FAX) to each of the key escrow agents, who\nreturn (e.g., also via secure FAX) U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed\ntogether to produce the unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the\nsession key K.  Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will\nbe accomplished through a special black box decoder.\n\n\nCAPSTONE: THE NEXT GENERATION\n\nA successor to the Clipper Chip, called "Capstone" by the government\nand "MYK-80" by Mykotronx, has already been developed.  It will include\nthe Skipjack algorithm, the Digital Signature Standard (DSS), the\nSecure Hash Algorithm (SHA), a method of key exchange, a fast\nexponentiator, and a randomizer.  A prototoype will be available for\ntesting on April 22, and the chips are expected to be ready for\ndelivery in June or July.
And the initiative for actual implementation.  Clinton is not just an\ninnocent bystander here - They didn't just slap his name on it without\nconsulting him.  What exactly is his extensive history of individual\nrights advocacy that people are assuming he really has nothing to do\nwith this?  He just went back on his pledge to cut the espionage\nbudget, and is now asking for more money than even Bush wanted.
Really? Why are so you worried about high school kids "getting their kicks"\nwith scanners, as compared to what the feds can do, and have done, to their\ntargets?\n\n"Better than the status quo" isn't good enough, I'd say. The same \ntechnology could be implemented WITHOUT a back door open to the state.\n\nWe all know about power and corruption. But we all know that abuse is\nsomething that only happens to the other guy.\n\n\n\n-- \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJohn Hesse           |          A man,     \njhesse@netcom.com    |                 a plan, \nMoss Beach, Calif    |                         a canal, Bob.
The key question is whether non-Clipper encryption will be made illegal.\n\n\nThe clear middle ground implied by these statements is to say that Americans\nhave the right to Clipper encryption, but not to unbreakable encryption.\nThis implies that, ultimately, non-Clipper strong encryption must become\nillegal.\n\n(As an aside, isn't the language here jarring?  All this talk about\n"harmonious balance" when they're talking about taking away people's\nright to communications privacy?)\n\nAlthough the article emphasizes voice communication, data and mail encryption\nis mentioned as well:\n\n\n\nIt looks like the worst nightmares raised by Dorothy Denning's proposals\nare coming true.  If the government continues on this course, I imagine\nthat we will see strong cryptography made illegal.  Encryption programs\nfor disk files and email, as well as software to allow for encrypted\nvoice communications, will be distributed only through the\n"underground".  People will have to learn how to hide the fact that\nthey are protecting their privacy.\n\nIt's shocking and frightening to see that this is actually happening here.
I think your experiences under the Bulgarian regime are highly relevant.\nWe have too many people with their heads in the sand saying it cannot\nhappen here, as our Constitutional Rights are being trashed every day\nbecause the government justifies doing some end-run around the protections\nby a 'crisis' requiring 'drastic action'.   It is most likely that in the\nfuture possession of secure encryption tools will be regarded as possession\nof 'terrorist and drug dealers tools', and be some serious Fedaral Felony.\nJust like common tools are 'burgular tools' if the police say so, common\ncomputer programs (even computers themselves) are now 'hackers tools',\nand will become 'terrorist tools'.  BET ON IT.\n\nThe insights of someone who has lived throught this are very important.\nIf the US goes the way of the old Soviet Union and its client states\nas far as individual rights, privacy and overall freedom are concerned,\nthe rest of the world (remember 'New World Order'?) will not be far\nbehind - only a few years.\n\nPlease keep posting anything you find that is deficient or that threatens\nones rights in this thing.\n\nFor example, a conversation between a suspect and a lawyer will no longer\nbe private from Big Brother eavesdropping.  Political dissent allready\nis very dangerous in this country, all it takes is the government to\ndecide that enough people will take one seriously, then one becomes\nguilty of 'plotting to overthrow the government by illegal means'.  The\nphrase 'illegal means' is defined as whatever the government wants it\nto be defined as.\n\nCouple this with Clinton's pressing for a 'smart' National ID card (an\n'Internal passport'?), with the added wrinkle that anything about you and\nyour past can be put on it, and you can only take the government's\nword as to what is really on it (since they will be the only ones\nwith the means to completely read and reprogram the thing).  Isn't\nthat nice?\n\nWhile the Feds can bust into one's safe without the keys, the owner\nknows his safe has been broken into.  When they break into your 'secure'\nphone conversations (or other stored/transmitted data in the near future)\nyou have no way of knowing, so accountability as to the legalities has\ngone out the window.  Just like a safe, if they have a legal cause, they\ncan get the keys from the suspect, just like they can get the keys to\na safe or the combination from the suspect.  Same with encryption:\nRecord everything, get the warrants, THEN decode it with the keys\nobtained from the suspect.\n\nThis Clinton Cripple, along with its natural extensions, will make any\npriviliged communications between client and lawyer, and any meaningful\npolitical dissent virtually impossible.  Which is the general idea.\nAny propeganda about its being secure, and the safeguards, and all\nof that are just that - propeganda to reassure people so they will\nby into this monstrosity.  DON'T BE SUCKERED.\n\nBIG BROTHER IS LISTENING!!!
This document is in the anonymous ftp directory at NIST.  Looks to me\nlike the other shoe has dropped.\n\n	Jim Gillogly\n	Trewesday, 25 Astron S.R. 1993, 17:00\n\n-------------------\n\nNote:  This file will also be available via anonymous file\ntransfer from csrc.ncsl.nist.gov in directory /pub/nistnews and\nvia the NIST Computer Security BBS at 301-948-5717.\n     ---------------------------------------------------\n\n                         THE WHITE HOUSE\n\n                  Office of the Press Secretary\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nFor Immediate Release                           April 16, 1993\n\n\n                STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY\n\n\nThe President today announced a new initiative that will bring\nthe Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary\nprogram to improve the security and privacy of telephone\ncommunications while meeting the legitimate needs of law\nenforcement.\n\nThe initiative will involve the creation of new products to\naccelerate the development and use of advanced and secure\ntelecommunications networks and wireless communications links.\n\nFor too long there has been little or no dialogue between our\nprivate sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the\ntension between economic vitality and the real challenges of\nprotecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate\nthe sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\nlaw enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\nindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\n\nSophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\nprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\nprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\ntechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\nunauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\nby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\n\nA state-of-the-art microcircuit called the "Clipper Chip" has\nbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\nnew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\nrelatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\nan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\nusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\ncommercial use today.\n\nThis new technology will help companies protect proprietary\ninformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\nand prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\nelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\nability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\nintercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \n\nA "key-escrow" system will be established to ensure that the\n"Clipper Chip" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\nAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique\n\n\n                                2\n\n\n"keys," numbers that will be needed by authorized government\nagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\ndevice is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\nin two "key-escrow" data bases that will be established by the\nAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\ngovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct a\nwiretap.\n\nThe "Clipper Chip" technology provides law enforcement with no\nnew authorities to access the content of the private\nconversations of Americans.\n\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\nAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\ndevices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\ngovernment will be offered access to the confidential details of\nthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\ntheir findings.\n\nThe chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\nencryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\nprivacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\ncriminals and terrorists.  We need the "Clipper Chip" and other\napproaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\nto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\nto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\ntrends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\nthe President has directed government agencies to develop a\ncomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\n\n     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\n          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\n\n     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\n          calls and data, under proper court or other legal\n          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\n\n     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern\n          technology to build the National Information\n          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\n          the competitiveness of American industry in the global\n          marketplace; and \n\n     --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\n          high technology products.\n\nThe President has directed early and frequent consultations with\naffected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\nprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\n\n\n\n                                3\n\nThe Administration is committed to working with the private\nsector to spur the development of a National Information\nInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\ntechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\ninformation.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\n("information superhighways") will transmit video, images, HDTV\nprogramming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone\nsystem transmits voice.\n\nSince encryption technology will play an increasingly important\nrole in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\nquickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\nits use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\nprotect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting\nthem from those who break the law.\n\nFurther information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \nThe provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new\nencryption technology are also available.  \n\nFor additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\nStandards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\n\n---------------------------------\n\n\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S\nTELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\n\n\n\n\nQ:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\n     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?\n\nA:   No.  "Clipper Chip" technology provides law enforcement with\n     no new authorities to access the content of the private\n     conversations of Americans.\n\nQ:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\n     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\n     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\n     decipher the message?\n\nA:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\n     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\n     would then present documentation of this authorization to\n     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\n     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\n     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\n     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\n     escrow system.\n\nQ:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\n\nA:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\n     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\n     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will\n     oversee the key-escrow data banks.\n\nQ:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\n     how strong the security is?  \n\nA:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\n     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\n     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\n     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of\n     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\n     potential users that there are no unrecognized\n     vulnerabilities.\n\nQ:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\n\nA:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\n     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\n     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\n     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\n     officials.\n\nQ:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\n\nA:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\n     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\n     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\n     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\n     decisions related to this initiative.\n\nQ:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\n\nA:   The government designed and developed the key access\n     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\n     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\n     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\n     manufacturer that produces them.\n\nQ:   Who provides the "Clipper Chip"?\n\nA:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\n     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device\n     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\n     to other vendors in the future.\n\nQ:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \n\nA:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\n     the "Clipper Chip" into their devices.\n     \nQ:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\n     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\n     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\n     powerful encryption devices?\n\nA:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\n     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\n     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\n     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\n     than others readily available today, but it is just one\n     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\n     encryption technology, which the Administration is\n     developing.\n\n     The Administration is not saying, "since encryption\n     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\n     we will prohibit it outright" (as some countries have\n     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that "every\n     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\n     unbreakable commercial encryption product."  There is a\n     false "tension" created in the assessment that this issue is\n     an "either-or" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\n     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\n     balanced approach such as is proposed with the "Clipper\n     Chip" and similar encryption techniques.\n\nQ:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\n     Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from\n     that of the Bush Administration?  \n\nA:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\n     technology in telecommunications and computing and are\n     committed to working with industry and public-interest\n     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'\n     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\n     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\n     and terrorism.\n\nQ:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\n     the government hardware?\n\nA:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control\n     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is\n     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The\n     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the\n     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give\n     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this\n     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a\n     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these\n     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan\n     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability\n     of these products.

Not enough magtape.\n\nSeriously, do you have any idea how much traffic flows through the US phone \nsystem in a single day?
From: Marc VanHeyningen <mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu>\n\n	The majority of the discussion involving this "Clipper Chip" seems to\n	pertain to the encryption of telephone conversations.  Does anyone\n	know if that means this chip is designed to work primarily with analog\n	signals?  The language sort of suggests this, but it's hard to say.\n\nI'd lay a few bucks that its just data-in-data-out in parallel.  I suspect\nto make it a phone you'd need a codec and speech compression.  There would\nbe a loss of bandwidth on the speech signal, which I suspect would scupper\nany of the suggestions I've seen here about putting a different encryption\nfront end on it.\n\nThere's no hint of any modulation scheme in the docs.  I'm sure it's purely\na digital chip.  The back end will come later, but I'm *positive* it won't\nbe left to the manufacturers - they all have to be the same modulation\nscheme to make it easy for the NSA to tap them.\n\nThe only other possibility is that this is intended only for ISDN phones.\n(Puts a whole new spin on EFFs obsession about ISDN if true, bwahahaha! ;-) )

The following document summarizes the Clipper Chip, how it is used,\nhow programming of the chip is coupled to key generation and the\nescrow process, and how law enforcement decrypts communications.\nSince there has been some speculation on this news group about my\nown involvement in this project, I'd like to add that I was not in\nany way involved.  I found out about it when the FBI briefed me on\nThursday evening, April 15.  Since then I have spent considerable\ntime talking with the NSA and FBI to learn more about this, and I\nattended the NIST briefing at the Department of Commerce on April 16.  \nThe document below is the result of that effort. \n\nDorothy Denning\n---------------\n\n                     THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY\n\n                               Dorothy Denning\n\n                                April 19, 1993\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nOn April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bring\ntogether the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program\nto provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of\nlaw enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption\nchip called the "Clipper Chip" together with a split-key approach to\nescrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from\nboth are needed to reconstruct a key.\n\n\nCHIP STRUCTURE\n\nThe Clipper Chip contains a classified 64-bit block encryption\nalgorithm called "Skipjack."  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared\nwith 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16\nfor the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  Throughput is\n16 Mbits a second.\n\nEach chip includes the following components:\n\n   the Skipjack encryption algorithm\n   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips\n   N, a 30-bit serial number\n   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip\n\n\nENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP\n\nTo see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T\ntelephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and\nwe both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure\nconversation, my security device will negotiate a session key K with\nthe device at the other end (in general, any method of key exchange can\nbe used).  The key K and message stream M (i.e., digitized voice) are then\nfed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values:\n\n   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and \n   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.  \n\nThe law enforcement block thus contains the session key K encrypted\nunder the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N, all\nencrypted under the family key F.\n\n\nCHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW\n\nAll Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (secure computer\ninformation facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains\na laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips\nare programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at\nMikotronx.\n\nAt the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key\nescrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters an 80-bit value S1\ninto the laptop and agent 2 enters an 80-bit value S2. These values\nserve as seeds to generate keys for a sequence of serial numbers.\n\nTo generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is\nfirst padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.\nS1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a\n64-bit block R1:\n\n        R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .\n\nSimilarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and\nN3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:  \n\n        R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] \n        R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .\n\nR1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The\nfirst 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The\nrest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2\nare the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow\nagencies.\n\nAs a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are\nwritten onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a\nfile for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part\nU1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third\ndisk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent\n2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips.\nAfter the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the\nvault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional\nassurance that no information is left behind.\n \nThe protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the\nroom instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,\nand the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to\nthe escrow agencies.\n\nThe escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not\nbe the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or\nboth may be independent from the government.\n\n\nLAW ENFORCEMENT USE\n\nWhen law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they\nwill first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get\naccess to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in\nplace and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with\nClipper.  They will first decrypt the law enforcement block with the\nfamily key F.  This gives them E[K; U] + N.  They will then take a\nwarrant identifying the chip serial number N to each of the key escrow\nagents and get back U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed together to produce\nthe unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the session key K.\nFinally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will be accomplished\nthrough a special black box decoder operated by the FBI.
While I think it is unrealistic to suppose that the federal\nagencies will fail to promptly comply with a court order, there is \nstill a good point here.  Local law enforcement will be unable to perform\na wiretap without bringing in federal agencies.   Based on the (possibly\nincomplete) understanding of the system quoted from D. Denning, only the\nFBI will be able to decrypt the system key encryption layer, which seems\nto be needed even to identify what escrowed keys to request.  This moves\na great deal of law enforcement power to the federal level.\n	The reason I like this point is that it may sway or even persuade\npeople who don't generally line up with the civil liberties crowd.  A\nnational police force is opposed by people from a broad range of political \nviewpoints.
I've got no doubts that this would probably have gone ahead if Bush\nwas still president.  What's puzzling to me are the people who are\napparently amazed that Clinton is going along with it.
She hasn't.  Dorothy Denning has spent many years earning the\nprofessional respect of her colleagues, and something won in this\nmanner is not easily lost.  Her support of the clipper -- no matter\nhow unpopular that position may be -- serves far more to enhance the\nclipper's respectability than to diminish her own.\n\n                           :: Jeff Makey

Thanks.  I've ftp'ed the FAQ file and it is just what I was looking for.
Once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access.  The\n   telco isn't supposed to give that without a warrant.  That's the rule today.\n\n   But even so, the evidence would not be admissible, I think, unless the\n   judge so ordered.  I think that even interception of the crypttext\n   without a warrant would be illegal.   Cops can't record today's plain\n   cellular calls and then ask a judge, "Hey, can we have permission to\n   listen to those tapes?" can they?\n\nHow long do you think it will be before it becomes legal for the\npolice to record encrypted conversations "It's not violating your\nprivacy because we can't read the encryption without a warrant", with the usual\ngood-faith exception if they accidentally record a non-encrypted conversation.\n\nBesides, it's covered by the Drug Exception to the Fourth Amendment...
Good question. I also wanted to find out and I did a while ago.\n\nIn our former communist times such activity (i.e. sending crypto emails)\nwould be prevented sooner ot later, law or no law. But now there is no law \nagainst it. So we are free to use it. We now have an EC conformant law for \nprotection and registration of personal files.

People have been encrypting notes in their notebooks for hundreds of years\n-- maybe over a thousand.  It's a long tradition dating at least back to\nthe alchemists.\n\nI know of nothing bad happening to them.  I would assume that nothing bad\nwould happen to you, given this long history establishing encryption as\nthe property of individuals, to do with as they please.
Hey, it's better than the status quo.\n\nI am far less worried about "the feds" tapping my phone than high school \nscanner surfers who get their kicks out of eavesdropping on cellular and \ncordless phone calls.\n\nIt would be stupid to rely on even a "Clipperized" channel for truly \nsensitive material, but it *does* seem to finally offer a reasonable way to \nguard against casual eavesdropping.  For example, even with my strong "right \nto bear arms" view of the private right to possess and use strong \ncryptosystems, the system as described provides enough security that I would \nactually buy a cordless phone, and would be much less wary of using cellular \nphones, walkie-talkies, and so on.  As long as it's only used for mass-market \nvoice scrambling, I actually don't see a problem with it.\n\nIf you want more security than it offers, use something different.  Use PKCS \nfor electronic mail, CELP over DES or triple DES with Diffie-Hellman key \nexchange for your voice traffic, or whatever.\n\nAnd yes, I'd rather just see all crypto restrictions lifted, but this is at \nleast an incrememental improvement for certain applications...
: From: shirriff@sprite.berkeley.edu (Ken Shirriff)\n: Message-ID: <1r24us$oeh@agate.berkeley.edu>\n: It seems likely to me that that a large subset of encrypted communications\n: would be archived to tape so they could be read if sometime in the future\n: probable cause arises and a warrant is obtained.\n\nI think it is unlikely that data like this could be used in court.\nCurrently LEAs can install wiretaps on large numbers of phones, record\ncalls without listening to them, and then post-facto obtain warrants\nand listen to calls after probable cause is established.  But this\nstrategy wouldn't get the stuff admitted in court.  (At least, not\nin the near term.)\n\nIn other words, near as I can tell, the thing that makes such evidence\ninadmissable is the interception without a warrant, not the attempt to\ninterpret what was intercepted without a warrant.  I'd be surprised\nthat archiving data without consent would be interpreted as anything\nbut analogous to a wiretap by the courts.\n\nNote that that doesn't mean I think it won't be done if technically\nfeasible.  Just as I'm sure many wiretaps are done now without\nwarrants, just to fish for avenues to investigate.  So in the future,\nstart surveilance, start archiving data, trump up some probable cause,\ndecrypt post-facto after the warrant is in hand, and the investigation\ngets a boost from data that, sadly, won't ever be presented to a jury.\n\nWhile I'm posting...  for an interesting cautionary tale projecting this\narchiving scenario to extremes, read "Lacey and his Friends", a\ncollection of sf stories by David Drake.  The US starts down the\nslippery slope by archiving *everyghing*.  But don't worry folks, it's\nstored in a secure repository where nobody but LEAs with warrants can\nget to it.  And by the way, we'll be installing cameras on all major\nstreets.  Hey, this is nothing new, we already have cameras in banks and\nteller machines, don't we?\n\nAnd then we'll pass laws requiring cameras covering *all* public\nplaces.  Then in some private places.  Then we'll make it a crime ever\nto be out of range of a camera, except in legally licensed privacy\ncubicles.  Only alone.  And with a thorough body search before and\nafter.  But, see, there's still a right to privacy.  We haven't\ncurtailed any rights, not really.  And just think how much easier it'd\nbe to solve crimes in such a situation: just obtain a warrant, put on a\nVR helmet and take a walk down memory lane.\n\nAnd hey, nobody'll be tracking *you* or *me*, no need to be self-conscious.\n\nAfter all, if you're not doing anything illegal...\n\nFunny, though.  While speeding and the radar detector industry became\npretty much a thing of the past, somehow all this didn't elminate all\ncrime in the story.  And somehow, politicians got exemptions on grounds\nof national security, and rich corporations got exemptions for their\nexecs on grounds of industrial espionage and the preservation of\ncompetition.  And not everybody was exactly happy with the system.  \nI can't imagine why.

Each chip includes the following components:\n\n      the Skipjack encryption algorithm\n      F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips\n      N, a 30-bit serial number\n      U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip\n\nHmmm. A thirty bit serial number. And, we are told, the unit key U is\nderived deterministically from this serial number. That means that\nthere are only one billion possible unit keys.\n\n   To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is\n   first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.\n   S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a\n   64-bit block R1:\n\n	   R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .\n\n   Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and\n   N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:  \n\n	   R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] \n	   R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .\n\n   R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The\n   first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The\n   rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2\n   are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow\n   agencies.\n\nHmmm. We must assume that generating the unit key U from the serial\nnumber N rather than generating it from a randomly selected U1 and U2\nis an intentional way of assuring a "fail safe" for the government --\nU is completedly determined given S1, S2 and N. If S1 and S2 do not\nchange they constitute effective "master keys" (along with F), the\ntheft of which (or the possession of which by various authorities)\ncompletely obviates the security of the system. However, more\ninterestingly, we know, for a fact that if S1 and S2 are fixed no\nmatter what the keyspace for U is no more than 2^30. Why not pick U1\nand U2 at random? Why this interesting restriction of they key space\nif it NOT to provide an additional back door?\n\nI find it disturbing that at the very best my security is dependant on\napproximately 30 bytes worth of information that could be written on\nthe back of a napkin.\n\nEven if S1 and S2 change periodically, the rationale behind this\nrestriction in the size of the keyspace seems strange if one is\nassuming that the goal is security -- and makes perfect sense if the\ngoal is an illusion of security.\n\nIf S1 and S2 do not change, even if they remain secret I wonder if\nthey can somehow be back-derived given enough unit key/serial number\npairs. We are assured that this cannot happen -- but no one\nunderstands how Skipjack works outside of government officials and,\nsoon, foreign intelligence services that gain the information via\nespionage. Presumably we will eventually have the information as well\n-- reverse engineering gets more and more advanced every year -- but\nby the time we know it may be too late.\n\n   As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are\n   written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a\n   file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part\n   U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third\n   disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent\n   2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips.\n   After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the\n   vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional\n   assurance that no information is left behind.\n\nNone of this makes me feel the least bit secure. The silly notion of\n"destroying the laptop" appears to be yet another bizarre distraction.\nWe all know that you can't read data from DRAM that has been turned\noff for more than a few moments. On the other hand, what we don't know\nis why there is a need to generate the unit keys from S1 and S2 in the\nfirst place other than to weaken the system. We don't know if the\nagents in question would resist a million in cash a piece for their\ninformation -- its probably worth hundreds of million, so you can make\nthe bribe arbitrarily hard to resist. And to tell you the truth, doing\nthis in a "vault" rather than in Joe Random Tempest-shielded Room\nwith a laptop computer seems like melodrama designed to make\nhigh-school dropouts from Peoria impressed -- but it does very little\nfor most of the rest of us.\n\n   The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the\n   room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,\n   and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to\n   the escrow agencies.\n\nWhat would this provide? Lets say the escrow agencies are the ACLU and\nthe NRA and their agents personally take back the disks and are always\nhonest. Who cares? The NSA must be laughing out loud, because they\nhave the algorithm to regenerate U given N and likely don't need to\nsteal they keys as they effectively already have them.\n\n--\nPerry Metzger		pmetzger@shearson.com

MITRE paranoia?\n\nI could cite probably a hundred more facts which all support, as\nbest hypothesis, the notion that the NSA is grabbing as much as\nit can, as fast as it can.  One would be a fool to ignore the\npattern of facts and conclude that they were random...\n\nAnd we know the government is violent -- even against children as\nrecent events prove.  Judge William Sessions is a disgrace\nbut a solemn warning to those who ignore the web of evidence\nthat our government institutions have in their contempt for our\ncivil rights.\n\nAnd of course we have to err somewhat on the excessive side of\ncaution because that does much less harm than erring on the\nreckless side. As member of the crew of the USS Liberty might aver.\n\nI might suggest, Andrew, that you read Kahn's Codebreakers and\nBamford's Puzzle Palace and come back with some more facts to\nsupport your sheepish acquiescence to authority.

While encryption\ntechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\nunauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\nby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\n\nA state-of-the-art microcircuit called the "Clipper Chip" has\nbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\nnew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\nrelatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\nan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\nusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\ncommercial use today.\n\nThis new technology will help companies protect proprietary\ninformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\nand prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\nelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\nability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\nintercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \n\nA "key-escrow" system will be established to ensure that the\n"Clipper Chip" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\nAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique\n\n\n                                2\n\n\n"keys," numbers that will be needed by authorized government\nagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\ndevice is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\nin two "key-escrow" data bases that will be established by the\nAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\ngovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct a\nwiretap.\n\nThe "Clipper Chip" technology provides law enforcement with no\nnew authorities to access the content of the private\nconversations of Americans.\n\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\nAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\ndevices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\ngovernment will be offered access to the confidential details of\nthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\ntheir findings.\n\nThe chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\nencryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\nprivacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\ncriminals and terrorists.  We need the "Clipper Chip" and other\napproaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\nto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\nto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\ntrends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\nthe President has directed government agencies to develop a\ncomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\n\n     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\n          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\n\n     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\n          calls and data, under proper court or other legal\n          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\n\n     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern\n          technology to build the National Information\n          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\n          the competitiveness of American industry in the global\n          marketplace; and \n\n     --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\n          high technology products.\n\nThe President has directed early and frequent consultations with\naffected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\nprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\n\n\n\n                                3\n\nThe Administration is committed to working with the private\nsector to spur the development of a National Information\nInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\ntechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\ninformation.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\n("information superhighways") will transmit video, images, HDTV\nprogramming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone\nsystem transmits voice.\n\nSince encryption technology will play an increasingly important\nrole in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\nquickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\nits use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\nprotect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting\nthem from those who break the law.\n\nFurther information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \nThe provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new\nencryption technology are also available.  \n\nFor additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\nStandards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\n\n---------------------------------\n\n\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S\nTELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\n\n\n\n\nQ:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\n     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?\n\nA:   No.  "Clipper Chip" technology provides law enforcement with\n     no new authorities to access the content of the private\n     conversations of Americans.\n\nQ:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\n     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\n     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\n     decipher the message?\n\nA:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\n     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\n     would then present documentation of this authorization to\n     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\n     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\n     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\n     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\n     escrow system.\n\nQ:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\n\nA:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\n     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\n     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will\n     oversee the key-escrow data banks.\n\nQ:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\n     how strong the security is?  \n\nA:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\n     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\n     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\n     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of\n     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\n     potential users that there are no unrecognized\n     vulnerabilities.\n\nQ:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\n\nA:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\n     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\n     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\n     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\n     officials.\n\nQ:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\n\nA:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\n     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\n     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\n     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\n     decisions related to this initiative.\n\nQ:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\n\nA:   The government designed and developed the key access\n     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\n     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\n     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\n     manufacturer that produces them.\n\nQ:   Who provides the "Clipper Chip"?\n\nA:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\n     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device\n     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\n     to other vendors in the future.\n\nQ:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \n\nA:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\n     the "Clipper Chip" into their devices.\n     \nQ:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\n     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\n     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\n     powerful encryption devices?\n\nA:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\n     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\n     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\n     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\n     than others readily available today, but it is just one\n     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\n     encryption technology, which the Administration is\n     developing.\n\n     The Administration is not saying, "since encryption\n     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\n     we will prohibit it outright" (as some countries have\n     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that "every\n     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\n     unbreakable commercial encryption product."  There is a\n     false "tension" created in the assessment that this issue is\n     an "either-or" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\n     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\n     balanced approach such as is proposed with the "Clipper\n     Chip" and similar encryption techniques.\n\nQ:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\n     Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from\n     that of the Bush Administration?  \n\nA:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\n     technology in telecommunications and computing and are\n     committed to working with industry and public-interest\n     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'\n     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\n     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\n     and terrorism.\n\nQ:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\n     the government hardware?\n\nA:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control\n     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is\n     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The\n     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the\n     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give\n     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this\n     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a\n     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these\n     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan\n     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability\n     of these products.\n\n----------- End included article -----------

I wholeheartedly agree.  Knowing that WE have let our law enforcement agencies\nseize our property against the Fifth Amendment of OUR Constitution tells me that\nwe are absolving ourselves of our responsibility for SELF-GOVERNANCE.  WE have\nto take our government back from the self-serving politicians who create laws\nand rules only to better their positions within the government.  WE have allowed\nthem to take too much power from the people of this nation.  That situation has\nto be changed.\n\nAllowing the law enforcement agencies to use the seized property to pay-off drug\ninformants who lie and continue to deal in drugs is tantamount to making a pact\nwith the Devil himself.  It's a vicious cycle.  The law enforcement agencies are\nmotivated to seize property to fund their own activities.  And having no easy\nway for the citizen to regain the property intact once taken gives even more\nincentive for the agencies to take property.\n\nIt's also interesting to note that two months ago Rush Limbaugh said that\nClinton would have the "plumbers" out in force shortly.  Clinton and his\nhenchmen firmly believe in strong ubiquitous government control.  Anytime a\nleader believes in that, the leader will use every means possible to retain that\ncontrol and take more.\n\nWE have to take OUR government back.  Otherwise we will end up living in the\nequivalent of a high-tech third world dictatorship.  We have to take\nresponsibility for ourselves, our personal welfare, and our actions.
This appears to be generic calling upon the name of the anti-christ.\nJust for the hell of it, let's destroy this remark. Let us imagine that\nthe executive branch actually could extract keys from the escrow houses\nwithout anyone knowing, or telling. Now what? Dick has 80 bits of data.\nWhat the hell's he gonna do with it?\n\n	1) Trot around to the telco and say 'we'd like an unauthorised\ndecrypting tap'. Uh huh.\n	2) Break in to watergate and install his own tap (so his people still\ndo have to break in, neat, huh?) record some noise, then get the Executive\nBranch Phone Decryption Box (huh? they've got one? Goodness, wait 'til the\nwashington post gets hold of this) and decrypt the noise.\n	3) More likely, stare at the key, and say 'Oh, hell it's not\nworth all this bloody hassle'\n\n	Truth is, even granted *lots* of covert power on the part of\nthe Executive Branch, this system is *more* difficult to tap with than\nPOTS gear. The fact that it is easier to tap than some hypothetical\nsystem neither you nor I am going to place on our phones is neither\nhere nor there.\n\n	The only rational concerns I am seeing raised are:\n\n	a) is the key really just chopped in half, and not some XOR\narrangement? That is, has some egregious technical error been built\nin to the plan?\n	b) is this is the first step toward strict regulation of strong\nencryption?\n\n\n\n	This is b), of course. I suspect not. If the government actually\nwanted to make such regs, they'd just do it. A few hundred people on Usenet\nyelling about it wouldn't even slow the machine down.\n\n	Besides, who is this mysterious 'they' who's going to take away\nall our rights the instant we let our guard down? Congress? That gang\nof buffoons can't even balance their checkbooks. The FBI? But.. they\ndon't make the laws. The NSA? Ditto. The white house? Bill Clinton\nis probably still looking for the bathroom. It's a big place, after all.\n\n	Andrew
If this is any surprise to you, *I'm* shocked.
: The message from the NIST about the clipper chip comes from the\n: following address:\n: \n: 	clipper@csrc.ncsl.nist.gov (Clipper Chip Announcement)\n: \n: Just who is that, I asked myself, or rather, I asked the computer.\n: \n:     % telnet csrc.ncsl.nist.gov 25\n...list of name elided for brevity......\n: \n: Well, isn't that interesting.  Dorothy Denning, Mitch Kapor, Marc\n: Rotenberg, Ron Rivest, Jim Bidzos, and others.  The Government, RSA,\n: TIS, CPSR, and the EFF are all represented.  I don't suppose anybody\n: within any of these organizations would care to comment?  Or is this\n: just the White House's idea of a cruel joke on these peoples' inboxes?\n\nI know that at least one person on that list says the first he heard\nof Clipper was in the Friday morning newspaper! And another has\nalready fired off a letter of protest to NIST.\n\nMy point? I suspect this list, interesting as it is for various\nreasons, does not represent the cabal that put this proposal together.\nSome of them, yes. Others, no. \n\nThis may be nothing more than a mailing list of people who get\ncrypto-related announcements from NSA, er, I mean "NIST."\n\n-Tim May
Umm...  I beg to differ with the phrase ``only conceivable meaning''.\nThe SDNS protocols, for example, make explicit provision for multiple\nencryption systems, as does PEM.  (And I'd love to see how they'd\nmandate this new system for PEM without disclosing it....)
This is pernicious nonsense!\n\nDavid
as someone who just lived through a switch from SunOS4.x.x. to\nSolaris, i'll heartily agree with this. \n\nObCrypt: one of my main gripes with Solaris is its braindead mailx,\nwhich is -almost- enough like mail to get you hoping, but crashes\nhorribly when you try to do anything useful with it. (like use pgp-\ncapable sendmail replacements.)\n\njason
: From: brad@optilink.COM (Brad Yearwood)\n\n: Assume in this case the usual canard-adversary of narcotraficantes.  They\n: probably have more cash than the KGB did, and they're probably more generous\n: at handing it out.  It will be easier than ever to find or cultivate Walkers\n: and Pollards for the keys, and it will be easy enough to find someone to\n: reverse-engineer the chip (unless the tamper proofing is damned clever and\n: effective).\n\nIf the administration *really* believes big-time drug dealers are the threat\n(personally I thought it was the CIA and the air force that did all the real\ndrug shipping :-) ) then they *ought* to take this seriously: unlike the\nKGB, drug dealers can make a most convincing argument for cooperation: "help\nus and we'll be nice and give you some money, don't help us and we'll start\ncutting off your favourite body parts"\n\nAfter all, it was probably an argument like that that persuaded Jack Ruby to\nshoot Oswald in full view of the police.  Life in jail probably seems much\nmore preferable to most people than several weeks of something nasty\nfollowed by no life at all...
Then they'll probably also want to start tracking the customer\nlists of people purchasing SoundBlaster and similar boards, which can\nbe configured with the use of some code and a modem, to act as a pretty\ndecent digital-encrypting telephone. It's expensive, though, and kind\nof awkward. I don't know any drug lords, but I'm sure they'd favor\nsomething tappable over something secure as long as the user interface\nis nice.\n\n	When you've got HRH Prince of Wales saying stupid things over\ncordless phones, it's not hard to imagine that drug dealers, child\npornographers, commies, LISP programmers, and other threats to the\ncivilized world might transact incriminating business over "encrypting"\ncellular phones.
And anybody who can get the keys from the escrow company.  This is a\ndatabase that's going to take plenty of updating - they think they can\nkeep it secure?  Please...  and that's just primary, not secondary\nsources, such as police using the key under a warrant.  Would anyone\nbe surprised if they just "neglected" to erase the key if it turned\nout they couldn't nail you on anything?
I change login passwords every couple of months.  I sure would suck if I had\nto get a new sparc station everytime I wanted to do this.  It seems that this\nis what they expect you to do if you want to routinely change your password\non your phone.  I'm sure the government contractor doesn't mind, but a system\nwhere you can cheaply change keys (DES) has inherent security advantages, \nregardless of the algorithms involved.
53 seconds to hash 20M of core (I bet I know who the source of your\ninformation is!). No, it's not acceptable if it's part of your login\nprocess. But if you are going to use network traffic as the source of\npseudo-random information, do the right thing and pass it through a\ncryptographic hash function, not a compressor. Aside from the fact\nthat it will run faster, it will give better results (think of a\ncryptographic hash as a function that "distills" randomness).\nSomething along the lines of \n	etherfind -t -x -n  | dd bs=1k count=10 2>/dev/null | md5\nshould do the trick. -t gives you timestamps, and the lack of -u makes\nsure that dd does not get ten lines as opposed to ten K. The above\ntakes a couple of seconds on a lightly-loaded ethernet.
It's all easy with a DSP. The Olivetti Quaderno, for example [*great* 1kg\nsubnotebook/palmtop PC -- sorry for the plug, folks, but Olivetti don't\nseem to be doing a good job marketing it themselves :-)] includes sound\ndigitisation hardware; they provide vocoders for their DSP which produce\nvarous bit-rates. There's one which gives pretty acceptable voice\nquality at 13Kbit/sec, just right for a V.32bis modem.\n\nTheir DSP can play and record at the same time, too -- so you wouldn't\nneed to play "two-way-radio". You can also download code to the DSP\nsubunit, though you'd need a software development kit for the DSP in \nquestion [dunno which it is...] if you wanted to produce your own \nvocoder for, say, V.32 speeds.\n\nPaul

Ed, as usual, makes a very good point.\n\nOne time a friend of mine at Sun sent me an e-mail.  He composed it using the\nSun OpenWindows 3 "mailtool" which handles (non-MIME) "attachments" and the\nlike.\n\nSince I don't use "mailtool", I had to manually save it, cut & paste, and\nthen "uudecode" the actual attachment.  What I got - after a not-inconsiderable\namount of time spent doing this - was an audio file.  The original message\nwas over 32Kb of mail headers and uuencoded data; the resulting audio message\nwas a single sentence that I transcribed as a 135 character message.\n\nIf he had sent me the sentence in plain text, the e-mail would have been\naround 250 bytes, and it would have taken me about 3 seconds to process it at\nmost.  Instead, it was 32k and it took at least a minute.  A complete waste of\n(my) time and bandwidth, as far as I'm concerned.  Sending plain text is still\nthe most efficient method of transmission, given the same transport mechanism.\nI shudder to think what would happen if everyone started posting their Usenet\narticles as audio files instead of plain text!

Hell, just set up a spark jammer, or some other _very_ electrically-noisy\ndevice. Or build an active Farrady cage around the room, with a "noise"\nsignal piped into it. While these measures will not totally mask the\nemissions of your equipment, they will provide sufficient interference to\nmake remote monitoring a chancy proposition, at best. There is, of course,\nthe consideration that these measures may (and almost cretainly will)\ncause a certain amount of interference in your own systems. It's a matter\nof balancing security versus convenience.\n\nBTW, I'm an ex-Air Force Telecommunications Systems Control Supervisor and\nTelecommunications/Cryptographic Equipment Technician.

I recall seeing a post some time ago saying that if the details of\nan encryption scheme couldn't be revealed, then the encryption\nscheme is worthless.  I believe the statement was in response to\nsomebody saying that they had some new snazzy scheme, but the\nalgorithm was a secret.\n\nDoes this algorithm depend on the fact that the scheme is secret or\nis it for the stated reasons above?
I don't know if this is still true, but at one time Coca-Cola\ntook elaborate measures to keep the formula secret.  For instance,\nseveral plants in different cities each made one of six partial\nconcentrates, which were then shipped back-and forth and remixed\nin a complicated scheme so that no single plant made the whole\nformula.

[ ... ]\n\n\n\nTalk about adding insult to injury ... \n\nI, for one, believe that the use of civil forfeiture should be abolished by\na decent administration, not continued.  Instead, it looks like that\nill-gotten gain will be used to help pay for wiretap equipment.
It might pay to start looking at what this proposal might mean to a\npolice agency.  It just might be a bad idea for them, too.\n\nOK, suppose the NY State Police want to tap a suspect's phone.  They\nneed a warrant, just like the old days.  But unlike the old days, they\nnow need to \n\n   (a) get two federal agencies to give them the two parts of\n       the key.\n\nNow, what happens if there's a tiff between the two escrow houses?\nPosession/release of keys becomes a political bargaining chit.  State\nand lower-level police agencies have to watch the big boys play politics,\nwhile potentially good leads disappear, lives and property are lost,\nstatutes of limitations run out, etc.  Not to mention: a moderately\nclever person who suspects the police are after her/him will be buying\nnew phones faster than tap requests can be processed.  Or using stolen\nones.  [Will the Turing Police come and arrest you for transmitting\nwithout a dialing license?]\n\nThere's also bureacracy and security problems -- within each escrow house, \nhow will requests for key disclosure be authenticated?  Put in enough\nsafeguards of the kind bureaucrats and activists feel comfortable with, and \nit might take a LONG time to get that key.  [Even when a request is approved, \nhow is the key going to be disclosed?  Will it be encrypted by a Clipper-type\nchip for transmission?  In a bureaucracy the size of the Federal\nGovernment, with a databank of the necessary size, and data traffic of\nthe projected volume, there's going to be a lot of weak links.  How many of \nthese kinds of problems will be open for public or "expert" scrutiny?]  \n\nFurthermore, the Feds might be leery of handing completed keys around, \neven to State Police agencies: a trust and security issue.  This would be \nan especially acute issue if some other State's Police had mishandled a \nkey, resulting in lawsuits, financial settlements, and political \nembarassment.  So, the Feds implement it this way:\n \n   (b) some federal agency gets the keys, performs the tap, and\n       turns the results over to the NY State Police.\n\nBut let's say Cuomo's been causing some problems over a Clinton\nAid-To-Urban-Areas proposal.  Or there just happens to be a turf war\ngoing on between the State cops and the Justice department on a case.\nNow, not only do we have the keys as a political chit, we have an\nextra player in the game *and* we have the tap's tapes as another\nbargaining chit.  Again, the State Police lose.\n\nI understand that (legal) wiretaps are quite expensive to maintain. In\nscenario (b), who pays the bill?

It looks like Dorothy Denning's wrong-headed ideas have gotten to the\nAdministration even sooner than we feared. It's time to make sure they\nhear the other side of the story, and hear it loudly!\n\nPhil\n\n\n\n------- Forwarded Message\n\nSubject: text of White House announcement and Q&As on clipper chip encryption\n\nNote:  This file will also be available via anonymous file\ntransfer from csrc.ncsl.nist.gov in directory /pub/nistnews and\nvia the NIST Computer Security BBS at 301-948-5717.\n     ---------------------------------------------------\n\n                         THE WHITE HOUSE\n\n                  Office of the Press Secretary\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nFor Immediate Release                           April 16, 1993\n\n\n                STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY\n\n\nThe President today announced a new initiative that will bring\nthe Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary\nprogram to improve the security and privacy of telephone\ncommunications while meeting the legitimate needs of law\nenforcement.\n\nThe initiative will involve the creation of new products to\naccelerate the development and use of advanced and secure\ntelecommunications networks and wireless communications links.\n\nFor too long there has been little or no dialogue between our\nprivate sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the\ntension between economic vitality and the real challenges of\nprotecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate\nthe sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\nlaw enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\nindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\n\nSophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\nprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\nprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\ntechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\nunauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\nby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\n\nA state-of-the-art microcircuit called the "Clipper Chip" has\nbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\nnew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\nrelatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\nan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\nusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\ncommercial use today.\n\nThis new technology will help companies protect proprietary\ninformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\nand prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\nelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\nability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\nintercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \n\nA "key-escrow" system will be established to ensure that the\n"Clipper Chip" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\nAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique\n\n\n                                2\n\n\n"keys," numbers that will be needed by authorized government\nagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\ndevice is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\nin two "key-escrow" data bases that will be established by the\nAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\ngovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct a\nwiretap.\n\nThe "Clipper Chip" technology provides law enforcement with no\nnew authorities to access the content of the private\nconversations of Americans.\n\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\nAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\ndevices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\ngovernment will be offered access to the confidential details of\nthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\ntheir findings.\n\nThe chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\nencryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\nprivacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\ncriminals and terrorists.  We need the "Clipper Chip" and other\napproaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\nto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\nto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\ntrends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\nthe President has directed government agencies to develop a\ncomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\n\n     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\n          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\n\n     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\n          calls and data, under proper court or other legal\n          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\n\n     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern\n          technology to build the National Information\n          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\n          the competitiveness of American industry in the global\n          marketplace; and \n\n     --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\n          high technology products.\n\nThe President has directed early and frequent consultations with\naffected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\nprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\n\n\n\n                                3\n\nThe Administration is committed to working with the private\nsector to spur the development of a National Information\nInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\ntechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\ninformation.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\n("information superhighways") will transmit video, images, HDTV\nprogramming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone\nsystem transmits voice.\n\nSince encryption technology will play an increasingly important\nrole in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\nquickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\nits use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\nprotect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting\nthem from those who break the law.\n\nFurther information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \nThe provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new\nencryption technology are also available.  \n\nFor additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\nStandards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\n\n- - ---------------------------------\n\n\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S\nTELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\n\n\n\n\nQ:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\n     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?\n\nA:   No.  "Clipper Chip" technology provides law enforcement with\n     no new authorities to access the content of the private\n     conversations of Americans.\n\nQ:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\n     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\n     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\n     decipher the message?\n\nA:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\n     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\n     would then present documentation of this authorization to\n     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\n     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\n     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\n     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\n     escrow system.\n\nQ:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\n\nA:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\n     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\n     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will\n     oversee the key-escrow data banks.\n\nQ:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\n     how strong the security is?  \n\nA:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\n     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\n     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\n     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of\n     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\n     potential users that there are no unrecognized\n     vulnerabilities.\n\nQ:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\n\nA:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\n     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\n     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\n     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\n     officials.\n\nQ:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\n\nA:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\n     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\n     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\n     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\n     decisions related to this initiative.\n\nQ:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\n\nA:   The government designed and developed the key access\n     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\n     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\n     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\n     manufacturer that produces them.\n\nQ:   Who provides the "Clipper Chip"?\n\nA:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\n     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device\n     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\n     to other vendors in the future.\n\nQ:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \n\nA:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\n     the "Clipper Chip" into their devices.\n     \nQ:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\n     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\n     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\n     powerful encryption devices?\n\nA:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\n     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\n     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\n     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\n     than others readily available today, but it is just one\n     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\n     encryption technology, which the Administration is\n     developing.\n\n     The Administration is not saying, "since encryption\n     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\n     we will prohibit it outright" (as some countries have\n     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that "every\n     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\n     unbreakable commercial encryption product."  There is a\n     false "tension" created in the assessment that this issue is\n     an "either-or" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\n     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\n     balanced approach such as is proposed with the "Clipper\n     Chip" and similar encryption techniques.\n\nQ:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\n     Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from\n     that of the Bush Administration?  \n\nA:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\n     technology in telecommunications and computing and are\n     committed to working with industry and public-interest\n     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'\n     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\n     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\n     and terrorism.\n\nQ:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\n     the government hardware?
Let's assume, for the moment, that the system really is secure unless\nyou get both halves of the encryption key from the two independent\nescrow houses.  Let's say you even trust the escrow houses -- one is\nthe ACLU and the other is the EFF.  (And I'm not entirely joking about\nthose two names)\n\nIn that case the Prince of Wales has nothing to worry about on this\nsystem.  Indeed, as pointed out, since the current systems, even the\ncurrent digital systems, are very easy to decode -- right now anybody\nwith an old TV can hear them -- for most people, this will be viewed\nas an "oh goody" step upwards.\n\nAnd look at how tolerant the public is.  They're willing to let the\nneighbours with the radios hear right now.\n\nIt was suggested by one person that a *lot* of non-evidentiary wiretapping\nis going on right now without warrants, because anybody can do it and it's\njust an ECPA violation.  This would stop that.  All tapping would need\na warrant, or a breach of security at the escrow houses.
This is true for the mass market, but not for those who need strong crypto\nand are willing to pay the price. After all, one can buy strong crypto today\nif one is willing to spend enough.\n\nThus the concern is not economic.\n\nThe issue most worth worrying about is that after the system takes hold, the\ngovernment will outlaw other systems, and something voluntary will become\nthe only system available. That is a political, not an economic issue.\n\nAs a separate matter, you may be making an implied advocacy for cheap secure\ncrypto for everyone. It's true that the Clipper chip would probably prevent\nthat except via Clipper, but "cheap, secure crypto for everyone" is a\npolitical discussion, not an economic one, and the whole point of Clipper is \nto resolve that political (policy) tension between securing legitimate\ncommunications and tapping the crooks.
Once the chips are released (in phones, or whatever), they are vulnerable to \nphsyical inspection and observation.  Now, I will grant that there will no \ndoubt be safeguards against "peeling" the chip, but the NSA has no monopoly \non cleverness.  The chip, and the algorithms it uses, will not remain secret \nfor very long.  Any university with a VLSI lab has the required equipment, as \ndoes any offshore semiconductor manufacturer.
Normally I'd be the last to argue with Steve . . . but shouldn't that\nread "3.8 years for *all* solutions".  I mean, if we can imagine the\nmachine that does 1 trial/nanosecond, we can imagine the storage medium\nthat could index and archive it.
This only makes sense if the government prohibits alternative non-escrowed\nencryption schemes. Otherwise, why not just use the front end without\nclipper?\n\nDavid
Just a little nitpicking. Wasn't it the government that required\na standard railway gauge ? Didn't that improve things ?\n\nPlease don't misunderstand. I'm utter suspicious of this Clipper\nchip. Why hold the design TOP SECRET ? Was this a work around the\nlaw that says that any discoveries made by people working for the\ngovernment is public domain. ( e.g. NIH Class Library, etc. )\nDES has its designs published all over the place and it is considered\nfairly strong ( although could be stronger ).
: It occurs to me that if they get a wiretap order on you, and the escrow\n: houses release your code to the cops, your code is now no longer secure.\n: \n: It's in the hands of cops, and while I am sure most of the time they are\n: good, their security will not be as good as the escrow houses.\n: \n: \n: What this effectively means is that if they perform a wiretap on you,\n: at the end of the wiretap, they should be obligated to inform you that\n: a tap was performed, and replace (for free) the clipper chip in your\n: cellular phone so that it is once again a code known only to the\n: escrow houses.\n\nGetting the court order to reveal the key *also* makes decipherable\nall *past* conversations (which may be on tape, or disk, or whatver),\nas I understand the proposal. I could be wrong, but I've seen no\nmention of "session keys" being the escrowed entities.\n\nAs the EFF noted, this raises further issues about the fruits of one\nbust leading to incrimination in other areas.\n\nBut is it any worse than the current unsecure system? It becomes much\nworse, of course, if the government then uses this "Clinton Clipper"\nto argue for restrictions on unapproved encryption. (This is the main\nconcern of most of us, I think. The camel's nose in the tent, etc.)\n\nAnd it may also become much worse if the ostensible security is\nincreased, thus allowing greater access to "central office" records by\nthe government (the conversations being encrypted, who will object to\nletting the government have access to them, perhaps even automatically\narchiving large fractions...). This was one of the main objections to\nthe S.266 proposal, that it would force telecom suppliers to provide\neasy access for the government.\n\nOne the government has had access to months or years of your encrypted\nconversations, now all it takes is one misstep, one violation that\ngets them the paperwork needed to decrypt *all* of them!\n\nDo we want anyone to have this kind of power?\n\n-Tim May, whose sig block may get him busted in the New Regime
Besides being an infringement on our civil liberties (not the subject\nin this post), the name "Clipper Chip" seems very confusable with the\n"Clipper" chip of Intergraph.\n\nOriginally designed by a team at Fairchild Semiconductor, Clipper was\na 32-bit RISC microprocessor. It is still used in some workstations,\nnotably those from Intergraph, the supplier of CAD tools. Intergraph\nacquired the Clipper product line when Fairchild was sold to National\nSemiconductor several years back.\n\nWhen I first saw "Clipper Chip" in the announcement, I immediately\nthought the article was referring to the Clipper chip I know.\n\nThis seems to be grounds for Intergraph to sue, but then I'm not a\nlawyer. I'd say I'm a cryptologist, but I don't want to incriminate\nmyself under the laws of the new regime.\n\n-Tim May
No, the poster (me) has his brain in the wrong gear.  As you can infer\nfrom the first sentence, I meant the consequences of no backup are *better*\nthan the consequences of an easy to copy database.

Just to make sure everyone is clear on this: "it never has" refers to \n"protects", not "fails to protect"; i.e., in my lifetime I have never seen \nthe U.S. government consistently protect the interest of U.S. citizens, \nexcept by accident.
There are many Urban Legends (maybe this ought to be in the Crypt \nFAQ?) about what is actually sufficient to clear or declassify \nmagnetic media when used for classified data.  Here is some \ninformation "from the horse's mouth".\n\n(Regarding the sufficient overwriting of media ("clearing") meant to \nbe *retained* within the controlled environment, or declassifying \nthe material to be reused *outside* the controlled environment,)\n\nFrom National Telecommunications and Information Systems \nSecurity (NTISS) "Advisory Memorandum on Office Automation \nSecurity Guidelines"  (NTISSAM COMPUSEC/1/87):\n\n------\n\n"7.6.2.1 Clearing of Magnetic Media\n\nCertain types of removable media (e.g., magnetic tape, floppy disk, \ncassettes, and magnetic cards) may be cleared by overwriting the \nentire media one time with any one character.  Floppy disks may be \ncleared by applying a vendor's formatting program that overwrites \neach location with a given character.\n\nFixed media (e.g., Winchester disks) should be cleared by overwriting \nat least one time with any one character.  One way to do this is by \napplying a vendor-supplied formatting program that overwrites each \nlocation on the disk with a given character, if it can be shown that \nthis program actually works as advertised.  The user should beware: \nsome programs that purport to overwrite all locations do not \nactually do this.\n\nCleared media may be resides within the controlled facility or \nreleased for destruction; however, they should be marked and \ncontrolled at the level of the most restrictive sensitivity of \ninformation ever recorded.\n\n7.6.2.2 Declassification of Magnetic Media\n\nCertain types of removable media can be declassified using a \ndegaussing device that has been approved for declassifying media of \nthat type.  (A list of approved devices is maintained by the NSA.)\n\nIf a fixed medium (for example, a hard, or Winchester, disk) is \noperative, an approved method of declassifying the disk pack is to \nemploy an overwrite procedure which must overwrite all \naddressable locations at least three times by writing any character, \nthen its complement (e.g., binary ones and binary zeros) \nalternatively.\n\nWhen fixed  media become inoperative, it is impossible to declassify \nthe media by the overwrite method.  In this case, there are two \nalternate procedures that may be used: (1) disassemble the disk \npack, and degauss each platter with the appropriate approved \ndegaussing equipment; and (2) courier the inoperative media to the \nvendor's facility, have the magnetic media (e.g., disk platter) \nremoved in sight of the courier and returned to the courier for \ndestruction at the secure site.  The vendor can then install new \nplatters and repair any other problems with the disk unit.\n\n7.6.3 Destruction of Magnetic Media"\n\n[see DoD Computer Security Center, "Department of Defense Magnetic \nRemanence Security Guideline", CSC-STD-003-85  FOR OFFICIAL USE \nONLY]\n\n------\n\nThis and many other interesting documents (many that are more \ninformative than probably intended) on computer security procedures \ncan be obtained (free) from:\n\nExecutive Secretary\nNational Telecommunications and Informations\n  Systems Security Committee\nNational Security Agency\nFort George G. Meade, MD  20755-6000\n\nWrite them!  It's fun to be on the NSA's mailing list...
I envision incorporation of new standart into\nvarious communication systems, thus making it prevalent on the market & \ntherefore cheap. The way to do that may be detaching crypto chip from \ncommunication equipment. It seems logical to provide Clipper chip \nto the end-user not as a part of phone, fax, modem & like but in the\nform of smart-card compatible with various telecomm. products. Banks \nwill encourage extensive use of new cards to make transactions by phone.\nNatural step will be to cross-reference this card to the person in the \ngovernment databases - or else this new version of "wiretap proposal" \nmake no sence at all; one wish to eavesdrop (spell.) on the particular \nperson, not on the particular modem or phone.\n \nAs a side note, I disagree with one poster, who said he won't care about\nability of the government to eavesdrop, since they can do that now \nanyway. Clipper will take away electronic survelliance from citizens, \nmaking it monopoly of the government. May be, we can find examples when\ninterceptions made by (unauthorised) people uncovered crimes of \nstate officials ?\n\n\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      For PGP2.1 public key finger mkagalen@lynx.dac.northeastern.edu

If "I forgot" doesn't have as much credibility as you'd like, consider\nthis alternative.  Somewhere on the hard disk, duplicated a few times,\nkeep a 128-bit random number.  When the 128-bit digest of your\npassphrase is computed, it is XORred with the random number before being\nused as the key for your hard disk.  Writing random junk over the random\nnumbers makes the hard disk unreadable by anyone.
Clipper Chip is a response to the fact that there is no business\nor professional body in a position to establish a standard and\nprovide chipsets to implement it for analog or digial transmission\nsystems.\n\nRSA might be in position to do it, if they had active cooperation of\na couple of manufacturers of cellular phones or desktop phones.\n\nLarge companies in the voice/data comm business are out, because they\nall have contracts with the gov which would be used to pressure them.\n\nIf we, as professionals in crypto organizations, EFF, etc. were to\nput our collective minds and interests toward establishing a\ncrypto standard for transmission, and getting our companies to\nimplement it, we might avoid government control.\n\nOtherwise, I think it will happen to us by default.  Gov isn't probably\nstrong enough or foolish enough to prevent strong crypt.  They\nare strong enough, and we may be foolish enough, to push through\nthe Clipper Chip.\n\nIs RSA independt of the gov enough to spearhead this?  I, for one,\nwould *gladly* pay royalties via purchasing secure phones.\n\nIf not this, we should provide an algorithm which can be implemented\nin either SW or HW and publish it, then push to make it the defacto\nstandard in the way that PGP and RIPEM are becoming such.\n\nWe are opposing, charging the bunker.  We should be nimble and clever.\nThe gov is strong, not clever.\n\nLew
I'm attempting to write a serious policy paper examining whether the\nproposed wiretap (or "Clipper") chip is a cost-effective tool for\npolice investigation.  That is, ignoring concerns about government\nintrusions into individual privacy, is the value of easy wiretaps to\ninvestigators greater than the cost to the communications industry,\nand their customers, to support this wiretap technology?  \n\nA rough estimate suggests that wiretaps are worth about five million\ndollars per year to U.S. law enforcement agencies.  (In 1990, 872 U.S.\nwiretaps led to 2057 arrests, while total police expenditures of $28\nbillion led to 11.25 million arrests [ref US Statistical Abstracts].)\nI'm working on estimating this wiretap benefit more accurately, but\nI'd like to ask hardware experts out there to help me with estimating\nthe costs of the new proposed wiretap technology.\n\nPlease send me quotable/citeable estimates for:\n\n- How many chips which would need to be made per year to keep all\n  phones with wiretap chips?\n- How much would it cost to make each chip?\n- How much did it cost to develop this technology in the first place?\n- How much more would supporting hardware, people, etc. cost, per chip?\n- What percentage cheaper would encryption chips and support have been\n  if private enterprise could compete to meet customer encryption needs?\n- What percentage of phone traffic would be taken up by the proposed\n  "law enforcement blocks"?\n- What is the total cost of handling all phone traffic per year?\n\nPut another way, the question I'm asking is, what if each police\nagency that wanted a particular wiretap had to pay for it, being\ncharged their share of the full social cost of forcing communication\nto be wiretap compatible?  Would they choose to buy such wiretaps, or\nwould they find it more cost-effective to instead investigate crimes\nin other ways?
[Prof. Denning's description of SkipJack mostly omitted]\n\n	CHIP STRUCTURE\n	The Clipper Chip contains a classified 64-bit block encryption\n	algorithm called "Skipjack."  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared\n	with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16\n	for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  Throughput is\n	16 Mbits a second. [...]\n\n	F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips\n	N, a 30-bit serial number\n	U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted\n		 with the chip\n	The key K and message stream M (i.e., digitized voice) are then\n	fed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values:\n\n  	   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and \n	   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.  \n\nThree questions:\n1) It looks like each 64 bits of input gives you 4*64 bits of output:\n		E[M;K] = 64 bits\n		E[K;U] = E[ 80 bits ] = 128 bits\n		E[ E[K;U], N ; F ] = E[ 128 + 30 bits ] = 192 bits\n   Do you really need to transmit all 256 bits each time,\n   or do you only transmit the 192 bits of wiretap block at the beginning?   \n   All 256 would be really obnoxious for bandwidth-limited applications\n   like cellular phones (or even regular phones over \n\n2) how do the 4 DES modes interact with the two-part output?\n   Do the various feedback modes only apply to the message block,\n   or also to the wiretap block?  Or, if the wiretap block is only\n   transmitted at the beginning, does it get incorporated into\n   everything through feedback modes, but not during ECB mode?\n\n3) Does the Clipper Chip check the wiretap block itself?\n   Does the block have to be present at all?\n   Since the receiving chip doesn't know the transmitter's U,\n   it presumably can't check the validity of E[K;U], so it's \n   limited to checking the *form* of the wiretap block,\n   and maybe checking the serial number for reasonableness\n   (unless there's some sort of back-door structure that lets\n   it recognize a valid E[K;U].)\n   \n   In that case, can you replace the wiretap block with a DIFFERENT\n   wiretap block, presumably an old valid one to avoid attracting attention?\n   (The chip won't do it, so you postprocess the output.)\n   Regular people can do one with their own serial number and a dummy key;\n   paranoid people can use someone else's serial number.\n\n   On the other hand, if I could think of that solution so easily,\n   presumably the NSA could too - have they done something to block it,\n   like use message encryption that's really E[M; K,U,N] ?\n\n\n	Thanks!
As usual, David Sternlight is demonstrating his inability to read. The\nproposal clearly states:\n\n=> The initiative will involve the creation of new products to\n=> accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure\n=> telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.\n\nIt speaks about telecommunications in general. Read it again, David.\nMaybe you'll understand it the next time... Nah, probably not.\n\n\nThat's exactly what the government wants all sheep-minded people to\nthink. Let's look at the current situation. It allows to almost\nanybody to eavesdrop almost everybody, unless secure (and I mean\nsecure) encryption is used. What will happen when ("if"? Ha!\noptimists...) the new proposal gets accepted? Almost nobody EXCEPT\nSOME will be able to eavesdrop everybody else, but the ability of\nthese "some" to eavesdrop will be guaranteed! The proposal emphasizes\non the former ("almost nobody") - which is clearly an improvement -\nand "forgets" to mention the drawbacks of the latter ("guaranteed").\nYes, my statement assumes that the next step will be to make the\nstrong crypto unlawful. You think that it will not happen? Good luck.\n\n\nIt's not just "continued ability". It's -guaranteed- ability.\n\n\nYeah, that's exactly what your government wants you to think. Let's\ntake small steps, one at a time. Concentrate on the current one, don't\nthink about the future. Trust us.\n\n\nIt's not asked because the proposal clearly says that this is the\nintention. They, unlike you, read what they write.\n\n\nYes, it will. It will stop the jerk who is eavesdropping now. It will\nallow only to the government to eavesdrop. (If the scheme is secure,\nof course, which is yet to be proven.) But how do you know that the\njerk you are fearing now will not get a government job tomorrow? The\nnew proposal -guarantees- him the ability to eavesdrop then. Hell,\nthat will even motivate him to get that job - if he indeed is that\nmentally pervert...\n\n\nGreat. The Greatest Cryptographer of All Times David Sternlight (tm)\nhas succeeded to evaluate the new system in the absense of any\ndetails whatsoever and has concluded that it is "highly secure". I\nguess, that comes from the background of working some 50 years for the\ntwo major crypto evaluating companies, right? Gee, now the government\ncan save all that money and trouble to ask a secret council of crypto\nexperts to secretly analyse the new secret method - for David\nSternlight has already done all the job for them...\n\n\n"Trust us, we're from the Government and we're here to help you."\n\n\n"Those who are prepared to trade their liberties for the promises of\nfuture safety, do not deserve either." This (or something like that; I\ndon't have the exact quote, but the meaning is the same) has been said\nby one of your great men. Maybe you should study their works more\ncarefully, if you have the brains to understand them, of course.\n\n\nThe main question is to guarantee to availability of -really- secure\ncryptography to the masses. Gee, if the proposal was saying "we\nguarantee that every American will still have the full right to use\nany kind of encryption s/he would like and regard this proposal as\njust a default, voluntary implementation", there would have been much\nless opposition... For some reason, they didn't even try to promise\nyou that. I wonder why... Was Orwell off only by 10 years?\n\n\nNo, in return you get crypto that is guaranteed to be crippled.\n\n\nWhile the above is just rumors, and while even if it is true, it is\nnot done -easily-, the new scheme can is guaranteed to be easily\nbreakable by anybody who has the two keys. It might be also breakable\nby somebody who does not have them but knows the right trick. Or who\nhas only one of them. NSA also told you that DES is secure, why don't\nyou simply trust them, huh?\n\n\nIt is -guaranteed- to be -easily- breakable - just get the keys. It\nmight be even easier, but until there is some evidence, this is just a\nwild speculation.\n\n\nThe trapdoors -are- there. In government's hands. The keys.\n\n\nLegitimate? And who decides what communications are legitimate? Oh, I\nguess, it's the government, right? The guys who already have the keys?\nIt's kinda if I have the keys from your car and I am asked to decide\nwho has the right to use it "legitimately"...\n\n\nImpossible, since you are demonstrating the same level of incompetence\nand ignorance as in the provious threads.\n\n\nUnfortunately, I have yet to see you posting a technically competent\nmessage.\n\nRegards,\nVesselin

The program \nfor the workshop will cover all aspects of cryptology. Extended abstracts of \nthe papers presented at the conference will be distributed to all attendees \nat the conference, and formal proceedings will be published at a later date.\n\nIn addition to the regular program of papers selected or invited by the \nprogram committee, there will be a rump session on Tuesday evening for \ninformal presentations. Facilities will also be provided for attendees to \ndemonstrate hardware, software and other items of cryptographic interest. \nIf you wish to demonstrate such items, you are urged to contact the General \nChair so that your needs will be attended to. The social program will include \nhosted cocktail parties on Sunday and Monday. In addition, there will be a \nbeach barbecue on Wednesday evening. The price of the barbecue is included \nin the room and board charge, and extra tickets may be purchased.\n\nABOUT THE CONFERENCE FACILITIES:  The workshop will be held on the campus of \nthe University of California, Santa Barbara. The campus is located adjacent \nto the Santa Barbara airport and the Pacific Ocean. Accommodations are \navailable in the university dormitories at relatively low cost for conference \nparticipants. Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to stay in the \ndormitories, so those bringing small children will need to make separate \narrangements in one of several nearby hotels. More information on hotels is \nenclosed. Parking on campus is available at no cost to the participants. \nHowever, participants must indicate on the registration form if they desire \na parking permit.\n\nTRAVEL INFORMATION:  The campus is located approximately 2 miles from the \nSanta Barbara airport, which is served by several airlines, including \nAmerican, America West, Delta, United, and US Air. Free shuttle bus service \nwill be provided between the Santa Barbara airport and the campus on Sunday \nand Thursday afternoons. All major rental car agencies are also represented \nin Santa Barbara, and AMTRAK has rail connections to San Francisco from the \nnorth and Los Angeles from the south. Santa Barbara is approximately 100 miles \nnorth of Los Angeles airport, and 350 miles south of San Francisco.\n\nREGISTRATION:  Participation is invited by interested parties, but attendance \nat the workshop is limited, and pre-registration is strongly advised. Late \nregistrations, subject to a late registration fee, may be accepted if space \nis available, but there are NO GUARANTEES. To register, fill out the attached \nregistration form and return to the address on the form along with payment in \nfull before July 9, 1993. Campus accommodations will be available on a first \ncome, first serve basis for attendees who register by July 9, 1993. The \nconference fees include participation in the program and all social functions, \nas well as membership to the IACR and a subscription to the Journal of \nCryptology. The room and board charges include dormitory lodging and meals \nare available to those unable to obtain funding.

Those who choose to stay off campus are \nresponsible for making their own reservations, and early reservations are \nadvised since August is a popular season in Santa Barbara. Note that Goleta \nis closer to UCSB than Santa Barbara, but that a car will probably be \nrequired to travel between any hotel and the campus. All prices are subject \nto change; prices should be confirmed by calling the individual hotels \ndirectly. However, mention CRYPTO'93 when you are making your reservation and \nin several of the hotels listed you will be eligible for the university rate \nwhich can be significantly less than the normal rates. We are not able to \nblock rooms in these hotels, so please make reservations as early as \npossible.

Sigh... my version of 'rn' asked me whether I really want to send this\nposting!\n\nYou may as well know that all this stuff about the secret source of the\nClipper announcement is because of a silly mistake.  I am the administrator\nof csrc.ncsl.nist.gov, alias first.org.  It's a system set up to help out\nthe needs of FIRST, a Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams, which \nincludes a number of world-wide incident response teams such as CERT/CC and\nother places in Europe.  As to the VRFY and EXPN commands, they are normally\ndisabled, since early on we didn't want crackers to find out the names of\nincident response folks on our mailing lists.  We had a disk crash several\nmonths ago which required completely rebuilding the O/S files - same old\nstory, our backups weren't especially helpful.  As you can guess, I didn't\nremember to re-disable VRFY and EXPN until I saw people on the net trying to\nfind out who was behind clipper@csrc...  When I saw people's names posted\nhere, I felt it was time to clear things up.  So, EXPN and VRFY on csrc have\nalways been disabled in the past for reasons having nothing to do with \nClipper.\n\nI posted the White House announcements at the request of policy folks here\nbecause csrc also provides Usenet service.  I posted them from an account\ncalled 'clipper.'  I also created an alias called 'clipper' that contains\nthe addresses of members of the NIST Computer Security Privacy and Advisory\nBoard, set up under law of the Computer Security Act of 1987, and addresses\nof other individuals not affiliated with NIST but involved in cryptography,\nsecurity, and privacy - I believe that these individuals were included on\nthis list because NIST felt it important to get them the Clipper information\nfirst-hand.\n\nThe 'clipper' alias is there for the benefit of those named above.  It is \nnot a source for information, it was set up solely to monitor any initial\ntraffic.  Individuals on the list have requested that they continue to get\ntraffic that is not already duplicated on Usenet.\n\nWhile you can rightfully say we were a bit disorganized in handling this,\nI would ask that people stop speculating about any hidden agendas or motives\nof the individuals on the 'clipper' alias - I've already apologized to them\nfor what's happened.  Disabling EXPN and VRFY is an increasingly common\npractice (albeit unfriendly to some), and any effect of disabling it again\nwas unintentional.
[...]\n\n[...]\n\nI was a cryptologic tech in the US Navy (CTRSN, nothing big).  All 'spooks'\nin the Navy are required to know the "gist" of "USSID 18", the Navy-way of\nnaming a particular Presidential "Executive Order".  It outlines what spooks\ncan and can't do with respect to the privacy of US nationals.\n\nThe following information is (of course) UNCLASSIFIED.\n\nThe whole issue hangs about what you mean by "wiretap".  If the signal can\nbe detected by "non-intrusive" means (like radio listening), then it may be\nrecorded and it may be "analyzed".  "Analyzed" means that it may be either\ndeciphered and/or radio-location may be used to locate the transmitter.\n\nThe catch is this:  Any and all record of the signal and its derivatives\nmay only be kept for a maximum of 90 days, after which they are destroyed\nunless permission is obtained from the US Attorney General to keep them.\n\nDidn't you ever wonder how Coast Guard cutters *find* those drug-runners\nin all those tens of thousands of square miles of sea, even in the dark?!?
The chip and algorithm are classified.  If you reverse engineer it and\ntell people, you are likely to go to jail.\n\nPerhaps some foreign governments or corporations could help us out by\ncracking the system outside the USA.  The US government could probably\nstop importation of clone hardware, but a software implementation\nshould be practical.
In this giant bally-ho over this Clipper chip I noticed a rather\ndisturbing trend in some of the E-mail and posts I've tossing back and\nforth.  \n\nSomebody asked me what was wrong about overreacting in cases such as this.\n\nThe reason is very simple:  How many people do you want to die in a riot? \nIn a new Civil War? \n\nEverybody is jumping up and down and screaming about it, and I'm worried\nthat people are going to reach for their hammers and rifles before their pens\nand paper.  \n\nCan people work within the system before trying to break it?  Examine your\nhistory books, and find out how many armed revolutions led to Democratic\n(or Democratic style) governments.  I think you'll only find one in over\nfive thousand years of written history.\n\nThat's not very good odds.  \n\nSomebody once said something like: "Armed Violence is meant only to be\nused in response to an armed attack.  It is not meant to be used in\nagression.  This is the difference between self-defence and murder."\n\nLet's try to avoid killing things, eh?  There's enough blood shed in the\nworld, without adding a couple of riots, Civil Wars, etc.\n\nI'm probably overreacting.  But what I've read scared me a lot.  I don't\nwant my children growing up in a War Zone.
I perhaps should have been clearer and more concise in my post, but that's\nwhat I get from posting at 1 am...\n\nThe central point I made is that local/state police agencies attempting to\nplay by the rules and get warrants, legit escrowed keys, etc., may find\nthemselves at the mercy of bureaucratic inertia and agency infighting\nat the federal level.  \n\nI disagree that this would assist civil liberties by hobbling the cowboy\ncops.  It would be a strong incentive, as Vesselin points out, for more\npolice agencies to "go rogue" and try to get keys through more efficient\n\n   Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\n        a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\n        encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\n        decipher the message?\n\n   A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\n                                                       ^^^^^^^^^^\n        court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.\n        ^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThe clear implication is that there are "legal" authorizations other\nthan a court order.  Just how leaky are these?  (And who \nknows what's in those 7 pages that authorized the NSA?).  There\nmay well arise a black market of sorts _within_ police agencies, in which\nkeys are traded.  Furthermore, the police will be in an excellent\nposition to carry out this kind of thing without being caught.  They\nalready have a communication infrastructure with secure portions.  There\nare a few laws that I know of, that limit citizens' rights to access\npolice communications (or use the information they get).  It may be\nvery difficult to prove police misuse -- the fact that you have such\nevidence may itself be evidence that YOU have broken some other law.\n\nThrow in private detectives, who have even fewer policy/constitutional\nrestrictions.  Also consider mercenaries who've "retired" from intelligence\nagencies.  William Gibson must be loving it.  Great story material.\n\nDon't think it'll happen?  \n\nWell, consider e.g. the Michigan State Police, generally a very professional\norganization, which for years kept "Red Files" on thousands of suspected \ncommies, knowing full well it was not consititutional.  The standards\nof evidence were just about zero: people were in the file because they\nhappened to park near a place where, say, a US-China People's Friendship\nrally was happening -- the police went around writing down license\nplate numbers.  If you happened to be visiting a friend who lived near the \nmeeting place, well, the state police wound up filing you as a subversive.\n(They were eventually found out and a court ruled against carrying on any\nmore such nonsense.  I believe thay may have had to destroy the tapes\nas well.)\n\nEven with well-meaning cops (and I'm sure there are many), there will \nbe strong pressure to bend the constitutional safeguards.  We don't need\nto assume corrupt or unbalanced officers -- it will all be in the interest \nof enforcing sensible laws, saving lives, and protecting property.  \nCompromises will be made by well-meaning officers, facing what (to them) \nwill be a moral dilemma.\n\nClipper will make criminals out of cops.  Do we want to do this to our\npolice forces?
Preventing black market chips w/non-escrowed keys IS exactly what they\nmean by protecting the security of the key escrow system.  There are\ntwo parts to the security of such a system:\n  \n    (a) Preventing decruption by unauthorized personel\n    (b) Assuring that the gummit can always decrypt clipper\n        traffic when it authorizes itself to do so.\n\nOf course, the ministry of propoganda will do a lot of tallking about\n(a) and very little about (b).\n\n                                        rob boudrie\n                                        rboudrie@chpc.org
It seems pretty obvious that it will be made illegal if VERY LOUD NOISE is\nnot made about this IMMEDIATELY to Congress and the House!\n\n \nI don't know what's worse - the waste of money, or the fact that (in SPITE\nof all Clinton's rhetoric to the contrary) this is a feeble attempt by\na large group of bored intelligence bureaucrats to justify their currently\nuseless jobs. Clinton said he was going to trim the fat from the government.\nThis doesn't look very dietetic to me! \n\nAs I said before in this group: drug dealing and terrorism both tend to\nbe international crimes which are not going to cease if the US starts to\nregulate encryption. The drug dealers and terrorists will simply go to\nother countries to communicate their plans, and will still carry them out\nhere and/or wherever else. This is not the solution to the problem.\n\nThey try to invent a new problem by saying we "need" encryption. I guess\nit's a good thing Bill Gates isn't a 4-star general or we would all "need"\nour own copies of MS-DOS too, right?\n\nUnd vee haff vays uff findink out iff you are usink DOCTOR DOS!!\n\n\nOur health care and education systems are in the toilet and they come up\nwith THIS pearl. If this goddamned government doesn't get a clue real quick\nand start trying to repair the infrastructure of the country rather than\ninventing someone to blame, Germany and Japan are going to eat the US alive,\nand we will deserve it. It's not like there's any shortage of REAL problems\nto solve, guys! \n\nA Clipper chip is really going to help the homeless! A Clipper chip is\nreally going to help educate the children in the ghettos of our cities!\nJust think of the generation gap that can be developed when they rehire\nDoD engineer dad to work on Clipper chips that will be used to decrypt\nslightly rebellious adolescent hacker son's naughty GIF files! I can see\nthe shitcom already.\n\nIf that wasn't a forged post or a sick joke, I'm popping that Dead Kennedys\ntape into the car stereo and tearing ass to Canada. Clinton on White Horse\nis near. It's the suede/denim secret police! They have come for your uncool\nniece! Don't worry it's only a phone...shit, I knew I should have gotten\nsome of those "consent to monitoring" stickers they keep on Autovon phones\nwhen I had the chance. I should have known I'd need them in civilian life.
No, he gives the keys to the FBI (who may then give them to the local police\non request) who then simply put some alagator clips on your phone junction\nbox and conduct an illegal tap. They then decrypt when they recover the tape.\nIts just doing what the government does best: breaking the law.
Oh? Hellman said ``each user will get to choose his or her own key.''\nThat's the key which I called K_P, the session key. According to\nHellman, if Alice and Bob are communicating with the Clipper Chip,\nthen Alice chooses ``her own key'' and Bob chooses ``his own key.''\nThis is incompatible with the suggestion that when Alice and Bob are\ntalking, they use a _common_ K_P, chosen by classical or public-key\napproaches.\n\nThe protocol/key-management description published so far is either\nincomplete or incorrect. It leaves me with no idea of how the system\nwould actually _work_. I hope the CPSR FOIA request succeeds so that\nwe get full details.
Are you sure you aren't being watched?  Let me remind you that \nWatergate was only the tip of the iceberg.  Nixon extensively used the NSA\nto watch people because he didn't like them.  According to _Decrypting the\nPuzzle Palace_:\n\n	Presumably, the NSA is restricted from conducting American surveillance\n	by both the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978(FISA) and a\n	series of presidential directives, beginning with one issued by\n	President Ford following Richard Nixon's bold misuse of the NSA, in\n	which he explicitly directed the NSA to conduct widespread domestic\n	surveillance of political dissidents and drug users.
Probably keep quiet and take it, lest they get their kneecaps busted.
Uh, I'm afraid that your information is slightly out of date... PKWare\nhas obtained a license to export their program to the whole world,\nexcept a very limited list of countries... Draw your own conclusions\nabout the strength of the algorithm... :-)\n\nRegards,\nVesselin
If Clipper comes to cellular phones along with legal proscriptions against\nusing other cipher systems on these phones, a new and potentially dangerous\nclass of crime is created.\n\nCriminals who very badly want inscrutable tactical communications (specifically\nthe terrorists and drug dealers who proponents of key escrow cite as threats)\nwill be highly motivated to steal the cipher phone of a legitimate user, and\nto kill this person or hold them hostage so discovery of compromise of the\ndevice will be delayed.\n\nOnce a suitable collection of devices is stolen, criminals can communicate\nwith impunity (assuming the cipher system carries no trapdoors apart from\nkey escrow) until and unless the compromise is discovered by some other means.\n\nBecause life-is-cheap criminals are currently willing to kill people to steal\nvery large and conspicuous property (luxury cars), it is reasonable to assume\nthat they will be willing to kill people to steal small and inconspicuous\nproperty (a cipher cellular phone).  Just as we have seen in the past with\n"blue box" technology, and in the present with modified cellular phones,\nwe can expect to see among high-stakes criminals a lucrative market for\nstolen cipher phones which can be used for a few days.  The high-stakes\ncriminals will pay the life-is-cheap types substantial amounts for stolen\ninstruments.\n\nBecause a person is typically discovered as missing or dead in a few days,\na stolen instrument will be usable for only a few days.  There will be a\ncontinuing demand for fresh phones: fresh bodies.\n\nIn other words, Clipper and similar systems have the potential to turn a\ncurrent inconvenience to law enforcement into a direct, vicious, and\npersistent threat to the general public.\n\nOn the other hand, if a criminal were to apply some arbitrary cipher to a\ndevice in a mostly non-ciphered network, the communication will at least\nstand out as being unusual, and perhaps worthy of other means of investigation.\n\nFinally, because there is essentially no possibility of intercepting in\nrealtime the scrutable content of communications between stolen instruments,\nthere will exist strong motivation to record and archive _all_ communications\nin the network for ex-post-facto scrutiny (once some criminal act is discovered,\nand the instruments involved have been identified).  While recording and\narchiving may not be feasible for wireline networks, it is probably feasible\nacross the more limited bandwidth of radio networks.  The existence of these\nrecordings could open up vast potential for abuse.
Doesn't this just mean that the government might not approve\nsomething for use by other government agencies.  This does not\nsound to me to be any form of threat that Joe User can't develop\nand use his own encryption algorithm.
grady@netcom.com suggests using a common but restricted-distribution private\nkey to allow public key system encrypted postings. In theory that will work\nfine as long as the privae key remains secure.\n\nIn practice it would be a good idea to check to see if that would be a\nviolation of some net rule, practice, custom, etc. I don't say it would be,\njust that it would be a good idea to check. This is not like rot13 where\neverybody can have the key trivially.\n\nIt would also be a good idea to check to see if such posts would be\nforwarded by the sites needed to make the chain work.\n\nOf course there'd be no problem with a discussion group travelling over\nfacilities entirely under the control of the members. Probably there would\nalso be no problem with a mailing list approach. It might even  be fun for\nsome.
: The cops/feds do *not* need to be able to get hold of your private key to\n: listen in to cellular conversations.  Encryption is not end-to-end, but \n: cellphone to base-station - it *has* to be this way so that cellular users\n: and fixed installations can talk to each other.  For cellular to cellular\n: calls, the transmission is decrypted at the base-station, passed to another\n: base-station and re-encrypted.  The cops/feds can listen to the unscrambled\n: call *provided* they get a warrant to tap into the cellular provider's\n: equipment.  The only reason for wanting a crackable system is so they can\n: listen without having to obtain a warrant.\n\n: But, maybe the Clipper system is secure, and they really do need a warrant\n: to get the key out of escrow before they can listen in using a scanner (see\n: above - they don't *have* to go down this route anyway).  I have my doubts,\n: but even if true once they have the key they will *never* again need a\n: warrant to tap into that particular phone whenever they want.  `Well, Judge,\n: it appears he wasn't a drug-dealer after all, so naturally we'll stop\n: listening in'...\n\nThat was true for the UK Paul, but I'm fairly sure they're talking about\nbuilding end-to-end encryption phones out of this chip.  It's *not* for\ncellular (though it certainly could be used there in the way you suggest)
Wouldn't a a second monitor of similar type scrolling gibberish and adjacent\nto the one being used provide reasonable resistance to tempest attacks?
I am a new reader of sci.crypt I would like to obtain a copy of a\npublic domain program that can encrypt files, preferably using DES,\nthat runs under MS-DOS.\n\nI would also like to obtain a program which will password protect\nfloppy disks, if this is possible.\n\nThanks.
Here is a disturbing thought.\n\nNow, we no longer live in the days of big filing cabinets. We live in\nthe electronic age. I asked myself, how big could the escrow database\nget? How hard might it be to steal the whole thing, particularly were\nI an NSA official operating with the tacit permission of the escrow\nhouses? (We can pretend that such will not happen, but thats naive.)\n\nWell, lets see. Ten bytes of each escrow half. Lets asume ten bytes of\nserial number -- in fact, I believe the serial number is smaller, but\nthis is an order of magnitude calculation. We assume 250*10^6 as the\npopulation, and that each person has a key. I get five gigabytes for\neach of the two escrow databases. Fits conveniently on a single very\nvaluable Exabyte tape. This can only get easier with time, but who\ncares -- I can already hold all the clipper keys in the country in my\npocket on two 8mm tapes.\n\nAdmittely, they will think of safeguards. They won't put the whole\ndatabase on one disk, prehaps. Maybe they will throw stumbling blocks\nin the way. This changes nothing -- they keys will be needed every day\nby hundreds if not thousands of law enforcement types, so convenience\nwill dictate that the system permit quick electronic retrieval. At\nsome point, with or without collusion by the agencies, those exabyte\ntapes are going to get cut. Dorothy Denning and David Sternlight will\ndoubtless claim this can't happen -- but we know that "can't" is a\nprayer, not a word that in this instance connotes realism.\n\nWith two exabyte tapes in your pocket, you would hold the keys for\nevery person's conversations in the country in your hands. Yeah, you\nneed the "master key" two -- but thats just ten bytes of information\nthat have to be stored an awful lot of places.\n\nCome to think of it, even if the NSA getting a copy of the database\nisn't a threat to you because unlike me you have no contraversial\npolitical views, consider foreign intelligence services. You know, the\nones that David Sternlight wants to protect us from because of the\nevil industrial espionage that they do. The French apparently do have\na big spying operation in friendly countries to get industrial\nsecrets, so he isn't being completely irrational here (although why\nour companies couldn't use cryptosystems without back doors is left\nunexplained by those that point out this threat.) \n\nPresumably, foreign intelligence services can get moles into the NSA\nand other agencies. We have proof by example of this: its happened\nmany times. Presumably, someday they will get their hands on some\nfraction of the keys. You can't avoid that sort of thing.\n\nDon't pretend that no one unauthorized will ever get their hands on\nthe escrow databases.\n\nWe crypto types are all taught something very important at the\nbeginning of intro to cryptography -- security must depend on the\neasily changed key that you pick to run your system, and not on a\nsecret. The escrow databases aren't the sorts of secrets that our\nteachers told us about, but they are the sort of big secrets they\nwould lump into this category. Imagine trying to replace 100 million\nClipper chips.\n\nI cannot believe that the NSA or whomever it is thats doing this\ndoesn't realize all this already. They are too smart. There are too\nmany of them who have made their bones in the real world. I suspect\nthat they know precisely what they are doing -- and that what they are\ndoing is giving us the appearance of safety so that they can continue\nto surveil in spite of the growth of strong cryptography. I suspect\nthat they realize that they can't put things off forever, but they can\ntry to delay things as long as possible.\n\nWho knows. Maybe even some of the higher ups, the inevitable\nbureaucratic types that rise in any organization, really do believe\nthat this scheme might give people some security, even as their\nsubordinates in Fort Meade wring their hands over the foolishness of\nit all.\n\n--\nPerry Metzger		pmetzger@shearson.com

To be sure, I wouldn't put it past them -- but raising the\npossibility of such crime has the benefit of forcing the Feds to either\n'fess up about such intentions in advance or state that using Clipper\nexposes the user to an additional criminal threat. <g>\n\n > No, the criminals will just use some secure encryption.

Without real technical details, it's hard to answer this question. But\nsuppose they already *are* XORing the two 40-bit parts to produce only\n40 bits of real key material? Maybe they're using the exportable version\nof RC2...? :-)
a global key G, plus one key U_C for each chip C. The user can choose a\nnew session key K_P for each phone call P he makes. Chip C knows three\nkeys: G, its own U_C, and the user's K_P. The government as a whole\nknows G and every U_C. Apparently a message M is encrypted as\nE_G(E_{U_C}(K_P),C) , E_{K_P}(M). That's it.\n\nThe system as described here can't possibly work. What happens when\nsomeone plugs the above ciphertext into a receiving chip? To get M\nthe receiving chip needs K_P; to get K_P the receiving chip needs U_C.\nThe only information it can work with is C. If U_C can be computed\nfrom C then the system is cryptographically useless and the ``key\nescrow'' is bullshit. Otherwise how is a message decrypted?
Stupid me. I believed the Democrats stood for principles of personal\n   privacy while it was the Neanderthal Republicans that wanted into every\n   aspect of our lives. \n   Clinton is just more clever than the other guy. Looks like gun control for\n   privacy technology. One small step at a time.\n\nRemember "Defend Firearms - Defeat Dukakis", followed by Bush's soon-after-\nelection support for gun-control?   This is the Democrats' version\n"Defend Free Speech - Reject Republicans" followed by speech control.\n\n   Wait a minute....  Let me think about this.\n\n   Hmmm, I feel better now. I believe the White House when they tell us\n   this first step is, in fact, the final step. All is OK. We've nothing to fear.\n   They're here to help us.

Also not a lawyer, etc. but if I remember correctly the Contempt of Court\nbusiness is used in order to compel cooperation with what is (perhaps\nquestionably, different issue) the legitimate business of that court. Quite\nliterally the party is found guilty of holding the court "in contempt". Now,\nthe original scheme as suggested here would be to have the key disappear if\ncertain threatening conditions are met.

No kidding.  The most recent post I saw in alt.privacy.clipper (and I\nhope anyone interested in this topic ends up there) states that Clipper\nhas been in development for over four years.\n\n    I am, however, more than a little PO'd that Clinton put his name on\nthis monstrosity, or even allowed it to get out the door, for that matter.\nHe's already heard from me, and I hope you'll all take the time to voice\nyour extreme displeasure as well.
From the limited details released so far, It seems that the clipper chip \nsystem must employ some sort of public key cryptography. Otherwise, the key \nmanagement problems inherent to symetric ciphers would make the system \nunworkable. It probably has some sort of public key exchange that takes place\nat the start of each call. Thats how they would identify the private key in \ntheir data base?\n\nThis means that either the NSA has developed some non RSA public key \nalgorythm or the feds have decided to subsidize PKP & RSADSI. The former is \nrather an exciting posibility since keeping the algorythm secret while making\nchip implimentations widely avalibe will be exceptionally hard. If the feds\nare forced to make it avalible in order to gain public acceptance than that \ncould break RSA's stranglehold on public key crypto in the U.S.   \n\nAs for my impressions of the whole scheme It seems that instead of trying to\nban strong crypto, they are trying to co-opt it. Their contention that they \nneed to keep the algorythm secret to protect the security of the key\nregistration suggests possible inherent weakness to the algorythm. More likely\nis that they dont want anyone constructing black market devices which dont \nhave the keys registered. Anyone else notice that in their Q&A session, they\ntalk about releasing the keys only to people with proper autiorization but\ncarefully dance around stating that the keys will simply have to be supeonaed.\nThey seem to be trying to keep open the posibility of obtaining keys without \ncourt order even though tapping a phone line requires one. Also pick up on \ntheir implicit threat of eithe accept this or we'll ban strong crypto outright?\nI dont trust this plan at all and plan to oppose it in all (legal) ways\npossible.
If the Clipper chip can do cheap crypto for the masses, obviously one\ncould do the same thing WITHOUT building in back doors.\n\nIndeed, even without special engineering, you can construct a good\nsystem right now. A standard codec chip, a chip to do vocoding, a DES\nchip, a V32bis integrated modem module, and a small processor to do\nglue work, are all you need to have a secure phone. You can dump one\nor more of the above if you have a fast processor. With integration,\nyou could put all of them onto a single chip -- and in the future they\ncan be.\n\nYes, cheap crypto is good -- but we don't need it from the government.\nYou can do everything the clipper chip can do without needing it to be\ncompromised. When the White House releases stuff saying "this is good\nbecause it gives people privacy", note that we didn't need them to\ngive us privacy, the capability is available using commercial hardware\nright now.\n\nIndeed, were it not for the government doing everything possible to\nstop them, Qualcomm would have designed strong encryption right in to\nthe CDMA cellular phone system they are pioneering. Were it not for\nthe NSA and company, cheap encryption systems would be everywhere. As\nit is, they try every trick in the book to stop it. Had it not been\nfor them, I'm sure cheap secure phones would be out right now.\n\nThey aren't the ones making cheap crypto available. They are the ones\nkeeping cheap crypto out of people's hands. When they hand you a\nclipper chip, what you are getting is a mess of pottage -- your prize\nfor having traded in your birthright.\n\nAnd what did we buy with our birthright? Did we get safety from\nforeigners? No. They can read conference papers as well as anyone else\nand are using strong cryptography. Did we get safety from professional\nterrorists? I suspect that they can get cryptosystems themselves on\nthe open market that work just fine -- most of them can't be idiots\nlike the guys that bombed the trade center. Are we getting cheaper\ncrypto for ourselves? No, because the market would have provided that\non its own had they not deliberately sabotaged it.\n\nSomeone please tell me what exactly we get in our social contract in\nexchange for giving up our right to strong cryptography?\n--\nPerry Metzger		pmetzger@shearson.com
The dead giveaway is the repeated protestations that the new plan is aimed\nat "criminals", "drug dealers", "terrorists", etc.  You'd think the tactic\nwould be too obvious to trot out yet again after a decade of Sarah and the\nrest of the Brady Bunch using it to destroy the Second Amendment, but evidently\nthe control nuts feel it will serve them one more time.
Nice to think, but naive.  The fact is that millions of people today\nare sending highly confidential information over unencoded, easy to\nreceive cellular phones.  They figure the chances of being heard are\nsmall, so they risk it.\n\nAnd 99.9% of people don't understand crypto the way the least of the\nsci.crypt newbies does.   If Clinton tells them it's good crypto,\nthey'll believe him, and send important stuff over it, and be thankful\nthat they're no longer using clear-voice FM cellular phones.\n\nOnly a tiny fraction of people will want more crypto.  Worse, in the\neyes of the government, which swears up and down the algorithim is\nspook-level secure (and it may indeed be) the only reason you could\npossibly want this extra level is to avoid police.\n\nBy using it, you'll attract attention as a likely lawbreaker.\n\n"Your honour, the suspect suddenly started using another level of\ncryptography and we can't tap his phone calls any more.  He must\nhave something to hide.  Please sign the warrant to search his\nhouse..."
This must have been in the works for some time.  The Bush administration must\nhave been working on it for quite a while.  --Clinton simply took the credit (or\nblame, depending on how you look at it).
I hope there is something I don't understand about this system, but can\nsomeone tell me how these chips are going to be manufactured while maintaining\neach half key under total control of the separate escrow agencies? Don't\nboth halfs of the key have to come together (in some form) at the time\nthe chip is constructed?\n\nOr is it built like a fusable prom, with the chip being sent to the 1st\nescrow agency to program its 1/2 key, then the 2nd agency to program its\n1/2 key (but who invents the safeguards that prevent the 2nd agency from\nreading the information already programmed by the 1st)?\n\nThis isn't intended to be a flame or anything, I am just really curious\nhow to manufacture these things while still maintaining the key escrow\nsecurity without simply saying "trust the manufacturer, they won't look".
If there is anyone attending the ISSA conference in Arlington, VA next\nweek, I would appreciate them getting in touch with me.
Though some may argue about the nose of the camel, it's worth noting that\nthe government proposal is limited to scrambled telephony. If it is only\nused for that purpose, and does not extend to electronic mail or file\nencryption, then it IS an improvement over the current mass-produced\nstandard civilian technology which, with a few exceptions, is limited to\neasy-to-break inverters.\n\nNote that the big issue for the feds is the continued ability to wiretap.\nBefore we go off the deep end with long discusions about secure crypto for\ne-mail and files, let's focus on this.\n\nOne question that was not asked in the release is whether this proposal is\nlimited to telephony, or if the government intends to expand it.\n\nThough I share many of the concerns expressed by some, I find the proposal\nless threatening than many others, since right now most Americans have no\nsecure telephony, and any jerk with a pair of clip leads and a "goat" can\neavesdrop. This would also plug up the security hole in cellular and\ncordless phones.\n\n-------\n\nReading between the lines, I infer that the system is highly secure\nwithout access to the keys. This would meet the needs of U.S. businesses\nconfronted by rich and powerful adversaries, including French and Japanese\nsecurity services and rich Japanese companies. It allows the NSA to make\navailable some of its better stuff while protecting law enforcement needs.\n\nMost legitimate U.S. corporations trust the NSA, and would be delighted to\nhave a high-security system certified by them, even at the price of\ndepositing keys in escrow. I see no difficulty in creating a reliable\nescrow. Corporations entrust their secrets to attorneys every day of the\nweek, and that system has worked pretty well.\n\nFrom my point of view this is a fair starting point. There are concerns that\nneed to be addressed, including the reliability of the escrows. But in\nreturn we get access to high-security crypto. Many have suggested that DES\nand other systems may be breakable by the NSA and hence others similarly\nskilled and endowed. There is at least a good possibility (which should be\nchecked) that the proposed system is not so breakable. It doesn't have to\nbe, nor does it have to have trapdoors, if the government can get the keys\npursuant to a legitimate court order. Thus they can protect legitimate\ncommunications against economic adversaries, while still being able to\neavesdrop on crooks pursuant to a court order.\n\n------\n\nIn discussing this, let's try to avoid the nastiness, personal attacks and\nnoise of some previous threads. This is a substantive and technical issue,\nand personal remarks have no place in such a discussion.
Hi !\n\nI am interested in the source of FEAL encryption algorithm.\nDoes someone of you know where I can get the source from, or\nwhere I can find documentation about FEAL.\n\nThanks in advance\n\n\nCiao Hermann
[An article from comp.org.eff.news, EFFector Online 5.06 - Carl]\n\n                       April 16, 1993\n\n      INITIAL EFF ANALYSIS OF CLINTON PRIVACY AND SECURITY  \n                           PROPOSAL\n\n       The Clinton Administration today made a major announcement \non cryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of \nmillions of Americans.  The first part of the plan is to begin a \ncomprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues \nsuch as export controls which have effectively denied most people \neasy access to robust encryption as well as law enforcement issues \nposed by new technology.\n\n       However, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has \nalready reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before \nany public comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the \nAdministration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone \nequipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed \nby the National Security Agency. The so-called "Clipper Chip" is an \n80-bit, split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into \nchips manufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow \nagents would store users' keys, and be required to turn them over \nlaw enforcement upon presentation of a valid warrant.  The \nencryption scheme used is to be classified, but they chips will be \navailable to any manufacturer for incorporation into their \ncommunications products.\n\n       This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .\n\n       First, the Administration appears to be adopting a solution \nbefore conducting an inquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper chip may \nnot be the most secure product. Other vendors or developers may \nhave better schemes. Furthermore, we should not rely on the \ngovernment as the sole source for Clipper or any other chips.  Rather,\nindependent chip manufacturers should be able to produce chipsets \nbased on open standards.\n\n       Second, an algorithm can not be trusted unless it can be tested. \nYet the Administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm \nclassified.  EFF believes that any standard adopted ought to be public \nand open.  The public will only have confidence in the security of a \nstandard that is open to independent, expert scrutiny.  \n\n       Third, while the use of the split-key, dual-escrowed \nsystem may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and \nlaw enforcement needs, the details of this scheme must be explored \npublicly before it is adopted.  What will give people confidence in the \nsafety of their keys?  Does disclosure of keys to a third party waive \nindividual's fifth amendment rights in subsequent criminal \ninquiries?  \n\n       In sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the \nimportance of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into \ndigital privacy and security.  However, the "Clipper chip" solution \nought to be considered as part of the inquiry, not be adopted before \nthe discussion even begins.\n\nDETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:\n\nESCROW\n\nThe 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of \nwhom hold 40 bits of each key.  Upon presentation of a valid \nwarrant, the two escrow agents would have to turn the key parts \nover to law enforcement agents.  Most likely the Attorney General \nwill be asked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the \nAdministration have suggested one non-law enforcement federal \nagency, perhaps the Federal Reserve, and one non-governmental \norganization.  But, there is no agreement on the identity of the agents \nyet.\n\nKey registration would be done by the manufacturer of the \ncommunications device.  A key is tied to the device, not to the person \nusing it.\n\nCLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS\n\nThe Administration claims that there are no back door means by \nwhich the government or others could break the code without \nsecuring keys from the escrow agents and that the President will \nbe told there are no back doors to this classified algorithm.  In order \nto prove this, Administration sources are interested in arranging for \nan all-star crypto cracker team to come in, under a security \narrangement, and examine the algorithm for trap doors.  The results \nof the investigation would then be made public.\n\nGOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER\n\nIn order to get a market moving, and to show that the government \nbelieves in the security of this system, the feds will be the first big \ncustomers for this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service, \nVP Al Gore, and maybe even the President. \n\nFROM MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:\n\nJerry Berman, Executive Director\nDaniel J.

Following precedent in other areas, the government is likely to put a tax on\nencryption technology.  Once the tax is imposed, it becomes a federal matter\nand suspicision of an unlicensed cryptographic tool will bring the BATF or\nFBI tossing grenades into your house.  (The BATF appears to be the logical\nagency to enforce such regulations: federal control over alocohol, tobacco,\nand firearms is similary based on taxes.)\n\nLook at the FCC: they won't allow sale of any receiever that can receive\nbands that are supposed to be private.  This has nothing to do with any\ndesire to prevent harmful interference. If the government can make a radio\nreceiver illegal what makes you think they won't claim the right to control\nencryption?

I agree.  So why is Cylink the only (and expensive) game in town?\n\nNote: I think Cylink is great, and if my boss would double my salary, I'd buy \na bunch of their stuff :).\n\nOne thing that Clipper offers is interoperability, at a higher degree of \nsecurity than we currently have in non-proprietary voice encryption systems.\nThis means it will be cheaper than anyone's proprietary scheme, and easier to \ndeploy.  This is, of course, either a bug or a feature depending on how you \nlook at it :).\n\n\nGreat!  Where can I buy it?\n\nAnother note: If "Clipper" increases the incentive to bring stronger \nencryption to the mass market, all the better.  It's far overpriced at \nthe moment.\n\n\nI don't care where we *need* to get it from, I care where we *can* get it \nfrom, and whether it will interoperate with everyone else.\n \n\nYou can build them right now as long as you don't want to export (a \nrestriction I firmly oppose).  The only thing stopping people from making \ncheap encryption is greed: they want a lock on the market.\n\n\nOh, come on.  Only if you trust it farther than it deserves.  A Clipper phone \n*IS NOT* a substitute for a Cylink phone, or a STU-III.  It's a substitute \nfor the "voice scramblers" advertised in the back of Radio Electronics.\n\n\nI disagree.  Modulo ITAR, it's not the government that has sabotaged the \nmarket.\n\n\nCan you tell me where exactly we have given up that right?
Fascinating.  Most of the content of the White House announcements was\nin what was *not* said.  It gives us almost nothing of value, threatens to\ntake away a lot, and does it with a sincere smile on its face,\nand the nice friendly word "Management".\n\n			      FACT SHEET\n		     PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENT\n\nThe first thing it doesn't say is "We're giving you stronger encryption".\nwhat it says is \n   the U. S. Government has developed a microcircuit that not only\n   provides privacy through encryption that is substantially more robust\n   than the current government standard, but also permits escrowing of\n   the keys needed to unlock the encryption.  The system for the\n   escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to\n   encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization.\nBut DES is strong enough that only the government can break it now,\nso the major effect is to make it EASIER for government to break!\n*At best* it makes it more difficult for the NSA to break, since they\nneed to get one of the two escrowed keys to do a brute-force search\nfor the other 40-bit key.\n\nSimilarly, it didn't say "We're making encryption is commercially available."\nbecause encryption *is* already commercially available, including\nforms the NSA may not be able to break, like triple-DES or IDEA.\nAnd phone companies could offer DES-based systems *now* if they were\nconvinced the government would let them and they could make enough money.\n\nThe next thing it didn't say is "We're making encryption legal",\nbecause of course encryption *has always been* legal, and the\nPresident can't change the First Amendment merely by decree.\nWhat it *did* say was:\n	In making this decision, I do not intend to prevent the\n	private sector from developing, or the government from approving,\n	other microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in\n	assuring both privacy and a secure key- escrow system.\nwhich clearly means "We're making encryption illegal unless we get your keys.\nSoon.  Once business buys into this."\n\nAnother thing it didn't say is "We're going to ask Congress for money\nto do *lots* more wiretapping", because of course, there's a budget crisis,\nand Congress might debate the policy issues or not give them the cash.\nWhat it *did* say was:\n   The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to\n   the extent needed to preserve the government's ability to conduct\n   lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure\n   law enforcement communications.  Further, the Attorney General\n   shall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture\n   Super Surplus Fund to effect this purchase.\nwhich means "We've got money Congress can't control and we're going to\nbuy lots of wiretapping equipment with it to detect NON-APPROVED CRYPTO\n(that's what "preserve the government's ability to conduct ... surveillance" \nmeans.)
I understand, believe it or not, and there are any number of kinds of \nconversation and communication I engage in that I wouldn't even consider \nusing this scheme for.  On the other hand, I don't see "Clipper" as providing \na secure channel--it just prevents casual eavesdropping.  This is part of why \nI am not worried about it per se.  Trying to look at Clipper as a serious \nsecurity tool is simply ludicrous.  It's a voice scrambler, nothing more.\n\nThere is still plenty of market for real crypto.\n\n\nThey cost an arm and a leg, though. "Clipper" is obviously aimed at the mass \nmarket.  It certainly won't put Cylink out of business.\n\n\nThis is old news.  I can do this now.\n\n\nThere ARE restrictions.  Example: We're a networking software vendor with a \nlarge overseas share of our market.  We cannot currently ship PEM, or even \nsimple DES, in our products without case-by-case approval from the Department \nof State.  ITAR presents a material trade barrier to US firms trying to \ncompete in international information systems markets.\n\nSure, you can use whatever freebie software you want to talk over BBS's in \nthe USA.  I, on the other hand, want strong crypto (PKCS, for example) to be \nthe *default* for electronic mail, worldwide.  I want priests to be able to \nhear confession over email.  I want lawyers to be able to talk to clients in \nconfidence over email, or doctors talk with patients.  I want to be able to \norder products from my favorite Japanese mail-order catalog over the net.  I \nwant to be able to sign contracts, transact business, and so on \nelectronically.\n\nThis is so far infeasible as a result of the current restrictions on \ncrytographic systems, especially beyond the borders of the USA.\n\nClipper is irrelevant, and if it distracts the authorities into feeling safe, \nall the better.  Its only danger is if it emboldens them into trying to put \nmore restrictions into place, on the theory that it is "good enough for \nanyone who has nothing to hide."  That argument is, of course, utter BS, just \nas much as "no one needs an assault rifle".
With regard to your speculations on NSA involvement in the creation of\nPKP, I find that it fails the test of Occam's butcher knife.  Never\nattribute to conspiracy what can be explained by forthright greed.
Here's a simple way to convert the Clipper proposal to an unexceptionable\none: Make it voluntary.\n\nThat is--you get high quality secure NSA classified technology if you agree\nto escrow your key. Otherwise you are on your own.\n\nDavid

This is an addition (posted with permission) to some tech. details of\ncliper. They enligthen ??? the use of S1 and S2 for keygeneration.\n-------------------------------------------\nDate: Mon, 19 Apr 93 08:51:57 EDT\nFrom: denning@cs.cosc.georgetown.edu (Dorothy Denning)\nSubject: Re:  Clipper Chip\n\nI just had another conversation with NSA to clarify some of the features\nof Clipper.  Please feel free to distribute this and my other messages\non Clipper.\n\nThe name of the encryption algorithm is "Skipjack."\n\nMartin Hellman had written\n\n                and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part\n                message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK\n                producing\n\n                     E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}\n\nTo which I responded:\n\n        My understanding is that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK (called the\n        "family key") and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by\n        law enforcement.  Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this?\n\nI was correct in that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK.  However, Skipjack\nbeing a single-key system, there is, of course, not a separate decrypt key\nfor the family key SK.\n\n        The unit key, also called the "chip key," is generated from the\n        serial number N as follows.  Let N1, N2, and N3 be 64 bit blocks\n        derived from N, and let S1 and S2 be two 80-bit seeds used as keys.\n        Compute the 64-bit block\n\n                R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1]\n\n        (Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode with\n        two keys.)  Similarly compute blocks R2 and R3 starting with N2 and N3.\n        (I'm unlear about whether the keys S1 and S2 change.  The fact that\n        they're called seeds suggests they might.)  Then R1, R2, and R3 are\n        concatenated together giving 192 bits.  The first 80 bits  form K1 and\n        the next 80 bits form K2.  The remaining bits are discarded.\n\nThe seeds S1 and S2 do not change.   The whole process is performed on\na laptop computer, and S1 and S2 are supplied by two independent people\nso that no one person knows both.  The same S1 and S2 are used during\nan entire "programming session" to generate keys for a stream of serial\nnumbers.  Everything is discarded at the end (the computer could be\nthrown out if desired).\n\nThe serial number is 30 bits and the values N1, N2, and N3 are formed\nby padding the serial number with fixed 34-bit blocks (separate padding\nfor each value).\n\nThe resulting keys K1 and K2 are output onto separate floppy disks, paired\nup with their serial number.  Each pair is stored in a separate file.  The\nfloppy disks are taken away by two separate people on behalf of the two\nescrow agencies.\n\nDorothy Denning\ndenning@cs.georgetown.edu\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nI am sure more technical detail will be known when time goes by.\nPlease remark, that in posting this, I do not automatically agree\nwith it's contents and implications. So don't swamp my mailbox :-)\n\nI just think this is an valuable addition to the less than technical\ndiscussion that is rising here. And, no, I don't mind if you call\nS1 and S2 'backdoor', as I could imagine the key-generation process\nworking without these seeds and the dependency of K1,K2 from the\nSerial-Number.\n\n\nFriendly greetings,\n\n	Germano Caronni

Okay, let's suppose that the NSA/NIST/Mykotronix Registered\nKey system becomes standard and I'm able to buy such a system\nfrom my local radio shack. Every phone comes with a built in\nchip and the government has the key to every phone call. \nI go and buy a phone and dutifully register the key. \n\nWhat's to prevent me from swapping phones with a friend or \nbuying a used phone at a garage sale? Whooa. The secret registered\nkeys just became unsynchronized. When the government comes \nto listen in, they only receive gobbledly-gook because the \nsecret key registered under my name isn't the right one. \n\nThat leads me to conjecture that:\n\n1) The system isn't that secure. There are just two master keys\nthat work for all the phones in the country. The part about\nregistering your keys is just bogus. \n\nor \n\n2) The system is vulnerable to simple phone swapping attacks\nlike this. Criminals will quickly figure this out and go to\ntown.
Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\n\nA:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\n     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\n     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\n     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\n     decisions related to this initiative.\n\nCongress??  So we're playing politics before we talk to CPSR, academia,\nthe public, internet users?  I`ve heard of top-down design, but top-down \ndemocracy?? [Just whose state/district are the chip manufacturers in?]\n\nQ:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\n     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\n     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\n     powerful encryption devices?\n\nA:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\n     considered during the broad policy review. [...bs about\n     the wonderfulness of the key escrow system...]\n\n     The Administration is not saying, "since encryption\n     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\n     we will prohibit it outright" (as some countries have\n     effectively done); \n\nThey'll just provide an easily-compromised version to JQ Public.\n\n                         nor is the U.S. saying that "every\n     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\n     unbreakable commercial encryption product."  \n\nMaybe we need a CRA -- Cryptographic Rights Amendment.\n\n                                                  There is a\n     false "tension" created in the assessment that this issue is\n     an "either-or" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\n     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\n     balanced approach such as is proposed with the "Clipper\n     Chip" and similar encryption techniques.\n\nNice lullaby.  But why am I not soothed?\n\n----------------\nAlso, \n\n\nWhy repeat themselves?  It appears to some (and the story looks pretty\nconvincing to me, too) that the Justice Department stole a case-tracking\nsystem, modified it, and distributed it to "friendly" police and suchlike\nagencies around the world, eg. the Canadian Mounties.  Of course, I have \nno doubt they swore Scout's Honor that there were no backdoors.\n\nWith that kind of intelligence, who'd want to be swamped with terabytes\nof commercial traffic?
Excuse me?  This has *already* happened.  There's a couple of humps in\nthe tent already.  Ask the folks at Qualcomm what became of the\nnon-trivial encryption scheme they proposed for use in their CDMA\ndigitial cellular phone standard?  There *already* are restrictions in\nplace.
OK, Doug is right, it would be obstruction of justice, blah blah blah,\nBUT, saying "I forgot" is a lie, which is just as bad from a moral point\nof view _IF_ you think "lawfulness" is a good in and of itself (which \nadmittedly most people do not.)  But there's an even better way out of this.\nPROVIDED the government is prosecuting you criminally, you can probably\nplead the fifth amendmeent and thus LEGALLY avoid revealing your key.  The\ngovernment cannot demand information from a criminal defendant which "may\ntend to incriminate" that defendant.  Though this has never been applied\nin the cryptography context (at least as far as I can tell) it seems an\nobvious application to me.  \n\n This may be a common suggestion in this group, but if it's not (I'm new\nhere) I'd love to hear what people have to say about it.  Since I don't\nreally read this group (and since the subject matter is more legal than\ncryptoid) maybe misc.legal.computing would be an appropriate place?\n\n  Steve.
True in theory.  In practice?  The technology of cellular phones will\nprobably be spread spectrum and quite difficult to record the crypttext\nwithout the key.  If the frequency path depends on they key, as I\nunderstand it to, it *could* be made effectively impossible to record.\n\nOnce it hits land you can record it if you have telco access.  The\ntelco isn't supposed to give that without a warrant.  That's the rule\ntoday.\n\nBut even so, the evidence would not be admissible, I think, unless the\njudge so ordered.  I think that even interception of the crypttext\nwithout a warrant would be illegal.   Cops can't record today's plain\ncellular calls and then ask a judge, "Hey, can we have permission to\nlisten to those tapes?" can they?\n\n\nYes, that is a major concern, but I think that they think they can\nwin just by having 99.5% of the USA use this system.  They don't even\nhave to care about the cautious .5% that's left.  They don't catch the\nreally smart crooks anyway.   John Gotti, who would have to be retarded\nnot to realize he was likely to be wiretapped, glibly chatted away\non his tapped phone about murder plans.  That's why he's in jail now.\nHard to believe, but true.\n\n\nThis scheme can succeed without laws forbidding more, which people would\nfight a lot harder.  They like this enough that they are dropping the so\ncalled "Digital Telephony" proposal, according to rumours.  However the\nmeaning of that is complex, since they still want to get at the crypttext\non telco systems, and that requires a bit of work.
One of the candidates that has been suggested for a key registration\nbody is the ACLU.  I think this is poor choice.   The ACLU is\nessentially a group of auditors: they audit how people's civil\nliberties are administered.  Traditionally, auditors do not like to get\ninvolved in the design or operational aspects of things, and with good\nreason.\n\nWhen I was a systems programmer, it always infuriated me that the\nauditors would come in and tell us our implementation stunk from a\nsecurity point of view, but wouldn't tell us how to fix it.  I always\nfigured they just liked to critcize, without doing the work to help fix\nthe problem.\n\nThen I took a stint as an auditor, and I found out the real reason.\nAuditors don't like to recommend solutions, because it puts them in a\nbad position if they have to criticize the implementation later.  The\nauditee can say, "Well, you told us this way would be OK."  It\ncompromises the independence that is a necessary part of the auditor's\njob.\n\nTaking the case at hand, suppose ACLU becomes a key half registrar.\nSuppose that, perhaps through some error on ACLU's part, a key half gets\naway that shouldn't, and is used to deprive someone of her civil\nliberties.  The ACLU gets wind of this, and wants to take it to court.\nBut they end up being at the same time on the side of the defendant\nand of the plaintiff, which is not an easy position to be in.\n\nThere are exceptions to the complete independence of auditors: at one\nplace where I worked, when payroll checks were printed, they were signed\nautomatically by a signature drum on the bursting machine.  This drum\nwas kept by the auditors (who also kept the check stock), and\nwas brought down to Data Processing when it was time to do the checks.\n\nI believe the difference between this situation and the key registration\nsituation is that it is fairly obvious when it is time to do the payroll\nchecks:  if they were done yesterday, and someone wants to do them again\ntoday, he better be able to produce yesterday's checks so that they can\nbe destroyed.  Determining which of the many requests for key halves are\nlegit is a trickier process, one much more prone to mistakes that could\nput the ACLU in a protecting-the-client versus protecting-the-ACLU\nconflict of interest.\n\nAs always, my opinions are my own.
You seem to be assuming that all arrests are of equal value, and that\nthe use of wiretaps is spread uniformly among them.
[Apologies for not posting to alt.clipper, or whatever, but it seems it\nmay not be in the newsfeed here.]\n\nThere may be another reason (good from NSA's point of view, horrible\nfrom everyone else's) why the algorithm/chip design might be secret.\n\nFirst, note that the "experts" will only look at "details", and of just \nthe algorithm:\n\n    In addition, respected experts from outside the\n    government will be offered access to the confidential details of\n    the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\n    their findings.\n\nWhy not the chip design?  Well, here's the possiblity:  in addition to\nencryption, the chip pre-processes voice signals to make them easier\nto analyze/transcribe electronically.  The chip, once widespread, might\neffectively be part of a massively parallel computer for "voice-\ngrepping" the US phone network (or the criminal & wrong-thinking patrons\nthereof).\n\nI wouldn't put it past the NSA.  Think how much easier it would make life\nfor them.\n\nAnd if this is indeed the case, think of the possible public outcry should\nit become widely known.  Thus the secrecy.\n\nIt might be a good idea to have experts in DSP, voice recognition, and\nAI conversation-understanding to be on that panel, and insist they be\ngiven (authenticatable) design specs and implementation documentation.
(a) To use for sensitive but not strategically important traffic,\n(b) if the system was cheap.\n\nFor example, I don't own a cordless phone.  With Clipper, I would.  If the \nlocal men in blue really want to listen to me talk to my friends or order \npizza, I'm no worse off than I am now, and I don't have to worry about\nlocal kids or nosy neighbors.\n\nThat is to say, Clipper "raises the bar" on insecure channels.  It doesn't \nmake them secure, by any means, but a wall, even if the FBI can get a master \nkey by court order, is still better than a "keep off the grass" sign.\n\n\nSo, where can I buy a DES-encrypted cellular phone?  How much does it cost?\nPersonally, Cylink stuff is out of my budget for personal use :)...\n\n\nThe Second and Fourth Amendments do come to mind.
We've got a tempest receiver in the lab here, and there's no difficulty in\npicking up individual monitors. Their engineering tolerances are slack enough\nthat they tend to radiate on different frequencies. Even where they overlap, you\ncan discriminate because they have different line synch frequencies - you can\nlock in on one and average the others out.\n\nThe signals are weird in any case, with varying polarisations and all sorts\nof interactions with the building. Just moving a folded dipole around is also\nhighly effective as a (randomised) means of switching from one monitor to\nanother,
Let me see if I have this straight --- if a person knows S1 and S2,\nand the serial number of the unit, it's easy to reconstruct UK.\nOf course, if they know SK, the "family key", they can easily get the\nserial number of any unit that has made a transmission.  So with S1 and\nS2 being used for a while "batch" of the unit keys, the number of\nused S1/S2 pairs will probably be fairly low.  Of course, you have to\nbelieve that the NSA/FBI/name-your-favorite-government agency will\nknow SK so all it needs is the S1/S2 pairs, and presto, nasty details \nlike court orders for wire taps are no longer necessary.\n\nNow, I'm not one of the people who distrusts the government at every\nturn, but taking someone's word for it that the S1/S2 pairs are not kept\naround is pushing what I'm willing to believe just a little bit too far.
I've been a very intent NREN spectator of the NREN for years.  As a \ncommercial IP software vendor, it really is my professional opinion that the \nNREN, at this point, is irrelevant to private sector networking.  If it had \nbeen deployed five years ago, it would have been a major development.  Now,\nhowever, it's just an upgrade to the NSFnet, and an attempt to revive the \nlagging use of the national supercomputer centers.  You could cut out the \nNSFnet completely, and the Internet would continue chugging along without a \nhiccup (aside from a few universities).\n\nLong-haul networking and Internet connectivity have long since ceased to be \nunder federal sponsorship or regulation, at least in the USA.  The success of \nthe CIX (Commercial Internet Exchange) is a prime example of this.  While our \ndear VP has been promoting his "data superhighway," the private sector has \nbeen building it, without the NSFnet's restrictions.\n\nTo illustrate, a connection from the machine on my desk to the machine your \narticle was posted from (pizzabox.demon.co.uk) involves *only* commercial IP \nproviders until it hits Amsterdam.  No NSFnet.  No NREN.  No "appropriate \nuse" restrictions.  It's even 1.544mbps (T1) until it hits the EUnet \ngateway...\n\nQED.
Where?  I honestly didn't see any...\n\n\nI disagree, if for no other reason than that there are already other \nstandards in place.  Besides, even if they restrict encryption on the NREN, \nwho cares?  Most of the Internet is commercial anyway.  The NREN is only for \ngeovernment and university research (read the proposals--it's a "data \nsuperhighway" for Cray users, not anything having to do with the Internet).
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\n\nIn message <9304190956.AA10390@pizzabox.demon.co.uk> you write:\n\n[...]\n\n\nI'd lost the White House's deathless prose when I posted (that's what happens\nwhen you read news at home when you're rat-arsed), but I did have a bunch\nof follow-ups going on about cellular/cordless comms.  The original article\nhas reappeared, so:\n\n    The President today announced a new initiative that will bring\n    the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary\n    program to improve the security and privacy of telephone\n    communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law\n    enforcement.\n\nHmm, telephone communications could indeed include end-to-end encryption on\nordinary landlines.\n\n    The initiative will involve the creation of new products to\n    accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure\n    telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.\n\nBut the next paragraph says telecoms networks and wireless communications\nlinks.\n\nOK, it's far from clear exactly what Cripple (what an apposite anagram) will\nbe applied to, but the reason Joe Public wants secure comms is to stop\npeople listening in to his cellular or cordless phones (and he wouldn't\neven be bothered about that were it not for Wingnut and Squidqy's\nmisfortunes).\n\nYes, Cripple *might* be for end-to-end encyption, dropping to clear\nwhen the other end doesn't have Cripple.  But then a cordless-to-ordinary\nconversation would be in clear leaving the cordless end just as vulnerable\nas at present.  Nope, I suspect that Cripple will only be used on radio\nlinks.\n\nOK, it's possible `telecommunications networks' could mean `ordinary phone\nlines', but I'm betting it means the microwave links used by the telcos.\n\nMy apologies if I'm wrong, particularly if the turgid Press Release makes it\nclear that I'm wrong and I missed it, but as far as I can see it was full of\nobfuscation, and anyone expecting end-to-end encryption is in for a surprise\n(IMHO).\n\n\nBTW, Graham, I've posted questions to alt.security.pgp and not seen any\nreplies/followups from outside Europe - how about you?

From: brad@clarinet.com (Brad Templeton)\n\n	Let's assume, for the moment, that the system really is secure unless\n	you get both halves of the encryption key from the two independent\n	escrow houses.  Let's say you even trust the escrow houses -- one is\n	the ACLU and the other is the EFF.  (And I'm not entirely joking about\n	those two names)\n\nI'm really not entirely sure I trust EFF any more to be honest.\n\nAnyway, any organisation can be deeply infiltrated.  Look at CND in Britain\na dozen years ago - one of their top members was an SIS spy who stole their\ncomplete address list.  How hard would it be to get one person to sneak in\nand copy the escrow data to disk?
As John Gilmore has pointed out repeatedly, if you produce the\ninfrastructure that would permit a police state to function, all that\nis required to suddenly find yourself living in one is a change of\nattitude on the part of the government.\n\nOur constitution was built by men who had to risk their lives to\nensure freedom in our country. They designed the system to make it\ndifficult for tyranny to arise. For instance, one of the reasons the\nfourth amendment was put there was to make it harder for the\ngovernment to try to make smuggling a crime. Think I jest? John\nHancock made all his money smuggling rum, which is, after all, a drug.\n\nThink about it. The government has everyones keys in escrow, and the\nFBI gets their pet "wiretap without leaving the office" scheme. There\nis a coup, which happens every day all around the world. Within hours,\neveryone in the country who might oppose the tyrants is being\nmonitored more closely than ever before possible.\n\nWithout the tools being in place, a tyranny cannot stand. With tools\nlike this in place, a tyrannical dictatorship could actually be\nsuccessfully imposed.\n\nWhy give the government tools with which to enslave you? Maybe you can\ntrust Bill Clinton, but are you willing to tell me that you can trust\nEVERY government that will ever arise in the U.S. hereafter? I am not\nwilling to make that leap of faith.\n\n\nI'm a political dissident. As such, I am acutely aware of what happens\nto political dissidents in most of the world. In most of the world, I\ncould be killed for my beliefs. Call Amnesty International some time\nto find out what happens to dissidents in most of the world.\n\nAll that seperates the U.S. from most of those places is a thin piece\nof parchment in the National Archives thats being constantly more and\nmore eroded by such farces as the war on drugs. Coups have happened in\ncountries that have had stable democracies for over a hundred years.\nGovernments throughout history have fallen. No government has lasted\nfor more than a few hundred years. Often, they are replaced by\ndictatorships. Do you really believe so intensely that it could never\never ever happen here that you are willing to bet your own life and\nthe lives of your children and other loved ones on it?\n\nIf we construct the tools with which tyranny could be enforced, we\nmake it orders of magnitude more likely that it could happen, because\nif it happened with the tools already in place it could actually\nstick. \n\nNaive fools such as our leadership believe they can protect us where\nhundreds that have gone before have failed. Thriving democracies led\nby men far more skillfull than Bill Clinton have fallen to\ndictatorship. Rome had a thriving republic run by exquisitely skilled\nmen before they became a tyranny.\n\nI, for one, am unwilling to trust that it could never happen here.\nOnly hubris would allow us to believe we are immune to what has\nhappened elsewhere.\n\n--\nPerry Metzger		pmetzger@shearson.com
As one of the happily sleeping people, I would just like to ask this->\naren't people just slightly overreacting to this?  Or are we all of a\nsudden going to draw parallels to Nazi Germany and Communist Russia?\n\nThe point of the matter is that; yes this is a serious problem.  But it is\nnot the end of the world.  Guess what?  We're doing something now you\ncan't do in a Communist country or Nazi Germany.  We're complaining about\nit, (or rather, you're complaining about it) and nobody is shooting at us.  \n\n(Or, rather, if they're shooting at me, they have real bad aim.  (:-) )\n\nGUESS WHAT PEOPLE?  You live in one of the few countries in the world\nwhere a person can complain without getting shot at.  \n\nPeople are always complaining that somebody did this wrong, or somebody\ndid that wrong, or whatever.  Sit down and figure out two things:\n\n1)  What have they done right?\n2)  How much worse can it get?\n\nAnd you'll find that you and I, are pretty damn lucky.\n\nSo let's talk about it, get some action going, decide what's going on. \nBut let's not overreact!
But they can make you piss in a jar, and possibly provide DNA, semen,\nand hair samples or to undergo tests for gunpowder residues on your hand.\n\n(BTW, that was why the chemical engineer arrested in the WTC explosion\nthrust his hands into a toilet filled with urine as the cops were breaking\ndown the door -- the nitrogen in the urine would mask any residue from\nexplosives.  I found it interesting the news reported his acts, but not\nhis reasons).\n\nSomewhere, perhaps a privacy group, they discussed the legal ramifications\nof using a password like\n\n  I shot Jimmy Hoffa and his body is in a storage locker in Camden\n\na while back.  The impression I got was that real judges would dismiss\narguments that this password is self-incrimination as first-year law\nschool sophistry -- the fact that you use a statement for a password has\nno bearing on the veracity of that phrase.\n\nYou are not being asked to incrimidate yourself (e.g., "where did you\nbury the body?"); you are being asked to provide information necessary\nto execute a legal search warrant.  Refusing to provide the password is\nakin to refusing to provide a key to a storage locker... except that they\ncould always _force_ their way into the locker.\n\nOf course, that doesn't mean you have to help them _understand_ what\nthey find, or point out things they overlooked in their search!
What they would need to do, though, is make sure that nobody has\naccess to decent crypto in the first place.  They probably can't\ntell Clippered voice from Clippered triple-DESed voice until they\nget their copy of your key.  Any criminal who's going to use\nencryption will do it under cover of Clipper.  The only way to avoid\nthis will be to try to prohibit strong encryption.\n\nI probably shouldn't say this, but they could try to detect the use\nof an illegal cypher by transmitting in the clear some statistical\nproperties of the plaintext.  An old-fashioned wiretap could then\ndetect the use of pre-encryption, which would drastically increase\nthe measured entropy of the input.  A countermeasure to this would\nbe to use steganographic techniques which put out voice.\n\nYou can tell if the NSA built this feature in: blow on the mike, and\nobserve whether a band of thugs comes through your ceiling.
If the Administration is this far along, is it possible that the\ngovernment been working on it for a while and has been using the\nDennings to prime the pump, so to speak, or as the Judas goat?\nWhether paid off, just gullible, or what, doesn't really matter.\n\nIt might also be possible that the NSA / whoever has had the idea for\nthis for quite a while, has been promoting it (Denning, et al) and\nsiezed the new opportunity - a new administration who wants to spend\nmore money on espionage than Bush did.\n\nWhatever, i'm not so sure that the cause/effect order is totally\nobvious.
Actually, I've been following her remarks for some time, with\ninterest. I'm also a member of academia, and her remarks have nothing\nbut elevate her respectability in my eyes. It remains to be seen whether\nyou are the radical fringe, or I.\n\n	It is generally an error to assume that your beliefs are held by\nthe majority, or even a sizable minority. Especially when you're seeing\ntens, nay dozens, of people on usenet agreeing with you.

Rather than use technology to accommodate\nthe sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\nlaw enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\nindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\n\nSophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\nprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\nprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\ntechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\nunauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\nby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\n\nA state-of-the-art microcircuit called the "Clipper Chip" has\nbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\nnew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\nrelatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\nan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\nusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\ncommercial use today.\n\nThis new technology will help companies protect proprietary\ninformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\nand prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\nelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\nability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\nintercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \n\nA "key-escrow" system will be established to ensure that the\n"Clipper Chip" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\nAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique\n\n\n                                2\n\n\n"keys," numbers that will be needed by authorized government\nagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\ndevice is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\nin two "key-escrow" data bases that will be established by the\nAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\ngovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct a\nwiretap.\n\nThe "Clipper Chip" technology provides law enforcement with no\nnew authorities to access the content of the private\nconversations of Americans.\n\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\nAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\ndevices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\ngovernment will be offered access to the confidential details of\nthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\ntheir findings.\n\nThe chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\nencryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\nprivacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\ncriminals and terrorists.  We need the "Clipper Chip" and other\napproaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\nto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\nto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\ntrends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\nthe President has directed government agencies to develop a\ncomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\n\n     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\n          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\n\n     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\n          calls and data, under proper court or other legal\n          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\n\n     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern\n          technology to build the National Information\n          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\n          the competitiveness of American industry in the global\n          marketplace; and \n\n     --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\n          high technology products.\n\nThe President has directed early and frequent consultations with\naffected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\nprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\n\n\n\n                                3\n\nThe Administration is committed to working with the private\nsector to spur the development of a National Information\nInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\ntechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\ninformation.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\n("information superhighways") will transmit video, images, HDTV\nprogramming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone\nsystem transmits voice.\n\nSince encryption technology will play an increasingly important\nrole in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\nquickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\nits use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\nprotect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting\nthem from those who break the law.\n\nFurther information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \nThe provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new\nencryption technology are also available.  \n\nFor additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\nStandards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\n\n---------------------------------\n\n\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S\nTELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\n\n\n\n\nQ:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\n     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?\n\nA:   No.  "Clipper Chip" technology provides law enforcement with\n     no new authorities to access the content of the private\n     conversations of Americans.\n\nQ:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\n     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\n     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\n     decipher the message?\n\nA:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\n     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\n     would then present documentation of this authorization to\n     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\n     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\n     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\n     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\n     escrow system.\n\nQ:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\n\nA:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\n     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\n     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will\n     oversee the key-escrow data banks.\n\nQ:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\n     how strong the security is?  \n\nA:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\n     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\n     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\n     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of\n     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\n     potential users that there are no unrecognized\n     vulnerabilities.\n\nQ:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\n\nA:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\n     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\n     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\n     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\n     officials.\n\nQ:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\n\nA:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\n     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\n     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\n     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\n     decisions related to this initiative.\n\nQ:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\n\nA:   The government designed and developed the key access\n     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\n     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\n     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\n     manufacturer that produces them.\n\nQ:   Who provides the "Clipper Chip"?\n\nA:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\n     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device\n     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\n     to other vendors in the future.\n\nQ:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \n\nA:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\n     the "Clipper Chip" into their devices.\n     \nQ:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\n     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\n     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\n     powerful encryption devices?\n\nA:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\n     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\n     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\n     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\n     than others readily available today, but it is just one\n     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\n     encryption technology, which the Administration is\n     developing.\n\n     The Administration is not saying, "since encryption\n     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\n     we will prohibit it outright" (as some countries have\n     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that "every\n     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\n     unbreakable commercial encryption product."  There is a\n     false "tension" created in the assessment that this issue is\n     an "either-or" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\n     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\n     balanced approach such as is proposed with the "Clipper\n     Chip" and similar encryption techniques.\n\nQ:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\n     Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from\n     that of the Bush Administration?  \n\nA:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\n     technology in telecommunications and computing and are\n     committed to working with industry and public-interest\n     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'\n     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\n     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\n     and terrorism.\n\nQ:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\n     the government hardware?
But that's just the problem. There is no such thing as\n        "MIME-Formatted". By analogy, MIME is a content-labelling\n        standard for the box, not a specification for the contents\n        themselves. It provides a standard for "like-minded"\n        individuals to exchange mail containing an agreed-upon data\n        format.\n\n        You say tomahto, I say tomaeto; you say postscript, I say\n        SGML...\n        \n        Cheers,\n                Marc\n\n---\n Marc Thibault        | CIS:71441,2226     |  Put another log\n marc@tanda.isis.org  | NC FreeNet: aa185  |  on the fire.\n\n-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\nVersion: 2.0
OK, I should have read the thread before posting my own $0.02.  I would\njust add to Phil's very infomative discussion the following caveat: the\nfifth amendment applies ONLY in crinial cases.  ("...nor shall any person .\n. . be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself...").\nThus if the father sued for custody of the children, the case would be\ncivil and the defendant mother would not have fifth amendment protection.\nOddly enough, her refusal to give information in a civil case can lead to\ncriminal contempt charges (thus landing her in jail.)  The interesting part\nof all this is that in a murder trial, the woman CAN plead the fifth as \nto the location of the child--this is routine.  A "computer crime" \nprosecution thus would seem to be fertile ground for this kind of defense, \nwhere a suit by a party injured by "hackers" would not.  If I am accused, \nfor example, of sending encrypted kiddie porn over the nets the fifth should \nprotect my key.  If I am accused of sending copyrighted material, however,\nit proabably will not (copyright infringement not being a "crime" in the\ntechnical sense.)  The REALLY tricky question is, say I do both (naughty\nboy that I am) can the government use the information gained in the civil\ntrial (ie. my key) to gain access to my files for use in the criminal\nprosecution.  The answer should certainly be no, but lord only knows how\nthis would work out.\n\nSteve.
Us having the liberties to talk about this doesn't make the problem go\naway.  It doesn't make it right.  Rather the opposite, if we do not do \nanything about it, you can bet it's going to get worse.

The Clipper Chip will have no effect.  Current generation PCs, portable\nand desktop, all have analog voice -> digital voice and vice versa\ncapabilities.  So, I only need a modem output to the telephone,\nand I can interpose any encryption screen on my voice traffic I want.\n\nNot even a big deal, but it will pass muster if the have a way\nof checking whether I am using their Clipper Chip encryption without\na full decoding.\n\nI have been chided for stating that Dorthy Denning was intellectually\ndishonest in the ACM debate and in this newsgroup.  I have previously\nrefrained from suggesting that she is arguing on behalf of consulting\nclients.\n\nNow, I say that it is clear that Dorthy Denning has been functioning\nas a lobbyist, not a computer scientist.  She has used legal ethics\n(truth is what you can convince anyone of), not scientific ethics\n(truth is understanding the external world).\n\nMaybe we can revoke her ACM membership? 8)\n\nLew
About 18 months ago, I heard a report on NPR about a 900-number\n"1-900-STO-PPER" or some such, for placing untraceable calls.\nYou call them, and on "bong" tone dial the number you want to\ncall; they told the NPR interviewer that nothing short of a\ncourt order (which they'd fight) would make them release their\nrecords.                                                                   \n                                            \n\nMatt Healy\n"I pretend to be a network administrator;\n the lab net pretends to work"
<\n<> Here's a simple way to convert the Clipper proposal to an unexceptionable\n<> one: Make it voluntary.\n<\n<As usually, you are not reading. The proposal -does- say that it is a\n<"voluntary program". This doesn't make it more desirable, though...\n<\n<> That is--you get high quality secure NSA classified technology if you agree\n<> to escrow your key. Otherwise you are on your own.\n<\n<"Secure"?

I am sure you didn't miss the implication that we could have another\nRichard Nixon type president in the future (perhaps not too distant\nfuture, acutally).  With that in mind, then I take it you also would\nnot object to the Gov coming up with a decision (not proposal - just\nlike Clinton Cripple is a decision, not a proposal) sprung on us to\nstart placing video cameras with sound in every room of your house,\nwhich could be activated without your knowlege.  They would be well\nconcealed so you wouldn't know the location, to prevent you from covering\nthe lens opening.  After all, nothing you're doing would be of the\nslightest interest to a government official, right?  So, you surely\nshould not object to such a proposal...\n\nNot the best anology, but the principle is pretty close - the ability\nto eavesdrop on your activity with little or no effort, without your\nknowlege, protected by entirely by "government safeguards".  You can\nstill draw your curtains, so you can still have your privacy from everyone\nelse (except Big Brother)!!  After all we need this for protection from\ndrug dealers and terrorists and other criminals (like 'enemies of the\nSTATE')... and you don't really have a right to "unbreakable" privacy\nanyway, sort of as the press release of the Clinton Cripple DECISION\nputs it...\n\nI find it curious they use the word "unbreakable" when the term really\nshould be "difficult to break without proper authorization" (which the\nGovernment most certainly has at their disposal, right?  They wouldn't\nwant to be able to break it ILLEGALLY, would they?)...  Nawww, not\n"for the People" Clinton....\n\nCan you, while my mind is on it, give us one good reason that the\nalgorithm should be a secret algorithm, unless this encryption scheme\neither is a joke, or contains features like a 'master key' or other back\ndoor for UNAUTHORIZED eavesdropping? If it was really even moderately\nsecure, and the government really meant to require the proper court\norder and the keys that are in the Escrow accounts to be able to decipher\nthe traffic, what is the need to keep the algorithm secret?  Seems I\nhear rather often that if an encryption scheme requires the algorithm\nto remain a secret to be effective, it is not a worthwhile scheme... is\nthis just idle talk, or is the Administration bullshitting everyone?\n\nWith GREAT skepticism, and many doubts on our Administrations intentions...\n\nAnd WAIT!! We haven't been told the NEXT gem the Administration has in\nmind for e-mail and datafile security.  The press release does say that\nthis is part of a comprehensive thing on data security for us unprivileged\ncitizens.  Perhaps 'subjects' would be the better term - 'citizens'\nsomehow does not seem appropriate... that implies a free people, 'subjects'\nbetter fits a population who serve at the pleasure of their rulers.\nOne thing for certain:  The government no longer regards the citizens\nas their bosses anymore, but the other way around...
Archive-name: cryptography-faq/part04\nLast-modified: 1993/4/15\n\n\nFAQ for sci.crypt, part 4: Mathematical Cryptology\n\nThis is the fourth of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ. The parts are\nmostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.\nWe don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.\nNotes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.\n\nThe sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu \nas /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography \nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers\nevery 21 days.\n\n\nContents:\n\n* In mathematical terms, what is a private-key cryptosystem?\n* What is an attack?\n* What's the advantage of formulating all this mathematically?\n* Why is the one-time pad secure?\n* What's a ciphertext-only attack?\n* What's a known-plaintext attack?\n* What's a chosen-plaintext attack?\n* In mathematical terms, what can you say about brute-force attacks?\n* What's a key-guessing attack? What's entropy?\n\n\n* In mathematical terms, what is a private-key cryptosystem?\n\n  A private-key cryptosystem consists of an encryption system E and a\n  decryption system D. The encryption system E is a collection of\n  functions E_K, indexed by ``keys'' K, mapping some set of\n  ``plaintexts'' P to some set of ``ciphertexts'' C. Similarly the\n  decryption system D is a collection of functions D_K such that\n  D_K(E_K(P)) = P for every plaintext P.  That is, succesful decryption\n  of ciphertext into plaintext is accomplished using the same key\n  (index) as was used for the corresponding encryption of plaintext\n  into ciphertext.  Such systems, wherein the same key value is used to\n  encrypt and decrypt, are also known as ``symmetric'' cryptoystems.\n\n* What is an attack?\n\n  In intuitive terms a (passive) attack on a cryptosystem is any method\n  of starting with some information about plaintexts and their\n  corresponding ciphertexts under some (unknown) key, and figuring out\n  more information about the plaintexts. It's possible to state\n  mathematically what this means. Here we go.\n\n  Fix functions F, G, and H of n variables. Fix an encryption system E,\n  and fix a distribution of plaintexts and keys.\n\n  An attack on E using G assuming F giving H with probability p is an\n  algorithm A with a pair f, g of inputs and one output h, such that\n  there is probability p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n), if we have\n  f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and g = G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)). Note that this\n  probability depends on the distribution of the vector (K,P_1,...,P_n).\n\n  The attack is trivial (or ``pointless'') if there is probability at\n  least p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n) if f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and\n  g = G(C_1,...,C_n). Here C_1,...,C_n range uniformly over the possible\n  ciphertexts, and have no particular relation to P_1,...,P_n. In other\n  words, an attack is trivial if it doesn't actually use the encryptions\n  E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n).\n\n  An attack is called ``one-ciphertext'' if n = 1, ``two-ciphertext'' if\n  n = 2, and so on.\n\n* What's the advantage of formulating all this mathematically?\n\n  In basic cryptology you can never prove that a cryptosystem is secure.\n  Read part 3: we keep saying ``a strong cryptosystem must have this\n  property, but having this property is no guarantee that a cryptosystem\n  is strong!''\n\n  In contrast, the purpose of mathematical cryptology is to precisely\n  formulate and, if possible, prove the statement that a cryptosystem is\n  strong. We say, for example, that a cryptosystem is secure against\n  all (passive) attacks if any nontrivial attack against the system (as\n  defined above) is too slow to be practical. If we can prove this\n  statement then we have confidence that our cryptosystem will resist\n  any (passive) cryptanalytic technique. If we can reduce this statement\n  to some well-known unsolved problem then we still have confidence that\n  the cryptosystem isn't easy to break.\n\n  Other parts of cryptology are also amenable to mathematical\n  definition. Again the point is to explicitly identify what assumptions\n  we're making and prove that they produce the desired results. We can\n  figure out what it means for a particular cryptosystem to be used\n  properly: it just means that the assumptions are valid.\n\n  The same methodology is useful for cryptanalysis too. The cryptanalyst\n  can take advantage of incorrect assumptions. Often he can try to\n  construct a proof of security for a system, see where the proof fails,\n  and use these failures as the starting points for his analysis.\n  \n* Why is the one-time pad secure?\n\n  By definition, the one-time pad is a cryptosystem where the\n  plaintexts, ciphertexts, and keys are all strings (say byte strings)\n  of some length m, and E_K(P) is just the sum (let's say the exclusive\n  or) of K and P.\n\n  It is easy to prove mathematically that there are _no_ nontrivial\n  single-ciphertext attacks on the one-time pad, assuming a uniform\n  distribution of keys. Note that we don't have to assume a uniform\n  distribution of plaintexts. (Here's the proof: Let A be an attack,\n  i.e., an algorithm taking two inputs f, g and producing one output h,\n  with some probability p that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and\n  g = G(E_K(P)) (i.e., g = G(K + P)). Then, because the distribution of\n  K is uniform and independent of P, the distribution of K + P must also\n  be uniform and independent of P. But also the distribution of C is\n  uniform and independent of P. Hence there is probability exactly p\n  that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and g = G(C), over all P and C. Thus\n  a fortiori A is trivial.)\n\n  On the other hand the one-time pad is _not_ secure if a key K is used\n  for more than one plaintext: i.e., there are nontrivial\n  multiple-ciphertext attacks. So to be properly used a key K must be\n  thrown away after one encryption. The key is also called a ``pad'';\n  this explains the name ``one-time pad.''\n\n* What's a ciphertext-only attack?\n\n  In the notation above, a ciphertext-only attack is one where F is\n  constant. Given only some information G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)) about\n  n ciphertexts, the attack has to have some chance of producing some\n  information H(P_1,...,P_n) about the plaintexts. The attack is trivial\n  if it has just as good a chance of producing H(P_1,...,P_n) when given\n  G(C_1,...,C_n) for random C_1,...,C_n.\n\n  For example, say G(C) = C, and say H(P) is the first bit of P. We can\n  easily write down an attack---the ``guessing attack,'' which simply\n  guesses that H(P) is 1. This attack is trivial because it doesn't use\n  the ciphertext: it has a fifty-fifty chance of guessing correctly no\n  matter what. On the other hand there is an attack on RSA which\n  produces one bit of information about P, with 100% success, using C.\n  If it is fed a random C then the success rate drops to 50%. So this is\n  a nontrivial attack.\n\n* What's a known-plaintext attack?\n\n  The classic known-plaintext attack has F(P_1,P_2) = P_1,\n  G(C_1,C_2) = (C_1,C_2), and H(P_1,P_2) depending only on P_2.\n  In other words, given two ciphertexts C_1 and C_2 and one decryption\n  P_1, the known-plaintext attack should produce information about the\n  other decryption P_2.\n\n  Note that known-plaintext attacks are often defined in the literature\n  as producing information about the key, but this is pointless: the\n  cryptanalyst generally cares about the key only insofar as it lets him\n  decrypt further messages.\n\n* What's a chosen-plaintext attack?\n\n  A chosen-plaintext attack is the first of an increasingly impractical\n  series of _active_ attacks on a cryptosystem: attacks where the\n  cryptanalyst feeds data to the encryptor. These attacks don't fit into\n  our model of passive attacks explained above. Anyway, a\n  chosen-plaintext attack lets the cryptanalyst choose a plaintext and\n  look at the corresponding ciphertext, then repeat until he has figured\n  out how to decrypt any message. More absurd examples of this sort of\n  attack are the ``chosen-key attack'' and ``chosen-system attack.''\n\n  A much more important form of active attack is a message corruption\n  attack, where the attacker tries to change the ciphertext in such a\n  way as to make a useful change in the plaintext.\n\n  There are many easy ways to throw kinks into all of these attacks:\n  for instance, automatically encrypting any plaintext P as\n  T,E_K(h(T+R+P),R,P), where T is a time-key (sequence number) chosen anew\n  for each message, R is a random number, and h is a one-way hash\n  function. Here comma means concatenation and plus means exclusive-or.\n\n* In mathematical terms, what can you say about brute-force attacks?\n\n  Consider the following known-plaintext attack. We are given some\n  plaintexts P_1,...,P_{n-1} and ciphertexts C_1,...,C_{n-1}. We're\n  also given a ciphertext C_n. We run through every key K. When we find\n  K such that E_K(P_i) = C_i for every i < n, we print D_K(C_n).\n\n  If n is big enough that only one key works, this attack will succeed\n  on valid inputs all the time, while it will produce correct results\n  only once in a blue moon for random inputs. Thus this is a nontrivial\n  attack. Its only problem is that it is very slow if there are many\n  possible keys.\n\n* What's a key-guessing attack? What's entropy?\n\n  Say somebody is using the one-time pad---but isn't choosing keys\n  randomly and uniformly from all m-bit messages, as he was supposed to\n  for our security proof. In fact say he's known to prefer keys which\n  are English words. Then a cryptanalyst can run through all English\n  words as possible keys. This attack will often succeed, and it's much\n  faster than a brute-force search of the entire keyspace.
A nice formulation for the introduction of the first encryption\ndevices with built-in trapdoors - just like the Feds wanted...\n\n\nBla-bla.\n\n\nIndeed, and the current proposal does nothing to prevent the latter.\n\n\nThis doesn't say much. There are many incredibly weak encryption\nalgorithms in commercial use today...\n\n\nExcept from the government.\n\n\nNope. The criminals won't be stupid enough to use the new chip,\nthey'll use something secure. This technology provides only means to\nintercept the phone conversations of people who are stupid enough to\nuse it.\n\n\nThat is, the government has the keys. It doesn't matter much if they\nare in one or in two of its hands...\n\n\nCorrect. It does, however, provide those Americans with the false\nsense of privacy.\n\n\nIf the screening is not public, it cannot be trusted. Some people do\nnot trust DES even today, after all the examinations - only because\nsome parts of its design were kept secret.\n\n\nSo they'll use a different technology to hide their illegal\nactivities. So will those law-abiding citizens, who do not trust their\ngovernment not to misuse its abilities to decrypt their conversations.\n\n\nExcept from the government.\n\n\nHuh? Later it says that the new technology will be export restricted.\n\n\nIn short, the new technology can:\n\n1) Protect the law abiding citizen's privacy from the casual snooper.\n\nIt cannot:\n\n1) Protect him from the government, if it decides to misuse its\nability to decrypt the conversations.\n\n2) Protect him from the criminals who succeed to break the new\nencryption scheme or to steal the keys, or to bribe the people who\nhandle them, etc.\n\n3) Prevent the criminals from using secure encryption for\ncommunication.\n\n\n\nCorrect. However, it does not provide them that much privacy as it\nclaims.\n\n\n\nTwo candidates: the NSA and the Mafia.\n\n\n\nThat is, "trust us".\n\n\n"Security through obscurity".\n\n\nIf it's not entirely open to public examination, it cannot be\ntrusted. Besides, who can prove that the devices used for examination\nand the ones built into your phones will be the same?\n\n\n\nThe NSA and the FBI?\n\n\n\nWhy did they "forget" the Academia?\n\n\n\nDoesn't this smell to monopolism?\n\n\n\nLike the Mafia?\n\n\nThis is the main question, why was it buried at the end?\n\n\n"We'll see".\n\n\n"Trust us".\n\n\nIn short, "If we decide to outlaw strong crypto, we'll tell you".\n\n\nSince the US government seems to consider strong crypto as munitions\nand since the US constitutions guarantees the right to every American\nto bear arms, why is not every American entitled, as a matter of\nright, to an unbreakable commercial encryption product?\n\n\nBullshit. The proposed technology provides a false sense of security,\nencryption devices with built-in capabilities for breaking the\nencryption, does not prevent the criminals to use strong crypto, and\nis a step to outlaw strong crypto.\n\n\n\nWho was the optimist who believed that the new administration will\nleave the export controls on strong crypto devices?\n\nOK, I'm not American, it's not my business, but I just couldn't resist\nto comment... The whole plot looks so totalitaristic... It's up to\nyou, Americans, to fight for your rights.\n\nRegards,\nVesselin\n\nP.S. Now is the time for David Sternlight to pop up and claim that the\nnew system is great.
Here are some corrections and additions to Hellman's note, courtesy of\nDorothy Denning.  Again, this is reposted with permission.\n\nTwo requests -- first, note the roles of S1 and S2.  It appears to me\nand others that anyone who knows those values can construct the unit\nkey.  And the nature of the generation process for K1 and K2 is such\nthat neither can be produced alone.  Thus, the scheme cannot be\nimplemented such that one repository generates the first half-key, and\nanother generates the second.  *That* is ominous.\n\nSecond -- these postings are not revealed scripture, nor are they\ncarefully-crafted spook postings.  Don't attempt to draw out hidden\nmeanings (as opposed to, say, the official announcements of Clipper).\nLeave Denning out of this; given Hellman's record of opposition to DES,\nwhich goes back before some folks on this newsgroup knew how to read, I\ndon't think you can impugn his integrity.\n\nOh yeah -- the folks who invented Clipper aren't stupid.  If you think\nsomething doesn't make sense, it's almost certainly because you don't\nunderstand their goals.\n\n		--Steve Bellovin\n\n-----\n\nDate: Sun, 18 Apr 93 07:56:39 EDT\nFrom: denning@cs.georgetown.edu (Dorothy Denning)\nSubject: Re:  Clipper Chip\nTo: (a long list of folks)\n\nI was also briefed by the NSA and FBI, so let me add a few comments to\nMarty's message:\n\n        The Clipper Chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in \n\nThe algorithm operates on 64-bit blocks (like DES) and the chip supports\nall 4 DES modes of operation.

I\nwill also check it out, but this is 7am Sunday so I did not want to wait.\n\n        The unit key \n	will be generated as the XOR of two 80-bit random numbers K1 \n	and K2 (UK=K1+K2) which will be kept by the two escrow \n\nThe unit key, also called the "chip key," is generated from the\nserial number N as follows.

In addition to Marty's\ncriteria, I would add that the agencies must have an established record\nof being able to safeguard highly sensitive information.  Some suggestions\nI've received so far include SRI, Rand, Mitre, the national labs (Sandia,\nLANL, Los Alamos), Treasury, GAO.\n\n	When a court order obtains K1 and K2, and thence K, the law \n	enforcement agency will use SK to decrypt all information \n	flowing on the suspected link [Aside: It is my guess that \n	they may do this constantly on all links, with or without a \n	court order, since it is almost impossible to tell which links \n	over which a message will flow.] \n\nMy understanding is that there will be only one decode box and that it\nwill be operated by the FBI.

After completing a mound\nof paperwork, an agent must get the approval of several people on a chain\nthat includes FBI legal counsel before the request is even taken to the\nAttorney General for final approval.

The only way to view this method of generating unit keys is as a back-door.\nWhat else can you call a key deterministically generated from the serial\nnumber?\n\n\n To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is\n   first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.\n   S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a\n   64-bit block R1:\n\n	   R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .\n\n   Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and\n   N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:  \n\n	   R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] \n	   R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .\n\n   R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The\n   first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The\n   rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2\n   are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow\n   agencies.

And yes,\nthe presence of the Clipper Chip DOES change things, because it will\nnot only give the people talking on the phone a false sense of security,\nit will also give federal law enforcement agencies the justification\nto deny use of strong encryption methods that are inconvenient to them.\nDang it all, it's SUPPOSED to be inconvenient (but not impossible).\nThat's the ONLY sure way to make sure that abuses are minimized while\nstill allowing legitimate law enforcement access.\n\n\n\nUh huh... sure.  I predict that within two months (weeks?) of the chip's\ndebut, the full technical details will be posted to sci.crypt.  And if\nthis has ANY impact on the security of the key escrow system, then we've\nbeen lied to.  Any cryptosystem worth its salt can withstand the light\nof public scrutiny, and there is NO WAY you can be sure that an\nalgorithm has no "unrecognized vulnerabilities" unless you have half\nthe world trying to break it for a decade or so.

First of all, the chip doesn't do that.  It runs at 16 megabits/second,\nwhich is far beyond what you need for voice.  It's obviously intended\nfor data as well, and on high-speed lines at that.\n\nSecond -- what advantage is there to doing the processing in the phone?\nI don't care how fancy that chip is; it's not as fancy as the roomful\nof analyzers at Fort Meade running the program they'll have 5 years from\nnow.  They can't update every Clipper chip that's out there.
I am an idiot. The plaintext that's relevant is the session key.\nIf you know that, you probably don't need a roomful of chips, do you?\nIf you were going to brute force something interesting, that'd be the\nmessage stream, which is sort of approximately known by, say, a bug in\nmy office. Then your roomful of chips could get the session key. Which\nI change every morning.\n\n	Really, it's just a whole lot easier for the illicit wiretappers\nto stick a bug in your phone.

A system utilizing codes sent between users and banks\n  (similar to today's checking system except entirely digital) may\n  be one approach.  The issues of cryptography, privacy, and\n  anonymity are closely associated with transfer of cash in an\n  economy.  See the article in Scientific American by David Chaum\n  (~Dec.1992).\n\n  An experimental digital bank is run by Karl Barrus\n  <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU> based on suggestions by Hal Finney on the\n  cypherpunks mailing list.  To use the server send mail to\n  elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu message with the following text:\n\n    ::\n    command: help\n    \n    user@host\n\n  where `user@host' is your email address.\n \n  \n_____\n<5.2> What is a ``hacker'' or ``cracker''?\n\n  These terms arouse strong feelings by many on their meaning,\n  especially on the internet.  In the general news media in the past\n  a person who uses computers and networks to malicious ends (such as\n  breaking into systems) has been referred to as a hacker, but most\n  internet users prefer the term ``cracker'' for this.  Instead, a\n  ``hacker'' is perceived as a benign but intensely ambitious,\n  curious, and driven computer user who explores obscure areas of a\n  system, for example---something of a proud electronic pioneer and\n  patriot.  This is the sense intended in this document.  See also\n  the ``Hacker's Dictionary'' and the FAQ `alt-security-faq'.\n \n \n_____\n<5.3> What is a ``cypherpunk''?\n\n  From the charter of the cypherpunk mailing list:\n\n  > Cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there were\n  > more of it.  Cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy\n  > must create it for themselves and not expect governments,\n  > corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant\n  > them privacy out of beneficence.  Cypherpunks know that people\n  > have been creating their own privacy for centuries with whispers,\n  > envelopes, closed doors, and couriers.  Cypherpunks do not seek\n  > to prevent other people from speaking about their experiences or\n  > their opinions.\n\n  See information on the cypherpunk mailing list below.\n\n  See also the CryptoAnarchist Manifesto and the Cryptography Glossary\n  in soda.berkeley.edu:/pub/cypherpunks.\n\n_____\n<5.4> What is `steganography' and anonymous pools?\n\n  Closely associated with encryption is `steganography' or the\n  techniques for not only pursuing private (encrypted) communication\n  but concealing the very  existence of the communication itself. \n  Many new possibilities in this area are introduced with the\n  proliferation of computer technology.  For example, it is possible\n  to encode messages in the least-significant bits of images,\n  typically the most 'noisy'. In addition, when such an item is\n  posted in a public place (such as a newsgroup), virtually\n  untraceable  communication can take place between sender and\n  receiver.  For  steganographic communications in the electronic\n  realm one another possibility is setting up a mailing list where\n  individual messages get broadcast to the entire list and individual\n  users decode particular messages with their unique key.   An\n  anonymous pool has been set up by Miron Cuperman\n  (miron@extropia.wimsey.com) for experiments.  Send email to\n  <pool0-request@extropia.wimsey.com>  with one of the following\n  commands in the subject line:\n\n    subscribe\n    unsubscribe\n    help\n\n_____\n<5.5> What is `security through obscurity'?\n\n  `Security through obscurity' refers to the attempt to gain\n  protection from system weaknesses by hiding sensitive information\n  or programs relating to them.  For example, a company may not make\n  public information on its software's encryption techniques to evade\n  `attacks' based on knowledge of it. Another example would be\n  concealing data on the existence of security holes or bugs in\n  operating systems.  Or, some reliance may be made on the fact that\n  some standard or mechanism with potential problems is serious\n  because they are ``not widely known'' or ``not widely used.'' This\n  argument is occasionally applied to mechanisms for email and Usenet\n  posting `forgery'. `Security through obscurity' is regarded as a\n  very feeble  technique at best and inappropriate and ineffective at\n  worst (also called the ``head-in-the-sand approach''). See the FAQ\n  for alt.security.  \n  \n  Some remarks of John Perry Barlow, cofounder of the Electronic\n  Frontier Foundation, directed to NSA agents at the First\n  International Symposium on National Security & National\n  Competitiveness held in McLean, Virginia  Dec. 1, 1992:\n\n  > Digitized information is very hard to stamp classified or keep\n  > contained. ... This stuff is incredibly leaky and volatile.  It's\n  > almost a life form in its ability to self-propagate.  If\n  > something hits the Net and it's something which people on there\n  > find interesting it will spread like a virus of the mind.  I\n  > believe you must simply accept the idea that we are moving into\n  > an environment where any information which is at all interesting\n  > to people is going to get out.  And there will be very little\n  > that you can do about it.  This is not a bad thing in my view,\n  > but you may differ...\n\n_____\n<5.6> What are `identity daemons'?\n  \n  RFC-931 describes a protocol standard that allows UNIX programs to\n  query a remote user's login name after connection to a local\n  communication socket (a connection of this type is established\n  during FTP and TELNET sessions, for example).  The standard is not\n  widely supported, perhaps 10% of internet sites currently implement\n  it but the number is increasing.  The mechanism is detrimental to\n  anonymity.  Regular users cannot disable it but system\n  adminstrators can circumvent it.  This standard may represent a\n  trend toward greater authentication mechanisms.\n\n_____\n<5.7> What new standards are needed to guard electronic privacy?\n\n\n  Remailing/Posting\n  -----------------\n  \n  - Stable, secure, protected, officially sanctioned and permitted,\n    publicly and privately operated anonymous servers and hubs.\n  - Official standards for encryption and anonymity in mail and USENET\n    postings.\n  - Truly anonymous protocols with source and destination information\n    obscured or absent and hidden routing mechanisms (chaining,\n    encrypted addresses, etc.)\n  - Standards for anonymous email addressing, embedding files, and\n    remailer site chaining.\n  \n  General\n  -------\n  \n  - Recognition of anonymity, cryptography, and related privacy\n    shields as legitimate, useful, desirable, and crucial by the\n    general public and their governments.\n  - Widespread use and implementation of these technologies \n    by systems designers into\n    hardware, software, and standards, implemented `securely,'\n    `seamlessly,' and `transparently'.\n  - General shift of use, dependence, and reliance to means other than\n    wiretapping and electronic surveillance by law enforcement\n    agencies.\n  - Publicity, retraction, and dissolution of laws and government\n    agencies opposed to privacy, replaced by structures dedicated to\n    strengthening and protecting it.\n\n\nISSUES\n======\n\n_____\n<6.1> What is the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)?\n\n  From ftp.eff.org:/pub/EFF/mission_statement:\n\n  > A new world is arising in the vast web of digital, electronic\n  > media which connect us.

The group has three offices (Palo Alto, Cambridge,\n  Washington, DC) and 20 chapters. It is involved in  litigation\n  against the FBI, The NSA, NIST, the Secret Service and other other\n  U.S. government agencies  to declassify and provide documentation\n  on issues such as Operation Sundevil, the FBI wiretap proposal,\n  NSA's interference in crypography, the breakup of the 2600 raid in\n  Arlington, Va in Nov 1992. Members speak frequently in front on\n  Congress, state legislators and public utility commissions to\n  testify on privacy, information policy, computer security, and\n  caller identification.\n\n  CPSR has created an extensive Internet Privacy library available\n  via FTP, Gopher, WAIS, and email at cpsr.org, currently comprising\n  the largest collection of privacy documents on the internet.  For\n  more information, anonymous FTP  cpsr.org:/cpsr/.\n\n\n  (Thanks to Dave Banisar <banisar@washofc.cpsr.org> for contributions\n  here.)\n\n_____\n<6.3> What was `Operation Sundevil' and the Steve Jackson Game case?\n\n  In the early 1990's a fear spread among U.S. law enforcement agencies\n  on the illicit activities of `hackers' and `phreakers' involved in\n  such activities as credit card fraud and long-distance call thievery.\n  \n  (see ftp.eff.org:/pub/SJG/General_Information/EFFector1.04):\n\n  > `Operation Sundevil,' the Phoenix-inspired crackdown of May\n  > 8,1990, concentrated on telephone code-fraud and credit-card\n  > abuse, and followed this seizure plan with some success. \n  > [Bulletin Board Systems] went down all over America, terrifying\n  > the underground and swiftly depriving them of at least some of\n  > their criminal instruments.

The movement reached a\n  crescendo in Texas with the highly publicized case of illegal\n  search and seizure involving the Steve Jackson Games company of\n  Austin Texas on March 1, 1990.  From the column GURPS' LABOUR LOST\n  by Bruce Sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us> in Fantasy and Science\n  Fiction Magazine:\n\n  > In an early morning raid with an unlawful and unconstitutional\n  > warrant, agents of the Secret Service conducted a search of the\n  > SJG office.  When they left they took a manuscript being prepared\n  > for publication, private electronic mail, and several computers,\n  > including the hardware and software of the SJG Computer Bulletin\n  > Board System.  Yet Jackson and his business were not only\n  > innocent of any crime, but never suspects in the first place. \n  > The raid had been staged on the unfounded suspicion that\n  > somewhere in Jackson's office there `might be' a document\n  > compromising the security of the 911 telephone system.\n\n  FBI agents involved in the seizure were named in a civil suit filed\n  on behalf of Steve Jackson Games by The Electronic Frontier\n  Foundation.  See information on EFF below.

Just a question. \n   As a provider of a public BBS service - aren't you bound by law to gurantee\n   intelligble access to the data of the users on the BBS, if police comes\n   with sufficent authorisation ? I guessed this would be  a basic condition\n   for such systems. (I did run a bbs some time ago, but that was in Switzerland)\n\nYou are obliged to let the police search the equipment if they have a\nproper court order. You are under no legal obligation to keep the data\nintelligble. If you wish to run your BBS entirely with all data\nencrypted such that if the police show up they cannot read anything,\nwell, thats their problem. There are no legal restrictions on domestic\nuse of cryptography in the United States -- YET.\n\n--\nPerry Metzger		pmetzger@shearson.com
Archive-name: cryptography-faq/part06\nLast-modified: 1993/4/15\n\n\nFAQ for sci.crypt, part 6: Public-Key Cryptography\n\nThis is the sixth of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ. The parts are\nmostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.\nWe don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.\nNotes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.\n\nThe sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu \nas /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography \nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers \nevery 21 days.\n\n\nContents:\n\n* What is public-key cryptography?\n* What's RSA?\n* Is RSA secure?\n* How fast can people factor numbers?\n* What about other public-key cryptosystems?\n\n\n* What is public-key cryptography?\n\n  In a classic cryptosystem, we have encryption functions E_K and\n  decryption functions D_K such that D_K(E_K(P)) = P for any plaintext\n  P. In a public-key cryptosystem, E_K can be easily computed from some\n  ``public key'' X which in turn is computed from K. X is published, so\n  that anyone can encrypt messages. If D_K cannot be easily computed\n  from X, then only the person who generated K can decrypt messages.\n  That's the essence of public-key cryptography, published by Diffie\n  and Hellman in 1976.\n\n  In a classic cryptosystem, if you want your friends to be able to\n  send secret messages to you, you have to make sure nobody other than\n  them sees the key K. In a public-key cryptosystem, you just publish X,\n  and you don't have to worry about spies.\n\n  This is only the beginning of public-key cryptography. There is an\n  extensive literature on security models for public-key cryptography,\n  applications of public-key cryptography, other applications of the\n  mathematical technology behind public-key cryptography, and so on.\n\n* What's RSA?\n\n  RSA is a public-key cryptosystem defined by Rivest, Shamir, and\n  Adleman.  For full details, there is a FAQ available by ftp at\n  RSA.COM. Here's a small example.\n\n  Plaintexts are positive integers up to 2^{512}. Keys are quadruples\n  (p,q,e,d), with p a 256-bit prime number, q a 258-bit prime number,\n  and d and e large numbers with (de - 1) divisible by (p-1)(q-1). We\n  define E_K(P) = P^e mod pq, D_K(C) = C^d mod pq.\n\n  Now E_K is easily computed from the pair (pq,e)---but, as far as\n  anyone knows, there is no easy way to compute D_K from the pair\n  (pq,e). So whoever generates K can publish (pq,e). Anyone can send a\n  secret message to him; he is the only one who can read the messages.\n\n* Is RSA secure?\n\n  Nobody knows. An obvious attack on RSA is to factor pq into p and q.\n  See below for comments on how fast state-of-the-art factorization\n  algorithms run. Unfortunately nobody has the slightest idea how to\n  prove that factorization---or any realistic problem at all, for that\n  matter---is inherently slow. It is easy to formalize what we mean by\n  ``RSA is/isn't strong''; but, as Hendrik W. Lenstra, Jr., says,\n  ``Exact definitions appear to be necessary only when one wishes to\n  prove that algorithms with certain properties do _not_ exist, and\n  theoretical computer science is notoriously lacking in such negative\n  results.''\n\n* How fast can people factor numbers?\n\n  It depends on the size of the numbers. In October 1992 Arjen Lenstra\n  and Dan Bernstein factored 2^523 - 1 into primes, using about three\n  weeks of MasPar time. (The MasPar is a 16384-processor SIMD machine;\n  each processor can add about 200000 integers per second.) The\n  algorithm there is called the ``number field sieve''; it is quite a\n  bit faster for special numbers like 2^523 - 1 than for general numbers\n  n, but it takes time only about exp(O(log^{1/3} n log^{2/3} log n)) in\n  any case.\n\n  An older and more popular method for smaller numbers is the ``multiple\n  polynomial quadratic sieve'', which takes time exp(O(log^{1/2} n\n  log^{1/2} log n))---faster than the number field sieve for small n,\n  but slower for large n. The breakeven point is somewhere between 100\n  and 150 digits, depending on the implementations.\n\n  Factorization is a fast-moving field---the state of the art just a few\n  years ago was nowhere near as good as it is now. If no new methods are\n  developed, then 2048-bit RSA keys will always be safe from\n  factorization, but one can't predict the future. (Before the number\n  field sieve was found, many people conjectured that the quadratic\n  sieve was asymptotically as fast as any factoring method could be.)\n\n* What about other public-key cryptosystems?

[article deleted]\n\nIt sounds like a joke (but then the war on drugs has always been a joke...).
They may collect the data, but making sense of it is another matter.\n\nOn sci.crypt I'm a graduate CS major (with strong math background) and\nexperienced programmer taking a cryptology course.  (<< keyword for\nalleged NSA filters).\n\nOn sci.skeptic I'm an ex-physics major who's a new-age flake, talking\nabout silly things like how a person's expectations colors what he\nsees.\n\nOn talk.religion.newage I'm a physics geek who enjoys squashing\ninteresting idea with WASP science, although I do write occasional\nposts showing a minimal knowledge of Zen, mythology, etc.\n\nI could go on, but I'm sure you see my point.  I'm a single person,\nbut I react differently on different groups (admittedly, in part\nbecause I'm a contrarian you always shouts "but, on the other hand...").\nOn top of that, I _loath_ certainty and have taken public positions\nin the past for no reason other than to challenge "conventional wisdom".\nI wish them luck in figuring out who "I" am based on that information.\n\n(They can probably figure out I'm liberal, with a technical degree\nbut humanistic interests, from a common thread throughout my posts.\nBut that describes a fair portion of the users of Internet).
It depends on the attack.  Adding a bit to the key doubles the amount of\nwork to be done in a straight brute-force attack, where you try every single\npossible key until one works.  Processing and storage requirements for this\nkind of attack on a 128-bit key seem like they ought to make it effectively\nimpossible.  However, there may be other attacks whose difficulty is (for\nexample) proportional to, say, 2**sqrt(n), or some such.  Also, a long\nkey does you little good if there is a way to incrementally guess a little\nof the key at a time....
The Supreme Court seems to disagree with you -- they have stated that\n"the people" is a term of art refering to an individual right, and\nhave explicitly mentioned the second amendment as an example.\n\nI quote:\n\n  "... 'the people' seems to have been a term of art employed in\n  select parts of the Constitution.  The Preamble declares that the\n  Constitution is ordained, and established by 'the people of the\n  the U.S.'  The Second Amendment protects the right of the people\n  to keep and bear Arms ...."\n	- Supreme Court of the U.S.,  U.S. v. Uerdugo-Uriquidez (1990).\n\nFurthermore, in the Miller decision, they only permitted prosecution\nfor possession of a sawed-off shotgun because the defense had not\npresented testimony and they therefore accepted the argument of the\ngovernment that such weapons have no military value -- they held that\nthe amendment protected the individual right to possess military\nweapons. Unfortunately, no second amendment case has successfully\ngotten to the court in fifty years. However, that does not change the\ninterpretation.\n\nFurthermore, it appears that others disagree with you as well, vis:\n\n "The conclusion is thus inescapable that the history, concept,\n  and wording of the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the\n  United States, as well as its interpretation by every major\n  commentator and court in the first half-century after its ratifi-\n  cation, indicates that what is protected is an individual right\n  of a private citizen to own and carry firearms in a peaceful manner."\n   - Report of the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the\n     Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate,\n     97th Congress, Second Session ( February 1982 )\n\nYou might rightfully ask "well then, what does that first bit about\nmilitias mean?"\n\nWell, "militia" in historical context basically means the whole of the\nadult males of the country. (Indeed, the U.S. Code still defines\n"militia" as all armed men over the age of 17).\n\n   "The Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting\n    in concert for the common defense ....  And ... these men were\n    expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of\n    the kind in common use at the time."\n	- Supreme Court of the United States,  U.S. v. Miller (1939).\n\nThe reason for the phrase being there was to explain the rationale\nbehind the amendment, which was this: by depending on the people to\nbear arms in defense of the country, no centralization of military\npower could ever occur which would permit tyranny -- in short, the\ngovernment would remain perpetually in fear of the people, rather than\nthe other way around.\n\n   "No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.  The strongest reason\n   for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last\n   resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government."\n     - Thomas Jefferson, Proposal Virginia Constitution, June 1776\n       1 Thomas Jefferson Papers, 334 (C. J. Boyd, Ed., 1950).\n\n   "And what country can preserve its liberties, if its rulers are not\n   warned from time to time that this people preserve the spirit of\n   resistance ?  Let them take arms ... The tree of liberty must be\n   refreshed from time to time, with the blood of patriots and tyrants."\n     - Thomas Jefferson (letter to William S. Smith, 1787, in\n       Jefferson, On Democracy 20, S. Padover, ed., 1939).\n\n   "Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed;\n   as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe.  The supreme\n   power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword;\n   because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute\n   a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on\n   any pretense, raised in the United States."\n     - Noah Webster, "An Examination into the Leading Principles\n       of the Federal Constitution" (1787), in Pamphlets on the\n       Constitution of the United States (P. Ford, 1888).\n\nYou may disagree with the second amendment, and wish that it be\nrepealed, but please do not pretend that it isn't there and that it\ndoesn't mean what it says. You might argue that conditions have\nchanged and that it should no longer be present, but you can't imagine\nit away.\n\nI could fill a book with detailed argumentation. Many have already.\n\nHowever, none of this has anything to do with cryptography.  Lets get\nit out of here. If you insist on discussing this, please do it in\ntalk.politics.guns, where people will gladly discuss this matter with\nyou.\n\n--\nPerry Metzger		pmetzger@shearson.com
We might get further if we begin by accepting that the government \nreally couldn't be bothered less about the political opinions of the \nright wing pro establishment types. Just about the only circumstances \nin which I could think that they would be interested in their political \nviews would be to recruit them as spooks. They can be guaranteed to give\nthe government line when it counts. In US history it has been the \nsocialists such as myself who have been persecuted. \n\n\nNow before people start asserting that there is no mechanism by which\nthe administration can get their new chip adopted without legal force\nlets try thinking.\n\nIn the first place the clipper chip must have existed for several years as\na defense project. Therefore this is not a party matter at all. George Bush\nwas in any case hardly adverse to tapping calls, he was chief spook \nremember.\n\nSecondly the govt can quite easily apply pressure. They simply "ask" their\nchums who they give huge defense contracts to (motorola etc) to be "nice"\nboys. After all Bill is giving them a nice little trade monopoly since the\nchips won't be avaliable to foreign firms.\n\nThirdly the people who consider the Democrats to be socialist are not the\nsame as the ones who consider socialists to be communist. People might know\nthis if the US education system did not suffer from the Mcarthyite and \nDewy version of political correctness - the sort with tribunals and show \ntrials. Ever seen Ed Meese pissed? I have, it was when he said that socialism\nand communism were the same thing and brought the house down with laughter.\nIt took several minutes before we realised that he was serious.\n\n\nPhill Hallam-Baker
[...]\n\n[From Mike Godwin <mnemonic@eff.org>, posted with permission - Carl]\n\nSadly, it does not. Suspects can be compelled to give handwriting and\nvoice exemplars, and to take blood and DNA tests.\n\n\nNo, but they could compell you to produce the key to a safe where, as it\nhappens, evidence that will convict you is stored. \n\nThe crypto-key disclosure issue hasn't come up yet, but current law\nsuggests that it's a loser for the defendant--he'll be compelled to turn\nover the key.\n\nThe test for compelled self-incrimination is whether the material to \nbe disclosed *in itself* tends to inculpate the discloser. In the example\nI gave above, the safe key itself has no testimonial value--ergo, it can\nbe disclosed under compulsion (e.g., subpoena duces tecum).\n\nMoreover, the government can always immunize the disclosure of a crypto\nkey--compelling you to disclose the key at the price of not using the fact\nof your disclosure as evidence in the case against you. Of course, they\ncan use whatever they discover as a result of this disclosure against\nyou.\n\n\n--Mike
: At the company I worked for previously, I received a file that was des encryped\n: and the person that had sent it, went on vaction.

Three questions:\n\n1) What hardware did you use?\n2) When you found the key, was there anything about it that was special\n   that meant you had been lucky to find it early?

The law is much worse than worthless.  It gives police the power to put\ninnocent people in jail because they (the police) find something they don't\nunderstand.  Most police don't know what the return key does, never mind the\ndifference between a core file and classified military secrets.\n\nThere are plenty of scenarios where the user would have no idea what something\nis either.  It could be uninitialized junk.  The burden of proof is on the\nuser to show that it's something a normal upstanding citizen should have.  No\none should ever be put in that situation, especially in America.\n\nWhat's disgusting about this is how easily most people go along with it, to\nprovide a bargaining chip against some hypothetical *alleged* child molester\nor drug dealer, or whatever bad thing is in style at the time.  Basically most\npeople don't have a clear distinction between criminals and suspects.\n\nAs an analogy, it's like they find a loose screw in your house, and they\ninsist that you're building a bomb or machine gun.  They ask you where it came\nfrom (like you'd know), and ask you to prove your claim.  When you explain it\nin such simple terms, people may start to get the idea.\n\nAs a matter of fact, i do keep random files on my disk.  The reason is,\nwithout special-purpose hardware, it takes a long time to generate good random\nbits.  I have programs that crank out a couple bits per minute, which is\npretty conservative, but over time that's more than i need.\n\nIf you think about it, there's no point in actually encrypting random data,\nbecause it just gives you different random data.  If you want some data to\nlook like an encrypted file, you just put an appropriate header on it.  If\nenough people do this, some of them will be put in jail.\n\nWhen you get arrested and the police ask for your keys, you can tell them it's\njust random junk, although of course they won't believe you.  While you're\nsitting in jail, you can take consolation in the fact that the government will\nburn a few CPU-years trying to find something that's not there.
Yes, "Clipper" is a trademark of Intergraph.  Its the RISC chip used\nin some of thier workstations. \n\nI wonder what Intergraph is going to do to this infringement on thier\nname sake?
<\n<>If the Clinton Clipper is so very good, [...]\n<\n<Please note that Bill Clinton probably has little if anything to do\n<with the design, implementation or reasoning behind this chip or behind\n<any "moves" being made using this chip as a pawn.\n\nUh, I notice he has not either asked for or allowed public input, and he damn\nsure has not stopped it...\n\n<Remember, when you elect a president of the united states, it's not\n<the case that all the Republicans, etc. in the NSA and FBI and CIA\n<immediately pack their bags and get replaced by a team of fresh young\n<Democrats.

He is the president, therefore\nhe is RESPONSIBLE for the actions of the Execuitive Branch.

[...]\n\nI don't claim to be a crypto analyist... there isn't a whole lot of good\nliterature on the subject, and the best people don't seem to publish\ntheir work :)  but I rather doubt the approach such folks use is brute\nforce (sorry to have implied that in my previous post).  The history\nof these things is folks find clever ways of limiting the search and\nbang from there.\n\nI guess my real problem with Skipjack is I can not believe NSA would\nmake publicly available a system they couldn't break if they wanted...\nit just isn't in their charter.  Remember DES came from IBM, not NSA\nand, when first published, was given a useful life of 20 years... I think\nwe are well past that point now :(\n\nRemember, based on the size of the NSA budget, they spend a lot more\non the technology of decryption than most computer companies spend on\nR&D.  I have to imagine their stuff is real interesting...\n\nA friend who once worked for them (he is dead now) said he always enjoyed\nmonitoring SAC's (Strategic Air Command) crypto traffic :)  and I rather\nsuspect that stuff is a bit more complex than Skipjack  (Or was it the\nmilitary got the stuff from the NSA just like we get Skipjack from them ;)\n[BTW, folks, NSA wasn't being given the keys.  And the Walker spy case\nshows for some of the systems, the KGB didn't need them either.]

My speculation does not include or depend upon a trapdoor in RSAREF. I\ndo not believe that RSA would consent to such.  \n\nHowever, there are other limitation in the concept of RSAREF in which\nNSA has an interest.  It has an interest in a limited number of\nimplementations, i.e., targets.  It has an interest in fixed key or\nmaximum modulus size.  \n\nIt has a legitimate (literally) right to pursue such interests.  Within\nbounds, it probably has a right to pursue those interests by covert\nmeans.  At least it has the same right as the rest of us not to disclose\nall of its motives and intentions.  (Institutions are not self-aware;\nthey do not know their intentions in any meaningful sense.)
Thus said ee92jks@brunel.ac.uk (Jonathan K Saville):\n\nPGP is not available on the archive site rsa.com.  If it were, it\nwould be highly amusing, since rsa.com (actually Public Key Partners,\nbut it's the same entity) is the organization holding the patents\nwhich they claim are violated if you actually "make, use or sell" PGP.\nI believe those patents also apply in Canada, but I'm not a patent\nlawyer or anything.\n\nThere is no such thing as freely redistributable code for RSA which\ncan be used in North America without legal entanglements.  You may\nwish to consider RSAREF, however, which *is* available from the FTP\nsite rsa.com in /rsaref but probably doesn't meet your definition of\n"freely redistributable" (it's readily available in source, in C, and\ndoes RSA, MD5, etc. and comes with a license allowing noncommercial\nuse.  Like any other strong crypto software, it's not exportable\nlegally.  It can be modified with permission from RSADSI, which a\nnumber of people have received in the past.)  For reasons that aren't\nentirely clear to me, RSA says that only U.S. people should take\nRSAREF from its server, although there aren't ITAR issues regarding\nCanada.  The RIPEM distribution site (ripem.msu.edu) has RSAREF in its\ndistribution, and is OK for Canadians.\n--\nMarc VanHeyningen   mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu   MIME & RIPEM accepted
The cryptographic algorythm MUST be kept secret, or\nprivate individuals could make ClipperClones with\nwhich they could transmit messages which the feds would not have\nready access to.  This is clearly unacceptable.
No thanks.  This topic is of interest to a much wider audience.\n\n\n"In making this decision, I intend to prevent the private sector from\ndeveloping, except with the government's approval, other microcircuits\nor algorithms that are more effective in assuring privacy."
Actually, old video games and pinball machines are supposed to work pretty\ngood (at blocking EM eavesdropping), too.  Those things put out a LOT of EM\nnoise.  Back in the 80's, I read about computer companies putting bunches\nof games in their buildings for just this purpose (not to mention the $$$).
I really like these claims. Where did they come from? We hear,\npractically daily, that the NSA monitors, oh, everything. They can\ncrack anything. They'd never release a cryptosystem they couldn't crack.\n\n	Where do people get these fascinating facts? 'The Puzzle Palace'?\nIf you can get it for a buck, 2nd hand, it must be true, eh? I'm pretty\nsure the NSA is supposed to, among many other things, provide high-quality\ncryptosystems to a variety of places. I don't recall reading anywhere\nreliable that they're supposed to:\n\n	1) Monitor my phonecalls.\n	2) Monitor usenet.\n	3) Provide only cryptosystems they can easily crack.\n	4) etc etc.\n\n	This is not to say that they *don't*, they might. But you don't\nknow that they do, and you have no evidence that they do, for almost\nall values of you. It follows, therefore, that for most values of 'you',\nyour claims about the NSA border on paranoia.
As of yet, there has been no description of the general principles\nbehind the Clipper proposal. For example, is this a public key system\nor a private key system? If the latter, then I don't see how the\nsystem could work (given that the keys are tied to the device and\nnot the person).\n\nFurther, the escrowed 80-bit keys are split into two 40-bit chunks.\nI would guess that the availability of one of these 40-bit chunks\nand a reasonable key-search machine, would allow you to read the traffic.\nI'm not suggesting that this is a deliberate weakness of the system,\nbut it does make you think. Of course, this is easily fixable by \ngiving out two 80-bit chunks which could be x-ored to generate the \nreal 80-bit key.
No wonder American businesses are going down the tubes! :-|\n\n\n(It's NIST, not NSA.  NSA is not supposed to have anything to do with this.)\nThey didn't say that.  They said is was better than some commercial-grade\nencryptions.  I, for one, wouldn't trust them if they did, unless they\nrelease the algorithm for investigation.\n\n\nMaybe the ACLU and EFF.  (It would have to be a non-profit, so the big 8\nwould be out.)\n\n\nI wouldn't trust the NSA.  I think I would trust the President on this, but\nI'm not certain he would be told.\n\n\nThat's your problem.\n\n\nI want to emphasize the I am not speaking for Beckman Instruments at this\npoint.  However, we are an international company, and I would like to think\nthat our customers come first, ahead of our government's whims.
Absolutely, if I were assured by someone I trusted that the black box was\nmore secure. I have nothing to conceal from the government, but I would like\nto be sure that any Russian, Japanese, French, or other competitors for my\nservices can't read my traffic. I'd like to be sure that competitive bid\ninformation was safe from commercial competitors and foreign governments\nwhich would aid them.\n\nI believe the NSA has identical motivations with respect to my activities.\nThe President and many other senior government officials have made it very\nclear that they share these motivations. Thus I'd trust them on the\n"coincidence of interests" argument as well as on a basic trust in their\nprofessionalism and a high confidence in their skills.\n\nDavid
I am a PhD student.\nCan I get the sci.crypt group posted directly to me???\nAlso I would like some feed-back on the encryption schemes that my research in\nfinite fields can be applied to. Any takers\nReply to gamv25@udcf.gla.ac.uk\nThanks yours\nGavin.
Could you expand on this? I have a feeling you're right, but I don't quite\nunderstand.
What follows is my opinion. It is not asserted to be "the truth" so no\nflames, please.  It comes out of a background of 20 years as a senior\ncorporate staff executive in two Fortune 50 companies.\n\nI'd be happy to use a crypto system supplied by the NSA for business, if\nthey told me it was more secure than DES, and in particular resistant to\nattempts by Japanese, French, and other competitive companies and\ngovernments to break.\n\nI'd be happy to do so even with escrowed keys, provided I was happy about\nthe bona fides of the escrow agencies (the Federal Reserve would certainly\nsatisfy me, as would something set up by one of the big 8 accounting firms).\n\nI'd trust the NSA or the President if they stated there were no trap\ndoors--I'd be even happier if a committee of independent experts examined\nthe thing under seal of secrecy and reported back that it was secure.\n\nI'd trust something from the NSA long before I'd trust something from some\nSwiss or anybody Japanese.\n\nThis may seem surprising to some here, but I suggest most corporations would\nfeel the same way. Most/many/some (pick one) corporations have an attitude\nthat the NSA is part of our government and "we support our government", as\none very famous CEO put it to me one day.\n\nJust some perspective from another point of view.
Archive-name: cryptography-faq/part08\nLast-modified: 1993/4/15\n\n\nFAQ for sci.crypt, part 8: Technical Miscellany\n\nThis is the eighth of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ. The parts are\nmostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.\nWe don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.\nNotes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.\n\nThe sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu \nas /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography \nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers\nevery 21 days.\n\n\nContents\n\n* How do I recover from lost passwords in WordPerfect?\n* How do I break a Vigenere (repeated-key) cipher?\n* How do I send encrypted mail under UNIX? [PGP, RIPEM, PEM, ...]\n* Is the UNIX crypt command secure?\n* How do I use compression with encryption?\n* Is there an unbreakable cipher?\n* What does ``random'' mean in cryptography?\n* What is the unicity point (a.k.a. unicity distance)?\n* What is key management and why is it important?\n* Can I use pseudo-random or chaotic numbers as a key stream?\n* What is the correct frequency list for English letters?\n* What is the Enigma?\n* How do I shuffle cards?\n* Can I foil S/W pirates by encrypting my CD-ROM?\n* Can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers?\n* What is the coding system used by VCR+?\n\n\n* How do I recover from lost passwords in WordPerfect?\n\n  WordPerfect encryption has been shown to be very easy to break.\n  The method uses XOR with two repeating key streams: a typed password\n  and a byte-wide counter initialized to 1+<the password length>. Full\n  descriptions are given in Bennett [BEN87] and Bergen and Caelli\n  [BER91].\n\n  decrypt WordPerfect document files and I think I have a solution. \n  There is a software company named: Accessdata (87 East 600 South,\n  Orem, UT 84058), 1-800-658-5199 that has a software package that will\n  decrypt any WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3, Quatro-Pro, MS Excel and Paradox\n  files. The cost of the package is $185. Steep prices, but if you\n  think your pw key is less than 10 characters, (or 10 char) give them a\n  call and ask for the free demo disk. The demo disk will decrypt files\n  that have a 10 char or less pw key.''\n\n* How do I break a Vigenere (repeated-key) cipher?\n\n  A repeated-key cipher, where the ciphertext is something like the\n  plaintext xor KEYKEYKEYKEY (and so on), is called a Vigenere cipher.\n  If the key is not too long and the plaintext is in English, do the\n  following: \n\n  1. Discover the length of the key by counting coincidences.\n  (See Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].) Trying each displacement of\n  the ciphertext against itself, count those bytes which are equal. \n  If the two ciphertext portions have used the same key, something\n  over 6% of the bytes will be equal. If they have used different\n  key, then less than 0.4% will be equal (assuming random 8-bit bytes\n  of key covering normal ASCII text). The smallest displacement which\n  indicates an equal key is the length of the repeated key.\n\n  2. Shift the text by that length and XOR it with itself. This\n  removes the key and leaves you with text XORed with itself. Since\n  English has about 1 bit of real information per byte, 2 streams of\n  text XORed together has 2 bits of info per 8-bit byte, providing\n  plenty of redundancy for choosing a unique decryption. (And in fact\n  one stream of text XORed with itself has just 1 bit per byte.)\n\n  If the key is short, it might be even easier to treat this as a\n  standard polyalphabetic substitution. All the old cryptanalysis\n  texts show how to break those. It's possible with those methods, in\n  the hands of an expert, if there's only ten times as much text as key.\n  See, for example, Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].\n\n* How do I send encrypted mail under UNIX? [PGP, RIPEM, PEM, ...]\n\n  Here's one popular method, using the des command:\n\n    cat file | compress | des private_key | uuencode | mail\n\n  Meanwhile, there is a de jure Internet standard in the works called\n  PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail). It is described in RFCs 1421 through\n  1424. To join the PEM mailing list, contact pem-dev-request@tis.com.\n  There is a beta version of PEM being tested at the time of this\n  writing.\n\n  There are also two programs available in the public domain for encrypting\n  mail: PGP and RIPEM.  Both are available by FTP.  Each has its own\n  newsgroup: alt.security.pgp and alt.security.ripem.  Each has its own FAQ\n  as well.\n\n  PGP is most commonly used outside the USA since it uses the RSA algorithm\n  without a license and RSA's patent is valid only (or at least primarily)\n  in the USA.\n\n  RIPEM is most commonly used inside the USA since it uses the RSAREF which\n  is freely available within the USA but not available for shipment outside\n  the USA.\n\n  Since both programs use a secret key algorithm for encrypting the body of\n  the message (PGP used IDEA; RIPEM uses DES) and RSA for encrypting the\n  message key, they should be able to interoperate freely.  Although there\n  have been repeated calls for each to understand the other's formats and\n  algorithm choices, no interoperation is available at this time (as far as\n  we know).\n\n* Is the UNIX crypt command secure?\n\n  No. See [REE84]. There is a program available called cbw (crypt\n  breaker's workbench) which can be used to do ciphertext-only attacks\n  on files encrypted with crypt. One source for CBW is [FTPCB].\n\n* How do I use compression with encryption?\n\n  A number of people have proposed doing perfect compression followed by\n  some simple encryption method (e.g., XOR with a repeated key).\n\n  Unfortunately, you can only compress perfectly if you know the exact\n  distribution of possible inputs. For all practical purposes it's\n  impossible to describe ``the typical English text'' beyond coarse\n  characteristics such as single-letter frequencies. You can build up\n  more and more sophisticated models of your inputs, but if the enemy\n  has a slightly more accurate model, he'll be able to find some\n  redundancy in your compressed output.\n\n  Note that nearly all practical compression schemes, unless they\n  have been designed with cryptography in mind, produce output that\n  actually starts off with high redundancy. For example, the output of\n  UNIX compress begins with a well-known three-byte ``magic number''\n  that can serve as an entering wedge for cryptanalysis.\n  \n  This is not to say that compression before encryption is inherently a\n  bad idea; it just has to be done very, very carefully, and by no means\n  removes the need for strong encryption.\n\n  Compression after encryption is silly.\n\n* Is there an unbreakable cipher?\n\n  Yes. The one-time pad is unbreakable; see part 4. Unfortunately the\n  one-time pad requires secure distribution of as much key material as\n  plaintext.\n\n  Of course, a cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be\n  useful. Rather, it needs to be strong enough to resist attacks by\n  likely enemies for whatever length of time the data it protects is\n  expected to remain valid.\n\n* What does ``random'' mean in cryptography?\n\n  Cryptographic applications demand much more out of a pseudorandom\n  number generator than most applications. For a source of bits to be\n  cryptographically random, it must be computationally impossible to\n  predict what the Nth random bit will be given complete knowledge of\n  the algorithm or hardware generating the stream and the sequence of\n  0th through N-1st bits, for all N up to the lifetime of the source.\n\n  A software generator (also known as pseudo-random) has the function\n  of expanding a truly random seed to a longer string of apparently\n  random bits.  This seed must be large enough not to be guessed by\n  the opponent.  Ideally, it should also be truly random (perhaps\n  generated by a hardware random number source).\n\n  Those who have Sparcstation 1 workstations could, for example,\n  generate random numbers using the audio input device as a source of\n  entropy, by not connecting anything to it.  For example,\n\n	cat /dev/audio | compress - >foo\n\n  gives a file of high entropy (not random but with much randomness in\n  it).  One can then encrypt that file using part of itself as a key,\n  for example, to convert that seed entropy into a pseudo-random\n  string.\n\n  When looking for hardware devices to provide this entropy, it is\n  important really to measure the entropy rather than just assume that\n  because it looks complicated to a human, it must be "random".  For\n  example, disk operation completion times sound like they might be\n  unpredictable (to many people) but a spinning disk is much like a\n  clock and its output completion times are relatively low in entropy.\n\n* What is the unicity point (a.k.a. unicity distance)?\n\n  See [SHA49]. The unicity distance is an approximation to that amount\n  of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information (entropy) in\n  the corresponding source text and encryption key equals the number\n  of ciphertext bits used. Ciphertexts significantly longer than this\n  can be shown probably to have a unique decipherment. This is used to\n  back up a claim of the validity of a ciphertext-only cryptanalysis. \n  Ciphertexts significantly shorter than this are likely to have\n  multiple, equally valid decryptions and therefore to gain security\n  from the opponent's difficulty choosing the correct one.\n\n  Unicity distance, like all statistical or information-theoretic\n  measures, does not make deterministic predictions but rather gives\n  probabilistic results: namely, the minimum amount of ciphertext\n  for which it is likely that there is only a single intelligible\n  plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext, when all possible keys\n  are tried for the decryption. Working cryptologists don't normally\n  deal with unicity distance as such. Instead they directly determine\n  the likelihood of events of interest.\n\n  Let the unicity distance of a cipher be D characters. If fewer than\n  D ciphertext characters have been intercepted, then there is not\n  enough information to distinguish the real key from a set of\n  possible keys. DES has a unicity distance of 17.5 characters,\n  which is less than 3 ciphertext blocks (each block corresponds to\n  8 ASCII characters). This may seem alarmingly low at first, but\n  the unicity distance gives no indication of the computational work\n  required to find the key after approximately D characters have been\n  intercepted.\n\n  In fact, actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along the lines used\n  in discussing unicity distance. (Like other measures such as key\n  size, unicity distance is something that guarantees insecurity if\n  it's too small, but doesn't guarantee security if it's high.) Few\n  practical cryptosystems are absolutely impervious to analysis; all\n  manner of characteristics might serve as entering ``wedges'' to crack\n  some cipher messages. However, similar information-theoretic\n  considerations are occasionally useful, for example, to determine a\n  recommended key change interval for a particular cryptosystem.\n  Cryptanalysts also employ a variety of statistical and\n  information-theoretic tests to help guide the analysis in the most\n  promising directions.\n\n  Unfortunately, most literature on the application of information\n  statistics to cryptanalysis remains classified, even the seminal\n  1940 work of Alan Turing (see [KOZ84]). For some insight into the\n  possibilities, see [KUL68] and [GOO83].\n\n* What is key management and why is it important?\n\n  One of the fundamental axioms of cryptography is that the enemy is in\n  full possession of the details of the general cryptographic system,\n  and lacks only the specific key data employed in the encryption. (Of\n  course, one would assume that the CIA does not make a habit of telling\n  Mossad about its cryptosystems, but Mossad probably finds out anyway.)\n  Repeated use of a finite amount of key provides redundancy that can\n  eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress. Thus, especially in\n  modern communication systems where vast amounts of information are\n  transferred, both parties must have not only a sound cryptosystem but\n  also enough key material to cover the traffic.\n\n  Key management refers to the distribution, authentication, and\n  handling of keys.\n\n  A publicly accessible example of modern key management technology\n  is the STU III secure telephone unit, which for classified use\n  employs individual coded ``Crypto Ignition Keys'' and a central Key\n  Management Center operated by NSA. There is a hierarchy in that\n  certain CIKs are used by authorized cryptographic control\n  personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic keys and\n  to perform installation/maintenance functions, such as the\n  reporting of lost CIKs.\n\n  This should give an inkling of the extent of the key management\n  problem. For public-key systems, there are several related issues,\n  many having to do with ``whom do you trust?''\n\n* Can I use pseudo-random or chaotic numbers as a key stream?\n\n  Chaotic equations and fractals produce an apparent randomness from\n  relatively compact generators. Perhaps the simplest example is a\n  linear congruential sequence, one of the most popular types of random\n  number generators, where there is no obvious dependence between seeds\n  and outputs. Unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will, in a\n  high enough dimension, show up as a regular lattice. Mathematically\n  this lattice corresponds to structure which is notoriously easy for\n  cryptanalysts to exploit. More complicated generators have more\n  complicated structure, which is why they make interesting pictures---\n  but a cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable\n  structure at all.\n\n  See [KNU81], exercise 3.5-7; [REE77]; and [BOY89].\n\n* What is the correct frequency list for English letters?\n\n  There are three answers to this question, each slightly deeper than\n  the one before. You can find the first answer in various books:\n  namely, a frequency list computed directly from a certain sample of\n  English text. Of course any such list will be ``correctly'' computed,\n  but exactly which list you get depends on which sample was taken.\n\n  The second answer is that the question doesn't make sense. What do\n  you mean by ``English letters''? The ``English language'' is not a\n  fixed, finite, closed object that can be exactly characterized. It\n  has changed over time; it is different between different authors.\n  Any particular message will have different statistics from those of\n  the language as a whole.\n\n  The third answer is that yes, no particular message is going to have\n  exactly the same characteristics as English in general, but for all\n  reasonable statistical uses these slight discrepancies won't matter.\n  In fact there's an entire field called ``Bayesian statistics'' (other\n  buzzwords are ``maximum entropy methods'' and ``maximum likelihood\n  estimation'') which studies questions like ``What's the chance that a\n  text with these letter frequencies is in English?'' and comes up with\n  reasonably robust answers.\n\n  So make your own list from your own samples of English text. It will\n  be good enough for practical work, if you use it properly.\n\n* What is the Enigma?\n\n  ``For a project in data security we are looking for sources of\n  information about the German Enigma code and how it was broken by\n  the British during WWII.''\n\n  See [WEL82], [DEA85], [KOZ84], [HOD83], [KAH91].\n\n* How do I shuffle cards?\n\n  Card shuffling is a special case of the permutation of an array of\n  values, using a random or pseudo-random function.  All possible output\n  permutations of this process should be equally likely.  To do this, you\n  need a random function (modran(x)) which will produce a uniformly\n  distributed random integer in the interval [0..x-1].  Given that\n  function, you can shuffle with the following [C] code: (assuming ARRLTH\n  is the length of array arr[] and swap() interchanges values at the two\n  addresses given)\n\n  for ( n = ARRLTH-1; n > 0 ; n-- ) swap( &arr[modran( n+1 )], &arr[n] ) ;\n\n  modran(x) can not be achieved exactly with a simple (ranno() % x) since\n  ranno()'s interval may not be divisible by x, although in most cases the\n  error will be very small.  To cover this case, one can take ranno()'s\n  modulus mod x, call that number y, and if ranno() returns a value less\n  than y, go back and get another ranno() value.\n\n\n* Can I foil S/W pirates by encrypting my CD-ROM?\n\n  Someone will frequently express the desire to publish a CD-ROM with\n  possibly multiple pieces of software, perhaps with each encrypted\n  separately, and will want to use different keys for each user (perhaps\n  even good for only a limited period of time) in order to avoid piracy.\n\n  As far as we know, this is impossible, since there is nothing in standard\n  PC or workstation hardware which uniquely identifies the user at the\n  keyboard.  If there were such an identification, then the CD-ROM could be\n  encrypted with a key based in part on the one sold to the user and in\n  part on the unique identifier.  However, in this case the CD-ROM is one\n  of a kind and that defeats the intended purpose.\n\n  If the CD-ROM is to be encrypted once and then mass produced, there must\n  be a key (or set of keys) for that encryption produced at some stage in\n  the process.  That key is useable with any copy of the CD-ROM's data.\n  The pirate needs only to isolate that key and sell it along with the\n  illegal copy.\n\n\n* Can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers?\n\n  Utah sells products that break the password scheme of a number of\n  popular Macintosh and PC software packages.  Their telephone number\n  is (801) 224-6970\n\n  No PD software has been cited but there are many papers on the\n  subject....\n\n  Peleg, S. and Rosenfeld, A.

Isn't Clipper a trademark of Fairchild Semiconductor?
nobody seems to have noticed that the clipper chip *must* have been\nunder development for considerably longer than the 3 months that\nclinton has been president.  this is not something that choosing\nchoosing bush over clinton would have changed in the slightest; it has\nbeen in the works for some time.
Interestingly enough, in designing the escrow, we may want to use some\nrather unusual technology, such as sealed boxes of paper, or\ndestructive read memory, rather than typical computer databases, which\nis fun for a database of hundreds of millions of keys.\n\nThe greatest danger of the escrow database, if it were kept on disk,\nwould be the chance that a complete copy could somehow leak out.  You\ncan design lots of protection, but with enough corruption a complete\ncopy is always possible.   Storing it on paper or something very hard\nto copy at once may actually make sense.  Or a medium that can't be\ncopied -- for example, something with very slow access times or which\nleaves a destructive trail if it is even read.\n\nOf course then it's hard to backup.  However, I think the consequences\nof no backup -- the data is not there when a warrant comes -- are worse\nthan the consequences of a secret backup.\n\nAn audit trail that reveals when data has been access, that *can't* be\nerased by the humans involved, is also necessary.
<If Clipper comes to cellular phones along with legal proscriptions against\n<using other cipher systems on these phones, a new and potentially dangerous\n<class of crime is created.\n\nAside from possession of "terrorist tools" (unapproved encryption devices\nor programs)...\n\n<Criminals who very badly want inscrutable tactical communications (specifically\n<the terrorists and drug dealers who proponents of key escrow cite as threats)\n<will be highly motivated to steal the cipher phone of a legitimate user, and\n<to kill this person or hold them hostage so discovery of compromise of the\n<device will be delayed.\n<\n<Once a suitable collection of devices is stolen, criminals can communicate\n<with impunity (assuming the cipher system carries no trapdoors apart from\n<key escrow) until and unless the compromise is discovered by some other means.\n<\n<Because life-is-cheap criminals are currently willing to kill people to steal\n<very large and conspicuous property (luxury cars), it is reasonable to assume\n<that they will be willing to kill people to steal small and inconspicuous\n<property (a cipher cellular phone).

Lets carry this one step further. Suppose the text of the key is\nin itself conclusive evidence of the SAME CRIME for which the\nencrypted material is further evidence. I find myself envisaging a\nscenario like this:\n\nYou have made some scans of Peanuts strips. You encrypt them. The key\nis a phrase.\n\nThe Comic Police haul you in. They seize your system. They find the\nencrypted file.\n\nCP:    "Whats that file?"\n\nYou:   "I take the fifth."\n\nCP:    "What's the keyphrase to that file?" \n\nYou:   "I take the fifth."\n\nJudge: "You have to reveal the keyphrase" [I disagree, but I'm not a judge.]\n\nYou:   "Your Honor, revealing the keyphrase, in it's own right, would \n	tend to incriminate me of breaking laws, independent of what \n	may or may not be in the encrypted file."  \n\nJudge: "I grant you immunity from whatever may be learned from the key\n	itself"\n\nYou:    "The keyphrase is: "I confess to deliberately evading copyright; \n	the file encoded with this keyphrase contains illegal scans of \n        copyrighted Peanuts strips.""\n\nJudge and CP: "Oh."\n\n     How will they get you now? I'm not saying that they won't, or\ncan't (or even that they shouldn't :-), but what legal mechanism will\nthey use? Should we be crossposting this to misc.legal?
: Clipper Chip is a response to the fact that there is no business\n: or professional body in a position to establish a standard and\n: provide chipsets to implement it for analog or digial transmission\n: systems.\n: \n: RSA might be in position to do it, if they had active cooperation of\n: a couple of manufacturers of cellular phones or desktop phones.\n.......\n: Is RSA independt of the gov enough to spearhead this?  I, for one,\n: would *gladly* pay royalties via purchasing secure phones.\n\n\nHear hear! I completely agree that we need to work quickly to\nestablish alternatives to the government's Clinton Clipper. As Brad\nTempleton and others have noted, once the Clipper becomes ensconced in\nenough phones there will be enormous pressure to make it the *legal*\nstandard, and it will become the "market* standard as well. (There is\na lot of confusion in the proposal about whether the use of Clipper is\nmandated, about whether non-escrow alternatives will be allowed, etc.)\n\n(There are also unclear issues about how hard, or how illegal, it will\nbe to make "workalikes" which meet the standard but which generate\nphony or untappable keys...I'm sure the next several weeks will see\nthese issues thrashed out in this and other groups.)\n\nMeanwhile, I'd be interested to hear RSA Data Security's reaction.\nOften criticized in this group for their licensing policies (the usual\ncomplaints about MailSafe costing too much, at $125 or so, and the\ngeneral issue of software patents...), we may find that *allying*\nourselves with RSA is the best thing we can do. What's a mere\nlicensing fee when our liberty may be at stake? (If everyone who\nwanted true security paid, say, $100 for a lifetime use of all of\nRSA's patents--which expire in the period 1998-2002, or so--then RSA\nwould make tons of money and be happy, I'm sure. A small price to pay.\nFor those to whom $100 sounds like too much, I'm sure the actual terms\ncould be different, spread out over several years, whatever. To me,\nit's a small price to pay.)\n\nStrong crypto means strong privacy. Escrowing keys, sending copies of\nkeys to large databases, and splitting keys into two 40-bit pieces,\nall done with secret and non-analyzable protocols and algorithms, is\n*NOT* strong crypto!\n\nWhatever some of us may think about the abstract principles of\npatenting number theory applications, this minor issue pales in\ncomparison with the potential dangers of the Clipper proposal (note\nthat I said "potential"...we'll presumably learn more in the coming\nmonths).\n\nThe RSA algorithms are at least public, have been analyzed and\nattacked for years, and source code is available (to better ensure no\ndeliberate weakenesses or trapdoors).\n\nI know of a number of groups putting together voice encryption systems\nusing off-the-shelf hardware (like Soundblaster boards for the PC) and\nCELP-type software. The new generations of PCs, using fast 486s and\nPentiums are fast enough to do real-time voice encryption. Combined\nwith Diffie-Hellman key exchange, this should provide an alternative\nto the Clipper system.\n\nOf course, we don't really know if the Administration proposes to\noutlaw competing systems. (It seems to me that their goal of tapping\nterrorists, child pornographers, and Hilary bashers would be thwarted\nif low-cost alternatives to Clipper proliferated. Not to defend child\npornographers or terrorists, but limiting basic freedoms to catch a\nfew criminals is not the American way of doing things. End of soapbox\nmode.)\n\nI suggest we in these groups set aside any differences we may have had\nwith RSA (and don't look at me....I have both MacPGP *and* a fully\nlegal copy of "MailSafe"!) and instead work with them as quickly as we can.\n\nRSA?, Jim?, are you listening?\n\n-Tim May\n\nP.S. I reserve the right to retract these opinions if it should turn\nout that RSA Data Security was involved in the Clipper proposal.
I am not an expert in the cryptography science, but some basic things\nseem evident to me, things which this Clinton Clipper do not address.\nThe all pertain to opportunites for abuse, and conclusions based on what\nI have seen the membership of this group (except for two notable persons)\nagree to.  If anything bad is possible by the government in theory, it\nalmost always ends up happening in fact.  So the key is to make abuse\nIMPOSSIBLE.  Question authority, and remember power DOES corrupt.\n\nI think one has to regard this whole idea in the sense that it WILL be\nexpanded to include other data forms, such as data transfer and stored\ndata. and as such should be treated as if it were expanded (or such\nexpansion will be almost impossible to stop, using Clipper as a precident).\nThere was a hint of that in the proposal, remember.  That said, please\nbear with me, I am not very articulate, so I take more words to say\nwhat others could say much more briefly.  Thank you.\n\n\nAs I suggested this is NOW.  The hint is in the proposal that this or\nsimilar proposals are being considered for other forms of encryptions\nsuch as data transfer, data files, and such, largely dependent on how\nthis thing is accepted or flies.  I think one would be wise to treat\nthis in the manner one would when (not if) it gets expanded to other\nareas than cellular phones.  I think this is guaranteed to happen, if\nthis proposal gets by.  Salami politics.  It has been and is used in\nseveral other areas, it is certain to be used here.  Government is not\ngoing to easily give up on the idea that they should be able to eavesedrop\nwhenever they want to.  'Court order required' has proven to be a rather\nflimsy guarantee.  If the case warrants, they can always sieze the\nmaterial, and force one to give the key, or sit in jail forever on\nperiodically renewed contempt charges.  So it is not denying the justice\nsystem the information, nor the ability to lock someone up if guilty\n(or refuses to divulge the means to access the info - this is not\nprotected under the Fifth - one can be forced to perform ACTS that would\nresult in divulging incriminating evidence).  So, blocking restrictions\non private encryption is not preventing LEGITIMATE law enforcement - it\ndoes make ILLEGITIMATE law enforcement a bunch more difficult.  Especially\nfishing expeditions without the target's knowlege.  Don't give up the\nright to be safe from that - that should be non-negotiable, and Clinton\nand Co. know it (which is probably why they quietly developed this thing,\nfiguring if they get it this far, they can ram it on through).  How come\nthose consulted could be roughly described as "us insiders"?  They cannot\nquietely IMPLIMENT it though, when they ban other schemes to ensure its\nexclusive use.  Hence the nice PR document to try and reassure everyone.\nDon't buy into it.  Has government really earned that kind of trust,\npast or future?  To be secure and free, one must keep government honest\nand the only way to do that is to make abuse IMPOSSIBLE, not 'unlikely'\nor 'difficult'.\n\n\nSo what?  One could use information gained by re-use of the keys (saved\nafter the last case was finished) or other means (master key, backdoor,\neasily broken algorithm) to find other evidence which, given to a judge,\nwould authorize a tap which wouldn't have been possible otherwise.  This\nhas been the more common manner of abuse of wiretaps in the past...  For\nlocal cops, this might be workable to keep them honest, but the Feds\nhave a workaround somehow, BET on it.  Does anyone really believe\nfor example, that the government will use a scheme NSA cannot listen\nin on scanning for keywords - either easily defeated in realtime or\nvia a 'master key'?  I sure don't.\n\nThis whole thing sounds like something to eliminate the need to use\nold-fashioned police work to build a case.  In the past, eavesdropping\nwas rather easy (with or without a court order).  I think the Law\nEnforcement community has become a bit spoiled, and will resist changes\nthat require them to revert to using old-fashioned detective work.  I\njust find it somewhat surprising coming from a bunch that cares so much\nabout civil and individual rights, that "puts people first".  The question\nis "put people first" to WHERE?\n\nWith the innards not being revealed, how is one to be sure there DOESN'T\nexist a 'master key' for use by NSA, etc (so they can do their keyword\nscan, etc on conversations they routinely monitor, without a specific\ncourt order)?   Remember, the cellular phone limitiation is only TEMPORARY.\nBet on it.  And so far I have not heard about police telling people that\nthey have been tapped and nothing incriminating was found.  What is to\nkeep them from simply keeping the keys on file for 'next time'? After\nawhile, they would have quite a collection.  Kept especially for folks\nthey deem 'disruptive'.  And if they get only one key, that would\nreduce the search space a lot, unless it is an RSA scheme.  Remember\nNixon years?  Need for court orders really slowed them down, didn't it?\n\nAnd unless the escrow accounts are not government controlled (fat chance!\nI see one ending up being under, say Treasury, the other under Justice\n:-)) it could be worth some serious bucks to some folks to get keys to\na competitor's Clinton Clipper (or descendent when this idea is expanded\nto be used for all non-government encryption).  Enough bucks would get\none the keys or the innards for this algorithm.  Perhaps not an important\nconcern, but given past government behavior and the other problems...\n\n\nWhat will one do when it is expanded to data storage encryption?  You\ncan BET that if Clipper is accepted, that will be next on the agenda.\nIt is even hinted at in the proposal - read it carefully...  Expect the\nargumet "well, if you got nothing to hide..."  Fine. Then using that\nargument, one should not object to video cameras being installed in\nevery room of one's home.  Granted - an exteme expansion of the idea but\nthe principle holds.  Private stuff should remain private, even from a\ngovt fishing expedition.  And laws/rules may change in the future as\nto 'safeguards'.  When it comes to the Fed Government, safeguards are\npretty meaningless, if they want to do/get something.\n\nDon't work so hard to give up some rather treasured rights, or establish\nbad precidents, please.  The price could be hell to pay, later.\n\n\nPeople would fight laws forbidding more NOW, but in, say two years,\nbecause we have this 'crisis' situation which MUST be addressed by some\n'drastic action', just this added reasonable restriction will only bother\nthose who have someting to hide... etc.  Please don't buy into it.\n\nIf the Clinton Clipper is so very good, why not make its algrithm public\nso many people can exchange ideas and examine it, rather than a few\nisolated 'respected experts' (respected by whom?  for what?  Perhaps a\ncertain professor who likes key banks would be one of the selected\nexperts... this does seem to expand on some ideas the person was\nadvocating, if I recall :-).  How would anybody know that what the\nexperts examine is the same as what will end up being used in the Clipper\nChip, if it is kept secret?   Perhaps the Clipper will use a crippled\nversion (with a 'master key' provision), or features not present in the\nversion subjected for study and evaluation by the experts.  And who\nchooses the expertes?  The government?  No conflict of interest there...\n:-)\n\nAnd isn't it a REQUIREMENT for any decent encryption scheme that it NOT\nhave its effectiveness reduced by having the algrorithm widely known?\nI was lead to believe that one should assume the other side has everything\nyou have, except for the key(s)... I recall ideas presented to this\ngroup are rejected if a requirement exists the algorithm be secret...\n\nAnother question - since it is a safe bet this Clipper thing would not\nbe used for government security, they are regarding it as not real secure\nbut "good enough" for common folk.  I think I would like to see a full\ndescription (not a PR non-statement) of just what "good enough" means?\nI think when saying how strong it is, "good enough" really means "not\nvery".  The excuse that other countries have these restrictions is not\nacceptable:  Other countries do not have our Bill of Rights and\nConstitution (which the people, not the governments, of those other\ncountries often regard with envy - what we have as rights they have as\nrevokable privileges).  And if we expect to retain those rights and\nprotections, we must not allow them to be gutted because we just GOTTA\nhave this thing to 'fight crime'.  We have allready have our Bill of\nRights pretty much torn to shreds.  We should not permit more weakining\nfor yet another 'noble cause', instead we should be trying to repair\nthe damage.  Our crime problem may have a number of causes, but "too\nmany rights and safeguards" is not a signifigant one.  A broken court\nsystem and poor police work are a much more signifigant cause as having\n"too many rights" (disregarding addressing the root causes for crime,\netc).\n\nBTW - those who suggest that this is just an attack on Clinton, believe\nthis:  I would be going ballistic reagardless WHO seriously proposed\nthis thing.  It is just another step in a gradual erosion of our rights\nunder the Constitution or Bill of Rights.  The last couple of decades\nhave been a non-stop series of end-runs around the protections of the\nConstitution.  It has to stop.  Now is as good a time as any, if it\nisn't too late allready.
Exactly.\n\nBut I'll add another observation: if the chip does become a standard,\nthe algorithm won't _remain_ secret.\n\nLeaving the government with the only remaining option: to make use\nof un-escrowed keys illegal. Which won't begin to bother the terrorists\nand child abusers the government is so fond of referring to.\n\nNote that the Federalist papers stress _one_ reason for the right\nof citizens to bear arms: to defend themselves _against_ the army.\n_Our_ army.\n\nIMHO the _primary_ purpose of private crypto is defend ourselves\n_against_ the government. The odd terrorist I'm not worried about;\nthe goverment damages my quality of life every day.\n\nRob

Perhaps the trusted escrow agencies can be the ones who come up with\nS1 and S2, and if these agencies are really trusted (ACLU & NRA is an\ninteresting example), we can hope that they'll use some physical\nprocess to come up with truly random numbers. If the NSA comes up with\nthe numbers, that's a trap door you could drive a truck through.\n\n\nMe either.\n\n   It seems from the following that the CPSR is atleats starting to\nquestion this bogosity:\n\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------\nApril 16, 1993\nWashington, DC\n\n               COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS CALL FOR PUBLIC\n           DEBATE ON NEW GOVERNMENT ENCRYPTION INITIATIVE\n\n        Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR)\ntoday called for the public disclosure of technical data\nunderlying the government's newly-announced "Public Encryption\nManagement" initiative.  The new cryptography scheme was\nannounced today by the White House and the National Institute\nfor Standards and Technology (NIST), which will implement the\ntechnical specifications of the plan.  A NIST spokesman\nacknowledged that the National Security Agency (NSA), the super-\nsecret military intelligence agency, had actually developed the\nencryption technology around which the new initiative is built.\n\n        According to NIST, the technical specifications and the\nPresidential directive establishing the plan are classified.  To\nopen the initiative to public review and debate, CPSR today\nfiled a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests\nwith key agencies, including NSA, NIST, the National Security\nCouncil and the FBI for information relating to the encryption\nplan.  The CPSR requests are in keeping with the spirit of the\nComputer Security Act, which Congress passed in 1987 in order to\nopen the development of non-military computer security standards\nto public scrutiny and to limit NSA's role in the creation of\nsuch standards.\n\n        CPSR previously has questioned the role of NSA in\ndeveloping the so-called "digital signature standard" (DSS), a\ncommunications authentication technology that NIST proposed for\ngovernment-wide use in 1991.  After CPSR sued NIST in a FOIA\nlawsuit last year, the civilian agency disclosed for the first\ntime that NSA had, in fact, developed that security standard.\nNSA is due to file papers in federal court next week justifying\nthe classification of records concerning its creation of the\nDSS.\n\n        David Sobel, CPSR Legal Counsel, called the\nadministration's apparent commitment to the privacy of\nelectronic communications, as reflected in today's official\nstatement,  "a step in the right direction."  But he questioned\nthe propriety of NSA's role in the process and the apparent\nsecrecy that has thus far shielded the development process from\npublic scrutiny.  "At a time when we are moving towards the\ndevelopment of a new information infrastructure, it is vital\nthat standards designed to protect personal privacy be\nestablished openly and with full public participation.  It is\nnot appropriate for NSA -- an agency with a long tradition of\nsecrecy and opposition to effective civilian cryptography -- to\nplay a leading role in the development process."\n\n        CPSR is a national public-interest alliance of computer\nindustry professionals dedicated to examining the impact of\ntechnology on society.

>say they have a "history of untrustworthy behavoir[sic]"?
Here are some ideas for those of you who want to oppose the White\nHouse Clipper chip crypto initiative.  I think this is going to be a\ntough measure to fight, since the Government has invested a lot of\nresources in developing this high-profile initiative.  They are\nserious about it now.  It won't be as easy as it was defeating Senate\nBill 266 in 1991.\n\nPossible actions to take in response:\n\n1)  Mobilize your friends to to all the things on this list, and\nmore.\n\n2)  Work the Press.  Talk with your local newspaper's science and\ntechnology reporter.  Write to your favorite trade rags.  Better yet,\nwrite some articles yourself for your favorite magazines or\nnewspapers.  Explain why the Clipper chip initiative is a bad idea. \nRemember to tailor it to your audience.  The general public may be\nslow to grasp why it's a bad idea, since it seems so technical and\narcane and innocent sounding.  Try not to come across as a flaming\nlibertarian paranoid extremist, even if you are one. \n\n3)  Lobby Congress.  Write letters and make phone calls to your\nMember of Congress in your own district, as well as your two US\nSenators.  Many Members of Congress have aides that advise them of\ntechnology issues.  Talk to those aides.\n\n4)  Involve your local political parties.  The Libertarian party\nwould certainly be interested.  There are also libertarian wings of\nthe Democrat and Republican parties.  The right to privacy has a\nsurprisingly broad appeal, spanning all parts of the political\nspectrum.  We have many natural allies.  The ACLU.  The NRA.  Other\nactivist groups that may someday find themselves facing a government\nthat can suppress them much more efficiently if these trends play\nthemselves out.  But you must articulate our arguments well if you\nwant to draw in people who are not familiar with these issues.\n\n4)  Contribute money to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and\nComputer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR), assuming\nthese groups will fight this initiative.  They need money for legal\nexpenses and lobbying.\n\n5)  Mobilize opposition in industry.  Companies that will presumably\ndevelop products that will incorporate the Clipper chip should be\nlobbied against it, from within and from without.  If you work for a\ntelecommunications equipment vendor, first enlist the aid of your\ncoworkers and fellow engineers against this initiative, and then\npresent your company's management with a united front of engineering\ntalent against this initiative.  Write persuasive memos to your\nmanagement, with your name and your colleagues' names on it.  Hold\nmeetings on it.\n\n6)  Publicize, deploy and entrench as much guerrilla\ntechno-monkeywrenching apparatus as you can.  That means PGP,\nanonymous mail forwarding systems based on PGP, PGP key servers,\netc.  The widespread availability of this kind of technology might\nalso be used as an argument that it can't be effectively suppressed\nby Government action.  I will also be working to develop new useful\ntools for these purposes. \n\n7)  Be prepared to engage in an impending public policy debate on\nthis topic.  We don't know yet how tough this fight will be, so we\nmay have to compromise to get most of what we want.  If we can't\noutright defeat it, we may have to live with a modified version of\nthis Clipper chip plan in the end.  So we'd better be prepared to\nanalyze the Government's plan, and articulate how we want it\nmodified.
One more time...\n\n    If they released the algorithm, it would be possible for someone\n    to come up with an implementation which was identical, but\n    lacking an escrowed key.\n\n    Note that the press announcement mentioned that the algorithm was\n    being kept secret for security of the key escrow system.  In this\n    case security means "an escrowed key for EVERY clipper chip".\n\n\n    Assuming you believed all that is said about the effective of\n    the algorithm, and the escrow system, which would you buy :\n\n     (a)  Chip from firm A with the escrowed key\n     (b)  Second source chip from reputable firm B with no key\n          in government escrow.
:    I've been thinking about how difficult it would be to make PGP available\n: in some form on EBCDIC machines.\n\nDon't encourage them.  Let EBCDIC machines die an honorable death :)

Sure -- only 3.8 years for each solution.\n\n   But there is a MUCH more pernicious problem with the scheme as\nproposed.  Building a brute force machine to test 2^40 possible keys\nif you have the other half from one escrow agent is EASY.  (One chip,\none test per microsecond gives you one break every two weeks, and that\nbreak gives you all messages involving that phone.)\n\n   The XOR scheme so that the files from one escrow agent gives you\nnothing is an improvement, but notice that XORing with (truely random)\nbit strings allows for an arbitrary number of escrow agents.  Using +\nfor XOR, SK for the escrowed key, and A and B for two random bit\nstrings, hand SK+A+B, SK+A, and SK+B to three escrow agents.  It is\npossible to come with an encoding scheme to match any escrow pattern,\nfor example 3 of 4, such that fewer cooperating escrow agents gives\nthe cracking agency no benefit.\n\n--\n\n					Robert I.

Assume in this case the usual canard-adversary of narcotraficantes.  They\nprobably have more cash than the KGB did, and they're probably more generous\nat handing it out.  It will be easier than ever to find or cultivate Walkers\nand Pollards for the keys, and it will be easy enough to find someone to\nreverse-engineer the chip (unless the tamper proofing is damned clever and\neffective).
The Clipper chip is just the culmination of Dorthy Denning et all.\nBut lets ignore that for the moment.\n\nThe fundamental question is:Can the government stop me from using\nencryption?\n\nIgnoring for the moment the question of patented processes (such as\nPublic Keys), can the government stop me from using an encryption\nprocess?\n\nIf the answer is yes then what freedom we have in this country is\ntruly gone and its time to get out the guns or the lawyers\n(depending upon which causes more damage and to whom).\n\nHowever assuming that I can still encrypt things as I please, who\ncares about the clipper chip? As far as I'm concerned a phone line\nis insecure PERIOD. I don't care if they encrypt it 10 ways from\nsunday, if I didn't do the encrypting, I don't trust it. This is the\nattitude that everyone else should have. Instead of worrying about a\nclipper chip, simply connect your handset to your computer and feed\nthe voice single through, process, encrypt, and transmit over the\nphone. The guy on the other hand then does the same in reverse.\n\nCan't work you say? No Standard you say? Obviously you have never\nuses PGP.\n\nAnyone who expects the government to protect their freedoms is\nkidding themselves. Only you can protect your own freedoms.\n\nOne final thought addressed to EFF:\n	1.Do you support the implementation of ANY form of\n	encryption where the encryption key must be revealed?\n	2.If you do, why? If not, why?\n	3.What SPECIFIC actions are you planning to take to either\n	support or stop this proposal?\n	4.If you do not support this proposal, what alternatives do\n	you offer?\n\n				The Jester
An excellent idea.\n\n\nWhile I don't know the full scope of the activities of the EFF, \nfrom what little I've seen I think it would be better to lobby for \nstrong cryptography through a distinct organization.\n\nThe EFF has been associated with efforts to prevent the banning of sex\nand pictures newsgroups at various universities. Horror stories about the\ncontents of those groups (e.g. exploitative pictures of possibly underaged\nmodels) have already surfaced in the press. The White House bulletin\nalready raised the specter of drug-dealing and terrorism, which is only one\nstep removed from the old "crypto-wielding child molester" argument.  An\nEFF lobbying effort for cryptography would be too easily derailed by the\nconnection to child pornography and the like.\n\nSimilarly, LPF is connected with Stallman and his Gnu project.  In\nlight of, say, the Gnu Manifesto, this means that in a public debate it\nstands to be labelled as "communist", "anarchist hackers", radical, etc.  \n\nI don't know about CPSR, but if it is an offshoot of Physicians for Social\nResponsibility (best known for Helen Caldicott and her hysterical\nantinuclear lobbying) then it probably also carries unwelcome political\nbaggage.\n\nPerhaps for practical reasons a lobbying organization for cryptography\nwould best be formed under the umbrella of EFF or some other existing\ngroup, but its charter should then be distinct, independent, and limited to\nadvocacy for the right to cryptography.  To reiterate Dan Bernstein's\nquestion: does any suitable organization exist?

Maybe I don't know enough to know what I am asking, but with millions\nof these things about, how could the algorythm possibly stay secret?\nCouldn't some clever hackers just grind the thing down layer by layer,\nand see how it worked?\n\n--

A good vocoder like ours will give you 8000 bits per second locked at\nfull rate (it's a variable rate voice activity vocoder).  If you want\nless quality, cut that to 4000 bps (half rate).  At full rate variable\nyou could put two full-duplex conversations on a V.32bis modem.  This\nrequires a DSP or ASICs, though.  An RS-6000 has a CPU that could\nprobably do it in real-time, because it has the add-and-multiply\ninstruction and a few other DSP things.\n\nIf you want to do speech in real-time you need about 4000 samples a\nsecond (for not very good voice) with your 8 bit samples (ISDN is 8000\n8-bit samples a second), which is 32 kbps.  You could do a fast 2:1\ncompression on that to get it down to 16 kbps, which is just about\nV.32bis.  The quality at this point is very bleah, but it should work.\nNow add in the time for your encryption method.  You're going to need\nsampling hardware, which is no problem on a new Mac, an Amiga.  Or a\nPC with a SoundBlaster card (just because they're so popular and cheap\n- you could also build a simple ADC).  The problem with the\nSoundBlaster is that it doesn't seem to be full duplex - you can't\nsample and play backq at the same time, making a two-way conversation\na bit tough.  The special hardware or a more capable sound card may be\nrequired.\n\nThe only thing that worries me is that 2:1 compression - the\nSoundBlaster can do it automatically in hardware, but other than that\nI don't have a good feel for how processor intensive it is, so I can't\nestimate how fast a PC you'd need.
I was wanting to ask the same question Dan Bernstein asked--how does the\nClipper chip exchange keys?  If the public key is only 80 or 160 bits long,\ndoes anyone know of any public-key schemes that are secure with that key\nsize?  (Diffie-Hellman or maybe El Gamal, with p set to a constant value?)\n   Presumably, the real scheme is something like:\n \n   1.  Exchange/verify public keys.\n   2.  Send encrypted (randomly-generated) session key.\n   3.  Encrypt / Decrypt voice trafic with some sort of fast stream cipher.\n \n   Can anyone elaborate on this, or show me what I'm missing here?

The M code stream  might be independently attacked based on knowledge of\nclipper chip protocols as revealed plaintext.  This could be invalidated\nby changing the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper M stream\nand the actual transmitted stream, under the control of a secure key\ngenerator synchronized between endpoints.\n\nThe useful life time of captured law enforcement blocks might be limited\nbased on hostile forces using them as targets following transmission\ninterception.  You would need a large number of them, but, hey there's\nsupposed to be millions of these things, right?  Adding time stamps to\nthe encrypted law enforcement block is probably impractical, who wants\nan encryption chip with a real time clock?\n\n*****************************************************************************\n\nThe entire idea of the law enforcement block can be invalidated.\n\nI just had the thought, that you could capture your own law enforcement blocks\nfor session keys K that you will not use in actual transmissions as\nthe session key authenticators.  The proviso that you don't mind your own\nserial number being discovered.\n\nd. denning just sent out further information of a new version of the clipper\nchip.	If a hash function were to be embedded in a clipper M transmission\nblock reflecting the law enforcement block, it better not fall on 64 bit block\nboundaries.  If it were a recognizeable datum, you could lie with it too.\n\nI like the randomizer inclusion in the MYK-80.  I remember reading that\nIntel had an approved random noise source on silicon, hence the ability\nto put it Inside.
I agree that notifying your elected officials of your feelings on this\n(and any other, for that matter) issue is the way to go.  And by the\nway, the phone #s on the list posted the other day were all in Washington\nD.C.  --  For most of you, your elected officials will also maintain\na local office in your area code.\n\nWhen I 'manage' my elected officials, I use their local office #'s\nexclusively, and my fax modem and windows-print-capture software are\nmy tool of choice.  They see my words as I have stated them, rather\nthan a summary as they would if I called in /voice/ and left a\ncomment with the office staff.
I have a question about digital communications encryption:\n\n	The Fact Sheet mentioned encryption/decryption microcircuitry with \nspecial "keys" for law enforcement for wire tapping purposes.\n\n	If I wanted to, couldn't I develop  encryption of my own?  That\nis, if me and a partner in crime had unique Encryption/decryption\ndevices installed before the "tappable" one, couldn't we circumvent\nthe "keys" system?  Or replace it?\n\n	I'd be really interested in knowing how the E/D microcircuits might\nbe made to prevent such befuddlement! (Laymans' Language, please! maybe a bit\ntechnical...)\n\nPlease E-mail to me, as I'm not in Net News as much as I'd like to be!\n\n\nPete\ndeuelpm@craft.camp.clarkson.edu
I suspect that this clipper thing could backfire on the Gov in a\nbig hurry. I expect that products using these chips will socket them\nrather than soldering them, since once the keys are handed over by the\nescrow agencies, the chip is so much garbage, and will need to be\nreplaced. I expect that someone will come along with a pin compatible\nchip that uses secure encryption -- possibly even disguised so that it's\nnot possible to tell it from the clipper chip until you try to use the\n2 backdoor keys.\n\n   If I were to manufacture such a chip, as part of my marketing\nstrategy, I would try to subvert one or both escrow agencies either\nthrough bribes or industrial espionage -- and then publicize the fact.\n(doing my best not to be connected with such activities -- which would\nlikely not be legal :-) Publicly discrediting the escrow agencies would\ngo quite far towards creating a market for a secure alternative.\n\n  I also believe that someone will reverse engineer the clipper chip,\nand knowlege of the algorithm will likely be fairly widespread. Any back-\ndoors or weaknesses would further discredit the scheme, and help grow\nthe market demand for a secure alternative.\n\n I believe that the company that provides such an alternative will make\nfew friends in the LE community, but lots of money. I also believe that\nthe government will do it's best to make such plug replacements illegal.\nI expect that they will see the same success in limiting the availability\nof such alternatives as they have seen in limiting the availability of\ncertain illicit drugs -- ie. little to none.
From Denning:\n\n   the Skipjack encryption algorithm\n   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips\n   N, a 30-bit serial number\n   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip\n\n   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and \n   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.  \n\nWhere the session key is K, and is transmitted encrypted in the unit Key U.\nWhich along with the serial number N is encrypted in the Family key F.\n\nPresumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else, differential\nanalysis).\n\nPostulate if you will, a chip (or logic) sitting between the clipper chip\nand its communications channel.  The function of this spoof chip is twofold:\n    \n	1) Transmit Channel\n\n	    The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with\n	    a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number\n	    unrecoverable with just the family key\n\n	2) Receive Channel\n\n	    The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number\n	    with a secondary keying variable (assuming integrity of the\n	    law enforcement block is necessary for local operation -\n	    checksums, sequence control, etc.).\n\nThis has the net result of hiding the serial number.  It is probable theere is\na known plaintext pattern used as a filler in the block containing N (34 bits\nas used in generating U, U1,U2) correctness of the law enforcement block\ncan be determined with only the family key F.  Whereas, no one has proposed\nFederal Agencies be denied F, and because they could recover it themselves,\nThe correctness of the serial number can be tested by examining the pad bits\nof N in E[N; F].\n\nThe one could selectively alter the law enforcement block as above, but the\nmutilation could be detected.  A better approach would be to mutilate the\nentire law enforcement block.  If it were done with a group encryption scheme\nsuch as DES or (presumably) Skipjack, the chances the law enforcement block\ncan be recovered are lessened.\n\nWhat do you want to bet the transmission protocol can be recognized and the\nserial numbers decrypted in a target search?  When digital transmission\nbecomes widely available, would there be a requirement that clipper protocol\ntransmissions be refused when containing mutilated law enforcement blocks?\n\nOne way to avoid notice, would be to spoof protocol information of the block\ncontaining M, as well as spoofing the law enforcement block.\n\nThe goal is to use a secure communications scheme, without redress to \ndetection or key K interception (contained encrypted within the law\nenforcement block).  The data stream is returned to its original state\nfor use by the clipper chip (or system) if required, for proper operation.\n\nIt is somewhat improbable that the entire protocol will be contained within\nthe clipper chip, yet likely that sequence of events will be tested for,\nrequiring a valid law enforcement block to be received before accepting\nand decrypting E(M; K);\n\nThe spoof chip could be implemented anywhere in the protocols, including\non the resulting serial data stream.  Existing clipper products could\nbe subborned.  After all, they are high security encryption systems right?\n\nSuper encipherment/encryption could allow the chip to be used without\nredress to detection of the use of the chip, or disclosure of the serial\nnumber.  Security must be adequate to deny the serial number, which should\nnot be recoverable by other means.  One can see the use of cut outs for\nprocurring clipper phones, or once the number of units is high enough,\nstealing them.  It would be a mistake on the part of authority, but nice\nfrom a point of privacy, if the serial number N were not associated with\na particular clipper chip or lot of chips through the manufacturing and \ndistribution process.  Hopefully the list of known missing or stolen\nclipper serial numbers N encrypted with F, and the protocols are not \nsufficient plaintext to attact the super encrypted clipper stream.\nThis could be further made difficult by altering the temporal and or\nspatial relationship of the clipper stream to that of the super encrypted\nstream.\n\nDetection of an encrypted stream could tip off the use of the aforementioned\nscheme.\n\n******************************************************************************\n\nIf you could capture valid law enforcement blocks not your own, and use\nthem in a codebook sustitution with your own, where they point to a valid\nlaw enforcement block stored in a library utilizing a session key matching\nthe remainder of the transmission, you could simply out and out lie, yet\ndeliver to monitoring and/or hostile forces a seemingly valid law enforcement\nblock.   These captured law enforcement blocks would be used as authenticators,\nsuch as in a manually keyed encryption system.  Fending this off would require\nescalation in examining the protocols and blocks in the transmission.\n\nThe M code stream  might be independently attacked based on knowledge of\nclipper chip protocols as revealed plaintext.  This could be invalidated\nby changing the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper M stream\nand the actual transmitted stream, under the control of a secure key\ngenerator synchronized between endpoints.\n\nThe useful life time of captured law enforcement blocks might be limited\nbased on hostile forces using them as targets following transmission\ninterception.  You would need a large number of them, but, hey there's\nsupposed to be millions of these things, right?  Adding time stamps to\nthe encrypted law enforcement block is probably impractical, who wants\nan encryption chip with a real time clock?\n\n*****************************************************************************
- or their handlers.\n\n\nThey key depositories are IRRELEVANT. In order for the applicable law\nenformcement agencies to be able to know what keys to request from\nescrow, the system will have to squawk its serial number in clear text\nas part of the link establishment protocol. Whoever owns the program \nthat assigns keys to each serial number won't need access to the key\ndepository.\n\nIn other words, the FBI may need a court-ordered release of escrowed\nkeys, but the NSA has the keys before the chip is ever manufactured.\nThere is no need to go through the escrow or to try all keys. While\nrelations between law enforment agencies have sometimes been strained,\nthere is also a long history of trading favors. This will re-establish\nthe NSA as a very important agency for everyone to get along with,\nbecause they can give you untraceable encryption leaks without court\norders.\n\nThe more I think about this affair, the fouler it smells.
