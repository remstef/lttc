Hello world,\n\nI want to write my Xt-application code like this:\n\n{\n    do_some_work();\n    /* now I need some user input */\n    XmCreateDialog();\n    wait_for_user_input(input);\n    if (input == "OK") {\n       more_work();\n    } else {\n       other_work();\n    }\n}\n\nSo "more_work() and other_work()" are not in callback functions but the\napplication simply waits for the user to answer the question.\n\nHow can I code this in my Xt/Motif-application?\n\nThanks very much in advance.\n\nGreetings, Huub.

Can someone help me?\n\nUnfortunately, the key event handling is pretty much hardwired into\nemacs.  I ran into this problem a while back; my solution was to\nchange the source code so that all of these special keys generated\ncharacter sequences which basically encoded the keysym and modifier\nstate as escape sequences -- for example, the sequence "ESC [ 1 B 7" \nwould indicate that the "HOME" key was pressed, with the shift key\ndown.  You could also detect standard keys with odd modifiers, such\nas "shift-Return".\n\nIf anybody wants these changes, they're welcome to them, but you'll\nhave to have the source available and be comfortable munging with\nit a bit.  Basically you have to replace the keypress handling code\nin the source file "x11term.c".  Maybe if someone at OSF is \ninterested, I can send them the tweaks, but I imagine they've got\nbigger fish to fry (hopefully including the much talked about \nemacs V19!).  If there's sufficient interest, I'll post the mods \nsomewhere, although this probably isn't the appropriate group for it.\n\nNotes: \n\n * This special code will only apply if you let emacs create\n   its own (X11) window.  If you run it in plain old tty mode (which \n   includes Xterm windows) then it's business as usual.\n\n * The patches I made were to version 18.58, under Sun OS 4.1.2\n   [I also did this a while back under HP-UX].  The patches are\n   in a chunk of code between '#if sun ... #endif' but could \n   easily be adapted for anything else.
What "it may think is right" may be exactly what the user wants.\nAssuming that your application "has reason to know better" is, IMHO,\nanti-social.  If I start your application with a -geometry option are\nyou going to ignore that as well?\n\nThere's really no way to force a window manager to do much of anything\nif it's managing your window.  You can ask, you can hint, but there's\nno guarantee that you're going to get what you want.
Hello folks,\n\nI'm seeing these errors when I try to modify my key map:\n\nmwm: invalid accelerator specfication, line x\n\nI've added a line in the start up file before the line\nthat starts mwm. It looks like the following:\n\nxmodmap keymapfile\nmwm\n\nI think that the problem has to do with a conflict between\nfunction keys F1 through F7 which already have assigned\nfunctions (e.g. Move, Minimize, etc).\n\nThe odd thing is that I don't see these errors if I run\n\nxmodmap keymapfile\n\nfrom an xterm.\n\nCan anyone suggest a way to modify the key map, specifically\nF1 through F7 AND not have mwm (Motif Window Manager) complain.\n\nI realize this is a bit stupid, but we only have time to\nimplement, not time to learn how to implement.
<I might have a need in the future to display rotated text.  I noticed the\n<"xvertext" package on the net.  It looks very good, but it has one slight\n<problem.  The API to it assumes you have a font name, not an already loaded\n<font.  It shouldn't be too difficult to split up the function into two\n<interface routines, one with a font name, and one with an XFontStruct, but\n<I thought I would ask the author (Alan Richardson\n<(mppa3@uk.ac.sussex.syma)) first in case he was planning this already.\n<Unfortunately, his email address bounced.  Does Alan R. or the current\n<maintainer of "xvertext" see this?\n\nThe e-mail address you mentioned above is for use with the U.K.  As you know,\nthe Brits do everything backwards :-)  So, the real address from the states is:\n\n	mppa3@syma.sussex.ac.uk\n\nGive it a try.
This is incorrect.  Sun has made no such claim regarding Devguide, and as \nmanager of the Devguide engineering group I can state with authority that\nwork on Devguide is continuing apace.  We had quite a strong show of interest\nfrom the Devguide user community at last week's Solaris Developer's Conference.\nDevguide is being advocated not only as a valuable future builder tool, but\nas an important bit of transition technology that will help sustain current\ncustomers and facilitate their migration to the COSE Desktop Environment.\n\nIf you have specific questions about Devguide availability, etc., you can \ncontact Tali Aben, our Devguide Product Marketing person, at (415) 336-3536.
I am considering making a reasonably large application for free\ndistribution (probably copylefted).  I am going to use X.  Now I'm\nbewildered by the huge number of "standards" that "open systems" has\ncreated.  \n\nI've lived in a fairly tookit-sheltered environment.  Most of the tools\nhere were produced with the Athena Widget set, or X Intrinsics or Xw\n(??).  \n\nIn my humble opinion, they look like crap.  I don't know, however, if\nthis is a characteristic of the tookits, or just poor aestetic taste\nin the programmers.\n\nI would like my app to look a little more "sculptured" like mwm.  I\nunderstand, however, that mwm isn't free like the other tookits.\n\nI am getting Linux, so I will have InterViews, but I don't know how it\nwill look.  I get the impression Andrew is from the FSF, but I don't\nknow what it looks like either.\n\nIf you can help explain this toolkit mess to me, I would be much\nobliged.  Which are free?  Which are the best?  Which are portable?  Which\nlooks nice?  Which is not a resource hog?\n\nAlso, if you happen to know which are available on Linux and/or Sun,\nthat would be a big help too.
I am working on a project to provide an emergency management\ninformation system.  In keeping with more classic command and\ncontrol type systems, we are considering developing a dual screen monitor\nsystem in order to provide a status board on it's own monitor.  \nI have a number of X level questions regarding this:\n\n(We are devloping on Unix systems using X/Motif. Platform will be \npredominantly Sun's, probably with ports to RS/6000 as well).\n\nI am assuming the standard dual monitor systems are configured\nsuch that we are talking about one X display and multiple screens,\nand not multiple X displays.   Given this:\n\n	- Is changing input focus from one screen to the other as simple\n	as tracking your mouse from one screen to the other?  There's\n	nothing special that needs to be done to shift focus between\n	screens?\n\n	- Do I have to run separate window managers on the separate\n	screens or are there multiscreen window managers out there?\n	What are they; who sells them...\n\n	- Is a multi-screen window manager the only way I can grab a\n	window frame and move a window from one screen to the next?\n\n	- Is there any way for the application to transparently see\n	multiple screens as one logical x-y plane, or does the hardware\n	only provide for each screen to start at 0,0?\n\n	- Any thoughts on the difficulties involved with designing a\n	system capable of using either multiple screens or a single\n	screen (perhaps running a virtual window manager to simulate\n	multiple screens instead)?  \n	I am assuming that this is not a major issue - that I can rely\n	on providing config files which will specify for each\n	configuration the screen placement of each window in the\n	application.  Any thoughts or suggestions from past experience\n	are more than welcome.
Will there be any support for round or circular widgets in Motif's next\nrelease?. I'd love to have a circular knob widget which could be used\ninstead of a slider.
Hi,\n\n  I am trying to write an X-windows based interface that runs on top of GDB. Could \nanyone help me in understanding the way we are supposed to "fork" GDB off as a \nsubprocess ?? I currently use pipes but when I try and debug this program, the \nfollowing happens :\n\nPROGRAM :\n\n	main()\n	{\n           int x;\n \n\n	   printf("enter x : ");\n           scanf("%d", &x);\n           printf("x = .%d.\n", x );\n\n        }\n\nOUTPUT :\n\n	The program hangs without returning the output of the printf statement. When I type\nin a value (like 5), then all the printf's output comes out at one time.\n\n\nIs there any other way, besides using PIPES to do this i.e., like ioctl or something else ??\n\nThanks,\n\nDeepak

Dear sun and windows people,\n\nI am running sun workstations with SunOs 4.1.1 and \nvanilla X11 R5. I have a bunch of xterminals as well.\n\nToday I had my xdm fail. At about 9:30\nit was impossible to login to a host from an xterminal.\nThe message was the "xdm too many retransmissions".\nIn my xdm-errors file I had the following entries:\n\n\n  >error (pid 7423): Server for display :0 terminated unexpectedly:\n  >256\n  >error (pid 7927): WARNING: keyboard on display :0 could not be\n  >secured\n  >error (pid 7423): Server for display :0 terminated unexpectedly:\n  >\n  >I also had:\n  >\n  >error (pid 7457): WARNING: keyboard on display :0 could not be\n  >secured\n  >error (pid 7423): Server for display :0 terminated unexpectedly:\n  >256\n  >error (pid 7462): WARNING: keyboard on display :0 could not be\n  >secured\n  >error (pid 7423): Server for display :0 terminated unexpectedly:\n  >256\n\nAlso, at the console, the login box would come up for\nabout 2 seconds and then\nit would go away. It would do this continuously.\n\nI could login from another workstation to the hosts in question,\nhowever, I could not login on the console.\n\nI tried killing xdm and restarting it but that didn't help.\nI finally rebooted all the hosts. (Which hurts when done in the\nmiddle of the day).\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nThanks,\nPhil \n-- \nPhil Neal, Systems Programmer, Statistics Department GN-22\nUniversity of Washington, Seattle, Wa. 98195 USA  | 206-685-1627
What does this have to do with my original question???  I previously\nstated that I did an XCopyArea of the depth-8 pixmap to the screen\njust to make sure that my image had data, and it did.

We have recently obtained a copy of color_xterm (from export.lcs.mit.edu) after\nseeing it mentioned in a previous article.

I just implemented this and it seems I can just about achieve the display\nrates (20 400x400x8 frames / sec on IPX) that I get with Sunview, though\nit's a bit "choppy" at times. Also, loading the data, making an XImage,\nthen XPut'ing it into a pixmap is a bit cumbersome, so the animation is\nslower to load than with Sunview. Is there a better way to load in the\ndata?\n\n\nShared memory PutImage (also mentioned by nkissebe@delphi.beckman.uiuc.edu,\nNick Kisseberth) looks interesting, but I need someone to point me to some\ndocumentation. Is this method likely to give better results than server-\nresident pixmaps? I'd also be interested in looking at the XView code\nmentioned above...\n\nThanks for the help so far. If I get something decent put together, I'll\ndefinitely post it to the Net.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------
The problem is that Motif uses XGrabKey to implement menu accelerators,\nand these grabs are specific about which modifiers apply.  Unfortunately,\nthe specification for XGrabKey doesn't allow AnyModifier to be combined\nwith other modifiers, which is exactly what would be desired in this case:\n"Ctrl Any<Key>q".\n\n\nThis is true for accelerators and mnemonics, which are implemented using\nevent handlers instead of grabs; it's not true for menu accelerators.  If\nyou're a Motif implementor, I'd suggest lobbying to get the Xlib semantics\nchanged to support the feature I described above.  Otherwise, change the\ndocumentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user's\nexpectations, because menu accelerators are NOT the same thing as\ntranslations.\n\n\nIf you mean "menu accelerator", no it's not possible.  That's according to\nthe definition of the XmNaccelerator resource in the XmLabel manual page.\n\n\nI can't think of a reason why not.\n\n\nThere is a workaround for Motif users.  In addition to the normal menu\naccelerator you install on the XmPushButton[Gadget], set an XtNaccelerators\nresource on the shell (TopLevel or Application).  Install the shell's\naccelerators on itself and all of its descendants with\nXtInstallAllAccelerators (shell, shell).\n\nFor example,\n\n  applicationShell - mainWindow - menuBar - fileCascade\n					  -- filePulldown - openPushbutton\n							  - exitPushbutton\n\n  *openPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>O\n  *openPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+O\n  *exitPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>Q\n  *exitPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+Q\n\n  *applicationShell.accelerators = #override\n\\n    Ctrl<Key>O: PerformAction(*openPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)\n\\n    Ctrl<Key>Q: PerformAction(*exitPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)\n\nYou have to write and add the application action PerformAction, which you\ncan implement by using XtNameToWidget on the first argument and then\nXtCallActionProc with the rest of the arguments.\n\nI tested out something similar to this.  To shorten development time, I\nused TeleUSE's TuNinstallAccelerators resource to install the accelerators\non the shell, and I directly invoked the Open and Quit D actions instead\nof asking the pushbuttons to do it for me, but the more general approach I\ndescribed above should work.
Even 24Bit TrueColor machines are in most cases running an emulated\n8 bit PseudoColor visual, only to get standard x clients, motif apps and\nthelike to run. I strongly suppose you to emulate at least:\n\n  should not make big misfits\n  pixel indices, conversion stuff. Furthermore, you should run your default\n  screen on this visual.

I'm about 25% of the\n    way through reading it, and it looks like a well-written\n    comprehensive treatment of system performance.

Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and\n  well written "comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions" document.\n  Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates\n  on performance.\n\n  The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with\n  regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be:\n	"Use X11R5, it is faster than R4".\n  (Please see the X FAQ for complete details).\n\n---------------\nWindow Managers\n---------------\n\n  There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different\n  features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a\n  balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this\n  point, most respondents have agreed upon "twm" as the best candidate\n  for a speedy window manager. \n\n  A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,\n  is turning off unnecessary things like "zooming" and "opaque move".\n  Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the\n  amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping\n  windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)\n\n  I've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka:\n  -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is\n  the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen)\n  and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the\n  display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted.\n\n------------\nThe X Server\n------------\n\nWhich Server?\n- - - - - - -\n  Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.\n  If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.\n\n  On my Monochrome Sun, I haven't noticed much difference between\n  the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to\n  me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute\n  to less paging.  \n         [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk),\n                        Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ]\n\n  How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law\n  (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be\n  compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.\n  You can expect to get "*very* large speedups in the server" by not\n  using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results\n  would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial\n  compilers on the market.\n\nLocking the Server into RAM?\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n  Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and\n  does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help\n  performance at all?  I've had one inquiry on this topic, and a few\n  pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone\n  who's tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try.  \n			  [thanks to: Eric C Claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com),\n				      Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be),\n				      Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ]\nStarting your Server\n- - - - - - - - - - -\n  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :\n    If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep\n    for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my\n    .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time...\n    we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.\n\n  This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!  \n\n  Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of\n  why this works, which I have summarized here:\n\n    When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to\n    start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by\n    the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of\n    pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the\n    server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you\n    put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself\n    sorted out before the clients start up.\n\n    Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X\n    client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources\n    being fetched, programs initializing state and "databases" and so\n    forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this\n    initialization is done ("The process has reached a steady state"),\n    the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.\n    By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your\n    .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your\n    workstation's limited resources\n\n  This is most definitely a "Your Mileage May Vary" situation, as there\n  are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap\n  space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients\n  you are starting, etc.\n\n  Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like:\n	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\n	(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &\n	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n\n  I've experimented with:\n	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\n	(sleep 2; exec xbiff ) &\n	(sleep 3; exec xterm ) &\n	(sleep 4; exec xterm ) &\n\n  I've even tried:\n	(sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &\n  and then in start_X_clients_script I had:\n	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\n	(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &\n	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n\n    [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had\n    completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down\n    into a "steady state" before the sleep expired and all my clients\n    were launched. ]\n\n  All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with\n  my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to\n  experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.\n\nFonts\n- - -\n  Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts\n  your applications use, you'll get speed increases in load-up time.\n\n  One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one\n  large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or\n  at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.\n  Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded\n  into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer\n  fonts will be loaded by the server.\n			      [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au),\n			        Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ]\n\n  eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13\n  in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since\n  I don't normally use 8x13, I've eliminated one font from my server.\n\n  Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com):\n    Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.\n    If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server.\n\nAbout the Resources File\n- - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n    Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves\n    on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)\n\n  One suggestion:\n\n    In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum\n    number of resources that you want to have available to all of your\n    applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true\n\n    Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific\n    resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your\n    .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH:\n\n	setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N\n\n    [ The "comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions" FAQ contains\n    an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.\n    --ed.]\n\n    So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from\n    .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,\n    and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same\n    XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system\n    app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to\n    find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files\n    with the same name.\n\n    This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666).\n		    [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com),\n		         Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov),\n		             and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu).\n	     Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]\n\n  This method of organizing your personal resources has the following\n  benefits:\n\n    - Easier to maintain / more usable.\n\n    - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER\n      property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally\n      quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.\n\n    - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort \n      through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.\n\n  It also has drawbacks:\n\n    - the application that you are interested in has to load an\n      additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to\n      make that much of a performance difference, and you might\n      consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an\n      application's resource database, you just need to re-run the\n      application without having to "xrdb" again.\n\n    - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When\n      your resources are split out into multiple resource files and\n      then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.\n      WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!\n\n      I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped\n      out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource\n      files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why\n      my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*\n      provide any error message when it encountered the C style\n      comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted\n      processing the resource file.\n\n      The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef\n      COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this\n      method of resource management.\n\n    - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For\n      example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their\n      resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.\n\n    - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files\n      with the machine where your resources are stored, your client\n      will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the\n      server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find\n      their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)\n\n  A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)\n  is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my\n  .Xdefaults file, and to use the "separate resources files" method for\n  clients that I seldom use.\n\nDefine Your Display Properly\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n  Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In\n  that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to \n  "<hostname>:0.0", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you\n  should set your DISPLAY variable to "unix:0.0" or ":0.0".  By doing this\n  you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same\n  machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.\n			[thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)]\n\n  See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further\n  explanation of how to properly set your display name.\n\n  "I don't think it's stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have\n  libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when\n  the DISPLAY isn't set specially."\n			      Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET)\n\n  [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change\n  stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set.\n  I don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle\n  non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.  Hopefully MIT\n  will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.  In the meantime, if\n  you want to try it yourself, email Jody.  --ed.]\n\n-------\nClients\n-------\n\n  If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think\n  carefully about the number of programs you are running.  Think also\n  about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there\n  a smaller clock program than xclock?\n\n  Unfortunately, I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large\n  they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.\n\n  [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients\n  (eg: Xclock, Xterm, Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.]\n\n  I've received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject\n  of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are\n  strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather\n  large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using\n  may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In\n  this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually\n  _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.\n\n  The upshot of all this seems to be: Don't mix toolkits.  That is, try\n  and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif\n  clients, etc).  If you use more than one, then you're dragging in\n  more than one toolkit library.\n\n  Know your environment, and think carefully about which client\n  programs would work best together in that environment.\n\n		  [Thanks to: Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET),\n      Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk | sinclair@uk.ac.gla.dcs) ]\n\nA Better Clock for X\n- - - - - - - - - - -\n\n1) xcuckoo\n   suggested by: Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk)\n   available: on export.lcs.mit.edu\n\n   Xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of *another* program.\n   Saves screen real estate.\n\n2) mclock\n   suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU)\n   available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in /X/mclock.shar\n\n   Non Xt-based.

[ Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com),\n		   Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) ]\n\n1) Xvt\n   suggested by: Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) :\n   available: export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/xvt-1.0.tar.Z\n\n   "...if you don't need all the esoteric features of xterm, then get\n   hold of xvt ...  it was written here just to save swap space as\n   xterm is rather a hog! "\n\n   This was written as a partial 'clone' of xterm.  You don't have to\n   rename your resources, as xvt pretends to be XTerm.  In it's current\n   version, you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm.  I've heard that\n   there are versions of xvt with this feature, but I've not found any\n   yet.\n\n   UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with\n   Brian Warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt.  He\n   questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For\n   instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling\n   speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap\n   bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also, while xterm\n   may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don't have any hard\n   numbers here, does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text\n   segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major.\n\n   As an experiment, he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm, but it\n   made little difference, since if you never use it, it never gets\n   brought into memory.\n\n   So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of\n   xvt over xterm.  In summary?

Examining the what was\n    going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource\n    XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget\n    (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink.\n    Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the\n    widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user\n    can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not\n    noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference\n    on a [slower system].\n\n  This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots\n  of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor\n  embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server\n  requests?\n\n-------------------------\nMiscellaneous Suggestions\n-------------------------\n\nPretty Pictures\n- - - - - - - -\n  Don't use large bitmaps (GIF's, etc) as root window backgrounds.\n\n  - The more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server\n    is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc)\n\n  - These take up RAM, and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm\n    conscious of performance issues, I can't comprehend it when I see\n    people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window.\n\n    I'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by\n    having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.\n\n  - If you're anything like me, you need all the screen real estate\n    that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway.\n\n		      [ Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu) \n			for reminding me of this one. --ed.]\n\nA Quicker Mouse\n- - - - - - - -\n  Using xset, you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen\n  when you move your mouse.  I use "xset m 3 10" in my .xinitrc file,\n  which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of\n  the wrist.  See the xset man page for further ideas and information.\n\n  Hint: sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for\n  fine work.  To cover my options, I have placed a number of different\n  mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager.  \n\n  e.g. (for twm) :\n      menu "mouse settings" {\n        "Mouse Settings:"			f.title\n	"  Very Fast"				! "xset m 7 10 &"\n	"  Normal (Fast)"			! "xset m 3 10 &"\n	"  System Default (Un-Accelerated)"	! "xset m default &"\n	"  Glacial"				! "xset m 0 10 &"\n      }\n\nProgramming Thoughts\n- - - - - - - - - - -\n  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :\n    To speed up applications that you're developing, there are tons of\n    things you can do.  Some that stick out:\n\n    - For Motif programs, don't set XmFontList resources for individual\n      buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or\n      labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager\n      widget.  Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.\n\n    - Better yet, don't use Motif at all.  It's an absolute pig.\n\n    - Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them.\n      (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)\n\n    - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE\n      difference.\n\n    - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the\n      difference between a fast application and a completely unusable\n      one.\n\n  Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) :\n    Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc\n    function would greatly increase performance of Xt based\n    applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying\n    out the GNUY malloc, but I didn't find the time yet. I did some\n    tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the\n    differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)\n\n  [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.]\n\n  Andre' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) :\n\n  - Unnecessary NoExpose Events.\n\n    Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines, but\n    they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the\n    blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most\n    cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to\n    run through it's event-loop again and again.\n\n  - Thousands of XChangeGC requests.\n\n    This "Gfx Context Switching" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps,\n    where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed\n    again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching\n    and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will\n    remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the\n    connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).\n\nSay What!?\n- - - - - - \n  Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first:\n\n  David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org, by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) :\n    How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs\n    on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your\n    machine onto the other display. Goal: reduce context switches in the\n    same operation between client and server.\n\n  I'm not in a situation where I can easily try this, but I have received\n  the following confirmation...\n\n  Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se):\n    I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big\n    difference. I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage\n    and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. This\n    helps a lot on my poor little SS1+ with only 16 MB, it was\n    essential when I only had 8 MB.\n\n  Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) :\n    [The X11 Server and the client are] competing for the same CPU as\n    your server when you run it on the same machine.  Not really a\n    major problem, except that the X11 client and the server are in\n    absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing.\n\n  Timothy H Panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) :\n    Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU's are mostly idle, X's\n    cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate\n    doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they\n    are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your\n    action.\n\n    The second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2\n    cpu's halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going\n    over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved\n    buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing\n    even fewer context switches.\n\n----------------------------\nOther Sources of Information\n----------------------------\n\n  Volume 8 in O'Reilly's X Window System Series, ``X Window System\n  Administrator's Guide'' is a book all X administrator's should read.\n\n  Adrian Nye (adrian@ora.com):\n    A lot more tips on performance are in the paper "Improving X\n    Application Performance" by Chris D.

I am trying to build and use imake (X11R4) on an IBM RS/6000 running AIX V3.2.\nI am having the following 2 problems.\n\n(1) Many of my Imakefile's have contructs like\n		/**/#This is a makefile\n	at the start of lines to pass Makefile comments thru the C\n	preprocessor and into the Makefile.  Most of the C preprocessors that\n	I have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the\n	line.  Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the\n	start of a directive. \n\n	However the IBM cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol\n	as the start of a directive.  The cpp fails when it determines\n	that "This" is not a known directive.  I have temporarily hacked my\n	imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better\n	fix.\n\n(2) Several Imakefiles use /**/ as a parameter to a macro when a particular\n	use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter.  The AIX cpp\n	gives warnings about these situations but continues to work OK.\n\nIf you are familiar with these problems and have solutions, I would appreciate\ninformation about on your solutions.  (Perhaps, this is solved in a later\nversion of imake that I have not reviewed.)  Also, do you know of other cpp's\nthat behave similarly?

According to the OSF/Motif Style Guide, one should use cursor shapes to give\nthe user a visual clue of what is happening or what is expected of him. So\na "hourglass" cursor should be shown when the application is busy, or a\n"caution" cursor should be shown over an area when input is expected in\nanother. Defining cursors for widgets has to be done at rather low level.\nSo defining a cursor for all widgets in an application but not for a certain\nsubpart of it, is a rather complicated matter. When cursors have been defined\nfor some windows, e.g. a "crosswire" cursor for a DrawingArea, things get even\nmore complicated. My intuition says that things should be easier, but is this\nso? If anyone has a solid and complete solution to my problem, please let me\nknow. The topics on "busy cursors" in the several FAQ's are not helpful, since\nthey only work for applications where all windows have the cursor window\nattribute set to 'None'.
1. You need these resources :\n	XTerm*EightBitInput:    true\n	XTerm*EightBitOutput:    true\n\n2. In the shell you need to do : \n        stty cs8 -istrip \n\n\nGood luck .\nVictor .
Can someone point me in the direction of any papers (not necessarily\nformally conducted studies) discussing how much traffic X apps generate\nfor the network, particularly in comparison with curses-bases apps \nover telnet?  Also, does an X server typically buffer up user keyboard\ninput a line at a time?  Can the X client control this, asking for\nkeystrokes immediately?  Thanks in advance for any feedback!
Hi Folks,\n\nDoes anybody know where I can find the "Color" bitmap editor\naround the public sites? Any information I do appreciate that.
I don't know if there's a corresponding patch for Solaris 2.1, but this\nsounds like the following bug which is supposedly fixed in 100492-06, the\nSolaris 1.x olwm Jumbo patch:\n\n	1108642 - window system can hang in an errant pointer grab\n\nActually, I suspect that the OW 3.1 problem may be different, since the\nREADME file says that this patch is just a SunOS 4.x version of the OW 3.1\nolwm (but maybe that line came from an earlier version of the patch, and\nthey forgot to take it out in the -06 version).\n-- \nBarry Margolin\nSystem Manager, Thinking Machines Corp.
Does anyone know what is available in terms of automated testing\nof X/Motif applications. I am thinking of a system which I could\nprogram (or which could record events/output) with our verification\ntest procedures and then run/rerun each time we do regression\ntesting. I am interested in a product like this for our UNIX\nprojects and for a separate project which will be using OpenVMS.
Forgive me if this is a FAQ (I have checked the list but I cant find it).\n\nI have a problem with the cursor within Xterm on MONO (not grayscale monitors)\nThe problem is that when I have an character application that displays input\nfields in reverse video the Xterm text cursor gets lost on the edge of the\ninput field.\n\nThe solution would appear to be to set the xterm cursor to a line rather\nthan a block, but how do you do this. I can't find any means although\nvarious sources seem to indicate it can be done.\n\nWhen the xterm loses the input focus the cursor becomes an outlined block.\nThis would also be preferable but I can't seem to force this to be the\ndefault either.\n\nConfiguration is  : Motorola 88K X11R4\n\nPlease reply by email if poss.\n\nThank you\n\n\n\n--\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteve Weet - European Mis - Motorola Cellular Subscriber Group\nBeechgreen Court, Chineham, Basingstoke, HANTS England.\nPhone : +44 (0)256 790154  E-Mail  stevew@chineham.euro.csg.mot.com\nFax   : +44 (0)256 817481  Mobile  : +44 (0)850 335105  Post : w10075\n\n\n\n\n--
This design will work but I don't think it can take easily take advantage\nof expose event redraw optimization; that is, the whole window will be\nredrawn, not just the area with the new item.

At Robert Gordon University, programming was the main (most time-consuming) \nstart of the course. The first two years consisted of five subjects:\nSoftware Engineering (Pascal/C/UNIX), Computer Engineering (6502/6809/68000 \nassembler), Computer Theory (LISP/Prolog), Mathematics/Statistics and \nCommunication Skills (How to pass interviews/intelligence tests and group\ndiscussions e.g. How to survive a helicopter crash in the North Sea).\nThe third year (Industrial placement) was spent working for a computer company \nfor a year. The company could be anywhere in Europe (there was a special \nTravel Allowance Scheme to cover the visiting costs of professors).  \nThe fourth year included Operating Systems(C/Modula-2), Software Engineering \n(C/8086 assembler), Real Time Laboratory (C/68000 assembler) and Computing \nTheory (LISP).  There were also Group Projects in 2nd and 4th Years, where \nstudents worked in teams to select their own project or decide to work for an \noutside company (the only disadvantage being that specifications would change \nsuddenly).\n \nIn the first four years, there was a 50%:50% weighting between courseworks and \nexams for most subjects. However in the Honours year, this was reduced to a \n30%:70% split between an Individual Project and final exams (no coursework \nassessment) - are all Computer Science courses like this?\n\nBTW - we started off with 22 students in our first year and were left with 8 by\nHonours year. Also, every course is tutored separately. Not easy trying\nto sleep when you are in 8 student class :-). \n\nCheers,\n  Michael
Hi there netters,\n\nI require a window to appear at a co-ordinates (0,0) (top left corner) of my\nscreen (root window). Could some windows guru out there help me on how to\ngo about doing this. I write the whole program which creates the window with\nthe image it displays - I require the image to appear at the top-left corner\nso that I can grab it for recording on to video, using a MIniVas controller,\nwhich expects the window at the same spot every time.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nsincerely,\n\nSanjeev Sharma
I think the original post was searching for existing implementations of\nf.i. Gouroud-shading of triangles. This is fairly complex to do with plain\nX. Simpler shading models are implemented already, f.i. in x3d (ask archie\nwhere to get the latest version).\nFor Gouroud, a fast implementation will be possible utilizing some extension\nonly, either MIT-SHM to do the shade in an image and fast update the window\nwith it, or PEX/OpenGL which should be able to shade themselves. The portable\n'vanilla X' way would be to shade in a normal XImage and use XPutImage(),\nwhat would be good enough to do static things as f.i. fractal landscapes\nor such stuff.\n\nTo speak about POVRay, the X previewer that comes with the original source\npackage is not that good, especially in speed, protocol-friendlyness and\nICCCM compliance. Have a look on x256q, my own preview code. It is on\n\n141.76.1.11:pub/gfx/ray/misc/x256q/\n\nThe README states the points where it is better than xwindow.c from\nPOVRay 1.0
Have you set the foreground and background colors in w_gc1 to \nsomething other than 0 and 1?  The WhitePixel and BlackPixel macros\non your server may not return values suitable for depth 1 drawables.\n\n\n\nAre you sure that the fifth plane of the data isn't all the same?  You could\nhave different pixel values in the image, but the fifth plane (0x10 == 16)\nmight all be the same value?\n\n\n\n\nIf you just want to see the plane of data and want better performance,\ndon't use ClipMasks, just use pixmap1 as the stipple in a stippled\nrectangle fill.  Many servers are very stupid about handling complex\nclip lists, and turn a bitmap clip region into hundreds and hundreds of\nlittle clipping rectangles, and clips every drawing primitive against every\none of these little triangles.\n\n\nActually, I must also ask the FAQ's #1 most popular reason why graphics\ndon't show up: do you wait for an expose event before drawing your\nrectangle?
I believe it's XtVaAppInitialize or something like that.\n\n--
I've been using the xrpc package for about a year now.  I believe I got it from\nexport.
(2nd posting of the question that just doesn't seem to get answered)\n\nSuppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that contains\nXlib graphics.  A button widget, when pressed, will cause a new item\nto be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea() \n(or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new\nitem in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles\n"regular" expose events (e.g. window manager-driven exposures) take care\nof rendering the new image.  Using an expose event handler is a "proper" way\nto do this because at the time the handler is called, the Xlib Window is\nguaranteed to be mapped.\n\nThe problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window\nis already visible and mapped.  What we need to do is somehow "tickle" the\nWindow so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable\nit to render *just* the part of the window that contains the new item.

QUESTION:\n  What is the EXACT entry (parameter and syntax please), in the X-Terminal\nconfiguration file (loaded when the X-Terminal boots), to add another system \nto the TCP/IP access control list?   \n\n  BACKGROUND:\n  I have two unix systems, 1. an AT&T 3B2 running X11R3 and MIT's X11R4 and \n2. a Sun SS10 without any X.  \n  I want to have a window to the Sun and the 3B2 on the NCD X-Terminal at the\nsame time.  I can do this if I manually set the Network Parameter TCP/IP\nAccess Control List to off, then login to my telnet session. Not Great!  \n  I've tried to get "xhost" to work and failed.  Either my syntax is wrong\nor the X11R3 implementation is bogus.  \n  I am trying to edit the NCD configuration file that is loaded when the \nNCD boots.  No matter what entry I add or edit, the NCD still boots with\nthe TCP/IP Access Control list containing only the 3B2.\n  My manuals are worthless so any help would be most appreciated!!  Thanks!

Xt Glossary\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\no The Xt Intrinsics implement an object oriented interface to C code\n  to allow useful graphical components to be created.  Included with\n  this are classes that provide the base functionality: Object,\n  RectObj, Core, Composite, Constraint, Shell, OverrideShell, WMShell,\n  etc.  The terms "Xt" and "Intrinsics" are used interchangeably,\n  however, they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the X\n  window system.  In particular, it does not include the Athena,\n  Motif, OLIT or any other widget set.  Without further widgets the\n  Intrinsics are not especially useful.\n\no A widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via Xt.  The\n  precise use, is any object that is a subclass of the Core class.  It\n  is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the\n  Object class although these are more accurately called windowless\n  widgets or gadgets.\n\no Xlib is the C interface to the X11 protocol.  It is one layer below\n  the Xt Intrinsics.  Typically a widget uses relatively few Xlib\n  functions because Xt provides most such services although an\n  understanding of Xlib helps with problems.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.  Software Versions\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following are the latest versions of Xt based software:\n        _____________________________________________________________\n	Software	Version		Released	Next Expected\n        _____________________________________________________________\n	X11R4		patch 18			(none)\n	X11R5		patch 21	12/18/92	??\n	Athena Widgets	(see X11R5)\n	Motif		1.2.1		9/92		??\n	OLIT		??		??		??\n	Xtra		2.5		6/15/92		??\n	Xw		X11R4				(none)\n	Xcu		X11R5				(none)\n	fwf		3.4		1/11/92		4/93\n        _____________________________________________________________\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n2.  Related FAQ's\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nDavid B. Lewis (uunet!craft!faq) maintains the FAQ on X.  It\nis posted monthly on comp.windows.x and located on export in contrib/FAQ.\n\nLiam R. E. Quin (lee@sq.sq.com) posts an FAQ list on Open Look to \ncomp.windows.x.  \n\nJan Newmarch (jan@pandonia.canberra.edu.au) posts an FAQ list on Motif \nto comp.windows.x.motif.\n\nPeter Ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) posts an FAQ list for\ncomp.windows.x.intrinsics; it is on export in contrib/FAQ-Xt.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n3.  Why does my application core dump when I use signals/alarms/cthreads?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn brief, Xlib, Xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for\ncritical sections.  Any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of\nthe above libraries in an inconsistent state -- such as all the\nappropriate flags not yet set, dangling pointers, in the middle of a\nlist traversal, etc.  Note that the ANSI C standard points out that\nbehavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls\nany function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem\nspecific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other\nfunctions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that\nthese functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions.\n\nThe only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the\ninterrupt handler.  This flag later needs to be checked either by a\nwork procedure or a timeout callback.  It is incorrect to add either\nof these in the interrupt handler.  As another note, it is dangerous\nto add a work procedure that never finishes.  This effectively\npreempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never\nbe called.  Another option is to open a pipe, tell the event loop\nabout the read end using XtAppAddInput() and then the signal handler\ncan write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal.\nHowever, this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up.\n\nWhy don't the Intrinsics deal with this problem?  Primarily because it\nis supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating\nsystem.   Is that a good enough reason -- I don't think so.\n\n        Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly\nVolume 6 are in error.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n4.  How do I use a different visual than the default?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis requires a more complicated answer than it should.  A window has\nthree things that are visual specific -- the visual, colormap and\nborder pixmap.  All widgets have their own Colormap and BorderPixmap\nresource; only shell widgets have Visual resources (another questions\ndeals with why shells have a Visual).  The default value of these\nresources is CopyFromParent which does exactly what it says.  In the\nshell widget CopyFromParent gets evalulated as DefaultVisualOfScreen\nand DefaultColormapOfScreen.  When any one of the three resources is\nnot properly set, a BadMatch error occurs when the window is\ncreated.  They are not properly set because each of the values depends\non the visual being used.  \n\nHow to get this to work?  There are two parts to the answer.  The\nfirst is if you want an application to start with a particular visual\nand the second is if you want a particular shell within an application\nto start with a different visual.  The second is actually easier\nbecause the basic information you need is available.  The first is a\nlittle harder because you'll need to initialize much of the toolkit\nyourself in order to determine the needed information.\n\n/*\n * Some sample code to start up an application using something other\n * than the default visual.\n *\n * To compile:\n *	cc -g visual.c -o visual -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11 -lm\n *\n * To run:\n *	./visual -geometry 300x300 -depth 24 -visual StaticColor -fg blue -bg yellow\n *\n * you need to move the mouse to get the particular visuals colormap\n * to install.\n */\n\n#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>\n#include <X11/StringDefs.h>\n#include <X11/Shell.h>\n\ntypedef struct\n{\n	Visual	*visual;\n	int	depth;\n} OptionsRec;\n\nOptionsRec	Options;\n\nXtResource resources[] =\n{\n	{"visual", "Visual", XtRVisual, sizeof (Visual *),\n	XtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, visual), XtRImmediate, NULL},\n	{"depth", "Depth", XtRInt, sizeof (int),\n	XtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, depth), XtRImmediate, NULL},\n};\n\nXrmOptionDescRec Desc[] =\n{\n	{"-visual", "*visual", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL},\n	{"-depth", "*depth", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL}\n};\n\n\n\nint\nmain (argc, argv)\n	int		argc;\n	char		**argv;\n{\n	XtAppContext	app;		/* the application context */\n	Widget		top;		/* toplevel widget */\n	Display		*dpy;		/* display */\n	char		**xargv;	/* saved argument vector */\n	int		xargc;		/* saved argument count */\n	Colormap	colormap;	/* created colormap */\n	XVisualInfo	vinfo;		/* template for find visual */\n	XVisualInfo	*vinfo_list;	/* returned list of visuals */\n	int		count;		/* number of matchs (only 1?) */\n	Arg		args[10];\n	Cardinal	cnt;\n	char		*name = "test";\n	char		*class = "Test";\n\n	/*\n	 * save the command line arguments\n	 */\n\n	xargc = argc;\n	xargv = (char **) XtMalloc (argc * sizeof (char *));\n	bcopy ((char *) argv, (char *) xargv, argc * sizeof (char *));\n\n	/*\n	 * The following creates a _dummy_ toplevel widget so we can\n	 * retrieve the appropriate visual resource.\n	 */\n	cnt = 0;\n	top = XtAppInitialize (&app, class, Desc, XtNumber (Desc), &argc, argv,\n			       (String *) NULL, args, cnt);\n	dpy = XtDisplay (top);\n	cnt = 0;\n	XtGetApplicationResources (top, &Options, resources,\n				   XtNumber (resources),\n				   args, cnt);\n	cnt = 0;\n	if (Options.visual && Options.visual != DefaultVisualOfScreen (XtScreen (top)))\n	{\n		XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNvisual, Options.visual); ++cnt;\n		/*\n		 * Now we create an appropriate colormap.

Which visual should an application use?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there is\nno way for an application to know the appropriate visual -- it has to\nbe specified by the user.  If you disagree with this then your\napplication probably falls into the category of always using the\ndefault visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particular\nvisual such as 24bit TrueColor with an OverlayPlane extension (or some\nsuch).\n\nWhy?  No application runs in isolation.  Depending on the way a server\nallocates resources I may not always want your application to run in\nTrueColor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications.  I may\nbe very upset if it chooses to run in GreyScale instead of PsuedoColor\nor just monochrome.\n\nAs an example, on a low end color Sun server there are many different\npossible visuals: monochrome, 256 entry colormap, static gray, static\ncolor, and a 3/3/2 TrueColor.  The SGI Iris's offer all the above \nplus 12 bit TrueColor, 24 bit TrueColor, an Overlay Plane.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n6.  Why do only Shell widgets have a Visual?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is strictly by convention.  It makes it possible for an arbitrary\nwidget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for the\nshell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of that\nshell.\n\nA widget can have its own visual resource.  If it does, it must have\nits own realize method to use the visual when it calls\nXCreateWindow().  You should also make this a resource that can be\nobtained with XtGetValues() so other widgets can find it.  A\nreasonable value is probably XtNvisual.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n7.  Which visual, depth and colormap do Shells inherit?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe default value for these resources are set to CopyFromParent.  This\nis interpreted as the DefaultColormapOfScreen(), DefaultDepthOfScreen()\nand the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent -- i.e.\nit is an applicationShellWidgetClass and the root of your widget tree.\n\nIf the parent of the widget is not null, then the shell copies\ncolormap and depth from its parent and uses CopyFromParent as the\nvisual.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n8.  I've done all the above and I still get a BadMatch error.  Why?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSome resource converters improperly cache references.  This was\nespecially true of X11R3 and earlier versions of Motif.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n9.  Why doesn't my widget get destroyed when I call XtDestroyWidget()?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSee section 2.8 of the Xt specification.\n\nIt eventually does get destroyed, just not immediately.  The\nIntrinsics destroy a widget in a two-phase process.  First it and all\nof its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed.\nIt is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed.  This way any\npending X events or further references to that widget can be cleaned\nup before the memory is actually freed.  The second phase is then\nperformed after all callbacks, event handlers, and actions have\ncompleted, before checking for the next X event.  At this point the\nlist is traversed and each widget's memory is actually free()'d, among\nother things.\n\nAs some further caveats/trivia, the widgets may be destroyed if the\nIntrinsics determine that they have no further references to the\nwidgets on the list.  If so, then the phase 2 destruction occurs\nimmediately.  Also, if nested event loops are used, widgets placed on\nthe destroy list before entering the inner event loop are not\ndestroyed until returning to the outer event loop.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n10. How do I exit but still execute the DestroyCallbacks?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exiting\nan application is used, such as calling exit() directly, then a widget\nmay not have a chance to clean up any external state -- such as open\nsockets, temporary files, allocated X resources, etc.  (this code for\nsimplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget):\n\n\n	Widget\n	ToplevelGet (gw)\n		Widget		gw;		/* widget to find toplevel */\n	{\n		Widget		top;\n\n		for (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))\n			/* empty */;\n		return (top);\n	}\n\n	void\n	ExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)\n		Widget		gw;		/* widget */\n		XtPointer	closure;	/* data the app specified */\n		XtPointer	call_data;	/* widget specific data */\n	{\n		Widget		toplevel;\n\n		toplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);\n		XtUnmapWidget (toplevel);	/* make it disappear quickly */\n		XtDestroyWidget (toplevel);\n		exit (0);\n	}\n\nOne can see that the above code exit's immediately after destroying\nthe toplevel widget.  The trouble is the phase 2 destruction may never\noccur.  \n\nThis works for most widgets and most applications but will not work\nfor those widgets that have any external state.  You might think that\nsince it works now it will always work but remember that part of the\nreason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorant\nof the implementation details for each widget.  Which means that the\nwidget may change and someday require that some external state is\ncleaned up by the Destroy callbacks.\n\nOne alternative is to modify ExitCallback() to set a global flag and\nthen test for that flag in a private event loop.  However, private\nevent loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy, and\ndifficult to maintain practices.\n\nTry the following code instead.\n\n	#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>\n\n	extern Widget ToplevelGet (\n	#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\n		Widget		gw\n	#endif\n	);\n\n	extern Boolean ExitWorkProc (\n	#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\n		XtPointer	closure\n	#endif\n	);\n\n	extern void ExitCallback (\n	#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\n		Widget		gw,\n		XtPointer	closure,\n		XtPointer	call_data\n	#endif\n	);\n\n	Widget\n	ToplevelGet (gw)\n	Widget		gw;		/* widget to find toplevel */\n	{\n		Widget		top;\n\n		for (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))\n			/* empty */;\n		return (top);\n	}\n\n\n	void\n	ExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)\n	Widget		gw;		/* widget */\n	XtPointer	closure;	/* data the app specified */\n	XtPointer	call_data;	/* widget specific data */\n	{\n		Widget		toplevel;\n\n		toplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);\n		XtUnmapWidget (toplevel);	/* make it disappear quickly */\n		XtDestroyWidget (toplevel);\n		XtAppAddWorkProc (XtWidgetToApplicationContext (gw),\n				  ExitWorkProc, (XtPointer) NULL);\n	}\n\n	Boolean\n	ExitWorkProc (closure)\n		XtPointer	closure;\n	{\n		exit (0);\n		/*NOTREACHED*/\n	}\n\n\nExitCallback() adds a work procedure that will get called when the\napplication is next idle -- which happens after all the events are\nprocessed and the destroy callbacks are executed.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n11. How do I resize a Shell widget?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter it is realized, one doesn't resize a Shell widget.  The proper\nthing is to resize the currently managed child of the Shell widget\nusing XtSetValues().  The geometry change is then propagated to the\nShell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow the\nrequest.  However, the Shell must have the resource\nXtNallowShellResize set to True otherwise it will not even ask the\nwindow manager to grant the request and the Shell will not resize.\n\nTo change the position of a Shell, use XtSetValues() on the Shell, not\nthe child, and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n12. Why can't XtAppAddInput() handle files?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt does, however Unix semantics for when I/O is ready for a file does\nnot fit most peoples' intuitive model.  In Unix terms a file\ndescriptor is ready for reading whenever the read() call would not\nblock, ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not to\nblock.  This works as expected for terminals, sockets and pipes.  For\na file the read() will always return but the return indicates an EOF\n-- i.e. no more data.  The result is the code in the Intrinsics always\ncalls the input handler because it always thinks something is about to\nbe read.  The culprit is the select() system call or on SYSV based\nOS's it is the poll() system call.\n\nHow to get around this on a Unix system?  The best approach is to use\nanother process to check for available input on the file.  Use a pipe\nto connect the application with this other process and pass the file\ndescriptor from the pipe to XtAppAddInput().  A suitable program on\nBSD systems is "tail -f filename".\n\nIt's rumored that select() on some systems is not _completely_\nreliable.  In particular:\n\n	- IBM AIX 3.1: this is one where it would work for a while\n	  (several thousand times) and then stop until some other\n	  event woke it up. This seemed to be the result of a race\n	  condition in the Kernel.  IBM claims to have a fix for this.\n\n	- Pyramid, doesn't work at all.\n\n	- Ultrix (and possibly others where pipes are implemented as\n	  sockets), wasn't completely broken, but although the writing\n	  side wrote in 512 byte blocks the reading side received it\n	  all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at\n	  a time.  You can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks\n	  (get raound it by detecting the situation and having\n	  select() ignore the pipe for 10 mseconds - by then it had\n	  been given the whole block).\n\n\nNote that all the above descriptions used Unix terminology such as\nread(), file descriptor, pipes, etc.  This is an OS dependent area and\nmay not be identical on all systems.  However the Intrinsic designers\nfelt it was a common enough operation that it should be included with\npart of the toolkit.  Why they didn't also deal with signals at this\npoint I don't know.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n13. What good books and magazines are there on Xt?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have a favorite that is the definitive reference.  To my perspective\nit offers a reasonable introduction but also goes into the full\ndetails of the Intrinsics.  When I started using it I was already\nfamiliar with Xt and the concepts behind it, so newcomers may or may\nnot find it useful.  I've always found it accurate and complete, which\nmeans its a 1000 pages.\n\nAsente, Paul J., and Swick, Ralph R., "X Window System Toolkit, The\n	Complete Programmer's Guide and Specification", Digital Press,\n	1990, ISBN 1-55558-051-3, order number EY-E757E-DP; and by\n	Prentice-Hall, ISBN 0-13-972191-6. Also available through DEC\n	Direct at 1-800-DIGITAL.\n\nThe other book I commonly recomend to novices is:\n\nYoung, Doug. "The X Window System: Applications and Programming with\n	Xt (Motif Version)," Prentice Hall, 1989 (ISBN 0-13-497074-8).\n	(ISBN 0-13-972167-3)\n\nAnd of course O'Reilly has an entire series of manuals on X and Xt.\nO'Reilly ordering is 800-998-9938.  In particular, Volume 5 is an Xt\nreference done in manual page style.  The 3rd edition is extensively\noverhauled and goes far beyond the MIT manual pages.  I'm finding it\nvery useful.  In particular, the permutted index and references to\nother manual pages help a great deal in chasing down related\ninformation.\n\nI read two periodicals, "The X Resource" and the "The X Journal".\nThese are the only two dealing specifically with X.  "The X Resource"\nis published quarterly, by O'Reilly, with one of the issues being the\nMIT X Consortium Technical Conference Proceedings.  There is no\nadvertising.  I've found it informative with pretty good depth.  For\norders, call 1-800-998-9938, or email cathyr@ora.com.  For editorial\nmatters, email adrian@ora.com.  Table of contents are posted at\nmath.utah.edu in ~ftp/pub/tex/bib in TeX form and on ftp.uu.net in\n~ftp/published/oreilly/xresource in ASCII form.\n\n\n"The X Journal" is a bimonthly trade rag with lots of advertising.\nThe articles are informative and oriented toward a less technical\naudience.  I read it more to see what's going on then with an\nexpectation of learning a great deal (but remember, I represent a\nfairly small percentage of people).  Also, they have a pretty good\ncollection of people on the advisory board and as columnists.  Call\n(908) 563-9033.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n14. What Widgets are available?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are three popular widget sets:\n\nAthena	- The set provided with X11.  This is sufficient for most\n	  purposes but is on the ugly side.  Recently, a 3d look is\n	  available for ftp on export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/Xaw3d.tar.Z.\nMotif	- From OSF available for a license fee and commonly shipped on\n	  many workstation vendors platforms (almost everyone but\n	  Sun).  It looks good and works well but personally I think\n	  it is poorly implemented.\nOLIT	- The Open Look Intrinsics Toolkit is a set of widgets\n	  implementing Sun's Open Look specification.  Developed by\n	  AT&T.  I've never used it so can't comment on its quality.\n	  I've heard rumours that it is a pain to actually get.\n\nIn addition the following collection of widgets are also available:\n\nXtra	- a library of widgets for sale from Graphical Software\n	  Technology (310-328-9338).  It includes bar graph, stacked\n	  bar graph, line graph, pie chart, xy plot, hypertext, help,\n	  spreadsheet, and data entry form widgets.  I've never seen\n	  them so I can't comment.\nFWF	- The Free Widget Foundation is attempting to collect a set of\n	  freely available widgets.  Included are a Pixmap editor,\n	  FileDialog, and a few others.  The current set of widgets\n	  can be obtained via anonymous ftp from the machine\n	  a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1) in the file pub/fwf.shar.Z.\nXcu	- The Cornell University widgets from Gene Dykes.  One of the\n	  early widget sets released.  Provides a nice appearance for\n	  buttons and has a mini command language.  Probably not so\n	  widely used.\nXs	- The Sony widget set.  This was around during R3 days but\n	  seemed to disappear.  It looked like it had promise.\nXw	- The HP widgets.  The precursor to Motif.  Originally written\n	  for R3 there exists diffs to get it to work under R4 & R5.\n	  Again, a pretty good widget set but has more or less died.\n	  The precursor to this was the Xray toolkit which was\n	  originally implemented for X10R4 and apparently provided\n	  much experience for the designers of Xt.\nXo	- A widget set I'm working on.  It's still primitive but you\n	  can give it a try in archive.cis.ohio-state.edu:pub/Xo/*\n\nThe following specialized widgets are also available:\n\nTbl	- Implements a tabular layout of widgets.  Supports Motif\n	  widgets as children.  Part of Wcl.\nPlots	- The Athena Plotting widgets (not the Athena widgets).\n	  Contact gnb@bby.oz.au or joe@Athena.MIT.EDU.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n15. What alternatives to the Intrinsics are there?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n	__________________________________________\n	Name		Language	Vendor\n	__________________________________________\n	Xview		C		Sun\n	OI		C++		ParcPlace\n	Interviews	C++		Stanford\n	Tcl/tk		C		sprite.berkeley.edu\n	__________________________________________\n\n\nHowever much I like C and admire the skill in both designing and\nimplementing the Intrinsics, hopefully some alternative will develop\nin the next 3-5 years that uses an object oriented language.  Keep\nyour eyes open and expect some change about the same time a language\nother than C _starts_ gaining acceptance.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n16. How do I pass a float value to XtSetValues?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst, what is going wrong is the structure for an Arg is (essentially)\n	typdef struct\n	{	\n	    String	name;\n	    long	value;\n	} Arg;\n\nand the code:\n	Arg	arg;\n\n	XtSetArg (arg, "name", 3.2)\n\nexpands to\n	Arg	arg;\n\n	arg.name = "name";\n	arg.value = 3.2;\n\nyou can see that with normal C type conversions, the arg.value\ngets the integer "3" instead of the floating point value "3.2".  When\nthe value is copied into the widget resource, the bit pattern is\nwildly different than that required for a floating point value.  So,\nhow to get around this?\n\nThe following macro is from the Athena widgets document and I am now\nrecomending it over the previous suggestions.\n\n#define XtSetFloatArg(arg, n, d) \\n    if (sizeof(float) > sizeof(XtArgVal)) { \\n        XtSetArg(arg, n, &(d)); \\n    } else { \\n        XtArgVal *ld = (XtArgVal *)&(d); \\n        XtSetArg(arg, n, *ld); \\n    }\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n17. How do I write a resource converter?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCourtesy of Rich Thomson (rthomson@dsd.es.com):\n\nThe following discussion of resource converters assumes R4 (or R5)\nIntrinsics.  Resource converters changed between R3 and R4 to allow\nfor destructors and caching of converted values.\n\nThere are several main types of resource converters:\n\n    string to data type\n    data type to string\n    data type to data type\n\ni) string to data type\n    Usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings\n    that will be converted to data type values.  This is most often\n    used to map enumerated names to enumerated values:\n\n	Name		Value\n	"True"		1\n	"False"		0\n\n    In this case, the string to data type converter needs to compare\n    the resource value to the list of fixed strings.  This is most\n    readily accomplished by the use of the "quark" mechanism of the\n    resource manager.  The resource value is turned into a quark,\n    which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a\n    single word.  Then the resource quark is compared against the\n    quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values.\n\n    If there are many enumerated strings in the converter (or many\n    converters, each with a small number of enumeration strings), then\n    a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the\n    resource strings into quarks.  That way, the first time one of\n    these converters is used, the strings will be turned into quarks\n    and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one\n    of the converters.\n\nii) data type to string\n    This type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data\n    type converters since the use of quarks isn't necessary.  Instead,\n    the data type value is simply converted to a string value,\n    probably by the use of sprintf.\n\n    Data type to string converters are useful for applications that\n    wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that\n    they can write out a valid resource specification to a file.  This\n    mechanism can be used to provide a "snapshot" of application state\n    into a file.  This snapshot can be used to restore the program to\n    a known state via the usual X resource database mechanisms.\n\n    If you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type\n    converter, it isn't much extra effort to write the data type to\n    string converter.  Writing both at the same time helps to ensure\n    that they are consistent.\n\niii) data type to data type\n    This type of converter is used to convert an existing data type\n    value to another data type.  For instance, an X pixel value can be\n    converted to an RGB data type that contains separate fields for\n    red, green and blue.\n\n\nThe type signature for a resource converter is as follows:\n\ntypedef Boolean (*XtTypeConverter)(Display *, XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *,\n	XrmValuePtr, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer *);\n    Display *dpy;\n    XrmValuePtr args;\n    Cardinal *num_args;\n    XrmValuePtr fromVal;\n    XrmValuePtr toVal;\n    XtPointer *converter_data;\n\nWhen the converter is invoked, the "fromVal" argument points to the source\nX resource manager value and the "toVal" argument points to the\ndestination X resource manager value.  The "converter_data" argument\nis an opaque pointer to some converter-specific data that is specified\nwhen the converter is registered.  The "args" and "num_args" arguments\nallow extra information to be passed to the converter when it is\ninvoked.  For instance, the Pixel to RGB structure converter discussed\nabove would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup the\nPixel to obtain the RGB values corresponding to that pixel.\n\nCare must be taken with the "toVal" argument.  An XrmValue has the\nfollowing type definition and specifies a size and location for a\nconverted value:\n\ntypedef struct {\n    unsigned int    size;\n    caddr_t         addr;\n} XrmValue, *XrmValuePtr;\n\nWhen the converter is invoked, the address may point to a location of\nthe given size for the converted value or the location can be NULL.\nIn the former case, the converter should ensure that the size of the\ndestination area is large enough to handle the converted value.  If\nthe destination area is not large enough, then the converter should\nset the size to the amount of space needed and return False.  The\ncaller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke the\nconverter.  If the size is large enough, then the converter can simply\ncopy the converted value into the space given and return True.\n\nIf the location is NULL, then the converter can assign the location to\nthe address of a static variable containing the converted value and\nreturn True.\n\nWhen writing a group of converters, this code is often repeated and it\nbecomes convenient to define a macro:\n\n    #define DONE(var, type) \\n      if (toVal->addr) \\n	{ \\n	  if (toVal->size < sizeof(type)) \\n	    { \\n	      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\n	      return False; \\n	    } \\n	  else \\n	    *((type *) toVal->addr) = var; \\n	} \\n      else \\n	toVal->addr = (caddr_t) &var; \\n      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\n      return True;\n\n    #define DONESTR(str) \\n      if (toVal->addr && toVal->size < sizeof(String)) \\n	{ \\n	  toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\n	  return False; \\n	} \\n      else \\n	toVal->addr = (caddr_t) str; \\n      toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\n      return True;\n\nInside the converter, it is a good idea to perform a little safety\nchecking on the "num_args" and "args" arguments to ensure that your\nconverter is being called properly.\n\nOnce you have written your converter, you need to register it with the\nIntrinsics.  The Intrinsics invokes resource converters when creating\nwidgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database.\n\nTo register a converter with a single application context, use\nXtAppSetTypeConverter:\n\nvoid XtAppSetTypeConverter(context, from, to, converter, args, num_args,\n	cache, destructor)\n    XtAppContext context;\n    String from;\n    String to;\n    XtTypeConverter converter;\n    XtConvertArgList args;\n    Cardinal num_args;\n    XtCacheType cache;\n    XtDestructor destructor;\n\nTo register a converter with all application contexts, use\nXtSetTypeConverter:\n\nvoid XtSetTypeConverter(from, to, converter, args, num_args,\n	cache, destructor)\n    String from;\n    String to;\n    XtTypeConverter converter;\n    XtConvertArgList args;\n    Cardinal num_args;\n    XtCacheType cache;\n    XtDestructor destructor;\n\nIn the R3 Intrinsics, there were the routines XtAppAddConverter and\nXtAddConverter; these have been superseded by XtAppSetTypeConverter\nand XtSetTypeConverter.  Whenever possible, the newer routines should be\nused.\n\nWhen a converter is registered with the Intrinsics, a "cache" argument\nspecifies how converted resource values are to be cached:\n\n    XtCacheNone		Don't cache any converted values\n    XtCacheAll		Cache all converted values\n    XtCacheByDisplay	Cache converted values on a per display basis\n\nCaching converted values that require a round-trip to the server is a\ngood idea (for instance string to Pixel conversions).\n\nThe "destructor" argument is a routine that is invoked then the\nresource is destroyed, either because its cached reference count has\nbeen decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value is\nbeing destroyed.  XtDestructor has the following type definition:\n\ntypedef void (*XtDestructor)(XtAppContext, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer,\n	XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *);\n    XtAppContext context;\n    XrmValuePtr to;\n    XtPointer converter_data;\n    XrmValuePtr args;\n    Cardinal *num_args;\n\nThe destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associated\nwith the "to" argument, but does not actually free the storage pointed\nto by the "to" argument itself (to->addr).  The destructor is passed\nthe extra arguments that were passed to the converter when the\nconversion was performed (for instance, colormap and visual arguments\nfor the string to Pixel converter since the destructor would need to\nfree the allocated Pixel from the colormap) as well as the private\ndata passed in when the converter was registered.\n\nSample converter code can be found in the following files in the MIT\nR5 distribution:\n\n    mit/lib/Xt/Converters.c\n    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.c\n    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.h\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n18. How do I open multiple displays?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSee "Multi-user Application Software Using Xt", The X Resource, Issue 3,\n(Summer 1992) by Oliver Jones for a complete coverage of the issues\ninvolved.  Most of this answer is based on that article.  In a\nnutshell, one uses XtOpenDisplay() to add each display to a _single_\napplication context and then XtCloseDisplay() to shutdown each display\nand remove it from the application context.\n\nThe real problems occur when trying to close down a display.  This can\nhappen 3 ways:\n	1. User selects a "quit" button on one of the displays,\n	2. User has window manager send a WM_DELETE_WINDOW message,\n	3. Server disconnect -- possibly from a KillClient message,\n	   server shutdown/crash, or network failure.\n\nI'll assume you can deal gracefully with 1 & 2 since it is _merely_ a\nproblem of translating a Widget to a display and removing that\ndisplay.  If not, then read the Oliver Jones article.\n\nThe third one is difficult to handle.  The following is based on the\nOliver Jones article and I include it here because it is a difficult\nproblem.\n\nThe difficulty arises because the Xlib design presumed that an I/O\nerror is always unrecoverable and so fatal.  This is essentially true\nfor a single display X based application, but not true for a\nmultiple display program or an application that does things other than\ndisplay information on an X server.  When an X I/O error occurs the\nI/O error handler is called and _if_ it returns then an exit()\nhappens.  The only way around this is to use setjmp/longjmp to avoid\nreturning to the I/O error handler.  The following code fragment\ndemonstrates this:\n\n#include <setjmp.h>\njmp_buf XIOrecover;\n\nvoid\nXIOHandler (dpy)\n	Display		*dpy;\n{\n	destroyDisplay (dpy);\n	longjmp (XIOrecover, 1);\n}\n\nmain ()\n{\n	...\n	if (setjmp (XIOrecover) == 0)\n		XSetIOErrorHandler (XIOHandler);\n	XtAppMainLoop (app_context);\n}\n\nThe destroyDisplay() is something that given a Display pointer can go\nback to the application specific data and perform any necessary\ncleanup.  It should also call XtCloseDisplay().\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with setjmp/longjmp, when setjmp() is\nfirst called it returns a 0 and save's enough information in the\njmp_buf that a latter execution of longjmp() can return the program to\nthe same state as if the setjmp() was just executed.  The return value\nof this second setjmp() is the value of the second argument to\nlongjmp().  There are several caveats about using these but for this\npurpose it is adequate.\n\nSome other problems you might run into are resource converters that\nimproperly cache resources.  The most likely symptoms are Xlib errors\nsuch as BadColor, BadAtom, or BadFont.  There may be problems with the\ntotal number of displays you can open since typically only a limited\nnumber of file descriptors are available with 32 being a typical\nvalue.  You may also run into authorization problems when trying to\nconnect to a display.\n\nThere was much discussion in comp.windows.x about this topic in\nNovember of 91.  Robert Scheifler posted an article which basically\nsaid this is the way it will be and Xlib will not change.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n19. What changed from R3 to R4 to R5?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis addresses only changes in the Intrinsics.

Where are the resources loaded from?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe resources of a widget are filled in from the following places\n(from highest priority to lowest priority):\n\n	1. Args passed at creation time.\n	2. Command line arguments.\n	3. User's per host defaults file\n	4. User's defaults file.\n	5. User's per application default file.\n	6. System wide per application default file.\n\nNote that 2-6 are read only once on application startup.  The result\nof steps 3-6 is a single resource database used for further queries.\n\nThe per host defaults file contains customizations for all\napplications executing on a specific computer.  This file is either\nspecified with the XENVIRONMENT environment variable or if that is not\nset then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults-<host> is used.\n\nThe user defaults file is either obtained from the RESOURCE_MANAGER\nproperty on the root window of the display or if that is not set then\nthe file $HOME/.Xdefaults is used.  Typically, the program "xrdb" is\nused to set the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  Please note that this\nshould be kept relatively small as each client that connects to the\ndisplay must transfer the property.  A size of around 1-3KByte is\nreasonable.  Some toolkits may track changes to the RESOURCE_MANAGER\nbut most do not.\n\nA user may have many per application default files containing\ncustomizations specific to each application.  The intrinsics are quite\nflexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describes\nthe various environment variables and how they effect where this file\nis found.\n\nThe system wide per application default files are typically found in\n/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.  If such a file is not found then the\nfallback resources are used.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how\nthis file is found.  Read the next part that describes the various\nenvironment variables and how they effect where this file is found.\n\n[Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com) for the following, 6/92]\n\nYou can use several environment variables to control how resources are\nloaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH,\nXUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables\ncontrol where Xt looks for application-defaults files as an\napplication is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file\nfrom the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path\ndefined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.\n\nSet XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a\nway that app-defaults files appear in several different directory\nhierarchies.  Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun's Open\nWindows, and you also have some R4 X applications installed in\n/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this for\nXFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults files\nin both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your\nOPENWINHOME is located):\n\n	setenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N\n\nThe value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of\npathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows\n(see XtResolvePathname()):\n\n	%N	The value of the filename parameter, or the\n		application's class name.\n	%T	The value of the file "type".  In this case, the\n		literal string "app-defaults"\n	%C	customization resource (R5 only)\n	%S	Suffix.  None for app-defaults.\n	%L	Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. "ja_JP.EUC")\n	%l	Language part of %L  (e.g. "ja")\n	%t	The territory part of the display's language string\n	%c	The codeset part of the display's language string\n\nLet's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is\n"Myterm". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin.\n(Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.)\n\n	/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm\n	$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm\n\nAs the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above\napp-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it\nreads it and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of\nthis path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.\n\nLet's consider another example. This time, let's set\nXUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current\nworking directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.\n\n	setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N\n\nThe first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands\nto $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for\ndebugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming the\napp-defaults file Myterm.ad in the application's source directory, so\nyou can run the application from the directory in which you are\nworking and still have the resources loaded properly.\n\nNOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,\n      for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is\n      defined so %T and %S are useless.\n\nWith R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customization\nresource value.  For example, you might run the "myterm" application\nlike this:\n\n	myterm -xrm "*customization: -color"\n\nIf one of your pathname specifications had the value\n"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/%N%C" then the expanded pathname would be\n"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color" because the %C substitution\ncharacter takes on the value of the customization resource.\n\nThe default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:\n\n		/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\  (R5)\n		/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\  (R5)\n		/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\     (R5)\n		/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\n		/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\n		/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N\n\n(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in this\nbatch of default settings.)\n\nThe default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is \n\n		<root>/%L/%N%C:\  (R5)\n		<root>/%l/%N%C:\  (R5)\n		<root>/%N%C:\     (R5)\n		<root>/%L/%N:\\n		<root>/%l/%N:\\n		<root>/%N:\n\n<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory\nif XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some\nvalue other than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.\n\nNotice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find\nyour app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set\nXAPPLRESDIR to ".", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked\ndifferently; for R3 compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR\nvalue to "./", a dot followed by a slash.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n21. What order are callbacks executed in?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/10/92)\n\nThe Intrinsics library do not guarantee an order.  This is because\nboth the widget writer and the application writer have the ability to\nmodify the entire contents of the callback list.  Neither one\ncurrently knows what the other is doing and so the Intrinsics cannot\nguarantee the order of execution.\n\nThe application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer; the\nwidget writer is not required to document when the widget will add and\nremove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have;\ntherefore the functionality contained in a callback should be\nindependent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on the\nlist.\n\nEven though the Xt standard in the definition of XtAddCallback\n\n 	"callback_name: Specifies the callback list to which the\n 	procedure is to be appended."\n \nyou may not infer from the word "appended" that the callback routines\nare called in the same order as they have been added to the callback\nlist.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n22. How do I know if a widget is visible?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/14/92)\n\n\nRight, everything is implemented correctly.  This demonstrates a "deficiency"\nin the X protocol, and the Core widget is reflecting the capabilities of the\nprotocol.  (The "deficiency" is that the information is available in one way,\nin this case an inconvenient way.)  The Xt specification is accurate, in\nthe second and third paragraphs of section 7.10.2, so read this section\ncarefully.  The visible field will not change in response to iconification.\n\nA VisibilityNotify event will not be received when the window goes from\nviewable to unviewable, that is, when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped;\nthat is, when iconification occurs.  This is the protocol deficiency.\nVisibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the X protocol;\nsee the glossary in your Xlib and X protocol reference manual.\n\n\nYou'll see this with any window manager, with no window manager.\n\n\nAs an application writer, keep track with a global Boolean in an action\nroutine with translations for MapNotify and UnmapNotify on the Shell widget\nwhich contains your custom widget.  As the custom widget writer, see the\nmap_state field returned by a call to XGetWindowAttributes.  These are\nsuggestions.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n23. How do I reparent a widget in Xt, i.e. XtReparentWidget()?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can't.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n24. Why use XtMalloc, XtFree, etc?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUnfortunately, most code that calls malloc(), realloc() or calloc()\ntends to ignore the possibility of returning NULL.  At best it is\nhandled something like:\n\n	ptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type))\n	if (!ptr)\n	{\n		perror ("malloc in xyzzy()");\n		exit (1)\n	}\nTo handle this common case the Intrinsics define the functions\nXtMalloc(), XtCalloc(), XtNew(), XtNewString() and XtRealloc() which\nall use the standard C language functions malloc(), calloc() and\nrealloc() but execute XtErrorMsg() if a NULL value is returned.  Xt\nerror handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits.\n\nIn addition, if XtRealloc() is called with a NULL pointer, it uses\nXtMalloc() to get the initial space.  This allows code like:\n\n	if (!ptr)\n		ptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type));\n	else\n		ptr = (type *) realloc (ptr, sizeof (type) * (count + 1));\n	++count;\n\nto be written as:\n\n	ptr = XtRealloc (ptr, sizeof (ptr) * ++count);\n\nAlso, XtFree() accepts a NULL pointer as an argument.  Generally, I've\nfound the Xt functions conveniant to use.  However, anytime I'm\nallocating anything potentially large I use the standard functions so\nI can fully recover from not enough memory errors.\n\nXtNew() and XtNewString() are conveniant macros for allocating a\nstructure or copying a string:\n\n	  struct abc *xyzzy;\n	  char	     *ptr;\n	  char	     *str = "abcdef";\n\n	  xyzzy = XtNew (struct abc);	/* takes care of type casting */\n	  ptr = XtNewString (str);\n\nA strict interpretation of the Intrinsics reference manual allow an\nimplementation to provide functions that are not exchangable with\nmalloc() and free().  I.e. code such as:\n\n	 char	      *ptr;\n\n	 ptr = XtMalloc (100);\n	 /* ... */\n	 free (ptr);\n\nmay not work.  Personally, I'd call any implementation that did this\nbroken and complain to the vendor.\n\nA common error for Motif programmers is to use XtFree() on a string\nwhen they should really be using XmStringFree().\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n25. How to debug an Xt application?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFirst, I'd recomend getting "purify" from Pure Software.  This is a\ngreat package for tracing memory problems on Sun's.  It's a bit pricey\nat $2750 but I'd still recomend it.  Excuse the marketing blurb\n(contact support@pure.com for more info).\n\n	Purify inserts additional checking instructions directly into\n	the object code produced by existing compilers.  These\n	instructions check every memory read and write performed by\n	the program under test and detect several types of access\n	errors, such as reading unitialized memory, writing past\n	malloc'd bounds, or writing to freed memory.  Purify inserts\n	checking logic into all of the code in a program, including\n	third party and vendor object-code libraries, and verifies\n	system call interfaces.  In addition, Purify tracks memory\n	usage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel\n	adaption of garbage collection techniques.  Purify's nearly\n	comprehensive memory access checking slows the target program\n	down typically by a factor of two to five.\n\nAn alternative package that isn't as pricey ($395 for a Sun), runs on\nmany Unix's and has pretty similar features is "The SENTINEL Debugging\nEnvironment".  This replaces malloc() and several other C library\nfunctions to add additional checks.  (contact cpcahil@virtech.vti.com\nfor more info)\n\nNext, if you are getting any sort of Xlib error, you'll need to run in\nsynchronous mode, easily accomplished with the "-sync" command line\nargument or by setting the variable Xdebug to 1 with your debugger.  Then\nset a break point in exit().  This will let you trace back to the\noriginal Xlib function being called.  If you don't run in synchronous\nmode, then the actual error may have occured any number of calls to\nXlib previously since the Xlib calls are buffered and replies from the\nserver are asynchronous.\n\nNext, if you are having trouble with window layout, you can use the\nundocumented resource "xtIdentifyWindows" or the class resource\n"XtDebug" to cause the widget name to be identified with each window.\nFor example:\n\n    example% xload -xrm '*XtDebug:true' &\n    example% xwininfo -tree\n	     <click in new xload window>\n\nwill give the normal information but the widget name and class of each\nwindow is included.  This can help for checking the location and size\nof errant widgets.\n\nNext, if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want to\ntest the way a widget manages it's children, you can try\nexport.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/libXtGeo.tar.Z.  This acts as a filter\nbetween any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviour\nof both.  It's a very clever idea.\n\nThe most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while the\napplication is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse (such as from\na pulldown menu).  The server effectively locks up and you'll need to\ngo to another machine and kill the debugger manually.  The server\nlocks up because the application being debugged has said no one else\ncan have access to the keyboard but the application is not stopped\nwaiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands.\nUnfortunately you can't give them because all the input is going to\nyour application which is stopped.\n\nThe best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines on\nyour desk, running the program under a debugger (or other environment)\non one machine, and running the application on the other, possibly\nusing a command sequence like this:\n\n	othermachine% xhost +thismachine\n	thismachine% setenv DISPLAY othermachine:0;\n	thismachine% gdb application	# Your favorite debugger.\n	or this:\n	othermachine% xhost +thismachine\n	thismachine% gdb application\n	(gdb) set environment DISPLAY othermachine:0\n	(gdb) run ...\n\nI believe CodeCenter, a C interpreter/graphical debugger has a method\nof dealing with this by explicitely calling the Xlib functions to\nrelease any grabs during breakpoints.\n\nDebugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills and\nknowledge of how widgets work.  You can go a long way without knowing\nthe internals of a particular widget but not very far without\nunderstanding how a widget works.  Judicious use of conditional\nbreakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a great\ndeal.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n26. Why don't XtAddInput(), XtAddTimeout() and XtAddWorkProc() work?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n   I have got a delicate problem with the three routines XtAddInput,\n   XtAddTimeOut and XtAddWorkProc. The problem I have is that when\n   I use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly.\n   I have made a handy little testprogram where everything works\n   perfect, but in my "real" application nothing happens. \n\nThe introduction in R3 of the XtApp*() functions obsoleted those\nroutines (see Q19 for other changes in R3, R4, and R5).  What happens is\nthey use a default application context different then the one you may\nhave created.  Since events and timeouts are distributed on a per\napplication context basis and you are using two application contexts,\nyou won't get those events.\n\nFor example:\n\n	...\n	cnt = 0;\n	toplevel = XtAppInitialize(&app, class,\n				   Desc, XtNumber (Desc),\n				   &argc, argv,\n				   Fallback, args, cnt);\n\n	XtAddTimeOut (...)\n	XtAddWorkProc (...)\n\n	XtAppMainLoop (app)\n\nwould never invoke the timeout.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n27. What is and how can I implement drag and drop?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Courtesy of Roger Reynolds, rogerr@netcom.com; 19 Feb 93)\n\nDrag-n-drop is a buzzword for moving data between clients, in an\n``intuitive'' fashion.\n\nMotif Version 1.2 supports drag-n-drop capabilities, OpenLook has\nsupported d-n-d all along.  The two protocols are not compatable with\neach other, and so far as I know, they are not published.\n\nI wrote a package called RDD which is designed to be a flexible public\nprotocol for doing drag 'n drop operations between clients.  My\nintention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people to\nsupport a "standard" drag-n-drop protocol in the programs they develop\nand contribute or sell, regardless of what widget set is used (as long\nas it is based on Xt).\n\nThe implementation is based upon my understanding of the ICCCM\nconventions, for more details read the code.\n\nI have heard from dozens of people using RDD who like it and feel that\nit works a whole lot better than Motif 1.2 stuff.  Also, there seem to\nbe many who think that it is neat but are constrained to use Motif\nanyway.\n\nThe latest RDD (and some other stuff) is available for ftp from\nnetcom.com, in /pub/rogerr.  A (possibly older) version is also\navailable on export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib.
Archive-name: x-faq/part3\nLast-modified: 1993/04/04\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  58)! Where can I get patches to X11R5?\n\n	The release of new public patches by the MIT X Consortium is announced\nin the comp.windows.x.announce newsgroup.\n\n	Patches themselves are available via ftp from export and from other\nsites from which X11 is available. They are now also distributed through the \nnewsgroup comp.sources.x. Some source re-sellers may be including patches in \ntheir source distributions of X11.\n\n	People without ftp access can use the xstuff mail server. It now has \n23 patches for X11R5 [3/93].  Send to xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu the Subject line\n		send fixes #\nwhere # is the name of the patch and is usually just the number of the patch.\n\n	Here are a few complications:\n	1) fix 5 is in four parts; you need to request "5a", "5b", "5c" and \n"5d" separately\n	2) the file sunGX.uu, which was part of an earlier patch, was \nre-released with patch 7 [note: the file doesn't work with Solaris]\n	3) fix 8 is in two parts: "8a" and "8b"\n	4) fix 13 is in three parts: "13a", "13b", and "13c"\n	5) fix 16 is in two parts: "16a" and "16b"\n	6) fix 18 replaces the R5fix-test1 for the X Test Suite, which \npreviously was optional\n	7) fix 19 also needs PEXlib.tar.Z, which you can obtain from xstuff\nby asking for "PEXlib.uu.[1234]".\n	8) fix 22 is in 9 parts, "22a" through "22i"\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  59)  What is the xstuff mail-archive?\n\n	The xstuff server is a mail-response program. That means that you mail \nit a request, and it mails back the response.\n	Any of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line. The\nxstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything, so you can \nhave several different commands in a single message (unless you ask for help). \nThe xstuff server treats the "Subject:" header line just like any other line \nof the message.\n	The archives are organized into a series of directories and \nsubdirectories.  Each directory has an index, and each subdirectory has an \nindex. The top-level index gives you an overview of what is in the \nsubdirectories, and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it.\n\n	1) The command "help" or "send help" causes the server to send you a \nmore detailed version of this help file.\n	2) if your message contains a line whose first word is "index", then \nthe server will send you the top-level index of the contents of the archive. If\nthere are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories, then \nthe indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the top-level index. \nFor example, you can say "send index fixes" (or "index fixes"). A message that \nrequests an index cannot request data.\n	3) if your message contains a line whose first word is "send", then the\nxstuff server will send you the item(s) named on the rest of the line. To name \nan item, you give its directory and its name. For example\n                send fixes 1 4 8a 8b 9\n	You may issue multiple send requests. The xstuff server contains many \nsafeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large \namounts of data. The mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed\namount of data each day.

Hi, looking for any advice or suggestions about a problem I'm\nhaving with MIT X11R5's editres, in particular under twm variants.\n\nFor a start, 9 times out of 10 (but NOT always) editres won't\ngrab a widget tree when running on our NCD (Decwindows) Xterms,\nwhich I'm told will be fixed when the R5 (not R4) XDm is installed.\nOK, so I tried running it on a Sun, running real R5, on the same\nnetwork - I get a widget tree, but it's ALWAYS for 'TWM Icon Manager'\n\nAnybody know of any patches for (a) twm or (b) editres that I should\nlook at?
I consider TWM-style Squeezed Titles indispensable in a window\nmanager. I like to have two tall xterm windows visible at the same\ntime, with no overlap; and since two windows aren't enough, I have\nother xterm windows underneath them, with exactly the same positioning.\n\nIn case you're not familiar with Squeezed Titles, here's a crude\npicture:\n\n ====================== Figure 1 ====================================\n |\n |    +---------+                   +---------+          +=========+\n |    + title A +                   + title B +          + title C +\n |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+\n |    +   this is the          +    + window B hides window C, but +\n |    +     body of the        +    + you can still see C's title  +\n |    +      window, window A  +    + which is squeezed right.     +\n |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+\n |\n ====================== Figure 1 ====================================\n\nSqueezed titles allow me to have about 5 such windows in each stack,\nwith easy access; and 3 per stack is usually more than I really\nneed, since I also insist on having a virtual WM.\n\nThe only problem is that the title location is static, that is,  it\nis configured in .twmrc, and in order to change it you have to edit\nthat file and restart the window manager. Doing so is cumbersome and\ntime-consuming.\n\nTherefore, I have implemented f.squeeze{ left, center, right }\nfunctions in my own copy of vtwm; the idea being that with one click\nof a button, you can change this:\n\n    +---------+\n    + title A +\n    +------------------------+\n    +   this is the          +\n    +     body of the        +\n    +      window, window A  +\n    +------------------------+\n\nto this:\n\n                   +---------+\n                   + title A +\n    +------------------------+\n    +   this is the          +\n    +     body of the        +\n    +      window, window A  +\n    +------------------------+\n\n ===============\n\nOkay. So far, so good. Now, how the heck do I get them to put this\ninto the next "official" twm, and the next tvtwm, and the next vtwm,\nand the next ctwm? And the next xyztwm that I never heard of?\n\nOne way would be to post, in comp.windows.x, a description of this\nenhancement, together with an explanation of why I think it is a\nVery Good Thing, and hope that someone reads it. :-)\n\nIn case it isn't already clear why I think it's a Very Good Thing,\nlook back up at Figure 1, and picture window A moved over on top of\nwindows B and C; now window A's title hides Window B's title;\nbut when you hit f.squeezecenter, the result is:\n\n        +=========+   +---------+   +=========+\n        + title B +   + title A +   + title C +\n        +-------------------------------------+\n        +   this is the body of the window,   +\n        +   window A, which is on top.        +\n        +-------------------------------------+\n\n ===================\n\nThe rest of this posting explains how to implement it, based on my\nX11R4 copy of vtvwm.shar; it's just a sketch because posting the\nfull diffs would be too long.\n\nThe key to this enhancement is to add the following lines in the\nExecuteFunction() routine in menus.c:\n\n#ifdef SHAPE\n	case F_SQUEEZELEFT:\n	{	static SqueezeInfo left_squeeze = { J_LEFT, 0, 0 };\n		if (DeferExecution (context, func, Scr->SelectCursor))\n		  return TRUE;\n\n		tmp_win->squeeze_info = &left_squeeze;\n		SetFrameShape( tmp_win );\n		break;\n	}\n	.... and similarly for squeezeright ( J_RIGHT ) and\n	squeezecenter ( J_CENTER ) ...\n#endif\n\n( Of course, you also have to define F_SQUEEZELEFT in parse.h\n  and add\n    { "f.squeezeleft", FKEYWORD, F_SQUEEZELEFT },\n     ... and so forth ...\nto parse.c\n\nIn order to use these functions, add something like the\nfollowing to your .twmrc file:\n\nButton2 = m | s : w|v|d|r|i|t|door : f.squeezecenter\n\n =================\n\nAbout a year ago, I posted this, but our news was broken and I\n*think* it didn't get out.\n\nSince then, "blast" has appeared in comp.sources.x, Volume 19,\nIssue 41; you could use blast to achieve a similar effect, by\nchiseling away at an mwm-style wide title. Better to have a\ntwm-style window manager, I think.\n\n--\nRalph Betza (FM),\nuunet!ssiny!gnohmon         gnohmon@ssiny.com
Does XDM work with DECnet? I have an Ultrix machine running both TCP/IP\nand DECnet. I have a number of X-terminals hanging off the Ultrix host also\nrunning TCP/IP and DECnet. Presently I am using XDM for the login procedure\non the X-terminals using TCP/IP. Since XDM is basically just an X-windows\nclient, shouldn't I be able to run XDM on the DECnet protocol tower as well?
The protocol has to move the whole image from process memory to server\nmemory, this is the hog. The conversions in the XPutImage() are\nfast.\n\n\nYes, by utilizing the MIT-SHM extension, that provides an XPutImage\nderivate that uses shared memory. Fine fast.\n\n\nNo. You can still XPutImage all of the frames onto pixmaps (thus moving\nthem to server memory) and then replay them fastest using XCopyArea()\nBUT be aware, this is a major server memory bummer !

I've been using the XmGraph widget that's been floating around and I\nnoticed the performance is significantly better using Gadgets, perhaps\neven 100% faster.  I had heard in an old programming course that gadgets\nwere no longer any benefit to performance, and that it's just as well\nto use widgets everywhere.  So why would ~50 pushbutton gadgets be a lot\nquicker than 50 pushbuttons in the graph?  Should I start putting gadgets\nback into my long pulldown menus? \n\nXmGraph manages children connected by XmArc widgets in a directed network\ntype graph with automatic layout capability.\n\n\nBill

Not being an Xt programmer by any stretch of the imagination, this is\ndriving me crazy and it's probably really simple to do.\n\nI need to make a composite widget that does nothing at all but is\nmerely a placeholder in a widget instance heirarchy -- allowing me an\nadditional resource name level.\n\nTo illustrate I have an application with the following widget\nheirarchy:\n\n	    Shell Widget\n	         |\n	Application Widghet\n\nI want the following:\n\n	    Shell Widget\n	         |\n	Intermediate Widget\n	         |\n	 Application Widget\n\nwhere the intermediate widget has a name but gets all its other\nproperties (and propagates down new values) from the shell widget.\n\nI assume there's a simple way to do this but I can't find an example\nand the documentation I have is rather vague about implementing\ncomposite widgets.\n\nPlease respond via email.  Any help will be very much appreciated.
I'm writing 'xwall', a simple X version of 'wall', and I want it to\nput a message up on each of a default list of displays.  The problem\nis that XOpenDisplay hangs if one of the displays is currently\ncontrolled by xdm (login screen).   I've been through the manuals\nand FAQ and don't see a simple way to see if a display is 'openable'\nahead of time, or to get XOpenDisplay to fail after a short period\nof time.  Any hints, suggestions, clues, or pointers to info?  Thanks...
Hi netters,\n\nI'm using sliders in my XView apps, usually with editable numeric\nfield. But I seem to have no control over the length of this field.\nIn some apps it appears long enough to keep several characters,\nin some - it cannot keep even the maximum value set by \nPANEL_MAX_VALUE! \n\nAs I understand, PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH, which controls\nnumber of characters to be displayed in text items, doesn't\nwork in the case of slider, despite the fact that <panel.h>\ncontains the following bit:\n\n	/* Panel_multiline_text_item, Panel_numeric_text_item,\n	 * Panel_slider_item and Panel_text_item attributes\n	 */\n	PANEL_NOTIFY_LEVEL	= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_ENUM,			 152),\n	PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH	= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_INT,		 182),\n\nwhich gives a hint that this attribute can be used for sliders.\nBut 1) setting this attribute gives nothing, and 2) xv_get'ting\nthis attribute gives warning: Bad attribute, and return value 0.\n\nCan someone share his experience in managing sliders in XView with me,\nand clear this problem?\n\nAny help is very much appreciated.\n\nYuri

Some one asked me recently why they when they used XQueryBestCursor to see\nif they could create of a given size it seemed to imply they could, but the\nserver did not create cursors of that size. Investigation showed that some X\nservers will happily return any size up to the size of the root window, while\nothers return some fixed limit of more reasonable size. The interesting thing\nto me is that the same server binary acts differently on different hardware -\na Sun4 with a cg2 will claim cursors up to root window size are OK, while a\nSun4 with a cg6 will stop at 32x32. So far I've also seen this behavior on\nNCD and Phase-X X terminals and have been told it also occurs on HPs. \nActually, the NCD is even more liberal - sizes much larger then the root\nwinodw are gladly returned as OK. Is XQueryBestCursor semi-broken or is this\nbehavior correct? I'd really like to see a 2000x2000 cursor!
..deleted...\n\nIn plain Motify using a dialog 'in-line' like this simply isn't done. You need\nto set callbacks from the buttons/widgets in your dialog and let the callback routines\ndo the work. In the callbacks you can then carry on the flow of logic. \n\nXView from Sun actually supports this very neatly with a 'Notify' box, which can\nreturn a status in-line, it does actualy ease coding but goes against the event\ndriven style of an application.\n\nSummary: Redesign required.
I'm having an X resource problem using Brian Wilson's wscrawl 2.0\n(a wonderful interactive conferencing program, by the way).  I'm \nrunning OpenWindows 3.0 on a SPARC 1+ under OS 4.1.3.  I have\nthe following defaults in my .Xdefaults file (among many others):\n  wscrawl.telePointerName:	Kevin\n  wscrawl.syncScrollbars:		True\n  wscrawl.continuousTelePointer:	True\n  wscrawl.showPointerCoordinates:	False\n  wscrawl*background:		LightBlue\n  wscrawl*swindow*foreground:	yellow\n  wscrawl*draw_area_frame*foreground:	Blue\n  wscrawl*keyboardFocusPolicy:	pointer\n\nNaturally, I exited the server and restarted it after adding\nthose lines to .Xdefaults .\n\nIf I run the following from a cmdtool (pwd = my home dir.):\n  xrdb -m .Xdefaults\nand then start up wscrawl, then all those defaults are used\nproperly.  Wonderful, yes?  Except that I can't get them to be\noperative except by *manually* invoking the afore-mentioned\nxrdb command.  If I try:\n  xrdb .Xdefaults\nthe defaults "won't take."\n\nSo, I tried to change the xrdb call in my .xinitrc file from:\n  xrdb  $HOME/.Xdefaults\nto:\n  xrdb -m $HOME/.Xdefaults\n\nNo go.  So I tried adding in:\n  xrdb -m /home/kbw/.Xdefaults\nat the beginning or end of my .openwin-init file.  Still no go.\n\nAny notions what gives?  Thanks for the help.
I ran in to this problem I while ago, and from what I remember you should use\nXtTranslateCoordinates etc. after realizing the main widget to calculate\nthe location of the popup, then use something like XtVaSetValues on the\npopup widgets before ever using them.  Calling SetValues repeatedly (e.g.\nevery time something pops up) seems to be what slows you down.  I never\ndelved deep enough to figure out exactly why though...\n\n---------------------------\nJeremy Payne\nUIUC Neuroscience program /\nCollege of Medicine\njrpayne@uiuc.edu\n(217)244-4478
Try the 'M.Sc. Computing Science' course at the REAL Newcastle University.\nIt's a conversion course, but at least they teach REAL programming.\n\nIn the space of 9 months we were taught PASCAL, Simula, Prolog, Miranda.\nAlso, some basic low level stuff (68000) was covered as well.\n\nThey also did concurrent programming and operating systems, some software\nengineering, plus quite a few optional units, including database theory,\nand some stuff about comms.   \n\nThe PASCAL is to be replaced by C/C++ I think next year - I learn't this (and \nX Windows programming as well)\nanyway via a good selection of project over the final three months - depending\non your tastes, the selection of skills learn't can be quite wide reaching.\n\nThe one critiscism I would level at the course, which I would have thought\ninvaluable, is the lack of an option to do the project period in industry -\nthis would probably need a slightly longer project period (say six months), but\nwould enhance the prestige and usefulness of an already excellent and thorough\ncourse.\n\nYes, I know this sounds like a plug for the course, why not!

I am trying to build and use imake (X11R4) on an IBM RS/6000 running AIX V3.2.\nI am having the following 2 problems.\n\n(1) Many of my Imakefile's have contructs like\n                /**/#This is a makefile\n        at the start of lines to pass Makefile comments thru the C\n        preprocessor and into the Makefile.  Most of the C preprocessors that\n        I have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the\n        line.  Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the\n        start of a directive. \n\n        However the IBM cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol\n        as the start of a directive.  The cpp fails when it determines\n        that "This" is not a known directive.  I have temporarily hacked my\n        imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better\n        fix.\n\n(2) Several Imakefiles use /**/ as a parameter to a macro when a particular\n        use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter.  The AIX cpp\n        gives warnings about these situations but continues to work OK.\n\nIf you are familiar with these problems and have solutions, I would appreciate\ninformation about on your solutions.  (Perhaps, this is solved in a later\nversion of imake that I have not reviewed.)  Also, do you know of other cpp's\nthat behave similarly?

The XView version 3 source distribution included in the contrib section \nof X11R5 included the source to the textedit program.

For\nexample, the OWN 3.0 textedit includes drag and drop support and a \ndropsite in the main control area, while the source in contrib/xview\nknows nothing about drag and drop.\n\nThe textedit.c included in the xview sources says it's version 15.50,\n\n        textedit.c 2.62 91/09/14 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro\n        dragdrop.c 1.26 91/09/14 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro\n        tooltalk.c 2.16 91/09/14 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro\n        ds_relname.c    1.7 91/09/14 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro\n\nSo, does anyone know if the 9/14/91 sources to textedit are available?\nI'd really like to work from the latest source if possible.\n\nPlease reply by email, and I'll post a summary if there's enough \ninterest.

Yip, we had the same problem; the only fix we found was to link static\nsome of the clients, ( btw, we used cc). :-(.
A few days ago I posted a question about trying to call a function which set\nup an X app multiple times.  It was pointed out that XtAppInitialize() should\nnever be called more than once.  This helped.  However, I am still having\nsome problems.  Below is a new little test program that more closely models\nmy real program.  In the actual program, I am writing a library, callable\nfrom any other program.  This means that the first time the lib function is\ncalled, it must initialize things, and after that, it should just use the\nold stuff (still around because of static variables).  In the demo below,\nmain() represents the main program calling my library and doit() represents\nthe interface to the library function.\n\n#include <X11/Xlib.h>\n#include <Xm/Xm.h>\n#include <Xm/PushB.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nvoid bla(XtAppContext app, Widget top)\n{\n        Widget topone = top;		// in real prog, these are member vars\n        XtAppContext theapp = app;	// of a class\n        int junk = 0;\n        Display *dis = XtOpenDisplay(theapp, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, &junk,\n                                        NULL);\n\n        Widget box = XtVaCreateManagedWidget("blaaa", xmPushButtonWidgetClass,\n                        topone,\n                        XmNheight, 50,\n                        XmNwidth, 50,\n                        NULL);\n\n        XtRealizeWidget(topone);\n        for (int i=0;i<=25;i++)	// real prog returns when "Exit" button clicked\n        {\n                XEvent event;\n                XtAppNextEvent(theapp, &event);\n                XtDispatchEvent(&event);\n        }\n        XtDestroyWidget(box);\n        XtCloseDisplay(dis);\n}\n\n// SetItUp - should be called once only\nvoid SetItUp(XtAppContext *app, Widget *top)\n{\n        int junk = 0;\n        (*top)=XtAppInitialize (app, "test", NULL, 0, &junk, NULL,\n                NULL, NULL, 0);\n}\n\n// doit - some library function callable from the outside\nvoid doit()\n{\n        static XtAppContext app;	// use these every time called\n        static Widget top;\n\n        static int setup = 0;\n\n        if (!setup)\n        {\n                SetItUp(&app, &top);\n                setup = 1;\n        }\n        bla(app, top);\n}\n\n// main - program which links to my library\nmain()\n{\n        for (int i=0;i<=20;i++)\n        {\n                doit();\n                printf("sleeping...\n");//widget still on screen at this point\n                sleep(5);\n        }\n}\n\n\nThe problem is that the widget does not go away until the new one is created.\n(It is still on the screen -- unusuable -- during the "sleep" in the main prog,\ndespite the XtDestroyWidget call).\n\nAnyone see something I'm missing?\n\nThanks very much.\n\n(Please respond via email)\n-- \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDavid Rex Wood -- davewood@cs.colorado.edu -- University of Colorado at Boulder
:  really involved there). Many people using Linux like to stay at the cutting\n:  (bleeding) edge: ie. when kernel patches, C library or compiler patches come\n:  out, people like to rebuild their entire systems. The prime requirement for\n:  all Linux software is that it is available under a GNU style public license.\n:  Hence, Linux software uses either the Athena widgets or XView.\n:  Individuals may write software requiring Motif, but I doubt it is widely\n:  adopted.\n\nShameless plug -- the Xaw3d widgets make Athena a much nicer\nalternative than the stock MIT Athena code.\n\n						...Mike
I want to create a single-line Text widget for entering a small amount of text.\n\nI want it to be of fixed width, but have a horizontal scrollbar that scrolls\nautomatically when the user types in order to keep the insertion point\nvisible.\n\nIn trying to do this I have two problems:\n\n - The addition of the horizontal scrollbar does not make the text widget\n   taller, but instead it seems to cover part of the text.\n\n - The scrollbar does not scroll automatically as the user types in text\n   in order to keep the insertion point visible.\n\nAny help is appreciated.\n\nMike

I'm an new to this.  Having found some files (public) to look into, I\nftp'ed them to a system I have access to.  I then used kermit to transmit\nthem via modem to my host computer, a PC-based file system.  I access\ninternet through modem access to a university mainframe.  From the PC\nfile server, I pull the files to a disk, and then pull them from disk\nto a SGI Indigo (the SGI is not networked yet).  When I try to uncompress\nand un-tar the files, they either come out as garbage or I get an error\nin the tar process about directories being invalid.\nWhat I'm wondering about is the transfer of UNIX files (compressed,\nbinary,ascii) about multiple platforms.  My guess is that it is the copy\nto a 'dos' disk that is screwing things up.  Any help is appreciated.\nbob
Hi,

Greetings,\n\n\nI am using an X server that provides 3 visuals:\nPseudoColor 8 bit, Truecolor 24 bit and DirectColor 24 bit.\n\nA problem occurs when I try to create a window with a visual that is different\nfrom the visual of the parent (which uses the default visual which is TC24).\n\nIn the Xlib reference guide from 'O reilly one can read in the\nsection about XCteateWindow, something like:\n"In the current implementation of X11: When using a visual other than the\nparent's, be sure to create or find a suitable colourmap which is to be used \nin the window attributes when creating, or else a BadMatch occurs."\n\nThis warning, strangely enough, is only mentioned in the newer editions\nof the X11R5 guides.\n\nHowever, even if I pass along a suitable colourmap, I still get a BadMatch\nwhen I create a window with a non-default visual.\nThe code looks like this:\n\n------------------ cut here and you'll destroy your CRT ----------------\n\nWindow create_8bit_window_on_truecolour_display(dpy,width,height)\nDisplay *dpy;\nint width, height;\n{\n  Window win;\n  XVisualInfo vinfo;\n  XSetWindowAttributes attr;\n\n  fprintf(stderr,"Opening 8 bit window...\n");\n  if (!XMatchVisualInfo(dpy,DefaultScreen(dpy),8,PseudoColor,&vinfo)) {\n    fprintf(stderr,"Your display can't handle 8 bit PseudoColor.\n");\n    exit(1);\n  }\n  fprintf(stderr,"Using visual: %x\n",vinfo.visual->visualid);\n  cmap = XCreateColormap(\n           dpy,\n           DefaultRootWindow(dpy),\n           vinfo.visual,\n           AllocNone\n         );\n  XSync(dpy,False);\n  XInstallColormap(dpy,cmap);	/* ommision of this line gives same result */\n  attr.colormap = cmap;\n  win = XCreateWindow(\n          dpy,\n          DefaultRootWindow(dpy),\n          10,10,\n          width,height,\n          CopyFromParent,       /* border width */\n          8,                    /* depth */\n          InputOutput,          /* class */\n          vinfo.visual,         /* visual */\n          CWColormap,\n          &attr\n        );\n  return win;\n}\n\n--- cut here and you'll destroy your CRT -----\n\nExecuting this piece of code results in a BadMatch error.\nAnybody who knows why?\nIf so, please drop me a line.\n\n\n\n	Take care,
The short answer seems to be: "I don't".\nThe particular package (wscrawl) seems to reset *all* its defaults\nif *any* of them are missing from the .Xdefaults file.  Once I added\nthe missing ones to the .Xdefaults file, the problem goes away.\n\n-Kevin
I'd like to compile X11r5 on a Sony NWS-1750 running NEWS 4.1c.  The\nX distribution has support for this config, and the release notes say\nit has been tested on the machine.  BUT, also in the release notes,\nnothing from Sony is listed under the supported servers.  What am I\nsupposed to use for my r5 X server then?  How can the OS be supported,\nbut not the hardware? Is there something in the r4 binaries that can\nbe used as the r5 server? These may seem like silly questions, but\nI'm *really* confused.\n-- \nmike@hopper.acs.virginia.edu

Can anyone give me some information, please ...\n\nI need (probably) to write one or more new Motif widgets on the HP-UX\nplatform. Do I need the Motif private header files and source,\nor can I make do with the public headers that are provided?\n"Motif" includes Xt in this context.\n\nOne widget is a multi-column list (which lots of people have\nalready written, I am sure), and would therefore be probably be\na subclass of List rather than something simple like an Xt class.\nIs this more difficult (in principle, not lines of code)?\n\nAlternatively, if anyone has a multi-column list widget they\ncould sell me, this might save me from having to write one!\nDoes it by any chance exist in Motif 1.2 already (I do not\nyet have the spec)?\n\nAnswers appreciated,\n\nNicholas.
Just look at the pbmplus package; it does everything you could ever ask\nfor in converting pbm to almost any format (gif, tga, pcx etc...)

Because xterminals do not have a NeWS server.  xterminals have\nspeed by nature of their limited functionality: once you add NeWS and\neverything else, you have a workstation.  There are workarounds, I've\nheard, one involving a perl script.  What we are trying to do is\nreplace programs that need NeWS (like pageview) with programs that\ndon't (like ghostview).\n	Maybe someone else can elaborate on the perl workaround; I\nhave no personal experience with it.
I have a problem with icon pixmap. My application has to run\n   under openwindow and motif. I wrote my program in Motif with pixmap and\n   icons. It runs fine under motif/motif window manager and X11R5/mwm. But \n   the icon pixmap does not show up under openwin/olwm and X11R5/olwm.\n\n             Has anybody got into this kind of problem? Need a clue. An \n   example which works in both X11R5/motif and openwindow will be great.
I'm writing an application running under X (using Motif), and I need to do\nsome stuff when the application quits.  Now, when I shut down my X Windows\nsession, it doesn't seem to send a SIGTERM (or whatever) signal to my\napplication (I'm trapping various signals like that).  Therefore, I thought\nI could use an X signal to check for my top level window being destroyed.\n\nHowever I seem to get DestroyNotify events whenever I move windows.  Is\nthere any way for me to check that the window is actually being destroyed\n(some field to check or some combination of events?).\n\nReplies by e-mail please and I will summarise.\n\nThanks for any help,\n                      Ian

-- \nHi netland,\n\nI thought that I once read about the existance of a virtual mwm like vtwm.\nOn the usual ftp sites (gatakeeper.dec.com, export.lcs.mit.edu) I can't find\nany trace of this program. Could anybody give me a hint where to find this\nprogram or confirm/deny the existance of this program.\n\nRegards,
Environment:\n      mach/arch : sparc/sun4  (IPX)\n      OS	: SunOS 4.1.3\n      X11	: X11R5 (patchlevel 22)\n      Motif	: 1.2.2\n\nI bring up X server using 'startx' and /usr/bin/X11/Xsun. The following sequence\nof actions crashes the X server (SIGPIPE, errno=32, 'xinit' reports that connexion \nto X server lost):\n\n   1. xinit -- Xsun\n   2. start mwm\n   3. start a client with a 100dpi/75dpi font.\n   4. move the window by dragging the title bar.\n\nThe server dumps core due to SIGPIPE. One of the two messages is printed:\n\n  "Connection to X server lost"\n\nor\n  \n  "Connection broken (errno=32)"\n\n(I believe the first is reported by a client and the second by the server itself).\n\nNext, I ran xdm in debug level = 5. After the same set of actions, xdm reports:\n\n  select returns -1\n  Server for :0 terminated unexpectedly: status 2560\n\n\nNote:\n * The problem doesn't occur with other window managers (twm or olwm). \n * I have not set LD_LIBRARY_PATH. \n * I am not running font server. \n * If I start the client with fixed width font, I do not see this problem.\n * My font path:\n     /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc/,/usr/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo/,/usr/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/,/usr/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi\n\n   (I did mkfontdir in /usr/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi, /usr/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi,\n   /usr/lib/X11/fonts/PEX, /usr/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo,\n   and in /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc).\n\n * This problem seems to occur only on IPX machines. I do not see this \n   problem on IPC workstations.\n\nQuestions:\n * What the hell is goin on ? :-)\n * What does "status 2560" mean (of the server).\n\nI'd greatly appreciate any hints as to the cause of the problem.

Each should start with ---author--- line, and\nX	  should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections.\nX\nX	* The entry's remarks should include:\nX	    - what this program does\nX	    - how to run the program (sample args or input)\nX	    - special compile or execution instructions, if any\nX	    - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5)\nX	    - information about any ---data--- files\nX	    - why you think the program is obfuscated\nX	    - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry.\nX	    - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise)\nX\nX	* Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certain\nX	  portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award.\nX\nX        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They\nX	  should not be required to exist.\nX\nX	  If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info---\nX	  section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple\nX	  ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe\nX	  each info file in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows:\nX\nX	   'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed\nX	   'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional\nX	       digit, followed by '.c'\nX	   your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's\nX	       title, possibly followed by a digit\nX\nX       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your\nX       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a\nX       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of\nX       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed\nX       by a digit, followed by '.sh'.\nX\nX       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must\nX       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames.\nX\nX    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be\nX       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files,\nX       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this\nX       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks.\nX\nX    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected.\nX       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not\nX       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers.\nX\nX    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the\nX       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected.\nX\nX    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.  (UTC is\nX       essentially equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time)  Email your entries to:\nX\nX		...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!obfuscate\nX		obfuscate@toad.com\nX\nX       We request that your message use the subject 'ioccc entry'.\nX\nX       If possible, we request that you hold off on Emailing your entries\nX       until 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.

The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions.\nX    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are\nX    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.\nX\nX    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries.\nX    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.\nX\nX    Changes from the 1993 draft are noted by change bars.  --->		      |\nX\nX\nXWHAT IS NEW IN 1993:\nX\nX    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c\nX    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT.\nX\nX    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C\nX    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers\nX    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with\nX    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor\nX    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES.\nX\nX\nXHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS:\nX\nX    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See\nX    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners.\nX\nX    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries\nX    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year\nX    might be 'old' the next year.\nX\nX    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply\nX    a number of tests to an entry:\nX\nX	* look at the original source\nX	* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII\nX	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines\nX	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines\nX	* run it through a C beautifier\nX	* examine the algorithm\nX	* lint it\nX	* compile it\nX	* execute it\nX\nX    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.\nX    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been\nX    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier.\nX\nX    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain\nX    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the\nX    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as\nX    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given\nX    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that\nX    does something interesting when you run it.\nX\nX    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave\nX    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life\nX    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request\nX    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the\nX    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.\nX\nX    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know\nX    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse\nX    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the\nX    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to\nX    annoy more than amuse.\nX\nX    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries\nX    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules'\nX    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use\nX    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-)\nX\nX    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make\nX    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly\nX    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some\nX    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work.\nX\nX    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that\nX    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off\nX    documenting it.  Noting "this entry sometimes prints the 4th power\nX    of a prime by mistake" would save the above entry.  And sometimes,\nX    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly\nX    working entry is best.\nX\nX\nXOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES:\nX\nX    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We\nX    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests\nX    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far\nX    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.\nX\nX    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we:\nX\nX	#define d define\nX	#d foo		   <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo\nX\nX	int i;\nX	j;		   <-- don't use such implicit type declaration\nX	int k;\nX\nX    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you\nX    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in\nX    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers.\nX\nX    Unfortunately, some ANSI C compilers require array indexes to be of       |\nX    integral type.  Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks should    |\nX    not be used in 1993.  This rule may be relaxed in future contests.	      |\nX\nX	int i;\nX	char *c;\nX	i[c];		   <--- use c[i] instead\nX	(i+3)["string"];   <--- use "string"[i+3] instead\nX\nX    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of\nX    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety\nX    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are\nX    not portable and must not be used:\nX\nX	* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable\nX	* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable\nX	* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg\nX	* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg\nX	* performing arithmetic on va_list variables\nX	* using va_list as a structure or union\nX\nX    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s.\nX\nX    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead.\nX\nX    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...),\nX    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some\nX    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not.\nX\nX    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries\nX    must not assume that it returns an int.\nX\nX    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.\nX    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do\nX    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people\nX    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for\nX    programs that are compact, and are instructional.\nX\nX    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80\nX    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.\nX\nX    We tend to dislike programs that:\nX\nX	* are very hardware specific\nX	* are very OS or Un*x version specific\nX	     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific\nX	      code is likely not to be)\nX	* dump core or have compiler warnings\nX	     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item)\nX	* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x\nX	* abusing the build file to get around the size limit\nX	* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs\nX	* are longer than they need to be\nX	* are similar to previous winners\nX	* are identical to previous losers  :-)\nX\nX    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the\nX    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program\nX    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.\nX\nX    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size\nX    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out,\nX    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to\nX    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel\nX    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off\nX    if you show some amount of restraint.\nX\nX    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact\nX    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get\nX    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.\nX\nX    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob\nX    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C\nX    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third\nX    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting\nX    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!\nX\nX    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating'\nX    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim\nX    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating\nX    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating.\nX    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others)\nX    know of a smaller one!\nX\nX    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that\nX    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't\nX    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend\nX    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store.\nX\nX    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and\nX    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client\nX    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the\nX    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a).\nX    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone\nX    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not\nX    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or\nX    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better\nX    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems.\nX\nX    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on\nX    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines\nX    in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    We like programs that:\nX\nX	* are as concise and small as they need to be\nX	* do something at least quasi-interesting\nX	* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice)\nX	* are portable\nX	* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style\nX	* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION\nX	* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-)\nX\nX    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your\nX    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several\nX    areas really does help.\nX\nX    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in\nX    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to\nX    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.\nX    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well.\nX\nX    Be creative!\nX\nX\nXENTRY FORMAT:\nX\nX    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your\nX    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format,\nX    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the\nX    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS)\nX\nX    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to\nX    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that\nX    is found in mkentry.c:\nX\nX	This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every\nX	attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces\nX	an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases,\nX	where this program differs from the contest rules, the\nX	contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the\nX	contest rules before submitting an entry.\nX\nX    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however,\nX    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check\nX    the entry against the size rules.\nX\nX    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about\nX    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.

If an entry wins, we will rename\nX    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition,\nX    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optional\nX    digit in case of name conflicts.\nX\nX    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award,\nX    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab.\nX\nX    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source\nX    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the\nX    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful\nX    if you did one of the following:\nX\nX	* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry.\nX\nX	* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example:\nX\nX		cc prog.c -o special_name		need special binary\nX\nX	    or  rm -f special_src.c			need special source\nX		cp prog.c special_src.c\nX		cc special_src.c -o special_name\nX\nX	    or  rm -f special_build			need special build\nX		tail +4 build > special_build\nX		sh < special_build\nX\nX	* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of\nX	  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You\nX	  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections.\nX\nX    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files,\nX    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid\nX    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should\nX    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This\nX    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch.\nX\nX    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We\nX    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the\nX    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them\nX    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files,\nX    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed,\nX    then skip the ---info--- section.\nX\nX    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that\nX    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an\nX    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample\nX    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a\nX    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a\nX    'hints' file.\nX\nX    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For\nX    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed\nX    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental,\nX    the entry should not require them exist.\nX\nX    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name\nX    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason,\nX    say so in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they\nX    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say\nX    so in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has\nX    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should\nX    have entry number 0.\nX\nX    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry\nX    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the\nX    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't\nX    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the\nX    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at:\nX\nX	...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges	(not the address for\nX	judges@toad.com					 submitting entries)\nX\nX    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer\nX    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as\nX    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is:\nX\nX	Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993\nX\nX    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The\nX    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many\nX    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string:\nX\nX	date -u "+%a %h %d %T 19%y"\nX	date -u | sed -e 's/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/'\nX	sh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e "s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/"'\nX	sh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e "s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/"'\nX	sh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e "s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/"'\nX\nX    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set\nX    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'.\nX    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number\nX    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be\nX    replaced.\nX\nX\nXJUDGING PROCESS:\nX\nX    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll.\nX\nX    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message\nX    is unpacked into individual files, each containing:\nX\nX	---entry--- section\nX	all ---author--- sections\nX	all ---info--- sections\nX	---build--- section\nX	---program--- section\nX	any other text, including the Email message headers\nX\nX    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure\nX    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was\nX    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the\nX    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is\nX    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award.\nX\nX    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular\nX    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are\nX    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding\nX    out in the end, who won and where they were from.\nX\nX    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award.\nX    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all\nX    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning\nX    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even\nX    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious,\nX    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC\nX    winners at talks)\nX\nX    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the\nX    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give\nX    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their\nX    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We\nX    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well.\nX    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world.\nX\nX    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round,\nX    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles;\nX    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does\nX    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the\nX    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings.\nX\nX    A reading consists of a number of actions:\nX\nX	* reading the ---entry--- section\nX	* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section\nX	* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section\nX	* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any\nX	* passing the source thru the C pre-processor\nX	    shipping over any #include files\nX	* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source\nX	* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor\nX	    shipping over any #include files\nX\nX    In later rounds, other actions are performed:\nX\nX	* linting the source\nX	* compiling/building the source\nX	* running the program\nX	* performing misc tests on the source and binary\nX\nX    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries\nX    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it\nX    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.\nX    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form\nX    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards.\nX    An entry often will compete in several categories.\nX\nX    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries\nX    we receive.  A typical category list might be:\nX\nX	* best small one line program\nX	* best small program\nX	* strangest/most creative source layout\nX	* most useful obfuscated program\nX	* best game that is obfuscated\nX	* most creatively obfuscated program\nX	* most deceptive C code\nX	* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES)\nX	* best abuse of ANSI C\nX	* worst abuse of the rules\nX	* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award>\nX\nX    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so\nX    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.\nX    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.\nX\nX    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of\nX    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10\nX    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into\nX    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not\nX    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is\nX    less clear cut.\nX\nX    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out\nX    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is\nX    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry\nX    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course,\nX    that the entry is worth improving in the first place!\nX\nX    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a\nX    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest\nX    rules in some way.\nX\nX    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such\nX    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the\nX    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories.\nX\nX\nXANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS:\nX\nX    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition,\nX    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to\nX    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF.\nX\nX    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups:\nX\nX	    comp.lang.c		  comp.unix.wizards	alt.sources\nX\nX    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following\nX\nX	    comp.sources.d	  alt.sources.d		misc.misc\nX	    comp.sources.misc	  comp.windows.x\nX\nX    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.

Depends on the nature of the "rounding."  X allows the user to do bit\narithmetic on pixel values, (i.e.,  XOR foreground and backgroun pixel\nvalues together to calculate a foreground color that when used with a\nfunction of GXxor fill change foreground to background and vice-versa).\nIf your rounding does not preserve these types of calculations then \nclients that use them will break.\n\n	Ken

Can anyone out there tell me how to get the total number of color cells\nallocated in the default colormap?\n\ne.g.   colormap = DefaultColormap(mydisplay, myscreen);\n\nThe MAXIMUM number of allocated cells is given by DefaultCells(mydisplay,\nmyscreen), but in general the number of cells actually allocated will be\nmuch less than this, depending on the color requirements of the windows\ncurrently in place. I'd like a way to determine this number. Thanks in\nadvance!\n\nDerek\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------
1) This is NOT a feature of the Window Manager but of xterm.\n2) This sequences are NOT ANSI compatible, are they ?\n   Does anyone know IF there are compatible sequences for this and what they\n   are ?

[again, poseted for a friend]\n\nOkay, I got such great response from my last question (thanks, everyone), \nlets try again:\n\nHow can I tell if a colorcell is read-only?\n\nI want to use any read-only cells that are already in my colormap\nonce I start running out of allocatable cells, using some arbitrary\nnearest color matching scheme to get those cells that come closest to\na requested color.\n\nOnce I determine if a cell is read-only, I assume I can then just request\nan XAllocColor() with the exact same color specifications and it will \nthen be flagged as 'used' by my application so that it doesn't later get\nfreed by someone else and allocated again as read-write to another\napplication.\n\nSo far, the only way I've figured out to do this is to write my own\nerror handler and just go ahead and request the cells colors, once my\ncolormap is all full up.  It should error out if the cell is non-shareable.\nBut life would be much easier if I could just detect the\nread-only/shareable stuff directly...\n\nAny ideas?
I have two questions (well probably more...) about how Expose & Configure\nevents are handled.\n\nI have an appl. which uses 1 window to draw in.  Since I give the user the\ncapability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be\nresized, I made a translation table for the Expose & Configure events.\nThe Expose event calls my redraw method while the Configure event\ncalls my rescale method.  The rescale method invokes a "fake" Expose\nevent (actually just calls the redraw w/ an appropriate Expose struct)\nto draw the data.\n\nQuest 1.\nWhen the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R4 (running in either R4 or R5 env.)\nI get multiple (>4) redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size\nis changed.  I assume I'm getting cascading events.  Is that right?\nAny suggestions as to how to handle/trap events in a better way?\n\nQuest 2.\nWhen the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R5 I get no Expose events\nwhatsoever.  Do events and/or translation tables act differently in R5?\n\nThanks in advance\n\nSteve\n-- \n==========================================================================================

A\ntutorial will be on Thursday the 24th and the conference proper on the\n25th with the annual meeting at the dinner on the evening between the\ntwo days.  All conference attendees are welcome at the annual meeting,\nthough only Consortium members will be able to vote.\n\nThis year's theme is \n\n	Application Construction by Non-Programmers\n\nMuch of the effort on X toolkits has been aimed at programmer\nconstruction of applications.  There have, however, been some excellent\nUIMS systems built on top of X.  Papers addressing the theme will\nconsider questions such as\n	What is needed for application construction by non-programmers?\n	Can we avoid programming altogether, or is a simple language needed?\n	Is it sufficient to create applications, or must users be able to\ncreate new widgets?\n	Should widgets and applications be able to print themselves?\n\nYour participation in the conference is welcome.  Papers are appropriate\non the theme or any aspect of the Andrew User Interface System, including\n\n	applications\n	experience with users\n	new objects\n	reviews of and proposals for revision of \n		internal Andrew protocols\n\nWe expect to have an RS/6000 with video projector available if you would\nlike to do a demonstration.  \n\nPaper proposals should be submitted by 15 May 1993.\nAcceptance will be 1 June with final papers due by 15 June.\n\nSend papers via electronic mail to wjh+@andrew.cmu.edu.

However in your\nevent handler you can use the event structure passed in and query it to find\nwhich button was pressed i.e.\n\nvoid\nSomeEventHandler(Widget w, XtPointer data, XEvent *event)\n{\n    /* Catch the button 1 (usually left button) */\n    if ( event->xbutton.button == Button1 ) {\n        /* do some action */\n    } else {\n        /* do nothing and exit from function */\n    } \n}
You've got to set border_pixel in your window attributes. The default\nis CopyFromParent which gives the BadMatch. Do this:\n\n   ...\n   unsigned long valuemask;\n   ...\n   /*\n    * if border_width is non-zero you'd better alloc a colour from cmap\n    * rather than use any old pixel value. Also, use valuemask, it makes\n    * the code more obvious.\n    */\n   attr.colormap = cmap;\n   attr.border_pixel = 0;\n   valuemask = CWColormap | CWBorderPixel;\n   win = XCreateWindow(\n           dpy,\n           DefaultRootWindow(dpy),\n           10,10,\n           width,height,\n           0,		         /* border width. see comment below */\n           8,                    /* depth */\n           InputOutput,          /* class */\n           vinfo.visual,         /* visual */\n           valuemask,\n           &attr\n         );\n\nA note on border_width: your code looked like this:\n\n\nborder_width set to CopyFromParent works but doesn't make sense.\nborder_width should be an unsigned int. You get away with it because\nCopyFromParent is #define'ed to be zero in X.h. If it happened to be\ndefined as -1 you'd get a very interesting looking window!
I have an applicationShell which uses a colormap created with\nXCreateColormap() and uses all of the colors available for my 8-bit\ndisplay.  When I move the cursor over the window I get the "Technicolor\nEffect" - which is fine.  Basically, my program works.\n\nMy problem/question is: When I popup a dialogShell to prompt the user for\nsome input I want the XmNdialogStyle to be set to\nXmDIALOG_PRIMARY_APPLICATION_MODAL.  The result is that if my cursor is\nover the dialogShell I get my colormap, but if the cursor is over the\napplicationShell (or any window other than the dialogShell) I get the\ndefault colormap.  But I'd like it so that if my cursor is over _any_\nwindow of my application, I get my colormap.\n\nAny suggestions?  Thanks,

Does XFree86 support any EISA video cards under Dell 2.2?
One can't.  The application may not have been started from a terminal\nemulator; if it was, the terminal emulator may not still exist, and if\nit does it may be in no condition to be "pop[ped] to the top" (eg, it\nmay be iconified).  And even if you can, it may not do what you want -\nconsider a virtual-root window manager like tvtwm, with the relevant\nwindow in a portion of the virtual desktop that's outside the real\ndesktop.\n\nSome (but not all) X terminal emulators provide environment variables\ngiving a window ID.  Even if such a thing is present in the\nenvironment, it may not be what you want; it may correspond to a window\non a different server, for example.\n\n					der Mouse

Is the virtual mouse simulation in ol{v}wm 3.x available under X11R5?\nI've been told I'm setting the right resource, yet it continues not to\nwork. I'm running olvwm3.3 (or olwm 3) on a Sun 3, X11R5 pl 22.
I am working on an X-Window based application that needs to \noverride some of the window manager focus processing.  I am \nusing X11R4 and Motif 1.1 currently, although I will also be \nworking with Open Look in the future.\n\n     What I need to do is under certain circumstances prevent the \nuser from switching from one window of the application to \nanother window.  Let's say, for example, that Window A is on top \nof Window B in the window hierarchy.  Normally, if the user clicks \nthe mouse in Window B it will be brought to the top of the \nwindow hierarchy and placed on top of Window A.  Under certain \ncircumstances if the user clicks the mouse in Window B I need to \nbeep and prevent Window B from being raised on top of Window \nA.\n\n      From the research and testing I've done so far, it appears that \nthis window ordering is handled by the window manager, in this \ncase Motif.  I haven't found any way to override this default \nprocessing through standard X Window functions.  I can tell \nwhen this switching occurs through focus change and mapping \nnotify events, but I can't find any way to tell Motif not to make the \nswitch.\n\n      The temporary solution I've currently come up with is very \nkludgy but it partially works.  When I detect such a window switch \nin those cases when the switch is not allowed, I manually force \nthe formerly top window back on top with an XRaiseWindow call \nand beep with the XBell function.  This provides the necessary \nfunctionality but looks ugly when the windows switch places \ntwice.\n\n      Does anyone know how I can tell Motif (or preferably *any* \nwindow manager) when I don't want the window order switch to \nactually take place?  Respond either by e-mail or posting to this \nnewsgroup.\n\nCheers....     Randall
: \n: Has anyone found a fix for the following problem?\n: \n: Client Software:	SunOs 4.1.1, X11R5\n: Server Hardware:	Sun IPC\n: Server Software:	SunOs 4.1.1, Open Windows 3.0 (w/ patch 100444-37)\n: \n: A Motif 1.2.2 application will periodically hang when run against the\n: OpenWindows 3.0 server (xnews). The pulldown is displayed but then no\n: button actions have any effect. Sometimes pressing <Return> will\n: unstick the application but not usually. It looks like the pulldown is\n: grabbing the focus and never letting go. Other windows on the display\n: continue to get updated so the server isn't hanging. If I log in from\n: another terminal and kill the Motif application then everything gets\n: back to normal. The same application when run against other X servers\n: (including MIT X11R5 Xsun, DecWindows, Tektronix X terminal) has no\n: problems. This is obviously a OpenWindows problem but I need a\n: work-around since most of our customers are OpenWindows users.\n\nI have seen the same problem using a SPARCStation 10, Solaris 2.1, OW 3.1.\nIn my case, it happens far more often than "periodically".

Can anyone recomend a good book or article on inter-client communications\nBESIDES I.C.C.M.?\n\nI've looked everywhere I can and it seems everyone tells you how to do it\nbut nobody SHOWS you how.  O'Reilly has no examples, ICCM has no examples,\nAsente & Swick give no examples - in fact most of the books I've looked at,\nif they discuss ICC at all, simply give a condensed version of the ICCM and\nthen refer you to the ICCM.  I did find one example of how to use Atoms and \nProperties in Young's book and five hours after I bought Young's book I had\nmy applications talking to each other.\n\nI am not sure, however, if thats the best way.  I'd like to stay independent \nof Unix so pipes and/or sockets probably aren't the way to go.  But within X\none can also use messages, the clipboard, and perhaps window groups.\n\nI need a text that discusses the various methods, discusses which method is best\nfor which purpose, and gives examples.  Without examples it's all just words.\n\nThanks in advance

Suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that contains\nXlib graphics.  A button widget, when pressed, will cause a new item\nto be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea() \n(or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new\nitem in a memory structure and let the expose event handler take care\nof rendering the image because at that time it is guaranteed that the\nWindow is mapped.
No.  Even if you could, the answer could be out of date even before you\nget it (even if you grab the server, it could be taken up by buffering\nuser actions).  You should just try to do whatever you want; a BadAlloc\nerror is your indication that insufficient server memory is available.\n\n					der Mouse

Hello,\n\n   When starting bx if you recieve an error message saying\n"cannot load app-defaults file..." check your XAPPLRESDIR\nenvironment variable and then put the file BuilderXcessory \n( this is the app-defaults file for BX ) in the directory\nspecified by the XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment variable.\n\n   If you don't have an XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment variable\nthen set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to be the directory where the\nBuilderXcessory file is. You can do this using the setenv\ncommand under csh. Note that the name ends in .ad so you will\nhave to set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to {BX}/%N.ad to get the\napp-defaults to load correctly.\n\n   To make sure the the app-defaults file can be read by all\nthe users, make sure that a copy of or a link to the app-defaults\nfile exists in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults or \n/usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults, depending on how your system is\nset up.\n\n   Once you have taken care of this set the *systemDirectory\nresource to be the directory in which you have installed BX. \nFor example let's say I've installed BX in /t then my system\ndirectory resource should be set like this :\n\n*systemDirectory: /t/builderXcessory

Using XPutImage, your source is maintained by the client and the\ndestination is maintained by the server, thus you incur the overhead\nof transporting through whatever client-server communications\nmechanism you are using.\n\nIs it possible for you to maintain your source images in pixmaps?\nThese are maintained by the server, so copying them into a window is\nmuch cheaper.\n\nAlso make sure you are not sending any unnecessary XSyncs, or running\nin XSynchonize mode.\n--
If I understand your problem correctly, you want to have a way to send\nexposures to your manager widget when your app-specific code draws xlib\ngraphics on the window.\n\nIt sounds like you might want to send an exposure using\nXSendEvent and specifying a region. If you know the region you need to\nsend the exposure, generally you have the bounding rectangle of the objects,\nyou can use XCreateRegion to create a region, XUnionRectWithRegion to add the\nnew object polygons to the region, and then either use the region\nto clip your GC for the redraw or use XRectInRegion to test which of your\nother objects need to be redrawn. Keeping in mind that the stacking order\nof overlapping objects affects how they look.\n\nHope it helps\n\n-- \nBrian Dealy                |301-572-8267| It not knowing where it's at  \ndealy@kong.gsfc.nasa.gov   |            | that's important,it's knowing\n!uunet!dftsrv!kong!dealy   |            | where it's not at...

I'd appreciate any feedback on capture/playback tools for use with X clients.\n\nI have pulled XTM from public domain but it appears to be set up to test\nX servers not X clients. \n\nAny comparisons/comments on regression testing tools would be great -\nparticularly XTM, XRunner, Autotester, and SRI's CAPBAK, SMARTS and EXDIFF.
Hi, I'm new to this group so please bear with me!\n\nTwo years ago I wrote a Sunview application for fast animation\nof raster files. With Sunview becoming rapidly obselete, I've\nfinally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in XView.\nI put together a quick test, and I've found that XPutImage()\nis considerably slower (factor of 2 on average?) than the\nSunview command pw_rop() which moves image data from memory\npixrects to a canvas. This was on a Sparc IPX. It seems that:\n(1) the X protocol communication is slowing things down; or\n(2) XPutImage is inefficient...or both! My question is, what\nis the fastest way in X11R5 to dump 8 plane image data to\na window? Can I take advantage of the fact that the client is\nrunning on the same machine as the server? Or am I stuck with\nXPutImage() (in which case I might as well give up now...)?\n\nAll help appreciated...thanks!\n\nDerek\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------
Help: I am running some sample problems from O'Reilly volume 4,\nXt Intrisics Programming Manual, chapter 3. popup\ndialog boxes and so on.\n\nIn example 3.5, page 76 : "Creating a pop-up dialog box"\n\nThe application creates window with a button "Quit" and "Press me".\nThe button "Press me" pops up a dialog box. The strange feature of\nthis program is that it always pops up the dialog box much faster the\nfirst time. If I try to pop it up a 2nd time (3rd, 4th .... time), \nit is *much* slower.\n\nHas anyone any experience with these sample programs, or why I get\nthis behaviour - fast response time for the first time but slow response\ntime from 2nd time onwards ?\nAnyone can give me some ideas on how to program popups so that each time\nthey popup in reasonable fast response time ?

Hi folks\n\nSay, I'm new to R5 and have one quick question.\n\nIn using xon ( xon  <machine_name> )  , I notice that it\nalways comes up with a very small window .  I'm pretty\nsure its the default font.  My xterms all work normally.\nIs xon supposed to read your .Xresources for a font size ?\n\nxrdb -q appears to show the right stuff.\n\nI can use xon with arguments such as  xterm -fn 10x20    etc\nand everything is correct.  Of course you could always do a \nsimple script to do this , but I have a feeling I'm missing\nsomething simple here.\n\nComments / suggestions appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance
The OpenLook window manager source is available on the MIT contrib tapes\n  or from  export.lcs.mit.edu  .I would suggest building this too, rather than\n  using the version from OpenWindows. It is  olwm  v3.\n\n				Regards,
No. As soon as you blit two of this icons once on top of the other with a\nlittle dislocation, you see the rectangular blit crashes too much of the\nicon first blitted, because it draws a full rectangle. The way to do it\nis masking: Create a bitmap with all pixels to be merged are 1 and all\nnot to be merged are 0. Then, set the clip_mask of the gc to this\nbitmap, set the clip_x_origin and clip_y_origin of the gc to the x/y\ncoordinates where you blit the icon to the destination drawable, use GXCopy,\nand XCopyArea() the icon pixmap to the destination drawable using this gc.
I'm trying to set up an IPX for another group. I copied all the\nX stuff that I compiled on my 4/280 (which runs SunOS 4.1.1) using\ngcc 2.1, and most things run just fine. however, I did find a\ncouple of bugs, and when I try to recompile those clients on the IPX\n(which runs 4.1.3), I get\n\nld: Undefined symbol\n   _XShapeQueryExtension\n   _XShapeCombineMask\n\nI know that I can include libXext and get rid of those messages,\nbut I can't figure out why I get them on the IPX and not on the\n4/280. any ideas?
Has anyone found a fix for the following problem?\n\nClient Software:	SunOs 4.1.1, X11R5\nServer Hardware:	Sun IPC\nServer Software:	SunOs 4.1.1, Open Windows 3.0 (w/ patch 100444-37)\n\nA Motif 1.2.2 application will periodically hang when run against the\nOpenWindows 3.0 server (xnews). The pulldown is displayed but then no\nbutton actions have any effect. Sometimes pressing <Return> will\nunstick the application but not usually. It looks like the pulldown is\ngrabbing the focus and never letting go. Other windows on the display\ncontinue to get updated so the server isn't hanging. If I log in from\nanother terminal and kill the Motif application then everything gets\nback to normal. The same application when run against other X servers\n(including MIT X11R5 Xsun, DecWindows, Tektronix X terminal) has no\nproblems. This is obviously a OpenWindows problem but I need a\nwork-around since most of our customers are OpenWindows users.\n\nI have tried the following things:\n\n    1. Installing the latest version of the OpenWindows server patch\n       (100444-37).\n\n    2. Using mwm (version 1.2.2) instead of olwm.\n\n    3. Applying the patch specified in the Motif FAQ (question 110).\n       This had the effect of disabling the point-and-click method of\n       menu interaction (as opposed to the click-and-drag method), and\n       screwing up the menu mnemonics keys. It did seem to help, but I\n       was still able to get the application to hang.\n\nRepeat By:\n\nThis is an intermittent problem so you'll have to try several times.\n\nClick and release on a menu heading (pulldown menu will pop up)\n\nClick and release on a menu item\n\nRepeat until application hangs\n\n\nAny help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.
Hi Xperts!\n   I have a Sparc-1 with very limited disk space on /usr partition.\n   previously, i was able to run all x-windows applications  and then \n   i upgraded my system to sun o.s. 4.1.3 and realized that , the hard\ndisk did not have enough space to load openwindows. My immediate alternative\nwas to load only the neccessary files to boot the system. This resulted in\nnot loading openwindows. As a result of which none of the X-libraries got loaded.\n\n   I am trying to load just the libraries and include files and bin/X11 files \nrequired for running X-windows and compiling my programs written for Xlib and Xaw.\nIn a desperate effort to regain x-windows, i retrieved /usr/lib/libX*.* files from\nthe tape . /usr/bin/X11/*  and /usr/include/X11/* . Is this enough for running X-windows\n \n BUt i did not get /usr/lib/X11/fonts/  sub directories . these are mainly 100dpi, 75dpi\n and misc. \n\nwhen i run xinit, the error message says /usr/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi etc are not in the\ndefault path. But the problem is i cannot load any of those directories as there is no\ndisk space. \nAre there any temporary suggestions before I get a 1.5 GB disk and load openwindows , to\njust have my x-windows running. \n\nThanks\n\nPramod
Try this:\n\nchar *name=NULL;\nunsigned long value;\n\nif(XGetFontProperty(font, XA_FONT, value)) \n    name=XGetAtomName(dpy, value);\n\nwhere dpy is your Display connection and font your XFontStruct pointer.

I have a problem where an Athena strip chart widget is not calling it's\nget value function.  I am pretty sure this is happening because I am\nnot using XtAppMainLoop, but am dealing with events via sockets.  (ya ya).\n\nAnyway, I want to cause a timeout so that the strip chart widget(s) will\ncall their get value callback.  Or if someone knows another FAST way around\nthis (or any way for that matter) let me know.  I cannot (or I don't think)\ncall the XtNgetValue callback myself because I don't have the value for\nthe third parameter of the get value proc (XtPointer call_data).  \n\nIn other words, I want to force a strip chart widget to update itself.\n\nAny ideas anyone?
No, not another false alarm, not a "It'll certainly be done by *next* week"\nmessage...  No, this is the real thing.

I was cleaning its cage this morning when it overpowered\nme, broke down the office door, and fled the lab.  It was last seen heading\nin the general direction of export.lcs.mit.edu at nearly 30k per second...\n\nIf found, it answers to the name of 'contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z'.\n\nHave a blast.  I'm off to the vacation capital of the U.S.:  Waco, Texas.
A simple question to all the Xperts:\n\nIs it possible to use several X-Terminals\nwith only one mouse and one keyboard?\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nThanks, rainer.
Where do I find the Athena Widgets that are needed for xtdm-2.4.8
I found an oddity with our SGI Indigo (MIPS R3000 chip).\nWhen xlock +nolock is running, and I am working remotely\nor in batch (at) mode, the runtime of my programs (as timed\nby using clock() in the code itself) is ~25% slower than if\nxlock is NOT running.  No other processes seem to affect my\nruntimes, yet this is very consistent!\n\nAny explanations, real or imagined :)
Tcpview is the result of several problems we had at UW.  We have several\nNetwork General Sniffers which are heavily used to help debug problems on\nseveral hundred subnets. These are good tools, but they are 1) heavy, \n2) hard to find when you need one, 3) limited in their software expandibility,\n4) difficult to use to upload data for analysis, 5) cannot be remotely\noperated, and 6) cannot resolve names with DNS, requiring much manual \nmanipulation of the name table.  We also sometimes use tcpdump, but we found \nit 1) too difficult for most people, 2) did not have enough information for\nmany protocols, 3) could not be used interactively, 4) could not handle\nTCP streams and 5) could not read Sniffer files.  However, tcpdump did do\na reasonable job of decoding a large number of protocols, and could be easily\nmodified.  Tcpview is an attempt to resolve these problems\nby adding a Motif interface to tcpdump and expanding its features.\n\nTcpview has been tested on a DECstation 5000 and Sun 4 under Ultrix 4.2 and\nSunOS 4.1 respectively.  It should work on the same systems as tcpdump.\nIt compiles with cc and gcc on the DEC and Sun.  To build tcpview you will\nneed Motif 1.1 or better.\n\nThe following files are available for anonymous ftp from \nftp.cac.washington.edu in /pub/networking\n\ntcpview-1.0.tar.Z	tcpview and tcpdump source code\ntcpview-1.0.sun.tar.Z	Sun4 binaries\ntcpview-1.0.dec.tar.Z	DEC Mips Ultrix 4.2 binaries\n\nWhat tcpview adds to tcpdump:\n- easier interface\n- enhanced protocol decoding\n- hex display of frame\n- capture based on time, number of frames, or user interrupt\n- can show ethernet addresses with manufacturer's name\n- ethernet address host table\n- can easily follow a stream, highlighting out-of-order frames\n- can send TCP data to an external file or filter for additional\n	processing.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCHANGES TO TCPDUMP 2.2.1\n\nNew features:\n\nNow reads and writes Network General Sniffer files.  When used with '-r', the \nfile type will be automatically detected.\n\nCan now read in (and use) an SNMP MIB file.\n\nThe hex format has been changed.\n\nNew time options have been added.\n\nOptions were added to allow viewing and processing of the data in TCP packets.\n\nBugs were fixed in the relative TCP sequence numbers. (-S flag)\n\nNew flags:\n-R	read Sniffer file.  Not usually needed, except for reading from stdin\n-ttt	prints delta times\n-tttt	prints times relative to the first frame\n-W	write a Sniffer save file (use with -w)\n-x	print frame (minus link-level header) in hexdump format.  \n	Sample output:\n\n16:36:23.349851 jeff.cac.washington.edu.1285 > nic.funet.fi.ftp: S 0:0(0) win 16384\n        0000  45 00 00 28 8a 98 00 00 3c 06 7c 9c 80 5f 70 02   |  E..(....<.|.._p.\n        0010  80 d6 06 64 05 05 00 15 5b 19 4a 00 00 00 00 00   |  ...d....[.J.....\n        0020  50 02 40 00 4e 13 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00         |  P.@.N.........\n\n-X	print TCP data in hexdump format (used with -Z)\n-z	write TCP data to stdout (use with -t to eliminate timestamp)\n-Z	write frames and TCP data to stdout\n\n\nMartin M.

Seeing as Motif has been adopted by Sun, IBM, HP +++ (can't remeber the\nother members in the recent announcement), I'm sure you'll see it on\nvirtually every workstation (ie. Sun, IBM, HP and DEC must make up the\n**VAST** majority of all hardware).\n\n\n\n\nPorts of Motif to both 386BSD and Linux are available for a fee of about\n$100.  This is cost recovery for the person who bought the rights to\nredistribute.  The activity in both the BSD and Linux news groups\npertaining to Motif has been high.\n\n\n\n\nI can't see why.  If just about every workstation will come with Motif\nby default and you can buy it for under $100 for the "free" UNIX\nplatforms, I can't see this causing major problems.\n\n\nSide Note :\n---------\nAll the X based code I am writing (and will distribute freely when\ncompleted) is based on Motif because from a programmatic and also "look\nand feel" point of view I like it the best (no flames on this one\nplease).\n\n\n\nbambi
You can also set the Foreground to the XOR of the foreground and background\ncolors:  XSetForeground(..., fg ^ bg);    This works great for me (at least\nwith TrueColor visuals).
I posted about this a while ago but without code excerpts noone was \nable to help me.\n\nThe problem is that main_win.win is doing fine, but when I create \ndetail_win.win, it does not receive it's initial expose events until \nmain_win.win receives an event. Here are the relevent calls:\n\nmain_win.win = XCreateSimpleWindow (mydisplay, DefaultRootWindow(mydisplay),\n                myhint.x, myhint.y, myhint.width, myhint.height,\n                main_win.line_thick, fg, bg);\nXSetStandardProperties(mydisplay, main_win.win, main_win.text,\n                main_win.text, None, argv, argc, &myhint);\nmain_win.gc = XCreateGC (mydisplay, main_win.win, 0, 0);\nXMapRaised (mydisplay, detail_win.win);\nXMapSubwindows (mydisplay, main_win.win);\nThe event mask for main_win is:\n	PPosition | PSize | StructureNotifyMask | ExposureMask| KeyPressMask | \n	EnterWindowMask | LeaveWindowMask;\nThe flags are\n	PPosition | PSize\n\nI then create detail_win.win with the following calls (hints has new values):\ndetail_win.win = XCreateSimpleWindow (mydisplay, DefaultRootWindow(mydisplay),\n                myhint.x, myhint.y, myhint.width, myhint.height,\n                detail_win.line_thick, fg, bg);\nXSetStandardProperties(mydisplay, main_win.win, detail_win.text,\n                detail_win.text, None, argv, argc, &myhint);\ndetail_win.gc = XCreateGC (mydisplay, detail_win.win, 0, 0);\nXMapRaised (mydisplay, detail_win.win);\nEvent Mask and flags are identical to main_win's flags and event mask.\n\n\nIf anybody has any idea why the initial expose events of detail_win.win \nare not received until main_win.win receives an event I'd love to hear \nfrom them. Other that that everything works great so there must be some \ndetail I'm overseeing.

I can't get e.g. F10, Home, End, PgUp, PgDn; they all\nseem to have either the same or no keycode. I have a feeling\nthis can't be fixed in emacs itself, but that I need to do some\nxmodmap stuff. Can someone help me?\n\nBy the way, I've checked the X-FAQ and posted a similar message\nto gnu.emacs.help to no response.\n\nCurrently I have the following in my .emacs file (inside a 'cond'):\n\n ((string-match "^xterm" (getenv "TERM"))\n;; done by aj 8/92.

I am using the GLX widget + athena widgets on a mixed-model\napplication, under 4Dwm, but when the dialog gets popped up, its\ntext entry field does not have focus. Aimilar code works perfectly if\nI use "pure X" (no mixed-model). HEre is the relevant portion of\nthe code.\n\n{\n   int n;\n   Arg wargs[16];\n   Widget Button, PopUpShell, Dialog;\n\n   /* initialize TopLevel here */\n   .\n   .\n   .\n\n   n = 0;\n   XtSetArg(wargs[n], XtNlabel, "Foo"); n++;\n   Button = XtCreateManagedWidget("FooBtn", commandWidgetClass,\n                                  TopLevel, wargs, n);\n\n   PopUpShell = XtCreatePopupShell("PupShell", overrideShellWidgetClass,\n                                   Button, NULL, 0);\n   XtAddCallback(PopUpShell, XtNcallback, MyPopUp, (XtPointer)PopUpShell);\n\n   n = 0;\n   XtSetArg(wargs[n], XtNvalue, ""); n++;\n   Dialog = XtCreateManagedWidget("TheDialog", dialogWidgetClass,\n                                  PopUpShell, wargs, n);\n\n   .\n   .\n   .\n}\n\nvoid MyPopUp(w, popup_shell, call_data)\nWidget w;\nWidget popup_shell;\nXtPointer call_data;\n{\n   XtPopup(popup_shell, XtGrabExclusive);\n}\n\n---\n\nA way I found to give focus to the text field is to move the\napplication window around a little bit and place it right behind the popup.
There are several products you might investigate.  If you've got\n$20,000 per seat and high-end hardware, Gain Momentum might be a good\nchoice.  It isn't compatible with HyperCard, but has a similar\narchitecture (and *way* more functionality).  I don't have contact\ninformation, but they were recently purchased by Sybase who shouldn't\nbe too hard to find.\n\nIf you're running News on SPARC, check out HyperLook\n(hyperlook@turing.com).  It uses Postscript as a scripting language\nwhich is good if you need to do lots of display oriented scripting,\nbut not so good for non-programmers.  It was $995, last I heard.\n\nYou might also look at our product MetaCard.  We're alpha-testing\ndirect importing of HyperCard stacks (we've even made the test release\navailable for anonymous FTP), so we're obviously the closest in\nfunctionality.  MetaCard runs on most UNIX workstations and costs\n$495.  Email to info@metacard.com for more details.\n  Scott

I think you will find that the active Linux and 386BSD communities are\n  populated by enthusiasts who would object to paying *any* money for software.\n  Otherwise, they would probably have gone for a commercial Unix.\n  An important factor in the Linux community is that source code is always\n  available (this is probably similar in the 386BSD community, however, I'm not\n  really involved there). Many people using Linux like to stay at the cutting\n  (bleeding) edge: ie. when kernel patches, C library or compiler patches come\n  out, people like to rebuild their entire systems. The prime requirement for\n  all Linux software is that it is available under a GNU style public license.\n  Hence, Linux software uses either the Athena widgets or XView.\n  Individuals may write software requiring Motif, but I doubt it is widely\n  adopted.\n\n				Regards,

I need help binding some value to the HOME and END keys on my keyboard.  I have an\nrs/6000 w/ aix3.2.3ext running X11R5pl19 mit dist.  I'm using a PC running eXceed\nfor windows as my xterminal.  The HOME and END keys do not send a value, and my\napplication needs them to be defined.  I used this in my Xdefaults to define the\nkeys:\n\nvarnet*VT100.Translations: #override \\n    <Key>Home: string("\033[8~") \n\\n    <Key>End: string("\033[7~")\n\nThen I xterm -name varnet.  This works perfect, however the 7 and the 1 key on my\nkeypad are also defined as \033[8~ and \033[7~.\n\nAny ideas?  Help please.\n\nThanks.

I specifically made the above comment assuming that perhaps the code fragment\ncame from a simple "open-draw-quit" client.  \n\nAs per your question: why not have the button handler add the object, and\nthen call the "window_redraw()" (or whatever) directly?

Hi. I'm trying to figure out how to make a window manager\nplace the window where the create window command tells it,\nregardless of what it may think is right.

Window placement on screen\n--------------------------\n\nI would like to configure my system (a HP UNIX) to avoid that any corner\nof a given window is displayed outside of the visible screen. The whole\nwindow should be visible and it should be impossible to move any window\noutside the visible aerea.\n\n1. Can this be done by configuring the window manager's resources\n\n2. Can this be done on applikation level \n\n3. A hardcoded solution is possible, but is it possible to have a\n  upper limit of a given window size
I used to think this way, and not just about X. For example, incorrect\nEnglish constructs such as "its raining" or "it's window id" annoy me.\nHowever, there comes a time when popular usage starts to dictate the way\nthings really are in the world. Indeed, the fact that X won out over NeWS\nwas really down to popular opinion (I know, we all think it's(!) technically\nsuperior as well!).\n\nOn a related topic, who is to say that "color" is more or less correct\nthan "colour" - being Irish, and hence using English English as opposed\nto American English, I always use the latter except, of course, for API\nterms such as "XAllocColor" and "colormap".\n\nIn a world that uses the term "Windows" to refer to Microsoft Windows,\nperhaps the time has come to accept "X Windows" as a valid term for X.\nI think that this is a more concise and uncluttered term than, say,\n"the X Window System" and, let's face it, almost everyone uses it.\nUltimately, we all need product sales to more than just X-literate\npeople. In this respect, product recognition is important and a short,\nsnappy, descriptive title ("X" is positively obscure) will help\nwhen dealing with the average punter (it's sad - I thought I was a\nsoftware engineer!). Indeed it is unfortunate that X did not become\npopularly known as Windows and let MS worry about whether it should\nbe called "Microsoft Windows" or "the Microsoft Window System" or\nhow about just plain "Microsoft"!\n\nTo summarise (or should that be "summarize") the point of this message:\nI think there are far more pressing issues facing the X community than\nworrying about subtle distinctions in the naming of the window system\n(or should that be "windowing system"). Whatever gets recognised is\nfine by me. I agree that one should be careful in interpreting what\ntrade papers say. However, I would be reluctant to come to this\nconclusion purely on the basis of how they name the X Window System.
#\n#I have a question regarding the processing of program arguments\n#such as the -geometry option. Since this is a standard X option, \n#I'm wondering wether I have to parse it manually or whether there\n#is some predefined function that will do this for me?\n#\n\nIf you are using the Intrinsics, it is parsed for you.  If you are working\nat the Xlib level, you can parse it yourself or you can use the following\nbit of code.\n\nstatic XrmOptionDescRec options[] = {\n	{"-geometry",	".geometry",	XrmoptionSepArg, (XPointer)NULL}\n};\n\n#define Number(x)	(sizeof(x)/sizeof(x[0]))\nXrmParseCommand(db, options, Number(options), "MyApplication", &argc, argv);\n\nThen use XrmGetResource() to retrieve the value and parse it using\nXParseGeometry().\n\nIt is probably quicker to parse it yourself from argv, however, I much prefer\nusing the X resource management routines to do this.\n\nPatrick L.

Hi, \n\nI'm trying to write a Motif program on an Interactive Unix machine, and I'm\nobserving very strange behavior when my program attempts to expose a\nDrawingArea. Namely, some Xlib operations work, and some do not. In\nparticular, the expose consist of two XFillRectangle calls followed by some\nXDrawPoint calls, and for reasons unknown to me the point calls are failing\nwhenever a pulldown or popup up menu is (clicked on and) moved in the\nrightward direction over the drawing area, but after the move, is still on\nsome part of the drawing area. This also happens less consistently when the\npulldown/popup is moved in the leftward direction.\n\nAssuming that my code is not doing anything incredibly odd, is this a server\nbug?\n\nThanks,
I have the same problem.  I have looked at Motif++, WWL, InterViews, GINA++,\nand a few variations on the above.  I've also done a cursory examination\nof Rogue Wave's View.h++.  I like View.h++'s abstractions best of all of the\ntoolkits I mentioned, but the resulting code looks little like Motif, and I\nhave little confidence that this software will catch on or otherwise result\nin significant longevity for my code.  GINA++ allows you to write code which\nlooks a great deal like Motif and also makes interesting use of inheritance,\nbut the resulting code is almost too Motif-like, and is certainly not\nsignificantly less verbose than equivalent C code.  InterViews looks\npromising, but I haven't found a free version with Motif support, and I'm\nnot confident how widely InterViews with Motif support will be adopted,\nand what (if any) specific Motif support will be available over time.  The\nother libraries produce code which is less Motif-like, but which does not make\nsufficient use of the features of C++ to simplify my coding task.\n\nAt this point, my inclination is to write my Motif manipulation routines in\nC, and invoke those routines from my C++ code using simple abstractions suited\nto my specific task.  Later, if OSF or some credible standards-setting body\ncomes up with a C++ interface to Motif, I will change to that.  It does me\nno goo to write in C++ if my choice of interfaces leaves me with code which\nleaves me tied to an abstraction which is not consistent with the industry\ndirections.  It's better to take a standard if inferior solution for now\nthan to go with a slgihtly superior approach which will leave me with both\nuseless code and useless skills a few years from now.  Views.h++ is the only\nlibrary I'd consider right now, but in our environment, we'd end up spending\nnearly $5000 to use it, and I can't justify it when it's likely to cause\nshort-term productivity decreases as we learn the new abstraction, and is\nunlikely to be a sufficiently long-lived solution for us to reap the benefits\nat the high end of the J curve.\n\n- Brad
Hello Everybody!\n\nI have a little question:\n\nDue to more features (PEX, Drag&Drop) many applications when linked with for\nexample Motif 1.2 instead Motif 1.1 need more memory in the Xserver.\nX-terminals only have limited memory (normally no swapping possible). So my\nquestion:\n\nIs there a possibility to determine via X protocol calls the size of free\nmemory available to the Xserver?\n\nSo one can determine for example whether to start a PEX application with the\nCSS on client side or on server side (when there is enough memory).\n\nPlease reply via e-mail, I'll summarize!\n\nSincerly,\n        Matthias

If you are not a\nSUG member, you can become one for an additional $40 if you live\nwithin the US or $55 outside.\n\nThe SUG 1992.1 CDROM is an ISO 9660 disk (which means it can be used\nby PC, Macintosh, and other workstations as well), and contains a\ntotal of 543MB of material, including:\n\nX11R5 SOURCES AND CORE BINARIES (for SPARC) as of several weeks after\nthe initial distribution, thus, four fixes and the the MIT contrib-0\ndistribution are included (109MB of material).

I have the following problem on X11R5 servers.\n\nWhen a window of my is obscured by a pop up window which has\nthe Save Under attribute set, the subwindows of my window are not restored.\n\nNormally, the subwindows are redrawn when the parent window gets an expose\nevent, but because the save under attribute is used for the pop up window\nthat obscured my window, no expose event is sent.\n\nWhen ExposureMask is set for the child windows, those windows are correctly\nupdated when the popup window disappears, however then the application\ngets too many expose events and you see extra redraws.\n\nEverything works fine with X11R4.\n\nIs this something that is changed between X11R4 and X11R5 (obvious)?\nIs it something I do wrong?\nIs there something that the popup window should do (which is also mine)?\nIs this a bug in X11 release 5?\n\nGreetings,\n--

[LLat. obfuscare, to darken : ob(intensive) +\nX		Lat. fuscare, to darken < fuscus, dark.] -obfuscation n.\nX		obfuscatory adj.\nX\nX\nXGOALS OF THE CONTEST:\nX\nX    * To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below.\nX    * To show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way.\nX    * To stress C compilers with unusual code.\nX    * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language.\nX    * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-)\nX\nX\nXRULES:\nX\nX    To help us with the volume of entries, we ask that you follow these rules:\nX\nX    1) Your entry must be a complete program.\nX\nX    2) Your entry must be <= 3217 bytes in length.  The number of characters\nX       excluding whitespace (tab, space, newline), and excluding any ; { or }\nX       followed by either whitespace or end of file, must be <= 1536.\nX\nX    3) Your entry must be submitted in the following format:\nX\nX---entry---\nXrule:	1993\nXfix:	y or n   (n => this is a new entry, y => this replaces an older entry)\nXtitle:	title of entry  		    (see comments below)\nXentry:	Entry number from 0 to 7 inclusive  (your 1st entry should by 0)\nXdate:	Date/time of submission in UTC	    (see comments below)\nXhost:	Machine(s) and OS(s) under which your entry was tested\nX	Use tab indented lines if needed\nX---remark---\nX    Place remarks about this entry in this section.  It would be helpful if\nX    you were to indent your remarks with 4 spaces, though it is not a\nX    requirement.  Also, if possible, try to avoid going beyond the 79th\nX    column.  Blank lines are permitted.\nX---author---\nXname:	your name\nXorg:	School/Company/Organization\nXaddr:	postal address\nX	use tab indented lines to continue\nX	don't forget to include the country\nXemail:  Email address from a well known site or registered domain.\nX        If you give several forms, list them on separate tab indented lines.\nXanon:	y or n   (y => remain anonymous, n => ok to publish this info)\nX---info---\nXIf your program needs an info file, place a uuencoded copy of it in\nXthis section.  In the case of multiple info files, use multiple info\nXsections.  If your entry does not need a info file, skip this section.\nX---build---\nXPlace a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compile/build your program\nXin this section.  It must uudecode into a file named 'build'.  The resulting\nXfile must be 255 bytes or less.\nX---program---\nXPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section.  It must uudecode\nXinto a file named is 'prog.c'.  The resulting file must follow rule #2.\nX---end---\nX\nX      Regarding the above format:\nX\nX	* The title must match the expression: [a-zA-Z0-9_=][a-zA-Z0-9_=+-]*\nX	  and must be 1 to 12 characters in length.\nX\nX	  It is suggested, but not required, that the title should\nX	  incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors,\nX	  consider using parts of the usernames of the authors.\nX\nX	* The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect\nX	  to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime() \nX	  using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info)\nX\nX	* You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending\nX	  it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set 'fix' in the \nX	  ---entry--- section to 'n'.  The corrected entry must use the same \nX	  title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be \nX	  sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well.\nX\nX	* With the exception of the header, all text outside of the above \nX	  format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges\nX	  something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separate\nX	  Email message to the judges.\nX\nX	* Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless \nX	  'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line.\nX\nX	* To credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for\nX	  each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line, and\nX	  should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections.\nX\nX	* The entry's remarks should include:\nX	    - what this program does\nX	    - how to run the program (sample args or input)\nX	    - special compile or execution instructions, if any\nX	    - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5)\nX	    - information about any ---data--- files\nX	    - why you think the program is obfuscated\nX	    - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry.\nX	    - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise)\nX\nX	* Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certain\nX	  portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award.\nX\nX        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They \nX	  should not be required to exist.\nX\nX	  If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info---\nX	  section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple \nX	  ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe\nX	  each info file in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows:\nX\nX	   'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed\nX	   'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional\nX	       digit, followed by '.c'\nX	   your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's\nX	       title, possibly followed by a digit\nX\nX       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your\nX       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a\nX       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of\nX       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed\nX       by a digit, followed by '.sh'.\nX\nX       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must\nX       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames.\nX\nX    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be\nX       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files,\nX       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this\nX       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks.\nX\nX    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected.\nX       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not \nX       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers.\nX\nX    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the\nX       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected.\nX\nX    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.  (UTC is\nX       essentially equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time)  Email your entries to:\nX\nX		...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!obfuscate\nX		obfuscate@toad.com\nX\nX       We request that your message use the subject 'ioccc entry'.\nX\nX       If possible, we request that you hold off on Emailing your entries\nX       until 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.  Early entries will be accepted, however.\nX       We will attempt to email a confirmation to the the first author for\nX       all entries received after 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.\nX\nX    9) Each person may submit up to 8 entries per contest year.  Each entry\nX       must be sent in a separate Email letter.\nX\nX   10) Entries requiring human interaction to be built are not allowed.  \nX       Compiling an entry produce a file (or files) which may be executed.\nX\nX   11) Programs that require special privileges (setuid, setgid, super-user,\nX       special owner or group) are not allowed.\nX    \nX\nXFOR MORE INFORMATION:\nX\nX    The Judging will be done by Landon Noll and Larry Bassel.

The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions.\nX    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are\nX    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.\nX\nX    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries.\nX    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.\nX\nX\nXWHAT IS NEW IN 1993:\nX\nX    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c\nX    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT.\nX\nX    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C\nX    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers \nX    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with \nX    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor \nX    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES.\nX\nX\nXHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS:\nX\nX    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See\nX    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners.\nX\nX    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries\nX    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year\nX    might be 'old' the next year.\nX\nX    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply\nX    a number of tests to an entry:\nX\nX	* look at the original source\nX	* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII\nX	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines\nX	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines\nX	* run it through a C beautifier\nX	* examine the algorithm\nX	* lint it\nX	* compile it\nX	* execute it\nX\nX    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.\nX    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been\nX    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier.\nX\nX    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain\nX    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the\nX    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as\nX    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given\nX    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that\nX    does something interesting when you run it.\nX\nX    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave\nX    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life\nX    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request\nX    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the\nX    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.\nX\nX    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know\nX    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse\nX    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the\nX    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to\nX    annoy more than amuse.\nX\nX    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries\nX    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules'\nX    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use\nX    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-)\nX\nX    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make\nX    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly\nX    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some\nX    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work.\nX\nX    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that\nX    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off\nX    documenting it.  Noting "this entry sometimes prints the 4th power\nX    of a prime by mistake" would save the above entry.  And sometimes,\nX    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly\nX    working entry is best.\nX\nX\nXOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES:\nX\nX    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We\nX    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests\nX    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far\nX    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.\nX\nX    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we:\nX\nX	#define d define\nX	#d foo		   <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo\nX\nX	int i;\nX	j;		   <-- don't use such implicit type declaration\nX	int k;\nX\nX    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you \nX    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in \nX    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers.\nX\nX    Unfortunately, ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type.\nX    Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed:\nX\nX	int i;\nX	char *c;\nX	i[c];		   <--- use c[i] instead\nX	(i+3)["string"];   <--- use "string"[i+3] instead\nX\nX    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of\nX    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety\nX    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are\nX    not portable and must not be used:\nX\nX	* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable\nX	* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable\nX	* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg\nX	* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg\nX	* performing arithmetic on va_list variables\nX	* using va_list as a structure or union\nX\nX    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s.\nX\nX    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead.\nX\nX    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...),\nX    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some\nX    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not.\nX\nX    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries\nX    must not assume that it returns an int.\nX\nX    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.\nX    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do\nX    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people\nX    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for\nX    programs that are compact, and are instructional.\nX\nX    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80\nX    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.\nX\nX    We tend to dislike programs that:\nX\nX	* are very hardware specific\nX	* are very OS or Un*x version specific\nX	     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific\nX	      code is likely not to be)\nX	* dump core or have compiler warnings\nX	     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item)\nX	* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x\nX	* abusing the build file to get around the size limit\nX	* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs\nX	* are longer than they need to be\nX	* are similar to previous winners\nX	* are identical to previous losers  :-)\nX\nX    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the\nX    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program\nX    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.\nX\nX    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size\nX    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out,\nX    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to\nX    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel\nX    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off\nX    if you show some amount of restraint.\nX\nX    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact\nX    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get\nX    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.\nX\nX    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob\nX    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C\nX    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third\nX    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting\nX    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!\nX\nX    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating'\nX    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim\nX    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating\nX    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating.\nX    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others)\nX    know of a smaller one!\nX\nX    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that\nX    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't\nX    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend\nX    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store.\nX\nX    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and\nX    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client\nX    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the\nX    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a).\nX    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone\nX    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not\nX    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or\nX    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better\nX    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems.\nX\nX    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on\nX    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines\nX    in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    We like programs that:\nX\nX	* are as concise and small as they need to be\nX	* do something at least quasi-interesting\nX	* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice)\nX	* are portable\nX	* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style\nX	* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION\nX	* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-)\nX\nX    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your\nX    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several\nX    areas really does help.\nX\nX    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in\nX    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to\nX    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.\nX    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well.\nX\nX    Be creative!\nX\nX\nXENTRY FORMAT:\nX\nX    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your\nX    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format,\nX    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the\nX    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS)\nX\nX    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to\nX    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that\nX    is found in mkentry.c:\nX\nX	This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every\nX	attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces\nX	an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases,\nX	where this program differs from the contest rules, the\nX	contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the\nX	contest rules before submitting an entry.\nX\nX    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however,\nX    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check\nX    the entry against the size rules.\nX\nX    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about\nX    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.  (see below)\nX\nX    The following is a sample entry:\nX\nX---entry---\nXrule:	1993\nXfix:	n\nXtitle:	chonglab\nXentry:	0\nXdate:	Mon Mar  1 08:45:20 1993\nXhost:	Un*x v6, pdp11/45\nX	2.9BSD, pdp11/70\nX---remark---\nX    This is a non-obfuscated obfuscated C program.\nX\nX    It is likely not to win a prize.

If an entry wins, we will rename\nX    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition,\nX    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optional\nX    digit in case of name conflicts.\nX\nX    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award,\nX    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab.\nX\nX    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source\nX    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the\nX    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful\nX    if you did one of the following:\nX\nX	* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry.\nX\nX	* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example:\nX\nX		cc prog.c -o special_name		need special binary\nX\nX	    or  rm -f special_src.c			need special source\nX		cp prog.c special_src.c\nX		cc special_src.c -o special_name\nX\nX	    or  rm -f special_build			need special build\nX		tail +4 build > special_build\nX		sh < special_build\nX\nX	* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of \nX	  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You \nX	  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections.\nX\nX    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files,\nX    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid\nX    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should\nX    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This\nX    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch.\nX\nX    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We\nX    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the\nX    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them\nX    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files,\nX    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed,\nX    then skip the ---info--- section.\nX\nX    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that\nX    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an\nX    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample\nX    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a\nX    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a\nX    'hints' file.\nX\nX    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For\nX    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed\nX    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental,\nX    the entry should not require them exist.\nX\nX    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name\nX    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason,\nX    say so in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they\nX    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say\nX    so in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has\nX    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should\nX    have entry number 0.\nX\nX    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry\nX    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the\nX    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't\nX    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the \nX    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at:\nX\nX	...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges	(not the address for\nX	judges@toad.com					 submitting entries)\nX    \nX    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer \nX    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as \nX    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is:\nX\nX	Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993\nX\nX    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The\nX    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many \nX    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string:\nX\nX	date -u "+%a %h %d %T 19%y"\nX	date -u | sed -e 's/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/'\nX	sh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e "s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/"'\nX	sh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e "s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/"'\nX	sh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e "s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/"'\nX\nX    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set\nX    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'.\nX    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number\nX    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be\nX    replaced.\nX\nX\nXJUDGING PROCESS:\nX\nX    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll.\nX\nX    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message\nX    is unpacked into individual files, each containing:\nX\nX	---entry--- section\nX	all ---author--- sections\nX	all ---info--- sections\nX	---build--- section\nX	---program--- section\nX	any other text, including the Email message headers\nX\nX    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure\nX    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was\nX    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the\nX    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is\nX    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award.\nX\nX    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular\nX    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are\nX    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding\nX    out in the end, who won and where they were from.\nX\nX    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award.\nX    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all\nX    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning\nX    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even\nX    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious,\nX    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC\nX    winners at talks)\nX\nX    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the\nX    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give\nX    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their\nX    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We\nX    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well.\nX    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world.\nX\nX    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round,\nX    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles;\nX    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does\nX    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the\nX    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings.\nX\nX    A reading consists of a number of actions:\nX\nX	* reading the ---entry--- section\nX	* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section\nX	* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section\nX	* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any\nX	* passing the source thru the C pre-processor\nX	    shipping over any #include files\nX	* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source\nX	* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor\nX	    shipping over any #include files\nX\nX    In later rounds, other actions are performed:\nX\nX	* linting the source\nX	* compiling/building the source\nX	* running the program\nX	* performing misc tests on the source and binary\nX\nX    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries\nX    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it\nX    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.\nX    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form\nX    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards.\nX    An entry often will compete in several categories.\nX\nX    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries\nX    we receive.  A typical category list might be:\nX\nX	* best small one line program\nX	* best small program\nX	* strangest/most creative source layout\nX	* most useful obfuscated program\nX	* best game that is obfuscated\nX	* most creatively obfuscated program\nX	* most deceptive C code\nX	* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES)\nX	* best abuse of ANSI C\nX	* worst abuse of the rules\nX	* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award>\nX\nX    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so\nX    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.\nX    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.\nX\nX    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of\nX    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10\nX    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into\nX    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not\nX    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is\nX    less clear cut.\nX\nX    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out\nX    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is\nX    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry \nX    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course, \nX    that the entry is worth improving in the first place!\nX\nX    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a\nX    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest\nX    rules in some way.\nX\nX    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such\nX    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the\nX    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories.\nX\nX\nXANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS:\nX\nX    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition,\nX    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to\nX    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF.\nX\nX    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups:\nX\nX	    comp.lang.c		  comp.unix.wizards	alt.sources\nX\nX    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following\nX\nX	    comp.sources.d	  alt.sources.d		misc.misc\nX	    comp.sources.misc	  comp.windows.x\nX\nX    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See\nX    below for details.\nX\nX    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners \nX    have appeared in books ("The New Hackers Dictionary") and on T-Shirts.\nX\nX    Last, but not least, winners receive international fame and flames!  :-)\nX\nX\nXFOR MORE INFORMATION:\nX\nX    You may contact the judges by sending Email to the following address:\nX\nX	...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges	(not the address for\nX	judges@toad.com					 submitting entries)\nX\nX    Questions and comments about the contest are welcome.\nX\nX    One may obtain a copy of the current rules, guidelines or mkentry\nX    program.

Dear SGI and netter GL-X Mixed-Model experts,\nI am writing a mixed model application that creates a couple different\ncolor maps for different windows, and I've been having trouble getting\nthe window manager to reliably honor my requests.  In some environments\n(entry level R3000 Indigo w/ 4.0.5) all windows are getting properly\nconnected to their designated color maps, but on others (an IRIS 4D 240/GTX;\nalso a different entry level Indigo) the color mapping is unreliable\nand changes behavior when I compile at different times.  The most common\nproblem is that all non-top-level windows fail to be displayed according\nto their colormap.  My application starts out by creating three top-level\nwindows; in some cases all but the first of these also fail to be\ndisplayed by their colormap.  This is spectacularly aggravating.\n\nI would dearly appreciate\n  1. an explanation of the standard, RIGHT, CORRECT way to give a window\n  a colormap such that the Window Manager will Honor and Obey it;\n\n  2. any advice about problems that could cause my failure to get my\n  desired colormaps.\n\nBy now I have exhausted my own attempts on this, having tried everything\nreasonable or imaginable.\n\nBelow is example code giving the schematic for how I have been *TRYING*\nto do this.  Please, please, please SOMEBODY tell me what I am doing\nwrong/how to do it right!!!\n\n\nYours,\n\nChris Lee\n\n/***********************************************************************/\nDisplay* dpy;  /* DECLARE SOME DATA... */\nColormap popup_cmap;\nXColor mycolor;\nWindow win;\nXSetWindowAttributes cwa;\nint nwlist;\nWindow *wlist;\n\n/* NB: FOR BREVITY, NOT SHOWING ALL CODE LINES--JUST A SCHEMATIC */\n\npopup_cmap=XCreateColormap(dpy,DefaultRootWindow(dpy),vis->visual,AllocAll);\n\n/* HERE WE STORE A BUNCH OF COLORS USING\n   XStoreColor(dpy,popup_cmap,&mycolor); ... */\n\ncwa.colormap = popup_cmap;\nwin = XCreateWindow(dpy, parent, x, y, w, h,\n                    borderWidth, vis->depth, InputOutput, vis->visual,\n                    CWColormap|CWBorderPixel, &cwa);\n\n\n/* LIST ALL SUB WINDOWS OF my_topwin, PARENT OF win, INTO wlist;\n   nwlist IS COUNTER OF ENTRIES IN wlist.\n\n   NB: wlist is static storage that can be relied on not to go away\n       or be corrupted.

A colleague has a bizarre font problem on his new MIPS workstation.\nWhen he first logs on (via xdm), he has a single xterm window appear\nwith the mwm window manager running.  In this configuration, X windows\napplications (particularly xdvi) work fine.  However, if he opens up a\nsecond xterm application, suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window,\ngiving the error: Unable to load ISO 8859-1 font.\n\n   The only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial\none references a different name in the Xsession file, with prettier\ncolours and other slight changes.  Further investigation shows that only\nopening a default xterm causes this behaviour, and more significant, ALL\nX applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the\ncommand line in either window.  If I start the xterm with a different\nfont (using the -fn option), no problems.  It would seem that the\ndefault xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose\nall of its fonts.  Note: xlsfonts in either window shows all of the\nfonts available, so there doesn't appear to be a problem in the font\ndirectories/hash-tables.\n\n   Other than rewriting the XTerm app-defaults file to use a different\nfont and hope for the best, does anyone have any ideas?
There is no easy answer to this question: it depends on whether the display\ndevice can hold pixmaps in off-screen memory, and if so, how efficiently\nthe server manages these resources (having to deal with limited off-screen\nmemory is the bane of the server implementor's existence!).  \n\nI have worked with graphics devices where the off-screen memory to \nmain display copy rate eclipses that of the main memory to display copy\nrate, and with those where the main memory to display is *faster* than\noff-screen to display (requires only a write to the framebuffer rather\nthan a read of the F.B. followed by a write)\n\nIf your server uses the cfb code or something like it to render into\npixmaps in CPU main memory, the rates you can get through MIT-SHM are\nlikely to be equal (maybe a tad slower, depending on your OS's implementation\nof shared memory) to CopyArea from pixmap to window, which is also then\njust a copy from CPU main memory to graphics device.\n\nOne advanage of MIT-SHM is that if your images are large, you don't end up\ngrowing the size of the server process to hold them.\n\nOne disadvantage of the MIT-SHM is that, in its sample implementation,\nthere is no provision for elegantly cleaning up the shared memory segments\nif the client dies a sudden, violent death (e.g., "kill").  You have to \nbe mindful of cluttering up the system with zombie shared memory segments.\n\n	Ken
Does anyone know of an X server for character cell terminals?\nDoesn't have to be anything fancy, as long is it works.
I need to have PCs and SPARCstations run the same application ( namely\nMicroSoft Project ). The original system ran on the PC. Now it needs to\nbe expanded to allow UNIX users to work with the application. The\ncurrent proposal is to use DESQview/X as a display server for the\napplication.\n\nI would like to know your experiences with using DESQview/X to run an\napplication on a PC and displaying on a SPARCstation. I've heard that\nthe network traffic is slow.\n\nReplies only by e-mail please.\n\nThanks, in advance.
Yes, it's possible... in fact, there's some gl widget code in\n/usr/lpp/GL somewhere... (it's named Glib.c; my IBM's down right now\nthough, so I can't find the exact location :)\n\n  WARNING: this code feels quite bogus. It does things like calling\nnoport() before winopen(), and then extracting an X window id from it\nanyway. It worked just fine under aix 3.1; I spent last weekend trying\nto port it to 3.2 (gl under 3.2 doesn't seem to like it), and it's\nturning into a Hard Job.\n\n  Check out your "info" pages; it has some pretty good documentation on\nwhan you can and can't do when mixing gl and X, and how to go about\ndoing so.
Does USL SVR4 support LD_RUN_PATH a la Solaris 2?\nOr an equivalent?\n\nIf so, you can put the library in a package specific lib directory,\ncompile the app with LD_RUN_PATH defined, and all should work.\n\nBesides, I'd say name it libPACKAGExcl.a if possible.\n\nCheers,

If you're willing to do a little work, you can make DrawnButtons do what you\nwant, more-or-less. One of my colleagues here at GE CRD has done just that\nin our internal LYMB system.\n\nWe have a matrix transform class that makes it easy to compute a series of\ndial positions from a single set of vectors. Each set of vectors is then\ndrawn into a pixmap. Clicking the button advances the knob's state and\nchanges to the next pixmap in the sequence.\n\nUsing DrawnButtons obviously still constrains you to taking up a rectangular\nportion of the parent widget, but that's normally not a big shortcoming. You\ncan make things look circular enough.

I'm running X under openwindows 3.  Normal X programs not having a\nfont specified always show up in the same font - until I change the\nfontpath, and restart windows - then a new default font is used until\nthe next change.  I can't seem to figure out how it chooses.  Is there\nsome way to set this?  Possibly something in .Xdefaults???\n\nPlease reply in direct email - I summarize.
The situation: running a Fortran executable that creats an Xterm.  An option\nin the menu contained in the Xterm runs a Fortran subroutine that creats\na Tektronics-mode Xterm for displaying some graphics.  Typing a <RET> while\nthe Tektronics-mode Xterm (future reference to this will be "Tek-term") is\nactive makes the Xterm read future keystrokes but does not shift input focus\nto the Xterm (I'm basing that statement on the fact that the border of the \nTek-term stays the highlighted color and that the Tek-term stays on top of\nXterm.  If what I'm describing isn't input focus, let me know.)  \n\nThe xterm can be brought to the top by clicking the mouse button on it.\n\nSubsequent selections from the Xterm of the menu item that displays graphics \nhighlihts the border and displays the updated graphics, but does not move \nthe Tek-term to the top.  If the Tek-term has been iconized to conserve \nscreen space, it stays an icon.\n\n\nThe desired behavior: one of two options - \n\n    1. Whichever of the windows that is active is always on top of the \n       inactive one.\n\n    2. Whenever the Tek-term is inactivated, it should revert to a icon\n       but when it is activated it should become a window on a higher \n       level than the Xterm.\n\nWhat I think I need: a means of specifying that a Xterm or Tek-term will\nbe at the highest level and a way to iconify/expand a Xterm and Tek-term.\nThese commands, would, I'd guess, need to be in the Fortran or in the \ncommand that starts up the Xterm and Tek-term.\n\nOther information: All this is taking place on a VT-1300 (a DEC dumb \nX-windows terminal) connected to a VAX running VMS and Motif.\n\nThanks for your time.  If you've got any words of wisdom (other than \n"give up" ;-), please send email to

There's really no simple way to tell this is the case.\n\nYou can take xdm out of secure mode;  probably not too cool.\n\nYou can wrap your call to XOpenDisplay in some code which solicts\na future SIGALRM and longjmps past the XOpenDisplay from the signal\nhandler.

[stuff delete]\n\nHear! Hear! I agree completely. One thing I can't stand about\nthe Mac interface is its shear determination to FORCE you to use\nthe mouse(what if your mouse breaks--your whole system is\ndown!).  I like the mouse--it is handy on some occassions such\nas cut and past and moving icons around, etc.  But for most\nwork, the keyboard and hot keys are 10-20 times faster than\nusing the mouse. Sure it is a plus to be able to do something\nsimple if you are an inexperienced user, but how long is it\nbefore your are experienced? A month? Two? (Speaking of PCs at\nthe moment.)\n	I don't think it is too much to ask that window\nprogrammers provide not only a menu/mouse interface but also\nlook forward to those who would like to move on to hot keys and\ncommand line interfaces, which usually allows you to do more in\nless time IF you are experienced.\n	All of the above equally applies to windowing systems on\nUNIX (especially since Unix is at least 500% more powerful than\nDOS).

Because the window\nmanager does not know about this, you cannot move, resize etc. it. xv in the\nmean time is busy changing your root window to whatever you have requested\nbut you never get to see it because VUE's window is overlaid on top of the root\nwindow. \n\nContact HP support and see whether VUE can support coloured bitmap format\nsuch as xpm, if they cant then they probably create all their coloured\nbackdrops inside the code.

[Please accept the following announcement for comp.windows.x.announce. -gf]\n\nA completely revamped version of the X11 browser interface to Archie,\nXarchie, is now available as\n	export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/xarchie-2.0.tar.Z\n\nFor those not familar with Archie or Xarchie, I include part of the\nmanpage intro:\n\n  Xarchie is an X11 browser interface to the Archie Internet information\n  system using the Prospero virtual filesystem protocol.  Archie\n  provides information about files available for ftp anywhere on the\n  Internet; Xarchie displays this information using an easy-to-use,\n  point-and-click interface.  Xarchie allows you to further explore ftp\n  sites by examining directories returned as query matches, and allows\n  you to retrieve files located this way.\n\nXarchie 2.0 has been extensively tested on R4, R5, and a variety of\nother flavors of X, and on a wide range of machines. A summary of the\nnew features (from the README) follows:\n\n  * Major improvements include:\n    - Multiple selections allowed in browser for use with other new\n      features (FWF MultiList widget).\n    - Ability to expand directories in browser.\n    - Real fully-integrated ftp implementation.\n    - Ability to save and reload query results, as well as print them.\n    - Ability to resort results, and sort results by user-definable\n      pseudo-weights.\n    - Online help browser.\n    - Color resources, done so that they don't break mono displays.\n    - FWF FileSelector widget for local file operations.\n    - Makefile.dst's supplied for the imake-impaired.\n\nGeorge

The only time I've seen similar behaviour is when an X application forked a child\nwithout setting close on exec on the X display connection file descriptor.\nThe shell waited for a ConfigureNotify event that never arrived because it got\npicked up by the child.  Sometimes the shell correctly got the ConfigureNotify if\nthe timing was 'right'.

I don't know any way except to see what modifiers are on in th\nKeypress event.  Of course if there is some reason why you need to\nalways know the state of modifiers even if your windows don't have the\nkeyborads focus you can always ask for KeyPress events from the root\nwindow.  Then you get all the KeyPresses and you always know what have\nbeen pressed.\n\n\nI think this is just a question of how to implement XLookupString.\nYou can always write another function that interprets the KeyPresses\nas you like.  You can look at the implementation of XLookupString from\nthe Xlib sources and then modify it a little bit.
Hello, \n\n	way back in the mists of time, I had a set of patches written\nby Richard Caley (I believe to the standars distribution, patch level\n6) which added regular expressions in the .tvtwmrc file, multiple icon\nregions, squeezable icons, and f.deleteordestroy function.

The shared memory segment\ngets allocated and attached to the process with no problem.\nBut the program crashes at the first call to XShmPutImage,\nwith the following message:\n\nX Error of failed request:  BadShmSeg (invalid shared segment parameter)\n  Major opcode of failed request:  133 (MIT-SHM)\n  Minor opcode of failed request:  3 (X_ShmPutImage)\n  Segment id in failed request 0x0\n  Serial number of failed request:  741\n  Current serial number in output stream:  742\n\nLike I said, I did error checking on all the calls to shmget\nand shmat that are necessary to create the shared memory\nsegment, as well as checking XShmAttach.  There are no\nproblems.\n\nIf anybody has had the same problem or has used MIT-SHM without\nhaving the same problem, please let me know.\n\nBy the way, I am running OpenWindows 3.0 on a Sun Sparc2.

Hi!\n\nI remember reading (or hallucinating) that NCD's PC-Xremote functionality had \nbeen given, by NCD, to MIT for inclusion in X11R6.  Is this true?  If so,\n(set mode/cheap) can I just wait for X11R6 to get compressed serial line\nX server support?\n\nThanks!

Hi,\n\nI wonder if it is possible for a parent window to paint over the area of\nits childs. If it is not, then how could it be possible to implement a \nrubberband across multiple xwindows to select the objects that are\ndisplayed one in each window?
Thanks for the many offers to review this book.\n\nIf you received a review copy, please return it\nas soon as possible.  I had a system crash and\nlost the list of people I sent it to!\n\nThanks
This may be an FAQ, but I dont know where to get the FAQ list!\nMy OpenLook application has a few buttons. The first button turns\nred(gets highlighted?) as soon as the sprite(mouse) is moved into the\napplication window. How do I suppress this?
After having OpenWindows \n(Version 3 for SunOS 4.1) or Xwindows\nrunning continuously on my machine for 3-4 days,\nthe following message appears  when trying to open\na new window, or to run any program that needs to open windows.\n\nXView error: Cannot open connection to window server: :0.0 (Server\npackage)\n\nI would greatly appreciate any suggestions to solve this problem.
As I've said before, there's no reliable way to find out the size of\nthe window manager decoration.  If your window has been reparented, you\ncan't assume that the window you're parented to is the window that\nholds all of the window manager decoration.  There may be several\nlayers of windows.  Doing multiple XQueryTree's until you get to the\nroot will work in most cases, but there's no guarantee that the outside\ndecoration window is parented to the root window of the display (tvtwm).
I have heard of two packages for the PC that support X-Win.\nThe first is Linux which is a free Unix Package.  The Second\nis X-Appeal, which sounds pretty good.  It can be found at\n garbo.uwusa.fi in the ~ftp/pc/demo/ dir.  The files are\n\n	xap13exe.zip\n	xap10fon.zip\n	drivers.zip\n\nThis should get you started.\n\nJosh.
Hi,\n\n  Please reply to me direct as I am not a member of this list.\n\n  I am new to X, so please excuse my lax (read: "probably incorrect")\nterminology!\n\n  Environment: Sun Sparc 10, SunOs 4.1.3.  X11R5 path level 23.  My X process\nis started by xdm.\n\n  i) I want to setup the backgroud (root window?) of the tvtwm display to\n     display the escherknot etc (grey is a very boring colour to work on)!\n\n     The setup is as follows:\n\n        lib/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0    -   xsetroot -bitmap ... etc\n        ~user/.xsession         -   xsetroot .... etc\n                                    tvtwm\n\n     There are also .tvtwmrc and .Xdefaults files in the (~user) home\n     directory.\n\n     The xsetroot in Xsetup_0 displays the appropriate bitmap in the xdm\n     login window as expected - very nice!\n\n     Unfortunately, when the users session is started, the background of the\n     tvtwm window reverts to grey.  If I manually type xsetroot... in an\n     xterm window when the session has started, the background is changed as\n     expected.\n\n     The question is: How do I retain the background from the login window\n     and/or specify a new background on a per-user basis as part of the\n     the users session startup?\n\n ii) When I open an Xterm on the Sparc 10, not all of the keys are recognised\n     and some keys on the keyboard are not sending the correct characters.\n\n     ie: real key       key shown on screen\n         ------------   -------------------\n         hash           back slash\n         tilde          pipe\n         double quote   at symbol\n         pound          hash\n         cursor key     not recognised\n\n     This is very annoying!  Is X at fault here or the machine setup?  I have\n     installed the xterm drivers that came with X11R5 in both terminfo and\n     termcap as they seemed more uptodate.\n\n     Typing set in an xterm window shows a terminal type of xterm - as\n     expected!\n\n  Any help on how to correct either of these problems much appreciated!\n\n  Thanks,\n\nDave.
I want to compile Xdvi and later perhaps Emacs 19 on a DEC Ultrix machine with\nX installed. Unfortunately, Xt and Xaw libs and headers are missing. How can I\nget them without having to compile the whole MIT distribution ? \n\nPleasy reply by email to: viola@yukawa.uni-muenster.de
Hi Folks.\n\nAs part of my self-introduction to X I've been trying to do some simple\nicon animation (sort of like icondoit from mswindows).  Changing your\nown applications icon is fairly simple:  If you have a widget ID you can\njust XtSetValues on XtNiconifyPixmap (or whatever) and you're done. Alternately\nyou can set window manager hints.  These methods don't seem to work with\nicons which your application doesn't specifically own.\n\nIn my situation I have to change the icon of random windows sitting there in \nmy icon box so my question is:  Given a window-id, how do you change the\nicon pixure ?  A working example would be very much appreciated.  If it makes\nany difference, I'm using motif 1.1 on VMS T6.0-5KE.
How can get a pixel value from a Drawable, without having to copy it to the client\nas an XImage and use XGetPixel ?? - I want to select pixels from an animating\nwindow on the server, without having to copy the whole lot back to my client.\n(X11R5).\n\nAny pointers appreciated,\n\nGordon.
I have a Sun 3/60 that has a mono framebuffer (bwtwo0 ?) built on the\nmotherboard.  The same system also has a cgfour (cgfour0 and bwtwo1 ?)\ndaughterboard.  I have been using this system with a color monitor having a\ncolor "front" screen from the cgfour, and a mono "back" screen from the\nbwtwo1, both on the same tube.  I recentley picked up a 1600 x 1280 Sun mono\nmonitor, and I would like to make a two headed system with the cgfour0 and the\nbwtwo0.  I do not care if I loose the "back" screen on the color tube from the\nbwtwo1.  After looking through the Xsun man page I am not sure if this is\npossible.  Has anybody sucessfuly done this before?
I "think" you should try linking to /usr/lib/libXmu.a instead of \n-lXmu. At least that solved the problem for me!
We've developed a number of applications using DevGuide and found it to \nbe a very useful tool. I've been impressed with the level of integration it\naffords using the connection editor. I love the general ease of use.\n \n I talked with Tali Aben at Sun today about DevGuide + Motif. She was very\nhelpful. We provided some input as to what we'd like to see in the next\nversion of DevGuide. Tali was very enthusiatic about our comments. I mentioned\nI was going to post this email message and she offered to receive additional\ncomments from the net on what DevGuide should evolve into. \n \n Send your comments/wish-list, raving, et. al. about DevGuide to:\n\n  Tali.Aben@Sun.COM\n\n\n Pretty cool example of a company that cares what we want.... More of this\nand computers may have a future.\n\n Frankly, I like the idea that it will offer some migration capability\nto DOE/DOMF through an integrated ToolTalk capability, pointed out in March's \nSunExpert magazine.
I am looking for a program I can insert into some code that will allow the title bar to be changed on a window dynamicly.  If one already is out there, I would appreciate a location so I don't have to create this from scratch.

I have noticed in FrameMaker 3.1X on both the SGI and SUN platforms\nthat certain dialogs, such as "Column Layout..." for example, respond\nto keyboard traversal even though the pointer is NOT in the dialog\nwindow and even though the window manager keyboard focus policy is\nPOINTER.\n\nHow is this done?\n\nI would like to emulate this behavior in my application. It seems a\nreasonable behavior since when a dialog is popped up from a keyboard\naction, the dialog is not guaranteed to be under the pointer and the\nuser should not have to reach for the mouse just to move the focus.\n\nAlternatively, I'm open to any suggestions as to what is the "right"\nway to insure that popups get the focus when they appear, particularly\nwhen they are invoked from the keyboard and one's keyboard focus\npolicy is pointer.
Do anyone know about any shading program based on Xlib in the public domain?\nI need an example about how to allocate correct colormaps for the program.\n\nAppreciate the help.
I have a problem when I'm using PostScript. When I am working local\non a SUN SPARCstaton IPC the PostScript works good, but when I connect\nto the SUN from a X-terminal I just get error messages that the\nPostScript cannot connect to the news-display.\n\n Why doesn't PostScript work on an X-terminal?\n\n Is there any way to make it work?
I expect what is going on here is that your colormap is full and, when the new application starts up, it cannot add the colors that it needs to the colormap.\nIt therefore has to pick and choose from the existing colors.  This makes it look\nugly until it's window gets priority.  Then Macx changes the colormap so that\nthe selected app is getting the exact colors it wanted, but now other applications\nare having to make do with it's colormap.\n\nThis is a problem with all color X servers (or at least all color Xservers I have\nseen) when the demands of the applications exceed the size of the colormap.\nMy solution is usually to (1) avoid colormap-greedy apps and (2) display\napplications where color is just icing on the cake in monochrome mode rather\nthan in color (if this is an option for the application).\n\n - Doug Shaker\n	voice:	415/572-0200\n	fax:	415/572-1300\n	email:	dshaker@qualix.com\n	mail:	Qualix Group\n		1900 S.

-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nAnimation is most frequently done by copying the the client resident XImages into \nserver resident Pixmap(s) using XPutImage.  Once this is done, the original XImages\ncan be deleted and the animation loop can be performed using XCopyArea from the Pixmaps to the windows drawable.\n\nHope this is helpfull.
G'Day\n\nWindows NT is a step forward, but not by much. I guess for DOS users who\nthink multi-tasking is really _neat_ (add puke here) and are overjoyed to \nbe able to use more than 64K of memory, its a major improvement. For Windows\nusers its more like an upgrade with facilities most Unix users take for \ngranted. Most of  Windows users only use PCs for text processing or running \n3rd-party applications anyway so the operating system features are not even \na real issue. My ideal operating system:\n\n	Binary compatible across all plaforms. It should recognize\n	binaries and configure on the fly, so I don't have to have\n	bin/Mac bin/DOS bin/Dec bin/Sun bin/HP etc...\n\n	Multi-CPU. So I can use the CPUs on my PC and W/S and Mac \n	and Transputers and DSPs. I don't know a single site which \n	has gone for a single vendor. I am not going to trade-in \n	80Mflops per H1 transputer or ultra-fast FFT on DSP chips.\n	Note NT runs on Symmetric multi-CPU systems.\n\n	Built-in portable GUI/Graphics tools. You can call DrawButton \n	or DrawLine and it does the same thing no matter what platform \n	or display. It should also translate graphics commands on-the-fly.\n	so I can use PC graphics S/W on my workstation and X software on \n 	my PC. I think GUIs are not just nice to have but essential.\n\n	Configurable front-end. So you can make it look like Unix or DOS\n	or NT or OS/2, and run shell scripts or command/BAT files.\n\n	Object oriented. So I can program easily under it and not have\n	to re-invent the wheel if the networking is not up to scratch\n	or my application needs to access source/object code on the fly.\n\nIn other words it should have some AI capability. That and a tight, clean\nkernel so you can actually understand it. Anyone know of something like this ?\n\n	adios\n	     Ata <(|)>.
#\n#No doubt this is an old question, but I didn't find the answer in the\n#FAQs I could find, so - here goes:\n#\n#I have a Sunview application that I want to convert to X (OpenLook,\n#Motiv, whatever).

Some time back I asked for software recommendations to  allow me to\nrun X from my PC at home to my Sparc at the office.\n\nMany thanks for all replies, the majority of people  recommended\nPCXremote from NCD. I received it yesterday  and installed it on\nmy Sparc and PC with only one hitch. \nThe UNIX install consists of copying 2 files into some local bin directory. \nOn the PC side, I ordered the WINDOWS version  which  came with a slick windows\ninstallation.\n\n\nThe only problem I had was that  my .xinitrc  in my home directory\nhad the line\nDISPLAY=`hostname`:0.0; export DISPLAY\n\ns.t the clients I kicked off connected to my Xserver on the Sparc console.\nBy removing this line from the .xinitrc everything worked as planned\nand the clients connected to the server at\n\n`hostname`:1.0\n\nSome comments on performance, I was connected to a Sparc 2 thru\na NetBlazer Terminal Server over a 9600 baud line.\nMy PC is a 486-DX2 ATI Ultra, 16 MB\n\nBitmap Stuff Sucked.\nBasic Editing and compilation stuff definitely usable.\nXmail was very usable.\n\nAt times the first time U typed in an Xclient window there was\na very noticable delay, I put this down to brain damaged "WINDOWS\nshould not be called a SCHEDULER", besides that this will become\nmy remote work environment for a while.\n\nHas anybody tried the NON Windows version of the product, the sales\nperson said they performed about the same, given the over head of\nWINDOWS I question this?\n\nmany thanks for help to all who responded

Greetings.\n\nI am developing an application that allows a *user* to interactively\ncreate/edit/view a visual "model" (i.e. topology) of their network, and\nI was wondering if anyone knew of any builder tools that exist to\nsimplify this task.\n\nIn the past I have used Visual Edge's UIM/X product to develop other\nGUIs, so I am familiar with UIMSs in general.\n\nThe topology will support objects and connecting links.  Once the\ntopology is created, I want to provide the user with capabilities to\nsupport grouping, zooming, etc.\n\nI am looking for some form of a higher abstraction other than X drawing\nroutines to accomplish this.  Specifically, the zooming and grouping\naspects may prove difficult, and certainly time consuming,  if I have\nto "roll my own".\n\nSuggestions?\n\n-greg

I am writing a custom widget to support the display of graphics\nand imagery.  The user of the widget will be able to specify,\nwhen creating it, whether it is to operate in X or GL mode.\n\nI have set up translations and actions to handle mouse button\npresses.  They work fine when the widget is in X mode.  In GL \nmode they only work when the widget (my GL/X widget) is a child\nof a manager.  Put another way, the translations do not work \nwhen the widget is configured in GL mode and is a child of a \nshell.  Does anyone know why this is happening?
Hello--  I'm currently designing the architecture of a chip which is\nintended to help speed up common operations on a windowing system such as\nX.  A friend and I are designing the chip as the final course project for\nan advanced computer architecture course taught by Dr. Fred Brooks at\nUNC-Chapel Hill.  While we feel that we've got a pretty solid design\ncurrently, we'd really like to get ahold of some frequency data from an\nX-Windows server so that we can make the most effective use of our bit\nbudget.  \n\nUnfortunately, I've been unable to find anything of this sort in the\nvarious X FAQs, or X manuals that I've seen.  Does anyone have some type of\nfrequency data, like how many Copy-rectangle operations vs draw-lines, and\nthings of that sort?  Or, barring that, a program that records requests to\nthe server into a logfile that I can munge on myself?\n\nAny and all help would be very appreciated.\n\nMany thanks,\n    ---Mark

Well I am not sure if this is the right newsgroup to ask, but let me try anyway.\nI am running xterm and like all UNIX users, I run man <something>. Recently,\nI switched to Solaris 2.1, and their man pages are littered with ".I" directives\nthat are somehow translated into reverse video when displayed by man under xterm.\nThe resulting output (admittedly a personal taste) is very ANNOYING to look at.\nBack when I was using SunOS 4.1.2, I remember their man pages have some keywords\ndisplayed with underlining....\n\nSo my question is how do I change the xterm's behaviour under ".I" directives \nfor nroff man pages, to perhaps underlining, or at least disabling it. (".B" \ndirectives are fine, I like them. And of course, I don't want to go in and edit\nthe man pages inputs...) Somehow, xterm allows one to specify both a normal font\nand a bold font, but not an italic font??\n\nAny pointers, suggestions are greatly appreciated.\nThanks -- John
No, it isn't.  It is the "X Window System", or "X11", or "X" or any of\na number of other designations accepted by the X Consortium.  In fact,\ndoing "man X" on pretty much any X11 machine will tell you:\n\n     The X Consortium requests that the following names  be  used\n     when referring to this software:\n\n                                  X\n                           X Window System\n                             X Version 11\n                     X Window System, Version 11\n                                 X11\n\nThere is no such thing as "X Windows" or "X Window", despite the repeated\nmisuse of the forms by the trade rags.  This probably tells you something\nabout how much to trust the trade rags -- if they can't even get the NAME\nof the window system right, why should one trust anything else they have \nto say?\n\nWith regard to dialup X11 implementations, there are several.  You can\nbuy serial X11 terminals from a couple of companies, including both \nGraphOn and NCD.  (In fact, I'm composing this from an NCD running X11\nover serial lines across 14.4 kbaud connection.)  \n\nNCD also sells a software-only package that provides XRemote (which is\nNCD's implementation of serial X11) for PC's.  There may be other such \nsoftware packages available.\n\nX11R6 is supposed to include a standardized compression scheme for running\nX11 over low-speed connections.  It's called Low Bandwidth X (LBX), and \nis based on improved versions of the techniques used in NCD's XRemote. \n\nIt seems likely that once LBX is released as a Consortium standard, there\nwill be several vendors willing to supply implementations for various \nsorts of hardware.\n\nFollowups directed to comp.windows.x

Okay, that's good.  I'm typing this from exactly the same setup.\n(US-UNIX layout keyboard)  I did install the sunkbd patch, though.\n\n\nMake sure you're using "ssetroot", which comes with tvtwm.  When tvtwm\nstarts up, it nukes the existing root window.  Use an "ssetroot" after\ntvtwm starts up.   (You could spawn off a "(sleep 10; ssetroot ...)&")\nYou can also use "VirtualDesktopBackgroundPixmap filename" or just\nVirtualDesktopBackground if you just want another color besides grey.\n\n\nDid you install the sunkbd patch?  It's in the contrib directory on export.\nAll the keys on my keyboard send events properly, except the following:\nThe End, PageUp, PageDown on the 6-key cluster aren't recognized.\nEven the compose key works.  (Though I can't seem to get the composed\ncharacters in an xterm to get passed.)\n\nAnyone have a fix for the last two?\n\n--Dave

Get Xarchie 2.0 instead.
Standard colormaps were spec'd with the intention that window managers\nwould make them available. This doesn't mean that every window manager\nauthor in the world immediately dropped everything they were doing and\nimplemented this at top priority.\n\nThe ESGE server we ship makes the XA_RGB_BEST_MAP available at\nstartup. It doesn't wait for window managers to do it.\n\n\nDoes your hardware have only one CLUT? Since standard colormaps\ntypically devour all 256 entries, there is no way it can avoid\ndisplacing the entire default colormap if your hardware has only one\nCLUT.\n\nI don't believe standard colormaps are intended to aboid possible\ncolormap flashing between clients using the default coilormap. Rather,\ncolormap flashing will be avoided between two clients that use the\nsame standard colormap. An example would be two clients that need a\nfull color range would both use XA_RGB_BEST_MAP (or whatever it's\ncalled under X11R5).\n\nIf you are trying to avoid colormap flashing with the default\ncolormap, your best bet is to try to load all the colors you use into\nthat colormap. If you can't do that, then you'll get flashing on a one\nhw CLUT framebuffer.\n\nNow if your window manager used the same standard colormap as your\nclient, this flashing could also be avoided. Perhaps some window\nmanagers have command line options for selecting standard colormaps?\n--
Do you have the X source code?  Simply look in mit/clients/xwininfo/xwininfo.c and you\nwill find out exactly how to do it.  :-)
For image display, about 10 frames per second seems to be the lower limit\nfor interactive operations. For just bringing up an image for viewing less\nthan 1 second seems to be a good number. Of course the measure of response\ntime should be based on the applications you are planning to run.

We have recently purchased a Tektronix xterminal, and I'm having\na problem with it. We have a graphics widget that we wrote to\ndisplay waveforms, and it doesn't work on the xterminal. the buttons,\netc, all show up, and it seems to take the 'right' amount of time to\ndraw, but nothing is visible in the graphics window. I\nhave no clue as to where to start looking: the program works fine\non all our suns (3s and 4s, color and B&W). could anyone suggest a\nline of attack for this problem?\n\nTekXpress XP380 color xterminal running 6.0.0. host is a Sun IPX\nrunning SunOS 4.1.3 and X11R5, PL17.
We have an old Sun3/60 here which gets occasional use.  When X11R5 is started\non it any console messages during startup are undeletable.  After X is fully\nstarted we run an xterm as the "console" - the problem is that any messages\nthat arrive before this starts go to the plain console.  "Refresh window" fails\nto remove them.  The messages are a real pain since they sit in the middle of\nthe screen obscuring anything else below them.\n\nAt boot time the 3/60 lists two framebuffers  -  /dev/cgfour0 and /dev/bwtwo1.\nWe're running X in color, and I suspect that maybe the offending messages are\non the B/W framebuffer, and thereby not getting deleted.\n\nMy question is: has anyone else seen this, and is there an easy way to get rid\nof these messages?\n\nPlease reply by e-mail to hughm@inmos.co.uk.\n\nHugh McIntyre.\nINMOS Ltd., Bristol, UK.\n\n(BTW: SunOS 4.0.3, X11R5, mwm).
Could someone please send me the postal and email address of\nCongruent Corporation (and any competitors they may have).\n\nThank you.\n-- \nsnail@lsl.co.uk
Is there a version of Wcl that has been ported to Solaris 2, including\nANSI C? I had numerous problems trying to compile Wcl under Solaris, \nand the functions do not have prototypes.  \n\nI have Wcl 2.01 from the Sun User Group's 1992 CDs.\n\nPlease email answers as I am not on this list.

I've installed X11R5 with patches for Solaris 2.1 on our SPARCstation LX /\nSPARCclassic pool. On the LX, X11R5 runs fine, but on the classics,\nafter giving the command startx, Xsun prints the following messages:\n	WARNING: cg3_mmap: can't map dummy space!\n	Mapping cg3c: No such device or address\nand exits.\n\nDoes anybody know how to fix this problem?\n\nThanks in advance.
I was planning to use the following pipe to move some display data to a system\nthat has a color hardcopy unit:\n\n	xwd | xwud -display hostname:0.0\n\nI had tested it with some simple windows like the OpenWindows file manager,\nand it worked fine, but when I tried it with a more complex (larger) image,\nthe xwd part blew up with a segmentation fault.  I tried it without the pipe,\nby redirecting xwd's output to a file and then used the file as input to xwud\nand got the same error from xwud.  If I had to guess, it seems like it's\nrunning out of memory, but this happened on a SPARC 10 with 64 megs, 128 meg\nswap space, and only one user with minimal activity.  The file was about 3 MB.\n\nThis verion of xwd/xwud was supplied with the Sun OpenWindows 3.0 distribution\nwhich I believe corresponds to X11 R4.\n\nAny ideas?

However, the best source of general information on \nbuilding the X11 release is found in the Release Notes. The file is bundled \nseparately from the rest of the release, so if it's become separated from your \nsources you can FTP another copy separately: the file RELNOTES.[ms,PS,TXT] at \nthe top of the distribution. The file RELNOTES is also available from the \nxstuff mail server.\n	In addition, O'Reilly & Associates's Volume 8 on X Administration\nincludes information on configuring and building X.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  94)  Why doesn't my Sun with a cg6 work with R5?\n\n	Apparently gcc is the problem; it seems to produce fine code for all\nSun displays except for the cgsix. The new sunGX.o distributed with fix-07 \nmay fix the problem (note: not known to work on Solaris).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  95)  Why doesn't my Sun with SunOS 4.1 know about _dlsym, etc.?\n\n	If you get errors with _dlsym _dlopen _dlclose undefined, link with \nlibdl.a.  Add "-ldl" to your and eventually your site.def.  You may want to \nsurround it with "-Bstatic -ldl -Bdynamic" if you add it to the EXTRA_LIBRARIES\nvariable, since "syslibs" get added after EXTRA_LIBRARIES on the eventual \ncompilation command; otherwise you may not have a shared libdl.  (Or compile \nthe stubs shared.)\n\n[thanks to Joe Backo (joe.backo@East.Sun.COM), 12/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  96)  What is this strange problem building X clients on SunOS 4.1.2?\n\n	In SunOS 4.1.2 Sun fixed a shared-library bug in ld which conflicts\nwith the way X11R4 builds the shared Xmu library, causing these symbols to be\nundefined when building some X11 clients: \n	_get_wmShellWidgetClass\n	_get_applicationShellWidgetClass\nCompiling "-Bstatic -lXmu -Bdynamic" appears to work. \n\nTo solve the problem if you are using OpenWindows 3.0 (X11R4-based Xt), please \ncontact your local Sun office and request the following patches:\n\nPatch i.d.

The patch is on export in [1/93]\n	contrib/X11R4_sunos4.1.2_patch_version3.Z\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  97)  Why can't gcc compile X11R4 on my SPARC?\nI used gcc to compile the whole distribution, but I get several segmentation\nfaults when running X.\n\n	Note first that gcc on RISC machines does not necessarily result in\nany performance increase; it certainly is not as noticeable as it is on the\n680x0 or VAX platforms.\n\n	Here is the problem: gcc and cc use incompatible methods of passing \nstructures as arguments and returning them as function values, so when \ngcc-compiled parts of X are linked with Sun-supplied functions that pass or \nreturn structs, run-time errors occur.  Affected programs include rgb and \nthe server.\n\n	This is from the GCC manual:\n\n	On the Sparc, GNU CC uses an incompatible calling convention for \n	structures.  It passes them by including their contents in the argument\n	list, whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by \n	reference.\n\n	This really ought to be fixed, but such calling conventions are not yet\n	supported in GNU CC, so it isn't straightforward to fix it.\n\n	The convention for structure returning is also incompatible, and\n	`-fpcc-struct-return' does not help.\n\nYou can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just\nthe routines which cause incompatibilities; the problem cannot be solved with \ncompilation flags.  \n\n	Files which need to be compiled using cc include:\n		server/os/4.2bsd/oscolor.c \n		rgb/rgb.c\n\n	In addition, several of the "inet_" functions use structs as args or\nreturn values:  \n		clients/xhost/xhost.c \n		clients/xauth/gethost.c. \nCalls to inet_addr in /lib/CLX/socket.c and lib/X/XConnDis.c are possibly \nharmless as they don't involve structs.\n\n[collected by bashford@scripps.edu (Don Bashford); 8/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  98)  What are these I/O errors running X built with gcc?\nWhen I try to run xinit or the Xsun server I get the error \n	"Getting interface configuration: Operation not supported on socket. \n	Fatal server bug! no screens found."\n\n	Running the gcc fixincludes script apparently didn't work. You can do \nthis simple test:\n\n	#include <sys/ioctl.h>\n	SIOCGIFCONF\n\nRun that through cc -E and gcc -E.  The last line of output is the piece of \ninterest; it should be identical (modulo irrelevant differences like \nwhitespace).  If the gcc version has 'x' where the cc version has 'i', your \nfixincludes run didn't work for some reason or other; go back to your gcc\nsources and run `fixincludes`; then rebuild the X distribution. If they are \nidentical, try running a make clean in mit/server and rebuilding, just to make \nsure everything gets compiled with the proper include files.  \n\n[courtesy der Mouse, mouse@LARRY.MCRCIM.MCGILL.EDU; 9/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  99)  What are these problems compiling X11R4 on the older Sun3?\nIn mit/server/ddx/sun/sunCG3C.c, we have found "missing" defines for \nCG3AC_MONOLEN, CG3BC_MONOLEN, CG3AC_ENBLEN, CG3BC_ENBLEN. What should these be?\n\n	The R4 Errata list distributed after X11R4 mentions that you can add\nthese lines to the file on older SunOS versions (e.g. 3.5) to compile:\n        #define CG3AC_MONOLEN (128*1024)\n        #define CG3AC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN\n        #define CG3BC_MONOLEN CG3AC_MONOLEN\n        #define CG3BC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN\n\n	However, the Sun3 should not actually ever have the CG3 device, and so \nreferences to it can be removed from mit/server/ddx/sun/sunInit.c and the \nImakefile.  [11/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 100)  What are these problems compiling the X server on SunOS 4.1.1?\nThe file <sundev/cg6reg.h> isn't being found.\n\n	Sun omitted <sundev/cg6reg.h> from SunOS 4.1.1. Remove the #include \nfrom sunCG6C.c and replace it with the line \n	#define CG6_VADDR_COLOR   0x70016000\nThe file has changed from earlier versions of SunOS and should not be copied \nfrom another distribution.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 101)  What are these problems using R4 shared libraries on SunOS 4?\nAll of the executables that I try to run have the following results:\n	ld.so: libXmu.so.4: not found\nor even:\n	ld.so: call to undefined procedure __GetHostname from 0xf776a96c\n\n	If you are building with shared libraries on a Sun, remember that you \nneed to run "ldconfig" as root after installing the shared libraries (if you've\ninstalled X on a file-server, run it on the server's clients, too).  While \nbuilding and installing the distribution, you need to be careful to avoid \nlinking against any existing X shared libraries you might have (e.g. those \ndistributed with OpenWindows).  You should make sure you do not have \nLD_LIBRARY_PATH set in your environment during the build or the installation.  \nIf you are going to keep xterm and xload as setuid programs, please note that \nthe shared libraries must be installed in /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, or \n/usr/5lib for these programs to work (or else those programs must be linked \nstatically). [courtesy MIT X Consortium]\n	Note also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build; it\nattempts, however, to use the shared libraries before they have been installed.\nYou can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir statically (pass -Bstatic to\nmost C compilers).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 102)  Can OLIT programs run with R5 Xt? (_XtQString undefined)\n\nThis is a bug in the OLIT.  _XtQString was an external symbol that existed in \nX11R4 (upon which OW 3.0's libXt is based).  It wasn't documented and was \nremoved in X11R5 (MIT's guarantee of upward compatibility between the R4 and R5\nlibraries only applied to the documented interface).  \n\nA workaround is to temporarily set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the X11R4\nor OpenWindows Xt library that you linked the program against.\n\n[10/92; from Barry Margolin (barmar@think.com); 3/93 from Jeff Francis \n(jpf@heliocentric.com)]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 103)  How do I get around the SunOS 4.1 security hole?\n\n	There is a security problem with certain R4 clients (xterm and xload)\nrunning under SunOS 4.1 that have been installed setuid root and are using \nshared libraries; to avoid the problem, do one of these:\n	1) make the program non-setuid. You should consult your system\nadministrator concerning protection of resources (e.g. ptys and /dev/kmem) used\nby these programs, to make sure that you do not create additional security \nproblems at your site.\n	2) relink the programs statically (using -Bstatic).\n	3) install the libraries before linking and link with absolute paths\nto the libraries.\n\n[from rws@expo.lcs.mit.edu (Bob Scheifler), 12/90]\n\nThe R5 version of xterm does this automatically by rebuilding xterm against the\nnewly-installed libraries when xterm is being installed; this prevents an suid\nprogram from being built with libraries specified relatively. Note that this \nmay cause an inconvenience when doing the installation from NFS-mounted disks. \nXload has been rewritten to avoid the problem.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 104)  How do I get around the frame-buffer security hole?\n\n	On many systems the frame-buffer is unsecured by default; this permits \nanyone who can log into your workstation to peek at your windowing session by \naccessing the frame-buffer directly, or, as less of a privacy issue but perhaps\nmore annoying, to [accidentally] start up a second X session on your console \ndisplay. Check the man page for fbtab(5).\n\n[Thanks to Art Mulder (art@cs.ualberta.ca); 2/93.]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 105)  TOPIC: BUILDING X PROGRAMS \n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 106)  What is Imake?\n\n	Imake is not a replacement for the make program; instead, it is a\nmakefile-generator that takes advantages of the include-file and macro-\nprocessing capabilities of the C preprocessor cpp to generate makefiles \nsuitable for building software on a particular system. Although it is not \nspecific to X, the X release uses it to help solve a number of the \nconfiguration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable.\n	Imake has a fairly steep learning curve, in part because the process by\nwhich the system-specific configuration files, system-independent configuration\nfiles, and individual Imakefiles are melded to produce a Makefile is not \nobvious.\n	There have been several different versions of imake; the R3, R4, and\nR5 versions are different.\n\n	You can obtain information on imake from these sources:\n	- the R4 and R5 release notes and imake man page include information on\nusing Imake to build X\n	- the R4 and R5 file mit/config/README also contains useful information\n	- on the R4 tapes, contrib/doc/imake/imake.tex is Mark Moraes' R3/R4\nguide to imake.\n	- the R5 mit/doc/config/usenixws/paper.ms contains a paper by Jim\nFulton on an early version of Imake\n	- Paul Dubois (dubois@primate.wisc.edu) has written a useful \nexplanation of how Imake works and how to use it in configuring X for non-\nsupported systems; the document is available from ftp.primate.wisc.edu\nin the directory ~ftp/pub/imake-stuff; look for config-X11R4.ms (troff) and \nconfig-X11R4.ps (PostScript). Some supplemental appendices are nearby. \n[7/91: document version is now 1.06] These imake papers are available by email;\nmail a message body of "send imake-stuff help" to almanac@primate.wisc.edu.\n	- see "System Administration - Imake: Friend of Foe?" by Dinah McNutt\nin the November 1991 issue of SunExpert.\n	- German readers should expect in June 1992 an article "Das Meta-Make \n/ I make, you make / Schwerelos" by Rainer Klute in "iX \nMultiuser-Multitasking-Magazin", directed at application programmers needing to\nwrite Imakefiles. An English-language derivative of this article is in The\nX Journal, issue 2:1.\n	- The O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains Paul Davey's article on\ndemystifying Imake.\n	- Alain Brossard's working document full of tips on Imake is in \nsasun1.epfl.ch:pub/imakefile.1.Z.\n\n[1/91;12/91;5/92;8/92]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 107)  Where can I get imake?\n\n	Versions are distributed with the R4 and R5 releases. An earlier \nversion is distributed with the X11R3 release; some third-party toolkits \nredistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the \ntemplate and configuration files. There are no real standards for such \nconfiguration files, although most *current* contributed software expects the \ntemplates distributed with X11R5.\n	export contains the R5 distribution unpacked, so you can pick up imake\nwithout picking up the entire distribution.\n	A stand-alone version of Imake, but one stemming from X11R5, is in\nftp.germany.eu.net:pub/X11/misc/imake/imake-pure.tar.Z (192.76.144.75).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 108)  I have a program with an Imakefile but no Makefile. What to do?\n\n	If you have R4 or R5 installed on your system, run "xmkmf". This is a \nscript which runs imake for you with the correct arguments. The output is a \nMakefile configured for your system and based on the Imakefile. Then run make, \nwhich will use that new Makefile to compile the program.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 109)  Why can't I link to the Xlib shape routines?\nWhen I try to compile certain programs, I get the following link error:\n	Undefined:\n	_XShapeQueryExtension\n	_XShapeCombineMask\n\n	These routines are actually part of the Shape Extension to X (SHAPE)\nwhich was introduced in the MIT X11R4 distribution and allows non-rectangular\nwindows.  Like the other sample server extensions, the shape extension will \nonly run on a server which supports it.  Pre-X11R4 servers, as well as many \nvendor-supplied servers, do not support the shape extension, in which case \nthey will display rectangular windows anyway.\n\n	In order to use the shape extension, you must link to the library \nlibXext.a.  In the X11R4 distribution, this library and the associated includes\nwill be in the mit/extensions directory.  If you do not have these files, do \nnot despair:  many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be \ncompiled without it by removing the -DSHAPE define from the Makefile; you can\nprobably do this and compile successfully against your older vendor-supplied X \nlibraries.\n\n[from John B. Melby, melby%yk.fujitsu.co.jp@uunet.uu.net, 3/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 110)  What are these problems with "_XtInherit not found" on the Sun?\nWhen I run a X program that I wrote on a SunOS 4.0.3 or 4.1 machine I get the \nerror "ld.so: symbol not found _XtInherit".\n\n	What you are seeing is a side-effect of a kludge in the R4 libXt.a to \nget Sun shared libraries working.  Apparently, you can't share a function that \nis both called and compared, as _XtInherit is. This was handled by putting \n_XtInherit in the same file as a function that is always used, thereby \nguaranteeing that it would be loaded -- that is, in Initialize.c, where \nXtToolkitInitialize() and XtInitialize() reside. These routines would normally\nbe called.\n\n	You are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal\nXt-based program and does not call XtToolkitInitialize() anywhere. \n	1) it may be a program that uses Xt functions but never opens a \nconnection to the X server.  [OSF/Motif's 1.1.0 UIL had this problem; it called\nXtMalloc() and other Xt functions.] The solution is to add the call to your \nprogram; the function does not have to be executed, just linked in.\n	2) alternatively, your program doesn't need any Xt functions and is\ncorrect in not calling XtToolkitInitialize() -- it may be an Xlib or XView \nprogram. In this case, you can remove -lXt from your link command. \n\n	It should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically,\nalthough this will certainly solve the problem.\n	\n[from Jordan Hayes (now jordan@MooreNet.COM) and Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be); \n11/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 111)  Why can't I compile my R3 Xaw contrib programs under the new X?\nI have a program that worked well under X11R3. When I try to link it under \nthe current version of X, I get this message:\n	Undefined:\n	_XtScrollBarSetThumb\n	_XtTextSetInsertionPoint\n	_XtTextReplace\n\n	There were several name changes in the Athena widget set (in addition\nto the header files moving into <X11/Xaw/>); these are mentioned in the R4\nrelease notes. In this case, these functions are not really Xt functions but\nare part of the Xaw text widget and so have been renamed from Xt* to Xaw*.\n[10/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 112)  TOPIC: PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS AND PUZZLES\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 113)  Why doesn't my program get the keystrokes I select for (sic)?\n\n	The window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from one\nwindow to another.  In order to get keystrokes, your program must ask the\nwindow manager for the input focus.  To do this, you must set up what are\ncalled "hints" for the window manager.  If your applications is Xlib-based, you\ncan use something like the following:\n\n        XWMHints wmhints;\n        ...\n        wmhints.flags = InputHint;\n        wmhints.input = True;\n        XSetWMHints(dpy, window, &wmhints)\n\nIf your application is based on the Xt Intrinsics, you can set the XtNinput \nresource to be True (as you probably want to in any case); if you don't have\nsource, you can start up the application with the resource '*input:True'.\n\nCertain window managers, notably dxwm and olwm, are very picky about having \nthis done. \n\n	If you are using Sun's OpenWindows olwm, you can also add this resource\nto your defaults file to use clients that aren't ICCCM-compliant.\n	OpenWindows.FocusLenience:       true\n\n[mostly courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 114)  How do I figure out what window manager is running?\n\n	You can't reliably tell; whatever mechanism you could use could be\nspoofed in any case. \n	For most cases, you shouldn't care which window manager is running, so \nlong as you do things in an ICCCM-conformant manner. There are some cases in \nwhich particular window managers are known to do things wrong; checking for\nparticular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can \nsidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases. Alternatively, it may \nbe appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take\nadvantage of specific *added* features (such as olwm's push-pin menus) in order\nto give your program *added* functionality. Beware of usurping the window \nmanager's functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing;\nthis surely leads to future compatibility problems.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 115)  Is there a skeleton X program available?\n	\n	There is no general framework such as the TransSkel program for the \nMacintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development \nunder a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional \ndevelopment. In X, the problem is typically solved by using an interactive \napplication builder tool or by using cut&paste on existing X applications. Good\napplications which you might look to manipulate when you want to "test just \nthis one little thing" include contrib/clients/xskel, a simple R4 program that \nputs up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point for\nquick hacks, the Xaw examples in the examples/ directory in the R3 and R4 \ndistributions, and the Xlib "Hello World" example in the R3 doc/HelloWorld and \nR4 doc/tutorials/HelloWorld; an updated version of this program which uses R4 \nXlib calls and current ICCCM conventions was posted in 2/90 to comp.windows.x  \nby Glenn Widener of Tektronix. 	[3/90]\n\n	In addition, a sample Xt program (for Xaw or Xm) by Rainer Klute \nshowing how to open multiple displays and how to catch a broken display \nconnection is available on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/mdisp.tar.Z. [4/92]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 116)  Why does XtGetValues not work for me (sic)?\n\n	The XtGetValues interface for retrieving resources from a widget is\nsensitive to the type of variable. Your code may be doing something like this:\n	{\n	Arg args[3];\n	int i;\n	int sensitive;		/* oops; wrong data type */\n	i=0;\n	XtSetArg (args[i], XtNsensitive, &sensitive); i++;\n	XtGetValues(widget, args, i );\n	...\n	}\n\nBut XtNsensitive is a Boolean, which on most machines is a single byte; \ndeclaring the variable "sensitive" as Boolean works properly. This problem \ncomes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the Xt types \nDimension and Position; code that assumes they are int will have similar \nproblems if those types are actually short. In general: you are safe if you\nuse the actual type of the resource, as it appears in the widget's man page.\n[11/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 117)  Why don't XtConfigureWidget/XtResizeWidget/XtMoveWidget work?\n\n	You're probably trying to use these functions from application code.\nThey should be used only internally to widgets; these functions are for a \nparent widget to change the geometry of its children. Other promising \nfunctions, XtMakeGeometryRequest() and XtMakeResizeRequest(), are also for use \nonly by widgets, in this case by a child to request a change from its parent.\n	The only way for your application to request a geometry change for a\nwidget is to issue an XtSetValues call setting some of the geometry resources.\nAlthough this will result in the widget-internal functions' being called, your\napplication code must use the standard XtSetValues interface or risk the \nwidgets' data becoming corrupted.\n	[The Xlib calls XMoveWindow() and XResizeWindow() should similarly be \navoided; they shouldn't be used to change XtNx, XtNy, XtNwidth, or XtNheight.]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 118)  Why isn't there an XtReparentWidget call like XReparentWindow?\n\n	Although there are various details of the current implementation of\nthe Xt internals which make reparenting difficult, the major reason that no\nsuch call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources for\nthe "new" widget should be. Resources are typically set based on the location\nin the instance hierarchy; what resources should change if the instance moves?\nWhat should happen to the widget's children? And by the time such semantics are\ndefined, there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old \nwidget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired \nresources, as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in \ncreating a new widget.\n\n	Note that reparenting is possible in the OI toolkit.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDavid B.

Sorry, but olwm and tvtwm don't do it. They place the title at that position\n   and the window at a position below it.\n\n   This becomes a problem when you want a program to be able to save its current\n   configuration and restore is later.\n\n   Currently, my solution is:\n\n	   XCreateWindow(...);\n	   XSetWMProperties(..);\n	   XMapWindow(...);\n	   XFlush(...);\n	   XMoveWindow(...);\n\n\n   It works with olwm, but is less than elegant. All this leaves me wondering\n   if I'm overlooking something obvious.\n\n   Richard.\n\n\nI know that the mwm has an resource to specify if positions are to be used for\nthe border of a window or for the "user" window. Maybe other window managers\nhave similar options.\nAnother way to figure out the difference between the "user" window position\nand the window manager decoration window position is to subtract their\npositions. You just have to use XQueryTree and remember that the window manager\ndecorations window is the parent of your window. Unfortunately, you can only\nfigure out the decoration width and height after the window has been mapped\nthis way.

From article <1993Apr17.010256.14372@eafs000.ca.boeing.com>, by ten0772@eafs000.ca.boeing.com (Timothy E. Neto):\n\nThis all sounds suspiciously like my company might have something to\ndo with this.\n\nBackground first: Megatek has a series of framebuffers designed as\nX accelerators. For the most part these are designed for Sun SBUS\nand Sun (and other vendor's) VME systems.\n\nThat said, Megatek products support multi-screen and/or multi-display\non a sigle workstation. Most of our cards have a keyboard/mouse port\nwhich can be used to provide additional displays. For example, say\nyou hade a Sparcstation with an Sbus expansion chassis. You could\nput in six frambuffers, allowing a total of six screens in the system.\nYou could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard/mice, allowing you to\nmix and match any combination of screens and displays. You could\nhave 1 6-screen display, 3 2-screen displays, 6 1-screen displays,\nor 1 2-screen display and 1 4-screen display. Basically any\ncombination.\n\nBecause of this, we at Megatek try to be very careful about the use\nof the words multi-screen and multi-display. They are quite different\nin meaning, and (at least in X) have exact definitions.\n\nThe reason I ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 12\nscreens in a display. As it so happens, there's a define in the server\nthat determines the most screens supported (server/include/misc.h,\nMAXSCREENS). As released my MIT, this is 3. As released by Megatek,\nthis is 12.\n\nAs such, the most screens supported by a single Megatek display (i.e.\nX server) is 12. If someone construed this to be a limitation of X\nI'm sorry, but clearly (as pointed out so well by Mr. Neto) this is\nnot the case.\n\nWe just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more. Of\ncourse, I could say "Buy all you want, we'll support more."\n--
Actually, info@qdeck.com is our customer service department. If you have\ntechnical questions, you can write to support@qdeck.com.\n\n\nI expect the limiting factor will be your server machine, not the network\nitself. To give you a real-world example, here at Quarterdeck we have\nroughly 100 people using DVX to talk to a bunch of unix boxes, novell\nfile servers, and each other. It's not _too_ much of a load on our\nEthernet (with maybe 4 concentrators, so you have 20-30 people on each\nsegment). If you had a badly loaded net, or the apps you wanted to run\nwere very network intensive, you could run into some slowdowns.\n\nBut the biggest problem would be the machine itself. Say you have a 486\n33 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card. If you have\n10 people running programs off it, you're going to see some slowdowns\nbecause you're now on (effectively) a 3.3 MHz 486. Of course, DVX will\nattempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time\nslice, but if you have 10 working programs running, you'll know it.\n\nHaving said that, if you can tweak the programs being run (by adding\nin calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of\nthing), you could probably run 15-20 people on a given machine before\nyou started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth).\nIt all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. you're going\nto see a slowdown from X-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all\ndoing network things also...)

If I am out of X and access the\n tape, the tape drive works fine.  Soon as I try to\n startx again; the screen changes modes, but, the grey background\n pattern does not come up and no xterm is forked.  I have to login\n from another terminal and execute a shutdown to reset the system.\n\n I've contacted Esix about this problem.  They claim THEIR X-window X11R4\n server (which I have) works with the Wangtek tape drive.  They also \n claim I only need the nsu (network system utilities) to run X; I don't\n need inet (tcp/ip).  My experience has been that I need BOTH to get\n XFree86 to work.  I'm not too concerned about having to load both nsu and inet\n packages to get X to work unless the inet package is causing my problem.\n\n I would like to get both X and my tape drive to co-exist on the same\n system.  If you can shed any light on the problem, it would be appreciated.\n \n One colleague implied this might be a hardware conflict.  If this is true,\n what direction should I look to resolve the conflict ?\n\n Thanks,

But I seem to have no control over the length of this field.\nIn some apps it appears long enough to keep several characters,\nin some - it cannot keep even the maximum value set by \nPANEL_MAX_VALUE! \n\nAs I understand, PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH, which controls\nnumber of characters to be displayed in text items, doesn't\nwork in the case of slider, despite the fact that <panel.h>\ncontains the following bit:\n\n	/* Panel_multiline_text_item, Panel_numeric_text_item,\n	 * Panel_slider_item and Panel_text_item attributes\n	 */\n	PANEL_NOTIFY_LEVEL	= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_ENUM,			 152),\n	PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH	= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_INT,		 182),\n\nwhich gives a hint that this attribute can be used for sliders.\nBut 1) setting this attribute gives nothing, and 2) xv_get'ting\nthis attribute gives warning: Bad attribute, and returns value 0.\n\nStrange thing is that DEC's port of XView gives plenty of space\nin a text fields, but not Sun's Xview...\n\nCan someone share his experience in managing sliders in XView with me,\nand clear this problem? \n\nAny help is very much appreciated.\n\nYuri

This would benefit the\nuser-community, as well as give me more insight in what people would like to\nsee added to Motif++. Motif++ is still very much a voluntary project, and this\nway I can make a list of priorities, in what order things should be added, or\nchanged.\n\nIf you're interested in joining such a mailing-list, please take the time to\nreply to this message, and tell me so. When there is sufficient interest, say\nabout 20 people or more, a mailing-list will be set up at my site, and I will\npost the announcement of the newly-created list to this and other newsgroups.

How much support do you need?  I don't think there's anything\nthat prohibits you from implementing such a widget, though you\nwill have to write your own versions of the functions that draw\nthe 3D shadow and traversal highlighting.

I recently found the file xgolf on a German ftp site\n(reseq.regent.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de) but unfortunately the shar file\nwas incomplete and the author's email address given in the readme file\n(markh@saturn.ee.du.edu) does not work.\n\nCan anyone assist by giving the location of a full version of this (or\nany other golf game for X) game, or a way of contacting the author?\n\nPlease reply by email if you can help\n\nAde
I am having a problem with the high order bit of a character being \nclipped when entered in an xterm window under motif. I have reprogrammed\nthe F1 key to transmit a <ff> <be> character sequence by using the\nfollowing line in .Xdefaults:\n\n~Ctrl ~Shift ~Alt <Key> F1 : string(0xff) string(0xbe) \n\\n\nI merge in this line with xrdb -merge and then create the new xterm\nwhich has the remapped F1 key. The problem that arises is that the \napplication which is recieving input at the time only sees a <7f> <3e>\nsequence, which is <ff> <be> with the high order bit of each\ncharacter being filtered or ignored.\n\nWhen I run xev and press the F1 key, I get the correct value showing \nup in the following two key events:\n\n  KeyPress event, serial 14, synthetic NO, window 0x2800001,\n  root 0x28, subw 0x0, time 2067815294, (67,80), root:(74,104),\n  state 0x0, keycode 16 (keysym 0xffbe, F1), same_screen YES,\n  XLookupString gives 0 characters:  ""\n\n  KeyRelease event, serial 16, synthetic NO, window 0x2800001,\n  root 0x28, subw 0x0, time 2067815406, (67,80), root:(74,104),\n  state 0x0, keycode 16 (keysym 0xffbe, F1), same_screen YES,\n  XLookupString gives 0 characters:  ""\n\nNotice that the keysym being transmitted is correct; 0xffbe.\nBut when I use the F1 key while in vi or in a program I wrote to \nspit back the hex values of keyboard input, I only get <7f> <3e>.\n\nDoes anyone know why the high order bit is being filtered and what\nI can do to make sure that the entire 8bits make it through to\nthe final application? Any help is greatly appreciated.\n\nPlease *email* any responses.
store and reply of mouse and keyboard events\n--------------------------------------------\n\nTo produce regression tests or automatic demo's\nwe would like to store all mouse and keyboard events\nproduced by a user. It should be possible to filter\nthe mouse and keyboard events from the server's queue\nan to store them in a file.\nThis sequence of events, stored in a file, should be given \nto the server's queue as if a user is working.\n\n\n1. Exists a tool that is capable to save and reply all\n   mouse and keyboard events (where)?\n\n2. Where one can catch these events to store them ?\n   In our case the server's queue is on a X Terminal (HP).\n   Where can we catch all events coming from a given\n   server.\n   If this is not possible, can we catch all events given\n   to a certain client and how ?\n   \n3. Where one can send a stored sequence of events to simulate a user ?\n   Is there a central dispatcher on the clients machine who manages\n   all incoming events from a given server and how can we reach it ?\n\n\nThanks in advance
Hello,\n\nI am testing a port of X11R5 to Coherent, a unix clone OS for Intel architecture\nmachines.  I am seeing a strange problem with text in clients like xvt (a simple\nterminal emulator program).\n\nThe problem manifests it self when the shell echoes typed characters back to the\nserver for display, one at a time.  The characters appear to be too closely\nspaced, with the result being that the 2nd character echoed destroys the \nrightmost edge of the first character, then the 3rd character destroys the \nrightmost edge of the second character, and so on.  It looks like there is an\ninvisible boundary around a character which obscures a portion of the previous\ncharacter.  There is no problem between the characters when the shell returns\na complete line of text... only when the output is a series of individual\ncharacters.\n\nIf anyone has any ideas what the problem might be, or where I should look to\nfind it, it would be much appreciated.\n\nRegards and thanks, Jon Dhuse.
I have and use xrecplay for X11R5.  Does one exist for X11R4???\n\nI have tried to contact one of the developers, Eric Swildens, at\ness@hal.com but he is no longer there and has no forwarding email\naddress.  Archie is no help either.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.  Thanks,

The following packages meet your criteria in that they are PD and\npresent an aesthetically pleasant graphical interface to the users.\n\nIf you can use 386bsd:\n	there is xview3 (OpenLook)\n\n	there is Interviews which looks a little like Motif\n\n	there is gopath a very nice C++ toolkit for Athena Widgets and Motif\n	         which is simpler\n                 and better than interviews and you will enjoy\n                 technical support from Bull via e-mail\n		 It has a nice draw program (it uses motif) which can be used\n		 to create graphical front-end to programs.\n		 The data format is called streams which you can feed\n		 to your programs. I ported gopath on an internet machine\n		 which is gone but if you use gcc-2.3.3 with minimal effort\n		 gopath can be ported to 386bsd.\n		 Last but not least, gopath interfaces to toolkits via a driver\n		 module. They have an MS-Windows driver module for instance.\n\n	Also, many have written extensions to tk/tcl thus allowing powerful\n	applications. For instance, tcl_nm  has snmp extensions for tk/tcl.\n	With ease, I  can now combine snmp network operations with graphs,\n	photo-widget, graphical interface, file operations, database \n	operations,etc.. The author of tcl_nm mail me a simple network \n	management application which was about 80 lines long - it displayed\n	various environmental parameters from a router. I wrote  a simple\n	strip chart script for displaying Real-Time ip received\n	packets/seconds.\n\n\n	Hope this helps,\n	Amancio Hasty
Hello!\n\n\nThis isn't of much help!

I have a program produces a continuous tone by calling XBell\nrepeatedly at an interval equal to the duration of the bell. If it is\nrun more than once on a display, the tones are buffered in the X\nserver and the tone contunues after all occurrences of the program\nhave exited. Is there a convenient way of preventing this, e.g., by\nemptying the X server bell buffer when each program exits?\n- Disclaimer: Please note that the above is a personal view and should not \n  be construed as an official comment from the JET project.

I'm trying to write some code that lets me draw lines and do rubber-band\nboxes in Motif/X.  I'm running on an 8-bit display for which I've created a\ncolormap and am using almost all of the colors.  I want to draw the lines\nin a drawing area widget -- a widget in which I'm displaying a bitmap using\nXPutImage().  If doesn't matter if the lines I draw interactively stay\naround when the window is refreshed.\n\nCurrently, to draw interactively, I begin with:\n\n   /* drawIndex is an colortable index I reserve for the Foreground */\n   /* my_default_bg_color is the color index for the background of my image */\n   palette_colors[drawIndex].red =   palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].red;\n   palette_colors[drawIndex].green = palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].green;\n   palette_colors[drawIndex].blue =  palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].blue;\n   XStoreColors( myDisplay, my_cmap, &palette_colors[DrawIndex], 1);\n   XFlush( myDisplay);\n\n   XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXxor);\n   XSetForeground( myDisplay, gc, drawIndex);\n\nThen to draw I do:\n\n   XDrawLine( myDisplay, XtWindow( drawingArea1), gc, x1, y1, x2, y2);\n   XFlush( myDisplay);\n\nAnd when I'm all done, to return things to normal I do:\n\n   XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXcopy);\n\n\nWhat I'd like to happen is for the lines I draw to be the inverse of\nwhatever I'm drawing over.  Instead what happens is I get white lines.  If\nthe lines are over a white background - nothing shows up.  If the lines are\nover a black area - nothing shows up!  It's very strange.  But the GXxor\nfunction seems right - since if I do a rubber-banding box, it erases and\nredraws itself correctly (ie. not disturbing the underlying image).\n\nAny suggestions what I'm doing wrong?
libXaw3d, the 3D Athena widget set will greatly improve the\n"sculptured" look. In Linux, with its shared, jump-table libs, you\ndon't even have to recompile or relink. you merely have to:\n ln -sf /lib/libXaw3d.so.3.0 /lib/libXaw.so.3
What it has to do with your original question is this: many times \nbeginning X users (heck, experienced X users too!) write small test\nprograms.  Many times they forget to draw only in response to expose\nevents, and thus see unpreditable results whereby sometimes the application's\ngraphics show up, and sometimes they don't.  We're just trying to\neliminate all the "easy" explanations  for why you're not seeing your\ngraphics. \n\nThat being said, why don't you try copying different planes to your\nwindow other than 16 (== 1 << 4).  Try 1, 1<<1, 1<<2, ..., 1<<7\nto see it you get any output.  Since you're dipslaying only a single \nplane of your data, it's possible that all the pixel values in your\npixmap have the same value for that color plane.\n\n	Ken
Hello...\n\nI wonder if some one can suggest an answer to the following question:\nI am a total X novice and would appreciate any suggestions you may have.\n\nI am trying to create a simple drawing tool....\n\n       __________\n       |        |\n       |     ___|___\n       |_____|__|  |\n             |	   |\n	     |_____|\n\nLet's say I have two rectangles on the canvas(see above) \none intersecting the other...\nNow, I would like to delete one of the rectangles.\nThe way I do it is to create another GC wherein I use the\nGXxor logical function and simply redraw the rectangle using the newly\ncreated graphics context thus deleting it for all apparent purposes.\nA problem with this approach is that at the points of intersection the pixel \nlocations belonging to the other rectangle also become white, which is \nsomething that should be avoided.\n\nIs there any way I can avoid this problem without having to redraw the other\nrectangle too?\nI also would not like to generate an expose event for the affected area\nas this degrades performance very badly...
What I was talking about was using an Tek terminal as your X display.  I\nshould be possible to write an X server that does this as far as I can\ntell, but what I'm asking is if there is already one.\n\n-- \nmike@hopper.acs.virginia.edu
To incrementally update the contents of windows, I use the following trick:\n\n	1. Set the window background to None,\n	2. Call XClearArea(display, window, 0, 0, 0, 0, True),\n	3. Restore the window background to its correct value.\n\nThe call to XClearArea does not repaint the window background, but still\ngenerates exposure events for visible parts of the window.\n\nIn order to let my application know that these expose events must be handled\nincrementally (something is already displayed on the screen and may need to\nbe erased), I encapsulate the 3 operations with 2 self addressed client\nmessages, which preserve asynchronicity between the client and the server.\n\nXGrabServer(display)\nclient message (start-incremental)\n 	background None\n	XClearArea\n	Restore background \nclient message (end-incremental)\nXUngrabServer(display)\n\nThe GrabServer prevents other events to be inserted by the server in the\ncritical section.
Hi.  I've looked in the FAQ and the O-Reilly books and was unable to\nfind (an easy) means of finding out the state of state keys such as\nCapsLock and NumLock.  I can certainly track the events inside of my\nwindow and set a boolean there, but what if CapsLock is pressed in\nanother window?  I looked at XGrabKey() and decided it was definitely\nNOT what I wanted to do.  I could find no convenience function to tell\nme that information.\n\nMy question is this:  Is there a means of determining what the state\nof CapsLock and/or NumLock is?\n\nAn even more pointed question: Is there an easy means of making an X\nkeyboard act like a PC keyboard?  ie, CapsLock is active, and the user\npresses shift-a, I'd like to get a lowercase 'a' instead of 'A'.\n\nAny input is greatly appreciated. Please respond via email.  I will\nrepost a summary of my findings.
DEC does this only for their PX and PXG servers, known as 3D accelerators.\nThis boards have local offscreen memory which is limited and slow to\nhandle, thus they set this limit.
I was wondering if it's possible to change the window icons OLWM\nuses for things like xterm.  Most of the defaults are pretty lame.\n\nAny answer (or where I can find one) would be most appreciated.\n\nThanks
I'm considering writing my own widgets, but I like to have some sample\nwidget source code to look over first.  Where could I find something\nlike this?  Are there any archives accessible by anonymous ftp that contain \nsuch information?
Well, the first 2 are easy.  You need the math library.  Try adding -lm after\n-lX11.  Don't know if that's the whole problem but it's a start.
Here's what I (think) have figured out.  All I need to do is install\nthe R5 disitribution without the Xserver like the sony.cf file defines,\nand all the new libraries, utils, etc., will be installed and my old\nserver from r4 will still work.  This will allow me to run Xview 3.0,\nand have X11r5 up and running.  Does the server interface remain the\nsame with all changes made only to the libs?\n\nAnother question: Is it likely that since Sun is dropping OW support\nthat the desktop utils (like the file manager) will be made public?\nIt would be nice if companies would make old code public for the\nbenefit of those of us with smaller budgets. :)\n-- \nmike@hopper.acs.virginia.edu
Archive-name: x-faq/part2\nLast-modified: 1993/04/04\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  24)! How do I make a screendump or print my application?\n\n	The xwd client in the X11 distributions can be used to select a window \nor the background. It produces an XWD-format file of the image of that window. \nThe file can be post-processed into something useful or printed with the xpr \nclient and your local printing mechanism. You can use this command:\n		csh% sleep 10; xwd -root > output.xwd &\nand then spend 10 seconds or so setting up your screen; the entire current\ndisplay will be saved into the file output.xwd. Note that xwd also has an\nundocumented (before R5) -id flag for specifying the window id on the \ncommand-line. [There are also unofficial patches on export to xwd for \nspecifying the delay and the portion of the screen to capture.]\n\n	Two publicly-available programs which allow interactive definition of \narbitrary portions of the display and built-in delays are asnap and xgrabsc.\nThere are several versions of xgrabsc; version 2.2, available on export [8/92]\nis the most recent.\n	xsnap includes some asnap features and supersedes it; it also renders \nXPM output [version unknown]. It is available on export or avahi.inria.fr;\nsee xsnap-pl2.tar.Z.\n	A screen-dump and merge/edit program combining features of xwd and xpr\nis available from vernam.cs.uwm.edu as xdump1.0.tar.Z. Information: \nsoft-eng@cs.uwm.edu.\n	xprint, by Alberto Accomazzi (alberto@cfa.harvard.edu) is available\nfrom cfa0 (128.103.40.1) in xprint.export-2.1.tar.Z.\n\n	To post-process the xwd output of some of these tools, you can use xpr,\nwhich is part of the X11 distribution. Also on several archives are xwd2ps\nand XtoPS, which produce Encapsulated PostScript with trimmings suitable for \nuse in presentations (see export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/xwd2ps.tar.Z and\ncontrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z). Also useful is the PBMPLUS package on many archive\nservers; and the Xim package contains Level 2 color PostScript output.\n\n	The XV program can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate it, and\nsave it in one of the available formats. ImageMagick has similar capabilities.\n\n	Also: \n\n	Bristol Technology (info@bristol.com, 203-438-6969) offers Xprinter \n2.0, an Xlib API for PostScript and PCL printers; a demo is on ftp.uu.net\nin vendor/Bristol/Xprinter.\n\n	ColorSoft 9619-459-8500) offers OPENprint package includes a screen-\ncapture facility, image-processing, and support for PostScript and \nnon-PostScript printers.\n\n	Some vendors' implementations of X (e.g. DECWindows and OpenWindows) \ninclude session managers or other desktop programs which include "print portion\nof screen" or "take a snapshot" options. Some platforms also have tools which \ncan be used to grab the frame-buffer directly; the Sun systems, for example, \nhave a 'screendump' program which produces a Sun raster file. Some X terminals \nhave local screen-dump utilities to write PostScript to a local serial printer.\n\n	Some vendors' implementations of lpr (e.g. Sony) include direct \nsupport for printing xwd files, but you'll typically need some other package \nto massage the output into a useful format which you can get to the printer.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  25)  How do I make a color PostScript screendump of the X display?\n\n	If you need color PostScript in particular, you can \n	- grab the screen-image using a program which can produce color \nPostScript, such as xgrabsc and xv \n	- grab the screen-image using xwd and post-process xwd into color PS.\nYou can do this using xwd2ps or the XtoPS program from the ImageMagick \ndistribution. The PBMPLUS package is also good for this, as is the Xim package.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  26)  How do I make a screendump including the X cursor?\n\n	This can't be done unless the X server has been extended. Consider \ninstead a system-dependent mechanism for, e.g.,  capturing the frame-buffer.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  27)  How do I convert/view Mac/TIFF/GIF/Sun/PICT/img/FAX images in X?\n\n	The likeliest program is an incarnation of Jef Poskanzer's useful++ \nPortable Bitmap Toolkit, which includes a number of programs for converting \namong various image formats. It includes support for many types of bitmaps, \ngray-scale images, and full-color images. PBMPLUS has been updated recently;\nthe most recent version [12/91] is on export in contrib/pbmplus10dec91.tar.Z.\n	Another tool is San Diego Supercomputing Center's IMtools ('imconv' in \nparticular), which packages the functionality of PBM into a single binary.\nIt's available anonymous ftp from sdsc.edu (132.249.20.22).\n\n	Useful for viewing some image-formats is Jim Frost's xloadimage, a\nversion of which is in the R4 directory contrib/clients/xloadimage; there are \nlater versions available, including contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z on export.  \nGraeme Gill's updates to an earlier version of xloadimage are also on export; \nsee xli.README and xli.tar.Z.uu; version 1.14 was released 2/93.\n\n	xv (X Image Viewer), written by bradley@cis.upenn.edu (John Bradley), \ncan read and display pictures in Sun Raster, PGM, PBM, PPM, X11 bitmap, TIFF, \nGIF and JPEG. It can manipulate on the images: adjust, color, intensity, \ncontrast, aspect ratio, crop). It can save images in all of the aforementioned \nformats plus PostScript. It can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate on \nit, and save it in one of the available formats. The program was updated 5/92; \nsee the file contrib/xv-2.21.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.\n\n	The Fuzzy Pixmap Manipulation, by Michael Mauldin <mlm@nl.cs.cmu.edu>.\nConversion and manipulation package, similar to PBMPLUS.  Version 1.0 available\nvia FTP as nl.cs.cmu.edu:/usr/mlm/ftp/fbm.tar.Z, uunet.uu.net:pub/fbm.tar.Z, \nand ucsd.edu:graphics/fbm.tar.Z.\n\n	The Img Software Set, by Paul Raveling <raveling@venera.isi.edu>, reads\nand writes its own image format, displays on an X11 screen, and does some image\nmanipulations.  Version 1.3 is available via FTP on expo.lcs.mit.edu as\ncontrib/img_1.3.tar.Z, along with large collection of color images.\n\n	The Utah RLE Toolkit is a conversion and manipulation package similar \nto PBMPLUS.  Available via FTP as cs.utah.edu:pub/urt-*, \nweedeater.math.yale.edu:pub/urt-*, and freebie.engin.umich.edu:pub/urt-*.\n\n	Xim, The X Image Manipulator, by Philip Thompson, does essential \ninteractive displaying, editing, filtering, and converting of images. There is \na version in the X11R4 contrib area; but a more recent version (using R4 and \nMotif 1.1) is available from gis.mit.edu (18.80.1.118). Xim reads/writes gif, \nxwd, xbm, tiff, rle, xim, (writes level 2 eps) and other formats and also has a\nlibrary and command-line utilities for building your own applications.\n\n	ImageMagick [2.3; 2/93] by cristy@dupont.com can be retrieved from \nexport's contrib area. It is a collection of utilities to transform and display\nimages on any X server. The tool uses the MIFF format; filters to and from MIFF\nfrom other popular formats (PPM, TIFF, GIF, SUN Raster, etc) are included.\n\n	xtiff is a tool for viewing a TIFF file in an X window.  It was written\nto handle as many different kinds of TIFF files as possible while remaining\nsimple, portable and efficient.  xtiff illustrates some common problems\nwith building pixmaps and using different visual classes.  It is distributed\nas part of Sam Leffler's libtiff package and it is also available on\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, uunet.uu.net and comp.sources.x.

The current (R4) guide includes an outdated version\nof the control sequences. [1/93]\n\nOther good sources of information include the R4 version of that document\nand also the file in the R4 sources called mit/clients/xterm/ctlseq2.txt, a \ncompilation put together by Skip Montanaro (GE CR&D) listing the VT100 \nsequences. It dates from R3 but is fairly accurate.  A hardcopy version was \npublished in the December 1989 XNextEvent (the XUG newsletter).\n\nIn a pinch, a VT100 manual will do.\n\n[last updated 10/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  30)- Why does the R3 xterm, et al, fail against the R4 server?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  31)  How can I use characters above ASCII 127 in xterm ?\n\n	In order to use special characters such as the o-umlaut, you need to \n"stty pass8" but also to use a charcell ISO8859 font, such as \n	XTerm*font: 	-*-*-medium-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1\n	XTerm*boldfont:	-*-*-bold-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1\n[The family is intentionally unspecified in this example.]\n\nIn addition, you may want to set this in your shell:\n	setenv LC_CTYPE iso_8859_1\n\n        For a given character above 127, you can determine the key to use with \nthe Alt modifier by finding the equivalent character below 127 (try using\n`man ascii`). For example, o-umlaut (v) is Alt-v and the section character (') \nis Alt-'. \n\n[thanks to Greg Holmberg (greg%thirdi@uunet.uu.net) and Stephen Gildea \n(gildea@expo.lcs.mit.edu); 6/92]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  32)  Why are my xterm menus so small?\n\n	You are probably setting the geometry small accidentally. If you give \na resource specification like this:\n		xterm*geometry: 80x24\nthen you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to\n80x24. For the main window, this is OK, as it uses characters for its size. \nBut its popup menus don't; they are in pixels and show up small. To set only\nthe terminal widget to have the specified geometry, name it explicitly:\n		xterm*VT100.geometry: 80x24\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  33)  How can I print the current selection?\n\n	You could paste it into an xterm after executing the lpr command. \nHowever, a program by Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) specifically for \nmanipulating the selection will help; e.g. \n	% xselection PRIMARY | lpr\nfinds the primary selection and prints it. This command can be placed in a \nwindow-manager menu or in shell-scripts. xselection also permits the setting of\nthe selection and other properties. A version is on export.\n	Also available is ria.ccs.uwo.ca:pub/xget_selection.tar.Z, which can be\nadapted to do this.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  34)  How does Xt use environment variables in loading resources?\n\n	You can use several environment variables to control how resources are \nloaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and \nXAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for \napplication-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at most\none app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from\nthe path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.\n\n	Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a \nway that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies.\nSuppose, for example, that you are running Sun's Open Windows, and you also \nhave some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could \nset a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up \napp-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your\nOPENWINHOME is located):\n	setenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N\n\nThe value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see \nXtResolvePathname()):\n\n        %N      The value of the filename parameter, or the\n                application's class name.\n        %T      The value of the file "type".  In this case, the\n                literal string "app-defaults"\n        %C      customization resource (R5 only)\n        %S      Suffix.  None for app-defaults.\n        %L      Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. "ja_JP.EUC")\n        %l      Language part of %L  (e.g. "ja")\n        %t      The territory part of the display's language string\n        %c      The codeset part of the display's language string\n\n	Let's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is \n"Myterm". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the \nexample omits locale-specific lookup.)\n	/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm\n	$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm\n\n	As the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above \napp-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it reads it \nand uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to \nsearch first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.\n\n	Let's consider another example. This time, let's set \nXUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working \ndirectory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.\n	setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N\n\n	The first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands \nto $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging \nbecause it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file \nMyterm.ad in the application's source directory, so you can run the application\nfrom the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded\nproperly.  NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,\nfor some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is defined so %T and\n%S are useless.\n\n	With R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customization \nresource value.  For example, you might run the "myterm" application like this:\n	myterm -xrm "*customization: -color"\n\n	If one of your pathname specifications had the value\n"/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C" then the expanded pathname would be\n"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color" because the %C substitution character \ntakes on the value of the customization resource.\n\n	The default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:\n		/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\  (R5)\n		/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\  (R5)\n		/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\     (R5)\n		/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\n		/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\n		/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N\n\n	(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in\nthis batch of default settings.)\n\n	The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is \n		<root>/%L/%N%C:\  (R5)\n		<root>/%l/%N%C:\  (R5)\n		<root>/%N%C:\     (R5)\n		<root>/%L/%N:\\n		<root>/%l/%N:\\n		<root>/%N:\n\n	<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory \nif XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other \nthan the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.\n\n	Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find \nyour app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR \nto ".", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked differently; for R3 \ncompatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to "./", a dot followed \nby a slash.\n\n[Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@world.std.com); 2/93.]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  35)  How to I have the R4 xdm put a picture behind the log-in window?\n\nThe answer lies in changing xdm's xrdb resource in the xdm-config file to run a\nprogram to change the background before loading the resources; for example, \nyour /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config file may add the line \n	DisplayManager.0.authorize: false \nto permit unrestricted access to the display before log-in (beware!) and also \n	DisplayManager*xrdb:	/usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.xrdb\nwhere that file does something (for all connections) along the lines of:\n	#!/bin/sh\n	#comes in with arguments: -display :0 -load /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xresources\n	/usr/bin/X11/xsetroot -display $2 -bitmap /usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.bitmap\n	/usr/bin/X11/xrdb $*\nSubstitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot, to taste.  Note that this is a \ngeneral hack that can be used to invoke a console window or any other client.\n\n[Thanks to Jay Bourland (jayb@cauchy.stanford.edu), 9/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  36)  Why isn't my PATH set when xdm runs my .xsession file?\n\n	When xdm runs your .xsession it doesn't source your .cshrc or .login\nfiles. You can set the path explicitly as you normally could for any SH script;\nor you can place all environment-setting statements in a separate file and\nsource it from both the .xsession file and your shell configuration file; or,\nif you set your PATH in your .cshrc file, the normal place, you can make your \n.xsession have PATH set simply by making it a csh script, i.e. by starting\nyour .xsession file off with "#!/bin/csh". \n	If this doesn't work, also try starting off with:\n		#!/bin/sh\n		# Reset path:\n		PATH=`csh -c 'echo $PATH'` ; export PATH\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  37)  How do I keep my $DISPLAY when I rlogin to another machine?\n\n	There are several ways to avoid having to do a "setenv DISPLAY ..."\nwhenever you log in to another networked UNIX machine running X.\n	One solution is to use the clients/xrsh on the R5 contrib tape.  It \nincludes xrsh, a script to start an X application on remote machine, and\nxrlogin, a script to start a local xterm running rlogin to a remote machine.\nA more recent version is on export in xrsh-5.4.shar.\n	One solution is to use the xrlogin program from der Mouse\n(mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu). You can ftp caveat-emptor versions from\n132.206.1.1, in X/xrlogin.c and X/xrlogind.c. The program packages up $TERM and\n$DISPLAY into a single string, which is stuffed into $TERM.  rlogin then \npropagates $TERM normally; your .cshrc on the remote machine should contain\n		eval `xrlogind`\nwhere xrlogind is a program that checks $TERM and if it is of the special \nformat it recognizes, unpacks it and spits out setenv and unsetenv commands to \nrecreate the environment variables. [11/90]\n\n	In addition, if all you need to do is start a remote X process on \nanother host, and you find\n		rsh <HOST> -n /usr/bin/X11/xterm -display $DISPLAY \ntoo simple (DISPLAY must have your real hostname), then this version of xrsh \ncan be used to start up remote X processes. The equivalent usage would be \n		xrsh <HOST> xterm\n\n  #! /bin/sh\n  # start an X11 process on another host\n  # Date: 8 Dec 88 06:29:34 GMT\n  # From: Chris Torek <chris@mimsy.umd.edu>\n  # rsh $host -n "setenv DISPLAY $DISPLAY; exec $@ </dev/null >&/dev/null"\n  #\n  # An improved version:\n  # rXcmd (suggested by John Robinson, jr@bbn.com)\n  #       (generalized for sh,ksh by Keith Boyer, keith@cis.ohio-state.edu)\n  #\n  # but they put the rcmd in ()'s which left zombies again.

See Ollie Jones's article in the November 91 X \nJournal for more information.\n	The R3 contrib/ area (in fonts/utils/ and in clients/xtroff) contained \na number of useful utilities, including some to convert between BDF font format\nand a simple character format which can be edited with any text editor.\n	An easier way is to use the "xfed" client to modify an existing font; a\nversion is on the R4 or R5 X11R5 contrib tape in contrib/clients/xfed. Xfed is \navailable for anonymous ftp on ftp.Informatik.Uni-Dortmund.DE [129.217.64.63], \npossibly as file /pub/windows/X/Diverse-X11-Sourcen/xfed.tar.Z. It can produce\nBDF-format fonts which can be compiled for a variety of X servers.\n	The xfedor client from Group Bull permits creation of bitmaps, cursors,\nXPM1 pixmaps, and fonts. Binaries for common machines are on avahi.inria.fr in\n/pub; in addition, the sources (an old Xlib implementation) have been placed \n[5/91] in export:/contrib. \n	If you are a MetaFont user you can use "mftobdf" from the SeeTeX\ndistribution to convert PK, GF, and PXL fonts to BDF format; the distribution\nis on ftp.cs.colorado.edu and on export.lcs.mit.edu.\n	The GNU package fontutils-0.4.tar.Z on prep.ai.mit.edu includes xbfe,\na font editor, and a number of utilities for massaging font formats.\n	The O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains an article on using these\ntools to modify a font.\n	Fonts can be resized with Hiroto Kagotani's bdfresize; a new version is\nin ftp.cs.titech.ac.jp:/X11/contrib.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  39)  Why does adding a font to the server not work (sic)?\n\n	After you have built the font using your system's font-compiler, \ninstalled it in some directory, and run `mkfontdir` or your system's equivalent\n(e.g. bldfamily for OpenWindows) in that directory, be sure to use `xset +fp \n$dir` to add that full path-name to the server's font-path, *or* if the \ndirectory is already in the path, use `xset fp rehash` so that the new fonts in\nthat directory are actually found; it is this last step that you're probably \nleaving out. (You can also use `xset q` to make sure that that directory is in \nthe path.)\n	Sometimes your "xset +fp $dir" command fails with a BadValue error:\n		X Error of failed request:BadValue\n			(integer parameter out of range for operation)\n		Major opcode of failed request:  51 (X_SetFontPath)\n\n	This means the X server cannot find or read your font directory, or\nthat your directory does not look like a font directory to the server.  (The\nmention of an "integer parameter" in the message is spurious.)\n\n-- Is the font directory you're specifying readable from the SERVER's file\n   system?  Remember, it's the server, not the client, which interprets your\n   font directory.  Trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an\n   xset command with shell metacharacters in it (e.g. "xset +fp ~/myfonts") and\n   the server is an X terminal or managed by xdm.\n\n-- Is the directory really a font directory?  If you're running an MIT server\n   (or most varieties of vendor servers) look in the directory for the file\n   "fonts.dir".  If you can't find that file, run mkfontdir(1).  (If you're\n   running OpenWindows, look for the file "Families.list".  If you can't find\n   it, run bldfamily(1).)\n\n-- If you're in a site where some people run X11Rn servers and others run a\n   proprietary server with nonstandard font formats (OpenWindows, for\n   example), make sure the font directory is right for the server you're using.\n   Hint: if the directory contains .pcf and/or .snf files, it won't work for\n   Open Windows.  If the directory contains .ff and/or .fb files, it won't work\n   for X11Rn.\n\n[thanks to der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu) and to Oliver Jones \n(oj@pictel.com); 7/92 ]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  40)  How do I convert a ".snf" font back to ".bdf" font?\n\n	A tool called "snftobdf 1.4" is part of the bdftools package, which is \navailable from export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/bdftools.tar.Z and from \ncrl.nmsu.edu:pub/misc/bdftools.tar.Z.  [2/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  41)  What is a general method of getting a font in usable format?\n\n	der Mouse's getbdf is one solution; it connects to a server and \nproduces a .BDF file for any font the server is willing to let it.  It can be \nused as an anything-to-BDF converter, but requires access to a server that can \nunderstand the font file, thus is both more and less powerful than other tools \nsuch as snftobdf. getbdf is on 132.206.1.1 in X/getbdf.c or available via mail \nfrom mouse@larry.McRCIM.McGill.EDU. [5/91]\n	In addition, the R5 program "fstobdf" can produce bdf for any font that\nthe R5 server has access to.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  42)  How do I use DECwindows fonts on my non-DECwindows server?\n\n	The DECwindows fonts typically don't exist on a non-DEC installation,\nbut rewrite rules can be used to alias fonts used by DECwindows applications to\nstandard MIT fonts of similar characteristics and size. Pick up the file \ncontrib/DECwindows_on_X11R4_font.aliases from export.lcs.mit.edu; this file is \nfor a standard MIT R4 server.  It can also serve as a starting point for \ncreating a similar aliases file for the Open Windows server or other servers \nwhich do not use the MIT font scheme.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  43)  How do I add ".bdf" fonts to my DECwindows server?\n\n	The format of fonts preferred by DEC's X server is the ".pcf" format.\nYou can produce this compiled format from the .bdf format by using DEC's dxfc\nfont-compiler. Note that the DEC servers can also use raw .bdf fonts, with a\nperformance hit.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  44)! How can I set backgroundPixmap in a defaults file? (What is XPM?)\nI want to be able to do something like this:\n	xclock*backgroundPixmap:      /usr/include/X11/bitmaps/rootweave\n\n	You can't do this. The backgroundPixmap resource is a pixmap of the \nsame depth as the screen, not a bitmap (which is a pixmap of depth 1). Because \nof this, writing a generic String to Pixmap converter is impossible, since \nthere is no accepted convention for a file format for pixmaps. Therefore, \nneither the X Toolkit or the Athena widget set define a String to Pixmap \nconverter, because there is no converter you cannot specify this value as a \nresource.  The Athena widget set does define a String to Bitmap converter for \nuse in many of its widgets, however.\n[courtesy Chris D. Peterson (now kit@ics.com), 4/90]\n\nHowever:\n	A specific converter which encapsulates much of the functionality of \nthe xloadimage package by Jim Frost was posted 12/90 by Sebastian Wangnick \n(basti@unido.informatik.uni-dortmund.de); it permits loading of a number of \nimage formats as a pixmap.\n\n	The leading general-purpose format for pixmaps is the XPM format used \nby Groupe Bull in several of its programs, including the GWM window manager, by\nAT&T in its olpixmap editor, and by ICS in its interface builder. XPM \ndistribution, available on export as contrib/xpm.tar.Z, includes read/write \nroutines which can easily be adapted to converters by new widgets which want to\nallow specification of pixmap resources in the above manner.  See information\non the xpm-talk mailing list above. XPM 3.0f was announced in 3/93 and is\navailable from export.lcs.mit.edu and avahi.inria.fr; an older version is on \nthe R5 contrib tape.

[Look in\nmit/doc/bugs/bug-report in R4.]\n\n[Thanks to Stephen Gildea <gildea@expo.lcs.mit.edu>, 5/91; 12/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  52)  Why do I get "Warning: Widget class version mismatch"?\n\n	This error, which typically goes on to say, "widget 11004 vs. \nintrinsics 11003" indicates that the header files you included when building \nyour program didn't match the header files that the Xt library you're linking \nagainst was built with; check your -I include path and -L link-path to be sure.\n	However, the problem also occurs when linking against a version of the \nX11R4 Xt library before patch 10; the version number was wrong. Some Sun OW\nsystems, in particular, were shipped with the flawed version of the library, \nand applications which link against the library typically give the warnings you\nhave seen.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  53)  Where can I find a dictionary server for xwebster?\n\n	Webster's still owns the copyright to the on-line copies of Webster's\nDictionary which are found at various (university) sites. After it became aware\nthat these sites were then acting as servers for other sites running xwebster \nand gnuemacs-webster, it asked that server sites close off external access.\n	[The NeXT machine apparently is also licensed to have the dictionary. A\nWebster daemon for NeXT machines is available from iuvax.cs.indiana.edu \n(129.79.254.192) in "pub/webster/NeXT-2.0".]\n	Unless you want to get a legal on-line copy yourself or can find a site\nwhich can grant you access, you are probably out of luck. \n\n	However, if you are a legitimate site, you'll want to pick up the\nlatest xwebster, as-is on export:contrib/xwebster.tar.Z [10/91]; the file \nxwebster.README includes discussions of the availability, illegality, and \nnon-availability of dictionary servers. \n	\n[courtesy steve@UMIACS.UMD.EDU (Steve Miller) and mayer@hplabs.hp.com (Niels \nMayer) 11/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  54)  TOPIC: OBTAINING X AND RELATED SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  55)  Is X public-domain software?\n\n	No. The X software is copyrighted by various institutions and is not \n"public domain", which has a specific legal meaning. However, the X \ndistribution is available for free and can be redistributed without fee.\n	Contributed software, though, may be placed in the public domain by\nindividual authors.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  56)  How compatible are X11R3, R4, and R5? What changes are there?\n\nThe Release Notes for each MIT release of X11 specify the changes from the \nprevious release.  The X Consortium tries very hard to maintain compatibility \nacross releases.  In the few places where incompatible changes were necessary, \ndetails are given in the Release Notes.  Each X11 distribution site on the \nnetwork also offers the Release Notes that go with the release they offer; the \nfile typically can be found at the top of the distribution tree.\n\n[Stephen Gildea, 1/92]\n\nThe comp.windows.x.intrinsics FAQ-Xt lists Xt differences among these versions.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  57)!

Hi !\n\nI am using Xview 3.0 on a Sparc IPX under Openwindows along with a XVideo board\nfrom Parallax which enables me to use 24 bit color. I am having some problems\nutilizing the 24 bit color and would greatly appreciate any help in this matter.\n\nI use Xview to create a Frame and then create a canvas pane inside which I use\nto display live video. My video input is 24 bit color.\n\nThe problem is that my top level frame created as\n	frame = (Frame) xv_create(NULL,FRAME,NULL);\nseems to have a depth of 8 which is propagated to my canvas.\n\nI would like to know how I can set the depth of the frame to be 24 bits.\nI tried using the following Xlib code :\n\nXVisualInfo visual_info;\nint depth = 24;\nColormap colormap;\nXSetWindowAttributes attribs;\nunsigned long valuemask = 0;\nWindow *win;\nXv_opaque frame;\n\nwin = xv_get(frame,XV_XID);\nXMatchVisualInfo(display,screen,depth,TrueColor,&visual_info);\n\n/* So far so good */\n\ncolormap = XCreateColormap(display,win,visual_info,AllocNone);\n\n/* It dies here with a BadMatch error :( */\n\nattribs.colormap = colormap;\nvaluemask |= CWColormap;\nXChangeWindowAttributes(display,w,valuemask,&attribs);\nXSetWindowColormap(display,win,colormap);\n\n\nAm I using a completely wrong approach here ? Is it possible to set the depth\nand colormap for a window created by Xview ? What am I doing wrong ?\n\nThanks in advance for any help that I can get. I would prefer a response via\nemail although a post on the newsgroup is also okay.\n\nThanks again,\n\n\nAlok.
I want to do the equivalent of an "xwininfo -name" via a call or set of calls\nin Xlib.  I need to map a windows name to its id.\nIt's probably easy, but I've only been programming in X for a little while.\nI've looked in the O'reilly books and didn't find it and I also checked the\nFAQ and couldn't find it.\n\nEmail to one of the following addresses and I'll post a response if it\nseems reasonable to do so.\n\n\nGuy
We are getting a memory fault and a core dump whenever we end a Motif\nsession under Ultrix 4.3, running on a DEC 5000/240. An examintion of the \ncore file leads us to believe it's from getcons. Does anyone know what\nthis is all about?\n\nmarc
It works on xterms. At least I have no problem with it. - Back to the original\nquestion:\n\nI usually start new xterms by selecting the proper menu entry in my desktop\nmenu. Here is a sample command:\n\n	xterm -sl 999 -n ls12i -title ls12i -e rlogin ls12i &\n\nThe -n and -title options give the text for window and icon. As I use the\ntcsh (a wonderful extension of the csh), I can do the following:\n\nI have an\n\n	alias precmd echo -n '^[]2\;${HOST}:$cwd^G'\n\nin my ~/.tcshrc. This is a special alias for tvtwm. It is executed each time\nbefore printing the prompt. So, I have the current host name and the current\ndirectory path in the title bar of my xterms.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      ____                                                                    \n  UniDo  /  Ingolf Markhof  University of Dortmund, LS Informatik XII         \n ___/   /                   P.O.

Hi everyone,\n\nDoes anyone know a good way to adjust colourmaps on the\nfly (say during an animation) and prevent the current\nset of colours from flickering?\n\nThanks,
No. This is only relevant for OpenWindows 3.x as shipped with SunOS.\nIt is not relevant for MIT R5. MIT R5 should compile without problems.

The slow response can be avoided by calling GetValue\nfirst, and only using SetValue if the required location is different.\nThe problem can also be avoided by making a tiny alteration in the\nlocation of the popup, so that the SetValue really does change the\nlocation of the popup. (We tried this just for a double check on the\nsource of the problem.)\n\nThe solutions we have tried successfully are now as follows:\n\n1) Use "twm" or "mwm" rather than "olwm"\n2) Use "olwm", with resource "*wmTimeout: 10"\n3) Only reset the location of the popup window if it is truely changed.\n\nThis is obviously working around some bug somewhere.
# \n# I think the original post was searching for existing implementations of\n# f.i. Gouroud-shading of triangles. This is fairly complex to do with plain\n# X. Simpler shading models are implemented already, f.i. in x3d (ask archie\n# where to get the latest version).\n# For Gouroud, a fast implementation will be possible utilizing some extension\n# only, either MIT-SHM to do the shade in an image and fast update the window\n# with it, or PEX/OpenGL which should be able to shade themselves. The portable\n# 'vanilla X' way would be to shade in a normal XImage and use XPutImage(),\n# what would be good enough to do static things as f.i. fractal landscapes\n# or such stuff.\n# \n# To speak about POVRay, the X previewer that comes with the original source\n# package is not that good, especially in speed, protocol-friendlyness and\n# ICCCM compliance.

(How do I write X-friendly applications?)\n\n	The Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual is one of the \nofficial X Consortium standards documents that define the X environment. It \ndescribes the conventions that clients must observe to coexist peacefully with \nother clients sharing the same server.  If you are writing X clients, you need \nto read and understand the ICCCM,  in particular the sections discussing the \nselection mechanism and the interaction between your client and the window \nmanager.  Get it either:\n	- as part of the R4 distribution from MIT\n	- in the later editions of the Scheifler/Gettys "X Window System" book\n	- as an appendix in the new version of O'Reilly's Volume 0, "X Protocol\nReference Manual." A version in old copies of their Volume 1 is obsolete.\n	The version in the Digital Press book is much more readable, thanks to \nthe efforts of Digital Press's editors to improve the English and the \npresentation.\n\n[from David Rosenthal, 10/90]\n\n	- the ICCCM was updated for R5; updates are published in O'Reilly's\n"Programmer's Supplement for Release 5". The complete document is on the R5\ntapes.\n\n	Alternate definition: the ICCCM is generally the M in "RTFM" and is\nthe most-important of the least-read X documents.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  11)  What is the X Consortium, and how do I join?\n\n	The MIT X Consortium was formed in January of 1988 to further the\ndevelopment of the X Window System and has as its major goal the promotion of \ncooperation within the computer industry in the creation of standard software \ninterfaces at all layers in the X Window System environment.\n	MIT's role is to provide the vendor-neutral architectural and \nadministrative leadership required to make this work. Membership in the \nConsortium open to any organization.  There are two categories of membership, \nMember (for large organizations) and Affiliate (for smaller organizations).\n	Most of the Consortium's activities take place via electronic mail, \nwith meetings when required.  As designs and specifications take shape,\ninterest groups are formed from experts in the participating organizations.  \nTypically a small multi-organization architecture team leads the design, with \nothers acting as close observers and reviewers.  Once a complete specification\nis produced, it may be submitted for formal technical review by the Consortium\nas a proposed standard.  The standards process typically includes public \nreview (outside the Consortium) and a demonstration of proof of concept.\n	Your involvement in the public review process or as a Member or \nAffiliate of the Consortium is welcomed.\n	Write to: Bob Scheifler, MIT X Consortium, Laboratory for Computer \nScience, 545 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA 02139.\n\n[For complete information see the XCONSORTIUM man page from the X11R4\ndistribution, from which this information is adapted.] [2/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  12)  Just what are OPEN LOOK and Motif?\n\n	OPEN LOOK and Motif are two graphical user interfaces (GUIs). OPEN LOOK\nwas developed by Sun with help from AT&T and many industry reviewers; Motif was\ndeveloped by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) with input from many OSF \nmembers. \n\n	OPEN LOOK is primarily a user-interface specification and style-guide; \nthere are several toolkits which can be used to produce OPEN LOOK applications.\nMotif includes an API specification; the only sanctioned Motif toolkit is the \none from OSF. However, there are other toolkits which can be used to produce \nprograms which look and behave like OSF/Motif; one of these, ParcPlace's \n(formerly Solbourne's) OI, is a "virtual toolkit" which provides objects in the\nstyle of OPEN LOOK and Motif, at the user's choice.\n\n	OPEN LOOK GUI is also the name of a product from AT&T, comprising \ntheir OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit and a variety of applications.\n\n[Thanks to Ian Darwin, ian@sq.com, 5/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  13)  Just what is OpenWindows?\n\n	Open Windows (3.0) is a Sun product that encompasses: a window system \nthat combines a NeWS and X11-compliant server (X/NeWS); a user-interface \nspecification (OPEN LOOK) and a series of toolkits that implement it (including\nthe SunView-like XView and the Xt-based OLIT); Xlib and Xt implementations; and\na number of utilities (olwm window manager, filemgr, shelltool, etc.).\n\n[thanks to Frank Greco (fgreco@govt.shearson.COM), 8/90; 4/92] \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  14)  Just what is DECWindows?\n\n	DECWindows is a DEC product that encompasses: an X11 server; the XUI \ntoolkit, including the Dwt widget set and UIL; Xlib and Xt implementations; a \nsession manager; and a number of utilities (dxwm window manager, dxcalendar, \ndxpsview, etc.).\n\n(At some point Motif flavors of the toolkit and applications will be shipped.)\n[8/90] \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  15)  What is PEX?\n\n	PEX is the "PHiGS Extension to X".\n	PHiGS stands for "Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics \nSystem" and is essentially a library of functions that simplifies the creation \nand manipulation of 3D graphics. Many platforms are capable of performing in \nhardware the computations involved in rendering 3D objects; the extension \nallows the client (PHiGS in this case) to take advantage of the specialized \nhardware for 3D graphics.\n	Sun Microsystems is currently contracted to develop a freely \nredistributable (copyright similar to the current X copyright) sample\nimplementation.  Source and documentation are available in the R5 release.\nSeveral vendors are currently selling independently-developed PEX servers for \ntheir workstations and X terminals.\n\n[last modified 10/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  16)  What is "low-bandwidth X" (LBX)? XRemote? PPP? SLIP? CSLIP?\n\nThere are several options for using X over serial lines:\n\nSLIP - Serial Line IP; this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending IP\npackets over point-to-point serial links. It has been around for several years,\nand implementations are available for many of the major TCP/IP implementations.\nMost X Terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item, although nobody really \never uses it since it is horribly slow.  The TCP/IP headers add 40 bytes per \npacket and the TCP/IP encoding of the X protocol is rather verbose (rightfully \nso; it is optimized for packing and unpacking over high-speed links). \n\nCSLIP - Compressed header SLIP; this is a variant of SLIP that compresses the \n40 bytes of TCP/IP headers down to about 5 or 6 bytes.  It still doesn't do \nanything about reencoding the X protocol.  Modems that do compression can help,\nbut they increase packet latency (it takes time to dribble the uncompressed \ndata through typical serial interfaces, plus the compression assembly time).\n\nPPP - Point-to-Point Protocol; this is an emerging standard for point-to-point\nlinks over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation than\nSLIP.  A growing number of people see the combination of PPP for the serial \nline management and CSLIP for the header compression as becoming common for \nrunning normal TCP/IP protocols over serial lines.  Running raw X over the wire\nstill needs compression somewhere to make it usable.\n\nXRemote - this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originally\ndeveloped by NCD for squeezing the X protocol over serial lines.  In addition \nto using a low level transport mechanism similar to PPP/CSLIP, XRemote removes \nredundancies in the X protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and \nusing LZW to compress the entire data stream.  This work is done by either a \npseudo-X server or "proxy" running on the host or in a terminal server.  There \nare several advantages to doing compression outside the modem:\n   (1)	You don't *have* to have compressing modems in there if you wouldn't \n	otherwise be using them (e.g. if you were going to be directly \n	connected), and\n   (2)	It reduces the I/O overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that\n	have to cross the serial interface, and\n   (3)	In addition to the effects of #2, it reduces the latency in delivering \n	packets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for \n	blocks to compress.\n\nLBX - Low Bandwidth X; this is an X Consortium project that is working on a\nstandard for this area.  It is being chaired by NCD and Xerox and is using \nNCD's XRemote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol.  LBX\nwill go beyond XRemote by adding proxy caching of commonly-used information \n(e.g. connection setup data, large window properties, font metrics, keymaps, \netc.) and a more efficient encoding of the X protocol. The hope is to have a \nStandard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample \nimplementation available in R6.\n\nAdditional technical information about how XRemote works and a few notes on how\nLBX might be different are available via anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu\nin contrib/ in the following files:\n        XRemote-slides.ps               slides describing XRemote\n        XRemote-LBX-diffs.ps            more slides describing some of LBX\n\n[information provided by Jim Fulton, jim@ncd.com; 7/92]\n\n	There is also a set of slides on export from Jim Fulton's talk at\nthe 7th MIT X Technical Conference.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  17)  TOPIC: USING X IN DAY-TO-DAY LIFE\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  18)! What are all these different window managers?\n\n	The window manager in X is just another client -- it is not part of the\nX window system, although it enjoys special privileges -- and so there is\nno single window manager; instead, there are many which support different ways \nfor the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout,\ndecoration, and keyboard and colormap focus. In approximate chronological order\n(generally, the more recent ones are more conformant with the ICCCM):\n\n	wm: this simple title-bar window manager was phased out in R2 or R3\n	uwm: the Universal Window Manager is still popular for its speed, \nalthough it is very outdated. Moved to contrib/ on the R4 tape.\n	twm (old): Tom's Window Manager was among the first non-MIT window \nmanagers and offered the user a great deal of customization options in a\nre-parenting window manager. \n	awm: the Ardent Window Manager remains a hotbed for hackers and offers\nsome features (dynamic menus) not found on more current window managers\n	cwm: cwm is part of the Andrew system. \n	rtl: Siemen's window manager tiles windows so that they don't overlap\nand resizes the window with the focus to its preferred size.\n	dxwm: Digital's dxwm is part of the DECwindows offering\n	hpwm: HP's window manager offers a 3D look; it is a precursor of mwm\n	mwm: the Motif window manager is part of the OSF/Motif toolkit\n	tekwm: Tektronix's window manager offering \n	olwm (Sun): olwm implements the OPEN LOOK GUI and some of the Style\nGuide functionality\n	olwm (AT&T): ditto\n	gwm: Bull's Generic Window Manager emulates others with a built-in\nLisp interpreter. Version 1.7h (10/91) is on the R5 contrib tape; 1.7n is on\navahi.inria.fr and export.lcs.mit.edu. [3/93]\n	m_swm: the Sigma window manager is on the R4 tape\n	pswm: Sun's PostScript-based pswm is part of the OpenWindows release\n	swm: Solbourne's swm is based on the OI toolkit and offers multiple\nGUI support and also a panned virtual window; configuration information comes\nfrom the resources file\n	twm (new): MIT's new Tab Window Manager from the R4 tape is a reworked\ntwm and is the basis for several derivatives, including the one on the R5 tape\n	vtwm: vtwm offers some of the virtual-desktop features of swm, with a\nsingle-root window implementation; it is based on the R4 twm and is available\non archive servers. A new version, vtwm-5.0, is based on R5.9 and is available \nfrom export. [3/92]\n	tvtwm: Tom's Virtual Tab Window Manager is also based on the R4 twm\nand provides a virtual desktop modeled on the virtual-root window of swm. It is\navailable on archive servers\n	olvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to Sun's olwm. It is \navailable on archive servers; version 3.3 [1/93] is on export.\n	mvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to OSF's mwm. A beta version\nis floating around (most recently from suresh@unipalm.co.uk) but requires a \nsource license to OSF/Motif 1.1.3 [3/92].\n	NCDwm: the window manager local to NCD terminals offers an mwm look \n	XDSwm: the window manager local to Visual Technology's terminals \n	ctwm: Claude Lecommandeur's (lecom@sic.epfl.ch) modification of the R5 \ntwm offers 32 virtual screens in the fashion of HP vuewm; source is on export.\nVersion 2.2.2 [2/93] also offers the window overview used in vtwm and tvtwm.\n	vuewm: HP's MWM-based window manager offers configurable workspaces.\n	4Dwm: SGI's enhanced MWM\n	piewm: this version of tvtwm offers pie menus\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  19)  Why does my X session exit when I kill my window manager (sic)?\n\n	It needn't.  What is probably happening is that you are running your \nwindow manager as the last job in your .xsession or .xinitrc file; your X \nsession runs only as long as the last job is running, and so killing your \nwindow manager is equivalent to logging out. Instead, run the window manager in\nthe background, and as the last job instead invoke something safe like:\n		exec xterm -name Login -rv -iconic\nor any special client of your devising which exits on some user action.\nYour X session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window, \nwhether or not you kill or restart your window manager.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  20)  Can I save the state of my X session, like toolplaces does?\n\n	Although no known window manager directly supports such a feature --\nwhich may be equivalent to writing out a .xinitrc or .xsession file naming the\ngeometry and WM_COMMAND of each application (but olvwm may have something \nclose) -- there is a contributed application which does much of what you are \nlooking for, although it is not as complete as the SunView program toolplaces. \nLook for the application "xplaces" on an archive-server near you. There are \nseveral versions of this program floating around; look for a recent vintage.\n[10/90]\n	Some new pseudo session-managers such as HP's vuewm provide for the \nsaving of sessions including information on the geometry of currently-running\napplications and the resource database. \n[Bjxrn Stabell (bjoerns@staff.cs.uit.no); 3/93.]\n \n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  21)  How do I use another window manager with DEC's session manager?\n\n	DEC's session manager will start dxwm up by default. To override this, \nadd to your .Xdefaults file something like this line, naming the full pathname:\n	sm.windowManagerName:   /wherever/usr/bin/X11/your_favorite_wm\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  22)  How do I change the keyboard auto-repeat rate?\n\n	You can turn auto-repeat on or off by using "xset r on|off". The X\nprotocol, however, doesn't provide for varying the auto-repeat rate, which is\na capability not supported by all systems.\n	Some servers running on systems that support this, however, may provide\ncommand-line flags to set the rate at start-up time. If you have control over \nserver start-up (see the man pages for xinit and xdm), you can invoke the \nserver with the chosen settings; for example, you can start the Xsun server \nfrom MIT with the options "-ar1 350 -ar2 30" to reduce the sensitivity of the \nkeyboard.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  23)  How do I remap the keys on my keyboard to produce a string?\n\n	There is no method of arranging for a particular string to be\nproduced when you press a particular key. The xmodmap client, which is useful \nfor moving your CTRL and ESC keys to useful places, just rearranges keys and \ndoes not do "macro expansion."\n	Some (few) clients, including xterm and several X-based editors, \naccept a translation resource such as:\n	xterm*VT100.Translations: #override \\n		<Key>F1: string("setenv DISPLAY unix:0")\nwhich permits the shorthand F1 to be pressed to reset the display locally\nwithin an xterm; it takes effect for new xterm clients. To include control\ncharacters in the string, use \nnn, where nnn is the octal encoding of the\ncontrol character you want to include.\n	Window managers, which could provide this facility, do not yet; nor\nhas a special "remapper" client been made available.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDavid B.

How can we resist a questions that says something like this?\n\n\nIf your Expose event handler is truly intelligent about exposed\nrectangle information, then you can use XClearArea to generate an\nExpose event (assuming that your background pixel is not None) for the\nenclosing rectangle of your new item.\n\nThis is still not great, since any other items contained within that\nrectangle will still be unnecessarily redrawn.\n\nIf your Expose event handler simply redraws everything, you'll be\ndoing much more work than just drawing the new item "on top" of the\nexisting scene.

These are two common subjects so I hope someone has had to deal with these\nspecific questions.\n\n1.  If my application depends on modifiers, what is the best lookup method?\nMy choices are to call XGetModifierMapping() for each key press with a \nmodifier, or make the call once at the init of the app and store the modifiers\nin a lookup table.  I would like to do it the second way, but I can't seem to\nget the notify when the user uses xmodmap to remap the modifiers.  I know that\nwhen an app calls XSetModifierMapping() a MappingNotify event is generated\n(non-maskable) which I can pick up and modify my internal table.  But, I don't\nseem to get any notify events when the user uses xmodmap.  If I use Xt, all \nO'Reilly has to say is '...is automatically handled by Xt...'.  If I use Xlib, ala XNextEvent(), I get nothing.  This all stems from problems with users of \nthe Sun 4/5 keyboard and the NumLock; plus various Alt/Meta/etc. modifier \nrequirements.\n\n2.  I would like to place a popup so that it will be to the immediate right\nof my main window.  I want it at the same y coord, and their right/left\nsides touching.  What I need to ask for is the x,y coord of the window \nmanager's border for the main window.  This should ring a bell with anyone\nwho has called XtMoveWidget(), immediately checking the x,y after the move\nand seeing that it is right, and in their next callback asking for the x,y\nand seeing that it is now offset by the WM border.\n\nAny help would be most appreciated.

The MIT tapes come with documentation written by Keith Packard on the Shared\n  Memory Extension to X. Look in:  mit/doc/extensions/mit-shm.ms\n  I found this invaluble.

Alright.  Ignore this.  I have delved a bit deeper (XKeyEvent) and\nfound what I was looking for.\n\nev->state   has a bunch of masks to check against (LockMask is the one\nfor CapsLock).  Unfortunately, it appears that the NumLock mask varies\nfrom server to server.  How does one tell what mask is numlock and\nwhich are for Meta (Mod1Mask, Mod2Mask, Mod3Mask, Mod4Mask, Mod5Mask).\neg, SGI's vendor server has Mod2Mask being NumLock, whereas Solaris\n1.0.1 OpenWindows 3.0 has Mod3Mask for NumLock.  Is there an\nunambiguous means of determining NumLock's mask at runtime for any\ngiven server?  Sorry for the wasted bandwidth and my appalling ignorance.

Hi,\n\nI am about to write an application in X/Motif that will require the\nembedding of a pseudo tty. So, before I re-invent the wheel, has anyone\nwritten/gotten a motif widget that does the job ? Otherwise, I would\nappreciate any pointers to make such a beast.\n\nMy environment is X11R4/Motif 1.1 and X11R5/Motif 1.2 (if this helps).\n\n\nThanks in advance.
Hi, netters!\n\nI've just built X11R5 pl 21 under Solaris 2.1. I've used the multi-screen \npatch, as well as the R5.SunOS... patch and everything builds great, except \n"Cannot set default font path '[stuff deleted]'" and "Cannot set default font\n'fixed'". If I supply the -fp option, it doesn't complain about the font path\nbut still complains about the font. I have symlinks from /usr/lib/ to the \nplace where my distribution lives.\n\nCould somebody help me?\n\n	-joel\n\n-- \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJoel Reymont    !

It seems like XTranslateCoord. doesn't work the way I expecting it.  Right\nafter performs a XMoveWindow, I want to know the absolute window position\nwith respect to the root window.  To get this info. I do a XTranslateCoordinates\nbut the abs_x, and abs_y aren't right?  Does anybody know of a way to find \nout this information?\n\nThanks, please e-mail to hsteve@carina.unm.edu if it's possible
Yes.\n\n\nLook up XV_DEPTH.  Also, you might want to try using XView colormap segments\ninstead of Xlib for your colormap stuff.  They will probably be easier\nfor you to use, and since you are using a TrueColor visual, you won't\nbe losing anything compared to straight Xlib.
If it's any consolation, I have two 2-headed Sun-3/60 systems, though the\ncolor and mono monitors for each are "rated" 1152x900.   Their configuration\nis the same as yours, so it "should" be a Plug'N'Play situation, EXCEPT:\n\nI don't know if your hi-res mono monitor will function this way.  However,\nyou may simply be able to pull the motherboard and set the HI-RES jumper\n(located in the same jumper array as the jumpers for the RAM/SIMM selects\nand Ethernet connection) and be happily on your way.  When you pull the\nmotherboard, the jumpers are in the left-rear (e.g. "north-west") quadrant\nof the motherboard (to the left of the SIMM sockets).
Hi, Experts, \n\nI'm kind of new to X. The following question is strange to me. I am\ntrying to modify the contents of the colormap but failed without\nreason (to me).

(I also tried to draw a line using the colors but it \nturned out to be the unmodified colors.)\n\nSo what is my problem? How to modify the contents of the colormap?\n\nAny help/information will be appreciated.

I have just finished building X11R5 on a 386 running Interactive Unix (SysVR3)\nand I am having a problem with xterm.

Almost all window managers (twm, mwm, olwm and their derivates) support\nescape sequences for it. For your purpose put following into your\n.login (if you're using csh or tcsh), for sh you have to modify it.\n\nif ( "$term" == "xterm" ) then\n	echo "^[]2;${LOGNAME}@${HOST}^G^[]1;${HOST}^G"\nendif\n\nNote, ^[ stands for <Esc>, in vi you can enter it by pressing\nCtrl-V and the <Esc>. Same for ^G, it means Ctrl-G. In vi:\npress Ctrl-V and then Ctrl-G.\nThe first sequence puts the string into the title bar the second\nin the icon.\n\nBTW, you can also put the current working directory in the\ntitle bar if you make an alias for cd:\n\nalias cd 'cd \!* ; echo "^[]2;${LOGNAME}@${HOST}: ${cwd}^G"'\n\ngreetings,\nThomas
In the past, I have used named pipes to communicate between processes using\nthe XtAddInput function to set up the event handling in Motif. Does anybody\nknow of a way to do this with message passing ( IPC ) ? I tried it here and\nno luck so far.
Dear Xperts:\n\n  I want to place a specific group of icons in an icon box and\nhave my other icons appear outside of the box.  Does anyone\nknow if there's a way I can do this??  I'm using X11R5 and\nMotif 1.2.1.
The shell is waiting for the window-manager to respond to its\npositioning request.  The window-manager is not responding because\nit thinks the window is already in the right place.\n\nExactly *why* the two components get into this sulk is unclear to\nme; all information greatly received.
Don't know how to avoid the XOpenDisplay hang... but perhaps you could\nuse something else (such as zephyr, perhaps)?

We are currently evaluating GUI builders, initially for Motif but with\na wish to be flexible & portable.  We have been through the popular\nnames (UIMX, TeleUSE, XVT etc) and have been very impressed with what\nwe have seen of Galaxy from Visix.  I have spoken to current users\nfrom a list supplied by Visix (happy users as you would expect), and\nseen favourable comments on the net.  However, since it is fairly\nexpensive to get an evaluation license from Visix, I would like to\nquery the net for any negative experiences with Galaxy.  Did anybody\nevaluate them and prefer another tool or use Galaxy and regret it or\nfind any mis-features ?\n\nadvTHANKSance,\n\nPhil\n\n--

I need (probably) to write one or more new Motif widgets on the HP-UX\n   platform. Do I need the Motif private header files and source,\n   or can I make do with the public headers that are provided?\n   "Motif" includes Xt in this context.\n\nYes.  You'll find it almost impossible without the source\nat this point.  It does depend on how ambitious you are and\nhow concerned you are about compliance with the general\ninterface and items like traversal.\n\n   One widget is a multi-column list (which lots of people have\n   already written, I am sure), and would therefore be probably be\n   a subclass of List rather than something simple like an Xt class.\n   Is this more difficult (in principle, not lines of code)?\n\nI'm not sure what you're asking.  You could create something\nwhich is very much like a true multi-column list by placing\nseveral lists within a geometry manager,  and putting that\nmanager within an automatic scrolled window.  This wouldn't\nbe good for very large lists,  but you might consider this\nas an alternative.\n\n   Alternatively, if anyone has a multi-column list widget they\n   could sell me, this might save me from having to write one!\n   Does it by any chance exist in Motif 1.2 already (I do not\n   yet have the spec)?\n\nMotif 1.2 does not have a multi-column list in it.  Have you\nlooked at commercial sets?  There are also some PD \nwidget sets,  one of these might have a multi-column list\nyou could port.
Is there a PD version of cfb, or other PD server stuff, which has a colour frame\nbuffer implementation which works in bitplaned mode, i.e. where the screen\nmemory is grouped so that "bit 0 of every pixel is here, bit 1 is there, etc."\n\nThe only such beast I know if at the moment is the GfxBase server for the\nCommodore Amiga, and it is commercial. I don't know if they wrote their own cfb,\nbut I suspect they did.\n\nPlease respond by email, as I don't read this group.\n\nMany thanks\nDave
IMHO this whole discussion named "Motif looks like MS-Windogs" is totally\nstupid. The only thing remotely influenced here can be the Motif Window\nManager, that features an arrangement of buttons and menus somewhat\nsimiliar to this of the MS-W windowmanaging agent, however its name is.\nBut MWM is only a SMALL part of Motif, in fact, MWM and Motif can work\nwithout each other, and if one doesn't like MWMs outfit for some reason,\nhe switches to another windowmanager. All this doesn't influence Motif,\nwhich is a toolkit of widgets to write applications, and this toolkit\nis IMHO uncomparable to MS-W, because it is much more wellorganized and\nfeatures alot of goodies more than the MS-W interface.\n\nYou cannot say "A Porsche looks like a VW Käfer" ONLY because they have the\nwheel and the gear at the same position. Motif and MS-W are complete\ndifferent worlds, only one element of the Motif world has some gear and wheel\nat the same position as MS-W.

Is there any FAQ list for Programming in X windows?
The problem was that SunPost411Ld was not defined.
What I want to be able to do is to set the cursor\ncolor to the same as the forground color that is set\nfor that xterm.\n\nFrom the man page.....\n\n-cr color\n This option specifies the color to use for text cur-\n sor.   The  default  is  to  use the same foreground  <---\n color that is used for text.  <---\n\nHowever this doesnt seem to be the case, it appears to default to black\nor to whatever XTerm*cursorColor is set to.
I was having the same problems compiling X11R5 on a IPC sunos 4.1.3.\nIf you compile with 'make -k World' it will not stop on the\nld errors. As was stated in another post the clients with the\nerrors still run correctly.
Lucky dog... :-)\n\n\n\n\nIt applies with equal force to earlier versions.  Presumably only\nrecently did the author(s) decide it was important enough to mention.\nThe necessity it refers to has always been there, but it's been\nimplicit in the way CreateWindow requests default some attributes of\nthe new window.\n\n\n[...]\n\nThis is because the warning you read is incomplete.  You have to\nprovide not only a colormap but also a border.  The default border is\nCopyFromParent, which is not valid when the window's depth doesn't\nmatch its parent's.  Specify a border-pixmap of the correct depth, or a\nborder-pixel, and the problem should go away.\n\nThere is another problem: I can't find anything to indicate that\nCopyFromParent makes any sense as the border_width parameter to\nXCreateWindow.  Your Xlib implementation probably defines\nCopyFromParent as zero, to simplify the conversion to wire format, so\nyou are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero, due to the Xlib\nimplementation not providing stricter type-checking.  (To be fair, I'm\nnot entirely certain it's possible for Xlib to catch this.)\n\n					der Mouse
What I like about GUI's:\n\n	- The ability to view and manipulate a group of objects, files,\n	  text, directories, etc. and and manipulate them in some way\n	  such as delete, copy, paste, rename ...\n\n	- The ability to have several applications / screens visible\n	  and accessable at the same time.\n\n	- Being able to do a standard set of functions easily and\n	  quickly on an unfamiliar operating system. I am familiar with\n	  the command lines of several operating systems but occasionally\n	  I will have to some work on a system that I almost never use.\n	  If it has a GUI, I can usually accomplish what I want to do\n	  fairly easily, the command line on the other hand often is\n	  a long and painful experience.\n\n\nWhat I hate about GUI's:\n\n	- Having to switch between the mouse and the keyboard. I guess\n	  I have a strong one-handed preference. I like to use a\n	  computer with one hand and use the other for holding something\n	  like a piece of paper of a mug of tea. I have configured my\n	  favorite editor so that most of the editing functions can be\n	  done with one hand such as navigating, cutting, pasting,\n	  searching, opening and saving files, etc. The main thing I\n	  need to use both hands for is entering text.\n\n	I guess I need to get one of those mice with, like, 20 buttons\n	or something and then I will have the best of both worlds.
I have a question regarding the processing of program arguments\nsuch as the -geometry option. Since this is a standard X option, \nI'm wondering wether I have to parse it manually or whether there\nis some predefined function that will do this for me?
I am creating a graphics program using the Athena widgets. I use\nXlib routines to install a custom Graphics Contex by obtaining the display,\nand window variables with the XtWindowOfObject() and XtDisplayOfObject().\nThe object was one of the sub widgets.  \n  The problem occurs that whenever a button is pressed or a menu is selected\nthe graphic contex reverts to the orginal one. I tried moving the allocation\nof the graphic context before the allocation of the buttons but nothing\nchanged. I am preforming all of this manipulation before calling \nXtAppMainLoop().\n\nThank you for any help.\nLeslie Donaldson

Free options\n	The BEST option is XFree86, which is an enhanced version of X386 1.2.\n	Any other version of X386 will have slower performance, and will\n	be more difficult to compile.  Information on how to obtain XFree86\n	is listed below.\n\n	X386 is the port of the X11 server to System V/386 that was\n	done by Thomas Roell (roell@sgcs.com).\n	It supports a wide variety of SVGA boards.\n	There are 2 major free versions: X386 1.1 is based on X11R4,\n	X386 1.2 is included in MIT's X11R5 distribution (ie. you\n	don't need to patch it into the MIT source any more).\n	X386 1.3 is the current commercial offering from SGCS (see below).\n\n2.

What is XFree86?\n\n   XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which was distributed with\n   X11R5.  This release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and\n   other enhancements.  Here are the highlights of the enhancements:\n\n    1) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86,\n       selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file.  Some SpeedUps require\n       an ET4000 based SVGA, and others require a virtual screen width of\n       1024.  The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by\n       default.  With a high-quality ET4000 board (VRAM), this can yield\n       up to 40% improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2.\n    2) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default\n       operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected.  This mode is now\n       equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b (X11R4), and approximately\n       20% faster than X386 1.2.\n    3) Support for LOCALCONN, compile-time selectable for server, clients,\n       or both.  This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4.  For SVR4.0.4\n       with the 'Advanced Compatibility Package', local connections from\n       SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported.\n    4) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets.\n       Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about\n       the ATI and Trident drivers.\n    5) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (Thomas Eberhardt's\n       code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu).\n    6) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included, and is\n       compile-time selectable.  There are contributed Type1 fonts in the\n       contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu.\n    7) New configuration method which allows the server's drivers and font\n       renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary\n       distributions.\n    8) Integrated support for 386BSD, Mach, and Linux.\n    9) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA\n       cards is now included.\n\n   The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2\n   (they were not in XFree86 1.1):\n\n    1) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of\n       available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200 \n       (see the X386(1) manual page for more information).\n    2) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the\n       monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a "two\n       headed" server - one VGA, and one Hercules.  So far this has only\n       been tested on SVR4 (it is also reported to work under Linux).\n    3) SVR3 shared libraries, tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1.\n    4) Support for SVR4.2 (There are some special considerations to\n       consider, due to new USL bugs; see the README.SVR4 file for\n       more information.)\n    5) Support for PS/2 mice, and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan (some \n       versions of these devices were not previously compatible).\n    6) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor\n       timing data, written by Eric Raymond (derived from previous\n       documentation and a lot of experimentation).\n    7) Greatly improved support for international keyboards, including\n       implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many \n       vendor servers (see the X386keybd(1) manual page for more \n       information).\n    8) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has\n       been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of\n       0.1 MHz.  Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks\n       line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server.\n    9) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig\n       configuration file.  Error messages are much more informative\n       and intuitive, and more validation is done.  There are many new\n       options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file (see the X386(1) \n       manual page for more information on the format of this file).\n\n       Plus a number of other small things.  Refer to the CHANGELOG file\n       in the source distribution for full details.\n\n   Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond, and the\n   current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat.\n\n4. What OSs are supported?\n\n    XFree86 supports:\n	SVR4.2: Consensys V4.2\n	SVR4.0: Microport, Dell, Esix, ISC, AT&T, MST, Consensys, UHC\n	SVR3: ISC 2.2 & 3.0, AT&T 2.2\n	Linux, Mach 386, 386BSD 0.1\n\n	BSD/386 is not supported, but it should work. The most active\n	BSD/386 person is Greg Lehey <grog@lemis.de>.\n\n	Note that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet,\n	but anyone should feel free to submit patches.\n	If you are interested in tackling this, send mail to\n	xfree86@physics.su.oz.au\n\n5. What video hardware is supported?\n\n   At this time, XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets:\n\n	Tseng ET4000\n	Tseng ET3000\n	Paradise PVGA1\n	Western Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11 (these are supersets of\n		the PVGA1, and use its driver)\n	Genoa GVGA\n	Trident TVGA8900C, TVGA9000\n	ATI 18800, 28800\n\n	All of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes,\n	with the exception of the ATI chipsets, which are only supported in\n	256 color mode.\n\n	The monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of\n	video memory in a single bank, and the Hercules card.  On the\n	ET3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome\n	server, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k.\n\n	It appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to\n	non-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies.  To\n	avoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree86\n	1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel\n	clock.  This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are\n	discovered.  Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on how\n	these programs work, if you need to write one.  If you do develop such\n	a program, the XFree86 team would be interested in including it with\n	future XFree86 releases.\n\n	If you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86,\n	it is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as the\n	Orchid ProDesigner IIs.  Avoid recent Diamond boards; XFree86 will not\n	work with them, because Diamond won't provide programming details.\n	In fact, the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamond\n	products, as long as such policies remain in effect.  Contributions\n	of code will NOT be accepted (because of the potential liabilities).\n	If you would like to see this change, tell Diamond about it.\n\n	Some people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISA\n	video cards. Theoretically, the means of communication between the\n	CPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility. It\n	could be ISA, EISA, or local bus.  What should matter is the chipset\n	on the video card.  Unfortunately, the developers don't have a lot\n	of access to EISA or VLB machines, so this is largely an untested\n	theory.  However, we have yet to see any reports of things not\n	working on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86\n	working fine on them.\n\n6. What about accelerated boards?\n\n	At this time, there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boards\n	like the S3, ATI Ultra (8514/A), TIGA, etc.  This support is available\n	in commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink (for SVR3 and SVR4).\n\n	An S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux.  Contact\n	<hasty@netcom.com> for 386BSD or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk> for Linux.\n\n	A beta 8514/A server is available for Linux. Contact <martin@cs.unc.edu>\n	or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>. Note: these servers are NOT part of XFree86.\n\n7. Why doesn't XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes?\n\n	The reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the\n	16-color modes.  In 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memory\n	contains 1 pixel.  But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit-\n	planes.  Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each\n	of each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes.  The MIT frame-\n	buffer code is not designed to deal with this.  If VGA handled\n	16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the MIT code\n	could be modified to support this (or it already may; I'm not sure).\n	But for the VGA way of doing things, a complete new frame-buffer\n	implementation is required.  Some beta testers are looking into this,\n	but nothing is yet available from the project.\n\n8. What other hardware or software requirements are there?\n\n	Obviously, a supported SVGA board and OS are required.  To run\n	X efficiently, 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum.\n	The various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space, depending\n	on the OS (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries).\n	To build from sources, at least 80MB of free disk space will\n	be required, although 120MB should be considered a comfortable \n	lower bound.\n\n9. Where can I get source for XFree86?\n\n	Source patches for the current version (1.2, based on X11R5 PL22\n	from MIT), are available via anonymous FTP from:\n		export.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/XFree86)\n		ftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86)\n		ftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86)\n	(For the rest of this FAQ, these 3 location will be called $FTP)\n\n	Refer to the README file under the specified directory for information\n	on which files you need to get to build your distribution.\n\n10. Where can I get binaries for XFree86?\n\n	Binaries are available via anonymous FTP from:\n		ftp.physics.su.oz.au		- SVR4 binaries\n			under /XFree86/SVR4\n		ftp.win.tue.nl			- SVR4 binaries\n			under /pub/XFree86/SVR4\n		ferkel.ucsb.edu			- SVR4 binaries\n			under /pub/SVR4/XFree86\n		stasi.bradley.edu		- SVR4 binaries\n			under /pub/XFree86/SVR4\n		blancmange.ma.utexas.edu	- SVR3 (ISC) binaries\n			under /pub/ISC\n		ftp.prz.tu-berlin.de            - SVR3 (ISC) binaries\n			under /pub/pc/isc/XFree86\n		tsx-11.mit.edu			- Linux binaries\n			under /pub/linux/packages/X11\n		agate.berkeley.edu		- 386BSD binaries\n			under /pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86\n		ftp.cs.uwm.edu			- Mach binaries\n			under /i386\n\n	Ensure that you are getting XFree86 1.2 - some of these sites may\n	archive older releases as well.  Each binary distribution will\n	contain a README file that describes what files you need to take\n	from the archive, and which compile-time option selections were\n	made when building the distribution.\n\nIV) What general things should I know about running XFree86?\n\n11. Installation directories\n\n	The top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot\n	(/usr/X386, by default) variable in config/site.def. Binaries, include\n	files, and libraries are installed in $ProjectRoot/{bin,include,lib}.\n\n	This can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modified\n	via symbolic links for those OSs that support them. This directory is\n	nonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installed\n	alongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation.\n\n12. Configuration files\n\n	The XFree86 server reads a configuration file ("Xconfig") on startup.\n	The search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented in\n	the server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions.\n\n13. Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes\n\n	David E Wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of known\n	clock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings.\n	The database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt, and\n	is in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. This database is\n	also available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept on\n	export.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z, which is updated\n	occasionally.  Obtain a copy of this database.  It just might have the\n	settings you need.  If you create new settings, please send them to\n	David for inclusion in the database.\n\n	If this doesn't help you, the VideoModes.doc (by Eric Raymond) file \n	with XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings.\n	It may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and use\n	this description to get them right.  When you do, send the information\n	to David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database.\n\n	NOTE: The old 'clock.exe' program is not supported any more, and\n	      is completely unnecessary.  If you need to determine dot\n	      clock values for a new board, remove the 'Clocks' line from\n	      your Xconfig file (if present), and start the server.  The\n	      server will probe for clocks itself and print them out.\n	      You can use these values to put a 'Clocks' line into your\n	      Xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up\n	      starting the server in the future.\n\n14. Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit\n\n	If you have installed the server Binary Link Kit, it is possible to\n	reconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server.  This is\n	fully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit.\n\nV) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86?\n\n	First of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755).\n\n15. SVR4\n	Why won't my xterm run properly?\n\n	If your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should define\n	CONSEM=no in you environment. Otherwise xterm won't run.\n	csh users should use 'setenv CONSEM no'\n\n	The Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping\n	problems with XFree86.  It recommended that this patch not be\n	installed.  Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap.\n\n16. SVR3\n\n	Make sure you look at $FTP/README.ISC, if that's what you are running.\n\n17. 386BSD\n\n	Make sure you look at $FTP/README.386BSD.\n\n	Also, a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey\n	<Rich@Rice.edu>.  The latest version should be available in the\n	file XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites:\n\n	    agate.berkeley.edu:/pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\n	    wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\n	    grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\n\n18. Linux\n\n	You must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gcc\n	jump libraries installed.\n\n	Make sure the binaries X386, X386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root.\n\n	If your kernel doesn't have TCP support compiled in, you'll have to\n	run the server as "X -pn". The default startup configuration assumes\n	that TCP is not available. If it is, change the two files\n	/usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers, removing the\n	-pn argument to X386.\n\n	Make sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major\n	number 4, minor number 0. Also note that if /dev/console is not\n	owned by the user running X, then xconsole and xterm will not permit\n	console output redirection. Xdm will properly change the owner, but\n	startx won't.\n\n	When running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it with\n	a tty, for example "xdm < /dev/console &".\n\n	For more detailed information, please read the file README present\n	with the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu.\n\n19. Mach\n\n	Make sure you look at $FTP/README.Mach.\n\nVI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source?\n\n	This section has been removed from the FAQ, since it is\n	fully explained in $FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs.\n	Please look at those files for information on building XFree86.\n\nVII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86?\n\n20. BSD compatibility library\n\n	A lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy(), etc.\n	The default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.a\n	which contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(),\n	seed(). A better way of providing the 'b' functions is to include\n	<X11/Xfuncs.h> in source files that call them.  Xfuncs.h provides macro\n	definitions for these in terms of the SYSV 'mem' functions.  If you are\n	linking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these\n	functions, then you should link with libXbsd.a\n\n21. ANSICCOPTIONS\n\n	This is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the\n	ANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite\n	the entire CCOPTIONS line.  For example, with stock MIT, you'd see\n	something like\n		CCOPTIONS="-ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings"\n	and to get rid of the ANSI-ness, the developer would have to put\n		CCOPTIONS="-O2 -fwritable-strings"\n	in his Imakefile.  With this change, you would see a default of\n		ANSICCOPTIONS="-ansi"\n		CCOPTIONS="-O2 -fwritable-strings"\n	and all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is:\n		ANSICCOPTIONS=\n	to get rid of the ANSI-ness (many X clients will die a horrible death\n	with -ansi).  The effect is even more dramatic in practice, because\n	CCOPTIONS is actually quite complex.  The other issue is that one must\n	add 'ANSICCOPTIONS=$(ANSICCOPTIONS)' to a PassCDebugFlags definition.\n\nXFree86 Contact Information\n\n    Ongoing development planning and support is coordinated by the XFree86\n    Core Team.

Hi,
We developed a toolkit running on the X Window System.\nThe toolkit copes with any languages based on X11R5's i18n\nfacility. As you know, there are 2 kinds of i18n implementation from MIT's \nX11R5 release -- Xsi and Ximp. Our original implementation of the toolkit\nuses Xsi.\n\nOur toolkit manages each character's size based on our own font management system.\nIn order to do that, the 'wchar_t' typed character strings must be decomposed\nto character sets. This means that if one wchar_t type compound string with \nASCII and Kanji mixed, for example, is given, each element of the wchar_t\narray must be checked its corresponding character set based on a bit layout\nand application environment's locale. In this case if the locale is 'japanese',\neach wchar_t character will be classified either to iso8859-1, jisx0208 or so.\n\nWe need a function to do this. The function must check how many characters\nfrom the top are the same character set and what the character set is.\n\nWe could not find any public X11R5 function to do that and inevitably, used\nXsi's internal functions to construct that function. The following is the\nsource code of that function 'decomposeCharacterSet()'.\n\n\n//I18N.h\n// This may look like C code, but it is really -*- C++ -*-\n// $Id: I18N.h,v 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:24 iima Exp iima $\n\n#ifndef _I18N_H\n#define _I18N_H\n\n#include <X11/Xlib.h>\n\nextern int decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str,	/* IN */\n				 int wc_len,		/* IN */\n				 char *buf,		/* OUT */\n				 int *buflen,		/* IN/OUT */\n				 int *scanned_len,	/* OUT */\n				 char **charset);	/* OUT */\nextern XmString wcharToXmString(const wchar_t *wc_str);\nextern XmStringCharSet charsetOfWchar(const wchar_t wc);\n\n#endif /* _I18N_H */\n\n//I18N.cc\n/* $Id: I18N.cc,v 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:05 iima Exp $ */\n\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <X11/Xlibint.h>\n#include <Xm/Xm.h>\n#include "I18N.h"\n\nextern "C" {\n#include <X11/wchar.h>\n#define _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset XXX_XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset\n#define _Xmbfscs XXX_Xmbfscs\n#define _Xmbctidtocsid XXX_Xmbctidtocsid\n#include "Xlocaleint.h"\n#undef _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset\n#undef _Xmbfscs\n#undef _Xmbctidtocsid\n    extern int _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(XLocale, const wchar_t*, int,\n					 char*, int*, int*, int*);\n    extern Charset *_Xmbfscs(XLocale, _CSID);\n    extern _CSID _Xmbctidtocsid(XLocale, _CSID);\n};\n\nint decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str,/* IN */\n			  int wc_len,		/* IN */\n			  char *buf,		/* OUT */\n			  int *buf_len,		/* IN/OUT */\n			  int *scanned_len,	/* OUT */\n			  char **charset)	/* OUT */\n{\n    XLocale xlocale = _XFallBackConvert();\n    int ctid;\n    int status;\n    Charset *xcharset;\n    \n    status = _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(xlocale, wc_str, wc_len, buf,\n				       buf_len, scanned_len, &ctid);\n    if (status == Success) {\n	xcharset = _Xmbfscs(xlocale, _Xmbctidtocsid(xlocale, ctid));\n	*charset = (xcharset) ? xcharset->cs_name : NULL;\n    }\n    else\n	*charset = NULL;\n    return status;\n}\n----------------\n\nAn included file above, "Xlocaleint.h", is also Xsi internal and we copied\nthe file to the toolkit directory and compiled.\n\nA serious issue occured when we tried to compile a toolkit application on\nour HP machine with its OS version of HP-UX9.01.\n\nWhen we tried to link an application based on our toolkit,\nlink errors occured saying that the following functions are missing:\n    _Xmbctidtocsid (code)\n    _Xmbfscs (code)\n    _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset (code)\n    _XFallBackConvert (code)\n\nWe had used MIT release version of X11R5 and its Xsi implementation until\nHP-UP9.0 and ran applications successfully. One of the reasons to use Xsi was that\nbecause HP did not release HP's X11R5 until the OS 9.0 and we had no way to \nknow how HP's R5 would be implemented. We had hoped Xsi's popularity and used \nits internal functions. \n\nThe HP's linker complains that there are no Xsi internal functions implemented.\nWe observe from HP's libX11.a, they used some Ximp implementation but we are\nnot sure if they used MIT's vanilla Ximp version or their own version of Ximp and\ntherefore, finding just counter part functions in MIT's Ximp for Xsi does not\nseem to lead us a solution.\n\nMy question and goal is to know how we can construct a function like\n'decomposeCharacterset()' listed above. Is there any function to check\ncharacter set of each element of wchar_t type strings depending on locales?\nIf it is a public function, that is perfect but even if it is not, we\nwant to use any internal functions in HP's X11R5 as we did for MIT's R5.\n\nIn order to render a 'wchar_t' type string, there must be some machinery\nto judge character sets and that is how the proper fonts are selected for\nthe string. We have no way to find out that without any HP's X11R5 source \nfiles. We want to know how we can use that for our goal. \nAny help or comments would be highly appreciated.\n\nI also appreciate if anyone tell me about Ximp treating around this area\neven if it is not HP's implementation.\n\nThank you.
I am glad and proud to announce the new mailing-list for the PD Motif C++\nbindings. I got over 40 replies in about one week of people interested in\nsuch a list, and the software has now been properly installed, so the list\nis now up and running. For those interested in joining, please send e-mail\nto that extend to 'motif++-request@cv.ruu.nl' or 'rvloon@cv.ruu.nl'.\n\nThe blurb everyone who joins gets follows, as well as the original \nannouncement for where Motif++ can be obtained.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n8< - 8< -\n\n\nWelcome to the Motif++ Mailing List!\n\nThe Motif++ mailing list is a mailing list dedicated to Motif++, the PD C++\nwrapper library for Motif, where people can ask questions about Motif++, \nswap stories, and give new ideas about new directions and improvements for the \nbindings. \n\nAll requests of an administrative nature, like subscription, removal, etc.\nshould be directed to motif++-request@cv.ruu.nl\n\nAll e-mail sent to motif++@cv.ruu.nl will be sent to the entire list, so\nplease make sure when using 'vacation' type programs that will reply to\nmessages automatically, that the address for the mailing-list is excluded \nfrom auto-replies.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nRonald van Loon     | In theory, there is no difference \n(rvloon@cv.ruu.nl)  | between theory and practice.\n3DCV Group, Utrecht |   \nThe Netherlands     | In practice however, there is.\n\n8< - 8< -\n\nHello Motif World,\n\nover the past half year there have been a lot of relatively minor changes to\nthe Motif++ bindings. Imake support has been improved, a few defaults have\nbeen changed, and a lot of other small things have been added.\n\nThis is basically a release which drops the 'gamma' status. Next release will\nincorporate some improvements by Stefan Schwarz, and possibly will support\nX11R5 and Motif 1.2.x.\n\nNote to all of those who keep copies of the archive: please retrieve this\ndistribution (during off-peak hours), and delete all previous copies.\n\nHere is the original ANNOUNCEMENT:\n\nHISTORY\n\nThe University of Lowell, supported by a grant of the Open Software Foundation,\nhas developed a wrapper-library, that encapsulates Motif widgets in C++\nclasses. All resources of these Widgets can now be set through\nmember-functions, while objects can be used in callback-functions. The library\nwas made available for free or nominal cost for anonymous ftp at 129.63.1.1.\nHowever, the library contained a large number of bugs and oversights, and only\nworked under X11R3. Due to lack of subsequent fundings, the bindings are no\nlonger actively supported by the University of Lowell.\n\nI, Ronald van Loon, at a certain point last year, have taken the Lowell \nbindings, fixing the bugs I came across, adding missing memberfunctions, and\nenhancing functionality and made the bug-fixed library available for the\ngeneral public for anonymous ftp (made possible by Rick Murphy at DEC).\n\nNEW RELEASE\n\nI am now pleased to announce a new and updated release of the Motif++\nbindings. \n\nThis release offers:\n\n- Full Motif1.1 and X11R4 support\n- Support for Xbae widgetset \n- Two additional widgets, written by myself, that can be used to indicate\n  progress in an application.\n- Imake support. NB: this release relies heavily on the existence of imake\n		     and its config files on your site. I have tried to\n		     provide the bindings with a standard Makefile, tweakable\n		     for those unfortunates without imake. I have not severely\n		     tested the standard Makefile though. Contact me if you\n		     have problems. The reason for calling this a gamma\n		     release lies in the fact that I do not have a multitude\n		     of platforms to test the Imake-files on.\n- Lots of testfiles (even somewhat useful programs)\n- An article I wrote on the usage of Motif, X and C++, previously posted\n  on Usenet.\n\nWHERE TO GET THE NEW MOTIF BINDINGS\n\nFtp:\n\nAnonymous ftp at decuac.dec.com (192.5.214.1), directory /pub/X11.\n\nNote:\n\nPlease be patient as the network link is quite slow. Please do not FTP large\nfiles during working hours.\n\nAlso note that there is also a motif++.31.jan.92.tar.Z file at this site; this\nis an old version of the bindings.\n\nE-mail:\n\nThose who don't have ftp can send me e-mail, and I will send the bindings by\ne-mail.\n\nREQUEST\n\nThose who use the bindings and find bugs, or see room for improvement, please\ncontact me, and I will try to incorporate them in a future release (in case of\nbugs, a bug-fix of course ;-). \n\nMORE INFORMATION \n\nContact me at "rvloon@cv.ruu.nl".\nIf you are desperate, then you can call me at\n+31 30 506711 (that is Utrecht, the Netherlands; those within the Netherlands\ncall 030-506711).\n\nEnjoy!
I have the March/April version of the X Journal open in front of me.\n\nI'll be working on programming x-clients this summer, and since I don't have\nmuch experience with programming X, I thought this issue might be helpful\nas it has a section on debugging, and a section on the 40 most common errors\nin programming X.\n\nAt the end of the errors section, there are the following references for\ntutorials on X programming style.  They are:\n\nRosenthal, David -   A simple X11 client program\n  Proceedings of the Winter 1988 Usenix Conference, 1988.\n\nLemke, D., and Rosenthal, D. -  Visualizing X11 clients\n  Proceedings of the Winter 1989 Usenix Conference, 1989.\n\n\nDoes anyone know where I could find these in printed or (preferably)\nelectronic form?\n\nOr can you suggest any net resources devoted to the introduction to\nprogramming X (I'll be looking at the bookstore for books, so I am really\nonly asking about what I can find on the net.)\n\nThanks,\n\nDavid Simpson

I am having problems with a  Motif application that when run on another machine\n(with different X paths, etc) can't find the XKeysymDB file.   This causes a large\nwarning output:\n\nWarning: translation table syntax error: Unknown keysym name: osfActivate\nWarning: ... found while parsing '<Key>osfActivate:ManagerParentActivate()'\nWarning: translation table syntax error: Unknown keysym name: osfCancel\nWarning: ... found while parsing '<Key>osfCancel:ManagerParentCancel()'\nWarning: translation table syntax error: Unknown keysym name: osfSelect\nWarning: ... found while parsing '<Key>osfSelect:ManagerGadgetSelect()'\n...\n....\n....\netc.\n\nas the file is in a different location, but Xt seems to only look for it in\nthe place where it is on the machine the app was compiled on.  Is there any\nway to read the XKeysymDB manually with an X/Xt call so that additions to\nthe XKeysymDB can be distributed with the application ?  I have used trace(1)\nto find out what was going on, but I need a fix so that these translations in\nthe application can be recognised.

You wanna do masking. Build a bitmap (pixmap of depth one) where all pixels\nyou name "opaque" are 1 (that get copied) and the others are 0. Use this\nbitmap as the clip_mask in the gc used for XCopyArea(), and remember to\nadjust the clip_origin coordinates to the XCopyArea() blit origin.\n\nThe Mouse pointer (besides from that it is driven using RAMDAC analog\nmapping on most hardwares) uses a mask, too.\n\nBut be warned: blitting through a mask and especially moving around this mask\nis annoying slow on most xservers... it flickers even at 40 MIPS...

Dear Xperts,\n\nI'm developing an application that uses a Motif slider to select\nan image file out of a directory. Now I would like to display the\nname of the file corresponding to the value of the dragged scale\nbutton (i.e. with the MB1 pressed). As XmNshowValue only displays\nthe current value of the scale button and not the actual corresponding\nimage file name, I thought of using an XtAddEventHandler to do\nthe mapping between the scale value and the file name:\n\nXtAddEventHandler(scaleImage,Button1MotionMask,  FALSE, SliderMoved, NULL);\n\n\nand in the eventhandler do a:\n\n  while (XCheckTypedWindowEvent (display, event->window, MotionNotify, &Return))\n   ;\n  XmScaleGetValue(scaleImage,&value);\n  /*map value to file entry in directory and finally obtain file name to open*/\n\n\nHowever, when I move the pointer in the scale widget I get callbacks, with of co\n   urse\na null effect as my MB1 is not pressed to move the scale button. So what is goin\n   g wrong?\nOr is the a wrong approach to this problem?\nAny hints are highly appreciated.
As applied to servers, the first three are fuzzy terms.  "multi-headed"\ntends to be used for any system with multiple monitors, sometimes even\nmultiple screens even if they're multiplexed onto the same monitor (eg,\na Sun with a cg4 display).  "multi-screen" and "multi-display" would,\nif taken strictly, mean different things, but since the strict meaning\nof "multi-display" would refer to a system with multiple keyboards and\npointers, when it's used it probably refers to the same thing\n"multi-screen" would: a system that provides multiple Screens.\n\n"zaphod" is a term applied to the way the MIT server switches the\npointer from one screen to another by sliding it off the side of the\nscreen.\n\n\nThere is a protocol limitation that restricts a given Display to at\nmost 255 Screens.  I know of no server that handles multiple Displays\non a single invocation, unless possibly my kludges to the R4 server can\nbe looked upon as such; on a TCP-based system there is necessarily a\nlimit of 65535 Displays per machine, but this is not a limitation\ninherent to X.\n\nWhat you read was most likely talking about a limit in some particular\nimplementation (probably the MIT one).  If it claimed there was a limit\nof 12 inherent to X, the author of the article had no business writing\nabout X.\n\n					der Mouse
Is there aything available for X similar to QuicKeys for the Macintosh --\nsomething that will allow me to store and playback sequences of keystrokes,\nmenu selections, and mouse actions - directing them towards another\napplication?\n\nIf so, could someone send me information on its availability -- and if not,\nhow hard do we think it might be to send input to other X applications and,\nhopefully, deal with their responses appropriately?  (If an application is\ngoing to take a few seconds to process I probably have to wait  for it to\ncomplete before sending another command.)\n\nthanks,
I am in the process of installing X11R5 on my Sun Sparcstation 2 and\nhave run into a problem.  I imagine it has something to do with a missing\nscreen driver, or something along those lines, but figured someone out there\nin Internet land might be able to help.\n\nI am installing it on a machine that already has OpenLook installed, and would\nlike to have both installed concurrently.  Thus, I set it up to compile to my\n/usr/X11R5 directory.  I worked out all the kinks in getting it compiled (with\ngcc), so that it compiles without any warnings.  I need it installed for PEX-SI,\nso I set all those appropriate flags.  When I run it, however, I get a message\nalong the lines of:\n\nGetting interface configuration : Operation not supported on socket\n\nsunOpenFrameBuffer : Inappropriate ioctl for device\n\nFatal server error : no screens found \n\n\nAny ideas on how I can fix it?  Please respond by e-mail at the below\naddress.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n-Dan\n-- \n"I do not want to be immortalized through my works; I want to be \nimmortalized through not dying."  -Woody Allen
I *think* this is correct behavior.  Remember the default\ncolormapFocusPolicy is keyboard (meaning the cmap focus follows the\nkeyboard focus).  Since the dialog is modal, mwm won't allow keyboard\nfocus onto your main shell, and so it won't allow cmap focus either.\n\nSince it sounds as though you have keyboardFocusPolicy:pointer, I\nsuggest you set colormapFocusPolicy:pointer also.  That way, the cmap\nfocus won't slavishly follow keyboard focus, but will beat its own path.\n\n(if you have keyboardFocusPolicy: explicit, you can set cmap focus\nexplicit also, but you then need a binding to f.focus_color, probably on\nMB1).

You can generally tell the difference\njust by using it.  If the cursor blinks a lot when there's screen activity,\nit's probably a software cursor.  If it has a hardware cursor, I think you're\nprobably battling a bug in HP's X server.  I'm not familiar with any hardware\ncursor chips that display cursors greater than 64x64.  It's quite possible\nthat the server is just echoing your preferred cursor size without actually\nchecking it.  I vaguely recall that very old MIT server revisions did just \nthat.\n\nIn reality you're probably stuck with a 64x64 maximum size cursor regardless\nof what the server returns.

There is a widget already defined for GL.  It is the GlxMDraw (motif) or\nGlxDraw (athena) widget.  It is similar to a XmDrawingArea, except that it\nallows you to use GL calls to render into the window.  Look at glxlink,\nglxunlink, glxgetconfig, and glxwinset in the man pages.\n\n\nThe GlxMDraw widget works pretty well.  OpenGL will be an improvement.\n\n\nI think GL is a little easier to use and a little more powerful, but\nthat's just an opinion.  Mileage may vary.

Try posting to comp.sys.sgi for more information.\nBetter still,you will find most of the answers in the  SGI manuals .. there\nis a little transition guide which explains the "mixed-model programming"\nparadigm(Mixing X and GL).\n\n: |> Does PEX (graPHIGS?) have the same functionality of GL?\n: \n: I think GL is a little easier to use and a little more powerful, but\n: that's just an opinion.  Mileage may vary.\n\nWell, PEX is designed as an extension to  X and will be more seamless  but \nthen, it is buggy to start with .. opinions again.\n\n      __                  \n     (_   / /  o_   o  o |_\n     __)/(_( __) (_(_ /_)| )_
Hi,\n     I just got myself a Gateway 4DX-33V and trying to configure\nX11R5 for it.  Has anyone done this before ?  More specifically,\nI need a correct Xconfig file entry that is set up for my \ngraphics card and monitor.  I have a 15" Color CrystalScan 1572FS monitor\nand a VESA LOCAL BUS ATI Ultra Pro with 1MB VRAM video card.\n\nAny help will be extremely appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nPlease send replies to christy@alex.qc.ca
Hello networld,\n\nI'm looking for an X mailreader. Is there a Xelm?\n\nAndreas
[posted for a friend]\n\nOkay, I looked through the FAQs and didn't see this, but I know its\ncome up before...\n\nXAllocColor is supposed to do the following in order:\n    Try to find an exact match read-only color cell. (within hardware limits)\n    Try to allocate a read-only colorcell and set it to match.\n	and when all else fails, \n    Return the colorcell with the best match from the read-only colors \n    already allocated in the colormap.\n\nThis sounds good in theory.  It doesn't seem to work this way\nthough.  If there is no exact match already in the colormap, and \nno unallocated cells, then XAllocColor fails, even when it has \nalready allocated several other cells already, and there are dozens \nof read-only cells already in the colormap.\n\nIs this a bug?  A feature?  A misunderstanding on my part?\n\nAny help appreciated,
Contents:Problems with table widgets in R5\n\n	The following part of a program (an user interface for a simulation\n	system) did work in R4, but refused to in R5. Of cause, the R4-version\n	did not know about the xpTableWidgetClass (we used tableWidgetClass 			instead - caught from the net in times of R3) and XpTableChildPosition 			(formerly XtTblPosition).\n	Since compiling with R5, the program causes a zero width or height error\n	(on sparc-stations). The trouble-shooter is the (re)computation of the\n	model_init_table - table widget: though its childs (label and asciiText \n	widgets) exist, XtQueryGeometry returns a prefered width and height of 			zero. \n	Thus the following asignment cannot perform anything else but set the 			width and height of the newly created widget to zero. No wonder XtPopup 		or XtManage- Child create zero width or height errors (dependent on 			whether width and height of the shell widget are set in the resource 			file or not).\n	\n	Question: Does anyone know, why XtQueryGeometry returns so low prefered\n			values when working on table widgets or perhaps what\n			to do about?\n\n	I'll be happy, if someone is able to help me. \n	Germans are requested to answer in german.\n	\n	Siegfried Kaiser\n	email: kaiser@uniko.uni-koblenz.de\n\n	\n	The part of interest:\n\n\n	/* Graphischer Neuaufbau des Model-Init-Formulars */\n		/* Storing the old width and height of the viewport-	*/\n		/* widget, which is the parent of the troubling table	*/\n		/* widget, before the viewport widget is destroyed	*/\n		/* The destroying of widgets before resizing them is a	*/\n		/* relict from R3-age					*/\n	\n	if (model_init_popped_up) \n		XtUnmapWidget(model_init_form_view);\n	XtDestroyWidget(model_init_form_view);\n	\n		/* Creating the subtree within the shell, of which the	*/\n		/* root is the viewport widget				*/\n	\n	n = 0;\n	XtSetArg(args[n],XtNfromVert,model_init_title); n++;\n	XtSetArg(args[n],XtNfromHoriz,model_init_button_view); n++;\n	XtSetArg(args[n],XtNallowVert,True); n++;\n	XtSetArg(args[n],XtNforceBars,True); n++;\n	model_init_form_view = XtCreateWidget("form_view",viewportWidgetClass,\n					      model_init_form,args,n);\n\n	n = 0;\n	model_init_table = XtCreateWidget("table",xpTableWidgetClass,\n					  model_init_form_view,args,n);\n\n		/* create_form_widget does create and position table	*/\n		/* widget's childs.

Dear Folks:\n\nIt's a pleasure to be able to announce the release of a new freeware program, \nXavier, an audio and video  extension to InterViews.\n\nXavier(eXtension AV class for IntERviews) is a C++ class library\nthat adds multimedia capability to InterViews. It allows composite\nmultimedia objects to be built from media objects.\n\nSpecifically, it adds audio and video objects to the classes available\nin InterViews 3.0.1/3.1, and it does so without changing the\nsource code for the original classes (though several configuration\nfiles for InterViews need to be changed via a patch file). \n \nCurrently, the Xavier audio classes are only supported on SUN\nworkstations with an audio interface, such as the SPARCstation2.\n\nXavier has been tested in the following environments:\n\nSUN:\n  Machine : SPARCserver470 SPARCstation-IPC\n  OS      : SUN-OS4.1.1 or later\n  C++     : SUN C++ ver2.1\n\nNEC(EWS):\n  Machine : EWS4800/210,230\n  OS      : EWS-UX/V(Rel4.0) WSOS41 Release5.1,Release5.2\n  C++     : C++ Release3.1\n\nIt can be obtained via anonymous ftp from \n\n         interviews.stanford.edu in /pub/contrib/\n          (Xavier.large-demo.tar, and Xavier.tar)\n\nWe are preparing a mailing-list for information regarding Xavier.\nIf you are interested, please contact\n               \n                   xavier@tsl.cl.nec.co.jp. \n\nI will add your e-mail address to our list.\n\n[Reference]\no Rei Hamakawa, Hizekazu Sakagami, Jun Rekimoto:\n  Audio and Video Extension to Graphical Interface Toolkits,\n  The Third International Workshop on Network and Operating\n  System Support for Digital Audio and Video, San Diego, 1992

You are right in supposing that the problem is with the XmNcolormap\n(XtNcolormap for truly literate beings) not being set.  What you want\nto do is start your application with your new colormap.  This can be a\nchicken and egg sort of problem, however.  If you look at the Xt FAQ\nthere is an example that should show how it can be done.  If not, let\nme know and maybe I can improve the example.\n\n--pete
try this after XCreateWindow:\n-----------------------------\n\n#include <X11/Xutil.h>\n\nDisplay display;\nWindow window;\n\n{\n  XSizeHints *xsizehints = XAllocSizeHints ();\n  xsizehints->flags = USPosition | USSize;	/* or = PPosition | PSize */\n  xsizehints->x = 42;\n  xsizehints->y = 42;\n  xsizehints->width = 100;\n  xsizehints->height = 100;\n  XSetWMNormalHints (display, window, xsizehints);\n  XFree (xsizehints);\n}\n\nThese hints tell the window manager that the position and size of the window\nare specified by the users and that the window manager should accept these\nvalues. If you use xsizehints->flags = PPosition | PSize, this tells the window\nmanager that the values are prefered values of the program, not the user.\nI don't know a window manager that doesn't place the window like you prefer if\nyou specify the position and size like above.\n\nGreetings from Berlin,
"return_place" is probably incorrect.  It should be a pointer, not an\ninteger.  XGetWindowProperty() allocates memory, copies the data there,\nand returns a pointer to the memory.  You should free the memory when\nyou're done.

How similar is it to InterViews?  If I code to InterViews,\nwill my code work with Fresco?  How about Motif?  I've heard some mention\nof versions of InterViews which support Motif.

Hi,\n\nI just got XFree86 running on my pc with Consensys and encountered a few\nminor (I hope) probems.\n\nThe pc is hooked up to a LAN where I want remote X applications to \nconnect to my X-server.  I believe the command to permit this is\nxhost.  When I'm logged on my pc and type 'xhost + '  ,  I get the error message saying\n"You must be on local machine to enable access". \nwhat does this mean ?  ain't I already on the local machine?\n\nAnother problem I have is with the mouse movement.

i am in need of a motif-based graphing package to integrate into a large\nsoftware package under development for distribution to universities.  it\ncan be either public domain or commercial, although a commercial package\ncan't have royalties required for binary only distribution.  we need 2-d\ngraphing capabilities at a minimum, but 3-d  would be nice.  any info would\nbe appreciated and i will summarize if there is interest.\n\nthanks,\nmitch
The reason they place their outside corner at the location you requested\nis because that's what the ICCCM says they should do.\n\n\nThis code will almost certainly break.  Calling XMapWindow and then\nXFlush does not guarantee that the window is visible and managed by the\nwindow manager.  Even if this did work, there isn't a reliable way to\nfind out how much decoration the window manager placed around your\nwindow, so you don't know how far to move it.  And what if the window\nmanager refuses to move your window?
Begging everyone's pardon, I was not slamming Motif, nor was I necessarily \nplugging/flaming the two.  I was responding to the sweet blithe statement in:\n <rick.734610425@digibd> from rick@digibd.digibd.com (Rick Richardson)\n\nrick> This is one area where Microsoft NT has a big advantage.  Since\nrick> they control the whole show, there are no issues like this where\nrick> licensees create incompatible defacto standards.\n\nThis happy statement shows a mindset that inventors and companies have when\nthey are pleased with something that works, and they believe that others will\nalso be happy to use it.  I remember when _SunView_ was hot stuff (and am not,\nby that statement, endorsing Sun and its products, this is just my experience),\nand when OpenWindows became hot stuff, that was when I started hearing, as\nmentioned before, the "socialistic masses" that were bent on destroying \n_anything_ that was deemed proprietary, including OpenWindows.  I mentioned\nMotif in the same breath, because that is what Sun has decided to turn its\nattention to, not because I hate it.  Mr. Richardson's position, I believe, is\na healthy one, and I am sure that the seething hackers will soon try to\nflame and destroy NT, if it ever shows up, wanting instead everything to be\nfree, and then complaining when there is no organized structure and there are \nno de facto standards.\n\nIt was just a vent for frustration brought on by prevailing winds.
We recently got an NCD X-terminal to evaluate. This is running XRemote over\na serial line.\nI wanted to get some measurement of response time, so I wrote a small Xlib\nprogram which simply creates a window, maps it and sends the first Expose \nevent to itself. The program times the delay from sending the event, to \nreceiving it.  I thought this was the simplest way to test client/X-server \nround-trip delays. It's a similar concept to the ping(8C) program.\n\nIs this a valid test to perform ? I've also tried the xbench program, available\nfrom ftp.uu.net, which bombards the server with graphics operations, but I \njust wanted to get a quantative measure of what is "acceptable" interactive \nresponse time. Has anyone got any ideas on this subject ?\n\nThanks.\nAndrew. (afielden@mlsma.att.com)
I find this thread on motif accelerators absoultly amazing.  If I were\nwriting an interface to keyboard accelerators, I would have one\nresource called "accelerators" that took a translation table, period.\nI would also implement it so that programmer never has to do any work\nto get the accelerators installed.  As soon as the end-user specified\none, it would be active and automatically installed.\n\nTo get multiple accelerators on a single menu item I'd do something like:\n\n	*menuItem.accelerators: #override \n\\n		Ctrl<Key>M:	fire() \n\\n		Shift<Key>L:	fire() \n\n\nThe accelerators would work exactly like translations and you would\nautomatically see a "Ctrl M" show up in your menuItem object.\n\nWhy in the world is the motif stuff so complicated with so many different\nspecial cases depending on what type of widget you're dealing with?  There\nhas to be some reason.\n\nSorry for the political tone of this message...
Hi out there!\n\nI'm looking for (mechanic-construction)CAD-software either PD-sources\nor Sun 3-binaries (respective the licence.. :-).\nWho knows _ANY_ package (and a source/site to get it..) ?\n\nThx, Fabian
See subject. An opportunity for sales-people (-persons? -entities?).\n\nI am looking for a commercial/PD graphics editor with fairly limited\nabilities that runs under X and preferably uses Motif widgets. It must\nrun on HP-UX version 9, either with or without the PEX extension. The\nsort of things I want are simple drawing, resizing and moving of objects\nsuch as lines, rectangles and text. Bounding rectangle operations are\nsufficient for object selection. Ideally it should also allow the\ncreation and placement of more complex objects such as widgets (e.g.\ntext entry fields or labels), but this is not mandatory.\n\nDoes anyone have such an animal? If you do, please mail me with details\nincluding price (especially run-time licensing since it must be\nincluded in a product). Alternatively, send glossies to me at Logica,\n68 Newman Street, London W1, including technical info please. For PD\nstuff, I have some effort that could be put into porting.\n\nThanks for any help,\nNicholas Young.

(Command-line flag is -ghbnie.) \n o Explicitly pop down all dialog boxes when document view\n   window is closed, for window managers too dull to do so\n   themselves. \n o Better visited anchor color for non-SGI's. \n o Added .hqx and .uu to list of file extensions handled like .tar files. \n o Added 'Clear' button to Open box, to allow more convenient\n   cut-n-paste entries of URL's. \n o New resource 'autoPlaceWindows'; if set to False, new document\n   view windows will not be automatically positioned by the\n   program itself (but it's still up to your window manager just how\n   they're placed). \n o Command-line flags -i and -iconic now have desired effect (new\n   resource initialWindowIconic can also be used). \n o Gif-reading code is a little more bulletproof. \n o Obscure infinite loop triggered by extra space in IMG tag fixed. \n o Eliminated nonintuitive error message when image can't be read\n   (inlined NCSA bitmap is indication enough that something's not\n   right for authors, and readers can't do anything about bad images\n   in any case). \n o Obscure parsing bug (for constructs like <ADDRESS><A\n   HREF=...>text<A></ADDRESS>) fixed. \n o Fixed mysterious stupid coredump that only hits Suns. \n o Fixed stupid coredump on URL's like '://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/'. \n o Fixed buglet in handling rlogin URL's. \n o New support for Solaris/SYSVR4 (courtesy\n   dana@thumper.bellcore.com). \n o Better support for HP-UX 8.x and 9.x (courtesy\n   johns@hpwarf.wal.hp.com). \n o Better support for NeXT (courtesy scott@shrug.dur.ac.uk). \n o Some miscellaneous portability fixes (courtesy\n   bingle@cs.purdue.edu). \n o Miscellaneous bug fixes and cleanups. \n\nComments, questions, and bug reports should be sent to\nmosaic-x@ncsa.uiuc.edu.

Well I can buy a bigger and more powerful server machine because of the \nsignificant drop in price year after year.  The link I want to use \nthough (ISDN 64K) is costly and the bandwidth limited.  That's why my\ninterest lies in seeing if such a link can be used and see what traffic \ngoes through it.\n\n\n\nHmmm.  Has anyone at your centre monitored the traffic at all?  Are you\nrunning any standard MS-Windows programs like Word ?  What sort of \npackets go blazing through? What size link do you have (2Mb or 10Mb ?).\nWhat is the average traffic flow going through your network or do you\nhave few high peaks and then many low points?\n\n\n\nWhat do you mean by network things?  I vision using MS Windows and other\nWindows applications over the network were the processes are running on\nthe server and all I am getting are the displays.  I am wondering how \ngood is the X and subsequently DV/X protocol in transferring these \nimages with X-calls and displaying them on a client's machine.

: > My question is this:  Is there a means of determining what the state\n: > of CapsLock and/or NumLock is?\n\n: Alright.  Ignore this.  I have delved a bit deeper (XKeyEvent) and\n: found what I was looking for.\n\n: ev->state   has a bunch of masks to check against (LockMask is the one\n: for CapsLock).  Unfortunately, it appears that the NumLock mask varies\n: from server to server.  How does one tell what mask is numlock and\n: which are for Meta (Mod1Mask, Mod2Mask, Mod3Mask, Mod4Mask, Mod5Mask).\n: eg, SGI's vendor server has Mod2Mask being NumLock, whereas Solaris\n: 1.0.1 OpenWindows 3.0 has Mod3Mask for NumLock.  Is there an\n: unambiguous means of determining NumLock's mask at runtime for any\n: given server?  Sorry for the wasted bandwidth and my appalling ignorance.\n\nYou'll have to check the keysym(s) on each of the keys for each\nmodifier. The one with NumLock in its mapping is the modifier\nyou want. A bit ugly perhaps but I think its currently the only\nway to do this (and it does have some precedent as keysyms are \nused to differentiate CapsLock from ShiftLock for the Lock\nmodifier).\n\nI don't know of an accepted strategy for handling ambiguous\nassignments either. (ie. what if NumLock is mapped for more then\none modifier). I suppose first found is as good as any.\n\nX doesn't handle locking modifiers that well. \n\nHope that helps,\n\nDave Lapp
Version 1.3 of Xew widgets is available at\n\n	export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/Xew-1.3.tar.Z\n	export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/Xew-1.3.README\n\nFor better details, check the README. (For extensive details, you have\nto with Xew-1.1.ps.Z, still haven't had time to update this one).\n\nNo new functionality has been added since 1.2 version. Raster widget\nhandles now expose events slightly more intelligently than before\n(really had to do this when I added a simple program that uses X11R5\nAthena Porthole and Panner widgets). The program demo/viewer.c is\nvery simple demonstration of panner/porthole usage (copied\nfrom'editres' actually :-)
Excerpts from netnews.comp.windows.x: 19-Apr-93 Monthly Question about\nXCop.. Buzz Moschetti@bear.com (1055) \n\n\nHmmm.... Clearly?  Depends on your programming model.  It is not at all\nforbidden to draw outside the context of an expose event.  Certainly any\ninternal data structures should be maintained such that the visual\nappearance would be maintained properly whenever an expose event happens\nto be generated.  This doesn't preclude drawing immediately after\nupdating the datastructures though...
Hi All!\n\nI tried to run SoftPC, a PC emulation software program, installed on a Silicon \nGraphics workstation from a Human Design System (HDS) X terminal, and \neverything went fine, except the fonts could NOT be converted from one type \nof format to the other - HDS uses different font format from SGI worksation.\nSo, I have the following questions:\n\n1. How do you resolve different font formats from different machines?\n\n2. Is there a program to convert one type of font format to another?\n\nIf you have similar problems/experiences and have found a solution, please \nlet me know.  Your help will be greatly appreciated!\n\nThank you in advance for your help and information.\n\nTom Nguen
Anyone know how an application can retrieve the name of the font from\nan application given an XFontStruct *? \nWould XGetFontProperty work if I passed XA_FONT_NAME? \nanyone know details of this?  Thanks in advance.\nBrian
I just had an idea. I'm not sure if its been done and I'm just\nremembering it unconsiously, but I thought that in dialog\nboxes and whatever in windowing systems, there should be a\nway to intuitivly set some things checked or unchecked or\nfilled in a certain way. My idea: tape. You know, like putting\na piece of tape over a light switch?\nJust an idea, if you like it, use it.
Where do I get hold of these widgets?
I tried to e-mail you but it bounced so...\n\nHi there,\n\n\nIt might be that the X terminal doesn't support the "Postscript\nExtensions to X" product.  I use the 'dxpsview' program on a \nDECstation 5000 to view postscript files but when I moved to an\nNCD X terminal, I couldn't use it any more.  So I ftp'd and\ncompiled GhostScript (GNU software).  Now we can view postscript\nfiles on our X terminals.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nGrant
Interesting, I'd like to know why.\n\nBut try it again on a single ethernet with 100 X terminals on it,\nand I think you'll find it much slower.
>When some types of client windows are displayed, parts of the windows\n >are in the wrong color; if the window is moved slightly, forcing the server\n >to repaint it, it is repainted in the correct colors. It doesn't happen\n\nI have the exact same problem when running Hewlett Packard's Microwave Design\nSystem (MDS) from an HP 380 unix box and running MacX 1.2, Sys 7.0.1*.\nNormally, MDS draws a window with a deep blue backround, but occasionally\nit becomes a light blue and all the text, etc, inside the window become\n"washed out" (nearly invisible). I thought that it was just something\nbrain dead that I was doing or a subtle conflict with another app or INIT.\n\nBy slightly moving the window, and forcing a re-draw, the colors get corrected.
I would be grateful to anyone who knows about an X-windows application\nthat would emulate HP 2623A graphics in a manner similar to\nthe way TEK graphics windows are implemented in xterm.\nThanks for you help.
The subject does not describe the problem I am having very well.  Please read\non...\n\nI am trying to write a function which creates an XtAppContext and a Widget,\ndisplays the widget for a while, then destroys everything and returns.  The\nproblem is that multiple calls to this function cause a variety of problems\nincluding (depending on which calls I make to get rid of things):\n\n- Core Dump\n- BadPixmap X Error\n- Widget not unmapped\n\n\nHere is a simple (C++) program I wrote to show the problem:\n\n#include <X11/Xlib.h>\n#include <Xm/Xm.h>\n#include <Xm/PushB.h>\n\nvoid bla()\n{\n        XtAppContext app;\n        Display *dis = XOpenDisplay("");\n        int junk = 0;\n\n        Widget top=XtAppInitialize (&app, "test", NULL, 0, &junk, NULL,\n                NULL, NULL, 0);\n\n        Widget box = XtVaCreateManagedWidget("blaaa", xmPushButtonWidgetClass,\n                        top,\n                        XmNheight, 50,\n                        XmNwidth, 50,\n                        NULL);\n\n        XtRealizeWidget(top);\n        //Same as XtAppMainLoop but with only 10 XEvents\n        for (int i=0;i<=10;i++)\n        {\n                XEvent event;\n                XtAppNextEvent(app, &event);\n                XtDispatchEvent(&event);\n        }\n\n// WHAT SHOULD I PUT HERE???\n        XtUnrealizeWidget(top);\n        XtDestroyWidget(top);\n        XtDestroyApplicationContext(app);\n        XCloseDisplay(dis);\n// ???\n}\n\nmain()\n{\n        for (int i=0;i<=20;i++)\n                bla();\n}\n\nNote that I rewrote XtAppMainLoop so that at a given time (in this example,\nafter 10 XEvents) the function will exit and return to the main program.\nWith this example, I get the following error on about (this is NOT consistent)\nthe 5th call to bla():\n\nX Error of failed request:  BadPixmap (invalid Pixmap parameter)\n  Major opcode of failed request:  55 (X_CreateGC)\n  Resource id in failed request:  0xe0000d\n  Serial number of failed request:  71\n  Current serial number in output stream:  86\n\nIf I take out the XtUnrealizeWidget(top); line, it just dumps core on the\nseconds call.\n\nFurthermore, every time I call XtAppInitialize() (other than the 1st time), I\nget:\n\nWarning: Initializing Resource Lists twice\nWarning: Initializing Translation manager twice.\n\n\nSo finally, my question is this:\n\nWhat needs to be done in order to be able to call a function which creates\nan XtAppContext and widgets multiple times?\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nPLEASE respond via email as I dont usually have time to read this group.\n\nThanks very much.\n\n-davewood\n-- \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDavid Rex Wood -- davewood@cs.colorado.edu -- University of Colorado at Boulder

I am developing an X (Xt,Xm) application that will include a graphics window\nof some sort with moving symbols among other things.  A pure X application\ncould be implemented with Motif widgets, one of which would be an \nXmDrawingArea for drawing with Xlib.

Also, most of\nthe GL calls do not require a Display or GC, unlike most X calls.  From this\ninitial information it appears that X and GL cannot be mixed easily.

: What has this got to do with comp.windows.x?\n: \n\nI agree that this is a side track, but it is funny that I skip so many\nother articles (threads) but I couldn't resist reading this one.\n\nMy beliefs, opinions, and expressions are strictly my own and do not\nrepresent or reflect any official or unofficial policies or attitudes\nof any other person or organization....\n \nbut.  I have heard that Ford Motor Company has (had) a recruiting bias\ntoward engineers and away from computer science graduates.  The reasoning\nis supposedly to better meet long range personnel requirements.  This is\nevidenced by the large number of CS people who are employed via contracts\nand are not brought on board except in special circumstances.  This is\na generalization which obviously doesn't always hold true, but there are\nstatistics.  Furthermore, most "software engineering" at Ford gets done\nby electrical engineers.  I know of 2 univerities that have merged the\ncomputer science department and the electrical engineering so that you\ncan get a computer degree which qualifies you for much more than programming.

I am currently attempting to get a copy of the HP Widget set compiled\nunder Linux (SLS Release with kernel 99.6) and am running into some\nproblems.  Actually, it seems that this is more of a GCC question,\nbecause I got it to compile without trouble using cc on an RS/6000.\n	Basically, there are a number of functions with prototypes\nset up in, let's say, CompositeP.h, for instance, the composite\nwidget's insert_child procedure is set up with the type :\n\n	typedef void (*XtWidgetProc) (Widget)\n\nbut in several places in the HP source code, they reference the\ninsert_child procedure and pass it multiple arguments instead of just\none, as the prototype suggests.  For example:\n\n	(*superclass->composite_class.insert_child)(w, args, p_num_args)\n\nNow, GCC chokes on this, giving an error message that too many arguments\nare passed to the function.  So, does anyone have any suggestions as to\nhow to turn off this checking in GCC, or how I can go about changing the\ncode to accomodate this call without changing /usr/include/X11/CompositeP.h,\nor has anyone successfully built the HP widget set and have any suggestions.\n	Many thanks in advance for any help.
I'm just guessing here, but I'd guess that X11R5 expects the CG3 to have\n1152x900 resolution, and the version of the CG3 in the SPARCclassic is \n1024x768.\n\n--
I'm working on an X11R5 application and have concerns regarding \nstandard colormaps.\n\nthese colormaps."  I wonder what window manager the writer had \nin mind.  Neither twm or mwm seem to create standard colormaps.\n\nOf course, one can use xstdcmap to create standard colormaps.  \nHowever, xstdcmap doesn't seem to try very hard to avoid \nconflicts with the default colormap.  When I use standard \ncolormaps created by xstdcmap, the rest of my display goes black.  \nSo it seems as if use of standard colormaps causes the very \nproblem standard colormaps are intended to avoid.  Perhaps \nif every application used standard colormaps, things would \nbe wonderful.  But not many applications seem to use \nstandard colormaps.\n\nFinally, the operation of the functions XmuGetColormapAllocation, \nXmuStandardColormap, and XmuCreateColormap seem inconsistent \nwith the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation.\n\n    According to the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation (p. 436):\n\n    For GrayScale colormaps, only the colormap, red_max, red_mult, and \n    base_pixel members are defined.  The other members are ignored.  \n    To compute a GrayScale pixel value, use the following expression:\n\n            (gray * red_mult + base_pixel) &0xFFFFFFFF\n\n    XmuGetColormapAllocation, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/CmapAlloc.c, is \n    used by XmuLookupStandardColormap, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/LookupCmap.c\n    to select red_max, green_max, and blue_max values for the \n    call to XmuStandardColormap.  When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is \n    specified, XmuGetColormapAllocation sets red_max to 30% of the \n    total number of cells in the gray scale, sets green_max to 59% \n    of the total number, and sets blue_max ot 11% of the total number.\n    Referring to section 14.3, one would expect XmuGetColormapAllocation \n    to set red_max to the total number of cells in the gray scale.\n\n    When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is specified, XmuStandardColormap, \n    defined in mit/lib/Xmu/StdCmap.c, sets red_mult, green_mult, \n    and blue_mult all equal to 1.  Referring to section 14.3, \n    one would expect green_mult and blue_mult to be ignored.
I don't know a great deal about the support for C++ in UIM/X, but I can tell \nyou that there is good support for it in TeleUSE.  In TeleUSE you can call any\nC++ method from a "D" module.  What you can do then is to use the "D" language\nfor most of your interface code and then use C++ for you application code.\n\nI should tell you that there is some real neat stuff coming out of TeleUSE soon\nin regard to C++, but I can't give you many details.  You should talk to your local sales rep and get the lowdown on what they will be doing in the near furture.\n\nIf you want example code of how C++ integrates with TeleUSE you should look at\n$TeleUSE/examples/Thermometer
Are we talking about an xterm which would accept the same escape sequences\nas that for VT340 (or colour decterm/dxterm)? I thought that was called\ncolxterm (and my testing of it shows some oddities that might be bugs or\nmight be my program going wrong).
Well, yes and no.  I don't particularly want this discussion to spark\na lengthy debate, but I do think it's worth pointing out that "popular\nusage" is not always sufficient excuse.  \n\nIn this case, for example, I think an appropriate parallel may be found\nin the pronunciation of proper names: if people commonly misspelled or \nmispronounced your name, would you feel compelled to change it?  Probably\nnot.  \n\nThe same is true of X.  "The X Window System", "X", "X11", and related\nmonickers are proper names in the same sense that any product name is a\nproper name.  In fact, some of them are *trademarked* names.  The fact \nthat many people get them wrong is largely beside the point.  \n\nAs for the trade publications that promulgate things like "X Window" or\n"X.windows" or any of the other nonsensical variants one often sees, \nconsider the fact that these publications are supposedly written by \n*journalists*.  Would you trust the facts of a journalist who couldn't\nbe bothered to get the name of his/her source right?  Would you trust\na product review by someone who got the name of the product wrong?\n\nPopular usage is as it may be, but I for one am all for holding people\nwho claim to be journalists to a higher standard of correctness.
I am trying to find out if my application is running on a local or a\nremote display.  A local display being connected to the same system\nthat the client is executing on.  I have access to the display string\nbut can I tell from the string?\n\nIf the client is executing on host foo then ":0", "unix:0", "foo:0",\nand "localhost:0" are all local.  Under Ultrix, I believe that\n"local:0" is also a valid display name (a shared memory connection\nmaybe?).  Are there other strings that I should check for?  Is there a\nbetter way to detect this?\n\nThank you for any help you can give me.

The oclock widget was written using the SHAPE extension.\nYou can do the same in your widgets.  Few current widgets\nsupport SHAPE, so you'll have to subclass them to add that\nfunctionality.
Sorry, but olwm and tvtwm don't do it. They place the title at that position\nand the window at a position below it.\n\nThis becomes a problem when you want a program to be able to save its current\nconfiguration and restore is later.\n\nCurrently, my solution is:\n\n	XCreateWindow(...);\n	XSetWMProperties(..);\n	XMapWindow(...);\n	XFlush(...);\n	XMoveWindow(...);\n\n\nIt works with olwm, but is less than elegant. All this leaves me wondering\nif I'm overlooking something obvious.
It is actually worse than you think.  I have the same problem, and have\ngiven up.  Emacs has an internal table (somewhere!) which defines what\nkeys it will accept, and this table is system-dependent.  I use a Sun\nfrom my HP, and cannot get 'shift PageUp' to work - xmodmap is not\nsufficient, or at least I haven't worked out how to make it work.\nHowever, I CAN get ordinary 'PageUp' and 'shift CursorRight' to work,\nand I do some customised things with them.\n\nNote that the Emacs on my HP has no problem, and I am using exactly\nthe same xmodmap and Emacs configuration.
Another way would be to use GetGeometry to find out where\nyou are relative to the frame, and TranslateCoordinates to find\nout where your window's upperleft corner really is.\n	-- Ethan
...let me point out that both GUI-based word-processors and text-based\n   formatters both have a language; one happens to be mouse- and\n   action-based, and the other symbol-based.\n\nTrue, but that's beside the point. This is a fact about an abstract model\nof what the GUI users are doing, not about what they actually *are* doing.\nThis abstract model is only apparent from the perpective of a *programmer*\nof the system. (NB: some users may see it, too, but only when they put\naside the work at hand and start thinking like a programmer.)\n\nI'm not saying that the programmer's perspective is evil or stunted. After\nall, that's what I do, too! I am saying that UI designers must carefully\ndistinguish between the user/programmer conceptual models, and they must\nultimately serve the user of the system, not the builder of the system. \n\n\n   I don't recall the actual stats, but something like 1 in 5 people can be\n   categorized as a "symbol manipulator".\n\nIt would be interesting to know more about the meaning and basis for this\nclaim. At any rate, I don't think this is evidence that 20% of users think\nlike programmers. Bankers, financial analysts, structural engineers ---\nthese are all people whose work you could characterize as primarily symbol\nmanipulation. But what they do is not programming, and programming is not\nrequired to do what they do.
I have a problem with icon pixmap. My application has to run\n   under openwindow and motif. I wrote my program in Motif with pixmap and\n   icons. It runs fine under motif/motif window manager and X11R5/mwm. But \n   the icon pixmap does not show up under openwin/olwm and X11R5/olwm.\n\n             Has anybody got into this kind of problem? Need a clue. An \n   example which works in both X11R5/motif and openwindow will be great.
We have a Sun 3/80 and we have just acquired a cg8 frame buffer card.\n\nThe cg8 is supposed to support both a 24-bit color visual and a monochrome visual.\nThe default visual for the xnews server is the monochrome, and we are unable to change it to\nthe 24-bit visual. We have tried using XGetVisualInfo to get a visual of depth 24, but had no\nsuccess.  xdpyinfo gives no information about a 24-bit deep visual, only monochrome. \n\nThere are two possible solutions:\n	If someone has patches for X11R5 Xsun server, could they forward them to us?\n\n	Otherwise, could someone instruct us how to access the 24-bit color in openwindows?
There's documentation on how to use the shared memory extension in the\nX11R5 distribution.\n\n  Actually, I just finished writing a motif animation program...\n(take-lots-of-image-data-and-display-it-pretty-darn-fast). When using\non-server pixmaps or shared memory, I had to insert a delay loop to keep\nit from going too quickly :). Testing both methods side by side, they\nwere just about equal.\n\n  The advantage of SHM is that your X server doesn't grow to ridiculous\nsizes; but pixmaps can work over a network and *are* removed if your\napplication dies (one tends to use ipcrm manually quite a bit when\ndebugging SHM apps).\n\n  Shared memory also has the problem that some operating systems (e.g.\nUltrix) seem to allow only a small number of segments (~6) to be\nattached to a process at once; consequently, a redraw becomes\nXShmAttach();XShmPutImage();XShmDetach(); on Dec systems. And Dec's 24\nbit displays (like the ones I tend to use most often) don't seem to\nsupport the extension (maybe someone compiled them wrong?), and using\npixmaps causes the X server to crash (failed mallocs), so one *has* to\nuse the local unix domain socket (which really isn't that bad; one\ncopies the info three times per redraw instead of one).\n\n  In short: allowing all three forms of display, within the program is a\nGood Thing (minus SHM if running over a network), and let the user pick\nwhatever feels fastest.\n\n  (I just use an ximagehandler class and forget about it :)
Usually when I start up an application, I first get the window outline\non my display. I then have to click on the mouse button to actually\nplace the window on the screen. Yet when I specify the -geometry \noption the window appears right away, the properties specified by\nthe -geometry argument. The question now is:\n\nHow can I override the intermediary step of the user having to specify\nwindow position with a mouseclick? I've tried explicitly setting window\nsize and position, but that did alter the normal program behaviour.\n\nThanks for any hints\n---> Robert\n\nPS: I'm working in plain X.

Has anybody generated an X server for Windows NT?  If so, are you willing\nto share your config file and other tricks necessary to make it work?\n\nThanks for any information.
The xgolf program was an April Fool's joke <sigh>.
If you need speed, and your client can run on the same host as the X server,\n  you should use the shared memory extension to the sample X server (MIT-SHM).\n  xdpyinfo  will tell you if your server has this extension. This is certainly\n  available with the sample MIT X server running under SunOS.\n  A word of warning: make sure your kernel is configured to support shared\n  memory. And another word of warning: OpenWindows is slower than the MIT\n  server.\n  I have written an imaging tool (using XView for the GUI, by the way) which\n  yields over 10 frames per second for 512*512*8 bit images, running on a Sparc\n  IPC (half the cpu grunt of an IPX). This has proved quite sufficient for\n  animations.\n\n				Regards,

Thanks for docs info.

I'm writing an X server for some video-generation equipment.  The\nhardware is "truecolor" in YUV space; in X terms it has a 24-bit\nstatic color visual.  I would really like to have the server just\npresent this static visual, but I'm not sure if this will be \nacceptable to "most" X clients.  The three problems I see are:\n\n  1) The colormap, though huge, is static.\n  2) All pixels would be 3 bytes wide.\n  3) Because the hardware actually lives in YUV space, the\n     translation RGB->YUV will introduce some rounding error.\n\nBeing more of a server guy than a client guy, I ask: will these\nlimitations thwart many X clients?  Or will most of the X stuff\nfloating around blithely accept what they're given?  I could write\nthe server to also present a pseudocolor visual of, e.g., 8 bits, \nbut I'd rather avoid this if not necessary.\n\nI know there are no absolutes, but I'd appreciate hearing people's\nopinions and suggestions.  Thanks!

Can anyone help me?\n\nI am having a problem displaying images greater than 32768 bytes from a\nDecwindows program running on a Vax 6310, and displaying on a Sparc IPC\nrunning Openwindows 3.0 and dni.

I would suggest skipping olwm and getting olvwm instead. This version of the\nolwm window manager implements a virtual desktop that I find really handy even\non large monitors. \n\nThis version is also available at export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/olvwm3.tar.Z.\nThe README file also suggest getting the files in /contrib/xview3.\n\nIn my case, I built the X Server first, Xview second, then olvwm. All of these\nwere installed into /usr/X5. Once I verified the server worked correctly,\nI happily issued "rm -rf /usr/openwin/*".\n\nUsing gcc 2.3.3 to build all of the above resulted in a windowing system that \nis, for all intents and purposes, identical to OpenWindows 3.0 and that is     \nincredibly faster. There is a bit of tweaking you will have to do if you want\nthings to work _exactly_ like OpenWindows, but not much.

We tried to ship an X server once that only supported a 24bit\nTrueColor visual. The main problems we encountered were:\n\n	1) Clients written with logic like the following:\n\n	    if (DefaultDepth() != 1)\n		/* Assume default depth is 8bit */\n\n	   These clients need an 8bit deep visual in the root window\n	   to run correctly.\n\n	2) Other clients didn't even bother to do that much, and just\n	   outright assumed they had a *dynamic* visual class, with a\n	   dynamic colormap. XStoreColors doesn't work on cmaps\n	   associated with Static or TrueColor visual classes, but\n	   many clients don't bother to check, they just start\n	   throwing XStoreColor calls at you.\n\nThough both are clearly client error, this is the case with so many\nclients that it's easier for you to expose 8bit PseudoColor as a\ndefault root window visual, than it ever would be for all these client\nwriters to change their clients to do the right thing.\n--
There is a free program called 'xkernel' which does just that.\nIt is by Seth Robertson (seth@ctr.columbia.edu).  It takes a sun 3 and\nboots a limited kernel which allows you to run X.  We converted 4\nmachines over this semester and the speedup is enormously appreciable\n-- I find them faster than an NCD 15inch black&white XTerminal that we\nare playing with, and a bigger screen to boot!  As a matter of fact,\nthe department just bought some old sun3s at an auction to convert!\n\n} Xkernel is available for anonymous ftp from ftp.ctr.columbia.edu\n} [128.59.64.40] in /Xkernel/Xkernel.shar (/Xkernel is a symlink to the\n} latest version of Xkernel)\n\n	Note that the compiled version which is available is for the\nsun 3/50, but compiling to work for a sun 3/1xx should be quite easy.\n\n	I am not connected with xkernel except as a satisfied\ninstaller and user 8).

Because the callback list can be manipulated by both the widget and\nthe application, Xt cannot guarantee the order of execution.\n	In general, the callback procedures should be thought of as operating \nindependently of one another and should not depend on side-effects of other\ncallbacks operating; if a seqence is needed, then the single callback to be \nregistered can explicitly call other functions necessary.\n\n[4/92; thanks to converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 122)  Why doesn't XtDestroyWidget() actually destroy the widget?\n\n	XtDestroyWidget() operates in two passes, in order to avoid leaving\ndangling data structures; the function-call marks the widget, which is not \nactually destroyed until your program returns to its event-loop. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 123)  How do I query the user synchronously using Xt?\n	\n	It is possible to have code which looks like this trivial callback,\nwhich has a clear flow of control. The calls to AskUser() block until answer\nis set to one of the valid values. If it is not a "yes" answer, the code drops\nout of the callback and back to an event-processing loop: \n\n	void quit(Widget w, XtPointer client, XtPointer call)\n	{\n		int             answer;\n		answer = AskUser(w, "Really Quit?");\n		if (RET_YES == answer)\n			{\n			answer = AskUser(w, "Are You Really Positive?");\n			if (RET_YES == answer)\n				exit(0);\n                }\n	}\n\n	A more realistic example might ask whether to create a file or whether \nto overwrite it.\n	This is accomplished by entering a second event-processing loop and\nwaiting until the user answers the question; the answer is returned to the\ncalling function. That function AskUser() looks something like this, where the \nMotif can be replaced with widget-set-specific code to create some sort of \ndialog-box displaying the question string and buttons for "OK", "Cancel" and \n"Help" or equivalents:\n\n  int AskUser(w, string)\n        Widget          w;\n        char           *string;\n  {\n        int             answer=RET_NONE;	/* some not-used marker */\n        Widget          dialog;			/* could cache&carry, but ...*/\n        Arg             args[3];\n        int             n = 0;\n        XtAppContext    context;\n\n        n=0;\n        XtSetArg(args[n], XmNmessageString, XmStringCreateLtoR(string,\n                XmSTRING_DEFAULT_CHARSET)); n++;\n        XtSetArg(args[n], XmNdialogStyle, XmDIALOG_APPLICATION_MODAL); n++;\n        dialog = XmCreateQuestionDialog(XtParent(w), string, args, n);\n        XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNokCallback, response, &answer);\n        XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNcancelCallback, response, &answer);\n        XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNhelpCallback, response, &answer);\n        XtManageChild(dialog);\n\n        context = XtWidgetToApplicationContext (w);\n        while (answer == RET_NONE || XtAppPending(context)) {\n                XtAppProcessEvent (context, XtIMAll);\n        }\n        XtDestroyWidget(dialog);  /* blow away the dialog box and shell */\n        return answer;\n  }\n\n	The dialog supports three buttons, which are set to call the same \nfunction when tickled by the user.  The variable answer is set when the user \nfinally selects one of those choices:\n\n  void response(w, client, call)\n        Widget          w;\n        XtPointer client;\n        XtPointer call;\n  {\n  int *answer = (int *) client;\n  XmAnyCallbackStruct *reason = (XmAnyCallbackStruct *) call;\n        switch (reason->reason) {\n        case XmCR_OK:\n                *answer = RET_YES;	/* some #define value */\n                break;\n        case XmCR_CANCEL:\n                *answer = RET_NO; \n		break;\n        case XmCR_HELP:\n                *answer = RET_HELP;\n                break;\n        default:\n                return;\n        }\n}\n\nand the code unwraps back to the point at which an answer was needed and\ncontinues from there.\n\n[Thanks to Dan Heller (argv@sun.com); further code is in Dan's R3/contrib\nWidgetWrap library. 2/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 124)  How do I determine the name of an existing widget?\nI have a widget ID and need to know what the name of that widget is.\n\n	Users of R4 and later are best off using the XtName() function, which \nwill work on both widgets and non-widget objects.\n\n	If you are still using R3, you can use this simple bit of code to do \nwhat you want.

Using a window id of NULL ("no window") could \ncreate the error that you describe.  It is necessary to call XtRealizeWidget() \nbefore attempting to use the window associated with a widget. \n	Note that the window will be created after the XtRealizeWidget() call, \nbut that the server may not have actually mapped it yet, so you should also \nwait for an Expose event on the window before drawing into it.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 126)  Why do I get a BadMatch error when calling XGetImage?\n\nThe BadMatch error can occur if the specified rectangle goes off the edge of \nthe screen. If you don't want to catch the error and deal with it, you can take\nthe following steps to avoid the error:\n\n1) Make a pixmap the same size as the rectangle you want to capture.\n2) Clear the pixmap to background using XFillRectangle.\n3) Use XCopyArea to copy the window to the pixmap.\n4) If you get a NoExpose event, the copy was clean. Use XGetImage to grab the\nimage from the pixmap.\n5) If you get one or more GraphicsExpose events, the copy wasn't clean, and \nthe x/y/width/height members of the GraphicsExpose event structures tell you \nthe parts of the pixmap which aren't good.\n6) Get rid of the pixmap; it probably takes a lot of memory.\n\n[10/92; thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com)]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 127)  How can my application tell if it is being run under X?\n\n	A number of programs offer X modes but otherwise run in a straight\ncharacter-only mode. The easiest way for an application to determine that it is\nrunning on an X display is to attempt to open a connection to the X server:\n	\n	display = XOpenDisplay(display_name);\n	if (display)\n		{ do X stuff }\n	else\n		{ do curses or something else }\nwhere display_name is either the string specified on the command-line following\n-display, by convention, or otherwise is (char*)NULL [in which case \nXOpenDisplay uses the value of $DISPLAY, if set].\n\nThis is superior to simply checking for the existence a -display command-line \nargument or checking for $DISPLAY set in the environment, neither of which is \nadequate. [5/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 128)  How do I make a "busy cursor" while my application is computing?\nIs it necessary to call XDefineCursor() for every window in my application?\n\n	The easiest thing to do is to create a single InputOnly window that is \nas large as the largest possible screen; make it a child of your toplevel \nwindow and it will be clipped to that window, so it won't affect any other \napplication. (It needs to be as big as the largest possible screen in case the \nuser enlarges the window while it is busy or moves elsewhere within a virtual \ndesktop.) Substitute "toplevel" with your top-most widget here (similar code \nshould work for Xlib-only applications; just use your top Window):\n\n     unsigned long valuemask;\n     XSetWindowAttributes attributes;\n\n     /* Ignore device events while the busy cursor is displayed. */\n     valuemask = CWDontPropagate | CWCursor;\n     attributes.do_not_propagate_mask =  (KeyPressMask | KeyReleaseMask |\n         ButtonPressMask | ButtonReleaseMask | PointerMotionMask);\n     attributes.cursor = XCreateFontCursor(XtDisplay(toplevel), XC_watch);\n\n     /* The window will be as big as the display screen, and clipped by\n        its own parent window, so we never have to worry about resizing */\n     XCreateWindow(XtDisplay(toplevel), XtWindow(toplevel), 0, 0,\n         65535, 65535, (unsigned int) 0, 0, InputOnly,\n         CopyFromParent, valuemask, &attributes);\n\nwhere the maximum size above could be replaced by the real size of the screen,\nparticularly to avoid servers which have problems with windows larger than\n32767.\n\nWhen you want to use this busy cursor, map and raise this window; to go back to\nnormal, unmap it. This will automatically keep you from getting extra mouse\nevents; depending on precisely how the window manager works, it may or may not\nhave a similar effect on keystrokes as well.\n\nIn addition, note also that most of the Xaw widgets support an XtNcursor \nresource which can be temporarily reset, should you merely wish to change the\ncursor without blocking pointer events.\n\n[thanks to Andrew Wason (aw@cellar.bae.bellcore.com), Dan Heller \n(argv@sun.com), and mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu; 11/90,5/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 129)  How do I fork without hanging my parent X program?\n\n	An X-based application which spawns off other Unix processes which \ncontinue to run after it is closed typically does not vanish until all of its \nchildren are terminated; the children inherit from the parent the open X \nconnection to the display. \n	What you need to do is fork; then, immediately, in the child process, \n		close (ConnectionNumber(XtDisplay(widget)));\nto close the file-descriptor in the display information. After this do your \nexec. You will then be able to exit the parent.\n	Alternatively, before exec'ing make this call, which causes the file \ndescriptor to be closed on exec.\n		(void) fcntl(ConnectionNumber(XDisplay), F_SETFD, 1);\n\n[Thanks to Janet Anstett (anstettj@tramp.Colorado.EDU), Gordon Freedman \n(gjf00@duts.ccc.amdahl.com); 2/91. Greg Holmberg (holmberg@frame.com), 3/93.]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 130)  Can I make Xt or Xlib calls from a signal handler?\n\n	No. Xlib and Xt have no mutual exclusion for protecting critical \nsections. If your signal handler makes such a call at the wrong time (which \nmight be while the function you are calling is already executing), it can leave\nthe library in an inconsistent state. Note that the ANSI C standard points\nout that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls\nany function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem specific to\nXlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be\ncalled safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by \nXlib or Xt functions.\n	You can work around the problem by setting a flag in the interrupt\nhandler and later checking it with a work procedure or a timer event which\nhas previously been added.\n\n	Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly \nVolume 6 are in error.\n\n[Thanks to Pete Ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) and Donna Converse \n(converse@expo.lcs.mit.EDU), 5/92]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 131)  What are these "Xlib sequence lost" errors?\n\n	You may see these errors if you issue Xlib requests from an Xlib error \nhandler, or, more likely, if you make calls which generate X requests to Xt or \nXlib from a signal handler, which you shouldn't be doing in any case. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 132)  How can my Xt program handle socket, pipe, or file input?\n\n	It's very common to need to write an Xt program that can accept input \nboth from a user via the X connection and from some other file descriptor, but \nwhich operates efficiently and without blocking on either the X connection or \nthe other file descriptor.\n	A solution is use XtAppAddInput(). After you open your file descriptor,\nuse XtAppAddInput() to register an input handler. The input handler will be \ncalled every time there is something on the file descriptor requiring your \nprogram's attention. Write the input handler like you would any other Xt \ncallback, so it does its work quickly and returns.  It is important to use only\nnon-blocking I/O system calls in your input handlers.\n	Most input handlers read the file descriptor, although you can have an \ninput handler write or handle exception conditions if you wish.\n	Be careful when you register an input handler to read from a disk file.\nYou will find that the function is called even when there isn't input pending.\nXtAppAddInput() is actually working as it is supposed to. The input handler is \ncalled whenever the file descriptor is READY to be read, not only when there is\nnew data to be read. A disk file (unlike a pipe or socket) is almost always \nready to be read, however, if only because you can spin back to the beginning\nand read data you've read before.  The result is that your function will almost\nalways be called every time around XtAppMainLoop(). There is a way to get the \ntype of interaction you are expecting; add this line to the beginning of your \nfunction to test whether there is new data:\n	     if (ioctl(fd, FIONREAD, &n) == -1 || n == 0) return;\nBut, because this is called frequently, your application is effectively in a \nbusy-wait; you may be better off not using XtAppAddInput() and instead setting \na timer and in the timer procedure checking the file for input.\n\n[courtesy Dan Heller (argv@ora.com), 8/90; mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu 5/91;\nOllie Jones (oj@pictel.com) 6/92]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 133)  How do I simulate a button press/release event for a widget?\n\n	You can do this using XSendEvent(); it's likely that you're not setting\nthe window field in the event, which Xt needs in order to match to the widget\nwhich should receive the event.\n	 If you're sending events to your own application, then you can use \nXtDispatchEvent() instead. This is more efficient than XSendEvent() in that you\navoid a round-trip to the server.\n	Depending on how well the widget was written, you may be able to call\nits action procedures in order to get the effects you want.\n\n[courtesy Mark A. Horstman (mh2620@sarek.sbc.com), 11/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 134)  Why doesn't anything appear when I run this simple program?\n\n\n	You are right to map the window before drawing into it. However, the \nwindow is not ready to be drawn into until it actually appears on the screen --\nuntil your application receives an Expose event. Drawing done before that will \ngenerally not appear. You'll see code like this in many programs; this code \nwould appear after window was created and mapped:\n  while (!done)\n    {\n      XNextEvent(the_display,&the_event);\n      switch (the_event.type) {\n	case Expose:	 /* On expose events, redraw */\n		XDrawLine(the_display,the_window,the_GC,5,5,100,100);\n		break;\n	...\n	}\n    }\n\n	Note that there is a second problem: some Xlib implementations don't \nset up the default graphics context to have correct foreground/background \ncolors, so this program could previously include this code:\n  ...\n  the_GC_values.foreground=BlackPixel(the_display,the_screen);	/* e.g. */\n  the_GC_values.background=WhitePixel(the_display,the_screen);	/* e.g. */\n  the_GC = XCreateGC(the_display,the_window,\n                GCForeground|GCBackground,&the_GC_values);\n  ...\n \nNote: the code uses BlackPixel and WhitePixel to avoid assuming that 1 is \nblack and 0 is white or vice-versa.  The relationship between pixels 0 and 1 \nand the colors black and white is implementation-dependent.  They may be \nreversed, or they may not even correspond to black and white at all.\n\nAlso note that actually using BlackPixel and WhitePixel is usually the wrong \nthing to do in a finished program, as it ignores the user's preference for \nforeground and background.\n\nAnd also note that you can run into the same situation in an Xt-based program\nif you draw into the XtWindow(w) right after it has been realized; it may\nnot yet have appeared.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 135)  What is the difference between a Screen and a screen?\n\n	The 'Screen' is an Xlib structure which includes the information about\none of the monitors or virtual monitors which a single X display supports. A \nserver can support several independent screens. They are numbered unix:0.0,\nunix:0.1, unix:0.2, etc; the 'screen' or 'screen_number' is the second digit --\nthe 0, 1, 2 which can be thought of as an index into the array of available \nScreens on this particular Display connection.\n	The macros which you can use to obtain information about the particular\nScreen on which your application is running typically have two forms -- one\nwhich takes a Screen and one with takes both the Display and the screen_number.\n	In Xt-based programs, you typically use XtScreen(widget) to determine \nthe Screen on which your application is running, if it uses a single screen.\n	(Part of the confusion may arise from the fact that some of the macros\nwhich return characteristics of the Screen have "Display" in the names -- \nXDisplayWidth, XDisplayHeight, etc.)\n	\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 136)  Can I use C++ with X11?

The reason for this is that a client can create a pixmap,\nset it to be the background pixmap of a window, and then free the pixmap. The \nwindow keeps this background, but the pixmap itself is destroyed.  If you're \nsure a window has a background pixel (not a pixmap), you can use XClearArea() \nto clear a region to the background color and then use XGetImage() to read \nback that pixel.  However, this action alters the contents of the window, and \nit suffers from race conditions with exposures. [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD \nand Stuart Marks of Sun]\n\n	Note that the same applies to the border pixel/pixmap. This is a \n(mis)feature of the protocol which allows the server is free to manipulate the\npixel/pixmap however it wants.  By not requiring the server to keep the \noriginal pixel or pixmap, some (potentially a lot of) space can be saved. \n[courtesy Jim Fulton, MIT X Consortium]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 139)  How do I create a transparent window?\n	\n	A completely transparent window is easy to get -- use an InputOnly\nwindow. In order to create a window which is *mostly* transparent, you have\nseveral choices:\n	- the SHAPE extension first released with X11R4 offers an easy way to\nmake non-rectangular windows, so you can set the shape of the window to fit the\nareas where the window should be nontransparent; however, not all servers \nsupport the extension.\n	- a machine-specific method of implementing transparent windows for\nparticular servers is to use an overlay plane supported by the hardware.  Note \nthat there is no X notion of a "transparent color index".\n	- a generally portable solution is to use a large number of tiny \nwindows, but this makes operating on the application as a unit difficult.\n	- a final answer is to consider whether you really need a transparent\nwindow or if you would be satisfied with being able to overlay your application\nwindow with information; if so, you can draw into separate bitplanes in colors\nthat will appear properly.\n\n[thanks to der Mouse, mouse@lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU, 3/92; see also\nThe X Journal 1:4 for a more complete answer, including code samples for this\nlast option]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 140)  Why doesn't GXxor produce mathematically-correct color values?\n\n	When using GXxor you may expect that drawing with a value of black on a\nbackground of black, for example, should produce white. However, the drawing\noperation does not work on RGB values but on colormap indices. The color that\nthe resulting colormap index actually points to is undefined and visually\nrandom unless you have actually filled it in yourself. [On many X servers Black\nand White often 0/1 or 1/0; programs taking advantage of this mathematical\ncoincidence will break.]\n	If you want to be combining colors with GXxor, then you should be \nallocating a number of your own color cells and filling them with your chosen\npre-computed values.\n	If you want to use GXxor simply to switch between two colors, then you \ncan take the shortcut of setting the background color in the GC (graphics \ncontext) to 0 and the foreground color to a value such that when it draws over \nred, say, the result is blue, and when it draws over blue the result is red. \nThis foreground value is itself the XOR of the colormap indices of red and \nblue.\n\n[Thanks to Chris Flatters (cflatter@zia.aoc.nrao.EDU) and Ken Whaley \n(whaley@spectre.pa.dec.com), 2/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 141)  Why does every color I allocate show up as black?\n\n	Make sure you're using 16 bits and not 8.  The red, green, and blue \nfields of an XColor structure are scaled so that 0 is nothing and 65535 is \nfull-blast. If you forget to scale (using, for example, 0-255 for each color) \nthe XAllocColor function will perform correctly but the resulting color is \nusually black. \n\n[Thanks to Paul Asente, asente@adobe.com, 7/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 142)  Why can't my program get a standard colormap?\nI have an image-processing program which uses XGetRGBColormap() to get the \nstandard colormap, but it doesn't work. \n\n	XGetRGBColormap() when used with the property XA_RGB_DEFAULT_MAP does \nnot create a standard colormap -- it just returns one if one already exists.\nUse xstdcmap or do what it does in order to create the standard colormap first.\n\n[1/91; from der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu)]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 143)  Why does the pixmap I copy to the screen show up as garbage? \n\n	The initial contents of pixmaps are undefined.  This means that most\nservers will allocate the memory and leave around whatever happens to be there \n-- which is usually garbage.  You probably want to clear the pixmap first using\nXFillRectangle() with a function of GXcopy and a foreground pixel of whatever \ncolor you want as your background (or 0L if you are using the pixmap as a \nmask). [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 144)  How do I check whether a window ID is valid?\nMy program has the ID of a window on a remote display. I want to check whether\nthe window exists before doing anything with it.\n\n	Because X is asynchronous, there isn't a guarantee that the window \nwould still exist between the time that you got the ID and the time you sent an\nevent to the window or otherwise manipulated it. What you should do is send the\nevent without checking, but install an error handler to catch any BadWindow \nerrors, which would indicate that the window no longer exists. This scheme will\nwork except on the [rare] occasion that the original window has been destroyed \nand its ID reallocated to another window.\n\n[courtesy Ken Lee (klee@synoptics.com), 4/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 145)  Can I have two applications draw to the same window?\n\n	Yes. The X server assigns IDs to windows and other resources (actually,\nthe server assigns some bits, the client others), and any application that \nknows the ID can manipulate the resource [almost any X server resource, except\nfor GCs and private color cells, can be shared].\n	The problem you face is how to disseminate the window ID to multiple \napplications. A simple way to handle this (and which solves the problem of the\napplications' running on different machines) is in the first application to \ncreate a specially-named property on the root-window and put the window ID into\nit. The second application then retrieves the property, whose name it also\nknows, and then can draw whatever it wants into the window.\n	[Note: this scheme works iff there is only one instance of the first\napplication running, and the scheme is subject to the limitations mentioned\nin the Question about using window IDs on remote displays.]\n	Note also that you will still need to coordinate any higher-level \ncooperation among your applications. \n	Note also that two processes can share a window but should not try to \nuse the same server connection. If one process is a child of the other, it \nshould close down the connection to the server and open its own connection.\n\n[mostly courtesy Phil Karlton (karlton@wpd.sgi.com) 6/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 146)  Why can't my program work with tvtwm or swm?\n\n	A number of applications, including xwd, xwininfo, and xsetroot, do not\nhandle the virtual root window which tvtwm and swm use; they typically return \nthe wrong child of root. A general solution is to add this code or to use it in\nyour own application where you would normally use RootWindow(dpy,screen):\n\n/* Function Name: GetVRoot\n * Description: Gets the root window, even if it's a virtual root\n * Arguments: the display and the screen\n * Returns: the root window for the client\n */\n#include <X11/Xatom.h>\nWindow GetVRoot(dpy, scr)\nDisplay        *dpy;\nint             scr;\n{\nWindow          rootReturn, parentReturn, *children;\nunsigned int    numChildren;\nWindow          root = RootWindow(dpy, scr);\nAtom            __SWM_VROOT = None;\nint             i;\n\n  __SWM_VROOT = XInternAtom(dpy, "__SWM_VROOT", False);\n  XQueryTree(dpy, root, &rootReturn, &parentReturn, &children, &numChildren);\n  for (i = 0; i < numChildren; i++) {\n	Atom            actual_type;\n	int             actual_format;\n	long            nitems, bytesafter;\n	Window         *newRoot = NULL;\n\n	if (XGetWindowProperty(dpy, children[i], __SWM_VROOT, 0, 1,\n	    False, XA_WINDOW, &actual_type, &actual_format, &nitems,\n            &bytesafter, (unsigned char **) &newRoot) == Success && newRoot) {\n			root = *newRoot;\n			break;\n		}\n	}\n\n	return root;\n}\n\n[courtesy David Elliott (dce@smsc.sony.com).

You can try setting \nthe minimum and maximum size hints to your target size and hope for the best. \n[1/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 148)  How do I keep a window in the foreground at all times?\n\n	It's rather antisocial for an application to constantly raise itself\n[e.g. by tracking VisibilityNotify events] so that it isn't overlapped -- \nimagine the conflict between two such programs running.  \n	The only sure way to have your window appear on the top of the stack\nis to make the window override-redirect; this means that you are temporarily\nassuming window-management duties while the window is up, so you want to do \nthis infrequently and then only for short periods of time (e.g. for popup \nmenus or other short parameter-setting windows).\n\n[thanks to der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu); 7/92]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 149)  How do I make text and bitmaps blink in X?\n\n	There is no easy way.  Unless you're willing to depend on some sort of\nextension (as yet non-existent), you have to arrange for the blinking yourself,\neither by redrawing the contents periodically or, if possible, by playing games\nwith the colormap and changing the color of the contents.\n\n[Thanks to mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (der Mouse), 7/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 150)+ How do I get a double-click in Xlib?\n\n	Users of Xt have the support of the translation manager to help \nget notification of double-clicking.\n	There is no good way to get only a double-click in Xlib, because the \nprotocol does not provide enough support to do double-clicks.  You have to do \nclient-side timeouts, unless the single-click action is such that you can defer\nactually taking it until you next see an event from the server.  Thus, you \nhave to do timeouts, which means system-dependent code.  On most UNIXish \nimplementations, you can use XConnectionNumber to get the file descriptor of \nthe X connection and then use select() or something similar on that.\n	Note that many user-interface references suggest that a double-click\nbe used to extend the action indicated by a single-click; if this is the case\nin your interface then you can execute the first action and as a compromise\ncheck the timestamp on the second event to determine whether it, too, should\nbe the single-click action or the double-click action.\n\n[Thanks to mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (der Mouse), 4/93]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 151)! How do I render rotated text?\n	\n	Xlib intentionally does not provide such sophisticated graphics \ncapabilities, leaving them up to server-extensions or clients-side graphics\nlibraries.\n	Your only choice, if you want to stay within the core X protocol, is to\nrender the text into a pixmap, read it back via XGetImage(), rotate it "by \nhand" with whatever matrices you want, and put it back to the server via \nXPutImage(); more specifically:\n	1) create a bitmap B and write your text to it.\n	2) create an XYBitmap image I from B (via XGetImage).\n	3) create an XYBitmap Image I2 big enough to handle the transformation.\n	4) for each x,y in I2, I2(x,y) = I(a,b) where \n		a = x * cos(theta) - y * sin(theta)\n		b = x * sin(theta) + y * cos(theta)\n	5) render I2\n	Note that you should be careful how you implement this not to lose\nbits; an algorithm based on shear transformations may in fact be better.\n	The high-level server-extensions and graphics packages available for X \nalso permit rendering of rotated text: Display PostScript, PEX, PHiGS, and GKS,\nalthough most are not capable of arbitrary rotation and probably do not use the\nsame fonts that would be found on a printer.\n	In addition, if you have enough access to the server to install a font\non it, you can create a font which consists of letters rotated at some\npredefined angle. Your application can then itself figure out placement of each\nglyph.\n\n[courtesy der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu), Eric Taylor \n(etaylor@wilkins.bmc.tmc.edu), and Ken Lee (klee@synoptics.com), 11/90;\nLiam Quin (lee@sq.com), 12/90]\n\n	InterViews (C++ UI toolkit, in the X contrib software) has support for\nrendering rotated fonts in X.

PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for\n many systems, small (micro) and large (super) alike.  Despite its small size\n and quickness, it has enough power to satisfy most users, including: standard\n x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots, mesh plots,\n bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes)\n may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each graph.  Different\n line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually infinite number of\n distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are almost 1000 characters in\n the extended character set.  This includes four different fonts, the Greek\n alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and other symbols.  The fonts\n can be scaled to any size for various effects.  Many different output device\n drivers are available (system dependent), including a portable metafile\n format and renderer.\n\n The PLPLOT package is freely distributable, but NOT in the public domain.\n The PLPLOT source code, except header files and those files explicitly\n granting permission, may not be used in a commercial software package without\n consent of the authors.  You are allowed and encouraged to include the PLPLOT\n object library and header files in a commercial package provided that: (1) it\n is explicitly and prominently stated that the PLPLOT library is freely\n available, and (2) the full copyrights on the PLPLOT package be displayed\n somewhere in the documentation for the package.\n\n We welcome suggestions on how to improve this code, especially in the form of\n user-contributed enhancements or bug fixes.  If PLPLOT is used in any\n published papers, please include an acknowledgment or citation of our work,\n which will help us to continue improving PLPLOT.  Also, please remember that\n as PLPLOT is not a commercial product, we cannot be expected to offer the\n kind of support that a commercial product may.  There is great interest\n in extending PLPLOT and fixing bugs, but the principal authors can only\n afford to work on it part time.  Improvements will necessarily focus on\n those which help us get our work done.\n\n PLPLOT is written in C, enabling it to run on many platforms practically\n without modification.  Fortran programs may use it transparently; stub\n routines are provided to handle the C<->Fortran interface without any\n modification of the user program.  C programs are required to include the\n header file "plplot.h"; see the documentation for more details.\n\n The main documentation for PLPLOT is in the doc/ directory in the form of\n several TeX files; please consult this for additional information ('latex\n plotdoc').  Unfortunately documentation tends to lag actual improvements to\n the code, so don't be surprised if some known features are not explained\n there.  Consult 'Changes.log' to see a list of recent changes.  \n\n At present, PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems:\n\n	 Unix:	SunOS\n		 A/IX \n		 HP-UX\n		 Unicos\n		 DG/UX\n		 Ultrix\n		 SysV\n		 Linux\n\n	 Amiga/Exec\n	 MS-DOS\n	 OS/2\n	 NeXT\n\n For more information on how to get or use PLPLOT on your system, see:\n  - appendices to the PLPLOT manual\n  - system-specific documentation in the appropriate sys/<system> directory.\n\n To become a subscriber to the PLPLOT mailing list, send a request to\n plplot-request@dino.ph.utexas.edu.\n\n CREDITS\n -------\n\n PLPLOT is the result of the effort of many people, so it is impractical to\n list all the contributors.

I am looking for a package that implements standard\nimage processing functions (reading/writing from\nstandard formats), clipping, zoom, etc. implemented\nunder X. Both public domain and private packages\nare of interest. The particular application area I\nhave in mind is medical imaging, but a package meant\nfor a more general context would be acceptable.\n\nPlease reply to me; I will summarize on the net if\nthere is general interest.
Let me add another of my concerns: Yes, I can buy a port of Motif for "cheap",\nbut I cannot get the source for "cheap", hence I am limited to using whatever X\nlibraries the Motif port was compiled against (at least with older versions of\nMotif. I have been told that Motif 1.2 can be used with any X, but I have not\nseen it myself).\n\n  Currently, I have X11R5 running on eight different unix platforms, of which\nonly three came with Motif. On those three, I am unable to use the X11R5\nlibraries to build Motif clients, because I get link errors between the\nvendor-supplied port of Motif and my X11R5. I anticipate having this same\nproblem when X11R6 becomes available.\n\n  The result is that I cannot build Motif clients that rely on X11R5, since I do\nnot have Motif compiled under X11R5. True, I could buy another port of Motif,\nbut that sort of ruins the whole idea of "free", doesn't it?\n\n    Cheers,\n\n    Tom McConnell

Correct. Most X servers use a version of  malloc(3)  which will not return\n  memory to the OS (ie. the X server might  free(3)  a Pixmap, but the heap does\n  not shrink).\n\n  Well, part of the routines I mentioned do a dirty little trick to get around\n  that problem. First, I create the shared memory segment, attach the client,\n  attach the X server, and then remove (!) the segment. If you read the man\n  pages on removing of shared memory segments, you will see that the segment\n  only dies after all attachments are gone.\n  Now, if the client dies, that's one attachment gone (the OS cleans up for you)\n  and since the X server notices the client has dies, frees up it's resources,\n  including detaching from the segment: there goes the last attachment. No more\n  shared memory segment.\n  Terrible, but it works.\n\n				Regards,
BTW, the X11 tools come as sources. The sillyness of most vendors lets you\nstuck with binaries.\n\nAnyway, have a look onto xgrab/xgrabsc. It does the IMHO best job for\nthis, including compression.
Does anyone know the difference between MOOLIT and OLIT?  Does Sun\nsupport MOOLIT?  Is MOOLIT available on Sparcstations?\n\nI have recntly downloaded a copy of wkshTree written by Eric Wallengren\nof Univel.  There are many widgets that are apparently available only\nto MOOLIT but not OLIT.\n\nIs there a wkshTree program available under OLIT?
