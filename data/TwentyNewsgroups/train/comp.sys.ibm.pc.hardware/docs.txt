I own an 80386sx, 16Mhz, 2Mb ram machine and am finding it too slow for\ncertain games such as X-wing. I was in a Computer store there the other\nday and saw a series of Gamecards which claim to speed up your machine\nto up to 80Mhz! I was wondering if anyone out there who has a similar\nmachine had bought one or seen one of these Gamecards and whether or not\nthey do actually work!\n	Any help here would be much appreciated,\n		Thanks in advance,\n			Greg.\n\n--
Hi,\n  I am looking to buy an accelerated video card for my 486 DX 50 with	\nISA bus.  I have a 14" SVGA NI monitor.  I'm currently running\nDOS 5.0 and windows 3.1, although I'm considering OS/2 in the	\nfuture.  Can anyone make a suggestion for a video card that would\nsuit my needs?  How is Diamond speedstar? Stealth? Etc....\n				Thanks.\n					--Kent
Hi!\n\nOne of the ASPI-drivers (I think it's the ASPICD) supports a /NORST\nparamter, which means to not reset the SCSI bus when it loads. This\nfixed the problem a friend of mine was having with his adaptec+tosh \n3401.\n\nRegards,
Hi\n	I have an Orchid Fahrenheit VLB with 2MB of DRAM.  It is an S3\n86c805 based card.  I had a problem for a while after installing my\nsecond meg of DRAM for the video, and thanks to Orchid, I got a fix\nfrom their tech support (it was jumper settings not given in the\nordinary manual.  I assume it would come with memory ordered from\nthem, so I guess I should be glad they didn't just say "Buy the memory\nfrom us" or something like that.)\n\n	The one thing that I was puzzled by was why there was not a\n1024x768x32k color mode on the thing, either in full screen or\nenlarged desktop mode.  My ATI Ultra Plus can handle that, given 2MB\nof memory.  All the 2MB buys you on the Fahrenheit is 1280x1024x256.\nJust ONE more mode.  GEEZ.  Had I known, I wouldn't have bothered.  I\nasked them why, and all I got was "Your point is well taken, but\nOrchid's software developers are busy with other projects."\n\n	So, to get to the point, finally, ARE there any s3 86c805\ndrivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes?  I'd love to\nget another card, but perhaps it will have to wait until the next\ngeneration of cards comes out, since this card came bundled with my\nsystem and it's not so easy to exchange these things unless they're\nbroken.\n\n	If you want these modes, steer away from Orchids s3 86c805\ncards (ie. VLB or VA/VLB), at least until their developers are "less\nbusy".  If the magazines are to believed, I've only seen one s3 86c805\nproduct thus far which can handle 1024x768x32k color (Genoa?),\nalthough evenn that might be a misprint.\n\n	Please, if there are generic or semi-generic drivers out\nthere, let me know where I can get them.  800x600x32k is OK, but I\ncoulda gotten that with my ATI VGA Wonder XL.
Has anyone taken a look at the new ViewSonic 17? They claim 1280x1024 at 76Hz.\nHow does it compare with the T560i in terms of price, and quality of display?
I have a Sony 1604S 17" monitor and I don't see any lines across\nthe screen and am only using the non interlaced mode.\nBut because of the hor. lines and poping that I do see and hear\nwhen I am usinf 800x600x256 and 1024x768x256 modes and switch back\nto anything of less. I would not buy another Sony at what ever price.\nOh ya this is I guess a 15" viewing area. It don't impress me one bit!   Sam
Wow, you guys are really going wild on this IDE vs. SCSI thing, and I think\nit's great!\n\nHowever, I think that some people (such as myself) would benefit from answers\nto the simple(?) question:  Which would YOU choose, and why?\n\nLike lots of people, I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from\nthe hard drive.  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), and\nwhat I would say is a standard (not special, no cache I believe) IDE controller\ncard on my ISA 486-50.\n\nI'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range.\nAnd I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head)\nabout buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).  I believe I'm getting\nsomething like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU).\n\nHow would this\nnumber compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, and\nthe state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)?\n\nObviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would\nYOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost?\n\nAlong those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I\nwere to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD?\nAnd how much would it cost?\n\nI actually have a PAS-16, and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hook\nup a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec.\nActually, I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (and\nown the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).  Is this SCSI port a\nSCSI-2 port?  How could I tell?  Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI-2?  Are all SCSI\nHD's SCSI-2?\n\nThanks for any comments.
I thought this was a neat feature until I noticed that\nwhen an image is re-sized, the scanning frequency is\nnecessarily changed.  This causes digital multiscan\nmonitors like my MAG MX17F to get confused as to which\nmode to use if the frequency gets too far from the\nstandard selections.  For this reason, I use the\n"factory defaults" for position/size on the ATI card\nand adjust each mode individually (only the first time)\nat the monitor.  The MAG (and many other multiscan\nmonitors) has (have) the ability to recall these settings\nthe next time each mode is "detected".\n-- \n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
...\n\nIt's an interesting idea, but the worst-case data patterns developed to\ntest magnetic media are totally different than the patterns used to detect\ncommon faults in memory chips.
: As far as I can tell, the MD is an offshoot of technology that already exists.\n: It is an MO drive.  MO drives exist already for computers.  They're expensive\n: and a bit slow, but the disks are cheep (128 mb disks).  Dan.\n\nI read a recent article in Personal Computer World mainly about the new\ndigit audion formats (DCC and MD) but at the end talked about how nice\nit would be to use these for data storage with a brief calculation of\nhow much data you could store. The author had been talking to someone\nfrom Sony about these formats and mentioned this to get the reply "MD\nis a purely audio format, we wouldn't use it for data", then when\npressed for info about MO the Sony man basically admitted that it was\nno more than a slight adaptabtion on MD!\n\nWhat I think the original poster was wanting was MO drives at MD audio\nplayer prices. I'd assume that the problem here is that an MD system\ncan have higher tolerances than an MO system as the ear doesn't pick up\nthe occasional bit error as well as an archiving program!\n\n--
I need to know the Pins to connect to make a loopback connector for a serial\nport so I can build one.  The loopback connector is used to test the \nserial port.\n\nThanks for any help.
It sounds like a MAGNAVOX with a sick flyback on its way out!
MINE has a 16450 sodered right on the card.  Why would you need the 16550\nanyway?  From what I've heard, when you're multitasking, its FIFO buffer keeps\nyou from loosing data.  Is this right?
I would doubt that you would be able to use the hard drive. XT drives\nusually came in MFM or RLL flavors. I bet your 386SX has IDE drives. The\ntwo are not compatible on the same controller. However, you might be\nable to use the drive *with its controller* in your 386SX. You should be\nable to plug your 360K drive into your existing 386SX controller (I\nthink). You might have to use the floppy controller that was used in the\nXT.
Do you really need to switch to a DX2/66 instead of a DX50?  As I\n   understand it, DX50's can have local bus devices (on the mother-board?)\n   but not local bus slots.  And according to what I been told, many\n   systems go beyond the VESA local bus standard in order to provide DX50\n   systems with a local bus slot capability.  I have definitly seen a\n   mother board with 2 local bus slots which claimed to be able to\n   support any CPU, including the DX2/66 and DX50.  Can someone throw\n   some more informed light on this issue?\n\nYou will need to check with peripheral makers to see if their boards\nwill work at 50 MHz.  Some will with some motherboards.

Did I once hear that in order for the date to advance, something, like a \nclock, *has* to make a Get Date system call? Apparently, the clock\nhardware interrupt and BIOS don't do this (date advance) automatically. The\nGet Date call notices that a "midnight reset" flag has been set, and then\nthen advances the date.\n\nAnybody with more info?
Do you happen to know how I can get a serial mouse (9 pins) working on\nan IBM L40 notebook (which has a kind of bus mouse connection besides serial\nand parallel interfaces). The manual doesn't say anything about it.\n\nI've tried two drivers, with the result that left and right buttons are\nrecognized, but mouse movement is not. Should I cut or shortcut some\nwires to/from the mouse?\n\nThanks for your help.
What are the current products available to upgrade the resolution?\nWhich ones support postscript?\n\nAny experiences with them, either good or bad?\n\nIs the quality difference really noticable?
Andrew,\nYou can get the heat sinks at Digi-Key 1-800-344-4539 part #HS157-ND\n$4.10  size 1.89"L x 1.89"W x .600"H  comes with clips to install it.\nBut if it was me I would get a $12.99 small fan from Radio Shack\nand install it where it could just blow at the cpu instead...Sam
My Western Digital also has three sets of pins on the back. I am using it with\nanother hard drive as well and the settings for the jumpers were written right \non the circuit board of the WD drive......MA SL ??\n\nI can't remember what the last one was. If you can't find these markings on the\ncircuit board, I'll open my machine and tell you what mine are.......
Just taken delivery of a 66MHz 486 DX2 machine, and very nice it is too.\nOne query - the landmark speed when turbo is on is 230 or something MHz\n- thats not the problem. The problem is the speed when turbo is off. Its\n7 MHz. The equivalent in car terms is having a nice Porsche with a button\nthat turns it into a skateboard.\n\nDoes anyone have a clue as to what determines the relative performance of\nturbo vs non-turbo?? I would like to set it to give a landmark speed of\nabout 30 or 40 MHz with turbo off.\n\nCheers,
Has anyone connected a high-res, fixed frequency monitor to their PC?\nI have a mitubishi monitor that does 1024x768 at 60hz, but won't do\nany other resolutions.  All the video cards designed for this sort of\nthing are very expensive (>$400).  Has anyone done it with an SVGA\ncard (I know it can be done, it's just a question of getting the card\nat the right resolution and frequency)?  I'd like to use a mono\n(hercules) monitor as my dos/command line monitor, and switch to the\nmitsu for Windows or X-windows (under Linux or 3BSD).\n\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

The problem is with ISA bus-masters which\ncan only address the first 16MBs of system\nmemory.  Bus-masters do not use the CPU\nnor the system DMA to do the actual data\ntransfer but transfer their data directly\nto the system RAM.\n\nrp93
For those of you who might be familiar with Insight Distribution\n     Network, Inc. and their Multimedia Kits:\n\nI'm seriously considering buying the Insight Talon TA-2000 MM Kit, which\nis bundled with the CD-ROM drive with 265-280ms access time, 300Kb dtr,\nmultispin, multi-session Photo CD capability, etc., and with the PAS-16\nsound card, etc.... (if you are familiar with Insight, you know the kit\nI mean).  I believe the drive is either a Texel (265ms) or an NEC\n(280ms), but it is not clear to me which one is actually a part of the\nbundle (at least two of their sales people couldn't give me a straight\nanswer as to which one; ah, yes, one of the drawbacks of OEM!).\n\nOther questions:\n\n- Excuse my ignorance, but is "Texel" a reputable maker in the CD-ROM\n  market?  Or do you think NEC is the better drive?\n\n- Bottom line:  Is this kit worth the money?  (Currently, $449 for the\n  TA-1000, and $699 for the TA-2000)\n\nAlternatively, I was thinking that the TA-2000 might be overkill for my\nuses (however, I *do* want full multimedia capabilities, Photo CD stuff,\neducational programs for my kids, etc.), and considered the lower-end\nTA-1000 kit and using the difference (around $250.00) to get something\nelse useful, like a tape back-up drive unit.\n\nBasically, I would just like to hear from those who have actually USED\nthese kits, and whatever pros/cons you might advise, preferably\ndirectly to the email address below.\n\nThanks,\n\nKoji
There is a premium of approx $200 for the controller. What is nice is \nbeing able to run hard disks, tape drives, cd-roms and scanners of\none dma channel and interupt!\n\nSCSI makes sense is you are going to load up a machine, if you just want\na standard box for Windows then IDE makes sense.\n\nI have one loaded box that uses SCSI and run Unix and one standard box\nthat runs DOS/Windows that uses IDE.\n\n\n[ By standard I mean - 486, 4-8MB RAM, 200MH disk, S3 video ]\n\n\nI beleive this last bit is just plain wrong!\n\n\nGuy

Is there anybody who has (or can point me in the right direction) any\ninformation about protected mode? Also interested in protected mode viewed from\na OS point of view.
I had this problem some time ago.  Some BIOSes do not automatically install \nCOM3 or COM4 in the port tables. Programs like most modem programs which \nwrite directly to the port work fine but anything that uses a BIOS call \nfails. Find a BBS or FTP site where you can get a copy of PORT FINDER. Put \n"device=pf.sys" in your config.sys or run pf.com from your autoexec.bat. \nThis little program will locate all existing ports and make sure the BIOS \ntables are updated. It works great. PF will also let you swap ports and \nsuch also if that is of any value to you.
I have just a few quick questions.  Does anyone here have a 486 DLC\nsystem? (a Cyrix 486 DX)  Any problems with it?  \nSecond, how much should a Cyric 486DLC-33 motherboard (with\nno RAM) run me?  \n3rd...Should a total amatuer (like myslef) be able to perform\na motherboard swap without the aid of a technician, or is it\nbeyond hope?\n4th...I hear that some (if not all) hard drives may require reformatting\nif you switch them to another computer (or motherboard as the case may\nbe).  Is there any truth to this?
I am no expert on this.  But I am pretty sure there is no way to recover this.  IDE drive has mapping information written directly on drives.  When you  low level format it, the information itself is gone as well, I don't think you can get it back unless you send it back to Western Digital and ask them to refurbish it for you.
I am looking for a company that can make custom keys.  For instance we need\na key that says HELP, MAIN MENU, etc which we are going to use instead of\nF1,F2, F3 etc... Can anyone point me to a company that does this.  Also \ndo you have to have a special keyboard, or can I just pop off the old keys\nand pop in the new ones...
Thanks for the info.\n\n\nHow much more does the F550iW cost?

I have had a Zeos for a couple months.  While the experience was not\npainless or perfect, it was way better than that endured by most (7\npeople I personally know) who have ordered Gateways.  (Of course,\nseveral of the Gateway buyers were rewarded by getting free stuff as\nGateway can't seem to keep track of what it has or hasn't sent\nout...B{) \n\nI got the 1 MB Viper card.  The first one was defective, but Zeos\nreplaced it with only minor hassles.  This one works fine.  I haven't\nnoticed any problems in any of my applications.  I also ordered it\nbecause of all the complaints about the ATI a few months ago.  Guess\nyou can choose either buggy state-of-the-art stuff, or robust average\nstuff.... \n\nFor my particular configuration (tower, 300 watt supply, pkg#3, no\nmonitor, viper, etc.) the Zeos was slightly cheaper than Gateway,\nAustin, etc.  But this can change from month to month.

(I take\n   this to mean error correction isn't the bottleneck)\n\n  "For page-mode operations, the data-transfer rate to and from the buffer\n   RAM is up to 10.0 MB/s. This high transfer rate allows the AT Interface\n   IC to communicate over the AT bus at a data-transfer rate of 5.0 MB/s,\n   while the DCS simultaneously controls disk-to-RAM transfers"\n                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nSo the thing can even do it's cache pre-fetch WHILE it's sending the\nrequested sector (it has 3 64KB read buffers for pre-fetching, I guess\nyou could call that a cache :-|).\n\nSo when I do a sequential read on the outer tracks, WHY am I getting a\nmeasly 862KB/sec when I should be getting around 3MB/sec???\n\nAny of you hard-disk engineers out there know?

Hello,\n\n	I have a 486sx25 ISA machine with Pheonix BIOS.  Currently I have  \n8 megabytes of RAM installed via eight 1 MG SIMMS on the motherboard: ie.  \nboth banks are full, and there is no space for more SIMMS.  I am thinking  \nof running OS2 on my machine and Possibly Linux with X windows, and I know  \nthat more RAM would be helpful.  However with SIMMS, the only solution I  \ncan see is to sell my 8 Megs for about $180, and by 4 4mg SIMMS for about  \n$400 used. Apart from the fact that I can't afford the price right now,  \nthe entire process of selling RAM and buying it used probably means that  \nthe machine might be down for a number of days which I would rather  \navoid...\n\nSo my question is, do the AT RAM boards that plug into a free slot work  \nwell with a 486 ISA machine. I have seen some being sold used for about  \n$90 with 4 Mg with space for another 4Mg's.  If these boards do work, how  \ndo they do it?  Is a device driver needed, or will the BIOS pickup the  \nextra RAM as it does with the SIMMS on the mother board? I know that the  \nISA expansions slots are 16-bits and 486 SIMM memory is 32 bits, so  \nprobably all of this is just wishful thinking... However any help is truly  \nappreciated.\n\n-Eric
I remember reading somewhere (QEMM manual, I think) that \nSTACK=9,256 is needed only for the Windows SETUP program.  \nOtherwise, use STACK=0,0.
I have one and it is my favorite CD-ROM drive so far.  I also have \na NEC-74 and have had experience with several other drives (Various \nPhillips drives)\n\n	The 3401 is faster than the NEC, I like its door better (the NEC \nneeds 2 hands), the XA handling (The NEC needs to be re-booted to go from \nXA to ROM while the 3401 does it on the fly), All in all I am seriously \nconsidering replacing my NEC with another Toshiba.
This is not the case: the ROM on the P9000 supports VESA modes of up to\n1024x768 in 256 colors.  VESA-compliant applications should have no trouble\nsetting these modes. (But I'm forwarding your posting to our Software group,\njust in case.  Can't be too careful.)  Not that I doubt that YOUR applications\nare failing to run; lots of stuff depends on figuring out which exact SVGA\nthey're looking at, and don't use VESA calls (VESA is still pretty new).\nEvery new chip set confuses them.\n\n\nI think we go to AT LEAST 76 Hz at 1024x768x8, and maybe more (and\nit's a function of the RAMDAC speed, not the Power 9000). We need to\nfix the problems you've noted (they were already on the list).  If\nyou're really interested, though, take a look at the text file\nP9000RES.DAT, which holds the data from which the choices in the\nP9000 monitor installation program are built.  Working by analogy,\nyou can build up a new monitor definition that has the right\ncombinations of refresh rates for your monitors.  Keep a backup copy\nof the file!  Once you've built a new version of the P9000RES.DAT\nfile, run the P9000 installation program, INST, and your new choices\nshould show up.  (This assumes you have the WEITEK v. 2.2 drivers.\nYou can tell the rev number by looking at the modification time of\nthe driver: 02:20 is version 2.20.  Microsoft uses this gimmick,\ntoo.)\n\n\nThe SPEEDY benchmark was put out by Hercules and IIT, who to my\nknowledge were unencumbered by any motivations except making the\nHercules Graphite/IIT AGX014 card look really good.  So I'd take the\nnumbers with a ton of salt. (Texas Instruments did the same thing\nwith WINTACH, trying to make the 34020 look good compared to the\n8514, as if anyone cared.)  It's safer (though not safe) to use\nbenchmarks from "unbiased" sources, such as testing labs, columnists,\netc.\n\n\n\nI think you'll a large discrepancy between the results of SPEEDY and\nthe results of anything else in the universe on these things.\n\n\nFont caching is a perfectly legitimate optimization -- Windows has\nhooks for it built right into the GDI.  What's kind of silly is IIT's\nuse of a hardwired "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog then\nsat on a tack" string in their driver.  Not only is it useless in\nreal applications, it lacks the programming elegance of the "Bart\nSimpson optimization," in which you save the bitmap of the\nmost-recently drawn string in off-screen memory, and just do a\nscreen-to-screen bitblit if you happen to be given that same string a\nsecond time in a row.  (We call it the "Bart Simpson optimization"\nbecause Bart's the only person we can see benefiting from it: he\ncould right "I will not cheat on benchmarks" a hundred times and be\ndone in half the time it would take to actually form each character.)\n\n\nWe don't have any lawyers -- they're all working for Intel.

I'm looking for a complete hw/sw solution:\nI need an ISA/VLB scsi controller (e.g Ultrastor 34F)\nplus a tape drive (500Mb or less like Archive) plus a Windows\nprogram that will work on these.\n\nMy intended system will have 32Mb RAM so\nplain ISA controllers will no longer do.\nBut I also hear that the SCSI world\nis not very organized.\n\nSo does anybody have a tape backup setup\nlike what I'm looking for ? Please\ndescribe it.\n\nThanks. e-mail please.
I read about the development of EISA-2 some time ago but dismissed it\nin light of the intense interest in VESA and PCI.  However, I recently\nwas disheartened to hear that ISA cannot address more than 16mb of RAM,\na limit that too many of us will hit all too soon.\n\nI recall that EISA-2 will support 64-bit transfer among other enhancements.\nIs there such a standard being developed?

What group is this?  This is not a MAC group.\n\n\nWhy the spec list again?  We are talking SCSI on a PC, not on a MAC or\na UNIX box.  And we are talking ISA bus, or possibly EISA or VLB.\n\nThis isin't comp.periphs.SCSI.\nTell me what the performance figures are with a single SCSI drive on a PC\nwith an ISA (or EISA or VLB) bus.\n\nTheoretical performance figures are not relevant to this group or this\ndebate.  I'm sure that there are some platforms out there that can\nhandle the 40 megs/sec of SCSI xyz wide'n'fast, but the PC isin't one of\nthem.

I've started to notice the same thing myself. I'm running DOS 5 and Win 3.1 so\nI can fix it from the Windows Control Panel. At times it is the date, at\nothers the clock seems to be running several minutes behind where it should\nbe.\n\nIf you find out I'd like to know also.

Hi there,\n\nI think it is time to create a MS DOS 6.0  FAQ since lots of questions\nabout it are actually flooding the net.  I won't be able to write it\nmy self because of the lack of time/knowledge/experience.
Some motherboards support VL bus and 50-DX CPU.  There is an option\n(BIOS I think) where additional wait(s) can be added with regard to\nCPU/VL bus transactions.  This slows the CPU down to a rate that gives\nthe VL bus device(s) time to 'do their thing'.  These particular wait(s)\nare applied when the CPU transacts with VL bus device(s).  You want to\nenable these wait(s) only if you are using a 50-DX with VL bus devices.\n\nThis is from reading my motherboard manual, and these are my interpre-\ntations.  Your mileage may vary.\n\nStrictly speaking, VL and 50mhz are not compatable.  And, there is at\nleast one 'fudge' mechanism to physically allow it to work.
That's nonsense!!  You can use ISA cards in an EISA-system without problem\nand at the same speed as in an ISA system!!
I don't know if this is an obvious question, but can any of the current \nbatch of windows accelerator cards (diamond etc) be used to drive a monitor \nwhich has RGB and horizontal and vertical sync ( 5 BNC jacks altogether) \nconnectors out the back??  I might be able to get ahold of a Raster \nTechnologies 17" monitor (1510 ??)cheap and I was wondering if it was \npossible to connect it via an adapter (RGB to vga ??) to my Gateway, would \nI need different drivers etc.  \n\n\nThanks
I think it would be a great idea to have a new group created:\n\ncomp.sys.ibm.pc.flame.therapy
No, you need not bypass the config.sys, in Dos 6.0, there is a function \nof multi-config, have you tried BOOT.SYS ? the multi-config is the kind that \nyou can choose you config.sys at the startup. And I find that is very good. \nIt has no conflict to QEMM. (I have problem when using BOOT.SYS)\n    The key you say is F8, which is trace the config.sys step by step.\n    Sorry, if any error :)

Asynchronous Transfer: ~5MB/s max.\n\n: Why don't you start with the spec-sheet of the ISA bus first?\n: You can quote SCSI specs till you're blue in the face, but if they\n: exceed the ISA bus capability, then what's the point?\n\nWho said ISA was necessary?  EISA or VLB are the only interfaces worth\ninvesting thousands of dollars (e.g. a new pc's worth of money ) in .\n\n: Who says IDE is limited to 5 megs/sec?  What about VLB-IDE?  Does anyone\n: know how they perform?\n\nYou didn't read to carefully.  VLB-IDE uses the same connection mechanism\nas standard IDE.

I've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time.  It's pretty ugly.\n\nI just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home.  I paid $369 for it.  I\nhaven't seen IDE drives cheaper.\n\n: The original CGA cart back in '84 was $300.  I think the original EGA card\n: (or PGA?) was $800.  SCSI has stood relatively alone in not coming down\n: in price, mainly because we're talking about PC's and not Sun's or Sparc\n: or SGI or (name your favorite unix workstation).  That is, after millions\n: of PC buying decisions over the years, SCSI has had plenty of time to\n: come down in price.\n\nNo, actually, we're talking about SCSI being expensive simply because\nnobody did a common interface for the PC.  If they had a common (read:\neasily implemented) method of adding scsi to a PC (like as in a Sun or\nMac), then you'd find SCSI the connection medium of choice.\n\n: I won't argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good, well implimented\n: data highway, but I still want to know why it intrinsically better\n: (than IDE, on an ISA bus) when it comes to multi-tasking OS's when\n: managing data from a single SCSI hard drive.\n\nOn a single drive, SCSI is more expensive.  But, you bought your PC for\nexpandibility, so, you'd want to add more drives or whatever.  The\nfollowing are why I find SCSI intrinsically better than IDE:\n\nA (partial?) list:\n	1.  You can add many different types of devices and access them \n	concurrently.\n	2.  A SCSI device works on many different machines (I have a mac\n	and a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nice\n	with SCSI -- hook them up and away they go)\n	3.  SCSI devices work together better than IDE devices.  For\n	instance, recently, I added an older connor 100 meg IDE to a maxtor\n	212 meg IDE.  The connor *MUST* be setup as the slave.  It will\n	work no other way.  On SCSI, you set the address, check the\n	termination, plug it in, and away it goes.\n	4.  I have a problem with IDE's mutual exclusion - I notice that\n	the time it takes to switch from accessing drive c: to drive d: is\n	quite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c:\n	to d: on a SCSI system.  Under a multitasking OS, this is very\n	noticable, as many things can be going on at once.\n\nOne neat thing that I've noticed lately (a fringe benefit) has been the\nability to add older (almost dead) drives as storage on a SCSI system with\nlittle problem -- we've got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that I've\nadded to my PC.  I've now got the interface full, but, it does allow me to\nhave 4 20 meg drives, 1 240 meg drive, 1 tape drive, and 1 105 meg drive\nall on the same card.  \n\nSimply put, SCSI is handier than IDE.  No mysterious jumpers to figure out.\n\nGreg.

By initiating a DMA xfer.  :)\n\nSeriously, busmastering adapter have their own DMA ability, they don't use\nthe motherboards on-board DMA(which is *MUCH* slower).\n\nISA has no bus arbitration, so if two busmastering cards in 1 ISA system\ntry to do DMA xfers on the same DMA channel the system will lock or \ncrash.(I forget)\n\nTheir are 8 DMA channels in an ISA system. 0-7. 0-3 are 8-bit & 4-7 are\n16-bit.\n\nThe system uses DMA 0, a SoundBlaster uses DMA 1.\n\nI could buy a busmastering XGA-2 video card & a busmastering SCSI HA.\n\nIn order for them to work properly, I would have to find out what DMA\nchannel the XGA-2 card uses and then simply configure the SCSI HA to\nuse a different DMA channel for its DMA xfers.\n\nI don't know if multiple DMA xfers can go on at the same time on ISA.\nI'm not sure if they can on EISA systems either.\n\nI do know that on EISA/MCA systems, you can allow BM cards to use the\nsame DMA channel.

Dear All,\n\n	I am trying to get my standard connection going with KA9Q (PA0GRI113016)\nand a GVC NIC-2000 ethernet card. I know that my router and modem is\nworking because I am able to ping, finger, and even telnetd with it.\n\n	However, after a time, it crashes randomly. Help would be\ngreatly appreciated.\n\n	I suspect that there is a hardware conflict in the PC.  I am\nrunning with a 386SX/33, 2 MB Ram.  The Ethernet card is configured\nfor IRQ 5, ports 0x360-0x37F. \n\n	Thanks in advance. I know that it's not much to go on, but I\ndon't even know what the questions to ask are, sorry.\n\nPlease send mail.
IDE does not do DMA.  This is because it's like te PC AT hard disk\ninterface.  The controller moves a sector to some buffer memory on the\ncontroller card, then the CPU moves the data from the buffer to main\nmemory where it's needed.  If IDE doesn't work this way, then it's not\ncompatible.\n\nHeck, if IDE used DMA, then you'd hear all kinds of complaints about\nISA bus systems with more than 16M RAM not working with their IDE\ndrives.  16M is the DMA addressing limit of the ISA bus, and if IDE\ndid DMA there would be trouble.\n\n(BTW, there are DMA-enabling signals in the IDE cable spec, but the\nlast report I heard was that they are never implemented, because it\nwould require a different kind of IDE adapter and different drivers.)
I would like to thank all those people who responded to my post.  I \nwould, however, like to clear some things up.  My tape drive is *external*.\nAlso, the connector on the back of it is of the male DB-37 pin variety.\nAs a result, I cannot easily find a cost-effective solution to use the drive.\n\n     Any advice will be greatly appreciated.  I would prefer email.\n     Thanks!
Technically there is no reason why a chip set cannot support a 486DX50 and\na 25MHz local bus.\n\nI'm waiting for the mezzianine (sp?) VL bus that will be decoupled from\nthe main CPU clock and allow for many more slots due to the user of buffers.\n\nThis will allow the use of ever faster CPUs with the same standard I/O\ncards. Until the next buss spec...\n\n\n\nGuy

ALL this shows is that YOU don't know much about SCSI.\n\nSCSI-1 {with a SCSI-1 controler chip} range is indeed 0-5MB/s\nand that is ALL you have right about SCSI\nSCSI-1 {With a SCSI-2 controller chip}: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}\n Note the INCREASE in SPEED, the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI-1\n so it DOES exist. Some PC use this set up too.\nSCSI-2 {8-bit/SCSI-1 mode}:          4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst\nSCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst\nSCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst\n \nBy your OWN data the "Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI" is correct\nWith a SCSI-2 controller chip SCSI-1 can reach 10MB/s which is indeed\n"20% faster than IDE" {120% of 8.3 is 9.96}. ALL these SCSI facts have been\nposted to this newsgroup in my Mac & IBM info sheet {available by FTP on \nsumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the info-mac/report as \nmac-ibm-compare[version #].txt (It should be 173 but 161 may still be there)}\n\nPart of this problem is both Mac and IBM PC are inconsiant about what SCSI\nis which.  Though it is WELL documented that the Quadra has a SCSI-2 chip\nan Apple salesperson said "it uses a fast SCSI-1 chip" {Not at a 6MB/s,\n10MB/s burst it does not. SCSI-1 is 5MB/s maximum synchronous and Quadra\nuses ANsynchronous SCSI which is SLOWER}  It seems that Mac and IBM see\nSCSI-1 interface and think 'SCSI-1' when it maybe a SCSI-1 interface driven\nin the machine by a SCSi-2 controller chip in 8-bit mode {Which is MUCH\nFASTER then true SCSI-1 can go}.
Maybe its a monitor problem.  You mentioned that you swapped cards, but not\nmonitors.  Perhaps that could be it.\n\nDan
I'd appreciate any advice about a video card for my system:\n\n486-33 DX, 16 mb of ram\non a Novell 3.11 network\nMonitor:  NEC 4FGe, capable of 76 Hz vertical refresh rate\n\nMajor considerations:\n\nI expect I will work mostly in windows, but with some DOS\napplications and I would want decent speed in DOS.

I just bought a new IDE hard drive for my system to go with the one\nI already had.  My problem is this.  My system only had a IDE cable\nfor one drive, so I had to buy cable with two drive connectors\non it, and consequently have to switch cables.  The problem is, \nthe new hard drive's manual refers to matching pin 1 on the cable\nwith both pin 1 on the drive itself and pin 1 on the IDE card.  But\nfor the life of me I cannot figure out how to tell which way to plug\nin the cable to align these.  \nSecondly, the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them.\nI figure one end goes in the controler and then the other two go into\nthe drives.  Does it matter which I plug into the "master" drive\nand which into the "Slave"?  any help appreciated.  thanks...

: \n:    Oh yeah, I just read in another newsgroup that the T560i uses a\n:    high quality Trinitron tube than is in most monitors.(the Sony\n:    1604S for example) and this is where the extra cost comes from.  It\n:    is also where the high bandwidth comes from, and the fantastic\n:    image, and the large image size, etc, etc...\n: \n: It's also where the two annoying lines across the screen (one a third\n: down, the other two thirds down) come from.\n: \n\nThe 2 lines are not a result of the high end trinitron tube, these\n2 wires will be found on all 17" trinitron tubes (e.g., Mitsubishi 17",\nSony 1604, etc).  On 14" Sony tubes, you'll find one wire.\n\nTheir level of annoyance is purely subjective.  I'm so happy with the\nsharpness of the T560i that I don't even notice the lines.\n\nThe T560i uses a Trinitron SA tube which, when viewed as a complete tube,\nhas a larger diameter than the standard Trinitron tube.  This results in \na flatter screen than other 17" monitors using the standard trinitron \n(which has a vertically flat but not horizontally flat surface), and \napparently the ability to provide a tighter beam focus.

Well, some quick math on my part shows that an 8.3MHz bus, 16 bits\nwide, performing a transfer every two clock cycles will provide 8.3M\nbytes/sec.  Someone said that it really takes 3 clock cycles to\nperform a transfer, so that reduces the transfer rate to 5.5MB/s,\nwhich is the commonly-used figure for ISA bus speed.  However, I\nbelieve a two-clock transfer is possible (0 wait states).
[much discussion about switching 5.25" and 3.5" drives removed]\n\nAnother (albeit strange) option is using a program like 800 II\n(available via anonymous FTP at many major sites), or FDFORMAT\n(also available via anonymous FTP), that allows you to format\n5.25HD disks to 1.44Meg, or 3.5"HD disks to 1.2Meg (along with\nmany MANY other formats!) so you can DISKCOPY (yes, the broken\nMeSsy-DOS DISKCOPY!) the 5.25" disks onto 3.5" disks or vice\nversa...  I use this techniques with "NON-DOS" self-booting \ngame disks on my old Tandy 1000, and it works...  Another program\nnamed Teledisk (shareware--available on many major BBS's) will\nalso make the weird format disks, provided you have 800 II\nor FDFormat installed....  Some disks that won't DISKCOPY\nproperly can be readily Teledisk'd into the proper format...\nAt least this is a software solution for a hardware/BIOS \ndeficiency, eh? \n\n\n--\nJoseph Zbiciak                         im14u2c@camelot.bradley.edu\n[====Disclaimer--If you believe any of this, check your head!====]\n------------------------------------------------------------------
MG>> 	I went buying SIMMs recently, and the sales person told me that \nthe\nMG>> are 9-chip SIMMs and 3-chip SIMMs, and one cannot use them interchan\nMG>> If you use one, you have to use all of the same type.\n\ndon't believe everything you are told.  I can tell you that mixing them \nbetween 'banks' ok, and I can't see why mixing in one bank is not unless \nthey are of different speeds ( e.g. mixing of 60ns and 100ns SIMMs in one \nbank ).  The two only differ in the type of chips it uses.  Assuming that \nthe SIMMS are 1Mx9 ( 9 bit wide ), here is the two equivalent \nconfiguration.  The 3-chip SIMM uses two 4-bit wide 4Mbit (1M of 4-bit \nnibbles ) and one 1-bit wide 1Mbit chip ( for a total of 9-bit wide 1Mbyte \n).  The 9-bit SIMM uses nine 1-bit wide 1Mbit chips.  These are equivalent \nbecause of the way that it is 'pinned' on the SIMM board.  At the SIMM \ninterface, they both act as 9-bit wide 1MByte SIMMS ( 2*4+1=9*1 ).  [sorry \nif too techie for ya].\n\n\nMG>> 	Similarly, one cannot plug in two 1MB SIMMs and one 4MB SIMMs to \ngi\nMG>> the system a total of 6 MEG. Why is that so ?? If my system supports\nMG>> of 8 MEG (it has 8 SIMM slots), can I plug in 4 4MB SIMMs to give my\nMG>> 16MB ??\n\nThat sounds correct.  the problem is that if your computer takes 9-bit \nwide SIMMs, you can not mix different sizes in one bank.  Why you ask?  \nSimple,  if you understand why there is banks.  Assuming you have a 32-bit \nCPU ( 386DX or 486 ), the data bus (e.g. the mechanism to retrieve data \nfrom memory ) is 32-bits wide, so the computer expects to see 32 bits when \nit asks for data.  To get that bandwidth ( 32-bit wide ), the motherboard \nlinks 4 1Mx9 ( one bit is not data, but parity, so I will ignore that in \nthis simple explaination ) to get 32bits [ (9-1)*4=32 bits ].  That means \nthat a SIMM in a bank stores only 1/4 of the 32 bit wide data.  If you \nhave a 16-bit bus, two 1Mx9 SIMMs are linked together to get 16-bit wide \ndata, which is the reason why 286 banks are 2 SIMMs wide, and 32-bit banks \nare 4 SIMMs wide.  If your computer required 1Mx36 ( e.g. 32-bit wide data \nwith 4 parity bits, used in some PS/2s and ASTs ), you could upgrade by \none SIMM at a time.\n\nHope that this message is not over your head, but the answer to your \nquestion was not simple.  I could of just said, 'because I said so.'\n\n-rdd    \n\n---\n . WinQwk 2.0b#0 . Unregistered Evaluation Copy\n * KMail 2.95d W-NET HQ, hal9k.ann-arbor.mi.us, +1 313 663 4173 or 3959
Hi,\n   I'm currently in the process of writing a number of PD programs\nfor the sound blaster. The first of which is a CMF voice editor which\nis hopefully going to be available soon (as soon as I can get it to \nan FTP site).\n\nAnyway the next stage is to use the midi port to enter music and play\nthe FM synth remotely. The problem is that I have little or no info\non the SB midi port.\n\nI have tried using the Sound blaster freedom project routines, however\nthis just results in the port locking after a couple of accesses and\nloss the of note velocity data byte.\n\nI am using Turbo C and would be grateful for any info or source fragments\nmay help. When I was in Berlin this summer I saw a book which seemed to\nhave all this information, but my German is poor to say the least, if anyone\nhas this book could they please mail me.\n\nMy second request for help concerns standard file formats (how can a file \nformat be standard if you keep it secret ?) I need to know the file format \nfor instrument bank files *.BNK and Roland music files *.ROL.\n\nFinally does anyone have a source for displaying PCX or GIF files to EGA\nor VGA monitors.\n\nPlease Help, You know it makes sense.
I have been using a NEC 3FGx for several months now.  Several others here \nalso have this monitor.  We have had no problems.  Personally I would spend \nextra money for this monitor and sacrifice other features on a PC such as 33 \nMHz viz 50 Mhz.  Based on the comments of others you might want to view the \n3FGX vs the 4 series on a PC running windows at 1024x768.  The refresh rate \nappears ok for me, but you might feel differently.  Finally speaking of \nspending money, with the size of today's files, etc, a tape backup is \ncertainly worth $200-$300.  Recently I set up a friend's PC 50Mhz and VESA \nlocal bus.  The redraw time for a graphics program was only a factor of 2 \nfaster which I doubt warrants the extra cost.
I don't know the exact meaning of UART, but I think it is something like\nUniversal Arithmetic Receiver Transmitter. Normally, the older boards have\na 8250 or 16450 UART on board. Those chips generate an IRQ for every char\nthey received. The 16550 UART has an internal 16 byte buffer, so - with the\nright software installed - it generates an IRQ every 16 chars. \n\n\nIf you ran dos, you don't need a 16550, because dos runs only ONE task at a\ntime and the whole cpu-power could be used for the transfer. But if you are\nrunning a multitasking OS such as OS/2, Unix, etc. ( windows ? :-) ), the\ncpu cannot work the whole time with one task. \n\nThe result are lost characters or broken transmissions because of timeouts.\n\n\nNO. The only diffrence is that internal modems have the UART on board,\nwhereas external modems are connected to the computer over a serial port\nwhich has the UART on board.\n\n\nI use a Zyxel1496B with a 16550UART under COHERENT 4.0. I'm very satisfied\nwith it but I think that nearly everyone is satisfied with his own modem.\n\nMichael
Hey folks.\n\nIs it possible to short out your CMOS chip?  I think mine is fried.\nThese are the symptoms...\n\nI have to do the following to get my computer (a Gateway 486DX33)\nto boot...\n\n    Turn the power off\n\n    Disconnect the battery to the CMOS chip\n\n    Turn the power on\n\n    Get into setup upon getting the CMOS configuration error\n\n    Set up the CMOS\n\n    Exit the setup with [F10]  (phoenix bios)\n\n    Ignore the diskette 0 seek error and press [F1]\n\nThe computer then boots normally.  Both hard drives are accessible\nbut the floppy drives are not.\n\nI can back up over the network and such, but if I need to reboot,\nI have to turn off the computer and repeat the steps above.  If I\nsimply <Ctl>-<Alt>-<Del>, the computer hangs after the memory test.\n\nDoes this sound like the CMOS chip is fried?  Can I buy another one?\nWhere?\n\nThank you for your kind attention.\n\njohn

Hello\n\nI have recently suffered from various problems concerning\nan Adaptec 1542A controller.\n\nProblem 1:\nFloppy disk drive doesn't work. There's apparently at least two jumpers\non the controller that affect the floppy disk drive. Unfortunately I\nhave located only one of them (in the lower front corner). I would like\nto know, if there are any other such jumpers and possibly where they \nare located.\n\nProblem 2:\nMy hard disks refuse to boot. With my two SCSI HD's (Rodime, Miniscribe)\nI get a message 'Missing operating system', even though the disks have been\nformatted with the same controller and they damn sure have an operating\nsystem on them. If I boot from a Quantum I might get as far as getting\nthe MS-DOS version information. This might of course be due to incombatible\nmemory drivers.\nAre there any jumpers that could affect the HD causing such errors?\n\n	Thanks in advance\n\n        Jouni
First off, with all these huge software packages and files that\nthey produce, IDE may no longer be sufficient for me (510 Mb limit).\nSecond, (rumor is) Microsoft recognizes the the importance of SCSI\nand will support it soon. I'm just not sure if it's on DOS, Win, or NT.\nAt any rate, the deal is with Corel who makes (I hear) a good\ncohesive set of SCSI drivers.\n\n--

Hi,\n\nI have a few enquiries about PC's and compatibles in general.. Some software\nothers hardware orientated.. (Probably the wrong newsgroup .... as everyone \nclaims..)\n\nAnyway..\n\n1) Does any one happen to have the board jumper details for a Trident 8900\nSVGA graphics card (1MB) or even what the dip switches do on the end.. Mine\nalready works fine (albeit slow) and after having blown up a monitor I found \nout which switch controlled the interlace/non interlace facility.. \n\nBut I'm curious as to why there are 8 dip switches on the card with apparantly\nlittle use..\n\n2) Secondly, does anyone know why Commodore had to be so crazed in their design\nof the PC-40 motherboard with respect to the RAM.. (IE 512 + 512 or 640 +0K) ??\n\n3) Can anyone supply pin details for the expansion ports for a pc (8 or 16 bit\n) .. or even a sample circuit to cause an irq when a button is pressed...\n(Yeah I know its a piece of cake.. I'm lazy 8)\n\n4) Software wise.. Anyone care to divulge some tips on accessing expanded RAM\non a PC (from a program written in Turbo C++).... \n\nFor instance, using farcoreleft() and coreleft() return only memory available\nfrom the base 640K regardless of combinations of EMM386 etc etc...\nWhat I want is to be able to use the RAM above and beyond the 1MB boundary...\n\nI'm not certain whether farmalloc / new actually uses it anyway but I'll \nsuspect not .. \n\n5) Also.. what half brained wit created DOS so as not to be re-entrant??????\n   As a follow on, does anyone have any comments about the use of DOS calls\n   0 to 0C from within a DOS interrupt? Ie will changing the stack size on\n   entry be of use.. Two articles I've read on the subject have given \n   conflicting views... Does anyone have any views on writing direct to\n   screen memory in terms of portability?
They don't have a conflict because technically LPT1: does not use\nIRQ7!.\n     The Parallel printer processor (the actual number escapes\nme) contains a printer control register which enables the chip\nto transmit an interrupt to the interrupt controller as IRQ7,\nthen onto the main processor as Int 0x0F. By default the parallel\nprinter processor does not enable it's interrupt line therefore\nno Int 0x0F's will be sourced from the printer controller chip,\nthus enabling other devices to use the actual IRQ7.\n\n     Note, this applies to COM ports also which by default do not\nroute interrupts to the system bus, although COM's software\nusually enable this feature as it make monitoring COM port\nactivity easier than polling the serial UART, thus probably\ngetting the sound card slighty confused!.
I have heard that there is something called a $25.00 Network that allows\ntwo PC's to be networked by joining their serial ports.  Does someone out\nthere know anything about this?  I would greatly appreciate e-mail on this!\n\nThanks!   tschewe@first.etc.bc.ca
Experiences with Diamond Viper VLB video card\n\nSeveral problems:\n\n1) The ad specified 16.7 million colors at 640x480 resolution with 1MB\n   of VRAM, which is what I have. This color depth is NOT SUPPORTED\n   with video BIOS version 1.00 and drivers version 1.01. A max of 65K\n   colors are supported at 640x800 and 800x600 resolutions with 1MB\n   VRAM.\n\n2) With the 65K color choice I notice two minor irritations:\n\n   a) Under NDW, when an entry in a list is highlighted (such as in an\n      Open menu) and then is deselected, a faint vertical line often\n      remains where the left edge of the highlighted rectangle used to\n      be.\n\n   b) With Word for Windows, when you use shading in a table, the\n      display shows the INVERSE of the shading; for example, if you\n      shade the cell as 10%, the display is 90% (the printout is OK).\n\n3) The big killer bug is using the Borland C++ Integrated Development\n   Environment. The problem occurs when you click on the Turbo Debugger\n   icon (or use the Debugger option in the Run command), and the\n   debugger application goes to VGA character mode (as it is designed\n   to do). The screen goes haywire, and is largely unreadable. The\n   Turbo Debugger display is all garbled.\n\n   Through trial and error, I have found that when the disrupted screen\n   is displayed you should do [Alt-Spacebar] followed by the letter\n   "R". This instructs Turbo Debugger to refresh the screen, and it\n   does this satisfactorily. I wish I didn't have to do this.\n\n   The bug is more than with the Diamond drivers. The same disruptive\n   behavior happens with the standard VGA driver that comes with\n   Windows. There must be something in the video card that mishandles\n   the VGA mode.\n   \n   The problem is not my monitor. The same bug shows up when I use\n   another monitor in place of my usual one.\n\nI still like this video card, and am hoping its problems will be\nremedied (they do offer a 5 year warranty).
Recently my cousin got a second internal IDE drive (a Seagate 210MB,\nI can look up the model number if it's important) and I've been\ntrying to help him install it.  [I've got a vested interest, since\nmy machine's busted and I have to use his until I get mine fixed.]\nHe already has a Seagate 85MB IDE HD (again, I forget the model number\nbut I can find out.)\n\nAnyway, I can't seem to get the bloody thing up.  I've managed to get\none or the other drive up (with the other disconnected), but not both\nat the same time; whenever I try, the thing hangs during bootup -\nnever gets past the system test.  The IDE controller's instruction\nsheet says it supports two drives; I think I've configured the CMOS\ncorrectly; the power's plugged in properly; I even learned about the\nmaster/slave relationship that two HDs are supposed to have (didn't\nknow PCs were into S&M! 8^) and I think I configured the jumpers\nproperly (the 85MB one is the master, the new 210MB one is the slave).\n\nThe only thing I can think of is maybe I'm doing the cabling wrong.  I've\ntried several combinations:\n\ncontroller - master - slave\ncontroller - slave - master\nmaster - controller - slave\n\nNone of them worked.  Unfortunately, I can't think of any others.\n\nAnother possibility is that the 85MB one is already partitioned into\ntwo seperate drives, C and D, and the CMOS asks for "C: drive" and "D:\ndrive" setup info rather than "drive 1" and "drive 2" like most others\nI've seen.  Could this be confusing things?\n\nSo, I need HELP!  The drive came bereft of any docs, except for some\ninfo for the CMOS setup; the controller has a little piece of paper\nabout the size of an index card; I cannibalized the cable (it's one\nof those with a connector at each end and the one in the middle, so\nit looks like a serial connection); now I be lost!\n\nMany, many thanks in advance!  This is practically an emergency (I have\ntwo papers to do on this thing for Monday!)!  Help!\n--
If you bought your IDE drive from a dealer, you shouldn 't have to \nperform a low level format. Even if the 1st HD is already partitioned\ninto C and D, FDISK will automatically assign the 2 nd HD to D and \nchange the 2nd partition of 1st drive to E.

Hi...I need some info on video card.  I am looking a video card that can\ndeliver a high quality picture.

Howdy,\n\nSorry if this has been covered before:\n\nOne of my PC illiterate friends asked me to help him install DRDOS 6.0 on his\nNEC Powermate SX (386SX 16).  Of course, I said "No problem" and went to work.\nUnfortunately, the DRDOS refuses to recognize the hard drive during \ninstallation, even though I am still able to boot off of the hard drive using\nthe old DOS.  After openning it up I discovered it was using an 8-bit \nSeagate SCSI controller on a ST-157N SCSI 40Mbtye drive.  I then booted \nwith DRDOS 6.0 off of the floppy a second time and ran fdisk to see if \nI could access the drive.  Lo and behold the primary 46.5 Mbyte partition \nwas intact (created by DOS 3.1 no less, I didn't think you could go over a\n32Mbyte partition in the older DOSes. I could be wrong...).  I then tried \nto remove the primary partition, which it wouldn't allow me to do.  I am \nunaware of anything special that has to be done with a SCSI drive (I \nkinda expected it to work just like an IDE/MFM/RLL drive for DOS \ninstallations).  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated (except for \n"Throw it in the garbage and buy a new PC")...\n\nThanks in advance,
I would appreciate the driver name from CICA which functions as a 256\ncolor driver for a Quadtel video card. The type of chip or chipset used\nwould suffice as well.
Hello,\n\n    I am having a small problem with my sound blaster pro and a game.\nIs there a utility out there that would tell me what DMA's my system\nis using?
Since I've been seeing all kinds of complaints regarding Gateways\nlately on here, I thought I post my recent pleasant experiences. My\nmachine (4DX2-66V) this past Friday. This was two weeks to the DAY from\nwhen I called the order in. \n\n   Upon unboxing it I found everything to be in perfect order. All the \nperipherals I ordered were properly installed (Jumbo-250 & CD-ROM). I\nwas very impressed with the quantity and quality of the Gateway \ndocumentation. All software came with the original disks and manuals.\nThe Gateway manual itself is in a nice 3-ring binder. The ATI GUP came\nwith build59 drivers. All other software I specified (Microsoft Office)\nwas properly installed. The machine came right up out of the box and \nhas been performing flawlessly. It's been on all weekend and it hardly\neven reaches room temperature. I think the big roomy tower case has a \nlot to do with it. \n\n   It's up and running DOS 6.0 with no problems. I've also read about\nsome people having problems with high speed serial communications. \nI used the DOS 6.0 InterLink program which lets me link to my old\ncomputer via a serial port at 115.2K baud. It then "maps" the other\nmachines two hard disks as my disks F & G. You can "cd" to these\ndrives and either run programs or copy files. It's almost like a\npeer-peer lan except you can also *run* programs on the other machine.\nIt's not a two way street. The other machine is the server and this\nmachine is the client. So thats where it seems to differ from the \npeer to peer stuff. For a bundled DOS utility its very impressive. \n\n  My Jumbo-250 took about 11 minutes to back up 117MB of data. I also\nby-passed any potential Gateway monitor problems by taking the $430\ncredit and applying it towards a NEC 4FG. I love this monitor!\n\n  So, I'm glad there is some good news Gateway stories and I'm glad it\nwas me. (Now if it just KEEPS working). :-)\n\n\n					John
I think it all depends on your motherboard and the cards you have in your system.  Your HD stopped boot probably because your HD controller can't handle the faster BUS speed.  I have a 486-33DX, I set my bus divider to CLK/2.5, that is close to 13MHz.  I can gain singificant performace increase on my Video card and harddisk transfer rate when I boost the bus speed.  And my system work flawlessly under this setting.  And you know what, when I go to CLK/2(17MHz BUS), my HD refuse to boot.  \n\nJust my 2 cent.
... deletions...\n same as the pattern if no sim was in place.  This leads me to believe\n\n\nMany motherboards have jumpers to enable/disable the memory banks.  Did you \ncheck that out?
Hi all,\n \n    I'm looking for some info regarding an old pcmade by Otronics (or\nmaybe Oltronics) called the Attache.  This little beauty is an 8088\n/ Z80 luggable with a 4 or 5 inch screen (monochrome CGA) and 2 360\nfloppies.  \n    For serial ports it has 2 DB-15 connectors (one is labled 'printer')\nand I can't figure out the pinouts for them.  I also don't know if they \nare standard com ports addressable as COM1 and COM2.  I have figured out \nthat they'll only work with DOS 2.something.  \n    \n    If anyone can give me some pointers on this one, I'd be most \nappreciative.  Please reply via email, as I can't keep up with news \nlately.  (Finals are coming up you know :( )

The only thing I know is that\nis normally used with Compaq-machines.\nPlease, send me information on switch-settings, geometry and so on.\nIt looks like a normal IDE-disk but is it possible to use it with a standard IDE-controller??\n\n-- Michael
I would realy like to hear from someone that has one of these NANAO T560i\nmonitors that is driving it with a Diamond SpeedStar 24x. With the 24x\nset up to run at its 58.1 khz 72.0hz output mode, and realy driving the\nhell out of the monitor. Just woundering if the NANAO T560i would fall\napart with poor low capabilities like my (3) Sony 1604s did with the 24x\ndriving their balls off...Sam

Hi All COMPAQ owners\n\nA friend of mine has COMPAQ (PORTABLE III), and he has lost all the manuals and\ndiskettes.\n\nPlease HELP him getting the machine's equipment definition (CMOS) memory\nconfiguration right. The machine says that some bytes of it are still \nincorrectly set up. It seems, that COMPAQ has some bytes defined not like\nthe 100% IBM compatible machines. If You have a COMPAQ, it\ncertainly has DIAGNOSTICs diskette with it. And this is needed. I can't\nreach quickly any COMPAQ dealers here.\n\nIf it is possible PLEASE email documentation, or some of its configuration\nsoftware.
B(>i am interested in getting the pulse of this group regarding\nB(>extended operation of my G2K 486-33V with the cover removed\nB(>from the enclosure.  there are a # of reasons i am considering\nB(>this, including quick access to jumpers during complex i/o card\nB(>setups.\n\nB(>my concern is that without a complete enclosure to direct the\nB(>cooling flow of air from the fan, "hot spots" may develop on my\nB(>motherboard or elsewhere.\n\nIf you have an adequate supply of air moving over the system (most\noffices or homes have positive ventilation) you can generally run a\nsystem without the cover for extended periods without a problem. (I'm\ntalking about completely removing the cover - not just leaving the slots\nuncovered.) HOWEVER, the biggest reason you have a cover to begin with\nis RF sheilding. Operating a system without the full cover may create\nproblems with other equipment such as your neighbor's TV or Ham radio\nstation - very much a no-no in the eyes of the law.\n\n\n * SLMR 2.1a * Remember - They're only tools, not a way of life!
: Most, if not all, credit card companies offer to double the warranty up\n: to one year, namely, if you make a purchase by a credit card, you get\n: additional warranty up to one year. Does it apply to the purchase of\n: computers? I wonder if anyone out there has used it. Is there any catch?\n: Thanks in advance.\n\nI am just about to post the results of my big computer purchase.  One\nof the key points was the ability to use my American Express card.  I \nread the fine print between double warranty policies of Amex and Citibank\nVISA.  Sure, both will allow you double warranty on computers, but Citibank\nhas a maximum claim of $250.00.  Could you imagine trying to get your\nmonitor or mother board fixed for $250.00?  Amex has NO limit on claims.\n\nRemember, if you use Amex, you must either send a copy of the warranty info\nto them in 30 days from purchase, or you must call them to pre-register and\nthen send them the paperwork within 90 days of purchase (my pre-register\npak arrived today).  Citibank VISA requires no pre-registration.
] Hi there,\n] \n] \n] : 	I have 1s/1p/1g  I/O card in my 386/40 PC. \n] : When I plug in wang modem at com4,it works. If I change\n] : it to com1- it doesn't. \n] : Program "chkport" gives diagnostics like "possible com /irq\n] : conflict at com1" (with mouse driver in memory).\n] \n] Since your IO-card only has one serial port - this should default to COM1 ? \n] Under MS-DOS, you can't share IRQ's - so you'll have to set either your modem\n] or your mouse to COM2 ... using different adresses and IRQ's.\n] When you set two 'devices' onto the same IRQ - like COM1 and COM3 (or 2 and 4)\n] - the 'latter' one will always win, i.e. if you have your mouse on COM1 and\n] start using your modem on COM3, your modem should work - but your mouse will\n] stop doing so, until reboot.\n] \n] It should be no problem, setting your modem to COM2 ? (you didn't write \n] anything about other peripherals ...)\n] \n] I hope, it helped a bit ....					By(t)e, Oli.\n] \n] \n\nHi,\n\nI'm kind of new at the pc stuff.  My machine has 4 serial ports.

Facts:\n=====\n- A Netware Server 286A was roughly moved to a new location and left powered\ndown for three months.\n- From memory it has an 80 MB hard drive.\n- Manuals and original disks are for SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a\n- When powered up, the CMOS was wiped. A technician examined it and \npronounced the disk drive unusable.\n\nMy investigations indicate that drive C is a type 27 (1024 cylinders, 9 sides).\nWhen CMOS set this way, COMPSURF runs happily, with 13 bad blocks.\n\nI use PREPARE to Hotfix the one internal drive.\n\nInstall will proceed "successfully", but when I try to boot the server, it\nreports that the software is not serialised for this hardware.\n\nInternal examination indicates that the keycard is present, and there is one\ndisk drive (or at least one large single unit). \n\nAttempts to configure a second drive in CMOS result in drive not ready\nerrors.\n\nQuestions:\n=========\nThe software is Netware 286 Level II and I can see burnt on to the screen\nSFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a. However, to configure netware for level II\n(mirrored or duplexed disks) requires a second disk, yes? \n\nSo how is the Novell Server 286A normally configured?\n\n1. Can I install SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a as Level I, or is this what\nis causing my serialisation error?\n2. Is the Novell Server 286A normally equipped with two hard drives, one of\nwhich has failed?\n3. Would this mean I can not install the network software because it will not\nbe serialised for this hardware with a failed drive?\n4. What else can cause a serialisation error?\n5. What happens if the keycard fails?\n6. Am I doing something wrong? Can someone knowledgeable offer some comments\nand guides.\n\nThanks for your time.\n\nApology:\n=======\nI appreciate that I have posted this request somewhat widely. As I'm\ndealing with somewhat archaic hardware and software I'm hoping that by casting\nmy net further, I'm more likely to capture someone who has met this system\nbefore. I believe I can justify the groups to which I am posting. Please\nfeel free to correct me if you feel this is an inappropriate place to post\nthis.
I just talked to a rep for my AT&T mastercard regarding this:  There is no\nmaximum claim, and you only have to notify them of the warranty when the \nitem needs repair.  If it can't be repaired, you get the amount you paid\nfor it.\nCuriously though, the AT&T Gold mastercard has a limit of $1000 on claims.\nDefinitely not upgrading to that card...:)\n\n-Bryan
I have a 5 1/4" drive as drive A.  How can I make the system boot from\nmy 3 1/2" B drive?  (Optimally, the computer would be able to boot\nfrom either A or B, checking them in order for a bootable disk.  But\nif I have to switch cables around and simply switch the drives so that\nit can't boot 5 1/4" disks, that's OK.  Also, boot_b won't do the trick\nfor me.)\n\nThanks,\n  Davebo

You are correct!  The motherboard manufacturer where I usually buy boards says\nthat they will have this problem fixed in about two weeks...
This chip would take 25ns to return valid data after being issued an address.\n\nRefresh time (none for SRAM, as you pointed out) is a different parameter,\nand is not generally referred to except by motherboard designers.

Hi. I recently switched my old Amiga 500 with a 486DX-50.

Is that good ? I thought\nthat with EISA I could get about 2MB/sec. \nSomewhere in the manual for my harddisk I have read, that some host \nadapters need to perform a low-level format to optimize the harddisk \nperformance in that system, do I need that ?\nA guy I know, gets a HD transfer about 1.2MB/sec, and he has an ST3283A and\na ISA 486DX-50, how can a ISA with the same system be faster ?\n\nIs there anything that I can do to get a speedier harddisk ?\n\n\n                                        Thanks.\n\nphantom@diku.dk   (e-mail is preffered)

Does it do it to all tapes?  Were the two tapes that it unwound of the same\ntype from the same batch?  The reason I ask is that I bought some generic tapes\nthat did this and found that the tape markers were not fully punched out and\nhad closed the little marker hole.  It was only on a few tapes of a set.\n\nDid you open up the tape cartridge and put the tape back on the reels?\n\nIf you have not yet, open it up by removing the two screws on the bottom of\nthe tape cartridge and snap the plastic shell away from the metal base.  \nAs you are pulling the tape through the assembly try not to touch any more \nthan you have to.  As you are doing it, look for a couple of little holes in \nthe tape.  These are the marker holes which let the tape drive know when it is \nat the end of the tape.  The holes are spaced a couple of inches apart.  My best\nguess is that the drive finds the first marker and then stops on the second\nmarker?  \n\nAnyhow, If the tape has the holes, then check to see if the mirror on the tape\nis clean.  The function of the mirror is to detect the marker holes.  The\ntape drive shines a light at the mirror and has a pickup in the area where\nthe reflection would come out.  When the hole goes by, the pickup detects the \nlight that was allowed to pass and it knows when to stop.  If the mirror is dirty\nor out of alighment (unlikely since it is made into the case) you might have\na problem detecting the end of the tape.\n\nIf the tape drive does it on all tapes and the tapes all look good, then either\nthe pickup or the LED of the sensor system has failed or is dirty.  If you open\nthe drive door you will see the sensor assembly to the left of the R/W head\nassembly.  If it looks clean and nothing is in its way, then the drive may\nneed to be serviced.  It is possible that the LED is burned out or the sensor\nis out. \n\nIf it is still in warranty, you might be able to send it back to CMS for\nrepair.\n\n\n---\nScott Hiles\nwhiles@relay.nswc.navy.mil

If you only do read/print then there is no reason for the joystick stuff\nnot to take 90% of the time even if it is efficient.\n\n\nThe truth is that int 15H joystick reading IS slow. I read it directly\nfrom the hardware port. Note that doing so exposes you to intermittent\ndisturbance from interrupts, so you may want to read (say) twice in a\nrow and keep the lower results. Don't just turn interrupts off, it may\nprove detrimental to the health of any high speed comms and other\ndevices.\n\nHere is an example of how to do this:\n\n/* ------------------------------ joy.c ------------------------------------- */\n\n/* An example of how to read PC joystick port by polling the hardware port\n * directly.\n * Uses inp()/outp() for byte port access.\n * Will timeout when 'int count=0' counts up to zero.\n * This sample reads one port (A is presented and B is in the comments).\n * You can read both at once by merging the two, but it will time out\n * when either joystick is not connected.\n *\n * There is no need to optimize this routine since it runs for as long as\n * the joystick circuitry needs.\n *\n * Written by Eyal Lebedinsky (eyal@ise.canberra.edu.au).\n*/\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <conio.h>\n\nextern int readjoy (int *x, int *y, int *b1, int *b2);\n\n#define JOYPORT	0x201\n\n#define	XJOY	0x01	/* for joystick B use 0x04 */\n#define	YJOY	0x02	/* for joystick B use 0x08 */\n#define XYMASK	(XJOY|YJOY)\n#define	BUT1	0x10	/* for joystick B use 0x40 */\n#define	BUT2	0x20	/* for joystick B use 0x80 */\n\nint					/* returns 0 if ok */\nreadjoy (int *x, int *y, int *b1, int *b2)\n{\n	register int	count;\n	register char	temp, joy;\n\n	temp = (char)XYMASK;\n	count = 0;\n	outp (JOYPORT, 0);		/* set trigger */\n	do {\n		temp ^= (joy = (char)inp (JOYPORT));\n		if (temp & XJOY)\n			*x = count;\n		if (temp & YJOY)\n			*y = count;\n	} while (++count && ((temp = joy) & XYMASK));\n	*b1 = !(joy & BUT1);\n	*b2 = !(joy & BUT2);\n\n	return (!count);\n}\n\n/* This main() is for demonstration.\n*/\n\nint\nmain ()\n{\n	int	rc, x, y, b1, b2;
Once in a while you have to put in a good word for something that works\nwell.  I have had no problems with my Toshiba 3401.  It works very well with\nDOS and OS/2.  For OS/2, you don't need to load any special drivers.  The\ninstallation will detect that it is a Toshiba drive and you are done.\n\nBTW, it's also very fast!

Computers are a special case.. and it's a pretty good idea to\n leave them on.. cuz everytime you turn on a computer, you're \n putting a surge of electricity through its delicate components.\n  Imagine you're turning on your computer 5 or more times a day.\n You're increasing the chances of damaging the chips, memory,\n etc on all the components of your computer. So you may save\n a few cents here and there in electricity bills, but it won't\n look like much when it come time to fix your computer.
I purchased a Super Voyager VLB 33Mhz board from Washburn & Company a month ago.\nI don't have the mailing address-- Clyde Washburn advertises regularly in PC Week.  He can also be reached via CompuServe.    The phone number is    \n1-800-836-8027.\n\nI think Washburn has very competitive prices compared to other AMI distributers,plus I liked  the fact he's a EE that knows what he's talking about\nconcerning hardware, and he can be easily reached via CompuServe for non  \ncritcle questions, and is very informative to his customers over the phone.
I just picked up a second-hand "color option" for the NEC P5200\n24pin dot matrix printer.  Alas, there were no installation instructions,\nso I am totally confused on WHY it WON'T GO IN!\n\nDo I have to remove the actaual print head?  It seems *almost* to fit,\nbut not quite.\n\nPlease... any info would be most appreciated!
XGA or XGA-2?  For the original XGA you just need something that can do\n1024x768 at 45/90Hz interlaced (just tell them "8514 compatible" and they\nshould get the idea).  For the XGA-2, get what you like.  I prefer multi-\nsyncs like the IBM 6319, the NECs or even a fixed frequency monitor like\nmy home Viewsonic 6.  I like the Multisyncs because it's easy to run them\nin modes like 800x600x64k colors noninterlaced, or at higher modes like\n1360x1024x16.

I was recently loaned an older Dec 210 286 at work, and I have the option\nof adding an additional Western Digital Hard-drive to the machine.  The\nexisting drive is currently a Western Digital as well, and is working fine,\nbut I do not have any documentation available for configuring the master/slave\nrelationship necessary for a c: d: drive setup.\n\nThe first drive is currently formatted to Tandy Dos v3.3 but I am eventually\ngoing to upgrade both to MS Dos v 5.0\n\nThe drives themselves are both model number WD95044-A circa 5-07-1991\nThey are 782 cyl 4 head drives.  A note to add is that there is no exact\nconfiguration for these in my current bios, but it seems to work at a\nsetting 17 (977 cyl 5 head, 300 write_pre, 977 landing zone).\nThere are three pairs of jumper pins on the back that I presume are\nfor setting up the master/slave.  Originally, the drive in the machine\nhad none.  Currently, I was suggested to try the far right (looking at the\nback) for master and the middle jumper for the slave.\n\nWhen booted, the reinitialize seems to puke accessing the d: drive.  It does\nflicker about three times on the second drive, but then gives the error.  \nHopefully the problem is as simple as the drive not being formatted, but not\nbeing a person who has ever had to actual format and unformatted drive, I\nwould not even know how to do that.\n\nAny and all help on this is great fully appreciated.  If not, a number\nfor Western Digital might just do as good!\n\nswood

I believe you are right.  Both SCSI and SCSI-2 support 8 devices on the bus\n(normally that would be the host controller and 7 targets) each of which\nmay have up to 8 logical units (LUNs).
How can one tell which prong of your basic chip is number 20?  I realize there\nis a chunk of the chip missing so that one can orient it correctly.  So \nusing that hole as a guide, how can I count the prongs of the chip to find\n#20?  Please help.
thought I'd post this as well as e-mail it, just in case anyone else is\ninterested in this info.....\n\n\n\n\nI suggest that you go direct to the original (and preferred...best quality)\nsource for all of this, just as you would (at least, should) for the chips\nthemselves:  National Semiconductor.  you can reach them at 1-800-272-9959.\nthey no longer package the data sheets in a book, as they did when I got\nmine, but you can get them as individual sets of data sheets.  you want, as\na minimum, the following:\n\n   *) 2 sets of data sheets:\n      *) NS16450/INS8250A/NS16C450/INS82C50A\n      *) NS16550AF\n\n   *) 2 application notes (yes, GET THESE!):\n      *) AN-491 The NS16550A: UART Design and Application Considerations\n      *) AN-493 A Comparison of the INS8250, NS16450 and NS16550AF Series\n         of UARTs\n\nboth of the application notes I listed have proven to be AT LEAST as\nvaluable as the data sheets themselves (more, actually).

Hello, \nI have a Hayes 9600 moden with no cables or manuals.  The\nmodem requires a source of 14V AC, but I do not know how\nto connect the power source to the 3 pin connector.

I started a similar thread about a month ago, and got many replies.\nThe summary:\n\nCTX 14": Nasty, low quality. Avoid.\n\nCTX 15" Proscan: Not as good as some other makes; however, cheap.\n  Main problem seems poor quality control. Some reported pincushioning\n  (the problem I had), others poor focus, etc, etc.\n\nI complained about mine and it was 're-tuned' (I dodn't even pay\nshipping) and returned to me in 2 days. \n\nIt's now clear, well-focussed and has no pincushioning or barrel\ndistortion at all. I'm very happy with it, and the digital\ncontrols and mode memory are nice. Certainly, a Trinitron\n(say) would be much nicer, but that's well out of my price range.\n\nConclusion: If you're on a budget, get one and be prepared to\nsend it back if it's not perfect. It probably won't be when you get it,\nbut has good potential.
[deleted]\n\nI'm sorry if I'm misunderstanding your post, but DRAM *does not* have to\nbe refreshed on *each access cycle*.  So cycle time does *not* have to be\ntwice the access time *because of refresh phase*.\n\nThe access time usually means the delay time from falling edge of raw\naddress strobe (RAS) to data bus driven.\n\nDRAM access cycle timing chart can be roughly shown as following (some\nsignals are intentionally omitted);\n\nADDR --<RA><CA>-------<RA><CA>--------- RA=Raw Address, CA=Column Address\nRAS  ~~~~\________/~~~~~\________/~~~~~		~=High, _=Low, -=Floating\nCAS  ~~~~~~~\_______/~~~~~~\_______/~~~		<..>=driven either H or L\nDATA ---------<VALID>--------<VALID>---\n         |-------+------|\n         |-+--|  |\n           |     +----------- cycle time\n           +---- access time (or RAS access time)\n\nYes, the cycle time is more than twice as the access time but *not*\nbecause of the refresh phase.  The refresh can be done either as a\ntrailing phase of normal access cycle or as an individual cycle.\n\n[other stuff deleted]\n\nKen Nakata
OK..... thanks to all of you who responded to my post.\nhere's the "official" response from orchid..\nOrchid is aware of the problem, the new rev of the board (rev d) SHOULD         (not would) take care of the problem. production was scheduled to start\non april 15, I have no confirmation that production did start on this day\njust the word of the tech on the other line.\n\nnow the flame......\nyou would think a company like Orchid who has produced good quality products in the past would be more helpfull and willing to make right on a screwup of theirs. \nvery poor tech support (the first 2 times I called I must have spoke with the\njanitor because they where talking craziness) the last time I talked to a tech  named "paul" and he seemed to have a pretty good idea what was going on.\nuntil these problems are resovled neither myself nor my department will buy\nor recommend orchid products.\n\nflame off.....\n\nagain thanks to all of you who answered my post.

Hi Netters,\n\nAs promised, here are the summary of opinions on DoubleDisk Gold v.6.0.\nPeople seem to be quite happy with the product. There is no much of\nopinion on how good it is compared to the industry leader Stacker 3.0.\n(Superstor Pro is not considered since it is slower than Stacker although\njust as reliable - BYTE Magazine's conclusion ;-) ), so it's hard to make\nany decision to go with Stacker or with DoubleDisk Gold v6.0. \nHowever, it seems that at $39.95, it is quite a buy.\n\nBuddy Christyono\nbuddy@optics.ece.wisc.edu\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nsummary of replies\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHello Buddy,\n\nI do not have DD Gold 6.0 experience.  I just ordered it.  I currently have\nDD 2.3 (the last version).  I am very pleased with its performance.\n\nHere is my suggestion...\n\n1)  If you do not have any compression software currently, I would go with\n	DOS 6.0's compression.  All the discussion on the net indicates that\n	for $50 you get the compression (built into the OS), plus the other\n	utilities that you would pay way more than $50 for.  Besides, you \n	are now at DOS6.0 (whatever that means...)\n\n2)  If you have DoubleDisk 2.3 already (like I do), the cost is $29.95\n	for the upgrade.  After thinking about it and asking the net, I\n	decided that I could not go wrong with the update cost!\n	I have never suffered from performance of DD.  I have a 12ms HD with\n	large SW packages in both compressed and uncompressed format.  It\n	works great.  Not delays.  I think the "A" is better than "B" \n	arguements are a lot of bunk... they are all comparable in performance.\n	I am looking forward to being able to "LOADHIGH" the DD sw.  That\n	has been an annoyance.\n\n3)  If you have Stacker, et.al. currently, I would not see it worth the\n	effort to upgrade.\n\nJust my $.02 ...\n\nRegards,\nMark Bagdy\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nBuddy,\n\nI got the same mailer. About 2 weeks ago I got DDG and installed it. The\ndocumentation was, in my opinion, easy to follow. I used the automatic\ninstallation (not the custom) and everything went smoothly.\n\nThere were some specific instructions on a readme file for dealing with 386max\n& QEMM. DDG has an uninstall (unlike DOS6.0) if you need it. My system has a\n203Mb hard drive. before installing DDG I had ~5Mb free. After DDG I had\n~197Mb free. Pretty good statistics considering that my 8Mb permanent windows\nswap file stayed on the uncompressed portion (along with other drivers and\nsuch).\n\nI have had no problems whatsoever. I have noticed no slowdown (other than it\ntakes a little longer to boot) either in windows or dos. So far I am a very\nhappy camper.\n\n-Bruce\n-- \n  Bruce F.

It was very easy to install.\nThe only problem I had was with Castle Wolfenstein 3-D.  I assumed the game\nwas trying to bypass DOS disk access and moved the game to the non-compressed\nregion of the disk.  Since then the game has never given me a problem. \nThere was never any damage to the DoubleDisk drive.\n	Compression performance for the whole disk has held steady \naround 1.8:1.  This is lower than expected but about 20% (size) of my files \nare compressed image files and some large zip files.  \n\nIf you have any more specific questions let me know.\nDan\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI bought it an have been happy with it.  I use it on both MFM and IDE 40\nMB drives.  I was using DoubleDisk before Gold came out.  That is the\nsame product MSDOS 6.0 is shipping with.  No problems with either\nproduct.
Hi there.  We just bought a 486 DX2/66 Gateway system with a 2 meg ATI\nUltra Pro video card.  Everything seems to work fine except for the\nWindows Drivers for 800x600 24 bit, and 800x600 and 1024x768 16 bit\nmodes.  The fonts and icons start deteriorating after windows startup,\nand within minutes of use, everything on the screen is totally\nunintelligible.  Naturally, I called Gateway tech support to inquire\nabout this.  The technician asked me about the drivers, and I told him it\nwas version 1.5, build 59.  He told me that the 16 and 24 bit drivers for\nthe ATI Ultra Pro simply do not work!!!  Is this true?  If so, I'm simply\namazed.  How could this be?  The strange thing is I would have expected\nto see some discussion on here (unless the subject has made the FAQ!!!).\n\nOne very suspicious point that came up later was that he stated that none\nof the Windows Accelerator boards have working 16 and/or 24 bit drivers\nfor Windows 3.1.  I easily challenged him on that because I've been\nrunning a Diamond 24x in 15 bit mode at home for 4 months now, and I have\n"Well, Diamond has been working on those drivers much longer."  Anyway, I\njust wanted to see if anyone else had any trouble and what they did about\nit.  Any feedback will be appreciated.\n\nThe system configuration is:\n\nGateway 486 DX2/66 Local Bus\n16 Megs Ram\nSCSI HD & CD-ROM\nUltrastor 34F Local Bus SCSI controller\nATI Ultra Pro Local Bus with 2MB VRAM\nDOS 6.0\nWindows 3.1\nMach 32 drivers version 1.5 (build 59)\n\nThanks in advance.
The last I heard, the author was having some problems in his immediate\nfamily and had delayed the continuation of development for a time.\nThis was some months ago.\n\nIt's a shame.  The driver is the best memory manager I have found\nANYWHERE.  It doesn't require V8086 mode (like QEMM) so it works with\nUltima 7.  It doesn't take ANY memory (runs, then exits).\n\nIf only the EMM provider were a little faster and more stable.\n\n\n--\ntmcreek@eos.ncsu.edu       \   These views respresent no one.   /   Now you\ncreek-tm@aza.csc.ncsu.edu   \   Even I won't claim them.       /   are here

Since the Mac uses ONLY SCSI-1 for hard drives YES the "figure includes a\nhundred $$$ for SCSI drivers"  This is sloppy people and DUMB.\n\nOk once again with the SCSI spec list:\nSCSI-1 {with a SCSI-1 controler chip} synchronous range is indeed 0-5MB/s\n asynchronous range is slower at 0-3MB/s.\nSCSI-1 {With a SCSI-2 controller chip}: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}\n Note the INCREASE in SPEED, the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI-1\n so it DOES exist. Some PCs use this set up too.\n\nSCSI-2 {8-bit/SCSI-1 mode}:          4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst\n{for those who want SCSI-2 but don't want to pay for the 16-bit or 32-bit\n hardware or mess with the SCSI-2 software controllers.  Usable by SCSI-1\n devices with close to 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds}\nSCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst\nSCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst\n\nOn the other interfaces let DXB132@psuvm.psu.edu speak:\nAgain synchronous and asynchronous modes with asynchronous much slower\n {Range 0-5MB/s}\n\nOne problem is the inconsitant use of the term 'SCSI' in articles and by\npeople.  Its PROPER meaning is "The set of SCSI interfaces composed of\nSCSI-1 AND SCSI-2"\nLook at the inconsitant use of SCSI in the below quote:\n(My comments in {})\n\nPC Magazine April 27, 1993:29 "Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI,\n{This is asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip} 20% faster than IDE..."\n{this is BOTH asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip AND 8-bit SCSI-2}\nTo read CONSITANTLY the quote SHOULD read:\n{asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip}\n"Although asynchronous SCSI-1 is twice as fast as ESDI, one third the \nspeed of IDE..."\nor {asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip or 8-bit SCSI-2}\n"Although SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip and 8-bit SCSI-2 are eight times as fast as\nESDI, 20% faster than IDE..."\n\nNOTE the NONUSE of 'SCSI' by itself.  This eliminates ambaguity.\n\nSCSI-1 drivers are somewhat reasonable while 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 drivers \nare VERY expansive {8-bit SCSI-2 can use SCSI-1 drivers with little speed\ndegridation(the Mac Quadra does EXACTLY this.)}

Hi, all hardware netters,\n\n  I've seen recently on some magazines advertising a ?NEW? Trident\ngraphics card call 8900CL. The ad said it's new and *faster*. How is it\ncompare to Tseng ET4000?

I recently purchased the then current Pkg.# 486dx-33 for $2395 (but changed\nto NEC 3FGx monitor upgrade). Buy this Pkg. #3 now - for $100 more, you now\nget a bigger HD - 340mb with @256 HD cache. 30 days ago, when I bought this\npkg., it was 245mb with @132K HD cache. This is a great deal although it is\ngenerally recommended you at least upgrade to the 15' Zeos (CTX) monitor for\n$99 more I believe.  Whether you also upgrade to the Diamond Viper video\ncard is your choice. I stayed with the Diamond Speedstar Pro. Zeos Tech\nSupport is really good - call after normal business hours to get the \nfastest access. The hardest part about buying a Zeos is the wait till it is\ndelivered - once you order you can hardly wait to get it! There are quite a\nfew good mail order houses around - lots of bang for buck with Zeos.
I am looking for information about this drive.  Switch settings, geometry..etc.\n\nConner CP3204F\n\nPlease reply via e-mail.  Many thanks in advance!
I think the original respondent (Guy Dawson?) was refering to something\nmuch more elementary.\n\nEvery partition (whether it is the entire disk or not) has two FATs and\nan initial directory.\n\nIf you have a small disk (50 meg or less), I would recommend that it remain\na single partition. Unless you have some other consideration.\n\nIf you have a large disk (greater than 200 meg), multiple partitions can\nmake sense.

I have a 486DX33 ISA system with 4 meg.  I am using a Diamond Speedstar HiColor\nvideo card with 1 meg VRAM and a standard CTX 14-in SVGA monitor.  When I am\nrunning Windows, and I have overlapping windows (say an application overlapping\nthe program manager window), and I close the active application, window erasure\nis very slow.  The part of the window that is not overlapping is erased first,\nvery slowly.  This also happens when I iconify an application.\n\nThe HiColor card is advertised as a faster-than-standard video card, but it\ndoes not have an accelerator chip on it.  I am running at 800x600x32k.  Is this\nslow speed simply to be expected without an accelerator chip, or is there\nsomething else that is bottlenecking the system that I am unaware of?\n\nThanks.

Fellow netters,\n\nI'm in the market for a hand scanner.  However, I don't know anyone who has\none.  I have my eye on two choices.\n\nDexxa:  This scanner is available at Wal-Mart for $90.  It includes GrayWorks\nsoftware and provides 400 dpi and 32 grayscales (I think).  The OCR software\nCatchword is available through mail-order for about $90 also.\n\nMustek:  (Gray Artist for Windows)  This scanner offers 256 grayscales\n(according to Cad & Graphics) and 800 dpi.  It is available for $169\nmail-order and comes with Perceive OCR and Picture Publisher LE.\n\nI am also looking at a Genius hand scanner (B105) from Cad & Graphics.  It\nis basically the same as the Mustek scanner except for the resolution (400\ndpi) and price ($149).  \n\nBasically, I would like recommendations on which to buy.  I have heard that\nLogitech makes the best and manufactures Dexxa scanners.  But which one is the\nbest buy?  Would 800 dpi really be helpful (output would be no better than HP\nLaserJet III or Canon BJ-200 - 300x300 to 360x360)?  I am leaning toward the\nMustek because it offers the most features and is in the middle in terms of\nprices.  Which should I buy?\n\nIf you have a hand scanner, please let me know whether or not you would\nrecommend it.  Also, if you know of another scanner within the price range\n(under $225) that would be a better deal, please E-Mail me.  Any and all help\nwould be greatly appreciated.

I have a 486sx25 computer with a 105 Mg Seagate IDE drive and a controler  \nbuilt into the motherboard. I want to add a SCSI drive (a quantum prodrive  \n425F 425 MG formatted). I have no documentation at all and I need your  \nhelp!\n\nAs I understand it, here is the process of adding such a drive.  Could you  \nplease tell me if I'm right..\n\n1- Buy a SCSI contoler.  Which one? I know Adaptec is good, but they are  \nkind of expensive.  Are there any good boards in the $100 region? I want  \nit to be compatible with OS2 and Unix if possible.  Also, I have seen on  \nthe net that there are SCSI and SCSI2 drives. Is this true? Does the  \nadapter need to be the same as the drive? What type of drive is the  \nquantum?\n\n2- connect the drive to the adapter via a SCSI cable and the power cable.\nDo i have to worry about the power supply? I think I have 200 watts and  \nall I'm powering are two floppies and the seagate drive.\n\n3- Setup the BIOS to recognize the drive as the second drive.  What type  \nof drive is this? I don't have the numbers for this drive.\n\n4- Format and create partitions on the drive. Do I use format or fdisk? I  \nthink that IDE drives can't be low-level formatted. Is it the same with  \nSCSI? How exactly does fdisk work? I have a reduced msdos 5.0 manual  \n(clone obliges) and there is no mention of fdisk.  Ideally, I would want  \nthe drive partitioned in to two partitions D: and E: how do I do this?\n\nWell that seems to be all. Is there anythiing I'm forgetting? \nAny help is *really* appreciated, I'm lost...\n\n-Eric

HELP!  I really got ripped off and I need some help unripping myself.\n\nI bought a Maxtor 4380 300mb ESDI HDD from Hi-Tech for $300, then paid to\nget it repaired, for about another $300.

No, VL-bus IDE is no faster than ISA IDE.  The IDE interface is\nfundamentally nothing more than an extension of the ISA bus, and if\nyou hook it to VL-bus it'll work as fast as the slower of the two,\nmeaning ISA speed.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I wouldn't expect it to be *slower*...

No, but some OS's ( COHERENT , etc ) are able to drive one of the ports in\npolled mode without using the IRQ. In your example, after accessing the\nmodem, the mouse won't work until you reboot, because the IRQ is used by\nthe modem.\n\n\nYes, you can change the IRQ's for com3/4, but it depends on your other\nhardware. com1 uses IRQ4, com2 IRQ3.  If you have only one printerport \n( IRQ7 ), you can change com3 to IRQ5 ( normally 2nd printer ). For com4,\nyou can assign IRQ2, if its free. As far as I know, no other IRQ can be\nused until your I/O-card is 16bit and caould access IRQ's > 8.\n\nMichael

I recently bought an AMD 386/40.  The motherboard booklet says\nthe board is a "391 WB/H."  I have 4 1x3 simms on board.  The machine\nalso uses a Super IDE I/O Card (model PT-604). (of course niether\nthe motherboard or the I/O card booklet clearly state who the manufacurers\nare) I'm also using a Trident 8900C SVGA card.\n\n	Anyway, that's all of the pertinent info I can think of.\nMy problem is that the computer often freezes or displays "Parity Error --\nSystem Halted" messages depending on whether I set the Memory Parity Error\nChecking to "disabled" or "enabled" in the setup of the bios (makes sense).\nIts AMI bios (so it must be an AMI board?).\n\n	I just took it back to the dealer and they replaced all of the\nSIMMS but I keep getting the same error (more frequently now).  It all\nworked at the dealer and didn't start screwing up 'till I got home (figures).\n\n	I've tried to take out all of the SIMMS and even re-inserted them\nin reverse order, making sure that the connections were solid.\n\n	My suspicion jumps to this damn all in one HD controller/serial/\nparallel/game-port I/O card, or to the motherboard (God forbid).\n\n	CAN ANYONE HELP?
Well, it all depends on the motherboard implimentation.\n\nI'm sure someone will make a vlb motherboard that takes 1x9\nsimms and uses a pentium processor.  I'm also sure that there \nwill be some motherboards that won't.
This past winter I found myself spending a ridiculous amout of time in front\nof my computer.  Since my eyes were going berserk, I decided to shell out\nsome serious money to upgrade from a 14" to a 17" monitor.  I'm running\n800x600 at 72 Hz.  My eyes are very grateful.  However, I find myself using\na smaller font with less eye strain.  Has anyone else had this kind of \nexperience?  I thought that small fonts were the culprit but it seems that\nflicker was my real problem.  Any comments?
You realize, of course, that inevitably some anal retentive moron is\ngoing to come along and wag his fingers and his jowls in outrage that\npersonal politics are more important than [SMCAP][BOLD][Font:God\n999pt.]The Law[smcap][bold][font].\n\nBut that's irrelevant to the problem here.  Windows came with my\nsystem, but on 5.25" disks.  I hate using 5.25" disks, so I copied\nthem over to high density 3.5"'s using xcopy.  It worked fine.  In\nfact, for a while I was changing configurations and whatnot so much\nthat I decided to try putting them on the hard disk.  Not only can you\ncopy them over with one disk per directory, but if you want to, you\ncan simply copy them all into one directory.  Makes it a lot nicer\nwhen you're switching printer emulations around.\n\nNorton 6.0 I don't have much experience with, but when a friend's\nsystem crashed, we restored from a backup rather than from the\noriginals, and it worked fine.  This would imply that arj a -r norton\nc:\nu would create a workable backup, and if you did a full install\nthe first time, you've got the whole thing.\n\nNever played with WP for Windows; I'm not too big of a fan of anything\nfrom Utah.\n\nGood luck....\n\nDisclaimer: Don't Copy That Floppy!

Yeah.  Sounds typical.  Windows makes all sorts of extra demands on hardware,\nand therefore your machine can't keep up with things.  Ever notice how when\nacessing the floppies in Windows, everything else slows to a crawl?  I \nimagine your backup and evertyhing else that is running fights for CPU time,\nand sometimes the backup program loses.  Be glad.  I can't even run in \nmedium speed with CP backup on my machine, supposedly because I have a SCSI\nmachine which places extra demands on the data bus.
Eric, send me your email address, I lost it! I've reconsidered!
While others here may have had better experiences, I, too, share the\nsentiments posted above.  Though I have the original Stealth/VRAM,\nit is only "relatively" recent that the Windows drivers for this card\nhave evolved to a point of decent performance.  Note that there are\nSTILL a couple of modes I cannot use (ie. will not) due to shadowing,\nmis-drawn check boxes, etc.  I believe the version I have is 2.01.\nIf there's a more recent release, I'd appreciate if someone would\ndrop me a note to let me know -- I haven't been able to get on their\nBBS lately to check again.  Naturally, Diamond doesn't even bother\nnotifying me of fixes/releases.\n\nDiamond was helpful when I finally reached the "right" person in curing\nsome of my Windows' problems due to an address conflict.  The conflicting\naddresses (2E0, 2E8) were OMITTED in at least my version of the\nDiamond/VRAM manual.  I hope it has been corrected by now.  The tech rep\nexplained that ALL S3-based boards use these addresses.  I have not\nconfirmed the validity of that statement.\n\nWhen I upgrade my motherboard in the near future (hopefully with some\nform of local bus), I'll seek a video solution from someone other than\nDiamond.\n\nLance Hartmann (lance%hartmann.austin.ibm.com@ibmpa.awdpa.ibm.com)\n               Yes, that IS a '%' (percent sign) in my network address.
HI,\n    Recently, when I run the Norton Disk surface test, I realize a slow\ndown in harddisk accessing.  At begining of the test, the harddisk will\nbe checked at the speed that usually is.  As the surface test scaned\nhalf way through my harddisk, a tremendous slow down occured.  The\nexpected time for operation will jump from 3 to 6 minutes.  I try to use\nsome of the harddisk tools to check if there is any physical damage to\nmy harddisk and report always turn out to be none.  The surface test\nonly slow down for a certain section of the disk and turn back to the\noriginal speed after it gets over the section.  I am wondering whether\nit is a harddisk problem or some other problems. Anyway help or comment\nwill be appriciate....\n                                                 Shane Cheney Wang

The best advice I've heard when buying monnitors\nis to actually look at the specific one you will buy (as opposed to model)\nsince monitor manufacturing even from "Big Names" still tends to produce\nalot of monitors with visible defects.\n\n\n                              Rithea Hong\n                       (r0h7630@tamuts.tamu.edu)\nEnd of File, Press RETURN to quit\n\nJust to name two at the top of my list of crap monitor makers are,\nSONY & MAGNAVOX...Sam

Is it possible to connect a atari monochrome monitor to some kind of VGA card?\n\nIf someone have done this please let me know how.\n\n	Thanx
Hi,\nVLB is defined for 3 cards by 33MHz\nand 2 cards by 40MHz\n\nthere are designs with 50MHz and 2 VLB-Slots.\n(s. C't 9.92, 10.92, 11.92)\n\n50MHz and 2 Slots are realy difficult to design.
I'm posting this for a friend that runs a BBS. I'm not sure if its under\nDOS or Windows.\n\nHe is interested in a board that has 16 ports on it. In another post,\nsomeone suggeted a DigiBoard, but didn't have too much info on it.\n\nCould someone give me information on any boards that they know of with\nthe before mentioned configuration. Models. Specifications. Prices.\n Manufacturers.\n\nThanks,\n\nRob\n\n--
Hi!\n\nI think VGA-Copy can do what you need. \nIf you create a new floppy for your a: drive (that is the 5 1/4"), turn on\nthe "modify" switch of vga-copy.\nWhen you boot using this diskette, a message appears:\n\nThis is no system disk, you can\n1) replace disk with another,\n2) boot from Harddisk or\n3) switch drives and reboot (that is, a: becomes b:, b: becomes a:)\nType your choice:\n\nWhen you select the third item, you can boot from b: which is now called a: .\nSeems to work very good, for example booting drdos6 from the installation disks\nin 3.5" format was no problem for a friend of mine (I have only a 3.5" a: drive)\n\nHope that helps\nRobert\n\nP.S.: VGA-Copy is shareware, so it's easy to get. Newest Version seems to be 5.0 .\n\n-- \n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Very possibly, but if it's still going to be backwards compatible\nwith the ISA bus, it's going to be the same tripe that the current EISA\nimplementation really is.\n\n	From what I've seen, the PCI bus will just be a new 32bit 33MHz\nintelligent bus (ie, bus controller takes care of interrupts and the like,\nnot jumpers...)  Hopefully it'll get somewhere up there with the AMIGA \nZorro III bus....\n\n	VL Bus is a bit too much of a hack for my liking...
1. Dont rely on benchmarks. They often show incorrect due to different\n   TSR programs.\n\n2. SCSI often needs a driver to get the speed from the card.\n\n3. Make sure the card is operating in synchronus mode which is 2x faster.\n\n4. You can disable disconnect and get some kB/s but just to loose the mouse\n   or other int`s when diskaccesing.\n\n(I get 2.3MB/s with DX50 LB and SCSI LB and Maxtor LXT340SY - Coretest)\n(I get 1.3MB/s                                              - Sysinfo)
I thought I read that FastMicro was having some financial difficulties,\nis this true?  I can't seem to find the posting about it and was wondering\nif someone can confirm this.
In PC Magazine April 27, 1993:29 "Although SCSI is twice as fasst as ESDI,\n20% faster than IDE, and support up to 7 devices its acceptance ...has\nlong been stalled by incompatability problems and installation headaches."\nnote what it does NOT site as a factor: PRICE.\nint eh same article the PC would will get plug and play SCSI {from the\narticle it seems you get plug and play SCSI-1 only since SCSI-2 in FULL\nimplimentation has TEN NOT 7 devices.}\nSCSI-1 intergration is sited as another part of the MicroSoft Plug and play\nprogram.
: Anyone familiar with this video card?

I have a 486sx/20, 5 megs RAM, 85 meg harddrive (Stacked to 160 w/Stacker\n3.0), 3.5 floppy, 3 expansion slots, 2 drive bays, VGA card, no monitor.\n$650.00 or interesting combination of cash and trade.

I believe that any VL/EISA/ISA motherboard that uses the HINT chipset\nis limited to 24-bit EISA DMA (where 'real' EISA DMA is 32-bit).  The\nHINT EISA DMA has the 16 mb ram addressing limitation of ISA.  For this\nreason I would pass.  I own one of these (HAWK VL/EISA/ISA) and am look-\ning to replace it for exactly this reason.\n\nPlease double-check me on this.  In other words, call the motherboard\nmanufacturer and ask them if the motherboard supports true 32-bit EISA\nDMA.\n\nOther than this limitation, the motherboard works quite well (I am using\nmine with DOS 5, Windows 3.1, and UNIX S5R3.2).  Also with Adaptec 1742a\nEISA SCSI host adapter.
I'm using int15h to read my joystick, and it is hideously slow.  Something\nlike 90% of my CPU time is being spent reading the joystick, and this\nis in a program that does nothing but printf() and JoyRead().\n\nThe problem is that a lot of programs trap int15h ( like SMARTDRV ) and\nso it is a slow as hell interface.  Can I read the joystick port in\na reasonably safe fashion via polling?  And that isn't platform or\nclockspeed specific?\n\nThanks,

After a rough start purchasing a 486 system (see earlier post), I'm trying\nagain.  I'm looking at the following system offered by EPS Technologies:\n\n- 486dx 33mhz w/ 256K static RAM cache,AMI Bios\n- 3 32-bit VESA local bus slots, 3 16-bit slots, 1 8-bit slot\n- Teac 1.2 & 1.44 mb floppy drives\n- Maxtor 170 MB hard drive (15 ms) IDE w/64K cache buffer\n- 32-bit vesa local bus video card w/ 1mb RAM 1024 X 768 NI (I *think* it's an\n   Orchid Fahrenheit 1280 card)\n- 14" NI Multisync monitor 1024 X 768\n- 101 Keyboard\n- 200 Watt power supply\n- Windows 3.1, Mouse, DOS 6.0\n- *3* years limited warranty\n- 1 year on-site service\n\nI'm probably going to add the $125 for a 15" flat-screen digital monitor, and\nwill also want to go for at least 8 mb RAM ($159 extra).\n\nHas anyone bought from EPS Technologies, particularly a system like the one\nI'm considering.  I'm especially interested in their warrantee and service.\nCan anyone recommend other companies who offer similar packages, with support,\nand comparable prices (I see FastMicro just bit it...).\nThanks in advance,
one way to get the system going with one floppy drive and one hard\ndisk on a 63 watt power supply is to first disconnect the power from\nthe floppy drive than turn on the pc, you will notice the hard drive\nhaving a real difficult time getting up to speed, but it manages.\nwhen booting is finished, plug in your floppy drive, now it will work.\n\n(ok I know this is not very user friendly, maybe you are better off\nbuying a 486-66 with 300 watt power supply or something like that)
I know this isn't the EXACT right place to put this, but im desperate!\n\nI'll be going home for the summer, and wont have direct access to my\nVAX account....My problem is, i need a service that doesn't charge body\nparts, vital organs, or my first born son, that allows me access to the\ninternet!  All i really need is to be able to TELNET to my school account,\nand from there I can do anything I need to do.   ANY HELP WILL BE GREATLY\nAPPRECIATED!!!!!!!!!!!
Contrary to what others might have thought, I actually did have a SCSI drive\nonce.  It was the Seagate 296N and the ST-02 controller.  I found that the\ncontroller couldn't keep up with a 1:1 interleave, so the best I could do\nwith the drive was a 2:1 interleave and a data transfer of about 450 k/sec.
The one I got only does about 4kb/s in text and 320x200 (VGA/MCGA) mode,\nwhich is almost identical to the other W5186 based cards (ATI 68800\ndoes about 6kb/s).  This is weird since the Orchid supposedly should\nbe much faster (and I was told by someone that it can do almost 16 kb/s),\nsince the VGA chip is covered by the Orchid label, I can't really tell\nfor sure if it uses a 5286 chip, but the spec. sheet that comes with\nthe board (no docs!) did say it has 1 meg dram and uses a 5286 chip.\nWinmarks (3.11) is about 4 mil. slower than a Viper (34 vs ~38) using\nstandard palette.\n\n  BTW if anyone is insterested, I'm trying to sell a Diamond Viper (2 megs\nvram) for a friend for $300, email if interested (I'm too broke to\ntake it myself).\n\n\n  I think it's available in limited quantites.  No idea of what VGA\nchip it uses though.\n\n  Be very careful with OEM P9000 boards though, the Orchid I got\nfor example only has a readme file on disk that serve as \ndocumentation, and conflicts the hell with my VLB controller \ncard (or maybe it's my motherboard, an A.I.R. 486 VLB)
What 4 or more com port boards are available for PCs?  \nWe want standard com ports, so no need to mention the expensive\ncoprocessed ones.\n\nThey should either be able to share IRQs or be able to use IRQs 8-15.
About two months ago I purchased the Adaptec ASW-410 driver for use with a\nCD-ROM drive.  At the time this seemed the thing to do as the documentation I\nhad with my Adaptec SCSI controller said that this is the driver to be used with\nCD-ROM drives.  Since then I have learn that this driver is out of date in a\nmajor way and that Adaptec have an upgrade deal for going to the next driver\n(I think it's called EZI-SCSI or something).  I wasn't too fussed about this\nuntil I upgraded by CD-ROM drive from a Sony CDU-541 to a Sony CDU-641.  I now\nfind that the audio-mode will not work.  I assume it is not being handled\ncorrectly by the ASW-410 driver.\n\nSo, should I chase Adaptec for an upgrade?  If so does anyone know their\nFAX number?\n\nAny assistance appreciated.\n\nRegards\n\nBTW: everything else works fine, certainly seems that Sony have caught up with\n     the rest with the 641.

A silly question: I frequently edit small files and need to make copies of them\non several floppy diskettes of the same size and format, but my computer is\nonly equipped with one 3.5" HD drive and one 5.25" HD drive; can't I do the\ncopying without swapping files temporarily to my hard disk (which is 99.9% full)\nusing standard MSDOS 5.0 commands?

The JP5 on the Speedstar 24x is for those systems with boot-up problems.\nIf your system fails to boot-up proprtly, please pull off the jumper\nblock from jp5. This will not affect the proformance of the SpeedStar 24x.\n \nThis is what my manual says about jp5. I never knew that it was there\nbut the card is a real ask kicker in my book. It beats the hell out\nof my junk Sony 1604s to the point that I can't even use above 648x480\nmode much...Sam\nSome times an upgrage turns out to be a big overkill, like driving a Sony\nwith a 24x that the monitor can't handle. Or installing 60ns simms and\nthen finding out that your mother board doesn't have a cmos wait state\nadjustment to take advantage of the new 60ns simms that you just bought!
For what it's worth (I haven't confirmed it), a Diamond tech-rep told\nme that ALL S3-based video cards use port addresses 0x2E0 and 0x2E8.\nIf this is true, it appears that you canNOT use more than one S3 card\nin your system.\n\nLance Hartmann (lance%hartmann.austin.ibm.com@ibmpa.awdpa.ibm.com)\n               Yes, that IS a '%' (percent sign) in my network address.

:Because of some contract, IBM is not allowed to sell its\n :486 chips to third parties, so these chips are unlikely to become\n :available in any non-IBM machines. \n\nI saw in this months PC or PC World an ad for computers using IBM's 486SLC.\nSo I don't think IBM is restricted in selling their chips, at least not\nanymore. A clock-tripled 486, even without coprocessor would be great,\nespecially with 16k on-board cache. Make it 386 pin-compatible, and you\nhave the chip upgrade that dreams are made of :-)

Hi!\n\nI recently switched my 3.5" drive to A:. The problem is, while I can read and\nwrite to both the new A: and B: correctly, I can't boot from a floppy in A:.\nI've checked the CMOS settings; it is set for Floppy Seek at Boot and Boot \nOrder A:,C:. \n\nOnce, I had a floppy that did not have the systems files on it in A:. I got a\nmessage telling me to put a disk systems disk in the drive. It didn't work.\nWhen I do have a systems disk in the A: drive, this is what happens:\n1) Power-on and Memory Test;\n2) A: light comes on\n3) B: light comes on, followed by a short beep;\n4) HD light comes on for an instant;\n5) B: light comes on again, then nothing happens\n\nThe light goes off, there is no disk activity of any kind, and the screen \nblanks. I can't even use ctrl-alt-del.\n\nAny suggestions.\n\nThanks in advance.

I never thought I'd contribute to a Gateway thread, either pro or con, but\nmy spleen could use a little venting.  The scenario:\n\n	1 - Ordered a DX2/50 w/ Ultrastor 34F Local Bus HD controller\n	2 - Receive system 10 days after ordering (Happy)\n	3 - Discover Ultrastor 14F ISA HD Controller inside (unhappy)\n	4 - Call Gateway, receive the correct controller in 5 days \n		(getting happier)\n	5 - New controller doesn't work (unhappy again)\n	6 - Call Gateway again, get another controller in 5 more days\n			(cooling off, the end is in sight)\n	7 - This controller doesn't work either, motherboard is bad\n		(VERY unhappy)\n\nGateway's solution:  They will order me a new motherboard (5 more days)\n	and have on-site service install it for me.\nBUT, I have to take a day off of work because the service people\nonly work 9-5 M-f.  I say, no way I've already blown about 20 hours\nwith this, about 10 of them on hold and I don't have the time or $$\nto take a day off work.  Also, my 30 day return period is almost over and\nI've only been able to use the thin for about 10 minutes.  So, the whole \nthing is going back.  \n  I was extremely upset when I began this post because the support rep told me\nthat I would have to pay shipping not only for the returned system, but also\nthe two hard drive controllers they had sent me.  Fortunately, I just spoke\nto customer service and they are going to have UPS come and pick everything\nup gratis. The only downside is that now I have to order another computer.\n\nI would really like to try Gateway again, I'm just very turned off by the\nprospect of having to try and get through to Customer Service or Tech Support\nagain...  I think their products are great for the most part, but I'm\nbeginning to wonder if the savings are worth the potential aggravation.\nAre other mail order companies as difficult to contact?  I know Gateway is\nbooming, and for good reason, but I don't know if I can take it again.\nOh well, I feel better now...

I've been intently following the MAG thread while waiting for\nmine to arrive in the mail. There seems to be a lot of\ncomplaints about minor alignment problems with the MX15F. One\narticle contained a comment that the owner called the factory\nand was told that his screen rotation was within spec (1/4").\n\nWell, my monitor arrived last night and, sure enough, it has\na very noticable barrel distortion. It's not dramatic, but it\nis there and it is especially noticable when the image doesn't\nfill the entire screen. The fact that it is worse on the right\nside doesn't help matters.\n\nWhat I'm trying to find out is if these minor imperfections\nare the norm or are most of their monitors perfect? I don't want\nto send it back and get one with the same or an even worse\nproblem. Does the factory consider this kind of thing normal\nand ship their monitors with less than perfect alignment? \nAre other netters just living with these kind of imperfections?\n\n--
I just purchased a Viewsonic 17 and and Orchid P9000.  In short, I am happy\nwith the monitor and unhappy with the card.  I have spent a lot more time\nfutzing with the card, so that is what I am going to write about.  The monitor\nis pretty.  The moires I had under Simcity on my 17" Magnavox went away.  It\nisn't as heavy as I thought it would be (45 lbs, I think).  So much for the\nmonitor.  On to the bitch session and test results.\n\nIn going with the modern trend, the Orchid P9000 card only supports 16 colors\nin 640x480 mode without a driver.  Of course, this breaks any DOS program\nwhich uses SVGA modes (like most of my CD-ROMs).  The Compudyne Whiplash VGA,\nOrchid Fahrenheit 1280, and Orchid F. VLB all share this limitation.  Those\nare all S3 cards, which means it is an S3 problem for them (the P9000 uses\na Weitek VGA chip which also doesn't support them).  The Hercules Graphite\ncard does seem to have these modes, but I didn't run the same test cases as\nI did on the other boards during the brief time I had it.  It was able to\nprint the splash screen for the Grolier's Encyclopedia, though, which the S3\ncards just printed as hash, which is why I suspect the SVGA modes are supported.\n\nThe supported resolutions really annoy me.  You can do 1280x1024 at 75Hz if\nyou tell the driver you have an NEC 5FG (they only have about six monitors\nlisted plus 'Generic', and if you choose Generic you can't get any high\nrefreshes at ALL).  But at 1024x768 you are limited to 70Hz.  Seems to me\nthat the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth (if it can do 75Hz\nat 1280 it sure should be able to do it at 1024!).  Higher vertical resolution\nwas the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid F. VLB I currently have,\nand it will do 1024x768x70 Hz as well.\n\nThe higher graphics modes all crash HP Dashboard.  I just got off the phone\nwith Orchid, and with the 1.1 drivers (I don't know what I have) he was unable\nto recreate the problem.  On the plus side, their tech rep was as helpful as\nhe could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he didn't have\nthe problem.  He didn't know why they limited the refresh to 70 Hz either.\n\nThe board is faster that the OFVLB for most things according to the Hercules\nSpeedy program. This program tests various operations and reports the results\nin pixels/second.  I don't have the numbers for the Graphite card, but they\nwere close to half of the OFVLB (ie, slower) but that was running in a 20MHz\n386, ISA, so the numbers aren't really comparable.  The following numbers\nwere all obtained using a 486, 33 MHz, AIR motherboard (UMC chipset), with\n8 MB memory.  I give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it\ncomputes them, and these tend to jump around a bit.\n\n\nK means thousand (not 1024), M means million, pixels per second\n\n             Orchid Fahrenheit VLB                  Orchid P9000\nChip                 S3 805                          Weitek 9000\nDIB to Screen        182K - 190K                     228K - 240K\nMemory to Screen     5.9M - 6.2M                     8.4M - 8.9M\nScreen to Screen     14M - 14.8M                     29M - 30.8M\nVector, solid        2.4M                            2.8M - 2.9M\nVector, styled       55K - 58K                       449K - 473K\nPolygon, shaded      1.8M - 2.1M                     1.6M - 1.9M\nPolygon, hatched     6.9M - 7.9M                     1.3M - 1.7M\nTernary Rops         1.9M - 2.4M                     477K - 520K\nFont                 130K - 160K                     46K - 55K / 1.2M\n\nThe DIB to Screen test takes a device independent bitmap of a face and transfers\nit to the screen.  I have no idea what is being done internally as far as\nconversions go.  The memory to screen takes the same face and copies it to\nthe screen, my guess is after it has been rasterized into a bitmap that can\njust be copied to the video display.  The screen to screen test copies that\nface from place to place on the screen.  Awesome!  Interestingly, the solid\nvectors and shaded polygons show no improvement, and hatched polygons (ie,\nfilled with cross-hatching) and Ternary Rops (whatever they are.  Graphics\noperations like XORs maybe????) are a dead loss on the 9000.  I give two\nnumbers for the 9000 fonts, because I think they are caching.\nWhen the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly --\n1/3 the speed of the OFVLB.  Then the speed increases dramatically.  Sounds\nlike programming to a benchmark to me....\n\nI make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all.  Its just what\nI saw when I ran them on my computer.  I normally don't write disclaimers,\nbut this time maybe I'd better.  My testing is totally unconnected with my\nwork (I program under UNIX on Decstations) is done completely without the\nknowledge, blessing, or equipment of my company.

There is a way in which a multi-tasking computer actually gives you\nmore CPU power then you had before, and that is with I/O overlap.\nWith I/O overlap, your CPU can continue to "think" while disk\noperations are underway, whereas without overlap, your CPU sits idly\nwaiting for each disk operation to finish - and disk operations take\nan *eternity*, compared to a fast CPU.\n\nSo, when you've got multi-tasking, you want to increase performance by\nincreasing the amount of overlapping you do.\n\nOne way is with DMA or bus mastering.  Either of these make it\npossible for I/O devices to move their data into and out of memory\nwithout interrupting the CPU.  The alternative is for the CPU to move\nthe data.  There are several SCSI interface cards that allow DMA and\nbus mastering.  IDE, however, is defined by the standard AT interface\ncreated for the IBM PC AT, which requires the CPU to move all the data\nbytes, with no DMA.
Hey, does anybody know anything about Leading Technology Computers??\n\nI have a Leading Technology 6000SX and need a new mother board for it.\n\nDoes anybody know where I can get one.
The Adaptec 1540-series use bus mastering.  This means that the CPU\ndoesn't sit waiting for data bytes, it can go off and do other\ncomputing - if you have an advanced multi-tasking OS, that is.  DOS\njust sits and waits anyway.\n\n\nWhy don't you start with the spec-sheet of the ISA bus first? :-) IDE\nwas designed to plug into ISA virtually unaided - in essence, IDE *is*\nISA, on a ribbon cable.  Therefore it's specs are the same as ISA -\n8MHz clock, 16 bit width, 5MB/sec.\n\nThis is why I've concluded that IDE on VL-bus is a waste of a fast\nslot.  The card's job would to slow the VL-bus transactions to ISA\nspeed.  Heck, that's what ISA slots do - I'll just use one of those\ninstead.
Hello.  I hope somebody out here can help me.  I am currently working\non a project where I am trying to communicate from an IBM 386 with\nPhoenix BIOS, using C++, to a board that I made with an Intel 8085 CPU\nwith UART chip.  The board works fine with the TRANSMIT command and \nTerminal Emulation mode of Kermit, but there seems to be something wrong\nwith the initialization or protocol used when I try C++.  I need to\naccess the unit I built using C, because I have a sizable chunk of C\ncode that I will be using to perform calculations and operations that\nwill be very difficult to code in assembly language for the 8085.\n\nI have included the assembly code that I am running and the C++ code\nthat I am trying to use.  If anyone can show me something that I\nam doing blatantly incorrectly or that I am missing because of my lack\nof knowledge about RS-232 serial communications, please e-mail me.\nI wrote the assembly language to wait for a character to be received and\nthen to check it against the 0x20 character, if a 0x20 is received, \nthe LEDs will indicate this.  Two C++ programs that I have written do\nnothing, but set up COM port 2 and send the 0x20 character.  One uses\nthe bioscom() function in bios.h the other uses the software interrupt\nint86() function in dos.h.  I have triple checked the baud rate ( 2400 )\nthe parity ( none ) the stop bits ( 1 ) the character length ( 8 bits )\nand the interrupt calls for ( 0x14 ).  Currently, I am at a loss as\nto what may be wrong.

Too right it does!\n\n\nThe --VERY VERY FIRST-- thing you do is make sure that --ALL-- files on\nthe floppies that you can currently read in the drive, which aren't\nalready on your HD or another floppy (if you have -two- floppy drives)\nget copied to your HD (and/or to a floppy in your other drive).\n\nIf you don't do this before fixing the alignment problem you have kissd\nthose files goodbye.  (Well, you can -try- to re-misalign the drive back\nto read your floppies, but don't count on be able to do so!)\n\nGenerally, head alignment is something I'd only trust to a good repair\nshop (though there are/have been DIY guides).
Anybody seen the date get stuck?\n\nI'm running MS-DOS 5.0 with a menu system alive all the time.  The machine\nis left running all the time.\n\nSuddenly, the date no longer rolls over.  The time is (reasonably) accurate\nallways, but we have to change the date by hand every morning.

I just installed a DX2-66 CPU in a clone motherboard, and tried mounting a CPU \ncooler on the chip.  After about 1/2 hour, the weight of the cooler was enough \nto dislodge the CPU from its mount.  It ended up bending a few pins\non the CPU, but luckily the power was not on yet.  I ended up\npressing the CPU deeply into its socket and then putting the CPU\ncooler back on.  So far so good.\n\nHave others had this problem?  How do you ensure that the weight of\nthe CPU fan and heatsink do not eventually work the CPU out of its\nsocket when mounting the motherboard in a vertical case?
Try putting one of the IRQs for your COM ports onto IRQ2. The hardware will\nautomagically wrap IRQ2 to IRQ9 on AT class machines (eg, anything with high\nIRQs). This is what I'm doing on my set up right now. \n   I've got COM2 on IRQ2 (really IRQ9 - address it this way in software), COM1\non IRQ3, SoundBlaster on IRQ5, LPT1 on IRQ7, and my ATI BusMouse port on one of\nthe interrupts in between. Works just great.\n   If you need even more, there's a text file floating around somewhere that\ndetails how to hack up any serial card (and probably any others) to work on the\nhigher IRQs. It basically involves cutting the trace to the low IRQ and running a wire over the a high IRQ pin on the 16bit expansion bus.\n\n  It will be best to put the modem's COM port onto IRQ2/9. This will be the \n\nfirst IRQ serviced by the system, giving the modem a better response -- \nespecially handy under multitaskers like OS/2 -- which I'm running with no\nproblems.\n\nJustin

We are trying to connect an Olivetti XM4311 5" floppy drive as the second\ndrive on a Panasonic 286 machine.

We don't know how to set the DIP\nswitches and think that may be the problem.\n\nAny information, or advice (other than "junk the stupid thing" :) would be\nmost appreciated, thanks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAnonymous,\n\nI saw a posting about the choice between 80486DX-50 and a 80486DX2-50.\nI was wondering: although a DX-50 is faster because of the path to it's\nexternal cache, shouldn't the choice be the DX2-50 as that one can be\nmade to work properly with a local-bus? I mean, cache speed is one thing,\nbut all your speed will be blocked during video I/O, so just get that\nfaster... \nI'm willing to speculate that the DX2-50 with local-bus will be 2-4 times \nas fast as the DX-50 and probably as expensive (or cheap ;-)!
I have a 286 with an M205 motherboard.  The Last Byte memory manager (which\nI downloaded for a trial) reports the chipset is an AddTech PCCHIP1 chipset,\nand it is able to activate the ram behind segments A000-FFFF, which can then be\nused for UMBs (except for video/BIOS).  I would like to write my own driver to\nactivate the memory.  Does anyone know where I can get programming information\non this chip?
No rumour, IBM's clock tripling chip was seen in some trade show last\nfall (COMDEX or something, I wasn't there). All you people who are\ndrooling after this chip do realize that it has no FPU, just like\n486SX, that Evil Marketing Ploy(tm) from Intel, don't you? It has 16K\nof internal cache, which probably is where the saved silicon real\nestate went. Because of some contract, IBM is not allowed to sell its\n486 chips to third parties, so these chips are unlikely to become\navailable in any non-IBM machines. Of course, nothing prevents other\ncompanies from implementing a DX3/99, but nobody hasn't even come out\nwith a real 486DX (FPU and all) clone yet (although AMD soon will).

Will the higher\n: resolution be noticed for these?\n: \nIf you are talking about laser jet 4 then I believe it has to be postscript.\nI don't see any advantage to using PCL when you have a peice of hardware\nplugged into the LJ4 that is doing the work and it can support any language\nthat is suited for the job.  Besides I don't think PCL is even capable of\nhandling 1200 dpi specifications.  I only have experience with the Laser\nMaster Winjet 1200 which brings the LJ4 up to 1200 dpi and it uses postscript.\nIt also has a fast print mode which is not postscript, and it is at a lower\nresolution (600dpi I think), but it is FAST!!!!  This particular product\nuses your host processor to process the postscript, so even with a decent\nPC you know it's going to be slow i.e. slow compared to a high-end workstation\nprocessed PS.\n\nThe quality difference is very noticable and is almost worth the wait (for\nthe PS processing) - I'm rather impatient.\n\nWe were using it for B&W camera images (RS-170).  The gray scale image was\naccepted by MS Word and handed to the Winjet PS printer driver which converts\nthe image into postscript and then hands it off to the Winjets postscript\nprocessor.  The postscript is rendered into RAM (lots of it) and when it\nis done it shoots it directly to the printer.  The PS processor can also\naccept PS files created from other sources including DOS applications, but\nWindows has to be running at the time of printing.  The PS processor is\nresponsible for the halftoning and I'd say it does a pretty good job.  Our\ncamera images came out very good in my opinion.  (not as good as Laser Master's\ndemo though).\n\nI don't know how many other similar products are out there but I would be\nsurprised if there are several.

i've been using an identical setup, except for the tower config,\nfor several months now.  from previous discussions on the net,\nthe first thing to check for is DMA conflicts with other devices,\nespecically if you've got any funky ones.  next off, suspect\nyour tape - try a fresh one.  good luck !
Does your Stealth 24 have a row of DIP switches on the back plane?\n\nIf so, you have the older Revision A board and the winmark results\nare absolutely normal. The later Revision B board benchmarks at 13\nto 15 million winmarks (at least mine does in 486DX-50 toy).
Hi,\nI have got a Quantum ProDrive 80AT IDE harddisk and would\nlike to format it. When trying to format it (*no* low-level\nformat, just FDISK and DOS FORMAT), I somehow messed up the\nparameters... I had entered FDISK /MBR not exactly knowing\nwhat this does.\nThe suggested drive type 38 formats the drive only to 21MB.\nI tried type 25, but this gives only around 70MB and not\nthe nominal 80MB.\nCould I use user type 47? However, I don't know the actual\nparameters (cylinders, heads,...) Could someone give me them?\nAnd how does FDISK work together with user type 47?\nPlease reply by email to GERTHD@MVS.SAS.COM\nThank you,\nThomas\n+-------------------------------------------------------------------+\n+-------------------------------------------------------------------+

Greetings,\n\n        Please forgive me if this is FAQ. If there is source on this kind of info, \nplease let me know. I just got a 286 station (around 21*16.5*7 in dimension),\nand I am thinking about upgrade it to a 486 or 386.\n\n        The station has a power supply, two floppy disk drives, and the big\ncase. I have SONY 1304 monitor, SyQuest drive (Mac), and maybe a cd-rom\nreader (Mac) for it. Here are the questions I have so far:\n1) Is there a 486 motherboard at this dimension that I could use the case?\n2) The original owener has the controller for floppy drive and hard disk\nremoved. Can I use them to control these devices under 486? How much do I\nhave to pay for a new controllers if the old ones won't work?\n3) How can I make SyQuest (SCSI) and cd-rom (SCSI) work on this station? \nI heard that there is a cheap sound board that has SCSI controller built-in?\nWhat's quality of this board? How much usually does a SCSI control cost?\nIs there any ftp sites that has SyQuest driver or cd-rom driver for the PC if\nI can have everything hooked up OK?4) What I want is a 486 motherboard, a sound board to make it a MPC- \nquality station. How much would it cost to do that? Is it worth the hussle\nthan just buy a new 486 station? BTW, I need to buy a keyboard for it too.\n\nAny input is welcome.\n\nThank you.
I recently bought a monichrome VGA monitor for $99 that will do\n1024x768 non-interlaced, which seems like a good deal. However, it is\na fixed-scan rate monitor, and only handles 52 kHz horizontal, I\nthink. With my Trident card it works only in graphics modes 5e and 62\n- not much use, since just about any application will set the mode to\nsomething else, especially if it wants to do text, I suppose. Anyway:\n\n - is there any way that I can use this as a general-purpose VGA\n   display with a 1-meg trident 8900C card?\n\n - if not, can I do so with some sort of different VGA card?\n\n				Peter Desnoyers

What's the difference between the F550i and the new F550iW?  I'm\nabout to buy a Gateway system and was going to take the F550i\nupgrade.  Should I get the F550iW instead?
From a recent BYTE magazine i got the following:\n\n[Question and part of the answer deleted]\n\n  If you are handy with a soldering iron, the loopback plugs are easy to\nmake.  On a serial RS-232 nine-pin port, use a female DB-9 connector and\nconnect pins 1 to 7 to 8; 2 to 3; and 4 to 6 to 9.  For serial RS-232 \n25-pin ports, you'll need a female DB-25 connector with pins 1 to 7;\n2 to 3; 4 to 5 to 8; 6 to 11 to 20 to 22; 15 to 17 to 23; and 18 to 25\nconnected.  To test a Centronics 25-pin parallel port, you'll need to\nconnect pins 1 to 13; 2 to 15; 10 to 16; 11 to 17; and 12 to 14 in a male\nDB-25 connector.\n\n					-Stan Wszola\n---\n\nI haven't tried it.

I bought a 386DX33 system a little over 2 years ago, and was satisfied with\neverything about Zeos.  That computer went off to grad school with my son and\nI replaced it with a 486DX2/66 pkg 4 (345 MBHD, 16MB ram) with Diamond Viper,\n128K level 2 cache, and tower upgrades, delete the CTX monitor.  I got a\n17" HP D1193A monitor employee purchase.  This is a *great* system, fast,\nquiet, solidly built, not a single glitch bringing it up.  Tech support seems \nbusier now than 2 years ago.  I called with a configuration question, and\nthey called back 4 hours later with the right answer.  I think there's a\nslight premium over Gateway prices, but IMHO Zeos is worth it. BTW they \nhave enough 800 lines that I've never gotten a busy signal calling sales,\ncustomer service, or tech support. Now, you usually wait 5 or 10 minutes to\ntalk to someone, but at least you get in the queue and wait on their dime.

: \n: Okay, here is my configuration:\n: \n: 80486-33 Gateway 433C Micronics ISA\n: 12MB RAM \n: WD212MB IDE HD ( drive C: )\n: ST3144A 125MB IDE HD ( drive D: )\n: Adaptec SCSI 1542B controller, with SCSI BIOS enabled\n: Seagate ST296N 80MB SCSI drive\n: \n: Alrighty, when I boot up I get the Adaptec BIOS message, but it says\n: something like:\n: \n: "Drive C: installed"\n: "Drive D: installed"\n: "ADaptec SCSI BIOS not installed!"\n: \n: And I can't get to the Seagate drive.\n: \n: I go into PhoenixBIOS setup, remove the entry for drive D:, and BOOM, I can\n: access the Seagate.  Is there a way to get two IDE drives and the Seagate\n: at the same time?  I have ASPI4DOS.SYS, but it just hangs the system.\n: \n: Brian\n: \n\nThere is a simple answer.  If my memory serves me the scsi bios will only\nwork as the first or second drive.  Any "built-in" drives e.g. IDE are\ninstalled first and then when the scsi bios runs it will try to install\nas the next drive.  But if there are already two drives, then no can do.\n\nThe solution is simple: use the aspi4dos device driver and disable the\nscsi bios (as it is useless in your case).  It works like a champ!  I\nhave seen a similar situation before.\n\nGood Luck
I'm in the market to upgrade my BIOS to a Phoenix 1.10 (got a new hard disk,\ndiscovered my BIOS doesn't have a "type 47") and I would like know where I\ncan purchase one of these things.\n\nI checked with the motherboard manufacturer (for the curious-- it's from\nMylex), and hearing the $60 figure prompted me to at least try to shop\naround...\n\nProblem is, I don't know where to shop around for something like this.\n\nI have heard that there's a BIOS speciality shop in the South Bay and it's\nbeen alleged that they advertise in the MicroTimes.\n\nDid find the MicroTimes, didn't find the ad or the shop.\n\nSo, can anybody help me out on this quest?\n\nTo anybody who replies to this-- Thanks in advance.
This may be a very naive question but is there any basis for the\nclaim that a CPU will get hotter when a computationally intensive \njob is running? My friend claims that there will be little difference\nin the temperature of an idle CPU and a CPU running a computationally\nintensive job.
(How is 0-40 twice 1.25? Do you just pick whatever SCSI setup that makes\nthe statment "correct"?)\nEven if you could make such a statement it would be meaningless unless\nyou understood that ESDI and IDE (I include SCSI and ATA) are\ncompletely different (ESDI is device-level, like MFM/RLL).\n\n\n\nGreat, you can compare two numbers (ATA has several speed modes, by the\nway) but what the article said was misleading/wrong.\n\n\nI would recommend people call the NCR board and download the ANSI specs\nif they are really interested in this stuff.\n\n\n\nSomething is missing there. :) Anyway, I agree. There's a lot of\nopportunity for marketing jingo like "SCSI-2 compliant" which tells\nyou nothing about the performance, whether it has "WIDE" support, etc.
I believe so, since the Buslogic cards have proven to be very \nreliable in OS/2 2.0....\n\n\n Endusers (not OEM manufactures) will get all the software package with the\ncard which includes drivers for Novell, OS/2, Unix & Xenix and so forth.\n\n\n Definitely.
I've been troubleshooting the existence of way too many General Protection\nFaults on a 486-33, Eisa-VLB, system.

Does anyone else have any\nexperiences with this board.
Just wanted to ask a question. I bought a hard disk drive second-hand\nthe other day, and I opened the packaging up and saw that there was a small\nsticker on the drive that had a little red apple with a bite taken out of it.\nIt's socket did not look the same as my existing hard disk that is in my\ncomputer already (it has fifty little pins sticking out from it instead of\nthe 39 that is sticking out of my old hard disk.\nI don't know if disk drives for the Apple (or Mac) are different from ones\nused in AT clones, so could someone tell me if I could use this hard disk\non my AT clone? If not, what did I just purchase? It's a Quantum Prodrive.\nIt's dated 1988 on the green board. Will I need a controller/add-in card?\nAll the help is much appreciated. Thanks! :)
: This may be the dumbest question of the year, but is there a\n: way to 'piggyback' or expand a 6-slot motherboard (all 16-bit)\n: to get the usual 8?

They allow 3-5 slots staggered on either\nside of the card.  You can install it in the last slot, and then (probably) \nhave 2 or 3 sideways slots.  This is actually how it is done in the low\nprofile cases - a standard motherboard, the 'T' connector in one slot, \nand the expansion cards plugged into the 'T'.  I guess you could do this at \neach end of the slots (1 & 8) to add even more.  \n\nThe 'T' connectors are simply tracks with slots on them - no electronics\non it.  The only downside - your case won't close, but for a homebrew system,\nthat may not be a problem.\n\nDon't know about performance, though.  I'll leave that discussion to the \nengineers.

Your machine will run at whatever the bus is jumpered to/CMOS is set to\n(usually wait states) regardless of what speed RAM is installed.  No\nmotherboard can sense the speed of the RAM installed, unless you call\nfailing as a sort of auto-sense.  This is how you can sometimes use\n"slower" RAM in a machine.  You either set the number of wait states to\naccomodate the slow RAM (in which case, all memory will run at that\nslower rate) or you reduce the wait states and take the chance that the\nslower RAM will act like faster RAM and you won't crash.\n\nPutting faster RAM in won't speed things up unless you tell the machine\nit has faster RAM.  \n\nMixing fast and slow RAM will not help you if you have to keep the bus \nslowed down to accomodate slow RAM.\n\nJimL\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-- \nMailer address is buggy!

Hi all,\n\n  I would like to purchase CD-ROM drive. The specs I would like to have is:\n\n   * Applicable to Kodak multisession Photo-CD\n   * SCSI(2) Interface\n   * Compatible with Adaptec-1542B\n   * Does not need any caddies\n   * Cheaper ( < $500 if possible)\n   * Double Speeded\n\n  I believe there are no drives satisfying all of the above condition,\n  so I would like to know all of your opinion.  The above conditions\n  are sorted by my priority.\n  I think NEC CDR74-1/84-1 is a little bit expensive, but it DOES satisfy\n  almost all of the above conditions. The problem is that I do not know\n  the compatibility with 1542B. Has someone succeeded to connect these\n  NEC drives to 1542B? I have heard a rumor that NEC drive is incompatible\n  with 1542B adapter.\n  Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.

I am unable to get my Gateway 486DX2/66 to run Windows\nin 1280x1024.  I ordered a 2M ATI Ultra Pro, and I'm pretty\nsure the 2M is really there because I *can* select\n1024x768x65536.   But no matter what I do with the Flex program\nin the ATI's program group, 1280x1024 remains ghosted out.\nI have Windows 3.1, build 59 of the drivers, DOS 5.0.  The\ndrivers were installed by Gateway, not by me, so perhaps there's\na file missing from the hard drive.  It runs 1024x768 just fine.\n  I did go into the Desktop window and select 1280x1024.

You might try asking on one of the comp.sys.ibm.* echos (the best one\nmay be comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware).  I say this because the conversion\nseems more geared toward a PC user wanting to use that monitor, than\nan Atari user who already can use the monitor (unless maybe they\nwant to really go wild - converting the monitor to VGA, then\nusing it as a VGA monitor with a Falcon :-)\n\n   As for graphics cards, assuming that the Atari monitor can be\nmodified/adapted to handle VGA signals, you should probably be able\nto use any VGA card (at least with a res around 640x400).  I haven't\ntried this, but that would be my guess...\n\n				Robert Anisko\n				anisko@usdtsg.daytonoh.ncr.com

I\naccidentally discovered that if a have a floppy from ONE particular\nbox of diskettets in the A drive when I boot up, rather than getting\nthe "Non-system diskette" message, the machine hangs and the CMOS\ngets overwritten (luckily, Gateway sends a print of the standard\nCMOS settings with their systems).  This only happens with a box\nof pre-formatted Fuji disks that I have, no other disks cause this\nproblem.  If I re-format one of the Fuji disks, the problem goes away.\nI did a virus scan (scan v1.02) of the disks and found nothing.\n\nAnyone have any idea what is going on here?  Hardware problem?  A\nvirus that can't be detected?  The system reading in garbage from\nthe boot sector?

I have a similar configuration: Colorado 250mb on 66 DX/2 tower.\n\n\n\n	You got suckered in the same way I did.  Silly me, believing\n	that the "250" logo on the front meant actual carrying capacity.\n	The people who do this sort of thing for a living call it \n	"marketing."  Lawyers who prosecute it call it "fraud."\n	Perhaps we can have a bunch of other duped buyers march on \n	their corporate headquarters.\n\n\n	This is a bit long.  My system takes about 45 minutes to do \n	the same thing.  Usually 4.5 hours, particularly if the tape \n	is grinding away the whole time means that your block size for \n	the write is too small.  Is there any way to change the block \n	size or write buffer size so it's bigger?\n\n\n	This is because the files are opened by DOS.  The files in the \n	TAPE directory are likely the executable file or the configuration\n	file for the tape system.  I would recommend running the backup\n	from DOS so it will make a complete backup of the TAPE directory.\n\n\n	The 250mb cartridges won't do you any good since the drive\n	won't write 250mb of physical data on the tape.

A program in the archive keymap00.zip on simtel and mirror sites in the \nmsdos/keyboard directory will do this.  It is written in assembler and it \nbest if you have a compiler to create a new keyboard map.  It is possible, \nhowever, to use a binary editor to edit the provided compiled keyboard \ndriver if you do not have a compiler.  I used hexed100.zip, also available \non simtel.  Simply serach for the codes 00 01 02 03 to locate the biginning \nof the "normal" keyboard map.  Then swap the codes for the keys that you \nwish to swap.  See the keyboard directory of simtel for programs that report \nthe scancode for each key to you (some bios programs also have this info).\nGood luck,\n\n- Pete\n____________________________________________________________________________

From article <1qq7i1INNdqc@dns1.NMSU.Edu>, by bgrubb@dante.nmsu.edu (GRUBB):\n\n[Tons of stuff deleted on SCSI vs. IDE question...]\n\nWow, you guys are really going wild on this IDE vs. SCSI thing, and I think\nit's great!\n\nLike lots of people, I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from\nthe hard drive.  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), and\nwhat I would say is a standard (not special, no cache I believe) IDE controller\ncard on my ISA 486-50.\n\nI'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range.\nAnd I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head)\nabout buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).  I believe I'm getting\nsomething like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU).  How would this\nnumber compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, and\nthe state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)?\nObviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would\nYOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost?\n\nAlong those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I\nwere to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD?\nAnd how much would it cost?\n\nI actually have a PAS-16, and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hook\nup a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec.\nActually, I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (and\nown the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).  Is this SCSI port a\nSCSI-2 port?  How could I tell?  Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI-2?  Are all SCSI\nHD's SCSI-2?\n\nThanks for any comments on these rephrased questions.

We have a Gateway 486DX50 with a SMC Elite16 Series Ethercard Plus.\n\nWhen we use NCSA FTP to send from the Gateway with hash turned on, we see\n4 hash marks immediately.  Then the computer  r e a l l y  drags.  If we turn \noff the internal cache of the 486, the speed is better, but doesn't match\nthe speed when we receive to the Gateway.\n\nIt doesn't matter if we send from the Gateway or get to it: 4 hash marks and \nthen extreme slowness if the cache is not disabled.\n\nDoes anyone know any more about this?  Is there a fix?\n\nThe Gateway was purchased in June, 1992.\n\nPlease respond directly.  You wouldn't believe how slow the news is on this \nsystem.
That figure (1/4") for image rotation would seem to be a little high...\non my NEC 5FG the specs call for no greater than 3mm (0.12").\n\n\nI can't speak for MAG Innovision but as far as NEC is concerned, they are\nadjusted to "factory-spec" before leaving the central USA distribution point\n(MA) for the eastern Canadian market. Now, here's the key: NEC *knows* that\nthe >=15" monitors' adjustments are very sensitive to shipping over\ndistances (with all the bumps, rough handling, and such) and therefore\n*expect* and (at least in theory) *require* that the local *distributor*\n(not dealer) have it adjusted at the *local* service centre (Bull HN\nInformation Systems in Toronto) before sale. This is the correct and\nprobably only way of having any chance of receiving a "perfect" monitor\n(the definition of "perfect" seems to depend on how picky one is, in my\ncase quite :).\n\n\nI, for one, was not willing to accept what I considered a substandard\nmonitor and, after two months of wrangling and direct contact with NEC,\nfinally received a satisfactorily adjusted monitor (not perfect, IMHO,\nbut a major improvement over what the dealer and distributor were trying\nconvince me was "normal"). The short answer is no, don't accept these\n"imperfections" as "normal" because for the premium one pays for the\nlarger screen monitors, one has a right to expect higher quality, and\nif you're persistent, you'll receive it.
The only difference is the time the driver gets loaded. mouse.sys will be\nloaded during the config.sys and therefor before the command.com. mouse.com\nwill be loaded during autoexec.bat and so after the command.com.\n\n\nmouse.com could be started from the commandline after the booting and it\ncould - perhaps - be unloaded, if no other driver is loaded after it.\nThe working of both drivers is totally the same.\n\nWhen I ran dos, I preferred loading most of the drivers in autoexec.bat,\nbecause some programs won't run with some drivers and I could choose the\nones I needed during startup. But with DRDOS6, this advantage is gone,\nbecause DRDOS lets you choose in config.sys which drivers should be loaded.\n\nMichael

If your Gateway is equipped with a Western hard drive, then the noise\nis probably coming from there and not from the fan.  The Western drives\nare notoriously noisy.  On the other hand, if you don't have a Western\ndrive, then maybe it is the fan.  There's not alot to do about it except\ninsulate around the cpu somehow.

I have been following this thread and figured I'd throw in my two cents...\n\nThe Amiga Zorro II bus is comparable with the ISA bus (7.16 vs 8.33 MHZ).\nThe Amiga has had a pre-emptative multi-tasking  OS since '85 and can\noperate with 1 MB RAM!  SCSI is used almost exclusively on these systems.\n\nA SCSI controller that transfers data by DMA allows the cpu to request data\nfrom the hard drive and continue working while the controller gets the data\nand moves it to memory.  A controller that allows reselection can operate\neven better with multiple devices.  This is espically true with SCSI tape\nunits.  For example, when rewinding or formatting a tape, the command is\nissued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other\ndevices on the bus.  This greatly increases productivity or, at least, do\nsomething else while backing up your hard drive :-).  Which happens to be\nwhat I am doing while reading this group.\n\nIts a long story, but I still use IDE on my 486 except for the CDROM which,\nthanks to SCSI, I can move between both machines.  If, and when, SCSI is\nbetter standardized and supported on the ibm-clone machines, I plan to\ncompletely get rid of IDE.\n--\n  Wayne Summer        //        AMIGA - Simply the Best.\n  Palm Bay, FL.

I recently bought a Micron 486DX/33 VLB computer and the the local bus\nide card was getting around 1k/s transfer rates (says norton).  I caled\nmicron because this seemed pathetically slow and they said that norton\n6.xx doesn't recognize local bus and won't give accurate results.  I was\ntold I would need norton 7.0 in order to get a true account of my ide\ntransfer speed.\n\nI didn't really like this answer in part because the drive doesn't seem\nas though it's cranking along at much more than that, but I also don't\nknow if I could tell the difference.\n\nI tried playing around with settings in the CMOS (bus speed at the like)\nand noticed no significant change in performance.\n\n**B0100000027fed4\nFrank Shea
The above does not tell the proper story of SCSI:\nSCSI-I: 8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}, synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer \nbase.\nSCSI-1{faster} this requires a SCSI-2 controller chip and provides\n SCSI-2 {8-bit to 16-bit} speeds with SCSI-1 controlers.\nSCSI-2: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst{8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, \nand 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst{32-bit/wide and fast}.  16-bit SCSI can be\nwide or fast, it depends on how the port is designed{The Quadras will support\nfast SCSI but not wide when the OS SCSI manager is rewritten since the\nQuardas use a SCSI-1 {non-wide} port}.\n\nThe article in PC Mag 4/27/93:29 was talking about SCSI-1 {SCSI-2 uses\nTEN (10) devices in it native mode, outside its native mode it behaves a\nlot like SCSI-1 (7 devices, slower through put}\n\nFrom your own figures SCSI-1 is indeed twice ESDI as the article pointed out\nas for "20% faster then IDE" that seems to be 8-bit SCSI-1 using a SCSI-2 \ncontoler chip {The Mac Quadra uses a SCSI-2 controler chip for its SCSI-1\nand gets 6MB/s through put for asynchronous {8-bit} SCSI-1, far in excess of a\nnormal SYNCHRONOUS SCSI-1 output} 120% of 8.3 is 9.96 which is near\nthe burst of a SCSI-1 machine with a SCSI-2 controller chip.\n\nThe PC world seems to have SCSI-1 and SCSI-2 mixed up.  Fact is SCSI-2 \ncontroler chips allow near SCSI-2 speeds through a SCSI-1 device\n{As shown in the Mac Quadra} which skews some of the data of SCSI-1 vs\nIDE or ESDI test. I agree that the article COULD have stated that the "20%\nfaster then IDE" came off a SCSI-1 device with a SCSI-2 chip.  Maybe it\nwas there and the EDITOR killed it because the article was dealing with\nSCSI-1 NOT SCSI-2 and he did not understand the effect of a SCSI-1 device\nwith a SCSI-2 controller chip.\nSCSI-1 chips are limited to 5/MB max.  SCSI-1 devices with SCSI-2 chips\n{becoming common} produce up to 10Mb/s in 8-bit mode and 20MB/s in 16-bit\nmode {the fast version, SCSI-1 ports cannot use wide SCSI}.  Of cource\nthe prime piece of wierdness is that SCSI-1 devices HAVE SCSI-2 chips\n{or more accurately the machine does}. This allows the best of BOTH\nworlds: high SCSI-2 speeds and cheeper SCSI-1 costs {FULL SCSI-2 hardware\n(port, electronic controller, etc) is VERY expensive.  It ALSO creates\na logistic NIGHTMARE as to how fast SCSI-1 goes.
I can wait 'cos I've already got an accelerated card. It does 1280x1024 but\nonly 16 colour. You may mock me, but such cards will be here quickly enough.\n\n\nI only wait when the difference between my current system and the new stuff\nis big enough to warrant changing. For instance, I'll be upgrading my 486 33\nto a 486DX-2 66 EISA, VLB board RSN. The performance difference (under Linux)\nis great enough to be worthwhile. At the same time I'll be buying a new\ngraphic card and new SCSI controller. I'll be buying an S3 card 'cos they're\nfast enough, I have X11 drivers for them and it'll have 2MB VRAM just like\na Weitek 9000 card. It will also be MUCH cheaper. When affordable 4MB cards\narrive, I'll buy one.\n\n\nOver the last year I've done much the same. But now I need a 19" monitor, more\nmemory (20MB just ain't enough), a GB disk (1.2GB and no space left...). Oh\nwell, stay single, don't smoke and you may afford it this year ;-)

IDE also uses DMA techniques.  I believe floppy controller also uses DMA,\nand most A/D boards also use DMA.  DMA is no big deal, and has nothing to\ndo directly with SCSI.\n\n\nYou can thank your software for that.  If DOS had a few more brains, it\ncould format floppies etc. while you were doing something else.  The\nhardware will support it, but DOS (at least) won't.  Again, this has   \nnothing to do with SCSI.\n\n\nAnd if you stick with DOS you'll wonder why you can't multitask.

This may be a dumb question, but I need to put a hard drive on my father's\nPC/XT, either MFM, RLL, or IDE. I know how to hook it up, but how do I tell\nthe computer the geometry of the drive. On my 386, you set it in the BIOS, but\nI doubt that's how it's done on an XT. I thought it might be software with\nthe controller card, but the IDE card for XT's that I saw didn't come with\nany. Also, how do I low level format it once it's on the computer? (Assuming\na drive which needs formatting)\n\nadvTHANKSance,
In addition to startup time, I leave things running because my PC doubles as \na fax machine. \n\nHowever, this is off the original subject. I didn't get the replies on BIOS, \nCMOS, and DOS clock/date logic. All I know is that I've been running this way \nfor many months and it is only recently, the last month, that I have noticed \nthe intermittent clock problem. As I stated, it is not always the date that \ndoesn't roll forward, sometimes I notice that the clock is several minutes \nbehind where it ought to be. \n\nWhen unattended, the following are generally running minimized in Win 3.1:\n\nClock, WinFax Pro 3.0, Print Manager, MS-Word 1.1, File Manager, Program \nManager\n\nA random screen saver is generally running too.
Something to bear in mind is what the V in VLB stands for!\n\nV for Video - the origional intention of the bus was to speed up\nthe bus so that large memory to memory transfers would be faster.\nThis is espically useful in transfering data from main memory to\nvideo memory.\n\nSince there are usually 3 VLB slots card makers have been making \ncards to fit in the other two. \n\nHow about an VLB ethernet card? Move the data into the card at\n130 odd MB/s and then wait for it to tickle onto the net at\njust over 1Mb/s.\n\n[ Do do however free the local bus for other cards ]\n\nSome times you need fast busses and sometimes you don't!\n\n\nGuy

Fixed disk\nsectors are buffered by the controller, and transferring them to\nmemory with a 'rep insw' (or whatever the instruction is called) is\nquite efficient (single instruction, goes as fast as the\ncontroller/cpu know how to use the bus). Since the 286 wasn't cached,\nthe bus is likely a critical resource relative to CPU performance, and\nit's possible that DMA bus interference would cause as much or more\nloss of CPU cycles (for 'computing') as does the 'rep insw' sequence.\n\nThe floppy, on the other hand, is not buffered, so that using the CPU\nfor floppy data transfer (as was done on the PC Jr, by the way) really\ndoes stink.
One of the monitors I reviewed for the June issue of Windows Magazine was\nthe Mitsubishi.  I also reviewed a new Nanao, the F550iW, which has just\nbeen released.  Last year for the May '92 issue of Windows, I reviewed\nseveral monitors, including the Nanao T560i.  There's no question that the\nNanao monitors are the best available this year, just as they were last\nyear.  The difference between my ranking of the best in Windows and the\nranking in Windows Sources is due mainly to a difference in the testing\ncriteria and the scoring.  I used different tests than they did, and I\nscored differently.  There's nothing wrong with the Mitsubishi, and it\nscored very highly in my tests, but it was a few points shy of perfect.\n\nIncidentally, one of the things everyone should do when they're reading\nreviews of any product, whether it's monitors or mice, is to read the\ncriteria and methodology carefully.  Unless you know how the product\ntesting was done, and on what the scores are based, you can't possibly\nknow what they really mean.  Just seeing that I rank a monitor differently\nfrom Windows Sources is meaningless without knowing how we did the\nranking.  Likewise, it's impossible to tell whether a monitor will meet\nyour needs unless you know how we did the testing.  After all, some of\nwhat we do may not apply to you.  Likewise, some of what we do may apply\nmore closely in one review than in another.  You can't always tell\nanything from reading the 300 or so words of commentary we write if you\ndon't also understand the scoring.
Please reply via e-mail since this is job related: \n\nI have a Colorado Jumbo back-up system at one of my places of \nemployment and it has eaten two tapes by winding the tape off the spool.\n\nIs there an easy fix or is the tape drive fried?

Hello,\n\nI already tried our national news group without success.\n\nI tried to replace a friend's original IBM floppy disk in his PS/1-PC\nwith a normal TEAC drive.\nI already identified the power supply on pins 3 (5V) and 6 (12V), shorted\npin 6 (5.25"/3.5" switch) and inserted pullup resistors (2K2) on pins\n8, 26, 28, 30, and 34.\nThe computer doesn't complain about a missing FD, but the FD's light\nstays on all the time. The drive spins up o.k. when I insert a disk,\nbut I can't access it.\nThe TEAC works fine in a normal PC.\n\nAre there any points I missed?\n\nThank you.\n	Volkmar
Hi!\n\nWhen posting Winmark results, it is a good idea to give the version of \nWinBench that you used to obtain the scores, as well as the resolution that\nyou tested and the version of the drivers.
Thanks to all who responded to my original post.  I got the number for\nWestern Digital tech support and determined that I need to upgrade the\nBIOS to the Super BIOS.  It will handle hard drives with up to 16 read/\nwrite heads and up to 1024 cylinders.  The upgrade is $15, payable by\ncheck or money order.  Send to:\n\n	Western Digital Corporation\n	Technical Support Group\n	P.O. Box 19665\n	Irvine, CA  92713-9665\n\nThe Super BIOS is for any WD XT hard drive controller card in the\nWD1002 series.\n\nThe BIOS on my system would only handle up to 20mb drives.\n\nThe responses to my request for help follow my .sig.  Warning: It's long.\n\nKeith\n\n--\n_____________________________\n__-----____--___--__-----____	D.

I mess with this older\nstuff alot.   Kinda fun.  8)\n\n     First problem I can forsee is that the ST-251 will not be\ncompadible with that WD card unless it has the right bios rom.  \n\n    Check the numbers on it.  It should be the only non-smt chip on\nthe board.  Slightly below center, and left.    The bios should read \neither :     62-000042-015 or\n             62-000094-0x2\n\n     If the last 3 digits are 013, you got problems.\n\n\n    Looks right.   W5 and W7 are factory jumped (with a trace) between\npins 1 and 2 to select the primary controller address.\n\n\n    Looks right.\n  \n[art deleted]\n\n\n      I notice you left out the S1 jumper table settings.   Those are\nwhat control what drive the controller thinks it has.   If you have\nthe 62-000042-015 rom, set it like this:\n\n              5 + +    open\n              6 + +    open             \n              7 + +    open        \n              8 + +    open\n              4 + +    closed\n              3 + +    closed\n              2 + +    open\n              1 + +    open\n\n    Note:   those are how WD runs the numbers on the jumper block.\nTop to bottom.   +'s represent the jumper pins.    Pins 3,4, and 8\nselect the first drive setting (drive 0) and pins 1,2 and 7 select the\nsecond drive (drive 1).   \n\n      If you have the 62-000094 rom, it's a auto-config, and I'll have\nto look up how to do it... I don't have the big book right here.\n\n\n      See above.  You might have problems if the S1 jumpers are not\nright.   Also,  at the risk of being insulting, make sure the cables\nare on right and good. 8).    On the jumper on the 251, try moving it\nto the opposite side of the drive.    It's one or the other.   \n     The narrow data cable goes to J2.   I've thrown it on J3 a few\ntimes and banged my head for a day.....\n\n\n     Dunno.    IBM roms had to be later than 10/27/82.   A quick way\nto check is to boot dos and run debug.   Enter:\n       \n        -d f000:fff5 fffc    (the - is the debug prompt)\n   \n    This will return the rom date, if it's of any use.\n\n\n      If I oversimplified any of the above, I appologize.     It's\njust hard to know what caliber of person I'm talking to. 8).\n\n                     -->   Bob Valentine  <--  \n                  --> ravalent@mailbox.syr.edu <--  \n\n\n\nFrom chpp@unitrix.utr.ac.za Mon Apr  5 06:33:46 1993\nReceived: from unitrix.utr.ac.za by ponder (5.61/1.36)\n	id AA16194; Mon, 5 Apr 93 06:32:59 -0500\nReceived: by unitrix.utr.ac.za (Smail3.1.28.1 #1)\n	id m0nfpMA-0001X7C; Mon, 5 Apr 93 13:28 GMT\nMessage-Id: <m0nfpMA-0001X7C@unitrix.utr.ac.za>\nFrom: chpp@unitrix.utr.ac.za (Prof P.

Hi everyone,\n	I have a question regarding my stack on my pc.  I am programming \nin Turbo C 3.0 and my program is rather large (model large too).  I keep \ngetting errors that I am running out of memory after a while of running the \nprogram. When I compile the program, it says I have 4.45 meg of RAM so \nI can't seem to explain why it crashes.\n\nAll it is doing is running in a loop while the operator is idle and\nafter a while of sitting, it will screw up all the variables. This leads\nme to believe that my stack is filling up and overflowing.  \n\nDoes the program take memory up when it is calling void functions\nthat do not return anything??\n\n	I have been working on this problem for days and I would really\nappreciate any responce.  If this is not the correct newsgroup, I will\ngladly re-post, but this is the only I could find.
Except from clock frequency, what are the differences between the\nvarious types of 386 and 486 processors?\nThe following is a list with what I know (or perhaps only what I\nthink I know!). Can anybody extend & correct?\n\n\n80386:  True 32 bit processor.\n        (cache?)\n\n80386SX:  Emulates 80386 with a 16 bit bus.\n\n80486:  True 32 bit processor.\n        Internal mathematical coprocessor (Correct?)\n        Internal cache (Correct? How big?)\n        (extended instruction set in any way?)\n\n80486SX:  Probably sorta like 80486...\n\n80486DX:  Probably sorta like 80386...\n\n\nWell, it's not much, but I'm sure there is a lot of people out there\nwho can add a lot of information. Post or email as you prefer.
Most importantly, which Winbench version are you using?  On my local bus ATI\nGraphics Ultra Pro, I've gotten various Winbench scores from 15.8 million to\n31 million winmarks, depending on the version.  Winbench 2.5 gives the most\noptimistic scores, 3.11 gives the least.  A winmark rating is meaningless\nwithout a corresponding version number.\n\nDan

I have a DEC NT 486DX33 that has an Adaptec SCSI controller, hard disk\nand cd-rom drive. When I add a 3COMM Ethernet card (3C503) and reboot\nthe system I receive an error message that a boot device cannot be\nfound. Pull the 3COMM card and reboot, everything is fine. I've moved\nthe controller and 3COMM card to various slots, different positions\n(slot before the controller, slot after the controller) with the\nsame result.

Hi again!\n\n    Okay, am getting an old AT type together as well.\nAnyone have a 16 bit MFM HDC they'd like to sell? WD is preferred, but\nAdaptec and DTK are fine too......for that matter, almost anything\nso long as it works!
Hi!\n\nI'd like to switch my floppy drives so that my 3.5" b: drive becomes a:, while\nmy 5.25" a: becomes b:. I'm having a few problems, though.\n\nI know that the ribbon cable must be switched, as well as the CMOS settings, \nto reflect this change, and I think that I've done that correctly. However, the\ndrives do not operate correctly in this configuration. From the C:> prompt, if \nI type a:, the 5.25" drive light comes on; if I type b:, both the light for the\n5.25" and 3.5" drives come on.\n\nThere are some jumpers on each drive:\n5.25"  Label   Original Pos.   Pos. I changed it to\n        DS0      ON               OFF\n	DS1	 OFF		  ON\n	DS2	 ON		  ON\n	DS3	 OFF		  OFF\n	IO	 OFF		  OFF\n	MS1	 OFF		  OFF\n	D-R	 ON 		  ON\n	MS2	 ON		  ON\n	FG	 OFF		  OFF\n\n3.5"    DS0	 OFF		  ON\n	DS1	 ON		  OFF\n	DS2	 OFF		  OFF\n	DS3	 OFF		  OFF\n	MM	 ON		  ON\n	DC	 ON		  ON\n	MD	 OFF		  OFF\n	TTL/C-MO8 ON		  ON\n\n\nAny help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance.
The BusLogic cards have an OS/2 2.0 driver that does work with the March 2.1\nbeta. Support for the BusLogic cards is not included with OS/2 2.0 any longer.\nIf you wish to install the beta from the CD/ROM, you will need to REM out the\nAdaptec device drivers, as they have a nasty tendency to crash the BusLogic\ncards when OS/2 attempts to use them. (Thanks Adaptec!) \n\nSo you add the BusLogic drivers to the config.sys on the CD-ROM boot disk, and\nREM out the Adaptec drivers.\n\nThen you install the whole 1st half of the Beta.. and it won't work! IBM\nnicely copies in the Adaptec drivers once again. (Thanks IBM!) So.. REM out\nthe Adaptec drivers once more.. and reboot. If you have everything in the\nright order.. it will work.\n\nThings are pretty smooth through the rest of the installation.. except OS/2\nwill try to install the Adaptec SCSI drivers once again at the end... so.. you\nare off to more REM statements and more fun. \n\nThe BT 542Bk comes with drivers and costs the same as the Adaptec cards that\ndo not come with drivers. The DOS drivers work great. This card can easily be\nconfigured to work with 8 different sets of I/O ports (and you can use\nmultiple host adapters in one machine) If you get a new card.. it will also be\nable to support up to 8 GB drives under DOS.\n\nHope this helps..\n\n- Dan
Oh yeah, I just read in another newsgroup that the T560i uses a\n   high quality Trinitron tube than is in most monitors.(the Sony\n   1604S for example) and this is where the extra cost comes from.  It\n   is also where the high bandwidth comes from, and the fantastic\n   image, and the large image size, etc, etc...\n\nIt's also where the two annoying lines across the screen (one a third\ndown, the other two thirds down) come from.
It worked!!!\nThank you very much!
That is correct.  in DOS you can use IRQ 7 for your SB.You can't do\nthat under OS/2 because it uses IRQ 7 for the printer
Hi netters!\n	I'm looking for books that showing how to fix your own hardware problem.\n	Please let me know if you have any books in mind.  Thanks.
Hi netters!\n	I often have troubles with my PC and would like to fix it by myself.  Is \n	there any book that show you how to fix your own PC (hardware, monitor,\n	printer problems..etc).  Of course, no book would tell you the exact\n	problem with your PC, but at least it will give a general idea what\n	might be wrong.  Thanks so lot for your help.
[stuff deleted]\n\nThere are two 'problems':\n(1) the BIOS TOD routine which updates the BIOS clock uses only 1 bit\n    for day increment, so a second wrapping of the clock past midnight\n    will get lost if no one calls the BIOS to read the clock in the\n    meantime, and\n(2) the BIOS resets the day wrap indicator on the first 'get date'\n    call from ANYBODY (after the wrap indicator has been set). So\n    unless the first BIOS 'get date' call after midnight is done by\n    the DOS 'kernel' (which is the only part of DOS which knows how to\n    increment the date, the day wrap indication is normally lost.\nMy guess is that Kevin's 'menu' system uses BIOS calls to read the\nclock (in order to display the time), and is hence the entity which\ncauses the day wrap indication to get lost. Even if the 'menu' system\n'notices' the day 'wrap' (which I think is indicated by a non-zero\nvalue in AL), there really isn't any particularly good way to tell DOS\nabout it, so that DOS can update the day. The menu system 'should' use\nDOS calls to get the time, which would cause the DOS 'kernel' to do\nthe BIOS call, and the wrap indicator would hence be processed\nproperly.  Possibly, though, the 'menu' system can't easily use DOS\ncalls for time, because DOS is not reentrant, and perhaps time\nincrementing ofters occur while the 'menu' system is 'inside' some\nother DOS call.
Well, I was told that my last message came through without anything\nin it, so I'll try again.\n\nI have a Leading Edge 386SX 16 with a flaky motherboard and a friend\ngame me one to replace it, but he didn't have any docs for the \nmother board.  It's a CHEERTRON board with Award bios and has a   \nsticker on it that says VI 1   T1 3  T2 3  on it.  I can tell what\nmost of the switches on the blue blocks mean.  except FDC and\nSH, but I have no idea about all the jumpers.  I've replaced hard\ndrives and modems and installed math co-processes, but this is a\nbit out of my league and without the docs, I'm really lost.\n\nIf anyone could give me some help on this, I'd really appreciate\nit.  I don't get on news regularly, so if you can help, please\ne-mail me at passman@world.std.com\n\nThanks.
Do all SCSI cards for DOS systems require a separate device driver to be loaded\ninto memory for each SCSI device hooked up?  Will this also be true of the 32-bit\nOS's?\n\nThanks.
Windows: The recent reviews have all shown that the P9000 cards are\n	 significantly faster doing Windows than the ATI card.\n\nVGA:	 The recent reviews have all shown that the P9000 cards they looked\n	 at are significantly slower doing VGA than the ATI card.  About\n	 1/2 the speed, as I recall.\n\n	 The big question for me is the Orchid V9000 card.  Each of the \n	 P9000 cards tested so far has had the W5186 to do VGA.  Orchid\n	 is the only one I know about (I don't know about AMI) that uses\n	 the W5286 for VGA.  That is reportedly faster.\n	 \n	 I would like to know whether the Orchid card can do VGA as fast as\n	 the ATI card.  If so, it would appear to be a formidable competitor.\n	 (Advertised prices are about the same for the two cards.)\n\nSomeone in this group posted a little while back that they were getting an\nOrchid V9000 card -- has that card arrived?  What do the benchmarks look\nlike?\n\nAlso, is the AMI P9000-based card real?  What does it use for VGA?  Speed?
Would someone please email me the pinout for a PS/2 6-pin mini DIN mouse\nport?  I'm trying to make an adapter for a serial mouse, and the dealer who\nknows what adapter works with the mouse I bought doesn't have it in stock.\nI have several different adapters, but none of them make sense based on\nwhat sketchy information I have about the port (they have connections to\n"reserved" pins).

However, just in case\nsomething went wrong, I'm going to describe some of the changes needed\nto get Windows 3.1 working with the 1542.  Also, you may have noticed\nthat installing Windows 3.1 makes your PC run much slower, even when\nyou're not running Windows; methods of speeding it up are discussed in\nthe section called, "Windows 3.1 runs slowly".\n\n\n* MSDOS configuration:\n\n     The Windows install program adds the SmartDrive disk cache to your\nCONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.  If you follow the instructions,\nyou'll notice that you'll need to use double-buffering with SmartDrive\n(this is the default setup).  You'll also notice that your system runs\nmuch, much slower -- in both Windows *AND* MSDOS.  See the section\ncalled, "Windows 3.1 runs slowly", for some ways of speeding your system\nup.\n\n\n* Windows configuration:\n\n     To get the Adaptec 1542 to work with Windows, make sure that the\n"[388Enh]" section of the SYSTEM.INI file contains the entry:\n\n	VirtualHDIRQ=Off\n\nI believe that the Windows install program automatically adds this entry\nto SYSTEM.INI, but I'm not sure.  If this doesn't work for you, you\nmight want to try adding some more lines:\n\n	VirtualHDIRQ=Off\n	SystemROMBreakPoint=false\n	EMMExclude=A000-CFFF\n\n(You probably don't need the above lines, though.)  The\n"SystemROMBreakPoint" entry is used to enable support for memory\nmanagers like QEMM/386MAX (only needed if you use such programs).\n\n\n* Windows 3.1 runs slowly:\n\n     Once you do get Windows 3.1 running with the 1542, chances are that\nyour system is running much slower than before.  If it's not, it's\nprobably because:\n\n     1. You happen to be using ASPI4DOS.SYS version 3.1 in your\n	CONFIG.SYS file.  Congratulations -- this appears to be a\n	winning solution.\n\n     2. You are very lucky.  Whether your luck will hold out remains to\n	be seen ....\n\nIf your system is running much slower than before, this is almost\ndefinitely caused by Smartdrive with double-buffering.  According to the\nWindows documentation, and the Microsoft technical note #Q81808\n("SMARTDrive Double Buffering Required with ASPI4DOS.SYS"), you must use\nSmartdrive with double-buffering enabled.  While this works, it really\nslows down your PC; I once estimated that this slowed my PC down by a\nfactor of 5 (FIVE).  As I consider this unacceptable, I looked for other\nsolutions.\n\n     Unfortunately, you cannot just disable double-buffering.  If you\ndo, Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode will not work, and you might even\ndestroy the contents of your hard disk by trying to run Windows 3.1.\nWhat you can do is one of the following:\n\n     1. Use other drivers that provide double-buffering.  It is my\n	opinion that the unbelievable slowness in Smartdrive is caused\n	either by horribly inefficient double-buffering, or by a bug in\n	Smartdrive.\n\n     2. Use a driver that provides "VDS" services ("VDS" stands for\n	"Virtual DMA Services").  This is a standard, which is supported\n	by Windows 3.1, that allows bus-mastering disk controllers (like\n	the 1542) to work with Windows.\n\n     After trashing my hard disk countless times, I found the following\nsolutions, none of which require using Smartdrive (note, however, that I\nam now getting occasional parity errors, which are probably *NOT* caused\nby these solutions, but might be -- see below).  While the following\ndoes not require Smartdrive, using some kind of disk cache utility is\nstrongly recommended, as this makes Windows run much, much faster:\n\n1. If you do not have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, or you do not need ASPI\n   functions (for controlling a CDROM, tape drive, more than two\n   physical hard disks, etc.), you can add the SCSIHA.SYS driver to your\n   CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:\n\n	DRIVER=c:\SCSIHA.SYS /V386\n\n   (Windows needs the "/V386" option.)  This driver MUST be loaded into\n   LOW memory (it cannot be loaded into high memory), and it occupies\n   about 16-20K.  As of November 1992, the SCSIHA.SYS driver could be\n   obtained from the Adaptec BBS at (408)-945-7727 (hopefully, it's\n   still there).\n\n2. If you need ASPI functions and have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, version\n   3.0 or 3.0a, you can use both the ASPI4DOS.SYS and SCSIHA.SYS drivers\n   in your CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:\n\n	DRIVER=c:\ASPI4DOS.SYS\n	DRIVER=c:\SCSIHA.SYS /V386\n\n   Amazingly enough, the SCSIHA.SYS driver can also be loaded high\n   (assuming you have DOS 5.0); I would have thought that this would\n   crash my system, but it doesn't.  I asked Adaptec's technical support\n   about this, and they said that loading SCSIHA.SYS high should be fine\n   as long as ASPI4DOS.SYS is loaded LOW.\n\n   On my system, NOT using SCSIHA.SYS with ASPI4DOS 3.0a would\n   occasionally cause Windows 3.1 to crash upon restarting or exiting\n   Windows, with the additional result of a corrupted disk (some of my\n   C:\WINDOWS\*.GRP files would be corrupted).  For me, these crashes\n   usually occurred while making a different program from PROGMAN.EXE\n   the default Windows shell, and vice-versa.  This is the reason\n   SCSIHA.SYS may be necessary.\n\n   I have absolutely no idea if SCSIHA.SYS is necessary with versions of\n   ASPI4DOS earlier than 3.0.\n\n   Note that many people can use ASPI4DOS 3.0 or 3.0a without\n   SCSIHA.SYS; they do not seem to have any problems at all.  I consider\n   these people lucky.  Others, like me, have had all sorts of problems.\n\n3. In my opinion, the best, but not necessarily the easiest, solution is\n   to upgrade to ASPI4DOS 3.1.  The SCSIHA.SYS driver is no longer\n   needed.  Unfortunately, while you could get previous ASPI4DOS\n   upgrades from the Adaptec BBS, the ASPI4DOS 3.1 driver is not\n   available from the Adaptec BBS.  As far as I know, there are only\n   three ways to get a copy:\n\n      * You can buy the new (as of November 1992) Adaptec EZ SCSI driver\n	kit, which supposedly includes ASPI4DOS 3.1 as well as other\n	drivers, such as CDROM drivers.  I believe the list price is\n	around $75.\n\n      * If you already have a copy of an older version of ASPI4DOS, you\n	can supposedly contact Adaptec to upgrade it to EZ SCSI for\n	around $30.\n\n      * A copy of ASPI4DOS 3.1 is included in Central Point PC Tools 8.0\n	for MSDOS.  Note that the documentation and driver are stored in\n	different directories.  Note further that only ASPI4DOS is\n	included; the CDROM drivers and drivers to support more than two\n	hard disks are not included.  This is where I obtained my copy\n	of ASPI4DOS 3.1.\n\nNote, however, that I am now getting occasional parity errors with\nWindows.  In all probability, defective hardware in my PC is causing\nthis, as I upgraded my motherboard just after I found the above\nsolutions.  However, because these parity errors occur only during disk\naccesses, there is a very small, but definite, possibility that the\nparity errors are driver-related (for example, changing the bus on/off\ntiming for certain disk transfers might cause this).  I've run various\nmemory tests for hours at a time, and these tests have found no\nproblems.  This problem is probably caused by memory with marginal\ntiming requirements, which cause parity errors during disk transfers\n(this is why the memory tests didn't find any problems -- the problems\nshow up only under disk I/O).  However, I'm mentioning this just in case\nit isn't a hardware problem.\n\n\n***** Floppy-controller-based tape backup devices:\n\n     There are two possible problems with using the Adaptec 1542 with a\nfloppy-controller-based tape backup device, such as the Colorado Memory\nSystems Jumbo 250:\n\n1. Tape backups/restores can take a very long time.  The tape drive\n   constantly starts, stops, starts, stops, etc.\n\n2. Tape operations may be erratic, or encounter too many tape errors.\n   (This problem might be caused by defective hardware on my 1542.\n   However, I've heard of other people having similar problems, and so\n   I'm mentioning this just in case it is not a hardware problem on my\n   1542.)\n\n\n* Tape backups/restores take a long time:\n\n     If you have a floppy-controller-based tape backup device, you may\nhave to adjust the Adaptec 1540/1542 "bus on/off timing" for best\nresults when using the tape drive.  Normally, while doing a tape backup\nor restore, the tape drive motor should be continuously running, with\nonly an occasional pause.  However, the default bus timing on the\nAdaptec 1540/1542 may cause the tape drive motor to start and stop,\nstart and stop, every few seconds.  This causes needless wear to the\ntape and tape drive (however, note that a dirty tape head or a defective\ntape drive can also cause this -- make sure your tape heads are clean).\nThis also causes the tape backup or restore to take much, much longer\nthan necessary.\n\n     The problem here is that these tape backups use the floppy DMA to\ntransfer data in memory to/from the tape drive, and the Adaptec uses DMA\nto transfer data in memory to/from the hard disk.  The floppy DMA needs\nto feed data to the tape drive at a certain rate; if the tape drive is\nnot fed data quickly enough by the floppy DMA, the tape drive stops,\nrewinds a bit, and restarts (once enough data is eventually fed to it).\nThe default bus timing on the Adaptec (which is really DMA timing) is\n"too large".  For example, when a backup is done, data has to be\ntransferred from a hard disk to memory, and then from memory to the\ntape.  Because the default timing on the Adaptec "hogs" the memory too\nmuch (too much time is spent transferring data from a hard disk to\nmemory), not enough time is spent transferring data from memory to the\ntape drive.  As a result, the tape drive constantly starts and stops,\nbecause data is not fed to it quickly enough.\n\n     The solution is to change the Adaptec's bus on/off timing.  The\ndefault factory setting is 11 microseconds on, and 5 microseconds off.\nThe "bus on" timing needs to be lowered to 2-4 microseconds.  This can\nbe done in one of two ways:\n\n* If you have ASPI4DOS, you can use the "/n" option.  For example, I use\n  a "bus on" timing of 4 microseconds, which means that I use the\n  following line in my CONFIG.SYS file:\n\n	DEVICE=c:\aspi4dos.sys /n4\n\n  Note that there is NO space between the "/n" and the "4".\n\n* If you don't have ASPI4DOS, your only recourse is to try to find a\n  program called "SETSCSI.EXE", which is very difficult to find.  The\n  reason is that Adaptec, for reasons of their own, does not seem to\n  want this widely distributed.  I once asked someone who worked for\n  Adaptec, and they asked me to not upload it anywhere.  If you have\n  anonymous ftp access to the Internet, you could try using archie to\n  hunt down a copy; I believe that there are a couple of sites that have\n  it.  If you do find a copy, you run it like so:\n\n	setscsi -n:4\n\n  This adjusts the "bus on" timing to 4 microseconds.  Running\n  SETSCSI.EXE without any arguments resets the bus timing back to the\n  factory defaults.\n\n  Note that it seems that you cannot use SETSCSI.EXE if you use\n  ASPI4DOS; SETSCSI.EXE crashed my system if ASPI4DOS was loaded.  I\n  could use SETSCSI.EXE with SCSIHA.SYS, however.\n\nDo not lower the "bus on" timing below 2 microseconds, or increase it\nabove 11 microseconds.  If you lower it too low, the hard disk\nthroughput will suddenly drop; your system will feel slower.  For me, 4\nmicroseconds works fine.  This value may work fine for you, or you may\nhave to adjust it downwards a little.\n\n     Once you've lowered the "bus on" timing, tape backups and restores\nshould run faster.\n\n     Also, do not experiment with the bus on/off times (with the other\noptions that I have intentionally not described), unless you know what\nyou are doing.  Bad combinations can cause parity errors and worse, by\nstarving memory refresh.\n\n     A program called BUSTIFIX.EXE exists on the Adaptec BBS.  Unless\nthis has been upgraded since I last checked (which has been a while),\nthis is a self-extracting archive containing a batch file and a couple\nof other files.  This batch file was supposed to allow one to set the\nbus on/off times for the 1540/1542 and others.  However, when I tried\nrunning this program with my 1542A, my system crashed.  At the time, I\nwas running SCSIHA.SYS, and I didn't check to see if there was a\nconflict with it.  Maybe this old program works only with the 1542B,\nalthough the docs say that it works with the 1542A?\n\n\n* Erratic tape operations or too many tape errors:\n\n     This "problem" may or may not exist.  Although it existed on my\nsystem, a hardware problem just on my particular 1542 could cause it.\nHowever, I've heard of other people having similar problems, and so I'm\nmentioning this just in case it isn't a hardware problem just on my\n1542.\n\n     Symptoms of this "problem", which persists even after cleaning the\ntape head:\n\n1. Backing up to tape encounters "unusable sector detected" errors,\n   resulting in an aborted tape backup.\n\n2. Tape backup works, but the tape compare fails.\n\n3. The tape drive starts, stops, starts, stops, etc. much too often.\n   Unlike the above-mentioned problem ("Tape backups/restores take a\n   long time"), where the tape drive starts and stops every few seconds,\n   this kind of starting/stopping occurs every few 10-20 seconds or so.\n\n4. Fastback Plus 3.1 does not find/see any tape backup devices.  Other\n   programs, like Central Point Backup and the CMS Jumbo software\n   (assuming that you have a CMS Jumbo 250 tape drive) can find/see the\n   tape drive, but Fastback Plus 3.1 cannot.\n\n5. Too many tape read errors.\n\n     Although I do not know what is causing this problem, I discovered\nthat using a different floppy controller solves it.  A few months ago, I\nupgraded my motherboard, which contained an integrated floppy\ncontroller.  As I already had a floppy controller on the 1542, I\ninitially disabled the motherboard floppy controller.  After a while, I\ndecided to try disabling the 1542 floppy controller and using the one on\nthe motherboard.  When I did this, the tape drive (a CMS Jumbo 250)\nreliability increased dramatically, and Fastback Plus 3.1 was suddenly\nable to find and use the tape drive.\n\n     I don't know if this was caused by a hardware problem on my 1542.\nOn the one hand, the floppy drives worked great when they were attached\nto the 1542, which seems to say that there was nothing wrong with the\n1542.  On the other hand, the tape drive didn't work well attached to\nthe 1542 floppy controller, but it did work when attached to a different\ncontroller; this could be an indication of a hardware problem on my\n1542.  I did change floppy drive cables, and so it is conceivable that\nthe problem was in the cables.  I don't know what the cause really is;\nhowever, if you're having similar problems, you might want to consider\ntrying a new floppy controller.\n\n\n***** Sound cards:\n\n     Many popular sound cards can play or record digitized sound, and\nthis is typically done using DMA.  Like the tape drive DMA, the\nAdaptec's DMA can conflict with the sound card DMA.  Unlike that of the\ntape DMA, this "conflict" usually manifests itself as a parity error\n(your system crashes with a parity error message).  What happens is\nthat, data is being transferred so quickly by the sound card and the\nAdaptec, memory refresh cannot occur quickly enough, which causes a\nparity error.  Usually, getting a parity error means that there is a\nhardware problem with your system; in this case, however, the parity\nerror is not a symptom of bad hardware.\n\n     I've found that such parity errors typically occur while recording\ndigitized sound, and the chances of such errors increase as you increase\nthe recording fidelity (e.g., higher sampling rate, recording in stereo,\nrecording using 16-bits instead of 8, etc.).\n\n     Like the tape drive solution, the solution here is to lower the\nAdaptec's "bus on" timing.  See the section on tape drives for\ninformation on how this is done.  Note, however, that this may or may\nnot solve the problem; it may only reduce the probability of a parity\nerror.  The software used to record digitized sound can greatly affect\nthis problem (i.e., some software is inefficient).  Disk caches, the\nspeed of your hard disk, and the amount of disk fragmentation can also\naffect this.\n\n\n***** Miscellaneous info:\n\n     This section contains miscellaneous hints, tips, and rumors.  Much\nof it is merely information that I've heard or read about, and have not\nverified.  I believe that the following information is correct, but I'm\nnot sure.  Use it at your own risk.\n\n* With QEMM 6.00, 6.01, and 6.02, you need to specify the "DB="\n  parameter (e.g., "DB=2"), unless you are using the ASPI4DOS driver.\n  If you don't, QEMM will crash/hang at bootup.  Although the QEMM\n  manual mentions this, the install program does not seem to detect that\n  a 1542 is present and automatically add this option to the QEMM\n  command line (at least, this occurred with the QEMM 6.00 install\n  program -- I haven't tested any other version).  Earlier versions of\n  QEMM probably need this parameter, but I'm not sure (I've never used a\n  version earlier than 6.00).\n\n  If you use ASPI4DOS, you do not need to give QEMM the "DB=" parameter.\n\n* Some or all versions of the 1542 do not support hard disks over one\n  gigabyte in size.  To support hard disks with capacities over 1GB, you\n  need to get a new ROM BIOS from Adaptec.  I'm not sure if this is\n  still true of the latest 1542Bs being sold by Adaptec.\n\n* To connect a CDROM drive to the 1542, you need a SCSI CDROM drive and\n  some drivers.  Note that some CDROM drives have proprietary interfaces\n  (non-SCSI); these drives cannot be used with the 1542.  You have three\n  choices for CDROM drivers (I have no idea how well the following\n  solutions work, or even if they work -- the following is secondhand\n  information):\n\n     1. You can buy Adaptec's EZ SCSI driver package, which lists for\n	something like $75.  If you already have older Adaptec drivers,\n	you can supposedly upgrade to EZ SCSI for around $30.  Contact\n	Adaptec for details.  The EZ SCSI package supposedly contains\n	everything that you need.\n\n     2. You can buy the CorelSCSI! driver package, which is made by the\n	same people that make CorelDRAW!  This package contains CDROM\n	drivers, SCSI tape drivers, WORM drivers, etc.  I do not know\n	the list price, but I've seen this package sold for around\n	$80-$90.  Note that CorelSCSI! does not come with the ASPI4DOS\n	driver, which is needed.  If you do not already have ASPI4DOS,\n	you may be better off getting Adaptec's EZ SCSI instead.\n\n     3. [This method is obsolete, as the following drivers have been\n	obsoleted by Adaptec's EZ SCSI kit, but I'm mentioning it in\n	case someone already has these drivers.]  You can use the\n	drivers in the Adaptec ASW-1410 kit (ASPI4DOS) and the ASW-410\n	kit (ASPI CDROM drivers).  You will have to get a copy of\n	MSCDEX.EXE (a high-level CDROM driver), if it is not included in\n	the ASW-410 kit, but this is available from several bulletin\n	boards.\n\n* To use a SCSI tape drive with the 1542, you need software that knows\n  how to talk to a SCSI tape drive.  Software that I've heard about are\n  (again, like the above section on CDROM drives, I have no idea how\n  well the following solutions work, or even if they work -- the\n  following is secondhand information):\n\n     1. Central Point PC Tools 8.0 for MSDOS supposedly supports a large\n	number of SCSI tape drives.  It comes with SCSI drivers\n	(ASPI4DOS 3.1) as well as Central Point Backup.\n\n     2. The CorelSCSI! driver package contains a SCSI tape backup\n	program (see the above section on CDROM drives for more\n	details).  However, note that CorelSCSI! does not come with, but\n	requires, ASPI4DOS.\n\n* I've seen advertisements that sell the 1542 in three configurations:\n\n     1. 1542 SCSI controller with hard disk ROM BIOS.\n     2. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and Adaptec ASPI drivers.\n     3. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS, Adaptec ASPI drivers, and\n	CorelSCSI! drivers/programs.\n\n  I imagine that Adaptec now sells the 1542 in a fourth configuration:\n\n     4. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and EZ SCSI drivers (including ASPI\n	drivers).\n\n* Those people who use Unix might be interested in a version of GNU tar\n  for MSDOS that talks to a SCSI tape drive via the ASPI4DOS driver (you\n  need this driver before you can use this program).  I've never used\n  this version of GNU tar, but I've heard that it works (I don't know\n  how well, though).  If you have anonymous ftp access to the Internet,\n  a copy can be found on wsmr-simtel20.army.mil and mirror sites:\n\n	PD1:<MSDOS.DSKUTL>\n	ASPIBIN.ZIP  67841 920131 Gnu Tar for SCSI tape drives, Adaptec 154xx\n	ASPIPAT.ZIP  21206 920131 Patches for ASPIBIN relative to Gnu Tar 1.10\n	ASPISRC.ZIP 221370 920131 Src for Gnu Tar for SCSI tape, Adaptec ctrlr\n\n  I have no idea if a copy can be found on Compuserve; UNIXFORUM might\n  have it, if any forum does.\n\n* As far as MSDOS is concerned, the 1542A and the 1542B controllers are\n  the same; with MSDOS, the 1542A should work as well as the 1542B.\n  However, the hardware for these two boards is not 100% identical, and\n  there is at least one (NON-MSDOS) program that initially did not work\n  with a 1542A, but did work with a 1542B (BSD386 -- a 386 version of\n  BSD Unix).\n\n* In case anyone's curious, here's an edited copy of my CONFIG.SYS file:\n\n	FILES=40\n	BUFFERS=40\n	BREAK=ON\n	STACKS=10,256\n	DEVICE=c:\sys\dev\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4\n	DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF\n	DOS=HIGH,UMB\n	DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys\n	DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE\n	shell = c:\dos\command.com /p\n\n  Note that I'm using QEMM and ASPI4DOS 3.1.  If I were using ASPI4DOS\n  3.0 or 3.0a, I'd probably have to use a CONFIG.SYS that looked like:\n\n	FILES=40\n	BUFFERS=40\n	BREAK=ON\n	STACKS=10,256\n	DEVICE=c:\sys\dev\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4\n	DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF\n	DOS=HIGH,UMB\n	DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\scsiha.sys /V386\n	DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys\n	DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE\n	shell = c:\dos\command.com /p\n\n  If I weren't using ASPI4DOS, I'd probably use something that looked\n  like:\n\n	FILES=40\n	BUFFERS=40\n	BREAK=ON\n	STACKS=10,256\n	DEVICE=c:\sys\dev\scsiha.sys /V386\n	DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DB=32 DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF\n	DOS=HIGH,UMB\n	DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys\n	DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE\n	shell = c:\dos\command.com /p\n\n  However, if I used a floppy-controller-based tape drive, or if I\n  planned to record high-quality sound from a sound card, I would still\n  need some way of changing the Adaptec's bus on/off times.  The first\n  two versions of CONFIG.SYS take care of this, but this last version\n  doesn't.

Yes only your $00.02.

H E L P !\n\nI have  a problem in which I'm getting increasing frustrated every day...\n\nSome background about my PC:\n\n- American Megatrend BIOS (clone 386 SX) with 32M of RAM\n- config.sys file:\n\n	device=c:\dos\himem.sys\n	dos=high,umb\n	device=c:\windows\emm386.exe noems\n	files=30\n	buffers=30\n	stack=9,256\n\n- autoexec.bat file is using smartdrv.exe +c\n- CMOS set up is running 0 wait state on read and write cache ram.\n\nThe problem: APPLICATION ERROR from WIN31\n\nI started off with a newly installed WIN31 and then installed EXCEL.\nRun excel, no problem. A permanent swap file of size 18K was in place\nfor windows.\n\nOk, I then proceed to install Norton Desktop\nfor Windows version 2.0. No problem with the installation. I also\nallow NDW to alter my autoexec.bat(with the nav running on c:).\nThe problem came when I try to (bring up excel or if excel is running\nand right in the middle of it - like click a selection with the mouse)\nfrom the desktop.\nFirst of all, I always get the application error screen followed by\nanother application error screen with various different messages. The\nfollowing are some of them:\n\n- Stack fault, by TC1024.DRV at address 0001:XXXX where XXXX is some\n  number. (TC1024.DRV is the VGA driver provided by the manufacture)\n- General protection fault, by ndw.exe at the same address\n- Segment load failure, by ndw.exe at same address\n\nSome how, the address flagged was always 0001:something. What is address\n0001:XXXX means? \n\nI have absolutely on idea what this mean. I tried commented out the\nTSR programs from autoexec.bat, no help.\n\nIs it something to do with the emm386 setup which is not telling\nWIN31 what it suppose to know. Looks like the application is crossing\nmemory boundary when it is being loaded or while it is running.\n\nPlease reply if you have any idea or suggestion. I'm willing to try\nanything.
Hello fellow netlanders.\n\nI have a Genius Mouse model GM-6, but no driver for it.\nIt's a 3 button mouse. If anyone that;s got one of theese\ncould mail me a driver (config.sys or autoexec.bat) I would\nbe very happy.
With a sound card on interrupt 5, two serial ports (one for modem on i4,\none for Miracle Piano on i3) and a printer port on i7, I have run out of\nlow interrupts.  What I would like is a mouse port with an interrupt of\n10, 11, or 12 (which ever interrupt the PS/2 mouse port uses) in in ISA\ni486 computer.  I called technical support of Microsoft, Logitech, & ATI\n(checked what interrupts the mouse port on the ATI video cards can use)\nand they all said the only interrupts possible on these cards was ones\nlower than 7.  Does anyone know of any board for an ISA bus which will\nallow a mouse port (or even a serial port) with high interrupts?
Hello all,\n\nYou, the Net, are my last resort, or I'll just change my job :-)\nThis might be a FAQ (e.g. mixing controllers) but haven't seen any.\n\nSys: 486/33, AMI BIOS, and your run-of-the mill multi-I/O card with\nserials/paral/floppies and \n	- IDE controller "clone" Gw2760-EX\n		there are no jumpers affecting the HD or ctrller :-( \n	- Quantum ProDrive LPS (3" 105M type 47: 755cyl, 16hds, 17spt).\n\nPb: I want to bring in this (2nd hand, neat price):\n	- Maxtor XT-B380E (~330M, <15ms, BIOS type 1, ctrller manages\n		the real geom: 1630cyl, 8hds, 52spt)\n	- Western Digital WD1007V-SE1 ESDI ctrller: no floppies.\n		(jumpers set IRQ 14/15, hw port addr 1F0/170,\n		and BIOS addr CC00/C800, and other floppy/format stuff)\n\nGoal: have the WD ESDI as a secondary/controller and have both disks \nsimultaneously working. Being able to boot from the ESDI too would be \na nice bonus but is not expected.\n\nUltimate goal: have room for Linux et al.\nEx of scheme I have in mind: boot from IDE (HD or floppy) and mount\nthe ESDI as root. Not booting from ESDI, or even from HD, is acceptable.\n\nI have tried numerous (all!!) combinations to no avail. They work alone,\nor can coexist witout hang-ups but can't access the ESDI or the IDE, \ndepending on setup/jumpers.\n\nUseful suggestions might be:\n- How do I tell the BIOS setup about two ctrllers (I guess the 2nd HD\nis expected to hang off the same ctrller as the 1st).\n- Do I need some driver to make it work?\n- --- " --- some new BIOS/chip for any of these cards?\n- do I have to buy another controller to make them HDs happy? IDE\nis cheaper; ESDI is hard to find and rather costly. I'm not \nrich or I wouldnt' try to scavenge around, so soft slns are preferred.\n- adapters of some sort; I can hold a soldering iron, and can change\na chip or put a jumper!\n\nAlso useful:\n- BBS or Hot-line of Western Digital.\n- ftp archives with relevant info.\n- expert stores in Toronto, Ontario area (that would be a miracle! haven't\nseen any really knowledgeable ppl in a while)\n- any hints into inner workings of the system ... \n- anything else that helped you in similar situations (prayers :-) )\n\nDirect or posted replies are ok.\n	Many thanks,\n			Cat.
Does anybody out there have or used to have an HD controller from\nPerstor System Inc. (which is out of business I believe)?  My friend\nreceived an old PC which happens to have such a controller and I am\nhaving a hard time trying to add another HD to the card.\n\n\nI believe the controller is supposed to control MFM drives as RLL\ndrives?? \n\n\nHere the model info on the card, but any other similar model will\nprobably do.\n\n\n\nPerstor System Inc.\nModel: PS 180-16FN\nRev: 2.2 ECN 9-21\n\n\nI would appreciate your reply directly to my e-mail address below.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nRay  (rngai@oracle.com)
There is a benchmark program called COMPTEST said CYRIX CPUs have a bug\nso they cannot run the program. Also may be NeXTSTEP 486?\n\n						regards,
This may be the dumbest question of the year, but is there a\nway to 'piggyback' or expand a 6-slot motherboard (all 16-bit)\nto get the usual 8?  My case has slots for 8, and I'd like to\nget a scanner, but with all my other cards I'm already max'd out!\nI'm hoping that a simple solution exists, e.g. an adapter that turns\none slot into three.  I don't mind if it turns it into 8-bit slots,\nas I can put my I/O card, MIDI card, and Soundblaster card there.\nMy other cards are 16 bit (IDE/Floppy, SVGA, modem).\n\nIf there is such an expander, does that screw up performance of\neverything else?  I'd hate to buy a new motherboard! :-(
Help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My computer from Gateway is freezing up on me.\nGateway tech support couldn't help me. They want more specifics on when\nit freezes up.  I DID!  Anyway, here it is.  If the keyboard is left idle\nin Dos for more than 15 minutes, I can type on the command line, but as \nsoon as I hit a carraige return, the computer locks up.  This will happen\nalmost every time, whether I've just booted up, reset, or finished using a\ndos program.  Everything works fine if I don't let it sit.  Windows is a\ndifferent story.  If I let the machine sit while in windows for 15 minutes\nor more, it does not freeze up.  However,  I do get frequent application\nerrors that kick me out of an application unexpectedly, losing my work.\nI just don't know if this is a hardware or software problem.

This is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives \nwhen performing diagnostics.\n   There are four links, LK1, LK2, LK4 and LK5, adjacent to the 40 way \ninterface connector. They have the following functions and are described \nin order as viewed from the end of the drive, with the first jumper \ndescribed nearest the 40 way interface connector.\n\nLK2: LED \n     When fitted, this jumper connects the LED drive to pin 39 of the\n     interface. This allows a LED to be connected to the interface. An\n     external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with\n     the LED when this option is selected. The value of the resistor will\n     be dependant on the LED type chosen but will be in the range of 130\n     Ohms ot 220 Ohms.\n\nLK1: Dual Drives\n     This jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single\n     bus. It fallows communication across the 40 way interface connector,\n     indicating, to the Master drive, the presence of a Slave.\n\nLK4: Master\n     When fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a Master. If\n     there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be\n     jumpered in this way.\n\nLK5: IOChRdy\n     When fitted this connects the IOChRdy signal to the drive, it is \n     fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher\n     data transfer rate than the drive i.e. greater than 4 MBytes per\n     second when using 1:1 interleave. This jumper is not normally \n     fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than 4 MBytes per\n     second.\n\n   There are four possible Master/Slave configurations in which a drive(s)\nmay be jumpered:\n\n     Master, single drive with LED on interface		LK2 & LK4 fitted.\n     Master, single drive without LED on interface	LK4 only fitted.\n     Master, dual drive without LED on interface	LK4 & LK1 fitted.\n     Slave, dual drive without LED on interface		No jumpers fitted.\n     Master, dual drive with LED on interface		LK4, LK1 & LK2 fitted.\n     Slave, dual drive with LED on interface		LK2 only fitted.\n\n   The Master drive will delay power-up for approximately two seconds to\nreduce power surges in applications where dual drives are used.\n\n   The other connections for a LED will be found close to the 28 way \nconnector at the other end of the drive. This LED driver is not affected\nby the link options. An internal current limiting resistor is on the \ndrive for this LED driver. Refer to the product specification for further\ndetails.\n\n\n\n\n***************************   S E A G A T E   *************************\n\nThere is a list of most Seagate HD (including MFM, SCSI, ESDIand IDE) on\nevery Simtel mirror under\n\n/msdos/dskutl/1seagate.zip\n\nIt contains info about the following drives:\n\n	    st1144a	st138a	    st274a	st3283a\nst1057a     st1156a	st1400a     st280a	st351ax\nst1090a     st1162a	st1401a     st3051a	st9051a\nst1102a     st1186a	st1480a     st3096a	st9077a\nst1111a     st1201a	st157a	    st3120a	st9096a\nst1126a     st1239a	st2274a     st3144a	st9144a\nst1133a     st125a	st2383a     st325ax\n\n\n*********************	T E A C   **************\n\nModel: SD-3105\n\n                Cyls.

I am trying to help a friend of mine get the second serial port on his DTK\nI/O Plus II card working and it does not want to cooperate. The documentation\nis no help at all. As an example, it says 'The serial port can be changed to\nCOM2 from COM1 by moving jumpers.' but does not say what jumpers to move!! :-(\n\nThere are 2 banks of jumpers. The first one is labeled as follows:\nC1\nC2\nS2\nP2\nP1\nG\n\nThe second bank is labeled "IRQ" and has the following labels:\n5C\n5S\n4\n3\n3S\n2C\n2S\n\nI have determined that the C1 & C2 jumpers tell it to address the first\nserial port as COM1 or COM2. The P1,P2 jumpers tell it to use the printer\nport as LPT1 or LPT2. I am guessing that the "G" enables the game port and\nthe "S2" SHOULD enable the second serial port, but I can't get it to work. I\nhave tried numerous setting on the IRQ bank without success. I assume that\nthis bank must tell the card which IRQ's to use for both ports, but I don;t\nknow how.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!\n\nEBD\n-- \nElliot Dierksen   "Is that a real poncho... I mean is that a Mexican poncho or\n                   is that a Sears  poncho?

I was just reading in PC Magazine that the peripherals in a PC with an\nISA bus can only access 16MB of memory.  Also, that some video cards on\nthe ISA bus look for a memory aperture to map their memory to.  So that\nif I wanted to put 16MB of memory on my PC, my video card wouldn't have\nanywhere to map it's memory to.\n\nCan someone explain this in more detail.  Is there a way around this\nlimit.\n\nIf you email me a response, I will summarize.\n	-Bo	begolej@csgrad.cs.vt.edu
Unfortunately there a *LOT* of such software.  I also find it to be\nthe case that the majority of the software that is BAD in this regard\nis COMMERCIAL software.  Way too many commercial packages are very\npoorly written.  But then most of the programs in MS-DOS are crap, such\nas the PRINT command TSR that locks up your system for long periods of\ntime when the printer is full instead of trying every clock tick.\n\nBack to comm software... I find success with TELIX (my COM3 at 3e8/5\nworks ok on TELIX).

I have a quick question regarding the Rockwell Chipset\nthat's`come out relatively recently--It supports v.32, v.32bis,\nv.42, Group III Fax, and so on...  However, I heard there\nare bugs in the chipset.  I know someone that has a ZOOM\n14.4 Modem that uses the chipset, and he hasn't had a problem.\n\nWhat's the word on the chipset?  Is this a ROM bug specific \nto a specific brand using the Rockwell, or is it the Rockwell\nchipset itself?  And, if it is the Rockwell chipset, what \nare the chances that if I buy one of these modems (using the\nRockwell chipset), that a) the bug will affect me, b) a ROM\nchange will fix/compensate for the bug?\n\nPlease send responses via email...  \n\n--Joe Zbiciak\nim14u2c@cegt201.bradley.edu / im14u2c@camelot.bradley.edu\n\n--\nJoseph Zbiciak                         im14u2c@camelot.bradley.edu\n[====Disclaimer--If you believe any of this, check your head!====]\n------------------------------------------------------------------
I read an article about the benefits of a VLB motherboard. It said that a \ntrue VLB board supports bus mastering, otherwise it is just as good as an ISA\nmotherboard.\n\nDoesn't all VLB motherboard support bus mastering? I just bought a 486-33 VLB\nand the tech manual does not explicitly state the words "local bus mastering"\nbut it said it "supports bus master and slave modes". Are these terms\nsynonymous?\n\nThanks.

Is it possible to buy a serial I/O card with the 16550 UART's built in\n(rather than having to buy them separately, and socketing them in)?\n\nMy current I/O card uses 8250's (correct number? The braindead ones anyway).\nIt also controls two floppy drives, and two IDE hard drives.\n\nIdeally, I'd like to get a new multi I/O card, that had 2 serial ports with\n16550's and could also control another 2 IDE HD's. It would have to have\nconfigurable addresses for both the serial ports, and the IDE controller, so\nit could co-exist with my existing card.\n\nDoes such a beast exist? Now the hard part - where can I get one in Australia,\npreferably Brisbane?

Not completly true.  For AT class and later machines, IRQ5 is\nreserved for LPT2.  Since it's rare to have a second parallel\nport in a PC, it's usually a good safe choice if you need an\ninterrupt.\n\nOn the other hand, we just ran into a problem with that here\nat work on a Gateway computer (4DX-33V).  It has a Modem on COM1,\na Mouse on COM2, and the other serial port was set to COM3 (which\nnormally uses the same interrupt as COM1).  We had a real fight\nwith a board when trying to use IRQ5, and discoverd the problem\nwas that Gateway had set it up such that COM3 used IRQ5.  As soon\nas we disabled COM3, our problems went away.  Grumble ... after\nseveral days of trying to figure out why the interrupt didn't work.
We have plenty of computer labs where the computers are left on all the\ntime. I don't see any shorter lifespan than the ones we have in the\noffices which does get turned off at the end of the day. In fact, some\nof the computers in the labs have outlived some of the same ones in the\noffices. But it goes both ways so can't conclude anything.
Has anyone tried connecting an Apple Laserwriter II to a PC?\nDo I need any special controller card or software to do that?\n\nThanks for any comments.
: \n:   No, buy the serial port and modem. Each can be used for other things,\n: you can use the modem with your next computer (might not be a PC) or\n: upgrade the modem without changing the box. I hear that ISDN is big in\n: Europe, you might be able to get one of those beautiful ISDN modems for\n: less than the pice of a car someday (64k bidirectional).\n: \n: -- \n: bill davidsen, GE Corp.

Hi Netters!\n\nI'm looking at purchasing some sort of backup solution.  After you read about\nmy situation, I'd like your opinion.  Here's the scenario:\n\n1.  There are two computers in the house.  One is a small 286 (40MB IDE drive).\n    The other is a 386DX (213 SCSI drive w/ Adaptec 1522 controller).  Both \n    systems have PC TOOLS and will use Central Point Backup as the backup / \n    restore program.  Both systems have 3.5" and 5.25" floppies.\n\n2.  The computers are not networked (nor will they be anytime soon).\n\nFrom what I have seen so far, there appear to be at least 4 possible\nsolutions (I'm sure there are others I haven't thought about).  For these \noptions, I would appreciate hearing from anyone who has tried them or sees \nany flaws (drive type X won't coexist with device Y, etc.) in my thinking \n(I don't know very much about these beasts):\n\n1.  Put 2.88MB floppy drives (or a combination drive) on each system.\n    Can someone supply cost and brand information?  What's a good brand?\n    What do the floppies themselves cost?\n\n\n2.  Put an internal tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter, and\n    continue to back up the 286 with floppies.  Again, can someone recommend a\n    few manufacturers?  The only brand I remember is Colorado Memories.  Any\n    happy or unhappy users (I know about the compression controversy)?\n \n\n3.  Connect an external tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter, and\n    (maybe?) connect it to the 286 somehow (any suggestions?)\n\n\n4.  Install a Floptical drive in each machine.  Again, any gotcha's or \n    recommendations for manufacturers?  \n\nI appreciate your help.  You may either post or send me e-mail.  I will\nsummarize all responses for the net.\n\nThanks,

I have the same question as Guido. It is possible to use the ESDI drive as a master and the IDE drive as the slave ? \nAt the moment , I have been using the ESDI drive and recently I bought a IDE drive to use as the 2nd drive . \nThe person in the computer shop told me that it is not possible to run 2 disk controller cards together on the same motherboard ( ESDI AND IDE ) but I think there might be some way of making them work. Can anybody enlighten me on this?\nAnd it is possible to  run a ESDI HDD using a IDE controller? or vice versa?\nCan anybody please help me out on this?\nYour help will be very much appreciated.\n\nG.Chow

[Stuff about the connection between IDE and IDA deleated]\nIf IDE speed come from IDA WHERE does the 8.3MB/s sighted for IDE come from?\n\nSCSI is not complex. It is just the way the industry uses and talks about it.\nThere are THREE key differences in SCSI; the controller chip, the port, and\nthe software.  THAT IS IT.\nLet us look as SCSi in from THIS stand point.\n\nSCSI-1: asynchronous and synchronous modes {SOFTWARE SCSI DRIVER ONLY}\n asynchronous is slower then synchronous mode {only 0-3MB/s vs. 0-5MB/s}\n synchronous speeds can be reached by most SCSi-1 divices with a\n rewrite of the software driver {As is the case for the Mac Quadra.}\n\nSCSI-2 {8-bit}: THIS is the main source for the confusion. This differs from\n SCSI-1 ONLY in the controler chip in most machines.  In the Mac and some PCs\n this is called 'fast SCSI-1' because it uses SCSI-1 ports and software drivers\n AND can produce SCSI-2 SPEEDS through SCSI-1 INSPITE of this even in the \n slower asynchronous mode.  Average speed in asynchronous SCSi-1 mode \n 4-6MB/s with 8MB/s{See in both Quadras and higher end PCs} Synchronous\n mode just allows a higher burst rate {10/MB/s}\n\nSCSI-2 {16-bit}: TWO versions-Wide/Fast.  Wide SCSI-2 requires TWO things\n over 8-bit SCSI-2:  a SCSI-2 software driver and a wide SCSI port on the\n machine and the external device.\n Fast SCSI-2 also requires TWO things over 8-bit SCSI-2: SCSI-2 driver\n software and that the RECIEVING devise support 16-bit fast SCSI-2.\n Speed of both is the same: 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst.\n\nSCSI-2 {32-bit}:  Also know as Wide AND Fast SCSI.  Over 8-bit SCSI-2 this\n requires: SCSI-2 driver software, wide SCSI-2 port, and that the RECIEVING\n devices ALSO have a 32-bit mode SCSI-2 chip.  As expected this is VERY\n expencive.  Speed: 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s bursts

: I have a 5 1/4" drive as drive A.  How can I make the system boot from\n: my 3 1/2" B drive?  (Optimally, the computer would be able to boot\n: from either A or B, checking them in order for a bootable disk.  But\n: if I have to switch cables around and simply switch the drives so that\n: it can't boot 5 1/4" disks, that's OK.  Also, boot_b won't do the trick\n: for me.)\n: \n: Thanks,\n:   Davebo\nWe had the same issue plague us for months on our Gateway.  I finally\ngot tired of it so I permanently interchanged the drives.  The only\nreason I didn't do it in the first place was because I had several\nbootable 5-1/4's and some 5-1/4 based install disks which expected\nthe A drive.  I order all new software (and upgrades) to be 3-1/2 and\nthe number of "stupid" install programs that can't handle an alternate\ndrive are declining with time - the ones I had are now upgraded.  And\nas for the bootable 5-1/4's I just cut 3-1/2 replacements.\n\nIf switching the drives is not an option, you might be able to wire up\na drive switch to your computer chasis.  I haven't tried it but I think\nit would work as long as it is wired carefully.
There were an assortment of firmware problems, but that is pretty much\nexpected with any FAX/modem talking with a different FAX or modem\nwhich may have also been revised or is new.  I'm pretty much\noblivious to any current firmware problems, so you'll have to get it\nfrom someone else.\n\nHowever, I can tell you to stay clear of any board which uses the\nRockwell MPU (as opposed to the DPU) for an internal implementation.\nThis is because the MPU used "speed buffering" instead of having a\n16550 interface.  Without the 550 interface, the number of interrupts\nare still the same and thus may get dropped under multitasking\nconditions (like in windows).  As far as I know, the "speed buffering"\nworks OK for external modems if a 550 is used on the internal serial\nport board.\n\nHope this helps...\nTom
I'm thinking of splashing out on a new motherboard for my PC. I am\nrunning Linux as my main OS, with a small DOS partition left for my\nflatmates' games.\n\nMy current setup is a 386SX-25 (AMD) with 387SX-25 (ITT - I think) and 9\nMbytes of 70ns SIMMS, and (120+100)Mbyte IDE.\n\nBasically I have two choices\n\n1) Get a 386DX-40 + 387DX-40  or\n2) Get some sort of 486.\n\nUnfortunately I live in the UK where computer prices are far too high.\nThe first option works out at about \pounds 200. 486 m/boards start at\nthis price for a SX-25.\n\nI have a couple of questions.\n\n1) How much of an improvement in speed should I notice if I get a\n386DX+copro. Remember I'm using a 32 bit OS, and alot of Floating Point\noperations.\n\n2) How much faster would a 486DX-33 be than the 386DX-40+copro ?\n\nShould I get an upgradeable m/board with a 386DX-40 and wait for\nAMD/Pentium price pressure to reduce the costs of the 486 ?\n\n	Any experiences will be most helpful ...\n\n		Kenny.\n\nPS.

: Hi!        \n: 	I will change my 286 soon, and i read something about the ibm ps\n: value-point... anyone have one? the video card is really a 24 bit card?\n: how much cost in U.S.?\n: 	And the last question... can the ps value point 486 sx 25mhz\n: upgrade to a 486 dx2 66mhz???\n: \n: 	Thank you veeery much in advance!\n: \n: 	Alejandro Cifuentes H.\n: 	acifuent@isluga.puc.cl\n\nThese questions can be answered by any dealer of IBM Value Points, but, I will\nprovide some unsolicited advice -- the most amusing kind of advice.\n\nToday (Tueday 4-6-93) IBM is supposed to officially announce the introduction\nof the VESA Local Bus Value Point systems.  These systems still have on-board\nvideo and disk which are far better than the prior Value Point systems, and\nyou get VESA Local Bus for (future?) upgrades.  We are going to buy three of\nthem with 17" monitors (also a newly available), and one of the three will\nimmediately be upgraded to UltraStor 34F caching SCSI disk controller and\neither the ATI GUP or the Viper graphics board.\n\nDo not buy a 486SX sytem.\n\nMy personal philosophy on upgrade policy is that it is not loss-free.  When\nyou earn money you pay taxes, when you spend money you pay taxes.  (i.e. they\nget you coming and going).  Translated this means take infrequent but large\nsteps.  You are far better off short term AND long term if you avoid the SX\nmodels and go straight to the DX or DX-2 models.
I have had a Gateway Telepath modem for about a month or so now.\nActually, I had one that wouldn't connect to ANYTHING no matter\nwhat software I used, so I got a new one sent to me.  This allows\nme to connect to my favorite News system with ZERO problems.  So\nI'm somewhat happier ....\n\nBut I still cannot connect to my favorite DOS bbs with any kind\nof reliability.  I have success about 1/10 calls.  Not good!  I\nwould hope that the fact that this one can connect to at least\nONE of my fave places means I just need to adjust it.\n\nWhat I usually get is a fast stream of garbage, in the modem response\nline on the dial window. Sometimes it will drop to full screen mode\nfirst, then I get about 2-3 screens of garbage.  In both cases the\nmodem seems to time out before connecting and drops carrier.\n\nI am using DEFAULT settings (AT&F) and getting this problem.  I\nam using the AUTOCONFIGURE settings that Gateway has supplied with\nmy copy of Qmodem (ATW1&C1&D2S95=44&W0) and getting this problem.\n(They have refused to help me beyond this, claiming "it must be\nthe BBS" or something like that.  Not so -- my work modem connects\nto this same place just fine, using factory settings -- a Microcom.)\n\nAnyone have any ideas?!

I need some help with a multi port serial board of unknown origin.  I'm\nhoping someone knows what this board is, or, even better, what the various\nswitches and jumbers are used for.\n\nAnyway, here's  description of the card:  It is a 16-bit card, although\nI noticed that none of the contacts in the 16-bit extension are connected\nto anything.  It has 4 NS16550AN chips in sockets, and 4 corresponding\nconnecters labeled COM1 - COM4.  There is also an external female connector\nwith 37 pins.  There are 8 banks of 8 switches, 2 banks of 4 switches, and\n7 jumpers.  I believe that I have determined, by following traces, that\nSW5 and SW6 (12 switches in all) control the interrupt level for each of\nthe COM ports.  SW5[1-4] are for IRQ3, SW5[5-8] are for IRQ4, and SW6[1-4]\nare for IRQ5.  The other switches are beyond my meager ability to follow.\n	     \nThe only identification printed on the board is "MULTI SERIAL PORT BOARD"\nacross the bottom.  There is a box for serial number, but it is blank.\nImmediately below the words "SERIAL NO", but not in the box left for\nthe S/N, are the numbers "1990 2 8".\n\nAnyone have any clues?  Your help is greatly appreciated.
They are actually 72 pin. They come in 4, 8, 16, and 32 with 64s soon\nIf you are interested in 4s or 8s, I may be able to help. Please call\n415-324-2881 after 4:00 pm pdt. I may be interested in a trade.

It shows the article is CORRECT in it\nstaments about SCSI but not CONSITANT}.\n\nWith the way this thread has gone how do you tell :-).\nAlready GAVE them.  YOU keep deleting them! So here are the Specs\non everybody AGAIN {With some added info}:\n\nSCSI-1 {SCSI-1 controler chip} asynchronous range: 0-3MB/s\n synchronous range: 0-5MB/s  Both common to the PC world; difference is\n mainly in software not hardware.\n\nSCSI-1 {SCSI-2 controller chip; also called SCSI-2 (8-bit)}: 4-6MB/s with \n10MB/s burst.  This is advertised as SCSI-2 in BYTE 4/93:159 FOR the\n PC and AT THESE SPEEDS.{NOT the Mac, the PC.}\n\n{I have not seen the following for EITHER the Mac or the PC}\nSCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst\nSCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst\n\nOn the other interfaces let DXB132@psuvm.psu.edu speak:\n asynchronous range: 0-5MB/s {infered from BYTE 4/93:159}\n synchronous range: 0-8.3MB/s.\n\nNote that I ALSO give the AVERAGE through put for SCSI-2 which holds true\na Mac OR IBM/PC clone with the correct hardware and software.\nAnd since PC ADVERSIZEMENTS are using Theoretical performance figures WHY \nCANNOT WE?\n\n\nWith PC articles like the following it is obvious that the problem is NOT with\nSCSI but with the PEOPLE WHO REPORT IT! {Like YOU.}\nLook at the inconsitant use of SCSI in the below quote: \n(My comments in {})\n"Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI,{This is asynchronous SCSI-1 with\na SCSI-1 chip} 20% faster than IDE..." {this is BOTH asynchronous SCSI-1 with \na SCSI-2 chip AND 8-bit SCSI-2} PC Magazine April 27, 1993:29\nThe ARTICLE is confused, NOT SCSI.  The TERM is a mess from inconsitant use\nNOT because the interface itself is a mess.\n\nSCSI means "The set of SCSI interfaces composed of SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2"\nNOT 'SCSI-1' as some people want to use it.\n\nTo read CONSITANTLY the quote SHOULD read:\n{asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip}\n"Although asynchronous SCSI-1 is twice as fast as ESDI, one third the \nspeed of IDE..."\nor {asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip or 8-bit SCSI-2}\n"Although SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip and 8-bit SCSI-2 are eight times as fast as\nESDI, 20% faster than IDE..."\n\nNOTE the NONUSE of 'SCSI' by itself.  This eliminates ambaguity.

Hi!\n\nI have a problem with my floppy drives. In an effort to make my 3.5" drive \n(normally b:) my a: drive, I switched the order of connections on the cable \nfrom the serial card/floppy/ide controller. I booted up, changed the CMOS\nsettings to reflect the a: drive as the 3.5 and the b: drive as the 5.25.\nThe drive lights didn't come on, and there was a failure trying to read from\nthose drives.\n\nI switched the cables back to their original positions, and then booted-up and\nrestored the original CMOS settings. The lights for the floppies came on\nduring this process, and they stay on for as long as the computer is on.\nI see that when there is a disk in a:, the drive is spinning, yet there seems\nto be no disk access. MSD.EXE and Norton SI detect both drives, but when I \ntry to get detailed information about a: or b:, Norton SI tells me that there\nis no disk in the drive.\n\nCan anyone offer any suggestions?\nI'm in desperate need of help!!!\n\nThank you for your time.
I was wondering if anyone out there has had the same problem I am having with\nmy Gateway 2000 486-33DX VL-Bus system with ATI Graphics Ultra Pro LB.  \nWhen I have my computer in any resolution other than 800x600, everything is\nfine, but whenever I use it in 800x600 (Windows, AutoCAD, GIFs) the screen \ngets about 1 1/2 inches shorter.  At the very top and very bottom of the screen\nthere is about a 3/4" bar of black.  The screen isn't cut off, it just squeezes\neverything into the smaller space and messes up the aspect ratio.  While I can\nmanually change the V-Size on the back, this is a pain in the ass, and it just\nshouldn't happen anyway.  I've called Gateway numerous times and they haven't \nbeen able to help me at all.  Two different times they sent me a new card, and\nboth times the new card didn't work at all in my computer.  They even tried\nto bill me for the first card because they didn't get it back in a couple of\ndays, when they TOLD me over the phone that they would wait more than 2 weeks\nbefore billing my card.  But their customer support is a different story...\nSo, if anyone has had this same problem, please let me know if you know what\nto do.  Hell, let me know if you don't have a solution, just so I know I'm\nnot the only one with this problem.  Thanks in advance.\n\nJude M. Greer\njmgree01@starbase.spd.louisville.edu
)  The documentation says that Wordperfect for windows, requires 4 M of ram, but\n)when I try to install it on my laptop I get a not enough memory error message.\n)I've unloaded everything that I possibly could but still, NOT ENOUGH MEMORY.\n)Anyone have any ideas as to why this might be happening.
I'm trying to transfer some software between two machines \n	and I'm having real trouble.  My own Intel 14.4k (\n	v32/v32bis/v42/v42bis) works fine--I just talk to it\n	at 56k and everything comes out clear.  This other modem,\n	at the other machine, is a "Turbomodem+" from "The \n	Complete PC" (the machines are in seperate houses, \n	so a direct serial link is impossible, and copying this\n	much data to disk is a pain--easier to turn the machines\n	on for a few hours and go see a movie--no, this is not\n	pirated software).\n\n	I am having no end of trouble trying to set it up.  It will\n	dial and connect just fine--at 9600 baud.  But if I try to\n	set the comm at 19k2, 38.4k or 56kbps, the stupid thing\n	connects, but just gives garbage (it connects 14.4k).  \n	His machine (a dx48633) has a 16550AFN UART, so that's\n	not the problem.\n\n	It seems to me that the stupid thing wants to talk to 	\n	a comm program _at_ 14.400bps, even though it will take\n	dialing instructions at 56k (and respond OK, etc. to \n	other commands).  I don't have a comm program that can\n	do precisely 14.4k.  \n\n	I looked at the manual but it was unclear.  All I know is,\n	I didn't have this trouble with the Intel--it came\n	ready to connect this way.  Do I need to initialize it\n	any way in particular?\n\n	Also, it's _using_ V.42bis and V.42 (and MNP5) when connecting\n	here (i.e., at 9600, since our tests at 14k4 are zip so far)\n	but it doesn't _say_ so there.  any ideas?\n\n	(BTW:  I tried the initialization string that I use for\n	my modem, but it just gives ERROR on that one)
OK, I'll try one more time with this one. If ANYONE out there has ANY\ninformation on MicroScience hard drives and how to set the jumpers\n(and where they are?) for master/slave configurations.

I own an 8088 640K clone which does all I want except run 1 game I want\nto buy.  The game says it requires a 80286 with 640K.  Game tech. support\nsays game will run on 8088 but uses a some digitized graphics which would\nmake it run really *slow* (it's a card game - Hoyles Classic Card Games,\ndigitized graphics are photos artwork of game fictional card players).\n\nWhat can I do to speed up how this game would run, short of an 80286\nmotherboard upgrade.  Co-processor?  Accelerator card mimicking 80286?\nMy 8088 can run at 10 Mhz.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
You'll probably get one when you realize that your $100 vesa super\ndooper local bus ultra high tech controller sucks...\n\nWith any luck PC bus archeitecture will be doen any with by sbus.\n\nHave you ever seen what happens when you hook a busmaster controller to\na vesa local bus.  It actually  slows down your system\n\nMaybe my workstation doesn't understand what your vesa local bus\nIDE is\n\nVesa local bus will be killed off by pcmi? whatever intels spec is.\nVLBUS it not good for much more than vga cards.\n\nTo each his own.  I'll laugh when you start crying over how much you\nspent for your 2 little ide drives and then finding out you need more\nspace.\n\nHere Here....\n\n\n\ndon't stick your foot in your mouth when you make a statement you know\nnothing about.\n\n\nI'd rather wait a second compared to the 5 minutes and ide would take.\n(obviously exaggerated).\n\nHave you ever tried to backup 2 gigs of disk?  Oh I forgot you can't\nbecause you have an ide and no one makes ide disks that big.\n\n\nI guess you probably bought a 486sx too\n\n\nWhat?  The SCSI-2 FAST,WIDE spec has much more bandwidth than any stupid\nvlbus ide crap....\n\nStop this thread now, Its just cluttering up bandwidth.  If you want\nto read about scsi vs ide just pay a visit to you local usenet archive.\n\nthe best SCSI-2 FAST,WIDE,etc is clearly faster than any the best ide drive.\nAll the response given are based upon personal experience with 1 or 2\ndrives.  You can't judge such completely different interfaces.  \nIDE has the low cost adavantage + a descent performance.\nSCSI has the ability for super high capacity expandibility and speed.\n\nneither one is better in all cases.\n\nIf you don't belive what I said about busmastering and vlbus then pick\nup a back issue of PC-week in whihc they tested vlbus, eisa and isa\nbusmastering cards.\n\nsend flames to /dev/null.....
Then don't complain (maybe it wasn't you) that SCSI was so expensive on\nPC's because all we've had until a year or two ago was the ISA bus.\n(ie no one buys SCSI for ISA because ISA is slow)\nAre you saying that SCSI on an ISA bus is not an automatic winner when\ncompared to IDE?\n\n\nI get different transfer rates out of my IDE when I change my ISA bus speed.\n\n\nIDE is just a variant of the old IBM- MFM AT controller.  (at least that's\nhow it looks from a software point of view).  It was never meant to be\nan all-encompassing protocal/standard to be implimented across different\nplatforms.\n\nIs there any argument that \nIDE can (or can't) transfer data from the IDE drive at least as fast as the\ndrive is able to provide the data?  Are SCSI versions of IDE drives able\nto deliver higher sustained transfer rates to their SCSI interface (because\nof a higher RPM platter, different arrangement of heads, etc?)?\n\n\nIf data is going from one drive to another, and if SCSI has the ability to\nperform that transfer without the data having to go through the CPU or main\nmemory, then yes, that is the optimal way to do it.  As far as I know, IDE\ncan't do that.  But when the CPU wants data from both drives (data to be stored\nin main memory) are you saying that SCSI can grab data from both drives \nat the same time *and* store/transfer that data to main memory also at the\nsame time?  Working off 1 IRQ and 1 DMA channel on an ISA (or whatever) bus?\n\n\nA friend of mine just got a Maxtor 245 meg IDE drive for $320.  (that's 245\nmillion bytes, or 234 mega-bytes).  With the basic $20 interface, he gets\nclose to 1 meg/sec transfer on his 286-20.  Does your figure include a few\nhundred $$$ for SCSI drivers?\n\n\nSo you're saying that SCSI would have been the default interface type,\nconsidering that the vast majority of PC's don't have cd-rom drives or\ntape backups or etc?  That most PC's only have (or had) 1 hard drive and\nrun DOS?  That SCSI hard drives cost a lot more than MFM or RLL drives\nat the time?  (and how common were SCSI drives under 80 megs 4 to 10 years\nago?)  There's a lot more than the lack of a common interface card that\nprevented SCSI from becoming the connection medium of choice.\n\n\nBut on that point, is it faster?  This is what all this is about.  Do you\nget more performance for the money.  For all the people that will only have\na single hard drive in their system (regardless of the OS) will the SCSI\nchoice really give them more performance than IDE?\n\n\nTrue, but expandibility can also start on the bus, which means the option\nis there for cd-rom drives or tape backups that run off their own cards.\n\n\nNo argument.  This is always held up to the first time SCSI buyer as the\nbest reason.  But how many SCSI devices will the first time SCSI buyer\neventually acquire?  Again does it make sense to go SCSI for a single\nhard drive system?\n\n\nWith all the postings on the SCSI I or II specs, are you really sure that\nPC and Apple SCSI hard drives are compatible?  And even if they are, \nis the data accessible from either machine (ie are there no formatting/\npartitioning or file table differences?)  Is it really plug'n'play?\n\n\nSo the C: drive on the connor becomes a logical D: drive to DOS.  Is this\nreally a problem?  \n\n\nAfter having two IDE drives in my system for temporary file transfers,\nI have never seen any differences when switching between drives, nor\nhave I ever seen any differences when transfering files between drives or\nto/from the same drive.\n\n\nThat is nice (as long as the power supply can keep up).  I do believe that\nthere is the possibility for up to 4 IDE drives on a PC.
I have a Colorado Memory Systems Jumbo 250 tape backup unit in my Gateway\n486/33V Tower system. I have found the supplied backup capability to be \nfairly unreliable. In approx 3 cases out of 10, I have had the backup fail\nat one point or another, often hanging in the middle of writing the tape.\nSeek errors, drive communication errors seem to be most common. I use the\nDOS backup software from Colorado Memory Systems. Should I return the drive,\nget some better backup software, reformat the tapes (am using CMS tapes)?\nAny hints would be appreciated - this stuff is to time-consuming to do over\nand over again until it cooperates...

Why don't you start with the spec-sheet of the ISA bus first?\nYou can quote SCSI specs till you're blue in the face, but if they\nexceed the ISA bus capability, then what's the point?\n\nWho says IDE is limited to 5 megs/sec?  What about VLB-IDE?  Does anyone\nknow how they perform?\n\n\nAs implimented on what system?  \n\n\nGiven the original question (SCSI used only as a single hard drive\ncontroller),  is it then necessary to get a SCSI drive that will do\nat least 5, maybe 10 megs/sec for the SCSI choice to make any sence?\nWhat does a 200-400 meg 5 megs/sec SCSI drive cost?\n\n\nThe original CGA cart back in '84 was $300.  I think the original EGA card\n(or PGA?) was $800.  SCSI has stood relatively alone in not coming down\nin price, mainly because we're talking about PC's and not Sun's or Sparc\nor SGI or (name your favorite unix workstation).  That is, after millions\nof PC buying decisions over the years, SCSI has had plenty of time to\ncome down in price.
I got two very similar sounding boards for dirt cheap, too. Their Assy\nnumbers were not 4000-series, but your description fits otherwise. They\nare 3Com 3C505's aka Etherlink Plus cards. Check out ftp.3com.com, there\nare drivers and diagnostic programs for just about any and all 3Com\ncards. I concluded that my card was the 505 after I ran their diagnostic\nprogram for 3C505 succesfully ("..passes with flying colours") :)\n\nAnybody know of packet drivers for these cards under OS/2..?

While rummaging through a box of old PC (5150) parts, I found a half-size\nboard that looks like a comm port board.  It was made by Forte Data Systems and\nhas a copyright date of 1986 on it.  The board provides a male 24-pin connector\nand has 3 jumpers of 3 pins each, two labelled A B C.  I plugged it into my PC\nand ran Advanced diagnostics several times, changing the jumper positions each\ntime, but the system did not recognise a comm port.\n\nDoes anyone have a clue as to what this board might be or how to configure it?\nI could use another comm port if it's free.
Hi,\n\nCan anyone tell me the difference between ~30-pin and 72-pin Simms?\nI wish to get detailed information about the origin of these two\ndifferent types of Simms, preferably a magazine review aricle.\n\nBy the way, if there is a FAQ for this group which covers the Simms\ninformation, please also direct me to it.\n\nAny help/information would be very much appreciated.\n\n\nSincerely,
^^^\nHow long does he have to take in fixing it?  Does he have to use new\nparts when he repairs it or can he substitute used parts without your\nknowledge?  Can he charge you for repairs that should be under warranty\nbut he claims are due to improper maintenance on your part? \n\nWhen it comes to local dealers:\n\n- Have fun getting consistently good support.  Most of their "techs" are\nre-treaded salesmen, not trained technicians, with a high turnover rate.\n\n- Have fun getting in-warranty work done quickly and courteously.\n\n- Have fun getting out-of-warranty work done cheaply, or even done\nperiod, unless you are on a paid service contract.\n\nHaving been both a service technician, and a service manager, at a\nComputerLand franchise and another retail computer place, I know what\nI'm talking about. \n\nI also know the "local service" scam that retail computer dealers like\nto push when they're selling.  It's that same old song that car dealers\nhaving been singing for years -- "Buy from me and you'll get good\nservice. We always treat our customers right!  Buy from my competition\nand you'll be sorry if you need service." \n\nExperienced mail order buyers know that there are some mail order\ncompanies that give excellent service, including overnight replacement parts, \non-site calls, etc. There are probably some local dealers that can give you\ngood service, too.

I have many anectdotes to prove my point, \nbut I'm sure there are others on the net can do a better job than I can.
I can definitily say that you can use an RLL as Master and IDE as slave, as\nI have just upgraded my machine with a 200Mb IDE ( And custom Controller\nMdl CI-1010 Extended IDE Controller ) While maintaining my RLL'd Wren as\nmaster Drive.  The trick is the controller which supports up to 4 IDE Drives\nwhile coexisting with existing Controllers ( MFM,RLL,ESDI,SCSI ).\n\nSo according to the Documentation it should work with ESDI, and I can assure\nyou it works with RLL.
I just put replaced the motherboard in a system and had similar questions.\nMy 2 cents worth:\n\nThe speaker connector should have two wires going to the speaker. \nA speaker being a coil, it's bidirectional and makes no difference\nwhich way you attach.\n\nTurbo switch.   There are three wires to control how you want turbo\nto become active- with the switch pushed in or the switch out.    I think\nthe middle wire is common.   Use an ohm meter to figure out which wire\nconnects with the common wire when the switch is pushed in, and which two\nwires are connected when the switch is out.   Place the appropriate\ntwo wires on the turbo berg connector of the motherboard.\n\nLED's:   (Turbo and HD)  LED's are uni directional.  Depending which\nway the wires are attached the LED will not light.  On my AMI motherboard,\nif the turbo switch wires are not attached to the berg connector on the\nboard, the board will power up in default in Turbo mode.   If your motherboard\nis like that... just attace the LED wires to the board.  If the LED doesn't\nlight, power off, reverse the connectors and try again.   It should work.\n\nIf it does, then attach the turbo switch to the board.\n\nHope this helps.
Yeah, there is absolutely no use for VLB except for video graphics.\nAnd no IDE could possibly take advantage the VLB, because it runs at\n8 Mhz and 16 bits. Do people forget that the IDE was specifically\ndesigned to interface directly with the AT ISA bus? We've seen\nIDEs come out for EISA, XT ISA, and now even MCA, but at all times\nit was a 16 bit standard, running at somewhere near 8-10 Mhz. When\nyou run an IDE off of the VLB, there's no way that you're running it\nat 33 Mhz, it would burn up. Of course same goes for SCSI, ESDI, whatever,\nnone of them run at CPU speed.\n\nThe only way to gain advantage with a VLB IDE is to hook it up to\na caching controller. I suspect it would be much, much better to\nget a software disk cache instead, since you get write-caching as well.\n\n\nI've seen some Fuji IDE drives going as high as 1G.
I don't think FD is a problem.  Since FD is much sloooooooowwwwwwer\nthan HD, the overhead of double buffering doesn't matter.\n\nKen Nakata
Hi All,\n\n  I have heard that somewhere there exist programmable keyboards, eg. one\ncan program displays on the keys to show some specific characters, et.c.\n  Does it mean that there is some way of transmitting some "non-trivial" data\nto the KB (as opposed to standard NumLock/... On-Off, typeamatic specs.) from\ninside the PC software? I have not found any corresponding reference in the\nspecs for the 8042 PC-KB interface. Anyone have any ideas? (Except that they\nmay encode data by the sequences of the standard commands mentioned above,\nwhich wouldn't look too neat, besides, what would one do from an XT?)\n\n  Great thanks in advance,

Well, not to be picky, but the V in VLB stands for VESA.\nWhile the V in VESA stands for video, saying the V in VLB stands\nfor video is not entirely correct.

Hello,\n\nI am looking for a PC card with the following features:\n\n  - Controller for IDE(AT-Bus)-HardDiskDrive\n  - Controller for 2 FloppyDiskDrives\n  - Standard(256KB) VGA Graphics  INCLUDING FEATURE CONNECTOR (important!)\n                                  ===========================\n\nThere *are* some manufacturors/distributors of this kind of card, but I have\nnot found them yet.\n\nIf you can help me, please mail to:  ICH344@DJUKFA11\n                                     ICH344@zam001.zam.kfa-juelich.de
Yes, You bought the WRONG SIMMS.....You need 1X36 or 4X36, which are 72 pin\nSIMMS.....These are better anyway becuase the send/receive data in 4byte\n(32bit+4bit parity, one for each byte) Chunks. You will undoubtedly see these\nSIMMS becoming more widely used in the near future.\n\nJason\n--
Can anybody please help me with information on the use of the bi-directional\nprinter port.\n\nI have successfully used one on a Toshiba laptop by enabling bit 0 of port\n0x37f and controlling bit 7 of port 0x37a for the direction of data flow (ie\n"0" for output, "1" for input).\n\nThe same code does not work on my desktop machine. I have heard that i might\nhave to use bit 5 of port 0x37a, however this also does not work.\n\nFor a parallel port i am using one of those IDE SUPER I/O cards and have been\nrunning a tape backup unit off it via a parallel to scsi converter so i am\npretty sure that the printer port is bi-directional.\n\n\nAny information would be greatly appreasiated.\n\nPlease post a reply here or Email me on\n\nINTERNET rick@cabsav.vut.edu.au\n\nThanks\nRichard Muratti.
I know of two people who have horrer stories about the DOS 6.0. \nThat's 100% of the people I know with DOS 6.0. Both have\nhad to reformat their disks and start over.  One had drive D compress and work\nfine, only to compress C: to have the thing choke, spit out an unintelligable\nwarning, and then hang.  All that was left on either drive was autoexec.bat\nand config.sys.  Calls to Microsoft only met with busy signals.  After reformatting\nthe drive, I'm not sure if he had the guts to reinstall 6.0 or stay with a known\nentity.\n\nThe other may have been a marginal drive, however, his upgrade failed,\nhe had to format a floppy disk at 6.0, format the drive, and then reinstall.\n\nI make now claims since I was not driving at the time, however, be careful\nand make sure you back important things up.
I would like advice on how to configure my 486 to accept:\n- Com1 + Com2  (currently on IRQ 4 and 3)\n- LPT1 (IRQ7)\n- Bus Mouse (IRQ5)\n- Sound Card (no idea what to do - can be set to any)\n- \nusing IRQ2 for Bus MOuse gobbled up too many cycles, and caused\nloss of communications with floppy disks, and a few other \nproblems.\n\nI could, I suppose, switch the 2 com devices externally, and disable\nthe second port on the Super IO card, but I really want to \nhave them both available.\n\nCOuld the sound card use IRQ2 without horsing up the works?\n\nAll replies apppreciated - and I only just subscribed to this\nnewsgroup - I assume there is an FAQ somewhere (rather, I'm\nsure someone will tell me about it....)
Hi.  I am trying to set up a Conner 3184 and a Quantum 80AT drive.  I have\nthe conner set to the master, and the quantum set to the slave (doesn't work\nthe other way around).  I am able to access both drives if I boot from a \nfloppy, but the drives will not boot themselves.  I am running MSDOS 6, and\nhave the Conner partitioned as Primary Dos, and is formatted with system\nfiles.  I have tried all different types of setups, and even changed IDE\ncontroller cards.  If I boot from a floppy, everything works great (except\nthe booting part :)).  The system doesn't report an error message or anything,\njust hangs there.  Does anyone have any suggestions, or has somebody else\nrun into a similar problem?  I was thinking that I might have to update the bios\non one of the drives (is this possible?).  Any suggestions/answers would be\ngreatly appreciated.  Please reply to:
Hi.  Recently my svga monitor has been acting up by taking about\n3 minutes to warm up.  \n\nPreviously, when I first start up my PC I can see all the \nCMOS messages (RAM test ...etc) but now I've got to wait \nfor about 3min before the display shows anything and\nit starts up with a bright white flash.  This only happens\nwhen the system has been off for a long time (eg overnight).\nIf it was only off for a couple of hours and then turned on\nagain, the display works as normal like before.\n\nDoes anyone know what is causing this?  Is it a warning that\nit will give up soon or just signs of aging (the system is a\n386sx and its about 3 yrs old).  I've used systems at work for\nyears and never seen this happen to a monitor yet.\n\nI'd really appreciated any help that you fellow netters can offer.\nThanks a lot.\n\nEdwin\n--
Could someone please give me some info regarding the USR Sportsters that have\nrecently dropped below $200? I was going to buy a used Courier v32bis external\nwithout fax for $200 but now I see the Sportster with Fax is selling below\n$200 brand new! Are these good modems? What warranty do they carry?\n\nAny info very much appreciated.\n\nKevin
I bet it suddenly started sticking when you  started leaving the PC running the\nmenu all night.  There is a limitation/bug in the date roll-over software in\nPC's that means you have to be doing something like waiting for keyboard input\nvia a DOS call rather than a BIOS call (as menus often use) otherwise the code\nto update the date after midnight never gets called. \n\nSomebody might be able to correct the details in case I've mis-rememberred\nthem, but I think you have to change the menu program (if you have the sources)\nor add a TSR or system patch or something.  As far as I know the CMOS clock\nkeeps the right time (in fact about 7 seconds/day better than DOS's clock).
Okay, I'm trying to install NCSA telnet on a couple (okay, a whole bunch)\nof machines.  They're all true blue IBMs with either Fallon Phonenet cards\nor Dastar cards.  (I belive those names are correct.)  Well, the docs for\ntelnet say that it'll run over an AppleTalk driver, but I've had little\nsuccess.\n\nIf anyone has succesfully installed Telnet w/ AppleTalk, I'd like some\nhelp with the config file for Telnet...\n\nBTW, please reply via E-mail if possible...\n\nThanks,\n\nJeremy\n\n-- \nJeremy Zawodny | Computer Science Undergrad | Bowling Green State University
Hello,\n\nin the EDN magazine I found a note about the new C&T 82C735\nI/O Controller. It support several parallel port protocols,\nincluding\n	Fast Centronics\n	Microsoft Enhanced Capabilities Protocol (ECP)\n	Enhanced Parallel Port (EPP)\nThe last two handle data rates up to 2Mbytes/sec.\n\nIs there any specification about these protocols available?\n\nRegards,\n\n	Christian Franke
Hi,\n\nI've got a Victor PC/XT with a 20 MB harddisk in it. The controller is\na Toshiba MFM controller, with an additional 9 pins connector.\n\nThere are 2 busses from my harddisk to this controller. One with 9 wires\nand another with 34 wires.\n\nThe controller has two connectors for a 9 wire-bus and one for a 34 wire\nbus.\n\nNow I got a 20 MB harddisk from a friend of mine, and I wondered whether\nI can connect this second harddisk to the same controller (there is room\nfor a 9 wire-bus, but not for the 34 wire bus)\n\nHow can I solve my problem, any suggestions?\n\nIf you need more info, mail me, please (luttik@fwi.uva.nl).
I am looking for an inexpensive vlb card, and have yet to run across any\nreal reviews of them. One of the cards the local stores are pushing is\nthe Genoa 8500 for $125-140. Apparently it uses a Cirrus Logic acc. chip,\nbut I don't know which one (GD5426?). One of the shops I've spoken with \nclaims the card out-performs the Diamond Stealth 24 vl and the Orchid\nFahrenheit 1280 plus vl cards (S3 86C805 based), but that can't be true\nif it is using the GD5426. I like the price of the Genoa 8500, but if it\nlags in performance behind the S3 cards, I'll pay the extra $50 for one \nof them.\n\nAny info. on low end vlb cards would be appreciated. If I get replies via\nemail, I'll post summary info. if anyone else is interested.
The F550iW is optimized for Windows.  It powers down when the screen\nblanker appears, it powers down with you turn your computer off, and it\nmeets all of the Swedish standards.  It's also protected against  EMI from\nadjacent monitors.
According to what others have told me, the ST-296N is difficult to run at\nthe 1:1 interleave even though Seagate claims it.  I have a non-pc system\n(don't ask what it is, you probably haven't heard of it) that is built\naround SCSI and it can't do 1:1, either.\n\n                                        Brian\n                           ( bcwhite@sunee.uwaterloo.ca )
I am trying to get my system to work with a Tandberg 3600 + Future\nDomain TMC-1660 + Seagate ST-21M MFM controller. \n\nThe system boots up if the Tandberg is disconnected from the system,\nand of course no SCSI devices found (I have no other SCSI devices).\n\nThe system boots up if the Seagate MFM controller is removed from the\nsystem. The Future Domain card reports finding the Tandberg 3660 on\nthe SCSI bus. The system then of course stops booting because my MFM\nhard disks can't be found.\n\nThe system hangs if all three (Tandberg, Future Domain TMC-1660 &\nSeagate MFM controller) are in the system. \n\nLooks like there is some conflict between the Seagate and Future\nDomain card. But the funny thing is that it only hangs if the Tandberg\nis connected.\n\nI have checked that there are no conflict in BIOS addresses, IRQ & I/O\nport. Have I missed anything?\n\nI am lost here. Any suggestions are most welcomed. Thanks in advance.\n\nDelman.\n\n\n\n--\n______________________________________________________________________
The Quantum LPS 240AT is supposed to have a 256K cache on the IDE\ncontroller built into the card.  Yet when I do a DOS DIR command\non my system, the disk is always accessed (I can hear the mechanical\nmovement of the heads).  Why is this happening?  Strangely, even\nwhen I have smartdrive installed, every DIR command accesses the\ndisk.  Did I somehow de-activate the cache?  This is happening on each \nof two machines with an LPS 240AT drive.
Hi fellow netters,\n\ndoes anybody have any info on Tseng Labs ET4000 VLB card:\nprice, speed, compatibility with existing and up-comming softwares,\nperformance compared to others cards ( is it an S3 based card ?)....

Just a quick THANKS to the many who explained the backing up of my\nmasters.  Apparently they are NOT copy-protected; I just used a program that\nis unable to handle high-density (old shit).  I was surprised to hear that\n"NO programs on high-density disks have copy protection," which someone\nback there said.  Huh!  Learn something new every day!
I need a device (either an ISA board or a subsystem) which will\ntake two RGB video signals and combine them according to a template.\nThe template can be as simple as a rectangular window with signal\none being used for the interior and signal two for the exterior.\nBut I beleive fancier harware may also exist which I do not want\nto exclude from my search.  I know this sort of hardware exists\nfor NTSC, etc. but I need it for RGB.\n\nPlease email and or post any leads....
Help....\n\nI need to implement COM3 and COM4 on a board that I'm designing and I'm\nfinding it dificult to track down a definition (hardware that is) of COM3\nand COM4.\n\nI have the IO adresses and the fact that COM3 shares IRQ4 with COM1 and COM4\nshares IRQ3 with COM2, except exactly how this IRQ sharing is done is not\nclear especially if the existing COM1/2 does not allow IRQ sharing. Does the\nstandard??? allow for a different IRQ to be used and if so how.\n\nPlease answer by email to :-\n\n      neil@stone.oz.au\n\nthanks in advance
Keith,\n\nI had a problem getting 256 colors (I was stuck with 16) even though\nthe flex-stuff said I was at 1024-256.

Sorry for the vaugeness, I hope it helps some.\n\nBTW, I have a GW2000-66V and 1M ATI GUP.
* Attention voters:\n*\n* I had a problem with my mailbox on the first day of voting.\n* Please check the Vote Acknowlegement (ACK) at the end of this CFV.\n* If your name/address is not there, please send your vote again.\n* (Actually, check even if you voted after the first day)\n\n\nIntroduction:\n\n	This is the third (and final) Call For Votes (CFV) for the creation\n	of four OS/2 newsgroups and the renaming of one:\n	(a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting     (unmoderated)\n	(b)  renaming of comp.os.os2.programmer to\n	     comp.os.os2.programmer.misc               (unmoderated)\n	(c)  comp.os.os2.setup                         (unmoderated)\n	(d)  comp.os.os2.multimedia                    (unmoderated)\n	(e)  comp.os.os2.bugs                          (unmoderated)\n\n	This is the second attempt at creating comp.os.os2.programmer.porting\n	and comp.os.os2.setup, and renaming comp.os.os2.programmer to\n	comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.  The first attempt failed in the summer\n	of 1992 (the voting deadline was August 31, 1992).  The voting rules\n	state that another attempt for creating newsgroups can be started\n	after a six month waiting period (in this case, it is March 1, 1993).\n	This is the first attempt at creating comp.os.os2.multimedia and\n	comp.os.os2.bugs.\n\n	This document contains:\n	*  the background showing the need for these proposals\n	*  the proposed charters for these proposals\n	*  voting instructions\n	*  a voting ballot\n	*  some example ballots\n	*  the voting rules\n	*  the voting schedule\n	*  the Mass Acknowledgement\n\n\nBackground:\n\n	The creation of two, free, 32-bit compilers for OS/2 2.x (gcc/2\n	and emx/gcc; read comp.os.os2.programmer for details) has spurred\n	a continuing deluge of software ported from UNIX platforms, such\n	as emacs, less, awk, grep, sed, xscheme, ispell, flex, yacc, and\n	much more.  Borland has released its C/C++ compiler for OS/2 2.x,\n	allowing for easier porting of DOS and Windows software.\n\n	Much of the PC hardware and drivers were written for DOS, and\n	later, Windows.  As more people are discovering OS/2 2.x, the\n	number of people asking questions about OS/2's compatibility\n	with their hardware increases, as does the questions on the\n	availability of drivers for their hardware, installation\n	procedures, etc.\n\n	Multimedia is becoming popular.  OS/2 2.0 supports Windows\n	Multimedia Extensions using Win-OS/2 3.0.  Furthermore, IBM is\n	including direct multimedia support in OS/2 starting with version\n	2.1 (in addition to using Win-OS/2 3.1).\n\n	Any non-trivial software will have bugs -- OS/2 is not exempt,\n	especially since IBM is constantly adding new features to OS/2.\n	So far, IBM has issued system patches and corrective service disks\n	(e.g.  the Service Pak) for free (free from BBSs and ftp sites, or\n	for free plus a small media charge for diskettes -- read\n	comp.os.os2.misc for details).\n\n\nProposed Charters:\n\n	(a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated)\n\n		It will provide a forum for developers of ported software so\n		as to coordinate efforts, avoid duplication of effort, and\n		spur additional development.  The group will also cover\n		topics such as porting from other platforms (such as DOS,\n		Windows, UNIX, etc), toolkits which aid in program\n		portability (including porting tools such as Mirrors), and\n		so forth.\n\n	(b)  rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated)\n\n		To keep the structure of the OS/2 newsgroup heirarchy\n		orthogonal, comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to\n		comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.\n\n		comp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup\n		for OS/2 programmers to discuss programming issues and\n		technical aspects of OS/2 in an unmoderated setting.\n\n	(c)  create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)\n\n		It will be devoted to OS/2 system setup topics, including the\n		availability of device drivers, compatibility information,\n		installation procedures, system requirements, and overall\n		performance optimization.\n\n	(d)  create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)\n\n		It will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues.\n\n	(e)  create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)\n\n		It will provide a forum for OS/2 system bug reports, bug\n		diagnosis and work arounds, the availability of system\n		patches and corrective service disks, and so forth.\n\n		[Note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other\n		newsgroups, and discussion of bugs in OS/2 betas belong in\n		comp.os.os2.beta]\n\n\nHow to Vote:\n\n	To cast your vote, fill out the ballot below and e-mail it to me.\n	Many newsreaders will allow e-mail to be sent by replying to this\n	post.  Be sure to send only the ballot, and edit out the rest of\n	this post.\n\n	1)  Type in your vote for each proposal:\n\n	    If you favor the charter as proposed, put a "yes" after its name.\n	    If you oppose the charter as proposed, put a "no" after its name.\n	    To abstain, leave a blank after its name.\n\n	2)  Type in your last name (i.e. your family name), a comma, and\n	    your first name (i.e. your personal name).\n\n	3)  Cut out the ballot,  Please do not delete any lines of the\n	    ballot.\n\n	4)  E-mail your ballot to mlevis@lonestar.utsa.edu before 11:59:59 pm\n	    (Central Time), April 24, 1993.\n\n\nBallot:\n\n----------------cut here----------------cut here----------------cut here----\n\n        (a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting:\n        (b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc:\n        (c)              comp.os.os2.setup:\n        (d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia:\n        (e)               comp.os.os2.bugs:\n\n        (f)       voter's last, first name:\n\n        e-mail ballot to mlevis@lonestar.utsa.edu by April 24\n\n----cut here----------------cut here----------------cut here----------------\n\n\nExample Ballot #1:\n\n	(a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: yes\n	(b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: yes\n	(c)              comp.os.os2.setup: no\n	(d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia:\n	(e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: no\n\n	(f)       voter's last, first name: Smith, John\n\n	In this example, John Smith favors comp.os.os2.programmer.porting\n	to be created, and comp.os.os2.programmer to be renamed to\n	comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.  He also opposes the creation of\n	comp.os.os2.setup and comp.os.os2.bugs.  He does not have a view\n	on the creation of comp.os.os2.multimedia. \n\n\nExample Ballot #2:\n\n	(a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: yes\n	(b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: yes\n	(c)              comp.os.os2.setup: yes\n	(d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia: yes\n	(e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: yes\n\n	(f)       voter's last, first name: Doe, Jane\n\n	In this example, Jane Doe favors the creation or rename of all\n	the proposals.\n\n\nVoting Rules:\n\n	* One vote per person.  If you vote more than once, only the most\n	  recent vote will be counted.\n\n	* Votes must be mailed to me by the person voting.  Proxy voting,\n	  forwarding, posting votes to a newsgroup, etc. will not be counted.\n\n	* Do not ask how the votes are going.  The status of the votings\n	  will be revealed only after the poll closes.\n\n	* I will acknowledge votes by Mass Acknowledgement (ACK).  I will\n	  post the ACK twice (see Schedule below).\n\n	* If you need help for using your editor, using e-mail, how\n	  voting works in general, etc. then ask an expert at your site.\n	  Also see the ``How To Create a New Newsgroup'' article which is\n	  posted to news.answers on a regular basis.\n\n	* If you need any clarifications on voting procedures for this\n	  CFV, send me e-mail at mlevis@ringer.cs.utsa.edu.\n\n	* When the voting period is over (see Schedule below), a proposal\n	  passes if both of the following formulas are true:\n	  1)  the number of YES votes exceeds the number of NO votes\n	      by at least 100 (i.e. YES >= NO + 100, or YES - NO >= 100).\n	  2)  the number of YES votes exceeds at least twice the\n	      number of NO votes (i.e. YES >= 2 * NO, or YES - NO >= NO).\n	  In other words, a proposal passes if:\n	      YES - NO >= max (100, NO)\n	  where max() returns the highest number given to it.\n\n\nSchedule:\n\n	The voting period started on March 29 when the first CFV was posted\n	by David Lawrence (the news.announce.newgroups moderator).\n\n	This third CFV is a repeat of the first CFV, but it also has the\n	Mass Acknowledgement (ACK) of names and e-mail addresses of those who\n	have already voted -- re-send your vote if it is not there.  If you\n	have not voted yet, vote now!\n\n	The voting period will end at 11:59:59 pm (Central Time), on\n	April 24, 1993.  Votes received after that time will not count.\n	The voting results and tally will be posted shortly after that\n	date.\n\n\nMass Acknowledgement:\n\n	Here is the list of people who have already sent in their ballots\n	as of 12:01 am (Central Time) on April 15, 1993:\n\n                          bdubbs@cs.tamu.edu\nAiyagari, Sanjay          ska1@crux3.cit.cornell.edu\nAlcorn, Justin

Oh yeah! I just got my new Eizo Flexscan yesterday (to replace my old 8515), and\nI tried it with 1360x1024. This mode is just great! I can get four perfectly readable\ncommand windows on the screen! And if I need more colors, I can go back to 1024x768\nor even 800x600.\nOne thing I am wondering though: Why isn't there a MONxxxx.DGS file which contains\nALL the resolutions up to 1360x1024? Now I have to change the XGASETUP.PRO every\ntime I want to switch, instead of simply going through the system settings of OS/2.\nRegards, Martin Erzberger
The joystick reads in anolog values through a digital port. How?\n    You send a command to the port to read it, then you time how long\n    it takes for the joystick port to set a certain bit.  This time\n    is proportional to the joystick position.  Obviously, since time\n    is used as a position, you cannot get rid of this ridiculus waste \n    of time.  If you wrote your own routine instead of the BIOS, it\n    would speed it up some, but the time would still be there.\n\n--
Could anybody please provide me a copy of the Windows 3.1 drivers and grabbers\nfrom Orchid Technologies for use with their ProDesigner IIs ISA video card? Currently I do not have access to a modem to dial out to Orchid BBS.\nIf you can help me, please do any of the following, wichever is most convenient\nto you:\n\n1)\nCopy the binary files to a directory readable by any user in any cell of the\nAndrew File System\n\n2)\nUpload the binary files to an anonymous FTP site (where allowed).\n\n3)\nuuencode the files and send them to me by electronic mail.\n\nPlease notify me by electronic mail at\ntowwang@caen.engin.umich.edu\n\nThanks in advance.
However, also be aware that Implementor's notes are basicly\nrecommendations, they are *NOT* part of the spec.  As others have\nnoted, many vendors (including SGI) violate this.  Indeed, the main\npoint is to reduce impedance changes, and therefore reflections, and\ntherefore 'noise' on the bus.
Like who, f'rinstance?  When I bought my system (November), no first, second,\nor third tier vendor could touch the price for the hardware/software\ncombination I got from GW2000.\n\n\nIf you were selling as many systems as fast as GW2000, you'd end up with four\nor five pissed-off customers too.  And four or five ecstatic ones.  And lots\nof satisfied ones...\n\n\nDon't minimize this; if you buy mail order, it's a good thing to know that\nyou'll get replacements parts, no questions asked, in a day or two, via FedEx.\n\n\nWhich they do in the vast majority of cases.  Remember that it's only the\npeople on the tails of the curve who are motivated to write -- the ones who\nlove it, and the ones who hate it.  You don't hear from the folks in the\nmiddle very often...
Excerpts from netnews.comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware: 19-Apr-93 AMD i486\nclones: Now legal .. by poe@wharton.upenn.edu \n\nIt's true.

^^^^^^^^^^^^\nHow do you do bus-mastering on the ISA bus?\n\n\nIf we're talking ISA (AT) bus here, then you can only have 1 DMA channel\nactive at any one time, presumably transferring data from a single device.\nSo even though you can have at least 7 devices on a SCSI bus, explain how\nall 7 of those devices can to DMA transfers through a single SCSI card\nto the ISA-AT bus at the same time.\n\nAlso, I'm still trying to track down a copy of IBM's AT reference book,\nbut from their PC technical manual (page 2-93):
There would be no problems as long as the OS didn't set up a DMA transfer\nto an area above the 16 mb area (the DMA controller probably can't be\nprogrammed that way anyways, so there probably isin't a problem with this)
Except for the fact that it's superior in just about every way to\nthe ISA Bus.\n\n\n	Except for the new systems that now ship only with IDE controllers.
It depends on what you'd like your joystick for.  I've seen Gravis\njoysticks at Radio Shack.  They seemed flimsy and didn't fit well in my\nhand.  I have heard on c.s.i.p.games that they don't last well (less than\na year) on flightsims.  One redeeming feature does seem to be the ability\nto adjust the tension of the stick.\n\nI recently purchased a CH Flightstick.  There aren't any suction cups and\nno tension adjusters but otherwise it seems to be an excellent joystick. \nI'm currently using it for the Wing Commander series and Red Baron.  Works\nquite well.  The large base does not require a steadying hand and so\nleaves it free.  The buttons provide good tactile response (you can hear\nand feel them well).  There are other models made by CH that can go up or\ndown in features.\n\nFor price comparison Gravis analogue joysticks sell for ~$35.00 here\ncompared to the $45.00 I paid for a CH Flightstick.  I think the extra\n$10.00 is worth it just in feel.  Best thing to do is to ask a salesperson\nto let you try them out or at least feel it before you buy.\n\nJust another note, analogue joysticks are best for flightsims or something\nthat needs sensitive touch.  If you're only playing games such as Castle\nWolfenstein or some other game that only uses digital input (ie. only up,\ndown, left, etc. instead of 'how much right') you might want to look into\na Gravis gamepad.  They look like a Nintendo control pad but I don't know\nmuch beyond that.

Hi,\n\nI just bought a Mitsumi CD-ROM drive and a SB Pro soundcard.  The pin outs on\nthe CD-ROM line-out and the SB Pro CD-IN are not the same.  I am considering\ntaking the RCA output jacks on the Mitsumi interface card and routing them to\nthe line-in input on the SB Pro.  Will this work with multi-media software\nthat uses the CD-ROM and the SB Pro or do I need to go to the CD-IN pins on\nthe SB-Pro.\n\nThanks,\n\nJohn\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since the Quadra is the only Mac able to deal with 5MB/s and Hard drives START\nat 160MB I have NO idea.\nFor the Mac I have the following {These are ALL external}\n 20MB $299 {$15/MB}\n 52MB $379 {$7.3/MB}\n 80MB $449 {$5.63/MB}\n120MB $569-$639 {$4.75-$5.33/MB\n210MB $979-$1029{$4.67-$4.90/MB}\n320MB $1499-$1549 {$4.68-$4.84/MB}\n510MB $1999-$2119 ($3.92-$4.31/MB}\netc\n\nSo scsi-1/SCSI-2 for the Mac goes down in price/MB as hard drive size goes\nup {and I assume the same for the PC world.}

I'm buying a new system this week to replace my brain dead 286, and\ncould use some feedback on a couple systems I'm looking at if anyone is\nfamiliar with them.\n \n        The system that looks the most interesting is the Budget 486/66 VLB\ntower.  For about $2343 (delivered) it offers VLB, 8MB, 200MB IDE, a Mitsumi\nCD-ROM (with software bundle), Media Vision Sound board, 14" CTX 1468NI,\n128K Cache, and the usual drives, ports, & OS software.  Since my budget is\n$2350 for a system, it seems almost too good to be true (which may mean it\nIS too good to be true, of course). Among other things, I've never seen a\nreview of the Budget systems (or their parent company, Micro Smart), or of\nthe motherboard they are using (the Aetana).

I'm familiar with the\nfirm but not the product line - and some idea of their quality would be abig\nbenefit here as well.\n \n        Any other suggestions in the price range would be appreciated - my\ngreatest needs are speed and graphics capabilities.\n \n	Email response would be greatly appreciated.\n\n	Thanks,\n\n--

Hi,\n\nI am going through a box of old IBM card and came across one called a \n\nRapid Technology SQUEEZE card.  It is dated 1990 and has a 54mhz crystal on\nit and a big chip that has 'C-Cube' on it.\n\nNo connectors to the outside, but a ribbon-type 50-pin connector on the board.\n\nIt is a 16-bit board.\n\nAny ideas what it is?\n\n\nPhil\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nPhil Hunt                          "Wherever you go, there you are!"\nHowtek, Inc.
You are making the same mistake I did: you are confusing the DRIVE\ninterface to the DATA THROUGHPUT interface.  Again from my Mac & IBM info\nsheet {available by FTP on sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the\ninfo-mac/report as mac-ibm-compare173.txt}:\nExpansion\nBoth Mac & IBM\nSCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.\n Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card \n expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  Apple developed some \n specifications for SCSI controlers while IBM has no exact controller \n specifications {which results in added incompatibilities on IBM machines}.  \n Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal \n terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port \n {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the \n end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. \nSCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}\n and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer base.  16-bit SCSI-1 requires a\n SCSI-2 controler chip and can provide only fast SCSI-2 not wide SCSI-2\n which are both 16-bit interfaces {see SCSI-2}.\nSCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully\n SCSI-1 complient and tends to be implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it \n needs a different controller interface in both hardware {which tends to be \n very expendsive} and software.  Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst \n {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst\n {32-bit/wide and fast}.  SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode is limited to 7 devices and\n reduced 8-bit or 16-bit {fast only} throughput due to the difference between\n SCSI-1 and wide SCSI-2 ports.\n\nIBM\nHD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}:\n[...]\nIDE:  Integrated Device Electronics \n currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized \n drives. Can have more than one hard drive. Asynchronous Transfer: ~5MB/s max.\n\nSo at its LOWEST setting SCSI-2 interface in Asynchronous SCSI-1 mode AVERAGES \nthe through put MAXIMUM of IDE in asynchronous mode.  In full SCSI-2 mode\nit blows poor IDE out the window, down the street, and into the garbage can.\nThe problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put\nrates and THAT is where the bottleneck and cost of SCSI-2 comes from.  NOT\nthe interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the\nSCSI-2 through put.  The cost of SCSI interface is a self fulliling\nprophisy: few people buy SCSI because it is so expencive for the PC, which\nin turn convices makes that mass producing SCSI {which would reduce its\ncost} is unwarented, and so SCSI is expencive. {That is the effect of the\nRule of Scale: the more items sold the less EACH item has to bare the brunt\nthe cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost}
Hello netters,\n\n	I have a question concerning SCSI on DOS.\n\n	I have a ST01 SCSI controller and two hard-disks conected\n	(id's 0 and 1). I'd like to connect a SCSI streamer, but I\n	don't have software to access it. Does such a beast exist\n	as shareware or PD ?\n	\n	Also what if I want a third disk ? I know that DOs only can\n	"see" two two physical and four logical disks. Will it be\n	possible to use extra disks ?\n\n	Thanks in advance.\n\n	Ib
[]\n\n	"These LPT1, COM1, disk controller are call devices.  There are\n	devices that requires exclusive interrupt ownership, eg. disk\n	controller (I6) and keyboard (I1).  There are also devices that\n	does not require exclusive ownership, ie. it will share an\n	interrupt with another device, eg. LPT1"\n\nNo.  In a standard ISA bus, the one that almost all non-laptop PCs use,\ntwo separate interface cards cannot share an interrupt.  This is due to\na screwup in the bus design.  For example, if your Soundblaster wants\nto drive interrupt number 7, then it must hold a certain bus wire to 0\nor 1 at all times, depending on whether or not it wants an interrupt.\nThis precludes letting another card assert interrupt number 7.\n\nWhen two or more devices in an ISA bus PC share an interrupt, it's\nbecause they're implemented by a single card.

[stuff deleted]\n\nI recently bought a Leading Edge 80386DX-33 <mini tower case> and everything\nworks fine. Leading Edge seems to be a decent brand and what-not. I would\ntend to say that it is a decent deal. The only things you might want to be\nwary about is that my L.E. computer has a back-plane mounted motherboard.\nIe: The motherboard itself is a card that can be plugged in to a backplane.\nSome people don't like these configurations. The second thing is that\nwhoever set up my computer at the factory didn't really know what they were\ndoing. The installed windows video driver didn't even take advantage of the\nSVGA card/Monitor. Look forward to configuring the system optimally\nyourself.

I also have a DX2/66 and a Maxtor 212. I have a local bus IDE controller (generic) and I get\n985 KB/s. I tried swapping my local bus IDE controller for an ISA IDE controller and my\ntransfer rate went to 830 KB/s. The specs for this drive show a maximum platter to controller\ntransfer rate of 2.83 MB/s. I dont know how to get there from here. The local bus interface\ngot me a little, but certainly not as much as I had hoped. I am also looking for a way to \nimprove my disk performance, but Im not convinced that the controller is the bottleneck\n(although Im willing to entertain the possibility that it is).

Hi to all you PC gurus!\n\nI'm new to these groups and so please forgive me if my questions are frequently\nasked, but I don't know the answer :) I've been recently having some problems\nwith my 386 computer with a Seagate 40 meg hard drive. I occasionally find\ncorrupted files, but most of the time programs work fine. Are there any utilities\nthat are easily available that can help me determine whether or not the problem\nis a result of the hard drive vs an ill-behaved program or some other hardware\nitem? Are there utilites to determine whether or not the hard drive is properly\naligned etc? As might be expected, I would greatly appreciate any help on this\nmatter. I'm considering just reformatting the disk and reinstalling everything\n(and hoping that will fix the problem), but I would like to have some assurance\nof what the problem cause is. \n\nAlso, can someone give me an opinion on DOS 6.0? Are the compression and\ndefragmentation routines good enough to consider the upgrade if I don't have\nthose routines already (as opposed to buying them separately)? \n\n\nMuch thanks in advance for any help.
I have been able to successfully use both 16 and 24 bit color modes on my\nGateway system, although my setup is less complicated than yours.  It sounds as\nif you may have a hardware conflict or problem.  Is your memory aperture above\n16M?  I have heard rumors of incompatibilities with that SCSI card with a\nvariety of systems.  Call up Gateway and give them hell until they help you\nfix it.\n\nDan
Hi,\n\nI just inherited an NCR 1204 external floppy.  This thing has every port known to man on the back.\nThe question is: Does anyone know how to connect this thing to a PC. What hardware is needed?\nSoftware?\n\nTIA,\nAlex
This might be a silly question but I have to ask it anyway. I am in\nthe process of purchasing an EISA/VL Bus 486 DX2-66 computer and I\nfound two places that sell machines that have what I want and have the\nsame price. The first is Ares and they use a Cache motherboard (that's\nthe brand of the motherboard) with OPTI chip set, the other is Micron\n(formerly Edge Technology) and they use the Micronics EISA/VLB\nmotherboard.\n\nI said that this might be a silly question since I believe that\nMicronics is a very well known motherboard manufacturer while I never\nheard of Cache! I am however leaning towards the Ares machine because\nmy impression is that they are known for building good, solid machines\nand they have good tech support (24 hr, 7 days/wk), and a better\nwarrantee (2 years).  Micron, on the other hand, seems to have\nrecently aquired Edge Technologies and I'm not sure how much I should\ntrust the company.\n\nI would REALLY appreciate any input on this. Is the Micron machine the\nclear choice?  Does anyone know anything positive or negative about\neither company? Has anyone ever heard of Cache motherboards? Should I\ngo with Micron just because it has the Micronics motherboard? etc.\n\nThanks very much in advance for any information.
I have a Maxtor 212MB on an ISA IDE controller, although my machine is\nDX2/66 VLB. I has the save transfer rate of 0.647 MB/s regardless of\nthe variations of the ISA bus speed. I tested it with speed between\n5.5MHz and 8.33MHz. Not _any_ difference. The problem is not the\ninterface between the controller and the memory.\n\nMy advice: Buy 4Megs of RAM, save $70 and enjoy performance.\n\n--\nPenio Penev  x7423 (212)327-7423 (w) Internet: penev@venezia.rockefeller.edu

If you are \nconsidering buying one or the other, definitely go for the DX with a nice \nsize external cache!

Neither \nsystems could actually run a program out of main memory, since DRAM is \nstill too slow for that high of bus speed ( 60ns = 16.66MHz < 50MHz ).\n\n-rdd\n\n---\n . WinQwk 2.0b#0 .

Hai,\n\nIn a few days I'm going to buy a new motherboard with local-bus(ses).\nIt comes with a Cirrus Logic VLB card which has 2Mb RAM onboard.\nIt can do true-color but I don't know what type of card it is.\nI read that Cirrus Logic cards aren't exactly the fastes around.\n\nMy old system had a TSENG 4000. I was pretty pleased with it, so I\nconsider buying a W32/TSENG card. I'd like to know a few things:\n\n	- How is the speed/performance in DOS/Windows/Unix/OS/2\n	  Graphics & Text (also compared to S3 cards for example)\n	- What resolutions (including no. of colors) does it\n	  support (text & graphics)\n	- How many RAM can be installed and what type of RAM\n	- Compatibility with old TSENG 4000\n	- Support in software\n\nIf anyone has any experience with this card (good or bad) I'd like\nto know. If you have a better alternative than the W32 please tell\nme about it.\n\n\nFor the people in Holland:\nKan iemand me misschien vertellen waar de W32 in Nederland te verkrijg\nis? Het liefst in de omgeving van Amsterdam!
you  need to massage few switches in your system.ini.\nin the virtual memory section, flip the 32bitaccess switch on and the \nassociated driver (wdctl or some such) switch on.  this will enable\n32bit access, but be sure you can use it, as not all hard drives\nand controllers support it !  \n\n\n...for seriously fast disk access:\n\n1)  throw out WINDOZE\n2)  install OS/2\n\ni did this weekend - OS/2 is incredible.  finally a REAL OS for\nthe humble PC  :)
Cyrix have released a 386 pin-conpatible 486 clone. Designed to upgrade\nold 16 & 20MHz 386's the chips are also clockdoubling. Thus a 16MHz 386\ncan be transformed into a 32MHz 486, with a single chip upgrade.\n\nUnfortunately in Australia the DRu2 sells for $700A (16MHz) and $1000A\n(20MHz), about 1.5x the price of a 486dx33 motherboard with two vlb slots!!!\n\nHow much do these thing cost in the States?\nHow well do they work?\n\nThanks for any info,
