Flights of fancy, and other irrational approaches, are common.  The crucial\nthing is not to sit around just having fantasies; they aren't of any use\nunless they make you do some experiments.  I've known a lot of scientists\nwhose fantasies lead them on to creative work; usually they won't admit\nout loud what the fantasy was, prior to the consumption of a few beers.\n\n(Simple example: Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DNA\nelectrophoresis gel of human ALU fragments.  He got very excited, hoping that\nhe'd seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic\ngenes.  This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out\nbinding assays.  The result was a well-conserved, 400 or so bp, sequence\nthat occurs about 500,000 times in the human genome.  Unfortunately for\nWarren's fantasy, it turns out to be a transposon that is present in\nso many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into\nthe genome.  On the other hand, the characteristics of transposons were\nmuch elucidated; the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was\nrecognized; and the standard method of recognizing human DNA was created.\nOther species have different sets of transposons.  Fortunately for me,\nWarren and I used to eat dinner at T.G.I. Fridays all the time.)\n\n\nI'm not sure that it's random.  But there is no known rational mechanism\nfor generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses.  If you are really\nworking in an unknown area, it is unlikely that you will have much sense\nof what might or might not be true; under those circumstances, the best\nthing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have.  If they are wrong,\nyou will find out soon enough; but at least, you will find out _something_.\nIf you try to do experiments at random, with no prior conceptions at all\nin mind, you will probably get nowhere.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the critical function does sometimes become hostage to\nnon-rational forces.  Then we get varieties of pathological science:\nLysenko, Mirsky's opposition to DNA-as-gene, cold fusion, and so forth.\n\n\nI don't agree that this follows.  In fact, this is _exactly_ the point at\nwhich I disagree with Feyerabend.  It is a most important part of the\nculture of science that one keeps one's jealousies out of the refereeing\nprocess.  Failures there are aplenty, but, on the whole, things work out.\n\nAnother point: there are a couple of senses of the phrase ``experimental\ndesign''.  I'd say that the less rational part is in experimental _choice_,\nnot design.  Alexander Fleming (Proc. Royal Soc., 1922) chose to look for\nbacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons (Phage had previously\nbeen found in locust diarrhea; Fleming probably thought runny bottom, runny\nnose, what the hell, it's worth a try.) but his method of looking for phage\nwas well-designed to detect anything phage-like; in fact, he found lysozyme.\n\n\nIt is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs. irrational.  Perhaps\nyou can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried out\nfor perfectly rational reasons, or interesting new theories that were first\nadvanced from logical grounds.  The main examples I can think of are from\nmodern high-energy physics which is not typical of science as a whole.
Elevated levels of Glu and Asp in the blood are able to bypass the\nBlood-brain barrier through the circumventricular organs (or CVO), in\nparticular the adeno and neurohypophysis (pituitary gland) areas.  The\narcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the median eminence regions\nare particularly effected.  CVO areas are not subject to the\nblood-brain barrier. These areas control the release of gonadotropin,\nwhich controls the release and flux of steroids governing development,\nespecially sexual development. Changes in adult rats, which are less\nsensitive to Glu than humans, have been observed: after ingesting Glu,\non a chronic basis, cycles of several steroids are disrupted. Blood\nlevels of somatostatin are significantly reduced, and cyclic release\nof steroids becomes flattened.
Can one develop inner-ear problems from too much flying?  I hear that pilots\nand steward/esses have a limit as to the maximum number of flying hours --\nwhat are these limits?  What are the main problems associated with too many\nlong-haul (over 4 hours) trips?
So antihistamines can cause weight gain.  NOW they tell me. :-)\nIs there any way to find out which do & which don't?  My doctor\nobviously is asleep at the wheel.\n\nThe original poster mentioned fatigue.  I had that too, but it was\nmostly due to the really bizarre dreams I was having -- I wasn't getting\nany rest.  My doctor said that was a common reaction.  If astemizole\ndoesn't cross the blood-brain barrier, how does it cause that side\neffect?  Any ideas?\n\n--
I attribute my success to several factors:\n\nVery low fat.  Except when someone else has cooked a meal for me,\nI only eat fruit, vegetables, and whole grain or bran cereals.  I\nestimate I only get about 5 to 10 percent of my calories from fat.\n\nVery little sugar or salt.\n\nVery high fiber.  Most Americans get about 10 grams.  25 to 35 are\nrecommended.  I get between 50 and 150.  Sometimes 200.  (I've heard\nof people taking fiber pills.  It seems unlikely that pills can\ncontain enough fiber to make a difference.  It would be about as\nlikely as someone getting fat by popping fat pills.  Tablets are\njust too small, unless you snarf down hundreds of them daily.)\n\nMy "clean your plate" conditioning works *for* me.  Eating the last\n10% takes half my eating time, and gives satiety a chance to catch\nup, so I don't still feel hungry and go start eating something else.\n\nI don't eat when I'm not hungry (unless I'm sure I'll get hungry\nshortly, and eating won't be practical then).\n\nI bike to work, 22 miles a day, year round.  Fast.  I also bike to\nstores, movies, and everywhere else, as I've never owned a car.\nI estimate this burns about 1000 calories a day.  It also helps\nbuild and maintain muscle mass, prevent insulin resistance (diabetes\nruns in my family), and increase my metabolism.  (Even so, my\nmetabolism is so low that when I'm at rest I'm most comfortable\nwith a temperature in the 90s (F), and usually wear a sweater if\nit drops to 80.)  Cycling also motivates me to avoid every excess\nounce.  (Cyclists routinely pay a premium for cycling products that\nweigh slightly less than others.  But it's easier and cheaper to trim\nweight from the rider than from the vehicle.)\n\nThere's no question in my mind that my metabolism is radically\ndifferent from that of most people who have never been fat.  Fortunately,\nit isn't different in a way that precludes excellent health.\n\nObviously, I can't swear that every obese person who does what I've\ndone will have the success I did.  But I've never yet heard of one who\ndid try it and didn't succeed.\n\n\nI'm sure everyone's weight cycles, whether or not they've ever been fat.\nI usually eat extremely little salt.  When I do eat something salty,\nmy weight can increase overnight by as much as ten pounds.  It comes\noff again over a week or two.\n-- \nKeith Lynch, kfl@access.digex.com

As nobody in the food industry has even bothered to address my previous\nquestion "WHY DO YOU NEED TO PUT MSG IN ALMOST EVERY FOOD?" I must assume\nthat my wife's answer is closer to the truth than I hoped it was.\n\nShe believes that MSG is added to food to cause people to eat more of it\nand not quit when they shoud be sated.  To put it a different way, she \nbelieves that for some people MSG causes them to act toward food like an addict.  \n(Eat all the chips, chow down on several packages of noodle soup .... you get the\nidea! }  IF she is right, then the moral and ethical standards of the \nfood, chemical and regulatory groups need to be addressed!!!  Can MSG\nbe considered a conditioning substance (not addictive but sort of habit\nforming) ?\n\nThis brings up a side question of mine.   I have noticed that cats (my\nchildren's and my parent's) seem to fixate on a particular brand of pet\nfood. The cat will eat any product within one brand and not any other\nbrand.  I have wondered if this is not a case of preference, but, some\nsort of chemical training or addiction. My questions, for the net, are:\nDoes the FDA regulate the contents of pet food?  Is it allowed for pet\nfood to contain addictive or conditioning substances?  Is MSG put in \npet food?\n\n-----------------------------------\nI speak for myself and not Motorola\n-----------------------------------
-*----\n\nI think that Lee Lady and I are talking at cross purposes.\nAbove, Lady seems concerned with the contrast between great\nscience that makes big advances in our knowledge and mediocre\nscience that makes smaller steps.  In most of this thread, I have\nbeen concerned with the difference between what is science and\nwhat is not. \n\nLee Lady is correct when she asserts that the difference between\nEinstein and the average post-doc physicist is the quality of\ntheir thought.  But what is the difference between Einstein and a\ngenius who would be a great scientist but whose great thoughts\nare scientifically screwy?  (Some would give Velikovsky or\nKorzybski as examples.  If you don't like these, choose your\nown.)  I say it is the same as the difference between the mediocre\nphysicist and the mediocre proponent of qi.  Both Einstein and\nthe mediocre physcists have disciplined their work from the\ncumulative knowledge of how previous researchers went wrong.\nBoth Velikovsky and the mediocre proponent of qi have failed to\ndo this.  \n\nLet me approach this from a second direction.  When one is asked\nto review a paper for a journal or conference, there are many\nkinds of criticism that one can make.  One kind of criticism is\nthat the work is just wrong or misinformed.  Another kind of\ncriticism is that the work, while technically correct, is either\nnot important or not interesting.  The first difference is the\none that I have been pointing to.  The second difference is the\none that Lee Lady seems to be discussing. \n\n\nI have often pointed out that for homeopathy to be considered \nscientific, what is needed is a test of its theoretical claims,\nnot just of some of its proposed remedies.  Similarly, I suspect\nthat traditional Chinese medicine has many remedies that work;\nwhat it lacks (as one example) is any experiment that tests the\npresence of qi.\n\n\nCertainly a "theoretical structure that makes sense" is the goal.\nIn areas where we do not yet have this, I see nothing wrong with\nforming and testing smaller hypotheses.  Let's face it: we cannot\nalways wait for an Einstein to come along and make everything\nclear for us.  Sometimes those of us who are not Einstein have to\nplug along and make small amounts of progress as best we can.

When did he get the transfusions?\n\n-- \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGordon Banks  N3JXP      | "Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and\ngeb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon."

Dr. willian Horatio Bates born 1860 and graduated from med school\n1885.  Medical career hampered by spells of total amnesia.  Published in\n1920, his great work "The Cure of Imperfect Eyesight by Treatment With-\nout Glasses", He made claims about how the eye actually works that are\nsimply NOT TRUE.  Aldous Huxley was one of the more "high profile"\nbeleivers in his system.  Mr. Huxley while giving a lecture on Bates system\nforgot the lecture that he was supposedely reading and had to put the\npaper right up to his eyes and then resorted to a magnifying glass from\nhis pocket.  book have been written debunking this technique, however\nthey remain less read than the original fraud.  cheers

Outbreaks of a chronic-mono-like entity were originally called EBS (or\nsome variant thereof) because most of the people with this disease had\nelevated levels of antibodies to the EBV virus. But not all of them\ndid, which prompted an official renaming of the disease to Chronic\nFatigue Syndrome (this renaming took place in the Annals of Internal\nMedicine, Jan. 1988, I believe). Now it's also called Chronic Fatigue\nand Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS), since it seems clear that\nsome sort of immune disregulation is causing the probs.\n\nAstonishly, there are still docs who tell people with massively\nswollen glands, recurrent fevers and nightsweats, etc., that there's\nnothing wrong with them. This is not the same thing as saying that the\nsyndrome may have a (at least partly) psychological cause. The\ndisagreement among people whose thoughts are worth considering centers\non just what the cause is. No one knows, but theories include:\npsychological stress, some sort of virus (a retrovirus, say most --\nmaybe one of the newly discovered herpes viruses), environmental\ntoxins, bacteria (and, yes, candida), genes, (and/)or some combo of\nthese.\n\nThere's no outright cure at the moment, but different docs try\ndifferent things, some of which seem to help.\n\nMassive amounts of info on the condition are available these days.\nPost your Q to alt.med.cfs, and you will be flooded w/facts.
No, there's no evidence that would convince any but the most credulous.\n\nThe "evidence" is identical to the sort of evidence that has been\nused to justify all sorts of quack treatments for quack diseases\nin the past.\n\n\nI like the implication here.  It must not be that the quacks making\nmillions off such "diseases" are biased -- rather that those who\ndoubt their existence don't understand the real world.  It seems\neasy to picture a 19th centure snake oil salesman saying the same\nthing.\n\nHowever, I have been in the trenches long enough to have seen multiple\nquack diseases rise and fall in popularity.  "Systemic yeast syndome"\nseems to be making a resurgence (it had fallen off a few years ago).\nThere will be new such "diseases" I'm sure with best-selling books\nand expensive therapies.\n\n\nWell this, of course, is convincing.  I guess I'd better start diagnosing\nany illnesses that people want so that I can keep my lips.
Hismanal (astemizole) is most definitely linked to weight gain.\nIt really is peculiar that some antihistamines have this effect,\nand even more so an antihistamine like astemizole which purportedly\ndoesn't cross the blood-brain barrier and so tends not to cause\ndrowsiness.
[lots of editing out of previuos posts]\n\n\n\nFunny about that... my wife (my girlfriend at the time) used to get sick \nafter eating certain foods at various Asian restaurants, and never knew \nwhy.  She'd go pale, and sweaty and then vomit copiously.  A couple of us \nventured a connection with MSG, and her response was: "MSG?  What's that?".  \nIt also happened when she pigged out on some brands of savoury crackers and \nchips... which I noticed (later) had MSG on the label.  Don't know about \ndouble blinds, but avoiding MSG has stopped her being sick at restaurants.\n\n\ncheers, John
There has been NO hard info provided about MSG making people ill.\nThat's the point, after all.\n\n\nThat's because these "peer-reviewed" studies are not addressing\nthe effects of MSG in people, they're looking at animal models.\nYou can't walk away from this and start ranting about gloom and\ndoom as if there were any documented deleterious health effects\ndemonstrated in humans.  Note that I wouldn't have any argument\nwith a statement like "noting that animal administration has pro-\nduced the following [blah, blah], we must be careful about its\nuse in humans."  This is precisely NOT what you said.\n\n\nIt most certainly is for neurotoxicology.  You know, studies of\nglutamate involve more than "food science".\n\n\nSo, point us to the studies in humans, please.  I'm familiar with\nthe literature, and I've never seen any which relate at all to\nOlney's work in animals and the effects of glutamate on neurons.\n\n\nWell, actually, they HAVE to tolerate some phenylalanine; it's a\nessential amino acid.  They just try to get as little as is healthy\nwithout producing dangerous levels of phenylalanine and its metabolites\nin the blood.\n\n\nGoodness, I'm not saying that it's good to feed infants a lot of\nglutamate-supplemented foods.  It's just that this "projected safety\nmargin" is a construct derived from animal models and given that,\nyou can "prove" anything you like.  We're talking prudent policy in\ninfant nutrition here, yet you're misrepresenting it as received wisdom.\n\n\nYou mean "asserting".  You're being intellectually dishonest (or just\nplain confused), because you're conflating reports which do not necessarily\nhave anything to do with each other.  Olney's reports would argue a potential\nfor problems in human infants, but that's not to say that this says anything\nwhatsoever about the use of MSG in most foods, nor does he provide any\nstudies in humans which indicate any deleterious effects (for obvious\nreasons.)  It says nothing about MSG's contribtion to the phenomenon\nof the "Chinese Restaurant Syndrome".  It says nothing about the frequent\ninability to replicate anecdotal reports of MSG sensitivity in the lab.\n\n\nProbably one of the dumber remarks you've made.
-*----\n\nMing-zhou Liu's main problem is that he has an incompetent\nphysician -- himself.  This physician has diagnosed a problem,\neven though he probably has never seen the diagnosed disease\nbefore and has no idea of what kinds of problems can present\nsimilar symptoms.  This physician now wants to treat his first\ncase of this disease without any help from the medical community.\n\nThe best thing Ming-zhou Liu could do is fire his current\nphysician and seek out a better one.
Snort.  Ah, there go my sinuses again.\n\n\nOh, wow.  A classic textbook.  Hey, they laughed at Einstein, too!\n\n\nYeah, I'll bet.  Tomorrow, the world.\n\nListen, uncontrolled studies like this are worthless.\n\n\nI'm sure you are.  You sound like the typical hysteric/hypochondriac who\nresponds to "miracle cures."\n\n\nYeah, "it makes sense to me", so of course it should be taken seriously.\nSnort.\n\n\nYeah, "it sounds reasonable to me".\n\n\nOh, really?  _What_ tests?  Immune-compromised, my ass.\nMore like credulous malingerer.  This is a psychiatric syndrome.\n\n\nYou know, it's a shame that a drug like itraconazole is being misused\nin this way.  It's ridiculously expensive, and potentially toxic.\nThe trouble is that it isn't toxic enough, so it gets abused by quacks.\n\n\nThe only good thing about nystatin is that it's (relatively) cheap\nand when taken orally, non-toxic.  But oral nystatin is without any\nsystemic effect, so unless it were given IV, it would be without\nany effect on your sinuses.  I wish these quacks would first use\nIV nystatin or amphotericin B on people like you.  That would solve\nthe "yeast" problem once and for all.\n\n\nPerhaps a little Haldol would go a long way towards ameliorating\nyour symptoms.\n\nAre you paying for this treatment out of your own pocket?  I'd hate\nto think my insurance premiums are going towards this.
The FDA, I believe.  Rules say no blood or blood products donations\nfrom anyone who has been in a malarial area for 3 years.

I am not sure if this is the proper group to post this to but here goes anyway.\n\n About five years ago my mother was diagnosed with having cancer in the lymph nodes\n under one of her arms. After the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement\n of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it. Over the course of\n the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced\n the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain. At this time her doctor \n suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue.\n\n While attending one of her therapy sessions, while her arm was being \n manipulated, some damage occured (nerve?) which caused the level of pain to permanently\n increase severly (controlled by Tylenol 3s) and some loss of use of the arm (\n palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement). With great persistence on her part\n the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had\n been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm. This was removed also but the\n pain in the arm has not decreased. The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is \n persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol 3\n and soon Morphine to relieve the pain. She has tried acupuncture by this only provides\n minor reductions in pain and is only short term.  \n\n My questions are: \n\n     Has anyone has heard of similar cases and what, if anything, was done to reduce the\n     levels of pain?\n\n     Are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced?\n\n     Are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored?\n\n\n  Any general suggestions on pain reduction would be greatly appreciated.\n  \n  \n  Please respond by email because I do not always get chance to read this group.\n\n  If anyone knows of some literature that may be useful to this case or another newsgroup\n  that I should be posting this to it would also be appreciated.
For a brief, but pretty detailed account, try Hempel's _Philosophy of\nNatural Science_.\n\n\nThis smacks a bit of ideology -- the supposition being that Toricelli's\nsubsequent descriptions of his reasoning are not veridical.  It gets dangerously\nclose to an unfalsifiable view of the history and methodology of science if\nwe deny that no subsequent reports of experimenters are reliable descriptions\nof their "real" reasons.\n\n\nBut my point is that this type of case is *not* a rarity.  In fact, I was\ngoing to point to Pasteur as yet another rather common example -- particularly\nthe studies on spontaneous generation and fermentation.  I will readily\nconcede that "ridiculous reasons" can play an important role in how\nscientists spend their time.  But one should not confuse motivation with\nmethodology nor suppose that ridiculous reasons provide the impetus in the\nmajority of cases based on relatively infrequent anecdotal evidence.
We will be holding a bake and craft sale at Communiversity in Princeton on  \nNassau Street, Saturday April 24th 12-4 p.m. to benefit the Recurrent  \nRespiratory Papillomatosis Foundation, a nonprofit foundation established to  \nencourage research toward a cure for Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.  Our  \nthree year old daughter suffers from this disease.  Below is a press release  \nthat appeared in local newspapers.  Hope you can join us.\n\n\nOn Saturday, April 24 as part of Communiversity in Princeton, a local family  \nwill be having a bake and craft sale to raise money for and create public  \nawareness about a rare disease called Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.\n\nBill and Marlene Stern's daughter Lindsay is afflicted with this disease  \ncharacterized by tumors attacking the inside of the larynx, vocal cords and  \ntrachea.  Caused by a virus, the tumors grow, block the air passages and would  \nlead to death from suffocation without continual surgery to remove the growths.   \nThree year old Lindsay has undergone 11 operations thus far since her diagnosis  \nlast year and faces the prospect of over a hundred operations throughout her  \nlifetime.  \n\nEven though the disease is hardly a household word, it has affected the lives  \nof enough people to inspire the formation of the Recurrent Respiratory  \nPapillomatosis Foundation,  a non-profit foundation whose goals are to provide  \nsupport for patients and families by networking patients and publishing a  \nnewsletter, enhance  awareness of RRP at the local and national level, and aid  \nin the prevention, cure, and treatment.\n\nSince medical researchers know that the virus causing the disease is similar to  \nthose viruses causing warts, they feel a cure would be within reach if money  \nwere available for research.  Because RRP is rare, it not only gets scant  \nattention but also paltry funds to search for a cure.  Part of the RRP  \nFoundation's mission is to change that. \n\nAnyone interested in contributing items to the bake and craft sale, please call  \nMarlene or Bill at 609-890-0502.  Monetary donations can be made at the  \nFoundation's booth during Communiversity, April 24th, 12 to 4 p.m., in downtown  \nPrinceton, or sent directly to:

While in grad school, I remember a biochemistry friend of mine working with\n"heat shock proteins". Apparently, burning protein will induce changes in he\nDNA. Whether these changes survive the denaturing that occurs during digestion\nI don't know, but I never eat burnt food because of this. \n\nAlso, many woods contain toxins. As they are burnt, it would seem logical that\nsome may volatilise, and get into the BBQed food. Again, I don't know if these\ntoxins (antifungal and anti-woodeater compounds) would survive the rather harsh\nconditions of the stomach and intestine, and then would they be able to cross\nthe intestinal mucosa?\n\nMaybe someone with more biochemical background than myself (which is almost\n*anyone*... :)) can shed some light on heat shock proteins and the toxins that\nmay be in the wood used to make charcoal and BBQ.
Melissa, there is a simpler procedure called a "Dorsal slit" that is\nreally the first step of the usual circumcision.  It is simpler and\nquicker, but the pain is about the same as circumcision after the\nanesthetic wears off and the aesthetic result post healing is not as\ngood.  See your friendly urologist for more details.\n                                                Len Howard\n.
I don't know much and in fact, have asked questions here\nmyself. My doctor told me that Paxil is a "cleaner" SRI in that\nit produces fewer side effects. As to a comparison between\nZoloft and Prozac, I'm not able to remember what he said about\nthe differences between those two drugs. Sorry
Obviously, it wouldn't be of much help to treat one problem by knowingly \nintroducing another.  Cancer mestastizes.  My imperfect understanding of \nthe facts are that gonadal cancer is particularly dangerous in this regard. \nI haven't done the research on it, but I don't recall ever hearing of a \ncase of cancer being transmitted by a blood transfusion.  Probably just a \ncommon sense kind of arbitrary precaution.  Transmissable diseases like \nmalaria though are obviously another story.

It depends on the cause of the pneumonia.  For treating bacterial\npneumonia in young otherwise-healthy non-smokers, erythromycin\nis usually considered the antibiotic of choice, since it covers\nthe two most-common pathogens: strep pneumoniae and mycoplasma\npneumoniae.
I had this one time.  I attributed it to a lack of sleep since it disappeared\nafter a few nights of good zzz's.

My wife breast-fed my three boys 12 months, 16 months, and 29 months\nrespectively and they are 18, 16, and 10 years old respectively.  So\nfar everybody seems fairly normal.  I noticed a negative correlation\nwith ear infections and length of time nursed in my very small sample.\nI do notice that the 16 and 18 year old seem to eat a lot, could that\nbe from the breast feeding :-)  ?\n\nI don't understand the "unfit mother" charge other than any tactic is\nnot too low down for some folks during divorce/child custody battles.\n\nMost of the developing nations practice breast feeding to 3 and 4 years\nold.  Are they screwed up because of it ?  Would they be much better\noff if they could use cow's milk or commercial formula ?  Doctors ?
My 14-y-o son has the usual teenage spotty chin and greasy nose.  I\nbought him Clearasil face wash and ointment.  I think that is probably\nenough, along with the usual good diet.  However, he is on at me to\nget some product called Dalacin T, which used to be a\ndoctor's-prescription only treatment but is not available over the\nchemist's counter.  I have asked a couple of pharmacists who say\neither his acne is not severe enough for Dalacin T, or that Clearasil\nis OK.  I had the odd spots as a teenager, nothing serious.  His\nfather was the same, so I don't figure his acne is going to escalate\ninto something disfiguring.  But I know kids are senstitive about\ntheir appearance.  I am wary because a neighbour's son had this wierd\nmalady that was eventually put down to an overdose of vitamin A from\nacne treatment.  I want to help - but with appropriate treatment.\n\nMy son also has some scaliness around the hairline on his scalp.  Sort\nof teenage cradle cap.  Any pointers/advice on this?  We have tried a\ncouple of anti dandruff shampoos and some of these are inclined to\nmake the condition worse, not better.\n\nShall I bury the kid till he's 21 :)
Be sure a dietician is up to date on Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis.  \nPreviously, low residue diets were recommended, but this advice has\nnow changed.  Also, there will be differences in advice in patients with\nand without obstructuon remaining, so input by the physician will be \nimportant.  I find the dietician very important in my practice, and \nI send most of my patients to a dietician in the course of seeing\nthem, since dieticians know so much better how to get diet histories\nand evaluate the contents of a diet than I do.
Hi,\n\nwe are just completing a project on nebuliser performance, and have a\nwealth of data on particle size and output which we are going to use\nto adjudicate a contract next week.\n\nAlthough the output data is easy for us to present, there seems to be\nlittle concensus on the optimum diameter of the nebulised droplets for\nstraightforward inhalation therapy (eg: for asthmatics).\n\nSome say that the droplets must be smaller than 5 microns, whilst\nothers say that if they are too small they will not be effective.\n\nAnyone up on this topic who could summarise the current status ?\n\nCheers,\nPete\n-- \nPete Phillips, Deputy Director, Surgical Materials Testing Lab, \nBridgend General Hospital, S.

Ask the practitioner whether he uses the pre-sterilized disposable\nneedles, or if he reuses needles, sterilizing them between use.  In the\nformer case there's no conceivable way to get AIDS from the needles.  In\nthe latter case it's highly unlikely (though many practitioners use the\ndisposable variety anyway).\n\neuclid
Absolutely.  Unfortunately, most of them have had 3 weeks of neurology\nin medical school and 1 month (maybe) in their residency.  Most\nof that is done in the hospital where migraines rarely are seen.\nWhere are they supposed to learn?  Those who are diligent and\nread do learn, but most don't, unfortunately.\n\n\nWe are the only ones, sometimes, who have enough interest in headaches\nto spend the time to get enough history to diagnose them.  Too often,\nthe primary care physician hears "headache" and loses interest in\nanything but giving the patient analgesics and getting them out of\nthe office so they can get on to something more interesting.\n\n\n\nI hope you meant "inarguably".\n\n-- \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGordon Banks  N3JXP      | "Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and\ngeb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon."
I remember hearing a few years back about a new therapy for hyperactivity\nwhich involved aggressively eliminating artificial coloring and flavoring\nfrom the diet.  The theory -- which was backed up by interesting anecdotal\nresults -- is that certain people are just way more sensitive to these\nchemicals than other people.  I don't remember any connection being made\nwith seizures, but it certainly couldn't hurt to try an all-natural diet.

In comparison, in \nthe United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall \ndecreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in \ngonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of \nthis disease from 1985 through 1992. \n     In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department \nof Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992, \nreported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively \n(Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics \n(15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases \nwith race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7% \nof all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases by \nage groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or \nequal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all \nreported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the \nlargest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age \ngroup-specific rate (639 per 100,000). \n     Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver \nmetropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the \nstate (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area \noccurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods \nconsidered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiency \nsyndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity. \n     When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among \nmen in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic in \nthe Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits \nby males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of cases \ndiagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men, \nthe number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised \n94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among \nself-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992, \nrespectively). \n     Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO, \nuniversity hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted \nto determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrhea \nculture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased \n23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the \nfourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning). \n     From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and \nHispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nincreased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado \nincreased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992, \nthe gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for \nwhites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000) \n(Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from \n1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases \nincreased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups. \n\nReported by: KA Gershman, MD, JM Finn, NE Spencer, MSPH, STD/AIDS Program; RE \nHoffman, MD, State Epidemiologist, Colorado Dept of Health. JM Douglas, MD, \nDenver Dept of Health and Hospitals. Surveillance and Information Systems Br, \nDiv of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and HIV Prevention, National Center for \nPrevention Svcs, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in 1992 \nmay represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more \ncomplete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDH \nsurveillance staff during 1991-1992. The increases in confirmed gonorrhea \ncases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories \nsuggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact. \nHowever, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning \nlaboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the \ngonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population. \n     One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in \nColorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a \nrecent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs \n(2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area \ncoincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires \nfurther assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated \npreviously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6) \n-- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom \ngonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs, \nand gang affiliation. \n     The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the \nnational health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective \n19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for \ngonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at \ngreatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover, race-\nspecific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as \nsocioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors. \n     In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado, \ninterventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1) targeting \npartner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at \nincreased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black \nmales); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nannouncements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in \nschools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted \nprimarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to \nperform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educational \ninterventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of \nmembers of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders \nand health-care providers. \n\nReferences\n\n1.

Child safety seats and safety \nbelts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985, all 50 \nstates passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety \nbelts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by \nan estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major \ncause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use of \noccupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for \nthose aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). In \naddition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to \nuse restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association between \nadult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints \nfor the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDC \nanalyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System \n(BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from this \nstudy. \n     Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to \n18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based, \nrandom-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury \nControl and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents, 5499 \n(26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondent \nwas asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for \nthat child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in \nthis analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than \nconsistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up). \nData were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Software \nfor Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates \nand confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were defined \nby p values of less than 0.05. \n     Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these, six \n(Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had no \nlaw requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania, \nand Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a \nvehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse \nof safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary \nenforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a \nsafety-belt law violation alone). In nine states, child-passenger protection \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 17\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nlaws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states \nused both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use. \nThe analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law \nrequiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law \n(no-law states). \n     Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not \nconsistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use and \nadult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square \ntest) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus \n43.2%, respectively). \n     High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1 \nyear were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than \nconsistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reported \nhigh rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age \n(range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). In comparison, for \nadults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child-\noccupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1% \nfor 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children of \nconsistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult \nsafety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age \ngroups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year). \n     Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded \nthat in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition, \nhigher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with \nincreased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated \nwith increased adult safety-belt use (8). \n\nReported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; National \nCenter for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with others \nindicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely \nto employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). Because these \nnonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit \nother risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater \nrisk for motor-vehicle injury (10). \n     Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with \nchild restraint use in this report. Accordingly, occupant-protection programs \nshould be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because low \neducational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such \nprograms should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve \nlow-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that are \ndirected at parents with young children. \n     Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. In \naddition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nthey become older. Parents, especially those with low educational attainment, \nthose who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that do \nnot have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety \nbelts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and \nsafety belts. Finally, the increased use of restraints among children may \nincrease their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers -- \nthe age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the \nhighest rate of fatal crashes (5). \n\nReferences\n\n1.

All \nsubscribers to MMWR receive the CDC Surveillance Summaries, as well as the \nMMWR Recommendations and Reports, as part of their subscriptions.\n\n SURVEILLANCE FOR AND COMPARISON OF BIRTH DEFECT PREVALENCES\n                               IN TWO GEOGRAPHIC \n                        AREAS -- UNITED STATES, 1983-88 \n\n     Problem/Condition: CDC and some states have developed surveillance \nsystems to monitor the birth prevalence of major defects. \n     Reporting Period Covered: This report covers birth defects surveillance \nin metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, and selected jurisdictions in California for \nthe years 1983-1988. \n     Description of System: The California Birth Defects Monitoring Program \nand the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program are two population-\nbased surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods. The \nprevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983-\n1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan \nAtlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race, \nsex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression. \n     Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal \nalcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the \nkidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general \ndiagnostic variability. However, differences in the prevalences of arm/hand \nlimb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are \nprobably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these \ndefects are relatively easy to diagnose. \n     Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy \ntermination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However, \nthe reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may be \nrelated to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene \npool, or random variation. \n     Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, several \ncollaborative studies are being implemented. In particular, the differences in \nthe birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on \nthe impact of prenatal diagnosis.

Throughout the season increases in the indices \nof influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were \nsimilar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% of \nidentified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtype \nincreased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the \n1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were \nreported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza \nA(H1N1). \n     Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of \ninfluenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the \nimportance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since \namantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A. \n     Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced \nthroughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make \ninformed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. CDC's annual \nsurveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates \nfor inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons. \nAuthors: Louisa E.

Together, \nthese technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive \ntechnology (ART) procedures. \n\nOvulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or \npathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility \nmanagement. However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to \nproceed with one of the ART procedures. \n\nTherefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility \nservice at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and \nInfertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in \nART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients \nin the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the \ntraditional therapies. \n\nThe following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our \nCenter, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the \nrealistic expectations for their success. Procedures included are: \n\no in vitro \no fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube \n  transfer \no (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation. \nThis article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed \ntowards improved success of these technologies. \n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 24\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n                           Future Areas of Research\n\nIn addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward the \nmanagement of infertile couples, we are developing the technology to assist \ncouples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditary \ndisease. \n\nThis technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then \nsubjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA \namplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization. \n\nThere are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by \nother centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and \nhemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ \nhybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification of \nwhich will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit \nsex-linked disorders. \n\nThe considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that \nit circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility \nof a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth \nof affected children. \n\n\nCatherine Racowsky, Ph.D.\nAssociate Professor and Director of Research\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology\nCollege of Medicine \nUniversity of Arizona\nTucson, Arizona\n\n               Applications, Success Rates and Advances for the\n                           Management of Infertility\n\nThe following are the ART procedures available at The University of Arizona \nCenter for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility. \n\n     In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our \nAssisted Reproduction Program.  This procedure involves retrieval of \nunfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and \nthe culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred \nto the patient's uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator under \nstrictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before being \nprocessed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our \nandrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer-\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 25\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nassisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to \nperform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typically \nstimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing \nhormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and/or GnRH analogues (lupron, Depo \nlupron, synarel). Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs \nobtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopic \negg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia, \nwe undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our \nInfertility Unit, with the patient sedated.  \n     Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal \ndeficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of male \nfactor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overall \nsuccess rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per \ncycle. Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173 \nIVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate. \n     Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is \ndisconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological \nfactors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Well \nrecognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous \novarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle \nattempts. However, among these, age is the single most significant determinant \nof conception. Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an \nAssisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of \ntraditional therapies. \n     The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not \nbeen clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs \navailable for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates \nsignificantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years; \nand 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is \nunrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our \nCenter, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may \nbe impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that \nfail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant \nproportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently, \nthe only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Our \nprogram has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs \nof a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy. \n\n     GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room, \nusually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involves \nintroducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian \ntube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilization \noccurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF, \nwith subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for \ntransfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases in \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nwhich there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such \npathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility \nand/or idiopathic infertility.    \n     The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990 \nindicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained \nwith the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36 \npercent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact, one might \nexpect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in our \nprogram we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while \nsubstantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the \npatient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing \na procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing \ngeneral anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from \nobtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs, \nand the developmental competency of resultant embryos. \n     The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial \nenvironment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. Between \nJanuary 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT \ncycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent. \n     Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when \nembryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos. \nThis procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for \nsuccess at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical \nissues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulated \nby the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from \nboth a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs \nshould have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys. \n     Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new, \nis applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but \nwho have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml in \ncombination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10 \npercent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing the \nprocedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm under \nthe coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm \nthrough enzymatic digestion. \n     Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10 \npercent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedly \nrelates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm. \nTherefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques \nfor the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. Such \nefforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology \noffers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to \nestablish conception. \n\nCatherine Racowsky, Ph.D.\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 27\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nAssociate Professor and Director of Research\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology\nCollege of Medicine \n--------- end of part 2 ------------
Here is another anecdotal story.  I am a picky eater and never wanted to \ntry chinese food, however, I finally tried some in order to please a\ngirl I was seeing at the time.  I had never heard of Chinese restaurant\nsyndrome.  A group of us went to the restaurant and all shared 6 different\ndishes.  It didn't taste great, but I decided it wasn't so bad.  We went\nhome and went to bed early.  I woke up at 2 AM and puked my guts outs.\nI threw up for so long that (I'm not kidding) I pulled a muscle in\nmy tongue.  Dry heaves and everything.  No one else got sick, and I'm\nnot allergic to anything that I know of.  \n\nSuffice to say that I wont go into a chinese restaurant unless I am \nphysically threatened.  The smell of the food makes me ill (and that *is*\na psycholgical reaction).  When I have been dragged in to suffer\nthrough beef and broccoli without any sauces, I insist on no MSG.  \nI haven't gotten sick yet.
Aspartame is the methyl ester of a dipeptide, so a product of its\nhydrolysis is going to be methanol, which can then be oxidized to\nformaldehyde.  The amounts of methanol formed from the ingestion of\naspartame-containing foods are completely in the metabolic noise,\nsince you're forming equally minute amounts of methanol from other\ncomponents of food all the time.  In studies involving administration\nof high doses of the additive, blood methanol levels were undetectable.\nMethanol is a poison only in quantities seen in human poisonings,\nsay 5ml and above.  This is a consequence of its oxidation to formaldehyde\nand formic acid, two quite reactive compounds which at high enough levels\ncan damage tissues like the retina and kidney, because at such high doses\nthe body's detoxification system is overwhelmed.  Interestingly, one\ntreatment for early methanol poisoning is to get the person drunk on\nethyl alcohol--vodka or an equivalent.  That's because ethanol is\nmetabolized preferentially over methanol by the enzymes in the liver.\nIf the methanol stays as methanol and isn't metabolized to formaldehyde,\nit is actually relatively non-toxic.
A very simple question : it seems to me that the contraceptive\npill just prevents the ovule to nest in the vagina and forces it to\nfall every month. But it does not prevent the fertilzation of the \novule. Is it true ? If yes, is there a risk of extra-uterine\npregnancy, that is the development of the ovule inside the Fallopian\ntube ?
If you can get it, you might want to try a Canadian over-the-counter product\ncalled Secaris, which is a water-soluble gel.  Compared to Vaseline or other\ngreasy ointments, Secaris seems more compatible with the moisture that's\nalready there.

Yes, but typically they *don't*.  Not every wild flight of fancy serves\n(or can serve) in the appropriate relation to a hypothesis.  It is\nsomewhat interesting that when anyone is challanged to provide an\nexample of this sort the *only* one they come up with is the one about\nKekule.  Surely, there must be others.  But apparently this is regarded\nas an *extreme* example of a "non-rational" process in science whereby\na successful hypothesis was proposed.  But how non-rational is it?\n\nOf course we can't hope (currently at least) to explain how or why\nKekule had the daydream of snakes in the fire biting their tails.\nSurely it wasn't the *only* daydream he had.  What was special about\n*this* one?  Could it have had something to do with a perceived\n*analogy* between the geometry of the snakes and problems concerning\ngeometry of molecules?  Is such analogical reasoning "extra-scientific"?\nOr is it rather at the very heart of science (Perice's notion of abduction,\nthe use of models within and across disciplines)?  Upon close examination,\nis there a non-rational mystical leap taking place, or is it perhaps\ncloser to a formal (though often incomplete) analogy or model?
GB> From: geb@cs.pitt.edu (Gordon Banks)\nGB> The HMO would stop the over-ordering, but in HMOs, tests are\nGB> under-ordered.\n\nThat's a somewhat overbroad statement.  I'm sure there are HMOs in\nwhich the fees for lab tests are subtracted from the doctor's\nincome.  In most, however, including the one I work for, there is no\ndirect incentive to under-order.  Profits of the group are shared\namong all partners, but the group is so large that an individual's\ngenerated costs have a miniscule effect.  I don't believe that we\nunder-order.  Then again, I'm not really sure what the right amount\nof ordering is or should be.  Relative to the average British\nneurologist, I suspect that I rather drastically over-order.

You'd have to purify the river water first.  I'm not sure how practical\nthat is with the Mississippi.  You'd better check with health agencies\nalong the way to see if there are toxic chemicals in the river.  If\nit is just microorganisms, those can be filtered or killed, but you\nmay need activated charcoal or other means to purify from chemicals.\nBetter be same than sorry.

I know that the placebo effect is where a patient feels better or \neven gets better because of his/her belief in the medicine and \nthe doctor administering it.  Is there also an anti-placebo \neffect where the patient dislikes/distrusts doctors and medicine \nand therefore doesn't get better or feel better in spite of the \nmedicine?\n\nIs there an effect where the doctor believes so strongly in a \nmedicine that he/she sees improvement where the is none or sees \nmore improvement than there is?  If so, what is this effect \ncalled?  Is there a reverse of the above effect where the doctor \ndoesn't believe in a medicine and then sees less improvement than \nthere is?  What would this effect be called?  Have these effects \never been studied?  How common are these effects?  Thank you in \nadvance for all replies.

My girlfriend is in pain from kidney stones.

You are making precisely one of the points I wanted to make.\nI fully agree with you that there is a big distinction between the\n*process* of science and the end result.  \n\nAs an end result of science, one wants to get results that are\nobjectively verifiable.  But there is nothing objective about the\n*process* of science.  \n\nIf good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit\nto homeopathic remedies, this would certainly be valuable information.\nBut it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science.  This\nis where you and I disagree with Turpin.  In order to have science, one\nmust have a theoretical structure that makes sense, not a mere\ncollection of empirically validated random hypotheses.\n\nExperiment and empirical studies are an important part of science, but\nthey are merely the culmination of scientific research.  The most\nimportant part of true scientific methodology is SCIENTIFIC THINKING.  \nWithout this, one does not have any hypotheses worth testing.  (No,\nhypotheses do not just leap out at you after you look at enough data.\nNor do they simply come to you in a flash one day while you're shaving or\nlooking out the window.  At least not unless you've done a lot of really\ngood thinking beforehand.)  \n\nThe difference between a Nobel Prize level scientist and a mediocre\nscientist does not lie in the quality of their empirical methodology.  \nIt depends on the quality of their THINKING.  \n\nIt really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe that\nthey are doing science merely because they are conducting empirical\nstudies.  And it bothers me even more that there are many fields, such as\ncertain parts of psychology, where there seems to be no thinking at all, \nbut mere studies testing ad hoc hypotheses.  \n\nAnd I'm especially offended by Russell Turpin's repeated assertion that\nscience amounts to nothing more than avoiding mistakes.  Simply avoiding\nmistakes doesn't get you anywhere.  \n\n--\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.
Subject: Re: Eugenics\n/\n;Probably within 50 years, a new type of eugenics will be possible. \n;Maybe even sooner.  We are now mapping the human genome.  We will \n;then start to work on manipulation of that genome.  Using genetic\n;engineering, we will be able to insert whatever genes we want.\n;No breeding, no "hybrids", etc.  The ethical question is, should\n;we?\n \nTwo past problems with eugenics have been \n1) reducing the gene pool and \n2) defining the status of the eugenized.\n \nInserting genes would not seem to reduce the gene pool unless the inserted\ngenes later became transmissible to progeny. Then they may be able to\ncrowd out "garbage genes." This may in the future become possible. Even if\nit does, awareness of the need to maintain the gene pool would hopefully\nmean provisions will be made for saving genes that may come in handy\nlater. Evidently the genes for sickle cell disease in equatorial Africa\nand for diabetes in the Hopi *promoted* survival in some conditions. We\ndon't really know what the future may hold for our environment. The\nreduced wilderness- and disease-survival capacity of our relatively inbred\ndomesticated animals comes to mind. Vulcanism, nuclear winter, ice age,\nmeteor impact, new microbiological threats, famine, global warming, etc.,\netc., are all conceivable. Therefore, having as many genes as possible\navailable is a good strategy for species survival. \n \nOf course, the status of genetically altered individuals would start out\nas no different than anyone else's. But if we could make\n"philosopher-kings" with great bodies and long lives, would we (or they)\nwant to give them elevated status? We could. The Romans did it with their\nkings *without* the benefits of such eugenics. The race eventually\nrealized and dealt with the problems which that caused, but for a while,\nit was a problem. Orwell introduced us to the notion of what might happen\nto persons genetically altered for more menial tasks. But there is nothing\nnew under the sun. We treated slaves the same way for millennia before\n"1984."   \n \nI see no inherent problem with gene therapy which avoids at least these 2\nproblems. Humans have always had trouble having the virtue and wisdom to\nuse any power that falls into their hands to good ends all the time. That\nhasn't stopped the race as a whole yet. Many are the civilizations which\nhave died from inability to adapt to environmental change. However, also\nmany are the civilizations which have died from the abuse of their own\npower. The ones which survived have hopefully learned a lesson from the\nfates of others, and have survived by making better choices when their\nturns came.\n \nNot that I don't think that this gene altering power couldn't wipe us off\nthe face of the earth or cause endless suffering. Nuclear power or global\nwarming or whatever could and may still do that, too. \n \nThe real issue is an issue of wisdom and virtue. I personally don't think\nman has enough wisdom and virtue to pull this next challenge off any\nbetter than he did the for last few. We, as eugenists, may make it, an we\nmay not. If we don't, I hope there are reservoirs of "garbage" people out\nin some backwater with otherwise long discarded "garbage" genes which will\npull us through. \n \nI believe that the real problem is and will probably always be the same.\nMan needs to accept input from the great spirit of God to overcome his\nlacks in the area of knowing how to use the power he has. Some men have,\nand I believe all men may, listen to and obey the still small voice of God\nin their hearts. This is the way to begin to recieve the wisdom and virtue\nneeded to escape the problems consequent to poor choices. Peoples have\ndied out for many reasons. The societies which failed to accept enough\ninput from God to safely use the power they had developed have destroyed\nthemselves, and often others in the process. It is self-evident that the\nones which survive today have either accepted enough input from the Spirit\nto use their powers wisely enough to avoid or survive their own mistakes\nthus far, or else haven't had enough power for long enough. \n \nIn summary, I would say that the question of whether to use this new\ntechnology is really an ancient one. And the answer, in some ways hard, in\nsome ways easy, is the same ancient answer. It isn't the power, it is the\nSpirit.\n \nSorry for the long post. Got carried away.
I just found out about the sublinguals disappearing too.  I don't\nknow why.

I love the FAQ.       \n\nThe comment about contact lenses not being an option for any remaining\ncorrection after RK and possibly after PRK is interresting.  Why is\nthis?  Does anyone know for sure whether this applies to PRK as well?\n\nAlso, why is it possible to get a correction in PRK with involvement of\nonly about 5% of the corneal depth, while RK is done to a depth of up to\n95%?  Why such a difference?  I thought the proceedures were simmilar\nwith the exception of a laser being the cutting tool in PRK.  I must not\nbe understanding all of the differences.\n\nIn the FAQ, the vision was considered less clear after the surgery than\nwith glasses alone.  If this is completly attributable to the\nintentional slight undercorrection, then it can be compensated for when\nnecessary with glasses (or contacts, if they CAN be worn afterall!).  It\nis important to know if that is not the case, however, and some other\nconsequence of the surgery would often interfere with clear vision.  The\nfirst thing that came to my mind was a fogging of the lense, which\nglasses couldn't help. \n\nwould not help.

No, the neiseria meningococcus is one of the most common\nforms of meningitis.  It's the one that sometimes sweeps\nschools or boot camp.  It is contagious and kills by attacking\nthe covering of the brain, causing the blood vessels to thrombose\nand the brain to swell up.\n\nIt is very treatable if caught in time.  There isn't much time,\nhowever.  The rash is the tip off.  Infants are very susceptible\nto dying from bacterial meningitis.  Any infant with a fever who\nbecomes stiff or lethargic needs to be rushed to a hospital where\na spinal tap will show if they have meningitis.

Your doctor is right. It is best to do nothing, besides taking some pain\nmedication initially. Some patients don't like this and expect, or demand,\nto have something done. In these cases some physicians will "tape" the \npatient (put a lot of heavy adhesive tape around the chest), or prescribe\nan elastic binder. All this does is make it harder to breath, but the\npatient doesn't feel cheated, because soemthing is being done about the\nproblem. Either way, the end results are the same.\n\n==================================
First, I am not a doctor.  I know about this because I have been\nthrough it.\n\nIt sounds like tonsilitis (lit. swollen tonsils).  Feel under your jaw\nhinge for a swelling on each side.  If you find them, its tonsilitis.\nI've had this a couple of times in the past.  The doctor prescribed a\nweeks course of penicillin and that cleared it up.\n\nIn my case it was associated with glandular fever, which is a viral\ninfection which (from my point of view) resembled flu and tonsilitis\nthat kept coming back for a year or so.  There is a blood test for\nthis.\n\nIn conclusion, see a doctor (if you have not done so already).\n\nPaul.

Here is a press release from the Natural Resources Defense Council.\n\n New Data Show About 100 Major U.S. Water Supplies Vulnerable To\nMilwaukee-Type Disease Outbreak\n To: National Desk, Environment Writer\n Contact: Erik Olson or Sarah Silver, 202-783-7800, both\n          of the Natural Resources Defense Council\n\n   WASHINGTON, April 14  -- Internal EPA data released\ntoday by the Natural Resources Defense Council reveals that about\n100 large water systems -- serving cities from Boston to San\nFrancisco -- do not filter to remove disease-carrying organisms\nleaving those communities potentially vulnerable to a disease\noutbreak similar to the one affecting Milwaukee.\n   The EPA list is attached.\n   "These internal EPA documents reveal that the safety of water\nsupplies in many American cities is threatened by inadequate\npollution controls or filtration," said Erik Olson, a senior\nattorney with NRDC.  "Water contamination isn't just a problem in\nBangladesh, it's also a problem in Bozeman and Boston."\n   "As of June 29, 1993, about 100 large surface water systems on\nEPA's list probably will be breaking the law.  The 1986 Safe\nDrinking Water Act requires all surface water systems to either\nfilter their water or fully protect the rivers or lakes they use\nfrom pollution," Olson continued.  Some systems are moving\ntowards eventually implementing filtration systems but are\nexpected to miss the law's deadline.\n   Olson pointed out that the threat of contamination is already\na reality in other cities.  A 1991 survey of 66 U.S. surface\nwater systems by water utility scientists found that 87 percent\nof raw water samples contained the Milwaukee organism\ncryptosporidium, and 81 percent contained a similar parasite\ncalled giardia.\n   Adding to the level of concern, a General Accounting Office\nstudy released today by House Health and Environment Subcommittee\nChairman Henry Waxman indicates serious deficiencies in the\nnation's system for conducting and following through on sanitary\nsurveys of water systems.\n   "This new information raises a huge warning sign that millions\nof Americans can no longer simply turn on their taps and be\nassured that their water is safe to drink.

Thanks to Tarl Neustaedter of MA for kindly letting me know that my\nreference in prior post to Orwell and "1984" should probably have been to\nHuxley and "Brave New World." \n\nSorry, Al.
But it is quite a leap in logic to observe one situation where anecdotal\nevidence led nowhere and therefore conclude that anecdotal evidence will\nNEVER lead anywhere.  I'm sure somebody here can provide an example where\nanecdotal evidence (and the interpretation of it) was upheld/verified by\nfollow-on rigorous clinical trials.\n\n\n\nGood point.  There has been a tendency by some on this newsgroup to "circle\nthe wagons" to the viewpoint that anecdotal medical evidence is worthless\n(maybe to counter the claims of those who are presenting anecdotal evidence\nto support controversial subjects, such as the "yeast hypothesis").  But\nevidence is evidence - it requires a "jury" or a process to sort it out and\ndetermine the truth from the junk.  Medicine must continue to strive to better\nunderstand the workings of the body/mind for the purpose of alleviating\nillness - anecdotal evidence is just one piece of the puzzle;  it is not\nworthless.  Rather, it can help focus limited resources in the right direction.\n\nJon Noring\n\n-- \n\nCharter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.
Heat shock proteins are those whose expression is induced in response to\nelevated temperature.  Some are also made when organisms are subjected to\nother stress conditions, e.g. high salt.  They have no obvious connection\nto what happens when you burn proteins.
There is a mini-epidemic of Coccidiodes that is occurring in,\nI believe, the Owen's Valley/ Bishop area east of the Sierras.\nI don't believe there has been any great insight into the\nincreased incidence in that area. There is a low-level\nof endemic infection in that region. Many people with\nevidence of past exposure to the organism did not have\nserious disease.
-*-----\n\n\nI hope Gordon Banks did not mean to imply that notions such as\nhard-to-see candida infections causing various problems should not\nbe investigated.  Many researchers have made breakthroughs by \nfiguring out how to investigate things that were previously thought\n"virtually impossible to test for."\n\nIndeed, I would be surprised if "candida overbloom" were such a\nphenomena.  I would think that candida would produce signature\nbyproducts whose measure would then set a lower bound on the \nextent of recent infection.  I realize this might get quite \ntricky and difficult, probably expensive, and likely inconvenient\nor uncomfortable to the subjects, but that is not the same as \n"virtually impossible."
The best group to keep you informed is the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation\nof America.  I do not know if the UK has a similar organization.  The\naddress of\nthe CCFA is \n\nCCFA\n444 Park Avenue South\n11th Floor\nNew York, NY  10016-7374\nUSA\n\nThey have a lot of information available and have a number of newsletters.\n \nGood Luck.
In fact Adiposity 101 mentions a similar study (search for "life\nevents" in any recent version of Adiposity 101).\n\nThe problem with anecdotal reports about individuals who have\nlost weight and kept it off is that we don't know what caused\nthe weight gain in the first place.  This is critical because\nsomeone who gains weight because of something temporary (drug\neffect, life event, etc.) may appear successful at dieting when\nthe weight loss was really the result of reversing the temporary\ncondition that caused the weight gain.
MSG is mono sodium glutamate, a fairly straight forward compound. If it is\npure, the source should not be a problem. Your comment suggests that \nimpurities may be the cause.\nMy experience of MSG effects (as part of a double blind study) was that the\npure stuff caused me some rather severe effects.\n\n\nSoya bean, fermented cheeses, mushrooms all contain MSG.
Seems to me that I read in either a recent NY Times\nScience Times or maybe it was Science News that there is\nevidence that ex-smoker's risk of lung cancer never returns\nto that of a person who has never smoked (I think it may\nget close).  I'll find the article and post it since my\nmemory is hazy on the specifics - if you are interested.
Nutrasweet is a synthetic sweetener a couple thousand times sweeter than\nsugar.  Some people are concerned about the chemicals that the  body produces \nwhen it degrades nutrasweet.  It is thought to form formaldehyde and known to\nfor methanol in the degredation pathway that the body uses to eliminate \nsubstances.  The real issue is whether the levels of methanol and formaldehyde\nproduced are high enough to cause significant damage, as both are toxic to\nliving cells.  All I can say is that I will not consume it.  \n\nPhenylalanine is\nnothing for you to worry about.  It is an amino acid, and everyone uses small\nquantities of it for protein synthesis in the body.  Some people have a disease\nknown as phenylketoneurea, and they are missing the enzyme necessary to \ndegrade this compound and eliminate it from the body.  For them, it will \naccumulate in the body, and in high levels this is toxic to growing nerve\ncells.  Therefore, it is Only a major problem in young children (until around\nage 10 or so) or women who are pregnant and have this disorder.  It used to\nbe a leading cause of brain damage in infants, but now it can be easily \ndetected at birth, and then one must simply avoid comsumption of phenylalanine\nas a child, or when pregnant.
I've gotten migraines after exercise, though for me it seems to be related\nto exercising without having eaten recently.

There's a pretty good article in the the March 6, 1993 New Scientist titled\n"Pouring cold water on Lorenzo's oil".  The article states that research\nhas shown that the oil has no discernable effect on the progression of the\ndisease in patients in which demyelination has begun.  In patients with\nAMN (a less acute form of the same disease) there is some improvement\nseen in the ability of nerve fibres to conduct impulses.  In ALD patients\nwho have not yet begun demyelination, the jury is still out.
I don't know if anyone knows about this topic: electrical heart \nfailure. One of my friends has had to go to the doctor because\nhe had chest pains. The Doc said it was Arythmia. So he had to\ngo to a new york hospital for a lot of money to get treated. His\ndoctors said that he could die from it, and the medication caused\ncancer ( that he was taking). Well, I suggested that he run, excersize\nand eat more, ( he is very skinny) but he says that has nothing\nto do with it. Does anyone know what causes arythmia and how \nit can be treated?\n			Thanks

I suspect from your\napparent anger toward MDs and heteropathic medicine that there may be an\nunderlying 'father problem'...of course I can CONFIRM this by surrogate muscle\ntesting one of my patients while they ponder my theory to see if one of their  \npreviously weak 'indicator' muscles strengthens...or do you have reservations\nabout my unique methods of diagnosis?

I have a BACK MACHINE and have had one since January.  While I have not \nfound it to be a panacea for my back pain, I think it has helped somewhat. \nIt MAINLY acts to stretch muscles in the back and prevent spasms associated\nwith pain.  I am taking less pain medication than I was previously.  \n   The folks at BACK TECHNOLOGIES are VERY reluctant to honor their return \npolicy.  They extended my "warranty" period rather than allow me to return \nthe machine when, after the first month or so, I was not thrilled with it. \nThey encouraged me to continue to use it, abeit less vigourously. \n   Like I said, I can't say it is a cure-all, but it keeps me stretched out\nand I am in less pain.

A friend of mine is going in later this week for tests to see if has\nemphysema.  His lung capacity has decreased over time.  His father died\nof the disease.  He works in woodworking.  I believe he has a very\noccasional cigarette, perhaps one cigarette a day or even less.  He tells\nme this..I've never seen him light up.  He has some pretty healthy\nlife style habits, good diet, exercise, meditation, retreats, therapy\netc.  Anyhow..he is very concerned with this check up.  I know really\nnothing about the disease.  I believe it interferes with the lining\nof the lung being able to exchange oxygen.
All true.  And all good points.\n\n\n\nWell, making a career out of it is a bit strong.  I still believe\nthat doing your own research is very, very necessary.  I would\nnot have progressed as much as I have today, unless I had spent\nthe many hours in Stanford's Med Library as I have done.\nAnd 5 years ago, it was clear that there was no medicine that \nwould help me.  So should I have stopped searching.  Thank\ngoodness I didn't.  Now I found that there is indeed medicine\nthat helps me.  \n\nI think that what you've said is kind of idealistic.  That you\nwould go to one doctor, get a diagnosis, maybe get a second\nopinion, and then move on with your life.\nJust as an example... having seen 6 of the top specialists in \nthis field in the country, I have received 6 different diagnoses.\nThese are the top names, the ones that people come to from all over\nthe country.  I have HAD to sort all of this out myself.  Going\nto a support group (and in fact, HEADING that support group) was \nhelpful for a while, but after a point, I found it very\nunproductive.  It was much more productive to do library research,\nmake phone calls and put together the pieces of the puzzle myself.\n\nA recent movie, Lorenzo's Oil, offers a perfect example of what\nI'm talking about.  If you haven't seen it, you should.  It's not\na put down of doctor's and neither is what I'm saying.  Doctors are\nonly human and can only do so much.  But there are those of us\nout here who are intelligent and able to sometimes find a missing\npiece of the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.\n\nI guess I'm biased because dizziness is one of those weird things\nthat is still so unknown.  If I had a broken arm, or a weak heart,\nor failing kidneys, I might not have the same opinion.  That's because \nthose things are much more tangible and have much more concise \ndefinitions and treatments.  With dizziness, you just have to\ndecide to live with it or decide to live with it while trying to\nfind your way out of it.\n\n\nI have chosen the latter.\n\n\nLinda\nlindae@netcom.netcom.com

My wife's ob-gyn has an ultrasound machine in her office.  When\nthe doctor couldn't hear a fetal heartbeat (13 weeks) she used\nthe ultrasound to see if everything was ok.  (it was)\n\nOn her next visit, my wife asked another doctor in the office if\nthey read the ultrasounds themselves or if they had a radiologist\nread the pictures.  The doctor very vehemently insisted that they\nwere qualified to read the ultrasound and radiologists were NOT!\n\nMy wife is concerned about this.  She saw a TV show a couple months\nback (something like 20/20 or Dateline NBC, etc.) where an expert\non fetal ultrasounds (a radiologist) was showing all the different\ndeffects that could be detected using the ultrasound.\n\nShould my wife be concerned?  Should we take the pictures to a \nradiologist for a second opinion? (and if so, where would we find\nsuch an expert in Chicago?)  We don't really have any special medical\nreason to be concerned, but if a radiologist will be able to see\nthings the ob-gyn can't, then I don't see why we shouldn't use one.\n\nAny thoughts?

However, in some parts of the\ncountry, you don't need to be known as an LD "specialist" to see a large\nnumber of LD patients walk through your office.  Given the huge problem of\nunderdiagnosis, orthopedists encounter late manifestations of the disease just\nabout every day in their regular practices.  Dr. N. told me that last year,\nhe sent between 2 and 5 patients a week to the LD specialists... and he is not\nthe only orthopedists in the town.\n\nLet's say that only 2 people per week actually have LD.  That means at the\n*very minimum* 104 people in our town (and immediate area) develop late stage\nmanifestations of LD *every year*.  Add in the folks who were diagnosed by\nneurologists, rheumatologists, GPs, etc, and you can see what kind of problem\nwe have.  No wonder just about everybody in town personally knows an LD\npatient.\n\nHe refers most patients to LD specialists, but in extreme cases he puts the\npatient on medication immediately to minimize the damage (in most cases, to\nthe knees).\n\nGordon is correct when he states that most LD specialists are GPs.\n\n-Marc.\n-- \n--

Gordon Banks:\n\nThis certainly describes my situation perfectly. For me there is\na constant dynamic between my tendency to eat, which appears to\nbe totally limitless, and the purely conscious desire to not\nput on too much weight. When I get too fat, I just diet/exercise\nmore (with varying degrees of success) to take off the\nextra weight. Usually I cycle within a 15 lb range, but\nsmaller and larger cycles occur as well. I'm always afraid\nthat this method will stop working someday, but usually\nI seem to be able to hold the weight gain in check.\nThis is one reason I have a hard time accepting the notion\nof some metabolic derangement associated with cycle dieting\n(that results in long-term weight gain). I have been cycle-\ndieting for at least 20 years without seeing such a change.\n\nI think a vigorous exercise program can go a long way toward\nkeeping the cycles smaller and the baseline weight low.

Indeed, an extreme example.  It came "out of nowhere."

From my reading of the popular, and scientific, literature,  I think that the\nbenzopyrene-from-burned-fat problem is probably real but very small compared to\nother kinds of risks.  (This type of problem also occurs with stove-top pan\ngrilling.)  One possible remedy I have read about is to take some vitamin C with your meal of barbecue (or bacon, e.g.).  This MAY make sense because vit. C\nis an antioxidant which could counteract the adverse affect of some of the \nchemicals in question.  Bon Apetit!
This is generally called phimosis..usually it is due to an inflammation, and ca\nn be retracted in the physician's offfice rather eaaasily.  One should see a GP\n, or in complicated cases, a urologist.

I have a 42 yr old male friend, misdiagnosed as having\n osteopporosis for two years, who recently found out that his\n illness is the rare Gaucher's disease. \n\nGaucher's disease symptoms include: brittle bones (he lost 9 \n inches off his hieght); enlarged liver and spleen; internal\n bleeding; and fatigue (all the time). The problem (in Type 1) is\n attributed to a genetic mutation where there is a lack of the\n enzyme glucocerebroside in macrophages so the cells swell up.\n This will eventually cause death.\n\nEnyzme replacement therapy has been successfully developed and\n approved by the FDA in the last few years so that those patients\n administered with this drug (called Ceredase) report a remarkable\n improvement in their condition. Ceredase, which is manufactured\n by biotech biggy company--Genzyme--costs the patient $380,000\n per year. Gaucher's disease has justifyably been called "the most\n expensive disease in the world".\n\nNEED INFO:\nI have researched Gaucher's disease at the library but am relying\n on netlanders to provide me with any additional information:\n**news, stories, reports\n**people you know with this disease\n**ideas, articles about Genzyme Corp, how to get a hold of\n   enough money to buy some, programs available to help with\n   costs.\n**Basically ANY HELP YOU CAN OFFER\n\nThanks so very much!

My wife and I are in the process of selecting a pediatrician for our\nfirst child (due June 15th).  We interviewed a young doctor last week\nand were very impressed with her.  However, I discovered that she is\nactually not an Medical Doctor (M.D.) but rather a "Doctor of \nOsteopathy" (D.O.).  What's the difference?  I believe the pediatrician\n*I* went to for many years was a D.O. and he didn't seem different from\nany other doctor I've seen over the years.\n\nMy dictionary says that osteopathy is "a medical therapy that emphasizes\nmanipulative techniques for correcting somatic abnormalities thought\nto cause disease and inhibit recovery."\n\nJeez, this sounds like chiropractic.  I remember getting shots and\nmedicine from *my* pediatrician D.O., and don't remember any \n"manipulative techniques".  Perhaps someone could enlighten me as to\nthe real, practical difference between an M.D. and a D.O.  Also, I'm\ninteresting in hearing any opinions on choosing a pediatrician who\nfollows one or the other medical philosophy.\n\nReaders of sci.med:  Please respond directly to sbrenner@attmail.com;\nI do not read this group regularly and probably won't see your response\nif you just post it here.  Sorry for the cross-posting, but I'm hoping\nthere's some expertise here.\n\na T d H v A a N n K c S e

Isn't there a relatively new treatment for kidney stones involving\n   a non-invasive use of ultra-sound where the patient is lowered\n   into some sort of liquid when he/she undergoes treatment?

Well, let me put it this way, based on my own experience.  A\ngeneral practitioner with no training in infectious diseases,\nby establishing links to the "Lyme community", treating patients\nwho come to him wondering about lyme or having decided they\nhave lyme as if they did, saying that diseases such as MS\nare probably spirochetal, if not Lyme, giving talks at meetings\nof users groups, validating the feelings of even delusional\npatients, etc.  This GP can go from being a run-of-the-mill\n$100K/yr GP to someone with lots of patients in the hospital\nand getting expensive infusions that need monitoring in his\noffice, and making lots of bread.  Also getting the adulation\nof many who believe his is their only hope (if not of cure,\nthen of control) and seeing his name in publications put out\nby support groups, etc.  This is a definite temptation.\n\n-- \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGordon Banks  N3JXP      | "Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and\ngeb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon."
Wow, the WWII channel did something not-WWII?\n\n\nThe graphics capabilities of the computers were very faked for movie \naudiences who have not ability or patience with numbers.  The book was more \nrealistic in that respect.  In all respects, actually.  The robotics are \nstill out of range, but not impossible.\n\n\nSF (and I"ve always wondered how Crichton escapes this classification) is \nusually ahead of science in both prediction and precaution.  NASA's \ndecontaimination processes were supposedly taken to prevent SF story \ndisasters.  I mean, NASA scientists were often SF readers (and \nsometimes writers) and felt pre-warned by their reading.\n\n\nI think the film still holds up among the best of SF films, but that isn't \nsaying a whole lot.
As you note, the research is mixed, so there is no consensus on the\nrole of fatty acids in Ulcerative colitis.  There is a role for short\nchain fatty acids in patients with colostomies and rectal pouches\nthat are inflammed (Short is butyrate and shorter).  There may be a role\nfor treatment of UC with Short chain fatty acids, and I am looking \nforward to the upcoming AGA meeting in Boston to see what people are\ndoing.  \n\nYou raise a hypothesis about the studies and restriction of other\nfatty acids.  You should contact the authors directly about that or\neven write a letter to the editor - it is a good point.  By the way,\nthe abbreviation EPA is not in general use, so I do not know what \nfatty acid you are speaking about.\n\nAnd to Brian an U of C ---  There is a physician named Stephen Hanauer\nthere who is a recognized expert in the treatment of IBD.  You might \ngive him a call.  He is interested in new combinations of drugs for \nthe treatment of IBD.  If you call please say hello to him from me,\nI was looking at U of C for a position, and perhaps still am.  And\nbe sure to look into joining the CCFA.\n\nBest of Luck.
What does "DC" stand for?  Couldn't be an antichiropractic posting\nfrom a chiropractor, could it?  My curiosity is piqued.\n\nProstate CA is an especially troublesome entity for chiropractors.\nIt so typically causes bone pain due to spinal metastases that it\ngets manipulated frequently.  Manipulating a cancer riddled bone\nis highly dangerous, since it can then fracture.  I've seen at\nleast three cases where this happened with resulting neurologic\ndamage, including paraplegia.  This is one instance where knowing\nhow to read x-rays can really help a chiropractor stay out of trouble.\nDO chiropractors know what bony mets from prostate look like?\n\n\n-- \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGordon Banks  N3JXP      | "Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and\ngeb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon."
FMGs.\nparticularly\n\nFMGs who are not citizens are, like all aliens, in a difficult\nsituation. Only citizens get to vote here, so non-citizens are of\nlittle or no interest to legislators. Also, the non-citizen may well\nbe in the middle of processing for resident alien status. There is a\nstron sense that rocking the boat (eg. suing a residency program)\nwill delay the granting of that status, perhaps for ever.

Short of changes by the feds, there is no way.  Codeine alone is very\ndifficult to prescribe without a lot of hassles.  Tylenol #3 is the\nbest compromise.  That way he can get refills.

That's ridiculous!\n\n\nThey aren't designed, they evolved.  And, much as it discomforts us, in\nhumans a trouble-free birth process was sacrificed to increased brain and\ncranial size.  Wild animals have a much easier time with birth than humans do.\nDomestic horses and cows typically have a worse time.  To give you an idea:\nmy family tree is complicated because a few of my pioneer great-great-\ngrandfathers had several wives, and we never could figure out which wife\nhad each child.  One might ask why this happened.  My great-great-\ngrandfathers were, by the time they reached their forties, quite prosperous\nfarmers.  Nonetheless, they lost several wives each to the rigors of\nchildbirth; the graveyards in Spencer, Indiana, and Boswell, North Dakota,\ncontain quite a few gravestones like "Ida, wf. of Jacob Liptrap, and\nbaby, May 6, 1853."\n\n\nMore like one in ten.  And the consequences can be devastating; I have\ndirect experience of more than a dozen victims of a fouled-up breech birth.\n\n\nIt isn't always fatal.  But it is often fatal, when it happens out of\nreach of adequate help.  More often, it permanently damages one's health.\n\nClearly women's bodies _evolved_ to give birth (I am no believer in divine\ndesign); however, evolution did not favor trouble-free births for humans.  \n\n\nMy, aren't we wroth!  I haven't read a more outrageous straw man attack\nin months!  I can practically see your mouth foam.\n\nWe're statistically sophisticated enough to balance the risks.  Although\nI can't produce exact statistics 5 years after the last time we looked\nthem up, rest assured that we balanced C-section risks against other risks.\nI wouldn't encourage my wife to have a Caesarean unless it was clearly\nindicated; on the other hand, I am opposed (on obvious grounds) to waiting\nuntil an emergency to give in.\n\nAnd bear this in mind: my wife took the lead in all of these decisions.\nWe talked things over, and I did a lot of the leg work, but the main\ndecisions were really hers.\n\n\nI don't know of very many home birth advocates, even, that think that\na first-time mother should have her baby at home.\n\n\nBut people should bother to find out the relative risks.  My wife was\nunwilling to take any significant risks in order to have nice surroundings.\nIn view of the intensity of the birth experience, I doubt surroundings\nhave much importance anyway.  Somehow the values you're advocating seem\nall lopsided to me: taking risks, even if fairly small, of serious\npermanent harm in order to preserve something that is, after all,\nan esthetic consideration.

Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port\n        2. X terminals\n        3. NeXT\n        4. Silicon Graphics\n        5. IBM RS/6000\n	6. Other stuff\n\n    1. Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port\n\n	If you've got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard\n	(Sun, HP, DEC, etc.) then you're going to have a hard time finding\n	a vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard.  If your workstation\n	runs the X window system, you're in luck.  You can buy a cheap used\n	PC, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cable\n	to your workstation.  Then, run a program on the workstation to read\n	the serial port and generate fake X keyboard events.\n\n	The two main programs I've found to do this are KT and A2X.\n\n	a2x is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse, and\n	even moving among widgets on the screen.  It requires a server\n	extension (XTEST, DEC-XTRAP, or XTestExtension1).  To find out if your\n	server can do this, run 'xdpyinfo' and see if any of these strings\n	appear in the extensions list.  If your server doesn't have this,\n	you may want to investigate compiling X11R5, patchlevel 18 or later,\n	or bugging your vendor.\n\n	kt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended X servers.\n	Another program called xsendevent also exists, but I haven't seen it.\n\n	Both a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu.\n\n    2. X terminals\n\n	Also, a number of X terminals (NCD, Tektronics, to name a few) use\n	PC-compatible keyboards.  If you have an X terminal, you may be all\n	set.  Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through the\n	trouble of buying an alternative keyboard.  Also, some X terminals add\n	extra buttons -- you may need to keep your original keyboard around\n	for the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the Setup key.\n\n    3. NeXT\n\n	NeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple Desktop\n	Bus, meaning any Mac keyboard will work.  Then, they announced they\n	were cancelling their hardware production.  If you want any kind of\n	upgrade for an older NeXT, do it now!\n\n    4. Silicon Graphics\n\n	Silicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines (Indigo^2 and\n	beyond) will use standard PC-compatible keyboards and mice.  I don't\n	believe this also applies to the Power Series machines.  It's not\n	possible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards, except by\n	upgrading the entire machine.  Contact your SGI sales rep for more\n	details.\n\n    5. IBM RS/6000\n\n	IBM RS/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards.  ||\n	Unfortunately, you can't just plug one in.  You need two things: a  ||\n	cable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the   ||\n	smaller PS/2 style DIN-6, and a new device driver for AIX.  Believe ||\n	it or not, IBM wrote this device driver recently, I used it, and it ||\n	works.  However, they don't want me to redistribute it.  I've been  ||\n	told Judy Hume (512) 823-6337 is a potential contact.  If you learn ||\n	anything new, please send me e-mail.				    ||\n    \n    6. Other stuff\n\n	Some vendors here (notably: Health Care Keyboard Co. and AccuCorp)\n	support some odd keyboard types, and may be responsive to your\n	queries regarding supporting your own weird computer.  If you can\n	get sufficient documention about how your keyboard works (either\n	from the vendor, or with a storage oscilloscope), you may be in\n	luck.  Contact the companies for more details.\n\n\nApple Adjustable Keyboard\n    Apple Computer, Inc.\n    Sales offices all over the place.\n\n    Availability: February, 1993\n    Price: $219\n    Supports: Mac only\n\n    Apple has recently announced their new split-design keyboard.  The\n    keyboard has one section for each hand, and the sections rotate\n    backward on a hinge.  The sections do not tilt upward.  The keys are\n    arranged in a normal QWERTY fashion.\n\n    The main foldable keyboard resembles a normal Apple Keyboard.\n    A separate keypad contains all the extended key functions.\n\n    The keyboard also comes with matching wrist rests, which are not\n    directly attachable to the keyboard.\n\n    As soon as soda comes back up, I'll have a detailed blurb from\n    TidBITS available there.\n\n\nFlexPro Keyboard\n    Key Tronic\n    Phone: 800-262-6006\n    Possible contact: Denise Razzeto, 509-927-5299\n    Sold by many clone vendors and PC shops\n\n    Availability: Spring, 1993 (?)\n    Price: $489 (?)\n    Supports: PC only (highly likely)\n\n    Keytronic apparently showed a prototype keyboard at Comdex.  It's\n    another split-design.  One thumb-wheel controls the tilt of both\n    the left and right-hand sides of the main alphanumeric section.\n    The arrow keys and keypad resemble a normal 101-key PC keyboard.\n\n    Keytronic makes standard PC keyboards, also, so this product will\n    probably be sold through their standard distribution channels.\n\n\nDragonDictate-30K (and numerous other Dragon products)\n    Dragon Systems, Inc.\n    320 Nevada Street\n    Newton, MA  02160\n\n    Phone: 800-TALK-TYP or 617-965-5200\n    Fax: 617-527-0372\n\n    Shipping: Now.\n\n    Price: DragonDictate-30K -- $4995 (end user system)\n	   DragonWriter 1000 -- $1595 / $2495 (end user/developer system)\n	   various other prices for service contracts, site licenses, etc.\n    \n    Compatibility: 386 (or higher) PC only\n		   (3rd party support for Mac)\n\n	Free software support for X windows is also available -- your\n	PC with Dragon hardware talks to your workstation over a\n	serial cable or network.

They sell you\n    a hardware board and software which sits in front of a number\n    of popular word processors and spreadsheets.\n\n    Each user `trains' the system to their voice, and there are provisions\n    to correct the system when it makes mistakes, on the fly.  Multiple\n    people can use it, but you have to load a different personality file\n    for each person.  You still get the use of your normal keyboard, too.\n    On the DragonDictate-30K you need to pause 1/10th sec between\n    words.

The layout resembles the\n    standard 101-key keyboard, except sliced into three sections.  Each\n    section is on a "custom telescoping universal mount."

I got asked in Sci. Med. Nutrition about vitamin C and oxalate production(\ntoxic, kidney stone formation?).  I decided to post my answer here as well \nbecause of the recent question about kidney stones.  Not long after I got \ninto Sci. Med. I got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium \nwould prevent kidney stone formation.  I'm going to state it again here.\nBut the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take B6 \nsupplements.  Read on to find out why(I have my asbestos suit on now guys).\n\nVitamin C will form oxalic acid.  But large doses are needed (above 6 grams \nper day).\n\n	1. Review Article "Nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney \n	   stones with particular emphasis on Vitamin C" Int. Clin. Nutr. Rev.\n	   5(3):110-129(1985).\n\nBut glycine also forms oxalic acid(D-amino acid oxidases).  For both \nglycine and vitamin C, one of the best ways to drastically reduce this \nproduction is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin C or glycine, \nbut to increase your intake of vitamin B6.\n\n	2. "Control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in \n	    patients with kidney stones" Int. Urol. Nephrol. 20(4):353-59(1988)\n	    200 to 500 mg of B6 each day significasntly decreased the urinary \n	    excretion of oxalate over the 18 month treatment program.\n\n	3. The action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria" Clin. Sci. 38\n	   :277-86(1970).  Patients receiving at least 150mg B6 each day \n	   showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels.\n\nFor gylcine, this effect is due to increased transaminase activity(B6 is \nrequired for transaminase activity) which makes less glycine available for \noxidative deamination(D-amino acid oxidases).  For vitamin C, the effect is \nquite different.  There are different pathways for vitamin C catabolism.  \nThe pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have 17 to 40% \nof the ingested dose going into oxalic acid.  But this is highly variable \nand the vitamin C review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto \n6 grams per day, not too much vitamin C gets catabolized to form oxalic \nacid.  At very high doses of vitamin C(above 10 grams per day), more of the \nextra vitamin C (more than 40% conversion) can end up as oxalic acid.  In a \nvery early study on vitamin C and oxalic production(Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. \nMed. 85:190-92(1954), intakes of 2 grams per day up to 9 grams per day \nincreased the average oxalic acid excretion from 38mg per day up to 178mg \nper day.  Until 8 grams per day was reached, the average excreted was \nincreased by only 3 to 12mg per day(2 gram dose, 4 gram dose, 8 gram dose \nand 9gram dose). 8 grams jumped it to 45mg over the average excretion \nbefore supplementation and 9 grams jumped it to 150 mg over the average \nbefore supplementation.\n\nB6 is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body.  There \nare probably some enzymes that require vitamin B6 that we don't know about \nyet.  Vitamin C catabolism is still not completely understood but the \nspeculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must \nhave an enzyme in it that requires B6.  Differences in B6 levels could then \nexplain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin C \nchallenge(this is not the preferred route of catabolism).  Increasing your \nintake of B6 would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you \ntake vitamin C supplements.  Since the typical American diet is deficient \nin B6, some researchers believe that the main cause of calcium-oxalate \nkidney stones is B6 deficiency(especially since so little oxalic acid gets \nabsorbed from the gut).  Diets providing 0 to 130mg of oxalic acid per day \nshowed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate(Urol Int.35:309\n-15,1980).  If 400mg was present each day, there was a significant increase \nin urinary oxalate excretion.\n\n	Here are the high oxalate foods:\n\n	1. Beans, coca, instant coffee, parsley, rhubarb, spinach and tea.\n	   Contain at least 25mg/100grams\n\n	2. Beet tops, carrots, celery, chocolate, cumber, grapefruit, kale, \n	   peanuts, pepper, sweet potatoe.\n	   Contain 10 to 25 mg/100grams.\n\nIf the threshold is 130mg per day, you can see that you really have a lot \nof latitude in food selection.  A recent N.Eng.J. Med. article also points \nout that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your \nintake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being \nabsorbed at all.  If you also increase your intake of B6, you shouldn't \nhave to worry about kidney stones at all. The RDA for B6 is 2mg per day for \nmales and 1.6mg per day for females(directly related to protein intake).\nB6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if it is consumed in doses of 500mg or more \nper day for an extended peroid(weeks to months).  \n\nThe USDA food survey done in 1986 had an average intake of 1.87 mg per day \nfor males and 1.16mg per day for females living in the U.S.  Coupled with \nthis low intake was a high protein diet(which greatly increases the B6 \nrequirement), as well as the presence of some of the 40 different drugs that \neither block B6 absorption, are metabolic antagonists of B6, or promote B6 \nexcretion in the urine.  Common ones are: birth control pills, alcohol,\nisoniazid, penicillamine, and corticosteroids.  I tell my students to \nsupplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that \nincrease the B6 requirement.  The dose recommended for patients taking \nbirth control pills is 10-15mg per day and this should work for most of the \nother drugs that increase the B6 requirement(this would be on top of your \ndietary intake of B6).  Any patient that has a history of kidney stone \nformation should be given B6 supplements.\n\nOne other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your \nCa/Mg dietary ratio is 2/1.  Magnesium-oxalate is much more soluble than is \ncalcium-oxalate.\n\n	4. "The magnesium:calcium ratio in the concentrated urines of \npatients with calcium oxalate calculi"Invest. Urol 10:147(1972)\n\n	5. "Effect of magnesium citrate and magnesium oxide on the \ncrystallization of calcium in urine: changes producted by food-magnesium \ninteraction"J. Urol. 143(2):248-51(1990).\n\n	6.Review Article, "Magnesium in the physiopathology and treatment \nof renal calcium stones" J. Presse Med. 161(1):25-27(1987).\n\nThere are actually about three times as many articles published in the \nmedical literature on the role of magnesium in preventing kidney stone \nformation than there are for B6.  I thought that I was being pretty safe in \nstating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation in an earlier \npost in this news group but good old John A. in Mass. jumped all over me. I \nguess that he doesn't read the medical literature.  Oh well, since kidney \nstones can be a real pain and a lot of people suffer from them, I thought \nI'd tell you how you can avoid the pain and stay out of the doctor's office.\n\nMartin Banschbach, Ph.D.\nProfessor of Biochemistry and Chairman\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Microbiology\nOSU College of Osteopathic Medicine\n1111 W. 17th Street\nTulsa, Ok. 74107

I recently learned about these devices that supposedly induce specific \nbrain wave frequencies in their users simply by wearing them. Mind machines\nconsist of LED gogles, head phones, and a microprocessor that controls them.\nThey strobe the (closed) eye and send sound pulses in sync with the flashing\nLEDs. I understand that these devices are experimental, but they are available.\nI've heard claims that they can induce sleep, and light trance states for\nrelaxation. Essentially they are supposed to work without aid of drugs etc...\nI would think that if they work as reported they would be incredibly useful,\nThe few sources I've seen are biased (they are selling the things, and a\nfriend who has tried them claims that "every home should have one"). So \ndo these mind machines (aka Light and Sound machines) work? can they induce\nalpha, theta, and/or delta waves in a person wearing them? What research if\nany has been done on them? Could they be used in lieu of a tranquilizer?\nOr are they just another bit of quackery?\n\nWeb Homer

The danger in philosophizing about science is that theory and generalization \ncan end up being far removed from the actual day-to-day of the grunt at the\nbench.  Yes, its great to be involved in a process were I can walk into the\nlab after a heavy night of dreaming and just do something for the hell of it\n(as long as my advisor doesn't catch me - which is easy enough to do), but \nstamping out such behavior seems to be the purpose in life of grant review \ncommittees and the peer review process in general.  In today's world that's \nwhat determines what science is: what gets funded.  And a damn good thing to.\nFlights of fantasy just don't have much chance of producing anything, at \nleast not in biomedical research.  The surest way for a graduate student to\nruin their life is to work in a lab where the boss is more concerned with \nfleshing out his/her fantasies than with having the student work on a project\nthat actually has a good chance of producing some results.  MD's seem to \nbe particularly prone to this aberrant behavior.  \n\n\nI have to agree with Gary Merrill's response to this.  I've read alot of the\nAlu and middle repetitive sequence work and it's really very interesting, \ngood work with implications for many fields in molecular genetics.  It's \nreally an example of how a well reasoned project turned up interesting \nresults that were unexpected.

One thing that I haven't seen in this thread is a discussion of the\nrelation between IBD inflammation and the profile of ingested fatty\nacids (FAs).\n\nI was diagnosed last May w/Crohn's of the terminal ileum. When I got\nout of the hospital I read up on it a bit, and came across several\nstudies investigating the role of EPA (an essentially FA) in reducing\ninflammation. The evidence was mixed. [Many of these studies are\ndiscussed in "Inflammatory Bowel Disease," MacDermott, Stenson. 1992.]\n\nBut if I recall correctly, there were some methodological bones to be\npicked with the studies (both the ones w/pos. and w/neg. results). In\nthe studies patients were given EPA (a few grams/day for most of the\nstudies), but, if I recall correctly, there was no restriction of the\n_other_ FAs that the patients could consume. From the informed\nlayperson's perspective, this seems mistaken. If lots of n-6 FAs are\nconsumed along with the EPA, then the ratio of "bad" prostanoid\nproducts to "good" prostanoid products could still be fairly "bad."\nIsn't this ratio the issue?\n\nWhat's the view of the gastro. community on EPA these days? EPA\nsupplements, along with a fairly severe restriction of other FAs\nappear to have helped me significantly (though it could just be the\nlow absolute amount of fat I eat -- 8-10% calories).

Yes, absolutely, though I'd make the observation in a more general sense of\nall observations are made by human beings and therefore made with various\nbiases. \n\nBut here your message leaves talk of hypothesis and gets back, once again, \nto equating the business of science with the end result, the gizmo produced.\n\n\nMy point isn't so much whether or not you have a novel paradigm but *how* \nyou come about developing it.\n\n\nPerhaps you'd admit that this is an oversimplification on your part (the topic\nof the philosophy of science is made for them, I'm making them too) but I\nthink that it also summarizes popular misconceptions of science and the \nbusiness of doing science.  Biomedical research doesn't make any basic \nassumptions that aren't the same as any other discipline of scientific\nresearch.  That is, that you make empirical observations, form an hypothesis\nand test it.  Modern medicine has much more to do with biochemistry than \n"the old Newtonian model of the world".  And I doubt that many psychologists\nwould appreciate being put outside this empirical "world view".  Psychology\nalso has more to do with biochemistry than spoon bending. \n\n\nOversimplified, of course, but a good example.  This is an empirical observa-\ntion.  It was then tested, though perhaps not by Aristotle, and eventually \nfound wanting.  In the meantime, some folk will \nhave continued to believe in the spontaneous generation of animal life.  \nThere's nothing at all surprising about this, it's the way the gathering of\nknowledge works.  There are probably more than a few things in my own \ndiscipline of molecular biology that will be found to be totally off-base,\neven idiotic, to someone in the future.  These future people won't have come\nto these relevations because they had suddenly gone all Zen-like and had \na vision in an LSD trip.  Someone will have thought of something new and \ntested it.  This is the bit that people who seem to relish misrepresenting\nscience and research can't seem to wrap their minds around.  Science is a \ncreative process.  What I think of as factual and good research can be totally\nturned on its head tommorrow by new results and theories.
The term arrhythmia is usually used to encompass a wide range of abnormal\nheart rhythms (cardiac dysrhythmias).  Some of them are very serious\nwhile others are completely benign.  Having "a few irregular beats"\non an EKG could be serious depending on what those beats were and\nwhen they occurred, or could be of no significance.\n\nLow blood potassium levels probably predispose people with underlying\nheart disease to develop arrhythmias.  Very low potassium levels are\nclearly dangerous, but it is not clear how much of a problem\nlow-end-of-normal levels are:  a lot of cardiologists seem to treat\nanyone with even a mildly low-normal potassium level.
I can not believe the way this thread on candida(yeast) has progressed.\nSteve Dyer and I have been exchanging words over the same topic in Sci. \nMed. Nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women \nposter for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did \nnot exist.  Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible Steve and I \nsee that you and some of the others are doing it here as well.  \n\nLet me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have \nno idea how the human body interacts with it's environment and how that \nbalance can be altered by diet and antibiotics.  These are the physicians \nwho dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go \nfrom doctor to doctor to find relief(like Elaine in Sci. Med. Nutrition) and \nthen when they find one that solves their problem, the rest start yelling \nquack.  Could it just be professional jealousy?  I couldn't help Elaine or Jon\nbut somebody else did.  Could they know more than Me?  No way, they must be a \nquack.  \n\nI've been teaching a human nutrition course for Medical students for over ten \nyears now and guess who the most receptive students are?  Those that were \nraised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their \nfarm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to \nentering medical school(switched to the vegan diet).  Typically, this is \nabout 1/3 of my class of 90 students.  Those not interested in nutrition \neither tune me out or just stop coming to class.  That's okay because I \nknow that some of what I'm teaching is going to stick and there will be at \nleast a few "enlightened" physicians practicing in the U.S.  It's really \ntoo bad that most U.S. medical schools don't cover nutrition because if \nthey did, candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the \nmedical profession.\n\nIn animal husbandry, an animal is reinnoculated with "good" bacteria after \nantibiotics are stopped.  Medicine has decided that since humans do not \nhave a ruminant stomach, no such reinnoculation with "good" bacteria is \nneeded after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic.  Humans have all \nkinds of different organisms living in the GI system(mouth, stomach, small \nand large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.  These are \nnonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune \nsystem is compromised.  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike \nthe pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce \ntoxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body.  But any of \nthese organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up \nresidence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this \nhappen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier.\nSteve got real upset with Elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungals \nand vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what \nvitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling \nElaine's doctor a quack.\n\nHere is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly \ncalled, are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsible\nfor this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a \nyeast-like fungus.  An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis.\nCandidiasis is a very rare occurance because, like an E. Coli infection, it \nrequires that the host immune system be severly depressed.  \n\nCandida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of \nnormal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing\nfactor is present such as a high blood glucose level(diabetes) or an oral \ncourse of antibiotics has been used.  In diabetics, their secretions contain \nmuch higher amounts of glucose.  Candida, unlike bacteria, is very limited in \nit's food(fuel) selection.  Without glucose, it can not grow, it just barely \nsurvives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides \nthe other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In \ndiabetics, skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little \nbuggers.  The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but \nsome people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus \nmembrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to \nthe candida or not isn't certain.  When the bloom is in the vagina or on \nthe skin, it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to "treat" it.\nIf it's internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty \nnondiscript.  \n\n\nCandida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in \nthe sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the \nvaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system \nususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless \nthey broach the mucus membrane "barrier".  If they do, an inflammatory \nresponse will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A \nfrom their diets.  About 30% of all American's die with less Vitamin A than \nthey were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin \nA does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane \nbarrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong \ninflammatory response after a candida bloom.  \n\nWhile diabetics can suffer from a candida "bloom" the  most common cause of \nthis type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which \nknock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main \ncompetition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are \navailable to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not \nuse them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of \nthe anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus \ninflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum \nantibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate \njust as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring \nvaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.\n\nBut even in patients being given the anti-fungals, the irritation caused by \nthe excessive candida bloom in the sinus, GI tract or the vagina tends to \nreturn after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of \nthe problem is addressed(lack of a "good" bacterial flora in the body and/or \npoor mucus membrane barrier).  Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective \ntherapy for candida overgrowth.  From it's name, it is an acid loving \norganism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows.  Candida can not \ngrow very well in an acidic environment.  In the vagina, L. acidophilius is \nthe predominate bacteria(unless you are hit with broad spectrum \nantibiotics).  \n\nIn the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good \nreservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very \nfavorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and \nhumidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to \nminimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.  \n\nIf the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even \nblood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the \nbloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology \noccurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool \nfor occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first \nplace.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong \nbut her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplan \nhas told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool \nspecimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of \nfalse positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant \nbasis, I would want it fixed.  Yes it's nice to know that I don't have \ncolon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a \ndoctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.\n\nCandida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria \ntend to prefer a slightly acidic environment.  The vagina becomes alkaline \nduring a woman's period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina. \nVinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal \nproblems.  Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of \nLactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract(I would want to be sure of \nthe purity of the product before trying this).  My wife had this vagina \nproblem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year \nuntil she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting \nscripts for anti-fungal creams.  This was a woman gynocologist who had had \nthe same problem(recurring vaginal yeast infections).  This M.D. did some \ndigging and came up with an acetic acid and L. Acidophilis douche which she \nused in your office to keep it sterile.  After three treatments, sex \nreturned to our marraige.  I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic \nGI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his \npatients is a non-existent syndrome.\n\nThe nonpathogenic bacteria L. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria \nwhich is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women.  \nIf taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.  Through \naresol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes.\nBut before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system \nneeds to be strengthened.  This is accomplished by vitamin A, vitamin C and \nsome of the B-complex vitamins.  Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans \nare not getting enough B6 and folate.  These are probably the segement of \nthe population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent \ndisorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy).\n \nSome of the above material was obtained from "Natural Healing" by Mark \nBricklin, Published by Rodale press, as well as notes from my human \nnutrition course.  I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A  sometime in \nthe future, along with reference citings to point out the extremely \nimportant role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in \nthe body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida \nblooms.  Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate \nintake during the treatment phase, this is especially important if the GI \nsystem is involved.  If candida can not get glucose, it's not going to out \ngrow the bacteria and you then give bacteria, which can use amino acids and \nfatty acids for energy, a chance to take over and keep the candida in check \nonce carbohydrate is returned to the gut.\n\nIf Steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post, \nfine.  I jumped all over Steve in Sci. Med. Nutrition because he verbably \naccosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor's use of vitamin \nA and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut.  People seeking advice \nfrom newsnet should not be treated this way.  Those of us giving of our \ntime and knowledge can slug it out to our heart's content.  If you saved \nyour venom for me Steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly \nseeking help alone, I wouldn't have a problem with your behavior. \n \nMartin Banschbach, Ph.D.\nProfessor of Biochemistry and Chairman\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Microbiology\nOSU College of Osteopathic Medicine\n1111 West 17th St.\nTulsa, Ok. 74107
A friend of mine has been diagnosed with Psoriatic Arthritis, as a result of\ntrauma sustained in a car accident several years ago.  The psoriasis is under\ncontrol but the arthritis part of the illness is not.\n\nAnsaid (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory) worked pretty well for three years but\nisn't helping much now.  My friend is now taking Meclomen (another NSAID) but\nthis isn't helping control the pain at all.  In the past two months my friend\nhas also started taking Azulfadine along with the NSAID medicines, but the\neffects of the combined drugs aren't supposed to be realized for several months.\n\nAs a result of the pain, my friend is having problems sleeping.  Staying in\none position too long is an ordeal.  Another major contributor to pain is that\ntendonitis has now developed (left thumb and hand with numbness at the base of\nthe palm; bottom of feet; shoulders and outer thighs).  The tendonitis is\nquite painful yet my friend's doctor has not recommended any form of treatment\nto relieve it.\n\nThe latest twist is that the doctor has dropped the anti-inflammatories and is\nnow recommending Prednisone.  The hope is that the Prednisone will relieve some\nof the pain from the tendonitis.\n\nMy friend is a 41 year old male who feels like he's 80 (his words, not mine).\n\n\nIf anyone is aware of any new treatments for Psoriatic Arthritis, alternative\ncourses of action, support groups or literature on it, I would be extremely\ngrateful if you could e-mail to me.  If anyone is interested, I'll post a\nsummary to this newsgroup.
My daughter has Epilepsy and I attend a monthly parent support group.\nJust Wednesday night, a mother was telling how she decided to throw\nall the junk food out and see if it made a difference in her 13 year-old's\nseizures.  He was having about one seizure per week.  She reported that\nshe did this on Thursday (3/11), he had a seizure on Saturday and then\nwent 4 weeks without a seizure!!  On Easter he went to Grandma's and ate \ncandy, pop - anything he wanted.  He had a seizure the next day.  She \nsees sensitivity to nutrasweet, sugar, colors, caffine and corn.  With\ncorn she says, he gets very nervous and aggresive.  \n\nWith my own daughter (age 7) , I think she is also sensitive and stays\naway from those foods on her own.  She has never had gum, won't eat\ncandy, prefers an apple to a cookie, doesn't like chocolate and won't\neven use toothpaste!!!  Her brother, on the other hand, is a junk food\naddict!
Hi Janet,\n\nSounds exactly like mine.  Same circumstance, same onset symptoms, \nsame cafergot uselessness, same duration.  In fact, of all the people\nI know who have migraines, none have been so similar.  There is such\na wide variation between people with respect to what causes their\nheadaches, that I generally don't bother sharing what I've learned\nabout mine, but since ours seem to be alike, here are my observations.\n\nI don't think it's heat, per se (I've had more in winter than summer).\nDehydration could conceivably figure, though.  Try tanking up before\nplaying rather than after.\n\nBeing in shape doesn't seem to help me much, either.\n\nI've identified four factors that do make a difference (listed in \ndescending order of importance):\n\n1) Heavy exercise\n2) Sleep deprivation\n3) Fasting		(e.g., skipped breakfast)\n4) Physical trauma	(e.g., head bonk)\n\nHeavy exercise has preceded all of my post-adolescent migraines, but I \ndon't get migraines after every heavy exercise session.  One or more of \nthe other factors *must* be present (usually #2).  Since I discovered \nthis, I've been nearly migraine-free -- relapsing only once every two \nor three years when I get cocky ("It's been so long, maybe I just don't \nget them anymore") and stop being careful.\n\nHope this is helpful.
IMHO, the original poster has no business soliciting diagnoses off the net,\nnor does Dr./Mr.  O'Donnell have any business supplying same. This is one\nmajor reason real physicians avoid this newsgroup like the plague. It is\nalso another example of the double standard: if I as a physician offered\nto diagnose and treat on the net, I can be sued. But people without\nqualifications are free to do whatever they want and disclaim it all with\n"I'm not a doctor."\n\nGet and keep this crap off the net. Period.
Rutin is a bioflavonoid, compounds found (among other places) in the\nrinds of citrus fruits.  These have been popular, especially in Europe,\nto treat "capillary fragility", and seemingly in even more extreme cases--\na few months ago, a friend was visiting from Italy, and he said that he'd\nhad hemorrhoids, but his pharmacist friend sold him some pills.  Incredulously,\nI asked to look at them, and sure enough these contained rutin as the active\ningredient.  I probably destroyed the placebo effect from my skeptical\nsputtering.  I have no idea how he's doing hemorrhoid-wise these days.\nThe studies which attempted to look at the effect of these compounds in\nhuman disease and nutrition were never very well controlled, so the\nreports of positive results with them is mostly anecdotal.\n\nThis stuff is pretty much non-toxic, and probably inexpensive, so there's\nlittle risk of trying it, but I wouldn't expect much of a result.
I would say there are also significant numbers of unscrupulous doctors (of\nthe squeaky-clean, traditional crew-cut, talk to the AMA before starting\nany treatment, kind) who recommend treatments that, though "accepted", may\nnot be necessary for the patient at the time.  And all for making a quick\nbuck.  I would not be surprised if the cost of medical services in the U.S. is\nsignificantly inflated by these "quacks of a different color".  In fact, I'd\nsay these doctors are the most dangerous since they call into question the\ntrue focus of the medical profession.  The AMA and the Boards should focus\non these "quacks" instead of devoting unbelievable energy on 'search-and-\ndestroy-missions' to pull the licenses of those doctors who are trying non-\ntraditional or not fully accepted treatments for their desperate patients\nthat traditional/accepted medicine cannot help.\n\n\n***************************************************\nNow to make a general comment on many recent posts:\n***************************************************\n\nLately I've seen the word "quack" bandied about recklessly.  When a doctor or\ndoctor-wanna-be has decided to quit discussing any controversial medical\nsubject in a civilized manner, all he/she has to do is say "quack-quack" and\nsomehow they magically expect the readership of this newsgroup to roll over\non their backs and pee-pee on themselves in obedience.  What do they teach\nyou in medical school - how to throw your authority around?\n\nLet me put it another way to make my point clear:  "quack" is a nebulous word\nlacking in any precision.  Its sole use is to obfuscate the issues at hand.\nThe indiscriminate use of this word is a sure sign of incompetency;  and coming\nfrom any medical doctor (or wanna-be), where competency is expected, is real\nscary.\n\nBut what do I know, I've already been diagnosed by the sci.med.gods in this\nnewsgroup as being 'anal retentive', and 'psychotic'.  I look forward to more\nnet.diagnoses.  Hey, they're free.\n\n\nJon "Quacks 'R Us" Noring\n\n\n(p.s., may I suggest - seriously - that if the doctors and wanna-be-doctors on\nthe net who refuse to have an open mind on alternative treatments and\ntheories, such as the "yeast theory", should create your own moderated group.\nYou can call it sci.med.traditional.moderated or sci.med.AMA-approved, so you\ncan keep anal-retentives like me out of it.)\n\n-- \n\nCharter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.

Hate to wreck your elaborate theory, but Steve Dyer is not an MD.\nSo professional jealosy over doctors who help their patients with\nNystatin, etc., can't very well come into the picture.

If people don't react to candida,\nwe assume the TB test was not conclusive since such people may not\nreact to anything.  All normal people have antibodies to candida.\nIf not, you would quickly turn into a fungus ball.\n\n\nYou've just discovered one of the requirements for a good quack theory.\nFind something that no one can *disprove* and then write a book saying\nit is the cause of whatever.

This is the second post which seems to be blurring the distinction\nbetween real disease caused by Candida albicans and the "disease"\nthat was being asked about, systemic yeast syndrome.\n\nThere is no question that Candida albicans causes thrush.  It also\nseems to be the case that active yogurt cultures with acidophilous\nmay reduce recurrences of thrush at least for vaginal thrush -- I've \nnever heard of anyone taking it for oral thrush before (though \npresumably it would work by the same mechanism).\n\nCandida is clearly a common minor pathogen and a less common major\npathogen.  That does not mean that there is evidence that it causes\nthe "systemic yeast syndrome".
Have you ever met a chemist?  A food industry businessman?

Why does it put salt in food?\nSame reason.\n\n\nObviously.\n \n\n \nOf course not!  (Although I would think that a person like you would be a\nbig fan of such recycling if that were the case).\n\n \nOn occasion that's probably the case, but in general the idea is that MSG\nimproves the flavor of certain foods.\n \n \nNo.\n \n \nNo.\n \n \nObviously.\n \n \nAs I recall, these are natural by-products of heating up certain foods.\nThey don't "put it in there".\n \n \nhave a number of criteria in choosing how to process food.  They want to\nmake it taste good, look good, sell for a good price, etc.  The fact that they\nuse it tells me that THEY think that it contributes to those goals they are\ninterested in.  One of those goals is NOT "making people sick".  Such a goal\nwoud quickly drive them out of business and for no benefit.\n \n \nWarning of what?

The funny thing is the personaly stories about reactions to MSG vary so\ngreatly. Some said that their heart beat speeded up with flush face. Some\nclaim their heart "skipped" beats once in a while.

Vida> Can one develop inner-ear problems from too much flying?  I hear\nVida> that pilots and steward/esses have a limit as to the maximum\nVida> number of flying hours -- what are these limits?  What are the\nVida> main problems associated with too many long-haul (over 4 hours)\nVida> trips?\n\nThe crew rest requirements are to prevent undue fatigue.  The cockpit\ncrew (pilot) limits are somewhat more stringent than the cabin crew\nlimits for this reason.  Crew rest requirements address amount of time\non duty plus rest time.  A tired crew is an accident-prone crew.\n\nThe only limits I know of for inner-ear problems are in military\naircraft, which are frequently unpressurized or less reliably\npressurized.  Not being able to clear the ears renders aircrew members\nDNIF (duties not involving flying) or grounded until the ears clear.\n\nFlying can accentuate problems if ears don't clear.  If you don't have\nbig pressure changes, you may not know that you've got a problem.  But\nif you zip up to 5,000 or 6,000 ft (the usual cabin altitude in an\nairliner) and then back down to sea level, you may discover a problem.\nEars don't clear readily because of allergies, colds, infections, and\nanatomical problems.

Okay Mr. Dyer, we're properly impressed with your philosophical skills and\nability to insult people. You're a wonderful speaker and an adept politician.\nHowever, I believe that all you were asked to do, was simply provide scientific\nresearch refuting the work of Olney. I don't think the original poster sought\nto start a philisophical debate. she wanted some information. Given a little\neffort one could justify that shooting oneself with a .45 before breakfast is a\nhealthy practice. But we're not particularily interested in what you can\nverbally prove/disprove or rationalize. Where's the research? Where are the\nstudies?\n\nI appoligize if this sounds flamish. I simply would like to see the thread get\nback on track. \n\n\nLone Wolf
Hello,
If people are going to do this, I really wish they would tell me first.\nI'd be happy to go over the insert (in the PDR) with them and explain\neverything.  All too many patients read the insert and panic and then\non the next visit sheepishly admit they were afraid to take the drug\nand we are starting over again at square one.  Some of them probably\ndidn't even come back for followup because they didn't want to admit\nthey wouldn't take the drug or thought I was trying to kill them or\nsomething.  What people don't understand about the inserts is that they\nreport every adverse side effect ever reported, without substantiating\nthat the drug was responsible.  The insert is a legal document to slough\nliability from the manufacturer to the physician if something was to\nhappen.  If patients want to have the most useful and reliable information\non a drug they would be so much better off getting hold of one of the\nAMA drug evaluation books or something similar that is much more scientific.\nThere are very few drugs that someone hasn't reported a death from taking.\nPatients don't realize that and don't usually appreciate the risks\nto themselves properly.  I'm sure Herman is going to "go ballistic",\nbut so be it.  Another problem is that probably most drugs have been\nreported to cause impotence.  Half the males who read that will falsely assume\nit could permanently cause them to lose sexual function and so will\nrefuse to take any drug like that.  This can be a real problem for\nPDR readers.  There needs to be some way of providing patients with\ntools geared to them that allow them to get the information they need.\nI am involved in a research project to do that, with migraine as the\ndomain.  It involves a computer system that will provide answers to questions\nabout migraine as well as the therapy prescribed for the patient.\nFor common illnesses, such as migraine and hypertension, this may help\nquite a bit.  The patient could spend as much time as needed with the\ncomputer and this would then not burden the physician.  Clearly,\nphysicians in large part fail to answer all the questions patients have,\nas is demonstrated over and over here on the net where we get asked\nthings that the patients should have found out from their physician\nbut didn't.  Why they didn't isn't always the physician's fault either.\nSometimes the patients are afraid to ask.  They won't be as afraid to\nask the system, we hope.\n-- \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGordon Banks  N3JXP      | "Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and\ngeb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon."

I experienced a sudden numbness in my left arm this morning.  Just after\nI completed my 4th set of deep squats.  Today was my weight training\nday and I was just beginning my routine.  All of a sudden at the end of\nthe 4th set my arm felt like it had gone to sleep.  It was cold, turned pale,\nand lost 60% of its strength.  The weight I used for squats wasn't that\nheavy, I was working hard but not at 100% effort.  I waited for a few \nminutes, trying to shake the arm back to life and then continued with\nchest exercises (flyes) with lighter dumbells than I normally use.  But\nI dropped the left dumbell during the first set, and experienced continued\narm weakness into the second.  So I quit training and decided not to do my\nusual hour on the ski machine either.  I'll take it easy for the rest of\nthe day.\n\nMy arm is *still* somewhat numb and significantly weaker than normal --\nmy hand still tingles a bit down to the thumb.

Interesting statements, simply because I have been told otherwise.  I'm\ncertainly not questioning Steve's claims, as for one I am not a doctor, and I\nagree that foods don't bring on the recurrence of Crohn's.  But inflammation\ncan be either mildly or DRASTICALLY enhanced due to food.\n\nHaving had one major obstruction resulting in resection (is that a good enough\ncaveat :-), I was told that a *LOW RESIDUE* diet is called for.  Basically,\nthe idea is that if there is inflammation of the gut (which may not be\nrealized by the patient), any residue in the system can be caught in the folds\nof inflammation and constantly irritate, thus exacerbating the problem.\nTherefore, anything that doesn't digest completely by the point of common\ninflammation should be avoided.  With what I've been told is typical Crohn's,\nof the terminal ileum, my diet should be low residue, consisting of:\n\nCompletely out - never again - items:\n	o corn (kernel husk doesn't digest ... most of us know this :-)\n	o popcorn (same)\n	o dried (dehydrated) fruit and fruit skins\n	o nuts (Very tough when it comes to giving up some fudge :-)\n\nDiscouraged greatly:\n	o raw vegetables (too fibrous)\n	o wheat and raw grain breads\n	o exotic lettuce (iceberg is ok since it's apparently mostly water)\n	o greens (turnip, mustard, kale, etc...)\n	o little seeds, like sesame (try getting an Arby's without it!)\n	o long grain and wild rice (husky)\n	o beans (you'll generate enough gas alone without them!)\n	o BASICALLY anything that requires heavy digestive processing\n\nI was told that the more processed the food the better! (rather ironic in this\nday and age).  The whole point is PREVENTATIVE ... you want to give your\nsystem as little chance to inflame as possible.  I was told that among the\nNUMEROUS things that were heavily discouraged (I only listed a few), to try\nthe ones I wanted and see how I felt.  If it's bad, don't do it again!\nRemember though that this was while I was in remission.  For Veggies: cook the\ndaylights out of them.  I prefer steaming ... I think it's cooks more\nthoroughly - you're mileage may vary.\n\nAs with anything else, CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR.  Don't just take my word.  But\nthis is the info I've been given, and it may be a starting point for\ndiscussion.  Good luck!\n\n-Spenser
As promised, below is a personal critique of a Pressure Point Massager \nI recently bought from the Self Care Catalog.  I am very pleased with \nthe results.  The catalog description is as follows:\n\n	The Pressure Point Massager is an aggressive physical massager \n	that actually kneads the tension out of muscles ... much like a\n	professional shiatsu masseur.  The powerful motor drives two\n	counter-rotating "thumbs" that move in one-inch orbits --\n	releasing tension in the neck, back, legs and arms.\n\n	Pressure Point Massager    A2623   $109\n\nTo order or receive a catalog, call (24 hours, 7 days) 1-800-345-3371 or\nfax at 1-800-345-4021.\n\n********\nNOTE:\nWhen I ordered the massager, the item number was different, and the price\nwas $179, not $109.  When I received it, I glanced thru the newer catalog\nenclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one.  I was  \nQUITE annoyed to see a $70 difference in price.  I called them about it,\nand the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers, although it\nlooks and works exactly the same.  He told me to go ahead and return the\nfirst one and order the cheaper one, using the price difference as a\nreason for return.  In fact, since the newer ones might take a while to\nship from the factory (I received this one in 3 days), he told me I could \nuse the one I already have until the new one arrives, then return the old \none.  VERY reasonable people.\n********\n\nI have long-term neck, shoulder and back pain (if I were a building, I \nwould be described as "structurally unsound :-) ).  I have stretches \nand exercises to do that help, but the problem never really goes away.  \nIf, for whatever reason, I do not exercise for a while (illness, not enough\ntime, lazy, etc.), the muscles become quite stiff and painful and, thus, \nmore prone to further strain.  Even with exercise, I sometimes require \nphysical therapy to get back on track, which 1st requires a doctor visit \nto get the prescription for p.t.  \n\nThe tension in my neck, if not released, eventually causes a headache\n(sometimes confused with a sinus headache) over my left eye.  When my \nphysical therapist has massaged my neck, and the sub-occipital muscles \nin particular (the 2 knobby areas near the base of the skull), the \nheadache usually eased within a day, although it hurts like hell to \nwhile it is being massaged.\n\nI ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what I was wishing\nsomeone would invent --a machine that would massage, NOT VIBRATE, my \nneck and sub-occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in \nthe past, that I could use by myself.  No doctor visit or inconvenient \np.t. appts for a week later would be needed to use it.  I could get up \nin the middle of the night and use it, if necessary.\n\nI have been using it for about a week or so now, and LOVE it.  The base\nunit is about a 14" x 9" rectangle, about 3-3/4" high, with handles on each\nside, and it plugs into an average outlet.  The two metal "thumbs" are about \n1-1/2" in diameter and protrude about 2-1/2" above the base.  The thumbs \nare covered with a gray cloth that is non-removable.  They are located more \ntoward one end, rather than centered (see figure below).  They move in \neither clockwise or counter-clockwise directions, depending on which side \nof the switch is pushed, and are very quiet.  It can be used from either\nside.  For instance, the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neck\nor the top of the neck, depending on which direction you approach it.\n\n\n                 _______________________________\n                |  __    _______________    __  |\n                | |  |  |		|  |  | |\n                | |  |  |  \^^/   \^^/  |  |  | |\n                | |  |  |   ||     ||   |  |  | |\n                | |  |  |		|  |  | |\n                | |  |  |_______________|  |  | |\n                | |__|			   |__| |\n                |_______________________________|\n\n\nFor the neck/head, the user varies the amount of pressure used by (if \nlaying down) allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and/or \nneck to rest on the thumbs.  The handles can also be used if sitting or\nstanding, applying pressure with the arms/wrists.  Since my wrists are\nalso impaired (I'm typing this over an extended period of time), and I \ndon't have someone living with me who can apply it, laying down works \nwell for me.\n\nFor my back, I sit in a high-backed kitchen chair, position the massager\nbehind me at whatever point I want massaged, and lean back lightly (or\nnot so lightly) against it.  The pressure of leaning back holds it in place.  \nIf I want to massage the entire spine, I simply move it down a few inches \nwhenever I feel like it.  For my back, this machine is far superior to use \nthan the commonly used "home-made" massager of 2 tennis balls taped together \n(with the balls, position (against a wall or door) them over the spine and \nmove the body up and down against them).  The tennis balls are better than \nnothing, but difficult to use for very long, especially if your quads are \nnot in good shape, and my long hair gets (painfully) in the way if I don't \npin it up first.  As far as I'm concerned, the easier something like this \nis to use, the more likely I'll use/do it.  If there are multiple \nconsiderations/hassles, I'm more likely to not bother with it.\n\nNot only has this machine helped with my headaches, but my range of motion \nfor my neck and back are greatly increased.  The first time I used it on my\nneck/sub-occipital muscles, however, I overdid it and pressed too hard\nagainst it, which resulted in a very tender, almost bruised area for a\nfew days.  I laid off it for about 3 days and applied ice, which helped.  \nAfter that, I was more gradual about applying pressure.  At this point, \nthe pain in the sub-occipital area is now minimal while being massaged.  \nI also learned to use VERY LIGHT pressure on my lower back, which is the \nmost vulnerable point for me.\n\nIt also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades,\nalthough, again, it took a few days of massaging (just a few minutes at\na time) to really work it out.\n\nI highly recommend this product if you have similar problems, although I\ncannot vouch for its durability (it seems pretty sturdy), since I've had\nit such a short time.  I plan to use it not only to ease tension, but also \nto loosen the muscls BEFORE exercising (and maybe after, too).  I have\nbeen ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks, so this \nwas very timely  for me.\n\nThis is the 1st product I've ordered from this company and only recently\nbecame aware of it thru a co-worker.  The catalog states they have been\nin business since 1976.  It contains quite a few health care products and,\nwhile they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalog\nproducts, they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thought\nput into what they actually do.  Definitely a step above some other ones\nI've seen such as "Dr. Leonards Health Care Catalog" or "Mature Wisdom".\nI'm only 37, but have ended up on some geriatric-type mailing lists (no\nbig surprise here :-) ).  I consider many of those products to be rip-offs, \nparticularly targeted toward the elderly, with dubious health benefits.\n\nI apologize for the length of this, but it's the kind of info _I_ would \nlike to know before ordering something thru the mail.
Summary of thread:\nA person has Crohns, raw vegetables cause problems (unspecified)\nSteve Holland replies:  patient may have mild obstruction.  Avoid things\nthat would plug her up.  Crohn's has no dietary restriction in general.\n\n\nThe feeling obout this has changed in the GI community.  The current\nfeeling\nis that inflammation is not induced by food.  There is even evidence that\npatients deprived of food have mucosal atrophy due to lack of stimulation\nof\nintestinal growth factors.  There is now interest in providing small\namounts\nof nasogastric feeding to patients on IV nutrition.  But I digress.  \nSymptoms can be drastically enhanced by food, but not inflammation.\n\n\nThe low residue diet is appropriate for you if you still have obstructions.\nAgain, it is not felt that food causes inflammation.  These foods are\navoided because they may get stuck.  I'd go ahead and have the\nfudge, though ;-)  .\n\nSpencer makes an especially good point in having an observant and\ninformed patient.  Would that many patients be able to tell what\ncauses them problems.  The digestive processing idea is changing, but\nif a food causes problems, avoid them.  Be sure that the foods are \ntested a second time to be sure the food is a real cause.  Crohn's\ncommonly causes intermittent symptoms and some patients end up with\nseverly restricted diets that take months to renormalize.\n\nThere was a good article in the CCFA newsletter recently that discussed\nthe issue of dietary restriction of fiber.  It would be worth reading\nto anyone with an interest in Crohn's.\n\nAnd, as I always say when dealing with Crohn's, as does Spencer, Good Luck!
Harumph. Getting published in these newsletters is hardly something\nto aspire to. :-)\n	I can't really argue with your logic, though I think you may be\nextrapolating a bit recklessly from what appears to be a sample size of\none. Even if what you say about this local Pittsburgh guy is true, it is\nnot logical or fair to conclude that this is true of all doctors who\ntreat Lyme disease.\n	By your logic, I could conclude that all of the physicians who\nconsult for insurance companies and make money by denying benefits to\nLyme patients are doing it for the money, rather than because they believe\nthey are encouraging good medicine. I have no idea how sincere these guys\nare, but their motives are as suspect as the physicians you excoriate for\nwhat you believe to be indiscriminate treatment.\n	I would really feel more comfortable discussing the medical issues\nin Lyme, rather than speculating as to the motives of the various parties\ninvolved.

[reply to Daniel.Prince@f129.n102.z1.calcom.socal.com (Daniel Prince]\n \n \nYes.\n \n \nIt seems to work equally well for CFS, another hint that these may be\ndifferent facets of the same underlying process.\n \n \nYes.  The benefit is usually evident within a few days of starting it.\nMost of the patients for whom it has worked well continued low-dose\namitriptyline, daily aerobic excersise, and a regular sleep schedule\n(current standard therapy).  Because of the cost (usually > $150/mo.,\ndepending on dose) and potential for significant side effects like\ncorneal injury and birth defects, I currently reserve it for those who\nfail conventional treatment.  It is important that the person\nprescribing it have some experience with it and follow the patient\nclosely.\n \n \nAs far as I know, I am the only person looking at it currently.

This is a lovely area for anecdotes, but I am sure you are on to something.\nAs a physician, I almost never get sick: usually, when something horrendous\nis going around, I either don't get it at all or get a very mild case.\nWhen I do get really sick, it is always something unusual.\n\nThis was not the situation when I was in medical school, particularly on\npediatrics. I never had younger siblings myself, and when I went on the\npediatric wards I suddenly found myself confronting all sorts of infectious\nchallenges that my body was not ready for. Pediatrics for me was three solid\nmonths of illness, and I had a temp of 104 when I took the final exam!\n\nI think what happens is that during training, and beyond, we are constantly\nexposed to new things, and we have the usual reactions to them, so that later\non, when challenged with something, it is more likely a re-exposure for us,\nso we deal with it well and get a mild illness. I don't think it is that\nthe immune system is hyped up in any way. Also, don't forget that the\nhospital flora is very different from the home, and we carry a lot of that\naround.

: A very simple question : it seems to me that the contraceptive\n: pill just prevents the ovule to nest in the vagina and forces it to\n: fall every month. But it does not prevent the fertilzation of the \n: ovule. Is it true ? If yes, is there a risk of extra-uterine\n: pregnancy, that is the development of the ovule inside the Fallopian\n: tube ?\n\nActually that is not how the pill works, but it *is* how the IUD works.\nThe oral contraceptive pill actually *prevents* ovulation from occuring\nby providing negatve feedback to the pituitary gland, and thus preventing\nthe LH surge that normally occurs at the time of ovulation.  With the IUD\nwhat happens is that fertilization may occur, but the device prevents\nimplantation within the wall of the uterus (*not* the vagina).
Surprise surprise, different people react differently to different things. One\nslightly off the subject case in point. My brother got stung by a bee. I know\nhe is allergic to bee stings, but that his reaction is severe localized\nswelling, not anaphylactic shock. I could not convince the doctors of that,\nhowever, because that's not written in their little rule book.\n\nI would not be surprised in the least to find out the SOME people have bad\nreactions to MSG, including headaches, stomachaches and even vomiting. Not that\nthe stuff is BAD or POISON and needs to be banned, but people need to be aware\nthat it can have a bad effect on SOME people.\n\nLone Wolf

A not-overly critical but still useful overview of 32\nalternative health therapies.]\n\n  ...the Russian engineer Semyon Kirlian and his wife Valentina during the\n  1950s.  Using alternating currents of high frequency to 'illuminate'\n  their subjects, they photographed them.  They found that if an object\n  was a good conductor (such as a metal) the picture showed only its\n  surface, while the pictures of poor conductors showed the inner\n  structure of the object even if it were optically opaque.  They found\n  too that these high frequency pictures could distinguish between dead\n  and living objects.  Dead ones had a constant outline whilst living ones\n  were subject to changes.  The object's life activity was also visible in\n  highly variable colour patterns.\n\n  High frequency photography has now been practised for twenty years in\n  the Soviet Union but only a few people in the West have taken it up\n  seriously.  Professor Douglas Dean in New York and Professor Philips at\n  Washington University in St Louis have produced Kirlian photographs and\n  others have been produced in Brazil, Austria and Germany.\n\n  Using Kirlian photography it is possible to show an aura around people's\n  fingers, notably around those of healers who are concentrating on\n  healing someone.  Normally, blue and white rays emanate from the fingers\n  but, when a subject becomes angry or excited, the aura turns red and\n  spotty.  The Soviets are now using Kirlian photography to diagnose\n  diseases which cannot be diagnosed by any other method.  They argue that\n  in most illnesses there is a preclinical stage during which the person\n  isn't actually ill but is about to be.  They claim to be able to\n  foretell a disease by photographing its preclinical phase.\n\n  But the most exciting phenomenon illustrated by Kirlian photography is\n  the phantom effect.  During high frequency photography of a leaf from\n  which a part had been cut, the photograph gave a complete picture of the\n  leaf with the removed part showing up faintly.  This is extremely\n  important because it backs up the experiences of psychics who can 'see'\n  the legs of amputees as if they were still there.  The important thing\n  about the Kirlian phantoms though is that the electromagnetic pattern\n  can't possibly represent a secondary phenomenon -- or the field would\n  vanish when the piece of leaf or leg vanished.  The energy grid\n  contained in a living object must therefore be far more significant than\n  the actual object itself.\n\n  [...]\n\n  Kirlian photography has shown how water mentally 'charged' by a healer\n  has a much richer energy field around it than ordinary water...\n\n\nFrom the incredulous side: [MacRobert, Alan, "Reality shopping; a\nconsumer's guide to new age hokum.", _Whole Earth Review_, Autumn 1986,\nvNON4 p4(11).

Many paranormal\n  movements can be traced back to such people -- Kirlian photography, for\n  instance.  If you pump high-voltage electricity into anything it will\n  emit glowing sparks, common knowledge to electrical workers and\n  hobbyists for a century.  It took a lone basement crank to declare that\n  the sparks represent some sort of spiritual aura.  In fact, Kirlian\n  photography was subjected to rigorous testing by physicists John O.\n  Pehek, Harry J. Kyler, and David L. Faust, who reported their findings\n  in the October 15, 1976, issue of Science.  Their conclusion: The\n  variations observed in Kirlian photographs are due solely to moisture on\n  the surface of the body and not to mysterious "auras" or even\n  necessarily to changes in mood or mental state.  Nevertheless,\n  television shows, magazines, and books (many by famous\n  parapsychologists) continue to promote Kirlian photography as proof of\n  the unknown.

has no\nmitigate\nliterature,\n\nFirst, let me offer you my condolences.  I've had kidney stones 4 times \nand I know the pain she is going through.  First, it is best that she see \na doctor.  However, every time I had kidney stones, I saw my doctor and the\nonly thing they did was to prescribe some pain killers and medication for a\nurinary tract infection.  The pain killers did nothing for me...kidney stones\nare extremely painful.  My stones were judged passable, so we just waited it\nout.  However the last one took 10 days to pass...not fun.  Anyway, if she\nabsolutely won't see a doctor, I suggest drinking lots of fluids and perhaps\nan over the counter sleeping pill.  But, I do highly suggest seeing a doctor.\nKidney stones are not something to fool around with.  She should be x-rayed \nto make sure there is not a serious problem.
I have a new doctor who gave me a prescription today for something called \nSeptra DS.  He said it may cause GI problems and I have a sensitive stomach \nto begin with.  Anybody ever taken this antibiotic.  Any good?  Suggestions \nfor avoiding an upset stomach?  Other tips?
The subject-line says it:  every time I run a fever, I get an amazing\nrosy rash over my torso and arms.  Fortunately, it doesn't itch.\n\nThe rash  always comes on the day after the\nfever breaks and no matter what the illness was:  cold, flu, whatever.\nIt started happening about four years ago after I moved to my current\ntown, although I don't know if that has anything to do with anything.\n\nSeverity and persistance of the rash seems to vary with the fever:\na severe or long-lasting fever brings a long-lasting rash.  A mild fever\nseems to bring rashes that go away faster.  \n\nAnybody know what might be causing this?  It's no more than an \nembarassment, but I'd be curious to know what's going on.  Am I carrying\nsome kind of fever-resistant bug that goes wild when fever knocks out\nits competition?

But why do you characterize this as a "flight of fancy" or a "fantasy"?\nWhile I am unfamiliar with the scientific context here, it appears obvious\nthat his speculation (for lack of a better or more neutral word) was\nat least in significant part a consequence of his knowledge of and acceptance\nof current theory coupled with his observations.  It would appear that\nsomething quite rational was going on as he attempted to fit his observation\ninto that theory (or to tailor the theory to cover the observation).  This\ndoes not seem like an example of what most would normally call a flight of\nfancy or a fantasy.\n\n\nWell, I think someone else in this thread was the first to use the word (also,\n"extra-scientific", etc.).  Nor am I prepared to give a general account of\nrationality.  In terms of examples, there is some danger of beginning to quibble\nover what a "surprising" experiment is, what counts as "surprising", etc.\nThe same may be said about "logical grounds".  My point is that quite frequently\n(perhaps even most frequently) the roots of a new theory can be traced to\npreviously existing theories (or even to previously rejected hypotheses of\nsome other theory or domain).  I would offer some rather well known examples\nsuch as Toricelli's Puy de Dome experiment done for the sake of his "sea of air"\nhypothesis.  Was this theory (and the resulting experimental test) "surprising"?\nWell, given the *prior* explanations of the phenomena involved it certainly must\nbe counted as so.  Was the theory constructed (and the experiment designed)\nout of "perfectly rational grounds"?  Well, there was a pretty successful and\nwell know theory of fluids.  The analogy to fluids by Toricelli is explicit.\nThe novelty was in thinking of air as a fluid (but this was *quite* a novelty\nat the time).  Was the theory interesting?  Yes.  Was it "new"?  Well, one\ncould argue that it was merely the extension of an existing theory to a new\ndomain, but I think this begs certain questions.  We can debate that if you\nlike.

GREAT post Martin.  Very informative, well-balanced, and humanitarian\nwithout neglecting the need for scientific rigor.\n\n\n(Cross-posted to alt.psychology.personality since some personality typing\nwill be discussed at the beginning - Note: I've set all followups to sci.med\nsince most of my comments are more sci.med oriented and I'm sure most of the\nreplies, if any, will be med-related.)\n\n\n\n\nThey are just responding in their natural way:  Hyper-Choleric Syndrome (HCS).\nOops, that is not a recognized "illness" in the psychological community,\nbetter not say that since it therefore must not, and never will, exist.  :^)\n\nActually, it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians\nwill type out as NT (for those not familiar with the Myers-Briggs system,\njust e-mail me and I'll send a summary file to you).  In the general\npopulation, NT's comprise only about 12% of the population, but among\nphysicians it is much much higher (I don't know the exact percentage -\nany help here a.p.p.er's?)\n\nOne driving characteristic of an NT, especially an NTJ, is their obvious\ncholeric behavior (driver, type A, etc.) - the extreme emotional need to\ncontrol, to lead, and/or to be the best or the most competent.  If they are\nalso extroverted, they are best described as "Field Marshalls".  This trait\nis very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want to\nlead, to strive to overcome the elements, to seek and thirst for knowledge,\nto raise the level of competency, etc.  The great successes in science and\ntechnology are in large part due to the vision (an N trait) and scientifically-\nminded approach (T trait) of the NT personality (of course, the other types\nand temperaments have their own positive contributions as well).  However,\nwhen the NT person has self-image challenges, the "dark-side" of this\npersonality type usually comes out, which should be obvious to all.\n\nA physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper their\ntemperament will be extremely business-like (lack of empathy or feeling),\nand is very compelled to have total control over their patient (the patient\nmust be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question).  I've\nknown many M.D.'s of this temperament and suffice to say I don't oblige them\nwith a followup visit, no matter how competent I think they are (and they\nusually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an\nextreme drive of theirs - to know the most, to know it all).\n\nMaybe we need more NF doctor's.  :^)\n\nEnough on this subject - let's move on to candida bloom.\n\n\n\nYou've helped me already by your post.  Of course, I believe that I have\nbeen misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from 'anal retentivitis', but being\nthe phlegmatic I am, maybe I was just a little too harsh on a few people\nmyself in past posts.  Let's all try to raise the level of this discussion\nabove the level of anal effluent.\n\n\n\nIn my well-described situation (in prior posts), I definitely was immune\nstressed.  Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinuses\nwere a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged.\nI also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end, even two weeks\nof Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial\ninfection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (won't get into the\ndetails), and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENT's made this\ndiagnosis (I did not have any cultures done, however, because of the\ndifficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed\na bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help you\nunderstand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungal\ntherapy below).\n\n\nThe first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor\nmucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without being\nconsidered 'systemic' in the classic sense?  It is sort of an inbetween\ninfection.\n\n\n\nI was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor, after\nmy blood tests, put me on 75,000 IU of vitamin A for one week only, then\ndropped it down to 25,000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also received\nzinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairly\ncomplex ways as my doctor explained (he's one of those 'evil' orthomolecular\nspecialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal,\nhe then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitamin)\nsupplement), and made sure that I maintain a 50,000 IU/day of beta carotene.\nCall me carrot face.  :^)\n\nHopefully, Elaine's doctor will take a similar, careful approach and to\nall supplements.  I'm even reevaluating some supplements I'm taking, for\nexample, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram/day, which Steve Dyer had\ngood information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-order\nimprovement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably is\nnot worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage.\n\n\n\nThough I do now believe, based on my successful therapy with Sporanox, that\nI definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in my\nsinuses, I still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies that\ndemonstrate candida "blooms" in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation\n(sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one\nweek of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this\ntime - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on\nSporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considered\nnormal).\n\nBTW, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, can't\nremember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950's\nwhich stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious)\naspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinus\ninflammation symptoms.  I'll have to dig out that reference again since it\nis relevant to this discussion.\n\n\n\nMy doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergic\nresponse to specificially Candida albicans, and I showed a strong positive.\nAnother question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this test\nis essentially useless?  And, assuming it is true that Candida can grow\npart-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds a \nthreshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy to\nCandida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membrane\nirritation due to the body's allergic response?  As I said in an earlier post,\none does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a M.D. degree or a \nPh.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis.\n\nBTW, and I'll repost this again.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, "Sinus Survival",\nhas routinely given, before anything else, Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemic\nanti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronic\nsinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in\nthe last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well over\n90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but it\ndoesn't cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast/fungus infection\nis not the primary cause, but a later complication.  He's also found that\nnystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not help.\n\nThis implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom is\naggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partway\ninto the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than by\ndirect contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again, I admit,\nlots of 'ifs', and 'implies', which doesn't please the hard-core NT who\nhas to have the double-blind study or it's a non-issue, but one has to start\nwith some plausible hypothesis/explanation, a strawman, if you will.\n\n\n\nThis brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny\nand reject any and all aspects of the 'yeast hypothesis' until the\nappropriate studies are done.  And that is if you can't observe or culture\nthe yeast "bloom" in the gut or sinus, then there's no way to diagnose or\neven recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtually\nimpossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot\nbe easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body.\n\nIt's a real Catch-22.\n\nAnother Catch-22:  Those who totally reject the 'yeast hypothesis' say that\nno studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if it's not\nup to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study which\nshould not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies should\nbe done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  However, in order to\nconvince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets,\nyou literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence to\ncompete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study\nneeded funding.  That is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even get\nfunding (as a scientist at a National Lab, I'm very aware of this for the\nsmaller funded projects).  I'm afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 other\ndoctors got together, pooled their practice's case histories and anecdotes\ninto a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would get\nnowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical results.\n\nIt is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have\n*decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to\nnoticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenable\nhypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence\nto the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they would\nalso oppose the needed studies because in their minds it's a done issue - \nexcessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, will\nnot, and cannot exist.  Period.  Kind of tough to dialog with those who hold\nsuch a viewpoint.  Kind of reminds me of Lister...\n\n\n\nAren't there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the\nsinus mucus membranes and cilia?\n\n\n\nAgain, the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast/fungus\nspecies can grow hyphae ("roots") into deep tissue, similar to mold growing\nin bread.  You can continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, but\nyou can't kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic\nanti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones such\nas Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why, as has\nbeen pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor I've been in\ne-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the long-\nterm treatment of GI tract "candidiasis".  It's like trying to weed a garden\nby cutting off what's above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come\nout again once you walk away.\n\nThe $60000 question is whether a contained candida "bloom" can partially\ngrow into tissue through the mucus membranes, causing some types of symptoms\nin susceptible people (e.g., allergy), without becoming "systemic" in the\nclassical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessive\nbloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection that\nis potentially lethal.\n\n\n\nAlso, if one is an 'anal retentive', like I've been diagnosed in a prior\npost, that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth.  ;^)\n\n\n\nAs I've said in private e-mail, there are flaws in our current medical system\nthat make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt\nalternative therapies AFTER the approved/proven/accepted therapies don't work.\nFor example, I went to three ENT's, who all said that I will just have to live\nwith my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab's failed (they did mention\nsurgery to open up the ostia, but my ostia weren't plugged and it would not\nget to the root cause of my condition).  After three months of aggressive and\nfairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring and\nequalization, vitamin C, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastly\nimproved to where I was two years ago, before my health greatly deteriorated.\nOf course, skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have\nimproved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of the\nexperience of the three ENT's I saw who said that I'd just have to "live with\nit".  I'm confident I will reach what one could call a total "cure".  The\nanti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction\nbecause of my overuse of ab's for the last four years.  (Note:  for those\nhaving sinus problems, may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention above.\nBe sure to get the revised edition.)\n\n\n\nDr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and his\nvisits to several ENT's totally floored him when they said "you'll just have\nto live with it".  He spent several years trying everything - standard and\nnon-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He now\nshares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road\nto recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take a\nsystemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of\nanti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own\npractice.  I'm sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti-\n"yeast hypothesis" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as,\n"it's worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases", to put it mildly.\nI also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating\ntheir moral obligations to help the patient.\n\nMaybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are\nconfronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the "hypothetical\nyeast overgrowth" (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast people\nhave identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenues\nhave been exhausted.  Remember, theory and practice are two different things -\nyou cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic.  If a doctor does\nsomething non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a\nthousand of his patients, shouldn't you at least sit up and take notice?\nMaybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works\ninstead of why it shouldn't work.  I'm afraid a lot of doctors have become\nso enamored with "scientific correctness" that they are ignoring the patients\nthey have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced, which\nwe don't see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point when\nyou just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approach\n(such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after having\nexhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditional\nmedical establishment was not able to help, so I did the natural thing:  I\nwent to a couple of doctor's who are (somewhat) outside this establishment,\nand as a result I have found significant relief.\n\nWould it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up\nsome kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or having\nhis license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt)\ntherapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all the\naccepted therapies are ineffective?  I'd like to hear a doctor tell me:\n"well, I've tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this\ncountry, and since they clearly don't work for you, I now have the authority\nto use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  I\ncan't promise anything, and there are some risks.  You will have to sign\nsomething saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of\nthese unproven therapies, and I'll have to register your case at the State\nBoard."  Anyway, if my ENT had suggested this to me, I would've jumped on this\npronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for either altruistic\nreasons, or for greed, is practicing these alternative therapies with much\nrisk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to the\npatient.  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine,\nand also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  It also would\nbe morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the\ncompassion of the medical community to the patient - that it's doing everything\nit can within reason to help the patient.  It is the lack of such a mechanism\nthat is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies, some of\nwhich seem to work (like my case), and others of which will never work at all\n(true quackery).\n\nI better get off my soapbox before this post reaches 500K in size.\n\n\n\nWhat dosage of B6 appears to be necessary to promote the healing and proper\nworking of the mucos memebranes?\n\n\n\nI'd like to see the role of complex carbohydrates, such as starch.\n\n\n\nBrave soul you are.  The venom on Usenet can be quite toxic unless one\ndevelops an immunity to it.  One year ago, my phlegmatic self would have\nbacked down right away from an attack of cholericitis.  But my immune\nsystem, and my computer system, have been hardened from gradual\ndesensitization.  I now kind of like being called "anal retentive" - it has\na nice ring to it.  I also was very impressed by how it just flowed into the\npost - truly classic, worthy of a blue (or maybe brown) ribbon.  I might\neven cross-post it to alt.best.of.internet.

Carl, it is not "placebo effect" if as hypothesised the \nsensory response to MSG's effect on flavor is responsible\nfor the MSG reaction.
I don't understand the assumption that because something is found to\nbe carcinogenic that "it would not be legal in the U.S.".  I think that\nnaturally occuring substances (excluding "controlled" substances) are\npretty much unregulated in terms of their use as food, food additives\nor other "consumption".  It's only when the chemists concoct (sp?) an\ningredient that it falls under FDA regulations.  Otherwise, if they \nreally looked closely they would find a reason to ban almost everything.\nHow in the world do you suppose it's legal to "consume" tobacco products\n(which probably SHOULD be banned)?
-*-----\n\nThese effects are a very real concern in conducting studies of new\ntreatments.  Researchers try to limit this kind of effect by \nperforming studies that are "blind" in various ways.  Some of these\nare:\n\n  o  The subjects of the study do not know whether they receive a \n     placebo or the test treatment, i.e., whether they are in the\n     control group or the test group.\n\n  o  Those administering the treatment do not know which subjects \n     receive a placebo or the test treatment.\n\n  o  Those evaluating individual results do not know which subjects\n     receive a placebo or the test treatment.\n\nObviously, at the point at which the data is analyzed, one has to \ndifferentiate the test group from the control group.  But the analysis\nis quasi-public: the researcher describes it and presents the data on\nwhich it is based so that others can verify it.  \n\nIt is worth noting that in biological studies where the subjects are\nanimals, such as mice, there were many cases of skewed results because\nthose who performed the study did not "blind" themselves.  It is not\nconsidered so important to make mice more ignorant than they already\nare, though it is important that in all respects except the one tested,\nthe control and test groups are treated alike.

I suspect you mean laparoscopic instead of orthoscopic.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy far the (still) best method to diagnose a hernia is old fashioned\nphysical examination.

Probably because most of them come packaged with some absurd theory\nbehind them.  E.G. homoeopathy: like cures like.  The more you dilute\nthings, the more powerful they get, even if you dilute them so much\nthere is no ingredient but water left.  Chiropractic: all illness\nstems from compressions of nerves by misaligned vertebrae.  Such\nsystems are so patently absurd, that any good they do is accidental\nand not related to the theory.  The only exception is probably herbalism,\nbecause scientists recognize the potent drugs that derive from plants\nand are always interested in seeing if they can find new plants\nthat have active and useful substances.  But that isn't what \nis meant by alternative medicine, usually.  If you get into the Qi,\naccupuntunce charts, etc, you are now back to silly theories that\nprobably have nothing to do with why accupuncture works in some cases.\n\nPerhaps another reason they are reluctant is the Rhine experience.\nRhine was a scientist who wanted to investigate the paranormal\nand his lab was filled with so much chacanery and fakery that \npeople don't want to be associated with that sort of thing.  \n-- \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGordon Banks  N3JXP      | "Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and\ngeb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon."

I agree. Adding layers of managers and bureaucrats simply eat up\nmoney that could be spent on those who actually are doing the work\nsuch as doctors and nurse, and supplies.

I'm not sure who the "original respondent" was but to\nreiterate cones respond to particular portions of the spectrum, just\nas _rods_ respond to certain parts of the visible spectrum (bluegreen\nin our case, reddish in certain amphibia), just as the hoseshoe crab\n_Limulus polyphemus_ photoreceptors respond to a certain portion of\nthe spectrum etc.  It is a common misconception to confound wavelength\nspecificity with being color sensitive, however the two are not\nsynonymous.\n	So in sum and to beat a dead horse:\n	(1) When the outputs of a cone are matched for number of\nabsorbed photons _irrespective_ of the absorbed photons wavelength,\nthe cone outputs are _indistinguishable_.\n	(2) Cones are simply detectors with different spectral\nsensitivities and are not any more "color sensitive" than are rods,\nommatidia or other photoreceptors.\n	(3) Color vision arises because outputs of receptors which\nsample different parts of the spectrum (cones in this case) are\n"processed centrally".  (The handwave is intentional)\n\n	I've worked and published research on rods and cones for over\n10 years so the adherence to the belief that cones can "detect color"\nis frustrating.

There are many organisms, viral, bacterial, and fungal, which can\ncause meningitits, and the course of these infections varies\nwidely. The causes of bacterial meningitis vary with age: in adults\npneumococcus (the same organism which causes pneumococcal pneumonia)\nis the most common cause, while in children Hemophilus influenzae\nis the most common cause.\n\nWhat you are describing is meningitis from Neisseria meningitidis,\nwhich is the second most common cause of bacterial meningitis in\nboth groups, but with lower incidence in infants. This organism\nis also called the "meningococcus", and is the source of the\ncommon epidemics of meningitis that occur and are popularized in\nthe press. Without prompt treatment (and even WITH it in some cases),\nthe organism typically causes death within a day. \n\nThis organism, feared as it is, is actually grown from the throats\nof many normal adults. It can get to the meninges by different\nways, but blood borne spread is probably the usual case. \n\nRifampin (an oral antibiotic) is often given to family and contacts\nof a case of meningococcal meningitis, by the way.\n\nSorry, but I don't have time for a more detailed reply.

Yes, there is such a thing as eye dominance, although I am not sure if\nthis dominance refers to perscription strength.\n\nAs i recall, if you selectively close your dominant eye, you will percieve\nthat the image shifts.

[From Kalat, J.W.. (1992):  _Biological Psychology_. Wadsworth Publishing Co.\nBelmont, CA.  Pg. 219.  Reproduced without permission.]\n\n\n\nDigression 6.1:  Miracle Berries and the Modification of Taste Receptors\n\nAlthough the _miracle berry_, a plant native to West Africa is practically\ntasteless, it temporarily changes the taste of other substances.  Miracle\nberries contain a protein, _miraculin_, that modifies sweet receptors in\nsuch a way that they can be stimulated by acids (Bartoshuk, Gentile, \nMoskowitz, & Meiselman, 1974).  If you ever get a chance to chew a miracle\nberry (and I do recommend it), for about the next half an hour all acids \n(which are normally sour) will taste sweet.  They will continue to taste\nsour as well.\n\nMiraculin was, for a time, commercially available in the United States as a\ndiet aid.  The idea was that dieters could coat their tongue with a miraculin\npill and then eat and drink unsweetened, slightly acidic substances.  Such\nsubstances would taste sweet without providing many calories.\n\nA colleague and I once spent an evening experimenting with miracle berries.\nWe drank straight lemon juice, sauerkraut juice, even vinegar.  All tasted\nextremely sweet.  Somehow we forgot how acidic these substances are.  We \nawoke the next day to find our mouths full of ulcers.\n\n[... continued discussion of a couple other taste-altering substances ...]\n\n\nRefs:  \n\nBartoshuk, L.M., Gentile, R.L., Moskowitz, H.R., & Meiselman, H.L.

I was part of a study a few years ago at the University of Arizona to\nsee whether cross dominant individuals (those with a particular handedness\nbut who had dominance in the opposite eye) were better hitters than\nthose with same side dominance of hand and eye.  I was picked from\nmy softball class because I was cross dominant (right hand, left eye)\nwhich put me in a small minority (and the grad student was trying to get\nan equal number of cross dominant and same side dominant people).  To\ncontrol the study, she used a pitching machine - fast pitch.  Since\nI was used to slow pitch, I didn't come close (actually I think\nI foul tipped a few) to hitting the ball.  If there were a lot of people\nlike me in her study (i.e., those who can't hit fast pitch, or are\nnot used to hitting off a machine),  I would seriously question the\nresults of that study!!  I think there have been some studies of major\nleague players (across a fairly large cross section of players) to test\nwhether eye dominance being the same or opposite side was "better" -\nbut I don't know the results.  (The woman who ran the study I was in\nsaid that there was a higher incidence of crossdominance in major\nleaguers than across the general population - but I'm not sure\nwhether I'd believe her.)

For the first 6 months, the women each day ate\n8 ounces of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus. For the second \n6 months, the women did not eat yogurt. The researchers examined the    \nwomen each month and found that incidents of colonization and infection \nwere significantly lower during the period when the women ate yogurt.   \n  The fungus Candida albicans can live in the body without doing harm.  \nIt is an overproliferation of the fungus that leads to infection. The   \nresearchers concluded that the L. acidophilus bacteria found in some    \nbrands of yogurt retard overgrowth of the fungus. Streptococcus         \nthermophilus and L. bulgaricus are the two bacteria most commonly used  \nin commercial yogurt production. Neither one appears to exert a         \nprotective effect against Candida albicans, however. Women who want to  \ntry yogurt as a preventive measure should choose a brand that lists     \nacidophilus in its contents.                                            \n--- end ---\n              \n\n                              \n===================================\n\nInfoTrac - Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92\n  THE MATERIAL CONTAINED IN Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92 IS PROVIDED\n  ONLY FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS\n  MEDICAL ADVICE OR INSTRUCTION.

In some circumstances, though, the    \norganisms proliferate, producing symptomatic infection of the mouth,    \nintestines, vagina, or skin. When the mouth or vagina are infected, the \ndisease is commonly called thrush.                                      \n  Vaginitis caused by Candida often afflicts women on birth control     \npills or antibiotics. There is itching and a white, cheesy discharge.   \nAmong narcotic addicts, Candida infections can lead to heart valve      \ninflammation.                                                           \n  Diagnosis of Candida infections is confirmed by cultures and blood    \ntests. Treatment can be with amphotericin B or orally with ketoconazole.\nThere is no evidence that Candida in the intestine of normal individuals\nleads to disease. All people at one time or another have Candida in     \ntheir intestines. Claims for any benefit from special diets or chronic  \nantifungal agents is not based on any solid evidence.                   \n--- end ---\n\n\n\n==========================\nI hope this is informative.\nLarry\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nLive From New York, It's SATURDAY NIGHT...

A person posted certain stuff to this newsgroup, which were highly\nselected quotes stripped of their context.  Here is the complete\nposting which was quoted (lacking the context of other postings in \nwhich it was made):\n\n\nProbably within 50 years, it will be possible to disassemble and\nre-assemble our bodies at the molecular level.  Not only will flawless\ncosmetic surgery be possible, but flawless cosmetic PSYCHOSURGERY.\n\nWhat will it be like to store all the prices of shelf-priced bar-coded\ngoods in your head, and catch all the errors they make in the store's\nfavor at SAFEWAY?  What will it be like to mentally edit and spell-\ncheck your responses to the questions posed by a phone caller selling\nVACATION TIME-SHARE OPTIONS?\n\nIndeed, we are today a nation at risk!  The threat is not from bad genes,\nbut bad memes!  Memes are the basic units of culture, as opposed to genes\nwhich are the units of genetics.\n\nWe stand on the brink of new meme-amplification technologies!  Harmful\nmemes which formerly were restricted in their destructive power will\nrun rampant over the countryside, laying waste to the real benefits that\nfuture technology has to offer.\n\nFor example, Jeremy Rifkin has been busy trying to whip up emotions\nagainst the new genetically engineered tomatoes under development at\nCALGENE.  This guy is inventing harmful memes, a virtual memetic Typhoid\nMary.

As usual, you are missing the whole point, Russell, because you are not\nwilling to even consider questionning your basic article of faith, which\nis that science is merely a matter of methodology and that the highest\npurpose of science is to avoid making mistakes.  \n\nThis is like saying that the most important aspect of business management\nis accurate bookkeeping.  \n\nIf science were no more than methodology and not making mistakes, it\nwould be a poor thing indeed.  What was the methodology of Darwin?  What\nwas the methodology of Einstein?  What was, for that matter, the\nmethodology of Jenner and Pasteur?  \n\n\n\n\nFirst of all, I think you are arguing against a straw man, because I\ndon't think that anyone here is arguing that quackery, pseudo-science,\nhomeopathy, chiropracty, and traditional Chinese medicine should be\naccepted as science.  I, in particular, think the basic ideas of\nhomeopathy and chiropracty seem extremely flaky.  \n\nWhat some of us do believe, however, is that some of these things\n(including some of the flaky ideas) are deserving of serious scientific\nattention.  \n\nIf in fact it were true, as you have stated above, that those who do not\nuse the currently fashionable methodology can have no idea what is\neffective and what is not, then science today would not exist.  For all\nof current science is based on the past work of scientists whose\nmethodology, by current standards, was seriously flawed.  \n\nIt is certainly true that as methodology improves, we need to re-examine\nthose results derived in the past using less perfect methodologies.  It is\nalso true that the results obtained by people today who still rely on \nthose early methodologies needs to be re-examined in a more rigorous \nfashion by those qualified to do so credibly.  \n\nBut to say that nobody who fails to do elaborate double-blind studies is\ncapable of knowing their ass from a hole in the ground and to say that no\nideas that come from outside the scientific establishment could possibly\nbe worthy of serious investigation ... this truly marks one's attitude as\ndoctrinaire, cultist.  This attitude is not compatible with a belief in\nreason.  \n\n--\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.
Ever heard of something called the placebo effect? I think Dyer is\nreacting because it looks to be yet another case of the same old\nquackery over and over again.\n\nIt true that current medical knowledge is limited, but do you realize\njust HOW MANY quacks exist eager to suck your $$$$. It's playing the\nlottery at best.\n\nIf the results you got were so clear and obvious, would you mind\ntrying a little experiment to see if it is true? It would be quite\nsimple. Have sugar pills and have real pills.  Take one set for one\nweek and the other set for another week without knowing which ones are\nthe real pills. Then at the end of the 2 weeks compare the results.\nLet's say you're wife would know which are the real ones. If what you\nare experiencing is true there should be a marked difference between\neach week. \n \njohn

Hmmm. Care to be more vague?
This will be the first of monthly postings of the newsletter of \nthe Long Island Chapter of the Transplant Recipients \nInternational Organization (TRIO).  Unfortunately, I was unable \nto post it before the date of this month's meeting.  I'm \nposting it anyway, and posting it world-wide instead of \nregional, in the hopes that some of the information may be \nuseful or illustrative.  Also, I hope it can be used as an \nexample and inspiration for the posting of other newsletters \nand data related to organ transplantation and donation.  \n\nMike\n\nTransplant Recipients\nInternational Organization\nLong Island Chapter\nP.O. Box 922\nHuntington, NY 11743-0922		 NEWSLETTER\n516/421-3258\n                                         APRIL 1993 \n                                         VOLUME IV   No. 8\n\n\nNEXT MEETING\n\n\nThe next meeting is WEDNESDAY APRIL 14 at 8 pm at the Knights \nof Columbus Emerald Manor, 517 Uniondale Avenue in Uniondale.  \nOur guest speaker will be Dr. Lewis Teperman.  Dr. Teperman \ntrained in Pittsburgh under Dr. Starzl and is now the Assistant \nDirector of the Liver Transplant Program at New York University \nMedical Center.  Dr. Teperman will discuss current trends in \ntransplantation and treatment and will answer questions.  He is \na long time friend of TRIO, surgeon to many of our members, and \nalways a gracious and delightful guest.   It is sure to be a \nvery informative, interesting and engaging evening.  Our \nhospitality committee,  Bette and Vito Suglia and Jim Spence \nwill be well prepared, and at last the weather should be \ncooperative. We hope to see a very large gathering to welcome \nDr. Teperman. \n\n          WEDNESDAY    APRIL 14  K of C   UNIONDALE\n\n\nLAST MEETING\n\nIt has been noted here before that the Long Island Chapter of \nTRIO has extraordinary power in predicting bad weather, being \nable to forecast rain, sleet and snow fully a month in advance.  \nNo TV weatherman can match us. This time we not only scored \nagain, but we were also able to disable the Long Island \nRailroad, making travel REALLY difficult.  None the less, many \nbraved the snow and we had an interesting meeting and good \nconversation.  Our scheduled speaker, Mrs. Elizabeth Linnehan, \na professional nutritionist, had a family emergency and was not \nable to attend.  She hope she will be with us in the fall to \ndiscuss diet and medications.  However,  Ms. Jennifer Friedman, \nan image consultant and sister of a liver transplant recipient \nwas kind enough to step in on very short notice.  Ms. Friedman \ngave us a lot of good advice about choosing clothes and makeup, \n(even a bit for men) to help us look well and healthy and to \nminimize some of the cosmetic effects of some of the medicine \nand drugs we take.  We are most grateful to Jennifer and thank \nher for an entertaining evening.\n\n\n\nANNUAL MEETING\n\nIn addition to welcoming Dr. Teperman, the April meeting is \nalso the Annual meeting of the Chapter.  This is the official \nnotice of the meeting as required by our By-Laws. The main \npurpose of the meeting is to review the past year, solicit \nmember views and ideas for better ways to meet their needs, and \nto elect members of the Board of Directors for the coming two \nyear term.  The nominating committee has prepared the following \nslate for the Board.\n\n         Anne (Liver Recipient) and Don Treffeisen\n         Robert (Heart Recipient) and Eulene Smith\n         Vito (Kidney Recipient) and Bette Suglia\n         Kay Grenzig (Liver Recipient)\n         Jan Schichtel (Kidney Recipient)\n         Larry Juliano (Kidney Recipient)\n         David Bekofsky (Director Public Education LITP)\n\nThose remaining on the Board for another year are:\n\n         Robert Carroll (Liver, Kidney & Pancreas Recipient)\n         Jerry (Kidney Recipient) and Jeanne Eichhorn\n         Ron (Kidney Donor) and Marie Healy\n         Peter Smith (Bone Marrow Recipient)\n         Patricia Ann Yankus (Kidney and Pancreas Recipient)\n         Walter Ruzak (Kidney Recipient)\n\nThis may seem to be a big Board, but many hands make light work \nand with our various medical uncertainties, it is good to have \nbackups for all the jobs on the Board.  Therefore, in addition \nto the slate being presented for voting, nominations will also \nbe accepted from the floor.  There is no set number of Board \nmembers and there is plenty of work. \n\nIn addition,  brief treasurer's and membership reports will be \ngiven and the floor will be open for any new business, \nsuggestions, or comments anyone would like to bring up.\n\nWe will keep the formal meeting short so that we can spend the \nmajority of the time with Dr. Teperman.\n\nFUTURE MEETINGS\n\nRemember the scheduled guests for the rest of the year.  \n\n     May  12      Dr. Peter Shaprio, Chief of Psychiatry\n                  Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center\n\n     June  9      Dr. Felix Rappaport, Director of the Stony \n                  Brook Kidney Transplant Program. \n\nPlan on being with us the second Wednesday of each month.\n\nNOTDAW\n\nThe week of April 18-24 is National Organ and Tissue Donor \nAwareness Week. NOTDAW. While we are planning news releases, \nspeaking engagements and meetings with Supervisors Gullata and \nGaffney, we have decided not to have our softball game   \nbecause of two year's experience with miserable weather. \n\nWe all can help spread the word on donor awareness, however. We \nhave found it effective to ask your pastor, or rabbi to publish \na letter or announcement in the parish bulletin, allow you to \naddress the congregation, or include mention of the gift of \nlife in his sermon.  Attached to this Newsletter is a sample \nletter and fact sheet you can use.   Thank you.\n\nDR. STARZL TO BE HONORED \n\nThe Long Island Chapter of the American Liver Foundation will \nhold its annual Auction and Dinner Dance on May 7th at the \nFountainbleu  on Jericho Turnpike in Jericho.  Dr. Thomas \nStarzl will be the honored guest.  Tickets are $50 person and \nare going fast.  If you'd like to meet Dr. Starzl,  call Anne \nTreffeisen at (516) 421-3258 for details.\n\nMEMBERSHIP NEWS \n\nCongratulations to Al Reese.  Al received his heart transplant \nin Pittsburgh after waiting 3 1/2 years.  He is home and doing \nwell after only 12 days in hospital.\n\nArthur Michaels, liver recipient, is planning to run the Boston \nMarathon in April. What fantastic proof that transplantation \nworks!  We hope the national press notices. \n     \nBob McCormack, after a persistent bout with infection, had his \ntransplanted kidney removed.  He is home now, back on dialysis \nand feeling better.  \n\nNicole Healy, kidney recipient and daughter of Ron and Marie, \nspent the past several weeks in hospital in Miami with problems \nencountered on vacation.  Marie has been with her in Florida.  \nThey are back in New York where Nicole's treatment will \ncontinue.  We wish Nicole a speedy recovery. \n\nKay Grenzig, liver recipient, is mending now after a bad fall \nthat resulted in a broken arm and a broken leg. Kay is a \ncandidate for the Board so we need her well soon.\n \nAnd best wishes to all coming out of the flu. It was a tough \nwinter for many, but the tulips are just under the snow.

I shot off a response to this last night that I've tried to cancel.  It was \nonly a few minutes later while driving home that I remembered that your \nmessage does specifically say cortical.  My first reaction had been to suggest\nthe PC12 pheochromocytoma line.  That may still be a good compromise, depending\non what you're doing.  Have you concidered using a mouse cell line from one \nof the SV40 T antigen transgenic lines?  Another alternative might be primary\ncells from bovine adrenal cortex.

The network is expected to cost between \n$75 million and $125 million but is  an essential part of the Clinton \nadministration's health reform  plan, according to the CDC and outside \nexperts.

Anthony Fauci, director of the \nU.S.  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),  said, \n"We must address the question of how to treat people as  early as we possibly \ncan with drugs that are safe enough to give  people for years and that will \nget around microbial resistance."  He said any delay would signify questions \nover safety and  resistance rather than a lack of funds.  Fauci, who co-\nauthored  one of the two papers published last week in Nature, rejects the  \nargument by one of his co-authors, Cecil Fox, that the new  discovery \nindicates that "$1 billion spent on vaccine trials" has been "a waste of time \nand money" because the trials were started  too long after the patients were \ninfected and were ended too  quickly.  John Tew of the Medical College of \nVirginia in Richmond claims that the new evidence strongly backs the argument \nfor  early treatment of HIV-infected patients.  AIDS activists  welcomed the \nnew information but said the scientific community  has been slow to understand \nthe significance of infection of the  lymph tissue.  "We've known about this \nfor five years, but we're  glad it is now in the public domain," said Jesse \nDobson of the  California-based Project Inform.  But Peter Duesberg, who  \nbelieves that AIDS is independent of HIV and is a result of drug  abuse in the \nWest, said, "We are several paradoxes away from an  explanation of AIDS--even \nif these papers are right." \n\n    ======================================================================   \n                                April 14, 1993 \n    ======================================================================   \n\n"Risk of AIDS Virus From Doctors Found to Be Minimal" Washington Post \n(04/14/93), P. A9 \n\n     The risk of HIV being transmitted from infected health-care  \nprofessionals to patients is minimal, according to new research  published in \ntoday's Journal of the American Medical Association  (JAMA).  This finding \nsupports previous conclusions by health  experts that the chance of \ncontracting HIV from a health care  worker is remote.  Three studies in the \nJAMA demonstrate that  thousands of patients were treated by two HIV-positive \nsurgeons  and dentists without becoming infected with the virus.  The  studies \nwere conducted by separate research teams in New  Hampshire, Maryland, and \nFlorida.  Each study started with an  HIV-positive doctor or dentist and \ntested all patients willing to participate.  The New Hampshire study found \nthat none of the  1,174 patients who had undergone invasive procedures by an  \nHIV-positive orthopedic surgeon contracted HIV.  In Maryland, 413 of 1,131 \npatients operated on by a breast surgery specialist at  Johns Hopkins Hospital \nwere found to be HIV-negative.

The Florida researchers, led by \nGordon  M. Dickinson of the University of Miami School of Medicine, said, \n"This study indicates that the risk for transmission of HIV from  a general \ndentist to his patients is minimal in a setting in  which universal \nprecautions are strictly observed."

A6 \n======================================================================   \n"Alternative Medicine Advocates Divided Over New NIH Research  Program" AIDS \nTreatment News (04/02/93) No. 172, P. 6  (Gilden, Dave) \n\n     The new Office of Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of \nHealth has raised questions about the NIH's commitment to an  effort that uses \nunorthodox or holistic therapeutic methods.  The OAM is a small division of \nthe NIH, with its budget only at $2  million dollars compared to more than $10 \nbillion for the NIH as  a whole.  In addition, the money for available \nresearch grants is even smaller.  About $500,000 to $600,000 total will be \navailable this year for 10 or 20 grants.  Kaiya Montaocean, of the Center  for \nNatural and Traditional Medicine in Washington, D.C., says  the OAM is afraid \nto become involved in AIDS.  "They have to look successful and there is no \neasy answer in AIDS," she said.    There is also a common perception that the \nOAM will focus on  fields the NIH establishment will find non-threatening, \nsuch as  relaxation techniques and acupuncture.  When the OAM called for  an \nadvisory committee conference of about 120 people last year,  the AIDS \ncommunity was largely missing from the meeting.  In  addition, activists' \ngeneral lack of contact with the Office has  added suspicion that the epidemic \nwill be ignored.  Jon  Greenberg, of ACT-UP/New York, said, "The OAM advisory \npanel is  composed of practitioners without real research experience.  It  \nwill take them several years to accept the nature of research."   \nNevertheless,  Dr. Leanna Standish, research director and AIDS  investigator \nat the Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine in  Seattle, said, "Here is a \nwonderful opportunity to fund AIDS  research.  It's only fair to give the \nOffice time to gel, but  it's up to the public to insist that it's much, much \nmore [than  public relations]." \n======================================================================   \n"Herpesvirus Decimates Immune-cell Soldiers" Science News (04/03/93) Vol. 143, \nNo. 14, P. 215   (Fackelmann, Kathy A.) \n\n     Scientists conducting test tube experiments have found that  herpesvirus-\n6 can attack the human immune system's natural killer cells.  This attack \ncauses the killer cells to malfunction,  diminishing an important component in \nthe immune system's fight  against diseases.  Also, the herpesvirus-6 may be a \nfactor in  immune diseases, such as AIDS.  In 1989, Paolo Lusso's research  \nfound that herpesvirus-6 attacks another white cell, the CD4  T-lymphocyte, \nwhich is the primary target of HIV.  Lusso also  found that herpesvirus-6 can \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 44\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nkill natural killer cells.   Scientists previously knew that the natural \nkiller cells of  patients infected with HIV do not work correctly.  Lusso's  \nresearch represents the first time scientists have indicated that natural \nkiller cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack,  according to Anthony \nL. Komaroff, a researcher with Harvard  Medical School.  Despite the test-tube \nfindings, scientists are  uncertain whether the same result occurs in the \nbody.  Lusso's  team also found that herpesvirus-6 produces the CD4 receptor  \nmolecule that provides access for HIV.  CD4 T-lymphocytes express this surface \nreceptor, making them vulnerable to HIV's attack.   Researchers concluded that \nherpesvirus-6 cells can exacerbate the affects of HIV. \n\n    ======================================================================   \n                                April 15, 1993 \n     ====================================================================   \n\n"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: To the Editor" Journal of the \nAmerican Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Gellert, \nGeorge and Nordenberg, Dale F.) \n\n     All health-care workers are obligated and responsible for not  only \nensuring that politicians understand the dimensions of  certain health \nproblems, but also to be committed to related  policies, write George Gellert \nand Dale F. Nordenberg of the  Orange County Health Care Agency, Santa Ana, \nCalif., and the  Emory University School of Public Health in Atlanta, Ga.,  \nrespectively.  Dr. Berkley's editorial on why American doctors  should care \nabout the AIDS epidemic beyond the United States  details several reasons for \nthe concerted interest that all  countries share in combating AIDS.  It should \nbe noted that while AIDS leads in hastening global health interdependence, it \nis not  the only illness doing so.  Diseases such as malaria and many  \nrespiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic \ndevelopment of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations.  \nBerkley mentions the enormous social and  economic impact that AIDS will have \non many developing countries, and the increased need for international \nassistance that will  result.  Berkley also cites the lack of political \naggressiveness  toward the AIDS epidemic in its first decade.  But now there \nis a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in  approach \nto international health and development in general, and  HIV/AIDS in \nparticular.  Vice President Al Gore proposes in his  book "Earth in the \nBalance" a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable \ninternational development, with programs to  promote literacy, improve child \nsurvival, and disseminate  contraceptive technology and access throughout the \ndeveloping  world.  If enacted, this change in policy could drastically  \nchange the future of worldwide health. \n====================================================================   \n"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: In Reply" Journal of the American \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 45\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nMedical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Berkley, Seth) \n\n     Every nation should tackle HIV as early and aggressively as    possible \nbefore the disease reaches an endemic state, even at a  cost of diverting less \nattention to some other illnesses, writes  Seth Berkley of the Rockefeller \nFoundation in New York, N.Y., in  reply to a letter by Drs. Gellert and \nNordenberg.  Although it is true that diseases other than AIDS, such as \nmalaria and  respiratory and intestinal illnesses, have similarly inhibited  \neconomic development in developing countries and deserve much  more attention \nthan they are getting, Berkley disagrees with the  contention that AIDS is \nreceiving too much attention.  HIV  differs from other diseases, in most \ndeveloping countries because it is continuing to spread.  For most endemic \ndiseases, the  outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another \nyear  of about the same level of needless disease and death.  But with  AIDS \nand its increasing spread, the cost of neglect, not only in  disease burden \nbut financially, is much greater.  Interventions  in the early part of a \nrampantly spreading epidemic like HIV are  highly cost-effective because each \nindividual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission.  Berkley \nsays he agrees  with Gellert and Nordenberg about the gigantic social and  \neconomic effects of AIDS and about the need for political  leadership.  But he \nconcludes that not only is assertive  political leadership needed in the \nUnited States for the AIDS  epidemic, but even more so in developing countries \nwith high  rates of HIV infection and where complacency about the epidemic  \nhas been the rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 46\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n                               AIDS/HIV Articles\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n            First HIV Vaccine Trial Begins in HIV-Infected Children\n                                H H S   N E W S\n     ********************************************************************\n                 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\n                                March 29, 1993\n\n\n        First HIV Vaccine Therapy Trial Begins In HIV-Infected Children\n\n\nThe National Institutes of Health has opened the first trial of experimental \nHIV vaccines in children who are infected with the human immunodeficiency \nvirus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS. \n\nThe trial will compare the safety of three HIV experimental vaccines in 90 \nchildren recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide. Volunteers must be HIV-\ninfected but have no symptoms of HIV disease. \n\nHHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala said this initial study can be seen as "a \nhopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of HIV-infected \nchildren who now face the certainty they will develop AIDS." \n\nAnthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and \nInfectious Diseases and of the NIH Office of AIDS Research, said the trial "is \nthe first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay \ndisease progression in children with HIV who are not yet sick."  If these \nvaccines prove to be safe, more sophisticated questions about their \ntherapeutic potential will be assessed in Phase II trials. \n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 10,000 children in \nthe United States have HIV.  By the end of the decade, the World Health \nOrganization projects 10 million children will be infected worldwide. \n\nThe study will enroll children ages 1 month to 12 years old.  NIAID, which \nfunds the AIDS Clinical Trials Group network, anticipates conducting the trial \nat nine ACTG sites around  the country and three sites participating in the \nACTG but funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human \nDevelopment. \n\nPreliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows \nthat certain vaccines can boost existing HIV-specific immune responses and \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 47\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nstimulate new ones.  It will be several years, however, before researchers \nknow how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease. \n\nThe results from the pediatric trial, known as ACTG 218, will be examined \nclosely for other reasons as well.  "This trial will provide the first insight \ninto how the immature immune system responds to candidate HIV vaccines," said \nDaniel Hoth, M.D., director of NIAID's division of AIDS.  "We need this \ninformation to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent \nHIV infection in children." \n\nIn the United States, most HIV-infected children live in poor inner-city \nareas, and more than 80 percent are minorities, mainly black or Hispanic. \n\nNearly all HIV-infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during \npregnancy  or at birth.  An infected mother in the United States has more than \na one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby.  As growing \nnumbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to HIV through injection \ndrug use or infected sexual partners, researchers expect a corresponding \nincrease in the numbers of infected children. \n\nHIV disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults.  \nThe most recent information suggests that 50 percent of infants born with HIV \ndevelop a serious AIDS-related infection by 3 to 6 years of age.  These \ninfections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of \nchildhood that can result in seizures, pneumonia, diarrhea and other symptoms \nleading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays. \n\nAt least half of the children in the trial will be 2 years of age or younger \nto enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older \nparticipants.  All volunteers must have well-documented HIV infection but no \nsymptoms of HIV disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen \nliver or spleen.  They cannot have received any anti-retroviral or immune-\nregulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study. \n\nStudy chair John S. Lambert, M.D., of the University of Rochester Medical \nSchool, and co- chair Samuel Katz, M.D., of Duke University School of \nMedicine, will coordinate the trial assisted by James McNamara, M.D., medical \nofficer in the pediatric medicine branch of NIAID's division of AIDS. \n\n"We will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children \nfor any side effects, to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or \nfevers, for example, than another," said Dr. McNamara.  "We'll also look at \nwhether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or other \nsignificant laboratory or clinical effects."   He emphasized that the small \nstudy size precludes comparing these responses or effects among the three \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 48\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nproducts. \n\nThe trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from \nrecombinant HIV proteins.  These so-called subunit vaccines, each genetically \nengineered to contain only a piece of the virus, have so far proved well-\ntolerated in ongoing trials in HIV-infected adults. \n\nOne vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of Meriden, Conn., contains gp160--a \nprotein  that gives rise to HIV's surface proteins--plus alum adjuvant.  \nAdjuvants boost specific immune responses to a vaccine.  Presently, alum is \nthe only adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by the Food and Drug \nAdministration. \n\nBoth of the other vaccines--one made by Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco \nand the other by Biocine, a joint venture of Chiron and CIBA-Geigy, in \nEmeryville, Calif.--contain the major HIV surface protein, gp120, plus \nadjuvant.  The Genentech vaccine contains alum, while the Biocine vaccine \ncontains MF59, an experimental adjuvant that has proved safe and effective in \nother Phase I vaccine trials in adults. \n\nA low dose of each product will be tested first against a placebo in 15 \nchildren.  Twelve children will be assigned at random to be immunized with the \nexperimental vaccine, and three children will be given adjuvant alone, \nconsidered the placebo.  Neither the health care workers nor the children will \nbe told what they receive. \n\nIf the low dose is well-tolerated, controlled testing of a higher dose of the \nexperimental vaccine and adjuvant placebo in another group of 15 children will \nbegin. \n\nEach child will receive six immunizations--one every four weeks for six \nmonths--and be followed-up for 24 weeks after the last immunization.  \n\nFor more information about the trial sites or eligibility for enrollment, call \nthe AIDS Clinical Trials Information Service, 1-800-TRIALS-A, from 9 a.m. to 7 \np.m., EST weekdays.

Although the \nHIV genes were active in the mice, they did not compromise the animals' \nimmunity, the researchers found.  This led them to conclude that the HIV \nitself caused the skin disease. \n\nOur findings support a growing body of evidence that HIV can cause disease \nwithout affecting the immune system, said lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of the \nNational Institute of Dental Research (NIDR).  Dr. Kopp and his colleagues \ndescribed their study in the March issue of AIDS Research and Human \nRetroviruses. \n\nDeveloping animal models of HIV infection has been difficult, since most \nanimals, including mice, cannot be infected by the virus.  To bypass this \nproblem, scientists have developed HIV-transgenic mice, which carry genes for \nHIV as well as their own genetic material. \n\nNIDR scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting HIV genes into mouse \neggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice.  The resulting litters \ncontained both normal and transgenic animals. \n\nInstitute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of HIV \ngenetic material in l988.  Those mice, however, became sick and died too soon \nafter birth to study in depth.  In the present study, the scientists used an \nincomplete copy of HIV, which allowed the animals to live longer. \n\nSome of the transgenic animals developed scaling, wart-like tumors on their \nnecks and backs.  Other transgenic mice developed thickened, crusting skin \nlesions that covered most of their bodies, resembling psoriasis in humans.  No \nskin lesions developed in their normal, non-transgenic littermates. \n\nStudies of tissue taken from the wart-like skin tumors showed that they were a \ntype of noncancerous tumor called papilloma. Although the papillomavirus can \ncause these skin lesions, laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the \nanimals. \n\nTissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the \npresence of a protein-producing molecule made by the HIV genetic material.  \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 50\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nEvidence of HIV protein production proved that the viral genes were "turned \non," or active, said Dr. Kopp. \n\nThe scientists found no evidence, however, of compromised immunity in the \nmice:  no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common \ninfections.  The fact that HIV genes were active but the animals' immune \nsystems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the \nskin lesions, Dr. Kopp said. \n\nFurther proof of HIV gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists \nexposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light.  The light increased HIV \ngenetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin.  \nPapilloma formation in response to increased HIV genetic activity proved the \ngenes were responsible for the skin condition, the scientists said.  No \nlesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the UV light. \n\nThe transgenic mice used in this study were developed at NIDR by Dr. Peter \nDickie, who is now with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious \nDiseases. \n\nCollaborating on the study with Dr. Kopp were Mr. Charles Wohlenberg, Drs. \nNickolas Dorfman, Joseph Bryant, Abner Notkins, and Paul Klotman, all of NIDR; \nDr. Stephen Katz of the National Cancer Institute; and Dr. James Rooney, \nformerly with NIDR and now with Burroughs Wellcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 51\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n               Clinical Consultation Telephone Service for AIDS\n                                H H S   N E W S\n                 ********************************************\n                 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\n\n                                 March 4, 1993\n\n\n     HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala today announced the first nationwide \nclinical consultation telephone service for doctors and other health care \nprofessionals who have questions about providing care to people with HIV \ninfection or AIDS. \n     The toll-free National HIV Telephone Consulting Service is staffed by a \nphysician, a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist. It provides information on \ndrugs, clinical trials and the latest treatment methods.  The service is \nfunded by the Health Resources and Services Administration and operates out of \nSan Francisco General Hospital. \n     Secretary Shalala said, "One goal of this project is to share expertise \nso patients get the best care.  A second goal is to get more primary health \ncare providers involved in care for people with HIV or AIDS, which reduces \ntreatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and \ncommunity social support networks.  Currently, many providers refer patients \nwith HIV or AIDS to specialists or other providers who have more experience." \n     Secretary Shalala said, "This clinical expertise should be especially \nhelpful for physicians and providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS in \ncommunities and clinical sites where HIV expertise is not readily available." \n     The telephone number for health care professionals is 1-800-933-3413, and \nit is accessible from 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST (7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST) \nMonday through Friday.  During these times, consultants will try to answer \nquestions immediately, or within an hour.  At other times, physicians and \nhealth care providers can leave an electronic message, and questions will be \nanswered as quickly as possible. \n     Health care professionals may call the service to ask any question \nrelated to providing HIV care, including the latest HIV/AIDS drug treatment \ninformation, clinical trials information, subspecialty case referral, \nliterature searches and other information.  The service is designed for health \ncare professionals rather than patients, families or others who have alternate \nsources of information or materials. \n     When a health care professional calls the new service, the call is taken \nby either a clinical pharmacist, primary care physician or family nurse \npractitioner.  All staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and \ninpatient primary care for people with HIV-related diseases.  The consultant \nasks for patient-specific information, including CD4 cell count, current \nmedications, sex, age and the patient's HIV history. \n     This national service has grown out of a 16-month local effort that \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 52\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nresponded to nearly 1,000 calls from health care providers in northern \nCalifornia.  The initial project was funded by HRSA's Bureau of Health \nProfessions, through its Community Provider AIDS Training (CPAT) project, and \nby the American Academy of Family Physicians. \n     "When providers expand their knowledge, they also improve the quality of \ncare they are able to provide to their patients," said HRSA Administrator \nRobert G. Harmon. M.D., M.P.H.  "This project will be a great resource for \nhealth care professionals and the HIV/AIDS patients they serve." \n     "This service has opened a new means of communication between health care \nprofessionals and experts on HIV care management," said HRSA's associate \nadministrator for AIDS and director of the Bureau of Health Resources \nDevelopment, G. Stephen Bowen, M.D., M.P.H.  "Providers who treat people with \nHIV or AIDS have access to the latest information on new drugs, treatment \nmethods and therapies for people with HIV or AIDS." \n     HRSA is one of eight U.S. Public Health Service agencies within HHS.  \n\n\n                      AIDS Hotline Numbers for Consumers\n\n                  CDC National AIDS Hotline -- 1-800-342-AIDS\n                  for information in Spanish - 1-800-344-SIDA\n          AIDS Clinical Trials (English & Spanish) -- 1-800-TRIALS-A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 53\n\n------------- cut here -----------------\n-- This is the last part ---------------
Recurrent Volvulus\n    -------------------\n    \n This is regarding recurrent volvulus which our little boy\n has been suffering from ever since he was an infant. He had\n a surgery when he was one year old. Another surgery had\n to be performed one year after, when he was two years old.\n He turned three this February and he is still getting\n afflicted by this illness, like having to get hospitalised\n for vomitting and accompanying stomach pain.He managed\n not having a third surgery so far.\n \n *  	One thing me and my wife noticed is that his affliction\n 	peaks around the time he was born, on nearabouts, like in\n 	March every year.  Any significance to this?\n \n *	Why does this recur? Me and my family go through severe pain\n 	when our little boy have to undergo surgery. Why does surgery\n 	not rectify the situation? \n \n *	Also, which hospital in US or Canada specialize in this malady?\n \n *	What will be a good book explaining this disease in detail?\n \n *	Will keeping a particular diet keep down the probability of \n 	recurrence?\n \n *	As time goes on, will the probability of recurrence go down\n 	considering he is getting stronger and healthier and probably\n 	less prone to attacks? Or is this assumption wrong?\n \n *	Any help throwing light on these queries will be highly appreciated.\n 	Thanks very much!

I recently attended an allery seminar.  Steroid Nasal sprays were \ndiscussed.  Afterward on a one-on-one basis, I asked the speaker what if \nnone of the Vancanese, Beconase, Nasalide, Nasalcort, or Nasalchrom work \nnor do any oral decongestants work.  She replied that she saw an article on \nVasomotor Rhinitis.  That this is not an allergic reaction and that nothing \nother than the Afrin's and such would work.  (Which in my case is true).\n\nI want to find out as much as possible about this, since I am going to see \nmy allergist in May and want to be armed to the hilt with information; \nsince nothing he has done with me has helped me at all and I have had no \nrelief for 14 months.
Probably within 50 years, a new type of eugenics will be possible.\nMaybe even sooner.  We are now mapping the human genome.  We will\nthen start to work on manipulation of that genome.

You can also swab the inside of your nose with Bacitracin using a\nQ tip. Bacitracin is an antibiotic that can be bought OTC as an\nointment in a tube. The doctor I listen to on the radio says to apply\nit for 30 days, while you are taking other antibiotics by mouth.
In order to excitotoxin effects of MSG, MSG that in blood must go through \nblood-brain barrier that I am not sure MSG can go through or not. In normal condition, the concentration of glutamate in the cerebrospinal fluid is about \n2 uM that is high enough to activate one type of glutamate receptor-the NMDA\nreceptor. But the question is Neuron and glial cell in the brain have a lots of transport to get glutamate into Neuron or glial. So no one know exact concentration of glutamate is around neurons.
I may not be the world's greatest expert on chiggers (a type of\nmite indigenous to the south), but I certainly have spent a lot\nof time contemplating the little buggers over the past six years\n(since we moved to N.C.).  Here are some observations gained from\npainful experience:\n\n  1. Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person.\n     Some people get tiny red bites.  Others (like me) are more\n     sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs.\n\n  2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving.  I swear\n     that these things will itch for months.\n\n  3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers.  I think most of\n     it is fiction.  I have tried to do research on the critters,\n     since they have such an effect on me.  The only book I could\n     find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC's special\n     collections library.  I have not yet gone through what is\n     required to get it.\n\n  4. Based on my experience and that of my family members, the old\n     folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn't work.  I recall\n     reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers\n     burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.  I\n     think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some\n     sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation.\n\n  5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well.\n     A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally\n     applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start.  There is\n     another preparation called "Chig Away" that is a combination of\n     sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was\n     prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  In\n     the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get\n     up on weekends since I literally can't go outside where we\n     live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They\n     apparently don't like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur\n     as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.)\n\n  6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget\n     the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatment\n     that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone\n     creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine\n     (relieves the itch).  I won't tell you all the things I've tried.\n     Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this\n     counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think\n     it gains nothing).\n\n  7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved\n     by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery\n     as well.\n\nDoctors seem not to care much about chiggers.  The urban and suburban\ndoctors apparently don't encounter them much.  And the rural doctors\nseem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure.  I\nsuspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers\nwould make a *lot* of money.
Why don't you just look it up in the Merk? Or check out the medical dictionary\ncite which a doctor mentioned earlier in this thread?\n\n\n\nAmong others, see Olney's  "Excitotoxic Food Aditives - Relevance of\nAnimal Studies to Human Safety" (1982) Neurobehav. Toxicol. Teratol.\nvol 6: 455-462.\n\nI'm sure PETA would love to hear your arguments.\n\n\nWhose talking about "food science"? What is this comment supposed to\nmean? *Neurotoxicology and Tratology*, *Brain Research*, *Nature*,\n*Progress in Brain Research*: all fine food science journals. ;-)\n\n\nThen you would know that Olney himself has casually  referred to\n"Chinese Restaurant Syndrome" in a few articles. Why don't *you* point\nus to some studies? Maybe then this exchange could be productive.\n\n\nThey're unable to metabolise it.\n\n\nWho said anything about 'received wisdom'? There is no question that\norally administered doses of MSG are capable of destroying nearly all\nneurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the median\neminence. These areas are responsible for the production of\nhormones critical to normal neuroendocrine function and the normal\ndevelopment of the vertabrate organism. Humans are vertebrates. Now\nwhat, pray tell, do you think will happen when the area of the brain\nnecessary for the normal rhythm of gonadotropin release is missing?\nAre you trying to say that humans have no need of their pituitary,\nANH, and ME, of that part of the brain that is responsible for\ncontrolling the realease (albeit indirectly) of estradiol and testosterone? \n\nHow do you expect anyone to do the studies on this? It's unethical to\n"sacrifice" humans to check out what effects chronic, acute, etc doses\nof these compounds are having on the brain tissue in humans.  The food\nindustry knows this. That's why the animal model is used in medicine\nand psych.  If you're talking about straight sensitivity, it would be\nuseful to define the term.  There are plenty of studies on\npsychoneuroimmunology showing the link between attitude and\nphysiology.\n\nI suspect we may be arguing about separate things; *only* adult sensitivities\n(You), and late-occuring sequelae of childhood ingestion and its\nimplication for adults (me).  Certainly\nthe doses for excitotoxicity in adults are considerably larger than\nfor the young, but the additivity of Glu and Asp, and their copious\nand increased presence in modern processed foods (jointly), and their\nhidden presence in HVP, necessitates extreme caution. Why would anyone\nwant to eat compounds which have been shown to markedly perturb the\nendocrine system in adults?  The main point is *blood levels*\nattained, and oral doses would likely have to be greater than SC. \n\n\nOlney's work provides a putative causal mechanism for some\nsensitivities. Terry, Epelbaum and Martin have shown that orally\nadministered MSG causes changes in normal gonadotropic hormone\nfluctutations in adults. Glu also was found to induce immediate and persistant\nsupression of rhythmic GH secretion, and to induce rapid and transient\nrelease of prolactin in adults chronically exposed to MSG. GH is\nresponsible not only for control of growth during development, but\nalso converts glycogen into glucose. Could this be the cause of\nheadaches? I don't know.
My family doctor and the physiotherapist (PT) she sent me to agree that the\npain in my left shoulder is bursitis. I have an appointment with an orthpod\n(I love that, it's short for 'orthopedic surgeon, apparently) but while I'm\nwaiting the PT is treating me.\n\nShe's using hot packs, ultrasound, and lasers, but there's no improvement\nyet. In fact, I almost suspect it's getting worse.\n\nMy real question is about the laser treatment. I can't easily imagine what\nthe physical effect that could have on a deep tissue problem. Can anyone\nshed some light (so to speak) on the matter?
I don't mean to be disrespectful to your concerns, but it seems to me \nthat you're getting all wound up in a non-issue.  \n\nAs many knowledgeable people have pointed out, msg is a naturally \noccurring substance in a lot, if not most, foods.  When food \nmanufacturers add it to a preparation, they do so because it's a \nknown flavor enhancer. \n\nYour wife's theory, that MSG is added to food to stimulate appetite, \nmay well be true.  But I don't believe it's ALWAYS the reason it's \nadded.  People are (largely, for the most part) in charge of their \nown appetites. \n\nYou don't know much about cats, do you? \n\nCats will Take Advantage of You.  Resign yourself:  you will never  \nunderstand a cat.  Their tastes are whimsical.  \n\nI also suspect, though it's been a while since I've checked ingredients \non commercial cat food, that there are much more stringent requirements \non pet food additives than human.  \n\nSee, the FDA has this stupid idea that human beings have the intelligence \nto look out after their own interests.
[...]\n\n   In the September 1992 issue of THE TUFTS UNIVERSITY DIET AND NUTRITION\n   LETTER, there is a three page article about artificial sweeteners.  What\n   follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with Nutrasweet.\n\n   [Reproduced without permission]\n\n	   The controversy [over aspartame] began six years ago in England,\n	where a group of researchers found that aspartame, marketed under\n	the tradename Nutrasweet, appears to stimulate appetite and,\n	presumably, the eating of more calories in the long run than if\n	a person simply consumed sugar.  When researchers asked a group\n	of 95 people to drink plain water, aspartame-sweetened water, and\n	sugared water, they said that overall they felt hungriest after\n	drinking the artificially sweetened beverage.\n	   The study received widespread media attention and stirred a\n	good deal of concern among the artificial-sweetener-using public.\n	However, its results were questionable at best, since the researchers\n	did not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite did\n	actually translate into an increase in eating.  The two do not\n	necessarily go hand in hand.\n	   In the years that followed, more than a dozen studies examining\n	the effect of aspartame on appetite -- and eating -- were conducted.\n	And after reviewing every one of them, the director of the\n	Laboratory of the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Johns Hopkins\n	University, Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., concluded that consuming aspartame-\n	sweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase in\n	the amount of food eaten afterward.\n\n	   One artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causing\n	cancer is aspartame.  But it most certainly has been blamed for a\n	host of other ills.  Since its introduction in 1981, the government\n	has received thousands of complaints accusing it of causing\n	everything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety.\n	Still, years of careful scientific study conducted both before and\n	after the sweetener's entering the market have failed to confirm\n	that it can bring about adverse health effects.  That's why the\n	Centers for Disease Control (the government agency charged with\n	monitoring public health), the American Medical Association's\n	Council on Scientific Affairs, and the Food and Drug Administration\n	have given aspartame, one of the most studied food additives, a\n	clean bill of health.\n	   Granted, the FDA has set forth an "acceptable daily intake" of\n	50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight.  To exceed\n	the limit, however, a 120-pound (55 kg.) woman would have to take\n	in 2,750 milligrams of aspartame -- the amount in 15 cans of\n	aspartame-sweetened soda pop, 14 cups of gelatin, 22 cups of yogurt,\n	or 55 six-ounce servings of aspartame-containing hot cocoa,...\n	A 175-pound (80 kg.) man would have to consume some 4,000 milligrams\n	of the sweetener -- the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cups\n	of yogurt -- to go over the limit.  [chart with aspartame content\n	of selected foods omitted]\n	   Only one small group of people must be certain to stay away\n	from aspartame: those born with a rare metabolic disorder called\n	phenylketonuria, or PKU.  The estimated one person in every 12,000\n	to 15,000 who has it is unable to properly metabolize an essential\n	amino acid in aspartame called phenylalanine.  Once a child\n	consumes it, it builds up in the body and can ultimately cause\n	such severe problems as mental retardation.  To help people with\n	PKU avoid the substance, labels on cans of soda pop and other\n	aspartame-sweetened foods must carry the warning "Phenylketonurics:\n	Contains Phenylalanine."
All your friend really has to do is find a Registered Dietician(RD).  While \nmost work in hospitals and clinics, many major cities will have RD's who \nare in "private practice" so to speak.  Many physicans will refer their \npatients with Crohn's disease to RD's for dietary help.  If you can get \nyour friend's physician to make a referral, medical insurance should pay for \nthe RD's services just like the services of a physical therapist.  The \nbetter medical insurance plans will cover this but even if your friend's \nplan doesn't, it would be well worth the cost to get on a good diet to \ncontrol the intestinal discomfort and help the intestinal lining heal.\nCrohn's disease is an inflammatory disease of the intestinal lining and \nlipoxygenase inhibitors may help by decreasing leukotriene formation but \nI'm not aware of tea or turmeric containing lipoxygenase inhibitors.  For \nbad inflammation, steroids are used but for a mild case, the side effects \nare not worth the small benefit gained by steroid use.  Upjohn is developing \na new lipoxygenase inhibitor that should greatly help deal with \ninflammatory diseases but it's not available yet.
I have a long sighted eye and a short sighted eye. My right eye tends\nto cut out when I look at distant things, my left eye when I am close\nup.  I had specs to balance things up a bit but could do without them.\nI thought that, one way or another, I would always be able to see\nclearly.  Unfortunately middle age is rearing its ugly head and I can\nno longer see close up objects clearly.  Maybe it's just that my arms\nare getting shorter :-)
When were you in Britain?, my information is different.\n\nFrom Miranda Castro, _The Complete Homeopathy Handbook_,\nISBN 0-312-06320-2, oringinally published in Britain in 1990.
Well, yes.  That was a part of my point.  Aspirin has its problems, but\nin some situations it is useful.  Ditto stuff like licorice root.  Taking\nanything as a drug for theraputic purposes implicitly carries the idea\nof taking a dose where the benefits are not exceeded by any unwanted,\nadditional effects.  Taking any drug when the potential ill-effects are\nnot known is a risk assumed by the parties involved, and it may be that\nin a given situation the risk is worthwhile.\n   Like Prozac, for instance; Prozac has been shown to be theraputic in\nsome cases where the tri-cyclics fail.  But Prozac hasn't been in use\nthat long, and it really isn't clear what if any effects it may have\nwhen taken over long periods of time, even though it has been tested\nby present day standards.  Should Prozac be taken off the market because\nlong-term effects, if any, are not known?  IMHO, i'd say no.\n\neuclid
I've had PRK.\n\nI would suggest asking a doctor about contacts. Mine said yes to\ncontacts. I think the scars from RK would preclude contacts.\n\n\nNo. RK makes radial cuts around the circumference of the cornea, up to\n8 I think, and these change the curvature of the cornea through stress\nchages. PRK vaporizes (burns) away a thin layer from the front of the\ncornea making the optical axis of the eye shorter. The laser doesn't\ncut in PRK, it vaporizes. In RK, the eye is cut into.\n\n\nI find my vision is more clear for some things, and less clear for\nothers, only at night. I notice a definite haloing at night in the\ndarkness when I look at automobile headlamps, though this is not\nsomething I spend inordinate amounts of time doing. For ordinary\nthings, my vision, in particular having a fully-operating peripheral\nvision, is clearer than with glasses, or contacts.
That would be a very expensive toxin indeed!
No, that's not how it works.\n\n\nThis may be through a different mechanism.\n\n\nTenderizing beef involves sprinking or marinading it in papain, an enzyme.\n"Meat tenderizer" packets might contain papain and MSG and seasonings, but\nMSG doesn't act as a tenderizer.
And has been rather thoroughly demolished as myth by Robert Scott Root-\nBernstein.  See his book, "Discovering".  Ring structures for benzene\nhad been proposed before Kekule', after him, and at the same time as him.\nThe current models do not resemble Kekule's.  Many of the predecessors\nof Kekule's structure resemble the modern model more.\n\nI don't think "extra-scientific" is a very useful phrase in a discussion\nof the boundaries of science, except as a proposed definiens.  Extra-rational\nis a better phrase.  In fact, there are quite a number of well-known cases\nof extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction.\n\nFor example, Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of\nenantiomers (the origin of stereochemistry) partly because he liked a\nfriend's crank theory of chemical action.  The friend was wrong, but\nPasteur's discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), looking\nat the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he\nlacked Pasteur's motivation to find something that distinguished racemic\nacid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid.\n\nAgain, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers\n(tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because\nhe was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebooks\ncontained fantasies of becoming the "Newton of mirror-image life," which\nhe never admitted publically.\n\nPerhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery\nstarted this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile\nand Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths' discoveries in mice.\nMost of Griffiths' critics were French, which decided the issue for the\nstudent.  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths' work in vitro, which the\nstudent eventually did, whereupon Avery was convinced and started the\nresearch program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery\n(Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, JEM 1944).
I had allergy shots for about four years starting as a sophomore in high\nschool.  Before that, I used to get bloody noses, nighttime asthma attacks,\nand eyes so itchy I couldn't get to sleep.  After about 6 months on the\nshots, most of those symptoms were gone, and they haven't come back.  I\nstopped getting the shots (due more to laziness than planning) in college.\nMy allergies got a little worse after that, but are still nowhere near as\nbad as they used to be.  So yes, the shots do work.
No one else seems to know, so I'll post this.\n\nThis topic came up on sci.physics.fusion shortly after the cold-fusion\nflap started.  As I recall, its been done to some experimental mice.\nThey showed various ill effects and eventually died.  The reason is\nthat deuterium does not have exactly the same reaction rates as\nhydrogen due to its extra mass (which causes lower velocity, Boltzman\nconstant, mumble).  This throws various bits of body biochemistry out\nof kilter, and you get sick and die.\n\nI've never heard of anyone being poisened this way, in or out of real\nlife.  The process takes quite a while.  If anyone wants to write this\nbook, I would imagine you would have to:\n\n1: Replace a significant fraction of the water in the body with heavy\n   water.\n\n2: Wait while normal breakdown and repair processes cause other\n   molecules in the body to be synthesised using the deuterium.\n\nDuring this process the victim would gradually deteriorate and\neventually die, but I imagine it would take weeks during which the\npoisoner would have to ensure that a significant proportion of the\nwater the victim ingested was heavy.\n\nYou would get such a mess of symptoms that the doctors would be both\nalarmed and confused.  Why should every organ in the body suddenly\nbegin to deteriorate?  If you can figure out how the poisoner gets the\nheavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a real\nstory here.\n\nCome to think of it, <2> would continue even after the heavy water was\nno longer being ingested, so hospitalisation might be too late.\n\nThe most detectable effect would be that the victim's body fluids\nwould literally be "heavy".  Water has a molecular weight of 18 and\nheavy water has a MW of 20.  Thus the victim's weight will increase by\nabout 1% for every 10% of body water replaced by heavy water.  Maybe\nthe detection occurs because some pathologist in the lab notices that\nthe victim's urine is strangely dense.  Is there any medical test\ninvolving the specific gravity of a body fluid?\n\nPaul.

I do not know a lot about this, except from seeing one patient with\n"Kartagener's syndrome", which is a form of immotile cilia syndrome\nin which there is situs inversus, bronchiectasis, and chronic\ninfections. "Situs inversus" means that organs are on the wrong\nside of the body, and can be complete or partial. It is interesting\nmedically because the normal location of organs is caused in part\nby the "normal" rotation associated with ciliary motion, so that in\nabsence of this, laterality can be "random." People with situs\ninversus are quite popular at medical schools, because of their\nrarity, and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when they\ncan't find the patient's heart sounds (because they're on the wrong\nside). \n\nAccording to Harrison's, immotile cilia syndrom is an autosomal\nrecessive, which should imply that on average one child in four\nin a family would be affected. But there may be much more current\ninformation on this, and as usual in medicine, we may be talking\nabout more than one conditiion. I would suggest that you ask your\npediatrician about contacting a medical geneticics specialist, of\nwhich there is probably one at NCSU.

Whether a scientific idea comes while one is staring out the window, or\ndreaming, or having a fantasy,  or watching an apple fall (Newton), or\nsitting in a bath (Archimedes) ... it is ultimately the result of a lot of\nintense scientific thinking done beforehand.  Letting one's mind roam\nfreely and giving rein to one's intuition can be a useful way of coming\nup with new ideas, but only when one has done a lot of rational analysis\nof the problem first.  \n\nScientific intuition is not something one is born with.  It is something\nthat one learns.  Maybe we don't understand completely how it is learned,\nbut training in systematic scientific thinking is certainly one of the \nkey elements in developing it.  \n\nInformal exploration is also often an important element in finding new\nscientific ideas.  One thinks, for instance, of Darwin's naturalistic\nstudies in the Galapagos islands, which led him to the ideas for the \ntheory of evolution.  \n\nThis is why I am offended by a definition of science that emphasizes\nempirical verification and does not recognize thinking and informal\nexploration as important scientific work.  I agree that mere speculation\ndoes not deserve to be called science.  I also think that mere empirical\nstudies not directed by good scientific thinking are at best a very\npoor kind of science.  \n\n\nI don't think that science should be defined in a way that some of the\nactivities that lead to really important science --- namely thinking and\ninformal exploration --- are not recognized as scientific work.  \n\n--\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.

I'll probably get flamed for this, but when I was a kid we would go to\nmy uncles cabin on Middle Bass Island on Lake Erie. We always came home\nwith a nasty case of jiggers (large red bumps where the buggers had\nburrowed into the skin). My mother would paint the bumps with clear\nfinger nail polish. This was repeated daily for about a week or so. The\napplication of the polish is supposed to suffocate them as it seals of\nthe skin. All I can say is it worked for us. One word of caution\nthough. Putting finger nail polish on a jigger bite stings like hell.\n\n(If I do get flamed for this just put jam in my pockets and call me\ntoast.:)

The answer to your first question is rather difficult to answer without\ndoing a lot of autopsies.  The second question is something that's been\nknown for some time.  It appears that within about 15 years of quitting\nsmoking a person's risk for developing lung cancer drops to that of the\nperson who never smoked (assuming you do not get lung cancer in the\ninterim!).  The risk to someone who smoked the equivalent of a pack per\nday for 40 years is around 20 times as high as a non-smoker.  Still\nrather low overall, but significant.  Personally, I'd be more concerned\nabout heart disease secondary to smoking -- it's much more common, and\neven a small increase in risk is significant there.

If you could not tell which one had MSG, why restaurants bother to\nuse it at all? \n\nIf you can taste the difference, psychological reaction might play a role.\n\nThe fact is, MSG is part of natural substance.

---\n\n	Then let me ask you for a "workable" solution.  We have a name\nhere that implies certain things to many people.  Rather than trying\nto educate each and every person that comes to the group -- is there\nsome "name" that would imply what this group was originally\nintended for?  \n\n	My dad was a lawyer -- as such I grew up with being a stickler\nfor "meaning".  In my "reality", psychoactives *technically* could \nrange from caffeine to datura to the drugs you mention to more\nstandard recreational drugs.  In practice I had hoped to see it\nlimited to those that were above some psychoactive level -- like\nsome of the drugs you mention, but also possibly including *some*\nrecreational drugs -- but with conversation limited to their psychoactive \neffects -- the recent query about "bong water", I thought was a bit\noff topic -- so I just hit "k".\n\n	But back to the original question -- what is a workable solution --\nwhat is a workable name that would imply the topic you with to\ndiscuss?  It sounds like there should be a alt.smartdrugs, or something\nsimilar -- I don't feel psychoactives would generally be used to\ndescribe alot of those drugs.

I know that there is MSG sensitivity.  When I eat foods with MSG I get\nvery thirsty and my hands swell and get a terrible itchy rash. I first\nexperienced this problem when I worked close to Chinatown and ate Chinese\nfood almost everyday for lunch.  Now I can't tolerate MSG at all.  I can\nnotice immediately when I have eaten any.  I try to avoid MSG completely.\n\nInteresting fact though is that all three of my children started experiencing\nthe exact same rash on their hands.  I couldn't understand why because I\ndon't MSG in cooking and we ask for no MSG when we do eat Chinese (I still\nlove it).  After some investigation I knew that Oodles of Noodles where\none of their favorite foods.  One of the main ingredients in the flavor\npackets is MSG.  Now I look at all labels.  You would be surprised at\nplaces you find MSG.
Hmmm.  The last time I got stung by a bee I experienced the same reaction\nthe first poster's brother did.  We went off to the doctor to see if I\nshould worry about the fact that my foot was now about 3 times it's normal\nsize.  (And itched!!!  Ow!)  He basically said I shouldn't this time, but\nthat bee sting allergy was not something you tended to get aclimatized to,\nbut were something that each time got progressively worse generally and that\nnext time could be the time I go into anaphylactic shock.  Admittedly this\nwas many years ago when I was young.  Since then I just make sure I don't\nget stung.  I also should carry a bee sting kit with me, but I don't.  \n\nThis isn't scientific or proof, but this would lead me to believe it's not a\ndifferent reaction, just a different degree of reaction.  Allergies work\nthat way.  People have various reactions.  Sort of like diabetes, some\npeople can get by with just monitoring their diet, others have to monitor\ntheir diet and use insulin sometimes while others have to watch their diet\nlike a hawk and use insulin regularly.  \n\nI think MSG is probably similar...some people have allergic reactions to\nit.  Some people are allergic to fermented things and can't use soy\nsauce...but the chinese have been using it for centuries... that doesn't\nnecessarily mean that it's safe for everyone.

I don't think it\nis a reaction to sugar or junk food per se since Kathryn has never shown\nany signs of hyperactivity or changes in behavior in response to food.\nShe has always been very calm and dare I say, a neat, smart kid.\n\nThe fact that this happened while eating two sugar coated cereals made\nby Kellog's makes me think she might be having an allergic reaction to\nsomething in the coating or the cereals.

I need advice with a situation which occurred between me and a physican\nwhich upset me.  I saw this doctor for a problem with recurring pain.\nHe suggested medication and a course of treatment, and told me that I\nneed to call him 7 days after I begin the medication so that he may\nmonitor its effectiveness, as well as my general health.\n\nI did exactly as he asked, and made the call (reaching his secretary).\nI explained to her that I was following up at the doctor's request,\nand that I was worried because the pain episodes were becoming more\nfrequent and the medication did not seem effective.\n\nThe doctor called me back, and his first words were, "Whatever you want,\nyou'd better make it quick.  I'm very busy and don't have time to chit-\nchat with you!"  I told him I was simply following his instructions to\ncall on the 7th day to status him, and that I was feeling worse.  I \nthen asked if perhaps there was a better time for us to talk when he\nhad more time.  He responded, "Just spit it out now because no time is\na good time."  (Said in a raised voice.)  I started to feel upset and\ntried to explain quickly what was going on with my condition but my\nnervousness interfered with my choice of words and I kind of stuttered\nand then said "well, never mind" and he said he'll talk to various\ncolleagues about other medications and he'll call me some other time.\n\nThis doctor called me that evening and said because I didn't express\nmyself well, he was confused about what I wanted.  At this point I\nwas pretty upset and I told him (in an amazingly polite voice considering\nhow angry I felt) that his earlier manner had hurt my feelings.  He told\nme that he just doesn't have time to "rap with patients" and thought\nthat was what I wanted.  I told him that to assume I was calling to\n"rap" was insulting, and said again that I was just following through\non his orders.  He responded that he resented the implication that he \nfelt I was making that he was not interested in learning about what his\npatients have to say about their condition status.  He then gave me\nthis apology: "I am sorry that there was a miscommunication and you\nmistakenly thought I was insulting.  I am not trying to insult you\nbut I am not that knowledgeable about pain, and I don't have a lot of\ntime to deal with that."  He then told me to call him the next day\nfor further instructions on how do deal with my pain and medication.\n\nI am still upset and have not yet called.\n\nMy questions: (1) Should I continue to have this doctor manage my care?\n(2) Since I am in pain off and on, I realize that this may cause me to\nbe more anxietous so am I perhaps over-reacting or overly sensitive?\nIf this doctor refers me to his colleague who knows more about the type\nof pain I have, he still wants me to status him on my condition but\nnow I am afraid to call him.

Living things maintain small electric fields to (1) enhance certain\nchemical reactions, (2) promote communication of states with in a cell,\n(3) communicate between cells (of which the nervous system is a specialized\nexample), and perhaps other uses.  These electric fields change with location\nand time in a large organism.  Special photographic techniques such as applying\nexternal fields in Kirillian photography interact with these fields or the resistances\ncaused by these fields to make interesting pictures. Perhaps such pictures will\nbe diagonistic of disease problems in organisms when better understood. Perhaps not.\n\nStudying the overall electric activity of biological systems is several hundred\nyears old, but not a popular activity.  Perhaps, except in the case of a few\ntissues like nerves and the electric senses of fishes, it is hard to reduce the\ninvestigation into small pieces that can be clearly analyzed.  There are some\nhints that manipulating electric fields is a useful therapy such as speeding\nthe healing of broken bones, but not understood why.

A friend has the following symptoms which have occurred periodically\nevery few months for the last 3 years.  An episode begins with extreme\ntiredness followed by:\n\n	1. traveling joint pains and stiffness affecting mostly the elbows,\n	knees, and hips.\n	2. generalized muscle pains\n	3. tinnitus and a feeling of pressure in her ears\n	4. severe sweating occuring both at night and during the day\n	5. hemorrhaging in both eyes.  Her opthamologist calls it peripheral\n   retinal hemorhages and says it looks similar to diabetic retinopathy.  (She\n        isn't diabetic--they checked.\n	6. distorted color vision and distorted vision in general (telephone\n	   poles do not appear to be straight)\n	7. loss of peripheral vision.\n 	\n	Many tests have been run and all are normal except for something \ncalled unidentified bright objects found on a MRI of her brain.  The only\nthing that seems to alleviate one of these episodes is prednisone.  At\ntimes she had been on 60 mg per day.  Whenever she gets down to 10-15 mg\nthe symptoms become acute again.
One should be aware that foreign doctors admitted for training\nare ineligible to apply for resident alien status.  In order\nto get the green card they have to return to their country and\napply at the embassy there.  Of course, many somehow get around\nthis problem.  Often it is by agreeing to practice in a town\nwith a need and then the congressman from that district tacks\na rider onto a bill saying "Dr. X will be allowed to have permanent\nresidency in the US."  A lot of bills in congress have such riders\nattached to them.  Marrying a US citizen is the most common, although\nnow they are even cracking down on that and trying to tell US\ncitizens they must follow their spouse back to the Phillipines, or\nwhereever.\n\n\n\n-- \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGordon Banks  N3JXP      | "Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and\ngeb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon."
What resources and services are available on Internet/BITNET which\nwould be of interest to hospitals and other medical care providers?\nI'm interested in anything relelvant, including institutions and\nbusinesses of interest to the medical profession on Internet,\nspecial services such as online access to libraries or diagnostic\ninformation, etc. etc.
Be sure to say "chronic" dizziness, not just dizziness.  Most\npatients with acute or subacute dizziness will get better.\nThe vertiginous spells of Meniere's will also eventually go\naway, however, the patient is left with a deaf ear.\n\n\n\nThis may have helped you, but I'm not sure it is good general\nadvice.  The odds that you are going to find some miracle with\nyour own research that is secret or hidden from general knowledge\nfor this or any other disease are slim.  When good answers to these\nproblems are found, it is usually in all the newspapers.  Until\nthen, spending a great deal of time and energy on the medical\nproblem may divert that energy from more productive things\nin life.  A limited amount should be spent to assure yourself\nthat your doctor gave you the correct story, but after it becomes\nclear that you are dealing with a problem for which medicine\nhas no good solution, perhaps the best strategy is to join\nthe support group and keep abreast of new findings but not to\nmake a career out of it.\n\n-- \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGordon Banks  N3JXP      | "Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and\ngeb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon."

As soon as you possibly can.  The\ndifference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recovery\nand a long, drawn-out ordeal.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.  Now, your garden-variety\ndoctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury.  Generally,\nany hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists in\nthese kinds of problems.  DON'T WAIT, THOUGH.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.\n\nThe remainder of this information is paraphrased, without permission, from\na wonderful report by New Zealand's Department of Labour (Occupational\nSafety and Health Service): "Occupational Overuse Syndrome. Treatment and\nRehabilitation: A Practitioner's Guide".\n\nFirst, a glossary (or, fancy names for how you shouldn't have your hands):\n(note: you're likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors :)\n\n  RSI: Repetitive Strain Injury - a general term for many kinds of injuries\n  OOS: Occupational Overuse Syndrome -- synonym for RSI\n  CTD: Cumulative Trauma Disorder -- another synonym for RSI\n  WRULD: Work-Related Upper Limb Disorders -- yet another synonym for RSI\n  CTS: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (see below)\n  Hyperextension:  Marked bending at a joint.\n  Pronation: Turning the palm down.\n  Wrist extension: Bending the wrist up.\n  Supination: Turning the palm up.\n  Wrist flexion: Bending the wrist down.\n  Pinch grip: The grip used for a pencil.\n  Ulnar deviation: Bending the wrist towards the little finger.\n  Power grip: The grip used for a hammer.\n  Radial Deviation: Bending the wrist toward the thumb.\n  Abduction: Moving away from the body.\n  Overspanning: Opening the fingers out wide.\n\nNow then, problems come in two main types: Local conditions and diffuse\nconditions.  Local problems are what you'd expect: specific muscles,\ntendons, tendon sheaths, nerves, etc. being inflamed or otherwise hurt.\nDiffuse conditions, often mistaken for local problems, can involve muscle\ndiscomfort, pain, burning and/or tingling; with identifiable areas of\ntenderness in muscles, although they're not necessarily "the problem."\n\n--- Why does Occupational Overuse Syndrome occur?  Here's the theory.\n\nNormally, your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which\npass among the muscle fibers.  When you tense a muscle, you restrict\nthe blood flow.  By the time you're exerting 50% of your full power,\nyou're completely restricting your blood flow.\n\nWithout fresh blood, your muscles use stored energy until they run out,\nthen they switch to anaerobic (without oxygen) metabolism, which generates\nnasty by-products like lactic acid, which cause pain.\n\nOnce one muscle hurts, all its neighbors tense up, perhaps to relieve the\nload.  This makes sense for your normal sort of injury, but it only makes\nthings worse with repetitive motion.  More tension means less blood flow,\nand the cycle continues.\n\nAnother by-product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from\nyour nerves.  They need blood too.\n\nAnyway, when you're typing too much, you're never really giving a change\nfor the blood to get back where it belongs, because your muscles never\nrelax enough to let the blood through.  Stress, poor posture, and poor\nergonomics, only make things worse.\n\n--- Specific injuries you may have heard of:\n\n(note: most injuries come in two flavors: acute and chronic.  Acute\ninjuries are severely painful and noticable.  Chronic conditions have\nless pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real.)\n\nTenosynovitis -- an inflamation of the tendon sheath.  Chronic tenosynovitis\noccurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent: not enough to\ncause acute inflamation, but enough to exceed the tendon sheath's ability\nto lubricate the tendon.  As a result, the tendon sheath thickens, gets\ninflamed, and you've got your problem.\n\nTendonitis -- an inflammation of a tendon.  Repeated tensing of a tendon\ncan cause inflamation.  Eventually, the fibers of the tendon start separating,\nand can even break, leaving behind debris which induces more friction, more\nswelling, and more pain.  "Sub-acute" tendonitis is more common, which entails\na dull ache over the wrist and forearm, some tenderness, and it gets worse\nwith repetitive activity.\n\nCarpal Tunnel Syndrome -- the nerves that run through your wrist into your\nfingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them.  Symptoms include\nfeeling "pins and needles", tingling, numbness, and even loss of sensation.\nCTS is often confused for a diffuse condition.\n\nAdverse Mechanical Tension -- also known as 'neural tension', this is where\nthe nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possibly\ncompressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere.\nAMT can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other OOS \ndisorders.  It is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy \n(brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy).\n\nOthers: for just about every part of your body, there's a fancy name for\na way to injure it.  By now, you should be getting an idea of how OOS\nconditions occur and why.  Just be careful: many inexperienced doctors\nmisdiagnose problems as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, when in reality, you\nmay have a completely different problem.  Always get a second opinion\nbefore somebody does something drastic to you (like surgery).\n\n==4== Typing posture, ergonomics, prevention, treatment\n\nThe most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reduce\ntension in the muscles and tendons.  This requires learning how to relax.\nIf you're under a load of stress, this is doubly important.  Tune out\nthe world and breath deep and regular.  Relaxing should become a guiding\nprinciple in your work: every three minutes take a three second break.\nEVERY THREE MINUTES, TAKE A THREE SECOND BREAK.  Really, do it every\nthree minutes.  It's also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings,\ncalm down, and relax.\n\nIf you can't sleep, you really need to focus on this.  Rest, sleep, and\nrelaxation are really a big deal.\n\nThere are all kinds of other treatments, of course.  Drugs can reduce\ninflamation and pain.  Custom-molded splints can forcefully prevent bad\nposture.  Surgery can fix some problems.  Exercise can help strengthen\nyour muscles.  Regular stretching can help prevent injury.  Good posture\nand a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension.  Ice or hot-cold\ncontrast baths also reduce swelling.  Only your doctor can say what's best\nfor you.\n\n--- Posture -- here are some basic guidelines.  [I so liked the way this was\nwritten in the New Zealand book that I'm lifting it almost verbatim from\nAppendix 10. -- dwallach]\n\n. Let your shoulders relax.\n. Let your elbows swing free.\n. Keep your wrists straight.\n. Pull your chin in to look down - don't flop your head forward.\n. Keep the hollow in the base of your spine.\n. Try leaning back in the chair.\n. Don't slouch or slump forward.\n. Alter your posture from time to time.\n. Every 20 minutes, get up and bend your spine backward.\n\nSet the seat height, first.  Your feet should be flat on the floor.  There \nshould be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees,\nand your thighs should not slope too much.\n\nNow, draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortable\nto work at.  If you are short, this may be impossible.  The beest remedy\nis to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using a\nfootrest.\n\nNow, adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the space\nbetween the backrest and the seat pan.  The backrest should support you in\nthe hollow of your back, so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this\narea.\n\nIf you operate a keyboard, you will be able to spend more time leaning\nback, so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest, if available.\n\n[Now, I diverge a little from the text]\n\nA good chair makes a big difference.  If you don't like your chair, go\nfind a better one.  You really want adjustments for height, back angle,\nback height, and maybe even seat tilt.  Most arm rests seem to get in\nthe way, although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arm\nrests which you can also rotate out of the way.  You should find a good\nstore and play with all these chairs -- pick one that's right for you.\nIn the San Francisco Bay Area, I highly recommend "Just Chairs."  The\nname says it all.\n\n--- Keyboard drawers, wrist pads, and keyboard replacements:\n\nThere is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right.  For some\npeople, wrist pads seem to work wonders.  However, with good posture, you\nshouldn't be resting your wrists on anything -- you would prefer your\nkeyboard to be "right there".  If you drop your arms at your side and then\nlift your hands up at the elbow, you want your keyboard under your hands\nwhen your elbows are at about 90 degrees.  Of course, you want to avoid\npronation, wrist extension, and ulnar deviation at all costs.  Wrist pads\nmay or may not help at this.  You should get somebody else to come and\nlook at how you work: how you sit, how you type, and how you relax.  It's\noften easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders or\ndeviated hands.\n\nSome argue that the normal, flat keyboard is antiquated and poorly\ndesigned.  A number of replacements are available, on the market, today.\nCheck out the accompanying typing-injury-faq/keyboards for much detail.\n\n==5== Requests for more info\n\nClearly, the above information is incomplete.  The typing-injury archive\nis incomplete.  There's always more information out there.  If you'd like\nto submit something, please send me mail, and I'll gladly throw it in.\n\nIf you'd like to maintain a list of products or vendors, that would be\nwonderful!  I'd love somebody to make a list of chair/desk vendors.  I'd\nlove somebody to make a list of doctors.  I'd love somebody to edit the\nabove sections, looking for places where I've obviously goofed.\n\n==6== References\n\nI completely rewrote the information section here, using a wonderful\nguide produced in New Zealand by their Occupational Safety & Health\nService, a service of their Department of Labour.

I have bad luck and got a VD called <Granuloma ingunale>, which involves\nthe growth of granules in the groin.  I found out about it by checking medicine\nbooks and I found the prescriptions.  And I know I can just go to a clinic to\nget it cured.  BUT unfortunately I am serving my duty in the army right now and\nI think it's impossible to prevent anyone from knowing this if I take leaves \nevery day for two weeks for treatment.  Thus I bought the prescribed tablets\nat some drugstore, but to cure it I must get INJECTION of <Streptomycin>, with\na dose of 1g every 12 hours, for at least 10 days.  I can probably buy the \ntools and this solution somewhere but I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO INJECTION BY MYSELF\n!\nCan any kind people here tell me:\n\nIf it's possible to do it? Can I do it on my arm? or it must be done on the hip\nonly??  Any info is welcome and please write me or post your help SOON!! (I am\nalready taking the tablets ..and I can't wait!!)\n\nPlease don't flame me for posting this, and don't judge me. I've learned a \nlesson and all I need now is REAL MEDICAL HELP.
You probably mean "RoHypnol", a member of the benzodiazepine family,\nchemical name is flunitrazepam. It is such a strong tranquilizer that it is\nprobably best refered to as a hypnotic, rather than a tranquilizer. Just one\npill will knock you on your ass. Side effects may be similar to valium, xanax,\nserax, librium and other benzodiazepines.
To construct a Kirlian device find a copy of _Handbook of Psychic\nDiscoveries_ by Sheila Ostrander and Lynn Schroeder 1975 Library of\nCongress 73-88532.  It describes the necessary equipment and\n suppliers for the Tesla coil or alternatives, the copper plate and\nsetup. I used a pack of SX-70 film and removed a single pack in a\ndark room, then made the exposure, put it back in the film pack and\nran it out through the rollers of the camera forinstant developing\nand very high quality.  It is a good way to experience what Kirlian\nPhotography is really and what it is not.  As you know all ready,\nit is the pattern in the bioplasmic energy fieldthat is significant.\nVariations caused by exposure time, distance from the plate, or\npressure on the plate, or variations in the photo materials are not\nimportant.
Candida albicans can cause severe life-threatening infections, usually\nin people who are otherwise quite ill.  This is not, however, the sort\nof illness that you are probably discussing.\n\n"Systemic yeast syndrome" where the body is allergic to\nyeast is considered a quack diagnosis by mainstream medicine.  There\nis a book "The Yeast Connection" which talks about this "illness".\n\nThere is no convincing evidence that such a disease exists.
According to a previous poster, one should seek a doctor's\nassistance for injections. But what about Sumatriptin [sp?]?\nDoesn't one have to inject oneself immediately upon the onset\nof a migraine?

Hi,\nI am not sure where to post this message, please contact me if I'm way off\nthe mark.\nOn 19.3.93 my wife went to her General Practitioner (Doctor). He mentioned\nan article from a medical journal that is of great interest to us. He had\nread it in the previous three months but has been unable to find it again.\nThe article was about Whiplash Injury/Cervical Pain. It mentions the use of\na MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imagery) machine as a diagnostic tool and the work\nof a neurosurgeon who relived cervical pain.\nThis article is most likely in an Australian medical journal.

Ihave had a frozen shoulder for over a year or about a year.  It is still\npartially frozen, and I am still in physical therapy every week.  But the\npain has subsided almost completely.  UNTIL last week when I mowed the\nlawn for twenty minutes each, two days in a row.  I have a push type power\nmower.  The pain started back up a little bit for the first time in quite\na while, and I used ice and medicine again.  Can anybody explain why this\nparticular activity, which does not seem to stress me very much generally,\nshould cause this shoulder problem?\n\nThanks.
My wife has become interested through an acquaintance in Post-Polio Syndrome\nThis apparently is not recognised in New Zealand and different symptons ( eg\nchest complaints) are treated separately. Does anone have any information on\nit\n\nThanks

It would be nice to think that individuals can somehow 'beat the system'\nand like a space explorer, boldly go where no man has gone before and\nreturn with a prize cure. Unfortunately, too often the prize is limited\nand the efficacy of the 'cure' questionable when applied to all\nsufferers.\n\nThis applies to both medical researchers and non-medical individuals.\nJust because it appears in an obscure journal and may be of some use\ndoes not make the next cure-all. What about the dozens of individuals\nwho have courageously participated in clinical trials? Did they have any\nguarentee of cures? Are they any less because they didn't trumpet their\nstory all over the world?\n\nAs a parting note, wasn't there some studies done on Gingko seeds for\nMeniere's? (To the original poster : what about trying for a trial of\nthat? It's probably not a final answer but it certainly may alleviate\nsome of the discomfort. And you'd be helping answer the question for\nfuture sufferers.)
Check out #27903, just some 20 posts before your own. Maybe you missed\nit amidst the flurry of responses? Yet again, the use of this\nnewsgroup is hampered by people not restricting their posts to matters\nthey have substantial knowledge of.\n\nFor cites on MSG, look up almost anything by John W. Olney, a\ntoxicologist who has studied the effects of MSG on the brain and on\ndevelopment.  It is undisputed in the literature that MSG is an\nexcitotoxic food additive, and that its major constituent, glutamate\nis essentially the premierie neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain\n(humans included).  Too much in the diet, and the system gets thrown\noff.  Glutamate and aspartate, also an excitotoxin are necessary in\nsmall amounts, and are freely available in many foods, but the amounts\nadded by industry are far above the amounts that would normally be\nencountered in a ny single food.  By eating lots of junk food,\npackaged soups, and diet soft drinks, it is possible to jack your\nblood levels so high, that anyone with a sensitivity to these\ncompounds will suffer numerous *real* physi9logical effects. \nRead Olney's review paper in Prog. Brain Res, 1988, and check *his*\nsources. They are impecable. There is no dispute.
Thanks to all those who responded to my original post on this question.  The\nfinal diagnosis was Stress.  I did not take her for a chiropractic adjustment.\n(Rachel receives all her medical care at Keller Army Hospital since she is a\nmilitary dependant, and the Army does not yet provide chiropractic adjustments\nas part of its regular health care.)  I am hoping that the arrival of (1)\nSpring Break, and (2) College Acceptance Letters, will help.  *UNFORTUNATELY*\nshe was wait-listed at the college she most dearly wanted to attend, so it\nseems as though that stressor may just continue for a while.  :-(\n\nMeanwhile she is going on a camping trip with her religious youth group for\nspring break, which seems like a good stress-reliever to me.\n\nThanks again for everybody's help/advice/suggestions/ideas.
Hello,\n\nI am writing a grant proposal for a Developmental Genetics class and I\nhave chose to look at the Neurofibromatosis 1 gene and its variable\nexpressivity.  I am curious what has already been done on this subject,\nespecially the relationship between specific mutations and the resulting\nphenotype.  My literature search has produce many references, but I want to\nmake sure I am proposing new research.  If anyone knows aything that has been\nrecently or key peopl doing research to search for using MEDLINE, I would\napprciate being informed.\n\nThank you.
I'm sure the Pittsburgh group has published the baboon work, but I\ndon't know where.  In Chicago they were doing lobe transplants from\nliving donors, and I'm sure they've published.  I don't read the\ntransplant literature.  I just see the liver transplant patients\nwhen they get into neurologic trouble (pretty frequent), so that\nand the newspapers and scuttlebutt is the way I keep up with what\nthey are doing.  Howard Doyle works with them, and can tell you more.\n\n\n\n-- \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGordon Banks  N3JXP      | "Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and\ngeb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon."
(Disclaimer: I'm a sufferer, not a doctor.)\n\nI'm not sure there's a really sharp distinction between allergic and\nvasomotor rhinitis.  Basically, vasomotor rhinitis means your nose is\nstuffy when it has no reason to be (not even an identifiable allergy).\n\nDecongestants and steroid sprays work for vasomotor rhinitis.  Also,\nI can get surprising relief from purely superficial measures such as\nsaline moisturizing spray and moisturizing gel.
Nothing unisual.\nQuote:\n"\nChinese Restaurant Syndrome (CRS):\na transient syndrome, associated with arterial dilatation, due to ingestion\nof monosodium glutamate, which is used liberally in seasoning chinese\nfood; it is characterized by throbbing of the head, lightheadedness,\ntightness of the jaw, neck and shoulders, and bachache.\n"\nEnd quote.\nSource: Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary, 27th edition, 1988, W.B. Saunders, p 1632.\n\nThis was known long ago.  Brain produces and uses some MSG naturally,\nbut not in doses it is served at some chinese places. \nHaving said that, i might add, that in MHO, MSG does not enhance\nflavor enoughf for me to miss it.  When I go to chinese places,\nI order food without MSG.  Goos places will do it for you.\nA prerequisite for such a service would be a waiter, capable of\nunderstanding, what you want.\n\n\nGood Luck.\n\n\nam
The biggest reason why the cost of medical care is so EXTREMELY high and\nincreasing is that NATURAL methods of treatment and even diagnosis are still\nbeing SYSTEMATICALLY IGNORED and SUPPRESSED by the MONEY-GRUBBING and POWER-\nMONGERING "medical" establishment.\n     Some examples of very low cost NATURAL ANTI-cancer Remedies are listed in\nthe following article:\n\n\n                          NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES\n                                 A 3RD OPINION\n          \n               ( Some of these Remedies also work against AIDS. )\n\n\n          DISCLAIMER: This list was compiled from unorthodox sources \n          that have shown themselves to be reliable.  The compiler of \n          this list is NOT a doctor of any kind, but is exercising his \n          First Amendment Constitutional RIGHT of FREE SPEECH on the \n          subjects of his choice. \n\n\n          ( MOST of these Remedies can be found in ANY Grocery Store.  \n          MOST of the rest of them can be found in ANY Health Food \n          Store.  What is important is HOW they are used, and what \n          else is EXCLUDED DURING their use. )\n\n\n          (1) THE 7-DAY FAST. \n               1st day: Eat as much fresh fruit as you want, one kind \n          at a time, preferably grapes. \n               2nd day: Eat all the vegetables you want, at least half \n          raw, including GARLIC; also, whole kernel corn to help scrape \n          clean the intestinal linings. \n               3rd day: Drink all the fresh fruit and vegetable juice \n          you want.  Preferably start with 16 to 32 ounces of prune \n          juice WITH PULP, followed by a gallon of pure (NOT from \n          concentrate) apple juice, then grape juice.  (Stay close to \n          your home bathroom.) \n               4th day: Eat all the UN-salted nuts (NO peanuts) and \n          dried fruit you want, preferably raisins and almonds (ALMONDS \n          CONTAIN LAETRILE.). \n               5th day: ONE GALLON OF LEMONADE.  Squeeze the juice from \n          two lemons into a gallon of water (preferably distilled), and \n          add 2 to 4 tablespoons of locally-made honey, (NO sugar).  \n          Drink one glass per hour.\n          [EVERYone, including healthy people, should do this one day \n          every week, preceded by a large glass of prune juice WITH \n          PULP.] \n               6th day: Same as 5th day. \n               7th day: Same as 6th day. \n               All 7 days, eat ONLY the foods listed above for each \n          day, along with your usual vitamin and mineral supplements, \n          plus as much DISTILLED WATER as you want. \n\n          (2) THE GRAPE DIET. \n               Eat 2 to 3 ounces of fresh grapes every 2 hours, 8 AM to \n          8 PM, every day for six days.  Eat NOTHING else during the \n          six days, but drink as much DISTILLED WATER as you want. \n      \n          (3) APPLE CIDER VINEGAR.\n               Mix a teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar (NOT apple \n          cider "flavored" vinegar.  Regular vinegar is HARMFUL.) in a \n          glass of water (preferably distilled) and drink all of it.  \n          Do this 3 or 4 times per day, for 3 weeks; then stop for a \n          week.  Repeat if desired.  Do this along with a normal \n          healthy diet of natural foods.  This remedy is especially \n          effective against those types of cancer that resemble a \n          FUNGUS, as well as against other kinds of fungus infections. \n        \n          (4) THE SEA-SALT & SODA BATH.  [Please keep an OPEN MIND.]\n               Fill a bathtub with moderately warm water so the level \n          comes up almost to the overflow drain when you get in.  \n          Immerse yourself in it for a minute, and then completely \n          dissolve in the bath water 1 pound of SUN-evaporated SEA-salt \n          (regular salt won't work.) and 1 pound of fresh baking-soda. \n               Soak in this bath for 10 to 20 minutes, while exercising \n          your fingers, toes, and limbs, turning sideways and onto your \n          stomach, dunking your head, sitting up and laying back down, \n          chomping your teeth together, etc.. \n               Among other things, the SEA-salt & Soda Bath neutralizes \n          the accumulated effects of X-rays, etc., as described in the \n          book "Born To Be Magnetic, Vol. 2", by Frances Nixon, 1973. \n               PRECAUTIONS: Only the ONE person using each bath should \n          prepare it and drain it.\n          For at least 30 minutes after taking the bath, stay away \n          from, and even out of sight of, other people.  (Your greatly \n          expanded Aura energy-field during that time could disrupt \n          other people's fields.)  Two hours after the bath, eat at \n          least 8 ounces of yogurt containing ACTIVE Yogurt Cultures.  \n          (The bath may kill FRIENDLY bacteria also.)  Better yet, take \n          a 2-Billion-bacteria "Acidophilus" capsule, which is also an \n          EXCELLENT DAILY REMEDY AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF "A.I.D.S." \n          (because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the \n          digestive tract, taking a big load off the remaining immune \n          system).  [Because this external bath can kill IN-ternal \n          bacteria, it may also be a CURE for "Lyme disease".]\n          Do NOT take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder \n          storm, within 3 days of a full moon, nor during "Major" or \n          "Minor Periods" as listed in the "Solunar Tables" published \n          bimonthly in "Field & Stream" Magazine, (because of the \n          measurable disruptive ambient environmental energy-fields \n          present at those times).\n          Do NOT take this bath more than four times per year. \n       \n          (5) MISCELLANEOUS NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES: \n       \n               For skin cancer, apply STABILIZED Aloe Vera Jel to the \n               affected skin twice daily, and take 2 to 4 tablespoons \n               per day of STABILIZED Aloe Vera Juice internally, for \n               about 2 months. \n        \n               D.M.S.O. (Dimethyl Sulfoxide) causes cancer cells to \n               perform NORMAL cell functions. \n\n               ALMONDS (UN-blanched, UN-roasted) CONTAIN LAETRILE.  \n               To help prevent cancer, eat several almonds every day.  \n               To help cure cancer, eat several OUNCES of almonds per \n               day.\n               [NEVER take large concentrated doses of Laetrile orally.  \n               IT WILL KILL YOU!  Take it INTRAVENOUSLY ONLY.  (Cancer \n               cells contain a certain enzyme which converts Laetrile \n               into cyanide, which then kills the cell.  This enzyme is \n               ALSO present in the digestive system.)] \n\n               ANTI-OXIDANTS are FREE-RADICAL SCAVENGERS, and include \n               Vitamin E, Selenium (200 mcg. per day is safe for most \n               people.), Chromium (up to 100 mcg. per day), Vitamin A \n               (25,000 IU per day is safe for most people.), Superoxide \n               Dismutase (up to 4,000,000 Units per day), Vitamin C (up \n               to 3000 mg. per day), and BHT (Butylated Hydroxy-\n               toluene), [1 to 4 capsules of BHT every night at bedtime \n               will also MAKE ONE IMMUNE AGAINST HERPES (BOTH types), \n               suppress herpes symptoms if one already has herpes, \n               prevent spreading herpes to other people, but will not \n               cure herpes.  BHT MIGHT ALSO DO THESE THINGS AGAINST \n               "A.I.D.S.", which is really a form of cancer similar to \n               leukemia.]  (See the book "Life Extension", by Durk \n               Pearson and Sandy Shaw.) \n\n               HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE.  Dilute twelve(12) drops of 3% \n               hydrogen-peroxide in a glass of pure water (preferably \n               DISTILLED) and drink it.  Do this once or twice per day, \n               hours before or after eating or drinking anything else.  \n               Apply 3% hydrogen-peroxide directly to skin cancers \n               several times per day.\n               Use hydrogen-peroxide ONLY if you are taking a good \n               daily dose of some of the various anti-oxidants \n               described above. \n\n               VITAMIN & MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS are more effective, and \n               much less expensive, when COMBINED together in MEGA \n               doses into SINGLE tablets made from NATURAL sources. \n\n               Cancer cells can NOT live in a strong (100,000 Maxwell) \n               NORTH MAGNETIC FIELD, especially if it is pulsating on \n               and off.  [A strong south magnetic field is an \n               aphrodisiac.]  In my opinion, ALL types of ionizing-\n               radiation treatments for cancer should be REPLACED with \n               daily 30-minute doses of pulsating 100,000-Maxwell NORTH \n               magnetic fields. \n\n               Properly made and operated RADIONICS/PSIONICS MACHINES \n               can both diagnose and cure all forms of cancer, as well \n               as most other medical problems.

Okay, this is a long shot.\n\nMy friend Robin has recurring bouts of mononucleosis-type symptoms, very  \nregularly.  This has been going on for a number of years.  She's seen a  \nnumber of doctors; six was the last count, I think.  Most of them have  \nsaid either "You have mono" or "You're full of it; there's nothing wrong  \nwith you."  One has admitted to having no idea what was wrong with her,  \nand one has claimed that it is Epstein-Barr syndrome.\n\nNow, what she told me about EBS is that very few doctors even believe that  \nit exists.  (Obviously, this has been her experience.)  So, what's the  \nstory?  Is it real?  Does the medical profession believe it to be real?\n\nHas anyone had success is treating EBS?  Or is it just something to live  \nwith?  Thanks for your assistance.
etc. ...\n\n\nDyer is beyond rude. \n\nThere have been and always will be people who are blinded by their own \nknowledge and unopen to anything that isn't already established. Given what \nthe medical community doesn't know, I'm surprised that he has this outlook.\n\nFor the record, I have had several outbreaks of thrush during the several \npast few years, with no indication of immunosuppression or nutritional \ndeficiencies. I had not taken any antobiotics. \n\nMy dentist (who sees a fair amount of thrush) recommended acidophilous:\n\nAfter I began taking acidophilous on a daily basis, the outbreaks ceased.\nWhen I quit taking the acidophilous, the outbreaks periodically resumed. \nI resumed taking the acidophilous with no further outbreaks since then.
To: nyeda@cnsvax.uwec.edu (David Nye)\n\nThere is a person on the FIDO CFS echo who claims that he was \ncured of CFS by taking accutane.  He also claims that you are \nusing it in the treatment of Fibromyalgia Syndrome.  Are you \nusing accutane in the treatment of Fibromyalgia Syndrome?  Have \nyou used it for CFS?  Have you gotten good results with it?  Are \nyou aware of any double blind studies on the use of accutane in \nthese conditions?  Thank you in advance for all replies.
MSG is common in many food we eat, including Chinese (though some oriental\nrestaurants might put a tad too much in them).  I've noticed that when I\ngo out and eat in most of the Chinese food restaurants, I will usually get\na slight headache and an ununsual thirst afterwards.  This happens to many\nof my friends and relatives too.  And, heh, we eat Chinese food all the\ntime at home :) (but we don't use MSG when we're cooking for ourselves)\n\nSo, when we put one and one together, it can be safely assumed that\nMSG may cause some allergic reactions in some people.\n\nStick with natural things.  MSG doesn't do body any good (and possibly\nharms, for that matter).  So, why bother with it?  Taste food as it should\nbe tasted, and don't cloud the flavor with an imaginary cloak of MSG.\n\n-michael
This reminds me of the last Graham Kerr cooking show I saw.  Today he\nsmoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot!  He used a strange technique\nI'd never seen before.\n\nHe took a big pot with lid, and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil.\nThe tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee-table ash tray,\nmade by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges.\n\nIn the tray, he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar, a similar\nquantity of brown rice (he said any rice will do), the contents of two\nteabags of Earl Grey tea, and a few cloves.\n\nOn top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket-type steamer, with\ntwo chicken breasts in it.  The lid was put on, and the whole assembly\nwent on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minutes.\n\nLater, he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts.  What surprises\nand concerns me are:\n\n1)  No wood chips.  Where does the smoke flavor come from?\n\n2)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember hearing that carmel color\n    (obtained by caramelizing sugar -- a common coloring and flavoring\n    agent) had been found to be carcinogenic.  I believe they injected\n    it under the skin of rats, or something.  If the results were conclusive,\n    caramel color would not be legal in the U.S., yet it is still being\n    used.  Was the initial research result found to be incorrect, or what?\n\n3)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember Earl Grey tea being implicated\n    as carcinogenic, because it contains oil of bergamot (an extract\n    from the skin of a type of citrus fruit).  Does anyone know whatever\n    happened with that story?  If it were carcinogenic, Earl Grey tea\n    could not have it as an additive, yet it apparently continues to do\n    so.\n\nWRT natural wood smoke (I've smoking a duck right now, as it happens),\nI've noticed that a heavily-smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy\ntaste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently\nstopped flowing.  I find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips,\ngetting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process,\nthen slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips.\n\nMy theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low-molecular weight\nstuff, like terpenes, and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort\nof larger molecule more similar to tar.  The long barbeque time after\nthe initial intensive smoke drives off the low-molecular weight stuff,\njust leaving the flavor behind.  Does anyone know if my theory is correct?\n\nI also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping\non the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic.  For that reason, and because\nit covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess, I only grill\nnon-drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals.  I do stuff like this\nduck by indirect heat.  I have a long rectangular Weber, and I put the coals\nat one end and the meat at the other end.  The fat drops directly on the\nfloor below the meat, and next time I use the barbeque I make the fire\nin that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals.\n\nAnd yet another reason I've heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that\nsmoked cured meat, like pork sausage and bacon, contains\nnitrosamines, which are carcinogenic.  I'm pretty sure this claim actually\nhas some standing, don't know about the others.
It is illegal to perform acupuncture with unsterilized needles. No licensed\npractitioner would dare do this. Also there is not a single documented case\nof transmission of AIDS via acupuncture needles. I wouldn't worry about it.
From article <1993Apr22.233001.13436@vax.oxford.ac.uk>, by krishnas@vax.oxford.ac.uk:\nThe areas that are least likely to hurt are where you have a little \nfat.  I inject on my legs and gut, and prefer the gut.  I can stick\nit in at a 90 degree angle, and barely feel it.  I'm not fat, just\nhave a little gut.  My legs however, are muscular, and I have to pinch\nto get anything, and then I inject at about a 45 degree angle,and it\nstill hurts.  The rate of absorbtion differs for subcutaneous and  \nmuscular injections however--so if it's a daily thing it would be\nbest not to switch places every day to keep consistencey.  Although\nsome suggest switch legs or sides of the stomach for each shot, to prevent \nirritation.  When you clean the spot off with an alcohol prep, \nwait for it to dry somewhat, or you may get the alcohol in the\npuncture, and of course, that doesn't feel good.  A way to prevent\nirratation is to mark the spot that you injected.  A good way to\ndo this is use a little round bandage and put it over the \nspot.  This helps prevent you from injecting in the same spot,\nand spacing the sites out accuartely (about 1 1/2 " apart.)\n\nThis is from experience, so I hope it'll help you.  (I have\ndiabetes and have to take an injection every morning.)\n\n			Later,\n				David
Do you believe that any quacks exist?  How about quack diagnoses?  Is\nbeing a "licensed physician" enough to guarantee that someone is not\na quack, or is it just that even if a licensed physician is a quack,\nother people shouldn't say so?  Can you give an example of a\ncommonly diagnosed ailment that you think is a quack diagnosis,\nor have we gotten to the point in civilization where we no longer\nneed to worry about unscrupulous "healers" taking advantage of\npeople.
Is that true?  I know some that won't even interview FMGs.  \nMost programs discriminate, in that given an FMG equally\nqualified as an American they will take the American.  What\nrights do they actually have?  Does it matter if they are\nUS citizens (most are not)?  We have had good luck with FMGs\nand bad luck.  SOme of our very best residents have been FMGs.\nAlso, our very worst.  As it turns out, the worst FMGs are often\nUS citizens that studied in off-shore medical schools.  Of the\n5 residents fired for incompetence in the 12 years I've been here \nin my department, all have been FMGs.  3 were US citizens who studied \nin Guadalajara, 1 was a US citizen but was trained in the Soviet Union, \nand one was Philipina.  Unfortunately, all are now practicing medicine\nsomewhere, 3 of them in Neurology after having been picked up by \nother programs, 1 in psychiatry, and the other in emergency medicine.\n\n\n\n-- \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGordon Banks  N3JXP      | "Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and\ngeb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon."

Both courses, Intensive Elementary Japanese and \nIntensive Intermediate Japanese, are ten week, ten credit courses \neach equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study.  They begin \nJune 7 and end August 13.  The courses meet five days per week, five hours \nper day.  There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course.  \nFellowships available for science and engineering students.  Contact \nSteven Brener, Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology\nManagement Program, at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or\naddress below.  \nALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY, THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO \nUNIVERSITY STUDENTS.\n\n\n\n  \n\n#######################################################################\n#################   New Program Announcement   ########################\n#######################################################################\n\n\n            JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\nThe Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a new\nprogram jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon \nUniversity.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific \ncommunitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and \nJanuary 1994.\n\n\nPROGRAM OBJECTIVES\nThe program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the \nUnited States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers\nexperience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is \nfacilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and\nlaboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop\nlong-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.\n\n\nPROGRAM DESIGN\nTo fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to \ndevelop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and\nits culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:\n\n1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE\nSeveral Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses\ndesigned to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a\nrelatively short time.\n\n2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE\nA particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the\ncultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in \nmanufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a \nvariety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology,\nSociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums\nwill be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or \nresearch facilities in the United States will be scheduled.\n\n\n3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN\nUpon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU, \nparticipants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe,\nand participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan\nwill generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.\n\n\nFELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL AS\nSTIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.\n\n        FOR MORE INFORMATION AND APPLICATION MATERIALS CONTACT\n\nSTEVEN BRENER				SUSIE BROWN\nJSTMP					Carnegie Mellon University, GSIA\nUniversity of Pittsburgh		Pittsburgh, PA 15213-3890\n4E25 Forbes Quadrangle			Telephone: (412) 268-7806\nPittsburgh, PA 15260			FAX:	   (412) 268-8163\nTelephone: (412) 648-7414		\nFAX:       (412) 648-2199		\n\n############################################################################\n############################################################################ \n\n\nInterested individuals, companies and institutions should respond by phone or\nmail.

....................\n\n\nThis example is probably wrong.  There is the case of one famous\nphysicist telling another that he was probably wrong.

I attended high school in the San Jose, California area in the early 1980's,\nand I remember a (smallish) outbreak of a strange illness, in which\npeople developed measles-like spots on their bodies.  This condition\nseemed to last only a few days, and I don't recall anyone reporting any other\nsymptoms.  I seem to recall reading somewhere that this was believed to have\nbeen viral in nature, but I don't know for sure.\n\nHowever, I have been curious since then about this.
Crullerian.\n\n\nCrullerian photography isn't educational, except in a purely satiric\nsense.\n\n\nCrullerian photography involves putting donuts between grease-covered\nhot metal plates while illuminating them with a Krypton Stroboscope.\nThrough a unique iteration involving the 4th-dimensional projection of\na torus through the semi-stochastic interactions of hot monomolecular\nlipid layers covering the metal plates (the best metal is iron since\nit repels Vampires and Succubi) the donuts start developing flutes,\nand within moments actually become poly-crenellated hot greasy\nbreadtubes. Some people believe that food is the way to a man's heart,\nbut most psychics agree that there is nothing like hot Crullers for\nbreakfast; the chemical composition of crullers is a mystery, some\nthought evidence of Charles Fort's channeling in Stevie Wonder's\nproduction of "The Secret Life of Plants" when played backwards in the\ntheatre of unnaturally fertile Findhorn Farms has deduced that they\nare complex carbohydrates ordinarily only found by spectoscopy in the\nMagellenic Clouds. I called Devi on my Orgone Box and asked her if\nthis was really the case, and she TM levitated me a letter across the\nAtlantic to tell me it was indeed not just another case of\nmisunderstanding Tesla, though the Miskatonic University hasn't\nconfirmed anything at all. At least the Crullers taste good; I got the\nrecipe from Kaspar Hauser.
I am looking for information on possible causes and long term effects\nof bone marrow sclerosis.

I'd dump him.  Rude is rude and it seems he enjoys belittling and\nhumiliating you.  But don't just dump him, write to him and tell\nhim why you are firing him.

Don't be vindictive in\nyour letter, be truthful but VERY firm.\n\nBut don't be a victim and just put up with it.  Take control!  It'll\nmake you feel great!\n\nNancy M.
OK, just for grins:\n- Kekule hypothesized a resonant structure for the aromatic benzene\nring after waking from a dream in which a snake was swallowing his tail.\n- Archimedes formalized the principle of buoyancy while meditating in\nhis bath.\n\nIn neither case was there "no connection to prior theories, concepts, etc."\nas you stipulated above. What there was was an intuitive leap beyond\nthe current way of thinking, to develop ideas which subsequently proved\nto have predictive power (e.g., they stood the test of experimental\nverification).\n\npardon my kibbutzing...

"When people are on \nthe threshold of having, a serious asthma attack, particles can push them over \nthe edge." \n     The Seattle Study correlated 13 months of asthma emergency room visits \nwith daily levels of PM,,,. or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter \nof 10 microns or less.  These finer particles are considered hazardous because \nthey are small enough penetrate into the lung.  Cities are considered out of \ncompliance with clean air laws if the 24-hour average concentration of PM10 \nexceeds 150 micrograms per cubic millimeter of air.  \n     In Seattle however, a link between fine particles and asthma was found at \nlevels as low as 30 micrograms.  The authors concluded that for every 30 \nmicrogram increase in the four-day average of PM10, the odds of someone with \nasthma needing emergency treatment increased by 12 percent.  \n     The findings were published in the April American Review of Respiratory \nDisease, an official journal of the American Thoracic Society, the Lung \nAssociation's medical section.  \n     The study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that \nparticulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat.  A 1992 study \nby Dr. Schwartz and Douglas Dockery, Ph.D., of Harvard found that particles \nmay be causing roughly 60,000 premature deaths each year in the United States.  \nOther studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms \nand bronchitis in children.  \n     "Government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone," \nsays Dr. Schwartz.  "But more and more research is showing that particles are \nbad actors as well."      One problem in setting, standards for particulate \nair pollution is that PMIO is difficult to study.  Unlike other regulated \npollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide, particulate matter is a complex \nand varying mixture of substances, including carbon, hydrocarbons, dust, and \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 29\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nacid aerosols.  \n     "Researchers can't Put people in exposure chambers to study the effects \nof particulate air pollution," says Dr. Schwartz.  "We have no way of \nduplicating the typical urban mix of particles.  " Consequently, most of what \nis known about particulates has been learned through population-based research \nlike the Seattle study.  \n     Given that the EPA's current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur \ndioxide standards, the agency is unlikely to reexamine the PM10 standard any \ntime soon.  Until changes are made, there appears to be little people with \nasthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles.\n     "In some areas, you can get reports on air quality, but the reports only \ncover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard, and that's \nrarely particulate matter," says Dr.  Schwartz.

Within the program, there are four types \nof cancer centers:  basic science cancer centers (14), which engage primarily \nin basic cancer research; clinical cancer centers (12), which focus on \nclinical research; "comprehensive" cancer centers (28), which emphasize a \nmultidisciplinary approach to cancer research, patient care, and community \noutreach; and consortium cancer centers (1), which specialize in cancer \nprevention and control research. \n \nAlthough some cancer centers existed in the late 1960s and the 1970s, it was \nthe National Cancer Act of 1971 that authorized the establishment of 15 new \ncancer centers, as well as continuing support for existing ones.  The passage \nof the act also dramatically transformed the centers' structure and broadened \nthe scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic, clinical, and \ncancer control research.  Over the next two decades, the centers' program grew \nprogressively. \n \nIn 1990, there were 19 comprehensive cancer centers in the nation. Today, \nthere are 28 of these institutions, all of which meet specific NCI criteria \nfor comprehensive status. \n \nTo attain recognition from the NCI as a comprehensive cancer center, an \ninstitution must pass rigorous peer review.  Under guidelines newly \nestablished in 1990, the eight criteria for "comprehensiveness" include the \nrequirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in \nseveral scientific fields, such as biology and molecular genetics, a strong \nprogram of clinical research, and an ability to transfer research findings \ninto clinical practice. \n \nMoreover, five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly \nbeyond that required for attaining a Cancer Center Support Grant (also \nreferred to as a P30 or core grant), the mechanism of choice for supporting \nthe infrastructure of a cancer center's operations.  These criteria encompass \nstrong participation in NCI-designated high-priority clinical trials, \nsignificant levels of cancer prevention and control research, and important \noutreach and educational activities--all of which are funded by a variety of \nsources. \n \nThe other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and \ncapabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit \nimportant new findings or address timely research questions. \n \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 32\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nOf the 55 NCI-designated Cancer Centers, 14 are of the basic science type.  \nThese centers engage almost entirely in basic research, although some centers \nengage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators \nand in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications \nfrom new discoveries in the laboratory. \n \nClinical cancer centers, in contrast, focus on both basic research and \nclinical research within the same institutional framework, and frequently \nincorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their \noverall research programs.  There are 12 such centers today. \n \nFinally, consortium cancer centers, of which there is one, are uniquely \nstructured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and \ncontrol research.  These centers interface with state and local public health \ndepartments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention \nand control techniques from their research findings to those institutions \nresponsible for implementing population-wide public health programs.  \nConsortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with \ninstitutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community \nhospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials. \n \nTogether, the 55 NCI-Designated Cancer Centers continue to work toward \ncreating new and innovative approaches to cancer research, and through \ninterdisciplinary efforts, to effectively move this research from the \nlaboratory into clinical trials and into clinical practice. \n \nComprehensive Cancer Centers (Internet addresses are given where available) \n \nUniversity of Alabama at Birmingham Comprehensive Cancer Center\nBasic Health Sciences Building, Room 108\n1918 University Boulevard\nBirmingham, Alabama 35294\n(205) 934-6612\n \nUniversity of Arizona Cancer Center\n1501 North Campbell Avenue\nTucson, Arizona 85724\n(602) 626-6372\nInternet:  syd@azcc.arizona.edu\n \nJonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center\nUniversity of California at Los Angeles\n200 Medical Plaza\nLos Angeles, California 90027\n(213) 206-0278\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 33\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nInternet:  rick@jccc.medsch.ucla.edu\n \nKenneth T.

The \ndecision ends the controversy between Army AIDS researchers who had hoped to \ntest a vaccine made by  MicroGeneSys Inc. and the National Institutes of \nHealth, which  contended that multiple vaccines should be tested.  Health and  \nHuman Services Secretary Donna Shalala said a final announcement  on the \ntherapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last  Friday.  Companies \nincluding Genentech Inc., Chiron Corp., and  Immuno AG have already told NIH \nthat they are prepared to  participate in the vaccine tests.  The testing is \nintended to  demonstrate whether AIDS vaccines are effective in thwarting the  \nreplication of HIV in patients already infected.  Shalala refuted last week's \nreports that the Clinton administration had decided  the Army's test of the \nMicroGeneSys VaxSyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time.  \n"The report was inaccurate,  and I expect there to be some announcement in the \nnext 24 hours  about that particular AIDS research project," said Shalala.   \nAdministration sources subsequently confirmed that NIH director  Dr. Bernadine \nHealy and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler had \nconvinced the White House that multiple  vaccines should be tested \nsimultaneously.  But MicroGeneSys  president Frank Volvovitz said a test of \nmultiple vaccines could  triple the cost of the trial and delay it by two \nyears.\n\n==================================================================    \n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 41\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n"The Limits of AZT's Impact on HIV" U.S. News & World Report (04/12/93) Vol. \n114, No. 14, P. 18 \n\n     AZT has become the most widely used drug to fight AIDS since it  was \napproved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1987.   Burroughs Wellcome, \nthe manufacturer of AZT, made $338 million  last year alone from sales of the \ndrug.  However, a team of  European researchers recently reported that \nalthough HIV-positive patients taking AZT demonstrated a slightly lower risk \nof  developing AIDS within the first year of treatment, that benefit  \ndisappeared two years later.  The Lancet published preliminary  findings of \nthe three-year study, which could give more reason  for critics to argue the \ndrug's cost, side effects, and general  efficacy.  Even though U.S. \nresearchers concede the study was  more comprehensive than American trials, \nmany argue the European  researchers' suggestion that HIV-positive patients \nexperience  little improvement in their illness before the development of  \nAIDS symptoms.

To start with, no methodology or form of reasoning is infallible.  So\nthere's a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in a\ngiven context.  Insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completely\nand makes progress impossible.  (Expenditure of sufficiently large sums\nof money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this.)  On the other\nhand, with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results which\neventually turn out to be false.  There is a morass of studies\ncontradicting other studies and outsiders start saying  "You people call\nTHIS science?"   (My opinion, for what it's worth, is that one sees both\nthese phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology.)  \n\nSome subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigor\nappropriate for a particular investigation.  I don't believe it is \never possible to banish subjective judgement from science.  \n\n\nMy second point, though, is that highly capable people can often make\nextremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when using\nmethodology considered inadequate by the usual standards.  I think this\nis true of many scientists and I think it is true of many who approach\ntheir discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientific.\n\nWithin mathematics, I think there are several examples, especially before\nthe twentieth century.  One conspicuous case is that of Riemann, who is\nfamous for many theorems he stated but did not prove.  (Later \nmathematicians did prove them, of course.)  \n\nI think that for a good scientist, empirical investigation is often not\nso much a matter of determining what is true and what's not  as it is a \nmatter of convincing other people.  (People have proposed lots of \nincompatible definitions of science here, but I think the ability to \nobjectively convince others of the validity of one's results is an\nessential element.  Not that one can necessarily do that at every step \nof the scientific process, but I think that if one is not moving toward \nthat goal then one is not doing science.)\n\nWhen a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does and\nseems to be very successful at it, I think that his judgements are also\nworthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth further\ninvestigation.  \n\n\nAdmittedly, my question was not at all well posed.  A considerable\namount of effort in a "serious scholarly investigation" such as I\nsuggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately \nspecific question to try and answer.  \n\nThe "science" I was thinking of in my question is the actual science \ncurrently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century.  \nI certainly wasn't thinking of some idealized science or the mere use \nof "reason and observation."\n\nOne thing I had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whether\nin many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experienced\npractitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies.  \n\nSince Russell Turpin seems to be much more familiar than I am with\nthe study of scientific methodology, perhaps he can tell us if there \nis any existing research related to this question.  \n\n--\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.
-*----\nI agree with everything that Lee Lady wrote in her previous post in\nthis thread.  In case this puzzles people, I would like to expand\non two of her comments.\n\n\nOne of the most important (and difficult) aspects of reasoning\nabout empirical investigation lies in understanding the context,\nscope, and importance of the various arguments and pieces of\nevidence that are marshalled for a claim.  Some errors break the\nback of a piece of research, some leave a hole that needs to be\nfilled in, and some are trivial in their importance.  It is a\ngrave mistake to confuse these.\n\nPast snippets from this thread:\n\n\n\nBack to Lee Lady:\n\n\nThese posters are making the mistake that I have previously\ncriticized of adhering to a methodological recipe.  A "carefully\ndesigned and controlled study" is neither always possible nor\nalways important.  (On the other hand, if someone is proposing a\nremedy that supposedly alleviates a chronic medical problem, we\nhave enough knowledge of the errors that have plagued *this* kind\nof claim to ask for a "carefully designed and controlled study"\nto alleviate our skepticism.)\n\nRules such as "support the hypothesis by a carefully designed and\ncontrolled study" are too narrow to apply to *all* investigation.\nI think that the requirements for particular reasoning to be\nconvincing depends greatly on the kinds of mistakes that have\noccurred in past reasoning about the same kinds of things.  (To\nreuse the previous example, we know that conclusions from\nuncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medical\nproblems are notoriously problematic.)
We were talking about Migraine and Exercise (I'm the one who can't\nfathom the thought of exercise during migraine...).  Anyway, turning\nthe thread around, the other day I played tennis during my lunch\nhour.  I'm out of tennis shape so it was very intense exercise.  I\ngot overheated, and dehydrated.  Afterwards, I noticed a tingling\nsensation all over my head then about 2 hours later, I could feel\na migraine start.  (I continued to drink water in the afternoon.)\nI took cafergot, but it didn't help and the pain started although\nit wasn't as intense as it usually is and about 9pm that night, the\npain subsided.\n\nThis isn't the first time that I've had a migraine occur after exercise.\nI'm wondering if anyone else has had the same experience and I wonder\nwhat triggers the migraine in this situation (heat buildup? dehydration?).\nI'm not giving up tennis so is there anything I can do (besides get into \nshape and don't play at high noon) to prevent this?\n\nThanks,
No, just a little anger.  Normally I don't rip people's lips off, except\nwhen my candida has overcolonized and I become:  "Fungus Man"!  :^)\n\nJon\n\n-- \n\nCharter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.

=Surprise surprise, different people react differently to different things. One\n=slightly off the subject case in point. My brother got stung by a bee. I know\n=he is allergic to bee stings, but that his reaction is severe localized\n=swelling, not anaphylactic shock. I could not convince the doctors of that,\n=however, because that's not written in their little rule book.\n\nOf course, bee venom isn't a single chemical.  Could be your brother is\nreacting to a different component than the one that causes anaphylactic shock\nin other people.\n\nSimilarly, Chinese food isn't just MSG.  There are a lot of other ingredients\nin it.  Why, when someone eats something with lots of ingredients they don't\nnormally consume, one of which happens to be MSG, do they immediately conclude\nthat any negative reaction is to the MSG?\n\n=I would not be surprised in the least to find out the SOME people have bad\n=reactions to MSG, including headaches, stomachaches and even vomiting.\n\nI'd be surprised if some of these reactions weren't due to other ingredients.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCarl J Lydick | INTERnet: CARL@SOL1.GPS.CALTECH.EDU | NSI/HEPnet: SOL1::CARL

[reply to aldridge@netcom.com (Jacquelin Aldridge)]\n \n \nThe acquisition of scientific knowledge is completely scientific.  The\napplication of that knowledge in individual cases may be more art than\nscience.\n \n \nCertainly we don't have all the answers.  The question is, what is the\nmost reliable means of acquiring further medical knowledge?  The\nscientific method has proven itself to be reliable.  The *only* reason\nalternative therapies are shunned by physicians is that their\npractitioners refuse to submit their theories to rigorous scientific\nscrutiny, insisting that "tradition" or anecdotal evidence are\nsufficient.  These have been shown many times in the past to be very\nunreliable ways of acquiring reliable knowledge.  Crook's ideas have\nnever been backed up by scientific evidence.  His unwillingness to do\ngood science makes the rest of us doubt the veracity of his contentions.
Blood glucose levels of 40 or so are common several hours after a\nbig meal.

If a patient complains of dizziness,\nfaintness, sweating, palpitations, etc. reliably several hours after\na big meal, the recommendations are obvious - eat smaller meals.

I second what Spenser Aden said in reply.  Additionally, it is hard to say\nwhat type of response you ar3e having to prednisone since you did not say\nhow long you have been on it.  Patients are generally kept on steroids for\nmonths before thinking about tapering.  Alternatives to daily dosing are \nevery other day dosing, in your case 20mg every other day would be a start.\nAnother option if it is not possible to get you off prednisone is to start\nazathioprine.  Like Spenser said, you should generally be on another drug\nin addition to your prednisone, like asulfidine.  A lot of the specifics\nabout options, though, depends on severity, location, and duration of \ndisease, as well as histology, so take advice off the net for what it\nis worth.  \n\nI treat patients with UC and Crohn's.  An educated patient is a good \npatient, but let your doctor know where the advice came from so things\ncan be put in context.  You should also be a member of the Crohn's and\nColitis Foundation of America.  1-800-932-2423 office / 1-800-343-3637\ninfo hotline.\n\nBest of Luck to you.
I've recently listened to a tape by Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski, in which he \nclaims to have discovered a series naturally occuring peptides with anti-\ncancer properties that he names antineoplastons.  Burzynski says that his \nwork has met with hostility in the United States, despite the favorable \nresponses of his subjects during clinical trials.\n\nWhat is the generally accepted opinion of Dr. Burzynski's research?  He \npaints himself as a lone researcher with a new breakthrough battling an \nintolerant medical establishment, but I have no basis from which to judge \nhis claims.  Two weeks ago, however, I read that the NIH's Department of \nAlternative Medicine has decided to focus their attention on Burzynski's \nwork.  Their budget is so small that I imagine they wouldn't investigate a \ntreatment that didn't seem promising.\n\nAny opinions on Burzynski's antineoplastons or information about the current \nstatus of his research would be appreciated.

[reply to geb@cs.pitt.edu (Gordon Banks)]\n \n \n \nI made a decision a while back that I will not be bullied into getting\nstudies like a CT or MRI when I don't think they are indicated.  If the\npatient won't accept my explanation of why I think the study would be a\nwaste of time and money, I suggest a second opinion.

1: "90% of diseases" is not the same thing as "90% of patients".\n\n   In a world with one curable disease that strikes 100 people, and nine\n   incurable diseases which strikes one person each, medical science will cure\n   91% of the patients and report that 90% of diseases have no therapy.\n\n2: A disease would be counted among the 90% untreatable if nothing better than\n   a placebo were known.  Of course MDs are ethically bound to not knowingly\n   dispense placebos...
As has been noted before, there is the distinction between _motivation_\nand _method_.  No experimental result should be accepted unless it is\ndescribed in sufficient detail to be replicated, and the replications\ndo indeed reproduce the result.  No theoretical argument should be\naccepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed, and\nreasonable, knowlegeable, people agree with the force of the logic.\n\nBut people try experiments, and pursue arguments, for all sorts of crazy\nreasons.  Irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are a\nlarge part of the history of science.\n\nThere are a couple of negative points to make here:\n\n1) A theory of qi could, conceivably, become accepted without direct\nverification of the existence of qi.  For example, quarks are an accepted\npart of the standard model of physics, with no direct verification.  What\nwould be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medical\nreality better than the alternatives.  The central theoretical claim could\nlie forever beyond experiment, as long as there was a sufficient body of\nexperimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other.\n\n(I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, though.\nI don't think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much less\na theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology.  And it\nis hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather\ndirectly verifying the existence of qi.)\n\n2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational\nexperiment-data-theory sequence.  Most experiments are carried out, and\ninterpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks.  The theoretical\ncontroversies of the day determine which experiments get done.  Overall,\nthere is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations,\npetty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and which\ncomputations, get done.  What keeps it going forward is the critical\nfunction of science: results don't count unless they can be replicated.\n\nThe whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test.  The generate\npart can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly.\n\nPasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals;\nbut even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed;\nthat when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotate\npolarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version was\nindistinguishable from tartaric acid.  Pasteur's irrational motivation had\nled to a replicable, and important, result.\n\nThis is where Lysenko, creationists, etc. fail.  They have usually not\neven produced coherent theories that predict much of anything.  When their\ntheories do predict, and are contradicted by experiment, they do not\nconcede the point and modify their theories; rather they try to suppress\nthe results (Lysenko) or try to divert attention to other evidence they\nthink supports their position (creationists).
There's a lot of evidence, it just hasn't been adequately gathered and\npublished in a way that will convince the die-hard melancholic skeptics\nwho quiver everytime the word 'anecdote' or 'empirical' is used.\n\nFor example, Dr. Ivker, who wrote the book "Sinus Survival", always gives,\nbefore any other treatment, a systemic anti-fungal (such as Nizoral) to his\nnew patients IF they've been on braod-spectrum anti-biotics 4 or more times\nin the last two years.  He's kept a record of the results, and for over \n2000 patients found that over 90% of his patients get significant relief\nof allergic/sinus symptoms.  Of course, this is only the beginning for his\nprogram.\n\nIn my case, as I reported a few weeks ago, I was developing the classic\nsymptoms outlined in 'The Yeast Connection' (I agree it is a poorly \nwritten book):  e.g., extreme sensitivity to plastics, vapors, etc. which\nI never had before (started in November).  Within one week of full dosage\nof Sporanox, the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared - I can\nnow sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes.  I'm also\n*greatly* improved in other areas as well.\n\nOf course, I have allergy symptoms, etc.  I am especially allergic to\nmolds, yeasts, etc.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that\nif one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body, and you have a\nnatural allergy to yeasts, that a threshold would be reached where you\nwould have perceptible symptoms.  Also, yeast do produce toxins of various\nsorts, and again, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize that\nsuch toxins can cause problems in some people.  In my case it was sinus\nsince that's the center of my allergic response.  Of course, the $60,000\nquestion is whether a person who is immune compromised (as tests showed I was\nfrom over 5 years of antibiotics, nutritionally-deficiencies because of the\nstress of infections and allergies, etc.), can develop excessive yeast\ncolonization somewhere in the body.  It is a tough question to answer since\ntesting for excessive yeast colonization is not easy.  One almost has to\ntake an empirical approach to diagnosis.  Fortunately, Sporanox is relatively\nsafe unlike past anti-fungals (still have to be careful, however) so there's\nno reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical reasons.\n\nBTW, some would say to try Nystatin.  Unfortunately, most yeast grows hyphae\ntoo deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent affect.  You'll find\na lot of people who are on Nystatin all the time.\n\nIn summary, I appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep\nmedicine on the right road.  But methinks that some who hold too firmly\nto the party line are academics who haven't been in the trenches long enough\nactually treating patients.  If anybody, doctors included, said to me to my\nface that there is no evidence of the 'yeast connection', I cannot guarantee\ntheir safety.  For their incompetence, ripping off their lips is justified as\nfar as I am concerned.\n\nJon Noring\n\n-- \n\nCharter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.

Where did you read this?  I don't think this is true.  I think most\nmedical treatments are based on science, although it is difficult\nto prove anything with certitude.  It is true that there are some\nthings that have just been found "to work", but we have no good\nexplanation for why.  But almost everything does have a scientific\nrationale.

I noticed several years ago that when I took analgesics fairly regularly,\n(motrin at the time), I seemed to get a lot of migraines.  But had\nforgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here.\nI generally don't take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches, because I've\nfound them to be ineffective.  However, I have two other pain sources\nthat force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn).  First, is some\npelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period, and then much\nworse at midcycle.  I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past\n(~12 years ago), so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably due\nto the endometriosis coming back.  I've tried Synarel, it reduced\nthe pain while I took it (3 mos), but the pain returned immediately\nafter I stopped.  Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the\nonly "real solution" to my problem.  Although I don't expect to have\nany more children, I don't like the idea of having my uterus and\none remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I had\nthe surgery for endometriosis).  One of the Drs that suggested\nI get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery, but perhaps thinks\nthat type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan\nto have children.  So basically all I'm left with is toughing out\nthe pain.  This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or something\nsimilar - but not aspirin, that doesn't work, and Motrin gave me\nhorrible gastritis a few years ago, so I'm through with it).  In\nfact, Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take\nit regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in both \nlegs) as I'll discuss in a moment.  Generally though, I wait until\nI have the pain before I take the Naprosyn, but then it takes\nseveral hours for it reduce the pain (it's actually quite effective\nat reducing the pain, it just takes quite a while).  In the meantime\nI'm frequently in severe pain.\n\nThe other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in\nbilateral radiculopathy.  I've had MRIs, Xrays, CT scan, and EMGs\n(I've had 2 of them, and don't intend to ever do that again) with\nnerve conduction tests.  The tests have not been conclusive as to\nwhat is causing my back and leg pain.  The MRI reports both say I have\nseveral bulging, degeneratig disks, and from the Xrays (and MRI, I think)\nit is apparent that I have arthritis.  The reading on the CT scan\nwas that there are two herniations (L3-L4, and L4-L5), but others\nhav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations.\nThe second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation\ncompared to the first EMG.  Oh yeah, I had some other horrible test,\ncalled something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the\n"internal nerves" are working fine.   Anyway, the bottom line is that\nI sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain.  The back pain\nis there all the time, but I can live with it.  When the leg pain is there,\nI need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain\nto a level where I can work.  So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9\nmonths (every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse, so I'd \nalways resume).  Since last November I have taken it much less frequently,\nand primarily for the pelvic pain.  I have been going to physical\ntherapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week).  After the first month\nor so, my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier,\nbut it had caused a lot of pain in my back, this time she tried it at\na lower weight).  After a month or two, the pain in my legs began going\naway (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back, which\ncould be reduced with ultrasound and massage).  So now, I don't have\nnearly as much pain in my legs, in fact my therapist took me off\ntraction about 2 weeks ago.\n\nGetting back to my original reason for this post...  Even if I can avoid\ntaking analgesic for headaches, I really can't avoid them entirely because\nI have other pain sources, that "force" me to use them (Oh, I forgot\nto mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery,\nbut I'm avoiding that too).  I find the migraines difficult to deal with,\noccassionally I have to take off work, but usually I can work, but at\na reduced capacity (I'm a systems engineer and do a lot of reading\nand writing).  When the pelvic pain is bad, I can't concentrate much,\nI usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes, because\nthe pain is so bothersome.  When the pain in my back is bad, it can\ncause severe burning in both legs, shooting pains in my legs, electric\nshock type of pain in my feet and toes, and basically when it gets bad\nI can't really sit at all.  Then I end up spending most of my time home\nand in bed.  So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines, the\nmigraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources.  I get a lot\nof migraines, an average of 3 to 4 a month, which last 1-3 days.\nI've taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me so\nI reduced the dosage), but I don't like the side effects (if I take\nmore than two I get diahrea).  If I get a very bad headache, I will\neventually take the cafergot.  My neurologist wasn't very helpful when\nI told him my problems with cafergot, he said that when sumatriptan\nbecomes available, I should try that.  I've tried several other medications\n(fiornal, midrin, fiornal with codeine, tegretol, and inderal) but\nthey either didn't work, or I couldn't tolerate them.  So what can I do?\nMy doctor's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the\npain, which I agree with most of the time, but not when I have a lot of\npain.  I've had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stopped\nonce from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely the\nsuccinylcholine), and I've already had surgery several times.\n\nAnyway, the point of what I'm saying is that even if analgesics can contribute\nto migraines, some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain.
Essential tremor is a progressive hereditary tremor that gets worse\nwhen the patient tries to use the effected member.  All limbs, vocal\ncords, and head can be involved.  Inderal is a beta-blocker and\nis usually effective in diminishing the tremor.  Alcohol and mysoline\nare also effective, but alcohol is too toxic to use as a treatment.\n-- \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGordon Banks  N3JXP      | "Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and\ngeb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon."

I was under the (possibly incorrect) assumption that most of the MSG on\nour foods was made from processing sugar beets. Is this not true? Are \nthere other sources of MSG?\n\nI am one of those folx who react, sometimes strongly, to MSG. However,\nI also react strongly to sodium chloride (table salt) in excess. Each\ncauses different symptoms except for the common one of rapid heartbeat\nand an uncomfortable feeling of pressure in my chest, upper left quadrant.

Purists often distinguish between "true" clubbing and "pseudo"\nclubbing, the difference being that with "true" clubbing the\nangle of the nail when viewed from the side is constantly\nnegative when proceeding distally (towards the fingertip).\nWith "pseudo" clubbing, the angle is initially positive, then\nnegative, which is the normal situation. "Real" internists\ncan talk for hours about clubbing. I'm limited to a couple\nof minutes.\n\nWhether this distinction has anything to do with reality is\nentirely unclear, but it is one of those things that internists\nlove to paw over during rounds. Supposedly, only "true" clubbing\nis associated with disease. The problem is that the list of\ndiseases associated with clubbing is quite long, and includes\nboth congenital conditions and acquired disease. Since many of\nthese diseases are associated with cardiopulmonary problems\nleading to right to left shunts and chronic hypoxemia, it is\nvery reasonable to get a chest xray. However, many of the \ncongenital abnormalities would only be diagnosed with a cardiac\ncatheterization. \n\nThe cause of clubbing is unclear, but presumably relates to\nsome factor causing blood vessels in the distal fingertip to\ndilate abnormally. \n\nClubbing is one of those things from an examination which is\na tipoff to do more extensive examination. Often, however,\nthe cause of the clubbing is quite apparent.

The fantasy was that he had found something of fundamental importance to\none of the hot questions of the day ('77).  He really had very little\nreason to believe it, other than raw hope.  By fantasy, I certainly don't\nmean Velikovskian manias.\n\n\nI'm not familiar with the history of this experiment, although, arguably,\nI should be.\n\n\nI think that it is enough if his contemporaries found the result surprising.\nThat's not what I'd quibble about.  What I'd like to know are Toricelli's\nreasons for doing his experiment; not the post hoc _constructed_ reasons,\nbut the thoughts in his head as he considered the problem.  It may be\nimpossible to know much about Toricelli's thoughts; that's too bad if\nit is so.  One of Root-Bernstein's services to science is that he has gone\nrooting about in Pasteur's and Fleming's (and other people's) notes, and has\ndiscovered some surprising clues about their motivations.  Pasteur never\npublicly admitted his plan to create mirror-image life, but the dreams are\nright there in his notebooks (finally public after many years), ready for\nanyone to read.  And I and my friends often have the most ridiculous\nreasons for pursuing results; one of my best came because I was mad at\na colleague for a poorly-written claim (I disproved the claim).\n\nOf course, Toricelli's case may be an example of a rarety: where the\nfantasy not only motivates the experiment, but turns out to be right\nin the end.\n\nMark
A friend of mine is having some symptoms and has asked me to post\nthe following information.\n\nA few weeks ago, she noticed that some of her hair was starting\nto fall out.  She would touch her head and strands of hair would\njust fall right out. (by the way, she is 29 or 30 years old).  \nIt continued to occur until she had a bald spot about the\nsize of a half dollar.  Since that time, she  has gotten two\nmore bald spots of the same size.  Other symptoms she's\ndescribed include:  several months of an irregular menstrual\ncycle (which is strange for her, because she has always been\nextremely regular); laryngitis every few days -- she will wake\nup one morning and have almost no voice, and then the next day\nit's fine; dizzy spells -- she claims that she's had 4 or 5\nvery bad dizzy spells early in the morning, including one that\nknocked her to the ground; and general fatigue.\n\nShe went to a dermatologist first who couldn't find any reason\nfor the symptoms and sent her to an internist who suspected\nthyroid problems.  He did the blood work and claims that everything\ncame back normal.  \n\nShe's very concerned and very confused.  Does anyone have any\nideas or suggestions?  I told her that I thought she should\nsee an endocrinologist.  Does that sound like the right idea?\n\n** By the way, in case you are going to ask...no, she has recently\ntaken any medications that would cause these symptoms...no, she hasn't\nrecently changed her hair products and she hasn't gotten a perm, \ncoloring, or other chemical process that might cause hair to fall\nout.

The reason I'm posting this article to this newsgroup is to:\n1. gather any information about this disorder from anyone who might\n   have recently been *e*ffected by it ( from being associated with\n   it or actually having this disorder ) and\n2. help me find out where I can access any medical literature associated\n   with seizures over the internet.\n\nRecently, I had a baby boy born with seizures which occured 12-15 hours\nafter birth. He was immediately transferred to a major hospital in Boston\nand has since been undergoing extensive drug treatment for his condition.\nThis has been a major learning experience for me and my wife not only in\nlearning the medical problems that faced our son but also in dealing with\nhospitals, procedures...etc.\n\nI don't want to go into a lot of detail, but his condition was termed \nquite severe at first then slowly he began to grow and put on weight\nas a normal baby would. He was put on the standard anti-convulsion drugs\nand that did not seem to help out. His MRI, EKG, cat-scans are all normal,\nbut the EEG's show alot of seizure activity. After many metabolic tests,\nbody structure tests, and infection/virus tests the doctors still do not\nknow quite what type of siezures he is having (although they do have alot\nof evidence that it is now pointing to infantile spasms ). This is where\nwe stand right now....
The following is from a critique of a "60 Minutes" presentation on MSG\n   which was aired on November 3rd, 1991.  The critique comes from THE TUFTS\n   DIET AND NUTRITION LETTER, February 1992.  [...edited for brevity...]\n\n	"Chances are good that if you watched '60 Minutes' last November\n	3rd [1991], you came away feeling MSG is bad for you. [...] In\n	the segment entitled 'No MSG,' for instance, show host Ed Bradley\n	makes alarming statements without adequately substantiating them\n	('millions are suffering a host of symptoms, and some get violently\n	sick'); peppers his report with sensational but clinically unproven\n	personal testimony...; and speaks of studies on MSG that make the\n	substance seem harmful without explaining just how inconclusive \n	those studies are.\n\n	Consider his making reference at the beginning of the program to\n	a study conducted at the Eastern Virginia Medical School in order\n	to back up his comment that there is 'a lot of evidence' that MSG,\n	a flavor enhancer in Chinese and other Asian cuisines as well as\n	in many supermarket items, causes headaches.  What he does NOT\n	make reference to is the fact that the study was performed not on\n	humans but on rabbits.\n\n	One of the researchers who conducted the study, pharmacologist\n	Patricia Williams, Ph.D., says it certainly is conceivable that\n	a small minority of people are sensitive enough to MSG to get \n	headaches from it.  'But,' she explains, 'the show probably \n	overemphasized the extent of the problem.'\n\n	A second lapse comes with mention of Dr. John Olney, a professor\n	at the Washington University School of Medicine who, Mr. Bradley\n	remarks, 'says that his 20 years of research with laboratory\n	animals shows MSG is a hazard for developing youngsters' because\n	it poses a threat of irreversible brain damage.  Dr. Olney's\n	research with lab animals does not 'show' anything about human\n	youngsters.\n\n	In fact, only under extreme circumsrtances did Dr. Olney's \n	experiments ever bring about any brain damage: when he injected\n	extremely high doses of MSG into rodents, completely bypassing \n	their digestive tracts and entering their bloodstreams more directly,\n	and when he used tubes to force-feed huge amounts of the substance\n	to very young animals on an empty stomach.  Of course, neither\n	of those procedures occurs with humans; they simply take in MSG \n	with food.  And most of what they take in is broken down by\n	enzymes in the wall of the small intestine, so that very little\n	reaches the bloodstream -- much to little, in fact, for human\n	blood levels of MSG to come anywhere near the high concentrations\n	found in Dr. Olney's lab animals.....\n\n	The World Health Organization appears to be very much aware of\n	that fact.  And so does the European Communities' Scientific\n	Committee for Food....Both, after examining numerous studies,\n	have concluded that MSG is safe.\n\n	Their determination makes sense, considering that MSG has never\n	been proven to cause all the symptoms that have been attributed\n	to it -- headaches, swelling, a tightness in the chest, and a\n	burning sensation, among others.  In fact, the most fail-safe\n	of clinical studies, the double-blind study..., has consistently\n	exonerated the much-maligned substance.\n\n	That's quite fortunate since the alleged hazardous component of\n	monosodium glutamate, glutamate, enters our systems whenever\n	we eat any food that contains protein.  The reason is that one\n	of the amino acids that make up protein, glutamic acid, is broken\n	down into glutamate during digestion.\n\n	It's a breakdown that occurs frequently.  Glutamic acid is the\n	most abundant of the 20 or so amino acids in the diet.  It makes\n	up about 15 percent of the protein in flesh foods, 20 percent in\n	milk, 25 percent in corn, and 29 percent in whole wheat.\n\n	That doesn't mean it's entirely unimaginable that a small number\n	of people have trouble metabolizing MSG properly and are therefore\n	sensitive to it...The consensus reached by large, international\n	professional organizations [is that MSG is safe], the same consensus\n	reached by the FDA and the biomedical community at large."

A bit more than a year ago, a hernia in my right groin was\ndiscovered.  It had produced a dull pain in that area.  The hernia\nwas repaired using the least intrusive (orthoscopic?) method and a\n"plug and patch".\n\nThe doctor considered the procedure a success.\n\nA few months later the same pain returned.  The doctor said that\nhe could find nothing wrong in the area of the hernia repair.\n\nNow the pain occurs more often.  My GP couldn't identify any\nspecific problem.  The surgen who performed the original procedure\nnow says that yes there is a "new" hernia in the same area and he\nsaid that he has to cut into the area for the repair this time.\n\nMy question to the net:  Is there a nonintrusive method to\ndetermine if in fact there is a hernia or if the pain is from\nsomething else?

Following a series of miscarriages, my wife was given a transfusion of\nmy white cells. (The theory as I understand it is that there is some kind\nof immune blocking that prevents the body from attacking the pregnancy as\nit normally would a "foreign" body. Where this blocking is deficient, the\nbody evicts the "intruder", resulting in a miscarriage. The white cells\napparently enhance the blocking capability.) Following the transfusion, she\nsuccessfully carried the next pregnancy to term, and Jake is now an active\n9 month-old who cannot wait to walk.\n     We're now thinking about having another child, but no one (including\nthe OBGYN who supervised the first transfusion) really seems to know\nwhether or not the transfusion process needs to be repeated for successive\npregnancies.\n     Is there anyone in net-land who has experience with this?\nThanks...Gene (and Jane and Jake)

Hello to everybody,\nI write here because I am kind of desperate. For about six weeks, I've been\nsuffering on pains in my left head side, the left leg and sometimes the left \narm. I made many tests (e.g. computer tomography, negative, lyme borreliosis,\nnegative, all electrolytes in the blood in their correct range), they're\nall o.K., so I should be healthy. As a matter of fact, I am not feeling so.\nI was also at a Neurologist's too, he considered me healthy too.\n\nThe blood tests have shown that I have little too much of Hemoglobin (17.5,\ncommon range is 14 to 17, I unfortunately do not know about the units).\nCould these hemi-sided pains be the result of this or of a also possible\nblock of the neck muscles ?\n\nI have no fever, and I am not feeling entirely sick, but neither entirely \nhealthy. \n\nPlease answer by direct email on <ghilardi@urz.unibas.ch>\n\nThanks for every hint
As I understood it, MSG *is* natural.  Isn't it found in \ntomatoes?\n\nAnyway, lots of people are terribly allergic to lots of natural\nthings; peanuts, onions, tomatoes, milk, etc.  Just because something\nis 'natural' doesn't mean it won't cause problems with some folks.\n\nAs for how foods taste:  If I'm not allergic to MSG and I like\nthe taste of it, why shouldn't I use it?  Saying I shouldn't use\nit is like saying I shouldn't eat spicy food because my neighbor\nhas an ulcer.\n\nPeople have long modified the taste of food by additives, whether\nthey be chiles, black pepper, salt, cream sauces, etc.  All of these\nthings cloud the flavor of the food.  Why do we bother with them?\nHow should food be tasted?  Isn't it better left to the diner?
As an animal science student, I know that a number of animals transfer\nimmunoglobin to thier young through thier milk.  In fact, a calf _must_\nhave a sufficient amount of colostrum (early milk) within 12 hours to\neffectively develop the immune system, since for the first (less than)\n24 hours the intestines are "open" to the IG passage.  My question is,\ndoes this apply to human infants to any degree?

Why \n should I?  My patients are happy. I'm happy. You and your peers seem \n to be the only miserable ones around bemoaning the steady loss of \n patients to the alternative camp.\n Just look at Europe. There has been a steady exodus from 'synthetic' \n medicine for over a decade now, and it'll be just a matter of time\n before more people on this continent will abandon their drug and white \n coat worship as well and visit different doctors for different needs.\n\nGR>     You see Ron, the point isn't whether YOU and your patients are\nGR>  convinced that whatever it is you do works; it's whether what you do is\nGR>  MORE effective in similar cases (of whatever it is you think you are\nGR>  treating) than cupping, bloodletting, and placebo.\n\n This is very interesting. I have come exactly to the same conclusions\n but in regards to *conventional* medicine.\n\n You see, I don't just treat little old ladies that wouldn't know any\n different of what is being done, but a bulk of my patients consist of\n teachers, lawyers, judges, nurses, accountants, university graduates,\n and various health practitioners.\n If these people have gotten results with my method after having been\n unsuccessful with yours or their own, I certainly wouldn't lose any \n sleep over whether you or your peers approve of my treatments --- \n let's face it, with all the blunders committed by "scientific" MDs \n over the years, I know a lot of people who hold your *scientific* \n method in much lower esteem than they hold mine!\n\nGR>  As far as we know ayurveda = crystals = homeopathy = Ron Roth\nGR>  which may all equal placebo administered with appropriate\nGR>  trappings...\n     \n  Sorry, but I'm not familiar OR interested with what appears to be \n 'NEW AGE' medicine (ayurveda, crystals), with the exception of homeo-\n pathy, of which I took a course. But Gordon, you already knew that -\n you just wanted to make my system look a bit more far out, right?\n \n I use homeopathy very little, since my cellular test (EMR) is hard to\n beat for accuracy and minerals are more predictable, while homeopathy\n does have a problem with reliability, especially in acute conditions.\n An exception perhaps are homeopathic nosodes which act fairly quickly\n and are more dependable in certain viral or bacterial situations. \n\nGR>  My colleagues and I spend hours debating study design\nGR>  and results, even of therapies currently accepted as "standard".\nGR>  As good (well, adequate) scientists, we are prepared, *if \nGR>  presented with appropriate data*, to abandon our most deeply held \nGR>  beliefs in favor of new ideas.\n\n I have met the challenges of hundreds of sceptics by verifying the\n accuracy of measuring their mineral status to their total satisfac-\n tion --- in other words EVERYONE INVOLVED is happy!\n If you were to cook a meal, would you worry over whether EVERYONE \n in this world would find it to their liking, or only those that end \n up eating it?\n Since I have financed every research project that I have undertaken \n entirely myself, I don't need to follow any of your rules or guide-\n lines to satisfy any aspects of a grant application, which YOU may \n have to; neither am I concerned of whether or not my study designs \n meet your or anyone else's criteria or acceptance. \n\nGR>    Sorry Ron, if conviction were the ruler of truth, a flat Earth would\nGR>  still be the center of the Universe and epilepsy a curse of the gods.\n                         \n I think there would be more justification for an uneducated person\n growing up in an uncivilized environment to believe in a flat earth,\n than for a civilized, well educated and scientifically trained mind\n to follow the doctrine of evolution.\n Genetic engineering of course is now the final frontier to show God\n how it is (properly) done. Now we've become capable of creating our\n own paradise and give disease (and God) the boot, right?\n\n But just before we get rid of Him for good, perhaps He could leave us\n some pointers on how to solve a couple of tiny problems, such as war, \n poverty, racism, crime, riots, substance abuse...

Um, I hate to break this to you, but article numbers are unique per site.\nThey have no meaning on other machines.\n\n\nYou mean the responses some of which pointed to double-blind tests\nwhich show no such "chinese restaurant effect" unique to MSG\n(it's elicited by the placebo as well.)\n\n\nLike youself?  Someone who can read a scientific paper and apparently\ncome away from it with bizarrely cracked ideas which have nothing to\ndo with the use of this substance in human nutrition?\n\n\nNo, it's undisputed in the literature that glutamate is an amino acid\nwhich is an excitatory neurotransmitter.  There is also evidence that\nexcessive release of glutamate may be involved in the pathology of certain\nconditions like stroke, drowning and Lou Gehrig's disease, just to name a few.\nThis is a completely different issue than the use of this ubiquitous amino acid\nin foods.  People are not receiving intra-ventricular injections of glutamate.\n\n\nI don't know about premier, but it's certainly an important one.\n\n\nSez you.  Such an effect in humans has not been demonstrated in any\ncontrolled studies.  Infant mice and other models are useful as far\nas they go, but they're not relevant to the matter at hand.  Which is\nnot to say that I favor its use in things like baby food--a patently\nridiculous use of the additive.  But we have no reason to believe\nthat MSG in the diet effects humans adversely.\n\n\nWrong.  Do you know how much aspartate or phenylalanine is in a soft drink?\nMilligrams worth.  Compare that to a glass of milk.  Do you know how much\nglutamate is present in most protein-containing foods compared to that\nadded by the use of MSG?\n\n\nNotice the subtle covering of her ass here: "anyone _with a sensitivity_..."\nWe're disputing the size of that class.\n\n\nImpeccable.  There most certainly is a dispute.

Why do you think he would be called a quack?  The quacks don't do cultures.\nThey poo-poo doing more lab tests:  "this is Lyme, believe me, I've\nseen it many times.  The lab tests aren't accurate.  We'll treat it\nnow."  Also, is Dr. N's practice almost exclusively devoted to treating\nLyme patients?  I don't know *any* orthopedic surgeons who fit this\npattern.  They are usually GPs.\n-- \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGordon Banks  N3JXP      | "Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and\ngeb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon."
My girlfriend just started taking Imitrex for her migraine headaches.  Her\nneurologist diagnosed her as having depression and suffering from rebound\nheadaches due to daily doses of analgesics.  She stopped taking all\nanalgesics and caffine as of last Thursday (4/15).  The weekend was pretty\nbad, but she made it through with the help of Imitrex about every 18 hours.\n Her third injection of Imitrex, during the worst of the withdrawl on\nFriday and six hours after the first of the day, left her very sick.  Skin\nwas flushed, sweating, vomiting and had severe headache pain.  It subsided\nin an hour or so.  Since then, she has been taking Imitrex as needed to\ncontrol the pain.  Immediately after taking it, she has increased head pain\nfor ten minutes, dizziness and mild nausea and mild chest pains.  A friend\nof hers mentioned that her doctor was wary of Imitrex because it had caused\nheart attacks in several people.  Apparently the mild chest pains were\ncommon in these other people prior to there attacks.  Is this just rumor? \nHas anyone else heard of these symptoms?  My girlfriend also has Mitral\nValve Prolapse.
Serum, actually, but plasma numbers are the same.  Whole blood\n	numbers for humans tend to be somewhat lower (roughly 5 to 10 \n	percent lower).  I find the following range for whole blood in\n	FUNDAMENTALS OF CLINICAL CHEMISTRY: N. W. Teitz, editor; W. B.\n	Saunders, 1987:\n\n	Human glucose (whole blood, fasting levels) --> 60 - 95 mg./dL.\n\n\n	Indeed, they do measure whole blood levels, although they are not\n	as accurate as a serum test done in a laboratory.  One problem is\n	that cells in the sample continue to metabolize glucose after the\n	sample is drawn, reducing the apparent level.  According to Teitz,\n	however, results compare "reasonably well" with laboratory results,\n	although "values below 80 mg./dL. tend to be lower with strip tests,\n	whereas values above 240 mg./dL. can be very erratic."\n\n\n	As stated above, whole blood levels tend to be roughly 5 to 10 \n	percent lower than serum levels.  Sample freshness will affect\n	whole blood levels, however.  I don't believe there is a well-\n	defined "conversion factor," since cell metabolism will affect\n	samples to varying degrees.  The serum/plasma test is much \n	preferred for any except general "ball park" testing.
Sjogren's syndrome has been known to induce dryness in vaginal tissue as well\nas induce primary biliary cirrhosis. Otherwise the abdominal swelling could be\ndue to a complication of Sjogren's known as pseudolymphoma which *can* produce\na splenomegaly (enlarged spleen). She should definitely see a rheumatologist.\n\nSince you don't mention skin disorder, anemia, or joint pain you'd probably\nrule out erythema nodosum or scleroderma.\n\nJosh\nbackon@VMS.HUJI.AC.IL
Endometriosis is where cells that would normally be lining the uteris exist\noutside the uteris.  Sometimes this causes problems, often it doesn't.\nThere is generally no need to remove pockets of endometriosis unless they are\ncausing other problems.  One lady I know had Endometriosis in an ovary.  \nThis caused her a _great_ deal of pain.  Another lady I know has an     \nendometrial cyst in her abdominal wall; she is not having it removed.\n\nThe American Fertility Society has information on this and they probably \nmaintain a list of physicians in all parts of the continent that deal with\nendometriosis.

Herman, I would think you of all people would/could distinguish\nbetween "health" and "treatment of disease." All the prevention\nmedicine people preach this all the time. You cannot buy health.\nYou can buy treatment of disease, assuming you are lucky enough\nto have a disease which can be treated. A rich person with a\nterminal disease is a bit out of luck. There is no such thing\nas "adequately covered" and there never will be. \n\nAnd for what it's worth, I'll be the first to admit that all my\npatients die.

I recall that the issue is that fat on the meat liquifies and then\ndrips down onto the hot elements--whatever they are--that the extreme\nheat then catalyzes something in the fat into one or more\ncarcinogens which then are carried back up onto the meat in the smoke.

If she is having problems with fresh vegetables, the guess is that there\nis some obstruction of the intestine.  Without knowing more it is not\npossible to say whether the obstruction is permanent due to scarring,\nor temporary due to swelling of inflammed intestine.  In general, there are\nno dietary limitations in patients with Crohn's except as they relate\nto obstruction.  There is no evidence that any foods will bring on \nrecurrence of Crohn's.  It is important to distinguish recurrence from\nrecurrent symptoms.  A physician would think of new inflammation as \nrecurrence, while pains from raw veggies just imply a narrowing of the\nintestine.  \n\nYour friend should look into membership in the Crohn's and Colitis \nFoundation of America.   1-800-932-2423\n\nGood luck to your friend.
I agree that some specialties have gotten way out of line.  The main\nproblem is the payment method for procedures rather than time distorts\nthe system.  I hope they will fix that.  But I'm afraid, as usual,\nthe local doc is going to take the brunt.  People grouse about paying\n$50 to see their home doctor in his office, but don't mind paying\n$20,000 to have brain surgery.

When it got bad, I would lose my ability to read.\n\nThe differential diagnosis between migraine and non-migranous pain\nis not *always* important, because some therapies are effective in\nboth (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline,\nnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen).  Other\ntherapies may be more specific: beta-blockers such as propranolol\nwork better in migraine than tension-type headache.\n\nThe most important thing, from your perspective, is that you got\nrelief.  Also, please understand that a diagnosis other than\nmigraine does not necessarily mean "psychogenic"; I suspect that\norganic factors play as large a role in tension-type headache as in\nmigraine.
Dyer, you're rude. Medicine is not a totallly scientific endevour. It's\noften practiced in a disorganized manner. Most early treatment of\nnon-life threatening illness is done on a guess, hazarded after anecdotal\nevidence given by the patient. It's an educated guess, by a trained person,\nbut it's still no more than a guess.\nIt's cheaper and simpler to medicate first and only deal further with those\npeople who don't respond.\n\nThere are diseases that haven't been described yet and the root cause of many\ndiseases now described aren't known. (Read a book on gastroenterology\nsometime if you want to see a lot of them.) After scientific methods have\nrun out then it's the patient's freedom of choice to try any experimental\nmethod they choose. And it's well recognized by many doctors that medicine\ndoesn't have all the answers.\n\nThis person said that they had relief by taking the medicine. Maybe it's a\nmiracle cure, maybe it's valid. How do you know?  \n\nYou might argue with the reasoning, the conclusions. But your disparaging\nattack is unwarranted. Why don't you present an convincing argument for you\nr beliefs, instead of wasting our time in an ad hominem attack.
: Am I justified in being pissed off at this doctor?\n: \n: Last Saturday evening my 6 year old son cut his finger badly with a knife.\n: I took him to a local "Urgent and General Care" clinic at 5:50 pm.  The \n: clinic was open till 6:00 pm.  The receptionist went to the back and told the \n: doctor that we were there, and came back and told us the doctor would not \n: see us because she had someplace to go at 6:00 and did not want to be delayed \n: here.  During the next few minutes, in response to my questions, with several \n: trips to the back room, the receptionist told me:\n: 	- the doctor was doing paperwork in the back,\n: 	- the doctor would not even look at his finger to advise us on going\n: 	  to the emergency room;\n: 	- the doctor would not even speak to me;\n: 	- she would not tell me the doctor's name, or her own name;\n: 	- when asked who is in charge of the clinic, she said "I don't know."\n: \n: I realize that a private clinic is not the same as an emergency room, but\n: I was quite angry at being turned away because the doctor did not want to\n: be bothered.  My son did get three stitches at the emergency room.  \n\nSpeaking as a physician who works in an urgent care center, the above\nbehavior is completely inappropriate. If a patient who requires extensive\ncare shows up at the last minute, we always see them and give them appropriate\ncare. It is reasonable for a clinic to refuse to see patients outside of its\nposted hours, but what you describe is misbehavior. Ask to speak to the\nclinic director, and complain. Whatever their attitude, they have nothing to\ngain from angering patients.
No, there is something called the "Delany Amendment" which makes carcinogenic\nfood additives illegal in any amount.  This was passed by Congress in the\n1950's, before stuff like mass spectrometry became available, which increased\ndetectable levels of substances by a couple orders of magnitude.\n\nThis is why things like cyclamates and Red #2 were banned.  They are very\nweakly carcinogenic in huge quantities in rats, so under the Act they are\nbanned.\n\nThis also applies to natural carcinogens.  Some of you might remember a\ntime back in the 1960's when root beer suddenly stopped tasting so good,\nand never tasted so good again.  That was the time when safrole was banned.\nThis is the active flavoring ingredient in sassafras leaves.\n\nIf it were possible to market a root beer good like the old days, someone\nwould do it, in order to make money.  The fact that no one does it indicates\nthat enforcement is still in effect.
It isn't that rare, actually.  Many cases that are called Parkinson's\nDisease turn out on autopsy to be SND.

Several years ago I tried to commit a patient who was growing Salmonella out of his\nstool, blood, and an open ulcer for treatment. The idea was that the guy was a\nwalking public health risk, and that forcing him to receive IV antibiotics for\na few days was in the public interest. I will make a long story short by saying\nthat the judge laughed at my idea, yelled at me for wasting his time, and let\nthe guy go.\n\nI found out that tuberculosis appears to be the only MEDICAL (as oppsed to psychiatric)\ncondition that one can be committed for, and this is because very specific laws were\nenacted many years ago regarding tb.

I think that's the correct spelling..\n	I am looking for any information/supplies that will allow\ndo-it-yourselfers to take Krillean Pictures. I'm thinking\nthat education suppliers for schools might have a appartus for\nsale, but I don't know any of the companies. Any info is greatly\nappreciated.\n	In case you don't know, Krillean Photography, to the best of my\nknowledge, involves taking pictures of an (most of the time) organic\nobject between charged plates. The picture will show energy patterns\nor spikes around the object photographed, and depending on what type\nof object it is, the spikes or energy patterns will vary. One might\nextrapolate here and say that this proves that every object within\nthe universe (as we know it) has its own energy signature.
A friend of mine has a trouble with her ears ringing.  The ringing is so loud\nthat she has great difficulty sleeping at night.  She says that she hasn't \nhad a normal night's sleep in about 6 months (she looks like it too :-().\nThis is making her depressed so her doctor has put her on anti-depressants.\n\nThe ringing started rather suddenly about 6 months ago.  She is quickly losing\nsleep, social life and sanity over this.\n\nDoes anyone know of any treatments for this?  Any experience?  Coping\nmechanisms?  Any opinions on the anti-depressant drugs?
Also, don't forget that it's better for your health to enjoy your steak\nthan to resent your sprouts ...
Hi All,\n\nWould anyone out there in 'net-land' happen to have an\nauthentic, sure-fire way of making this great sauce that\nis used to adorn Gyro's and Souvlaki?\n\nThanks,
someone wrote in expressing concern about getting AIDS from acupuncture\n   needles.....\n\nUnless your friend is sharing fluids with their acupuncturist who               \nthemselves has AIDS..it is unlikely (not impossible) they will get AIDS         \nfrom acupuncture needles. Generally, even if accidently inoculated, the normal\nimmune response should be enough to effectively handle the minimal contaminant \ninvolved with acupuncture needle insertion. \n\nMost acupuncturists use disposable needles...use once and throw away. They      \ndo this because you are not the only one concerned about transmission of \ndiseases via this route...so it's good business to advertise "disposable needlesused here." These needles tend to be of a lower quality however, \nbeing poorly manufactured and too "sharp" in my opinion. They tend to snag bloodvessels on insertion compared to higher quality needles.                                                                        \nIf I choose to use acupuncture for a given complaint, that patient will get \ntheir own set of new needles which are sterilized between treatments.      \nThe risk here for hepatitis, HIV, etc. transmission is that I could mistakenly \nuse an infected persons needles accidently on the wrong              \npatient...but clear labelling and paying attention all but eliminates \nthis risk. Better quality needles tend to "slide" past vessels and            \nnerves avoiding unpleasant painful snags..and hematomas...so I use them.                        \nAcupuncture needles come in many lengths and thicknesses...but they are all \nsolid when compared to their injection-style cousins. In China, herbal solutionsand western pharmaceuticals are occasionally injected into \nmeridian points purported to have TCM physiologic effects and so require \nthe same hollow needles used for injecting fluid medicine. This means...thinkingtiny...that a samll amount of tissue, the diameter of the needle bore, will be \ninjected into the body as it would  be in a typical "shot." when the skin is \npuntured. On the other hand when the solid \nacupuncture needle is inserted, the skin tends to "squeeze" the needle \nfrom the tip to the level of insertion such that any 'cooties' that \nhaven't been schmeared away with alcohol before insertion, tend to remain \non the surface of the skin minimizing invasion from the exterior. \n\nOf course in TCM...the body's exterior is protected by the Wei (Protective) Qi..so infection is unlikely....or in other words...there is a normal inflammatory \nand immune response that accompanies tissue damage incurred at the puncture \nsite.\n\n\nWhile I'm fairly certain your friend will not have a transferable disease \ntransmitted to them via acupuncture needle insertion, I would like to know for \nwhat complaint they have consulted the acupuncturist...not to know  if it would be harmful.. but to know if it would be helpful.
How about posting one of her replies to your letters?
Sometimes I have a problem with doctor's prescribing medicine like\nthis.  I of course don't know the exact situation, and\nanti-depressants may work, but it isn't helping the ringing at all, is it?\n\n\n\nMine started about three years back.  Turns out I have tinnitus\nbilateral (translation: ringing in both ears, basically ;).  If this\nis what it is, she'll probably get used to it.  It would keep me up\nand drive me nuts too, but nowadays, I have to plug both my ears with\nmy fingers to check to see if they are ringing.  Usually they are, but\nyou get so used to it, it just gets tuned out.  Yes, this is what I've\nread about it... not just from my own personal experience.\n\n\n\nMillions have it, according to my physician.  You just learn to cope\nwith it (like I mentioned earlier) by ignoring it.  It eventually\nbecomes unconscious.\n\nThe doc also said it could be caused by diet (ie: too much caffeine)\nand stress, but I haven't changed my lifestyle much, and it just comes\nand goes (it is always there somewhat, but now I rarely notice it when\nit really "kicks in").\n\nAlso, it doesn't necessarily mean there is any hearing loss, either\ncaused by it or causing it.  I had an ENT (ear/nose/throat) exam, and\npassed.  In fact, my hearing is quite good considering I don't take as\ngood of care of my hearing as I should.\n\nHer reaction is normal.  If it is tinnitus, chances are good she'll\nbegin to not even notice it.  \n\nThis info is taken mostly from a few "experts", my own experience, and\nsome readings (sorry, it was a few years back and don't have any\nspecifics handy).

-*----\nI think that part of the problem is that I have proposed a\ndefinition of science that I intended to be interpreted broadly\nand that Lee Lady has interpreted fairly narrowly.  My definition\nis this: Science is the investigation of the empirical that avoids\nmistakes in reasoning and methodology discovered from previous\n\n\nUnless one classifies "thinking and informal exploration" as a\nmistake, they fall under my definition.  I hope no one would\nconsider speculation, thinking, and informal exploration as\nunscientific.  \n\n\nHere is where I think we are talking at cross-purposes.  It is not\nclear to me that the kind of definition I have proposed should be\ntaken as describing what "science is mainly about."  Consider,\nfor example, a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking\na backbone.  This fairly tells what is an invertebrate and\nwhat is not an invertebrate, but it hardly tells you what\ninvertebrates are all about.  One can read this definition and\nstill not know that 95% of all animal species are invertebrates,\nthat invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form, that\nsome invertebrate groups -- such as insects and nematodes -- are\nubiquitous in all ecosystems, etc.  In short, knowing the\ndefinition of invertebrates does *not* tell one what they are\n"mainly about."\n\nThe misunderstanding here is my fault.  I did not give sufficient\ncontext for people to understand my proposed definition.\n\n\nI agree on both counts.  As an example of the second, it would only\ntake a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians\nthat a treatment was effective, despite a lack of controls.  \n\nAs to the first, I do not think it is useful to talk about\n"absolute scientific truth."  I think it is more useful to talk\nabout the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the\nkinds of evidence IN PARTICULAR FIELDS that in the past have\nproven faulty or reliable.  The latter is obviously a matter of\ndegree, and in each field, practitioners try to discover the\nrelevance of different kinds of evidence.  \n\nOne of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as\npsuedo-science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion\nregarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim,\nthe kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it, and the\nhistorical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence\nare given more weight than others.  It is perfectly alright to\nspeculate.  I have read quite a few refereed papers that\nspeculated left and right.  But the authors were careful to\nidentify the notions as speculative, to list what little evidence\nwas presently available for them, and to describe how research\ncould proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to\nuncover its problems.  Often what distinguishes whether a paper\nof this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the\nauthor sets the context and paves the way for future work.  (It\nis in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail.)\n\n\nI think a lot of scientists steer away from things that --\ndeserving or not -- garner a patina of kookiness.  When\nproponents of some practice see no value in more careful\ninvestigation of that practice, that sets alarms ringing in many\nresearchers' minds.  \n\nThis is unfortunate, because there is undoubtedly some\nintersection between things that are worth investigating and\nthings that are advocated by those who seem careless or\nunreasonable in their advocacy.  On the other hand, I can\nunderstand why many scientists would just as soon select other\ndirections for research.  As Gordon Banks has pointed out, no one\nwants to become this generation's Rhine.\n\n\nI think this is absurd.  \n\n\nI wonder why the results were not published.  In my field,\ndissertation results are typically summarized in papers that are\nsubmitted to journals.  Often the papers are accepted for\npublication before the dissertation is finished.  (This certainly\neases one's defense.)\n\nFinally, I hope Lee Lady will forgive me from commenting either\non NLP or the discussion of it in sci.psychology.  I know little\nabout either and so have nothing to offer.
I am posting to this group in hopes of finding someone out there in\nnetwork newsland who has heard of something similar to what I am going\nto describe here.  I have a fourteen year old daugter who experienced\na seizure on November 3, 1992 at 6:45AM after eating Kellog's Frosted\nFlakes.  She is perfectly healthy, had never experienced anything like\nthis before, and there is no history of seizures in either side of the\nfamily.  All the tests (EEG, MRI, EKG) came out negative so the decision\nwas made to do nothing and just wait to see if it happened again.\n\nWell, we were going along fine and the other morning, April 5, she had\na bowl of another Kellog's frosted kind of cereal, Fruit Loops (I am\nembarrassed to admit that I even bought that junk but every once\nin a while...) So I pour it in her bowl and think "Oh, oh, this is the\nsame kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure."  Ten \nminutes later she had a full blown seizures. This was her first exposure\nto a sugar coated cereal since the last seizure.\n\nWhen I mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason for\nthe seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea.  Now\nafter this second episode, so similar in nature to the first, even\nhe is scratching his head.  Once again her EEG looks normal which I\nunderstand can happen even when a person has a seizure.\n\nOnce again we are waiting. I have been thinking that it would be good\nto get to as large a group as possible to see if anyone has any\nexperience with this kind of thing.  I know that members of the medical\ncommunity are sometimes loathe to admit the importance that diet and\nfoods play in our general health and well-being.  Anyway, as you can\nguess, I am worried sick about this, and would appreciate any ideas\nanyone out there has.  Sorry to be so wordy but I wanted to really get\nacross what is going on here.\n\nThanks.
Gee!  Maybe I've misjudged you, Russell.  Anyone who agrees with something \nI say can't be all bad.  ;-)\n\nSeriously, I'm not sure whether I misjudged you or not, in one respect.  \nI still have a major problem, though, with your insistence that science \nis mainly about avoiding mistakes.  And I still disagree with your \ncontention that nobody who doesn't use methods deemed "scientific" \ncan possibly know what's true and what's not.  \n\n\nOkay, so let's see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees \nof certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully \ncontrolled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the \nextent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain \ntreatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even \nif uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that\na treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope for\nfrom investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support.\nIn this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible\nbut to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are\nqualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing.\n\nSECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of \nevidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal.  \n\n\nI come to this dispute about what science is  not only as a\nmathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (and\noccasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Much\nof the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized as\ninformal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For years\nnow I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to\njust take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some of\nthe videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not for\nthe purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at the\nNLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information from\nsubjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of\nscientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of the\n*questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific\ninvestigation.\n\nOver and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  "If this\nhasn't been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical\nresearch then it can't be of any interest to us."  \n\nTo me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme "There've got to\nbe controlled studies" position is an NLP technique called the Fast\nPhobia/Trauma Cure.\n\nSimple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world's most \nimportant psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is that \nit doesn't take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell \nwhen someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simple \nvisualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim that\nit can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence is\nuseful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentially\na variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral\ntherapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once\n(or, in the case of PTSD, once for each traumatic incident).  The\nprocess doesn't need to be repeated and the subject doesn't need to\npractice it over again at home.\n\nNow to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure. \n(Especially if, as NLPers claim, the success rate is extremely high.)  \nTake someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them up \nto a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15 \nminutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up to \nthe balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in a \nfew weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long term \nfollow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of view \neven a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case, \nthere are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the best \nof my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversed \nafter holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure, incidentally, was done\nwith a slightly different NLP technique, before I learned of the Fast \nPhobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now, I enjoy living on the 17th\nfloor of my building and having a large balcony.)  \n\nThe folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to\nmake this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study\nwill be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners, \nmany of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill \nafford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because \nthe whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they're not part of the\nscientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain \nfrom scientific acceptance.) \n\nThe Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical \npsychology establishment is still saying "We don't have any way of \nknowing that it's effective."  \n\nThese academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate \nas anyone could want, of course, but they say  "Why should I prove your \ntheory?"  and  "The burden of proof is on the one making the claim."  \nOne academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely \nunscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't \nbeen described in a scientific journal.  (It's described in a number of \nbooks and I've posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much \ndetail as I'm capable of.)  \n\nActually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with \nfavorable results), but it's apparently not acceptable because it's a\ndoctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.\n\nTo me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it.  \nThis is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about "doctrinnaire" \nattitudes about science.  \n\nNow maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, Russell.  \nIf so, I apologize. \n \n--\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.
Nobody is saying that you shouldn't be allowed to use msg.  Just\ndon't force it on others. If you have food that you want to \nenhance with msg just put the MSG on the table like salt.  It is\nthen the option of the eater to use it.  If you make a commerical\nproduct, just leave it out. You can include a packet (like some\nsalt packets) if you desire.\n\nSalt, pepper, mustard, ketchup, pickles ..... are table options.\nTreat MSG the same way.  I wouldn't shove my condiments down your\nthroat, don't shove yours down mine.\n\nWFL

Obesssive Compulsive Disorder (not to be confused with Obsessive Compulsive\n_Personality_ Disorder !) is an acute anxiety disorder characterized by\neither obsessions (persistent intrusive thoughts that cause anxiety when\nnot entertained), or compulsions (repetitive, ritualistic actions that\nsimilarly cause intense psychological discomfort when resisted).  \n\nOCD is often associated with certain forms of depression.  \n\nExamples of obsessive thoughts are repeated impulses to kill a loved\none (though not accompanied by anger), or a religious person having \nrecurrent blasphemous thoughts.  Generally, the individual attempts to ignore\nor suppress the intrusive thoughts by engaging in other activities.  \nThe individual realizes that the thoughts originate from the own mind, rather\nthan being from an external source.\n\nExamples of compulsive actions are constant repetitive hand washing,\nor other activity that is not realistically related to alleviating a\nsource of the anxiety.\n\nIn OCD, the obsessions or compulsions are highly distressing to the\nindividual, take an hour or more per day, and significantly impair their\ndaily routine and social relationships.\n\nTreatments include psychotherapy, behavioral methods, and sometimes\ncertain anti-depressants which have recently been found effective in alleviating\nobsessions and compulsions.\n\nThe standard diagnostic code for OCD, if you want to look it up in the\nDSM-III manual of psychiatric diagnosis is 300.30 .\n\n						kind regards,
I am looking for current sources for lists of all the home\nmedical tests currently legally available.\nI believe this trend of allowing tests at home where\nfeasible, decreased medical costs by a factor of 10 or\nmore and allows the patient some time and privacy to\nconsider the best action from the results of such tests.\nIn fact I believe home medical tests and certain basic\ntests for serious diseases such as cancer, heart disease,\nshould be offered free to the American public.\nThis could actually help to reduce national medical costs\nsince many would have an earlier opportunity to know\nabout and work toward recuperation or cure.\nMike Romano
I don't react to scallops, but did have discomforts with clam juice\nserved at (American) waterfront seafood bars.  I don't know whether\nthe juice is homemade or from cans.\n\nThe following is my first encounter with the Chinese Restaurant\nSyndrome.  Ten years ago, about an hour after having Won Ton Soup I\ncollapsed in a chair with my face feeling puffed up, my scalp\ntingling, my feet too weak to stand up.  The symptoms lasted for about\n20 minutes.  Determined to find out the cause of my first reaction, I\nwent back to the Chinese restuarant and ordered the same dish.  The\nsame thing happened.  A quick look inside the kitchen revealed nothing\nout of the ordinary.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I didn't threaten to rip your lips off, did I?\nSnort.\n\n\nDuh.\n\n\nListen: thrush is a recognized clinical syndrome with definite\ncharacteristics.  If you have thrush, you have thrush, because you can\nsee the lesions and do a culture and when you treat it, it generally\nresponds well, if you're not otherwise immunocompromised.

Not that new.  20 years ago, we had drug addicts harboring active TB\nthat was resistant to everything (in Chicago).  The difference now\nis that such strains have become virulent.  In the old days, such\nTB was weak.  It didn't spread to other people very easily and just\ninfected the one person in whom it developed (because of non-compliance\nwith medications).  Non-compliance and development of resistant strains\nhas been a problem for a very long time.  That is why we have like 9\ndrugs against TB.  There is always a need to develop new ones due to\nsuch strains.  Now, however, with a virulent resistant strain, we\nare in more trouble, and measures to assure compliance may be necessary\neven if they entail force.\n\n-- \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGordon Banks  N3JXP      | "Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and\ngeb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon."
I know this is a little weird, but I know that World magazine (you know,\nNational Geo. for children) did a very simple and concise article on Kirlian\nphotography.  They had some neat pictures, too.  A friend of mine's mother had\na book on Kirlian photography, only it's photographs took a radiologist to \ninterpret.  They (World magazine) warned us all that it was very dangerous,\nprobably to stop curious children from experimenting with it.  Mind you, this\nwas 10 years ago, at least.  (And boy, does that say something about my age)
And to add further fuel to the flame war, I read about 20 years ago that\nthe "natural" MSG - extracted from the sources you mention above - does not\ncause the reported aftereffects; it's only that nasty "artificial" MSG -\nextracted from coal tar or whatever - that causes Chinese Restaurant\nSyndrome.  I find this pretty hard to believe; has anyone else heard it?
INTENSIVE JAPANESE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH THIS SUMMER\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n\nThe University of Pittsburgh is offering two intensive Japanese language\ncourses this summer.  Both courses, Intensive Elementary Japanese and \nIntensive Intermediate Japanese, are ten week, ten credit courses \neach equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study.  They begin \nJune 7 and end August 13.  The courses meet five days per week, five hours \nper day.  There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course.  \nFellowships available for science and engineering students.  Contact \nSteven Brener, Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology\nManagement Program, at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or\naddress below.  \nALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY, THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO \nUNIVERSITY STUDENTS.\n\n\n\n  \n\n#######################################################################\n#################   New Program Announcement   ########################\n#######################################################################\n\n\n            JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\nThe Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a new\nprogram jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon \nUniversity.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific \ncommunitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and \nJanuary 1994.\n\n\nPROGRAM OBJECTIVES\nThe program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the \nUnited States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers\nexperience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is \nfacilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and\nlaboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop\nlong-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.\n\n\nPROGRAM DESIGN\nTo fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to \ndevelop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and\nits culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:\n\n1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE\nSeveral Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses\ndesigned to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a\nrelatively short time.\n\n2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE\nA particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the\ncultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in \nmanufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a \nvariety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology,\nSociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums\nwill be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or \nresearch facilities in the United States will be scheduled.\n\n\n3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN\nUpon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU, \nparticipants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe,\nand participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan\nwill generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.\n\n\nFELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL AS\nSTIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.\n\n        FOR MORE INFORMATION AND APPLICATION MATERIALS CONTACT\n\nSTEVEN BRENER				SUSIE BROWN\nJSTMP					Carnegie Mellon University, GSIA\nUniversity of Pittsburgh		Pittsburgh, PA 15213-3890\n4E25 Forbes Quadrangle			Telephone: (412) 268-7806\nPittsburgh, PA 15260			FAX:	   (412) 268-8163\nTelephone: (412) 648-7414		\nFAX:       (412) 648-2199		\n\n############################################################################\n############################################################################ \n\n\nInterested individuals, companies and institutions should respond by phone or\nmail.

GB> From: geb@cs.pitt.edu (Gordon Banks)\nGB> >(I am excepting migraine, which is arguably neurologic).\nGB> I hope you meant "inarguably".\n\nGiven the choice, I would rather argue <g>.\n\nNo arguments about migranous aura; in fact, current best evidence is\nthat aura is intrinsicially neuronal (a la spreading depression of\nLeao) rather than vascular (something causing vasoconstriction and\nsecondary neuronal ischemia).\n\nMigraine without aura, however, is a fuzzier issue.  There do not\nseem to be objectively measurable changes in brain function.  The\nCopenhagen mafia (Lauritzen, Olesen, et al) have done local CBF\nstudies on migraine without aura, and (unlike migraine with aura,\nbut like tension-type) they found no changes in LCBF.\n\nFrom one (absurd) perspective, *all* pain is neurologic, because in\nthe absence of a nervous system, there would not be pain.  From\nanother (tautologic) perspective, any disease is in the domain of\nthe specialty that treats it.  Neurologists treat headache,\ntherefore (at least in the USA) headache is neurologic.\n\nWhether neurologic or not, nobody would disagree that disabling\nheadaches are common.  Perhaps my fee-for-service neurologic\ncolleagues, scrounging for cases, want all the headache patients\nthey can get.  Working on a salary, however, I would rather not fill\nmy office with patients holding their heads in pain.
I recently had a case of shingles and my doctors wanted to give me\nintravenous Acyclovir.\n\nIt was a pain finding IV sites in my arms...can I have some facts about\nhow advantageous it is to give intravenous antibiotics rather than oral?
I'm not sure about that.  Did you see the "poll" they took that showed\nthat most people thought physicians should be paid $80,000 per year\ntops?  That's all I make, but I doubt that most physicians are going\nto work very hard for that kind of bread.  Many wouldn't be able\nto service their med school debts on that.  Mike Royko had a good\ncolumn about it.\n\n-- \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGordon Banks  N3JXP      | "Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and\ngeb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon."
Yeah, but the problem with holding up the "extra-rational" examples as\nexemplars, or as refutations of well founded methodology, is that you\nrun smack up against such unuseful directions as Lysenko.  Such "extra-\nrational" cases are curiosities -- not guides to methodology.
I don't think they provide homeopaths, heck the heir apparent was trying to \npromote Osteopaths to the ranks of eligibility a couple of years back... It \npleased my family no end, since I'm at an Osteopathic school, sort of \nvalidated it for them...then I told them that the name was the same but the \npractice was different....oh.\n	If you're seeking validation for your philosophy on the strength of \nthe national health service adopting it, I suggest that you are not very \nsure of the validity of your philosophy. I believe in 1946, the NHS was \nstill having its nurses taught the fine art of "cupping", which is the \nvacuum extraction of intradermal fluids by means of heating a cup, placing \nit on the afflicted site and allowing it to cool.\n	I wouldn't take my sick daughter to a homeopath.
Does the Bates method work?  I first heard about it in this newsgroup \nseveral years ago, and I have just got hold of a book, "How to improve your\nsight - simple daily drills in relaxation", by Margaret D. Corbett, \n('Authorized instructor of the Bates method), published in 1953.  It \ntalks about vision improvement by relaxation and exercise.  Has there been\nany study on whether this method actually works?  If it works, is it by \nactually shortening the previously elongated eyeball, or by increasing \nthe lens's ability to flatten itself in order to compensate for the \ntoo-long eyeball?\n\nSince myopia is the result of eyeball elongation, seems to me the most\nlogical approach for correction is to find a way to reverse the process,\ni.e., shorten it somehow (preferably non-surgically).  Has there been\nany recent studies on this?  Where can I find them?  I know RK works by \nchanging the curvature of the cornea to compensate for the shape of \neyeball, but if there is a way to train the muscles to shorten the \neyeball back to its correct length that would be even better (Bates's \nidea, right?)
This is also commonly seen in new teachers.  The first few years, they're\nsick a lot, but gradually seem to build up immunities to almost everything\ncommon.  Come to think of it, I was about my healthiest when I was\nworking in a pathogens lab, exposed to who-knows-what all the time.  Pre-OSHA,\nof course.
Many people responded with more anecdotal stories; I think its safe to\nsay the original poster is already familiar with such stories.\nPresumably, he wants hard info to substantiate or refute claims about\nMSG making people ill. \n\nSimilarly, debunking such claims without doing research (whether\nliterature and lab), is equally beside the point. The original poster\nno doubt already knows that some people think 'Chinese Restaurant\nSyndrome' is bogus.\n\nPlacebos are all very interesting, but irrelevant to the question of\nwhat effects MSG has. You could have real effects *and* placebo\neffects; people may have allergies in addition. \n\n\nHave you read Olney's work? I fail to see how citing results from\npeer-reviewed studies qualifies as "bizarrely cracked".\n\n\nTests have been done on Rhesus monkeys, as well. I have never seen a\nstudy where the mode of administration was intra-ventricular.  The Glu\nand Asp were administered orally. Some studies used IV and SC.\nIntra-ventricular is not a normal admin. method for food tox. studies,\nfor obvious reasons. You must not have read the peer-reviewed works\nthat I referred to or you would never have come up with this brain\ninjection bunk.\n\n\nPardon me, but where are you getting this from? Have you read the\njournals? Have you done a thorough literature search?\n\nBut, you're right, mice aren't the best to study this on. They're four\ntimes less sensitive than humans to MSG.\n\n\nThe point is exceeding the window. Of course, they're amino acids.\nNote that people with PKU cannot tolerate any phenylalanine.\n\nOlney's research compared infant human diets. Specifically, the amount\nof freely available Glu in mother's milk versus commercial baby foods,\nvs. typical lunch items from the Standard American Diet such as packaged\nsoup mixes. He found that one could exceed the projected safety margin\nfor infant humans by at least four-fold in a single meal of processed\nfoods. Mother's milk was well below the effective dose.\n\n\n\nBetween who? Over what? I would be most interested in seeing you\nprovide peer-reviewed non-food-industry-funded citations to articles\ndisputing that MSG has no effects whatsoever. \n\n\nHmm. ".com". Why am I not surprised?
<>Hismanal (astemizole) is most definitely linked to weight gain.\n<>It really is peculiar that some antihistamines have this effect,\n<>and even more so an antihistamine like astemizole which purportedly\n<>doesn't cross the blood-brain barrier and so tends not to cause\n<>drowsiness.\n<\n<The original poster mentioned fatigue.

I am told (by the person who I care a lot about and who I am worried\nis going to start putting his health and money into homeopathy without\nreally knowing what he is getting into and who is the reason I posted\nin the first place about homeopathy) that in Britain homeopathy is\navailable on the National Health Service and that there are about 6000\nGPs who use homeopathic practices. True? False? What?\n\nHave there been any important and documented investigations into\nhomeopathic principles?\n\nI was reading a book on homeopathy over the weekend. I turned to the\nsection on the principles behind homeopathic medicine, and two\nparagraphs informed me that homeopaths don't feel obliged to provide\nany sort of explanation. The author stated this with pride, as though\nit were some sort of virtue! Why am I sceptical about homeopathy? Is\nit because I am a narrow-minded bigot, or is it because homeopathy\nreally looks more like witch-doctory than anything else?

Both of these symptoms are related - tachycardia. Getting a flushed\nface is due to the heart pumping the blood faster than a regular\npulse.  I suspect this is related to an increase in sodium levels in\nthe blood, since note *sodium chloride* monosodium glutamate. Both are\nsodium compounds. Our bodies require sodium, but like everything else,\none can get too much of a good thing.\n\n\nAgain, this could be related to increased blood flow from increased\nheart rate, from the sodium in the MSG. Distended crainial arteries,\nessentially. One of many causes of headaches. There is no discrepency\nher, necessarily.\n\n\n\nWell stomache ache and vomiting tend to be related. Again, not\nnecessarily a discrepency. More likely a related reaction. Vomiting\noccurs as a response to get rid of a noxious compound an organism has\neaten. If a person can't digest the stuff (entirely possible - the\nlist of stuff people are allergic to is quite long), and lacks an\nenzyme to break it down, gastrointestinal distress (stomach or belly\nache) would be expected.\n\n\n\n\nThese are respiratory reactions, and are now considered to be similar\nto vomitting. They are a way for the body to dispose of noxious\ncompounds. They are adaptiove responses. Of course, it is possible\nsome other food or environmental compound could be responsible for the\nsymptoms. But it's important to remember that a lot opf these effets\ncan be additive, synergystic, subtractive, etc, etc. It would be\nnecessary to know exactly what was in a dish, and what else the person\nwas exposed to. Respiratory does sound suspicious BUT  resopiration\nand heart rate are connected.  Things in the body are far from\nsimple...very inetractive place, the vertebrate body.\n \n\nPeople respond in a myriad of ways to the same compound. It depends\nupon what it is about the compound that "pisses off" their body.\nPollen, for example, of some plants aggrivates breathing in many\npeople, because, when inhaled, it sets of the immune system, and an\nhistamine attack is launched. The immune system goes overboard,\ncausing the allergic person a lot of misery. And someone with an\nallergy to some pollens will have trouble with some herb teas that\ncontain pollens (Chamomile, linden, etc). Drinking the substance can\nperturb that person's system as much as inhaling it. \n\n\nSee above. And don't think that heart rate changes, and circulatory\nproblems are not serious. They can be deadly.\n\nand brain damage. \n\nThe area of the brain effected is the neuroendocrine system\ncontrolling the release of gonadotropin, the supra-hormone controlling\nthe cyclical release of testosterone and estradiol, as well as somatostatin,\nand other steroids. Testing for effective dose would be, uh, a wee bit unethical.\n\n\npoisoning. \n\nAbsolutely. But it could also be some synergystic mess from eating ,\nsay, undetected shrimp or mushrooms (to which many are allergic), plus\ntoo much alcohol, and inhaling too much diesel fumes biking home,\nplus, let's say, having contracted flu from one's sig. other 3 days\nbefore from drinking out of the same glass. Could be all sorts of\nthings.\n\nBut it might be the MSG. \n\n\nIf noone else got sick, its likely not food poisoning. Probably\nstomach flu or an undetected thing the guy's allergic to.\n\n\nAnyway, the human body's not a machine; people vary widely in their\nresponses, and a lot of reactions are due to combinations of things.
It is not true that dermatologists gave not reached the laser age, in\nfact, lasers in dermatological surgery is a very new and exciting field.\n\nIt probably won't be effective in tinea pedis because the laser is\nusually a superficial burn (to avoid any deeper damage). Limited tinea\npedis can be cured albeit sometimes slowly by topical antifungals as\nwell as systemic medication i.e. tablets. Finally, a self-diagnosis is\nnot always reliable, lichen simplex chronicus can look like a fungal\ninfection and requires very different treatment.
I have a friend who has just been diagnosed with Lupus, and I know nothing\nabout this disease. The only thing I do know is that this is some sort of\nskin disease, and my friend shows no skin rashes - in fact, they used a \nblood test to determine what had been wrong with an on going sacro-\nilliac joint problem. \nI am finding a hard time finding information on this disease. Could\nanyone please enlighten me as to the particulars of this disease. \nplease feel free to E-mail me at \nbytor@cruzio.santa-cruz.ca.us

I think we agree on much.  However the paragraphs above seem to repeat\nuncritically the standard Kuhn/Lakatos/Feyerabend view of "progress" and\n"rationality" in science.  Since I've addressed these issues in this\nnewsgroup in the not too distant past, I won't go into them again now.\n\nWhat is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives the\nimpression (and you may not in fact hold this view) that the common (perhaps\neven the "correct") approach for a scientist to follow is to sit around\nhaving flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies and\npetty hatreds.  It further at least implicitly advances the position that\nsciences goes "forward" (and it is not clear what this means given the\ncontext in which it occurs) by generating in a completely non-rational\nand even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then\nweeded out via the "critical function" of science.  (Though why this critical\nfunction should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery.\nIf experimental design, hypotheses creation, and theory construction are\nsubject to jealousies and petty hatreds, then this must be equally true\nof the application of any "critical function" concerning replication.\nThis is what leads one (ala Feyerabend) to an "anything goes" view.)\n\nTrue, the generation part *can* be totally irrational.  But typically it is\n*not*.  Anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to have\nresulted in some way from a dream or from one's political views simply\ndo not generalize well to the actual history of science.
:I recently attended an allery seminar.  Steroid Nasal sprays were \n:discussed.  Afterward on a one-on-one basis, I asked the speaker what if \n:none of the Vancanese, Beconase, Nasalide, Nasalcort, or Nasalchrom work \n:nor do any oral decongestants work.  She replied that she saw an article on \n:Vasomotor Rhinitis.  That this is not an allergic reaction and that nothing \n:other than the Afrin's and such would work.  (Which in my case is true).\n\nThere has been some recent research on vasomotor rhinitis that shows that\nipratroprium bromide (Atrovent) inhaled nasally is an effective treatment\nfor many sufferers.  It has been approved for this use and is available\nwith a nasal adaptor in Canada.  In the US the FDA has yet to approve this\nuse of the drug, but it is available as an oral inhaler (for COPD), and\nthese can be adapted for intranasal use.
FYI...I just posted this on alt.psychoactives as a response to\nwhat the group is for......\n\n\nA note to the users of alt.psychoactives....\n\nThis group was originally a takeoff from sci.med.  The reason for\nthe formation of this group was to discuss prescription psychoactive\ndrugs....such as antidepressents(tri-cyclics, Prozac, Lithium,etc),\nantipsychotics(Melleral(sp?), etc), OCD drugs(Anafranil, etc), and\nso on and so forth.  It didn't take long for this group to degenerate\ninto a psudo alt.drugs atmosphere.  That's to bad, for most of the\nserious folks that wanted to start this group in the first place have\nleft and gone back to sci.med, where you have to cypher through\nhundreds of unrelated articles to find psychoactive data.\n\nIt was also to discuss real-life experiences and side effects of\nthe above mentioned.\n\nOh well, I had unsubscribed to this group for some time, and I decided\nto check it today to see if anything had changed....nope....same old\nnine or ten crap articles that this group was never intended for.\n\nI think it is very hard to have a meaningfull group without it\nbeing moderated...too bad.\n\nOh well, obviously, no one really cares.\n\nBill Claussen\n\n\nWould anyone be interested in starting a similar moderated group?
In myopia the cornea is too curved.  There is too much of a bulge in the\ncenter.\n\nIn PRK the laser removes a small amount of material from the center.\n\nIn RK the surgeon cuts incisions near the edge.  They heal, and the scarring\nreshapes the cornea.\n\nEntirely different mechanisms, and the action is in a different place.
Having been gone for 10 days, I'm way behind on my News reading, so many\npardons if I am repeating something that has been said already.\n\nI read a good book while I was away, THE ANTIBIOTIC PARADOX: HOW MIRACLE DRUGS\nARE DESTROYING THE MIRACLE, Stuart B. Levy, M.D., 1992, Plenum Press,\nISBN:0-306-44331-7.\n\nIt is about drug resistant microorganisms & the history of antibiotics.  It\nis interesting & written at a level which I think many sci.med readers would\nappreciate -- which is:  it assumes an intelligent reader who is capable of\nunderstanding scientific concepts, but who may not yet have been exposed to\nthis particular information. I.e., it assumes you are smart enough to\nunderstand it, but it does not assume that you already have a degree in\nmicrobiology or medicine. Table of contents:\n\nChapter 1\n	From Tragedy the Antibiotic Age is Born\nChapter 2\n	The Disease and the Cure:  The Microscopic World of Bacteria and\n	Antibiotics\nChapter 3\n	Reliance on Medicine and Self-Medication: The Seeds of Antibiotic\n	Misuse\nChapter 4\n	Antibiotic Resistance:  Microbial Adaptation and Evolution\nChapter 5\n	The Antibiotic Myth\nChapter 6\n	Antibiotics, Animals and the Resistance Gene Pool\nChapter 7\n	Further Ecological Considerations:  Antibiotic Use in Agriculture,\n	Aquaculture, Pets, and Minor Animal Species\nChapter 8\n	Future Prospects:  New Advances Against Potential Disaster\nChapter 9\n	The Individual and Antibiotic Resistance\nChapter 10\n	Antibiotic Resistance: A Societal Issue at Local, National, and\n	International Levels.\n\nIncludes bibliography and index.\n\nI personally found that it made very good Airplane-Reading.\n-rg
Avoiding mistakes is certainly highly desirable.  However it is also \nwidely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity. \nAnd in ordinary life, perfectionism carried beyond a certain point is \nindicative of a psychological disorder.  In the extreme case, a  \nperfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he might \nmake that he is unable to even leave the house.  \n\nIn science, we want to discover as much truth about the world as possible \nand we also want to have as much certainty as possible about these \ndiscoveries.  Usually there is some trade-off between these two desiderata \n--- the search for scope and the search for certainty.  \n\nIf 18th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from Newton and \nLeibniz then there would probably be no calculus today, because neither \nof the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense, since \nthey lacked the concept of a limit.  And in fact, because of the lack of \na rigorous foundation, they made a number of errors in their use of calculus. \nIt was only a hundred years later that Weistrass was able to give a solid \ngrounding for the ideas of Newton and Leibniz.  Nonetheless, what Newton \nand Leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a great \ndeal more from the application of their important ideas than it lost \nthrough the mistakes they made.  \n\n\nThese are not the rules according to many who post to sci.med and\nsci.psychology.  According to these posters  "If it's not supported by\ncarefully designed controlled studies then it's not science."\n\nTaken to the extreme, I believe that the attitude that empirical studies \nare everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultification \nof science.  \n\nFor one thing, an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology \nresults in a sort of scientific trade-unionism, where those outside \nthe establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support have \nno chance to obtain a hearing.  (I don't in the least believe that this \nis the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology.  Nonetheless, \nit is one of the results.)   And although institutional science has \ncertainly produced many wonderful results, I think it is a foolish \narrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment \n--- and using less than perfect empirical methodology --- will ever come \nwith anything worthwhile.  \n\nFurthermore, the big bucks approach to science promotes what I think is\none of the most significant errors in science:  choosing to investigate\nquestions because they can be readily handled by the currently\nfashionable methodology (or because one can readily get institutional\nor corporate sponsorship for them) instead of directing attention to\nthose questions which seem to have fundamental significance.\n\nFor instance, certain questions cannot be easily investigated with\nstatistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitative.\n(One could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in many\nareas of psychology.  In my opinion, a perusal of many of the papers\nresulting from the attempt by psychologists to force these questions\ninto a statistical framework gives the lie to Russell Turpin's\nassertion that current scientific methods "avoid all known errors.")\n\nI think that asking the wrong question is probably the most fundamental \nerror in science.  (Ignoring potentially valuable ideas is one of the \nothers.)  And I think that scientific journals are full of all \ntoo many studies done with impeccable empirical methods but which are \nworthless because the wrong question was asked in the first place.  \n\n--\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.
Yeah, the "Feingold Diet" is a load of crap.  Children diagnosed with ADD\nwho are placed on this diet show no improvement in their intellectual and\nsocial skills, which in fact continue to decline.  Of course, the parents\nwho are enthusiastic about this approach lap it up at the expense of their\nchildren's development.  So much for the value of "interesting anecdotal\nresults".  People will believe anything if they want to.
I sometimes see OTC preparations for muscle aches/back aches that\ncombine aspirin with a diuretic. The idea seems to be to reduce\ninflammation by getting rid of fluid. Does this actually work?

I'm thinking\n   that education suppliers for schools might have a appartus for\n   sale, but I don't know any of the companies. Any info is greatly\n   appreciated.\n	   In case you don't know, Krillean Photography, to the best of my\n   knowledge, involves taking pictures of an (most of the time) organic\n   object between charged plates. The picture will show energy patterns\n   or spikes around the object photographed, and depending on what type\n   of object it is, the spikes or energy patterns will vary. One might\n   extrapolate here and say that this proves that every object within\n   the universe (as we know it) has its own energy signature.\n\nThere have been a number of scientific papers (in peer-reviewed journals)\npublished about Kirlian photography in the early 1970s.  Sorry I can't be\nmore specific but it is a long time since I read them.  They would describe\nwhat is needed and how to set up the apparatus.  \n\nThese papers demonstrate that the auras obtained by Kirlian photography can\nbe completely explained by the effect of the electric currents used on the\nmoisture in the object being photographed.  It has nothing to do with the\n"energy signature" of organic objects.\n\nI did a science project on Kirlian photography when I was in high school.\nI was able to obtain wonderful auras from rocks and pebbles and the like by\nfirst dunking them in water.\n\nBarbara\n--
Archive-name: typing-injury-faq/software\nVersion: 1.8, 7th December 1992\n\nThis FAQ is actually maintained by Richard Donkin <richardd@hoskyns.co.uk>.\nI post it, along with the other FAQ stuff.  If you have questions, you want\nto send mail to Richard, not me.  -- Dan\n \n \n		    Software Tools to help with RSI\n		    -------------------------------\n \nThis file describes tools, primarily software, to help prevent or manage RSI.\nThis version now includes information on such diverse tools as calendar\nprograms and digital watches...\n \nPlease let me know if you know any other tools, or if you have information\nor opinions on these ones, and I will update this FAQ.\n\nI am especially interested in getting reviews of these products from people\nwho have evaluated them or are using them.  \n \nRichard Donkin                           \nInternet mail: richardd@hoskyns.co.uk              \nTel: +44 71 814 5708 (direct)\nFax: +44 71 251 2853\n\nChanges in this version:\n\n     Added information on StressFree, another typing management tool \n     for Windows.\n\n\nTYPING MANAGEMENT TOOLS: these aim to help you manage your keyboard use,\nby warning you to take a break every so often.  The better ones also include\nadvice on exercises, posture and workstation setup.  Some use sound hardware to\n \nwarn of a break, others use beeps or screen messages.\n\nOften, RSI appears only after many years of typing, and the pain has\na delayed action in the short term too: frequently you can be typing\nall day with little problem and the pain gets worse in the evening.\nThese tools act as an early warning system: by listening to their\nwarnings and taking breaks with exercises, you don't have to wait for your \nbody to give you a more serious and painful warning - that is, getting RSI.\n\n \n    Tool: At Your Service (commercial software)\n    Available from:\n	Bright Star\n	Tel: +1 (206) 451 3697\n    Platforms: Mac (System 6.0.4), Windows\n    Description:\n	Provides calendar, keyboard watch, email watch, and system info. \n	Warns when to take a break (configurable).  Has a few recommendations\n	on posture, and exercises.  Sound-oriented, will probably work best \n	with sound card (PC) or with microphone (Mac).  Should be possible\n	to record your own messages to warn of break.\n \n    Tool: AudioPort (sound card and software)\n    Available from:\n	Media Vision\n	Tel: +1 (510) 226 2563\n    Platforms: PC\n    Description:\n	A sound card to plug into your PC parallel port.\n	Includes 'At Your Service'.\n \n    Tool: Computer Health Break (commercial software)\n    Available from:\n	Escape Ergonomics, Inc\n	1111 W. El Camino Real\n	Suite 109\n	Mailstop 403\n	Sunnyvale, CA\n	Tel: +1 (408) 730 8410\n    Platforms: DOS\n    Description:\n	Aimed at preventing RSI, this program warns you to take\n	breaks after a configurable interval, based on clock time, or\n	after a set number of keystrokes -- whichever is earlier.\n	It gives you 3 exercises to do each time, randomly selected from\n	a set of 70.  Exercises are apparently tuned to the type of work\n	you do - data entry, word processing, information processing.\n	Exercises are illustrated and include quite a lot of text on\n	how to do the exercise and on what exactly the exercise does.\n\n	CHB includes hypertext information on RSI that you can use \n	to learn more about RSI and how to prevent it.  Other information\n	on non-RSI topics can be plugged into this hypertext viewer.\n	A full glossary of medical terms and jargon is included.\n\n	CHB can be run in a DOS box under Windows, but does not then\n	warn you when to take a break; it does not therefore appear\n	useful when used with Windows.\n\n	Cost: $79.95; quantity discounts, site licenses.\n\n    Comments:\n	The keystroke-counting approach looks good: it seems better\n	to measure the activity that is causing you problems than to\n	measure clock time or even typing time.  The marketing stuff\n	is very good and includes some summaries of research papers,\n	as well as lots of arguments you can use to get your company \n	to pay up for RSI management tools.  \n\n    Tool: EyerCise (commercial software)\n    Available from:\n	RAN Enterprises\n	One Woodland Park Dr.\n	Haverhill, MA  01830, US\n	Tel: 800-451-4487 (US only)\n    Platforms: Windows (3.0/3.1), OS/2 PM (1.3/2.0) [Not DOS]\n    Description:\n	Aimed at preventing RSI and eye strain, this program warns you to take\n	breaks after a configurable interval (or at fixed times). Optionally\n	displays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are\n	animated and program beeps you to help you do exercises at the\n	correct rate.  Includes 19 stretches and 4 visual training \n	exercises, can configure which are included and how many repetitions\n	you do - breaks last from 3 to 7 minutes.  Also includes online help \n	on workplace ergonomics.  \n\n	Quote from their literature:\n\n	"EyerCise is a Windows program that breaks up your day with periodic\n	sets of stretches and visual training exercises.  The stretches work\n	all parts of your body, relieving tension and helping to prevent\n	Repetitive Strain Injury.  The visual training exercises will improve\n	your peripheral vision and help to relieve eye strain.  Together these\n	help you to become more relaxed and productive."\n \n	"The package includes the book _Computers & Visual Stress_ by Edward C.\n	Godnig, O.D. and John S. Hacunda, which describes the ergonomic setup\n	for a computer workstation and provides procedures and exercises to\n	promote healthy and efficient computer use. \n	\n	Cost: $69.95 including shipping and handling, quantity discounts\n	for resellers.  Free demo ($5 outside US).\n \n    Comments:\n	I have a copy of this, and it works as advertised: I would say\n	it is better for RSI prevention than RSI management, because it\n	does not allow breaks at periods less than 30 minutes.  Also, it\n	interrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time, which\n	is not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day.  Worked OK on\n	Windows 3.0 though it did occasionally crash with a UAE - not sure\n	why. Also refused to work with the space bar on one PC, and has\n	one window without window controls.  Very usable though, and does not\n	require any sound hardware.\n\n    Tool: Lifeguard (commercial software)\n    Available from:\n	Visionary Software\n	P.O. Box 69447\n	Portland, OR  97201, US\n	Tel: +1 (503) 246-6200\n    Platforms: Mac, DOS (Windows version underway)\n    Description:\n	Aimed at preventing RSI.  Warns you to take a break\n	with dialog box and sound.  Includes a list of exercises\n	to do during breaks, and information on configuring your\n	workstation in an ergonomic manner.  Price: $59;\n	quantity discounts and site licenses.  The DOS product is\n	bought in from another company, apparently; not sure how\n	equivalent this is to the Mac version.\n	\n	The Mac version got a good review in Desktop Publisher \n	Magazine (Feb 1991).  Good marketing stuff with useful \n	2-page summaries of RSI problems and solutions, with \n	references.\n \n    Tool: StressFree (commercial software, free usable demo)\n    Available from:\n	LifeTime Software\n	P.O.

Quite a few exercises, can configure which ones\n	are included to some extent.  Online help.\n\n	Version 2.0 is out soon, Mac and DOS versions will be based\n	on this.\n\n	Cost: $29.95 if support via CompuServe or Internet, otherwise $39.95.  \n              Site license for 3 or more copies is $20.00 each.\n	      (NOTE: prices may have gone up for V2.0).\n \n    Comments:\n	I have had a play with this, and it works OK.  Its user interface\n	design is much better in 2.0, though still a bit unusual.\n	expensive tool around and it does the job.  It is also the only\n	tool with a redistributable demo, so if you do get the demo, post it\n	on your local bulletin boards, FTP servers and Bitnet servers!\n	Does not include general info on RSI and ergonomics, but it does \n	have the ability to step backward in the exercise sequence,\n	which is good for repeating the most helpful exercises.\n\n    Tool: Typewatch (freeware), version 3.8 (October 1992)\n    Available from:\n	Email to richardd@hoskyns.co.uk\n	Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/typewatch.shar\n    Platforms: UNIX (tested on SCO, SunOS, Mach; character and X Window mode)\n    Description:\n	This is a shell script that runs in the background and warns you\n	to stop typing, based on how long you have been continuously\n	typing.  It does not provide exercises, but it does check\n	that you really do take a break, and tells you when you\n	can start typing again.  \n\n	Typewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing\n	today, each time it warns you, which is useful so you\n	know how much you *really* type.  It also logs information\n	to a file that you can analyse or simply print out.  \n\n	The warning message appears on your screen (in character mode),\n	in a pop-up window (for X Windows), or as a Zephyr message\n	(for those with Athena stuff).   Tim Freeman <tsf@cs.cmu.edu> \n	has put in a lot of bug fixes, extra features and support for \n	X, Zephyr and Mach.\n\n	Not formally supported, but email richardd@hoskyns.co.uk\n	(for SCO, SunOS, character mode) or tsf@cs.cmu.edu (for Mach,\n	X Window mode, Zephyr) if you have problems or want to give \n	feedback.\n\n    Tool: Various calendar / batch queue programs\n    Available from:\n	Various sources\n    Platforms: Various\n    Description:\n	Any calendar/reminder program that warns you of an upcoming\n	appointment can be turned into an ad hoc RSI management tool.\n	Or, any batch queue submission program that lets you submit\n	a program to run at a specific time to display a message to\n	the screen.\n\n	Using Windows as an example: create a Calendar file, and\n	include this filename in your WIN.INI's 'load=' line so\n	you get it on every startup of Windows.  Suppose you\n	want to have breaks every 30 minutes, starting from 9 am.\n	Press F7 (Special Time...) to enter an appointment, enter\n	9:30, hit Enter, and type some text in saying what the break\n	is for.  Then press F5 to set an alarm on this entry, and repeat \n	for the next appointment.\n\n	By using Windows Recorder, you can record the keystrokes\n	that set up breaks throughout a day in a .REC file.  Put this\n	file on your 'run=' line, as above, and you will then, with\n	a single keypress, be able to set up your daily appointments\n	with RSI exercises.\n\n	The above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs. \n	An example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job\n	that runs at 9:30 am and warns you to take a break; this will\n	depend a lot on your operating system.\n\n	While these approaches are not ideal, they are a good way of forcing \n	yourself to take a break if you can't get hold of a suitable RSI \n	management tool.  If you are techie enough you might want to\n	write a version of Typewatch (see above) for your operating\n	system, using batch jobs or whatever fits best.\n\n    Tool: Digital watches with count-down timers\n    Available from:\n	Various sources, e.g. Casio BP-100.\n    Description:\n	Many digital watches have timers that count down from a settable\n	number of minutes; they usually reset easily to that number, either\n	manually or automatically.  \n\n	While these are a very basic tool, they are very useful if you\n	are writing, reading, driving, or doing anything away from\n	a computer which can still cause or aggravate RSI.  The great\n	advantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you\n	are doing.\n	\n    Comments:\n	My own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to\n	my writing a lot more, and still reading as much as ever, which\n	actually aggravated the RSI in my right arm though the left\n	arm improved.  Getting a count-down timer watch has been\n	very useful on some occasions where I write a lot in a day.\n\n	I have tried an old fashioned hour-glass type egg timer, but\n	these are not much good because they do not give an audible\n	warning of the end of the time period!\n\n\nKEYBOARD REMAPPING TOOLS: these enable you to change your keyboard mapping\nso you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout.  \nOne-handed typing tools may help, but be VERY careful about how \nyou use them -- if you keep the same overall typing workload you\nare simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing,\nand may therefore make matters worse.\n\n    Tool: hsh (public domain)\n    Available from:\n	Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/hsh.shar\n    Platforms: UNIX (don't know which ones)\n    Description:\n	Allows one-handed typing and other general keyboard remappings.\n	Only works through tty's (so, you can use it with a terminal or\n	an xterm, but not most X programs).\n\n    Tool: Dvorak keyboard tools (various)\n    Available from:\n	Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/xdvorak.c\n	Also built into Windows 3.x. \n    Description:\n	The Dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layout\n	that involves more balanced hand use.   It *may* help prevent\n	RSI a bit, but you can also use it if you have RSI, since \n	it will slow down your typing a *lot* :-)
A.  Folks, do we have an FAQ on tinnitus yet?\n\nB.  As a lo-o-o-ong time sufferer of tinnitus and as a neuroscientist\nwho has looked over the literature carefully I believe the following\nare reasonable conclusions:\n\n1. Millions of people suffer from chronic tinnitus.\n2. The cause it not understood.\n3. There is no accepted treatment that cures it.\n4. Some experimental treatments may have helped some people a bit, but\nthere have be no reports--even anecdotal--of massive good results with\nany of these experimental drugs.\n5. Some people with chronic loud tinnitus use noise blocking to get to sleep.\n6. Sudden onset loud tinnitus can be caused by injuries and sometimes\nabates or goes away after a few months.\n7. Aspirin is well known to exacerbate tinnitus in some people.\n8. There is a national association of tinnitus sufferers in the US.\n9. One usually gets used to it.  Especially when concentrating on\nsomething else the tinnitus becomes unnoticed.\n10.  Stress and lack of sleep make tinnitus more annoying, sometimes.\n11.  I'm sure those of us who have it wish there was a cure, but there\nis not.
It's worse than that -- there *is* no such thing as\n   a double-blind study on the effects of MSG, by\n   virtue of the fact that MSG changes the taste of food in\n   a characteristic way that is detectable by the subject and\n   that cannot be duplicated by a placebo.\n\nCommon! You can easily disguise  to flavor of  MSG by putting  it in a\ncapsule. Then,  the  study  becomes  a  double  blind of  MSG capsules\nagainst control  capsules (containing exactly  the same contents minus\nthe MSG).\n--
:) No...I was one of the lucky ones. Very little acne as a teenager. I\ndidn't have any luck with clearasil. Even though my skin gets oily it\nreally only gets miserable pimples when it's dry. \n\nFrequent lukewarm water rinses on the face might help. Getting the scalp\nthing under control might help (that could be as simple as submerging under\nthe bathwater till it's softened and washing it out). Taking a one a day\nvitamin/mineral might help. I've heard iodine causes trouble and that it  \nis used in fast food restaurants to sterilize equipment which might be\nwhere the belief that greasy foods cause acne came from. I notice grease \non my face, not immediately removed will cause acne (even from eating\nmeat).\n\nKeeping hair rinse, mousse, dip, and spray off the face will help. Warm\nwater bath soaks or cloths on the face to soften the oil in the pores will\nhelp prevent blackheads. Body oil is hydrophilic, loves water and it\nsoftens and washes off when it has a chance. That's why hair goes limp with\noilyness. \n\nBecoming convinced that the best thing to do with\na whitehead is leave it alone will save him days of pimple misery. Any\nprying of black or whiteheads can cause infections, the red spots of\npimples. Usually a whitehead will break naturally in a day and there won't\nbe an infection afterwards.\n\nTell him that it's normal to have some pimples but the cosmetic industry\nmakes it's money off of selling people on the idea that they are an\nincredible defect to be hidden at any cost (even that of causing more pimples).
I have seen a fair bit of traffic recently concerning Epilepsy and\nseizures.  I am also interested in this subject -- I have a son with\nEpilepsy and I am very active with the local association.  I posted a\nmessage like this a few months ago and received no replies, but here it\nis again.\n\nIs anyone interested in participating in a mailing list on Epilepsy and\nseizures?  This would allow us to hold discussions and share\ninformation via electronic mail.  I already run a Listserver for two\nother groups, so the mechanics would be easy.\n\nIf you are interested, mail me a note.  If I get enough replies, I will\nmake it happen and provide you with the details.\n\nBTW, I have also started a database on Epilepsy.  This is part of my\nresearch on natural language question answering systems.  Users of this\nservice are able to ask questions about Epilepsy and the program\nsearches the database and retrieves its best response.  The technology\nworks by comparing your question against a set of questions that have\nbeen seen before.  All new questions that are not answered are recorded\nand used to improve the system.\n\nThis database is still small and sparse, but we are adding new\ninformation.  To try it out, do the following\n\n	telnet debra.dgbt.doc.ca\n	login: chat\n\n	Then select the Epilepsy item from the menu of databases.\n\n-- \nAndrew Patrick, Ph.D.       Communications Research Centre, Ottawa, CANADA\n                       andrew@calvin.dgbt.doc.CA
Probably she meant that your blood pressure went up while you were on\nthe treadmill.  This is normal.

Not to drag this out anymore, but....\n\nMany veterinarians feel that Lyme Disease in dogs is so easy to treat that\nin an endemic area, they often just give the appropriate antibiotics to dogs\npresenting with lameness, swollen joints, +/- fever.\n\nA recent paper (March 1993) has finally established that Lyme disease in dogs\ncan be reproduced in a controlled experimentaly setting.  This has been\nan ellusive matter for researchers, and is one of the fundamental requirements\nfor many to acknowledge an agent as being causitive of a particular disease.\nUp to now, only the vaccine manufacturer has been able to "prove" that\nthe disease exists.\n\nThis paper is noteworthy in two other regards:\n\n1) None of the animals they infected were treated in any way.  The dogs\nhad episodes of lameness during a 6-8 week period which occurred 2-5\nmonths after exposure.  After this period, none showed any further\nclinical signs up to the 17 month observation period of the study.  So\nthese are proven, clinically sick Lyme patients showing spontaneous\nrecovery without the benefit of drug treatment. Of course, observations\nlonger than 17 months will be necessary to be sure the disease doesn't\nhave the same chronicity that some see in humans.\n\n2)  The addendum to the paper calls into question the techniques used by the\nvaccine manufacturer to validate the vaccine.  Of course, they want\nthe world to use the model they developed in order to test vaccine\nefficacy.\n\nAnyway, maybe we will see some independent, scientifically sound evaluations\nof this vaccine in the next year or so.
PDR and CPS are good places to starts.\n\ndo a medline search... lots of interesting debates going on (remember\nwhen Prozac was impicated in suicidal behaviour?)
His _heart_? This jerk doesn't have a heart, and it beats me why you're\napologizing for him. In my book, behavior like this is unprofessional,\ninexcusable, and beyond the pale. If he's overworked, it's because he's too\nbusy raking in the bucks. More likely, he just likes to push women around.\nI'd fire the s.o.b., and get myself another doctor.
How long does it take a smoker's lungs to clear of the tar after quitting? \nDoes your chances of getting lung cancer decrease quickly or does it take\na considerable amount of time for that to happen?
I was there in 1976.  I suppose it must have died out since 1946,\nthen.  Certainly I never heard of any homeopaths or herbalists in\nthe employ of the NHS.  Perhaps the law codified it but the authorities\nrefused to hire any homeopaths.  A similar law in the US allows\nchiropractors to practice in VA hospitals but I've never seen one\nthere and I don't know of a single VA that has hired a chiropractor.\nThere are a lot of Britons on the net, so someone should be able to\ntell us if the NHS provides homeopaths for you.\n\n\n-- \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGordon Banks  N3JXP      | "Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and\ngeb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon."

You are absolutely daft.  No flame required.  You lack a brain.\n\n\n\nWell... at least you're educated, it seems.  But give credit\nwhere credit is due: to Richard Dawkin(s?) \n(the meme is a meme he invented)
: Living things maintain small electric fields to (1) enhance certain\n: chemical reactions, (2) promote communication of states with in a\n: cell, (3) communicate between cells (of which the nervous system is\n: a specialized example), and perhaps other uses.\n\nTrue.\n\n: These electric fields change with location and time in a large\n: organism.\n\nAlso True.\n\n\n: Special photographic techniques such as applying external fields in\n: Kirillian photography interact with these fields or the resistances\n: caused by these fields to make interesting pictures.\n\nNot really.  \n\nKirlian photography is taking pictures of the corona discharge from\nobjects (animate or inanimate).  The fields applied to the objects are\nmillions of times larger than any biologically created fields.  If you\nwant to record the biologically created electric fields, you've got to\nuse low-noise, high-gain sensors typical of EEGs and EKGs.  Kirlian\nphotography is just phun-with-physics type stuff (right up there with\nsoaking chunks of extra-fine steel wool in liquid oxygen then hitting\nthem with a hammer -- which, like a Kirlean setup, is fun but possibly\ndangerous).\n\n: Perhaps such pictures will be diagonistic of disease problems in\n: organisms when better understood. Perhaps not.\n\nProbably not.
----------\n\nYeah, it might, if you only read the part you quoted.  You somehow left \nout the part about "we all ate the same thing."  Changes things a bit, eh?\n\nYou complain that people blame MSG automatically, since it's an unknown and\ntherefore must be the cause.  It is equally (if not more) unreasonable to\ndefend it, automatically assuming that it CAN'T be the culprit.\n\nPepper makes me sneeze.  If it doesn't affect you the same way, fine.\nJust don't tell me I'm wrong for saying so.
Unfortunately, Hep B infection can eventuate in chronic hepatitis and\nsubsequent cirrhosis.  Although not many patients with Hep B go on to\nchronic hepatitis, it does still occur in a good number (20%?) and is\nsomething to keep in mind.  Hepatitis C (was: non-A, non-B Hep) much\nmore frequently leads to chronic hep and cirrhosis.  There is also an\nautimmune chronic hepatitis that affects mostly younger women which\nalso leads to cirrhosis.  \n\nOf course, cirrhosis is a most unkind disease.  The most dangerous\neffects relate to portal hypertension and loss of liver function. \nPatients develop life-threatening variceal bleeds and hepatic comas,\namong many other problems, as a result of disturbances in hepatic\ncirculation.  Less ominously, they can exhibit the effects of\nhyperestrogenemia which often characterize patients with cirrhosis. \nThese effects include telangiactasias (small red skin lesions) and, in\nmen, gynecomastia (breast development).  The only real treatment for\ncirrhosis is liver transplant.\n\nKeep in mind that cirrhosis is not expected, at least statistically, in\nyour friend's case.  Nevertheless you might want to bring up the\nsubject of chronic disease and cirrhosis with the doctor.  Hopefully he\nor she can then carefully explain these sequelae of Hep B infection to\nyou, and offer you support.

Dr. Noordewier has \nappointments in both Computer Science and Biology at Rutgers, and \nhas extensive experience in basic biological research in addition \nto his current work in computational biology.\n\n12:00-2:45pm "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for \n Biologists"  Dr. Richard Lathrop (MIT & Arris Corp.)\n\nAn overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be \npresented, as it relates to actual and potential biological \napplications.  Fundamental techniques, symbolic programming \nlanguages, and notions of search will be discussed, as well as \nselected topics in somewhat greater detail, such as knowledge \nrepresentation, inference, and machine learning.  The intended \naudience includes biologists with some computational background, \nbut no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence.  Dr. \nLathrop, co-developer of ARIADNE and related technologies, has \nworked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to \nbiological problems in both academia and industry.\n\n3:00-5:45pm "Neural Networks, Statistics, and Information Theory \n in Biological Sequence Analysis" Dr. Alan Lapedes (Los Alamos \n National Laboratory) \n\nThis tutorial will cover the most rapidly-expanding facet of \nintelligent systems for molecular biology, that of machine \nlearning techniques applied to sequence analysis.  Closely \ninterrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical \nneural networks to elicit both specific signals and general \ncharacteristics of sequences, and the relationship of such \napproaches to statistical techniques and information-theoretic \nviews of sequence data.  Dr. Lapedes, of the Theoretical \nDivision at Los Alamos, has long been a leader in the use of such \ntechniques in this domain.\n\n3:00-5:45pm "Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming" \n Prof. John Koza (Stanford University)\n\nThe genetic algorithm, an increasingly popular approach to highly \nnon-linear multi-dimensional optimization problems, was originally \ninspired by a biological metaphor.  This tutorial will cover both \nthe biological motivations, and the actual implementation and \ncharacteristics of the algorithm.  Genetic Programming, an \nextension well-suited to problems where the discovery of the size \nand shape of the solution is a major part of the problem, will \nalso be addressed.  Particular attention will be paid to \nbiological applications, and to identifying resources and software \nthat will permit attendees to begin using the methods.  Dr. Koza, \na Consulting Professor of Computer Science at Stanford, has taught \nthis subject since 1988 and is the author of a standard text in \nthe field.\n\n3:00-5:45pm "Linguistic Methods in Sequence Analysis" \n Prof. David Searls (University of Pennsylvania) \n & Shmuel Pietrokovski (Weizmann Institute)\n\nApproaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies \nare increasingly in evidence.  These involve the adaptation of \ntools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic \npattern recognition and gene prediction, the classification of \ngenetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory, the \nidentification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes \nin sequence data, and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and \nfunctional relatedness.  Dr. Searls, who holds research faculty \nappointments in both Genetics and Computer Science at Penn, \nrepresents the branch of this field that considers higher-order \nsyntactic approaches to sequence data, while Shmuel Pietrokovski \nhas studied and published with Prof. Edward Trifinov in the area \nof word-based analyses.\n\n                      REGISTRATION FORM\nMail, with check made out to "ISMB-93", to:\n\n               ISMB Conference, c/o J.

We have reached our goal!  A Hewlett Packard\nScanjet IIp was purchased this week.\n\nThank you to the following individuals whose contributions I just received:\n\nJohn Sorenson\nCarol Sigelman\nCarla Moore\nBarbara Moose\nJudith Schrier\n\nAgain, thank you to all who gave!\n\nI have been using Wordscan Plus for the past couple of weeks and would like to \nreview the product.  Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems.  \nIt runs under Windows 3.1 and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett \nPackard Scanners.  \n\nWhen initially bringing up the software, it lets you select several options; \n(1) text / graphics (2) input source ie scanner, fax file, disk file (3) \nautomatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image. \n\nI like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which \nparts of the document I would like scanned, and in what order.\n\nOnce an image is scanned, you can bring up the Pop-Up image verification.  The \nsoftware gives you two "errors" at this point.  Blue which are words that were \nconverted reliability, but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary.  \nYellow shade, which are words that Wordscan Plus doesn't think it converted \ncorrectly at all.  I have found that the software should give itself more \ncredit.  It is usually correct, instead of wrong.  If a word is shaded blue, \nyou can add it to your personal dictionary.  The only problem is the personal \ndictionary will only handle about 200 words.  I find this to be very limited, \nconsidering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary. \n\nAfter a document is converted, you can save it in a multitude of word \nprocessor formats.  Also any images that were captured can be stored in a \nseperate TIFF or PCX file format.\n\nI was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files.  I use \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  1\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nan Intel Satisfaxtion card, which stores incoming faxs in a PCX/DCX format.  \nWhile most of my faxes were received in "standard" mode (200x100 dpi), the \naccuracy of Wordscan Plus was excellent. \n\nOverall, a very impressive product.  The only fault I could find is the \nlimitations of the size of the user dictionary.  200 specialized words is just \ntoo small. \n\nIf anyone has any specific questions, please do not hesitate to send me email.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  2\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n               Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - MMWR\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n                         Emerging Infectious Diseases\n                         ============================\n                   SOURCE: MMWR 42(14)   DATE: Apr 16, 1993\n\n                                 Introduction\n\n     Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious diseases would \nsoon be eliminated as a public health problem (1), infectious diseases remain \nthe major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in \nthe United States. Since the early 1970s, the U.S. public health system has \nbeen challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g., \nEscherichia coli O157:H7, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, \nLegionnaires disease, Lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). The incidences \nof many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera, \nmalaria, and tuberculosis (TB), have increased in many areas. Furthermore, \ncontrol and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug \nresistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease, \nsalmonellosis, shigellosis, TB, and staphylococcal infections (2). Emerging \ninfections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those \nin institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and \nminority and underserved populations. The substantial economic burden of \nemerging infections on the U.S. health-care system could be reduced by more \neffective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs \n(3). \n     This issue of MMWR introduces a new series, "Emerging Infectious \nDiseases." Future articles will address these diseases, as well as \nsurveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers and \npublic health officials. This first article updates the ongoing investigation \nof an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in the western United States (4). \n\nReferences\n\n1. Burnet M. Natural history of infectious disease.

Washington \n     On January 13, 1993, a physician reported to the Washington Department of \nHealth a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and an \nincrease in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea. During January 16-17, a \ncase-control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or \npostdiarrheal HUS identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controls \nimplicated eating at chain A restaurants during the week before symptom onset \n(matched odds ratio OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5). On January \n18, a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurants \nwas initiated. \n     As a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during January-\nFebruary 1993, 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to the \nstate health department. A total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the case \ndefinition of culture-confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection or postdiarrheal HUS \n(Figure 1). Of the 477 persons, 52 (11%) had close contact with a person with \nconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection during the week preceding onset of \nsymptoms. Of the remaining 425 persons, 372 (88%) reported eating in a chain A \nrestaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms. Of the 338 patients \nwho recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant, 312 (92%) reported eating \na regular-sized hamburger patty. Onsets of illness peaked from January 17 \nthrough January 20. Of the 477 casepatients, 144 (30%) were hospitalized; 30 \ndeveloped HUS, and three died. The median age of patients was 7.5 years \n(range: 0-74 years). Idaho \n     Following the outbreak report from Washington, the Division of Health, \nIdaho Department of Health and Welfare, identified 14 persons with culture-\nconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection, with illness onset dates from December \n11, 1992, through February 16, 1993 (Figure 2A). Four persons were \nhospitalized; one developed HUS. During the week preceding illness onset, 13 \n(93%) had eaten at a chain A restaurant. California \n     In late December, the San Diego County Department of Health Services was \nnotified of a child with E. coli O157:H7 infection who subsequently died. \nActive surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with \nE. coli O157:H7 infections or HUS from mid-November through mid-January 1993. \nFour of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nfour at a chain B restaurant in San Diego. After the Washington outbreak was \nreported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27% \nincrease in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January \n1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier. A case was defined as \npostdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, \nor any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E. coli O157:H7, with \nonset from November 15, 1992, through January 31, 1993. \n     Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition (Figure 2B). The \noutbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. Fourteen \npersons were hospitalized, seven developed HUS, and one child died. The median \nage of case-patients was 10 years (range: 1-58 years). A case-control study of \nthe first 25 case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched community \ncontrols implicated eating at a chain A restaurant in San Diego (matched \nOR=13; 95% confidence interval CI=1.7-99). A study comparing case-patients \nwho ate at chain A restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular-\nsized hamburger patties (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3). \nChain B was not statistically associated with illness. Nevada \n     On January 22, after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten \nat a local chain A restaurant, the Clark County (Las Vegas) Health District \nissued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea \ncontact the health department. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS, bloody \ndiarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness \nwith a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E. coli O157:H7, with \nonset from December 1, 1992, through February 7, 1993. Because local \nlaboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) medium to screen stools \nfor E. coli O157:H7, this organism was not identified in any patient. After \nSMAC medium was distributed, the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of \none patient 38 days after illness onset. \n     Of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition (Figure 2C), nine \nwere hospitalized; three developed HUS. The median age was 30.5 years (range: \n0-83 years). Analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age- and sex-\nmatched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant during \nthe week preceding illness onset (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence \nlimit=4.9). A case-control study using well meal companions of case-patients \nalso implicated eating hamburgers at chain A (matched OR=6.0; 95% CI=0.7-\n49.8). Other Investigation Findings \n     During the outbreak, chain A restaurants in Washington linked with cases \nprimarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on November \n19, 1992; some of the same meat was used in "jumbo" patties produced on \nNovember 20, 1992. The outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from 11 \nlots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributed \nto restaurants in all states where illness occurred. Approximately 272,672 \n(20%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall. \n     A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in the \nUnited States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\ncontaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing \nthe likelihood of contamination. The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter \nplants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. No one \nslaughter plant or farm was identified as the source. \n     Further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in \nfamilies and child day care settings is ongoing. \n\nReported by: M Davis, DVM, C Osaki, MSPH, Seattle-King County Dept of Public \nHealth; D Gordon, MS, MW Hinds, MD, Snohomish Health District, Everett; K \nMottram, C Winegar, MPH, Tacoma-Pierce County Health Dept; ED Avner, MD, PI \nTarr, MD, Dept of Pediatrics, D Jardine, MD, Depts of Anesthesiology and \nPediatrics, Univ of Washington School of Medicine and Children's Hospital and \nMedical Center, Seattle; M Goldoft, MD, B Bartleson, MPH; J Lewis, JM \nKobayashi, MD, State Epidemiologist, Washington Dept of Health.

This pathogen has since \nemerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS, the most common \ncause of acute renal failure in children. Outbreak investigations have linked \nmost cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although other \nfood vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have been \nimplicated (3). Preliminary data from a CDC 2-year, nationwide, multicenter \nstudy revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E. coli O157:H7 \nthat organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of 10 \nparticipating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8% of all bloody stools, a \nhigher rate than for any other pathogen. \n     Infection with E. coli O157:H7 often is not recognized because most \nclinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  7\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nSMAC medium, and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses \nassociated with infection (4). The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea \n(often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent. Younger age groups \nand the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and \ncomplications. Illness usually resolves after 6-8 days, but 2%-7% of patients \ndevelop HUS, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, \nrenal failure, and a death rate of 3%-5%. \n     This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community \noutbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in the absence of routine surveillance. Despite \nthe magnitude of this outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized in \nthree states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington \n(1). Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from \npersons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E. coli O157:H7 using SMAC agar (5). \nWhen infections with E. coli O157:H7 are identified, they should be reported \nto local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, public \nhealth action to prevent further cases. \n     E. coli O157:H7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, and can \ncontaminate meat during slaughter. CDC is collaborating with the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture's Food Safety Inspection Service to identify \ncritical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce \nthe likelihood of pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 entering the meat supply. \nBecause slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with \npathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens \nfrom the surface of the meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to be \ninternally contaminated. The optimal food protection practice is to cook \nground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juices \nare clear. In this outbreak, undercooking of hamburger patties likely played \nan important role. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued interim \nrecommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to \n155 F (86.1 C) (FDA, personal communication, 1993). \n     Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report \nand the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be \nconsumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of \noutbreaks. The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of \nthis pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections \ncaused by E. coli O157:H7 and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E. \ncoli O157:H7. \n\nReferences\n\n1.

Long-term use of \nsmokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of \noral cancer (2) -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons who \ncurrently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently (1). \nTo monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products, \nCDC's 1991 National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion and Disease \nPrevention supplement (NHIS-HPDP) collected information on snuff and chewing \ntobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian, \nnoninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years. This \nreport summarizes findings from this survey. \n     The 1991 NHIS-HPDP supplement asked "Have you used snuff at least 20 \ntimes in your entire life?" and "Do you use snuff now?" Similar questions were \nasked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. Current users of \nsmokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco \nuse at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the \ntime of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported having \nused snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the \ntime of the interview. Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and \nformer users. Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at \nleast 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as \nthose who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not \nsmoking now. Ever smokers included current and former smokers. Data on \nsmokeless tobacco use were available for 43,732 persons aged greater than or \nequal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide \nnational estimates. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using \nstandard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) \n(3). \n     In 1991, an estimated 5.3 million (2.9%) U.S. adults were current users \nof smokeless tobacco, including 4.8 million (5.6%) men and 533,000 (0.6%) \nwomen. For all categories of comparison, the prevalence of smokeless tobacco \nuse was substantially higher among men. For men, the prevalence of use was \nhighest among those aged 18-24 years (Table 1); for women, the prevalence was \nhighest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. The prevalence of \nsmokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians/Alaskan \nNatives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among American \nIndians/Alaskan Natives and blacks. Among both men and women, prevalence of \nsmokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education. Prevalence was \nsubstantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in \nrural areas. Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 10\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nmen and women below the poverty level, * this difference was significant only \nfor women (p less than 0.05) (Table 1). \n     Among men, the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those \naged 18-44 years but varied considerably by age; the prevalence of use of \nchewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group (Table 2). Although \nwomen rarely used smokeless tobacco, the prevalence of snuff use was highest \namong those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. \n     An estimated 7.9 million (4.4% 95% CI=4.1-4.6) adults reported being \nformer smokeless tobacco users. Among ever users, the proportion who were \nformer smokeless tobacco users was 59.9% (95% CI=57.7-62.1). Among persons \naged 18-24 years, the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users \n(56.2% 95% CI=49.4-63.0) than among chewing tobacco users (70.4% 95% \nCI=64.2-76.6). Among persons aged 45-64 years, the proportion of former users \nwas similar for snuff (68.9% 95% CI=63.1-74.7) and chewing tobacco (73.5% \n95% CI=68.9-78.1). \n     Among current users of smokeless tobacco, 22.9% (95% CI=19.9-26.0) \ncurrently smoked, 33.3% (95% CI=30.0-36.5) formerly smoked, and 43.8% (95% \nCI=39.9-47.7) never smoked. In comparison, among current smokers, 2.6% (95% \nCI=2.3-3.0) were current users of smokeless tobacco. \n     Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (67.3% \n95% CI=63.2-71.4) than among chewing tobacco users (45.1% 95% CI=40.6-\n49.6). \n\nReported by: Office on Smoking and Health, National Center for Chronic Disease \nPrevention and Health Promotion; Div of Health Interview Statistics, National \nCenter for Health Statistics, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless \ntobacco was highest among young males. Adolescent and young adult males, in \nparticular, are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that \nlink smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility. Use of oral \nsnuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players, encouraging this \nbehavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for \nnicotine addiction, oral cancer, and other mouth disorders (4). \n     Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among \nracial/ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels \nand socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require \nfurther explanation. For example, targeted marketing practices may play a role \nin maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups, and affecting the \ndifferential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons (5,6). \n     In this report, one concern is that nearly one fourth of current \nsmokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes. In the 1991 NHIS-HPDP, the \nprevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco \nusers than among current and never smokeless tobacco users. In a previous \nstudy among college students, 18% of current smokeless tobacco users smoked \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\noccasionally (7). In addition, approximately 7% of adults who formerly smoked \nreported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to \nstop smoking (8). Health-care providers should recognize the potential health \nimplications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use. \n     The national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special \npopulation target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless \ntobacco use, including males aged 12-24 years (to no more than 4% by the year \n2000 objective 3.9) and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth (to no more \nthan 10% by the year 2000 objective 3.9a) (9). Strategies to lower the \nprevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless \ntobacco use, integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts, \nenforcing laws that restrict minors' access to tobacco, making excise taxes \ncommensurate with those on cigarettes, encouraging health-care providers to \nroutinely provide cessation advice and follow-up, providing school-based \nprevention and cessation interventions, and adopting policies that prohibit \ntobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events (5). \n\nReferences\n\n1.

There's been extensive discussion on the CompuServe Cancer Forum about Dr. \nBurzynski's treatment as a result of the decision of a forum member's father \nto undertake his treatment for brain glioblastoma.  This disease is \nuniversally and usually rapidly fatal.  After diagnosis in June 1992, the \ntumor was growing rapidly despite radiation and chemotherapy.  The forum \nmember checked extensively on Dr. Burzynki's track record for this disease.  \nHe spoke to a few patients in complete remission for a few years from \nglioblastoma following this treatment and to an NCI oncologist who had \naudited other such case histories and found them valid and impressive.  \nAfter the forum member's father began Dr. Burzynski's treatment in \nSeptember, all subsequent scans performed under the auspices of his \noncologist in Chicago have shown no tumor growth with possible signs of \nshrinkage or necrosis.\n\nThe patient's oncologist, although telling him he would probably not live \npast December 1992, was vehemently opposed to his trying Dr. Burzynski's \ntreatment.  Since the tumor stopped its rapid growth under Dr. Burzynski's \ntreatment, she's since changed her attitude toward continuing these \ntreatments, saying "if it ain't broke, don't fix it."\n\nDr. Burzynski is an M.D., Ph.D. with a research background who found a \nprotein that is at very low serum levels in cancer patients, synthesized it, \nand administers it to patients with certain cancer types.  There is little \nunderstanding of the actual mechanism of activity.
-- and --\n\n\nGood grief; has no one ever heard of Biostatistics??  The University of\nWashington (plus 3 or 4 others [Harvard, UNC]) has a department and\nadvanced degree program in Biostatistics.  My wife has an MS Biostat, and\nthere are plenty of MDs, PhDs, and postdocs doing Biostatistical work.\nPeople do this for a living.  Really bright people study for decades to do\nthis sort of study well.\n\nAnecedotal evidence is worthless.  Even doctors who have been using a drug\nor treatment for years, and who swear it is effective, are often suprised\nat the results of clinical trials.  Whether or not MSG causes describable,\nreportable, documentable symptoms should be pretty simple to discover.  \n\nThe last study on which my wife worked employed 200 nurses, 100 doctors,\nand a dozen Ph.Ds at one University and at 70 hospitals in five nations.  I\nwould think the MSG question could be settled by one lowly Biostat MS\nstudent in a thesis.
I have between 15 and 25 nosebleeds each week, as a result of a genetic\npredisposition to weak capillary walls (Osler-Weber-Rendu). Fortunately,\neach nosebleed is of short duration.\n\nDoes anyone know of any method to reduce this frequency? My younger brothers\neach tried a skin transplant (thigh to nose lining), but their nosebleeds\nsoon returned. I've seen a reference to an herb called Rutin that is\nsupposed to help, and I'd like to hear of experiences with it, or other\ntechniques.
No, this is wrong.  The purpose is to preserve the substances in\nthe tubes longer by creating relativistic speeds and thus\ntime dilatation.  Of course, by slowing the subjective time of\nthe test tubes they get less bored, which is probably what you\nwere thinking of.

Hi,\n\nI've just returned from a visit with my OB/GYN and I have a few \nconcerns that maybe y'all can help me with.  I've been seeing \nher every 4 weeks for the past few months (I'm at week 28) \nand during the last 2 visits I've gained 9 to 9 1/2 pounds every \n4 weeks.  She said this was unacceptable over any 4 week period. \nAs it stands I've thus far gained 26 pounds.  Also she says that \nthough I'm at 28 weeks the baby's size is 27 weeks, I think she \nmentioned 27 inches for the top of the fundus.  When I was 13 \nweeks the baby's size was 14 weeks.  I must also add, that I had \nan operation a few years ago for endometriosis and I've had no \nproblems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain \nin my pelvic region during the pregnancy, and I have a very \ndifficult time moving, and the doc has recommended I not walk or \nmove unless I have to. (I have a little handicapped sticker for \nwhen I do need to go out.) \n\nAnyway that's 1/2 of the situation the other is that almost from \nthe beginning of pregnancy I was getting sick (throwing up) about \n2-3 times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated.  \n(I told her about this).  I know this because I wasn't eating \nvery much due to the nausea and could see the 'results'.  Well \nnow I only get sick about once every 1-2 weeks, and it is still bile \nrelated.  But in addition I had begun to feel movement near my \nupper right abdomen, just below the right breast, usually when I \nwas lying on my right side.  It began to get worse though because \nit started to hurt when I lay on my right side, and then it hurt  \nno matter what position I was in.  Next, I noticed that when I \nate greasy or fatty foods I felt like my entire abdomen had \nturned to stone, and the pain in the area got worse.  However if \nI ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to 'cut' the fat it \nwasn't as much of a problem.\n\nSo the doctor says I have cholistatis, and that I should avoid \nfatty foods.  This makes sense, and because I was already aware \nof what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship I have \nbeen avoiding these foods on my own.  But I'm still able to eat \nfoods with Ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods.  \n\nBut doc wants me to be on a non-fat diet.  This means no meat \nexcept fish and chicken w/o skin (I do this anyway).  No nuts, \nfried food, cheese etc.  I am allowed skim milk.  She said I \nshould avoid anything sweet (e.g. bananas).  Also I must only \nhave one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day ( \npotatoes, pasta, rice)!  She said I can't even cook vegetables in \na little bit of oil and that I should eat vegetables raw or \nsteamed.  I'm concerned because I understand you need to have \nsome fat in your diet to help in the digestive process.  And if \nI'm not taking in fat, is she expecting the baby will take it \nfrom my stores?  And why this restriction on carbohydrates if \nshe's concerned about fat?  I'm not clear how much of her \nrecommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on \ncholistatis, which I can't seem to find any information on.  She \noriginally said that I should only gain 20 pounds during the \nentire pregnancy since I was about 20 lbs overweight when I \nstarted.  But my sister gained 60 lbs during her pregnancy and \nshe's taken it all off and hasn't had any problems.  She also \nasked if any members of my family were obese, which none of them \nare.  Anyway I think she is overly concerned about weight gain, \nand feel like I'm being 'punished' by a severe diet.  She did \nwant to see me again in one week so I think she the diet may be \ntemporary for that one week. \n\nWhat I want to know is how reasonable is this non-fat diet?  I \nwould understand if she had said low-fat diet, since I'm trying \nthat anyway, even if she said really low-fat diet.  I think she \nassumes I must be eating a high-fat diet, but really it is that \nbecause of the endometriosis and the operation I'm not able to \nuse the energy from the food I do eat. \n\nAny opinions, info and experiences will be appreciated.  I'm \ntruly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict diet \nbecause fruits and vegetables go through my system in a few \nminutes and I'll end up having to eat constantly.  Thus far I \ndon't find any foods satisfying.\n\nThanks
:I recently had a case of shingles and my doctors wanted to give me\n:intravenous Acyclovir.\n:\n:It was a pain finding IV sites in my arms...can I have some facts about\n:how advantageous it is to give intravenous antibiotics rather than oral?\n:\n\nI think some essential information must be missing here, i.e., you must be\nsuffering from a condition which has caused immunosuppression.  There is\nno indication for IV acyclovir for shingles in an otherwise healthy\nperson.  The oral form can help to reduce the length of symptoms, and may\neven help prevent the development of post-herpetic neuralgia, but I\ncertainly would not subject someone to IV therapy without a good reason.\n\nTo address your more general question, IV therapy does provide higher and\nmore consistently high plasma and tissue levels of a drug.  For treating a\nserious infection this is the only way to be sure that a patient is\ngetting adequate drug levels.

Some recent postings remind me that I had read about risks \nassociated with the barbecuing of foods, namely that carcinogens \nare generated. Is this a valid concern? If so, is it a function \nof the smoke or the elevated temperatures? Is it a function of \nthe cooking elements, wood or charcoal vs. lava rocks? I wish \nto know more. Thanks.
From THE TUFTS UNIVERSITY GUIDE TO TOTAL NUTRITION: Stanley Gershoff, \n   Ph.D., Dean of Tufts University School of Nutrition; HarperPerennial, 1991\n   (ISBN #0-06-272007-4):\n\n	"The greatest hazard of barbecuing is that the cook will not use\n	 enough caution and get burned.  Some people suggest that the\n	 barbecuing itself is dangerous, because the smoke, which is \n	 absorbed by the meat, contains benzopyrene, which, in its pure form,\n	 has been known to cause cancer in laboratory animals.  However,\n	 in order to experience the same results, people would have to\n	 consume unrealistically large quantities of barbecued meat at a\n	 time."
I had a similar reaction to Chinese food but came to a completly different\nconclusion. I've eaten Chinese food for ages and never had problems. I went\nwith some Chinese Malaysian friends to a swanky Chinses rest. and they ordered\nlots of stuff I had never seen before. The only thing I can remember of that\nmeal was the first course, scallops served in the shell with a soy-type sauce.\nI thought, "Well, I've only had scallops once and I was sick after but that\ncould have been a coincidence". That night as I sat on the bathroom floor,\nsweating and emptying my stomach the hard way, I decided I would never touch\nanother scallop. I may not be allergic but I don't want to take the chance.

Can you provide a reference to substantiate that gaining back\nthe lost weight does not constitute "weight rebound" until it\nexceeds the starting weight?

I know from personal experience that men CAN get yeast infections. I \nget rather nasty ones from time to time, mostly in the area of the\nscrotum and the base of the penis. They're nowhere near as dangerous\nfor me as for many women, but goddamn does it hurt in the summertime!\nEven in the wintertime, when I sweat I get really uncomfy down there. The\nbest thing I can do to keep it under control is keep my weight down and\nkeep cool down there. Shorts in 60 degree weather, that kind of thing. And\nof course some occasional sun.
Can anyone provide information on CS chemical agent--the tear gas used recently\nin WACO.  Just what is it chemically, and what are its effects on the body?\n\ndsc@gemini.gsfc.nasa.gov  \n |  Regards,         |   Hughes STX                |    Code 926.9 GSFC        |\n |  Doug Caprette    |   Lanham, Maryland          |    Greenbelt, MD  20771   |
I recall reading in the recently revised edition of the "Yeast Connection"\nthat there is indeed work by researchers to do this.  Of course, they are\nworking on the theory that candida overbloom with penetration into mucus\nmembrane tissue with associated "mild" inflammatory response can and does\noccur in a large number of people.  If you reject this "yeast hypothesis",\nthen I'd guess you'd view this research as one more wasteful and quixotic\nendeavor.  Stay tuned.\n\nJon Noring\n\n-- \n\nCharter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.
Phenylketonuria is a disease in which the body cannot process phenylalanine.\nIt can build up in the blood and cause seizures and neurological damage.\nAn odd side effect is that the urine can be deeply colored, like red wine.\nPeople with the condition must avoid Nutrasweet, chocolate, and anything\nelse rich in phenylalanine.

Two thoughts.\n\n	- I think that psychologically it will be easier for the next \ngeneration to accept genetic manipulation.  It seems that people frown\nupon 'messing with Nature', ignoring our eons-old practice of doing just that.\nAny new human intervention is 'arrogance and hubris' and manipulation\nwe routinely do is 'natural' and certainly 'not a big deal'.\n\n	- Most interesting human traits will probably be massively\npolygenetic and be full of trade-offs.  In addition, without a positive\nsocial environment for the cultivation of genetic gifts, having them won't\nbe the advantage it's made out to be.  Some people will certainly pursue it\nas if it is the Grail, but we know how most of those quests turn out.
In fairness, we should note that if you look up "speculum" in the\ndictionary (which I did when this question first surfaced), the first\ndefinition is "a mirror or polished metal plate used as a reflector in\noptical instruments."\n\nWhich doesn't mean the name fits in this context, but it's not as far\noff as you might think.

Am I justified in being pissed off at this doctor?\n\nLast Saturday evening my 6 year old son cut his finger badly with a knife.\nI took him to a local "Urgent and General Care" clinic at 5:50 pm.  The \nclinic was open till 6:00 pm.  The receptionist went to the back and told the \ndoctor that we were there, and came back and told us the doctor would not \nsee us because she had someplace to go at 6:00 and did not want to be delayed \nhere.  During the next few minutes, in response to my questions, with several \ntrips to the back room, the receptionist told me:\n	- the doctor was doing paperwork in the back,\n	- the doctor would not even look at his finger to advise us on going\n	  to the emergency room;\n	- the doctor would not even speak to me;\n	- she would not tell me the doctor's name, or her own name;\n	- when asked who is in charge of the clinic, she said "I don't know."\n\nI realize that a private clinic is not the same as an emergency room, but\nI was quite angry at being turned away because the doctor did not want to\nbe bothered.  My son did get three stitches at the emergency room.  I'm still \ntrying to find out who is in charge of that clinic so I can write them a \nletter.   We will certainly never set foot in that clinic again.

Frequently of late, I have been reacting to something added to\nrestaurant foods.  What happens is that the inside of my throat starts\nto feel "puffy", like I have a cold, and also at times the inside of my\nmouth (especially the tongue) and lips also feel puffy.\n\nThe situations around these symptoms almost always involve restaurants\n(usually chinese), the most notable cases:  a cheap chinese fast food\nchain, a japanese steak house (I had the steak), and another chinese\nfast food chain where I SAW the cook put about a tablespoon or two of\nwhat looked like sugar or salt into my fried rice.\n\nI am under the impression that MSG "enhances" flavor by causing the\ntaste buds to swell.  If this is correct, I do not find it unreasonable\nto assume that high doses of MSG can cause other mouth tissues to swell.\n\nAlso, as the many of the occurances (including two of the above)\ninvolved beef, and as beef is frequently tenderized with MSG, this is\nwhat I suspect as being the cause.\n\nI wouldn't be at all surprised if toxicity studies of MSG in animals\nshowed it as being harmless, as it would be very startling to hear a lab\nrat or rhesus monkey complain about their throats feeling funny.\n\nAnyone who wishes to explain how the majority of food additives are\ntotally harmless is welcome to e-mail me with the results of any studied\nthey know of.  I will probably respond to them however with a reminder\nof how long it took to prove that smoking causes cancer (which the\ntobacco companies still deny).\n\n- DM\n\n(If I sound grumpy, it's because I had beef with broccoli for lunch\ntoday, and now it hurts to swallow)\n\n--\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDan Myers (Madman)		| If the creator had intended us to walk \nmyers@usceast.cs.scarolina.edu	| upright, he wouldn't have given us knuckles
There is this newsgroup sci.med.physics and there has been quite a lot\ndiscussion in this group about many chemical items e.g. prolactin\ncholesterol, TSH etc. Should there also be a newsgroup sci.med.chemistry?
No.  That these drugs happen to be useful as antidepressants is neither\nhere nor there.
If the nose culture shows Staph, then Ceftin or even Ceclor\n     are better. Suprax does not kill Staph. Treating bacterial\n     infections involves a lot of try-and-fail because the\n     infections often involve multiple organisms with many resistant\n     strains. Some 60% of Hemophilus Influenza strains are now\n     resistant. What works for me and my organisms may not work\n     for you and yours. Keep experimenting.\n	       Ken Colby
I can't answer most of your questions, but I've seen it happen in \nfamily members who are being treated with radiation and/or chemotherapy.\nJory Graham published a cookbook many years ago (in cooperation with \nthe American Cancer Society, I think) called "Something has to taste\ngood" (as I recall).\n\nThe cookbook was just what we needed several times when favorite foods\nsuddenly became "yech".

For several years I have been dealing with reccurring corneal  erosion.    There\ndoes  not  seem  to be much known about the cause of such a problem.  My current\nepisode is pretty bad since it is located in the middle of the cornea.  If  it's\nbad  enough, the usual treatment for it is puncture therapy.  However, my doctor\nthis time is trying to let it heal by  itself  by  putting  a  contact  lens  to\nprotect the area.  Apparently the problem is not that common, but I'd be curious\nif anyone else out there has a similar problem, perhaps to see if a cause can be\nfound.
I live at sea-level, and am called-upon to travel to high-altitude cities\nquite frequently, on business.  The cities in question are at 7000 to 9000\nfeet of altitude.  One of them especially is very polluted...\n\nOften I feel faint the first two or three days.  I feel lightheaded, and\nmy heart seems to pound a lot more than at sea-level.  Also, it is very\ndry in these cities, so I will tend to drink a lot of water, and keep\naway from dehydrating drinks, such as those containing caffeine or alcohol.\n\nThing is, I still have symptoms.  How can I ensure that my short trips there\n(no, I don't usually have a week to acclimatize) are as comfortable as possible?\nIs there something else that I could do?\n\nA long time ago (possibly two years ago) there was a discussion here about\naltitude adjustment.  Has anyone saved the messages?\n\nMany thanks,

DN> From: nyeda@cnsvax.uwec.edu (David Nye)\nDN> A neurology\nDN> consultation is cheaper than a scan.\n\nAnd also better, because a neurologist can make a differential\ndiagnosis between migraine, tension-type headache, cluster, benign\nintracranial hypertension, chronic paroxysmal hemicrania, and other\nheadache syndromes that all appear normal on a scan.  A neurologist\ncan also recommend a course of treatment that is appropriate to the\ndiagnosis.\n\nDN> >>Also, since many people are convinced they have brain tumors or other\nDN> >>serious pathology, it may be cheaper to just get a CT scan then have\nDN> >>them come into the ER every few weeks.\nDN> And easier than taking the time to reassure the patient, right?\nDN> Personally, I don't think this can ever be justified.\n\nSigh.  It may never be justifiable, but I sometimes do it.  Even\nafter I try to show thoroughness with a detailed history, neurologic\nexamination, and discussion with the patient about my diagnosis,\nsalted with lots of reassurance, patients still ask "why can't you\norder a scan, so we can be absolutely sure?"  Aunt Millie often gets\ninto the conversation, as in "they ignored Aunt Millie's headaches\nfor years", and then she died of a brain tumor, aneurysm, or\nwhatever.  If you can get away without ever ordering imaging for a\npatient with an obviously benign headache syndrome, I'd like to hear\nwhat your magic is.\n\nEvery once in a while I am able to bypass imaging by getting an EEG.\nMind you, I don't think EEG is terribly sensitive for brain tumor,\nbut the patient feels like "something is being done" (as if the\nhours I spent talking with and examining the patient were\n"nothing"), the EEG has no ionizing radiation, it's *much* cheaper\nthan CT or MRI, and the EEG brings in some money to my department.
KS> From: keith@actrix.gen.nz (Keith Stewart)\nKS>My wife has become interested through an acquaintance in Post-Polio Syndrome\nKS>This apparently is not recognised in New Zealand and different symptons ( eg\nKS>chest complaints) are treated separately. Does anone have any information\n\nI'm not sure that this condition is "recognised" anywhere (in the\nsense of a disease with diagnostic criteria, clear boundaries\nbetween it and other diseases, unique pathologic or physiologic\nfeatures, etc), but here goes with what many neurologists agree on.\n\nPost-polio syndrome patients have evidence of motor neuron disease\nby clinical examination, EMG, and muscle biopsy.  The abnormalities\nare mostly chronic (due to old polio) but there is evidence of\nongoing deterioration.  Clinically, the patients complain of\ndeclining strength and endurance with everyday motor tasks.\nMusculoskeletal pain is a nearly universal feature that doubtless\ncontributes to the impaired performance.  The examination shows\nmuscle weakness and atrophy.  The EMG shows evidence of old\ndenervation with reinnervation (giant and long-duration motor unit\naction potentials) *and* evidence of active denervation\n(fibrillation potentials).  The biopsy also shows old denervation\nwith reinnervation (fiber-type grouping) *and* evidence of active\ndenervation (small, angulated fibers with dense oxidative enzyme\nstaining) - but curiously, little or no group atrophy.\n\nPost-polio patients do not have ALS.  In ALS, there is clinically\nevident deterioration from one month to the next.  In post-polio,\nthe patients are remarkably stable in objective findings from one\nyear to the next.  Of course, there are patients who had polio\nbefore who develop genuine ALS, but ALS is no more common among\npolio survivors than among people who never had polio.\n\nThe cause of post-polio syndrome is unknown.  There is little\nevidence that post-polio patients have active polio virus or\ndestructive immunologic response to virus antigen.\n\nThere is no solid evidence that patients with post-polio have\nanything different happening to the motor unit (anterior horn cells,\nmotor axons, neuromuscular junctions, and muscle fibers) than\npatients with old polio who are not complaining of deterioration.\nBoth groups can have the same EMG and biopsy findings.  The reason\nfor these "acute" changes in a "chronic" disease (old polio) is\nunknown.  Possibly spinal motor neurons (that have reinnervated huge\nnumbers of muscle fibers) start shedding the load after several\nyears.\n\nThere are a couple of clinical features that distinguish post-polio\nsyndrome patients from patients with old polio who deny\ndeterioration.  The PPS patients are more likely to have had severe\npolio.  The PPS patients are *much* more likely to complain of pain.\nThey also tend to score higher on depression scales of\nneuropsychologic tests.\n\nMy take on this (I'm sure some will disagree):  after recovery from\nsevere polio there can be abnormal loading on muscles, tendons,\nligaments, bones, and joints, that leads to inflammatory and/or\ndegenerative conditions affecting these structures.  The increasing\npain, superimposed on the chronic (but unchanging) weakness, leads\nto progressive impairment of motor performance and ADL.  I am\nperhaps biased by personal experience of having never seen a PPS\npatient who was not limited in some way by pain.  I do not believe\nthat PPS patients have more rapid deterioration of motor units than\nnon-PPS patients (i.e., those with old polio of similar severity but\nwithout PPS complaints).
Food poisoning is only one of the many possible causes. Yes, even other people\nshare the food. \n\nBoy, you computer people only know 1s and 0s, but not much about logic. :-)\n\nNo. I did not said MSG was not the culprit. What I argued was that that\nthere was enough reasonable doubt to convict MSG.  \n\nIf you want to convict MSG, show me the evidence, not quilty by suspicion.\n\n\nNobody is forcing you to change what you believe.  But I certainly don't\nwant to see somebody preach to ban pepper because that makes him/her\nsneeze. That is exactly what some anti-MSG activitiests are doing\n\n\nLook, people with a last Chen don't necessarily own a Chinese restaurant.\nI am not interested if you enjoy Chinese food or not. Exploiting my last\nname to discredit me on the issue is hitting below the belt.\n\nWhat I am interested in is the truth. Let me give you an excert from\na recent FDA hearing:\n\n           ``There is no evidence orally consumed glutamate has any effect\non the brain,'' said Dr. Richard Wurtman of Massachusetts Institute\nof Technology. The anecdotal experiences of individuals is\n``superstition, not science,'' he said. ``I don't think glutamate\nhas made them sick.''\n\nAnd Dr. Robert Kenney of George Washington University conducted an double\nblind test in 1980 showing that the 35 people who reacted to MSG also\nhad similar reaction when they thought they had MSG but actually not.\n\nAlthough there are many contradicting personal stories told in this group,\nsome of them might have been due to other causes. But because the anti MSG\nemotion runs so high, that some blame it for anything and everything. \n\nMy purpose is to present a balance view on the issue, although I am probably\n20-1 outnumbered.
Just had the opportunity to watch this flick on A&E -- some 15 years\nsince I saw it last.  \n\nI was very interested in the technology demonstrated in this film\nfor handling infectious diseases (and similar toxic substances).\nClearly they "faked" a lot of the computer & robotic technology;\ncertainly at the time it was made most of that was science fiction\nitself, let alone the idea of a "space germ".  \n\nQuite coincidentally [actually this is what got me wanted to see\nthe movie again] I watched a segment on the otherwise awful _How'd\nThey Do That?_ dealing with a disease researcher at the CDC's top\nlab.  There was description of the elaborate security measures taken\nso that building will never be "cracked" so to speak by man or\nnature (short of deliberate bombing from the air, perhaps).  And\nthe researchers used "spacesuits" similar to that in the film.\n\nI'm curious what people think about this film -- short of "silly".\nIs such a facility technically feasible today?  \n\nAs far as the plot, and the crystalline structure that is not Life\nAs We Know It, that's a whole 'nother argument for rec.arts.sf.tech\nor something.
